        "abstract": "Objective To detect plasma soluble CD40 (sCD40) levels in uremic patients and explore its clinical significance. Methods Plasma sCD40 levels were detected in 20 uremic patients (uremia group), 20 hemodialyzed patients(hemodialysis group),and 20 healthy volunteers (control group) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The relationship of plasma sCD40 level with serum creatinine (Scr) or with C-reactive protein (CRP) was analyzed and the impact of hemodialysis on sCD40 was observed. Results sCD40 level was significantly higher in uremia group and hemodialysis group than in the control group(P < 0.01), while it was higher in hemodialysis group than in uremia group (P < 0.01). In uremia group, sCD40 level was positively related with Scr (P < 0.01) and CRP (P < 0.05), whereas there was no relation between sCD40 and Scr or CRP in hemodialysis group (P > 0.05). For one hemodialysis session, sCD40 level did not differ significantly after hemodialysis(P > 0.05). Conclusions An elevated plasma sCD40 level occurs in uremic patients, particularly in those on homodialysis, which may be involved in the abnormal immue function in these patients.",

        "abstract": "Based on the response surface methodology, an effective microbial system for diosgenin production from enzymatic pretreated Dioscorea zingiberensis tubers with Trichoderma reesei was studied. The fermentation medium was optimized with central composite design (3(5)) depended on Plackett-Burmann design which identified significant impacts of peptone, K(2)HPO(4) and Tween 80 on diosgenin yield. The effects of different fermentation conditions on diosgenin production were also studied. Four parameters, i.e. incubation period, temperature, initial pH and substrate concentration were optimized using 4(5) central composite design. The highest diosgenin yield of 90.57% was achieved with 2.67% (w/v) of peptone, 0.29% (w/v) of K(2)HPO(4), 0.73% (w/v) of Tween 80 and 9.77% (w/v) of substrate, under the condition of pH 5.8, temperature 30 degrees C. The idealized incubation time was 6.5 days. After optimization, the product yield increased by 33.70% as compared to 67.74 +/- 1.54% of diosgenin yield in not optimized condition. Scale-up fermentation was carried out in a 5.0 l bioreactor, maximum diosgenin yield of 90.17 +/- 3.12% was obtained at an aeration of 0.80 vvm and an agitation rate of 300 rpm. The proposed microbial system is clean and effective for diosgenin production and thus more environmentally acceptable than the traditional acid hydrolysis.",

We previously reported that a new derivative of diosgenin, compound 5, had significant anti-inflammatory activity superior to that of aspirin, prolonged bleeding time, and inhibited platelet aggregation in vitro. In the present study, we investigated the in vivo efficacy and safety of compound 5 using the ferric chloride (FeCl3)-induced arterial and venous thrombosis models in rats as well as its toxicity in mice. Compared with the control rats, those treated with compound 5 showed significantly less adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation and a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time mediated by the specific regulation of factor VIII. Furthermore, compound 5 significantly reduced the average length and weight of thrombi in both arteries and veins. These findings were similar to those of aspirin at the same dose. The safety evaluation revealed a much lower risk of bleeding and lesser gastric mucosal damage with compound 5 than with the same dose of aspirin. An oral dose of up to 575.5mg/kg showed no toxicity in mice. In conclusion, consistent with our in vitro findings, compound 5 exhibited an in vivo antithrombotic activity that was comparable to aspirin mainly by reducing platelet aggregation and regulating factor VIII, but with fewer side effects.",

In the relativistic central-field independent-particle approximation, oscillator-strength distributions of Yb+, Ba+, and Sr+ are calculated, respectively. The calculated results are in good agreement with our experiment on Yb+ and previous experiments on Ba+ and Sr+ where abnormal branching ratios were also found. We have found that the abnormal branching ratios are due to the appearance of Cooper minima or shape resonances. The results can be used to estimate the oscillator strength of unsymmetric double Rydberg states.",

In the theory, the dwell time solution meets almost all the requirements of precise computer numerical control (CNC) without any need for extra data processing. Several practical methods were discussed on how to solve the optimization model and obtain an optimal solution. Also analyses of the two algorithms were performed in this paper. The simulations show that both of the two algorithms have high precision. The computation efficiency is crucial for least squares algorithms because it is lower for large computation models. The least squares algorithm is numerically robust, while the uniform approximation algorithm isn't. Therefore, in practice it is advised to use the least squares algorithm more often for it have an excellent performance.",

In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of TP-58, a novel thienopyridine derivative, on a murine fulminant hepatitis model induced by concanavalin A (ConA). We found TP-58 markedly alleviated ConA-caused liver injury and increased survival ratio of mice injected with a lethal dose of ConA. Oral administration of TP-58 significantly alleviated ConA-caused liver injury in mice by the reduction of serum aminotransferases and liver necrosis.The analysis of proinflammatory cytokines showed that TP-58 decreased both hepatic mRNA expressions and serum protein levels of TNF-α and IL-6. And the result from LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells showed TP-58 suppressed the production of TNF-α, IL-6, and Nitro Oxide (NO) in the supernatant of LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The study of activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that TP-58 inhibited the activation of NF-κB both in vivo and in vitro. The inhibitory effect was also accompanied by a parallel reduction of IκB phosphorylation. These results indicate that TP-58 protects against liver injury by inhibition of the NF-κB-mediated inflammation and suggest a potential role of TP-58 against acute liver injury and other inflammatory diseases.",

We found that the three kinds of A. bisporus products were good sources of protein, with amount varying in the ranges of 16.54-24.35g/100g (dry weight). Freezing, canning and salting process, followed by 6months of storage led to a significant reduction in free amino acids, especially tyrosine, alanine, glutamine and cysteine. There were medium levels of MSG-like amino acids in frozen A. bisporus and canned A. bisporus, and low levels of MSG-like amino acids in salted A. bisporus. The mount of flavor 5'-nucleotides in frozen A. bisporus was higher than that of canned and salted A. bisporus. The present study thus suggests that freezing is beneficial for the preservation of A. bisporus.",

        "abstract": "Deltonin is an active component purified from Dioscorea zingiberensis WRIGHT (DZW), and has shown anticancer effects. However, its mechanism of action remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Deltonin on a panel of cancer cell lines and analyzed its mechanism in C26 cells, a murine colon carcinoma cell. Our results showed that Deltonin markedly inhibited the growth of all examined cancer cell lines. Deltonin induced dose- and time-dependent apoptosis in C26 cells. The event of apoptosis was accompanied by the release of cytochrome c, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, and dose- and time-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Deltonin also increased the expression of Bax, decreased the expression of B-cell lymphoma/lewkmia-2 (Bcl-2), and induced the activation of caspase 9, caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Furthermore, Deltonin decreased Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK(1/2)) activity. These results demonstrate that Deltonin mediates the growth inhibition of cancer cells through multiple targets, which include the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial apoptosis and the inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt signaling pathways, suggesting Deltonin is a potent cancer preventive and therapeutic agent.",

In the study, we found that dA significantly inhibited viability/proliferation of B16F10 melanoma cells, induced tumour cell arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, dA triggered its pro-apoptosis through damaging the mitochondrial function (membrane potential loss, ATP depletion and ROS overload generation etc.) and activating caspase-9, PARP, caspase-3 and the phosphorylation of p38. Treatment with p38 agonist confirmed the involvement of p38 pathway triggered by dA in B16F10 cells. The in vivo finding also revealed that administration of dA significantly decreased the tumour volume and tumour metastasis in B16F10 xenograft model by inhibiting tumour proliferation and inducing tumour apoptosis. Importantly, the results indicated that dA was specific against tumour cell lines and had no observed systemic toxicity in vivo. Taken together, our study demonstrated that dA could combate tumour in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of tumour via a p38-mediated mitochondria associated apoptotic pathway.",

However, the ages of samples along the sediment core were not in chronological order as they should be. To overcome the difficulty in obtaining a reliable chronology, we selected five samples based on their lithological characteristics and grain size distributions of the sediments and used their dates to build a chronology of the sediment core. The validity of the chronology was confirmed by comparing the inferred geochemical and geophysical parameters with previous studies. The criteria we used to select samples can be generalized and applied to pre-select dating samples for radiocarbon dating, especially for those formed in a complex environment and influenced by old carbon sources and glacier activities. Finally, we successfully applied this method to the selection of bulk sediment dating samples in a sediment core collected in Arctic, which testifies to the its effectiveness.",

Methods The clinical data of 46 patients with maintaining hemodialysis were collected. The patients were divided into hypotesion group (n=20) and control group (n=26) according to whether or not  hemodialytic hypotension was present. The factors related to intradialytic hypotension were compared between the two groups and the efficacy of combination of SP and UP in reducing intradialytic hypotension was observed. Results The ultrafiltration volume was higher, while serum natrium(Na) and albumin in hypotension group were lower than those in control group (P < 0.05) , blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were not significantly different between the two groups(P> 0.05). The analysis of echocardiology showed that left ventricular hypertrophy, systolic and diaslotic dysfunction in hypotension group were higher than those in control group(P < 0.05). Compared with standard dialysis(SD) , the frequency of hypotension was obviously reduced in the combination of SP and UP(P < 0.01). Conclusions Intradialytic hypotension is caused by many factors in elderly uremic patients undergoing hemodialysis. Hypotensive episodes significantly decreased in the combination of SP and UP.",

However, the genetic architecture of feeding behavior and feed efficiency traits remains elusive. To investigate the genetic architecture of feed efficiency in pigs, three feeding behavior traits (daily feed intake, number of daily visits to feeder, and duration of each visit) and two feed efficiency traits (feed conversion ratio and residual feed intake) were considered. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of the five traits using a population of 1,008 Duroc pigs genotyped with an Illumina Porcine SNP50K BeadChip. A total of 9 genome-wide ( < 1.54E-06) and 35 suggestive ( < 3.08E-05) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected. Two pleiotropic quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on SSC 1 and SSC 7 were found to affect more than one trait. Markers WU_10.2_7_18377044 and DRGA0001676 are two key SNPs for these two pleiotropic QTLs. Marker WU_10.2_7_18377044 on SSC 7 contributed 2.16 and 2.37% of the observed phenotypic variance for DFI and RFI, respectively. The other SNP DRGA0001676 on SSC 1 explained 3.22 and 5.46% of the observed phenotypic variance for FCR and RFI, respectively. Finally, functions of candidate genes and gene set enrichment analysis indicate that most of the significant pathways are associated with hormonal and digestive gland secretion during feeding. This study advances our understanding of the genetic mechanisms of feeding behavior and feed efficiency traits and provide an opportunity for increasing feeding efficiency using marker-assisted selection or genomic selection in pigs.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the correlation between psychological stress status and the personality of the soldiers who took part in a large-scale military exercise. Methods The psychological stress self-evaluation test (PSET), SCL-90 game and Eysenck personality questionnaire (EPQ) were conducted in 126 servicemen before and after a field military exercise. Correlation between psychological stress status and their personality profile was studied versus the SCL-90 after military exercise. Results 126 servicemen who had taken part in the military exercise were tested with PSET. The number of persons whose PSET data T≥70 increased from 9 before the exercise to 35 after the exercise (P<0.05). After a field military exercise, number of positive items and subscores of SCL-90 increased than before. Compared with that of before exercise, subscores of somatization, anxiety, obsession, phobia, paranoia, psychosis and additional subsores were all elevated (P<0.05). The scores of psychoticism (P) and the neuroticism (N) of EPQ were higher after the expercise than that of before exercise. No significant difference was found in in the scores in extroversion (E) and concealment (L) of EPQ (P<0.05). Scores of SCL-90 were positively with psychoticism (P) and neuroticism (N) of EPQ sensitivity scores, and negatively correlated with extrovesion (E) and concealment(L) of EPQ. Conclusion As a strong psychosocial stress, the field military exercise can lead to psychological change and injurions effect in personality in servicemen. Personality and interpersonal relation were the main factors in inducing negative psychological status. A suitable psychological intervention can reduce the stress induced by military exercise and enhance the mental health of the servicemen.",

        "abstract": "The diode-triggered silicon-controlled rectifier (DTSCR) is an important device for the electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection of low-voltage integrated circuits, and its trigger voltage is determined by the forward turn-on voltage of diode string and the voltage drops on the parasitic resistors of metal interconnects. For the conventional DTSCR, the voltage drops on the parasitic resistors are often negligible so its triggering voltage is mainly determined by the forward turn-on voltage of diode string, which decreases with increasing temperature due to the inherited negative temperature coefficient. In this paper, an improved and novel device called thermal-stable DTSCR (TSDTSCR) is proposed to offer an improved ESD protection stability at elevated temperatures. This is done by changing and optimizing the 3-D layout. In particular, the experimental results show that the trigger voltage drop of the TSDTSCR can be reduced to 13.5% at 125 °C, comparing to 27.18% of the DTSCR. The holding voltage of the TSDTSCR is also more stable than that of the DTSCR over a wide range of temperatures.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The development of a core set of SNP molecular markers that could be widely used in soybean genetic research would greatly facilitate research into the genetic diversity of soybean. We conducted an analysis of  Tokachi nagaha  and 137 of its descendant soybean cultivars using 4044 SNP markers with the goal of determining the appropriate number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) needed to construct unambiguous molecular IDs and characterize genetic diversity based on a genetic distance matrix correlation method. When the number of SNPs was held constant, the number of accession pairs that could be distinguished increased as the polymorphism informative content (PIC) value of the SNPs increased. A core panel of 20 selected SNPs from 11 linkage groups with a mean PIC value of 0.3703 and a range of 0.3640–0.3749 was able to identify almost all of the accession pairs in our study [9445 pairs (99.92%)]. The eight accession pairs that could not be identified with this core SNP set all originated from the same province and some of them had the same parental cultivars. The molecular IDs of the 138 accessions were constructed using the core 20 SNPs. It is known that both the number of SNPs and PIC values should be considered when SNPs are selected for use in the analysis of genetic diversity. In this study, when the PIC value was 0.3460, the correlation coefficient between the genetic distance matrices associated with a panel of 200 SNPs and the total population was u003e 0.800, indicating satisfactory correlation. Our high-accuracy, high-resolution core SNP panel for germplasm fingerprinting and our findings about assessing genetic diversity will likely markedly improve the management and utilization efficiency of soybean germplasm resources.",

The tests at elevated temperatures and high strain rates were carried out using a modified split Hopkinson tension bar apparatus. The experimental results show that deformation twinning is dependent on both temperature and strain rate. The density of deformation twinning increases with increasing test strain rate. However, it decreases with increasing test temperature. A constitutive model based on the dislocation kinetics and twinning effect was used to describe the stress-strain relationship of commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) at the investigated temperatures and strain rates. The simulated results show that the model can well describe the stress-strain relationship of CP-Ti in tensile deformation.",

        "abstract": "The individual effects of three different enzyme types -- one single enzyme (ellagitannin acyl hydrolase) and two combinations of enzymes (ellagitannin acyl hydrolase-beta-glucosidase-polyphenol oxidase and ellagitannin acyl hydrolase-cellulase-xylanase) -- on ellagic acid yield, combined with other process parameters -- enzyme concentration, hydrolysis time, particle size and solid-to-liquid ratio -- were evaluated by response surface methodology. The selection of the enzymes for the study was based on preliminary experiments that showed higher increments in ellagic acid yield. The quantitative parameters studied were enzyme concentration (0.1, 0.45, 2 w/w or %), solid-to-liquid ratio (0.05, 0.15, 0.2), particle size (220, 445, 900 microm) and hydrolysis time (60, 89, 132 min). Experimental data for ellagic acid yield obtained with a single enzyme and two combination enzymes correlated very well with process parameters (P<0.0001), resulting in models with high coefficient of determination for ellagic acid yield (r(2)=0.9636). The combinations of enzymes appeared more effective for ellagic acid production than the single enzyme did. The yield of ellagic acid from non-heat-treated acorn fringe by the use of enzymes in general increased, compared with that from heat-treated material. The research opens a technological-efficient way and develop easily-available renewable raw material for ellagic acid production.",

The modulation of Fas expression in gastric epithelial cells by H.pylori or by Th1 cytokines present in H.pylori-infected gastric mucosa was assessed in vitro. The function of Fas expressed by the gastric epithelial cells to induce cell apoptosis was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after incubation of the cells with anti-Fas antibody.All of the three gastric epithelial cell lines, AGS, N87 and kato-III, expressed detectable Fas protein when examined by flow cytometry. The percentage of positive cells and the amount of Fas protein on cell surface were larger in freshly isolated gastric epithelial cells with H.pylori infection than in uninfected cells (P<0.05). H. pylori alone or in combination with Th1 cytokines (IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) significantly increased the expression of Fas in gastric epithelial cell lines in vitro. After incubation with IgM anti-Fas mAb, Fas-bearing gastric epithelial cells underwent apoptosis, and this effect of Fas was enhanced by IFN-gamma.Th1 cells accumulated in the gastric mucosa during H.pylori infection is involved in the damage of gastric epithelium through the modulation of Fas/Fas ligand interaction.",

Using an extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) of m/z 149, free TBHQ was observed in rat serum after dosing TBHQ at 350 mg/kg to male and female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Four major metabolites of TBHQ were identified-a TBHQ-sulfate, two TBHQ-sulfate-derived substances and a TBHQ-glucuronide through MS(n) spectra. Besides its simplicity, the sample treatment allows one to obtain a very good recovery of analysts, namely around 95%. This result suggests that the method described here is useful for the analysis of TBHQ and its metabolites in rat serum. Moreover, the metabolism of TBHQ was investigated using the method. After oral administration, TBHQ appear to be more completely absorbed and bio-transformed by males than females, which may result in higher acute oral toxicity of TBHQ for males than females.",

The diagnosis of silent pulmonary embolism was established by computed tomography pulmonary arteriography (CTPA). The association between covariates and the prevalence of silent pulmonary embolism in patients with deep venous thrombosis in lower limbs were assessed using chi-square test and multivariable regression.The incidence of silent pulmonary embolism was 33.5% (108 in 322 patients) in all patients with deep venous thrombosis in lower limbs. Chi-square test showed male gender, the right lower limb, proximal location of the thrombus, unprovoked venous thrombosis and coexisting heart diseases were related to a higher incidence of silent pulmonary embolism in patients with deep venous thrombosis in lower limbs. The multivariate regression analysis confirmed that the risk factors associated with silent pulmonary embolism in deep venous thrombosis patients included the right side and proximal location of the thrombus (odds ratio: 2.023, 95% CI: 1.215-3.368; odds ratio: 3.610, 95% CI: 1.772-7.354), unprovoked venous thrombosis (odds ratio: 2.037, 95% CI: 1.188-3.493), coexisting heart diseases (odds ratio: 4.507, 95% CI: 2.667-7.618).Silent pulmonary embolism occurred frequently in patients with deep venous thrombosis in lower limbs.

        "abstract": "Objective: To determine the cytotoxic effects of acrolein on hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury in H9c2 cardiacmyocytes and investigate the intracellular signaling pathways. Methods: Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury model was established with H9c2 cells. The H9c2 cells were divided into four groups, the control group, acrolein group (ACR), H/R group, acrolein + H/R group (ACR+H/R). H9c2 cells pretreated with or without acrolein (10 μmol/L) for 30 min were exposed to 2 h hypoxia and 16 h reoxygenation. The effect of acrolein on the cellular viability and apoptosis of H9c2 cells was measured by MTT assay, DAPI stainning and flow cytometry (FCM) respectively. The expression of apotosis-related proteins (cytochrome c, caspase 9 and caspase 3) in the H9c2 cells was detected by Western blot. Results: Compared with mere H/R treatment, the decrease in cell viability and increase in the number of apoptotic cells in H9c2 cells subjected to H/R were significantly exacerbated in the presence of acrolein (P<0. 05). The liberation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol, the cleavages of the initiator caspase 9 and the effector caspase 3 have been observed after pretreatment with acrolein followed by H/R in H9c2 cells. Conclusion: Acrolein could aggravate H/R injury and that this effect may be related, in part, to the modification of proteins involved the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol and activation of caspases cascade reaction.",

        "abstract": "Corilagin, a gallotannin, is one of the major active components of many ethnopharmacological plants and exhibits antitumor, anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. In recent years, corilagin has provoked much attention due to its antitumor activity, yet the mechanisms attributed to its anticancer actions are largely unknown. In our previous research, our group reported that corilagin could inhibit the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells by inducing G2/M phase arrest. In the present study, observation of the morphological changes showed that corilagin induced the apoptosis of HCC cells as determined by AO/EB and Hoechst 33258 staining assays. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis was carried out to calculate the apoptotic rate which was 24.1% following treatment with corilagin (37.5 µM). At the molecular level, mitochondrial membrane potential assay and western blot analysis showed that the mitochondrial transmembrane potential was reduced and the rate of release of cytochrome c was increased, which led to the activation of caspase-9, caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP in the cytoplasm indicating activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Moreover, following treatment with corilagin, we noted upregulation of Fas and FasL and activation of caspase-8 which represented activation of the death receptor pathway, and we also observed downregulation of Bcl-2 and survivin which was also attributed to the antitumor effect of corilagin. These results suggest that corilagin significantly induced the apoptosis of HCC cells through both the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and the death receptor pathway, and corilagin is a potential complementary anticancer herbal drug for HCC therapy.",

[Methods] The serum level of IAP and sE-cad of 60 cases patients with colorectal cancer before and after operation were measured by one-directional immunodiffusion test and ELISA respectively and compared them with that of health controls. [Re-sults] In the patients with colorectal cancer before operation, the levels of IAP and sE-cad were higher [(673.3± 77.3) μg/mL VS (479.1±48.4) μg/mL, (146.4±21.4) μg/L VS (88.3±11.7) μg/L] than that of health controls (P <0.01). There was significant correlation between the levels with lymph node metastasis and clinical stage (TNM). Both lev-els of IAP and sE-cad were significantly decreased [(530.7±50.2) μg/mL VS (667.7±47.5) μg/mL, (106.6±28.3) μg/L VS (144.2±37.1) μg/L] (P <0.01) in 33 cases of patients with colorectal cancer after radical resection.

[Conclusions] The levels of IAP and sE-cad are closely related to tumor invasion, metastasis and clinical stage (TNM). Dynamic determination of the levels of IAP and sE-cad may be an important index for evalution of invasion, metastasis, efficiacy and progrosis for the patients with colorectal cancer.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The East Asian summer monsoon affects precipitation and hence vegetation in the densely populated Northwest Pacific region, yet a long-standing controversy exists concerning the spatial and temporal dynamics of the Holocene Optimum (HO) in the East Asian Monsoon Region. Here we use a detailed 14,000-year record reconstructing vegetation variations from a strategically selected crater lake from Northeast China, as well as a compilation of previous paleoclimatic studies, to show that the HO began around 6,000 Cal a BP in Northeast China, significantly later than generally recognized. By comparing our paleoenvironmental data with Holocene vegetation records from other regions of East Asia, we identified a marked northward shift for the onset of the HO from    ∼  10  ,  260    Cal    a BP in South China to    ∼  6  ,  000    Cal    a BP in Northeast China. The gradual northward transgression of the vegetation change could be caused by both the temperature and precipitation changes in different regions. Finally, we fitted a regression model of the start of the HO period versus latitude, which allowed us to make predictions for the beginning of the HO at different geographical locations. This study reveals a strong relationship between latitude and the initiation of the HO, and provides a window towards better understanding the forcing of vegetation changes in the East Asian monsoon region.",

        "abstract": "HIV-1-infected brains are characterized by increased amyloid deposition. To study the influence of HIV-1 on amyloid beta (Abeta) homeostasis at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) level, we employed a model of brain microvascular endothelial cells exposed to HIV-1 in the presence or absence of Abeta. HIV-1 markedly increased endogenous Abeta levels and elevated accumulation of exogenous Abeta. Simvastatin, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, blocked these effects. We next evaluated the effects of HIV-1 and/or simvastatin on expression of the receptor for lipoprotein related protein (LRP1) and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), known to regulate Abeta transport across the BBB. LRP1 expression was not affected by HIV-1; however, it was increased by simvastatin. Importantly, simvastatin attenuated HIV-1-induced RAGE expression. These results suggest that HIV-1 may directly contribute to Abeta accumulation at the BBB level. In addition, statins may protect against increased Abeta levels associated with HIV-1 infection in the brain.",

The H9c2 cells were divided into four groups, the control group, acrolein group (ACR), H/R group, acrolein + H/R group (ACR + H/R). H9c2 cells pretreated with or without acrolein (10 micromol/L) for 30 min were exposed to 2 h hypoxia and 16 h reoxygenation. The effect of acrolein on the cellular viability and apoptosis of H9c2 cells was measured by MTT assay, DAPI stainning and flow cytometry (FCM) respectively. The expression of apotosis-related proteins (cytochrome c, caspase 9 and caspase 3) in the H9c2 cells was detected by Western blot.Compared with mere H/R treatment, the decrease in cell viability and increase in the number of apoptotic cells in H9c2 cells subjected to H/R were significantly exacerbated in the presence of acrolein (P < 0.05). The liberation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol, the cleavages of the initiator caspase 9 and the effector caspase 3 have been observed after pretreatment with acrolein followed by H/ R in H9c2 cells.Acrolein could aggravate H/R injury and that this effect may be related, in part, to the modification of proteins involved the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol and activation of caspases cascade reaction.",

To gain a better understanding of the genetic determinants of IMF, we used a composite strategy, including single-locus and multi-locus association analyses to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for IMF in 1,490 Duroc boars. We estimated the genomic heritability of IMF to be 0.23 ± 0.04. A total of 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found to be significantly associated with IMF. The single-locus mixed linear model (MLM) and multiple-locus methods multi-locus random-SNP-effect mixed linear model (mrMLM), fast multi-locus random-SNP-effect efficient mixed model association (FASTmrEMMA), and integrative sure independence screening expectation maximization Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator model (ISIS EM-BLASSO) analyses identified 5, 9, 8, and 21 significant SNPs, respectively. Interestingly, a novel quantitative trait locus (QTL) on SSC 7 was found to affect IMF. In addition, 10 candidate genes (, , , , , , , , , and ) were found to be associated with IMF based on their potential functional roles in IMF. GO analysis showed that most of the genes were involved in muscle and organ development. A significantly enriched KEGG pathway, the sphingolipid signaling pathway, was reported to be associated with fat deposition and obesity. Identification of novel variants and functional genes will advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms of IMF and provide specific opportunities for marker-assisted or genomic selection in pigs. In general, such a composite single-locus and multi-locus strategy for GWAS may be useful for understanding the genetic architecture of economic traits in livestock.",

In this study, we isolated and identified seven steroidal saponins from the rhizomes of DZW: diosgenin, trillin, diosgenin diglucoside, deltonin, zingiberensis saponin (ZS), protodeltonin and parvifloside. Our results showed that these seven compounds inhibited the proliferation of a panel of established human and murine cancer cell lines in vitro. ZS had more cytotoxic effect than the other saponins, even close to doxorubicin on the murine colon carcinoma cell line C26. The proliferation inhibitory effect of ZS was associated with its apoptosis-inducing effect by activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 and specific proteolytic cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Exposure of C26 to ZS also resulted in Bax upregulation and Bcl-2 downregulation. In conclusion, the findings of this study demonstrated that ZS is an effective natural agent for cancer therapy, which may be mediated, in part, by induction of apoptosis, and DZW's potential as an anticancer agent is worth being further investigated.",

The experiment results show that the mechanical properties of 5CrMnMo are rate independent under room temperature. When the temperature increases, strain-rate-hardening and temperature-softening effects come into evident on the modules E, the yield stress σs and the tensile strength σb. The decreasing of strain-hardening-rate and the creep behavior also emerge and these phenomena become obvious with increasing temperature and decreasing strain rate. As the result, the unstable strain εb decreases, while the percentage elongation after fracture δ50 increases with increasing temperature; S50 decreases with increasing strain rate. At high temperature and low strain rate, the lath martensite reorientates to the loading direction.",

Compared to C 60 , the increased polarizabilities in X@C 60 are mainly from the enhanced charge transfer contribution of the cage and the local polarization of the interior X atoms, though the interior atoms are found less polarized than the corresponding free ones.",

With the exception of genetic variants associated with bioamine signaling, which have been implicated in aggression in many species, the genetic basis of natural variation in aggression is largely unknown. Drosophila melanogaster is a favorable model system for exploring the genetic basis of natural variation in aggression. Here, we performed genome-wide association analyses using the inbred, sequenced lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and replicate advanced intercross populations derived from the most and least aggressive DGRP lines. We identified genes that have been previously implicated in aggressive behavior as well as many novel loci, including gustatory receptor 63a (Gr63a), which encodes a subunit of the receptor for CO2, and genes associated with development and function of the nervous system. Although genes from the two association analyses were largely nonoverlapping, they mapped onto a genetic interaction network inferred from an analysis of pairwise epistasis in the DGRP. We used mutations and RNAi knock-down alleles to functionally validate 79% of the candidate genes and 75% of the candidate epistatic interactions tested. Epistasis for aggressive behavior causes cryptic genetic variation in the DGRP that is revealed by changing allele frequencies in the outbred populations derived from extreme DGRP lines. This phenomenon may pertain to other fitness traits and species, with implications for evolution, applied breeding, and human genetics.",

Results The levels of serum CA125 in CRF group and MHD group were both significantly higher than that in normal renal function group,19.83(51.96) kU/L and 30.44(78.29) kU/L vs 12.67(10.68) kU/L(P<0.01).There was no significant difference in serum CA125 between CRF group and MHD group(P>0.05).The ratios of serosal fluid in CRF group and MHD group were both significantly higher than that in normal renal function group,39.1% and 46.4% vs 6.3%(P<0.01).There was no significant difference in the ratios of serosal fluid between CRF group and MHD group(P>0.05).The ratios of serosal fluid,nephrotic syndrome,hypoalbuminemia,massive proteinuria and renal disfunction were significantly higher in CA125 positive group than those in negative group(P<0.01).In five patients,the levels of CA125 in pleural effusion were higher than those in serum.Nephrotic syndrome and serosal fluid were risk factors for elevated serum CA125(OR=33.867,95%CI=11.48-99.94 and OR=4.174,95%CI=1.176-14.810). Conclusion Elevated levels of serum CA125 are more observed in patients with kidney diseases.Serosal fluid is an important factor that can cause elevated levels of serum CA125.",

        "title": "Optimization of operating parameters for supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of lycopene by response surface methodology",
        "abstract": "An experimental design was developed to investigate the effect of operating temperature, operating pressure and extraction time on lycopene yield and extract antioxidant activity (IC 50 ) during supercritical carbon dioxide extraction from tomato pomace. The statistical analysis of the experiment indicated that individual factors such as pressure and temperature, and interactive factors such as pressure with temperature and time had significant effects on lycopene yield. The central composite design showed that the polynomial regression models developed were in good agreement with the experimental results, with R 2 of 0.97 and 0.94 for lycopene yield and extract antioxidant activity, respectively. The optimal condition for lycopene extraction within the experimental range of the variables studied was at 57 °C, 40 MPa, and 1.8 h. At this condition, the predicted amount of lycopene extracted was 28.64 mg in 100 g dried tomato pomace (corresponding to 93% lycopene recovery). In order to investigate the effect of experimental extraction condition on the antioxidant activity of the extract, IC 50 was used as an index, which is the concentration that gives 50% reduction in the absorbance of the hydroxyl free radical. The analysis of the results relating to extract antioxidant activity showed that the individual effects of pressure and time, as well as their interactive effects, were significant. The statistical model gave the optimal point for antioxidant activity at 57 °C, 53 MPa, and 1.8 h of extraction, at which the value of 1/IC 50 was 12.31 ml/mg (i.e. IC 50 = 0.081 mg/ml). Keywords Lycopene Supercritical CO 2 extraction Antioxidant activity Response surface methodology 1 Introduction Lycopene is the main among several carotenoids in tomato. Lycopene molecule corresponds to isoprenoid polyenes (C 40 H 56 ), which contain eight C5-isoprene units, and has a central skeleton constituted of 22 carbon atoms, and two ends with an additional 9 carbon atoms each. It exhibits strong free-radical scavenging activity ( Jamal and Chieri, 2006 ) superior to vitamin C and protects against lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage of LDL-cholesterol, cells, tissues, and cell membranes. In general, lycopene is highly sensitive to light, oxygen and heat, and can be degraded easily during the conventional extraction using organic solvents due to extended exposure to oxidative stresses ( Macias-Sanchez et al., 2005 ). Hence, there is considerable industrial interest in isolating lycopene from biological substrates for use in nutraceuticals and related applications. Supercritical fluid extraction has established itself as an alternative to traditional, low-selectivity, and questionable isolation processes using organic solvents, because of the relatively low critical temperature ( T c = 304.1 K), inertness, and non-toxicity of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) ( Felix-Valenzyela et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2001 ), the most commonly used supercritical solvent. Supercritical CO 2 extraction processes are typically carried out at near-environmental temperatures and in the absence of air, which reduces heat requirements, and avoids thermal and oxidative damage of labile compounds ( Mendes et al., 2003; Tonthubthimthong et al., 2001 ). There are several reports in literature on the supercritical CO 2 extraction of lycopene from tomato products ( Rozzi et al., 2002; Careri et al., 2001 ). Although supercritical carbon dioxide is nowadays considered a new alternative for benign extraction of natural compounds, the selection of the operating conditions for specific applications is still an area of active research. In the case of lycopene production from tomato, many recent studies have investigated the effects of operating conditions in order to find the optimal extraction conditions for the process ( Lamin et al., 2007; Topal et al., 2006; Ollanketo et al., 2001; Baysal et al., 2000 ). These previous investigations have reported that the total amount of lycopene extracted and its concentration in the extract are influenced by the extraction pressure and temperature. In most of the previous studies, the process conditions have been optimized merely by changing one variable-at-a-time. Such experiments do not consider interactions between process variables, which causes the results to be biased and the recommended operating conditions to be suboptimal. Although some of these researches have successfully extracted lycopene from tomato pomace by supercritical carbon dioxide extraction, the evaluation of the extract bioactivity, which is very important for industrial application of production from agricultural byproducts as functional additives, is scarcely considered in the extraction processes. Many researches have proven that the addition of an organic modifier such as ethanol can enhance the extraction efficiency of bioactive compounds by raising the solubility or extractive selectivity of CO 2 ( Lamin et al., 2007; Hasbay-Adil et al., 2007; Armando et al., 2006; Ruckenstein and Shulgin, 2002 ). In the case of processes influenced by multiple variables, statistical experimental design has been shown to be a powerful tool for determining the effects of operational factors and their interactions; this allows process optimization to be conducted effectively ( Wen et al., 2008a,b; Ozkal et al., 2005; Vasapollo et al., 2004 ). This technique has been used widely in the chemical industry and has been successfully applied to investigate the effects of extraction parameters on supercritical fluid extraction of lycopene and carotenoids ( Lamin et al., 2007; Careri et al., 2001 ). In this work, the experimental design and response surface methodology were applied to investigate the individual and interactive effects of operating pressure, temperature and extraction time on the amount of lycopene obtained from tomato pomace as well as the resultant antioxidant activity of the resulting extract by using ethanol-modified supercritical CO 2 as the extraction medium. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Tomato pomace was kindly provided by Xinjiang Tunhuaxin Tomato Product Co., Ltd. (Kuitun, Xinjing, China). Lycopene (purity > 98%, w/w, Sigma) was purchased from Shanghai Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest grade commercially available and purchased from Guoyao Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China). 2.2 Extraction of lycopene by soxhlet extraction To determine the total amount of lycopene in the extract, extraction was carried out in a soxhlet apparatus, in which 2 g of dried tomato pomace was extracted with 250 ml chloroform for 7 h until the color of the condensed solvent at the top of the apparatus was clear. 2.3 Pretreatment of sample The dried tomato pomace was saponified in 0.5 M aqueous NaOH at 40 °C for 45 min ensuring that the mixture was protected from light. The saponified tomato pomace was then neutralized to pH 7 using 1 M H 2 SO 4 , followed by centrifugation at 3000 r/min or 1730 g (F2402 H Allegra™ X-22R Cenrifuge, USA) for 15 min. The supernatant was removed and residue containing saponified tomato pomace was dehydrolyzed using absolute ethanol ( Inakuma, 1998 ) for supercritical extraction. 2.4 Supercritical fluid extractions A batch of 100 g of saponified tomato pomace powder was taken in a 1 l stainless steel tubular extractor. Ethanol (16%) was continuously added into an on-line cartridge and it was carried into the extractor by the SC-CO 2 . The procedure used was as follows. Liquid CO 2 from a siphon tube type cylinder was passed through a cooling bath and then compressed to the desired working pressure by a syringe pump, and subsequently heated up to the supercritical condition by a coil type heat exchanger. The supercritical CO 2 with ethanol flowed into the extractor, and contacted with the saponified powder to extract lycopene into the CO 2 phase. The extract laden CO 2 gas was led into the first separator accompanied by a pressure decreases to 7 MPa and 50 °C. Then, the extract was further depressurised in a second separator to 6 MPa and 30 °C. Finally, the expanded low-pressure CO 2 gas was released into ambient conditions. The extract collected in the second separator was ready for HPLC analysis of lycopene. 2.5 Lycopene determination Lycopene was analyzed in the reverse phase using HPLC (HP1100, fitted with a diode array detector detecting at 472 nm, Model G1306 A, Agilent Technologies, USA). Firstly, 20 μl sample was filtered (0.2 μm), and injected into a SUPELCOSIL LC-18 reverse phase column (15 cm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm). The mobile phase composition optimized for best composition was found to be acetonitrile: methanol (85:15, v/v). The flow rate was set to 1.0 ml/min. Lycopene was quantified using a calibration curve. 2.6 Analysis of antioxidant activity Scavenging hydroxyl radical was employed as index to estimate antioxidant activity of extract. In aqueous media OH is generated through the Fenton reaction. The reaction mixture included 20 μl FeCl 2 (1 × 10 −3 M), 30 μl, 1,10-phenanthroline (1 × 10 −3 M), 800 μl balanced salt solution (BSS) consisting of 3.1 mM KCl, 134 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM CaCl 2 , 1.2 mM MgSO 4 , 0.25 mM KH 2 PO 4 and 15.7 mM NaHCO 3 (pH 7.38), and 50 μl H 2 O 2 (0.6%). Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 510 nm using distilled water as a reference ( Xiaoyan et al., 2006 ). For comparing the antioxidant activity in various extracts, the concentration of extract producing 50% reduction in the radical absorbance (IC 50 ) was used as an index. The value of IC 50 was determined from the plot of percent inhibition versus the corresponding concentration of lycopene, in which the values of percent inhibition were calculated using the following equation: Percent inhibition ( % ) = ( 1 - A 1 / A 0 ) × 100 where A 1 and A 0 are absorbance of test sample and the reference, respectively. The data are presented as mean of triplicates, as the concentration of extract required for a 50% reduction (IC 50 ) of radical absorbance. 2.7 Experimental design For supercritical liquid extraction, the parameters influencing the amount of lycopene extracted are temperature, pressure, co-solvent additional ratio, flow rate and extraction time. However, in the present work, the co-solvent ratio was kept constant at 16% and the flow rate of carbon dioxide was kept constant at 0.7 l/min, which were shown to be most suitable in preliminary experiments. Therefore, this experiment involved 3 factors, extraction pressure, temperature and time. In the research, a 2 3 full factorial central composite design was employed to fit a second order polynomial model which indicated a requirement of 17 experiments for analysis ( Kui, 2005 ). The general equation of the second degree polynomial is stated as follows: (1) y = β 0 + ∑ i = 1 3 β i x i + ∑ i = 1 3 ∑ j ⩾ i 3 β ij x i x j + ε where y is the predicted response; x i , x j are input variables which influence the response variable y ; β 0 is a constant; β i is the i th linear coefficient; β ii is the quadratic coefficient and β ij ( i ≠ j ) is the linear-by-linear interaction between x i and x j . The test variables were transformed to range between −1 and 1 for the appraisals of factors. The variables were coded according to the following equation: (2) x i ′ = x i - x cp Δ x i , i = 1 , 2 , 3 where x i ′ is the coded value of the independent variable; x i is its real value; x cp is the its real value at the centre point; and Δ x i is the step change in the variable ‘ i ’. The actual and coded levels of the independent variables used in the experimental design are shown in Table 1 . ‘STATISTICA’ software (version 8.0, StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, USA) was used for response surface regression of the data obtained. The statistical analysis of the model was performed in the form of analysis of variance (ANOVA).This analysis includes the Fisher’s test (over-all model significance), its associated probability P ( F ), correlation coefficient R , and determination coefficient R 2 which measures the goodness of fit of regression model. It also includes the t -value for the estimated coefficients and associated probabilities. 3 Results and discussion As mentioned earlier, a 2 3 full factorial central composite design was used to evaluate, both, the main and the interaction effects of the operating parameters. All experimental data obtained are shown in Table 2 . The effects of the experimental parameters were evaluated by statistical analysis of the experimental data shown in Table 2 . The enter method was used to calculate the estimated coefficients of the polynomial functions of response surfaces for both lycopene yield and extract antioxidant activity. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) is presented in Table 3 for lycopene yield and the extract antioxidant activity in term of 1/IC 50 . The analysis showed that both models were statistically significant at 95% confidence. For supercritical fluid extraction, the solubility of organic compounds depends largely on the balance between fluid density and solute vapor pressure, which are both controlled by fluid temperature and pressure. When the pressure increases, the fluid density increases, thus the solubility increases. On the other hand, when the temperature increases, the fluid density decreases, however the solute vapor pressure increases. In other words, the solubility may increase, remain constant, or decrease with increase in the temperature at constant pressure, depending on whether the solute vapor pressure or the solvent density is the predominant factor. Fluid pressure in Tables 4 and 5 was found to play an important role in both lycopene yield and the extract antioxidant activity (IC 50 ). The results showed that the individual effects of pressure and temperature, and the interactive effects of pressure with temperature and time were significant in the case of lycopene yield. As a result, the extraction yields increased when the operating pressure increased. In the case of extract antioxidant activity, the individual effects of pressure and time, and the interactive effect between pressure and time were significant. Fig. 1 shows three-dimensional plot of the response surface for lycopene yield for which the polynomial function is (3) Lycopene yield ( mg ) = 24.05 - 1.50 [ P ] - 1.33 [ P ] 2 - 2.64 [ T ] 2 + 2.67 [ t ] - 2.46 [ P ] [ T ] + 1.62 [ T ] [ t ] Fig. 2 shows that the polynomial regression model was in good agreement with the experimental results, with R 2 of 0.97. From the model, the optimum condition for lycopene yield was at 57 °C, 40 MPa, and 1.8 h, and the lycopene yield was 28.64 mg in 100 g dried tomato pomace, approximately 93.81% of the total amount of lycopene determined from the soxhlet extraction, which was 30.53 mg. In case of lycopene from tomato pomace by supercritical CO 2 without any modifiers reported by Topal et al., the results showed that with optimized operating conditions, the maximum yield of lycopene (1.18 mg of lycopene/g of sample) was obtained at 100 °C and 40 MPa. However, the higher yield of lycopene from tomato wastes at higher temperatures without considering the bioactivity of extract has limited industrial application, because the bioactivity could well be compromised ( Ollanketo et al., 2001 ). It has been proved that organic solvents are used to improve the solubility of the bioactive components and ethanol seems to be favored because of its non-toxic effect, which is ideal for food products ( Lamin et al., 2007 ). Fig. 3 shows three-dimensional plot of the response surface for the extract antioxidant activity (1/IC 50 ), for which the polynomial function is (4) 1 / IC 50 ( ml/mg) = 11.26 + 0.72 [ P ] - 0.33 [ P ] 2 + 0.98 [ t ] - 0.26 [ t ] 2 - 0.34 [ P ] [ t ] As shown in Fig. 4 the coefficient of determination for this model regression indicated reasonable agreement between model and experimental results. The experimental results obtained from the approximate model suggest that the optimal conditions under which the highest antioxidant activity was achieved are: 57 °C, 53 MPa, and 1.8 h extraction time, which results in an IC 50 value of 0.081 mg/ml. The result suggests that the methodology used in this research is able to identify operating conditions which selectively extract lycopene compounds with higher bioactivity. 4 Conclusions The experimental design and approach enabled to establish the polynomial functions that describe the effects of operating temperature, operating pressure and extraction time on the lycopene yield from tomato pomace using ethanol-modified supercritical CO 2 as the extraction medium. In this study, the significant variables influencing lycopene yields were pressure and temperature, and the interaction between pressure, temperature and extraction time. A polynomial regression model was proposed which described the experimental results satisfactorily; and based on the proposed model, the optimum conditions for lycopene yield were found to be at 57 °C, 40 MPa, and 1.8 h. Under these conditions, the estimated lycopene yield was 28.64 mg from 100 g dried tomato pomace (giving a recovery of 93%). For the extract antioxidant activity, the analysis showed that the individual effects of pressure and extraction time, and the interaction between pressure and time were significant. The optimum conditions for antioxidant activity were found to be: 57 °C, 53 MPa, and 1.8 h. Under these conditions, the IC 50 value was 0.081 mg/ml. The research demonstrates that ethanol-modified supercritical CO 2 extraction results in high yields of lycopene with a high level of bioactivity, and it is a promising alternative to the use of traditional organic solvent extraction.

        "abstract": "Liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry (LC/ITMS) was employed for a metabolic kinetics study of tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) and its metabolites in rat serum after oral administration. The mean serum concentration-time data of TBHQ and its four metabolites (M1-M4) in both male and female rats after oral administration of TBHQ at dosages of 7, 350 and 700 mg/kg were all best-fitted by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption. TBHQ was rapidly absorbed, distributed and metabolized. The metabolites were also distributed rapidly except M2, but eliminated more slowly than TBHQ. At the doses of 350 and 700 mg/kg, the total concentrations of TBHQ and its metabolites in serum were much higher for male than female rats during the metabolic process (P < 0.01). In addition, the serum concentrations of M1, M3 and M4 were all much higher for males than for females (P < 0.01) during the metabolic process, while no significant differences between male and female rats were found (P > 0.05) for TBHQ and M2, at the doses of 350 and 700 mg/kg. The exploratory assessment of dose proportionality for TBHQ and its metabolites by the power model indicated that the TBHQ exposure increased in a more-than-dose-proportional manner, but the exposures of the metabolites M1-M4 increased in a less-than-dose-proportional manner, across the dose of 7-700 mg/kg.",

Under these optimal conditions, the extraction rate of isoflavone was 96.24%, which was very close to predicted value.

        "abstract": "Increased deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) is characteristic for normal aging and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-associated alterations of the central nervous system. In addition, both Abeta and HIV-1 are known to induce cellular oxidative stress and disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, we hypothesize that Abeta and HIV-1 protein Tat can potentiate their proinflammatory effects at the brain endothelium level. To address this hypothesis, we studied promoter activity of three proinflammatory genes in an in vitro BBB model of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) cocultured with a human astrocyte cell line producing Tat (SVGA-Tat cells) and exposed to Abeta. Treatment of HBMEC with Abeta(1-40) in the presence of SVGA-Tat cells resulted in a significant up-regulation of E-selectin, CC chemokine ligand-2, and interleukin-6 promoter activities and protein levels compared with the individual effects of Abeta or Tat. In addition, Abeta markedly amplified E-selectin promoter activity in HBMEC cocultured with HIV-1-infected Jurkat T cells. Simvastatin, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, effectively blocked proinflammatory reactions induced by Abeta in cocultures with SVGA-Tat cells or with HIV-1-infected Jurkat cells. The present study indicates that a combined exposure to Abeta and Tat or HIV-1 can synergistically potentiate the expression of inflammatory genes in brain endothelial cells. In addition, simvastatin may provide a beneficial influence by reducing these effects at the BBB level.",

        "abstract": "Circadian rhythms influence physiological processes from sleep–wake cycles to body temperature and are controlled by highly conserved cycling molecules. Although the mechanistic basis of the circadian clock has been known for decades, the extent to which circadian rhythms vary in nature and the underlying genetic basis for that variation is not well understood. We measured circadian period (Ʈ) and rhythmicity index in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and observed extensive genetic variation in both. Seven DGRP lines had sexually dimorphic arrhythmicity and one line had an exceptionally long Ʈ. Genome-wide analyses identified 584 polymorphisms in 268 genes. We observed differences among transcripts for nine genes predicted to interact among themselves and canonical clock genes in the long period line and a control. Mutations/RNAi knockdown targeting these genes also affected circadian behavior. Our observations reveal that complex genetic interactions influence high levels of variation in circadian phenotypes.",

        "title": "Separation of hyaluronic acid from fermentation broth by tangential flow microfiltration and ultrafiltration",
        "abstract": "This work examined the use of a two-stage tangential flow filtration process for the separation of hyaluronic acid from fermentation broth. Microfiltration (MF) membranes (0.45, 0.20 μm in pore diameter) and ultrafiltration (UF) membranes (MWCO 300, 100 kDa), made from polyvinylidene fluoride, were used to achieve the separation in series. Operating conditions of each stage were firstly optimized to give the best separation. Then, the two-stage membrane process was undertaken with two separating schemes: the first using MF followed by UF with pure water as diafiltrate, the second similar to the first except permeate from previous UF stage as diafiltrate for MF stage. The optimal conditions were transmembrane pressure 0.1 MPa, crossflow velocity 1.25 m/s, solution pH 4.0 and enhanced ionic strength 0.25 mol/l NaCl for MF membranes, and 0.15 MPa, 1.25 m/s, pH 7.0 and 0.1–0.25 mol/l NaCl for UF membranes, respectively. The two schemes could effectively separate and purify HA with above 77% overall yield and about 1000 purification factor. The second scheme seemed to be more effective for its higher overall yield (89%) and saving water. Keywords Microfiltration Ultrafiltration Tangential flow filtration Hyaluronic acid Fermentation broth 1 Introduction The downstream processing of cell cultures and the separation of extracellular biometabolites produced represents one of the main tasks of bioengineering. Tangential flow or crossflow filtration technique (TFF) has been demonstrated its feasibility of separating or removing cell debris (e.g. fungi [1] , rod-shaped bacteria [2,3] ), and recovering biosynthetic substances (e.g. xanthan gum [4] , antibiotics [5–8] ) after bacterial fermentation. In TFF, the bulk flows tangentially across the membrane and perpendicularly to the permeation flux. Its filtrating performance depends on the properties of the membrane, product and the operational conditions (transmembrane pressure, crossflow velocity, solution chemistry, concentration factor, running time, etc.). Besides, TFF is usually considered to work effectively on the condition that the solutes differ by 10-fold in size. van Reis et al. [9] firstly created the conception high performance tangential flow filtration (HPTFF) to describe high resolution membrane processes which could achieve the separation of solutes that differ by less than 10-fold in size. Different strategies were taken by HPTFF, such as proper choice of pH and ionic strength (IS), use of electrically charged membranes and a diafiltration mode, operation in optimal hydrodynamic conditions to maximize the selectivity and control of membrane fouling [10] . van Reis et al. [9] used HPTFF to separate immunoglobulin G (IgG) from bovine serum albumin (BSA), obtaining 84% yield and 30-fold purification factor. Cheang and Zydney [10] described a two-stage ultrafiltration process for the purification of α-lactalbumin (α-LA) and β-lactoglobulin (β-LG) from whey protein isolate in two separating strategies, with more than 10-fold purification factor and above 85% yield of α-LA and more than four-fold purification factor and about 70% yield of β-LG. Therefore, HPTFF may improve the separation of solutes whether the differences of their molecular sizes are less than 10-fold or not. As one of natural polyelectrolytes, hyaluronic acid (HA) is a member of glycosaminoglycans and is constituted by alternating and repeating units of d -glucuronic acid and N -acetyl- d -glucosamine linked at 1, 3 and 1, 4 position to form a linear chain [11] . The distributions of the molecular size are of wide range (10 5 to 10 7 Da). HA is highly hydrophilic, and in aqueous solutions shows high viscoelastic behavior and water binding capacity due to the high molecular weight and the high number of charged groups. Physicochemical studies have demonstrated that HA molecules in solution, at a concentration as low as 1 g/l, form a three-dimensional network stabilized by interchain interactions [12] . The application of HA will be easily found in cosmetics such as skin creams, cleansers, and facial aesthetics [13] . Recent biomedical applications of HA include ophthalmic surgery, arthritis treatment, wound healing, embryonic development, tissue regeneration, tumorigenesis, etc. [11,14] . HA is usually prepared by fermentation with microorganisms belonging to Streptococcus zooepidemicus [15–18] . The separation and purification of HA involves the precipitation of HA from fermentation broth by repeatedly using large amounts of organic solvents such as ethanol, acetone, isopropanol, CPC, etc. [19,20] . However, the process is complicated and time-consuming, which leads to high cost. Moreover, the use of organic solvents or other added substances will potentially contaminate environment and do harm to the qualities of HA. Although membrane technology was used in some purifying processes [21,22] , it was just to concentrate HA solution or to remove small soluble molecules. Therefore, further processes were needed. So far, membrane processes as key technologies to separate and purify HA from fermentation broth has been rarely reported, especially the operating parameters of the processes. In the present study, the separation of HA from fermentation broth will be carried out by a two-stage tangential flow microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) process based on the conception of HPTFF. The process will also be evaluated according to the yield and purification factor of HA, process time and pure water diafiltrate needed. Operating conditions for each stage are firstly optimized to give the best separation in a total recirculation mode. Then, two separating schemes consisting of two diafiltration steps will be tested to separate HA from fermentation broth, and also compared and evaluated. 2 Theory Conventionally, the separation efficiency has been studied by calculating the ratio of permeation factors, which is termed as selectivity and is defined as (1) S i / j = P i P j (2) P = C p C R where S is the selectivity, P the permeation factor of solute i (or j ) in the feed (retentate), C R and C p are the concentration of solute in the feed and the permeate, respectively. Membrane system used in the experimental tests can be modeled as a CSTR [23] . In the continuous diafiltration, the mass balance for a solute in the feed gives the following equations. In the case of pure water as diafiltrate to hold the volume of feed unchangeable, the solute concentration in the feed: (3) C R = C 0 e − P V D and in the permeate: (4) C P = P C 0 e − P V D where C 0 is the initial solute concentration in the solution to be treated, V D is the number of diavolume. As far as washing with a solution containing the solute at concentration C add is concerned, the equations for C R and C p are given as follows [23] : (5) C R = 1 P [ C add − ( C add − C 0 P ) e − P V D ] (6) C P = C add − ( C add − C 0 P ) e − P V D The primary goals of multiple-solute separations are to achieve a desired yield of the solute as well as an acceptable level of purification from one or several impurities. The yield of desired solute is simply equal to the ratio of the mass of recovered solute to the initial mass in the solution to be treated. If the desired solute is in the permeate for MF stage (represented by subscript “1”), then the yield of the solute is defined as follows. In the case of washing with pure water, the yield [24] is (7) Y 1 = 1 − e ( − P 1 V D .1 ) As for washing with a solution containing the solute at concentration C add , the yield can be expressed, using Eq. (5) and the overall mass balance of the solute for the diafiltration process: (8) V 0.1 C 0.1 + V D .1 V 0.1 C add = V 0.1 C R .1 + V p .1 C ¯ p .1 where V 0 is the initial volume of the solution to be treated, V p the cumulative volume of the permeate at the end of diafiltration, and C ¯ p is the average concentration of the solute in the cumulative permeate at the end of diafiltration. The yield is: (9) Y 1 = 1 − e − P 1 V D .1 + C add C 0.1 V D .1 − 1 P 1 ( 1 − e − P 1 V D .1 ) In UF stage (represented by subscript “2”), the desired solute is in the feed, and only washing with pure water is taken into consideration. Therefore, the yield at the stage can be defined as [24] : (10) Y 2 = e ( − P 2 V D .2 ) The overall yield of the desired solute for the two-stage MF and UF membrane process in this work can be defined as (11) Y = Y 1 Y 2 Substituting Eq. (7) or Eq. (9) , and Eq. (10) in Eq. (11) gives: (12) Y = [ 1 − e ( − P 1 V D .1 ) ] e ( − P 2 V D .2 ) (13) Y = 1 − e − P 1 V D .1 + C add C 0.1 V D .1 − 1 P 1 ( 1 − e − P 1 V D .1 ) e ( − P 2 V D .2 ) One point to note is that a small loss of the solute in the pre-concentration (if needed) is not taken into account for the calculation of Y while the loss does exist in the process. The overall purification factor for the two-stage membrane processes is termed as the ratio of the mass of recovered solute in the final product solution to the initial mass in the solution to be treated divided by the sum of the same ratio of all impurities: (14) β i = V f C ¯ f . i V 0 C 0. i ∑ j ≠ i V f C ¯ f . j V 0 C 0. j = Y i ∑ j ≠ i Y j where β is the purification factor, V f the volume of the final product solution, and C ¯ f is the average concentration of the solute in the final product solution. Eq. (14) accounts for the presence of all the possible impurities in the final product solution. Thus, cell bodies and proteins are considered as impurities for the calculation of HA purification factor. In addition, Eq. (14) can be used to calculate the purification factor of the desired solute in every stage with the solute yield in the stage. 3 Materials and methods 3.1 Fermentation The microorganism used for the production of HA was a strain of S. zooepidemicus (supplied by China agricultural science research center) numbered 05-02-552 in our laboratory. Fermentation medium comprised (g/l deionized water unless otherwise stated): glucose 60.0, yeast extract 12.0, peptone 15.0, NaCl 2.0, MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O 1.0, K 2 HPO 4 1.5. All medium solutes were analytical grade and dissolved in deionized water. Glucose, yeast extract, peptone and salt solutions were autoclaved separately. The microorganisms were cultured for about 18 h in two 250-ml conical flasks (100 ml culture volume) to develop the inocula before fermentation. The makeup of the culture in the flasks was same to the fermentation medium expect that glucose was 2 g/l. Then, the inocula were added to the fermentation medium at 10% v/v. Fermented broths were produced in a 5-l BioTECH-5BG fermentor (Baoxin Biological Equipment Co. Ltd. Shanghai, China) using a working volume of 2 l. Fermentations were carried out for about 30 h and in the following conditions: pH 7.0–7.2, temperature 37 °C, air supply 2 l/min, agitation 200–300 r/min. All these conditions were under the automatic control. 3.2 Membrane filtration system A flat-plate membrane module with four channels was used in this study. Each channel was 13 cm, 0.8 cm and 2.5 mm of length, width and thickness respectively, 9.5 mm of inner hydraulic diameter and a filtering area of 10.4 cm 2 . Four types of Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) MF and UF membranes available commercially were used: membranes with 0.45 and 0.20 μm in pore size(supplied by Beihua Liming Co. Ltd., China), and PVDF300 (MWCO 300 kDa) and PVDF100 (MWCO 100 kDa), supplied by Synder Filtration, USA. A new membrane was used to obtain reproducible result in each experiment. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the membrane filtration system. A magnetic gear pump (MG 213, Italy) was used to pump the broth from the 1.5-l feed tank to circulate (crossflow filtration) along the surface of the flat-plate membranes in the module. The applied pressure was controlled by ball valves 1, 3, and monitored with pressure gauges 4 and 5. Crossflow velocity was calculated from circulating retentate flow rate measurement with a rotor flowmeter 6. Pressures (inlet and outlet of membrane), retentate flow rate were monitored and adjusted to remain closer to the selected values whenever necessary. In the system, the permeate side of membrane was open to atmosphere, and thus the pressure of permeate side was equal to zero. Therefore, the transmembrane pressure (TMP) was defined as the average of pressures of inlet and outlet. In this study, the temperature was 25 ± 1 °C, and controlled by a heat exchanger 8. Permeate was collected for 30 s at different times and measured by a BS223S electronic balance (Sartorius, Germany; Accuracy 0.001 g) to calculate permeation flux. Samples were periodically taken for analysis. The system was cleaned by recirculating 0.1 mol/l NaOH solution for twice (each for 15 min) after each batch filtration. Then, the system was flushed by deionized water to ensure the system was restored its original performance. 3.3 Analytical methods Hyaluronic acid in the whole broth, the permeate and the feed was determined by the method of Bitter and Muir [25] , using glucuronolactone as a standard. Its contents in solution were calculated from the glucuronolactone value by multiplication by an experimental factor of 2.39 [26] . The sample was first centrifuged at 3000 r/min for 15 min to remove cell bodies (if needed). Two and a half fold volumes of absolute ethanol were added to 1 volume of the sample free of cell bodies and the solution was centrifuged at 3000 r/min for 15 min. The precipitate was recovered, redissolved in deionized water, and analyzed for the HA concentration. The weight-average molecular mass ( M w ) of HA was evaluated by intrinsic viscosity [27] . Mark–Houwink coefficients were k = 0.016 and a = 0.841 [28] . Sample was taken after 4 h recirculation of the broth with a constant crossflow velocity in the membrane filtration system. Absorbance measurement at 280 nm by SPECORD 200 (Analytik Jena AG, Germany) was used to detect protein content in samples. The sample was diluted in deionized water to an absorbance of less than 1 before measurement. The absorbance was then multiplied by the dilution factor. The bacterial concentration was obtained from dry cell weight, which was determined by centrifuging, washing the cells, centrifuging again and drying the cells at 105 °C to a constant weight. Shear stress and apparent viscosity were measured at shear rates 1–2000 s −1 by Rhesstress 300 (Thermo Haake, USA) to study the rheological characteristics of HA fermentation broth. The measurement was done at 25 °C. Although the broth contained other substances with small molecular size, some of them could totally pass through the membranes and the others had a similar permeation to that of proteins. Therefore, they were not taken into consideration in this study. 3.4 Experimental procedure In the first step, the membrane performances of filtrating HA fermentation broth were investigated to determine the optimal operating conditions for the good separation of HA, based on the conception of HPTFF. All the four types of membranes were used. The peristaltic pump 13 in the Fig. 1 was turned off, and the system ran in a total recirculation mode. Both the permeate and retentate were recycled back to the feed tank to maintain HA concentration constant. In the second step, a two-stage membrane process for separation of HA from fermentation broth was carried out with 0.45 μm and PVDF100 membranes in a continuous diafiltration mode, using the optimal conditions. The feed tank was supplied with the 300 ml broth. The system initially ran in a total recirculation mode for about 90 min to be stabilized. Then, the peristaltic pump 13 was turned on, and the diafiltrate was continuously added to the feed tank at a rate equal to the permeate flow rate to keep the solution volume constant. Two separating schemes were tested. The first scheme was MF followed by UF. Pure water was used as diafiltrate in the two stages. The total permeate collected from the MF stage was used as a feed of the second diafiltration after pre-concentration at a certain volume concentration ratio (VCR). The final HA product was recovered from the retentate of UF. The second scheme was similar to the first scheme expect that the collected permeate from previous UF stage was used as the diafiltrate for MF stage. 3.5 Calculation methods of experimental yield The yield of HA during the experiments was calculated using the following equations. In MF stage: (15) Y 1 = V p .1 C ¯ p .1 V 0.1 C 0.1 = V D .1 V 0.1 C ¯ p .1 V 0.1 C 0.1 in UF stage: (16) Y 2 = = V 0.2 C R .2 V 0.2 C 0.2 and for the overall yield of HA: (17) Y = V f C ¯ f V 0 C 0 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Membrane performances of filtrating HA fermentation broth Under certain operating conditions, permeation fluxes of all MF and UF membranes used declined rather quickly during the first minutes, and appeared to reach an apparent steady state after 90 min of operation. Fluxes were considered as stabilized after 120 min in the experiments realized. Thus, all the experimental data reported here were obtained after fluxes were stabilized. 4.1.1 Hydrodynamic conditions In this section, all MF and UF membranes were tested in similar solution chemistry, i.e. pH was equal to 7.0, and no additive was used to regulate IS of the broth. 4.1.1.1 Influences of transmembrane pressure (TMP) on selectivity TMPs adopted in the experiments were in the range of 0.05–0.2 MPa. Cell bodies could be completely retained by all the membranes used. HA permeation factor ( P HA ) for MF membranes was about 60% at TMP 0.05 MPa, and declined gradually with increasing TMP. At TMP 0.2 MPa, it was below 45%. P HA for UF membranes also went down from about 15% to 5% with increasing TMP from 0.05 to 0.15 MPa. But it would go up to about 10% at TMP 0.2 MPa. Proteins permeation factors ( P pro ) for MF and UF membranes were about 80% and 70% at TMP 0.05 MPa, respectively. They went down with increasing TMP. At TMP 0.2 MPa, they reached about 66% and 56%, respectively. The reduction of P HA for MF membranes with increase in TMP was due to the increase in initial permeation fluxes. The larger initial permeation fluxes of MF membranes were, the more molecules with less than the pore sizes (especially proteins) in the broth would get into the insides of MF membrane pores and plug them, which led to actual pore sizes diminished to a lower level. For UF membranes, cell bodies and HA molecules were prone to aggregate on their surfaces and form deposit layer thanks to relatively smaller pore sizes. With increasing TMP, the deposit was compressed so that the less HA molecules could pass through the membrane. On the other hand, HA is a linear chain-like polyelectrolyte stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the glycosidic linked monomers [29] . At TMP 0.2 MPa, the hydrogen bonds may be destroyed, and HA molecule could be shrunk to one with a smaller volume. The diminished volume of HA would explain the increase of P HA at this TMP. The decrease of P pro for all the membranes with increasing TMP might be attributed to the effects of initial permeation fluxes and concentration polarization, and the gathering of retained proteins at the upstream surface of membranes and inside membranes. Fig. 2 shows the variations of selectivities of proteins relative to HA ( S pro/HA ) for all the membranes used with TMP. The selectivity of HA relative to cell bodies ( S HA/cell ) was not depicted since the permeation factor of cell bodies ( P cell ) for all membranes was zero. S pro/HA for all MF membranes was similarly lower in the range of TMPs while S pro/HA for UF membranes was rather higher at TMP 0.15 MPa, manifesting they could give a good separation between HA and proteins in this case. The data of permeation fluxes also showed that permeation fluxes of MF membranes remained unchangeable when TMP was above 0.1 MPa and that the largest fluxes of UF membranes were achieved at TMP 0.15 MPa. Therefore, the optimal TMP for MF and UF membranes were determined to be 0.1 MPa and 0.15 MPa, respectively. 4.1.1.2 Influences of the crossflow velocity The experiments on the rheological properties of the broth showed that it possessed shear-thinning characteristics. Its apparent viscosity decreased with increasing shear rate from 1 to 2000 s −1 . Therefore, permeation fluxes would be raised with increasing shear rate or crossflow velocity [4] . However, HA molecules with linear chains and high molecular weight could be degraded easily under the action of mechanical stress, e.g. higher shear rate. Fig. 3 shows the effects of crossflow velocity ( v ) on the HA weight-average molecular mass ( M w ) which is an important indicator of HA qualities. It declined remarkably when v was above 1.25 m/s. Thus, the crossflow velocity of 1.25 m/s was considered as optimal for the experiments. In Table 1 are listed the data of membrane performances of filtrating HA fermentation broth in the optimal hydrodynamic conditions. MF membranes could give a complete separation between cell bodies and HA as the selectivities of HA relative to cell bodies ( S HA/cell ) were infinite, and UF membranes could provide a good separation between HA and proteins ( S pro/HA = 7.9 or more). Therefore, a two-stage membrane process could be used to separate HA from fermentation broth. Cell bodies could be removed from the broth by MF in the first stage. Then, solutes with small molecular size such as proteins would be got rid of by UF in the following stage. Nevertheless, P HA for MF membranes was only about 50%, and P pro for UF membranes was less than 60%. As a result, the operating time and cost of the process would increase [24] . Therefore, a further study on the influences of solution chemistry on the membrane performances should be carried out to improve the P HA for MF membranes and P pro for UF membranes, respectively. 4.1.2 Influences of solution chemistry The initial pH of the broth was 7.0–7.2, its electric conductivity corresponded to that of about 0.1–0.15 mol/l NaCl solution, and the initial HA concentration was generally 1000 mg/l or more. Thus, the broths containing about 1000 mg/l of HA were used in the following experiments. The pH of the broth was regulated by 6 mol/l HCl and NaOH, and enhanced ionic strength (EIS) by NaCl. Typical experimental data for filtration of the broth under the different conditions of solution chemistry are shown in Table 2 . P cell was not listed in the table and the following sections of this paper as it was zero for all MF and UF membranes. In addition, only the experimental data of 0.45 μm and PVDF100 membranes are given in the table as two MF membranes and two UF membranes exhibited similar separating performances, respectively. P HA increased remarkably to above 77% when solution pH was equal to 4.0 or less with the ionic strength of the broth unchanged. The change was due to the nature of HA molecule at different pH. The carboxyl groups of glucoronic acids in the repeating units of HA molecule would be dissociated in the aqueous solution, conferring a polyanionic character to the molecule. In other words, there was a strong negative charge for every disaccharide unit. The intramolecular and intermolecular electrostatic interactions contributed to the formation of a big molecular volume in the solution. However, the intrinsic viscosity and the molecular radius decreased reversible due to the protonation of glucoronic acid groups at pH less than 5.0 [30] , which might lead to the higher permeation factors. In addition, P pro increased a lot at pH 4.0–5.0 since the pH might be equal or close to the isoelectric points of proteins, and changed the interactions of proteins with membranes and other solutes. The permeation fluxes were lowest in this case, showing severe membrane fouling. Increasing EIS could result in the rises of the permeation fluxes as well as the permeation factors of HA and proteins when EIS was in the range of 0–0.2 mol/l and pH at 7.0. Notwithstanding, they hardly increased, even declined a little at EIS above 0.2 mol/l. EIS can play two major roles. One is to screen the electrostatic interactions, and the other is to diminish the viscosity of the broth, which has a great effect on permeation flux. Under the influence of EIS, the chains of HA molecule were “shrunk” from an expanded to a more compressed shape as a result of suppressing repulsions in the polyelectrolyte chains [31] . The electrostatic repulsions of HA molecules with membranes were also weakened. Therefore, P HA increased. Larger EIS might reverse the nature of charges of HA molecule and membranes, and consequently increased the electrostatic interactions. As a result, the permeation factors might even decrease slightly, instead of increasing. It was also the case with proteins in the broth. The lowest apparent viscosity of the broth was at EIS 0.20 mol/l, and did not decline at EIS 0.25 mol/l, based on the measurements of the viscosities in different EIS. That could be used to explain the increasing permeation fluxes with increasing EIS till to 0.20 mol/l. It is interesting to note that the permeation fluxes and the permeation factors of HA and proteins were greatly enhanced at pH 4.0 and EIS 0.25 mol/l, compared with those at pH 7.0 and EIS 0. The combination of pH and EIS had a great effect on membrane performances. The larger P HA would be preferable although S HA/cell for MF membrane was infinite as P cell was equal to zero. Thus, the solution chemistry at pH 4.0 and EIS 0.20–0.25 mol/l NaCl was chosen for microfiltration of HA fermentation broth to remove cell bodies and allow HA to pass through more easily. As for UF membrane, S pro/HA was affected positively by EIS and negatively by the reduction of solution pH. The membrane provided the highest S pro/HA (about 17.5) at pH 7.0 and EIS 0.25 mol/l, and good selectivity at pH 7.0 and EIS 0.1–0.2 mol/l. Therefore, the solution chemistry at pH 7.0 and EIS 0.10–0.25 mol/l NaCl was chosen for ultrafiltration of HA fermentation broth to let proteins pass through UF membrane quickly and achieve a good separation between proteins and HA. 4.2 Separating HA from fermentation broth with the combination of MF and UF membranes In order to realize high degrees of yield and purification during HA separation, the continuous diafiltration mode was adopted to effectively recover more HA in MF stage and wash out more permeatable proteins through UF membrane. The diafiltrations of HA fermentation broth were conducted on the optimal operating conditions achieved in the above experiments, i.e. TMP 0.1 MPa, v 1.25 m/s, solution pH 4.0 and EIS 0.25 mol/l NaCl for MF stage, and 0.15 MPa, 1.25 m/s, pH 7.0 and 0.20 mol/l NaCl for UF stage, respectively. In the case of pure water as diafiltrate, the buffer solution, prepared from 0.03 mol/l NaH 2 PO 4 and 0.03 mol/l Na 2 HPO 4 , was used. The IS of the solution was close to that of the broth. EIS was regulated to 0.25 mol/l NaCl, and pH to 4.0 and 7.0 for MF and UF stages, respectively. For the calculations using the equations in Section 2 , the following P HA and P pro were adopted according to Table 2 : P HA = 85.0%, P pro = 83% in MF stage, and P HA = 5.0%, P pro = 75.0% in UF stage. 4.2.1 Scheme 1: MF-UF (using pure water as diafiltrate) A series of experiments were firstly carried out to determine an optimal number of diavolume ( V D.1 ) in MF stage. It is shown in Fig. 4 that HA and proteins in the feed are continuously washed out with increasing V D.1 . The contents of HA and proteins declined quickly at the beginning of the diafiltration, to about 50% at V D.1 1.0, and then tended to reduce gradually. HA was recovered in the permeate solution, thus the yield of HA ( Y 1 ) started with zero and increased throughout the first diafiltration. P HA and P pro declined slightly in the course of the diafiltration. The averages of P HA and P pro were about 81% and 79%, respectively. That was caused by intensified membrane fouling due to a long-term diafiltration operation. Therefore, HA and proteins contents in the feed declined less than the values of prediction using Eq. (3) . Accordingly, HA yield in MF stage ( Y 1 ) was slightly lower than the calculating values using Eq. (7) . It reached more than 99% at V D.1 8. Its increment was barely perceptible when V D.1 was beyond 8. Thus, V D.1 equal to 8 was chosen in MF stage. The collected permeate obtained at the end of the first diafiltration ( V D.1 = 8) was used as the feed in the following UF stage. As HA concentration in the feed was lower (less than 150 mg/l), the feed was first pre-concentrated at a VCR by MWCO 60,000 membrane, according to the suggestions of Ng et al. [32] . Then, the second diafiltration began, and the permeate was discarded. Absorbance at 280 nm (Abs280) in the permeate was continuously monitored in the course of the diafiltration. When Abs280 in the permeate sample was less than 0.02 [33] , UF stage ended. Different VCRs adopted at pre-concentration would lead to different numbers of diavolume ( V D.2 ) at the end of this stage. For example, about 10-fold pure water was needed to wash out protein through UF membrane to satisfy the terminal condition when VCR reached 12. Some results of the stage (including pre-concentration) are listed in Table 3 . It can be seen that the total time, T 2 (sum of pre-concentration time, T c and diafiltration time, T d.2 ) needed in the stage was shortest at VCR 8. Although T c was shortest and the permeation flux in the second diafiltration was largest at VCR 4, they were outweighed by large volume of the diafiltration feed. Therefore, the total time was still highest. What is more, pure water needed as diafiltrate was most. One advantage at VCR 12 was that pure water needed as diafiltrate was least. However, T c was longest. In addition, the initial concentrations of HA and proteins in the second diafiltration were highest, which led to lowest permeation flux during diafiltration and biggest V D.2 at the end of the stage. Therefore, the time for diafiltration was still high, so was the total time. Another point should be noted that the yield of HA ( Y 2 ) declined with increasing VCR. The reason for it was that bigger VCR led to bigger V D.2 , which in turn led to more HA washed out with proteins in the diafiltration. That would cause the reduction in the yield since HA was recovered from the retentate in the second diafiltration. It seemed to more reasonable that the second diafiltration in UF stage began after pre-concentration at VCR 8 based on the results listed in Table 3 and analysis mentioned above. Y 2 was higher than the predictions using Eq. (10) for two reasons. One was that P HA declined gradually so that its average (about 3.5%) was below the level shown in Table 2 in the course of the second diafiltration due to long-term membrane fouling. The other was that HA with smaller molecular size was firstly washed out, and HA with larger molecular size left would reduce the permeation factor. The less P HA would result in less loss of HA in the retentate and consequently increased HA yield in the stage. The higher Y 2 crucially led to higher overall yield of HA ( Y ) as Y 1 was more than 99%. Thus, Y was also higher than the predictions using Eq. (12) . 4.2.2 Scheme 2: MF-UF (using permeate from UF as diafiltrate for MF) The second scheme was tested to improve the yield of HA and save pure water as diafiltrate in the above two-stage membrane process. The collected permeate solution from previous UF stage was used as the diafiltrate for MF stage of scheme 2. One volume of pure water was provided to further wash out HA from the retentate before the end of the first diafiltration. Then, began UF stage, including pre-concentration step and the second diafiltration, which was similar to that described in scheme 1. The permeate solution from previous UF stage contained 18.3 mg/l of HA and 1.356 of Abs280. Fig. 5 shows the variations of HA and proteins contents in the retentates and HA yield in the two stages with the numbers of diavolume. The contents of HA and Abs280 in the retentate went down rather quickly when the diafiltrate volume was less than six-fold initial volume of the feed in the first diafiltration ( Fig. 5 a). Then, they declined smoothly. At V D.1 9, the concentration of HA was about 20 mg/l. One volume of pure water was added at this time as it was impossible for HA concentration to be lowered to the concentration in the diafiltrate from previous UF stage. Then, it was lowered abruptly. It declined very slowly while the contents of proteins in the retentate went down rapidly in the latter period of the second diafiltration, indicating the increase in S pro/HA due to reduction of P HA for UF membrane ( Fig. 5 b). The yield of HA reached 117% at the end of MF stage thanks to recovery of HA from the permeate solution of previous UF stage. Thus, the overall yield in the process increased to 89%, compared with that in scheme 1. Besides, the process only needed 10.5-fold volumes of pure water as diafiltrate. 4.2.3 Comparisons of two schemes tested Main results of separating HA with the two schemes tested are listed in Table 4 . It should be noted that the total process time, T was the sum of the times needed in two stages, including the time needed for pre-concentration (VCR = 8). The purification factors of HA ( β ) were calculated using Eq. (14) , in terms of experimental measurements of solute contents in the initial feed and final product solution. In this work, only cell bodies and proteins were considered as impurities in HA solution. The two schemes could effectively separate HA from the fermentation broth, and the purification factors were about 1000, which showed the product had a high purity. Scheme 2 greatly improved the yield of HA (to 89%), and saved much pure water needed as diafiltrate ( V D = 10.5). One disadvantage was that it had the longer total process time. However, a much bigger membrane filtering area is usually used in the practical application of membrane process, which will shorten the process time to a large degree. Therefore, scheme 2 seemed to be more effective for the practical use. 5 Conclusions The combination of MF with UF membranes could effectively separate HA from fermentation broth on the given optimized operating conditions. MF membranes with pore size 0.2–0.45 μm could be used to remove cell bodies, and UF membranes with MWCO 100–300 kDa to retain HA but allow protein impurities to pass through. The optimal operating conditions in this work were TMP 0.1 MPa, v 1.25 m/s, solution pH 4.0 and EIS 0.25 mol/l NaCl for MF membranes, and 0.15 MPa, 1.25 m/s, pH 7.0 and 0.10–0.25 mol/l NaCl for UF membranes respectively. The process, with two different separating schemes, could achieve above 77% overall yield and about 1000 purification factor of HA. Using the permeate from the previous UF stage as diafiltrate for MF stage seemed to be more effective as could improve the overall yield of HA (to 89%) and save pure water. The tangential flow filtration system used in the experiments can be easily scaled, using properly designed membrane system [34] . Therefore, a similar level of separation of HA would be achieved at large scale. References [1] D.M. Krstić S.L. Markov M.N.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Corilagin, a gallotannin, is one of the major active components of many ethnopharmacological plants. It was isolated from  Caesalpinia coriaria  (Jacq.) Willd. (dividivi) by Schmidt in 1951 for the first time. In the past few decades, corilagin was reported to exhibit anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective activities,  etc . However, little attention was paid to its pharmacological properties due to the complicated and inefficient extract method. In recent years, with the development of extraction technology corilagin was much easier to obtain than before. Thus, people return to pay attention to its anti-tumor, hepatoprotective, and anti-inflammatory activities, particularly as an anti-tumor agent candidate. Our research team had focused on the distribution, preparation and anti-tumor activity of corilagin since 2005. We found corilagin showed good anti-tumor activity on hepatocellular carcinoma and ovarian cancer. What’s more, corilagin showed a low level of toxicity toward normal cells and tissues. Due to the extensive attention that corilagin has received, we present a systematic review of the pharmacological effects of corilagin. In this review, we summarized all the pharmacological effects of corilagin with a focus on the molecular mechanism of anti-tumor activity and show you how corilagin affected the signaling pathways of tumor cells as well as its physicochemical properties, distribution and preparation methods.",

Several analytical methods were used to determine the structural characteristics, crystalline behavior, morphological properties, thermal properties, and water/oil binding capacity of PP-C and PP-MCC. Fourier-transform infrared spectra and morphological analysis showed that the alkaline hydrogen peroxide treatment and acid hydrolysis successfully removed hemicellulose and lignin from pomelo peel fibers. Both PP-C and PP-MCC had only a cellulose I polymorph structure, and the crystallinity index of PP-MCC increased compared with that of PP-C. The degradation temperatures of PP-C and PP-MCC were approximately 257 °C and 280 °C, respectively. The water/oil binding capacity of PP-MCC was significantly higher than that of the commercial MCC. Our results thus suggested that PP-MCC might be suitable for use as a food stabilizer and pharmaceutical additive.",

This method contained of excluding starch from raw material and bioconverting the saponins in the residue by Trichoderma reesei. Compared to acid hydrolysis, 98.7% of diosgenin could be extracted from plant tubers through the new process, with 98.0% of starch recovered in the form of sugar. Consequently, 99.4% of COD, 100% of SO 4 2- and 100% of acid were reduced in processing wastewater. In addition, acid hydrolysis by-products were greatly limited, e.g. two priority pollutants [Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and Di-n-butyl phthalate], which are specified by United States Environmental Protection Agency, typically detected in Dioscorea zingiberensis wastewater from conventional acid hydrolysis process, disappeared automatically in the proposed cleaner process. © 2010 Peking University.",

        "abstract": "Food consumption is an essential component of animal fitness; however, excessive food intake in humans increases risk for many diseases. The roles of neuroendocrine feedback loops, food sensing modalities, and physiological state in regulating food intake are well understood, but not the genetic basis underlying variation in food consumption. Here, we applied ten generations of artificial selection for high and low food consumption in replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The phenotypic response to selection was highly asymmetric, with significant responses only for increased food consumption and minimal correlated responses in body mass and composition. We assessed the molecular correlates of selection responses by DNA and RNA sequencing of the selection lines. The high and low selection lines had variants with significantly divergent allele frequencies within or near 2081 genes and 3526 differentially expressed genes in one or both sexes. A total of 519 genes were both genetically divergent and differentially expressed between the divergent selection lines. We performed functional analyses of the effects of RNAi suppression of gene expression and induced mutations for 27 of these candidate genes that have human orthologs and the strongest statistical support, and confirmed that 25 (93 %) affected the mean and/or variance of food consumption.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effectiveness of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells transplantation on lower limb chronic venous ulcer.Between May 2009 and September 2010, 17 patients with lower limb chronic venous ulcer were treated with autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells transplantation (transplantation group) and 10 patients treated without cells transplantation served as control group. In the transplantation group, there were 9 males and 8 females with age of (33.3 +/- 6.1) years, including 11 cases of simple great saphenous vein varicosity and 6 cases of chronic venous insufficiency; the area of ulcer was (4.39 +/- 2.46) cm2; and the duration of ulcer ranged from 3 months to 6 years. In the control group, there were 4 males and 6 females with age of (39.2 +/- 10.3) years, including 7 cases of simple great saphenous vein varicosity and 3 cases of chronic venous insufficiency; and the area of ulcer was (5.51 +/- 2.63) cm2; and the duration of ulcer ranged from 3 months to 2 years. All patients in both groups were classified as C6 according to clinical etiology anatomy pathophysiology (CEAP) classification. No significant difference was found in the general data between 2 groups (P > 0.05). The healing process of ulcer was observed. The granulation tissue was harvested for HE staining before operation and at 3 days after operation in the transplantation group. The microvessel density (MVD) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression of ulcer granulation tissue were observed.In the transplantation group, ulcer healing was accelerated; complete healing was observed in 15 cases, partial healing in 1 case, and no healing in 1 case with the median healing time of 22 days. However, in the control group, the healing process was slower; complete healing of ulcer was observed in 7 cases and no healing in 3 cases with the median healing time of 57.5 days. There was significant difference in the healing time between 2 groups (Z = 0.001 4, P = 0.0027). HE staining showed a great number of microvessels in the granulation tissue in the transplantation group. The immunohistochemical staining showed that MVD was significantly increased (t = 3.120, P = 0.008) after cell transplantation (32.1 +/- 12.8) when compared with that before transplantation (22.1 +/- 6.7). The VEGF expression after transplantation (8.05% +/- 5.10%) was increased slightly when compared with that before transplantation (6.13% +/- 4.20%), but the difference was not significant (t = 1.150, P = 0.268).Autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells transplantation can stimulate granulation tissue growth and improve ulcer healing.",

        "abstract": "Hyperlipidemia is a major cause of atherosclerosis and atherosclerosis-associated conditions in cardiovascular diseases. Oxidative stress, as a main risk factor causes vascular endothelial cell apoptosis, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disorders. Diosgenin, an aglycone of steroidal saponins, has been reported to exert anti-proliferative and proapoptotic actions on cancer cells widely. In this study, we propose that diosgenin can protect the hyperlipidemic rats and prevent endothelial apoptosis under oxidative stress. We investigated the hypolipidemic and antioxidative effects of diosgenin on rats fed with high cholesterol and high fat diet for 6 weeks. Serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), hepaticlipase (HL) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were evaluated. Then we explored the effects and mechanism of diosgenin against hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis of human vein endothelium cells (HUVECs). Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), nitric oxide (NO), DNA fragment formation and mitochondrial membrane potentials (DeltaPsim) were determined. Diosgenin treatment increased LPL, HL, SOD, GSH-PX and NOS activities, thus attenuated oxygen free radicals, decreased MDA, TC, TG and LDL-C levels in hyperlipidemic rats. Diosgenin pretreatment significantly attenuated H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis in HUVECs, intracellular ROS, GSH depletion, DNA fragment formation, and restored NO, DeltaPsim. These results suggested that diosgenin is a very useful compound to control hyperlipidemia by both improving the lipid profile and modulating oxidative stress and prevent H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis of HUVECs, in partly through regulating mitochondrial dysfunction pathway.",

However, compound K is not present in raw and unprocessed ginseng. Some PPDs have the same structure with gypenosides, and could be obtained from Gynostemma pentaphyllum. The enzymolysis of PPD-type gypenosides of G. pentaphyllum by naringinase has been reported for the first time in this research. In addition, isolation and identification of enzymolysis end product, and the optimization of enzymolysis parameters were investigated. The results showed that compound K was produced from the enzymolysis of PPD-type gypenosides by naringinase, and could be isolated and purificated by HP-20 macroporous resin and C-18 column chromatography. The optimum enzymolysis conditions determined by the response surface methodology (RSM) are pH 4.1, 50 °C, and 71 h, with a yield of 65.44 ± 4.52% for compound K. These results demonstrated that enzymolysis could be a promising method for producing compound K from the biotransformation of PPD-type gypenosides of G. pentaphyllum.",

        "abstract": "A high quality solution structure of the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitory N-terminal domain of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (N-TIMP-1) has been determined. For the rigidly packed residues, the average RMSD to the mean structure is 0. 57 A for the backbone atoms and 1.00 A for all heavy atoms. Comparison of the solution structure of free N-TIMP-1 with the crystal structure of TIMP-1 bound to the catalytic domain of MMP-3 ( Gomis-R]uth et al., 1997 ) shows that the structural core of the beta barrel flanked by helices is nearly unchanged by the association with MMP-3, evident from a backbone RMSD of 1.15 A. However, clear differences in the conformation of the MMP-binding ridge of free and MMP-bound TIMP-1 suggest induced fit throughout the ridge. The MMP-dependent conformational changes in the ridge include a dramatic bending of AB loop residues Glu28 through Leu34, moderate hinge bending of the CD-loop about residues Ala65 and Cys70, and modest bending of the Cys1 through Pro6 segment. A large number of interresidue Nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs) augmented by stereospecific assignments, torsion restraints, and dipolar couplings (an average of 18 non-trivial restraints per residue) engender confidence in these structural inferences. A tight cluster of three lysine residues and one arginine residue atop beta-strands A and B, and identical among TIMP sequences, form the heart of a highly conserved electropositive patch that may interact with anionic components of the extracellular matrix.",

Methods We studied 3 consecutive HD sessions in 36 stable maintained HD (MHD) patients (totally 108 dialysis sessions), and divided the patients into 2 groups: diabetic group and non-diabetic group. Blood pressures before and after dialysis were compared between the two groups. HD-related hypotension was also analyzed. Results The ratio of patients with the blood pressure reached to the target of K/DOQI was 26.7% (pre-dialysis) and 57.8% (post-dialysis) in diabetic patients, and was 28.6% (predialysis) and 55.6% (post-dialysis) in non-diabetic patients, without significant differences between the two groups. The number of patients taking anti-hypertensive medicines and the kinds of a tensive medicines administered were more in diabetic group than in diabetic group (P < 0.05). In patients before dialysis, the average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) were 163+29mmHg and 83+25mmHg, respectively, in diabetic group, higher than those in non-diabetic group (153+23mmHg and 70+22mmHg, respectively; P<0.05). However, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) had no significant differences between the two groups. In patients after dialysis, SBP and PP showed no significant differences between the two groups, and DBP was lower in diabetic group than in non-diabetic group (70+14mmHg and 80+15mmHg, respectively; P < 0.05). In diabetic group after dialysis, SBP and DBP decreased by 37+38mmHg and 10+17mmHg, respectively, as compared with the values before dialysis. In non-diabetic group after dialysis, the decrease of SBP and DBP were less (19+29mmHg and 3+16mmHg, respectively; P < 0.05). In diabetic group, patients with dialysis-related hypotension and symptomatic hypotension were 62.2% and 31.1%, respectively, higher than those in non-diabetic patients (41.3% and 7.9%, respectively; P < 0.05). Multiple regression analysis indicated that diabetes and higher ultrafiltration volume were the risk factors for HD-related hypotension. Conclusion The ratio of patients with the blood pressure reached to the target of K/DOQI was very low in this study. Patients with diabetes had hypertension more difficult to control and a higher PP. These patients also showed wider change of blood pressure during HD, and were prone to HD-related hypotension.",

        "abstract": "Objective To access the prevalence of peripheral arteriosclerosis disease(PAD) in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis(CGN) by measuring the ankle-brachial index(ABI).Methods A total of 147 CGN patients were divided into the PAD group and the non-PAD group according to ABI values(criterion for PAD diagnosis:ABI≤0.9).Examinations of electrocardiograms,blood biochemistry,amount of 24-hour urine protein and blood routine were carried out in both groups.Results PAD was noted in 25 out of the 147 patients(17.0%).Incidence rates of myocardial ischemia,myocardial infarction,stroke,and vascular claudication were significantly different between the two groups(P<0.01).No significant difference existed in age,body mass index,hemoglobin,serum albumin levels,total cholesterol,high-density lipoprotein cholesterol,low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,uric acid,serum calcium levels and serum phosphorous levels between the two groups(P>0.05).Systolic blood pressure,diastolic pressure,triglyceride,blood sugar,blood urea nitrogen,serum creatinine,and amount of 24-hour urine protein were significantly different between the two groups(P<0.05).Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that ABI was positively and independently correlated with systolic blood pressure(B=0.045,P<0.05),serum creatinine(B=0.063,P<0.05),and amount of 24-hour urine protein(B=0.481,P<0.05).Conclusion PAD incidence rate is high among CGN patients.CGN patients with PAD are at higher risk of coronary artery and cerebrovascular diseases.For PAD detection,ABI may be useful in predicting the risk of coronary artery and cerebrovascular diseases in patients with CGN.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the anti-fatigue effects of amino acids and vitamins on rats after exhaustive exercise. In addition, the current research might provide a theoretical foundation for the future development of new anti-fatigue nutritional supplements. Methods Thirty-six male SD rats were randomly divided into three groups after adaptive swimming. Each group consisted of 12 rats, namely amino acids and vitamins capsule group (capsule group), control with bland water group (control group), and amino acid and fructose beverage group (granules group). Exhaustion was produced by non-load swimming. After 14 days of feeding with different beverages, the exhaustion time of swimming was recorded, and then all rats were killed to measure concentrations of muscle and hepatic glycogen, and contents of serum β-endorphin (β-EP), lactic acid (LA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK). Results The swimming time and the levels of the muscle and hepatic glycogen in the capsule and granules groups were longer or higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). The serum contents of β-EP, LDH and CK in the aforementioned two groups were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05), whereas the blood lactate levels showed no significant difference between the groups (P>0.05). Conclusion Compound amino acids and vitamins can delay the occurrence of exhaustion after swimming in rats, increase hepatic and muscle glycogen contents, and decrease the generation of various metabolites during fatigue exercises, and hence giving anti-fatigue effects.",

        "abstract": "Two fungal strains, effective in converting valonea (Quercus aegilops) tannins into ellagic acid (EA), were isolated from soil contaminated by valonea tannins, and were tentatively identified as Aspergillus niger and Candida utilis. Properties of EA accumulation by the two isolates from valonea tannins' fermentation were studied. Both the strains preferred sucrose to glucose as the additional carbon and energy source. The most suitable concentrations of valonea tannins in fermentation media for EA accumulation by A niger and C utilis were 5.0 and 9.0 g dm-3 with EA yields of 12.1 and 8.9% (w/w), respectively. The optimal temperature for the two strains was 28 °C, while the preferred pH values of the fermentation media were 4.5-5.0 for A niger and 4.8-5.2 for C utilis. The tannin tolerances of A niger and C utilis were adapted to 20 and 25 g dm-3 by gradually increasing the concentrations of valonea tannins in the culture media. The adapted strain of A niger was able to completely degrade 20 g dm-3 valonea tannins with an EA yield of 14.3% in 9 days. Meanwhile, the adapted strain of C utilis decreased the valonea tannins' level from 25 to 9.1 g dm-3 with an EA yield of 11.48%. The degradation ability of A niger came from tannase whose activity in the medium was 63 U cm-3 at the ninth day of fermentation, and that of C utilis was due to both tannase and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) whose activities were 32 U cm-3 and 29 U cm-3 at the ninth day. The coculture of both the adapted strains could completely degrade 25 g dm-3 valonea tannins in only 7 days with a remarkably increased EA yield (21%). The activities of tannase and PPO of the coculture at the seventh day were 66 U cm-3 and 47 U cm-3 respectively, which proved the synergistic effect of the two enzymes on valonea tannins' degradation and EA accumulation. © 2005 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Highly confined plasmon waves are efficiently excited through a periodic array of monolayer graphene ribbons in which plasmon resonance has remarkably large oscillator strength, resulting in a sharp optical absorption peak in the normal-incidence transmission spectrum. A significant amount of electron-hole pairs are produced in graphene ribbons by optical absorption, separated by the built-in electric field across the graphene/MoS2 heterojunction. The responsivity reaches up to 1 × 107 A W-1 at room temperature due to very strong resonance in the heterostructure, yielding a highly sensitive graphene-based photodetector. Additionally, the absorption can be tuned over a wide spectral range (6-16 μm) by varying gate biasing. The ultra-sensitive, spectrally tunable photodetector could be potentially used as a promising candidate for mid-infrared micro-spectrometers.",

In this study, emodin was labeled with 131I-NaI, catalyzed by N-bromosuccinimide(NBS), with 96% of radiolabeling efficiency and over 95% of radiochemical purity. Meanwhile, the 2-[131I]-emodin was stable in the serum of rats during 24h. The pharmacokinetic profiles of rats after i. v. administrations, estimated by one-compartment model, revealed the half-life time(t1/2) was 15min and clearance(CL) was 0.007L/(h��kg). The tissue distribution of mice indicated the highest amount of 131I-labeled emodin was found in lung, followed by kidney, and the lowest was found in brain. Similar amount was shown in other tissues. The research results indicated that 131I-labeled emodin was rapidly distributed and eliminated in the body, predominantly cleared through renal excretion, and hardly cross the blood brain barrier.",

Ellagitannins concentration, incubation time were\n identified as important physicochemical parameters influencing the enzyme synthesis and the production accumulation, and the\n substrate concentration with initial pH was determined to has an interactive effect on the enzyme synthesis, while ellagitannins\n concentration and initial pH with incubation time were found to have interactions on the production accumulation. Furthermore,\n the parameters were optimized by quadratic programming. Under optimum condition, the fermentation run lasted 84 h with 4 g L−1 ellagitannins concentration, yielding 17.7% ellagic acid. However, the maximum enzyme activity was obtained in 96 h with 5 g L−1 substrate concentration. The research demonstrated a possible way to develop an efficient approach for recovery of higher\n added-value product (ellagic acid) from forestry byproduct (acorn fringe of oak).",

        "abstract": "Kinetic characteristics of valonia tannin biodegradation using natural microorganism groups were studied. Kinetic equation followed by biodegradation process of valonia tannin was obtained. It was found that temperature is the key factor influencing degradation rate of valonia tannin; rise of temperature within 10-35°C range leads to the increase of biodegradation rate, while the lag phase of degradation is shortened. Optimal temperature for degradation is 28-32°C. The effect of tannin concentration on the lag phase of biodegradation is significant at lower temperature, but negligible at temperature higher than 28°C.",

Methods Activity of tumor cell was determined by MTT and cell cycle phase was analysised by flow cytometry. Results MTT test showed that curcumin was cytotoxic to cells. The proliferative inhibition rate of 30μM and 60μM of curcumin were 45.9 % and 78.1 % , respectively. 10μM of curcumin were less effective. Cellular morphology with HE stainning showed that the ratio of cells at mitosis phase was increased 24 hours after treatment with curcumin, The rates of mitosis of cells were up to 8-10%. FCM showed that PANC-1 cells treated with curcumin were accumulated at S, G2/M phase in the cell cycle, the rate of cells at G0/1 phase was decreased 24 hours after treatment with curcumin. The ratio of cells in G2/M phase was decreased which might be in part due to apoptosis of cells at G2/M phase.48 hours after treatment with curcumin. Conclusions Curcumin cand inhibit the growth of PANC -1 cells in vitro and its mechanisms of action was inferred to arrest the cellular cycle at S and G2/M phase , which prevented cells from entering the next cell cycle.",

Methods After adaptive swimming, 36 male SD rats were randomly divided into three groups, namely, capsule, control, and granules, with 12 rats in each group. Rats in 3 groups were given respectively amino acids capsule (8 kinds of essential amino acids and 11 kinds of vitamins were contained), normal drinking water, or amino acid-fructose beverage (2.5ml/100g, 2 times per day by gavage for 14 days). Exhaustion of rats was produced by non-loading swimming. The duration of the experiment lasted 14 days. After the last exhaustive swimming, the hypothalamus of the rats was removed for the observation of its ultrastructure under electron microscope. The contents of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5- HIAA), hydroxyphenyl acetic acid (HOPAC), and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the hypothalamus were measured with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-ECD). Results The mitochondrial structure in the brain cells of the capsule and granules groups were basically intact. On the other hand, the cells in the control group swelled and degenerated. Different degrees of swelling could be seen in the mitochondria. In addition, obvious morphological changes of the ultrastructure were observed under electron microscopy. Dissolution and r upture of the mitochondrial membrane and cristae were noted, even with the whole mitochondria disrupted and vacuolated. The contents of 5-HT, 5-HTAA, HOPAC, and GABA in the hypothalamus of rats in the capsule and the granules groups were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). Conclusion Amino acids and vitamins compound can increase the resistance of the nerve center to fatigue by alleviating pathological changes of ultrastructure and changes in neurotransmitter levels of the hypothalamus.",

Different from the conventional structure, the proposed structure contains both horizontal and vertical active channels which contacted 3D tri-gate. This method, in fact, increases the equivalent channel width and therefore enhances the maximum drain current. And buried-channel technology is used to improve the breakdown characteristic of the proposed structure. Simulation results show that the maximum drain current and breakdown voltage of the proposed structure are 1591 mA/mm and 190 V, 274.4% and 126.7% larger than that of the conventional one, respectively. Due to the above two technologies, the simulated power density gets a significant enhancement, and the simulated value (18 W/mm) is 310.3% larger than that of the conventional one (5.8 W/mm).",

        "abstract": "Predicting complex phenotypes from genomic data is a fundamental aim of animal and plant breeding, where we wish to predict genetic merits of selection candidates; and of human genetics, where we wish to predict disease risk. While genomic prediction models work well with populations of related individuals and high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (e.g., livestock), comparable models perform poorly for populations of unrelated individuals and low LD (e.g., humans). We hypothesized that low prediction accuracies in the latter situation may occur when the genetics architecture of the trait departs from the infinitesimal and additive architecture assumed by most prediction models. We used simulated data for 10,000 lines based on sequence data from a population of unrelated, inbred Drosophila melanogaster lines to evaluate this hypothesis. We show that, even in very simplified scenarios meant as a stress test of the commonly used Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (G-BLUP) method, using all common variants yields low prediction accuracy regardless of the trait genetic architecture. However, prediction accuracy increases when predictions are informed by the genetic architecture inferred from mapping the top variants affecting main effects and interactions in the training data, provided there is sufficient power for mapping. When the true genetic architecture is largely or partially due to epistatic interactions, the additive model may not perform well, while models that account explicitly for interactions generally increase prediction accuracy. Our results indicate that accounting for genetic architecture can improve prediction accuracy for quantitative traits.",

Before reaching cell confluence, the purified MSCs were incubated with BrdU at different concentrations (5, 10, and 15 micromol/L) for different incubating time (3, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h) with 10 micromol/L BrdU, to identify the optimal BrdU concentration and incubating time for cell labeling. Immunohistochemistry was performed to calculate the labeling index (LI).Flow cytometry showed that MSCs expressed CD29 and CD44 but not CD11b or CD45. Incubation of the MSCs with BrdU at 10 micromol/L and for an optimal length of 48 h appeared to achieve the highest LI, both of which exceeded 98%, with the labeling identifiable in five consecutive passages.The continually passaged cells are MSCs, the incubation of which with 10 micromol/L BrdU for 48 h may achieve a LI over 98% without producing obvious cell damages. The results suggest that BrdU labeling provides a feasible means for a dynamic in vivo observation of the survival, growth and differentiation of the implanted MSCs.",

The furan-ose moiety adopts an N-type sugar puckering ( 3 T 4). The corresponding pseudo-rotation phase angle and maximum amplitude are P = 24.5 (2)° and τ m = 38.3 (2)°, respectively. In the solid state, one methanol mol-ecule acts as a bridge joining adjacent nucleoside mol-ecules head-to-head, leading to a pleated-ribbon supra-molecular structure, with the base moieties located in the centre of the ribbon and the sugar residues protruding to the outside of the layers, as in a DNA helix. The pleated-ribbon supra-molecular structure is tethered together into a two-dimensional infinite pleated-sheet structure through aromatic stacking between the nucleobase planes and the benzene rings of the benzoyl protecting groups on the 5′-OH group of furanose. © 2011 International Union of Crystallography.",

Methods We recruited 47 MHD patients with stable disease status in the Hemodialysis Center of Beijing Tongren Hospital. They were divided into diabetes group and non-diabetes group. Pre-dialytic and intradialytic mean blood pressure and BPV were compared between the two groups. Standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) were used for the evaluation of BPV. Results In diabetes group, pre-dialytic levels of plasma albumin and serum creatinine were 41.52 ± 3.84 g/L and 742.41 ± 199.58 μmol/L, respectively, significantly lower than those in non-diabetes group (44.02 ± 3.48 g/L and 1015.26 ± 278.04 μmol/L, respectively; P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in age, ratio of sex, hemoglobin, total calcium, inorganic phosphorus, ultrafiltration volume (UFV), UFV/ W, Kt/V, and anti-hypertensive treatment between the two groups (P > 0.05). In diabetes group, pre-dialytic mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), SBP-SD, SBP-CV and SBP were 162 ± 15mmHg, 15.39 ± 5.13 mmHg, (9.53 ± 3.14)% and 47 ± 15mmHg, respectively, significantly higher than those in non-diabetes group (150 ± 14mmHg, 11.35 ± 4.65mmHg, (7.53 ± 2.90)% and 35 ± 13mmHg, respectively; P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in pre-dialytic mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP), DBP-SD and DBP-CV between the two groups (P > 0.05). In diabetes group, intradialytic SBP-SD and SBP-CV were 19.07 ± 6.07mmHg and (13.25 ± 4.08) %, respectively, significantly higher than those in non-diabetes group (13.93 ± 3.56mmHg and (9.71 ± 2.65) %, respectively; P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in intradialytic mean SBP, mean DBP, DBP-SD and DBP-CV between the two groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion In MHD patients with diabetes, blood pressure control was relatively difficult, and pre-dialytic and intradialytic SBP variability were more extensive.",

The zinc-finger-containing transcription factors have been previously revealed to be involved in the regulation of the MAPK signaling pathways. Here, we have identified a novel human zinc-finger transcriptional repressor, ZNF325, that contains a RBaK-like RB-binding domain and 15 tandem repeated C2H2 type zinc fingers. Northern blot analysis indicates that a 2.7 kb transcript specific for ZNF325 is widely expressed in all tissues examined at adult stage and in most of the embryonic tissues. Overexpression of ZNF325 in COS-7 cells inhibits the transcriptional activities of AP-1 and SRE. The deletion and RNAi analysis indicate that the C2H2 zinc finger motifs represent the basal transcriptional repressive activity. These results indicate that the ZNF325 protein may act as a novel transcription repressor in MAPK signaling pathway to mediate cellular functions.",

        "abstract": "Apoptosis of human vein endothelium cell caused by reactive oxygen species is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Rutin, an active flavonoid compound, is well known to possess potent antioxidant properties against oxidative stress insults through undefined mechanism(s). In this study, we first investigated the possible protective effects of rutin against apoptosis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) induced by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and the associated signaling pathways. Decreased viability and increased apoptosis were observed in the HUVECs incubated with 200microM H(2)O(2) for 12h. By examining the effect of rutin on H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis in HUVECs, we found that rutin pretreatment significantly attenuated H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis in HUVECs. We next examined the signaling involved in rutin-mediated anti-apoptotic effects. It was found that rutin pretreatment attenuated excessive reactive oxygen species in HUVECs exposed to H(2)O(2). Rutin also prevented the increased DNA fragment formation and glutathione (GSH) depletion and inhibited the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potentials (DeltaPsim) that occurred in HUVECs exposed to H(2)O(2), which protected HUVECs against oxidative damage and the further mitochondrial membrane integrity impairment, leading to apoptosis. In conclusion, the results suggested that rutin (50microM) blocked apoptosis in HUVECs through decreasing reactive oxygen species, increasing GSH, restoring DeltaPsim and thus protecting DNA damage. Our research indicated that rutin protected the intracellular GSH antioxidant system and prevented H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis of HUVECs through regulating reactive oxygen species mediated mitochondrial dysfunction pathway.",

By applying this reaction as the key step, a multi-substituted furocoumarin can easily be synthesized in a one-pot procedure.

Methods: The pVITRO2-RhoB recombinant was constructed and transfected into A549 cells. Its expression and the inhibition effect to the A549 cells were observed, models. A549 lung carcinoma mice were treated with either RhoB or cisplatin or both agents together. And the change of tumor size, the survive time of mice, the apoptosis of tumor were also observed. Results: The pVITRO2-RhoB recombinant was constructed successfully. This recombinant could inhibit the growth and promote the apoptosis of A594 in vitro. Mice treated with RhoB or low-dose cisplatin treatment individually resulted in tumor inhibition to a certain extent. Mice treated with combination of RhoB and low-dose cisplatin resulted in synergistic antitumor activity with more effective tumor inhibition (P<0. 05) and longer survival (P<0. 05). TUNEL analysis of tumors exhibited that RhoB in combination with cisplatin led to the increased rate of apoptosis (P<0. 05). Conclsuion: Our data demonstrated that RhoB could increase the sensitivity of lung carcinoma to cisplatin, resulting in enhanced antitumor activity. These results suggest that combination with recombinant human RhoB with chemotherapy drugs may be an effective approach in the treatment of lung carcinoma.",

        "abstract": "We demonstrate a tunable longwave infrared photodetector with ultra-high sensitivity based on graphene surface plasmon polaritons controlled by ferroelectric domains. The simulated results show that the photodetector shows a tunable absorption peak, modulated by periodically polarized ferroelectric domains at the nanoscale, with an ultra-high responsivity up to 7.62 × 106 A W-1 and a detectivity of ∼6.24 × 1013 Jones (Jones = cm Hz1/2 W-1) in the wavelengths ranging from 5 to 20 μm at room temperature. The potential mechanism for the prominent performances of the proposed photodetector can be attributed to the highly confined graphene surface plasmons excited by the local electrical field across the interface of the graphene and ferroelectric layer resonant to the incident wavelength, which could be easily controlled by the features of the ferroelectric domains. Compared with the silicon-based graphene plasmonic photodetector using a complex process of micro-nano fabrication, the proposed photodetector provides the advantages of a more convenient and controllable technique without the need for patterning graphene, and lower energy consumption due to the non-volatile properties of the ferroelectrics without an additional contact electrode. The tunable spectral response and the ultra-high responsivity make the graphene plasmonic photodetector tuned by the ferroelectric domains promising in practical applications of micro-spectrometers and other light sensing devices.",

This tannase showed optimum activity at pH 6.0 and 30°C. The enzyme was inhibited by Fe 3+, Zn 2+, dithiothrietol (DTT), β-mercaptoethanol, formaldehyde, and ethanol, and induced by K +, Mn 2+, Tween 80, and Triton X-100. The Michaelis constant (K m) and the second-order constant (k cat/K m) values of the tannase for propyl gallate (PG) were 0.62 mM and 174.1 mM/sec. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra indicated that the secondary structure of the tannase contained 14% α helix, 32.4% anti-parallel β-sheet, 4.8% β-sheet, 18.8% β-turn, and 30% random coil. Native tannase in ultrapure water manifested as spherical nano-particle aggregates with diameters ranging from 50 to 300 nm determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). © The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer 2011.",

Methods: In the experiments of D-galactose-induced subacute aging mice, effect of GAP on viscera was determined by measuring body weight and organ weight. MTT method was employed to investigate T lymphocyte and B lymphocyte proliferation, thymocytes proliferation was employed to investigate activity of IL-2, SOD activity GSH-Px activity and MDA content in serum were determined using chemicalbiological methods, effect of GAP on hemogram in mice was analyzed by instrument analysis; In the experiments of natural aging mice, effect on immune organ, carbon granula clearance ability, serum hemolysin level, DTH induced by DNFB were determined. Results: In the experiments of D-galactose-induced subacute aging mice, GAP showed good effects such as increasing thymus index and spleen index of model mice, promoting proliferation of activated and inactivated T, B lymphocyte in vitro, stimulating IL-2 secretion of lymphocyte, enhancing leucocyte number and antioxidative capacity of model mice. In the experiments of natural aging mice, GAP also showed good effects such as increasing spleen index and thymus index, enhancing phagocytosing ability of peritoneal macrophage and DTH reaction, promoting production of serum hemolysins immunized with SRBC. Conclusion: GAP can delay aging process of D-galactose-induced subacute aging mice and natural aging mice in some degree, the mechanism maybe related to increasing immune function and antioxidative ability.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the molecular mechanism of down-regulated expression of NPTX2 gene in pancreatic carcinoma.Methods Methylation of NPTX2 gene in 2 samples of normal pancreatic tissues and 6 samples of pancreatic carcinoma cell lines(AsPC1,BxPC3,CFPAC,PaTu8988,PANC1 and SW1990) was detected by the methylation-specific PCR(MSP) method,and then the methylation status was confirmed by sequencing.The expression level and methylation status of NPTX2 were detected with and without 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine(5Aza-dC) treatment,a kind of DNA methyltransferase(DNMT)inhibitor in ASPC1 and PANC1 pancreatic cell lines,by using qRT-PCR and quantitative methylation real time PCR with SYBR Green.Results The methylation of NPTX2 gene was undetected in 2 samples of normal pancreatic tissues,while detected in all the 6 samples of pancreatic carcinoma cell lines in varied degrees,which was confirmed by the results of sequencing.The result of quantitative methylation real time PCR indicated that,before the treatment of 5Aza-dC,the methylation indexes(MI) of AsPC1 and PANC1 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines were 0.964 and 0.531,respectively,and the relative quantities of mRNA expression(RQ) of the two cell lines were 5.251 and 0,respectively.After the treatment of 5Aza-dC,the MI was 0.472 and 0.226,and the RQ was 5.965 and 1.076.The mRNA expression levels of NPTX2 gene increased after 5Aza-dC treatment in both AsPC1 and PANC1 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines.Conclusions The methylation of NPTX2 gene may be the major mechanism of down-regulated expression of NPTX2 gene in pancreatic carcinoma.",

        "abstract": "Tva is the cellular receptor for subgroup A avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV-A). The viral receptor function of Tva is determined by a 40-residue cysteine-rich motif called the LDL-A module. In this study, we expressed and purified the wild-type (wt) Tva LDL-A module as well as several mutants and examined their in vitro folding properties. We found that, as for other LDL-A modules, correct folding and structure of the Tva LDL-A module is Ca2+ dependent. When calcium was present during in vitro protein folding, the wt module was eluted as a single peak by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Furthermore, two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy gave well-dispersed spectra in the presence of calcium. In contrast, the same protein folded in vitro in the absence of calcium was eluted as multiple broad peaks and gave a poorly dispersed NMR spectrum in the presence of calcium. The calcium affinity (Kd) of the Tva LDL-A module, determined by isothermal titration calorimetry, is approximately 40 microM. Characterization of several Tva mutants provided further evidence that calcium is important in protein folding and function of Tva. Mutations of the Ca2+-binding residues (D46A and E47A) completely abrogated the Ca2+-binding ability of Tva, and the proteins were not correctly folded. Interestingly, mutations of two non-calcium-binding residues (W48A and L34A) also exerted adverse effect on Ca2+-dependent folding, albeit to a much less extent. Our results provide new insights regarding the structure and function of Tva in ASLV-A entry.",

        "abstract": "Microalbuminuria is an early marker of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Previous studies have shown that either metabolic syndrome (MetS) or chronic inflammation is related to renal impairment. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between MetS, C-reactive protein (CRP) and microalbuminuria in a rural Chinese population.This was a cross-sectional study using data from the Handan Eye Study. MetS was defined according to the Chinese Diabetes Society (CDS) criteria. CRP levels ≥ 3 mg/L were classified as high CRP. Microalbuminuria was defined as a urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) of 30-300 mg/g.We included 4191 subjects aged ≥ 30 years in this analysis. The prevalence of MetS and microalbuminuria in the group was 25.7% and 15.6%, respectively. The odds ratio (OR) of microalbuminuria in subjects with MetS was 1.25 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03 - 1.51) compared with those without microalbuminuria. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, high blood pressure (OR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.10 - 1.67) and high fasting blood glucose (OR 1.44, 95% CI: 1.17 - 1.76) were independently associated with microalbuminuria. Subjects with high CRP and MetS had a 1.46-fold greater risk of having microalbuminuria compared with those with low CRP without MetS (95% CI: 1.06 - 2.01).In this rural Chinese population aged ≥30 years, MetS and microalbuminuria were independently related and the combination of high CRP and MetS was associated with an increased risk of microalbuminuria.",

Current antithrombotic agent aspirin has serious side effects such as higher bleeding risk and serious gastrointestinal ulcers. Diosgenin reported in clinical research could prevent thrombosis without side effects. However, poor bioavailability and low knowledge on its molecular targets limit its clinical application. A novel prodrug with antithrombotic effect was prepared based on conjugating diosgenin derivatives to PEG with Schiff-base bond. The prodrug with long blood circulation time and satisfying safety could self-assemble into micelles in water. The prodrug micelles with pH-responsibility could targetedly release diosgenin in position of thrombus in vivo. The results indicate that the prodrug micelles without bleeding risk and histological damages prevent thrombosis by inhibiting platelet activation and apoptosis. Our studies demonstrate that the prodrug micelles could obviously enhance the efficacy in the prevention of arterial thrombus and venous thrombus than aspirin.",

        "abstract": "This study proposes a new approach for diosgenin production from Dioscorea zingiberensis C. H. Wright tubers with respect to resources utilization and clean production. This process consisted of two successive parts, i.e., recovery of starch from raw material, and microbial hydrolysis of the residue to produce diosgenin by Trichoderma reesei . In the first step, about 75.4% of hemicellulose and 98.0% of starch were removed from the tubers. In the second step, about 90.2% of diosgenin was released from saponins by T. reesei at 30 °C, at an aeration of 0.80 vvm and agitation rate of 300 rpm in a 5.0 L bioreactor. Significant reduction of pollutant production was detected by replacing the traditional approach with the proposed new method. About 99.2% of reducing sugar, 99.4% of chemical oxygen demand, 99.2% of total organic carbon, 100% of SO 4 2− , and 100% of acid was reduced in the new processing wastewater.

It usually occurs in plants of Dioscorea , Costus and Trigonella in the form of saponins, which attach glucose or rhamnose to aglycone by C–O glucosidic bonds [3,4] . Production of diosgenin from plant tubers mainly depends on the hydrolysis of these chemical bonds. In the traditional method, sulfuric acid is usually used for this purpose. However, this process resulted in serious environmental problems for a great volume of wastewater with high concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD), SO 4 2− and acid was produced [5,6] . Several studies have reported to have solved this problem, most of which were focused on excluding about 90% of fiber and starch in plant tubers by physical or biological methods before acid hydrolysis [7] . This pretreatment procedure could decrease at least 50% of COD in wastewater, but the huge amount of acid wastewater is still a critical problem in the diosgenin industry. It is well known that biotransformation methods have remarkable predominance due to their high selectivity and mild reaction conditions [8,9] . Life cycle assessment shows that compared with inorganic catalysis, the biological transformation is environmentally more favorable and can save energy [10] . Production of diosgenin by biological transformation is an attractive clean alternative. To release diosgenin from saponins, multi-enzymes (cellulase, β-glucosidase and pectinase) [11] or raw enzymes produced by mutant Aspergillus niger [12] can be used. However, it is not an economical approach since the prices of enzymes are high [13] . The cost of the microbial method is reduced [14,15] , but the major drawback of this approach is the low diosgenin yield [16,17] . Saponins in plant cells are wrapped by the starch, which is a more easily utilized carbon source for microorganisms. Existence of starch in plant tubers will protect saponins from being hydrolyzed by the microorganisms. In previous research, we intended to solve this problem by enzymatic saccharifying of the raw material to recover the starch before microbial hydrolysis [18] . However, few studies have been made to scale up the new process and evaluate the environmental impacts and material consumption of the new process. The purpose of this study was to optimize the fermentation parameter to scale up the new process in a 5.0 L bioreactor, and compare the material consumption and pollution production of the traditional and new processes to evaluate the environmental and economic effect of our proposed method. 2 Methods 2.1 Raw material The dried Dioscorea zingiberensis C. H. Wright (DZW) tubers used for diosgenin production were provided by Tianhe Pharmaceutical Company, Yunxi, Hubei, China. α-Amylase (2000 IU/g) and saccharifying enzyme (10000 IU/g) were obtained from Beijing Donghua Biotechnology Company, China. 2.2 Microorganism The fungal strain Trichoderma reesei with the collection number 30597 was conserved in Agricultural Culture Collection of China and acclimated in sterilized substrate of 50% multi-saponins. The strain was stored at 4 °C on potato dextrose agar slant and subcultured routinely at an interval of 2 weeks. To prepare the inocula, spores in a 7-day-old agar slant were suspended in 5 mL of 0.01% Tween 80 solution and transferred into 100 mL of subculture medium composed of (g/L): 30 sucrose, 3 NaNO 3 , 1 K 2 HPO 4 , 0.5 MgSO 4 , 0.01 FeSO 4 and 0.1 Tween 80. Fungal cells were subgenerated on a shaking incubator at 150 rpm at 30 °C for 3 days. 2.3 New process The flow chart of the proposed new process was shown in Fig. 1 a . The dried raw material was cleaned, cut and ground. The powder (500 g) was uniformly mixed with 3 L tap water in a reaction vessel and boiled for 1 h, then adjusted to pH 6.5 after cooling, incubated at 70 °C for 1 h with 10 g of dry amylase. The enzymatic hydrolysate solution was adjusted to pH 4.0 at room temperature, then saccharified with 15 g of saccharifying enzyme at 60 °C for 8 h, followed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The solid residue was washed with water, centrifuged and dried at 60 °C, and ground again to pass through a 100-mesh screen. About 180 g pretreated DZW (PDZW) was obtained. Microbial hydrolysis tests were then conducted in a 5 L stirred bioreactor containing 80 g peptone, 8.7 g K 2 HPO 4 , 293 g PDZW and 3 L H 2 O for 7 days. Base on the previous optimization of fermentation medium and conditions in flask shake level, Tween 80, temperature, aeration and agitation rates were further optimized when fermentation was scaled up. Biomass, diosgenin yield, and β-glucosidase during microbial hydrolysis were determined to evaluate the hydrolysis efficiency. 2.4 Traditional process Dried DZW (500 g) was mixed with 1 L H 2 O in a 2 L beaker, fermented at 30 °C with no additional strain for 7 days. About 1 L H 2 O was added to the beaker during the fermentation to keep DZW wet. Then 1.5 L of 1 M H 2 SO 4 was added and the reaction was conducted at 121 °C for 3 h in a hydrolysis vessel ( Fig. 1 b). The hydrolyte was filtered and washed with water until it became neutral. The filtrate residue was dried at 60 °C and diosgenin contained in it was determined. 2.5 Analysis 2.5.1 Biomass Since the existence of PDZW, the biomass of T. reesei during the microbial hydrolysis could not be estimated directly. Intracellular protein concentration was detected with a UV/VIS spectrophotometer using the method described by Zhang et al. [19] . The fermentation sample was centrifuged, and the cells were collected and washed with distilled water twice, then lysed with 20 mL of 0.2 M NaOH at 100 °C for 20 min. The protein in lysate was determined with the standard Lowry method at 595 nm. 2.5.2 β-Glucosidase The sample broth was centrifuged at 4 °C and 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The suspension was obtained for activity analysis. One milliliter of 5 mM p NPG (pH 4.8 acetate buffer) was maintained at 50 °C for 10 min, then 1 mL of appropriately diluted enzyme was added. The enzyme reaction was stopped by adding 1 mL of 1 M Na 2 CO 3 after 10 min. The mixture was then measured at 420 nm. One unit of β-glucosidase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that released 1 μmol p -nitrophenol under the above conditions in 1 min. 2.5.3 Diosgenin The whole fermentation medium in the bioreactor was centrifuged, dried at 60 °C, extracted with chloroform ultrasonic treating for 30 min, and filtrated. Diosgenin in filtrate was detected with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [9] . Diosgenin yield (%) is accounted for with the equation: Y = C m − C 0 C a − C 0 × 100 % Where Y is diosgenin yield (%); C m and C a are diosgenin content in substrate after microbial and acid treatment; C 0 is the diosgenin content in substrate. 2.5.4 Water quality analysis COD, total organic carbon (TOC), SO 4 2− , H + , reducing sugar, and organic compounds in new and traditional processing wastewater were determined with the method described by Cheng et al. [9] in the same laboratory to investigate the environmental impact of the new approach. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 New process 3.1.1 Enzymatic saccharification With enzymatic saccharification, about 75.4% hemicellulose and 98.0% starch were excluded from tubers, resulting in 29.1% hemicellulose, 2.11% starch and 9.25% diosgenin in PDZW. About 180 g of PDZW was obtained when 500 g DZW was treated. It can be calculated that during the saccharification process, 9.90% of diosgenin increased as the release of saponins from wrap of starch. About 120 g sugar was recovered from 500 g DZW and can be used as carbon sources in the fermentation industry for the production of ethanol, lactic acid, citric acid, vitamin B 2 , and so on [7,11]. In industry, it is common that some of wastes could be recovered by using them as raw materials in other industrial sectors [20] . 3.1.2 Microbial hydrolysis In microbial hydrolysis procedure, the optimal media components and condition parameters were achieved through response surface methodology in flask shake level (data were not shown). The analysis of variance indicated that factors affected in microbial hydrolysis followed the order: [Tween 80] > [peptone] > [K 2 HPO 4 ], temperature > incubation period > [substrate] > pH. Scale-up was conducted in a 5.0 L stirred tank bioreactor to produce diosgenin in a larger scale. The effect of the two most significant factors, concentration of Tween 80 and temperature, were further investigated in detail [21] . Oxygen plays an important role in aerobic bioprocessing. It is controlled by aeration and agitation rates when fermentation is carried out in a stirred tank bioreactor. Thus, the aeration and agitation rates were also optimized in this study. Different concentrations of surfactant Tween 80, at 0.25%, 0.73% and 1.25%, were added to the medium. β-Glucosidase played a key role in biotransformation of saponins; in some ranges, the higher the β-glucosidase was, the more diosgenin was accumulated. It can be seen from Table 1 that Tween 80, at the concentration of 0.25% and 0.73%, stimulated the production of β-glucosidase and increased diosgenin yield without obvious impact on biomass. A maximum enzyme production and diosgenin yield were gained when 0.73% Tween 80 was added. Supplement of 1.25% Tween 80 inhibited growth of the microorganism, and resulted in a lower production of enzyme and reduced yield of diosgenin. As saponins in PDZW are poorly soluble, it may decrease the microbial hydrolysis efficiency. The purpose of this work is bioconversion of saponins to diosgenin, which including production of β-glucosidase and hydrolysis of saponins. In this experiment, Tween 80 does not have a significant effect on fungal growth, but could increase β-glucosidase production and accelerate the bioconversion of saponins. The positive influence of surfactant in solid substrate medium when incubated with different microorganisms has been already reported, though the mechanism by which they enhance hydrolysis efficiency is so far not well demonstrated [22–24] . The general accepted point is that Tween 80 could improve the growth rate of microorganisms, alter the membrane surface property to stimulate the enzyme production, and increase solubility of substrate during the fungal fermentation [25,26] . The influence of temperature on fungal growth, β-glucosidase production and diosgenin accumulation were estimated at 20, 30, and 40 °C. The result is shown in Table 2 . During the test, other conditions were fixed at optimal levels. The maximum diosgenin yield of 88.8 ± 2.68% was achieved at 30 °C after 6.5 days fermentation, with a biomass of 3.11 ± 0.12 g/L and β-glucosidase activity of 6.53 ± 0.51 IU/mL. At 20 °C, the biomass decreased to 1.89 ± 0.11 g/L, resulting in lower enzyme activity of 3.72 ± 0.43 IU/mL and diosgenin yield of 30.4 ± 3.87%. At 40 °C, the biomass decreased to 1.02 ± 0.07 IU/mL, with β-glucosidase activity and diosgenin yield decreasing to 1.53 ± 0.14 IU/mL and 73.0 ± 1.74%. Temperature is an important factor for microorganism growth and metabolism; it affects nutrient intake, enzyme activity, substrate solubility and the interfacial tension between the enzyme and the substrate during the biotransformation process. The higher diosgenin yield observed at 30 °C may be explained by the increased β-glucosidase activity, in agreement with our earlier finding which showed that β-glucosidase can release diosgenin from binding form of saponins compounds in DZW tuber [11] . Sheldon et al. also reported that optimum enzyme production for T. reesei was in the temperature range of 25–30 °C [27] . The influence of the agitation rate on fungal growth, β-glucosidase activity and diosgenin accumulation was evaluated ( Table 3 ). Maximum biomass and β-glucosidase activity were observed when the agitation speed was set at 300 rpm. Increasing of the agitation rate resulted in a decrease in the fungal growth and enzyme production but an increase in diosgenin yield. The yield reached its highest at an agitation of 300 rpm and then decreased. The result was similar to the research done by Bhattacharyya et al. [28] on fermentation of Geotrichum candidum for the production of carbonyl reductase. Increasing agitation speed could increase dissolved oxygen in liquid, leading to fungal growth and enzyme production, while strenuous agitating would generate stress which diminishes mycelia growth and induces lower enzyme activity. The reactant surface area also increased with accelerating agitation, which can explain the higher diosgenin yield with lower enzyme activity at 300 rpm. The influence of aeration rate on β-glucosidase activity and diosgenin yield is shown in Table 4 . When the fungus was grown at 0.6 vvm, highest biomass and β-glucosidase activity were achieved, higher aeration speed (0.8 vvm) did not support more enzyme produced but did result in a higher diosgenin yield as the reactant surface area between substrate and enzyme increased. A further increase in aeration rate led to a decrease of enzyme activity and diosgenin yield. Oxygen depletion usually occurred when the bioreactor ran at higher aeration speed (1.0 vvm and 1.2 vvm) because of the incomplete mixing of substance in the bioreactor. Foam formation was another problem caused by high aeration rate, which led to movement of fungal cell and enzyme. Therefore 300 rpm agitation rate and 0.8 vvm aeration speed were optimum for diosgenin scaled-up bioproduction. A yield of 90.2 ± 3.12% was obtained under these conditions. 3.2 Comparison of traditional method and new processes 3.2.1 The quality of diosgenin The products from the two processes were analyzed with nuclear magnetic resonance, HPLC, HPLC–Mass Spectrometry (MS), and melting point determination. The melting point and purity of diosgenin obtained from the new process was 208.59 °C and 98.4%, which was similar to that achieved from the traditional process and satisfied the Quality Standard of Diosgenin in China (melting point: ≥195 °C) [29] . 3.2.2 Time As shown in Table 5 , the new process took about 188 h for diosgenin preparation in a 5.0 L bioreactor, about 17 h longer than the traditional method which took about 171 h. 3.2.3 Environmental compatibility Evaluation of environmental compatibility of the new process was performed by comparison of qualities of wastewater produced from the traditional and new processes. Compared with the traditional method, the new approach could extract 89.5% of diosgenin, with 99.2% of reducing sugar, 99.4% of COD, 99.2% of TOC, 100% of SO 4 2− and 100% of acid removed from wastewater. Gas chromatography/MS performance was introduced to analyze the organic compounds in wastewater produced from the two processes. The compounds were identified according to the NIST 0.5 database and are presented in Table 6 . The data analysis revealed the existence of at least 31 kinds of organic components in traditional processing wastewater, many of which are unfavorable to the environment, and some are difficult to biodegrade [5] . Only two organic compounds, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, butyl 2-methylpropyl ester and 5-androsten-17β-ol-3-one, were detected in wastewater produced from the new process. As shown in Fig. 1 , most of the compounds in traditional processing wastewater were produced in acid hydrolysis. In this process, besides saponins, other components (starch, fiber, lipid and colloid) in DZW were degraded into small molecular compounds, leading to high concentrations of reducing sugar, COD, and TOC in wastewater. In the new approach, microbial hydrolysis was a mild and specific method with much fewer by-products induced, exhibiting an excellent performance in reducing organic pollutants in processing wastewater. It was implied that the microbial approach is a clean method for diosgenin production. 3.2.4 Financial analysis The capital and operation costs of the traditional and new processes are shown in Table 7 . The capital cost of the new process was about 15,300 dollars including the equipment purchase of reaction vessel, centrifuge and bioreactor, while the investment in the traditional process was about 11,000 dollars for the purchase of the hydrolysis vesse1 and centrifuge. Although the new process resulted in a higher capital cost, the investment in wastewater treatment equipment was high when the traditional process was applied [5] . When 1 t of DZW was used for producing diosgenin, the use of acid was 3000 L of 1 M H 2 SO 4 in the conventional system, which cost 29 dollars. The running cost of enzyme (amylase and saccharifying enzyme) and fermentation nutrient (peptone, K 2 HPO 4 and Tween 80) was about 178 dollars in the new process. The amount of water needed in the conventional process was 2000 L per 1 t DZW and most of consumption took place in washing the acid hydrolysate. The use of water in the new process was mainly due to the enzymatic saccharification process and about 10000 L per 1 t treated DZW. The energy consumption (primary electricity) for the traditional method mainly focused on the acid hydrolysis process, which applied high pressure (1.21 Pa) and high temperature (121 °C) for 3 h, while in the new method most energy was consumed in the process of liquification and saccharification. The lesser operating costs of the new process came from reduction of water and acid use, decrease of wastewater discharge and production of sugar, while being at a disadvantage on the use of enzyme and fungal strains and lower diosgenin yield. In total, the financial cost of the new process was about 100 dollars higher than that of the traditional process per 1 t of DZW treated. The higher cost was mainly due to the nutrients required for microorganism growth, such as peptone, K 2 HPO 4 and Tween 80. These nutrients might be replaced by some cheaper organic nitrogen source, phosphate source and surface active agent in industry, thus reducing running costs. The income of the new process was 1340 dollars/kg DZW; this value was 1420 dollars/t DZW when traditional process was employed. The lower income of the new process was due to the lower diosgenin yield of microbial hydrolysis compared with acid hydrolysis. For future research, one should aim at increasing the microbial hydrolysis efficiency using techniques of molecular biology. Although the income of the new process was lower, the net income of 612 dollars was the result when 1 t of DZW was treated by this method. It is thus a promising technology for diosgenin production from an economic viewpoint. 4 Conclusion The production of diosgenin from DZW tubers was accomplished by a successive process including recovery of available resources and microbial hydrolysis. The optimal conditions for microbial hydrolysis in the 5.0 L bioreactor were obtained at 0.73% Tween 80, temperature of 30 °C, agitation rate of 300 rpm and aeration speed of 0.8 vvm. Compared to the traditional method, the proposed new process could extract 89.5% of diosgenin and decrease 99.2% of reducing sugar, 99.4% of COD, 99.2% of TOC, 100% of SO 4 2− and 100% of acid in processing wastewater, indicating that it was a clean and effective technology in diosgenin production. Future study can concentrate on increasing the microbial hydrolysis efficiency using molecular biology technology and reducing the nutrient cost during the microbial hydrolysis.

        "abstract": "Objective To assay the expression change of matrix metalloproteinasea-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinasea-9 (MMP-9) in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in rats, and to investigate the relationship between the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the kidney in these rats. Methods We divided 12 Wistar rats into test group and control group. The model of focal segmental glomerursclerosis (n=7) was made by intravenous injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) 9mg/100g body weight. Rats in control group (n=5) were injected with 3ml 0.9% sodium chloride. Proteinuria and serum creatinine, lipids and protein were examined. Twenty weeks after the injection rats were sacrificed and their kidneys were taken for examination. Renal MMP-2, MMP-9 and fibronectin (FN) were examined by Immunohistochemistry. Positive immunohistochemical signals were quantitatively analysed using the Image-pro software. Results Rats in the test group had prominent protienuria and the increase of serum lipids. Pathologically, the kidney showed focal segmental sclerosis or sclerosis of the whole glomerulus in a part of glomeruli. ECM was segmentally accumulated in the kidney. MMP-9 normally expresses in glomerular endothelial and epithelial cells at a low level, but the expression decreased significantly in glomeruli of the rats in test group (P<0.05). There was no significant relationship between the MMP-9 expression and proteinuia. MMP-2 normally expresses in small renal arteries and the interstitium around renal tubules at a low level, but the expression decreased insignificantly in kidney of the rats in test group (P>0.05). FN normally expresses in glomeruli mesangial areas, glomerular basement membrane and renal interstitium, and the expression increased significantly in kidney of the rats in test group (P<0.05). FN expression negatively correlated with MMP-9 expression, but had no relationship with MMP-2 expression and proteinuria. Conclusion In the pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, MMP-9 expression is down-regulated, resulting in the decrease of FN catabolism and the ECM accumulation.",

        "abstract": "Probiotic bacteria is able to metabolize polyphenols and produce functional compounds. In this study, we investigated the ability of probiotic bacteria including , bifidobacteria and  strains to increase the antioxidant capacity of polyphenols from lotus seed epicarp (PLSE) at full ripening stage. The results showed that the six selected strains of probiotic bacteria grew well in De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) broth with PLSE, and their resistant extent to PLSE varied from strain to strain. The metabolized PLSE was found to have good antioxidant properties on 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS⁺) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radicals in vitro. Five polyphenol compounds-chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, catechin, epicatechin and hyperoside-were suggested as the major bioactive metabolism for the antiradical activity of PLSE metabolized by  DSM20016,  M74 and  ATCC 15701. Moreover,  DSM20016 and  M74 were found to have a high PLSE bioconversion rate. Our results suggested that both  DSM20016 and  M74 might have excellent potential for the bioconversion of PLSE to increase its antiradical activity.",

The insights into the genetic basis of growth period traits can provide theoretical basis for cultivated area division, rational distribution, and molecular breeding for soybean varieties. In this study, genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) was exploited to detect the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for number of days to flowering (ETF), number of days from flowering to maturity (FTM), and number of days to maturity (ETM) using 4032 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers with 146 cultivars mainly from Northeast China. Results showed that abundant phenotypic variation was presented in the population, and variation explained by genotype, environment, and genotype by environment interaction were all significant for each trait. The whole accessions could be clearly clustered into two subpopulations based on their genetic relatedness, and accessions in the same group were almost from the same province. GWAS based on the unified mixed model identified 19 significant SNPs distributed on 11 soybean chromosomes, 12 of which can be consistently detected in both planting densities, and 5 of which were pleotropic QTL. Of 19 SNPs, 7 SNPs located in or close to the previously reported QTL or genes controlling growth period traits. The QTL identified with high resolution in this study will enrich our genomic understanding of growth period traits and could then be explored as genetic markers to be used in genomic applications in soybean breeding.

The piezoelectricity and surface morphology of the PVDF were examined by optical imaging and piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). The PFM shows phase contrast, indicating clear interface between the PVDF and electrode. The electro-mechanical properties show that the sensor exhibits excellent output response and an ultra-high signal-to-noise ratio. The output voltage and the applied pressure possess linear relationship with a slope of 12 mV/kPa. The hold-and-release output characteristics recover in less than 2.5 μs, demonstrating outstanding electro-mechanical response. Additionally, signal interference between the adjacent arrays has been investigated via theoretical simulation. The results show the interference reduces with decreasing pressure at a rate of 0.028 mV/kPa, highly scalable with electrode size and becoming insignificant for pressure level under 178 kPa.",

Additionally, the potential synergistic effects of corilagin + ginsenoside Rh2 (Rh2), and corilagin + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on ovarian cancer cells, and cancer-preventing activities, including inhibition of tyrosinase, properties of antioxidant and nitrite-scavenging, and blocking of nitrosamine synthesis were investigated. The results showed the content of corilagin from different parts of longan varied widely, while corilagin content in longan seed was high with a value of 542.15 ± 10.30 μg/g. Then the corilagin from longan seed was chosen for further study, since longan seed was easily obtained from by-product of longan fruit processing with low cost. Furthermore, the combinations of corilagin + Rh2, and corilagin + 5-FU showed an increased synergistic cytotoxicity on SKOv3ip and Hey cells. Moreover, corilagin inhibited exhibited effects of inhibiting tyrosinase, antioxidation, scavenging nitrite and blocking nitrosamine synthesis.",

        "abstract": "Understanding how DNA sequence variation is translated into variation for complex phenotypes has remained elusive but is essential for predicting adaptive evolution, for selecting agriculturally important animals and crops, and for personalized medicine. Gene expression may provide a link between variation in DNA sequence and organismal phenotypes, and its abundance can be measured efficiently and accurately. Here we quantified genome-wide variation in gene expression in the sequenced inbred lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), increasing the annotated Drosophila transcriptome by 11%, including thousands of novel transcribed regions (NTRs). We found that 42% of the Drosophila transcriptome is genetically variable in males and females, including the NTRs, and is organized into modules of genetically correlated transcripts. We found that NTRs often were negatively correlated with the expression of protein-coding genes, which we exploited to annotate NTRs functionally. We identified regulatory variants for the mean and variance of gene expression, which have largely independent genetic control. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for the mean, but not for the variance, of gene expression were concentrated near genes. Notably, the variance eQTLs often interacted epistatically with local variants in these genes to regulate gene expression. This comprehensive characterization of population-scale diversity of transcriptomes and its genetic basis in the DGRP is critically important for a systems understanding of quantitative trait variation.",

Most of these clusters feature ring or cage structures in the specific size range, differing much from the wurtzite structure of bulk ZnO. The low-lying isomers with various structures possess remarkably different properties. The effect of ring structure, cluster stability, HOMO-LUMO gap, covalent/ionic bonding, etc., on the dipole moment, polarizability, first and second hyperpolarizabilites is discussed. Both the polarizability and second hyperpolarizability exhibit distinct size dependences, reflecting clearly the structural transition when the cluster grows.

        "abstract": "Cardiac differentiation involves a cascade of coordinated gene expression that regulates cell proliferation and matrix protein formation in a defined temporal-spatial manner. The C 2H 2 zinc finger-containing transcription factors have been implicated as critical regulators of multiple cardiac-expressed genes and are important for human heart development and diseases. Here we have identified and characterized a novel zinc-finger gene named ZNF322 using degenerated primers from a human embryo heart cDNA library. The gene contains four exons and spans 23.2 kb in chromosome 6p22.1 region, and transcribes a 2.7 kb mRNA that encodes a protein with 402 amino acid residues. The predicted protein contains 9 tandem C 2H 2-type zinc-finger motifs. Northern blot analysis shows that ZNF322 is expressed in every human tissue examined at adult stage and during embryonic developmental stages from 80 days to 24 weeks. When overexpressed in COS-7 cells, ZNF322-EGFP fusion protein is detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Reporter gene assays show that ZNF322 is a transcriptional activator. Furthermore, overexpression of ZNF322 in COS-7 cells activates the transcriptional activity of SRE and AP-1. Together, these results suggest that ZNF322 is a member of the zinc-finger transcription factor family and may act as a positive regulator in gene transcription mediated by the MAPK signaling pathways. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "Soybean lodging can result in serious yield reduction. Detecting the quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with lodging tolerance for their further application in marker-assisted selection (MAS) has the potential to enhance soybean breeding efficiency. In this study, a genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) was performed to identify soybean accessions that could potentially be used to produce lodging-tolerant varieties, based on the comprehensive evaluation of lodging scores (LS) obtained for the parental cultivar “Tokachi nagaha” and its 137 derived cultivars. Results showed that genotype, environment and genotype × environment interaction significantly influenced LS. Of the 31 significant SNPs identified, 22 were consistently detected in two or more environments and 27 SNPs were located in or close to agronomically important QTL mapped by linkage analysis. Best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) of LS tend to decrease with the elite alleles contained by accessions increasing. Some excellent accessions, with lower BLUPs and Di (stability coefficients) values and more elite alleles, were selected. This study contributed to understand the genetic mechanism of lodging, providing genetic and phenotypic information for MAS.",

        "abstract": "Coreopsis tinctoria (snow chrysanthemum) has been reported to exert antihyperlipidemic effects. The present study aimed to identify the active compounds of Coreopsis tinctoria and to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects on lipid dysregulation by measuring lipid levels, reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation and fatty acid synthesis. The present results demonstrated that snow chrysanthemum aqueous extracts significantly reduced serum lipid levels and oxidative stress in vivo. The main compounds that were isolated were identified as flavanomarein (compound 1) and eriodictyol 7‑O‑β‑D glucopyranoside (compound 2). Compounds 1 and 2 demonstrated potent antioxidative properties, including free radical scavenging activity, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, as well as lipid‑lowering effects in human HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells treated with free fatty acids (FFAs). Compound 2 was revealed to suppress the elevation of triglyceride levels and inhibit lipid peroxidation following FFA treatment. In addition, it was demonstrated to significantly reduce intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species and improve the mitochondrial membrane potential and adenosine triphosphate levels, thus protecting mitochondrial function in FFA‑treated HepG2 cells. Furthermore, compound 2 markedly suppressed the protein expression levels of disulfide‑isomerase A3 precursor and fatty acid synthase, thus suppressing FFA‑induced lipogenesis in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, the present study identified compound 2 as one of the main active compounds in Coreopsis tinctoria responsible for its lipid‑lowering effects. Compound 2 was revealed to possess antihyperlipidemic properties, exerted via reducing oxidative stress, protecting mitochondrial function and suppressing lipogenesis.",

Therefore the shaft orbits recognition plays an important role in the fault diagnosis of steam turbine generator set. An automatic identification method of shaft orbit for steam turbine generator sets is proposed in this paper. The median morphological filter combining the open-closing with close-opening is used to eliminate the noise in the original X and Y vibration signals. Then the seven invariant moment feature are extracted from the shaft orbit reconstructed. Input the seven invariant moments to the trained BP neural network, the shaft orbit can be identified automatically. A case is verified this model. It is shown that this model is feasible and high precision for identify the shaft orbit in fault diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "We demonstrate an ultra-sensitive photodetector based on a graphene/monolayer MoS2 vertical heterostructure working at room temperature. Highly confined plasmon waves are efficiently excited through a periodic array of monolayer graphene ribbons in which plasmon resonance has remarkably large oscillator strength, resulting in a sharp optical absorption peak in the normal-incidence transmission spectrum. A significant amount of electron-hole pairs are produced in graphene ribbons by optical absorption, separated by the built-in electric field across the graphene/MoS2 heterojunction. The responsivity reaches up to 1 × 107 A W-1 at room temperature due to very strong resonance in the heterostructure, yielding a highly sensitive graphene-based photodetector. Additionally, the absorption can be tuned over a wide spectral range (6-16 μm) by varying gate biasing. The ultra-sensitive, spectrally tunable photodetector could be potentially used as a promising candidate for mid-infrared micro-spectrometers.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the correlation between the expression of neuron-specific protein and apoptosis in the process of differentiation from rat bone marrow stromal cells into neuron with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). METHODS: The 5th passage MSCs were induced by BDNF and 2-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), respectively. At 1 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h, nestin, neuron specific enolase (NSE), microtubulease associated protein (MAP)-2 and glail fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were detected by Western blotting. Cell cycle and apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Nestin and NSE of neuron-like cells induced by BDNF and β-ME were all positive by Western blotting. At 12 h, nestin and NSE turned to negative and apoptosis was detected in β-ME group, nestin and NSE still positive and apoptosis wasn't detected in BDNF group. Till 24 h, nestin and NSE in BDNF group were negative but apoptosis still not detected. Notably, GFAP (glial astrocyte marker) was detected and MAP-2 wasn't detected in the two induced groups. CONCLUSION: The down-expression of neuron-specific protein correspondingly with apoptosis in the process of differentiation from MSCs into neuron with β-ME shows that apoptosis may be one of the causes of induced cell death. BDNF induction was not the cause of apoptosis. Other factors may include for the cell death in the presence of neuron-specific protein expression induced by BDNF.",

Methods Based on the cross-sectional data provided by BJHDQCIC in 2007 Beijing,the hemoglobin levels in long-term maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients and newly enrolled MHD patients were analyzed. The correlation of hemoglobin level with gender,age and primary disease was evaluated. Results In 2007,the overall rate of hemoglobin level within the recommended range after anti-anemia therapy was less than 50% in long-term and newly enrolled MHD patients. Gender was one of the factors that affected the rate of hemoglobin level within the recommended range in long-term MHD patients,but not in newly enrolled MHD patients. Age did not affect the hemoglobin level in both long-term and newly enrolled MHD patients. The rate of hemoglobin level within the recommended range was higher in patients with urinary system tumors,and was lower in those with hemolytic uremic syndrome. However,more patients are required to confirm this phenomenon. Conclusion In long-term and newly enrolled MHD patients in Beijing,the rate of hemoglobin level within the recommended range after anti-anemia therapy was lower than that reported from foreign countries. Gender was one of factors that affected this rate in MHD patients.",

Zinc finger-containing transcription factors have been implicated as critical regulators of multiple cardiac-expressed genes, and are thought to be important for human heart development and diseases. Here, we have identified and characterized a novel zinc finger gene named ZNF418 from a human embryo heart cDNA library. The gene spans 13.5 kb on chromosome 19q13.43 encompassing six exons, and transcribes a 3.7-kb mRNA that encodes a protein with 676 amino acid residues. The predicted protein contains a KRAB-A box and 17 tandem C2H2 type zinc finger motifs. Northern blot analysis indicates that ZNF418 is expressed in multiple fetal and adult tissues, but is expressed at higher levels in the heart. Reporter gene assays show that ZNF418 is a transcriptional repressor, and the KRAB motif of ZNF418 represents the basal repressive domain. Overexpression of ZNF418 in COS-7 cells inhibits the transcriptional activity of SRE and AP-1 which may be silenced by siRNA. These results suggest that ZNF418 is a member of the zincfinger transcription factor family and may act as a negative regulator in MAPK signaling pathway.",

        "title": "Experimental study on the dynamic tensile behavior of a poly-crystal pure titanium at elevated temperatures",
        "abstract": "A new technique for measuring dynamic tensile behavior of metallic materials at elevated temperatures was developed. This technique employs a rapid contact heating method to obtain a stable and nearly homogenous high temperature field in the testing gage of the specimen. As an application of this new technique, a commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) was tested in the strain rate range of 300 s −1 –1400 s −1 and in a temperature range of 298 K–973 K. Quasi-static experiments (10 −3 s −1 , 10 −2 s −1 ) were also performed in the same temperature range for comparison. The testing results indicated that both temperature and strain rate have pronounced influence on the mechanical behavior of CP-Ti. Keywords High temperature Strain rate Dynamic behavior Titanium 1 Introduction Numerous engineering applications of structural metallic materials involve dynamic or impact types of loading. In order to make a full understanding on the deformation and fracture process of these structures, it is necessary to know the dynamic properties of the materials involved in these structural components. When the loading rate is high, the mechanical response of a material is generally different from what it is at a lower rate. This is commonly explained by the theory of “thermal activation” [1] , i.e. the dislocation movement, which is usually the determinant of plastic flow, is dominated by the applied stress and the thermal equilibrium fluctuation of the dislocation. One of the important results of this theory is that the effective stress required for the plastic flow is greatly dependent on the strain rate and temperature at which the deformation occurs. This mechanism is particularly important in the high-rate deformation process, since elevated temperature arises naturally in high-rate deformation through adiabatic heating. Therefore, understanding of the dynamic plastic response of metals at elevated temperatures is of fundamental importance for the understanding of the rate-controlling mechanisms of plastic flow as well as of technical importance for applications in which high temperatures involved. The first and the most important step of this research is to develop an effective high-rate high-temperature testing system. In this section, we will make a brief review on the development of such apparatus. Since the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) [2] is the most common approach to the measurement of the dynamic response of materials, investigations on the temperature dependence of materials at high strain rates are mainly focused on their compression properties. In general, there are two categories of methods to realize such high-temperature experiment [3] . One approach is to heat the specimen while it is in contact with the input and output bars, allowing a high temperature rise to develop within the bars. This approach requires further adjustment in the temperature-dependent modulus, and thus the impedance and wave velocity, of the bar material [4–6] . Another method is to heat the specimen while minimize the temperature rise and the length of affected region of the bars. Based on this concept, Frantz et al. [7] developed a non-contact heating technique in the SHPB systems. A screw-driven bar mover system is used to move the bars into contact with the well heated specimen just a few milliseconds before testing. Since the contact time for the cold bars and the specimen is short, there is not enough time for the temperature of the specimen to drop and for the temperature in the bars to increase significantly. Similar ideas were also adopted by other researchers [8,9] . However, this technique is limited to compressive test in which the specimen is simply placed between the bars. In tensile tests, the specimen must be glued or mechanically connected to the bars, which is impossible to accomplish in a very short time. A different way to heat the specimen while keeping the bar in a relatively low temperature is to use a high intensity localized heating device, such approach was attempted by Rosenberg et al. [10] using induction heating for tests at temperatures up to 700 °C. It must be noted that, most of the high-rate high-temperature experimental researches have been focused on the compression tests. However, investigations have shown that the mechanical responses of many materials are quite different while subjected to different types of loading. For example, in many initially-textured poly-crystalline hexagonal metals (e.g. rolled plates or extruded rods), a compressive stress applied nearly parallel to the basal planes of the grains favors twinning, whereas a similarly-directed tensile stress can not induce such twins [11,12] . As a result, the stress–strain curves of these materials obtained in tension and compression are very different. Such tension/compression asymmetry makes high-rate high-temperature tensile test very essential for getting a full knowledge of the mechanical behaviors of metals. In the present research, a new experimental technique was developed for tensile impact testing at elevated temperature. This technique uses two preheated furnaces to rapidly heat the specimen to a desired temperature in a rather short period of time, thus avoids a significant temperature rise in input and output bars. As an application, the effects of temperature and strain rate on the mechanical behavior of a commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) was studied. The new technique is described in the following section. 2 Experimental techniques 2.1 Tension technique Since Harding firstly developed tensile Hopkinson-bar technique in 1960 [13] , various modifications have been made to generate tensile loading pulse in Split Hopkinson Bar (SHB) system. Nicholas [14] place a shoulder between the two Hopkinson Pressure Bars, so the initial compression wave will bypass the specimen and then reflected in tension to load the specimen. Staab and Gilat [15] introduced a direct-tension Split Hopkinson-bar apparatus in which the specimen is loaded by a tensile wave that is generated by the release of a prestressed section of the incident bar. In recent decades, direct impact on an impact block connected to the input bar was employed to generate tension pulse [16,17] . A weighbar tube or a gas gun with strike tube was generally used for generating the load. Xia et al. [18] further developed an indirect method by placing a short metal bar between the impact block and the incident bar, as shown in Fig. 1 . Tensile wave will be created while the short metal bar is subjected to impact loading and deformed to fracture. The main superiority of this modification is that the amplitude and duration of the incident pulse could be easily shaped only by changing the diameter and length of the short metal bar. Moreover, attributed to its plastic flow, the prefixed short metal bar can filter the high-frequency oscillation introduced by the impact process to the loading pulse, thus a rather smooth incident wave is obtained and the pseudo constitutive response brought by the oscillation [19] can be eliminated. 2.2 The high temperature Split Hopkinson Tension Bar (SHTB) at USTC Based on the concept of rapid contact localized heating, two versions of heating furnaces and the corresponding methods of temperature measurement were developed successively [20,21] . Compared with the heating furnace in reference [20] , better stability, higher heating efficiency and greater thermal inertia can be achieved in the heating furnace presented in this paper. The schematic diagram of the testing system and the photograph of the furnace are shown in Figs. 1a and 2 , respectively. The testing process is illustrated in Fig. 1 a, the specimen and the bars are connected by a kind of inorganic adhesive. A pair of heating furnaces is placed at each side of the specimen. Inside each furnace, a stainless steel bar, which is used as a heat storage, is heated by a heating coil wound around it. A thermocouple, mounted tightly in a central hole drilled in the center of the heat storage, provides the temperature measurement and the feedback to a temperature monitor. The measured temperature rise history is shown in Fig. 3 , where T d is the preset temperature at which the power is switched off by the monitor, and T f is a plateau temperature ( T f is defined as the temperature about 5 K below the maximum temperature). At T f the furnaces are pushed into contact with the specimen, and the specimen is heated by two copper conductors fixed on the heat storage ( Fig. 2 ). In a very short time (about 30 s), a stable and nearly homogenous temperature field can be formed in the testing gage of the specimen, then the tensile impact experiment is performed immediately. The specimen geometry and the connection between the specimen and the bars are shown in Fig. 4 . Due to the difficulties in mounting the thermocouple on the testing gage of the specimen during test [20] , we used an indirect method to determine the temperature of the specimen. In this method, a calibrating experiment was taken to establish the relationship between T f and the specimen temperature T s . As shown in Fig. 4 , three holes are drilled in the testing gage of the specimen, and three thermocouples are placed in the holes to measure the temperature distribution in the testing gage while the copper conductors are in contact with the specimen. At the same time, T f is measured by the thermocouple placed in the central hole of the heat storage. Thus the temperature relationship between T s and T f can be established. Fig. 5 shows the temperature rise history at the central hole of the specimen. It can be seen that after about 1 min, the temperature reaches a stable value ( T s1 ) and keeps for a certain duration Δ t 2 . In this duration, the maximum variance of T s1 is about 1% at all testing temperatures ( Table 1 ). It can be also seen that Δ t 2 gets shorter with increasing T s1 and reduces to a value of 1 min when T s1 = 1073 K. Considering that the dynamic tensile process can be accomplished in about 30 s after T s1 reaches the stable value, Δ t 2 is long enough for testing. Table 1 shows the temperature distribution in the testing gage of the specimen and the relationship between T f and T s . Here we use G = max[( T s1 − T s2 ), ( T s1 − T s3 )]/ T s1 ( T s2 and T s3 denote the stable temperatures of the two side holes) to describe the inhomogeneity of the temperature distribution, and the result shows that G < 3%. To the authors’ knowledge, no other estimation on the temperature gradient in the specimen for the high-rate testing is available expect that reported by A.M. Lennon [23] , their analysis indicated that over 85% of the specimen length experiences less than 10% drop from the initial temperature during the test. So, the present heating method is deemed acceptable for the extraction of high temperature data. The temperature distribution in the input/output bar is shown in Fig. 6 , where X denotes the distance between the measuring point and the face of input/out bar at the connecting end. Because the temperature at X = 0 is hard to be measured (as shown in Fig. 2 ), an one dimensional steady conduction equation T ( x ) = T ∞ + ( T (0) − T ∞ )e − mx to describe this temperature distribution and extrapolate the data to X = 0. From Fig. 6 it can be seen that there is a thermal influence region of length about 18 cm, where the temperature is higher than room temperature. Out of this region, the temperature falls to room temperature. In the present apparatus, the strain gauges adhered on the input/output bar are located far away from the thermal influence region, thus the thermal influence on the strain gauges can be neglected. When the temperature of specimen is 1073 K, the temperature at X = 0 is no more than 540 K. Rosenberg et al. [22] conducted experiment in which the tips of the bars touched each other and were heated up to 673 K, the transmitted and reflected pulses were compared with those obtained at room temperature and the difference in the measured strain pulses was less than one percent. So, in the present research, the influence of the temperature rise in the bars is deemed negligible and no adjustment is applied in the data processing. In order to find out the influence of the friction between the copper conductors and the specimen on the testing result, two tests, one with the copper conductors and the specimen in contact and the other with them separated, were performed at room temperature. It was found that the obtained stress–strain curves are essentially identical, which indicates that the influence of the friction can be neglected. 3 Application of the technique to a commercially pure titanium 3.1 Material and experimental approach A 99% CP-Ti plate was received as the testing material, the chemical composition is given in Table 2 . The as-received plate was first annealed at 977 K for 2 h in vacuum, then cooled to room temperature. Metallographic examination of the annealed material revealed an average grain size of approximately 90 μm. Dynamic tensile tests (at the strain rates of 300 s −1 and 1400 s −1 ) were carried out on the above mentioned apparatus in a temperature range of 298 K–973 K, using the specimen as shown in Fig. 4 a. Quasi-static tensile tests (at the strain rates of 10 −2 s −1 and 10 −3 s −1 ) were also carried out on a MTS809 testing machine in the same temperature range. 3.2 Testing results and discussion The engineering stress strain curves ( σ e = σ e ( ɛ e )) of CP-Ti were firstly obtained from the tests, then these curves were converted into true stress strain curves ( σ = σ ( ɛ )) by the following formulation: σ = σ e (1 + ɛ e ), ɛ = ln (1 + ɛ e ). True stress–true strain curves are shown in Fig. 7 . It can be seen that temperature and strain rate have pronounced effects on the mechanical behavior of CP-Ti. For indicated strain rate, the flow stress decreases dramatically with increasing temperature, while the strain hardening changes little in a certain temperature range (about 423 K–623 K under quasi-static condition and 523 K–773 K under dynamic condition). Previous compression tests conducted by A.M. Lennon and K.T. Ramesh [23] found that both the yield stress and the strain hardening change markedly with temperature. They deemed this characteristic an important distinction between HCP metal (CP-Ti) and BCC metal, and deformation twinning was believed to play an important role to this behavior. Since the response of deformation twinning to tensile and compressive loading are quite different, the distinction of temperature dependence of strain hardening between tension and compression can be caused by this tension–compression asymmetry of twinning. In order to reveal the effect of deformation twinning on the tensile behavior of CP-Ti, the microstructures of the undeformed specimen and the fractured specimens are examined by optical metallography. The optical micrographs from different strain rates and temperature are shown in Fig. 8 . The undeformed specimen is free of any deformation twinning. For the fractured specimens, it's clear that a large number of deformation twins appear at room temperature, and the density of twin increases with strain rate. As the temperature increases, the number of twin decreases dramatically. At 423 K, only a fraction of grains are twinned at strain rate 1400 s −1 and even fewer grains are twinned at strain rate 0.01 s −1 . When the temperature reaches 523 K, very few number of twins exist at strain rate 1400 s −1 and no twin can be observed at strain rate 0.01 s −1 (not shown in Fig. 8 ). Previous study [24] on the compressive behavior of CP-Ti also revealed that the density of deformation twin decreases with increasing temperature and decreasing strain rate. However, deformation twin is observed at nearly all testing temperatures (77 K–1000 K) in compression tests. Compared with the present results, it seems deformation twinning is more likely to occur under compressive loading condition. In the case where slip and twinning are co-existent in a deformed specimen, the shear strain involved in twinning may give a lower strain hardening. On the other hand, twinning may divide the grains thus reduce the effective slip distance and thereby raise the hardening rate [25] . It can be seen in Fig. 7 that in an indicated strain rate, the strain hardening rate at room temperature is obviously higher than those at higher temperature. Considering the difference of twin density at various temperatures as shown in Fig. 8 , the present results seem to indicate that the main function of deformation twin is to raise the strain hardening rate by the grain-refined mechanism. Under dynamic conditions, the total elongation firstly decreases with temperature, then increases with it ( Fig. 9 ). Based on the above metallographic observation, the decrease of total elongation is probably caused by the reduction of deformation twins. As the temperature increases, the number of deformation twins decreases thus reduces the strain hardening rate. Smaller strain hardening rate is apt to cause local deformation, and leads to a decreasing of total elongation. Under quasi-static condition, the total elongation shows a trend of decreasing–increasing–decreasing–increasing with increasing temperature ( Fig. 9 ). The reason for the first decreasing of total elongation is as mentioned above. The second decreasing appears at the “blue brittle” temperature [26] , this “blue brittle” temperature increases with strain rate, which makes the second decreasing of total elongation disappear at dynamic condition. The quasi-static stress–strain curves show no obvious yield point at all testing temperatures. On the contrary, the curves under dynamic conditions show more complicated yield behaviors: At ε ˙ = 300   s − 1 , no obvious yield point can be seen when T s < 693 K, a yield point appears when T s = 693 K and this yield point is replaced by a more marked single yield drop when T s > 693 K. At ε ˙ = 1400   s − 1 , an obvious yield point appears at T s = 623 K, and when T s > 623 K, stress oscillation with multiple peaks appears after the yield drop. Harding [27] observed the similar flow stress oscillation in dynamic compressive tests on CP-Ti at room temperature and at 77 K, and attributed this oscillation to the effect of twinning. Considering that twinning is apt to occur under low temperature or high strain rate and the present stress oscillation tends to be pronounced at higher temperature, it seems twinning is not responsible for this phenomenon. An exact explanation required further investigation. The temperature dependence of flow stress at various strain rates is shown in Fig. 10 . It can be seen that at strain rate 10 −3 s −1 , the flow stress appears to be temperature-independent in the temperature range 623 K < T s < 773 K. Compressive tests on CP-Ti [24] gave the similar result. In addition, under dynamic conditions, the flow stress is rate-independent when 693 K < T s < 773 K. The rate and temperature independence of flow stress is generally explained by dynamic strain aging. In suitable range of temperatures and strain rates, when the point defects are mobile enough to diffuse along with the moving dislocation, an effective drag will occur and result in the “abnormal” temperature and strain rate dependence of flow stress. The “blue brittleness” at quasi-static condition is also a feature of dynamic strain aging. 4 Conclusion By introducing a rapid contact heating device to the self-designed tensile impact apparatus, a high-rate high-temperature tensile testing system was developed for the experimental study on metallic materials in the strain rate range of about 200 s −1 –2000 s −1 , and temperatures up to 1073 K. A thorough calibration on the testing system showed that the present technique is capable of obtaining a stable and nearly homogenous temperature field in the testing gage of the specimen and avoiding a significant temperature rise in the input and output bars during test. Tensile experiments on the CP-Ti were carried out in a temperature range of 298 K–973 K and a strain rate range of 10 −3 s −1 –1400 s −1 . The testing results indicate that: (1) The density of deformation twinning rapidly decreases with increasing temperature, which leads to a noticeable difference of strain hardening rate of the stress–strain curve at room temperature 298 K and higher temperatures. (2) Compared with the existed compression testing results, the compressive loading seems apt to promote deformation twinning. (3) The total elongation versus temperature curves show multiple humps and valleys. However, there exist different trend between dynamic and quasi-static loading conditions. (4) The yield point shows a complicated temperature and rate dependence. Stress vibration appears at the high-rate high-temperature condition.

        "abstract": "Tectoridin (4',5,7-thrihydroxy-6-methoxyisoflavone-7-O-β-d-glucopyranoside) isolated from the flowers of Pueraria thunbergiana is reported to have less hepatoprotective, hypoglycemic, antiallergic and anaphylaxis inhibitory activity than its aglycone form tectorigenin. To obtain tectorigenin, tectoridin was hydrolyzed in the current study. However, practical limitations of tectorigenin do exist due to its poor water-solubility. To increase its water-solubility, tectorigenin was sulfonated with sulfuric acid (98wt.%) and mixed with saturated salt water to produce tectorigenin sodium sulfonate. Tectoridin and the two transfer products were identified by UV, IR, HPLC-MS, (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR, and the solubility of tectorigenin sodium sulfonate was increased about 9-fold than tectorigenin. Antioxidant experiments of tectoridin, tectorigenin and modified tectorigenin in vitro including reducing power, superoxide anion radical scavenging activity, hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and anti-lipid peroxidation were carried on comparing with ascorbic acid (Vc) or butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The results suggested that the antioxidant activity in all the experimental systems exhibited the same order as follows: tectorigenin sodium sulfonate>tectorigenin>tectoridin. Due to the high water-solubility and good antioxidant properties with tectorigenin sodium sulfonate, appropriate chemical modifications could greatly improve the biological activities of the naturally occurring products.",

        "abstract": "Transcription factors play an essential role in altering gene expression. A great progress about transcription factors has been made towards the understanding of normal physiological processes, embryonic development, and human diseases. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel KRAB-containing zinc-finger protein, ZNF569, which is isolated from a human embryonic heart cDNA library. ZNF569 encodes a putative protein of 686 amino acids. The protein is conserved across different species during evolution. Expression of ZNF569 was found in most of the examined human adult and embryonic tissues with a higher level in heart and skeletal muscles. The KRAB and ZNF motifs of ZNF569 represent potent repression domains. When ZNF569 is fused to Gal-4 DNA-binding domain and co-transfected with VP-16, ZNF569 protein suppresses transcriptional activity. Overexpression of ZNF569 in COS-7 cells inhibited the transcriptional activities of SRE and AP-1, which may be silenced by siRNA. The results suggest that ZNF569 protein may act as a transcriptional repressor that suppresses MAPK signaling pathway to mediate cellular functions.",

With enzymatic saccharification, 98.0% of starch was excluded from the raw herb, releasing saponins from the network structure of starch. Subsequently, the treated tubers were fermented with Trichoderma reesei under optimal conditions for 156 h. During microbial transformation, glycosidic bonds, which link beta-D-glucose or alpha-L-rhamnose with aglycone at the C-3 position in saponins, were broken down effectively to give a diosgenin yield of 90.6+/-2.45%, 42.4% higher than that obtained from bioconversion of raw tubers directly. Scaled up fermentation was conducted in a 5.0-l bioreactor and gave a diosgenin yield of 91.2+/-3.21%. This is the first report on the preparation of diosgenin from herbs through microbial transformation as well as utilizing other available components in the raw material, providing an environmentally friendly alternative to diosgenin production.",

Methods A total of 68 clinically stable MHD patients in Beijing Tongren Hospital were recruited for this study. Patients were divided into 6 groups according to platelet count. General conditions, routine blood counts and serum biochemical indexes were compared among the groups. Data were processed by using SPSS17.0 software. Results Dialysis age, blood urine nitrogen, serum albumin, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), white blood cell (WBC), blood hemoglobin were significantly different among the six groups. Multiple regression indicated that platelet count positively correlated with hsCRP (β=0.208, P<0.05), LDL-C (β=1.143, P<0.05) and WBC (β=0.631, P<0.05), and negatively correlated with serum albumin (β= -0.320, P<0.05) and hemoglobin (β=-0.271, P<0.05). Conclusion In MHD patients, inflammation-malnutrition state correlates to the increase of platelet count, which may be one of the mechanisms underlying the high risk of cardiovascular events in these patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oxygen is involved in the synthesis of ATP in cells for cellular metabolism, and the concentration of oxygen is also an important factor to control the physiological functions of cells. Physiological and pathological events of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells always occur under hypoxia condition, but the mechanism is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To overview the research progress of the biological effects of hypoxia on mesenchymal stem cells. METHODS: A computer retrieval of PubMed database, Wanfang database, Weipu database and CNKI database (1997-01/2011-10) was conducted to search the related articles with the key words of \"mesenchymal stem cells, hypoxia, hypoxia-induced factor\" in English and Chinese. A total of 1 120 articles were retrieved, and finally 48 articles were included in final analysis according to the inclusion criteria. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Hypoxia induction could reduce the apoptosis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells by upregulating the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and downregulating the expression of p53 apoptotic signaling. Hypoxia could increase the proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells by inhibiting WNT signaling pathway and bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway. Hypoxic tissue could induce the migration of mesenchymal stem cells to hypoxic region, the main signal pathways in this process include vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway, stromal cell-derived factor-1 signaling pathway and c-Met signaling pathway. Hypoxia could also increase the adhesion of mesenchymal stem cells mainly through the high expression of cytoskeletal proteins and cell-cell adhesion molecule. Hypoxia could promote cell differentiation by increasing the expression of angiopoietin-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor and other factors.",

The objective was to provide a theoretical basis for effectively using germplasm in soybean breeding and production. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that genotype, environment, and genotype by environment interactions were significantly different for each trait. The first three interaction principal components axes (IPCA) were highly significant, accounting for 61.28–70.00% of the total variation. The stability differed for the different traits. 50 cultivars with high general stabilities were identified. The general stability of Tokachi nagaha was moderate, as the stability coefficients (Di) of its seven traits were relatively high; this must be considered by breeders using this cultiva...",

Methods A total of 20 cases involved, including 13 cases of open injury and 7 cases of closed injury. Of them, there were penetrating injury in 8 cases, occlusion after blunt injury in 5 cases, traumatic pseudoaneurysm in 3 cases and iatrogenic injury in 4 cases. Patients with mild arterial wall injury underwent endovascular treatment using stent graft directly,patients with severe damage of arterial wall or contusion of intimal received endovascular repari by antigrade and retrograde access. Results The success rate of operation was 100%,and no amputation and death occurred in peri-operative period. Mean follow-up time was 12.8 months(range,3～24 months). Good blood circulation was observed in the affected upper extremities by Doppler examination,and blood pressure difference between both sides of the limbs was less than 10%. The ankle brachial index(ABI) of patients with lower extremity arterial injuries improved from 0.37±0.16 to 0.96±0.08 before and after endovascular therapy. Mild stenosis at both ends of stent graft was observed in 2 patients by CT during the follow-up. Conclusion Endovascular therapy with stent graft is a less invasive and safe, effective treatment for peripheral arterial injuries.",

        "abstract": "Volatile organosulfur compounds are the main components that contribute to the unique aroma of dried . They are mainly generated during the hot-air drying process, and cysteine desulfurase is the key enzyme in this process. Temperature may be an essential factor of volatile organosulfur compound production by influencing the expression of the cysteine desulfurase gene. In this study, the promoter sequence of the cysteine desulfurase gene () was cloned and analyzed using bioinformatics tools. A series of 5'deletion fragments and site-directed mutations of  were constructed to identify the element that responds to heat stress. Six heat shock transcription factor (HSTF) binding sites were predicted by SCPD (The Promoter Database of ) and three of the binding sites were predicted by Yeastract (Yeast Search for Transcriptional Regulators and Consensus Tracking) in . The results indicated that  was able to drive the expression of the  (Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein) gene in . Moreover, the fluorescence intensity increased after heat stress. The changes in fluorescence intensity of different 5'deletion fragments showed that the heat response region was located between -500 bp and -400 bp in . The site-directed mutation analysis further showed that the heat-inducible element was between -490 bp and -500 bp (TTTCTAGAAT) in . Our results provide molecular insight for studying the formation of volatile organosulfur compounds in dried .",

At 3 h, the neuron-like cells were identified by the immunocytochemical staining, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting.The two induced cells both displayed neuronal morphologies with long and multipolar cell projections, but BDNF-induced cells survived for a longer time than beta-ME-induced ones. The results of immunocytochemical staining showed that the two neuron-like cells expressed nestin, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), neurofilament (NF), microtubule-associated protein (MAP-2), but not glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). RT-PCR detected mRNA-positive NSE, NF and MAP-2 in the induced cells, with also mild positive GFAP mRNA. Western blotting identified also NSE expression in these neuron-like cells.BDNF alone may induce rat MSCs to differentiate into neuron-like cells in vitro, which have longer lifetime to better serve the purpose of transplantation and gene therapy for nervous system diseases.",

This zebrafish\n line was produced by a large-scale Tol2 transposon mediated enhancer trap screen that generated a transgenic zebrafish with\n a heart-specific expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged under control of the nppa enhancer. In situ hybridization experiments showed that the nppa:GFP line faithfully recapitulated both the spatial and temporal expressions of the endogenous nppa. Green fluorescence was intensively and specifically expressed in the myocardial cells located both in the heart chambers\n and in the atrioventricular canal. The embryonic heart of nppa:GFP line developed normally compared with those in the wild type. There was no difference between the nappa:GFP and wild type lines with respect to heart rate, overall size, ejection volume, and fractional shortening. Thus the excess\n expression of GFP in this transgenic line seemed to exert no detrimental effects on zebrafish hearts during the early stages.",

        "abstract": "Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction is thought to increase the risk of the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR), the leading cause of blindness. However, the molecular mechanism behind high glucose-induced RPE cell damage is still blurred. We reported that ARPE-19 exposed to 25mM glucose for 48h did not induce apoptosis, but senescence validated by SA-β-Gal staining, p21 expression and cell cycle distribution. High glucose also increased oxidant species that exerted a pivotal role in senescence, which could be relieved by the treatment with antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The accumulation of lipid droplets and the increase of lipid oxidation were also observed in ARPE-19 treated with high glucose. And the supplementation of free fatty acids (FFAs) indicated that lipid metabolism was associated with the generation of hydrogen peroxide (HO) and subsequent senescence in ARPE-19. PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway was shown to be responsible for the accumulation of intracellular lipids by regulating fatty acid synthesis, which in turn controlled senescence. Furthermore, high glucose induced autophagy in ARPE-19 with the treatment of glucose for 48h, and autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or bafilomycin further aggravated the senescence, accompanying by an increase in oxidant species. Whereas, prolonged high glucose exposure inhibited autophagy and increased apoptotic cells. Experiments above provide evidence that lipid metabolism plays an important role in oxidative stressed senescence of RPE.",

As an illustration of its application, the high-temperature response of the forging die steel 5CrMnMo at high strain rates has been examined. Stress-strain curves are obtained for this material at strain rates ranging from 230s-1 to 1200s-1 and at temperature ranging from 25 to 600°C, respectively.

For a topological system (X, T) and an invariant measure μ on (X, T), let H (X, T) (resp. H μ (X, T)) be the closure of the set of all entropy sets (resp. μ- entropy sets) in the hyperspace 2 X. It is shown that if h top(T) > 0 (resp. h μ(T) > 0), the subsystem (H(X, T), T̂) (resp. (H μ (X, T), T̂)) of (2 X, T̂) has an invariant measure with full support and infinite topological entropy. Weakly mixing sets and partial mixing of dynamical systems are introduced and characterized. It is proved that if h top(T) > 0 (resp. h μ(T) > 0) the set of all weakly mixing entropy sets (resp. μ-entropy sets) is a dense G δ in H(X, T) (resp. H μ(X, T)). A Devaney chaotic but not partly mixing system is constructed. Concerning entropy capacities, it is shown that when μ is ergodic with h μ(T) > 0, the set of all weakly mixing μ-entropy sets E such that the Bowen entropy h(E) ≥ h μ(T) is residual in H μ(X, T). When in addition (X, T) is uniquely ergodic the set of all weakly mixing entropy sets E with h(E) = h top(T) is residual in H(X, T).",

Methods The echocardiogram was used to observe the heart structure and function in maintenance hemodialysis patients. The characteristics of the patients were analyzed retrospectively. Results In patients for five years hemodialysis,the left ventricle and left atrium were enlarged,left ventricular compliance was reduced than patients for one year hemodialysis. The left ventricle diameter and left ventricular compliance was positively related to with the weight gain,percentage of body weight gain and serum iPTH level during the dialysis,and it was negatively related to inadequate dialysis. The left ventricular systolic function was negatively related toweight gain and percentage of body weight gain during the dialysis,and was positively related to inadequate dialysis. Logistic regression analyses indicated that the independent risk factors for the enlargement of left ventricle and the reduction of left ventricular compliance were weight gain,percentage of body weight gain,serum iPTH during the dialysis and inadequate dialysis,the independent risk factors for the reduction of left ventricular systolic function were weight gain,percentage of body weight gain,serum iPTH during the dialysis and inadequate dialysis. Conclusions In the patients for five years hemodialysis,the left ventricle and left atrium are enlarged,left ventricular compliance is reduced. Weight gain,percentage of body weight gain,serum iPTH during dialysis and inadequate dialysis are the independent risk factors for the structural and functional change of heart in maintenance hemodialysis patients.",

The prodrug could self-assemble into micelles which was not only enhanced the drug solubility but also prolonged systemic circulation. Bleeding time assay confirmed that the micelles have a better antithrombotic activity compared to diosgenin in vivo, and platelet aggregation assay in vitro got the same results. The low cytotoxicity of supramolecular copolymer micelles was confirmed by MTT assay against LO2/HK-2 cells and acute toxicity studies in mice.

        "abstract": "Gut microbiota has indispensable roles in nutrient digestion and energy harvesting, especially in processing the indigestible components of dietary polysaccharides. Searching for the microbial taxa and functional capacity of the gut microbiome associated with feed efficiency (FE) can provide important knowledge to increase profitability and sustainability of the swine industry. In the current study, we performed a comparative analysis of the fecal microbiota in 50 commercial Duroc × (Landrace × Yorkshire) (DLY) pigs with polarizing FE using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. There was a different microbial community structure in the fecal microbiota of pigs with different FE. Random forest analysis identified 24 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) as potential biomarkers to improve swine FE. Multiple comparison analysis detected 8 OTUs with a significant difference or tendency toward a difference between high- and low-FE pigs ( < 0.01,  < 0.1). The high-FE pigs had a greater abundance of OTUs that were from the Lachnospiraceae and Prevotellaceae families and the - and  genera than low-FE pigs. A sub-species  subsp.  could be an important candidate for improving FE. The functional capacity analysis found 18 KEGG pathways and CAZy EC activities that were different between high- and low-FE pigs. The fecal microbiota in high FE pigs have greater functional capacity to degrade dietary cellulose, polysaccharides, and protein and may have a greater abundance of microbes that can promote intestinal health. These results provided insights for improving porcine FE through modulating the gut microbiome.",

Effects of single-strain cultivation and co-cultivation of strains on biodegradation of valonia tannin were investigated. It was showed that both bioconversion rate of valonia tannin and yield of ellagic acid would be remarkably increased when co-cultivation of strains 1 # and 3 # was employed. The former is the strain that has faster degradation rate of tannin with weaker tannin with weaker tannin resistance; the later is the one that has stronger resistance to tannin with slower degradation rate. Co-cultivation at 28°C for 8 days results in 68% bioconversion rate of valonia tannin and 23% yield of ellagic acid, which provides an effective way to produce ellagic acid from valonia tannin.",

        "abstract": "Epistasis-nonlinear genetic interactions between polymorphic loci-is the genetic basis of canalization and speciation, and epistatic interactions can be used to infer genetic networks affecting quantitative traits. However, the role that epistasis plays in the genetic architecture of quantitative traits is controversial. Here, we compared the genetic architecture of three Drosophila life history traits in the sequenced inbred lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and a large outbred, advanced intercross population derived from 40 DGRP lines (Flyland). We assessed allele frequency changes between pools of individuals at the extremes of the distribution for each trait in the Flyland population by deep DNA sequencing. The genetic architecture of all traits was highly polygenic in both analyses. Surprisingly, none of the SNPs associated with the traits in Flyland replicated in the DGRP and vice versa. However, the majority of these SNPs participated in at least one epistatic interaction in the DGRP. Despite apparent additive effects at largely distinct loci in the two populations, the epistatic interactions perturbed common, biologically plausible, and highly connected genetic networks. Our analysis underscores the importance of epistasis as a principal factor that determines variation for quantitative traits and provides a means to uncover genetic networks affecting these traits. Knowledge of epistatic networks will contribute to our understanding of the genetic basis of evolutionarily and clinically important traits and enhance predictive ability at an individualized level in medicine and agriculture.",

Twenty rats with the total score less than 12 were divided equally into two groups to receive daily subcutaneous injection of 20 microg/kg of G-CSF for 19 days or the same dose of saline injection (control group). The rats in the two groups were also given intraperitoneal injection of Brdu10 mg/kg for 19 days. The neurological functions of the rats in both groups were examined on a weekly basis after MCAO and on day 21, the rats were killed to prepare frozen sections of the brain tissues for double immunohistochemical staining with Brdu and glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody to identify the neural cells newly evolved from the stem cells.The rats in G-CSF group showed better neurological function recovery than the control rats 3 weeks after MCAO (P<0.05). Obvious regeneration of the neural cells was observed around the infarction area in the rats receiving G-CSF treatment.G-CSF promotes neurological function recovery and neural cell regeneration after cerebral infarction in rats and can be effective for intervention of focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.",

        "abstract": "Deltonin, a steroidal saponin isolated from Dioscorea zingiberensis Wright, exhibits high cytotoxic activity in cancer cells. In the present study, the effects of deltonin on cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated in the MDA‑MB‑231 human breast carcinoma cell line. Following treatment with deltonin, the viability of MDA‑MB‑231 cells was analyzed using MTT assay and apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm) alternation and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was determined by flow cytometry. In addition, western blot analysis was performed to examine the expression of apoptosis‑associated proteins. The results demonstrated that deltonin induced apoptosis in MDA‑MB‑231 cells in a time‑ and concentration‑dependent manner. Apoptosis was associated with depolarization of ∆Ψm and time‑dependent ROS generation. Deltonin treatment also resulted in Bax upregulation, Bcl-2 downregulation, activation of caspase‑3 and ‑8 and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase cleavage. Decreased levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphorylated AKT were also observed. Results indicate that the proliferation inhibitory effect of deltonin is associated with its apoptosis‑inducing effect, which may correlate with ROS‑mediated mitochondrial dysfunction as well as activation of the ERK/AKT signaling pathways. Therefore, deltonin may be a potential chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of breast cancer.",

It is found that the mechanical properties of SiC fiber bundles are rate-dependent: the elastic modulus E, strength sb and the failure strain eb remain unchanged under quasi-static condition, while they apparently increase with increasing strain rate under dynamic condition. Based on the fiber bundles model and the statistical theory of fiber strength, a bi-modal Weibull statistical model of the strain rate dependence is adopted to describe the strength distribution of SiC fiber, and the Weibull parameters are obtained by the fiber bundles testing method. Consistency between the simulated and experimental results indicates that the model and the method are valid and reliable.",

        "abstract": "By using the soybean founder parent Tokachi nagaha and its 137 derived cultivars as materials, a genome-wide association analysis was performed to identify the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) underlying soybean yield and quality related traits at two planting densities. Results of ANOVA showed that genotype, environment, and genotype by environment interaction effects were all significant for each trait. The Tokachi nagaha-derived soybean population could be divided into two subpopulations based on molecular data, and accessions in each subpopulation were almost all from the same Chinese province. Relatedness was detected between pair-wise accessions within the population. Linkage disequilibrium was obvious and the level of intra-chromosome linkage disequilibrium was about 8370kb. A total of 40 SNPs with significant signal were detected and distributed across 18 chromosomes. Some SNP markers were located in or near regions where QTLs have been previously mapped by linkage analysis. Nineteen SNPs were identified both in low- and high- density planting treatments, indicating those loci were common and sTable Sixteen SNPs were co-associated with two or more different traits, suggesting that some of the QTLs/genes underlying those identified SNPs were likely to be pleiotropic.",

        "abstract": "In order to investigate the effect of strain rate and high temperature exposure on the mechanical properties of the fibre in the unidirectional fibre reinforced metal-matrix composite, in situ SiC fibre bundles are extracted from two kinds of SiC/Al composite wires, which are heat-treated at two different temperatures (exposed in the air at 400 and 600 °C for 40 min after composition). Tensile tests for these two fibre bundles are performed at different strain rates (quasi-static test: 0.001 s −1 , dynamic test: 200, 700, and 1200 s −1 ) and the stress–strain curves are obtained. The experimental results show that their mechanical properties are rate-dependent, the modulus E , strength σ b and unstable strain ε b (the strain corresponding to σ b ) all increase with increasing strain rate. Compared with the mechanical properties of the original SiC fibre, those of the two in situ fibres degrade to some extent, the degradation of the in situ fibre extracted from the composite wire exposed at 600 °C (hereafter referred to as in situ fibre 2) is more serious than that of the in situ fibre extracted from the composite wire exposed at 400 °C (hereafter referred to as in situ fibre 1). The mechanism of the degradation is investigated. A bi-modal Weibull statistical constitutive equation is established to describe the stress–strain relationship of the two in situ fibre bundles. The simulated stress–strain curves agree well with the experimental results.",

To enhance the spectral selectivity, a gold-grating structure is designed and implemented under the graphene layer to excite surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). The electromagnetic field with specific wavelength can be guided to and confined within the designed subwavelength structures. The graphene layer contacted by metal is slightly p-type doped due to gold grating, improving the interband transition rate of electrons. The built-in potential established in the contact region facilitates the separation of non-equilibrium carriers generated on graphene layer, leading to a photovoltage. With optimized structural design the photodetector exhibits excellent photoresponsivity of 1 V/μW at the wavelength of 9 μm.",

        "abstract": "Classical quantitative genetic analyses estimate additive and non-additive genetic and environmental components of variance from phenotypes of related individuals without knowing the identities of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Many studies have found a large proportion of quantitative trait variation can be attributed to the additive genetic variance (VA), providing the basis for claims that non-additive gene actions are unimportant. In this study, we show that arbitrarily defined parameterizations of genetic effects seemingly consistent with non-additive gene actions can also capture the majority of genetic variation. This reveals a logical flaw in using the relative magnitudes of variance components to indicate the relative importance of additive and non-additive gene actions. We discuss the implications and propose that variance component analyses should not be used to infer the genetic architecture of quantitative traits.",

        "abstract": "Body pigmentation in insects and other organisms is typically variable within and between species and is often associated with fitness. Regulatory variants with large effects at bab1, t and e affect variation in abdominal pigmentation in several populations of Drosophila melanogaster. Recently, we performed a genome wide association (GWA) analysis of variation in abdominal pigmentation using the inbred, sequenced lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). We confirmed the large effects of regulatory variants in bab1, t and e; identified 81 additional candidate genes; and validated 17 candidate genes (out of 28 tested) using RNAi knockdown of gene expression and mutant alleles. However, these analyses are imperfect proxies for the effects of segregating variants. Here, we describe the results of an extreme quantitative trait locus (xQTL) GWA analysis of female body pigmentation in an outbred population derived from light and dark DGRP lines. We replicated the effects on pigmentation of 28 genes implicated by the DGRP GWA study, including bab1, t and e and seven genes previously validated by RNAi and/or mutant analyses. We also identified many additional loci. The genetic architecture of Drosophila pigmentation is complex, with a few major genes and many other loci with smaller effects.",

        "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is a common risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem. We investigated the association between metabolic syndrome and CKD in a rural Chinese population.This was a cross-sectional study using data from the Handan Eye Study.4944 of participants aged ≥ 30 y were included in this analysis. Participants with metabolic syndrome had a higher prevalence of CKD (20.9% vs.15.8%, P<0.001) than those without. As the number of metabolic syndrome components increased, so did the prevalence of CKD (P<0.001). The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of chronic kidney disease in participants with metabolic syndrome was 1.293 (95% CI 1.093-1.529) compared with those without. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, high blood pressure (OR 1.348; 95% CI 1.122-1.619) and high fasting glucose (OR 1.501; 95% CI 1.235-1.794) were independently associated with the risk for CKD. Compared with participants without any component, multivariate adjusted OR for CKD was 1.316 (95%CI 1.004-1.723), 1.397(95%CI 1.038-1.882), 1.672 (95%CI 1.183-2.363) for those with 2, 3, 4 or 5 components, respectively.In this rural Chinese population aged ≥ 30 y, metabolic syndrome was associated with CKD.",

Localized surface plasmon is generated by patterned graphene structure with significantly enhanced incident light absorption. Broadband detection is observed from 10.5 μm to 16.5 μm. Moreover, the photoresponsivity reaches up to 1.717 A/W at the wavelength of 12.58 μm under 0° polarization, and the photoresponsivity is 0.212 A/W under 90° polarization. The tunability of photodetectors is achieved by changing gate voltage to modulate the chemical potential of graphene. The Finite Difference Time Domain Solutions are used to predict the performance of photodetector with different polarization angles for longwave infrared light. The polarization-sensitive, tunable and broadband graphene photodetector provides a promising direction for high performance longwave infrared detection at room temperature.",

With enzymatic saccharification,\n 98.0% of starch was excluded from the raw herb, releasing saponins from the network structure of starch. Subsequently, the\n treated tubers were fermented with Trichoderma reesei under optimal conditions for 156 h. During microbial transformation, glycosidic bonds, which link β-d-glucose or α-l-rhamnose with aglycone at the C-3 position in saponins, were broken down effectively to give a diosgenin yield of 90.6 ± 2.45%,\n 42.4% higher than that obtained from bioconversion of raw tubers directly. Scaled up fermentation was conducted in a 5.0-l\n bioreactor and gave a diosgenin yield of 91.2 ± 3.21%. This is the first report on the preparation of diosgenin from herbs\n through microbial transformation as well as utilizing other available components in the raw material, providing an environmentally\n friendly alternative to diosgenin production.",

        "abstract": "The future of personalized cancer treatments relies on the development of functional agents that have tumor-targeted anticancer activities and can be detected in tumors using imaging. However, application of these functional agents in the clinic has been limited due to inefficient drug delivery, low specificity for tumor imaging, development of drug resistance, low signal-to-noise ratio and safety concerns regarding potential toxicity. Currently, the most common strategy to develop these functional agents is to conjugate therapeutic agents with the appropriate fluorescent probe. The present study synthesized a novel mitochondria-targeted heptamethine cyanine (Cy) derivative Cy‑triphenylphosphonium. The newly developed compound exhibited stronger near infrared (NIR) fluorescence and reacted with bovine serum albumin. In addition, it preferentially accumulated in the mitochondria of cancer cells, as observed using confocal microscopy, and efficiently reduced cancer cell viability (IC50=3.04 µM). This novel multifunctional heptamethine Cy derivative, with cancer mitochondria targeting and NIR fluorescence imaging, may be promising as an alternative anticancer agent.",

However, the active constituents contained in DZW rhizomes and their pharmacological properties are not fully understood. The aim of this work is to determine and quantify the active constituents in DZW rhizomes using fingerprint technique, and evaluate its anti-thrombotic activity using inferior vena cava ligation thrombosis rat model and pulmonary thrombosis mice model after being gavaged with TSS for 1 or 2weeks. In the study, a chemical fingerprint method was firstly established and validated to quantify and standardize TSS from DZW rhizomes including parvifloside, protodeltonin, protodioscin, protogracillin, zingiberensis saponin, deltonin, dioscin and trillin. TSS extracted from DZW rhizomes were showed to have the inhibitions on platelet aggregation (PAG) and thrombosis, and prolong activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), and prothrombin time (PT) in a dose-dependent manner in rats. TSS also prolonged the bleeding time and clotting time in a dose-dependent manner in mice. The results indicate that TSS could inhibit thrombosis by both improving the anticoagulation activity and inhibiting PAG action, suggesting that TSS from DZW rhizomes have the potential to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases by anti-thrombotic action.",

        "abstract": "The targeted therapy of metastatic melanoma is an important yet challenging goal that has received only limited attention to date. Herein, green tea polyphenols, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and lanthanide metal ions (Sm) are used as building blocks to engineer self-assembled Sm-EGCG nanocomplexes with synergistically enhanced tumor inhibitory properties. These nanocomplexes have negligible systemic toxic effects on healthy cells but cause a significant reduction in the viability of melanoma cells by efficiently regulating their metabolic pathways. Moreover, the wound-induced migration of melanoma cells can be efficiently inhibited by Sm-EGCG, which is a key criterion for metastatic melanoma therapy. In a mouse melanoma tumor model, Sm-EGCG is directly compared with a clinical anticancer drug, 5-fluorouracil and shows remarkable tumor inhibition. Moreover, the targeted therapy of Sm-EGCG is shown to prevent metastatic lung melanoma from spreading to main organs with no adverse side effects on the body weight or organs. These in vivo results demonstrate significant advantages of Sm-EGCG over its clinical counterpart. The results suggest that these green tea-based, self-assembled nanocomplexes possess all of the key traits of a clinically promising candidate to address the challenges associated with the treatment of advanced stage metastatic melanoma.",

The polyphenol compounds in the three fractions were identified by UPLC-MI-TOF-MS. Six kinds of polyphenol compounds including cyanidin-3--glucoside, procyanidin trimer, and phlorizin were identified in F-I, and prodelphinidin dimer B, procyanidin dimer, and quercetin hexoside isomer were found in F-II. However, there was only procyanidin dimer identified in F-III. The in vitro antioxidant activities of the three fractions were also investigated.

        "abstract": "Tva is the cellular receptor for subgroup A avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV-A). The viral receptor function of Tva is determined by a 40-residue, cysteine-rich motif called the LDL-A module. Here we report the solution structure of the LDL-A module of Tva, determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Although the carboxyl terminus of the Tva LDL-A module has a structure similar to those of other reported LDL-A modules, the amino terminus adopts a different conformation. The LDL-A module of Tva does not contain the signature antiparallel beta-sheet observed in other LDL-A modules, and it is more flexible than other reported LDL-A modules. The LDL-A structure of Tva provides mechanistic insights into how a simple viral receptor functions in retrovirus entry. The side chains of H38 and W48 of Tva, which have been identified as viral contact residues by mutational analysis, are solvent exposed, suggesting that they are directly involved in EnvA binding. However, the side chain of L34, another potential viral contact residue identified previously, is buried inside of the module and forms the hydrophobic core with other residues. Thus L34 likely stabilizes the Tva structure but is not a viral interaction determinant. In addition, we propose that the flexible amino-terminal region of Tva plays an important role in determining specificity in the Tva-EnvA interaction.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the effect of food intake during hemodialysis on the change of blood pressure. Methods Three consecutive HD runs in 36 stable HD patients (n=108)were studied. Food intake (FI), body weight controlled FI(FI/BW) and ultrafiltration controlled FI(FI/UF) were calculated. The blood pressure before and during hemodialysis were recorded. The correlation of FI with blood pressure and with hypotension was analyzed. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the factors related to intradialytic hypotension. Results The mean FI was (0.11±0.30) kg.The mean systolic blood pressure(SBP) was (126±29) mmHg, mean diastolic blood pressure(DBP) was (65±15) mmHg, mean MAP was (83±18) mmHg. FI, FI/BW and FI/UF were not correlated with either SBP, DBP or MAP. Patients experienced hypotension in 54 dialysis runs (50%).There was no significant difference of mean FI, FI/BW and FI/UF in runs with hypotension with those without hypotension. Diabetes and large ultrafiltration were risk factors of intradialytic hypotension. Conclusions FI within a certain range has no significant impact on blood pressure and it does not correlate significantly with dialysis hypotension. Diabetes and large ultrafiltration are risk factors of intradialytic hypotension.",

        "abstract": "AbstractIndividual variation in alcohol consumption in human populations is determined by genetic, environmental, social and cultural factors. In contrast to humans, genetic contributions to complex behavioral phenotypes can be readily dissected in Drosophila, where both the genetic background and environment can be controlled and behaviors quantified through simple high-throughput assays. Here, we measured voluntary consumption of ethanol in ∼3000 individuals of each sex from an advanced intercross population derived from 37 lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel. Extreme quantitative trait loci mapping identified 385 differentially segregating allelic variants located in or near 291 genes at P < 10−8. The effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with voluntary ethanol consumption are sex-specific, as found for other alcohol-related phenotypes. To assess causality, we used RNA interference knockdown or P{MiET1} mutants and their corresponding controls and functionally validated 86% of candidate genes in at least one sex. We constructed a genetic network comprised of 23 genes along with a separate trio and a pair of connected genes. Gene ontology analyses showed enrichment of developmental genes, including development of the nervous system. Furthermore, a network of human orthologs showed enrichment for signal transduction processes, protein metabolism and developmental processes, including nervous system development. Our results show that the genetic architecture that underlies variation in voluntary ethanol consumption is sexually dimorphic and partially overlaps with genetic factors that control variation in feeding behavior and alcohol sensitivity. This integrative genetic architecture is rooted in evolutionarily conserved features that can be extrapolated to human genetic interaction networks.",

It has been previously reported that CED is caused by mutations of the transforming growth factor beta 1 ( TGFβ1 ) gene on chromosome 19q13.1–q13.3. Until now, seven mutations (LLL12-13ins, Y81H, R156C, R218C, R218H, H222D, C225R) in Australian, French, Belgian, Japanese, and European families have been reported and these data showed that there was no correlation between the nature of the mutations and the variability of the clinical manifestations. In this study, we found a Chinese family with CED and observed some intra-familial clinical variability and symptoms that became more severe with the age. A new TGFβ1 mutation (E169K) in exon 2 was identified in the Chinese family using polymerase chain reaction, direct sequencing analysis of PCR products and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. This mutation has not been previously reported in other countries in the world.",

Extract of Dioscorea zingiberensis C.H. Wright (D. zingiberensis) is demonstrated to posses activities for curing cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. However, there were few studies on anti-thrombosis activity of it. We investigated the anti-thrombosis effect of diosgenin from D. zingiberensis (Dio) in vitro and in vivo on inferior vena cava ligation thrombosis rat model and pulmonary thrombosis mice model. We evaluated the protective effect of Dio by measuring the platelet aggregation, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), prothrombin time (PT) and the venous thrombosis in rats and the bleeding time, clotting time and protection rate in mice. Results showed that Dio inhibited platelet aggregation, thrombosis and prolonged APTT, PT and TT in rats in a dose-dependent manner. They also prolonged the bleeding time, clotting time and increased protection rate in mice in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings suggested that Dio which contained 95% diosgenin had anti-thrombosis activity. Dio executives the anti-thrombosis activity through improving the anticoagulation function, inhibiting platelet aggregation and thrombosis.",

        "abstract": "We have determined the X-ray crystal structure to 1.8 A resolution of the Ca(2+) complex of complement-like repeat 7 (CR7) from the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) and characterized its calcium binding properties at pH 7.4 and 5. CR7 occurs in a region of the LRP that binds to the receptor-associated protein, RAP, and other protein ligands in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. The calcium coordination is identical to that found in LB5 and consists of carboxyls from three conserved aspartates and one conserved glutamate, and the backbone carbonyls of a tryptophan and another aspartate. The overall fold of CR7 is similar to those of CR3 and CR8 from the LRP and LB5 from the LDL receptor, though the low degree of sequence homology of residues not involved in calcium coordination or in disulfide formation results in a distinct pattern of surface residues for each domain, including CR7. The thermodynamic parameters for Ca(2+) binding at both extracellular and endosomal pHs were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry for CR7 and for related complement-like repeats CR3, CR8, and LB5. Although the drop in pH resulted in a reduction in calcium affinity in each case, the changes were very variable in magnitude, being as low as a 2-fold reduction for CR3. This suggests that a pH-dependent change in calcium affinity alone cannot be responsible for the release of bound protein ligands from the LRP at the pH prevailing in the endosome, which in turn requires one or more other pH-dependent effects for regulating protein ligand release.",

        "abstract": "Cancer metastases represent a major determinant of mortality in patients with cancer. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and its metabolites play important roles in tumor growth and metastasis. Overexpression of COX-2 have been found in various types of cancers including melanoma. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely used to inhibit COX-2 and can be a promising additive for the management of aggressive cancers. A novel pH-sensitive drug delivery carrier based on PEG-derivatized ibuprofen, MPEG-PHEI, was synthesized for dual delivery of anticancer agents and NSAIDs. This amphiphilic and biodegradable copolymer could self-assemble into core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) and the hydrophobic doxorubicin (DOX) could be loaded into the core of the nanoparticles. DOX-loaded MPEG-PHEI nanoparticles (DOX/NPs) could release DOX in endosome microclimate via micelle collapse and ibuprofen via ester bond hydrolysis. In vitro DOX/NPs showed comparable cytotoxicity to DOX·HCl and comparable inhibition of COX-2 to ibuprofen. More importantly, DOX/NPs revealed a significant in vivo therapeutic efficacy in both experimental subcutaneous tumors and lung metastasis model while decreasing the toxicity of DOX. This study demonstrated the advantages of combining NSAIDs with chemotherapy agents and provided a novel nanoparticle system for both primary and metastatic tumor treatment.",

Calcium binding sites are thought to be present in the complement-like repeats that occur in clusters in all members of this receptor family. We have expressed two such complement-like repeats, CR3 and CR8, from an alpha2-macroglobulin-proteinase ligand binding region of LRP, as well as repeat 1 from the LDL receptor and examined the metal binding properties and resulting structural changes of these three repeats using changes in tryptophan and terbium fluorescence and perturbation of [1H-15N]-HSQC NMR spectra of the 15N-labeled domains from LRP. We found that all three domains contain a tight calcium binding site at physiological pH and that calcium binding results in a major structural rigidification. Changes in tryptophan fluorescence and tryptophan-sensitized terbium fluorescence indicate that the calcium binding sites are located in homologous regions in all of the repeats. Differences in the details of the perturbations, as well as in the pH dependence of calcium binding, show, however, that each metal site is distinct.",

Naturally chlorinated emodin 1,3,8-trihydroxy-4-chloro-6-methyl-anthraquinone (CE) from fungi and lichens was found to markedly inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, especially common drug-resistant bacterial strains, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE). CE was confirmed to cause significant potassium leakage, cell membrane depolarization and damage to the selective permeability of cell membranes in bacterial cells, resulting in bacterial cell death. In addition, CE was shown to have a strong electrostatic interaction with bacterial DNA and induce DNA condensation. Thus, CE is a promising natural antibacterial pharmacophore against Gram-positive bacteria, especially common drug-resistant MRSA and VRE isolates, with a dual antibacterial mechanism that damages bacterial cell membranes and DNA.",

The new approach could not only recover 95% of diosgenin production, 95% of ethanol and 75% of cellulose, but also efficiently reduce 88% of COD in wastewater compared with the conventional method, which only extract diosgenin with discharging 80,000mg/l of COD into public sewers.

        "abstract": "Cataract is the leading cause of blindness with an estimated 16 million people affected worldwide. d-Galactose (d-gal) is a reducing sugar that widely distributed in foodstuffs, and studies show that d-gal could promote cataract formation by damaging nature lens epithelial cells (LECs). However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. In our present study, d-gal resulted in premature senescence of LECs, which was confirmed by determining the β-galactosidase activity, cell proliferative potential and cell cycle distribution, though apoptosis of LECs was not observed. We also verified that d-gal induced the impairment of autophagy flux by measuring the expression of LC3II and P62. Meanwhile, we found that d-gal induced mitochondrial dysfunctions of LECs through increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS), reducing ATP synthesis and mitochondrial potential (MMP), enhancing the concentration of cytoplasm Ca and permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. Metformin, as a potential anti-aging agent, suppressed the senescence of LECs by restoring autophagy flux and mitochondria functions. Nevertheless, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) scavenged ROS significantly but was not efficient in preventing LECs from premature senescence. Our data suggests that restoring autophagy activity and improving mitochondrial functions may be a potential strategy for the prevention of LECs senescence-related cataract.",

        "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptors which down-regulate inflammatory signaling pathways. Therefore, we hypothesized that alterations of PPAR functions can contribute to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-induced dysfunction of brain endothelial cells. Indeed, treatment with HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein decreased PPAR transactivation in brain endothelial cells. We next stably over-expressed PPARalpha and PPARgamma in a newly developed cell line of human brain endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3 cells). Tat-induced up-regulation of inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, CCL2, and E-selectin were markedly attenuated in hCMEC/D3 over-expressing PPARalpha or PPARgamma. These results were confirmed in CCL2 and E-selectin promoter activity studies. Similar protective effects were observed in hCMEC/D3 after activation of PPARgamma by exogenous PPAR agonists (dPGJ(2) and rosiglitazone). PPAR over-expression also prevented Tat-induced binding activity and transactivation of nuclear factor-kappaB. Importantly, increased PPAR activity attenuated induction of IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, CCL2, and E-selectin in hCMEC/D3 cells co-cultured with HIV-1-infected Jurkat cells. The protective effects of PPAR over-expression were reversed by the antagonists of PPARalpha (MK886) or PPARgamma (GW9662). The present data suggest that targeting PPAR signaling may provide a novel therapeutic approach to attenuate HIV-1-induced local inflammatory responses in brain endothelial cells.",

        "abstract": "Cardiac differentiation involves a cascade of coordinated gene expression that regulates cell proliferation and matrix protein formation in a defined temporal-spatial manner. The C(2)H(2) zinc finger-containing transcription factors have been implicated as critical regulators of multiple cardiac-expressed genes and are important for human heart development and diseases. Here we have identified and characterized a novel zinc-finger gene named ZNF322 using degenerated primers from a human embryo heart cDNA library. The gene contains four exons and spans 23.2kb in chromosome 6p22.1 region, and transcribes a 2.7kb mRNA that encodes a protein with 402 amino acid residues. The predicted protein contains 9 tandem C(2)H(2)-type zinc-finger motifs. Northern blot analysis shows that ZNF322 is expressed in every human tissue examined at adult stage and during embryonic developmental stages from 80 days to 24 weeks. When overexpressed in COS-7 cells, ZNF322-EGFP fusion protein is detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Reporter gene assays show that ZNF322 is a transcriptional activator. Furthermore, overexpression of ZNF322 in COS-7 cells activates the transcriptional activity of SRE and AP-1. Together, these results suggest that ZNF322 is a member of the zinc-finger transcription factor family and may act as a positive regulator in gene transcription mediated by the MAPK signaling pathways.",

        "abstract": "Steroidal saponins from Dioscorea zingiberensis are widely used in China for curing cardiovascular diseases. However, there was little toxicological information available on them.The study evaluated potential toxicity of the steroidal saponins and analyzed the metabolites in rats.For the acute study, the steroidal saponins were administered to kunming mice in single doses of 112.5-9000 mg/kg given by gavage. General behavior adverse effects, mortality and liver histopathological changes were examined. For the sub-chronic toxicity study, Sprague-Dawley rats were gavaged at doses of 127.5, 255 and 510 mg/kg/day for 30 days, then examined the biochemical and hematological parameters. Metabolites in serum were analyzed by HPLC-MS.The steroidal saponins caused dose-dependent general behavior adverse effects, mortality and liver histopathological changes in the acute toxicity study. In the sub-chronic toxicity study, 510 mg/kg/day of steroidal saponins increased total bilirubin (TBIL) in serum and decreased protein content in liver significantly. The metabolic process of TBIL in liver includes TBIL intaking, conjugated bilirubin forming, conjugated bilirubin excreting to biliary passage. Treatment with high dose of the steroidal saponins in vivo may lead to vacuolization of the cytoplasm of hepatocytes and canalicular cholestasis. In all doses used in the experiment, the steroidal saponins decreased aspartate aminotransferase (GOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) in serum and increased reduced glutathione hormone (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione S-transferases (GST) in liver. Diosgenin was the main metabolite in serum.The steroidal saponins did not show any sign of toxicity up to oral dose of 562.5mg/kg in mice. No significant changes of biochemical and hematological parameters in rats (except at 510 mg/kg/day), it was concluded that the steroidal saponins did not appear to have significant toxicity in their traditional uses.",

Male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups. Group1 was given on a weekly basis cecropins from Antheraea pernyi (3,000 Ua/ml) by gavage at 2 doses of 10 ml/kg body weight and exposed to subcutaneous injection of DMH at the dose of 20 mg/kg body weight. Group 2 was received weekly DMH only. Group 3 was given the cecropins by gavage at the same dose as in group 1. Group 4 was weekly exposed to subcutaneous injection of EDTA (1 mmol/L). All treatments were completed in a course of 18 weeks and the experiment was finished at week 33.MTT assay showed selective cytotoxic activity of the cecropins against the human colon adenocarcinoma cells line. The viability of the cancer cells was about 54% and 100% for the normal cells. There was a significantly lower incidence of large intestinal tumors in rats gavaged with cecropins (65%, P<0.01), but the tumor burden (tumors/tumor-bearing animal) and tumor mass index were comparable between the groups (P>0.05).The cecropins possess effective anti-tumor activity with no cytotoxicity against normal eukaryotic cells, and impede the neoplastic process in murine large intestines.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of hypoxia changes on proliferation and homing ability of rat BMSCs. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rat BMSCs were isolated and then cultured under atmosphere of 1% O2 (hypoxia group) and 20% O2 (normoxia group) respectively for 0-7 days. Cells for Transwell chamber migration were classified into four groups by oxygen concentration at culture and migration: 1%O2 culture and 1%O2 migration, 20%O2 culture and 1%O2 migration, 1%O2 culture and 20%O2 migration, 20%O2 culture and 20%O2 migration. Migrated cells were counted. Protein levels of integrin β1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in BMSCs cultured under different concentrations of oxygen were detected by western blot. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Migration and proliferation abilities of BMSCs were enhanced under the atmosphere of 1%O2 and the abilities were weakened under the atmosphere of 20%O2 (P < 0.05). Integrin β1 expression in BMSCs was increased under the atmosphere of 1%O2 (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that 1% O2 enhances the proliferation and migration abilities of rat BMSCs after transplantation.",

Moreover, the biotransformation process was explored by LC-MS and LC-MS/MS analysis. Enzymatic hydrolysis\n together with 40 % of the original sulphuric acid used increased the diosgenin yield by 15.4 ± 2.7% than traditional method.\n Therefore, the commercial cellulase may serve as a promising tool for industrial diosgenin production and for further use\n in saponin modification.",

        "abstract": "Alcohol abuse and alcoholism are significant public health problems, but the genetic basis for individual variation in alcohol sensitivity remains poorly understood. Drosophila melanogaster presents a powerful model system for dissecting the genetic underpinnings that determine individual variation in alcohol-related phenotypes. We performed genome wide association analyses for alcohol sensitivity using the sequenced, inbred lines of the D. melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) together with extreme QTL mapping in an advanced intercross population derived from sensitive and resistant DGRP lines.The DGRP harbors substantial genetic variation for alcohol sensitivity and tolerance. We identified 247 candidate genes affecting alcohol sensitivity in the DGRP or the DGRP-derived advanced intercross population, some of which met a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold, while others occurred among the top candidate genes associated with variation in alcohol sensitivity in multiple analyses. Among these were candidate genes associated with development and function of the nervous system, including several genes in the Dopamine decarboxylase (Ddc) cluster involved in catecholamine synthesis. We found that 58 of these genes formed a genetic interaction network. We verified candidate genes using mutational analysis, targeted gene disruption through RNAi knock-down and transcriptional profiling. Two-thirds of the candidate genes have been implicated in previous Drosophila, mouse and human studies of alcohol-related phenotypes.Individual variation in alcohol sensitivity in Drosophila is highly polygenic and in part determined by variation in evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways that are associated with catecholamine neurotransmitter biosynthesis and early development of the nervous system.",

        "title": "Effects of heat-treatment and strain rate on the mechanical properties of SiC/Al composite wires—experimental and constitutive modeling",
        "abstract": "In order to investigate the effects of heat-treatment and strain rate on the mechanical properties of SiC/Al composite wires, tensile tests at different strain rates (0.001, 200, 700 and 1200 s −1 ) were carried out on two kinds of SiC/Al composite wires with different heat-treatment (composite wire 1: exposed at 400 °C for 40 min; composite wire 2: exposed at 600 °C for 40 min), and the stress–strain curves were obtained. The experimental results show that both of the two composite wires are rate dependent, their modulus, strength, and unstable strain all increase with increasing strain rate; the rate sensitivity is due to that of both the matrix and the fiber. The heat-treatment temperature also significantly affects the mechanical properties of the composite wire, since the strength of the composite wire 2 is about 42–46% lower than that of the composite wire 1. The mechanism of this effect is discussed. A bi-modal Weibull elastic–plastic coated-fiber-bundles model is established to describe the rate-dependent stress–strain relationship of SiC/Al composite wire, which fits the experimental results well. Keywords A. Metal–matrix composites (MMCs) B. Impact behavior C. Statistical properties/methods Heat treatment 1 Introduction Fiber reinforced metal–matrix composites (FRMMC) have the potential to provide desirable mechanical properties, including high specific stiffness, lower density, high strength, high creep resistance and good oxidation and corrosion resistance. These properties make FRMMC attractive for a wide range of applications in automobile, aerospace and defense industries. For instance, light armoured vehicles, unmanned air vehicles and littoral ships have successfully exploited such composites to reduce overall weight and increase manoeuvrability. Largely driven by these applications, extensive theoretical and experimental studies have been made in recent years to uncover the mechanics and mechanisms underlying the macroscopic behavior of FRMMC [1–3] . There are several methods in FRMMC manufacturing. In one of the most important methods, the pre-form composite wires are firstly made, and then pressed into structures [4] under high temperature. It has been reported that temperature and fiber exposure time significantly affect the properties of the composite wires during the first process [3,5] . So, in order to get a full knowledge of the temperature effect on the final properties of FRMMC, the influence of temperature on the composite wire in the second process will be investigated in the present paper. The mechanical response (such as strength and fracture) of FRMMC, like many other materials, depends on the rate of deformation [6] . In the past decades, the mechanical behavior of FRMMC has usually been characterized in terms of quasi-static loading [7,8] , and the influence of high strain rate on the material has received relatively little attention. However, many structural applications made of FRMMC endure dynamic loading, so a better understanding of the dynamic behavior of such materials is required to provide the basis for more sophisticated design for high rate service. Recently, Zhou et al. [3] studied the tensile behavior of T300/Al and M40J/Al composite wires and their components in a large range of strain rate (from 0.001 to 1300 s −1 ). The results showed that T300 and M40J carbon fibers are strain-rate independent, while T300/Al and M40J/Al composite wires are rate dependent, this is caused by the rate dependence of Al matrix. For the SiC/Al, it has been found that both the original and in situ SiC fibers (fibers which are extracted from the SiC/Al composite wire) are rate-sensitive [9,10] , so the rate dependence of SiC/Al is expected to be influence by both the rate dependence of fiber and Al matrix. The purpose of the present work is to investigate the effects of heat-treatment and strain rate on the mechanical properties of SiC/Al composite wires. The composite wires used in the present paper are Nicalon SiC fiber reinforced Al matrix. Two groups of composite wires, which are exposed in 400 and 600 °C, respectively for 40 min, were tensile tested at different strain rates. The effects of rate dependence of both fiber and matrix on that of the SiC/Al, and the effects of high temperature exposure on the mechanical properties of the SiC/Al are discussed. Meanwhile, a rate-dependent constitutive model is proposed to describe the stress–strain relation of this material. 2 Experimental 2.1 Specimen The two kinds of specimens used in the present study were made by heat-treating a kind of SiC/Al composite wire at two different temperatures. The composite wires were produced by the ultrasonic liquid infiltration method [11] . Then they were exposed in the air at 400 and 600 °C for 40 min, respectively, and cooled down to the room temperature. Hereafter, the composite wires exposed at 400 and 600 °C are referred to as composite wire 1 and composite wire 2, respectively. The as received fiber bundle used to prepare the composite wire was Nicalon SiC fiber bundle, which was produced by Nippon Carbon Co. Ltd, with the trademark NLM202. Each bundle contained 500 fibers and had a cross-sectional area of 8.667×10 −2 mm 2 . The density of the fiber was 2.537 g/cm 3 . The matrix was a commercial pure aluminum (>99.6 wt% purity), and the volume fraction of fiber in the composite wire was 50%. 2.2 Testing method Quasi-static (strain rate: 0.001 s −1 ) and dynamic tensile tests (strain rate: 200, 700 and 1200 s −1 ) were performed at a Shimazu DT-5000 testing machine and a self-designed Split Hopkinson Tension Bar [12] , respectively. The specimen and its connection are shown in Fig. 1 . First the lining blocks (1) were glued on the supplement plate (2) perpendicularly. Then 10 composite wires (3) were put into the slot of the lining blocks in parallel, glued with the blocks by high shear strength adhesive and covered with a metal plate. Finally, blocks were connected to the slots in the ends of incident bar (4) and transmitted bar (5) with the adhesive. The supplement plate was taken off before testing. By controlling the height and the range of input pulse, three groups of tensile impact tests (corresponding to strain-rate of 200, 700 and 1200 s −1 ) for SiC/Al have been conducted. In addition, the quasi-static tensile experiments were performed on the Shimazu DT-5000 testing machine for comparing with the above tensile impact results. The loading speed is 0.5 mm/min and the corresponding strain rate is 0.001 s −1 . The average experimental values and their maximum deviations at different strain rates are shown in Fig. 2 a and b (the symbols E , E 1 , σ s , σ b and US will be defined in the following section). 2.3 Experimental results and discussion The stress–strain curves of composite wire 1 and wire 2 at different strain rates are shown in Fig. 3 . The rear part of the quasi-static stress–strain curves cannot be obtained due to the limitation of the sampling rate. It can be seen that both of the two composite wires are rate dependent, their ‘yield stress’ σ s under high strain rate (the stress corresponding to the ‘yield point’ on the high rate stress–strain curve), strength σ b (the maximal stress on the stress–strain curve), unstable strain US (the strain corresponding to the strength σ b ), initial modulus E (the modulus before the ‘yield point’) and E 1 (the modulus immediately follow the ‘yield point’) all increase with increasing strain rate. Compared with the quasi-static stress–strain curve, a ‘yield point’ can be seen in the dynamic stress–strain curve. Before the yield point, the stress in the fiber is very low and the fiber fracture is negligible, which makes the curve appear linear. After the yield point, the curve exhibits a nonlinear character due to the accumulated fracture of the fibers. The yield point is supposed to be caused by the strain-rate hardening effect of Al [13] . Since the thermal expansion coefficient of the fiber (3.1×10 −6 ) is far less than that of Al (2.0×10 −5 ), the residual thermal stress will certainly exist in matrix and fiber during the high temperature manufacturing process. The quasi-static yield strength of pure aluminum matrix is rather low (about 80 MPa) and the matrix is apt to be tensioned to the plastic deformation state by residual thermal stress during the cooling process. Under tensile impact tests, because of the strain rate hardening effect, the stress–strain curve of aluminum will jump from quasi-static plastic deformation to the high strain rate plastic deformation. During the jumping process, the deformation of aluminum is elastic, as shown in Fig. 4 . That means there will be a new yield point on dynamic stress–strain curves. When using the linear hardening elastic–plastic model [13] to describe the stress–strain relationship of Al matrix under different strain rates, it can be seen that, the modulus of the composite wire before yield point approximately equal to the mean value of in situ fiber modulus [10] and matrix modulus, while the modulus after the yield point approximately equals to the mean value of in situ fiber modulus [10] and matrix strain-hardening modulus (the mechanical properties of the two in situ fibers are shown in Fig. 5 a–c). When comparing the mechanical properties of the two composite wires, it can be seen that there is a sharp decrease in strength when the exposure temperature rise from 400 to 600 °C. The strength of composite wire 2 is about 42–46%% lower than that of composite wire 1 under various strain rates. In order to further investigate the effect of exposure temperature on the composite wires, the as-received SiC fiber and the in situ SiC fiber extracted from the two composite wires were tested [9,10] , and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . It can be seen the mechanical properties of the two in situ fibers both decrease to certain extent when compared with the as-received fiber, which is probably caused by fiber damage during manufacturing and heat-treatment process [14] . However, the strength of in situ fiber bundle 2 (extracted from composite wire 2) is only about 4.5–11.5% lower than that of in situ fiber bundle 1 (extracted from composite wire 1) under various strain rates, which indicates that besides fiber damage during manufacturing process, other mechanisms which affect the mechanical properties of the composite wire arise during the heat-treatment process. The fracture modes of the two SiC/Al composite wires are shown in Fig. 6 . Wire heat-treated at 600 °C fails in a brittle manner without fiber pullout ( Fig. 6 a), while the failure of the wire heat-treated at 400 °C is typically of the fiber pullout type ( Fig. 6 b). It has been found that in FRMMC the brittle and the fiber pullout modes are corresponding to low strength and high strength of the material, respectively, and this is deemed to be caused by the detrimental effects of the interfacial reactions between fibers and matrix materials [5,16] . Studies on SiC/Al composites [15] showed that the rate of aluminum carbide formation due to interface reactions was directly related to the exposure temperature and could affect the mechanical properties. A high exposure temperature results in the formation of brittle reaction products that governs the failure mechanisms, as the formation of Al 4 C 3 in SiC/Al composites may provide sites for initiation of cracking that may cause composite failure. So it could be concluded that the obvious decrease in the strength of composite wires heat-treated at 600 °C should also be attribute to, at least partly, the activated interfacial reactions. 3 Constitutive modeling According to the coated-fiber-bundles model [17] and the stress–strain curves of the composite wires at different strain rates, an elastic–plastic coated-fiber-bundle model [3] is used to study the constitutive relationship of SiC/Al. In this model, the unidirectional reinforced SiC/Al wire is simplified as a coated-fiber-bundle with N coated fibers, and each coated fiber of length L and cross-sectional area A is made up by a single fiber surrounded by aluminum matrix ( Fig. 7 ). Assume that the coated fiber strength complies with the ‘weakest link’ postulate, i.e. the coated fiber is composed of links with different strength, and the strength of the coated fiber is controlled by the weakest link. Based on the experimental results, the strength distribution of the coated fiber is supposed to comply with bi-modal Weibull distribution (The detailed reason will be discussed in the following section.) [18] . In the present paper, a bi-modal Weibull constitutive model is proposed to describe the rate-dependent stress–strain relationship of the composite wire. The postulates of the model are: • The stress–strain relationship of every coated fiber are elastic–plastic, and the initial modulus and strain hardening modulus of each coated fiber are the same ( E 1 = αE ) ( Fig. 8 ). Coated fiber only fractures in plastic deformation stage and there is no coated fiber fracture occurred before yield point. However, the strength of each fiber is different from others. The coated fiber in the present paper is referred to as ‘elastic–plastic coated fiber’. • The interaction between coated fibers is neglected. As n coated fibers break, the load they carried before fracture is instantaneously distributed equally among the surviving N – n coated fibers, and the stress can be described as: (1) σ = { E ε ( ε < ε s ) [ ( 1 − α ) σ s + E 1 ε ] ( 1 − n N ) ( ε > ε s ) where σ s = Eε s , and for quasi-static condition σ s = ε s =0. The parameters in Eq. (1) are obtained from the stress–strain curves and can be simulated by the following equations: For composite wire 1 α = 0.73 (2a) ε s = 0.00052 ( ε ˙ 200 ) 0.316 E = 115 ( ε ˙ + 1.73 200 ) 0.0232 E 1 = 83.6 ( ε ˙ + 0.27 200 ) 0.0313 For composite wire 2 (2b) α = 0.73 ε s = 0.00038 ( ε ˙ 200 ) 0.361 E = 105 ( ε ˙ + 40.09 200 ) 0.0156 E 1 = 71.5 ( ε ˙ + 34.85 200 ) 0.0338 • The strength of the coated fiber follows the bi-modal Weibull distribution, that is (3) H ( ε ) = n N = 1 − exp { − [ ( 1 − α ) σ s + E 1 ε σ 01 ] β 1 − [ ( 1 − α ) σ s + E 1 ε σ 02 ] β 2 } ( ε > ε s ) where σ 01 and σ 02 are scale parameters, β 1 and β 2 are shape parameters. From Eqs. (1) and (3) , the stress–strain equation of the coated-fiber-bundles can be rewritten as: (4) σ = { E ε ( ε < ε s ) [ ( 1 − α ) σ s + E 1 ε ] exp { − [ ( 1 − α ) σ s + E 1 ε σ 01 ] β 1 − [ ( 1 − α ) σ s + E 1 ε σ 02 ] β 2 } ( ε > ε s ) Eq. (4) is the constitutive equation for unidirectional metal matrix composite wires. Use Ln ( ( 1 − α ) σ s + E 1 ε ) as abscissa, Ln [ Ln ( 1 / 1 − H ) ] as ordinate, and H = n / N = σ / [ ( 1 − α ) σ s + E 1 ε ] for ε > ε s , the Weibull plot can be obtained based on the experimental results, as shown in Fig. 9 . It is shown that the Weibull plots of the coated-fiber-bundle under different strain rates are characterized by competition between two lines. It was reported that if there are several kinds of defects in fiber, it is too rough to describe the strength distribution of fiber with single Weibull distribution [9,10,18,19] . When there are two kinds of defects exit simultaneously, the experiment results on the Weibull plot appear to be bi-linear, as shown in Fig. 9 . It was also reported that the SiC fibers are broken in a brittle manner with two kinds of defects: surface and inner defects [19] . Since the strength distribution of the coated fiber is dominated by that of the in situ SiC fiber, we adopt, in this case, the bi-modal Weibull distribution to describe the strength distribution of the coated fiber. In Eq. (4) , the four statistical parameters σ 01 , σ 02 , β 1 and β 2 of the constitutive equation for the dynamic case can be determined by the regression analysis method [9] with Weibull plot, the results are shown in Fig. 10 . It must be noted that since the integral quasi-static stress–strain curves are not recorded, the upper portion of quasi-static Weibull plot cannot be obtained, so the statistical parameters of the constitutive equation for the quasi-static condition cannot be determined directly by the Weibull plot. In the present paper, an indirect method is used to get these parameters. Considering that β 1 and β 2 stand for the strength dispersion of the coated fibers [3] , we suppose that β 1 and β 2 are independent of strain rate, the average value of β 1 and β 2 under dynamic state are used as the initial values for the estimation of β 1 and β 2 under quasi-static state, then the nonlinear regression method [9] is used to get all the statistical parameters according to the experimental data. From Fig. 10 , it can be seen that the shape parameters change only slightly under different strain rates (with the average value β ¯ 1 = 0.96 , β ¯ 2 = 17.5 for composite wire 1 and β ¯ 1 = 1.18 , β ¯ 2 = 18.1 for composite wire 2), but the scale parameters σ 01 and σ 02 are rate-dependent and cater for the following power function (the relation between strain rate and Weibull parameters is shown in Fig. 10 ): For the composite wire 1: (5a) σ 01 = 5.7 ( ε ˙ + 48.14 200 ) 0.0781 σ 02 = 2.19 ( ε ˙ + 5.47 200 ) 0.0720 For composite wire 2: (5b) σ 01 = 3.02 ( ε ˙ + 55.00 200 ) 0.116 σ 02 = 1.08 ( ε ˙ + 18.46 200 ) 0.0673 Substituting the modulus, yield strain (Eq. (2a) and (2b) ), and Weibull parameters (Eq. (5a) and (5b) ) into Eq. (4) , the simulated stress–strain curves can be obtained ( Fig. 3 a and b). The simulated results consist with the experimental data well. 4 Conclusion 1. SiC/Al composite wire is a strain rate-dependent material, because of the strain rate sensitivity of both the matrix and the fiber. The modulus, strength and failure strain of this material all increase with increasing strain rate. 2. When the exposure temperature rises from 400 to 600 °C, the strength of SiC/Al suffers a great decrease. Besides the strength decrease of in situ fiber during temperature rise, the effect of the interface chemical product between fiber and matrix should be also counted. 3. Based on coated-fiber-bundles model, a bi-modal Weibull elastic–plastic coated-fiber-bundles model has been established to describe macroscopic behavior of the composite wires at different strain rates. The simulated stress–strain curves coincide with the experimental data well. The results show that elastic–plastic coated-fiber bundles model is effective and reliable.

        "abstract": "Explore the application of endovascular covered stent-graft (SG) placement in femoral pseudoaneurysms in intravenous drug addicts.We evaluated a consecutive series of pseudoaneurysm in intravenous drug addicts treated with SGs from August 2010 to December 2013.15 patients with 16 arterial pseudoaneurysms were enrolled in this study. All were males with a mean age of 36.9 years. Hemorrhage was the most common reason (93.8 %) for seeking medical care, and 3 of these patients were in hemorrhagic shock at admission. All patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics, and debridement and drainage were implemented after SG placement. 7 of the 13 cases which had microbiologic results showed mixed infections, while gram-negative bacteria were the major pathogens. Except for 2 patients, who were lost to follow-up, two new pseudoaneurysms formed due to delayed debridement, and one stent thrombosis occurred, none of the remaining cases had SG infection or developed claudication.SG placement controls massive hemorrhage rapidly, gives enough time for subsequent treatment for pseudoaneurysms due to intravenous drug abuse, and reduces the incidence of postoperative claudication. With appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics and early debridement, the incidence of SG infection is relatively low. It is an effective alternative especially as temporary bridge measure for critical patients. However, the high cost, uncertain long-term prospects, high demand for medical adherence, and the risk of using the conduits for re-puncture call for a cautious selection of patients. More evidence is required for the application of this treatment.",

        "abstract": "In order to investigate the immune protective efficacy and immune protective mechanism of the lipsome-encapsulated Helicobacter pylori (Hp) recombinant protein vaccines, the oral lipsome-encapsulated vaccines with/without CT were used. Phosphatidyl choline (PC) and cholesterols (Chol) were prepared using reverse evaporation method whose size distribution of folate liposomes was measured by electronic microscopy. BALB/c mice were divided into six groups and immunized by BPS alone, liposome alone, rUreB plus CT, liposome-encapsulated rUreB, liposome-encapsulated rUreB plus CT and liposome-encapsulated (rUreB and rKat) plus CT orally respectively once a week for four weeks. All mice were challenged by alive Hp three times in two weeks after the last immunization and sacrificed in five weeks after the last challenge. Hp was determined by the fast urease test. The bactrerial colonizing density semi-quantitation , the inflammation severity grades and activity grades of the gastric histopathology were observed. IFN-γ and IL-4 mRNA expression of spleen T lymphocyte cell in different groups were studied with RT-PCR. The lipsome-encapsulated vaccines were obtained successfully. The mean size of folate liposome was (0.7 ± 0.2) μm. Protective rates of BPS alone, liposome alone, rUreB plus CT, liposome-encapsulated rUreB, liposome-encapsulated rUreB plus CT and liposome-encapsulated (rUreB and rKat) plus CT were 0(0/11), 0(0/11), 58.3%(7/12), 54.5%(6/11), 63.6%(7/11) and 75.0%(9/12) respectively. Protective rate of rUreB plus CT was equal that of the liposome-encapsulated rUreB group (P > 0.05). Protective rate of liposome-encapsulated (rUreB and rKat) plus CT was significantly higher than that of liposome-encapsulated rUreB plus CT (P < 0.05). The mice gastrically inoculated with the latter four immune antigens had been significantly less infected by Hp and had mild inflammation of gastric tissue (P < 0.05). There was not significant difference among any vaccine group (P > 0.05). After Hp attacked, the level of INF-γ mRNA expression of every vaccine group was significantly lower than that of the PBS and liposome group (P < 0.05) while the level of IL-4 mRNA expression of every vaccine group was significant higher than that of the PBS and liposome group (P < 0.05). There was not significant difference among any vaccine group (P > 0.05). The lipsome-encapsulated vaccines can significantly decrease Hp coloning density and reduce inflammation degree in mouse model. The double- candidate vaccines have more stronger immune protective function against Hp than that of sigle-candidate vaccines. After Hp attack, the mice which infected without vaccine induce a predominant Th1 immune inflammatin response while the mice which have accepted vaccine can induce a predominant Th2 protective immune response.",

Ellagitannins concentration, initial pH, T. reesei and A. oryzae during the fermentation were identified as important process parameters effecting ellagic acid accumulation and the enzymes syntheses. These parameters were optimized by uniformity design to determine the optimum condition for ellagic acid production. Under optimum operational condition, ellagic acid yield could be arrived at 24%, when the fermentation run lasted 96h with an initial pH of 4.5, an ellagitannins concentration of 4gl(-1), T. reesei of 3ml and A. oryzae of 3ml. Meanwhile, it was found that the three enzymes activities correlated very well with ellagic acid yield, resulting in model with high coefficient of determination (R(2)=0.98). The results indicate that the mixed culture of T. reesei and A. oryzae is an effective approach to produce an enzyme system of degrading ellagitannins for ellagic acid production.",

        "abstract": " Our previous studies have demonstrated that diosgenin and diosgenin derivatives exhibit excellent antithrombotic activity via regulating platelet function and coagulation factor level. Platelets and blood coagulation system are highly associated with tumor hematogenous metastasis. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate whether dihydrodiosgenin (dydio) mediated-platelet inhibition or coagulation factor level modulation is involved in hepatocellular carcinoma cell (HCC) metastasis.  Cell viability was examined by MTT and colony formation assays. Platelet aggregation text and morphology were used to assess dydio's role on tumor cell-induced platelet activation (TCIPA). Scratch assay, adhesion assay and Western blot were used to evaluate dydio's role on platelet-mediated metastasis. Western blot and fluorescence detection were performed to clarify dydio's role on endothelial cell (EC) function. The mice lung metastasis model was constructed to investigated dydio's function on coagulation factor and platelet-mediated metastasis.  This study found that pretreatment with dydio caused a significant inhibition of TCIPA. Platelets exposed to dydio significantly inhibited their adhesion to tumor cells, meanwhile, releasates of platelets that pretreated with dydio led to diminished cancer cell proliferation and migration along with the increase of epithelial markers E-cadherin and loss of mesenchymal phenotype. Additionally, ECs pretreated with dydio suppressed factor VIII (FVIII) level which in turn restrained the activation of platelets and the adhesion of cancer cells or platelets to ECs. Interestingly, our study demonstrated that FVIII could promote HCC proliferation. In vivo study revealed that mice intragastrical (i.g.) administration with dydio significantly inhibited the lung metastasis of hepal-6 cells which is highly correlated with the altered platelet function and coagulation level.  Taken together, these results demonstrated that dydio altered platelet function and coagulation FVIII level, resulting in decreased metastatic potential of HCC. Thus, our study reveals that dydio exerts novel mechanisms of antitumor action beside its direct antitumor activity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Tungsten disulfide (WS 2 ) has been demonstrated for optoelectronic devices due to its favorable semiconducting band gaps, high stability and higher carrier mobility than other transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, the photoresponsivity of WS 2 -based photodetector is low due to the poor optical absorbance, which limits its application in high-performance photodetection. Here, we show an easy realized method to improve the responsivity of WS 2  detectors by Au nanospheres (NPs). The Au NPs concentrate free space electromagnetic wave efficiently by localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR), strongly enhance the electric field on WS 2  films. As a result, more carriers are excited with the assistant of LSPR. With optimized design, the detector exhibited several times to ten folds enhancement from near infrared to visible spectrum region, and reach an excellent high responsivity of 1050 A/W at the wavelength of 590 nm. Furthermore, the photodetector showed an excellent temperature stability after annealing at 300  ° C on air environment. The work provides a new way for high-performance and stable photodetector for extreme and harsh environment.",

We synthesized a new class of haloemodins by modifying a traditional Chinese medicine component, emodin. The novel haloemodin exerts strong inhibitory activity on bacterial topoisomerase I and DNA gyrase, and not on the topoisomerases of human origin. In principle, it shows remarkable antibacterial activities against laboratory and clinically isolated Gram-positive bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. We further expanded its antibacterial spectrum into against Gram-negative bacteria with the assistance of polymyxin B nonapeptide, which helps haloemodin to penetrate through the bacterial outer membrane. Finally, the therapeutic effect of haloemodin in vivo was confirmed in curing S. aureus-induced keratitis on rabbit model. With distinctive structural difference from the antibiotics we used, the haloemodins are of value as promising antibacterial pharmacophore, especially for combat the infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens.",

        "abstract": "In this study, polysaccharides from Stropharia rugosoannulata were isolated and purified by macroporous adsorption resin and ion exchange chromatography to produce SRP-1 and SRP-2. Preliminary structural characteristics of SRP-1 and SRP-2 were also investigated. Our results showed that SRP-1 was neutral, while SRP-2 was acidic polysaccharides. The molar ratios of monosaccharides in SRP-1 and SRP-2 were different, but glucose was the main monosaccharide. Both α-type and β-type glycosidic linkages were detected in SRP-1, whereas β-constitution was dominant in SRP-2. Both SRP-1 and SRP-2 had a (1 → 6)-α-D-glucan backbone. Furthermore, the antioxidant activities of polysaccharides against ABTS, DPPH and OH radicals were determined in vitro. The results indicated that SRP-2 had a stronger antioxidant capacity than that of SRP-1. Our results may be valuable with regard to the utilization of polysaccharides from S. rugosoannulata as potential pharmaceuticals.",

Methods The technology of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to detect MTHFR gene C677T polymorphism in 74 HD patients and 30 healthy controls. Results Mean age in HD patients without CVD was signifi- cantly lower than that in HD patients with CVD. However, mean levels of serum creatinine in HD patients without CVD were significantly higher than that in HD patients with CVD. The frequency of MTHFR T allele in HD patients with CVD was significantly higher than that in healthy controls (39.6% vs.18.3%, P<0.05). The frequencies of MTHFR TT genotype among HD patients with CVD, HD patients without CVD and control subjects were 20.8%, 12.0% and 6.7%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the distributions of MTHFR TT genotype (P >0.05). Conclusion This study can’t confirm that MTHFR TT genotype is one of the genetic risk factors for CVD occurrence in HD patients.",

Method A total of 99 MHD patients were enrolled in this study. Age, dialysis age, blood pressure, hemoglobin, blood glucose, serum creatinine, serum potassium, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, plasma albumin, iPTH and KT/V were compared between hospitalization and outpatient groups. The main causes and its related risk factors for hospitalization were reviewed. Result In the observation period for 24 months, 59 out of the 99 patients were hospitalized with a total hospitalization of 106 times, average hospitalization of 1.07±1.22 times/patient and 28.27±24.73 days/patient. The main causes of hospitalization were cardiovascular disease, stenosis of vascular access and pulmonary infection. Patients were older in hospitalization group than in outpatient group (66.6±12.62 vs. 56.63±13.16 years; P=0.00). Serum creatinine and plasma albumin before dialysis were lower in hospitalization group than in outpatient group (For serum creatinine: 804.05±226.01 vs. 954.80±226.35ìol/L, P=0.03; for plasma albumin: 33.13±4.16 vs. 37.30±3.33 g/L, P=0.000). Stepwise multivariate regression analysis showed that hypoalbuminemia and shorter dialysis age were the risk factors for hospitalization in MHD patients. Conclusion The important causes for hospitalization were cardiovascular disease, stenosis of vascular access and pulmonary infection, in which cardiovascular disease was the leading cause for hospitalization in MHD patients.",

        "abstract": "The present study evaluated the efficiency of ultrasonic and fermented pretreatment technology for diosgenin production from Diosorea zingiberensis C.H. Wright (DZW). The optimum extraction conditions were as follows: ultrasonic pretreatment condition, 20 min, 50 kHz, 100 W; fermented pretreatment condition, 30 °C, 3 d and 0.8 g yeast dosages per 100 g raw materials; acidic hydrolysis condition, 1.5 mol/L sulfuric acid, 4 h; petrol extraction condition, 5 h. Under these conditions, diosgenin yield could reach 2.30%. Scanning electron micrographs indicated morphology changes of materials during diosgenin extraction process. UV–vis and GC–MS analysis revealed wastewater from the new approach contained 20 kinds of organic compounds which were mainly acids, esters, ketones and hydrocarbons. The research indicated the new approach could not only increase 42.5% diosgenin yield, recover 81.6% starch and 50.8% cellulose, but also efficiently reduce 69.7% COD, comparing with the conventional approach. Abbreviations COD chemical oxygen demand HPLC high performance and liquid chromatography GC–MS gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry UV–vis ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry t R retention time SEM scanning electron microscopy Keywords Diosorea zingiberensis C.H. Wright (DZW) Diosgenin Ultrasound Fermentation Alcohol Wastewater 1 Introduction Diosorea zingiberensis C.H. Wright (DZW) tuber is one of the widely-used raw materials in the pharmaceutical industry for diosgenin production, a chemical used for the synthesis of adrenal cortex hormone, sex hormone, progestational hormone and anabolic steroid ( Huang et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2006 ). DZW tubers contain 1–5% saponin, 45–50% starch and 40–50% cellulose. Saponins mainly contain carbohydrate and diosgenin. The carbohydrates which connect with diosgenin by glucosidic bond are: d -glucose, d -xylose, d -galactose, l -rhamnose, l -arabinose, etc. In acidic condition, saponins could be hydrolyzed into diosgenin and monosaccharide. The pathway of the production of diosgenin was represented in Fig. 1 . Previous studies ( Cheng et al., 2009 ) showed that the conventional extraction of diosgenin from DZW tubers predominantly uses directly acidic hydrolysis to decompose saponins contained in DZW tubers by hydrochloric or sulfuric acid. As demonstrated by the previous studies ( He et al., 2006 ), the conventional approach could produce about 1.20% diosgenin with high concentration of COD (about 120 g/L) in the wastewater. In addition, many cellulose and starch of DZW were conversed into sugar and discarded together with wastewater, resulting in wasting of resources. So far, there has been few report of successful technology for diosgenin production, which is economic and eco-friendly. Ultrasound which is often complementary to classical methods is particularly useful in sterilisation, pasteurisation, extraction, emulsification, cleaning, cutting, freezing, thawing and filtration, providing reduced processing time and increased efficiency ( Chemat et al., 2004 ). Ultrasound-assisted extraction is a well-established method in the processing of plant materials, particularly to extract low molecular weight substances ( Hromádková et al., 2002 ) and bioactive substances from plants ( Rodrigues et al., 2007 ). The enhancement on extraction yield by ultrasonic pre-irradiation was attributed to the disruption of cell walls, reduction of the particle size and the facilitation on the mass transfer of the cell content to the solvent caused by the collapse of the cavitation bubbles ( Polade et al., 2009 ). The acoustic cavitation bubble by ultrasound is carried out above 20 kHz. The propagation of ultrasonic irradiation in liquid promotes a series of compression and rarefaction waves. Bubbles grow in successive cycles forming bubbles of cavitation which, at sufficient high power, reach an unstable size and collapse violently. The materials release of heat follows the formation of so-called “hotspots” reaching temperature and pressure limits of 5000 °C and 2000 atm., respectively. When water vapors, dissolved gas and/or organic substances are exposed to these extreme conditions, bond rupture occurs. Then, sonolysis (indicated as Eq. (1) ) generates hydroxyl radical from water dissociation: (1) H 2 O ⟶ Ultrasonic   irradiation H + ⋅ OH In the presence of oxygen, the perhydroxyl radical is also promotion to be formed as follows (Eq. (2) ): (2) H + O 2 → OOH The radicals formed are diffused in the dissolution, simultaneously with the hydrogen peroxide released from the combination of OH and OOH radicals (indicated as Eqs. (3) and (4) ): (3) 2 OH → H 2 O 2 (4) 2 OOH → H 2 O 2 + O 2 During the process, three zones can be described: the cavitation bubble, the supercritical interface and the bulk of the dissolution. For instance, the degradation of volatile compounds is carried out in the gas phase of the cavitational bubble and/or in the interface of the hotspots. Hydrophilic and non-volatile compounds, on the contrary, are principally degraded once the reactive radical species reach enough diffusion mass transfer in the aqueous phase. Several studies ( Méndez-Arriaga et al., 2008; Matthieu et al., 2009; Torres et al., 2007; Song and ŎShea, 2007; Pétrier and Suslick, 2000 ) have shown the decomposition of organic molecules-pharmaceutical, pesticides, dyes, etc. in water by means of ultrasonic irradiation. Scanning electron microscopy data proved that ultrasonic pretreatment facilitated development of microfractures and disruption of cell walls ( Sharma and Gupta, 2005 ). As shown in previous studies ( Hemwimol et al., 2006 ), ultrasonic-assisted extraction has been proven to improve the extraction efficiency by increasing extraction yield and shortening extraction time, comparing to conventional extraction method. However, little information about utilization of ultrasonic pre-irradiation on improvement of DZW processing for diosgenin production is available. The pretreatment on DZW tubers using fermentation ( Liu et al., 2005 ) before hydrolysis could increase diosgenin accumulation. Previous studies ( Wang et al., 2006 ) on the fermented pretreatment on DZW for diosgenin production showed that the extraction yield increased dramatically. In order to improve diosgenin yield, many technologies such as enzyme pretreatment technology, microbial fermentation technology and supercritical fluid extraction for diosgenin production from DZW tubers had been studied ( Lin and Ren, 2005 ). But when these technologies were applied to actual production, there were many insufficiencies ( Qiao et al., 2006 ). In this study, a highly efficient system for diosgenin production from DZW tubers by ultrasonic and fermented pretreatment combined with acidic hydrolysis was developed. The raw materials were ultrasonic pre-irradiated, fermented, acidic hydrolyzed and petrol extracted. The process parameters were studied by single factor test. Furthermore, the wastewater produced by the new technology was treated and fermented to produce alcohol and the finial wastewater was analyzed through UV–vis and GC–MS. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials The dried DZW tubers were kindly supplied by Tianhe Pharmaceutical Company, Yunxi, Hubei, China. These materials were ground by a pulverator (DJ-048 Pulverator, Beijing Huanya Tianyuan Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) and the powder was screened through a 60-mesh stainless steel sieve (0.45 mm). Angel high-temperature resistant and highly-active dry yeast was from Angel Yeast Company, Yichang, Hubei, China. Ninety-eight percent of diosgenin (Sigma, USA), 99.8% absolute ethanol (Merck, Germany), 120 # petrol (b.p. 80–120 °C) and other reagents were purchased from Changzheng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Chengdu, China. 2.2 The new efficient approach One hundred grams of dry DZW tubers were cut into slices, ground in a pulverator, and then passed through a shaking screen with 60-mesh to remove 10 g of fiber. Ninety grams of screen underflow was soaked in 350 ml water and ultrasonic pre-irradiated when the working frequency under 50 kHz and sonic power at 100 W (varying ultrasonic pre-irradiated time from 20 to 60 min). After ultrasonic pre-irradiation, the materials were held for 1 h. Then about 10 g supernatant fiber was separated out and 100 ml water was employed to wash it. Thereafter, fermented pretreatment was performed in an incubator (varying temperature from 20 to 50 °C, varying time from 1 to 7 d and varying yeast dosage from 0.2 to 1.4 g per 100 g raw materials). After carrying out ultrasonic and fermented pretreatments, acidic hydrolysis was performed in the boiling water bath (varying sulfuric acid concentration from 0.5 to 3 mol/L and varying hydrolytic time from 1 to 7 h). After acidic hydrolysis, the soil residue was separated from filtrate (raw wastewater) by vacuum filtration and washed into neutral using water. Petrol extraction (varying extraction time from 1 to 7 h) was carried out in the 500 ml reflux type Soxhlet column using 350 ml petrol. Extract was collected, filtered and dried. To indicate the efficiency of the new technology, diosgenin, COD and reducing sugar in raw wastewater were determined. In addition, the raw wastewater was fermented to produce alcohol. After fermentation, the COD and reducing sugar in final wastewater were also determined. 2.3 Conventional approach The conventional method could be described as following. DZW tubers were cut into small pieces (<5 mm), dried at 55 °C for 48 h. Dried and ground powder (100 g) was hydrolyzed with 1.5 mol/L sulfuric acid in boiling water bath for 5 h. The soil residue was separated and washed with water until neutral and dried at 55 °C for 12 h. The filtrate was discharged as wastewater. The dried hydrolytic tuber powder loaded in the 500 ml reflux type Soxhlet column was continuously extracted for 6 h using 500 ml 120 # petrol. Extract was collected, filtered and dried. In previous study, the parameters involved in the conventional processing have been optimized. The recovery of diosgenin was determined. Meanwhile, COD and reducing sugar in wastewater were analyzed. 2.4 Alcoholic fermentation The raw wastewater was deep brown in color and of pungent odor. It contained high concentration of COD and reducing sugar and its pH was less than 0.50. In the pretreatment of the raw wastewater, a quicklime dosage of 100 g/L was used as both the neutralizing agent and the precipitating agent and then the wastewater was centrifuged (4000 rpm, 30 min). After centrifuging, the supernatant was extract, and sodium carbonate was used to adjust pH. Fermentation condition was optimized and the best condition was as follows: 30 °C, 3 d, 2 g/L yeast dosage and pH 4.5. After fermentation, alcohol was distilled using Rotary Evaporators (R215, Buchi, Switzerland). 2.5 Chemical analysis HPLC quantitative determination for diosgenin was carried out in the reverse-phase on an HPLC/Diode Array (HP1100, a diode array detector G1513/87311, Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, USA) with detection at 210 nm. Firstly, sample was filtered (0.22 μm), and injected onto a Cosmogel C18 column reverse-phase column (415 cm × 4.6 cm, 5 μm, Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, USA). The mobile phase composition was optimized and the best composition obtained was water–methanol (5:95, v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. The diosgenin yield could be computed as follows: diosgenin yield (%) = diosgenin weight (g) after extraction/DZW tuber powder weight (g). Samples were assayed in triplicate and the data were given as mean value ± SD. COD in wastewater was analyzed using COD radiometer (COD-571, Beijing, China) with potassium dichromate colorimetry method. Potassium hydrogen phthalate (A.R.) was employed to prepare standard solution while potassium dichromate (A.R.) was employed to prepare oxidant. When the COD digestion instrument was preheated for 1 h, 2 ml sample and 3 ml oxidant were added to reaction tube. After digestion for 2 h, the reaction tubes were taken out and cooled until room temperature. Then about 1.5 ml sample solution or standard solution was added into cuvette and the concentration of COD was read through the radiometer. Reducing sugar in wastewater was determined according to government standard (GB/T5009.7-2003). Alcohol distilled from the fermented wastewater was measured by alcoholmeter (YBFJ110, Beijing, China). Recovery of ethanol (g) = the solid content of distilled liquid (g/ml) × the volume of the distilled liquid (ml) × the concentration measured by alcoholmeter (%). 2.6 Wastewater analysis 2.6.1 UV–vis analysis Wastewater was diluted and scanned with the UV–vis spectrophotometer (BECKMAN, DU800 nucleic acid/protein analyzer). The wavelength range was from 200 to 800 nm. 2.6.2 GC–MS analysis GC–MS was employed to analyze organic compounds by liquid–liquid extraction using CH 2 Cl 2 (chromatogram pure grade, Fisher Corporation, USA). Before extracting, the wastewater was adjusted to pH 6–7 and centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 15 min) to remove the precipitates. Then 50 ml supernatant was extracted in a separatory funnel using CH 2 Cl 2 and the extraction was repeated three times. The CH 2 Cl 2 phase was collected and dried using nitrogen. The 1 ml pretreated sample was analyzed by 5973N/A2973 GC–MS system (Agilent Corporation, USA). High purity He (99.999%) was employed as carrier gas at the flow rate of 1 ml/min. A DB-MS5 capillary column with inner diameter 0.25 mm and length 30 m was adopted in the separation system. The temperature of the gasification compartment was first set to 40 °C for 5 min, then raised linearly to 280 °C at the rate of 5 °C/min, and maintained at 280 °C thereafter. The electron energy was 70 eV and the electron double voltage was 1050 V. Molecular weight was scanned in the range from 45 to 450 Da. Organic compounds were analyzed with reference to the NIST02 mass spectral library database. Those compounds which covered more than 0.5% of the integration area by GC–MS were taken as the primary organic constituents. 3 Results and analyses 3.1 Studying the conditions of ultrasonic and fermented pretreatment technology for diosgenin production from DZW tuber In the present study, ultrasonic and fermented pretreatment technology was employed for diosgenin production from DZW tubers. Before the study, the main parameters independently influencing diosgenin extraction were investigated as ultrasonic pre-irradiated time, pre-fermentation time, pre-fermentation temperature, pre-fermentation yeast dosage, acidic hydrolysis time, sulfuric acid concentration and petrol extraction time. 3.1.1 Ultrasonic pretreatment condition Ultrasound, having frequency between 20 and 100 kHz, is now well known to have significant effects on the rate of various processes in the analytical laboratory ( Smain et al., 2004 ). Méndez-Arriaga et al. studied the effect of the applied ultrasonic power on the degradation of ibuprofen and concluded that a higher applied power lead to higher degradation rate in almost lineal relationship. Although more than 100 W of applied power should lead to faster degradation, it is not recommendable to exceed this value, because the piezoelectric generator of the ultrasound instrument could be damaged ( Ricardo et al., 2008 ). In this study, ultrasonic pre-irradiation was carried out in a SB5200DTD ultrasonic bath (Ningbo, Zhejiang, China) with a maximum capacity of 5 L when the working frequency was 50 kHz for different times (varying ultrasonic pretreatment time from 20 to 60 min). The output power of the generator was 100 W while the power dissipated in the medium was about 60 W, as measured by calorimetry. Fig. 2 showed diosgenin yield under ultrasonic pre-irradiation for 20, 40 and 60 min. It can be noted that the diosgenin yield under ultrasonic pre-irradiation for 20 min increased by 4.76% when compared with that of non-irradiation. But the diosgenin yields of those which were ultrasonic pre-irradiated for 40 and 60 min, decreased 2.19 and 3.51%, respectively. The result indicated that moderate ultrasound was helpful to release saponins from the fiber package, resulting in increase in diosgenin yield ( Han et al., 2007 ). The enhancement on extraction efficiency by ultrasound can be explained that the collapse of cavitation bubbles during ultrasonic pre-irradiation released enormous amount of energy, which was expected to damage cell walls and resulted in better contact with the extraction medium ( Seong et al., 2009; Aparna and Gupta, 2006 ). During sonication, the cavitation process caused the swelling of cells or the breakdown of cell walls, which allowed high diffusion rates across the cell wall in the first case or a simple washing out of the cell contents in the second ( Vinatoru, 2001 ). However, when the ultrasonic pre-irradiated time was too long, the diosgenin yield decreased. GC–MS analysis indicated the presence of smilagnenone and epi-smilagnenone after ultrasonic pretreatment too long. These results confirmed that ultrasonic pretreatment led to formation of byproducts with low volatility and high hydrophilic character, migrating to the bulk of the solution, and thus, they did not follow a degradation process by pyrolisis or OH attack. As depicted in Fig. 2 , the highest diosgenin yield could achieve 2.36% when the ultrasonic pretreatment was performed for 20 min. 3.1.2 Fermented pretreatment condition The parameters of the fermented pretreatment were investigated including temperatures (varying the temperature from 20 to 50 °C), times (varying the time from 1 to 7 d), and yeast dosages (varying the dosage from 0.2 to 1.4 g per 100 g raw materials). It can be observed in Fig. 3 a that diosgenin yield increased with increasing the yeast dosage. There was an obvious increasing trend when the yeast dosage increased from 0.2 to 0.8 g per 100 g raw materials, while the remarkably increasing trend turned to slight when the yeast dosage reached 0.8 g. As shown in Fig. 3 b, the diosgenin yield could be observed to have a significant increase with increasing temperature from 20 to 30 °C. However, the yield significantly decreased when the temperature was over 30 °C. Fermentation could improve extraction yield was attributed to that glycosidase in the tubers promoted saponins enzymolysis which increased diosgenin accumulation. But higher fermentation temperature could devitalize the glycosidase so that the extraction yield decreased. Fig. 3 c revealed that the diosgenin yield increased with increasing fermentation time. There was an obvious increasing trend in diosgenin accumulation when the fermentation time increased from 1 to 3 d. After that, the increase of diosgenin yield was slight and reached a plateau after fermentation for 4 d, and then appeared a slight decrease after the fermentation for 4 d. This phenomenon is probably because saponins were hydrolyzed into smilagnenone and epi-smilagenone when the fermentation lasting over 4 d. It can be noted in Fig. 3 a–c that the highest diosgenin yield can reach 2.60% when the fermentation was performed at 30 °C for 3 d with the yeast dosage of 0.8 g per 100 g raw materials. 3.1.3 Acidic hydrolysis condition The parameters involved in the acidic hydrolysis process, including sulfuric acid concentrations and hydrolysis time, were investigated in boiling water bath. The effect of sulfuric acid concentration on diosgenin yield was shown in Fig. 4 a . When the sulfuric acid concentration increased from 0.5 to 1.5 mol/L, diosgenin yield increased significantly. However, when the acid concentration increased from 1.5 to 2.0 mol/L, the increase of diosgenin yield was slight and reached a plateau. It can be noted that when the acid concentration exceeded 2.0 mol/L, the diosgenin yield appeared to be a decrease. This might be explained that lower acid concentration led to incomplete hydrolysis while the higher acid concentration resulted in disruption of diosgenin structure, even carbonization. The effect of hydrolysis time on diosgenin yield was shown in Fig. 4 b. The result indicated that the extraction yield increased with prolonging hydrolysis time, while decreased beyond 4 h. GC–MS analysis indicated the presence of yamogenin, yonogenin and tokorogenin after hydrolysis run more than 4 h. Therefore, the decreased yield of diosgenin can be due to the excessive long hydrolysis time. It can be noted in Fig. 4 a and b that the acidic hydrolysis presented the highest efficiency when the process was carried out in boiling water bath for 4 h with 1.5 mol/L sulfuric acid. 3.1.4 Petrol extraction condition Soxhlet extraction was always employed to extract organic compounds. In this study, 120 # petrol was employed as organic solvent to extraction diosgenin from the hydrolysis production. Petrol extraction (varying the time from 1 to 7 h) was carried out after hydrolysis in a 500 ml reflux type Soxhlet column using 350 ml petrol. The effect of petrol extraction time on diosgenin yield was shown in Fig. 4 . The result indicated that the diosgenin yield increased with the increasing petrol extraction time. When the extraction time lasted for 5 h, the diosgenin yield reached a peak, and then began to decrease. This was probably due to thermal degradation of diosgenin structure resulted from the longer extraction. Another reason was that with prolonging the extraction time, some diosgenin volatilized together with the solvent. According to Fig. 5 , the optimal petrol extraction time was 5 h. 3.1.5 Morphology changes of raw materials during diosgenin extraction The morphology changes of the raw materials during the ultrasonic and fermented pretreatment technology for diosgenin production were studied using scanning electron microscopy. Fig. 6 a showed the raw materials, which were non-treated, were tight irregular coupled of starch and cellulose. When ultrasonic pre-irradiated for 20 min, microfractures appeared and the link of starch and cellulose became relaxed, as shown in Fig. 6 b. As mentioned earlier, these changes in morphology were likely to be attributed to the damage of structure due to the cavitation energy. After fermenting for 3 d, most of the starch particle in the raw materials was disappeared as demonstrated in Fig. 6 c. This phenomenon was because the starch was fermented into alcohol and the previous ultrasound pretreatment also intensified this effect. Then nearly all the starch and most of the cellulose of the raw material were hydrolyzed into monosaccharide after acidic hydrolysis, so only several cracked cellulose can be observed in Fig. 6 d. 3.2 Comparison of the new technology with conventional technology The starch and cellulose in DZW tubers was hydrolyzed into sugar and discarded together with the wastewater during the conventional technology for diosgenin production, not only causing serious environmental pollution but also resulting in waste of useful resources as reported by Liu (2001) . In this study, the raw wastewater produced from the new technology was fermented to produce alcohol. The 18.6 ml alcohol could be obtained from the raw wastewater produced by 100 g DZW tuber powder, resulting in 81.6% starch recovery. The cellulose from the new approach was about 20 g (collected from the oversize product when sieving and the supernatant materials from soaked materials after ultrasonic pre-irradiation). The recovery of cellulose in the study was 50.8%, which could be used in many fields of industries and agricultures ( Li et al., 2006 ). Previous studies ( Li and Feng, 1999 ) on cellulose utilization were preparing them into carboxymethyl cellulose by alkalinization and etherification. In this study, the re-utilization of cellulose was not performed and it will be studied in the future research. As about 50.8% cellulose was separated out in the previous process which reduced the resource of sugar and the raw wastewater from the new process was fermented to produce alcohol, the COD and residual reducing sugar in the final wastewater was dramatically reduced. As the results depicted in Table 1 , the utilization efficiency of DZW tubers by the new approach significantly improved, resulting in 2.30% diosgenin, 81.6% starch recovery and 50.8% cellulose recovery with 58 g/L of COD and 16.8 mg/ml of residual reducing sugar in the final wastewater. However, the conventional approach produced 1.26% diosgenin, only production, with 147 g/L COD and 85.9 mg/ml reducing sugar in wastewater. The present work showed that the two byproducts had no adverse effect on either yield or quality of diosgenin. It can be noted that the new approach could more efficiently use natural resources with minimizing the sources of wastewater and pollution during the process. 3.3 Analysis of organic compounds in diosgenin wastewater 3.3.1 UV–vis scanning for wastewater UV–vis analysis showed that organic compounds had strong absorption peak near 280 nm. Absorption within this zone indicated the presence of aromatic structure, aldehydes, ketones, and conjugated unsaturated structure compounds in the wastewater. Since the UV–vis scanning method has limitation in detecting all the contaminants and organic ingredients in the wastewater, further analytic measures should be employed in order to provide more information. 3.3.2 GC–MS analysis for wastewater GC–MS showed the relative abundance of organic compounds in wastewater. It revealed that there were 29 kinds of organic compounds in the wastewater of traditional process while 20 kinds in the wastewater of the new process, as shown in the Table 2 a and b , respectively. The main organic compounds in the wastewater of traditional process were furfural and their derivatives such as 2-furancarboxaldehyde, 5-methyl and 2-furancarboxaldehyde, 5-(hydoxymethyl) which covered more than 60% of the total integration area. Certain other minor compounds, such as tyramine, pyridine, 2-butanone, 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)- and hexane, 3,3-dimethyl-, which covered less than 0.5% of integration area were not list in Table 2 a. As over 80% starch was conversed into sugar and fermented to produce alcohol, aldehydes were significantly decreased and the mainly organic compounds in the wastewater of new process were mainly acids and ketones such as benzeneacetic acid, 4-hydoxy-3-methy, n -hexadecanic acid, 9,12-octadecadienoic acid, 5-androsten-17-β-ol-3-one, and (1,1′-bicyclohexyl)-2-one. They were much easier to degrade, when compared with the traditional process. It should be pointed out that, due to the limitations of GC–MS method, not all the organic compounds could be identified ( Mondello et al., 2008 ). Further analysis will be carried out in order to explain biodegradation mechanism of the contaminants in our future study. 4 Discussion and conclusions In this study, we have investigated ultrasonic and fermented pretreatment technology for diosgenin production from DZW tubers. As demonstrated by the investigation, the diosgenin yield could achieve 2.30%. The optimal operating extraction conditions, resulting in maximum extraction efficiency, were found to be provided by 20 min sonication time, 3 d fermentation time, 30 °C fermentation temperature and 0.8 g yeast dosage per 100 g raw materials, 1.5 mol/L sulfuric acid concentration and 4 h hydrolysis time, and 5 h petrol extraction time. The final wastewater from the new approach contained 20 kinds of organic compounds, which were less organic in nature and easier to be degraded, when compared with the conventional method. According to the study, the new approach could not only increase 42.5% diosgenin yield, but also efficiently reduce 69.7% COD and recover 81.8% starch and 50.8% cellulose. The research indicated that the proposed system could be a technological-efficient and economic alternative to process DZW tubers in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.

        "abstract": "Epidemiology and genetic studies indicate that patients with telomere length shorter than average are at higher risk of dying from heart disease or stroke. Telomeres are located at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, which demonstrate progressive length reduction in most somatic cells during aging. The enzyme telomerase can compensate for telomere loss during cell replication. The present study sought to investigate the contribution of telomerase to stroke and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. Telomerase reverse transcriptase knockout (TERT(-/-)) mice and littermate controls with normal TERT expression were subjected to a 24-hr permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). The stroke outcomes were assessed in terms of neurological scores and infarct volumes. In addition, we evaluated oxidative stress, permeability across the BBB, and integrity of tight junctions in brain microvessels. Neurological testing revealed that TERT(-/-) mice showed enhanced deficits compared with controls. These changes were associated with a greater infarct volume. The expression of tight junction protein ZO-1 decreased markedly in ischemic hemispheres of TERT(-/-) mice. The brain microvessels of TERT(-/-) mice also were more susceptible to oxidative stress, revealing higher superoxide and lower glutathione levels compared with mice with normal TERT expression. Importantly, TERT deficiency potentiated the production of inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, in the ischemic hemispheres of mice with pMCAO. Our study suggests that TERT deficiency can predispose to the development of stroke in an experimental model of this disease.",

However, its mechanisms and in vivo anti-cancer effects remain unknown. In the present study, we evaluated the effects and explored the anti-tumor mechanisms of deltonin on a panel of colon cancer cell lines and in a mouse model of murine colon cancer C26. Deltonin had more cytotoxic effect on C26 cells than 5-fluorouracil had, promoting dramatic G2-M phase arrest and apoptosis in C26 cells in a concentration-dependent manner; oral administration of deltonin significantly inhibited the tumor growth and prolonged survival of the tumor bearing mice. The deltonin treatment caused a noticeable apoptosis in tumor tissue, which associated with increased levels of Bax, activated caspase-3, caspase-9, and cleaved poly (ADPribose) polymerase, decreased pro-caspase-8, pro-caspase-9, Bcl-2 expression levels and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 activity; and dose-dependently inhibit angiogenesis. In conclusion, the findings in this study demonstrated that deltonin is an effective natural agent for cancer therapy, which may be mediated, in part, by induction of apoptosis, as well as involve mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, and inhibition of angiogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Although magnetic susceptibility (MS) of sediments is widely used as an indicator in paleoclimate reconstructions, its significance is unclear in short-term environmental change in muddy sediments on the continental shelves of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. In the present study, we found positive and negative correlations between MS and the median grain size (MZ) of fine sediments near the Yangtze estuary and in the North Yellow Sea, respectively. These distinct relationships between MS and MZ depend on sources of materials thus can be used to study changes in material sources of sediments in the South Yellow Sea. According to these relationships, the positive correlation between MS and MZ in the central South Yellow Sea Mud before 1920 AD revealed the impact of materials from the Yangtze River; and the negative correlation after 1920 AD could be attributed to the changes of location of the Yangtze trunk stream to the sea. The inference of the geological change around 1920 AD was also supported by the abrupt change in trends of TOC/TN ratio. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Metallothioneins, an important family of cysteine-rich metal-binding proteins, have been isolated and well characterized. However, Lentinula edodes may have a different type of cadmium-binding protein that contains fewer cysteine residues. In the present study, we purified a cadmium-binding protein from L. edodes (LECBP) by gel filtration and anion exchange chromatography and then identified LECBP by LC-MS/MS. We found LECBP to be a novel cadmium-binding protein which contained 220 amino acid residues but no cysteine residue. LECBP had a high binding affinity for Cd (Ⅱ) with a Kd value of 97.3 μM. The percentages of α-helix, β-sheet, β-turn, and random coil in LECBP were 15.7%, 39.4%, 8.0%, and 37.1%, respectively. In addition, high temperatures and an acidic environment influenced the conformation of LECBP. Our results will thus provide a new perspective to understand the mechanism of cadmium accumulation in L. edodes.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of CKD and associated factors in a rural adult population in Northern China.This was a cross-sectional study using data from the Handan Eye Study. A total of 5,105 subjects aged >or=30 years were included in this analysis. Spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was determined. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated with the modified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. CKD was defined by the guidelines proposed by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative. The associations between age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, and kidney damage were examined.Albuminuria and reduced renal function were detected in 16.8 and 0.4% of subjects, respectively. The age-standardized prevalence of albuminuria, reduced renal function and CKD was 14.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 13.9-15.9), 0.38% (95% CI 0.21-0.55) and 15.2% (95% CI 14.2-16.2), respectively. The prevalence of CKD was greater in women than in men (16.7 vs. 12.9%, respectively, p < 0.001). The increased prevalence of CKD with increasing age was observed in both genders. Older age, female gender, diabetes and hypertension were independently associated with albuminuria. Older age was independently associated with reduced renal function.The prevalence of CKD in the rural Chinese population is relatively high. Factors associated with CKD are similar to those of urban areas in China and developed countries. CKD is a major public health problem in rural China.",

        "abstract": "AIM:To compare the clinical significant differences of the two adjustment dosages of the re- combinant human erythropoietin(rHuEPO)in hemodialysis(HD)patients with intravenous iron-dextran and o- ral iron-ferrous succinate supplementations.METHODS:Two hundred and sixty patients on maintenance HD with rHuEPO treatment,in addition oral and intravenous iron supplementation,were enrolled in a multi-center, prospective,randomized,controlled trial and divided into two groups.In intravenous group,iron-dextran 100 mg was infused through the veins of end dialyser two times per week for 5 wk,then followed by 100 mg·2 wk~(-1)for 12 wk.In oral group,iron-ferrous succinate 200 mg,po,tid for 12 wk.RESULTS:Two hundred and forty-nine patients completed the trial including 165 patients in intravenous group,and 84 patients in oral group.After 12 wk treatment,mean hemoglobin(Hb),hematocrit(Hct),serum ferritin(SF),transferring saturation(TSAT)in the intravenous group increased significantly greater than those in the oral group((21±s 13)g·L~(-1),0.07±0.03,(334±134)μg·L~(-1),(9±6)%,vs(14±27)g·L~(-1),0.032±0.010,-(9±73)μg·L~(-1),(0±9)%,respectively,P＜0.01).The dosages of rHuEPO used in the intravenous group were much less than those in the oral group((6530±2234)IU·wk~(-1)vs(8839±1922)IU·wk~(-1),P＜0.01). The effective rates in the intravenous group were higher than those of oral group(Hb:73.9% vs 43%,P＜0.01,Hct:78.8% vs 40%,P＜0.01).The rate of adverse reactions were 1.2% in intravenous group and 6% in oral group.CONCLUSION:Intravenous iron-dextran administration is more effective and safe than oral ferrous succinate intake for the treatment of renal anemia in HD patients,and saves the application dosage of rHuEPO significantly.",

        "abstract": "Cadmium bioremediation with metal-binding proteins is primarily conducted using metallothioneins (MTs). However, in the present study, we investigated a non-MT cadmium-binding protein from Lentinula edodes (LECBP) as a remediation tool for cadmium biosorption in E. coli. The results indicated that the expression of LECBP significantly enhanced the cadmium biosorption capacity of transgenic E. coli. The secondary structure and conformation of LECBP were changed after binding with cadmium as evidenced by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that carboxyl oxygen and amino nitrogen atoms were involved in the interaction between LECBP and cadmium. The results further demonstrated that glutamic acid and histidine residues are the potential binding sites. Our results have thus provided new insights into cadmium bioremediation in an aquatic environment.",

Methods The subjects included 100 officers and soldiers, whose Modified Fatigue Rating Scale (MFIS) scores were >21 points. The participants were randomly divided into two groups, namely, the amino acids capsule group and placebo group (n=50). Under the condition of military operations, either amino acids capsule (8 kinds of essential amino acids and 11 kinds of vitamins were contained) or placebo capsule was given for 14 days continuously. The humoral immune indices, i.e., IgG, IgA, IgM, and complements C3 and C4, were measured with immunoturbidimetry. The percentage of peripheral blood CD subsets was measured using flow cytometry on the first day and 14th day. Results The levels of IgG, IgM, and complement C3 in the capsule group were significantly higher on the 14th day than on the first day (P<0.05), and no significant difference of their levels was observed in the placebo group. The CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes and CD3- CD19+ B lymphocytes in the capsule group on the 14th day were higher than those on the first day, whereas the CD3-CD56+NK lymphocytes decreased significantly (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the placebo group. Conclusion Compound amino acids capsule can improve the humoral and cellular immunological function of naval servicemen.",
