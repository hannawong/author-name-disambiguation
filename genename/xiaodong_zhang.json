        "title": "TopBT: a topology-aware and infrastructure-independent bittorrent client",
        "abstract": "BitTorrent (BT) has carried out a significant and continuously increasing portion of Internet traffic. While several designs have been recently proposed and implemented to improve the resource utilization by bridging the application layer (overlay) and the network layer (underlay), these designs are largely dependent on Internet infrastructures, such as ISPs and CDNs. In addition, they also demand large-scale deployments of their systems to work effectively. Consequently, they require multiefforts far beyond individual users' ability to be widely used in the Internet. In this paper, aiming at building an infrastructure-independent user-level facility, we present our design, implementation, and evaluation of a topology-aware BT system, called TopBT, to significantly improve the overall Internet resource utilization without degrading user downloading performance. The unique feature of TopBT client lies in that a TopBT client actively discovers network proximities (to connected peers), and uses both proximities and transmission rates to maintain fast downloading while reducing the transmitting distance of the BT traffic and thus the Internet traffic. As a result, a TopBT client neither requires feeds from major Internet infrastructures, such as ISPs or CDNs, nor requires large-scale deployment of other TopBT clients on the Internet to work effectively. We have implemented TopBT based on widely used open-source BT client code base, and made the software publicly available. By deploying TopBT and other BitTorrent clients on hundreds of Internet hosts, we show that on average TopBT can reduce about 25% download traffic while achieving a 15% faster download speed compared to several prevalent BT clients. TopBT has been widely used in the Internet by many users all over the world.",

        "title": "The stretched exponential distribution of internet media access patterns",
        "abstract": "The commonly agreed Zipf-like access pattern of Web workloads is mainly based on Internet measurements when text-based content dominated the Web traffic. However, with dramatic increase of media traffic on the Internet, the inconsistency between the access patterns of media objects and the Zipf model has been observed in a number of studies. An insightful understanding of media access patterns is essential to guide Internet system design and management, including resource provisioning and performance optimizations. In this paper, we have studied a large variety of media workloads collected from both client and server sides in different media systems with different delivery methods. Through extensive analysis and modeling, we find: (1) the object reference ranks of all these workloads follow the stretched exponential (SE) distribution despite their different media systems and delivery methods; (2) one parameter of this distribution well characterizes the media file sizes, the other well characterizes the aging of media accesses; (3) some biased measurements may lead to Zipf-like observations on media access patterns; and (4) the deviation of media access pattern from the Zipf model in these workloads increases along with the workload duration. We have further analyzed the effectiveness of media caching with a mathematical model. Compared with Web caching under the Zipf model, media caching under the SE model is far less effective unless the cache size is enormously large. This indicates that many previous studies based on a Zipf-like assumption have potentially overestimated the media caching benefit, while an effective media caching system must be able to scale its storage size to accommodate the increase of media content over a long time. Our study provides an analytical basis for applying a P2P model rather than a client-server model to build large scale Internet media delivery systems.",

        "abstract": "Modern Internet streaming services have utilized various techniques to improve the quality of streaming media delivery. Despite the characterization of media access patterns and user behaviors in many measurement studies, few studies have focused on the streaming techniques themselves, particularly on the quality of streaming experiences they offer end users and on the resources of the media systems that they consume. In order to gain insights into current streaming services techniques and thus provide guidance on designing resource-efficient and high quality streaming media systems, we have collected a large streaming media workload from thousands of broadband home users and business users hosted by a major ISP, and analyzed the most commonly used streaming techniques such as automatic protocol switch, Fast Streaming, MBR encoding and rate adaptation. Our measurement and analysis results show that with these techniques, current streaming systems these techniques tend to over-utilize CPU and bandwidth resources to provide better services to end users, which may not be a desirable and effective is not necessary the best way to improve the quality of streaming media delivery. Motivated by these results, we propose and evaluate a coordination mechanism that effectively takes advantage of both Fast Streaming and rate adaptation to better utilize the server and Internet resources for streaming quality improvement.",

        "abstract": "The proxy has been widely and successfully used to cache the static Web objects fetched by a client so that the subsequent clients requesting the same Web objects can be served directly from the proxy instead of other sources faraway, thus reducing the server's load, the network traffic and the client response time. However, with the dramatic increase of streaming media objects emerging on the Internet, the existing proxy cannot efficiently deliver them due to their large sizes and client real time requirements. In this dissertation, we design, implement, and evaluate cost-effective and high performance proxy-based Internet caching systems for streaming media delivery. Addressing the conflicting performance objectives for streaming media delivery, we first propose an efficient segment-based streaming media proxy system model. This model has guided us to design a practical streaming proxy, called Hyper-Proxy, aiming at delivering the streaming media data to clients with minimum playback jitter and a small startup latency, while achieving high caching performance. Second, we have implemented Hyper-Proxy by leveraging the existing Internet infrastructure. Hyper-Proxy enables the streaming service on the common Web servers. The evaluation of Hyper-Proxy on the global Internet environment and the local network environment shows it can provide satisfying streaming performance to clients while maintaining a good cache performance. Finally, to further improve the streaming delivery efficiency, we propose a group of the Shared Running Buffers (SRB) based proxy caching techniques to effectively utilize proxy's memory. SRB algorithms can significantly reduce the media server/proxy's load and network traffic and relieve the bottlenecks of the disk bandwidth and the network bandwidth. The contributions of this dissertation are threefold: (1)\u00a0we have studied several critical performance trade-offs and provided insights into Internet media content caching and delivery. Our understanding further leads us to establish an effective streaming system optimization model; (2)\u00a0we have designed and evaluated several efficient algorithms to support Internet streaming content delivery, including segment caching, segment prefetching, and memory locality exploitation for streaming; (3)\u00a0having addressed several system challenges, we have successfully implemented a real streaming proxy system and deployed it in a large industrial enterprise.",

Some of our key findings are: (1) Surprisingly, the majority of media contents are still delivered via downloading from Web servers. (2) A substantial percentage of media downloading connections are aborted before completion due to the long waiting time. (3) A hybrid approach, pseudo streaming, is used by clients to imitate real streaming. (4) The mismatch between the downloading rate and the client playback speed in pseudo streaming is common, which either causes frequent playback delays to the clients, or unnecessary traffic to the Internet. (5) Compared with streaming, downloading and pseudo streaming are neither bandwidth efficient nor performance effective. To address this problem, we propose the design of AutoStream, an innovative system that can provide additional previewing and streaming services automatically for media objects hosted on standard Web sites in server farms at the client's will.",

        "abstract": "Millions of residential users are widely served by cable or DSL connections with modest upload bandwidth and relatively high download bandwidth. For the increasingly important and demanding P2P applications such as VoIP, BitTorrent, and Internet streaming, stable or high upload bandwidth is required. Inadequate upload bandwidth degrades the performance of these applications among residential users. On the other hand, our Internet measurements show that plenty of idle upload bandwidth (from 50% to 80%) is always available in a local residential network. Based on this observation, we propose a system prototype to Coordinate Upload Bandwidth Sharing (CUBS) among neighboring residential users. Specifically, the idle upload bandwidth of neighbors can be used upon a request from a demanding user. Since it has become a common practice to deploy wireless access points in a residential user's home, we have built CUBS by leveraging the support from the wireless networks. In CUBS, to discover and manage idle bandwidth, a localized overlay is constructed by the cooperative users. CUBS is application independent as the bandwidth sharing is implemented at the network layer. CUBS is also ISP transparent because the sharing of neighbors' bandwidth does not demand any additional bandwidth supplies. We have evaluated the CUBS system prototype with experiments on Internet. The experimental results demonstrate that CUBS can effectively improve the performance of upload intensive applications by more than 30%.",

        "abstract": "With the falling price of the memory, an increasing number of multimedia servers and proxies are now equipped with a large DRAM memory space. Caching media objects in the memory of a proxy helps to reduce network traffic, disk I/O bandwidth requirement, and data delivery latency. The running buffer approach and its alternatives are representative techniques to cache streaming data in the memory. However, there are two limits in the existing techniques.First, although multiple running buffers for the same media object co-exist in a given processing period, data sharing among the multiple buffers is not considered. Second, user access patterns are not insightfully considered in the buffer management. In this paper, we propose two techniques based on shared running buffers (SRB) in the proxy to address these limits. Considering user access patterns and characteristics of the requested media objects, our techniques adaptively allocate memory buffers to fully utilize the currently buffered data of streaming sessions, with the aim to reduce both the server load and the network traffic. Experimentally comparing with several existing techniques, we show that the proposed techniques have achieved significant performance improvement by effectively using the shared running buffers.",

        "abstract": "The increasing number of wireless users in Internet P2P applications causes two new performance problems due to the requirement of uploading the downloaded traffic for other peers, limited bandwidth of wireless communications, and resource competition between the access point and wireless stations. First, an active P2P wireless user can significantly reduce the downloading throughput of other wireless users in the WLAN. Second, the slowdown of a P2P wireless user communication can also delay its relay anddatasharingservice forotherdependentwired/wireless peers. In order to address these problems, in this paper, we pro- pose an efficient caching mechanism called SCAP (Smart Caching in Access Points). Conducting intensive Inter- net measurements on representative P2P streaming appli- cations, we observe a high percentage of duplicated data packets in successive downloading and uploading data streams. Through duplication detection and caching at the access point, these duplicated packets can be com- pressed so that the uploading traffic in the WLAN is signif- icantly reduced. Our prototype-based experimental evalua- tion demonstrates that by effectively reducing the redundant P2P traffic in the WLAN, SCAP improves the throughput of the WLAN by up to 88% and reduces the response delay to other Internet users meanwhile.",

        "title": "DISC: Dynamic Interleaved Segment Caching for Interactive Streaming",
        "abstract": "Streaming media objects have become widely used on the Internet, and the demand of interactive requests to these objects has increased dramatically. Typical interactive requests include fast forward and direct jumps. Unfortunately, most of existing streaming proxies are designed for sequential accesses, and only a few solutions have been proposed to maintain additional data structures in the proxy to support some interactive operations (such as fast forward) other than jumps, which are among the most common interactive requests from the clients. Focusing on interactive accesses, in this paper we present an analysis of streaming media workload collected from thousands of broadband users hosted by a major ISP. Our analysis shows that jump accesses (48%) and pauses (51%) are the dominant client interactive requests and that jump accesses often suffer serious delays due to slow buffering through the network. To support jump accesses effectively, we further propose a novel caching algorithm \u9a74 DISC (Dynamic Interleaved Segment Caching), which trades cache performance for response time to client interactive requests. In this algorithm, segments of a media object are cached dynamically according to client access patterns. DISC can support direct jumps efficiently while ensuring timely prefetching of uncached segments for sequential accesses. Trace-driven simulations demonstrate that DISC outperforms other caching schemes significantly for interactive requests with only a small degradation in cache performance.",

        "abstract": "Streaming media objects are often cached in segments. Previous segment-based caching strategies cache segments with constant or exponentially increasing lengths and typically favor caching the beginning segments of media objects. However, these strategies typically do not consider the fact that most accesses are targeted toward a few popular objects. In this paper, we argue that neither the use of a predefined segment length nor the favorable caching of the beginning segments is the best caching strategy for reducing network traffic. We propose an adaptive and lazy segmentation based caching mechanism by delaying the segmentation as late as possible and determining the segment length based on the client access behaviors in real time. In addition, the admission and eviction of segments are carried out adaptively based on an accurate utility function. The proposed method is evaluated by simulations using traces including one from actual enterprise server logs. Simulation results indicate that our proposed method achieves a 30% reduction in network traffic. The utility functions of the replacement policy are also evaluated with different variations to show its accuracy.",

Researchers have analyzed different properties of such OSNs, mainly focusing on the formation and evolution of the networks as well as the information propagation over the networks. In knowledge-sharing OSNs, such as blogs and question answering systems, issues on how users participate in the network and how users \"generate/contribute\" knowledge are vital to the sustained and healthy growth of the networks. However, related discussions have not been reported in the research literature. In this work, we empirically study workloads from three popular knowledge-sharing OSNs, including a blog system, a social bookmark sharing network, and a question answering social network to examine these properties. Our analysis consistently shows that (1) users' posting behavior in these networks exhibits strong daily and weekly patterns, but the user active time in these OSNs does not follow exponential distributions; (2) the user posting behavior in these OSNs follows stretched exponential distributions instead of power-law distributions, indicating the influence of a small number of core users cannot dominate the network; (3) the distributions of user contributions on high-quality and effort-consuming contents in these OSNs have smaller stretch factors for the stretched exponential distribution. Our study provides insights into user activity patterns and lays out an analytical foundation for further understanding various properties of these OSNs.",

        "abstract": "As a family of wireless local area network (WLAN) protocols between physical layer and higher layer protocols, IEEE 802.11 has to accommodate the features and requirements of both ends. However, current practice has addressed the problems of these two layers separately and is far from satisfactory. On one end, due to varying channel conditions, WLANs have to provide multiple physical channel rates to support various signal qualities. A low channel rate station not only suffers low throughput, but also significantly degrades the throughput of other stations. On the other end, the power saving mechanism of 802.11 is ineffective in TCP-based communications, in which the wireless network interface (WNI) has to stay awake to quickly acknowledge senders, and hence, the energy is wasted on channel listening during idle awake time. In this paper, considering the needs of both ends, we utilize the idle communication power of the WNI to provide a Cooperative Relay Service (CRS) for WLANs with multiple channel rates. We characterize energy efficiency as energy per bit, instead of energy per second. In CRS, a high channel rate station relays data frames as a proxy between its neighboring stations with low channel rates and the Access Point, improving their throughput and energy efficiency. Different from traditional relaying approaches, CRS compensates a proxy for the energy consumed in data forwarding. The proxy obtains additional channel access time from its clients, leading to the increase of its own throughput without compromising its energy efficiency. Extensive experiments are conducted through a prototype implementation and ns-2 simulations to evaluate our proposed CRS. The experimental results show that CRS achieves significant performance improvements for both low and high channel rate stations",

Conducting experiments on Squid proxy 2.3STABLE4, we have quantified the unnecessary processing overhead to show its significant impact on increased client access response times. We have also analyzed the technical difficulties in eliminating or reducing the processing overhead and the security loopholes based on the existing proxy structure. In order to address these performance and security concerns, we propose a simple but effective technique from the client side that adds a detector interfacing with a browser. With this detector, a standard browser, such as the Netscape/Mozilla, will have simple detective and scheduling functions, called a detective browser. Upon an Internet request from a user, the detective browser can immediately determine whether the requested content is dynamic or secured. If so, the browser will bypass the proxy and forward the request directly to the Web server; otherwise, the request willbe processed through theproxy. We implemented a detective browser prototype in Mozilla version 0.9.7, and tested its functionality and effectiveness. Since we have simply moved the necessary detective functions from a proxy server to a browser, the detective browser introduces little overhead to Internet accessing, and our software can be patched to existing browsers easily.

        "abstract": "The increasing number of wireless users in Internet P2P applications causes two new performance problems due to the requirement of uploading the downloaded traffic for other peers, limited bandwidth of wireless communications, and resource competition between the access point and wireless stations. First, an active P2P wireless user can significantly reduce the downloading throughput of other wireless users in the WLAN. Second, the slowdown of a P2P wireless user communication can also delay its relay and data sharing service for other dependent wired/wireless peers. In order to address these problems, in this paper, we pro- pose an efficient caching mechanism called SCAP (Smart Caching in Access Points). Conducting intensive Inter- net measurements on representative P2P streaming appli- cations, we observe a high percentage of duplicated data packets in successive downloading and uploading data streams. Through duplication detection and caching at the access point, these duplicated packets can be com- pressed so that the uploading traffic in the WLAN is signif- icantly reduced. Our prototype-based experimental evalua- tion demonstrates that by effectively reducing the redundant P2P traffic in the WLAN, SCAP improves the throughput of the WLAN by up to 88% and reduces the response delay to other Internet users meanwhile.",

        "abstract": "Segment-based proxy caching schemes have been effectively used to deliver streaming media objects. However, this approach does not always guarantee continuous delivery because the to-be-viewed segments may not be cached in the proxy in time. The potential consequence is the playback jitter at the client side due to the proxy delay in fetching these uncached segments, thus we call the problem proxy jitter. Aiming at improving the media delivery quality for segment-based caching schemes, in this paper we propose two simple and effective prefetching methods, namely, look-ahead window based prefetching and active prefetching to address the problem of proxy jitter. We focus on presenting streaming flow analyses on proxy and network resource utilizations and consumptions, performance potentials and limits of the two prefetching methods for different segment-based schemes under different network bandwidth conditions. Our study also provides some new insights into relationships between proxy caching performance and the quality of streaming. For example, we show that the objective of improving the byte hit ratio in a conventional proxy and the unique objective of minimizing the proxy jitter to deliver streaming media objects can have conflicting interests. Trace-driven simulations show the effectiveness of our prefetching methods, and further confirm our analyses.",

        "abstract": "With the falling price of memory, an increasing number of multimedia servers and proxies are now equipped with a large memory space. Caching media objects in the memory of a proxy helps to reduce the network traffic, the disk I/O bandwidth requirement, and the data delivery latency. The running buffer approach and its alternatives are representative techniques to caching streaming data in the memory. There are two limits in the existing techniques. First, although multiple running buffers for the same media object co-exist in a given processing period, data sharing among multiple buffers is not considered. Second, user access patterns are not insightfully considered in the buffer management. In this paper, we propose two techniques based on shared running buffers in the proxy to address these limits. Considering user access patterns and characteristics of the requested media objects, our techniques adaptively allocate memory buffers to fully utilize the currently buffered data of streaming sessions, with the aim to reduce both the server load and the network traffic. Experimentally comparing with several existing techniques, we show that the proposed techniques achieve significant performance improvement by effectively using the shared running buffers.",

        "title": "Segment-based streaming media proxy: modeling and optimization",
        "abstract": "Researchers often use segment-based proxy caching strategies to deliver streaming media by partially caching media objects. The existing strategies mainly consider increasing the byte hit ratio and/or reducing the client perceived startup latency (denoted by the metric delayed startup ratio). However, these efforts do not guarantee continuous media delivery because the to-be-viewed object segments may not be cached in the proxy when they are demanded. The potential consequence is playback jitter at the client side due to proxy delay in fetching the uncached segments, which we call proxy jitter. Thus, for the best interests of clients, a correct model for streaming proxy system design should aim to minimize proxy jitter subject to reducing the delayed startup ratio and increasing the byte hit ratio. However, we have observed two major pairs of conflicting interests inherent in this model: (1) one between improving the byte hit ratio and reducing proxy jitter, and (2) the other between improving the byte hit ratio and reducing the delayed startup ratio. In this study, we first propose and analyze prefetching methods for in-time prefetching of uncached segments, which provides insights into the first pair of conflicting interests. Second, to address the second pair of the conflicting interests, we build a general model to analyze the performance tradeoff between the second pair of conflicting performance objectives. Finally, considering our main objective of minimizing proxy jitter and optimizing the two tradeoffs, we propose a new streaming proxy system called Hyper Proxy. Synthetic and real workloads are used to evaluate our system. The performance results show that Hyper Proxy generates minimum proxy jitter with a low delayed startup ratio and a small decrease of byte hit ratio compared with existing schemes.",

        "title": "SProxy: A Caching Infrastructure to Support Internet Streaming",
        "abstract": "Many algorithmic efforts have been made to address technical issues in designing a streaming media caching proxy. Typical of those are segment-based caching approaches that efficiently cache large media objects in segments which reduces the startup latency while ensuring continuous streaming. However, few systems have been practically implemented and deployed. The implementation and deployment efforts are hindered by several factors: 1) streaming of media content in complicated data formats is difficult; 2) typical streaming protocols such as RTP often run on UDP; in practice, UDP traffic is likely to be blocked by firewalls at the client side due to security considerations; and 3) coordination between caching discrete object segments and streaming continuous media data is challenging. To address these problems, we have designed and implemented a segment-based streaming media proxy, called SProxy. This proxy system has the following merits. First, SProxy leverages existing Internet infrastructure to address the flash crowd. The content server is now free of the streaming duty while hosting streaming content through a regular Web server. Thus, UDP based streaming traffic from SProxy suffers less dropping and no blocking. Second, SProxy streams and caches media objects in small segments determined by the object popularity, causing very low startup latency, and significantly reducing network traffic. Finally, prefetching techniques are used to pro-actively preload uncached segments that are likely to be used soon, thus providing continuous streaming. SProxy has been extensively tested and we show that it provides high quality streaming delivery in both local area networks and wide area networks (e.g., between Japan and the U.S.).",

In order to effectively detect spam in user generated content, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of spamming activities on a large commercial UGC site in 325 days covering over 6 million posts and nearly 400 thousand users. Our analysis shows that UGC spammers exhibit unique non-textual patterns, such as posting activities, advertised spam link metrics, and spam hosting behaviors. Based on these non-textual features, we show via several classification methods that a high detection rate could be achieved offline. These results further motivate us to develop a runtime scheme, BARS, to detect spam posts based on these spamming patterns.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a performance study of BitTorrent-like P2P systems by modeling, based on extensive measurements and trace analysis. Existing studies on BitTorrent systems are single-torrent based and usually assume the process of request arrivals to a torrent is Poisson-like. However, in reality, most BitTorrent peers participate in multiple torrents and file popularity changes over time. Our study of representative BitTorrent traffic provides insights into the evolution of single-torrent systems and several new findings regarding the limitations of BitTorrent systems: (1) Due to the exponentially decreasing peer arrival rate in a torrent, the service availability of the corresponding file becomes poor quickly, and eventually it is hard to locate and download this file. (2) Client performance in the BitTorrent-like system is unstable, and fluctuates significantly with the changes of the number of online peers. (3) Existing systems could provide unfair services to peers, where a peer with a higher downloading speed tends to download more and upload less. Motivated by the analysis and modeling results, we have further proposed a graph based model to study interactions among multiple torrents. Our model quantitatively demonstrates that inter-torrent collaboration is much more effective than stimulating seeds to serve longer for addressing the service unavailability in BitTorrent systems. An architecture for inter-torrent collaboration under an exchange based instant incentive mechanism is also discussed and evaluated by simulations",

        "abstract": "Existing studies on BitTorrent systems are single-torrent based, while more than 85% of all peers participate in multiple torrents according to our trace analysis. In addition, these studies are not sufficiently insightful and accurate even for single-torrent models, due to some unrealistic assumptions. Our analysis of representative Bit-Torrent traffic provides several new findings regarding the limitations of BitTorrent systems: (1) Due to the exponentially decreasing peer arrival rate in reality, service availability in such systems becomes poor quickly, after which it is difficult for the file to be located and downloaded. (2) Client performance in the BitTorrent-like systems is unstable, and fluctuates widely with the peer population. (3) Existing systems could provide unfair services to peers, where peers with high downloading speed tend to download more and upload less. In this paper, we study these limitations on torrent evolution in realistic environments. Motivated by the analysis and modeling results, we further build a graph based multi-torrent model to study inter-torrent collaboration. Our model quantitatively provides strong motivation for inter-torrent collaboration instead of directly stimulating seeds to stay longer. We also discuss a system design to show the feasibility of multi-torrent collaboration.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Social network spam increases explosively with the rapid development and wide usage of various social networks on the Internet. To timely detect spam in large social network sites, it is desirable to discover unsupervised schemes that can save the training cost of supervised schemes. In this work, we first show several limitations of existing unsupervised detection schemes. The main reason behind the limitations is that existing schemes heavily rely on spamming patterns that are constantly changing to avoid detection. Motivated by our observations, we first propose a sybil defense based spam detection scheme SD2 that remarkably outperforms existing schemes by taking the social network relationship into consideration. In order to make it highly robust in facing an increased level of spam attacks, we further design an unsupervised spam detection scheme, called UNIK. Instead of detecting spammers directly, UNIK works by deliberately removing non-spammers from the network, leveraging both the social graph and the user-link graph. The underpinning of UNIK is that while spammers constantly change their patterns to evade detection, non-spammers do not have to do so and thus have a relatively non-volatile pattern. UNIK has comparable performance to SD2 when it is applied to a large social network site, and outperforms SD2 significantly when the level of spam attacks increases. Based on detection results of UNIK, we further analyze several identified spam campaigns in this social network site. The result shows that different spammer clusters demonstrate distinct characteristics, implying the volatility of spamming patterns and the ability of UNIK to automatically extract spam signatures.",

        "title": "Designs of High Quality Streaming Proxy Systems",
        "abstract": "Researchers often use segment-based proxy caching strategies to deliver streaming media by partially caching media objects. The existing strategies mainly consider increasing the byte hit ratio and/or reducing the client perceived startup latency (denoted by the metric delayed startup ratio). However, these efforts do not guarantee continuous media delivery because the to-be-viewed object segments may not be cached in the proxy when they are demanded. The potential consequence is playback jitter at the client side due to proxy delay in fetching the uncached segments, which we call proxy jitter. Thus, for the best interests of clients, a correct model for streaming proxy system design should aim to minimize proxy jitter subject to reducing the delayed startup ratio and increasing the byte hit ratio. However, we have observed two major pairs of conflicting interests inherent in this model: (1) one between improving the byte hit ratio and reducing proxy jitter, and (2) the other between improving the byte hit ratio and reducing the delayed startup ratio. In this study, we first propose an active prefetching method for in-time prefetching of uncached segments, which provides insights into the first pair of conflicting interests. Second, we further improve our lazy-segmentation scheme (1) which effectively addresses the second pair of the conflicting interests. Finally, considering our main objective of minimizing proxy jitter and optimizing the two trade-offs, we propose a new streaming proxy system called Hyper Proxy by effectively coordinating both prefetching and segmentation techniques. Synthetic and real workloads are used to systematically evaluate our system. The performance results show that the Hyper Proxy system generates minimum proxy jitter with a low delayed startup ratio and a small decrease of byte hit ratio compared with existing schemes.",

        "title": "PSM-throttling: Minimizing Energy Consumption for Bulk Data Communications in WLANs",
        "abstract": "While the 802.11 power saving mode (PSM) and its enhancements can reduce power consumption by putting the wireless network interface (WNI) into sleep as much as possible, they either require additional infrastructure support, or may degrade the transmission throughput and cause additional transmission delay. These schemes are not suitable for long and bulk data transmissions with strict QoS requirements on wireless devices. With increasingly abundant bandwidth available on the Internet, we have observed that TCP congestion control is often not a constraint of bulk data transmissions as bandwidth throttling is widely used in practice. In this paper, instead of further manipulating the trade-off between the power saving and the incurred delay, we effectively explore the power saving potential by considering the bandwidth throttling on streaming/downloading servers. We propose an application-independent protocol, called PSM-throttling. With a quick detection on the TCP flow throughput, a client can identify bandwidth throttling connections with a low cost Since the throttling enables us to reshape the TCP traffic into periodic bursts with the same average throughput as the server transmission rate, the client can accurately predict the arriving time of packets and turn on/off the WNI accordingly. PSM-throttling can minimize power consumption on TCP-based bulk traffic by effectively utilizing available Internet bandwidth without degrading the application's performance perceived by the user. Furthermore, PSM-throttling is client-centric, and does not need any additional infrastructure support. Our lab-environment and Internet-based evaluation results show that PSM-throttling can effectively improve energy savings (by up to 75%) and/or the QoS for a broad types of TCP-based applications, including streaming, pseudo streaming, and large file downloading, over existing PSM-like methods.",

        "title": "Exploiting Idle Communication Power to Improve Wireless Network Performance and Energy Efficiency",
        "abstract": "As a family of wireless local area network (WLAN) protocols between physical layer and higher-layer protocols, IEEE 802.11 has to accommodate the features and requirements of both ends. However, current practice has addressed the problems separately and is far from being satisfactory. On one end, due to varying channel conditions, WLANs have to provide multiple data channel rates to support various signal qualities. A low channel rate station not only suffers low throughput, but also significantly degrades the throughput of other station s. On the other end, TCP is not energy efficient running on 802.11. In a TCP session, a wireless network interface (WNI) has to stay awake to generate timely acknowledgments, and hence, the energy is wasted by channel listening during idle awake time. In this paper, considering the needs of both ends, we utilize the idle communication power of the WNI to improve the throughput and energy efficiency of stations in WLANs with multiple chan nel rates. We characterize the energy efficiency as energy per bi t, instead of energy per second. Based on modeling and analysis, we propose a data forwarding mechanism and an energy-aware channel allocation mechanism. In such a system, a high channel rate station relays data frames between its neighboring stations with low channel rates and the Access Point, improving their throughput and energy efficiency. Different from tradition al relaying approaches, our scheme compensates for the energy consumption for data forwarding. The forwarding station obtains additional channel access time from its beneficiaries, lead ing to the increase of its own throughput without compromising its energy efficiency. We implement a prototype of our proposed system and evaluate it through extensive experiments. Our results show significant performance improvements for both low and high channel rate stations. I.

        "abstract": "Streaming media workloads have a number of desirable prop- erties that make them good candidates for caching via proxy systems. The content does not get modified, and access patterns exhibit some lo- cality of reference. However, media files tend to be much larger in size than traditional web pages, and users tend to view video clips only par- tially. Hence, segment-based strategies have been proposed to deliver large streaming media objects via a web-proxy. In this work, we evaluate the performance of such a segment-based streaming proxy using extensive trace driven simulation. We use representative workloads from enterprise media server logs, and evaluate the caching system performance regard- ing different cache sizes, different segment sizes, and different prefetching methods. Our results show that cost-effective caching requires only about 8 - 16 % of the total unique object size as proxy storage. Secondly, a seg- ment size of around 200 Kbytes provides a good trade-off between cache object granularity and transaction overhead. Finally, a lazier prefetching schedule that provides a half-segment look-ahead has a significant perfor- mance gain when compared to a more aggressive one-segment look-ahead scheme.",

        "abstract": "With the falling price of the memory, an increasing number of mul- timedia servers and proxies are now equipped with a large mem- ory space. Caching media objects in the memory of a proxy helps to reduce the network traffic, the disk I/O bandwidth requirement, and the data delivery latency. The running buffer approach and its alternatives are representative techniques to cache streaming data in the memory. There are two limits in the existing techniques. First, although multiple running buffers for the same media ob- ject co-exist in a given processing period, data sharing among the multiple buffers is not considered. Second, user access patterns are not insightfully considered in the buffer management. In this study, we propose two techniques based on shared running buffers (SRB) in the proxy to address these limits. Considering user ac- cess patterns and characteristics of the requested media objects, our techniques adaptively allocate memory buffers to fully utilize the currently buffered data of streaming sessions to serve existing re- quests concurrently, with the aim to reduce both the server load and the network traffic. Experimentally comparing with several exist- ing techniques, we have shown that the proposed techniques have achieved significant performance improvement by effectively using the sharing running buffers.",

        "abstract": "To efficiently deliver streaming media, researchers have developed technical solutions that fall into three categories, each of which has its merits and limitations. Infrastructure-based CDNs with dedicated network bandwidths and hardware supports can provide high-quality streaming services, but at a high cost. Server-based proxies are cost-effective but not scalable due to the limited proxy capacity in storage and bandwidth, and its centralized control also brings a single point of failure. Client-based P2P networks are scalable, but do not guarantee high-quality streaming service due to the transient nature of peers. To address these limitations, we present a novel and efficient design of a scalable and reliable media proxy system assisted by P2P networks, called PROP. In the PROP system, the clients' machines in an intranet are self-organized into a structured P2P system to provide a large media storage and to actively participate in the streaming media delivery, where the proxy is also embedded as an important member to ensure the quality of streaming service. The coordination and collaboration in the system are efficiently conducted by our P2P management structure and replacement policies. Our system has the following merits: 1) It addresses both the scalability problem in centralized proxy systems and the unreliable service concern by only relying on the P2P sharing of clients. 2) The proposed content locating scheme can timely serve the demanded media data and fairly dispatch media streaming tasks in appropriate granularity across the system. 3) Based on the modeling and analysis, we propose global replacement policies for proxy and clients, which well balance the demand and supply of streaming data in the system, achieving a high utilization of peers' cache. We have comparatively evaluated our system through trace-driven simulations with synthetic workloads and with a real-life workload extracted from the media server logs in an enterprise network, which shows our design significantly improves the quality of media streaming and the system scalability.",

        "abstract": "MapReduce-based data warehouse systems are playing important roles of supporting big data analytics to understand quickly the dynamics of user behavior trends and their needs in typical Web service providers and social network sites (e.g., Facebook). In such a system, the data placement structure is a critical factor that can affect the warehouse performance in a fundamental way. Based on our observations and analysis of Facebook production systems, we have characterized four requirements for the data placement structure: (1) fast data loading, (2) fast query processing, (3) highly efficient storage space utilization, and (4) strong adaptivity to highly dynamic workload patterns. We have examined three commonly accepted data placement structures in conventional databases, namely row-stores, column-stores, and hybrid-stores in the context of large data analysis using MapReduce. We show that they are not very suitable for big data processing in distributed systems. In this paper, we present a big data placement structure called RCFile (Record Columnar File) and its implementation in the Hadoop system. With intensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of RCFile in satisfying the four requirements. RCFile has been chosen in Facebook data warehouse system as the default option. It has also been adopted by Hive and Pig, the two most widely used data analysis systems developed in Facebook and Yahoo!",

        "abstract": "MapReduce has become an effective approach to big data analytics in large cluster systems, where SQL-like queries play important roles to interface between users and systems. However, based on our Facebook daily operation results, certain types of queries are executed at an unacceptable low speed by Hive (a production SQL-to-MapReduce translator). In this paper, we demonstrate that existing SQL-to-MapReduce translators that operate in a one-operation-to-one-job mode and do not consider query correlations cannot generate high-performance MapReduce programs for certain queries, due to the mismatch between complex SQL structures and simple MapReduce framework. We propose and develop a system called Y Smart, a correlation aware SQL-to-MapReduce translator. Y Smart applies a set of rules to use the minimal number of MapReduce jobs to execute multiple correlated operations in a complex query. Y Smart can significantly reduce redundant computations, I/O operations and network transfers compared to existing translators. We have implemented Y Smart with intensive evaluation for complex queries on two Amazon EC2 clusters and one Facebook production cluster. The results show that Y Smart can outperform Hive and Pig, two widely used SQL-to-MapReduce translators, by more than four times for query execution.",

        "abstract": "A unique challenge for SSD storage caching management in a virtual machine (VM) environment is to accomplish the dual objectives: maximizing utilization of shared SSD cache devices and ensuring performance isolation among VMs. In this paper, we present our design and implementation of S-CAVE, a hypervisor-based SSD caching facility, which effectively manages a storage cache in a Multi-VM environment by collecting and exploiting runtime information from both VMs and storage devices. Due to a hypervisor's unique position between VMs and hardware resources, S-CAVE does not require any modification to guest OSes, user applications, or the underlying storage system. A critical issue to address in S-CAVE is how to allocate limited and shared SSD cache space among multiple VMs to achieve the dual goals. This is accomplished in two steps. First, we propose an effective metric to determine the demand for SSD cache space of each VM. Next, by incorporating this cache demand information into a dynamic control mechanism, S-CAVE is able to efficiently provide a fair share of cache space to each VM while achieving the goal of best utilizing the shared SSD cache device. In accordance with the constraints of all the functionalities of a hypervisor, S-CAVE incurs minimum overhead in both memory space and computing time. We have implemented S-CAVE in vSphere ESX, a widely used commercial hypervisor from VMWare. Our extensive experiments have shown its strong effectiveness for various data-intensive applications.",

        "abstract": "A table placement method is a critical component in big data analytics on distributed systems. It determines the way how data values in a two-dimensional table are organized and stored in the underlying cluster. Based on Hadoop computing environments, several table placement methods have been proposed and implemented. However, a comprehensive and systematic study to understand, to compare, and to evaluate different table placement methods has not been done. Thus, it is highly desirable to gain important insights into the basic structure and essential issues of table placement methods in the context of big data processing infrastructures. In this paper, we present such a study. The basic structure of a data placement method consists of three core operations: row reordering, table partitioning, and data packing. All the existing placement methods are formed by these core operations with variations made by the three key factors: (1) the size of a horizontal logical subset of a table (or the size of a row group), (2) the function of mapping columns to column groups, and (3) the function of packing columns or column groups in a row group into physical blocks. We have designed and implemented a benchmarking tool to provide insights into how variations of each factor affect the I/O performance of reading data of a table stored by a table placement method. Based on our results, we give suggested actions to optimize table reading performance. Results from large-scale experiments have also confirmed that our findings are valid for production workloads. Finally, we present ORC File as a case study to show the effectiveness of our findings and suggested actions.",

        "abstract": "Traditional parallel processing models, such as BSP, are \"scale up\" based, aiming to achieve high performance by increasing computing power, interconnection network bandwidth, and memory/storage capacity within dedicated systems, while big data analytics tasks aiming for high throughput demand that large distributed systems \"scale out\" by continuously adding computing and storage resources through networks. Each one of the \"scale up\" model and \"scale out\" model has a different set of performance requirements and system bottlenecks. In this paper, we develop a general model that abstracts critical computation and communication behavior and computation-communication interactions for big data analytics in a scalable and fault-tolerant manner. Our model is called DOT, represented by three matrices for data sets (D), concurrent data processing operations (O), and data transformations (T), respectively. With the DOT model, any big data analytics job execution in various software frameworks can be represented by a specific or non-specific number of elementary/composite DOT blocks, each of which performs operations on the data sets, stores intermediate results, makes necessary data transfers, and performs data transformations in the end. The DOT model achieves the goals of scalability and fault-tolerance by enforcing a data-dependency-free relationship among concurrent tasks. Under the DOT model, we provide a set of optimization guidelines, which are framework and implementation independent, and applicable to a wide variety of big data analytics jobs. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the DOT model through several case studies.",

Support of high performance spatial queries on large volumes data has become increasingly important in numerous fields, which requires a scalable and efficient spatial data warehousing solution as existing approaches exhibit scalability limitations and efficiency bottlenecks for large scale spatial applications. In this demonstration, we present Hadoop-GIS -- a scalable and high performance spatial query system over MapReduce. Hadoop-GIS provides an efficient spatial query engine to process spatial queries, data and space based partitioning, and query pipelines that parallelize queries implicitly on MapReduce. Hadoop-GIS also provides an expressive, SQL-like spatial query language for work-load specification. We will demonstrate how spatial queries are expressed in spatially extended SQL queries, and submitted through a command line/web interface for execution. Parallel to our system demonstration, we explain the system architecture and details on how queries are translated to MapReduce operators, optimized, and executed on Hadoop. In addition, we will showcase how the system can be used to support two representative real world use cases: large scale pathology analytical imaging, and geo-spatial data warehousing.",

        "abstract": "Database community has made significant research efforts to optimize query processing on GPUs in the past few years. However, we can hardly find that GPUs have been truly adopted in major warehousing production systems. Preparing to merge GPUs to the warehousing systems, we have identified and addressed several critical issues in a three-dimensional study of warehousing queries on GPUs by varying query characteristics, software techniques, and GPU hardware configurations. We also propose an analytical model to understand and predict the query performance on GPUs. Based on our study, we present our performance insights for warehousing query execution on GPUs. The objective of our work is to provide a comprehensive guidance for GPU architects, software system designers, and database practitioners to narrow the speed gap between the GPU kernel execution (the fast mode) and data transfer to prepare GPU execution (the slow mode) for high performance in processing data warehousing queries. The GPU query engine developed in this work is open source to the public.",

However, the performance of spatial database systems has not been satisfactory since their implementations of spatial operations cannot fully utilize the power of modern parallel hardware. In this paper, we provide a customized software solution that exploits GPUs and multi-core CPUs to accelerate spatial cross-comparison in a cost-effective way. Our solution consists of an efficient GPU algorithm and a pipelined system framework with task migration support.

        "abstract": "Support of high performance queries on large volumes of spatial data becomes increasingly important in many application domains, including geospatial problems in numerous fields, location based services, and emerging scientific applications that are increasingly data- and compute-intensive. The emergence of massive scale spatial data is due to the proliferation of cost effective and ubiquitous positioning technologies, development of high resolution imaging technologies, and contribution from a large number of community users. There are two major challenges for managing and querying massive spatial data to support spatial queries: the explosion of spatial data, and the high computational complexity of spatial queries. In this paper, we present Hadoop-GIS - a scalable and high performance spatial data warehousing system for running large scale spatial queries on Hadoop. Hadoop-GIS supports multiple types of spatial queries on MapReduce through spatial partitioning, customizable spatial query engine RESQUE, implicit parallel spatial query execution on MapReduce, and effective methods for amending query results through handling boundary objects. Hadoop-GIS utilizes global partition indexing and customizable on demand local spatial indexing to achieve efficient query processing. Hadoop-GIS is integrated into Hive to support declarative spatial queries with an integrated architecture. Our experiments have demonstrated the high efficiency of Hadoop-GIS on query response and high scalability to run on commodity clusters. Our comparative experiments have showed that performance of Hadoop-GIS is on par with parallel SDBMS and outperforms SDBMS for compute-intensive queries. Hadoop-GIS is available as a set of library for processing spatial queries, and as an integrated software package in Hive.",

        "abstract": "In current databases, GPUs are used as dedicated accelerators to process each individual query. Sharing GPUs among concurrent queries is not supported, causing serious resource underutilization. Based on the profiling of an open-source GPU query engine running commonly used single-query data warehousing workloads, we observe that the utilization of main GPU resources is only up to 25%. The underutilization leads to low system throughput. To address the problem, this paper proposes concurrent query execution as an effective solution. To efficiently share GPUs among concurrent queries for high throughput, the major challenge is to provide software support to control and resolve resource contention incurred by the sharing. Our solution relies on GPU query scheduling and device memory swapping policies to address this challenge. We have implemented a prototype system and evaluated it intensively. The experiment results confirm the effectiveness and performance advantage of our approach. By executing multiple GPU queries concurrently, system throughput can be improved by up to 55% compared with dedicated processing.",

        "abstract": "GPGPUs are evolving from dedicated accelerators towards mainstream commodity computing resources. During the transition, the lack of system management of device memory space on GPGPUs has become a major hurdle. In existing GPGPU systems, device memory space is still managed explicitly by individual applications, which not only increases the burden of programmers but can also cause application crashes, hangs, or low performance. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of GDM, a fully functional GPGPU device memory manager to address the above problems and unleash the computing power of GPGPUs in general-purpose environments. To effectively coordinate the device memory usage of different applications, GDM takes control over device memory allocations and data transfers to and from device memory, leveraging a buffer allocated in each application's virtual memory. GDM utilizes the unique features of GPGPU systems and relies on several effective optimization techniques to guarantee the efficient usage of device memory space and to achieve high performance. We have evaluated GDM and compared it against state-of-the-art GPGPU system software on a range of workloads. The results show that GDM can prevent applications from crashes, including those induced by device memory leaks, and improve system performance by up to 43%.",

        "abstract": "The foundation of a data processing engine running on a large cluster is its programming model that defines data processing operations and data movements. A special kind of communication activities that are not normally defined in the programming model but are often used in ad hoc ways in system development, is called out-of-band communications. The existing ad hoc solutions of out-of-band communications are often hard to reuse, error-prone, and not free from unwanted side effects. To address these issues, we have designed and implemented a standalone facility of out-of-band communications called SideWalk. With this facility, users can add out-of-band communication operations into their distributed data flows through a set of reusable APIs. These APIs have well defined semantics and thus, users' chances of writing error-prone programs with SideWalk are minimized. To prevent users from introducing unwanted side effects while using SideWalk, we prototype SideWalk to efficiently handle lightweight out-of-band communications and we restrict communication patterns that can be conducted through SideWalk without affecting the applicability of SideWalk on typical use cases. Our experimental results show that execution times of distributed data processing flows in a Hadoop environment with out-of-band communications implemented with SideWalk are reduced up to 1.53 times compared with that of distributed data processing flows with out-of-band communications implemented with a representative ad hoc solution.",

        "title": "SQLoop: High Performance Iterative Processing in Data Management.",
        "abstract": "Increasingly more iterative and recursive query tasks are processed in data management systems, such as graph-structured data analytics, demanding fast response time. However, existing CTE-based recursive SQL and its implementation ineffectively respond to this intensive query processing with two major drawbacks. First, its iteration execution model is based on implicit set-oriented terminating conditions that cannot express aggregation-based tasks, such as PageRank. Second, its synchronous execution model cannot perform asynchronous computing to further accelerate execution in parallel. To address these two issues, we have designed and implemented SQLoop, a framework that extends the semantics of current SQL standard in order to accommodate iterative SQL queries. SQLoop interfaces between users and different database engines with two powerful components. First, it provides an uniform SQL expression for users to access any database engine so that they do not need to write database dependent SQL or move datasets from a target engine to process in their own sites. Second, SQLoop automatically parallelizes iterative queries that contain certain aggregate functions in both synchronous and asynchronous ways. More specifically, SQLoop is able to take advantage of intermediate results generated between different iterations and to prioritize the execution of partitions that accelerate the query processing. We have tested and evaluated SQLoop by using three popular database engines with real-world datasets and queries, and shown its effectiveness and high performance.",

        "abstract": "In general, the performance of parallel graph processing is determined by three pairs of critical parameters, namely synchronous or asynchronous execution mode (Sync or Async), Push or Pull communication mechanism (Push or Pull), and Data-driven or Topology-driven traversing scheme (DD or TD), which increases the complexity and sophistication of programming and system implementation of GPU. Existing graph-processing frameworks mainly use a single combination in the entire execution for a given application, but we have observed their variable and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present SEP-Graph, a highly efficient software framework for graph-processing on GPU. The hybrid execution mode is automatically switched among three pairs of parameters, with an objective to achieve the shortest execution time in each iteration. We also apply a set of optimizations to SEP-Graph, considering the characteristics of graph algorithms and underlying GPU architectures. We show the effectiveness of SEP-Graph based on our intensive and comparative performance evaluation on NVIDIA 1080, P100, and V100 GPUs. Compared with existing and representative GPU graph-processing framework Groute and Gunrock, SEP-Graph can reduce execution time up to 45.8 times and 39.4 times.\n\n",

        "title": "DirectLoad: A Fast Web-Scale Index System Across Large Regional Centers",
        "abstract": "The freshness of web page indices is the key to improving searching quality of search engines. In Baidu, the major search engine in China, we have developed DirectLoad, an index updating system for efficiently delivering the webscale indices to nationwide data centers. However, the web-scale index updating suffers from increasingly high data volumes during network transmission and inefficient I/O transactions due to slow disk operations. DirectLoad accelerates the index updating streams from two aspects: 1) DirectLoad effectively cuts down the overwhelmingly high volume of indices in transmission by removing the redundant data across versions, and mutates regular operations in a key-value storage system for successful accesses to the deduplicated datasets. 2) DirectLoad significantly improves the I/O efficiency by replacing the LSMTree with a memory-resident table (memtable) and appendingonly-files (AOFs) on disk. Specifically, the write amplification stemming from sorting operations on disk is eliminated, and a lazy garbage collection policy further improves the I/O performance at the software level. In addition, DirectLoad directly manipulates the SSD native interfaces to remove the write amplification at the hardware level. In practice, 63% updating bandwidth has been saved due to the deduplication, and the write throughput to SSDs is increased by 3x. The index updating cycle of our production workloads has been compressed from 15 days to 3 days after deploying DirectLoad. In this paper, we show the effectiveness and efficiency of an in-memory index updating system, which is disruptive to the framework in a conventional memory hierarchy. We hope that this work contributes a strong case study in the system research literature.",

        "abstract": "Proxy hit ratios tend to decrease as the demand and supply of Web contents are becoming more diverse. By case studies, we quantitatively confirm this trend and observe significant document duplications among a proxy and its client browsers' caches. One reason behind this trend is that the client/server Web caching model does not support direct resource sharing among clients, causing the Web contents and the network bandwidths among clients to be relatively underutilized. To address these limits and improve Web caching performance, we have extensively enhanced and deployed our browsers-aware framework, a peer-to-peer Web caching management scheme. We make the browsers and their proxy share the contents to exploit the neglected but rich data locality in browsers and reduce document duplications among the proxy and browsers' caches to effectively utilize the Web contents and network bandwidth among clients. The objective of our scheme is to improve the scalability of proxy-based caching both in the number of connected clients and in the diversity of Web documents. In this paper, we show that building such a caching system with considerations of sharing contents among clients, minimizing document duplications, and achieving data integrity and communication anonymity is not only feasible but also highly effective.",

Many such ap- plications have been shifted from expensive MPP boxes to cost-effective clusters. Auto-CFD is a pre-compiler which transforms Fortran CFD sequential programs to efficient message-passing parallel programs running on clusters. Our work has the following three unique contributions. First, this pre-compiler is highly automatic, requiring a minimum number of user directives for parallelization. Sec- ond, we have applied a dependency analysis technique for the CFD applications, called analysis after partitioning. We propose a mirror-image decomposition technique to par- allelize self-dependent field loops that are hard to paral- lelize by existing methods. Finally, traditional optimiza- tions of communication focus on eliminating redundant syn- chronizations. We have developed an optimization scheme which combines all the non-redundant synchronizations in CFD programs to further reduce the communication over- head. The Auto-CFD has been implemented on clusters and has been successfully used for automatically paralleliz- ing structured CFD application programs. Our experiments show its effectiveness and scalability for parallelizing large CFD applications.",

        "abstract": "We develop and examine job migration policies by considering effective usage of global memory in addition to CPU load sharing in distributed systems. When a node is identified for lacking sufficient memory space to serve jobs, one or more jobs of the node will be migrated to remote nodes with low memory allocations. If the memory space is sufficiently large, a CPU-based load sharing policy will schedule the jobs. Following the principle of sharing both CPU and memory resources, we present several load sharing alternatives. Our objective is to reduce the number of page faults caused by unbalanced memory allocations for jobs among distributed nodes, so that overall performance of a distributed system can be significantly improved.We have conducted trace-driven simulations to compare CPU-based load sharing policies with our policies. We show that our load sharing policies not only improve performance of memory-bound jobs, but also maintain the same load sharing quality as the CPU-based policies for CPU-bound jobs. Regarding remote execution and preemptive migration strategies, our experiments indicate that a strategy selection in load sharing is dependent on the amount of memory demand of jobs - remote execution is more effective for memory-bound jobs, and preemptive migration is more effective for CPU-bound jobs. Our CPU-Memory-based policy using either high performance or high throughput approach and using the remote execution strategy performs the best for both CPU-bound and memory-bound jobs.",

        "title": "Adaptive Memory Allocations in Clusters to Handle Unexpectedly Large Data-Intensive Jobs",
        "abstract": "In a cluster system with dynamic load sharing support, a job submission or migration to a workstation is determined by the availability of CPU and memory resources of the workstation at the time [21]. In such a system, a small number of running jobs with unexpectedly large memory allocation requirements may significantly increase the queuing delay times of the rest of jobs with normal memory requirements, slowing down execution of each individual job and decreasing the system throughput. We call this phenomenon the job blocking problem because the big jobs block the execution pace of majority jobs in the cluster. Since the memory demand of jobs may not be known in advance and may change dynamically, the possibility of unsuitable job submissions/migrations to cause the blocking problem is high, and existing load sharing schemes are unable to effectively handle this problem. We propose two schemes to address this problem. The first scheme, Network RAM supported load sharing, combines job migrations with network RAM, which uses remote execution to initially allocate a job to the most lightly loaded workstation and, if necessary, network RAM to provide a global memory space for the job larger than it would be available otherwise. This scheme has the merits of both job migrations and network RAM. Our experiments show its effectiveness and scalability. However, this scheme requires a network RAM facility in the cluster, which may cause additional overhead and increase cluster network traffic. In order to address this limit, we propose a second scheme, memory reservation, incorporated with dynamic load sharing, which adaptively reserves a small set of workstations to provide special services to the jobs demanding large memory allocations. As soon as the blocking problem is resolved by the memory reservation scheme, the system will adaptively switch back to the normal load sharing state. Both schemes target on handling large data-intensive jobs in clusters, and are mutually complementary. The network RAM supported load sharing scheme can fully utilize the cluster global memory space, while the memory reservation scheme has the advantage of simple implementations and low overhead. Thus, they both can be effective alternatives, and practically deployed in cluster computing under different system conditions.",

Using either remote executions or pre-emptive migrations, a load-sharing system is able to migrate a job from a workstation without sufficient memory space to a lightly loaded workstation with a large idle memory space for the migrated job. In a network RAM system, if a job cannot find sufficient memory space for its working sets, it utilizes idle memory space from other workstations in the cluster through remote paging. Conducting trace-driven simulations, we have compared the performance and tradeoffs of the two approaches and their impacts on job execution time and cluster scalability. Job migration-based load-sharing schemes are able to balance executions of jobs in a cluster well, while network RAM is able to satisfy data-intensive jobs which may not be migratable by sharing all the idle memory resources in a cluster. A network RAM cluster of workstations is scalable only if the network is sufficiently fast.

        "abstract": "A compute farm is a pool of clustered workstations to provide high performance computing services for CPU-intensive, memory-intensive, and I/O active jobs. Existing load sharing schemes with mem- ory considerations assume jobs' memory demand sizes are kno wn in advance or predictable based on users' hints. This assumption can greatly simplify the desi gns and implementations of memory-centric schemes, but is not desirable in practice. Load sharing with unknown memory demand of jobs requires an insightful understanding of the effects of dynamic job interactions to memory systems and an effec- tive usage of dynamic system information. In order to address this issue, we present three new results and contributions in this study. (1) Conducting Linux kernel instrumentations, we have collected dif- ferent types of workload execution traces to quantitativel y characterize job interactions, and modeled page fault behavior as a function of the overloaded memory sizes and the amount of jobs' I/O activities. (2) Based on experimental results and collected dynamic system information, we have built a simulation model which accurately emulates the memory system operations and job migrations with virtual memory considerations. (3) We have proposed a memory-centric load sharing scheme and its variations to effec- tively process dynamic memory allocation demand of jobs, aiming at minimizing execution time of each individual job and maximizing distributed system throughput by dynamically migrating and remotely submitting jobs from heavily loaded machines to lightly loaded ones to eliminate or reduce page faults and to reduce the waiting time for CPU services. Conducting trace-driven simulations, we have exam- ined these load sharing policies to show their effectivenes s. Our study strongly suggests that load index be designed to comprehensively consider utilizing all the available resources including CPUs, global memory and network resources.",

Many such applications have been shifted from expensive MPP boxes to cost-effective Networks of Workstations (NOW). Auto-CFD-NOW is a pre-compiler that transforms Fortran CFD sequential programs to efficient message-passing parallel programs running on NOW. Our work makes the following three unique contributions. First, this pre-compiler is highly automatic, requiring a minimum number of user directives for parallelization. Second, we have applied a dependency analysis technique for the CFD applications, called analysis after partitioning. We propose a mirror-image decomposition technique to parallelize self-dependent field loops that are hard to parallelize by existing methods. Finally, traditional optimizations of communication focus on eliminating redundant synchronizations. We have developed an optimization scheme which combines all the non-redundant synchronizations in CFD programs to further reduce the communication overhead. The Auto-CFD-NOW has been implemented on networks of workstations and has been successfully used for automatically parallelizing structured CFD application programs. Our experiments show its effectiveness and scalability for parallelizing large CFD applications.",

Many load sharing schemes mainly target sharing CPU resources, and have been intensively evaluated in homogeneous distributed environments. However the penalties of data accesses and movement in modern computer systems, such as page faults, have grown to the point where the overall performance of distributed systems cannot be further improved without serious considerations concerning memory resources in the design of load sharing policies. Considering both system heterogeneity and effective usage of memory resources, we design and evaluate load sharing policies in order to minimize both CPU idle times and the number of page faults in heterogeneous distributed systems. Conducting trace-driven simulations, we show that load sharing policies considering both CPU and memory resources are robust and effective in heterogeneous systems. We also show that the functionality and the nature of load sharing policies are quite independent on several memory demand distributions of workloads",

        "abstract": "We propose a scalable Web document sharing infrastructure model called Browsers-Aware Proxy Server. In this design, a proxy server connecting to a group of networked clients maintains an index file of data objects of all clients' browser caches. If a user request misses in its local browser cache and the proxy cache, the browsers-aware proxy server will search the index file attempting to find it in another client's browser cache before sending the request to an upper level proxy or the Web server. If such a request does hit in a remote client, this client will directly forward the data object to the requesting client; or the proxy server fetches the data object from this client and then forwards it to the requesting client. The contributions of this caching model are twofold. First, we show that the amount of sharable data in browser caches is significant and can be utilized for document sharing among clients to improve Web caching performance and scalability. Second, the browsers-aware model can effectively and further improve Web prefetching performance. The browsers-aware model and its supported prefetching technique build a strong locality-aware Internet environment to make Web accesses fast with low communication costs. Conducting trace-driven simulations, we show the effectiveness of the browsers-aware model, and its unique advantages to facilitate prefetching.",

        "abstract": "We propose a peer-to-peer Web document sharing technique, called a \"browser-aware proxy server\". In this design, a proxy server connecting to a group of networked clients maintains an index file of data objects of all the clients' browser caches. If a user request misses in its local browser cache and the proxy cache, the browser-aware proxy server searches the index file, attempting to find it in another client's browser cache before sending the request to an upper-level proxy or to the Web server. If such a hit is found in a client, this client directly forwards the data object to the requesting client, or the proxy server fetches the data object from this client and then forwards it to the requesting client. Trace-driven simulations show that the amount of sharable data in browser caches is significant and can be utilized for peer-to-peer document sharing to improve Web caching performance and scalability. We also address the issues of data integrity and communication anonymity in order to build a reliable browser-aware proxy server.",

        "abstract": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing has emerged as a popular model aiming at further utilizing Internet information and resources, complementing the available client-server services. However, the mechanism of peers randomly choosing logical neighbors without any knowledge about underlying physical topology can cause a serious topology mismatching between the P2P overlay network and the physical underlying network. The topology mismatching problem brings a great stress in the Internet infrastructure and greatly limits the performance gain from various search or routing techniques. Meanwhile, due to the inefficient overlay topology, the flooding-based search mechanisms cause a large volume of unnecessary traffic. Aiming at alleviating the mismatching problem and reducing the unnecessary traffic, we propose a location-aware topology matching (LTM) technique, an algorithm of building an efficient overlay by disconnecting low productive connections and choosing physically closer nodes as logical neighbors while still retaining the search scope and reducing response time for queries. LTM is scalable and completely distributed in the sense that it does not require any global knowledge of the whole overlay network when each node is optimizing the organization of its logical neighbors. The effectiveness of LTM is demonstrated through simulation studies.",

Most existing solutions achieve mutual anonymity in pure P2P systems without any trusted central controls. Compared with two such representative ones, our protocols improve efficiency in two different ways. First, utilizing trusted third parties and aiming at both reliability and low-cost, we propose a group of mutual anonymity protocols. We show that with some limited central support, our protocols can accomplish the goals of anonymity, efficiency, and reliability. Second, we propose a mutual anonymity protocol which relies solely on self-organizations among peers without any trusted central controls. In this protocol, the returning path can be shorter than the requesting path. This protocol does not need to broadcast the requested file back to the requester so that the bandwidth is saved and efficiency is improved. In addition, this protocol does not need special nodes to keep indices of sharing files, thus eliminating the index maintenance overhead and the potential for inconsistency between index records and peer file contents. We have evaluated our techniques in a browser-sharing environment. We show that the average increase in response time caused by our protocols is negligible, and these protocols show advantages over existing protocols in a P2P system.",

Existing load sharing schemes with memory considerations assume jobs' memory demand sizes are known in advance or predictable based on users' hints. This assumption can greatly simplify the designs and implementations of load sharing schemes, but is not desirable in practice. In order to address this concern, we present three new results and contributions in this study. Conducting Linux kernel instrumentation, we have collected different types of workload execution traces to quantitatively characterize job interactions, and modeled page fault behavior as a function of the overloaded memory sizes and the amount of jobs' I/O activities. Based on experimental results and collected dynamic system information, we have built a simulation model which accurately emulates the memory system operations and job migrations with virtual memory considerations. We have proposed a memory-centric load sharing scheme and its variations to effectively process dynamic memory, allocation demands, aiming at minimizing execution time of each individual job by dynamically migrating and remotely submitting jobs to eliminate or reduce page faults and to reduce the queuing time for CPU services. Conducting trace-driven simulations, we have examined these load sharing policies to show their effectiveness",

With the rapid advancement of CPU chips, memory and disk access speed improvements significantly lag behind advancement of CPU speed, increasing the penalty for data movement, such as page faults and I/O operations, relative to normal CPU operations. Aiming at reducing the memory resource contention caused by page faults and I/O activities, we have developed and examined load sharing policies by considering effective usage of global memory in addition to CPU load balancing in clusters. We study two types of application workloads: 1) Memory demands are known in advance or are predictable and 2) memory demands are unknown and dynamically changed during execution. Besides using workload traces with known memory demands, we have also made kernel instrumentation to collect different types of workload execution traces to capture dynamic memory access patterns. Conducting different groups of trace-driven simulations, we show that our proposed policies can effectively improve overall job execution performance by well utilizing both CPU and memory resources with known and unknown memory demands",

        "abstract": "In a cluster system with dynamic load sharing support, a job submission or migration to a workstation is determined by the availability of CPU and memory resources of the workstation at the time. In such a system, a small number of running jobs with unexpectedly large memory allocation requirements may significantly increase the queuing delay times of the rest of jobs with normal memory requirements, slowing down executions of individual jobs and decreasing the system throughput. We call this phenomenon as the job blocking problem because the big jobs block the execution pace of majority jobs in the cluster. We propose a software method incorporating with dynamic load sharing, which adaptively reserves a small set of workstations through virtual cluster reconfiguration to provide special services to the jobs demanding large memory allocations. This policy implies the principle of shortest-remaining-processing-time policy. As soon as the blocking problem is resolved by the reconfiguration, the system will adaptively switch back to the normal load sharing state. We present three contributions in this study. (1) the conditions to cause the job blocking problem; (2) the adaptive software method in a dynamic load sharing system; and (3) trace-driven simulations. We show that our method can effectively improve the cluster computing performance by quickly resolving the job blocking problem. The effectiveness and performance insights are also analytically verified.",

        "title": "Two Fast and High-Associativity Cache Schemes",
        "abstract": "A traditional implementation of the set-associative cache has the disadvantage of longer access cycle times than that of a direct-mapped cache. Several methods have been proposed for implementing associativity in non-traditional ways. However, most of them have only achieved an associativity of two. The others with higher associativity still present longer access cycle times or suffer from larger average access times. In this paper, we first systematically address implementation issues of associativity and evaluate existing implementation methods. We then propose two schemes for implementing higher associativity: the Sequential Multi-Column Cache, which is an extension of the Column Associative Cache, and the Parallel Multi-Column Cache. In order to achieve the same access cycle time as that of a direct-mapped cache, data memory in the cache is organized into one bank in both schemes. We use the multiple MRU block technique to increase the first hit ratio, thus reducing the average access time. While the Parallel Multi-Column Cache performs the tag checking in parallel, the Sequential Multi-Column Cache sequentially searches through places in a set, and uses index information to filter out unnecessary probes. In the case of an associativity of 4, they both achieve the low miss rate of a 4-way set-associative cache. Our simulation results using ATUM traces show that both schemes can effectively reduce the average access time. They have average improvements of 9.8% and 10.8% in average access time over a direct-mapped cache, respectively, for a cache size of 4K bytes and a miss penalty of 20 cycles, in which case the average improvement of the Column Associative Cache is only 4.3%. The improvement of the Sequential Multi-Column Cache in average access time reaches 22.4% when the associativity is 8 and the miss penalty increases to 100 cycles. The two schemes are effective for both small and large caches (1K bytes to 128K bytes).",

This paper proposes a memory-layout oriented approach to exploit cache locality for parallel loops at run-time on Symmetric Multi-Processor (SMP) systems. Guided by application dependent hints and the targeted cache architecture, it reorganizes and partitions a parallel loop through shrinking and partitioning the memory access space of the loop at run-time. In the generated task partitions, the data sharing among partitions is minimized and data reuse in a partition is maximized. The execution of tasks in partitions is scheduled in an adaptive and locality-preserved way to achieve balanced execution, for minimizing the execution time of applications by trading off load balance and locality.Based on simulation and measurement, we show our run-time approach can achieve comparable performance with the compiler optimizations for two applications, whose load balance and cache locality can be well optimized by the tiling and other program transformations. However, our experimental results also show that our approach is able to significantly improve the memory performance for the applications with dynamic memory access patterns. This type of programs are usually hard to be optimized by compilers.",

The message com- plexity is measured by counting the number of communication hops in a network for a given topology. This algorithm reduces its message passing complexity by a token-chasing method, and enhances its effectiveness by dynamically adjusting state information stored in each processor. Moreover, this algorithm shortens the request delay by fully taking advantage of the network dynamic status information. The performance of the algorithm is also modeled for analytical evaluation. We have conducted a group of experiments on a network of workstations for comparisons between our algorithm and two other existing mutual exclusion algorithms. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our algorithm, especially when a large number of requests access the critical region in a distributed system. Finally, the token-chasing algorithm is further en- hanced for fault tolerance under message loss and link crash conditions. \u00a9 1996 Academic Press, Inc.",

Heterogeneity and time-sharing are two characteristics that distinguish the NOW systems from conventional multiprocessor/multicomputer systems which are homogeneous and dedicated. It is important to have a practical model for users to predict the execution times of large-scale parallel applications on nondedicated heterogeneous NOW. Another objective of this study is to provide insight into the dynamic performance of parallel computing and into the effects of program structures and system factors on such a platform. In this paper, we study performance predictions for parallel computing on nondedicated heterogeneous networks of workstations. Our approach is based on a two-level model. On the top level, a semideterministic task graph is used to capture the parallel execution behavior including the variances of communication and synchronization. On the bottom level, a discrete time model is used to quantify effects from NOW systems. An iterative process is used to determine the interactive effects between network contention and task execution. We validate the prediction model using experiments on a nondedicated heterogeneous NOW. The maximum differences between predicted results and measured results were less than 10% in most cases and 15% in the worst cases.",

        "abstract": "Effective caching in the Domain Name System (DNS) is critical to its performance and scalability. Existing DNS only supports weak cache consistency by using the Time-to-Live (TTL) mechanism, which functions reasonably well in normal situations. However, maintaining strong cache consistency in DNS as an indispensable exceptional handling mechanism has become more and more demanding for three important objectives: 1) to quickly respond and handle exceptions such as sudden and dramatic Internet failures caused by natural and human disasters, 2) to adapt increasingly frequent changes of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses due to the introduction of dynamic DNS techniques for various stationed and mobile devices on the Internet, and 3) to provide fine-grain controls for content delivery services to timely balance server load distributions. With agile adaptation to various exceptional Internet dynamics, strong DNS cache consistency improves the availability and reliability of Internet services. In this paper, we first conduct extensive Internet measurements to quantitatively characterize DNS dynamics. Then, we propose a proactive DNS cache update protocol (DNScup), running as middleware in DNS name servers, to provide strong cache consistency for DNS. The core of DNScup is an optimal lease scheme, called dynamic lease, to keep track of the local DNS name servers. We compare dynamic lease with other existing lease schemes through theoretical analysis and trace-driven simulations. Based on the DNS Dynamic Update protocol, we build a DNScup prototype with minor modifications to the current DNS implementation. Our system prototype demonstrates the effectiveness of DNScup and its easy and incremental deployment on the Internet.",

Maintaining consistency between frequently-updated files and their replicas is a fundamental reliability requirement for a P2P system. In this paper, we present SCOPE, a structured P2P system supporting consistency among a large number of replicas. By building a replica-partition-tree (RPT) for each key, SCOPE keeps track of the locations of replicas and then propagates update notifications. Our theoretical analyses and experimental results demonstrate that SCOPE can effectively maintain replica consistency while preventing hot-spot and node-failure problems. Its efficiency in maintenance and failure-recovery is particularly attractive to the deployment of large-scale P2P systems.",

        "abstract": "I. INTRODUCTION Object-tracking quality and network lifetime are two criti- cal and conicting objectives to object-tracking applications in a sensor network. Full sensing coverage (3) is too restricted and expensive to support long-time monitoring applications, and provides little leverage to tune the object-tracking quality and the battery power consumption. Recently, a relaxed sensing coverage \u00f3 probabilistic coverage where any point in a sens- ing eld is sensed with a certain probability at any time \u00f3 was proposed (1), (2), which is a more appropriate approach to bal- ancing the object-tracking quality and the battery power con- sumption. Under probabilistic coverage, we present an analytical model to investigate the object-tracking quality with respect to various network conditions and sensor scheduling schemes. The an- alytical model facilitates performance evaluation of a sensing schedule, network deployment, and sensing scheduling proto- col design. The contributions of our analytical model are three- fold. First, together with simulation to evaluate performances of different scheduling protocols, this analytical model can give more solid and thorough understanding about various protocols and provide insights into the pros and cons of each protocol. Secondly, the analytical model helps to plan a sensor net- work with certain object-tracking quality requirements and battery power budget. The analytical model is e xible enough to capture the interaction among the system pa- rameters, object-tracking quality requirements, and net- work energy limit. Thirdly, in sensing scheduling protocol design, aside from determining the parameters for sensing scheduling proto- cols, our analytical model can direct new protocol design. We validate the correctness of our model through extensive simulation experiments, and use this model to design schedul- ing algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Buffer caches in operating systems keep active file blocks in memory to reduce disk accesses. Related studies have been focused on how to minimize buffer misses and the caused performance degradation. However, the side effects and performance implications of accessing the data in buffer caches (i.e. buffer cache hits) have not been paid attention. In this paper, we show that accessing buffer caches can cause serious performance degradation on multicores, particularly with shared last level caches (LLCs). There are two reasons for this problem. First, data in files normally have weaker localities than data objects in virtual memory spaces. Second, due to the shared structure of LLCs on multicore processors, an application accessing the data in a buffer cache may flush the to-be-reused data of its co-running applications from the shared LLC and significantly slow down these applications. The paper proposes a buffer cache design called Selected Region Mapping Buffer (SRM-buffer) for multicore systems to effectively address the cache pollution problem caused by OS buffer. SRM-buffer improves existing OS buffer management with an enhanced page allocation policy that carefully selects mapping physical pages upon buffer misses. For a sequence of blocks accessed by an application, SRM-buffer allocates physical pages that are mapped to a selected region consisting of a small portion of sets in LLC. Thus, when these blocks are accessed, cache pollution is effectively limited within the small cache region. We have implemented a prototype of SRM-buffer into Linux kernel, and tested it with extensive workloads. Performance evaluation shows SRM-buffer can improve system performance and decrease the execution times of workloads by up to 36%.",

        "abstract": "Scientific applications face serious performance challenges on multicore processors, one of which is caused by access contention in last level shared caches from multiple running threads. The contention increases the number of long latency memory accesses, and consequently increases application execution times. Optimizing shared cache performance is critical to reduce significantly execution times of multi-threaded programs on multicores. However, there are two unique problems to be solved before implementing cache optimization techniques on multicores at the user level. First, available cache space for each running thread in a last level cache is difficult to predict due to access contention in the shared space, which makes cache conscious algorithms for single cores ineffective on multicores. Second, at the user level, programmers are not able to allocate cache space at will to running threads in the shared cache, thus data sets with strong locality may not be allocated with sufficient cache space, and cache pollution can easily happen. To address these two critical issues, we have designed ULCC (User Level Cache Control), a software runtime library that enables programmers to explicitly manage and optimize last level cache usage by allocating proper cache space for different data sets of different threads. We have implemented ULCC at the user level based on a page-coloring technique for last level cache usage management. By means of multiple case studies on an Intel multicore processor, we show that with ULCC, scientific applications can achieve significant performance improvements by fully exploiting the benefit of cache optimization algorithms and by partitioning the cache space accordingly to protect frequently reused data sets and to avoid cache pollution. Our experiments with various applications show that ULCC can significantly improve application performance by nearly 40%.",

        "abstract": "Cache partitioning and sharing is critical to the effective utilization of multicore processors. However, almost all existing studies have been evaluated by simulation that often has several limitations, such as excessive simulation time, absence of OS activities and proneness to simulation inaccuracy. To address these issues, we have taken an efficient software approach to supporting both static and dynamic cache partitioning in OS through memory address mapping. We have comprehensively evaluated several representative cache partitioning schemes with different optimization objectives, including performance, fairness, and quality of service (QoS). Our software approach makes it possible to run the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark suite to completion. Besides confirming important conclusions from previous work, we are able to gain several insights from whole-program executions, which are infeasible from simulation. For example, giving up some cache space in one program to help another one may improve the performance of both programs for certain workloads due to reduced contention for memory bandwidth. Our evaluation of previously proposed fairness metrics is also significantly different from a simulation-based study. The contributions of this study are threefold. (1) To the best of our knowledge, this is a highly comprehensive execution- and measurement-based study on multicore cache partitioning.

        "abstract": "Performance degradation of memory-intensive programs caused by the LRU policy's inability to handle weak-locality data accesses in the last level cache is increasingly serious for two reasons. First, the last-level cache remains in the CPU's critical path, where only simple management mechanisms, such as LRU, can be used, precluding some sophisticated hardware mechanisms to address the problem. Second, the commonly used shared cache structure of multi-core processors has made this critical path even more performance-sensitive due to intensive inter-thread contention for shared cache resources. Researchers have recently made efforts to address the problem with the LRU policy by partitioning the cache using hardware or OS facilities guided by run-time locality information. Such approaches often rely on special hardware support or lack enough accuracy. In contrast, for a large class of programs, the locality information can be accurately predicted if access patterns are recognized through small training runs at the data object level. To achieve this goal, we present a system-software framework referred to as Soft-OLP (Software-based Object-Level cache Partitioning). We first collect per-object reuse distance histograms and inter-object interference histograms via memory-trace sampling. With several low-cost training runs, we are able to determine the locality patterns of data objects. For the actual runs, we categorize data objects into different locality types and partition the cache space among data objects with a heuristic algorithm, in order to reduce cache misses through segregation of contending objects. The object-level cache partitioning framework has been implemented with a modified Linux kernel, and tested on a commodity multi-core processor. Experimental results show that in comparison with a standard L2 cache managed by LRU, Soft-OLP significantly reduces the execution time by reducing L2 cache misses across inputs for a set of single- and multi-threaded - programs from the SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite, NAS benchmarks and a computational kernel set.",

However, they may be hardly adopted in practice due to their non-trivial overheads, high complexities, and/or limited abilities to handle increasingly complicated scenarios of cache contention caused by many-cores. In order to turn cache partitioning methods into reality in the management of multicore processors, we propose to provide an affordable and lightweight hardware support to coordinate with OS-based cache management policies. The proposed methods are scalable to many-cores, and perform comparably with other proposed hardware solutions, but have much lower overheads, therefore can be easily adopted in commodity processors. Having conducted extensive experiments with 37 multi-programming workloads, we show the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed methods. For example on 8-core systems, one of our proposed policies improves performance over LRU-based hardware cache management by 14.5% on average.",

        "title": "BP-Wrapper: A System Framework Making Any Replacement Algorithms (Almost) Lock Contention Free",
        "abstract": "In a high-end database system, the execution concurrency level rises continuously in a multiprocessor environment due to the increase in number of concurrent transactions and the introduction of multi-core processors. A new challenge for buffer management to address is to retain its scalability in responding to the highly concurrent data processing demands and environment. The page replacement algorithm, a major component in the buffer management, can seriously degrade the system's performance if the algorithm is not implemented in a scalable way. A lock-protected data structure is used in most replacement algorithms, where high contention is caused by concurrent accesses. A common practice is to modify a replacement algorithm to reduce the contention, such as to approximate the LRU replacement with the clock algorithm. Unfortunately, this type of modification usually hurts hit ratios of original algorithms. This problem may not exist or can be tolerated in an environment of low concurrency, thus has not been given enough attention for a long time. In this paper, instead of making a trade-off between the high hit ratio of a replacement algorithm and the low lock contention of its approximation, we propose a system framework, called BP-Wrapper, that (almost) eliminates lock contention for any replacement algorithm without requiring any changes to the algorithm. In BP-Wrapper, we use batching and prefetching techniques to reduce lock contention and to retain high hit ratio. The implementation of BP-Wrapper in PostgreSQL version 8.2 adds only about 300 lines of C code. It can increase the throughput up to two folds compared with the replacement algorithms with lock contention when running TPC-C-like and TPC-W-like workloads.",

        "abstract": "Flooding\" is a fundamental operation in unstructured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file sharing systems, such as Gnutella. Although it is effective in content search, flooding is very in- efficient because it results in a great amount of redundant messages. Our study shows that more than 70% of the gen- erated messages are redundant for a flooding with a TTL of 7 in a moderately connected network. Existing efforts to ad- dress this problem have been focused on limiting the use of flooding operations. In this paper, we propose LightFlood, an efficient floodingscheme, with the objective of minimizing the number of redundant messages and retaining the same message propagating scope as that of standard flooding. By constructing a tree-like sub-overlay within the existing P2P overlay called FloodNet, the flooding operation in Light- Flood is divided into two stages. In the first stage, a message is propogated by using the standard flooding scheme with three or four TTL hops, through which the message can be spread to a sufficiently large scope with a small number of redundant messages. In the second stage, the message prop- agating is only conducted across the FloodNet, significantly reducing the number of redundant messages. Our analysis and simulation results show that the Light- Flood scheme provides a low overhead broadcasting facility that can be effectively used in P2P searching. Compared with standard flooding used in Gnutella, we show that the LightFlood scheme with an additional 2 to 3 hops can re- duce up to more than 69% of flooding messages, and retain the same flooding scope.",

        "abstract": "Sequentiality of requested blocks on disks, or their spatial locality, is critical to the performance of disks, where the throughput of accesses to sequentially placed disk blocks can be an order of magnitude higher than that of accesses to randomly placed blocks. Unfortunately, spatial locality of cached blocks is largely ignored and only temporal locality is considered in system buffer cache management. Thus, disk performance for workloads without dominant sequential accesses can be seriously degraded. To address this problem, we propose a scheme called DULO (DUal LOcality), which exploits both temporal and spatial locality in buffer cache management. Leveraging the filtering effect of the buffer cache, DULO can influence the I/O request stream by making the requests passed to disk more sequential, significantly increasing the effectiveness of I/O scheduling and prefetching for disk performance improvements. DULO has been extensively evaluated by both trace-driven simulations and a prototype implementation in Linux 2.6.11. In the simulations and system measurements, various application workloads have been tested, including Web Server, TPC benchmarks, and scientific programs. Our experiments show that DULO can significantly increase system throughput and reduce program execution times.",

        "abstract": "Flooding is a fundamental file search operation in unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing systems, in which a peer starts the file search procedure by broadcasting a query to its neighbors, who continue to propagate it to their neighbors. This procedure repeats until a time-to-live (TTL) counter is decremented to 0. Flooding can seriously limit system scalability because the number of redundant query messages grows exponentially during the message propagation. Our study shows that more than 70% of the generated messages are redundant in a flooding with a TTL of 7 in a moderately connected Gnutella network. Existing efforts to address this issue have been focused on limiting the use of the flooding operation. We propose a new flooding scheme, called LightFlood, with the objective of minimizing the number of redundant messages and retaining a similar message propagating scope as that of the standard flooding. In the scheme, each peer keeps track of the connectivities of every immediate and next indirect neighbor peers, which can be acquired locally. LightFlood identifies the neighbor with the highest connectivity, and uses the link to that neighbor to form a sub-overlay within the existing P2P overlay. In LightFlood, flooding is divided into two stages. The first stage is a standard flooding with a limited number of TTL hops, where a message can spread to a sufficiently large scope with a small number of redundant messages. In the second stage, message propagating is only conducted along the sub-overlay, significantly reducing the number of redundant messages. Our analysis and simulation experiments show that the LightFlood scheme provides a low-overhead broadcast facility that can be effectively used in P2P search. For example, compared with standard flooding with 7 TTL hops, we show that LightFlood with an additional 2 to 3 hops can reduce up to 69% of the flooding messages, and retain the same flooding scope. We believe that LightFlood can be widely used as a core mechanism for efficient message broadcasting in P2P systems due to its near-optimal performance.",

        "title": "Efficient caching algorithms for memory management in computer systems",
        "abstract": "As disk performance continues to lag behind that of memory systems and processors, fully utilizing memory to reduce disk accesses is a highly effective effort to improve the entire system performance. Furthermore, to serve the applications running on a computer in distributed systems, not only the local memory but also the memory on remote servers must be effectively managed to minimize I/O operations. The critical challenges in an effective memory cache management include: (1)\u00a0Insightfully understanding and quantifying the locality inherent in the memory access requests; (2)\u00a0Effectively utilizing the locality information in replacement algorithms; (3)\u00a0Intelligently placing and replacing data in the multi-level caches of a distributed system; (4)\u00a0Ensuring that the overheads of the proposed schemes are acceptable. This dissertation provides solutions and makes unique and novel contributions in application locality quantification, general replacement algorithms, low-cost replacement policy, thrashing protection, as well as multi-level cache management in a distributed system. First, the dissertation proposes a new method to quantify locality strength, and accurately to identify the data with strong locality. It also provides a new replacement algorithm, which significantly outperforms existing algorithms. Second, considering the extremely low-cost requirements on replacement policies in virtual memory management, the dissertation proposes a policy meeting the requirements, and considerably exceeding the performance existing policies. Third, the dissertation provides an effective scheme to protect the system from thrashing for running memory-intensive applications. Finally, the dissertation provides a multi-level block placement and replacement protocol in a distributed client-server environment, exploiting non-uniform locality strengths in the I/O access requests. The methodology used in this study include careful application behavior characterization, system requirement analysis, algorithm designs, trace-driven simulation, and system implementations. A main conclusion of the work is that there is still much room for innovation and significant performance improvement for the seemingly mature and stable policies that have been broadly used in the current operating system design.",

        "title": "DiskSeen: exploiting disk layout and access history to enhance I/O prefetch",
        "abstract": "Current disk prefetch policies in major operating systems track access patterns at the level of the file abstraction. While this is useful for exploiting application-level access patterns, file-level prefetching cannot realize the full performance improvements achievable by prefetching. There are two reasons for this. First, certain prefetch opportunities can only be detected by knowing the data layout on disk, such as the contiguous layout of file metadata or data from multiple files. Second, nonsequential access of disk data (requiring disk head movement) is much slower than sequential access, and the penalty for mis-prefetching a 'random' block, relative to that of a sequential block, is correspondingly more costly. To overcome the inherent limitations of prefetching at the logical file level, we propose to perform prefetching directly at the level of disk layout, and in a portable way. Our technique, called DiskSeen, is intended to be supplementary to, and to work synergistically with, file-level prefetch policies, if present. DiskSeen tracks the locations and access times of disk blocks, and based on analysis of their temporal and spatial relationships, seeks to improve the sequentiality of disk accesses and overall prefetching performance. Our implementation of the DiskSeen scheme in the Linux 2.6 kernel shows that it can significantly improve the effectiveness of prefetching, reducing execution times by 20%-53% for micro-benchmarks and real applications such as grep, CVS, and TPC-H.",

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art networked storage servers are equipped with increasingly powerful computing capability and large DRAMmemory as storage caches. However, their contribution to the performance improvement of networked storage system has become increasingly limited. This is because the client-side memory sizes are also increasing, which reduces capacity misses in the client buffer caches as well as access locality in the storage servers, thus weakening the caching effectiveness of server storage caches. Proactive caching in storage servers is highly desirable to reduce cold misses in clients. We propose an effective way to improve the utilization of storage server resources through prefetching in storage servers for clients. In particular, our design well utilizes two unique strengths of networked storage servers which are not leveraged in existing storage server prefetching schemes. First, powerful storage servers have idle CPU cycles, under-utilized disk bandwidth, and abundant memory space, providing many opportunities for aggressive disk data prefetching. Second, the servers have the knowledge about high-latency operations in storage devices, such as disk head positioning, which enables efficient disk data prefetching based on an accurate cost-benefit analysis of prefetch operations.We present STEP - a Sequentiality and Thrashing dEtection based Prefetching scheme, and its implementation with Linux Kernel 2.6.16. Our performance evaluation by replaying Storage Performance Council (SPC)'s OLTP traces shows that server performance improvements are up to 94% with an average of 25%. Improvements with frequently used Unix applications are up to 53% with an average of 12%. Our experiments also show that STEP has little effect on workloads with random access patterns, such as SPC' Web- Search traces.",

        "abstract": "The paper proposes MESA (Multicoloring with Embedded Skewed Associativity), a novel cache indexing scheme that integrates dynamic page coloring with static skewed asso- ciativity to reduce conflicts in L2/L3 caches with a small de- gree of associativity. MESA associates multiple cache pages (colors) with each virtual memory page and uses two-level skewed associativity, first to map a page to a different color in each bank of the cache, and then to disperse the lines of a page across the banks and within the colors of the page. MESA is a multi-grained cache indexing scheme that com- bines the best of two worlds, page coloring and skewed asso- ciativity. We also propose a novel cache management scheme based on page remapping, which uses cache miss imbalance between colors in each bank as the metric to track conflicts and trigger remapping. We evaluate MESA using 24 bench- marks from multiple application domains and with various degrees of sensitivity to conflict misses, on both an in-order issue processor (using complete system simulation) and an out-of-order issue processor (using SimpleScalar). MESA outperforms skewed associativity, prime modulo hashing, and dynamic page coloring schemes proposed earlier. Com- pared to a 4-way associative cache, MESA can provide as much as 76% improvement in IPC.",

        "title": "SAT-Match: A Self-Adaptive Topology Matching Method to Achieve Low Lookup Latency in Structured P2P Overlay Networks",
        "abstract": "A peer-to-peer (P2P) system is built upon an overlay network whose topology is independent of the underlying physical network. A well-routed message path in an over- lay network with a small number of logical hops can re- sult in a long delay and excessive traffic due to undesir- ably long distances in some physical links. In this paper, we propose an effective method, called SAT-Match, to adap- tively construct structured P2P overlay networks, aiming at significantly reducing the lookup routing latency. In this method, each joining peer is initially guided to find a physi- cally close neighbor to connect with. After then, its overlay location is adaptively adjusted whenever a location mis- match is detected. The topology matching optimization in our method solely relies on local neighborhood informa- tion. Compared with existing topology matching methods, our method addresses their three limitations: (1) heavily relying on global information about the Internet by using landmark-based measurements, (2) lacking adaptation to frequent peer movement in a dynamic environment, such as mobile networks, and (3) insufficiently accurate in topology matching due to the lack of adaptive topology adjustment. We have evaluated our method in the Content-Addressable Network (CAN), a representative structured P2P system with a strong tolerance to frequent peer arrivals/departures. Through intensive simulation experiments on large scale CAN overlays, we have shown the effectiveness of SAT- Match. Our method can achieve average logical/physical link latency reduction rate by up to 40% . It also outper- forms \"landmark binning\", a method utilizing global infor- mation by up to 20%. Finally, combining with the landmark binning method, SAT-Match can achieve up to 60% latency reduction.",

        "abstract": "In a large client/server cluster system, file blocks are cached in a multi-level storage hierarchy. Existing file block placement and replacement are either conducted on each level of the hierarchy independently, or by applying an LRU policy on more than one levels. One major limitation of these schemes is that hierarchical locality of file blocks with non-uniform strengths is ignored, resulting in many unnecessary block misses, or additional communication overhead. To address this issue, we propose a client-directed, coordinated file block placement and replacement protocol, where the non-uniform strengths of locality are dynamically identified on the client level to direct servers on placing or replacing file blocks accordingly on different levels of the buffer caches. In other words, the caching layout of the blocks in the hierarchy dynamically matches the locality of block accesses. The effectiveness of our proposed protocol comes from achieving the following three goals: (1) The multi-level cache retains the same hit rate as that of a single level cache whose size equals to the aggregate size of multi-level caches. (2) The non-uniform locality strengths of blocks are fully exploited and ranked to .t into the physical multi-level caches. (3) The communication overheads between caches are also reduced.",

Existing dynamic power management policies usually take conservative approaches to save disk energy, and disk energy consumption remains a serious issue. Meanwhile, the flash drive is becoming a must-have portable storage device for almost every laptop user on travel. In this paper, we propose to make another highly desired use of the flash drive --- saving disk energy. This is achieved by using the flash drive as a standby buffer for caching and prefetching disk data. Our design significantly extends disk idle times with careful and deliberate consideration of the particular characteristics of the flash drive. Trace-driven simulations show that up to 41% of disk energy can be saved with a relatively small amount of data written to the flash drive.",

        "abstract": "Although the LRU replacement algorithm has been widely used in buffer cache management, it is well-known for its inability to cope with access patterns with weak locality. Previously proposed algorithms to improve LRU greatly increase complexity and/or cannot provide consistently improved performance. Some of the algorithms only address LRU problems on certain specific and predefined cases. Motivated by the limitations of existing algorithms, we propose a general and efficient replacement algorithm, called Low Inter-reference Recency Set (LIRS). LIRS effectively addresses the limitations of LRU by using recency to evaluate Inter-Reference Recency (IRR) of accessed blocks for making a replacement decision. This is in contrast to what LRU does: directly using recency to predict the next reference time. Meanwhile, LIRS mostly retains the simple assumption adopted by LRU for predicting future block access behaviors. Conducting simulations with a variety of traces of different access patterns and with a wide range of cache sizes, we show that LIRS significantly outperforms LRU and outperforms other existing replacement algorithms in most cases. Furthermore, we show that the additional cost for implementing LIRS is trivial in comparison with that of LRU. We also show that the LIRS algorithm can be extended into a family of replacement algorithms, in which LRU is a special member.",

Though straightforward, this approach has several weaknesses: 1) Blocks may be redundantly cached, reducing the effective total cache size, 2) weakened locality at lower-level caches makes recency-based replacement algorithms such as LRU less effective, and 3) high-level caches cannot effectively identify blocks with strong locality and may place them in low-level caches. The fundamental reason for these weaknesses is that the locality information embedded in the streams of access requests from clients is not consistently analyzed and exploited, resulting in globally nonsystematic, and therefore suboptimal, placement and replacement of cached blocks across the hierarchy. To address this problem, we propose a coordinated multilevel cache management protocol based on consistent access-locality quantification. In this protocol, locality is dynamically quantified at the client level to direct servers to place or replace blocks appropriately at each level of the cache hierarchy. The result is that the block layout in the entirely hierarchy dynamically matches the locality of block accesses. Our simulation experiments on both synthetic and real-life traces show that the protocol effectively ameliorates these caching problems. As anecdotal evidence, our protocol achieves a reduction of block accesses of 11 percent to 71 percent, with an average of 35 percent, over uniLRU, a unified multilevel cache scheme.",

Cooperative caching is used to increase cache utilization by coordinating the usage of distributed caches.

        "abstract": "Although LRU replacement policy has been commonly used in the buffer cache management, it is well known for its inability to cope with access patterns with weak locality. Previous work, such as LRU-K and 2Q, attempts to enhance LRU capacity by making use of additional history information of previous block references other than only the recency information used in LRU. These algorithms greatly increase complexity and/or can not consistently provide performance improvement. Many recently proposed policies, such as UBM and SEQ, improve replacement performance by exploiting access regularities in references. They only address LRU problems on certain specific and well-defined cases such as access patterns like sequences and loops. Motivated by the limits of previous studies, we propose an efficient buffer cache replacement policy, called  (LIRS). LIRS effectively addresses the limits of LRU by using recency to evaluate Inter-Reference Recency (IRR) for making a replacement decision. This is in contrast to what LRU does: directly using recency to predict next reference timing. At the same time, LIRS almost retains the same simple assumption of LRU to predict future access behavior of blocks. Our objectives are to effectively address the limits of LRU for a general purpose, to retain the low overhead merit of LRU, and to outperform those replacement policies relying on the access regularity detections. Conducting simulations with a variety of traces and a wide range of cache sizes, we show that LIRS significantly outperforms LRU, and outperforms other existing replacement algorithms in most cases. Furthermore, we show that the additional cost for implementing LIRS is trivial in comparison with LRU.",

An essential component in the disk cache management is its replacement policy that determines which file(s) are least valuable and should be evicted to create space for incoming files. Though a large number of replacement algorithms for data objects of different sizes have been proposed recently in the domain of Web-caching and disk caching in data grids, they inherit the shortcomings of the LRU and LFU replacements in characterization access patterns. In order to address this limit, we propose a technique to measure relative file access locality strength - how soon a file is to be re-accessed before being evicted compared with other files. When we estimate the in-cache reaccess probability, we take the disk space consumed by accessed files as well as disk cache size into consideration. Using relative locality strength estimation, we are able to accurately rank the value of each file for being cached, and select the file(s) with least values for replacement. Our simulation results show that our proposed policy is the most effective one among existing policies in interpreting access patterns, and considering achieves performance improvement measured by hit ratios and byte hit ratios.",

        "abstract": "Internet has become a major infrastructure for information sharing in our daily life, and indispensable to critical and large applications in industry, government, business, and education. Internet bandwidth (or the network speed to transfer data) has been dramatically increased, however, the latency time (or the delay to physically access data) has been reduced in a much slower pace. The rich bandwidth and lagging latency can be effectively coped with in Internet systems by three data management techniques: caching, replication, and prefetching. The focus of this dissertation is to address the latency problem in Internet by utilizing the rich bandwidth and large storage capacity for efficiently prefetching data to significantly improve the Web content caching performance, by proposing and implementing scalable data consistency maintenance methods to handle Internet Web address caching in distributed name systems (DNS), and to handle massive data replications in peer-to-peer systems. While the DNS service is critical in Internet, peer-to-peer data sharing is being accepted as an important activity in Internet. We have made three contributions in developing prefetching techniques. First, we have proposed an efficient data structure for maintaining Web access information, called popularity-based Prediction by Partial Matching (PB-PPM), where data are placed and replaced guided by popularity information of Web accesses, thus only important and useful information is stored. PB-PPM greatly reduces the required storage space, and improves the prediction accuracy. Second, a major weakness in existing Web servers is that prefetching activities are scheduled independently of dynamically changing server workloads. Without a proper control and coordination between the two kinds of activities, prefetching can negatively affect the Web services and degrade the Web access performance. To address this problem, we have developed a queuing model to characterize the interactions. Guided by the model, we have designed a coordination scheme that dynamically adjusts the prefetching aggressiveness in Web Servers. This scheme not only prevents the Web servers from being overloaded, but it can also minimize the average server response time. Finally, we have proposed a scheme that effectively coordinates the sharing of access information for both proxy and Web servers. With the support of this scheme, the accuracy of prefetching decisions is significantly improved. Regarding data consistency support for Internet caching and data replications, we have conducted three significant studies. First, we have developed a consistency support technique to maintain the data consistency among the replicas in structured P2P networks. Based on Pastry, an existing and popular P2P system, we have implemented this scheme, and show that it can effectively maintain consistency while prevent hot-spot and node-failure problems. Second, we have designed and implemented a DNS cache update protocol, called DNScup, to provide strong consistency for domain/IP mappings. Finally, we have developed a dynamic lease scheme to timely update the replicas in Internet.",

Although Web servers may provide accurate access information, our studies show that significant communication overhead can be involved by sending unnecessary reference information to clients or/and proxy servers. Our study also shows that prediction accuracy of proxy-based prefetching can be significantly limited without input of Web servers. We propose a coordinated proxy-server prefetching technique that adaptively utilizes the reference information and coordinates prefetching activities at both proxy and web servers. In our design, the reference access information stored in proxy servers will be the main source serving data prefetching for groups of clients, each of whom shares the common surfing interests. The access information in the web server will be used to serve data prefetching only for data objects that are not qualified for proxy-based prefetching. Conducting trace-driven simulations, we show that both hit ratios and byte hit ratios contributed from coordinated proxy-server prefetching are are up to 88% higher than that from proxy-based prefetching, and they are comparable to the ratios from server-based prefetching with a difference of 5%.",

        "abstract": "Existing peer-to-peer (P2P) search algorithms generally target either the performance objective of improving search quality from a client's perspective, or the objective of reducing search cost from an Internet management perspective. Most existing work of designing and optimizing search algorithms in unstructured P2P networks addresses the trade-off between the two performance objectives. In contrast, our goal in this study is to attempt to achieve both objectives. Motivated by our observations on the content locality in the peer community and the localities of search interests of individual peers, we propose content-abundant cluster-selectively prefetching indices from responding peers (CAC-SPIRP), a fast and low-cost P2P searching algorithm. Our algorithm consists of two components. The first component aims to reduce the search cost by constructing a CAC, where content-abundant peers self-identify, and self-organize themselves into an inter-connected cluster providing a pool of popular objects to be frequently accessed by the peer community. A query will be first routed to the CAC, and most likely to be satisfied there, significantly reducing the amount of network traffic and the search scope. The second component in our algorithm is client oriented and aims to improve the quality of P2P search, called SPIRP. A client individually identifies a small group of peers who have the same interests as itself to prefetch their entire file indices of the related interests, minimizing unnecessary outgoing queries and significantly reducing query response time. Building SPIRP on the CAC Internet infrastructure, our algorithm combines both merits of the two components to achieve both performance objectives. Our trace-driven simulations show that CAC-SPIRP significantly improves the overall performance from both client's perspective and Internet management perspective.",

        "abstract": "Exploiting cache locality of parallel programs at runtime is a complementary approach to a compiler optimization. This is particularly important for those applications with dynamic memory access patterns. We propose a memory-layout oriented technique to exploit cache locality of parallel loops at runtime on Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP) systems. Guided by application-dependent and targeted architecture-dependent hints, our system, called Cacheminer, reorganizes and partitions a parallel loop using the memory-access space of its execution. Through effective runtime transformations, our system maximizes the data reuse in each partitioned data region assigned in a cache, and minimizes the data sharing among the partitioned data regions assigned to all caches. The executions of tasks in the partitions are scheduled in an adaptive and locality-preserved way to minimize the execution time of programs by trading off load balance and locality. We have implemented the Cacheminer runtime library on two commercial SMP servers and an SimOS simulated SMP. Our simulation and measurement results show that our runtime approach can achieve comparable performance with the compiler optimizations for programs with regular computation and memory-access patterns, whose load balance and cache locality can be well optimized by the tiling and other program transformations. However, our experimental results show that our approach is able to significantly improve the memory performance for the applications with irregular computation and dynamic memory access patterns. These types of programs are usually hard to optimize by static compiler optimizations.",

        "abstract": "With the development of active proxy, the functions of a proxy have been enhanced beyond simply storing Web contents. Web prefetching activity in proxy is such an example to reduce client-perceived latency. In this paper, we propose a coordinated proxy-server prefetching technique that adaptively utilizes the access information and coordinates prefetching activities at both proxy and Web servers. In our design, the access information stored in proxies will be the main source serving data prefetching for groups of clients sharing common surfing interests. The access information in the Web server will be used to serve data prefetching only for data objects that are not qualified for proxy-based prefetching. Conducting trace-driven simulations, we show that both hit ratios and byte hit ratios contributed from coordinated proxy-server prefetching are 30-75% higher than other prefetching schemes, and they are comparable to the ratios from a proxyless server-based prefetching that is able to observe every access to the server.",

        "abstract": "The heap representation of priority queues is one of the most widely used data structures in the design of parallel algorithms. Efficiently exploiting the parallelism of a priority heap has significant influence on the efficiency of a wide range of applications and parallel algorithms. In this paper, we propose an aggressive priority heap operating algorithm, called the lock bypassing algorithm (LB) on shared memory systems. This algorithm minimizes interference of concurrent enqueue and dequeue operations on priority heaps while keeping the strict priority property: a dequeue always returns the minimum of a heap. The unique idea that distinguishes the LB algorithm from previous concurrent algorithms on priority heaps is the use of locking-on-demand and lock-bypassing techniques to minimize locking granularity and to maximize parallelism. The LB algorithm allows an enqueue operation to bypass the locks along its insertion path until it reaches a possible place where it can perform the insertion. Meanwhile a dequeue operation also makes its locking range and locking period as small as possible by carefully tuning its execution procedure. The LB algorithm is shown to be correct in terms of deadlock freedom and heap consistency. The performance of the LB algorithm was evaluated analytically and experimentally in comparison with previous algorithms. Analytical results show that the LB algorithm reduces by half the number of locks waited for in the worst case by previous algorithms. The experimental results show that the LB algorithm outperforms previously designed algorithms by up to a factor of 2 in hold time.",

        "abstract": "Existing P2P search algorithms generally target either the performance objective of improving search quality from a client's per- spective, or the objective of reducing search cost from an Internet man- agement perspective. We believe that the essential issue to be considered for designing and optimizing search algorithms in unstructured P2P net- works is the trade-off between the two performance objectives. Motivated by our observations, the locality of content serving in the peer commu- nity and the localities of search interests of individual peers, we propose CAC-SPIRP, a fast and low cost P2P searching algorithm. Our algo- rithm consists of two components. The first component aims to reduce the search cost by constructing a CAC (Content Abundant Cluster), where content-abundant peers self-identify, and self-organize themselves into an inter-connected cluster providing a pool of popular objects to be frequently accessed by the peer community. A query will be first routed to the CAC, and most likely to be satisfied there, significantly reducing the amount of network traffic and the search scope. The sec- ond component in our algorithm is client oriented and aims to improve the quality of P2P search, called SPIRP (Selectively Prefetching Indices from Responding Peers). A client individually identifies a small group of peers who have the same interests as itself to prefetch their entire file indices of the related interests, minimizing unnecessary outgoing queries and significantly reducing query response time. Building SPIRP on the CAC Internet infrastructure, our algorithm combines both merits of the two components and balances the trade-off between the two performance objectives. Our trace-driven simulations show that CAC-SPIRP signif- icantly improves the overall performance from both client's perspective and Internet management perspective.",

Bit-reversals are often repeatedly used as fundamental subroutines for many scientific programs. Thus, in order to gain the best performance, cache-optimal methods and their implementations should be carefully and precisely done at the programming level. This type of performance programming for some special programs, such as the data reorderings, may significantly outperform an optimiza- tion from an automatic tool, such as a compiler. In this paper, we examine different methods using techniques of blocking, buffering, and padding for efficient implementations. We evaluate the merits and limits of each technique and their application and architecture-dependent conditions for developing cache-optimal methods. We present two contributions in this paper: (1) Our integrated blocking methods, which match cache associativity and TLB cache size and which fully use the available registers are cache-optimal and fast. (2) We show that our padding methods outperform other software oriented methods, and believe they are the fastest in terms of minimizing both CPU and memory access cycles. Since the padding methods are almost independent of hardware, they could be widely used on many uniprocessor workstations and SMP multiprocessors.",

        "abstract": "The amount of dynamic Web contents and secured e- commerce transactions has been dramatically increasing in In- ternet where proxy servers between clients and Web servers are commonly used for the purpose of sharing commonly accessed data and reducing Internet traffic. A significant and unneces- sary Web access delay is caused by the overhead in proxy servers to process two types of accesses, namely dynamic Web contents and secured transactions, not only increasing response time, but also raising some security concerns. Conducting experiments on Squid proxy 2.3STABLE4, we have quantified the unnecessary processing overhead to show their significant impact on increased client access response times. We have also analyzed the techni- cal difficulties in eliminating or reducing the processing overhead and the security loopholes based on the existing proxy structure. In order to address these performance and security concerns, we propose a simple but effective technique from the client side that adds a detector interfacing with a browser. With this detector, a standard browser, such as the Netscape/Mozilla, will have simple detective and scheduling functions, called a detective browser. Upon an Internet request from a user, the detective browser can immediately determine whether the requested content is dynamic or secured. If so, the browser will bypass the proxy and forward the request directly to the Web server; otherwise, the request will be processed through the proxy. We implemented a detective browser prototype in Mozilla version 0.9.7, and tested its func- tionality and effectiveness. Since we simply move the necessary detective functions from a proxy server to a browser, the detective browser introduces little overhead to Internet accessing, and our idea can be implemented by patching existing browsers easily.",

        "abstract": "Most computer systems use a global page replacement policy based on the LRU principle to approximately select a Least Recently Used page for a replacement in the entire user memory space. During execution interactions, a memory page can be marked as LRU even when its program is conducting page faults. We define the LRU pages under such a condition as false LRU pages because these LRU pages are not produced by program memory reference delays, which is inconsistent with the LRU principle. False LRU pages can significantly increase page faults, even cause system thrashing. This poses a more serious risk in a large parallel systems with distributed memories because of the existence of coordination among processes running on individual node. In the case, the process thrashing in a single node or a small number of nodes could severely affect other nodes running coordinating processes, even crash the whole system. In this paper, we focus on how to improve the page replacement algorithm running on one node. After a careful study on characterizing the memory usage and the thrashing behaviors in the multi-programming system using LRU replacement. we propose an LRU replacement alternative, called token-ordered LRU, to eliminate or reduce the unnecessary page faults by effectively ordering and scheduling memory space allocations. Compared with traditional thrashing protection mechanisms such as load control, our policy allows more processes to keep running to support synchronous distributed process computing. We have implemented the token-ordered LRU algorithm in a Linux kernel to show its effectiveness.",

        "title": "TPF: a dynamic system thrashing protection facility",
        "abstract": "Operating system designers attempt to keep high CPU utilization by maintaining an optimal multiprogramming level (MPL). Although running more processes makes it less likely to leave the CPU idle, too many processes adversely incur serious memory competition, and even introduce thrashing, which eventually lowers CPU utilization. A common practice to address the problem is to lower the MPL with the aid of process swapping out/in operations. This approach is expensive and is only used when the system begins serious thrashing. The objective of our study is to provide highly responsive and cost-effective thrashing protection by adaptively conducting priority page replacement in a timely manner. We have designed a dynamic system Thrashing Protection Facility (TPF) in the system kernel. Once TPF detects system thrashing, one of the active processes will be identified for protection. The identified process will have a short period of privilege in which it does not contribute its least recently used (LRU) pages for removal so that the process can quickly establish its working set, improving the CPU utilization. With the support of TPF, thrashing can be eliminated in its early stage by adaptive page replacement, so that process swapping will be avoided or delayed until it is truly necessary. We have implemented TPF in a current and representative Linux kernel running on an Intel Pentium machine. Compared with the original Linux page replacement, we show that TPF consistently and significantly reduces page faults and the execution time of each individual job in several groups of interacting SPEC CPU2000 programs. We also show that TPF introduces little additional overhead to program executions, and its implementation in Linux (or Unix) systems is straightforward.",

        "abstract": "Searching efficiency is a decisive factor concerning scalability in large-scale peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing systems. While flooding is the most commonly used and user-performance oriented method to broadcast query across unstructured P2P networks, it generates a large number of redundant messages. Our study shows that more than 70% of messages are redundant using flooding in a moderately connected network, which imposes an increasingly excessive burden on the underlying infrastructure, hindering the growth and scalability of P2P systems. To reduce the use of flooding as well as its associated overhead, we utilize access trails left by a standard flooding, which is a collection of P2P links used by non-redundant messages. Thus the multiple queries following the flooding can be broadcasted along the trail to achieve two goals: (1) The ability of flooding to achieve short response time is maintained; and (2) the cost of a broadcast is minimized. Though the trail can be partially damaged in an ad hoc system with frequent arrivals and departures of peers, we use repeated trail refreshings and additional trail links to make a trail consistently available for query broadcast. We call this trail-based technique FloodTrail. We have evaluated the performance of FloodTrail on P2P systems for Web contents sharing. Simulation results show that FloodTrail could reduce flooding traffic by up to 57%, while maintaining almost the same search coverage as that of flooding.",

        "abstract": "With the ever-growing performance gap between memory systems and disks, and rapidly improving CPU performance, virtual memory (VM) management becomes increasingly important for overall system performance. However, one of its critical components, the page replacement policy, is still dominated by CLOCK, a replacement policy developed almost 40 years ago. While pure LRU has an unaffordable cost in VM, CLOCK simulates the LRU replacement algorithm with a low cost acceptable in VM management. Over the last three decades, the inability of LRU as well as CLOCK to handle weak locality accesses has become increasingly serious, and an effective fix becomes increasingly desirable. Inspired by our I/O buffer cache replacement algorithm, LIRS [13], we propose an improved CLOCK replacement policy, called CLOCK-Pro. By additionally keeping track of a limited number of replaced pages, CLOCK-Pro works in a similar fashion as CLOCK with a VM-affordable cost. Furthermore, it brings all the much-needed performance advantages from LIRS into CLOCK. Measurements from an implementation of CLOCK-Pro in Linux Kernel 2.4.21 show that the execution times of some commonly used programs can be reduced by up to 47%.",

        "title": "BWS: balanced work stealing for time-sharing multicores",
        "abstract": "Running multithreaded programs in multicore systems has become a common practice for many application domains. Work stealing is a widely-adopted and effective approach for managing and scheduling the concurrent tasks of such programs. Existing work-stealing schedulers, however, are not effective when multiple applications time-share a single multicore---their management of steal-attempting threads often causes unbalanced system effects that hurt both workload throughput and fairness. In this paper, we present BWS (Balanced Work Stealing), a work-stealing scheduler for time-sharing multicore systems that leverages new, lightweight operating system support. BWS improves system throughput and fairness via two means. First, it monitors and controls the number of awake, steal-attempting threads for each application, so as to balance the costs (resources consumed in steal attempts) and benefits (available tasks get promptly stolen) of such threads. Second, a steal-attempting thread can yield its core directly to a peer thread with an unfinished task, so as to retain the core for that application and put it to better use. We have implemented a prototype of BWS based on Cilk++, a state-of-the-art work-stealing scheduler. Our performance evaluation with various sets of concurrent applications demonstrates the advantages of BWS over Cilk++, with average system throughput increased by 12.5% and average unfairness decreased from 124% to 20%.",

        "title": "MCC-DB: minimizing cache conflicts in multi-core processors for databases",
        "abstract": "In a typical commercial multi-core processor, the last level cache (LLC) is shared by two or more cores. Existing studies have shown that the shared LLC is beneficial to concurrent query processes with commonly shared data sets. However, the shared LLC can also be a performance bottleneck to concurrent queries, each of which has private data structures, such as a hash table for the widely used hash join operator, causing serious cache conflicts. We show that cache conflicts on multi-core processors can significantly degrade overall database performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid system method called MCC-DB for accelerating executions of warehouse-style queries, which relies on the DBMS knowledge of data access patterns to minimize LLC conflicts in multi-core systems through an enhanced OS facility of cache partitioning. MCC-DB consists of three components: (1) a cacheaware query optimizer carefully selects query plans in order to balance the numbers of cache-sensitive and cache-insensitive plans; (2) a query execution scheduler makes decisions to co-run queries with an objective of minimizing LLC conflicts; and (3) an enhanced OS kernel facility partitions the shared LLC according to each query's cache capacity need and locality strength. We have implemented MCC-DB by patching the three components in PostgreSQL and Linux kernel. Our intensive measurements on an Intel multi-core system with warehouse-style queries show that MCC-DB can reduce query execution times by up to 33%.",

        "title": "Analysis and implementation of topology-aware overlay systems on the internet",
        "abstract": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have been widely deployed and used to provide different services, such as file sharing, video streaming, and voice-over-IP. These applications have contributed the largest portion of Internet traffic, and have unnecessarily wasted a significant amount of precious Internet bandwidth due to the mutual-blindness between the application layer (overlay) and its network layer (underlay). The lack of communication between these two layers has caused significantly inefficient Internet resource utilization. How to utilize Internet underlay information to optimize the quality of these overlay applications as well as Internet resource utilization is a fundamental and challenging issue that must be addressed for building Internet systems and applications on top of it.In this Ph.D. dissertation, we first investigate the frequently occurred Internet routing instabilities that can greatly degrade overlay application quality, and analyze their root causes. We propose several new techniques and their system implementation to discover routing instabilities by solely utilizing available user-level utilities. Our techniques rely on traceroute probes that can be easily launched from end hosts. We have implemented our techniques in a system facility called NetRecce, and have extensively tested and evaluated its performance by analyzing the routing instabilities for three top-tier ISPs over a 50-day period. We show that NetRecce is highly effective in discovering a large fraction of routing instabilities. We then conduct intensive Internet measurement experiments to confirm the benefits gained by peer relays in VoIP, and to investigate the performance of the Skype system. We observe that Skype peer relay selection is suboptimal, takes long time, and generates a large amount of unnecessarily probing traffic. Our further analysis shows that two main reasons cause these problems. First, the peer selections do not take Autonomous System (AS) topology into consideration, and second, the complex communication relationships among peers are not well utilized. Motivated by our measurements and analysis, we propose an AS-aware peer-relay protocol called ASAP. Our intensive evaluation by trace-driven simulation shows ASAP is highly effective and easy to implement on the Internet for building large and scalable VoIP systems.Finally, aiming at building an infrastructure-independent user-level facility, we present our design, implementation, and evaluation of a topology-aware BT system, called TopBT, to significantly improve the Internet resource utilization without degrading user downloading performance. A TopBT client actively discovers network proximities (to connected peers), and uses both proximities and transmission rates to maintain fast downloading while reducing the transmitting distance of the BT traffic and thus the Internet traffic. We have implemented TopBT based on widely used open-source BT client code base, and made the software publicly available. By deploying TopBT and other BitTorrent clients on hundreds of Internet hosts, we show that on average TopBT can save a significant amount of download traffic while achieving faster download speed compared to several prevalent BT clients. TopBT has attracted a large number of downloads for a wide usage across the world. It has also been integrated into a major BT system for testing and a potential adoption in mainstream BT systems.",

Considering access latencies as major costs of data management in such a system, we show that the total cost of any replacement algorithm is bounded by the total costs of evicted blocks plus the total cost of the optimal off-line algorithm (OPT). We propose two off-line heuristics: MIN-d and MIN-cod, as well as an on-line algorithm: HD-cod, which can be run efficiently and perform well at the same time. Our simulation results with Storage Performance Council (SPC)'s storage server traces show that: (1) for off-line workloads, MIN-cod performs as well as OPT in some cases, all is atmost three times worse in all test case; (2) for on-line workloads, HD-cod performs closely to the best algorithms in all cases, and is the single algorithm that performs well in all test cases, including the optimal on-line algorithm (Landlord). Our study suggests that the essential issue to be considered be the trade-off between the costs of victim blocks and the total number of evictions in order to effectively optimize both efficiency and performance of distributed storage cache replacement algorithms.",

        "abstract": "With the dramatic increase of media traffic on the Internet, existing media systems have shown their inefficiencies in resource utilization and performance bottlenecks on high quality media services. Although the inconsistency between the media access patterns and the Zipf-like distributions of Web workloads has been observed by a number of measurement studies, existing media system designs and evaluations still assume that media workload has the same access pattern as that of conventional Web workload. An insightful understanding of media access patterns is essential to guide Internet system design and management, including resource provisioning and performance optimizations. In this Ph.D. dissertation, we analyze the access patterns of Internet media systems and study effective system designs for large scale media content delivery. With extensive measurements on the Internet, we find current media systems tend to over-supply or over-utilize server hardware and network bandwidth to provide high quality media service, which is not a scalable and effective approach for serving the explosively increasing media traffic on the Internet. We then systematically study the access patterns of different kinds of Internet media systems, in order to exploit the temporal locality among media requests for efficient and high performance system design. Our study shows that the reference ranks of media objects on the Internet follow stretched exponential distribution, despite different underlying systems and delivery techniques used. With this kind of access patterns, the performance of media caching in a client-server model is far less effective than that of Web content caching. We further analyze the evolution of object reference rank distributions in long duration media workloads, and find that the temporal locality in media systems increases with time. Thus, long term caching is beneficial to improve the performance of media systems. However, a high volume of storage size is required for long term caching, for which peer-to-peer (P2P) model is attractive. Our stretched exponential model lays out an analytical foundation to establish peer-to-peer caching systems for delivering the huge amount of media content on the Internet. We further conduct a performance study of BitTorrent-like P2P systems for large scale media delivery. Through modeling and analysis, we find although the existing BitTorrent system is effective for addressing the \u201cflash crowd\u201d problem upon the debut of a new file, it has service unavailability and performance instability problems after a period of time, due to the exponentially decreasing peer arrival rate. We then quantitatively analyze the interaction among multiple BitTorrent systems with a graph-based model, and show that intertorrent collaboration is much more effective than stimulating seed peers to serve longer for addressing the service and performance problems in BitTorrent systems. Finally, we propose PROP, a P2P-assisted media caching system, which utilizes peer-to-peer collaboration to provide service scalability and dedicated servers to provide service reliability.",

        "abstract": "The benefits of virtualized IT environments, such as compute clouds, have drawn interested enterprises to migrate their applications onto new platforms to gain the advantages of reduced hardware and energy costs, increased flexibility and deployment speed, and reduced management complexity. However, the process of migrating a complex application takes a considerable amount of effort, particularly when performing post-migration testing to verify that the application still functions correctly in the target environment. The traditional approach of test case generation and execution can take weeks and synthetic test cases may not adequately reflect actual application usage. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a black-box approach for post-migration testing of Web applications without manually creating test cases. A Web proxy is put in front of the production application to intercept all requests from real users, and these requests are simultaneously sent to the production and migrated applications. Results generated by both applications are then compared, and mismatches due to migration problems can be easily detected and presented to testing teams for resolution. We implement this approach in Splitter, a software module that is deployed as a reverse Web proxy. Through our evaluation using a number of real applications, we show that it Splitter can effectively automate post-migration testing while also reduce the number of mismatches that must be manually inspected. Equally important, it imposes a relatively small performance overhead on the production environment.",

        "abstract": "Application problem diagnosis in complex enterprise environments is a challenging problem, and contributes significantly to the growth in IT management costs. While application problems have a large number of possible causes, failures due to runtime interactions with the system environment (e.g., configuration files, resource limitations, access permissions) are one of the most common categories. Troubleshooting these problems requires extensive experience and time, and is very difficult to automate. In this paper, we propose a black-box approach that can automatically diagnose several classes of application faults using applications' runtime behaviors. These behaviors along with various system states are combined to create signatures that serve as a baseline of normal behavior. When an application fails, the faulty behavior is analyzed against the signature to identify deviations from expected behavior and likely cause. We implement a diagnostic tool based on this approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in a number of case studies with realistic problems in widely-used applications. We also conduct a number of experiments to show that the impact of the diagnostic tool on application performance (with some modifications of platform tracing facilities), as well as storage requirements for signatures, are both reasonably low.",

This work is mainly motivated by an experimental metric using network latency to measure and evaluate the scalability of parallel programs and architectures. Experiments of running a large physics simulation program and its scaling variations on the KSR-1 multiprocessor have been intensively conducted in this study. The scalability data are collected and visualized by an integrated software environment, called S-Graph. Our objectives are to address fundamental issues of parallel computing scalability, such as evaluation models, analytical and experimental metrics, and measurement methodology; to examine latency patterns inherent in the architecture and the program and their effects on scalability; and to evaluate relative merits and limits of several existing metrics. Our comparisons indicate that both time-bound and memory-bound models have their limitations for evaluating scalability performance, while efficiency-based model could obtain reasonably precise measurements.",

We report experimental results of evaluating the scalability of several scientific computing algorithms on the KSR-1. In comparison, we also present preliminary experiments on the CM-5 multicomputer architecture. Our comparisons indicate that the CM-5 has less network latency effects and is a more scalable architecture the the KSR-1.

This paper focuses on comparative performance modeling and evaluation of CC-NUMA and COMA on a hierarchical ring shared-memory architecture. Analytical models for the two memory systems for comparative evaluation are presented. Intensive performance measurements on data migrations have been conducted on the KSR-1, a COMA hierarchical ring shared-memory machine. Experimental results support the analytical models, and we present practical observations and comparisons of the two cache coherence memory systems. Our analytical and experimental results show that a COMA system balances the work load well. However the overhead of frequent data movement may match the gains obtained from improving load balance. We believe our performance results could be further generalized to the two memory systems on a hierarchical network architecture.

        "abstract": "Although Web prefetching is regarded as an effective method to improve client access performance, the asso- ciated overhead prevents it from being widely deployed. Specifically, a major weakness in existing Web servers is that prefetching activities are scheduled independently of dynamically changing server workloads. Without proper control and coordination between the two kinds of activi- ties, prefetching can negatively affect the Web services and degrade Web access performance. In this paper, we first de- velopan openqueuingmodelto characterizedetailedtrans- actionsin Web servers. Using this model, we analyze server resource utilization and average response time with differ- ent request arrival rates when prefetching is involved under different kinds of Web services. Guided by this model, we then design a responsive and adaptive prefetching scheme that dynamically adjusts the prefetching aggressiveness in Web servers. Our scheme not only prevents the Web servers from being overloaded, but it can also minimize the aver- age server response time. We have effectively implemented this scheme on an Apache Web server. Our measurement- based performance evaluation shows our model can accu- rately predict the utilization of Web server resources andthe correspondent average response time.",

        "abstract": "Prediction by partial match (PPM) is a commonly used technique in Web prefetching, where prefetching decisions are made based on historical URLs in a dynamically maintained Markov prediction tree. Existing approaches either widely store the URL nodes by building the tree with a fixed height in each branch, or only store the branches with frequently accessed URLs. Building the popularity information into the Markov prediction tree, we propose a new prefetching model, called popularity-based PPM. In this model, the tree is dynamically updated with a variable height in each set of branches where a popular URL can lead a set of long branches, and a less popular document leads a set of short ones. Since majority root nodes are popular URLs in our approach, the space allocation for storing nodes are effectively utilized. We have also included two additional optimizations in this model: (1) directly linking a root node to duplicated popular nodes in a surfing path to give popular URLs more considerations for prefetching; and (2) making a space optimization after the tree is built to further remove less popular nodes. Our trace-driven simulation results comparatively show a significant space reduction and an improved prediction accuracy of the proposed prefetching technique.",

        "abstract": "The diverse server, client, and unique file object types used today slow Web performance. Caching alone offers limited performance relief because it cannot handle many different file types easily.One solution combines caching with Web prefetching: obtaining the Web data a client might need from data about that client's past surfing activity. The prediction by partial match model, for example, makes prefetching decisions by reviewing URLs clients have accessed on a particular server, then structuring them in a Markov predictor tree. The authors propose a variation of this model that builds common surfing patterns and regularities into the tree.",

        "abstract": "A comprehensive study was carried out on amorphous metal-organic frameworks Mn-MIL-100 as efficient catalysts towards CO oxidation. This study focuses on explaining the crystalline-amorphous-crystalline transformations during thermolysis process of Mn-MIL-100 and studying the structure changes during the reaction process for CO oxidation. A possible formation mechanism of amorphous Mn-MIL-100 was proposed. Amorphous Mn-MIL-100 obtained by calcination at 250\u00b0C (a-Mn-250) showed a smaller specific surface area (4 m2/g), but displayed a high catalytic activity. Furthermore, the structure of amorphous Mn-MIL-100 was labile during the reaction process. When used a-Mn-250 were treated with reaction atmosphere at high temperature (named used a-Mn-250-S), the amorphous catalysts transformed to Mn2O3. Meanwhile, BET surface area (164 m2/g) and the catalytic performance both sharply increased. In addition, used a-Mn-250-S catalyst transformed from Mn2O3 to Mn3O4, resulting in the slightly decrease of catalytic activity under the presence of 1 vol% water vapor in the stream. A schematic of the structure changes during the reaction process was proposed. The achievement of our synthesis relies on the increase of BET surface area using CO as retreatment atmosphere, and the enhanced catalytic activity was attributed to the unique structure, a high quantity of surface active oxygen species, oxygen vacancies and good low temperature reduction behavior.",

        "abstract": "A series of flower-like Mg-Al-layered double hydroxides (FHMA) with four Mg/Al ratios were successfully prepared via a simple method which put the mixed solution of magnesium and aluminum in the mixed solution of water and ethylene glycol (EG). After calcination under 600\u00a0\u00b0C, the calcination products (CFHMA) were used to adsorb bromate anionic from aqueous solution. The FHMA, CFHMA, and reconstructed CFHMA were characterized by FT-IR, XRD spectra, TG/DTA, N adsorption-desorption isotherm, and SEM. It was found that FHMA had the flower-like morphology when Mg/Al ratio was 2 and 3. Moreover, FHMA lost the layered structures during calcination under 600\u00a0\u00b0C, but the disappeared structures were reconstructed after adsorption of bromate anionic, which was attributed to the \"reformation effect\" of FHMA with bromate as an interlayer anion. A series of adsorption studies were performed and the mechanism and reactivity of CFHMA were discussed including the effect of different kind of equilibration conditions, such as initial bromate anionic concentration, adsorbent dosage, contact time, initial solution pH, and co-existing anions. The results of adsorption displayed that the most suitable calcination temperature of FHMA is 600\u00a0\u00b0C, and the best ratio of Mg/Al is 2:1 to remove bromate anionic pollutant from water. The equilibrium adsorption data of CFHMA revealed a good compliance with the Langmuir model and the experimental data of CFHMA fitted well to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The calcination product of FHMA was a decent adsorbent of bromate anionic pollutant.",

The adsorption performance of PFOA was investigated by a batch experiment. All kinds of factors affecting the adsorption of PFOA, including adsorbent dosage, initial concentration, adsorption time, temperature, stirring intensity, coexistent anions, initial solution pH, natural organic matter, ion strength, and bed volume were studied. Moreover, the response surface methodology was put into use to know the key parameters affecting PFOA removal efficiency. The sorption equilibrium and kinetic data could conform well to the Langmuir and pseudo-second-order model, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters were obtained, and it was observed that the adsorption of PFOA onto MIEX resin was an endothermic and spontaneous process at the temperatures under investigation. It was summarized that both chemical absorption and physical adsorption were involved in the PFOA sorption onto the MIEX resin. Moreover, the MIEX resin could be effectively regenerated using a saturated sodium chloride solution. A series of batch experiments and characterizations demonstrated that the MIEX resin possessed a strong adsorption ability with the removal efficiency exceeding 90%, allowing a possible practical application in future water treatment.",

Adsorption/desorption kinetics of gaseous toluene over pristine UiO-66 and micro-mesoporous UiO-66 were investigated by breakthrough experiments, toluene vapor adsorption isotherm measurements and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. The interactions between toluene and UiO-66 samples were assessed through the Henry's law constant (K) and the isosteric adsorption heat (\u0394H). The micro-mesoporous UiO-66 crystal demonstrated 2.6 times toluene adsorption capacity of the pristine UiO-66 when the P123/Zr molar ratio was 0.2. Results showed that micropore adsorption was the main adsorption process and the larger pores in micro-mesoporous UiO-66 increased molecular diffusion rate and reduced the mass transfer resistance. This result indicated that micro-mesoporous structures and defect sites had a positive effect on toluene molecules capture. The breakthrough times and the working capacities decreased with the increase of the relative humidity and adsorption temperature. A good thermal stability and reproducibility were revealed over the micro-mesoporous UiO-66 in this paper.",

In the present study, the best degradation efficiency of CBZ was obtained in solution with 10\u00a0mM H 2 O 2 , where the dose constant was 2.63\u00a0kGy \u22121 ; while the highest mineralization level (41% TOC removal) was achieved in solution with 50\u00a0mM H 2 O 2 . Five carboxylic acids and twelve organic transformation products (TPs) were identified and determined during the irradiation processes. On the basis of the tendency of TPs, possible transformation mechanisms of CBZ with the combinative processes of electron beam and H 2 O 2  were proposed.

The catalysts were characterized by N 2  adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), H 2 -temperature program reduction (H 2 -TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS). The catalytic activity for CO oxidation over Mn 2 O 3  catalysts was investigated. It was found that calcination temperature had a strong effect on the structure and catalytic activity of Mn 2 O 3  catalyst. Mn 2 O 3  catalyst obtained by calcined at 700\u00a0\u00b0C (Mn 2 O 3 -700) showed a smaller specific surface area, but displayed a high catalytic activity and excellent stability with a complete CO conversion temperature (T 98 ) of 240\u00a0\u00b0C, which was attributed to the unique structure, a high quantity of surface active oxygen species, smaller particle size, oxygen vacancies and good low temperature reduction behavior. The effect of water vapor on catalytic activity was also examined. The introduction of water vapor to the feedstock induced a positive effect on CO oxidation over Mn 2 O 3 -700 catalyst. Furthermore, no obvious drop is observed in activity over catalysts even in the presence of water vapor during 48\u00a0h.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The paper presents a novel and facile method for preparing cauliflowerlike CeO 2  through direct decomposition of cerium based metal-organic framework (MOF) Ce-BTC (BTC\u00a0=\u00a01,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid) straw in air. Several analytical tools such as Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetric (TG), N 2  adsorption-desorption, Temperature programmed reduction (TPR), Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) and Photoluminescence (PL) have been used to characterize Ce-BTC and CeO 2 . The Ce-BTC calcined at 500\u00a0\u00b0C (CeO 2 -500) maintains the morphology of its template \u201cCe-BTC\u201d and forms a special cauliflower-like structure. XRD patterns showed that the catalyst has a perfect CeO 2  crystal structure and has a smaller particle size. The prepared CeO 2  cauliflowers exhibit excellent catalytic activities, long-term stability, and cycling stability for CO oxidation. The improved catalytic activities could be attributed to porous nanorods of CeO 2  cauliflowers, which provide more active sites and oxygen vacancy for CO oxidation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   It is very important to design excellent heterojunction structure for the improvement of the photocatalytic performance. In this study, we report a facile approach of polymerizing the ultrathin graphene oxide on the surface of the MIL-88A(Fe) to form MIL-88A(Fe)/grapheme oxide composite for enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency of organic molecules degradation. The optical grapheme oxide doping content in MIL-88A(Fe)/grapheme oxide hybrid is determined to be 9.0 wt%\uff0cwhich increases the surface area of the MOFs from 15.9\u00a0m 2 g \u22121  to 408.9\u00a0m 2 g \u22121  due to the emerging micropores, and the corresponding photocatalytic rate for RhB is 8.4 times higher than that of pure MIL-88A(Fe). Meanwhile, DMF-free MOF-based heterostructure could avoid secondary contamination in the photocatalytic application process, and the degree of RhB removal is maintained at about 100% after the five cycles of the reaction. Integrating the related electrochemical analysis and the active species trapping experiments, the decisive factors for the improved photocatalytic efficiency of MIL-88A(Fe)/grapheme oxide may be the unique structural advantages of ultrathin grapheme oxide sheets, compact and uniform interface contact, more adsorption sites and more reaction sites. This work provides a novel sight for preparing high-efficient and environment-stable photocatalysts by designing the surface heterojunction structure.",

Satisfactorily, highly uniform and well dispersed octahedral CuO/Cu 2 O composite derived from CuBTC is successfully synthesized, which still retain the original morphology of the MOFs. Moreover, CuO/Cu 2 O composite showed an excellent catalytic performance, which was ascribed to the higher Cu 2 O/CuO ratio, good low temperature reduction behavior and a high quantity of surface active oxygen species.

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, the MnO 2  materials were successfully synthesized by reductive acidic leaching of waste material of used Zn-Mn batteries, which were next used as supports for copper catalysts and applied in carbon monoxide oxidation. The materials were characterized in detailed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS), Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), H 2 -temperature program reduction (H 2 -TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N 2  adsorption-desorption and scanning electron microscope (SEM). When Cu species was dropped on MnO 2 , the catalytic activity test showed that all doped MnO 2  catalysts exhibit much enhanced CO oxidation activity. It was found that the catalyst 7Cu/MnO 2  (Cu-loading: 7\u00a0wt%) was efficient for oxidizing carbon monoxide. The 7Cu-MnO 2  catalyst showed a high catalytic activity and excellent stability with a complete CO conversion temperature (T 100 ) of 120\u00a0\u00b0C, which was attributed to low temperature reduction ability, Cu 2+ , smaller particle size and a high quantity of surface active oxygen species and oxygen vacancies. The high catalytic activity suggested that Cu species doping could make the CO reaction with lattice oxygen together with the formation of oxygen vacancies, which is beneficial to CO oxidation. Further, the effect of water vapor on catalytic activity was also examined. The introduction of water vapor to the feedstock induced a very little negative effect on CO oxidation over 7Cu/MnO 2  catalyst. The facile and promising strategy employed in this study could be expanded to the fabrication of other catalysts with the green reuse of used batteries as supports.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A metal organic framework Ce-BTC derivative with a special morphology and a large surface area was prepared by a simple method. Several analytical tools such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), N 2  adsorption-desorption (BET), H 2  temperature programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR), ultraviolet visible diffuse reflectance spectrum (UV-Vis DRS), photoluminescence (PL), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) and elemental analysis (EA) have been used to characterize the samples. It is found that Ce-BTC calcined with O 2  at 250\u00a0\u00b0C (Ce-BTC 250 ) maintains the special strawsheave-like structure, and the surface area rapidly increases from 42 m 2  g -1  to 648 m 2  g -1 . Moreover, the prepared strawsheave-like Ce-BTC 250  exhibited excellent catalytic activity, long-term stability and water resistance. Further studies have shown that the MOF structure of Ce-BTC 250  was gradually converted to carbon-free CeO 2  during the catalytic reaction. Interestingly, the catalyst after the reaction still has a large surface area (124 m 2  g -1 ) and the strawsheave-like morphology. The improved catalytic activities may be due to the formation of porous and large surface area of strawsheave-like Ce-BTC derivative, which provided more active sites and oxygen vacancy for CO oxidation. This work provides a novel sight for preparing high efficient carbon-free derivative with large surface area by controlling synthesis and reaction conditions of Ce based MOF.",

The nanohybrids were systematically characterized by XRD, FT-IR, TGA, TEM, SEM, EDS elemental mappings, XPS, N 2  adsorption-desorption isotherms, PL and DRS. It was found that the addition of moderate g-C 3 N 4  could enhance the separation and migration rate of photo-induced charges, consequently leading to the increase of photocatalytic efficiency. The CNUO-1 nanohybrid exhibited better photocatalytic activity for the oxidation of Rh B under visible light irradiation, and displayed about 6.0 and 3.3 times faster than that of g-C 3 N 4  and UiO-66, respectively. Meanwhile, the nanohybrid showed excellent stability and reusability in four cyclic experiments. Finally, the increased photocatalytic reaction mechanism was also proposed.

In this research, we integrate plasmonic Ag/AgCl with a typical semiconductor-like metal-organic framework MIL-88A(Fe) to form Ag/AgCl@MIL-88A(Fe) (ACMA) nanocomposites by a facile one-pot solvothermal method. The results demonstrate that ACMA nanocomposites not only broaden the visible-light absorption of MOFs, but also greatly accelerate photo-induced charge transfer rate. EDS mapping and HRTEM results suggest that Ag/AgCl is uniformly and densely dispersed on the surface of MOF, which is beneficial for charge flow and expedites the charge migration. By virtue of the structural and compositional features, these unique ACMA nanocomposites perform excellent photocatalytic activity on ibuprofen (IBP) in terms of high degradation efficiency, high mineralization and excellent cycling stability. ACMA-2 (Fe:Ag\u202f=\u202f2:1) displays highly efficient photocatalytic activity on IBP under visible light irradiation, and the corresponding photo-degradation rate is 10.8 and 40.4 folds higher than that of MIL-88A(Fe) and Ag/AgCl, respectively. Total organic carbon (TOC) removal of IBP photodegradation reaches 91% by the catalysis of ACMA-2. Combined with the electrochemical tests, quencher experiments and analysis of related degradation products identified by ion chromatography (IC) and LC-MS-MS, oxidation by superoxide radicals ( O 2  \u2212 ) as well as holes (h + ) and electrons (e \u2212 ) is the dominant degradation process in the photocatalytic degradation of IBP. This work provides a new perspective for the preparation of environment-stable and efficient MOF-based photocatalysts by steering charge flow.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, CuO/CeO 2  catalysts derived from Ce-BTC metal organic framework as the precursor were synthesized by various methods (in-situ synthesis method, mechanical mixing method and impregnation method). The precursors and catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), N 2  adsorption-desorption, H 2 -temperature program reduction (H 2 -TPR), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that the preparation methods strongly affected the low temperature reduction behavior and oxygen vacancies of CuO/CeO 2  catalysts. The CuCeO-ETH catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity for CO oxidation (T 100 \u00a0=\u00a0100\u00a0\u00b0C). Meanwhile, a broad temperature window to match CO conversion and selectivity higher than 98% at the same time appeared for preferential CO oxidation. In addition, the CuCeO-ETH catalyst displayed high reaction stability and CO catalytic performance for CO oxidation and preferential CO oxidation even after three cycles. The addition of H 2 O and CO 2  in the stream caused a lightly decrease in the CO conversion. The CuCeO-ETH catalyst still maintains a CO conversion of 100% at 130\u00a0\u00b0C. The improved catalytic performance for CO oxidation and preference CO oxidation could be attributed to easily reducible surface copper species, more Cu + , oxygen vacancies and surface lattice oxygen.",

The as-prepared materials were characterized by XRD, FESEM, TEM, XPS and PL analysis. It was showed that the introduction of a certain amount of g-C 3 N 4  on the surface of MIL-53(Fe) would improve the separation and migration rate of photo-induced charges, consequently resulting in the boost of photocatalytic efficiency. Compared with g-C 3 N 4  and MIL-53(Fe), the CMFe composites displayed more excellent visible light-resposive photocatalytic activity for the reduction of Cr(VI). The optimal doping content of g-C 3 N 4  in g-C 3 N 4 /MIL-53(Fe) composite was determined to be 3.0\u00a0wt%, and it showed about 2.1 and 2.0 times as high photocatalytic efficiency for the reduction of Cr(VI) as that of pure g-C 3 N 4  and MIL-53(Fe), respectively. Meanwhile, the composite exhibited good reusability and stability in the process of cyclic experiments. A possible photocatalytic reaction mechanism was also investigated in detail by the related electrochemical analysis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   High photocatalytic hole-electron pairs separation efficiency and the wide use of inexpensive and earth-abundant materials as cocatalysts in most semiconductor-based photocatalytic systems are desired for improving the photocatalytic activity and practical application. Herein, we report a facile one-pot solvothermal approach of integrating stable metallic nonmetal materials 1T-MoS 2  nanosheets with MIL-53(Fe) to form needle-shaped 1T-MoS 2 @MIL-53(Fe) (TSMF) composites. Interestingly, the introduction of 1T-MoS 2  turns nonspecial-structured MIL-53(Fe) into needle-like structure and the BET analysis reveals that the optimal TSMF composites possess abundant coexistence of micropores and mesopores with a large surface area of 337\u202fm 2 \u202fg \u22121 , which is about 16 folds higher than that of the pure MOFs. Meanwhile, it is remarkable that the photocatalytic rate of ibuprofen (IBP) by optimal TSMF nanocomposites has improved 7.5 and 9.4 times compared to the pristine MIL-53(Fe) and 1T-MoS 2 , respectively. The photocatalytic efficiency of TSMF composites enhances due to the emerging micropores, which can provide more adsorption and reaction sites. In addition, the formed compact and uniform interface contact between 1T-MoS 2  sheets and MOF may dramatically accelerate the separation of the photo-induced charges, thus enhance the photocatalytic activity. We also study the photocatalytic mechanism combined the corresponding electrochemical testing and the photo-degradation intermediates identified by ion chromatography (IC) and LC\u2013MS-MS, indicating that superoxide radicals ( O 2  \u2013 ), hydroxyl radical ( OH) and electrons (e \u2212 ) are the main active radicals in IBP photocatalysis and decarboxylation and hydroxylation are the main degradation pathways of IBP.",

Catalyst characterization indicated that La 2 MnNiO 6 -CCX displayed hierarchical porous structure which can significantly enhance the catalytic efficiency by ensuring better dispersion of La 2 MnNiO 6  and increasing desired active sites for adsorption. The reactivity of catalyst was investigated by the microwave degradation of humic acid as a model pollutant, which exhibited more efficient catalytic activity than pure La 2 MnNiO 6 . Moreover, La 2 MnNiO 6 -CCX showed good reusability, suggesting it as an effective and promising catalyst in water treatment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A novel hybrid hydrogel was synthesized from grafting of acrylamide and N-isopropyl acrylamide onto lignin by incorporation of montmorillonite under ultrasonic irradiation (lignin-g-p(AM-co-NIPAM)/MMT). The hydrogel was characterized by electron microscopy-energy dispersion spectrometer (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and mechanical strength analysis. The results showed that the hybrid hydrogel displayed thinner pore walls, better thermal stability and mechanical strength after hybriding with montmorillonite. The hydrogel was employed for the removal of methylene blue from the aqueous solution, and it exhibited good swelling\u2013deswelling property. The initial swelling kinetic was Fickian type diffusion and the whole swelling process was good fit for Schottu0027s pseudo-second order model. The adsorption process was found to be highly pH and temperature dependent and followed the pseudo-second-order rate model. The equilibrium adsorption data were found to fit well to the Langmuir and Freundlich models, with an optimum adsorption value of 9646.92\u00a0mg\u00a0g \u22121 . The hydrogel presented excellent regeneration capacity and was successfully used for five cycles of adsorption\u2013desorption. In summary, the hydrogel has shown its potential as an environment friendly and efficient adsorbent for the adsorption of dyes from wastewater.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A series of octahedral structure Cu-BTC derivatives were successfully achieved through direct calcination of copper based metal organic framework Cu-BTC under different atmosphere (CO reaction gas, oxidizing gas O 2 , reducing gas H 2 , inert gas Ar). The Cu-BTC derivatives were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS), N 2  adsorption-desorption isotherm, element analysis, H 2 -temperature program reduction (H 2 -TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS). It is found that Cu-BTC derivative derived from MOF calcined under reaction gas/O 2  (Cu-BTC-CO/Cu-BTC-O) only retain Cu 2 O and CuO species. In addition, a weak Cu-BTC structure and Cu particles were observed on Cu-BTC derivative derived from MOF calcined under H 2  (Cu-BTC-H). Obviously differently, Cu-BTC derivative derived from MOF calcined under Ar (Cu-BTC-Ar) still retains good MOF structure. The catalytic performance for CO oxidation over Cu-BTC derivatives was studied. It was found that Cu-BTC-CO showed a smaller specific surface area (8.0\u00a0m 2 /g), but presented an excellent catalytic performance, long-term stability and cycling stability with a complete CO conversion temperature (T 100 ) of 140\u00a0\u00b0C, which was ascribed to the higher Cu 2 O/CuO ratio, good low temperature reduction behavior and a high quantity of surface active oxygen species.",

The as-prepared composites were used in microwave (MW) catalytic degradation of fuchsin basic (FB) dye wastewater. Batch experiment results showed that the catalytic degradation of FB could be remarkably improved by coating with CA. And LaFe 0.5 Cu 0.5 O 3 -CA exhibited higher catalytic performance than LaFe 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 3 -CA, which had a close connection with the activity of substitution metal ion in B site of the catalysts. The FB removal fit pseudo-first-order model and the degradation rate constant increased with initial pH value and MW powder while decreases with initial FB concentration. All catalysts presented favorable recycling and stability in the repeated experiment. Radical scavenger measurements indicated that hydroxyl radicals rather than surface peroxide and hole played an important role in the catalytic process, and its quantity determined the degradation of FB. Furthermore, both Cu and Fe species were involved in the formation of active species, which were responsible to the excellent performance of the LaFe 0.5 Cu 0.5 O 3 -CA/MW system. Therefore, LaFe 0.5 Cu 0.5 O 3 -CA/MW showed to be a promising technology for the removal of organic pollutants in wastewater treatment applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Two modified hydrogels, CL- g - p AA and CL- g - p DMC, are prepared from hydrogels graft copolymerization with acrylic acid and methacryloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, respectively. The as prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Thermogravimetric (TG). Batch experiments were performed to determine the ability of CL- g - p AA and CL- g - p DMC to remove Cr(VI) from solution. The effect of pH, dosage and co-existing anions on Cr(VI) removal were investigated along with regeneration activity. The adsorption of Cr(VI) decreases with the increase of pH and temperature. The introduction of \u2212COOH and-[N + (CH 3 ) 3 ] (NR 3  + ) groups on hydrogels increases Cr(VI) adsorption capacity. Based on cost and actual water considerations the optimum adsorption occurs at pH 5, at a temperature of 298\u2009k, with an adsorbent dose of 0.1 g\u2009L \u22121  and with the contact time 500\u2009min for the Cr (VI) removal. The usual metal ions of natural water would not inhibit the complexion reaction between hydrogels and Cr(VI). The modified hydrogels exhibited adsorption capacities of 85.47\u2009mg\u2009g \u22121  for CL- g - p AA and 105.26 mg\u2009g \u22121  for CL- g - p DMC. The adsorption kinetic studies display adsorption to be the pseudo-second-order rate model. The adsorption isotherms of Cr(VI) on the CL- g - p AA and CL- g - p DMC were well fitted by the Langmuir isotherm equation. The Cr(VI) adsorption is endothermic and the CL- g - p DMC exhibits high regeneration efficiency. From the results, it was concluded that CL- g - p AA and CL- g - p DMC were underlying materials for the separation and preconcentration of Cr(VI) from wastewater.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Flower-like Ag/ZnO samples were successfully fabricated via a simple and cost efficient method without surfactants. The morphologies, structural and optical properties of Ag/ZnO samples with various Ag content were investigated. The samples were systematically characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N 2  adsorption-desorption isotherm, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). It was found that ZnO was wurtzite phase and metallic Ag particles were wrapped by ZnO nanosheets. Compared with pure metallic Ag, the binding energy of Ag 3d for the Ag/ZnO samples distinctly shifted to the lower binding energy, which was attributed to the interaction between ZnO and Ag. With the increase of Ag content, surface plasmon absorption band of Ag/ZnO samples was obviously widened; meanwhile, PL intensity was decreased. The photocatalytic performance of Ag/ZnO samples were carried out by the degradation of methylene blue (MB) solution under visible light irradiation. The deposition of a certain amount of Ag was beneficial to the improvement of photocatalytic activity. The degradation rate of the Ag/ZnO sample with Ag/Zn ratio 1/20 was greater than fourfold times faster than that of ZnO. It was suggested that photoexcited electrons transferred from Ag to ZnO due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which could effectively reduce the recombination of electron\u2013hole pairs and prolong lifetime of the electron\u2013holes pairs, promoting the degradation efficiency. The deposition of a large amount of Ag was unfavorable for the formation of flower-like Ag/ZnO samples, and caused the decrease of specific surface area and the aggregation of Ag nanoparticles, leading to the reduction of photocatalytic performance.",

In this study, a new catalytic degradation technology using microwave (MW) induced templated-double perovskite was proposed and applied in the treatment of SA in aqueous solution. A series of LaCo 1-   x  Cu  x  O 3 @PMMA ( X \u202f=\u202f0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1) perovskite-type catalysts with three-dimensionally porous network structure were synthesized by polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) templating method, and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N 2  adsorption-desorption analysis (BET), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and microwave network analysis. The results showed that the addition of PMMA template and substitution with Cu ( x \u202f=\u202f0.5) were beneficial to the generation of LaCo 0.5 Cu 0.5 O 3 @PMMA with high catalytic activity, which possessed unique 3D porous network structure, smaller particle size distribution, better microwave absorbing performance and higher ratios of Co 3+ /Co 2+  and O ads /O latt . The SA removal fit pseudo-first-order model, and its degradation efficiency increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of MW intensity, solution pH and catalyst dosage, while decreased as initial SA concentration increasing. The LaCo 0.5 Cu 0.5 O 3 @PMMA catalyst presented favorable recycling and stability in the repeated experiment. The excellent catalytic activity was attributed to both active species and MW \u201chot spots\u201d, among which  OH and     h   vb   +     played main roles in the catalytic process, and MW \u201chot spots\u201d effect had a small contribution to the degradation. Hence, LaCo 0.5 Cu 0.5 O 3 @PMMA/MW technology with rapid degradation and negligible secondary pollution provides a potential way for treating salicylic acid in water.",

Adsorption and desorption performance as well as the corresponding kinetics of toluene vapor for UiO-66 and the modified materials were intensively studied. The physical and chemical properties of the sample were obtained by a series of characterization techniques. As indicated by the experiments, the number of missing-linker defect sites in UiO-66 were influenced by the CTAB concentration. The presence of the defect sites was served as the main active adsorption sites for efficient toluene vapor adsorption. In result, adsorptive capacity of toluene over CTAB-U-0.5 was improved to 275\u2009mg\u2009g, which was much higher than that of UiO-66 (151\u2009mg\u2009g).

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, highly active Ag/Fe 2 O 3  catalysts derived from MIL-100(Fe) were synthesized by a traditional wet impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by N 2  adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), H 2 -temperature program reduction (H 2 -TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The effects of Fe/Ag ratios and pretreatment atmosphere on the structure and catalytic activity for CO oxidation of Ag/Fe 2 O 3  catalysts were investigated. It was found that rarefied oxygen environment in a muffle furnace was beneficial to the formation of small size Ag 0  species and larger specific surface area, which could be due to the reductive gases (H 2 ) produced by the decomposition of MIL-100(Fe) and nitrate. The Ag/Fe 2 O 3  catalyst with Fe/Ag atomic ratio of 15 calcined in a muffle furnace showed a high catalytic performance (T 100 \u202f=\u202f160\u202f\u00b0C), stability and reproducibility, which could be related to the large number of Ag 0  species on the surface and larger specific surface area. In addition, the effect of water vapor on catalytic activity was also studied. The activity of Ag/Fe 2 O 3  catalyst with Fe/Ag ratio of 15 was slightly affected by the 1\u202fvol.% moisture in the feed gas, but still show high catalytic activity with T 100 \u202f=\u202f190\u202f\u00b0C.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nano-sized hollow-CdS@g-C 3 N 4  core-shell spheres with different g-C 3 N 4  contents were synthesized by a combined ultrasonication and chemisorption method. The materials were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) and UV\u2013vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (UV\u2013Vis), etc. The photocatalytic hydrogen production activities of these hollow core-shell spheres were evaluated in water under visible light illumination with Na 2 S and Na 2 SO 3  as sacrificial reagents. Material characterizations showed that g-C 3 N 4  was moderately coated on CdS hollow nano-spheres with intimate contacts. It was found that the g-C 3 N 4  coating could significantly improve the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of pure hollow CdS nano-spheres and g-C 3 N 4  coating content of 5\u202fwt% produced the highest hydrogen evolution rate. It is proposed that the synergistic effect of CdS core and g-C 3 N 4  shell effectively promotes the charge separation and facilitates the transfer of corrosive holes from CdS to more robust C 3 N 4 , and therefore results in enhanced photocatalytic activity and photo-stability.",

To characterize the hydrothermally synthesized products, XRD, UV\u2013vis DRS, TEM, HRTEM and XPS were carried out. Extraordinarily high hydrogen evolution rate under visible light irradiation (\u03bb\u202f\u2265\u202f400\u202fnm) can be achieved. TEM images show that MnS is uniformly coated on the surface of CdS nanorods. The hydrogen evolution results show that coated MnS can significantly improve the photocatalytic efficiency of CdS nanorods. The hydrogen evolution rate reaches an optimal value up to 15.55\u202fmmol\u202fg \u22121 h \u22121  with MnS content of 5\u202fwt% and is about 3.44 times higher than that of bare CdS nanorods. The large and intimate coaxial heterojunction between CdS nanorod core and MnS thin shell benefits the separation and transportation of photo-induced charge carriers.",

The XRD results confirmed the presence of pure wurtzite ZnO structure and metal Ag in flower-like precursor. The SEM and TEM results revealed that the obtained nanocomposites well inherited the morphology of the precursor and Ag particles deposited on the inside of the nanocomposites. The UV\u2013vis diffuse reflection and PL spectra showed that ZnO/Ag nanocomposites exhibited tunable optical properties.

Results show that MEK can be efficiently decomposed over synthesized Pt0.3Mnx/SiO2-nc materials with a reaction rate and turnover frequency respectively higher than 12.7 mmol gPt\u20131 s\u20131 and 4.7 s\u20131 at 100 \u00b0C.

The remarkable performance of these catalysts is attributed to a synergistic effect between the Pt nanoparticles and Mn2O3. NH3-TPD and NH3-FT-IR experiments revealed that exposed Mn2O3 (222) facets enhance the quantity of Bronsted acid sites in the catalyst, which are considered to be responsible for promoting the desorption of surface-adsorbed O2 and CO2.

        "abstract": "Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are good absorbents that provide high specific surface area, modified pore surface and controllable pore size. The aim of this work is to prepare a MOFs material with good toluene adsorption property in the presence of water. In this paper, modified UiO-66 (University of Oslo 66) was successfully synthesized with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as structure-directing agent by a simple solvothermal method. The physical and chemical properties were obtained by a series of characterization instruments. Some missing-linker defect sites were observed on modified materials (defective UiO-66) and were known as the main active sites for toluene adsorption. The defective UiO-66 (PVP-U-0.5, 259\u202fmg\u202fg) demonstrated 1.7 times toluene adsorption capacity of the pristine UiO-66 (151\u202fmg\u202fg) when the PVP/Zr ratio was 0.5. The interactions between toluene and UiO-66 and PVP-U-0.5 were assessed through the Henry's law constant (K) and the isosteric adsorption heat (\u0394H), which indicated that stronger interaction between PVP-U-0.5 and toluene molecules. Moreover, PVP-U-0.5 displayed good adsorption capacity (84\u202fmg\u202fg) at high relative humidity (70% RH). Water temperature programmed desorption experiments revealed that PVP-U-0.5 had more hydrophobic property, which provided a further possibility for practical application for the removal of toluene.",

The bandgap of the as-deposited and annealed films for 2\u202fh were 4.56 and 4.97\u202feV, respectively.

By means of combined DC tests at different temperatures and electric field dependence, we demonstrated the following original results: (1) It is proved that gate leakage is the main contribution to OFF-state leakage of ion-implantation isolated AlGaN/GaN MIS-HEMTs, and the gate leakage path is a series connection of the gate dielectric Si 3 N 4  and Si 3 N 4 -GaN interface. (2) The dominant mechanisms of the leakage current through LPCVD-Si 3 N 4  gate dielectric and Si 3 N 4 -GaN interface are identified to be Frenkel\u2013Poole emission and two-dimensional variable range hopping (2D-VRH), respectively. (3) A certain temperature annealing could reduce the density of the interface state that produced by ion implantation, and consequently suppress the interface leakage transport, which results in a decrease in OFF-state leakage current of ion-implantation isolated AlGaN/GaN MIS-HEMTs.",

The dual-gate device is based on a cascode connection of an E-mode and a D-mode gate. The simulation results show that electric field under the gate is decreased by more than 70% compared to that of the conventional E-mode MIS-HEMTs (from 2.83 MV/cm decreased to 0.83 MV/cm). Thus, with the discussion of ionized trap density, the proposed dual-gate structure can highly improve electric field-related reliability, such as, threshold voltage stability. In addition, compared with HEMT with field plate structure, the proposed structure exhibits a simplified fabrication process and a more effective suppression of high electric field.",

The temperature dependence of contact resistances (Rc) was investigated and it shows that there are different optimal annealing temperatures with different metal thicknesses and pretreatments. The optimal annealing temperature is affected by Al and Au thickness and AlGaN thickness. The etched AlGaN barrier is useful to achieve good ohmic contact (0.24 \u03a9\u00b7mm) with a low annealing temperature. Only the contact resistances of the samples with 130 nm Al layer kept stable and the contact resistances of the samples with 100nm and 160 nm Al layers increased with the measurement temperatures. The contact resistances showed a similar increase and then keep stable trend for all the samples in the long-term 400 \u00b0C aging process. The ohmic metal of 20/130/50/50 nm Ti/Al/Ni/Au with ICP etching is the superior candidate considering the contact resistance and reliability.",

It is found that two-dimensional variable range hopping is responsible for gate leakage current at the reverse gate bias and low forward gate bias in both high-leakage and low-leakage Schottky gate contact devices. At high forward gate bias, in the case of high-leakage Schottky contact, the dominant current conduction mechanism is found to be thermionic field emission while it is Poole\u2013Frenkle emission (PFE) for the case of low-leakage Schottky contact and the activation energy of trap states for PFE current is derived as 0.6\u2009eV. Besides, related models are also proposed to describe the gate leakage current in p-GaN gate HEMTs and they match well with the experimental gate leakage current within a wide range of temperatures and gate biases.",

        "abstract": "Activation of TRPV4 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 4) has been reported to result in endothelium-dependent contraction in the aortae of hypertensive mice. This contraction involved increased cPLA (cytosolic phospholipase A ) activity. The mechanism by which TRPV4 regulates cPLA activity to induce contraction in hypertension, however, is unknown. Through measurements of arterial tension and protein level, we showed that high salt diet induced hypertension increases activity of PKC (protein kinase C) and ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2). GSK1016790A, a TRPV4 agonist and ACh (acetylcholine) induced contractions were suppressed by Go6983, a PKC inhibitor and PD98059, an ERK1/2 inhibitor. TRPV4 activation increased activity of PKC and ERK1/2 in endothelial cells from hypertensive mice and this response was suppressed by HC067047, a TRPV4 inhibitor and BAPTA/AM, a Ca chelator. PLA assay and western blotting showed that blocking of PKC or ERK1/2 inhibited TRPV4 or ACh induced cPLA activity. Enzyme immunoassay showed that GSK1016790A or ACh triggered the release of PGF (prostaglandin F ) was reduced by inhibition of PKC or ERK1/2. These data further suggest Ca /PKC/ERK1/2 axis as a novel mechanism for TRPV4 in the activation of cPLA in hypertension. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "FAM83H-AS1, also known as oncogenic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-3, is a novel lncRNA that has been suggested to be dysregulated in a variety of human cancers. However, the expression status and function of FAM83H-AS1 in bladder cancer are still unknown. The object of our study is to explore the clinical value of FAM83H-AS1 in patients with bladder cancer and the biological function of FAM83H-AS1 in bladder cancer cells. In our results, the expression of FAM83H-AS1 was obviously elevated in bladder cancer tissue samples and bladder cancer cell lines compared with adjacent normal tissue samples and normal bladder epithelial cell lines, respectively. In addition, high expression of FAM83H-AS1 was associated with advanced clinical stage and\u00a0the presence of muscularis invasion and served as an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with bladder cancer. The loss-of-function study showed that silencing FAM83H-AS1 expression suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and induced cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. In conclusion, FAM83H-AS1 is involved in the progression of bladder cancer and serves as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for patients with bladder cancer.",

This study aims to assess the feasibility of using Hagen-Poiseuille equation as a tool for speculating Renal Pelvic Pressure (RPP) during F-URS. The ureteral access sheath and polyscope were placed in the upper urinary tract model in a standard fashion. A tube was placed in the renal pelvis transparenchymally for pressure measurement. A saline bag surrounded by the pressure cuff of a mercurial sphygmomanometer provided the irrigating fluid at a constant flow rate in the Polyscope under a given pressure. The 20 mmHg pressure gradient was set from 100 mmHg to 300 mmHg. After building the in vitro model, the pressure drop (\u0394P) across Polyscope was measured (\u0394Pm), or was calculated according to the Hagen-Poiseuille Equation (\u0394Pc). The flow rate (Q) was calculated by perfused fluid volume divided by the perfusion time. The variable (l) was obtained by length measuring. The radius (R) was available in the published literature. The viscosity of water and saline was tested. Finally, the \u0394Pc and \u0394Pm was compared statistically. Results showed that, \u0394Pc from Hagen-Poiseuille Equation failed to fit perfectly with \u0394Pm, but the regression model showed there was a strong linear relationship (R2=0.977) between them. The linear regression equation was established as \u0394Pm=0.992 \u0394Pc-29.498. Hagen-Poiseuille equation can be hopeful as a non-invasive validated tool for predicting the RPP during F-URS.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) remains a major problem for long-term graft survival and different pathways participate in its development. CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is significantly upregulated following renal injury and fibrotic response. We investigated the effect of AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, on the development of CAN in rat models. MATERIAL AND METHODS CAN rat models (n=20) were established using male Fisher 344 to Lewis rats. Rats in the experimental group (n=10) were treated with AMD3100 (1 mg/kg/day subcutaneously, 0-12 weeks), rats in the control group (n=10) were treated with saline. The serum creatinine levels were monitored every week. Kidney grafts were harvested 12 weeks after modeling for histological analysis. We used chronic allograft damage index (CADI) scores to evaluate each group. Q-PCR and Western blotting were used to measure CXCR4, TGF-\u03b21/Smad3 signaling pathway and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression in renal allograft tissue. RESULTS CXCR4 expression was increased significantly in the control group which developed intense chronic changes after 12 weeks. Histological changes of CAN in the experimental group were ameliorated by AMD3100 which also had better graft function compare to the control group. AMD3100 significantly blunted the increase in the mRNA expression level of CXCR4, TGF-\u03b21/Smad3, and \u03b1-SMA. A significant reduction in TGF-\u03b21 and \u03b1-SMA protein content was observed only in the experimental group as shown in a representative Western blot. CONCLUSIONS Based on these findings, CXCR4 expression may mediate in part the development of CAN. AMD3100 may ameliorate histological changes of CAN and maintain better allograft function. It blunts downstream effects of TGF-\u03b21 signaling and fibroblast activation. Therefore, antagonism of CXCR4 may provide a novel way to prevent the development of CAN.",

The two groups were compared with respect to the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF), level of graft function, and pathological changes in time-zero biopsy specimens. The incidence of DGF was 16.7 and 37.5% in the HMP and CCP groups, respectively; the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P\u2009 \u20090.05). Forty-eight kidney patients were followed up for 6 months, and the two groups of recipients all survived, yielding a survival rate of 100%. The mean 6-month serum creatinine levels were 98.7\u2009\u00b1\u200923.6 \u00b5mol/L in the HMP group and 105.3\u2009\u00b1\u200935.1 \u00b5mol/L in the CCP group; there was no significant difference between the two groups. HMP can reduce the incidence of DGF in DCD kidneys, and this effect is greater for expanded criteria donors kidneys. HMP can also improve early renal function.",

        "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignant tumors in men. Studies have observed that microRNA (miR)\u201119a\u20113p expression levels are downregulated in several types of cancer, and yet the biological function and its underlying mechanisms in the pathogenesis of PCa remain unclear. In the current study, the expression pattern of miR\u201119a\u20113p in PCa tissues and cell lines was detected by reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The proliferative, migratory and invasive capacity of PCa cells were determined using EdU and Transwell assays following transfection with miR\u201119a\u20113p mimics. Additionally, the current study investigated the biological impact and regulation of prostate transmembrane protein androgen induced\u00a01 (PMEPA1) in PCa cells by transfection with PMEPA1 small interfering (si)RNA. It was observed that miR\u201119a\u20113p was upregulated in PCa tissue samples and cell lines in\u00a0vitro. Functional analysis also confirmed that miR\u201119a\u20113p overexpression promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of PCa cells. Furthermore, PMEPA1 was identified as a direct target of miR\u201119a\u20113p, and siRNA knockdown of PMEPA1 resulted in increased proliferation, migration and invasion of PCa cells, which partially accounts for the effect of miR\u201119a\u20113p in tumor metastasis. In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggest that the upregulation of miR\u201119a\u20113p expression levels contributes to tumor progression and that one of its underlying mechanisms involves inhibition of PMEPA1 expression.

This article aimed to discuss the efficacy and safety of KALT compared with other treatments. The medical records of 5 patients who had undergone KALT were retrospectively studied, together with a literature review of studies. Three of them developed chronic renal failure after liver transplantation because of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-induced nephrotoxicity, while the others had lupus nephritis or non-CNI drug-induced nephrotoxicity. No mortality was observed in the 5 patients. Three KALT cases showed good prognoses, maintaining a normal serum creatinine level during entire follow-up period. Chronic rejection occurred in the other two patients, and a kidney graft was removed from one of them. Our data suggested that KALT is a good alternative to dialysis for liver transplantation recipients. The cases also indicate that KALT can be performed with good long-term survival.",

        "abstract": " To investigate effects of early HIV infection and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) on intrinsic brain activity by using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) analysis.  Forty-nine HIV patients, including 26 with cART (HIV+/cART+) and 23 treatment-na\u00efve (HIV+/cART-), and 25 matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging examination. ALFF values were compared by using one-way ANOVA tests with Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI)'s 3dClustSim correction (voxel <0.005, \u03b1<0.05). In addition, the ALFF values of brain regions that showed significant differences among the three groups were correlated with clinical and neuropsychological variables in both groups of patients by using Spearman correlation analysis.  ANOVA analysis showed that statistic difference of ALFF values among three groups was located in the occipital cortex. Post hoc analysis showed a decrease in occipital ALFF value in HIV patients compared to HC, but showed no difference of occipital ALFF between HIV+/cART+ and HIV+/cART-. Additionally, compared with HC, HIV+/cART+ exhibited higher ALFF in the right caudate and frontoparietal cortex, and HIV+/cART- showed higher ALFF in the bilateral caudate. HIV+/cART+ demonstrated higher ALFF values in auditory cortex than HIV+/cART-. Moreover, ALFF values in the right occipital cortex were positively associated with CD4/CD8 ratio and executive function in HIV+/cART-.  Early HIV-infected individuals presented reduced spontaneous brain activity in the occipital cortex. cART appeared to be ineffective in halting the HIV-induced neurodegeneration but might delay the progression of neural dysfunction to some extent. ALFF might be a potential biomarker in monitoring the effects of HIV and cART on brain function.",

We sought to define the characteristics of interleukin (IL)-33-induced neutrophils and the involvement of this subset of polarized neutrophils in allergic pathogenesis. Freshly isolated neutrophils were treated with different cytokines and the cytokine expression levels were detected by real-time PCR. The gene expression profile of IL-33-induced neutrophils was determined by microarray assay. Adoptive transfer assay was used to investigate the function of IL-33-induced neutrophils in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic asthma model. IL-33-treated neutrophils selectively produced IL-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13 (referred as to N(IL-33) cells) and displayed a distinctive gene expression profile in sharp contrast to resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated neutrophils. IL-33-induced neutrophils expressed high Levels of IL-1R2 on cell surface, whereas resting and LPS-treated neutrophils did not, indicating IL-1R2 might be used as a biomarker for N(IL-33) cells. Importantly, N(IL-33) neutrophils exist in the lungs of OVA-induced allergic asthma mice. Adoptive transfer of N(IL-33) neutrophils significantly promotes the severity of the lung pathogenesis in this model. IL-33 induces neutrophil polarization through c-Jun N-terminal kinase- and nuclear factor-\u03baB-dependent pathways. A previously unappreciated neutrophil polarization driven by IL-33 with unique cell surface markers and cytokine/chemokine-producing gene profile was defined. The newly identified N(IL-33) subpopulation may have significant contribution to IL-33-related pathogenesis.Cellular and Molecular Immunology advance online publication, 5 March 2018; doi:10.1038/cmi.2017.163.",

It is clear that, in addition to be an MHC class II chaperone, CD74 has a diversity of biological functions in physiological and pathological situations. CD74 also participates in other non-MHC II protein trafficking, such as angiotensin II type I receptor. In addition, CD74 is a cell membrane high-affinity receptor for macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), D-dopachrome tautomerase (D-DT/MIF-2) and bacterial proteins. CD74 also regulates T-cell and B-cell developments, dendritic cell (DC) motility, macrophage inflammation, and thymic selection. The activation of receptor complex CD74/CD44 may lead to multiple intracellular signal pathways, such as the activation of the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and 2, the PI3K-Akt signal transduction cascade, NF\u03baB, and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. CD74 plays important roles in many inflammatory diseases, such as liver fibrosis, type I diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Alzheimer disease. In this study, we will focus on the immunological functions of CD74 molecules and its roles in immune-relevant disorders.",

        "abstract": "Polymorphonuclear neutrophils are among the first defense against infection and closely involved in the initiation of inflammatory response. It is well recognized that this function of neutrophils was mainly mediated by phagocytosis, intracellular degradation, releasing of granules, and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps after sensing dangerous stress. However, accumulating data showed that neutrophils had a variety of important biological functions in both innate and adaptive immunities, far beyond cytotoxicity against pathogens. Neutrophils can differentially switch phenotypes and display distinct subpopulations under different microenvironments. Neutrophils can produce a large variety of cytokines and chemokines upon stimulation. Furthermore, neutrophils directly interact with dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, natural killer cells, T cells, and B cells so as to either potentiate or down-modulate both innate and adaptive immunity. In the present review, we summarize the recent progress on the functional plasticity and the regulatory ability on immunity of neutrophils in physiological and pathological situations.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of dynamic renal R /R '/R * measurements based on a method, denoted psMASE-ME, in which a periodic 180\u00b0 pulse-shifting multi-echo asymmetric spin echo (psMASE) sequence, combined with a moving estimation (ME) strategy, is adopted. Following approval by the institutional animal care and use committee, a block design of respiratory challenge with interleaved air and carbogen (97% O , 3% CO ) breathing was employed in nine rabbits. Parametrical R /R '/R * maps were computed and average R /R '/R * values were measured in regions of interest in the renal medulla and cortex. Bland-Altman plots showed good agreement between the proposed method and reference standards of multi-echo spin echo and multi-echo gradient echo sequences. Renal R , R ' and R * decreased significantly from 16.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.4\u00a0s , 9.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2\u00a0s and 25.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.0\u00a0s to 14.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.4\u00a0s (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), 8.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.1\u00a0s (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and 23.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.8\u00a0s (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the cortex when switching the gas mixture from room air to carbogen. In the renal medulla, R , R ' and R * also decreased significantly from 12.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7\u00a0s , 15.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.8\u00a0s and 27.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.3\u00a0s to 11.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5\u00a0s (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), 14.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.2\u00a0s (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and 25.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.1\u00a0s (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

        "abstract": " To investigate whether prebiopsy multi-parametric (mp) MRI can help to improve predictive performance in prostate cancer. Based on a support vector machine (SVM) analysis, we prospectively modeled clinical data (age, PSA, digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasound, PSA density, and prostate volume) and mp-MRI findings [Prostate Imaging and Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score and tumor-node-metastasis stage] in 985 men to predict the risk of prostate cancer. The new nomogram was validated in 493 patients treated at the same institution. Multivariable Cox regression analyses assessed the association between input variables and risk of prostate cancer, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) analyzed the predictive ability. At 5-year follow-up period, 34.3% of patients had systemic progression of prostate cancer. Nomogram (SVM-MRI) predicting 5-year prostate cancer rate trained with clinical and mp-MRI data was accurate and discriminating with an externally validated Az of 0.938, positive predictive value (PPV) of 77.4%, and negative predictive value of 91.5%. The improvement was significant ( < 0.001) compared with the nomogram trained with clinical data. When stratified by PSA, SVM-MRI nomogram had high PPV (93.6%) in patients with PSA > 20 ng/mL, with intermediate to low PPV in PSA 10 to 20 ng/mL (64%), PSA 4 to 10 ng/mL (55.8%), and PSA 0 to 4 ng/mL (29%). PI-RADS score (Cox HR, 2.112;  < 0.001), PSA level (HR, 1.435;  < 0.001), and age (HR, 1.012;  = 0.043) were independent predictors of prostate cancer. Featured with low false positive rate, mp-MRI could be the first investigation of a man with a raised PSA before prostate biopsy. .",

        "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in various clinical settings. In recent years, AKI diagnostics have been investigated intensively showing the emerging need for early characterization of this disease. To verify whether targeted field-of-view diffusion-weighted imaging (tFOV-DWI) is feasible to significantly improve the performance of traditional full field-of-view diffusion-weighted imaging (fFOV-DWI) in the early assessment of AKI. 14 rabbits with unilateral AKI were induced by injection of microspheres under the guidance of digital subtraction angiography (DSA). All rabbits underwent tFOV-DWI and fFOV-DWI immediately after the surgery. Artifacts, distortion and lesion identification were graded by two experienced radiologists, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were measured. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were then derived. Blood samples were collected pre- and post-surgery and serum creatinine weres measured. Renal specimen and biopsy were performed as the reference standard. Student t-test was used to ascertain statistical significance between the above parameters for tFOV-DWI and fFOV-DWI. The interobserver agreement and ADC measurements agreement were assessed. A higher percentage of renal lesions (17 out of 19) were detected in tFOV-DWI compared with fFOV-DWI (14 out of 19). Significant differences were observed in ADC value for both techniques between the lesion regions and normal tissues (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Histological findings were inversely correlated with ADC values of tFOV-DWI (r\u202f=\u202f-0.97, P\u202f<\u202f0.001 for cortex; r\u202f=\u202f-0.98, P\u202f<\u202f0.001 for medulla) and fFOV-DWI sequences (r\u202f=\u202f-0.95, P\u202f<\u202f0.001 for cortex; r\u202f=\u202f-0.98, P\u202f<\u202f0.001 for medulla). Those tFOV-DW images rated by the radiologists exhibit superior performance in terms of all assessed measures (P\u202f<\u202f0.05), and interobserver agreement was excellent (ICC, 0.78 to 0.92). Besides, the ADC values derived from tFOV-DWI had a satisfactory agreement with those estimated by fFOV-DWI. The animal study demonstrates that the tFOV-DWI strategy provided visually better image quality and lesion depiction than conventional fFOV-DWI for early assessment of AKI.",

In this study, 13 quantitative image features were extracted from DWI by CAD, and diagnostic efficacy was analyzed in both the PZ and transition zone (TZ). The results demonstrated that there was a significant difference (P&lt;0.05) between PCa and non-PCa for nine of the 13 features in the PZ and five of the 13 features in the TZ. Besides, the prediction outcome of CAD had a strong correlation with the DWI scores that were graded by experienced radiologists according to the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System Version 2 (PI-RADS v2).",

        "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents with both significantly enhanced relaxivity and minimal safety risk are of great importance for sensitive clinical diagnosis, but have rarely been reported. Herein, we present a simple strategy to improve relaxivity by introducing surface ligands with strong interaction to water molecules. As a proof of concept, NaGdF4 nanoparticles (NPs) capped by poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) show superior relaxivity to those capped by polyethylenimine and polyethylene glycol, which is attributed to the strong hydrogen-bond capacity of PAA to water molecules as revealed by theoretical calculation. Furthermore, benefiting from PAA and ultrasmall particle size, Gd-dots, namely PAA-capped GdOF NPs (2.1 \u00b1 0.2 nm), are developed as a high-performance contrast agent, with a remarkable ionic relaxivity of \u223c75 mM\u20131 s\u20131 in albumin solution at 0.5 T. These Gd-dots also exhibit efficient renal clearance with u003c3% of injected amount left 12 h post-injection. Ultrasensitive MR renography achieved...",

We conducted a prospective, single-armed, open label phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel (T)/cisplatin (C)/ Nimotuzumab (N) as first-line treatment in advanced ESCC. Methods: Patients with pathologic confirmed unresectable local-regional advanced or metastatic ESCC were treated with the TPN regimen: Nimotuzumab 200mg weekly, Paclitaxel 175mg/m2 on d1, and Cisplatin 30mg/m2 on day1 and 2, repeat cycle every 3 weeks for six cycles. Local-regional advanced disease was defined as tumor lesion limited in 1 radiation field without organ metastasis. Metastatic disease was defined as organ (liver, lung et al) metastasis or lymph nodes metastasis exceeding 1 radiation field. Radiotherapy was allowed to be admitted after 4 cycle of TPN treatment.The primary endpoint is the objective response rate (ORR) and the safety. The secondary endpoint is the progression free survival (PFS) and the overall survival (OS)...",

Large tumor suppressor expression (LATS1) was overexpression and yes association protein 1(YAP1) translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in HCC cells treated with TGF-\u03b21.

However, whether or not HOTAIR influences glucose metabolism and the specific underlying mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells remain unclear. In the present study, we found markedly increased HOTAIR expression in 84\u00a0HCC tissues and demonstrated that HOTAIR overexpression promoted cell proliferation using Cell Counting Kit-8. The effect on glucose metabolism regulated by HOTAIR in HCC cells was determined by detecting lactate and glucose levels: HOTAIR promoted glycolysis by upregulating glucose transporter isoform\u00a01 (GLUT1) and activating mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, whereas knockdown of HOTAIR suppressed this effect. Our research reveals a novel relationship between HOTAIR and glucose metabolism in HCC cells, and it may be a therapeutic target for diagnosing and treating HCC.",

To testify the function of this GOA circuit, the circuit was placed in a AMOLED display. It is turned out that the proposed GOA circuit exhibited stable output signals with pulse width from 60\u03bcs to 3.6ms. It is obviously that the pulse width of 3.6ms could meet the requirement of switching signals in external compensation pixel circuits. Moreover, the bottom gates bias of TFTs in GOA circuit could be adjustable by a external voltage source. Using a positive or negative bottom gate bias, the Vth of TFTs can be controllable to achieve a good output signal for GOA.",

A mediated substrate bias is benefit to the improvement of a-IGZO film. The BCE a-IGZO TFT with mediate substrate bias of -90 V exhibits good performances with a field effect mobility (\u03bcfe) of 7.45 cm2/V\u00b7s, a subthreshold swing (SS) of 0.52 V/Dec and an Ion/Ioffcurrent ratio of 109. The gate-bias stress stability is improved by substrate bias with _Vthwas 1.76 V under PBS and -0.88 V under NBS. \u00a9 2016 FTFMD.",

        "abstract": "NdFeB/\u03b1-Fe nanocomposite magnets are prepared through electron beam exposure with a greatly reduced annealing time of 0.1 s. This is by far the most effective approach due to the effect of an extremely high heating rate featuring a rapid thermal process. The impact that the rapid thermal process has on crystallization is expounded by the introduction of the Landau model and Langevin dynamical simulations. The change of crystallization sequence from the \u03b1-Fe phase preceding the NdFeB phase under conventional annealing conditions, to synergetic crystallization under electron beam conditions is investigated. Synergetic crystallization results in more intense interaction between the \u03b1-Fe phase and the NdFeB phase in order to refine the microstructure as the fraction of Fe increases within our addition range. Improved uniformity, and shifts in the microstructure and distribution of the \u03b1-Fe phase contribute to the improvement of the magnetic properties. Compared with conventional furnace annealing ones, the magnetic properties of samples under electron beam exposure conditions are improved. For the NdFeBNbGa alloy, coercivity is enhanced from 4.56 kOe to 6.73 kOe, remanence ratio increases from 0.75 to 0.79, and a superior squareness of the hysteresis loop is achieved.",

        "abstract": "Recently low-dimensional materials hold great potential in the field of photocatalysis, whereas the concomitantly promoted many-body effects have long been ignored. Such Coulomb interaction-mediated effects would lead to some intriguing, nontrivial band structures, thus promising versatile photocatalytic performances and optimized strategies. Here, we demonstrate that ultrathin black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets exhibit an exotic, excitation-energy-dependent, optical switching effect in photocatalytic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. It is, for the first time, observed that singlet oxygen (1O2) and hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH) are the dominant ROS products under visible- and ultraviolet-light excitations, respectively. Such an effect can be understood as a result of subband structure, where energy-transfer and charge-transfer processes are feasible under excitations in the first and second subband systems, respectively. This work not only establishes an in-depth understanding on the influence of many-body effects on photocatalysis, but also paves the way for optimizing catalytic performances via controllable photoexcitation.",

However, the ways for regulation of spin states of catalysts are still limited, and the underlying relationship between the spin states and catalytic activities remains unclear. Herein, for the first time, by taking Ni -based compounds without high or low spin states for example, it is shown that their spin states can be delocalized after introducing structural distortion to the atomic layers. The delocalized spin states for Ni atoms can provide not only high electrical conductivity but also low adsorption energy between the active sites and reaction intermediates for the system. As expected, the ultrathin nanosheets of nickel-chalcogenides with structural distortions show dramatically enhanced activity in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution compared to their corresponding bulk samples. This work establishes new way for the design of advanced electrocatalysts in transition-metal-based compounds via regulation of spin states.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP) has drawn tremendous attention in solar-light-driven catalytic processes for its intriguing chemical and physical properties. Benefiting from the highly anisotropic electronic structure induced by its puckered crystal geometry, 2D BP tends to have greater confinement with respect to traditional inorganic nanomaterials, thereby leading to robust many-body effects. Such Coulomb-interaction-mediated effects dominate the electronic and optical properties of 2D BP-based nanosystems, where exotic correlations between photoinduced species give rise to unique photoexcitation processes that are closely associated with the involved photocatalytic behavior. In this Perspective, we highlight the critical role of many-body effects in 2D BP-based photocatalysis and exemplify the relationships between the correlated photoinduced species-dominated photoexcitation processes and photocatalytic behavior involved therein. The relevant challenges and opportunities in pursuing efficient 2D BP-based solar energy utilization are also discussed.",

However, the photosensitizers for the generation of singlet oxygen bear in low quantum yields, lack of long wavelength absorption band, poor biocompatibility, undegradable in living tissues, and so on. Here we first demonstrate the exfoliated black phosphorus nanosheets to be effective photosensitizers for the generation of singlet oxygen with a high quantum yield of about 0.91, rendering their attractive applications in catalysis and photodynamic therapy. Through in vitro and in vivo studies, the water dispersible black phosphorus nanosheets show notable cancer therapy ability. In addition, the photodegradable character of black phosphorus from element to biocompatible phosphorus oxides further highlights its therapeutic potential against cancer. This study will not only expand the breadth of study in black phosphorus but also offer an efficient catalyst and photodynamic therapy agent. ",

Nevertheless, traditional viewpoints focus on photogenerated free charge carriers, which are somehow invalid once the many-body effects are taken into account, especially for polymeric photocatalysts. Here we systematically investigate the photoexcitation processes involved in the polymer matrix of graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) by combining photoluminescence spectroscopy and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, validating the strong excitonic effects in the well-known photocatalyst for the first time. The identification of the robust triplet-triplet annihilation process, in which two triplet excitons collide to produce a singlet exciton, highlights an important nonradiative depopulation pathway of excited species and thereby offers potential strategies to regulate the photocatalytic activities of polymeric g-CN. The work establishes a new understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism in the polymeric g-CN matrix, and thus paves the way for designing effective polymeric photocatalysts through excitonic engineering.",

        "abstract": "Excitonic effects, arising from the Coulomb interactions between photogenerated electrons and holes, dominate the optical excitation properties of semiconductors, whereas their influences on photocatalytic processes have seldom been discussed. In view of the competitive generation of excitons and hot carriers, exciton dissociation is proposed as an alternative strategy for hot-carrier harvesting in photocatalysts. Herein, by taking heptazine-based melon as an example, we verified that enhanced hot-carrier generation could be obtained in semicrystalline polymeric photocatalysts, which is ascribed to the accelerated exciton dissociation at the abundant order\u2212disorder interfaces. Moreover, driven by the accompanying electron injection toward ordered chains and hole blocking in disordered chains, semicrystalline heptazine-based melon showed an \u223c7-fold promotion in electron concentration with respect to its pristine counterpart. Benefiting from these, the semicrystalline sample exhibited dramatic enhancements ...",

Once these interactions are considered, excitonic effects will arise that undoubtedly influence the sunlight-driven catalytic processes. Herein, by taking bismuth oxyhalide as examples, we proposed that giant electron\u2013hole interactions would be expected in confined layered structures, and excitons would be the dominating photoexcited species. Photocatalytic molecular oxygen activation tests were performed as a proof of concept, where singlet oxygen generation via energy transfer process was brightened. Further experiments verify that structural confinement is curial to the giant excitonic effects, where the involved catalytic process could be readily regulated via facet-engineering, thus enabling diverse reactive oxygen species generation. This study not only provides an excitonic prospective on photoca...",

The unique single-crystalline belt-on-sheet hierarchical nanostructure is identified, which endows more reactive edges for the Ni2+-to-Ni3+ pre-oxidation process to boost the generation of active high-valence species for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and benefited from the optimal Fe concentration, the UOR activity is further optimized owing to the favorable reaction kinetics. With the synergistic merits of the increased surface areas, improved charge transfer behavior, favorable reaction kinetics as well as the excellent structural stability, the iron-incorporated \u03b1-Ni(OH)2 hierarchical nanosheet array catalyst displays significantly improved UOR performance with both high activity and outstanding operational stability.

In this study, defect-engineered MoS2 nanowall (NW) catalysts with controllable thickness were fabricated and exhibited a significantly enhanced HER performance. Benefiting from the highly exposed active edge sites and the rough surface accompanied by the robust NW structure, the defect-rich MoS2 NW catalyst with an optimized thickness showed an ultralow onset overpotential of 85 mV, a high current density of 310.6 mA\u00b7cm\u22122 at \u03b7 = 300 mV, and a low potential of 95 mV to drive a 10 mA\u00b7cm\u22122 cathodic current. Additionally, excellent electrochemical stability was realized, making this freestanding NW catalyst a promising candidate for practical water splitting and hydrogen production.",

Detailed analyses revealed that the NiFe LDH phase around the nanopores can be preferentially oxidized into electroactive Fe:NiOOH phase. In addition, the buffering space provided by the nanopores can effectively avoid structural deformation during repeated redox cycling, leading to better electrochemical stability, which synergistically make the catalyst a promising candidate for commercial water splitting.

        "abstract": "Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has drawn substantial attention owing to its crucial role in clean energy production via water electrolysis. Developing highly efficient and electrochemically stable HER catalysts that can work under a wide range of pH values is of great importance. Herein, uniformly distributed platinum nanocrystals were decorated on defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets (DR-MoS2) via an in situ electrochemical dissolution-redeposition approach. With the merits of the defect-rich feature combined with the large surface area of the DR-MoS2, abundant reactive sites can be provided for adsorbing and anchoring the Pt atoms, leading to the formation of the DR-MoS2 catalyst with homogeneous decorated Pt nanocrystals. Benefitting from the synergistic effect between the DR-MoS2 and the Pt nanocrystals, the DR-MoS2-Pt composite catalyst shows remarkable HER performance in acidic and alkaline conditions, even taking precedence over the benchmarking Pt/C catalyst.",

Herein, magnetic \u03b3-FeO nanoparticles decoration onto porous layered double oxides belts (\u03b3-FeO/LDO) were fabricated by in situ solid-state thermolysis technique combined with Fe(III)-loaded layered double hydroxides as a precursor. The microstructure, chemical composition, and magnetic properties of \u03b3-FeO/LDO were characterized in detail. The as-obtained \u03b3-FeO/LDO was employed as an adsorbent for the elimination of U(VI) from water. The adsorption process followed the Langmuir model with the maximal adsorption capacity of U(VI) onto \u03b3-FeO/LDO being 526.32\u202fmg\u00b7g at 303\u202fK and pH 5, which surpassed pristine LDO and many other materials. The Fourier transformed infrared spectra and the X-ray photoelectron spectra analysis suggested that the interaction mechanism was mainly controlled by the surface complexation and electrostatic interactions. All in all, the \u03b3-FeO/LDO with remarkable adsorption capacity, excellent regeneration, and easy magnetic separation opens a new expectation as a suitable material for the cleanup of U(VI) from contaminated water.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Recently, nitrogen-doped carbon encapsulating with transition metal hybrids has attracted extensive interests in catalysis because of its unique microstructure and promising properties. In this work, three dimensional  N -doped graphene-CNT frameworks with well encapsulated ultrafine Ni nanoparticles (Ni@N-CNTs/N-G) were developed by a facile two-stage encapsulation strategy by combining Ni-MOFs with melamine as the precursor. In terms of Cr(VI) reduction by using formic acid (HCOOH) as the reductant,  N -CNTs/N-G matrix not only protected the encapsulated Ni nanoparticles from poisoning or leaching in strong acid media, but also provided enhanced active sites for Cr(VI) by its rich mesopores and high N content. Among all the products obtained after thermal treatments at different temperatures, Ni@N-CNTs/N-G-800 (pyrolyzed at 800\u202f\u00b0C) exhibited superb reduction performance with the efficiency of approximately 99.6%, ascribing to the synergistic effects including the porous 3D framework with large specific surface area, high  N -doping level, and large amount of ultrafine Ni nanoparticles. More importantly, its catalytic activity and microstructure rarely changed after 10 times of recycling, suggesting that Ni@N-CNTs/N-G-800 processes excellent stability. This study provides a new strategy of synthesizing transition metal-based catalyst, which can broaden the applicability of MOF materials for heavy metal pollution cleanup.",

In order to identify this knowledge gap, the physicochemical properties of UV/VL-transformed GO are investigated in detail. Attempts are made to correlate the physicochemical alterations of UV/VL-transformed GO to the observed changes in its colloidal properties and toxicity. The results show that both UV and VL irradiations induce the significant change in the color, UV-vis absorbance, morphology, surface charge, size, oxygen containing functional groups, total of carbon, and photoluminescence properties of GO. The photo-reaction behavior of GO under UV exposure is different from that under VL irradiation in terms of reaction rate, order, and extent. Finally, the UV and VL irradiations show different effects not only on the colloidal stability of GO in the City water and Dongpu Lake water, but also on the toxicity of GO to Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. This study clearly shows how the environmental fate and risk of GO are modified by UV and VL irradiations.",

To assess the environmental behavior of CDs, the interaction between CDs and goethite was studied under different environmental conditions. Electrokinetic characterization of CDs suggested that the \u03b6-potential and size distribution of CDs were affected by pH and electrolyte species, indicating that these factors influenced the stability of CDs in aqueous solutions. Traditional Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory did not fit well the aggregation process of CDs. Results of the effects of pH and ionic strength suggested that electronic attraction dominated the aggregation of CDs. Compared with other minerals, hydrogen-bonding interactions and Lewis acid-base interactions contributed to the aggregation of CDs, in addition to van der Waals and electrical double-layer forces. Adsorption isotherms and microscopic Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy indicated that chemical bonds were formed between CDs and goethite. These findings are useful to understand the interaction of CDs with minerals, as well as the potential fate and toxicity of CDs in the natural environment, especially in soils and sediments.",

To describe the arbitration behavior in the agent-based simulation, an arbitration agent was introduced and modeled. Some arbitration strategies were constructed according to the task utility and resource matching degree. Then, the agent and it's strategies were integrated into the agent-based simulation platform.

In this paper, behaviors of individuals in MCPD, especially collaborative behaviors, are modeled and simulated, and the effects of collaborative behaviors on the whole MCPD process are identified based on the simulation study. Firstly, a multi-agent process model of MCPD is built, which includes product model, community model, and three-level agent model. Secondly, collaboration behaviors including collaboration request, collaborator choosing, collaboration judgment, and collaboration response are depicted. Finally, based on the process model and the individual behaviors of MCPD, a simulation system for MPCD is designed and developed, and two sets of experiments are carried out. The results of experiments show that different weights of collaborator choosing indices significantly influence OSC evolution, and individuals' collaboration intensions significantly influence product evolution. The findings of this paper are expected to help the community managers develop more reasonable management and service mechanisms for participants of the MCPD.",

        "abstract": "Collaborative Product Development CPD process is characterized by autonomous task control, dynamic task sequence, and frequent team collaboration, which endow the process with high flexibility and uncertainty. To make the process predictable and improve process efficiency, it is essential to model, simulate, and analyze the process by considering all these characteristics. As most CPD models are developed to simulate task structures and task-flow process, our work focuses on studying the human working behaviors in CPD process by agent-based simulation, which we think is the main source of process uncertainty and flexibility. In this paper, the local task scheduling behavior of designer agents and the resource conflict resolution behavior of the manager agent are studied under the framework of agent-based simulation. In the simulation, the designer agent schedules his local tasks according to his personal priority, and the manager agent resolves resource conflicts according to collective utility function. To make the process more efficient, a collective utility function is developed for the manager agent, in which task priority, spare resource, and waiting time are considered simultaneously. To validate the effectiveness of the collective utility, simulation experiments are designed and carried out among entire-waiting utility, entire-replacement utility, and collective utility strategy. The simulation results indicate that the proposed utility strategy can effectively shorten the project total time and cost of the case. There are two engineering applications of this approach. First, by simulating and evaluating different task scheduling and resource conflict resolution behaviors of the agents, designers and managers can adopt suitable scheduling strategies at the planning stage of the CPD project. Second, in the executing process of the CPD project, the proposed scheduling priority and utility functions can be used in the dynamic scheduling by developing software agents in the CPD management systems.",

To validate and evaluate the scheduling behaviour based on utility functions in agent-based simulation, comparative simulation experiments are carried out on the basis of a case study in the Chinese industry. Simulation results show that the agent's behaviour in the development process simulation is close to the real working process of designers. In the comparative case study, the scheduling behaviour considering both task urgency and task importance can significantly shorten project lead time compared with considering task urgency only. It can also save time for the whole project if the agent assigns collaborative tasks high priority. The developed model and simulation approach can help organisations to identify efficient and effective scheduling behaviours in collaborative and complex product development processes.",

It is a challenging work to segment infarct at hyper-acute stage due to the substantial variability. A general abnormal tissue segmentation method is proposed and applied to segment hyper-acute ischemic infarct in this paper. Multiple features are designed to train a random forest classifier for voxel classification. Sparse coding based bag-of-features is adopted to train a region classifier for infarct region recognition. The proposed method has been validated on 98 consecutive patients recruited within 6 hours from onset and achieved a higher Dice coefficient 0.774\u00b10.117 than the other two existing methods (0.755\u00b10.118; 0.597\u00b10.204).

        "abstract": "Studying tumor growth using mathematical models from magnetic resonance (MR) images is an important application that is believed to play a major role in cancer treatment by predicting tumor evolution, quantifying the response to therapy, and treatment planning. Reaction diffusion is the most popular model because of its simplicity and consistency with the biological growth process. However, most of the current growth models focus on presurgical images and likely without treatment. In this paper, we propose a new reaction diffusion model to consider the chemotherapy and radiotherapy effects on the tumor growth modelling for patients with low grade glioma. The proposed model does not consider the tensor information from diffusion tensor imaging. Instead it uses a weighted parameter to promote higher diffusivity in white matter. The radiotherapy and chemotherapy effects are considered as a loss terms in the proposed model. The preliminary results of the proposed model on synthetic and 2 real MR images show that, our model can effectively simulate tumor growth with high accuracies when treatments are administrated to low grade glioma patients.",

        "abstract": "Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD), the mechanism underlying the therapeutic efficacy and side effects of ECT remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated alterations in the cortical morphological measurements including cortical thickness (CT), surface area (SA), and local gyrification index (LGI) in 23 MDD patients before and after ECT. Furthermore, multivariate pattern analysis using linear support vector machine (SVM) was applied to investigate whether the changed morphological measurements can be effective indicators for therapeutic efficacy of ECT. Surface-based morphometry (SBM) analysis found significantly increased vertex-wise and regional cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) in widespread regions, mainly located in the left insula (INS) and left fusiform gyrus, as well as hypergyrification in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) in MDD patients after ECT. Partial correlational analyses identified associations between the morphological properties and depressive symptom scores and impaired memory scores. Moreover, SVM result showed that the changed morphological measurements were effective to classify the MDD patients before and after ECT. Our findings suggested that ECT may enhance cortical neuroplasticity to facilitate neurogenesis to remit depressive symptoms and to impair delayed memory. These findings indicated that the cortical morphometry is a good index for therapeutic efficacy of ECT.",

        "abstract": "Satellite passive microwave (MW) remote sensing has a better ability to observe land surface temperature (LST) in cloudy conditions than thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing. Due to the much greater thermal sampling depth (TSD) of MW, currently available MW LST do not represent the thermodynamic temperature of the land surface and, therefore, yield systematic differences from TIR LST. The TSD effect is particularly prominent over barren land and sparsely vegetated surfaces. Here, we present a novel TSD correction (TSDC) method to estimate the MW LST over barren land. The core of this method is a new formulation of the passive MW radiation balance equation, which allows linking MW effective physical temperature to the soil temperature at a specific depth. The TSDC method is applied to the 6.9-GHz channel of AMSR-E in northwestern China-western Mongolia and western Namibia (WN). Evaluation shows that LST estimated by the TSDC method agrees well with the MODIS LST. Validation based on  in situ  LSTs measured at the Gobabeb site in WN demonstrates the high accuracy of the TSDC method: it yields a root mean squared error of about 2\u20133 K and slight systematic error. In contrast, other methods without TSDC yield lower accuracies and significantly underestimate LST. Therefore, the TSDC method has the potential to generate MW LST with the same physical meaning and similar accuracy as TIR LST. This study provides implications for developing practical and accurate methods to estimate MW LST over other land surface types and at the global scale.",

Compared to satellite thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing, passive microwave (PMW) remote sensing has ability to overcome the influence of atmosphere and thus has potential to estimate LST under cloudy conditions. However, the coarse spatial resolution significantly limits the application of PMW remote sensing in LST estimation. In this study, a simple multiple regression approach is proposed to downscale the LST from AMSR2 (10 km) to MODIS (1 km) scale in a different way from current downscaling methods. The method is applied to northeast China and the results shows an accuracy of 2\u20133 K for this method. This study is meaningful for generation of all-weather LST with high spatial resolution from PMW observations at regional and global scales.",

Compared to the thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing, passive microwave (MW) remote sensing can better overcome the atmospheric influences and has advantages in LST estimation. However, there are still many problems in estimating LST by MW: traditional empirical methods mainly rely on the statistic relation; therefore, their accuracies are generally limited; physical methods are not suitable for wide applications because they need to be constructed based on complicated surface cases. Based on the optimal time-window fitting the MW radiation transfer (RT) equation, this paper facilitates the semi-empirical method to estimate LST over the Chinese landmass from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) data. The results show that the method has higher accuracy than the traditional semi-empirical method.

        "title": "Downscaling of surface air temperature over the Tibetan Plateau based on DEM.",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Surface air temperature ( T  a ) is critical to the studies of radiation balance, energy budget, and water cycle. It is a necessary input for associated models. Most of the current  T  a  datasets of reanalysis products have limitations at local scales due to their coarse spatial resolutions. For better modeling the radiation balance, energy budget, and water cycle over the Tibetan Plateau, this study proposes a practical method for  T  a  downscaling based on the digital elevation model. This method is applied to downscale  T  a  of the China regional surface meteorological feature dataset (CRSMFD) at 0.1\u00b0 and the ERA-interim (ERAI) product at 0.125\u00b0 to 0.01\u00b0. The daily mean  T  a  and the 3-hourly instantaneous  T  a  with a 0.01\u00b0 are obtained. The downscaled  T  a  are evaluated from the perspectives of accuracy and image quality. Results show that the daily mean  T  a  downscaled from the CRSMFD product has a RMSE of 1.13\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0\u202fK at 105 meteorological stations and RMSEs of 0.96\u202fK to 2.34\u202fK at three experimental stations; the instantaneous  T  a  downscaled from CRSMFD has RMSEs of 1.02\u202fK to 4.0\u202fK at the three experimental stations.  T  a  after downscaling has better agreement with the ground measured  T  a  than before downscaling, especially in mountain areas. By contrast,  T  a  downscaled from the ERAI product has unacceptable accuracy due to the great uncertainty of the ERAI  T  a  over the Tibetan Plateau. With the proposed method, a 0.01\u00b0  T  a  dataset from 2000 to 2015 over the Tibetan Plateau was generated to satisfy related studies and applications.",

The accuracy of satellite LST products directly affect its application; therefore, it is necessary to evaluate LST products. In this study, two satellite remotely sensed LST products, i.e. AMSR2 LST and MODIS LST, were evaluated against the in-situ LSTs at 17 ground sites in Heihe River Basin in 2014. Results show that both AMSR2 and MODIS LSTs have good correlations with the in-situ LST, with R2 from 0.80 to 0.98 except at AR2 site at daytime. However, both of these two products have large systematic errors compared with the in-situ LST. The possible main reason is the scale mismatch between the FOV of the longwave radiometer and the AMSR2 and MODIS pixels.",

Merging thermal infrared (TIR) and passive microwave (MW) remote sensing provides the possibility to obtain all-weather LST with moderate resolutions. However, due to difficulties in downscaling MW LST, current methods merging TIR LST and MW LST into such an all-weather LST are limited over large areas with very complicated land surfaces (e.g. the Tibetan Plateau). By fully considering the influence of the topography on estimation of merged LSTs, this study revises the recently-developed physical method for generating the 1-km all-weather LST and applies it over the Tibetan Plateau to merge MODIS (1 km) and AMSR2 (10 km) observations. Results show that the merged LST has accuracy of 0.99 K-3.22 K when validated against insitu LSTs from five ground stations with various land cover types. This study would be beneficial for continuously monitoring LST and improving spatio-temporal resolutions for associated land surface process studies requiring high-quality all-weather LST over large scales.",

It is the basic driving force of surface biological and chemical processes and the fundamental source of human energy. Photosynthesis of plants and surface drought are directly related to the DSR. In this study, based on the in-situ measured DSR in agricultural regions of China, two DSR products, i.e. the high-resolution surface solar radiation datasets over China (HRSSR) and the DSR product from China land surface data assimilation system (CLDAS), were validated. If the in-situ DSR is seriously contaminated by clouds, it will bring great uncertainties to the evaluation. In order to take the effect of cloud into account, a method for cloud screening was proposed and used in the study. Before removing the in-situ DSR which is influenced by cloud contamination, the lowest RMSEs are 143 W/m 2  and 145 W/m 2  for HRSSR and CLDAS, respectively; the highest RMSEs are 250 W/m 2  and 201 W/m 2  for HRSSR and CLDAS, respectively. After considering the cloud contamination, the lowest RMSE values decrease to 116 W/m 2  and 94 W/m 2  for HRSSR and CLDAS, respectively; and the highest RMSEs decrease to 198 W/m 2  and 167 W/m 2 . Therefore, it is necessary to take the cloud contamination into account in the evaluation of the DSR product.",

        "abstract": "Land surface temperature (LST) is a key variable at the land-atmosphere boundary. For many research projects and applications an all-weather LST product at moderate spatial resolution (e.g., 1 km) would be highly useful, especially in frequently cloudy areas. Merging thermal infrared (TIR) and microwave (MW) observations is able to overcome shortcomings of single-source remote sensing to derive such an LST. However, in current merging methods, models adopted for downscaling MW LST fail to quantify the effect of temporal variation of LST. Thus, accuracy of the merged LST can be deteriorated and therefore remain a major impediment for these methods to be generalized over large areas. In this context, we propose a new practical method to merge TIR and MW observations from a perspective of decomposition of LST in temporal dimension. The physical basis of the method is decomposing LST into three temporal components: annual temperature cycle component, diurnal temperature cycle component prescribed by solar geometry, and weather temperature component driven by weather change. The method was applied to MODIS and AMSR-E/AMSR2 data to generate an 11-year record of 1-km all-weather LST over Northeast China: the resulting merged LST has an accuracy of 1.29-1.71 K when validated against in situ LST; besides, no obvious differences in accuracy of the merged LST were found between clear-sky and unclear-sky conditions. Furthermore, the proposed method outperforms the previous method in both accuracy and image quality, indicating its good capability to generate daily 1-km all-weather LST, which will benefit continuous monitoring of earthu0027s surface temperature.",

        "abstract": "Atmospheric removal of PM by the Three Northern Regions Shelter Forest (TNRSF) - the so called Green Great Wall (GGW) in northern China through dry deposition process was estimated using a bulk big-leaf model and a vegetation collection model. Decadal trend of PM dry deposition flux from 1999 to 2010 was calculated from modeled dry deposition velocity and air concentration retrieved from the satellite remote sensing. Dry deposition velocities of PM calculated using the two deposition models increased in many places of the TNRSF over the last decade due to increasing vegetation coverage of the TNRSF. Both increasing deposition velocity due to forest expansion and PM atmospheric level contributed to the increasing deposition flux of PM. The highest atmospheric deposition flux of PM was found in the Central-north region covering Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area, followed by the Northwestern and the Northeastern regions of the TNRSF. While greater collection of PM by vegetation was identified in the Northeastern region of the TNRSF due to higher forest coverage over this region, the most significant incline of the PM atmospheric removal due to vegetation collection was discerned in the Central-north region because of the most rapid increase in the vegetation coverage in this region. A total mass of 2.85\u00d710t PM was estimated to be removed from the atmosphere through dry deposition process over the TNRSF from 1999 to 2010. The two deposition models simulated similar magnitude and spatial patterns of PM dry deposition fluxes. Our results suggest that the TNRSF plays a moderate role in PM uptake, but enhances PM atmospheric removal by 30% in 2010 than in 1980.",

Atmospheric removal and long-term trends of two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) species, phenanthrene (PHE) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), resulting from increasing vegetation coverage and soil organic carbon in the TNRSF over the last two decades were examined. Field sampling data and modeling result showed that the total atmospheric removal of PHE by TNRSF increased from 36.4 tons in 1990 to 76.8 tons in 2010, increasing at a rate of 5.6% yr, and BaP from 2.2 to 4.5 tons, increasing at a rate of 5.2% yr. Three model scenarios were designed to distinguish the effects of atmospheric emissions, and with and without TNRSF on the environmental fate of PAHs. Approximately 1-4% of PHE and BaP emitted in northern China were removed by the TNRSF during 1990-2010. Model simulations revealed that the TNRSF enhanced atmospheric removal of PHE by 29% and BaP by 53% compared with the simulation without the TNRSF, manifesting marked contributions of land-use change by the artificial TNRSF, the largest afforestation activity in human history, to the atmospheric removal of organic chemicals.",

        "abstract": "Soybean-induced anaphylaxis poses a severe threat to the health of humans and animals. Some commensal bacteria, such as  and , can prevent and treat allergic diseases. Prebiotic oligosaccharides, a food/diet additive, can enhance health and performance via modulating gut microbes and immune responses. The purpose of this study was to examine whether fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) could alleviate soybean-induced anaphylaxis by modulating gut microbes. Piglets (21 days of age) were sensitized with a diet containing 5% soybean and 30% peeled soybean meal. The treatment with 0.6% FOS started 1 day prior to sensitization and continued everyday thereafter. Blood was collected for measurements of immune indices. The DNA samples isolated from fresh intestinal contents of the middle jejunum (M-jejunum), posterior jejunum (P-jejunum), ileum, and cecum were used for gene sequencing based on 16S rRNA. Our results showed that there was an increase of glycinin-specific IgG, \u03b2-conglycinin-specific IgG, total serum IgG and IgE, and occurrence of diarrhea in piglets sensitized with soybean antigen. There was a decrease in interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-10 and an increase of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) in piglets with FOS treatment, compared with the piglets without FOS treatment. Improvement of intestinal microbes was indicated mostly by the increase of  and  in M-jejunum and the decrease of  in P-jejunum and ileum. The correlation analysis indicated that FOS treatment decreased those closely related to the key species of gut microbes. These results suggest that FOS can alleviate soybean antigen-induced anaphylaxis, which is associated with increased  and  in M-jejunum and declined  in P-jejunum and ileum of piglets.",

        "title": "Three-North Shelter Forest Program contribution to long-term increasing trends of biogenic isoprene emissions in northern China",
        "abstract": "Abstract.  To assess the long-term trends of isoprene emissions in northern China and the impact of the Three-North Shelter Forest Program (TNRSF) on these trends, a database of historical biogenic isoprene emissions from 1982 to 2010 was developed for this region using a biogenic emission model for gases and aerosols. The total amount of the biogenic isoprene emissions during the 3 decades was 4.4  Tg in northern China and 1.6  Tg in the TNRSF, with annual emissions ranging from 132  000 to 176  000  t  yr \u22121  and from 45  000 to 70  000  t  yr \u22121 , respectively, in the two regions. Isoprene emission fluxes have increased substantially in many areas of the TNRSF over the last 3 decades due to the growing trees and vegetation coverage, especially in the central north China region where the highest emission incline reached to 58  % from 1982 to 2010. Biogenic isoprene emissions produced from anthropogenic forests tended to surpass those produced from natural forests, such as boreal forests in northeastern China. The estimated isoprene emissions suggest that the TNRSF has altered the long-term emission trend in north China from a decreasing trend during 1982 to 2010 (slope  \u2009=\u2009  \u22120.533,  R  2 \u2009=\u20090.05) to an increasing trend for the same period of time (slope  \u2009=\u2009  0.347,  R  2 \u2009=\u20090.014), providing strong evidence for the change in the emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) induced by the human activities on decadal or longer timescales.",

This is largely attributed to the rapid development of the energy industry in this region.

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of economy makes China the largest energy consumer and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emitter in the world. In this study, we estimated the trends and step changes in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) vertical column density (VCD) of SO 2  from 2005 to 2015 over China measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). We show that these trends and step change years coincide with the effective date and period of the national strategy for energy development and relocation in northwestern China and the regulations in the reduction of SO 2  emissions. Under the national regulations for the reduction of SO 2  emissions in eastern and southern China, SO 2  VCD in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) of southern China exhibited the largest decline during 2005\u20132015 at a rate of \u22127\u202f%\u202fyr \u22121 , followed by the North China Plain (NCP) (\u22126.7\u202f%\u202fyr \u22121 ), Sichuan Basin (\u22126.3\u202f%\u202fyr \u22121 ), and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) (\u22126\u202f%\u202fyr \u22121 ). The Mann\u2013Kendall (MK) test reveals the step change points of declining SO 2  VCD in 2009 for the PRD and 2012\u20132013 for eastern China responding to the implementation of SO 2  control regulation in these regions. In contrast, the MK test and regression analysis also revealed increasing trends of SO 2  VCD in northwestern China, particularly for several  hot spots  featured by growing SO 2  VCD in those large-scale energy industry bases in northwestern China. The enhanced SO 2  VCD is potentially attributable to increasing SO 2  emissions due to the development of large-scale energy industry bases in energy-abundant northwestern China under the national strategy for the energy safety of China in the 21st century. We show that these large-scale energy industry bases could overwhelm the trends and changes in provincial total SO 2  emissions in northwestern China and contribute increasingly to the national total SO 2  emissions in China. Given that northwestern China is more ecologically fragile and uniquely susceptible to atmospheric pollution than the rest of China, increasing SO 2  emissions in this part of China should not be overlooked and merit scientific research.",

The increasing trend of OMI columnar SO 2  in this area is in contrast to the widespread decreases in SO 2  emissions in eastern and southern China. This is mainly induced by rapid development in the energy industry in this region over the past decade under the national strategy for energy industry expansion and relocation to northwestern China. We observed a significant correlation of OMI columnar SO 2  between this energy industrial base and Urumqi city in winter (R\u00a0=\u00a00.504,  p   2  emitted from heavily contaminated energy industrial base exacerbated the air quality in Urumqi city. The Weather Research and Forecasting Chemistry (WRF-Chem) modeling confirms that the occurrence of heavy smog in this capital city during the wintertime was attributed primarily to strong emissions of air contaminants from the energy industrial base under favorable winds. A numerical case study with and without taking the Midong Industry Base into consideration revealed that this industry base contributed 38% to the SO 2  level in Urumqi city, offsetting the considerable efforts made by the local government to improve air quality in this city.",

        "title": "Economic factors contributing to the outbreaks of indigenous major infectious diseases from domestic animals in China between 2000 and 2016: a multicountry study",
        "abstract": "Abstract  Background  Infectious diseases remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in China. After entering the 21st century, some major outbreaks of infectious diseases in human beings have occurred in China, but little evidence is available on the disease burden because of economic factors. We investigated the burden of infectious diseases on the basis of economic factors in China and made comparisons with data from the UK and the USA.  Methods  We investigated all the independent infectious disease outbreaks in mainland China, the UK, and the USA between 2000 and 2016 (appendix) using the WHO Disease Outbreak News, and we extracted Annual Producer Price Indices (PPI) for livestock meat from the Food and Agriculture Organization Statistics Database. We investigated the economic circumstances under which each independent outbreak of indigenous infectious disease in human beings originating from domestic animals had occurred.  Findings  Between 2000 and 2016, 13 independent infectious disease outbreaks in human beings were recorded in the Chinese Disease Outbreak News, and seven of them were indigenous (not imported). Among these seven outbreaks, four outbreaks were of domestic-animal origin (H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6 avian influenza, and human  Streptococcus suis  infections). Before these four outbreaks, the corresponding PPI for domestic poultry or pig meat had increased sharply (at least on average more than 10% rise in PPI per year) and reached an unprecedented high price. However, in the same period, among the 11 independent outbreaks in human beings in the UK that were recorded in Disease Outbreak News, only one (H7N2 avian influenza, in 2007) was of indigenous domestic-animal origin, whereas the corresponding PPI for poultry meat in the UK was steady before the outbreak, unlike in China. Furthermore, between 2000 and 2016, none of the 20 independent outbreaks in the USA recorded in Disease Outbreak News originated from domestic animals.  Interpretation  By comparison with the UK and the USA, China has had more and worse indigenous outbreaks in human beings, the sources of which were domestic animals. China has a highly diverse animal production throughout the country, as characterised by the diversity of farm sizes, different ways of farm management, and discrepant capabilities of disease prevention and control, along with large backyard feeding operations in rural areas and city suburbs. A sharp increase in PPI for domestic animal meat reflects a steep increase in the production costs. So, before the four independent (or first) outbreaks of indigenous infectious disease of domestic-animal origin in China, related production costs were actually extremely high. Under the circumstances, some animal farmers without economic strength might increasingly resort to irregularities to reduce the effect of steeply rising costs. For example, the domestic animals dying of diseases were likely hidden and illegally processed before entering market circulation. Consequently, a silent generation, reassortment, evolution, or spread of pathogens might come out or be facilitated. Therefore, when production costs rise steeply in China, for the sake of public health, there is a need to ensure economic benefits for animal farmers (particularly for those without economic strength), and also it is necessary to keep the animal farms with weak anti-risk capability phase-out through market mechanisms. Furthermore, to fundamentally reduce the effects of economic factors on the infectious disease burden in China, it is essential to comprehensively strengthen fundamentals for prevention, detection, and control of infectious diseases in animals in China. Thus, this study has implications for policymakers developing strategies for future prevention and control of infectious diseases in China.  Funding  None.",

        "abstract": "We explored the interactions between climate variability and measured persistent organic pollutants (POPs) data in the frequency domain. The spectrum analysis identifies a power period of 1.5 to 7\u00a0years in sampled POPs data in the Great Lakes (GL) and Arctic in the 1990s to 2000s, coinciding with the power period of two climate variabilities, the North Atlantic Oscillation and the El Nino\u2013Southern Oscillation. Results also reveal a decadal power period in monitored POPs time series, which is associated with air temperature and climate indices, demonstrating the connection between the dominant long-term trend in sampled POPs data and climate change. We used a \u201ccocktail party effect\u201d and Fast Independent Component Analysis approaches to blindly separate and isolate the signals in POPs time series from different dynamic and environmental processes in the Arctic and the GL. Among seasonal, interannual, and decadal or longer-term signals extracted from sampled POPs concentration data, the climate signals in hexachlorobenzene in the GL are associated with air temperature, El Nino\u2013Southern Oscillation indices, and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The signals in \u03b1-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and polychlorinated biphenyls observations at three Arctic sites correspond to a Nino 3.4 and the NAO. The other two signals are associated with the longer term and seasonal cycle of POPs. We show that the seasonal cycle and climate change are important factors, buffering the declining trend of \u03b1-HCH. The signals feature extraction from POPs historical data provides a tool to deconstruct the POPs time series and enhance our understanding of the potential effects of climate variations on POPs environmental cycling.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  As a renewable and clean energy source, wind power has become the most rapidly growing energy resource worldwide in the past decades. Wind power has been thought not to exert any negative impacts on the environment. However, since a wind farm can alter the local meteorological conditions and increase the surface roughness lengths, it may affect air pollutants passing through and over the wind farm after released from their sources and delivered to the wind farm. In the present study, we simulated the nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) air concentration within and around the worldu0027s largest wind farm (Jiuquan wind farm in Gansu Province, China) using a coupled meteorology and atmospheric chemistry model WRF-Chem. The results revealed an  edge effect , which featured higher NO 2  levels at the immediate upwind and border region of the wind farm and lower NO 2  concentration within the wind farm and the immediate downwind transition area of the wind farm. A surface roughness length scheme and a wind turbine drag force scheme were employed to parameterize the wind farm in this model investigation. Modeling results show that both parameterization schemes yield higher concentration in the immediate upstream of the wind farm and lower concentration within the wind farm compared to the case without the wind farm. We infer this edge effect and the spatial distribution of air pollutants to be the result of the internal boundary layer induced by the changes in wind speed and turbulence intensity driven by the rotation of the wind turbine rotor blades and the enhancement of surface roughness length over the wind farm. The step change in the roughness length from the smooth to rough surfaces (overshooting) in the upstream of the wind farm decelerates the atmospheric transport of air pollutants, leading to their accumulation. The rough to the smooth surface (undershooting) in the downstream of the wind farm accelerates the atmospheric transport of air pollutants, resulting in lower concentration level.",

        "abstract": "The oncoprotein hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP) results in the dysregulation of lipid metabolism to enhance the development of breast cancer. Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (ACSL1) is required for thioesterification of long-chain fatty acids into their acyl-CoA derivatives. In this study, we present a hypothesis that HBXIP might be involved in the regulation of ACSL1 in breast cancer. Interestingly, we found that the overexpression of HBXIP was able to up-regulate ACSL1 at the levels of mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent manner in breast cancer cells. Conversely, silencing of HBXIP led to the opposite results. Mechanistically, HBXIP as a coactivator interacted with transcriptional factor Sp1 through binding to the promoter of ACSL1 by ChIP assays analysis, leading to the transcription of ACSL1 in breast cancer cells. Immunohistochemistry staining revealed that the positive rate of ACSL1 was 71.4% (35/49) in clinical breast cancer tissues, HBXIP 79.6% (39/49), in which the positive rate of ACSL1 was 76.9% (30/39) in the HBXIP-positive specimens. But, few positive rate of ACSL1 10% (1/10) was observed in normal breast tissues. The mRNA levels of ACSL1 were significantly higher in clinical breast cancer tissues than those in their corresponding peritumor tissues. The mRNA levels of ACSL1 were positively associated with those of HBXIP in clinical breast cancer tissues. Thus, we conclude that the oncoprotein HBXIP is able to up-regulate ACSL1 through activating the transcriptional factor Sp1 in breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "The activation of insulin gene transcription depends on multiple nuclear proteins, including the transcription factors PDX-1 and NeuroD1, which form a transcriptional complex. We recently reported that hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP, also termed LAMTOR5) can modulate glucose metabolism reprogramming in cancer cells. However, the physiological role of HBXIP in the modulation of glucose metabolism in normal tissues is poorly understood. Here, we report that Hbxip is an essential regulator of the effect of the Pdx-1/NeuroD1 complex on insulin gene transcription in murine pancreatic \u03b2 cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that pancreatic \u03b2 cell-specific Hbxip-knockout mice displayed higher fasting blood glucose level and impaired glucose tolerance. Furthermore, Hbxip was involved in the regulation of insulin in pancreas islets and increased insulin gene expression in rat pancreatic \u03b2 cells. Mechanistically, Hbxip stimulated insulin promoter activity by interacting with Pdx-1 and recruiting NeuroD1 to Pdx-1. Functionally, we provide evidence that Hbxip is required for Pdx-1/NeuroD1-mediated insulin expression in rat pancreatic \u03b2 cells. Collectively, these results indicate that Hbxip is involved in the transcription of insulin by increasing levels of the Pdx-1/NeuroD1 complex in animal pancreatic \u03b2 cells. Our finding provides the insight into the mechanism by which Hbxip stimulates the transcription of insulin gene.",

        "abstract": "Chronic infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is closely associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Meta-analyses show that adjuvant anti-HBV therapy is effective for HBV-related HCC patients in clinical. However, the significance that anti-HBV drugs depress HCC is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of telbivudine (LdT), entecavir (ETV) and interferon-\u03b12b (IFN-\u03b12b) on HBV-related HCC. Our data showed that the treatment with the drugs significantly suppressed the growth of HBV-expressing hepatoma cells in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, but failed to work in HBV-free liver cells. We present the hypothesis that HBx may be involved in the event. As expected, we observed that the expression of HBx was down-regulated by the agents. Meanwhile, the expression of HBx downstream factors was significantly down-regulated. Interestingly, LdT, ETV and IFN-\u03b12b lost the anti-proliferation effects on HBV-related hepatoma cells when the cells were treated with HBx siRNA. Moreover, combination of those drugs enhanced the anti-proliferation effects. In conclusion, LdT, ETV and IFN-\u03b12b suppress the growth of HBV-related HCC through down-regulation of HBx. Our finding provides new insights into the mechanisms of anti-HBV drugs in HCC therapy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   We have reported that the oncoprotein hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP) is able to promote migration of breast cancer cells. Fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) is a multipotent growth factor and is highly expressed in various human cancers. However, the regulatory mechanism of FGF4 in breast cancer remains poorly understood. In the present study, we report that HBXIP is able to up-regulate FGF4 to enhance the migration of breast cancer cells. Immunohistochemistry staining showed that HBXIP and FGF4 were highly expressed in clinical metastatic lymph nodes of breast tumor. The expression levels of HBXIP were positively related to those of FGF4 in clinical breast cancer tissues. Then, we validated that HBXIP up-regulated the expression of FGF4 at the levels of promoter, mRNA and protein by luciferase reporter gene assays, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Moreover, we found that HBXIP was able to activate FGF4 promoter through transcriptional factor Sp1 by luciferase reporter gene assays. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that HBXIP coactivated Sp1 to stimulate FGF4 promoter. In function, we showed that HBXIP promoted breast cancer cell migration through FGF4 by wound healing and transwell cell migration assays. Thus, we conclude that the oncoprotein HBXIP up-regulates FGF4 through activating transcriptional factor Sp1 to promote the migration of breast cancer cells. Therapeutically, HBXIP may serve as a novel target in breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Aberrant microRNA expression has been shown to be characteristic of many cancers. It has been reported that the expression levels of miR-30e are decreased in liver cancer tissues. However, the role of miR-30e in hepatocellular carcinoma remains poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the significance of miR-30e in hepatocarcinogenesis. Bioinformatics analysis reveals a putative target site of miR-30e in the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) of prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha-1 (P4HA1) mRNA. Moreover, luciferase reporter gene assays verified that miR-30e directly targeted 3\u2032UTR of P4HA1 mRNA. Then, we demonstrated that miR-30e was able to reduce the expression of P4HA1 at the levels of mRNA and protein using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Enforced expression of miR-30e suppressed proliferation of HepG2 cells by 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay and reduced colony formation of these cells by colony formation analysis. Conversely, anti-miR-30e enhanced the proliferation of hepatoma cells  in\u00a0vitro . Interestingly, the ectopic expression of P4HA1 could efficiently rescue the inhibition of cell proliferation mediated by miR-30e in HepG2 cells. Meanwhile, silencing of P4HA1 abolished the anti-miR-30e-induced proliferation of cells. Clinically, quantitative real-time PCR showed that miR-30e was down-regulated in liver tumor tissues relative to their peritumor tissues. The expression levels of miR-30e were negatively correlated to those of P4HA1 mRNA in clinical liver tumor tissues. Thus, we conclude that miR-30e suppresses proliferation of hepatoma cells through targeting P4HA1 mRNA. Our finding provides new insights into the mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Abnormal lipid metabolism is a hallmark of tumorigenesis. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that fatty acid synthase ( FAS ,  FASN ) is a metabolic oncogene that supports the growth and survival of tumor cells and is highly expressed in many cancers. Here, we report that the oncoprotein, hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP, LAMTOR5) contributes to abnormal lipid metabolism. We show that high expression of HBXIP in 236 breast cancer patients was significantly associated with decreased overall survival and progression-free survival. Interestingly, the expression of HBXIP was positively related to that of FAS in clinical breast cancer tissues, and HBXIP overexpression in breast cancer cells resulted in FAS upregulation. Mechanistically, HBXIP upregulated SREBP-1c (SREBF1), which activates the transcription of FAS, by directly interacting with and coactivating nuclear receptor (NR) liver X receptors (LXR). Physiologically, LXRs are activated via a coactivator containing NR motif in a ligand-dependent manner. However, in breast cancer cells, HBXIP containing the corepressor/nuclear receptor motif with special flanking sequence could coactivate LXRs independent of ligand. Moreover, overexpressed SREBP-1c was able to activate the transcription of HBXIP, forming a positive-feedback loop. Functionally, HBXIP enhanced lipogenesis, resulting in the growth of breast cancer cells  in vitro  and  in vivo . Thus, we conclude that the oncoprotein HBXIP contributes to the abnormal lipid metabolism in breast cancer through LXRs/SREBP-1c/FAS signaling, providing new insights into the mechanisms by which cancer cells reprogram lipid metabolism in their favor.

        "abstract": "Abstract   The oncoprotein Yes-associated protein (YAP) in Hippo pathway plays crucial roles in the development of cancer. However, the mechanism of YAP regulation in cancer remains poorly understood. Here, we supposed that the oncoprotein hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP) might be involved in the modulation of YAP in liver cancer. Interestingly, our data showed that the expression levels of HBXIP were positively associated with those of YAP in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and real-time PCR assays. HBXIP was able to up-regulate YAP in hepatoma cells at the levels of promoter, mRNA and protein. Mechanistically, we identified that HBXIP up-regulated YAP through co-activating the transcription factor c-Myb in hepatoma cells. Functionally, silencing YAP abolished the proliferation of hepatoma cells mediated by HBXIP  in\u00a0vitro . Moreover, knockdown of YAP strongly blocked the HBXIP-enhanced tumor growth in mice. Thus, we conclude that HBXIP up-regulates YAP expression via activating transcription factor c-Myb to facilitate the growth of hepatoma cells.

        "abstract": "Abstract N6 methyladenosine (m6A) is a prevalent modification present in the mRNAs of higher eukaryotes. YTH domain family 2 (YTHDF2), an m6A reader protein, can recognize mRNA m6A sites to mediate mRNA degradation. However, the regulatory mechanism of YTHDF2 is poorly understood. To this end, we investigated the post transcriptional regulation of YTHDF2. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the microRNA miR 145 might target the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) of YTHDF2 mRNA. The levels of miR 145 were negatively correlated with those of YTHDF2 mRNA in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, and immunohistochemical staining revealed that YTHDF2 was closely associated with malignancy of HCC. Interestingly, miR 145 decreased the luciferase activities of 3\u2032UTR of YTHDF2 mRNA. Mutation of predicted miR 145 binding sites in the 3\u2032UTR of YTHDF2 mRNA abolished the miR 145 induced decrease in luciferase activity. Over-expression of miR-145 dose dependently down regulated YTHDF2 expression in HCC cells at the levels of both mRNA and protein. Conversely, inhibition of miR-145 resulted in the up-regulation of YTHDF2 in the cells. Dot blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining revealed that the overexpression of miR-145 strongly increased m6A levels relative to those in control HCC cells, and this increase could be blocked by YTHDF2 overexpression. Moreover, miR-145 inhibition strongly decreased m6A levels, which was rescued by the treatment with a small interfering RNA based YTHDF2 knockdown. Thus, we conclude that miR-145 modulates m6A levels by targeting the 3\u2032UTR of YTHDF2 mRNA in HCC cells.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Abnormal lipid metabolism is a hallmark of tumorigenesis. Hence, the alterations of metabolism enhance the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Aspirin is able to inhibit the growth of cancers through targeting nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB). However, the role of aspirin in disrupting abnormal lipid metabolism in HCC remains poorly understood. In this study, we report that aspirin can suppress the abnormal lipid metabolism of HCC cells through inhibiting acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (ACSL1), a lipid metabolism-related enzyme. Interestingly, oil red O staining showed that aspirin suppressed lipogenesis in HepG2 cells and Huh7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, aspirin attenuated the levels of triglyceride and cholesterol in the cells, respectively. Strikingly, we identified that aspirin was able to down-regulate ACSL1 at the levels of mRNA and protein. Moreover, we validated that aspirin decreased the nuclear levels of NF-\u03baB in HepG2 cells. Mechanically, PDTC, an inhibitor of NF-\u03baB, could down-regulate ACSL1 at the levels of mRNA and protein in the cells. Functionally, PDTC reduced the levels of lipid droplets, triglyceride and cholesterol in HepG2 cells. Thus, we conclude that aspirin suppresses the abnormal lipid metabolism in HCC cells  via  disrupting an NF\u03baB-ACSL1 signaling. Our finding provides new insights into the mechanism by which aspirin inhibits abnormal lipid metabolism of HCC.

The temporal changes of stroke lesion were examined using T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the acute phase (1-3h) and 24h post stroke. Significantly reduced infarct and edema volumes were observed in PIH treated stroke mice, in agreement with TTC staining findings. Also, the TUNEL staining results indicated apoptotic cells were widely distributed among the ischemic cortex in control group but limited in PIH treated mice. Dramatically reduced growth rate of infarction was seen in PIH treated stroke mice. These results demonstrate HPI201 has strong neuroprotection effects during acute stroke. In particular, MRI with the numerical modelling of temporal infarct evolution could provide a unique means to examine and predict the dynamic response of the PIH treatment on infarct evolution.",

        "abstract": "Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in magnetic resonance imaging scans have emerged as indicators of potentially serious side effects in clinical trials of therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease. These anomalies include an edematous type (ARIA-E) that appears as hyperintense (bright) regions by T2-weighted MRI, and a type characterized by the deposition of hemosiderin (ARIA-H) that elicits a hypointense signal, especially in T2* susceptibility weighted images. ARIA in general has been linked to the presence of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2)-type cerebral amyloid angiopathy, an accumulation of misfolded A\u03b2 protein in the vascular wall that impairs the integrity of brain blood vessels. However, the pathobiology of ARIA remains poorly understood, in part due to the absence of an animal model of the disorder that would enable a contemporaneous analysis of tissue integrity in the affected region. Here we describe both ARIA-E and ARIA-H in an aged squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), a nonhuman primate model of naturally occurring cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Histopathologic examination of the anomalous region revealed reactive astrocytosis and microgliosis, infiltration of systemic inflammatory/immune cells, damage to axons and myelin, and hemosiderin deposition. The disruption of axons in particular suggests that ARIA-E could have functional consequences for affected regions. The squirrel monkey model can be useful for studying the pathogenesis and long-term effects of ARIA, and for testing the safety and efficacy of emerging therapies for Alzheimer's disease.",

        "abstract": "Stroke is a devastating neurovascular disorder that results in damage to neurons and white matter tracts. It has been previously demonstrated that neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) protects neurons from ischemic injury following stroke. Here, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was utilized to characterize the effects of NRG-1 treatment on cererbral infarction and integrity of white matter after ischemic insult using a permanent middle celebral artery occlusion (pMCAo) rat model. In the present study, sixteen Sprague-Dawley rats underwent pMCAo surgery and received either a single intra-arterial bolus (20\u202f\u03bcg/kg) dose of NRG-1 or saline immediately prior to pMCAo. MRI including T2-weighted imaging and DTI was performed in the first 3\u202fh post stroke, and repeated 48\u202fh later. It is found that the stroke infarction was significantly reduced in the NRG-1 treated group. Also, NRG-1 prevented the reduction of fractional anisotropy (FA) in white matter tracts of fornix and corpus callosum (CC), indicating its protection of CC and fornix white matter bundles from ischemia insult. As a conclusion, the present DTI results demonstrate that NRG-1 has significantly neuroprotective effects in both cerebral cortex and white matter including corpus callosum and fornix during acute stroke. In particular, NRG-1 is more effective on stroke lesion with mild ischemia. As CC and fornix white matter bundles play critical roles in transcallosal connectivity and hippocampal projections respectively in the central nervous system, the findings could provide complementary information for better understanding the biological mechanism of NRG-1's neuroprotection in ischemic tissues and neurobehavioral effects.",

        "abstract": "Accurate extraction of cardiac fiber orientation from diffusion tensor imaging is important for determining heart structure and function. However, the acquisition of magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor images is costly and time consuming. By comparison, cardiac ultrasound imaging is rapid and relatively inexpensive, but it lacks the capability to directly measure fiber orientations. In order to create a detailed heart model from ultrasound data, a three-dimensional (3D) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with known fiber orientations can be registered to an ultrasound volume through a geometric mask. After registration, the cardiac orientations from the template DTI can be mapped to the heart using a deformable transformation field. This process depends heavily on accurate fiber orientation extraction from the DTI. In this study, we use the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) to determine cardiac fiber orientations in diffusion weighted images. For the registration between ultrasound and MRI volumes, we achieved an average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 81.6\u00b12.1%. For the estimation of fiber orientations from the proposed method, we achieved an acute angle error (AAE) of 22.7\u00b13.1\u00b0 as compared to the direct measurements from DTI. This work provides a new approach to generate cardiac fiber orientation that may be used for many cardiac applications.",

The preliminary results suggest whole-body MRI can be a robust tool to examine multiple organs of non-human primate (NHP) models from head to toe non-invasively and simultaneously using a conventional clinical setting.

A new chip formation mechanism, i.e., the mixture of extrusion and shear, has been observed.

However, the machining errors especially geometric errors have a significant influence on the form accuracy of machined surfaces. A machining error model for a three-axis ultra-precision lathe is established based on multi-body system (MBS) theory to study the effect of geometric errors on the coordinate distortion and form accuracy. The machining errors are classified into five categories according to the coordinate distortions direction. These errors generate the coordinate distortions along the  X  direction,  Y  direction, radial direction, circumferential direction, and axial direction respectively. Five error categories have different effects on different typical surfaces, and the main machining errors on the form accuracy are identified according to the difference of the form error distribution for different surface shapes. Simulation is implemented to verify the influence of the machining errors on the form accuracy. One plane-spherical surface was proposed and machined to separate the main machining errors, which are used to be compensated in the machining experiments. The form accuracy of one freeform surface is proved to achieve a significant improvement finally.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Diamond cutting of hard and brittle materials is difficult owing to poor surface quality and severe tool wear. It has been clear that ion implantation can be used to improve the machinability. In previous studies, surface modification is realized by the nuclear collision cascade that induces phase transition during the implantation. Except for the nuclear collision process, electronic interaction between the incident particles and the target material, such as ionization, also occurs particularly during a high-energy ion implantation. However, the influence of ionization on the machinability has not been studied. In this paper, modification on the nanocutting of silicon by MeV oxygen ions is studied. Molecular dynamics simulation is conducted to reveal the nanocutting process on silicon with irradiation damages. Experiments show an enhancement in the critical undeformed chip thickness that is crucial in machining of brittle materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Micro-structures have numerous applications for improving the surface functionability in various fields, such as surface mechanics, optics, and biology. However, machining micro-structures on brittle materials is difficult owing to the serious fractures that occur on the machined surface. To solve this problem, a method using ion implantation to modify the workpiece surface layer has been developed over the last seven years, but how to fabricate the modified layer efficiently is still unsolved and becomes a critical issue which blocks the application of this method in production. A modified layer that is thick enough for the machining is always preferred. This is difficult for the single-implantation approach studied before, owing to the large consumption in cost and time. In this study, diamond cutting assisted by multi-implantation is proposed to fabricate micro-structure array on silicon, a typical hard and brittle material. The novel method in this study shows distinct flexibility in the design of process parameters, as well as obvious improvement in efficiency. The result of surface modification is evaluated from aspects of crystal lattice and nanomechanics. The influence of channel effect is also discussed. Furthermore, chips with shear bands are discovered and analyzed in the cutting of modified silicon, which is extraordinary in the machining of brittle materials. And the brittle\u2013ductile transition depth is significantly enhanced. Therefore, not only is multi-implantation capable of preparing thick modified layer, it also realizes further modification on material properties which is fundamental for improving the machinability. Finally, a micro-pillar array formed by 270 orthogonal cylindrical grooves (17956 micro-pillar units) is achieved in ductile mode by fly-cutting. It indicates that multi-implantation is a promising method for the micro-machining of brittle materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Ductile-regime machining of brittle materials is a critical issue for ultra-precision manufacturing, because the machined surface is prone to be damaged by brittle fracture. Previous studies have showed that surface modification by ion implantation can be used to reduce the brittleness and improve the machinability. However, most researches focus on the formation of a continuous modified layer extending from surface to a specific depth. Although this configuration could provide a remarkable modification, it always requires a large ion dose and is time consuming. For this reason, a buried modified layer model is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the effect of the modified layer on crack propagation is studied by molecular dynamics simulation, which indicates an increase in fracture resistance of the buried modified layer model. Then, ion implantations are conducted on the (100) surface of silicon, and modification on the lattice structure is evaluated by Raman spectrum and transmission electron microscopy. Finally, diamond turning test is conducted and the critical undeformed chip thickness is measured. The results show that the buried modified layer is a potential configuration for improving the diamond turning process on brittle material.",

        "title": "Machining approach of freeform optics on infrared materials via ultra-precision turning.",
        "abstract": "Optical freeform surfaces are of great advantage in excellent optical performance and integrated alignment features. It has wide applications in illumination, imaging and non-imaging, etc. Machining freeform surfaces on infrared (IR) materials with ultra-precision finish is difficult due to its brittle nature. Fast tool servo (FTS) assisted diamond turning is a powerful technique for the realization of freeform optics on brittle materials due to its features of high spindle speed and high cutting speed. However it has difficulties with large slope angles and large rise-and-falls in the sagittal direction. In order to overcome this defect, the balance of the machining quality on the freeform surface and the brittle nature in IR materials should be realized. This paper presents the design of a near-rotational freeform surface (NRFS) with a low non-rotational degree (NRD) to constraint the variation of traditional freeform optics to solve this issue. In NRFS, the separation of the surface results in a rotational part and a residual part denoted as a non-rotational surface (NRS). Machining NRFS on germanium is operated by FTS diamond turning. Characteristics of the surface indicate that the optical finish of the freeform surface has been achieved. The modulation transfer function (MTF) of the freeform optics shows a good agreement to the design expectation. Images of the final optical system confirm that the fabricating strategy is of high efficiency and high quality. Challenges and prospects are discussed to provide guidance of future work.",

        "abstract": "Off-axis reflective imaging systems are widely used, but manufacturing issues are seldom considered in their design. This paper proposes a direct design method for cylindrical freeform imaging systems considering manufacturing constraints to facilitate ultraprecise raster milling. The initial freeform shapes of a well-restricted system configuration are constructed using feature data points and calculated based on the constant optical path length condition. An iterative process with coefficient adjustment of the surface expression is employed to optimize the freeform mirrors for both image quality and the degree of deviation from a reference surface. The method's feasibility is validated by designing an off-axis three-mirror imaging system that operates at F/2.0 with a 100 mm entrance pupil diameter and a 4\u00b0 \u00d7 4\u00b0 field of view. The freeform surfaces are guaranteed to be distributed along a cylinder 150 mm in radius for ultraprecise raster milling.",

        "abstract": "Freeform surface is promising to be the next generation optics, however it needs high form accuracy for excellent performance. The closed-loop of fabrication-measurement-compensation is necessary for the improvement of the form accuracy. It is difficult to do an off-machine measurement during the freeform machining because the remounting inaccuracy can result in significant form deviations. On the other side, on-machine measurement may hides the systematic errors of the machine because the measuring device is placed in situ on the machine. This study proposes a new compensation strategy based on the combination of on-machine and off-machine measurement. The freeform surface is measured in off-machine mode with nanometric accuracy, and the on-machine probe achieves accurate relative position between the workpiece and machine after remounting. The compensation cutting path is generated according to the calculated relative position and shape errors to avoid employing extra manual adjustment or highly accurate reference-feature fixture. Experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

        "abstract": "Focusing error detection by the astigmatic method, an important measurement technique, is used widely due to its simple operation and low cost. However, the focus error signal (FES) is prone to noise with the control circuit and the signal conditioning method. To address this, an astigmatic detection system was constructed with a modified digital video disc (DVD) optical head. By designing a stable laser drive control circuit using a low-noise signal conditioning method, the developed system can reduce the FES of background noise. Additionally, by analyzing the data interpolation and approximation model, the corresponding defocus error signal is extracted. The exact optical design of the method has been verified through simulations. Moreover, an experiment is set up to verify the feasibility of the developed method. It is concluded that the method is effective to reduce the background noise 2\u00a0nm and the standard deviation 2.15\u00a0mV, with PZT working frequencies ranging from 300\u00a0Hz to 2\u00a0kHz.",

        "abstract": "Reflective axicons, widely used in optical alignment and Bessel\u2013Gauss beam generation, require a highly accurate cone angle and surface metrology. However, current methods focus on the cone angle measurement and it is still difficult to measure the surface of a reflective axicon with a small cone angle. An interferometer measurement method using an optical inner surface is proposed to obtain the surface and cone angle simultaneously. The optical axis of the axicon and the optical inner surface should align together and be parallel to the beam light from the interferometer. The interference fringe would be obtained by the optical system consisting of the axicon and the optical inner surface. The theoretical model is established and analyzed through ray tracing theory, and is verified by optical simulation software. Fabrication errors in the axicon and the inner surface, and misalignment of the measurement setup are investigated systematically and separated in the measurement process. In the experiments, the reflective axicon with a cone angle of about 90\u00b0 was measured by the proposed method, the results of which show good agreement with a stylus profiler (Taylor-Hobson PGI 3D) in cone angle trend and generatrix error. Experimental results prove the feasibility of the proposed method. This economical and effective method can be widely used with all types of reflective axicons, and it can obtain the surface error map of the axicon as well as the inner cylinder at the same time. The uncertainty and resolution of the proposed method is based on the performance of the interferometer. The uncertainty of alignment angle errors is less than 10\u221210 rad; the lateral resolution is 53.8 \u00b5m.",

        "abstract": "The side flow of material in nano cutting is one of the most important factors that deteriorate the machined surface quality. The effects of the crystallographic orientation, feed, and the cutting tool geometry, including tool edge radius, rake angle and inclination angle, on the side flow are investigated employing molecular dynamics simulation. The results show that the stagnation region is formed in front of tool edge and it is characterized by the stagnation radius R  and stagnation height h  . The side flow is formed because the material at or under the stagnation region is extruded by the tool edge to flow to the side of the tool edge. Higher stagnation height would increase the size of the side flow. The anisotropic nature of the material which partly determines the stagnation region also influences the side flow due to the different deformation mechanism under the action of the tool edge. At different cutting directions, the size of the side flow has a great difference which would finally affect the machined surface quality. The cutting directions of {100}\u2009<\u2009011>, {110}\u2009<\u2009001>, and {110}\u2009<\u20091-10\u2009>\u2009are beneficial to obtain a better surface quality with small side flow. Besides that, the side flow could be suppressed by reducing the feed and optimizing the cutting tool geometry. Cutting tool with small edge radius, large positive rake angle, and inclination angle would decrease the side flow and consequently improve the machined surface quality.",

        "abstract": "The tool edge has a significant influence on a cutting process especially when it is comparable to uncut chip thickness. Generally, the cutting tool edge is considered rounded and is characterized by a tool edge radius. When the cutting tool edge geometry is not a symmetrical circle, the tool edge radius fitted with the former methods is not sufficient to describe the performance of the cutting edge. In this study, a parameter, which is different from the previous description method, is proposed to characterize the tool edge. Three different tool edges are reconstructed to investigate the effect of the proposed parameter on a nano-cutting process using molecular dynamics. Results show that combined with the former used tool edge radius, the newly proposed tool edge characterization parameter which is the tool edge radius fitted with the edge profile at the flank face side could be used to characterize the cutting performance of an asymmetric tool edge. The minimum uncut chip thickness, subsurface damage, and cutting force in feed direction investigated in this study tend to increase with the newly proposed characterization parameter. A stagnation region formed in front of the cutting edge acts as a new formed cutting edge making the material removed in shearing mechanism when the uncut chip thickness is larger than the minimum uncut chip thickness. However, when it is similar or smaller than minimum uncut chip thickness, the stagnation region is not tough enough to cut the materials making it to slide on the surface and part of the atoms in the upper layer of workpiece is removed by extrusion. Two models are proposed to describe the shearing and extrusion mechanism in a nano-cutting process.",

In this investigation, a hard particle which is simplified as a diamond ball is embedded under the free surface of workpiece with different depths. The influence of the position of the hard ball on the surface generation and other material removal mechanism, such as the movement of the ball under the action of cutting tool edge, is revealed. The results show that when the hard particle is removed, only a small shallow pit is left on the machined surface. Otherwise, it is pressed down to the subsurface of the workpiece left larger and deeper pit on the generated surface. Besides that, the hard particle in the workpiece would increase the processing force when the cutting tool edge or the plastic carriers interact with the hard particle.

        "abstract": "Abstract   The effects of the recovery and side flow on the surface generation, as well as the stagnation region, phase transformation in nano-cutting of single crystal silicon are investigated by means of molecular dynamics. In this study, the workpiece material would experience two cutting processes in the conditions where the recovery and subsurface damage of the former cutting trace could be and not be taken into consideration. Therefore, the combined effects of the side flow and recovery on the surface generation are decoupled and investigated respectively. The results show that the side flow of the material increases the generated surface roughness making it deviate from the theoretical value. The recovery left on the former cutting trace enlarges the size of side flow and further increases the surface roughness indirectly. But the overall surface roughness is decreased by the effect of recovery. Comparing the effects of the side flow and the recovery on the generated surface roughness, the side flow plays a more important role in surface generation of nano-cutting process. Therefore, the suppression of the side flow is an effective way to improve the generated surface roughness in nano-cutting. The phase of single crystal silicon in machined subsurface is transformed to amorphous and bct5-Si phases. A larger stagnation height would make more materials phase transformed.",

The effects of anisotropic nature of single crystal materials in nano-cutting are investigated employing the molecular dynamics simulation. Results show that the size effect of the plastic deformation is based on different plastic carriers, such as the twin, stacking faults, and dislocations. The minimum uncut chip thickness is dependent on cutting direction, where even a negative value is obtained when the cutting direction is {110}<001>. It also determines the material deformation and removal mechanism (e.g., shearing, extruding, and rubbing mechanism) with a decrease in uncut chip thickness. When material is deformed by shearing, the primary shearing zone expands from the stagnation point or the tip of stagnation zone. When a material is deformed by extruding and rubbing, the primary deformation zone almost parallels to the cutting direction and expands from the bottom of the cutting edge merging with the tertiary deformation zone. The generated surface quality relates to the crystallographic orientation and the minimum uncut chip thickness. The cutting directions of {110}<001>, {110}<1-10>, and {111}<1-10>, whose minimum uncut chip thickness is relatively small, have better surface qualities compared to the other cutting direction.",

In the context of this paper, a sensor is called active if it can obtain information about certain objects while a sensor is called inactive if it cannot obtain information. Moreover, each sensor is able to determine if it is active or inactive. Although inactive sensors do not provide information, they are needed in order to maintain connectivity of the communication graph. Due to the existence of inactive sensors, the existing research on consensus-based information fusion for a team of active sensors cannot be applied. We first provide a mathematical formulation of consensus-based information fusion for both inactive and active sensors. Then we derive sufficient conditions to guarantee that all active and inactive sensors reach consensus on their final state information. In particular, we consider two different cases: (1) the existence of one inactive sensor, and (2) the existence of multiple inactive sensors. For the first case, we also show explicitly the final state information of all active sensors.",

Each local FTC component consists of a fault diagnosis module and a reconfigurable controller module comprised of a baseline controller and two adaptive fault-tolerant controllers activated after fault detection and after fault isolation, respectively. The FTC algorithms are implemented and demonstrated using a team of ground mobile robots.",

The authors present several analytical models for predicting and evaluating the overhead of interprocessor communication, process scheduling, process synchronization, and remote memory access, where network contention and memory contention are considered. Performance measurements to support the models and analyses through several numerical examples have been done on the BBN GP1000, a NUMA shared-memory multiprocessor. Analytical and experimental results give a comprehensive understanding of the various effects, which are important for the effective use of NUMA shared-memory multiprocessor. The results presented can be used to determine optimal strategies in developing an efficient programming environment for a NUMA system",

        "abstract": "Global warming mainly due to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and other greenhouse gases has initiated wide interest in the investigation of various land CO 2 sequestration mechanisms. As a long-term terrestrial carbon sequestration mechanism, phytolith carbon sequestration may play an important role in the global carbon cycle and climate change. This study investigated the distribution of phytoliths and phytolith-occluded carbon (PhytOC) in shrublands of North China to understand the potential of phytolith carbon sequestration within shrublands. The results indicated positive correlations between PhytOC content of biomass and phytolith content of biomass in the shrub layer, and between PhytOC content of biomass and carbon content of phytoliths in the herb layer of shrublands. The PhytOC production fluxes of five shrublands through shrub leaves and herb layers were 4.12\u20137.94 kg CO 2 ha\u22121 a\u22121 with an average of 5.95 kg CO 2 ha\u22121 a\u22121, and decreased in the following order: Ostryopsis davidiana-shrubland u003eSpiraea salicifolia-shrubland \u2248Armeniaca sibirica-shrubland u003e Ziziphus jujuba-shrubland u003eVitex negundo-shrubland. The mean rate of PhytOC production in temperate shrubland of North China was 0.45 \u00b1 0.09 Tg CO 2 a\u22121. The data indicate that phytolith carbon sequestration in shrublands is a significant mechanism to mediate the increase of atmospheric CO 2. The potential of phytolith carbon sequestration in China\u2019s shrublands may be further enhanced by adaptive management of shrublands, such as conservation of plant species with high PhytOC production flux.",

Grassland degradation has a significant influence on the coupled biogeochemical cycles of C and silicon in the Inner Mongolian steppe of China, but there are few reports about the impact of grassland degradation on phytolith C sequestration in the steppe, the main grassland in northern China. Twelve sampling sites were chosen in the Xilingol League. Soil samples (0\u201350\u00a0cm) were collected from grasslands of four different degradation degrees to investigate the impact of grassland degradation on the soil phytolith and phytolith-occluded C (PhytOC) accumulation using a mass-balance approach. Soil phytolith storages were 12.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.15, 15.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.65, 14.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.79 and 13.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.07\u00a0t\u00a0ha \u2212\u00a01  in non-degraded, lightly degraded, moderately degraded and seriously degraded grasslands, respectively. The corresponding storages of soil PhytOC were 0.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02, 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02, 0.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 and 0.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0t\u00a0ha \u2212\u00a01 , respectively. The observed significant differences in soil phytoliths and PhytOC among grasslands of different degradation degrees indicate that grassland degradation influenced the phytolith and PhytOC accumulation in grassland soils. Grazing and harvesting are likely the major factors affecting soil phytolith and PhytOC storages through reducing the litterfall returning fluxes. Our preliminary findings imply that grassland restoration could be a promising way to increase long-term phytolith C sequestration through maximizing plant PhytOC production fluxes and soil PhytOC accumulation in degraded grasslands.",

To unravel the role of forest composition on phytolith production, soil phytolith distribution, and phytolith C sequestration in soils, we investigated community composition and examined phytoliths and PhytOC of mature leaves or needles of dominant trees and understory herbs, as well as soil profiles (50\u00a0cm depth) within  Quercus ,  Betula ,  Larix  and  Pinus  forest ecosystems of northern China. Results showed that herb layers contributed 72%, 52%, 40%, and 5% to the flux of phytolith production within  Betula  forest (18.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.26\u00a0kg\u00a0ha \u2212\u00a01 \u00a0yr \u2212\u00a01 ),  Quercus  forest (28.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77\u00a0kg\u00a0ha \u2212\u00a01 \u00a0yr \u2212\u00a01 ),  Larix  forest (37.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.80\u00a0kg\u00a0ha \u2212\u00a01 \u00a0yr \u2212\u00a01 ) and  Pinus  forest (16.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.30\u00a0kg\u00a0ha \u2212\u00a01 \u00a0yr \u2212\u00a01 ), respectively. The distribution pattern of soil phytoliths from topsoil to subsoil could be classified into three types: significantly decreasing pattern ( Betula  forest and  Quercus  forest), non-significantly decreasing pattern ( Larix  forest), and initially increasing and then decreasing pattern ( Pinus  forest). Within 0\u201350\u00a0cm soil depth, the PhytOC storage of  Betula  forest,  Quercus  forest,  Larix  forest and  Pinus  forest were 0.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0t\u00a0ha \u2212\u00a01 , 0.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0t\u00a0ha \u2212\u00a01 , 0.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0t\u00a0ha \u2212\u00a01  and 0.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0t\u00a0ha \u2212\u00a01 , respectively. Moreover, the soil PhytOC turnover times of these four forest types were estimated to be 537,503,363 and 560\u00a0year, respectively, which were at least 8\u201320 times slower than soil organic carbon contributing to climate change mitigation. Overall, our findings indicate that composition of the forest community controls the production flux of phytoliths and the distribution of soil phytoliths, and influences the biogenic silica and its coupled carbon cycles.",

        "abstract": "Phytolith-occluded carbon (PhytOC) can be preserved in soils or sediments for thousands of years and might be a promising potential mechanism for long-term terrestrial carbon (C) sequestration. As the principal pathway for the return of organic matters to soils, the forest litter layers make a considerable contribution to terrestrial C sequestration. Although previous studies have estimated the phytolith production fluxes in the above-ground vegetations of various terrestrial ecosystems, the storages of phytoliths and PhytOC in litter layers have not been thoroughly investigated, especially in forest ecosystems. Using analytical data of silica, phytoliths, return fluxes and storages of forest litter, this study estimated the phytolith and PhytOC storages in litter layers in different forest types in southern China. The results indicated that the total phytolith storage in forest litter layers in southern China was 24.34 \u00b1 8.72 Tg. Among the different forest types, the phytolith storage in bamboo forest litter layers (15.40 \u00b1 3.40 Tg) was much higher than that in other forests. At the same time, the total PhytOC storage reached up to 2.68 \u00b1 0.96 Tg CO in forest litter layers in southern China, of which approximately 60% was contributed by bamboo forest litter layers. Based on the current litter turnover time of different forest types in southern China, a total of 1.01 \u00b1 0.32 Tg of PhytOC per year would be released into soil profiles as a stable C pool during litter decomposition, which would make an important contribution to the global terrestrial long-term biogeochemical C sink. Therefore, the important role of PhytOC storage in forest litter layers should be taken into account in evaluating long-term forest C budgets.",

        "abstract": "Coordinating parallel tasks and minimizing communication delays are two important issues for the design of scheduling policies on networks of workstations. We address the two issues by presenting a scheduling scheme, called self-coordinated local scheduling. It consists of two parts: computation scheduling and communication scheduling. The computation scheduler on each workstation schedules its parallel task and local user jobs independently based on a static power preservation in that workstation so that parallel tasks on different workstations are executed at the same pace to achieve a global coordination. To minimize the communication latency, each local scheduler uses a non-preemptive strategy to try to make communication activities complete as soon as possible. The scheduling scheme is evaluated by simulating the execution of four NAS benchmark programs, and comparing it with a Unix based scheduling policy and the co-scheduling policy. Our experiments show that the power preservation in each workstation guarantees the performance of both parallel and local jobs. Furthermore, the communication delay is reduced significantly by the communication scheduling compared with a spinning based scheme and a Unix based scheme.

An effective NOW schedul- ing scheme needs sufficient information about system heterogene- ity and job interactions. We use the measured power weight of each workstation to quantify the differences of computing capa- bility in the system. Without a processing power usage agreement between parallel jobs and local user jobs in a workstation, job interactions are unpredictable, and performance of either type of jobs may not be guaranteed. Using the quantified and de- terministic system information, we design a scheduling scheme called self-coordinated local scheduling on a heterogeneous NOW. Based on a power usage agreement between local and parallel jobs, this scheme coordinates parallel processes independently in each workstation based on the coscheduling principle. We discuss its implementation on Unix System V Release 4 (SVR4).

        "title": "Architectural effects of symmetric multiprocessors on TPC-C commercial workload",
        "abstract": "Commercial transaction processing applications are an important workload running on symmetric multiprocessor systems (SMPs). They differ dramatically from scientific, numeric-intensive, and engineering applications because they are I/O bound, and they contain more system software activities. Most SMP servers available in the market have been designed and optimized for scientific and engineering workloads. A major challenge of studying architectural effects on the performance of a commercial workload is the lack of easy access to large-scale and complex database engines running on a multiprocessor system with powerful I/O facilities. Experiments involving case studies have been shown to be highly time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using queuing network models with the support of simulation to study the SMP architectural impacts on the performance of commercial workloads. We use the commercial benchmark TPC-C as the workload. A bus-based SMP machine is used as the target platform. Queueing network modeling is employed to characterize the TPC-C workload on the SMP. The system components such as processors, memory, the memory bus, I/O buses, and disks are modeled as service centers, and their effects on performance are analyzed. Simulations are conducted as well to collect the workload-specific parameters (model parameterization) and to verify the accuracy of the model. Our studies find that among disk-related parameters, the disk rotation latency affects the performance of TPC-C most significantly. Among I/O buses and number of disks, the number of I/O buses has the deepest impact on performance. This study also demonstrates that our modeling approach is feasible, cost-effective, and accurate for evaluating the performance of commercial workloads on SMPs, and it is complementary to the measurement-based experimental approaches.",

Local users may run some applications in their workstations which involve communications as well. This paper examines the effects of communication interactions of parallel and local jobs on a nondedicated NOW. Three representative communication patterns of parallel jobs are considered. A quantitative model to characterize the interactions is proposed. Measurement results on a NOW support the analytical model and indicate that the network interface in the TCP/IP protocol forms a communication bottleneck during interactions because a standard network interface with a single input/output queue is not able to distinguish communication requests from parallel and local jobs. Therefore, small but important communication messages of a parallel job, such as a barrier synchronization, could be easily blocked by a communication request of a local job, which would degrade the performance of the parallel job significantly. A double queue scheme in the network interface is proposed. Using available information from the protocol layer, the scheme is able to distinguish the two types of communication requests and give a higher priority to parallel jobs' communication requests. The simulation results show that the scheme could improve the performance of parallel jobs without significantly affecting the performance of local jobs.",

        "abstract": "Networks of workstations (NOWS) are cost-effective platforms to perform parallel computation. Usually, a NOW is not dedicated to parallel jobs. Local users may run some applications in their workstations which involve communications as well. This paper examines the effects of communication interactions of parallel and local jobs on a nondedicated NOW. Three representative communication patterns of parallel jobs are considered. A quantitative model to characterize the interactions is proposed. Measurement results on a NOW support the analytical model and indicate that the network interface in the TCP/IP protocol forms a communication bottleneck during interactions because a standard network interface with a single input/output queue is not able to distinguish communication requests from parallel and local jobs. Therefore, small but important communication messages of a parallel job, such as a barrier synchronization, could be easily blocked by a communication request of a local job, which would degrade the performance of the parallel job significantly. A double queue scheme in the network interface is proposed. Using available information from the protocol layer, the scheme is able to distinguish the two types of communication requests and give a higher priority to parallel jobs' communication requests. The simulation results show that the scheme could improve the performance of parallel jobs without significantly affecting the performance of local jobs.",

        "abstract": "With the fast technical improvement, flash memory based Solid State Drives (SSDs) are becoming an important part of the computer storage hierarchy to significantly improve performance and energy efficiency. However, due to its relatively high price and low capacity, a major system research issue to address is on how to make SSDs play their most effective roles in a high-performance storage system in cost- and performance-effective ways. In this paper, we will answer several related questions with insights based on the design and implementation of a high performance hybrid storage system, called Hystor. We make the best use of SSDs in storage systems by achieving a set of optimization objectives from both system deployment and algorithm design perspectives. Hystor manages both SSDs and hard disk drives (HDDs) as one single block device with minimal changes to existing OS kernels. By monitoring I/O access patterns at runtime, Hystor can effectively identify blocks that (1) can result in long latencies or (2) are semantically critical (e.g. file system metadata), and stores them in SSDs for future accesses to achieve a significant performance improvement. In order to further leverage the exceptionally high performance of writes in the state-of-the-art SSDs, Hystor also serves as a write-back buffer to speed up write requests. Our measurements on Hystor implemented in the Linux kernel 2.6.25.8 show that it can take advantage of the performance merits of SSDs with only a few lines of changes to the stock Linux kernel. Our system study shows that in a highly effective hybrid storage system, SSDs should play a major role as an independent storage where the best suitable data are adaptively and timely migrated in and retained, and it can also be effective to serve as a write-back buffer.",

        "title": "Essential roles of exploiting internal parallelism of flash memory based solid state drives in high-speed data processing",
        "abstract": "Flash memory based solid state drives (SSDs) have shown a great potential to change storage infrastructure fundamentally through their high performance and low power. Most recent studies have mainly focused on addressing the technical limitations caused by special requirements for writes in flash memory. However, a unique merit of an SSD is its rich internal parallelism, which allows us to offset for the most part of the performance loss related to technical limitations by significantly increasing data processing throughput. In this work we present a comprehensive study of essential roles of internal parallelism of SSDs in high-speed data processing. Besides substantially improving I/O bandwidth (e.g. 7.2\u8133), we show that by exploiting internal parallelism, SSD performance is no longer highly sensitive to access patterns, but rather to other factors, such as data access interferences and physical data layout. Specifically, through extensive experiments and thorough analysis, we obtain the following new findings in the context of concurrent data processing in SSDs. (1) Write performance is largely independent of access patterns (regardless of being sequential or random), and can even outperform reads, which is opposite to the long-existing common understanding about slow writes on SSDs. (2) One performance concern comes from interference between concurrent reads and writes, which causes substantial performance degradation. (3) Parallel I/O performance is sensitive to physical data-layout mapping, which is largely not observed without parallelism. (4) Existing application designs optimized for magnetic disks can be suboptimal for running on SSDs with parallelism. Our study is further supported by a group of case studies in database systems as typical data-intensive applications. With these critical findings, we give a set of recommendations to application designers and system architects for exploiting internal parallelism and maximizing the performance potential of SSDs.",

        "abstract": "Although Flash Memory based Solid State Drive (SSD) exhibits high performance and low power consumption, a critical concern is its limited lifespan along with the associated reliability issues. In this paper, we propose to build a Content-Aware Flash Translation Layer (CAFTL) to enhance the endurance of SSDs at the device level. With no need of any semantic information from the host, CAFTL can effectively reduce write traffic to flash memory by removing unnecessary duplicate writes and can also substantially extend available free flash memory space by coalescing redundant data in SSDs, which further improves the efficiency of garbage collection and wear-leveling. In order to retain high data access performance, we have also designed a set of acceleration techniques to reduce the runtime overhead and minimize the performance impact caused by extra computational cost. Our experimental results show that our solution can effectively identify up to 86.2% of the duplicate writes, which translates to a write traffic reduction of up to 24.2% and extends the flash space by a factor of up to 31.2%. Meanwhile, CAFTL only incurs a minimized performance overhead by a factor of up to 0.5%.",

        "abstract": "Flash Memory based Solid State Drive (SSD) has been called a \"pivotal technology\" that could revolutionize data storage systems. Since SSD shares a common interface with the traditional hard disk drive (HDD), both physically and logically, an effective integration of SSD into the storage hierarchy is very important. However, details of SSD hardware implementations tend to be hidden behind such narrow interfaces. In fact, since sophisticated algorithms are usually, of necessity, adopted in SSD controller firmware, more complex performance dynamics are to be expected in SSD than in HDD systems. Most existing literature or product specifications on SSD just provide high-level descriptions and standard performance data, such as bandwidth and latency. In order to gain insight into the unique performance characteristics of SSD, we have conducted intensive experiments and measurements on different types of state-of-the-art SSDs, from low-end to high-end products. We have observed several unexpected performance issues and uncertain behavior of SSDs, which have not been reported in the literature. For example, we found that fragmentation could seriously impact performance -- by a factor of over 14 times on a recently announced SSD. Moreover, contrary to the common belief that accesses to SSD are uncorrelated with access patterns, we found a strong correlation between performance and the randomness of data accesses, for both reads and writes. In the worst case, average latency could increase by a factor of 89 and bandwidth could drop to only 0.025MB/sec. Our study reveals several unanticipated aspects in the performance dynamics of SSD technology that must be addressed by system designers and data-intensive application users in order to effectively place it in the storage hierarchy.",

        "abstract": "As storage systems become increasingly heterogeneous and complex, it adds burdens on DBAs, causing suboptimal performance even after a lot of human efforts have been made. In addition, existing monitoring-based storage management by access pattern detections has difficulties to handle workloads that are highly dynamic and concurrent. To achieve high performance by best utilizing heterogeneous storage devices, we have designed and implemented a heterogeneity-aware software framework for DBMS storage management called hStorage-DB, where semantic information that is critical for storage I/O is identified and passed to the storage manager. According to the collected semantic information, requests are classified into different types. Each type is assigned a proper QoS policy supported by the underlying storage system, so that every request will be served with a suitable storage device. With hStorage-DB, we can well utilize semantic information that cannot be detected through data access monitoring but is particularly important for a hybrid storage system. To show the effectiveness of hStorage-DB, we have implemented a system prototype that consists of an I/O request classification enabled DBMS, and a hybrid storage system that is organized into a two-level caching hierarchy. Our performance evaluation shows that hStorage-DB can automatically make proper decisions for data allocation in different storage devices and make substantial performance improvements in a cost-efficient way.",

        "abstract": "Reduced glutathione (GSH) is a crucial endogenous antioxidant that plays a central role in maintaining cell activity by involving in cellular defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, the detection of intracellular GSH is essential to monitor the cellular state. Herein, graphene oxide-MnO-fluorescein (GO-MnO-FL) nanocomposite was synthesized and used for GSH detection. GSH could reduce MnO to Mn and block the energy transfer between FL and GO-MnO, leading to the significant fluorescence enhancement of FL. The fluorescence-based GSH sensing has a limit of detection of 1.53\u202f\u03bcM and a wide detection range of 10\u202f\u03bcM-2\u202fmM. Moreover, the GO-MnO-FL nanocomposite was found to selectively image the cancer cells since the GSH content of cancer cells is higher than that of normal cells. In vivo experiments also confirmed the normal/cancer cell differentiation capability and excellent tumor-targeting ability of the GO-MnO-FL nanocomposite. These properties make the GO-MnO-FL nanocomposite an excellent fluorescent probe for GSH detection both in vitro and in vivo, and we believe it may hold great potential for GSH-mediated cancer diagnosis.",

        "title": "Shape-Dependent Radiosensitization Effect of Gold Nanostructures in Cancer Radiotherapy: Comparison of Gold Nanoparticles, Nanospikes, and Nanorods.",
        "abstract": "The shape effect of gold (Au) nanomaterials on the efficiency of cancer radiotherapy has not been fully elucidated. To address this issue, Au nanomaterials with different shapes but similar average size (\u223c50 nm) including spherical gold nanoparticles (GNPs), gold nanospikes (GNSs), and gold nanorods (GNRs) were synthesized and functionalized with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) molecules. Although all of these Au nanostructures were coated with the same PEG molecules, their cellular uptake behavior differed significantly. The GNPs showed the highest cellular responses as compared to the GNSs and the GNRs (based on the same gold mass) after incubation with KB cancer cells for 24 h. The cellular uptake in cells increased in the order of GNPs > GNSs > GNRs. Our comparative studies indicated that all of these PEGylated Au nanostructures could induce enhanced cancer cell-killing rates more or less upon X-ray irradiation. The sensitization enhancement ratios (SERs) calculated by a multitarget single-hit model were 1.62, 1.37, and 1.21 corresponding to the treatments of GNPs, GNSs, and GNRs, respectively, demonstrating that the GNPs showed a higher anticancer efficiency than both GNSs and GNRs upon X-ray irradiation. Almost the same values were obtained by dividing the SERs of the three types of Au nanomaterials by their corresponding cellular uptake amounts, indicating that the higher SER of GNPs was due to their much higher cellular uptake efficiency. The above results indicated that the radiation enhancement effects were determined by the amount of the internalized gold atoms. Therefore, to achieve a strong radiosensitization effect in cancer radiotherapy, it is necessary to use Au-based nanomaterials with a high cellular internalization. Further studies on the radiosensitization mechanisms demonstrated that ROS generation and cell cycle redistribution induced by Au nanostructures played essential roles in enhancing radiosensitization. Taken together, our results indicated that the shape of Au-based nanomaterials had a significant influence on cancer radiotherapy. The present work may provide important guidance for the design and use of Au nanostructures in cancer radiotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Herein, water-dispersible carbon nano-onion clusters (CNOCs) with an average hydrodynamic size of \u224890 nm are prepared by simply sonicating candle soot in a mixture of oxidizing acid. The obtained CNOCs have high photothermal conversion efficiency (57.5%), excellent aqueous dispersibility (stable in water for more than a year without precipitation), and benign biocompatibility. After polyethylenimine (PEI) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) modification, the resultant CNOCs-PEI-PEG have a high photothermal conversion efficiency (56.5%), and can realize after-wash photothermal cancer cell ablation due to their ultrahigh cellular uptake (21.3 pg/cell), which is highly beneficial for the selective ablation of cancer cells via light-triggered intracellular heat generation. More interestingly, the cellular uptake of CNOCs-PEI-PEG is so high that the internalized nanoagents can be directly observed under a microscope without fluorescent labeling. Besides, in vivo experiments reveal that CNOCs-PEI-PEG can be used for photothermal/photoacoustic dual-modal imaging-guided photothermal therapy after intravenous administration. Furthermore, CNOCs-PEI-PEG can be efficiently cleared from the mouse body within a week, ensuring their excellent long-term biosafety. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the first example of using candle soot as raw material to prepare water-dispersible onion-like carbon nanomaterials for cancer theranostics is represented herein.",

Rapid, simple, and sensitive identification and assay for bacteria are greatly desired for clinical diagnosis and environmental monitoring. In this work, a commonly used antibiotic vancomycin (Van) was used to synthesize gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) by a simple one-pot reaction, and the resultant Van-coated Au NPs (denoted as Van-AuNPs) can selectively interact with Gram-positive bacteria and thus be used to differentiate Gram-positive bacteria from Gram-negative ones through the change of their red color. On this basis, Van-AuNPs-based visual colorimetric assay was established for Gram-positive bacteria. The detection limits of bare eyes for Gram-positive  S. aureus ,  M. luteus,  and  B. subtilis  are 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910 9 , 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910 9 , and 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910 9  cells/mL, respectively, according to the color of the spots on the test strip without the use of any microscopic devices. We also used this method to detect  S. aureus  in orange juice and tap water with excellent recoveries. Compared with conventional bacterial identification methods, this assay is rapid and easy, and is promising to be used as a rapid method for the identification and quantification of bacteria in clinics, environment, and fieldwork.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Carbon dots (CDs) are a type of metal-free fluorescent quantum dots and can be synthesized facilely and cost-effectively. In this work, we develop a one-pot solvothermal method to prepare a novel type of quaternized CDs using two commercial reagents (glycerol and dimethyloctadecyl[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propy]ammonium chloride, abbreviated as Si-QAC). The introduction of the long alkyl chain-containing quaternary ammonium compound Si-QAC endows the as-prepared CDs with the capability to interact with the negatively-charged bacterial cells via both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Owning to the different surfaces of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, the CDs can selectively interact with the Gram-positive bacteria. More interestingly, once the CDs are adsorbed onto the Gram-positive bacteria, their fluorescence emission is significantly enhanced. Furthermore, the CD adsorption can further cause the bacterial cell surface destruction since the CDs may change the charge balance of the bacterial surface and can insert into the bacterial surface via the long alkyl chains, which ultimately leads to the inactivation of Gram-positive bacteria. As compared with the conventional Gram-staining method, the CD-based Gram-type differentiation approach is accurate, fast, and easy-operating. Overall, the quaternized CDs represent a metal-free nanoparticle-based nanotheranostic for imaging-guided bacterial differentiation and inhibition.",

To improve the radiotherapeutic performance, developing nanoparticles that can efficiently generate toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) under X-ray irradiation are highly desirable. Here, we investigate the potential of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) as nanoradiosensitizers. Increased cancer cell inhibition is observed in colony formation assay and real-time cell analysis after the combined treatment with CuO NPs and X-ray irradiation, whereas the CuO NPs alone do not have any negative influence on cell viability, indicating the radiosensitization effect of CuO NPs. Importantly, the significantly increased ROS level in cells contributes to the enhanced damage to cancer cells under the combined treatment. Besides, the cell cycle is regulated to the X-ray-sensitive phase (G2/M phase) by CuO NPs, which may also account for the inhibited proliferation of cancer cells. Furthermore, results from...",

        "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRB) and their biofilms, both of which develop high levels of drug tolerance, cause severe threats to global health. This study demonstrates that biocompatible fluorescent silicon-containing nanodots can be a multifunctional platform for simultaneously imaging and eliminating MRB and their biofilms. Ultrasmall epoxy group (oxirane)-functionalized organosilica nanodots (OSiNDs) with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of \u224831% are synthesized via a simple one-step hydrothermal treatment of an epoxy group-containing silane molecule, 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, and an organic dye, rose bengal. The resultant OSiNDs can be employed as a universal imaging reagent for visualizing various bacteria/biofilms, including MRB and their biofilms. Moreover, the epoxy group-terminated OSiNDs can be conjugated with amine-containing reagents only via the simple stirring of the mixtures at an elevated temperature (e.g., 60 \u00b0C) for several hours (e.g., 3 h) without the addition of activating reagents. The amine-containing antibiotic vancomycin (Van) can thus be easily conjugated with the OSiNDs, and the obtained OSiNDs-Van can successfully inhibit the growth of MRB and even eliminate their biofilms. Collectively, the present work may give new impetus to the development of novel antibacterial and anti-biofilm agents for overcoming the drug resistance of bacteria.",

To compare to and validate our in situ experiments, molecular-level structures of the substrate/PHEMA interface before and after water exposure were also detected. The detected strong O\u2013H vibrational signals from water and hydroxyethyl and carbonyl vibrational signals from PHEMA prove that the PHEMA surface hydration was attributed to the interaction between water and PHEMA side hydrophilic groups.

        "abstract": "With the emergence of antibiotic resistance, developing new antibiotics and therapies for combating bacterial infections is urgently needed. Herein, a series of quaternized fluorescent silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) are facilely prepared by the covalent reaction between amine-functionalized SiNPs and carboxyl-containing N-alkyl betaines. It is found that the bactericidal efficacy of these quaternized SiNPs increases with the length of the N-alkyl chain, and SiNPs conjugated with N,N-dimethyl-N-octadecylbetaine (BS-18), abbreviated as SiNPs-C18, show the best antibacterial effect, whose minimum inhibitory concentrations for Gram-positive bacteria are 1\u20132 \u03bcg mL\u22121. In vivo tests further confirm that SiNPs-C18 have excellent antibacterial efficacy and greatly reduce bacterial load in the infectious sites. The SiNPs-C18 exhibit low cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells (including normal liver and lung cells, red blood cells, and macrophages), enabling them to be useful for clinical applications. Besides, the quaternized SiNPs exhibit polarity-dependent fluorescence emission property and can selectively image Gram-positive bacteria, thereby providing a simple method to successfully differentiate Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The present work represents the first example that successfully turns fluorescent SiNPs into metal-free NP-based antibiotics with simultaneous bacterial imaging and killing capability, which broadens the applications of fluorescent SiNPs and advances the development of novel antibacterial agents.",

The SnO 2  nanoparticles with ultra-small size are uniform decorated on the CGN framework, and Co element has been successful doping into SnO 2 . It is found that doping process does not affect the phase structure of SnO 2 , but great influence the morphology, the electrical conductivity, and the electrochemical properties on the composites. As a free-standing and binder-free anode for lithium-ions batteries, the discharge capacity of CGN/SnO 2 -Co have a high value of 549.6\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  (1996\u00a0\u03bcA\u00a0cm \u22122 ) after 100 cycles at a current density of 100\u00a0mA\u00a0g \u22121 , which is much higher than those of cotton covered by graphene/SnO 2  (CGN/SnO 2 ) and cotton covered by graphene/Co 3 O 4  (CGN/Co 3 O 4 ) at the same current. The improved performance of CGN/SnO 2 -Co can be attributed to the highly stable and conductive CGN framework, ultra-small size of SnO 2  nanoparticles, and Co doping effect. It is reasonable to believe that this work has a great potential improve the performance of energy storage devices.",

Herein, we design and fabricate a flexible and free-standing 3 D carbon/MoO 2  composite through a facile immersing method followed by an annealing process. The carbon framework is supported by non-woven cotton totally covered by graphene sheets. The nanosized MoO 2  particles were uniformly anchored on cotton fibers and graphene sheets. The structure has several advantages, such as an interconnected 3D electronically conductive network, plenty of channels for electrolyte solution cross, and more active points for the electrode reaction. Compared with cotton/MoO 2  (C/MoO 2 ) without graphene sheets, the CGN/MoO 2  composite (cotton covered by graphene/MoO 2 ) showed much better thermal stability and excellent cycling performance. The proposed synthesis process paves a new way as promising electrode materials for high power battery applications such as roll-up displays and wearable devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The three-dimensional carbonized cotton framework covered by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was uniformly decorated by the SnO 2  nanoparticles encapsulated by a layer of the amorphous carbon and was directly used in the anode materials for the lithium ion battery. The carbonized frameworks covered by rGO are interconnected and the pores are enriched, facilitating the diffusion of electron and releasing the strain of lithium ions insertion and extraction. The rGO sheets with better mechanical and foldable characterization increase the conductive and buffer the electrode expansion during the cycling process. Furthermore, the amorphous carbon coating effectively prevents the direct contact between the SnO 2  nanoparticles and the electrolyte, which can format a stable solid electrolyte interphase and greatly reduce the irreversible reaction. As a result, the capacity of composite is as high as 496.3\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u2212\u00a01  (1.72\u00a0mAh\u00a0cm \u2212\u00a02 ) after 200\u00a0cycles at current density of 100\u00a0mA\u00a0g \u2212\u00a01 , which means that the product as free-standing and binder-free electrode exhibits the stable cycle performance and will be a promising material for the application of lithium ion battery.",

The strikingly effective, reliable, and high-throughput (grams) synthesis is performed  via  a facile chemical foaming process at 1400\u00a0\u00b0C utilizing ammonia borane (AB) as precursor. The characterization results demonstrate that high quality of  h / t -BNNSs with lateral size of tens of micrometers and thickness of tens of nanometers are obtained. The growth mechanism of  h / t -BNNSs is also discussed based on the thermogravimetric analysis of AB which clearly shows two step weight loss. The  h / t -BNNSs are further used for making thermoconductive  h / t -BNNSs/epoxy resin composites. The thermal conductivity of the composites is obviously improved due to the introduction of  h / t -BNNSs. Consideration of the unique properties of boron nitride, these novel  h / t -BNNSs are envisaged to be very valuable for future high performance polymer based material fabrication.",

Herein, we synthesize a novel composites with carbonized cotton covered by graphene/SnO 2  (CGN/SnO 2 ), in which SnO 2  nano-particles grow in-situ on the cotton fibers covered with graphene oxide (CGO) under the following thermal annealing process. The conductivity of the composites and the sizes of the SnO 2  particles in the composites could be expediently adjusted by changing the thermal annealing temperatures. The as-prepared flexible CGN/SnO 2  composites can be directly used as an anode for lithium-ion batteries without the addition of conductive additive, binder and current collector. The CGN/SnO 2  composites prepared at 500\u00a0\u00b0C have exhibited a good reversible specific capacity (calculated by the weight of whole electrode) of 406\u00a0mAh\u00b7g \u2212\u00a01  (1.70\u00a0mAh\u00b7cm \u2212\u00a02 ) after 80\u00a0cycles.

        "abstract": "Abstract   SnO 2  is an appealing anode material for lithium ion batteries. Advantages of SnO 2  includes relatively low charge-discharge plateau and highly abundance in nature. However, the volume change (300%) is significant and critically impeding its cycle life. In this manuscript, we address these problems by exploiting an  in-situ  redox process to prepare graphene encapsulated SnO 2  nanoparticles using soluble Sn 2+  as the Sn precursor, which is oxidized to SnO 2  by using graphene oxide. This method affords graphene @ SnO 2  via oxygen bridging through of SnO 2  nanoparticles. Furthermore, this method incorporates Fe atom into the SnO 2  structure in-situ to create Fe x Sn 1-x O 2  structure, which exhibits higher Li storage capacity. Our synthetic approach delivers graphene encapsulated Fe x Sn 1-x O 2  structure, which is located on flexible carbonaceous fibers, and the whole system can be applied as lithium-ion batteries anode without any need of a current collector or binder polymer. This novel Sn based electrode could deliver a high capacity (calculate total electrode mass) of 454.3\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  after 200 cycles at 100\u00a0mA\u00a0g \u22121  (65.1% retention). Unlike most contemporary technologies, increasing the thickness of our Sn based electrode simply increases the capacity proportionally. The areal capacity is 1348.3\u00a0\u03bcAh\u00a0cm \u22122 , and it is simply doubled to 2856.1\u00a0\u03bcAh\u00a0cm \u22122  while we double the thickness of electrode.",

We report a simple process to prepare a three dimension structure composed of carbon and SnO2 nanoparticles (CGN/SnO2). The non-woven cotton covered with conducting graphene is selected as a flexible and bendable skeleton. Ultrasmall SnO2 nanoparticles with a size of several nanometers uniformly anchor on both the graphene sheets and cotton fibers. The CGN/SnO2 composites exhibited a higher Li-battery performance than carbonized cotton/SnO2 (C/SnO2) and carbonized cotton covered by glucose/SnO2 (CG/SnO2). Especially, the CGN/SnO2 composites after bending 1000 times can maintain the same lithium storage property as before. Combining with this unique flexible, bendable structure, and the outstanding electrical and electrochemical performance, we demonstrate the great potential of CGN/SnO2 composites in high performance Li-ion battery field and the flexible, foldable and stretchable conductors application.",

Ion implantation is often employed in SiC for doping, defect engineering and transferring of SiC thin films on different substrates. To transfer SiC or to get freestanding thin SiC films by \u201csmart-cut\u201d [Appl. Phys. Lett. 112 (2018) 192102], a large fluence of hydrogen (proton) ion implantation will be applied. Here, we show the structure and defect properties in 6H-SiC single crystals after hydrogen implantation up to a fluence of 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 16 \u202fcm \u22122  at different energies of ions. We present the characterization by Rutherford Backscattering/Channeling spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy and electron spin resonance. Upon H +  ion implantation, point defects are mainly created and cause the lattice vibration softening. Our analysis also suggests that H +  ion implantation induces less lattice disorder than heavy ions at fluences producing the same number of displacements per atom. We also discuss the possible nature of the point defects and their influence on the electrical properties.",

It is useful to investigate the influence of incident particle with various energies on radiation effects of BJTs. Radiation effects in bipolar junction transistors are examined under the irradiation with 10, 24 and 40\u00a0MeV Si ions in this paper. Based on the electrical performance degradation, it is shown that the change in the reciprocal of current gain is dominated by the ionizing damage during the heavy ion irradiations at low fluence, leading to a non-linear behavior. While at a higher fluence, displacement damage is the domain effect to show a linear curve. Deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) is used to analyze the characteristic of the deep level defects induced by irradiations. DLTS results show that for the BJTs under various Si ions irradiations, the types of deep level defects induced by Si ions are similar, while the concentration of the defects is different at the same displacement dose.",

In this paper, mutiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were incorporated into low density polyethylene (LDPE) with MWCNT loadings concentrations of 0.1\u00a0wt%. The structural evolution during uniaxial tensile deformation of the LDPE/0.1% MWCNT composites before and after 1\u00a0MeV electrons were investigated by means of a small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). Experimental results show that 1\u00a0MeV electrons obviously increase the ultimate tensile strength of the LDPE/MWCNT composites. From SAXS and WAXD analyses, it is shown that 1\u00a0MeV electrons inhibit the disintegration and the rotation of the lamellae, and slow down the formation of the new crystals. It is concluded that the intense interaction between MWCNTs and LDPE matrix and the crosslinking strengthening generated by 1\u00a0MeV electrons is the dominant reason for the changes of the deformation behaviors of LDPE.",

        "abstract": "Saturates, aromatics, resin, and C7 asphaltene (SARA) fractions of feedstock were analyzed systematically, and molecular models were constructed. The Monte Carlo method was utilized to investigate the intermolecular interactions between SARA fractions and the ligands absorbed on nickel sulfide nanocatalysts. Additionally, the structural characteristics of the hydrocracked products were analyzed by using elemental analysis, 1H\u2005NMR spectroscopy, and FTIR spectroscopy to study the effect of surface modification on the catalytic performances of nickel sulfide nanocatalysts. Simulation results reveal that oleic acid and 1-dodecanethiol have a better miscibility with aromatic fractions of residue than cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide and that oleic acid has a high affinity and selectivity to C7 asphaltene. Adsorption experiments show that nickel sulfide nanocatalysts modified with oleic acid and 1-dodecanethiol present a certain \u201ccore affinity\u201d in the diffusion of residue colloid, which leads to a higher catalyst concentration in C7 asphaltene than the average value in the feedstock. Subsequently, experimental data demonstrate that surface modification with oleic acid and 1-dodecanethiol enhances the catalytic activity of nickel sulfide nanocatalysts, which also facilitates the hydrogenation of C7 asphaltene. Furthermore, nickel sulfide nanocatalysts modified with oleic acid show the best hydrogenation and anticoke activity because of the affinity between oleic acid and C7 asphaltene.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Airborne inhalable particles are a potent environmental pollutant. Formed via industrial processes, separation of these particles is difficult using conventional clean up techniques. In this work, solid nuclei particles of different chemical compositions were introduced into an agglomeration chamber with simulated flue gases to investigate their ability to remove these particles. Organic nuclei were able to capture more inhalable particles from coal-derived fly ash than inorganic nuclei, though these proved more effective for the agglomeration of inhalable particles in refuse-derived fly ash. Increasing the diameter of the solid nuclei benefitted the agglomeration process for both types of ash. Varying the local humidity changed adhesion between the particles and encouraged them to aggregate. Increasing the relative humidity consistently increased particle agglomeration for the refuse-derived ash. For coal-derived fly ash, the removal efficiency increased initially with relative humidity but then further increases in humidity had no impact on the relatively high efficiencies. After agglomeration in an atmosphere of 62% relative humidity, the mean mass diameter of inhalable particles in the coal-derived fly ash increased from 3.3 to 9.2\u00a0\u03bcm. For refuse-derived fly ash, agglomeration caused the percentage of particles that were less than 2\u00a0\u03bcm to decrease from 40% to 15%. After treatment at a relative humidity of 61%, the mean size of inhalable particles exceeded 10\u00a0\u03bcm.",

These salts are then discharged to the effluent, leading to serious environmental problems. Biodegradable organic salts can alternatively be used in the dyeing process. In this paper, a new liquid organic salt was synthesized by acid-base neutralization, which was used to replace inorganic salts in reactive dyeing. Dye exhaustion in organic salt dyeing was similar to the values in conventional dyeing. However, dye fixations were slightly lower in organic salt dyeing than in conventional dyeing. The washing fastness of dyed fabrics with organic salt was excellent. Experimental results showed that dye exhaustion reached the maximum value when the concentration range of organic salt was from 20 g/l to 40 g/l. In addition, the optimal alkali concentration in organic salt dyeing was found to be about 30 g/l. These parameters suggested organic salt could replace inorganic salt in reactive dyeing process.",

        "abstract": "Wire-shaped supercapacitors (SCs) possessing light-weight, good flexibility and weavability have caught much attention, but it is still a challenge to extend the lifespan of the devices with gradual aging due to the rough usage or external factors. Herein, we report a new stretchable and selfhealable wire-shaped SC. In the typical process, two polyvinyl alcohol/potassium hydroxide (PVA/KOH) hydrogel wrapped with urchin-like NiCo2O4 nanomaterials were twisted together to form a complete SC devices. It is noted that the as-prepared PVA hydrogel can be easily stretched up to 300% with small tensile stress of 12.51 kPa, superior to nearly 350 kPa at 300% strain of the polyurethane. Moreover, the wire-like SCs exhibit excellent electrochemical performance with areal capacitance of 3.88 mF cm\u22122 at the current density of 0.053 mA cm\u22122, good cycling stability maintaining 88.23% after 1000 charge/discharge cycles, and 82.19% capacitance retention even after four damaging/healing cycles. These results indicate that wireshaped SCs with two twisted NiCo2O4 coated polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel fibers is a promising structure for achieving the goal of high stability and long-life time.

Experimental results reveal that the particle size and crystal structure of the NSNPs did not change significantly during the modification process. Different from the adsorption by the electrostatic attraction between the surfactant and NSNPs, oleic acid and 1-dodecanethiol are adsorbed firmly on the NSNPs through chemisorption. Catalytic hydrocracking tests demonstrate that the surface modification enhances the hydrocracking activity of the NSNPs. The surfactant-coated NSNPs disperse in toluene-insoluble products in as agglomerates of 20\u201330\u2005nm, whereas the modified NSNPs mainly disperse as their original size.

Experimental data indicated that the new acrylate grafting epoxy antifouling resins have a strong bonding to the cured epoxy resin coating through chemical reaction and self-stratifying. And the paint prepared by using the new resin as matrix has excellent self-polishing and antifouling properties.

        "abstract": "Energy-water nexus has substantially increased importance in the recent years. Synergistic approaches based on systems-analysis and mathematical models are critical for helping decision makers better understand the interrelationships and tradeoffs between energy and water. In energy-water nexus management, various decision makers with different goals and preferences, which are often conflicting, are involved. These decision makers may have different controlling power over the management objectives and the decisions. They make decisions sequentially from the upper level to the lower level, challenging decision making in energy-water nexus. In order to address such planning issues, a bi-level decision model is developed, which improves upon the existing studies by integration of bi-level programming into energy-water nexus management. The developed model represents a methodological contribution to the challenge of sequential decision-making in energy-water nexus through provision of an integrated modeling framework/tool. An interactive fuzzy optimization methodology is introduced to seek a satisfactory solution to meet the overall satisfaction of the two-level decision makers. The tradeoffs between the two-level decision makers in energy-water nexus management are effectively addressed and quantified. Application of the proposed model to a synthetic example problem has demonstrated its applicability in practical energy-water nexus management. Optimal solutions for electricity generation, fuel supply, water supply including groundwater, surface water and recycled water, capacity expansion of the power plants, and GHG emission control are generated. These analyses are capable of helping decision makers or stakeholders adjust their tolerances to make informed decisions to achieve the overall satisfaction of energy-water nexus management where bi-level sequential decision making process is involved.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Water, energy and food (WEF) are inextricably interrelated. Effective planning and management of limited WEF resources to meet current and future socioeconomic demands for sustainable development is challenging. WEF production/delivery may also produce environmental impacts; as a result, green-house-gas emission control will impact WEF nexus management as well. Nexus management for WEF security necessitates integrated tools for predictive analysis that are capable of identifying the tradeoffs among various sectors, generating cost-effective planning and management strategies and policies. To address these needs, we have developed an integrated model analysis framework and tool called WEFO. WEFO provides a multi-period socioeconomic model for predicting how to satisfy WEF demands based on model inputs representing productions costs, socioeconomic demands, and environmental controls. WEFO is applied to quantitatively analyze the interrelationships and trade-offs among system components including energy supply, electricity generation, water supply-demand, food production as well as mitigation of environmental impacts. WEFO is demonstrated to solve a hypothetical nexus management problem consistent with real-world management scenarios. Model parameters are analyzed using global sensitivity analysis and their effects on total system cost are quantified. The obtained results demonstrate how these types of analyses can be helpful for decision-makers and stakeholders to make cost-effective decisions for optimal WEF management.",

Systems-analysis based decision support is helpful for effective management of wastewater, and provision of cost-effective decision alternatives from a whole-system perspective. Uncertainties are inherent in many modeling parameters, affecting the generated decisions. In order to effectively deal with the recourse issue in decision making, in this work a two-stage stochastic fracturing wastewater management model, named TSWM, is developed to provide decision support for wastewater management planning in shale plays. Using the TSWM model, probabilistic and nonprobabilistic uncertainties are effectively handled. The TSWM model provides flexibility in generating shale gas wastewater management strategies, in which the first-stage decision predefined by decision makers before uncertainties are unfolded is corrected in the sec...",

The optimized lattice constants accord well with the experimental data. According to the calculated total energy of the three phases, the phase transition order is determined from \u03b1 to \u03b3 phase with cooling, which is in agreement with the experimental result. The physical properties such as elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Youngu0027s modulus, Poissonu0027s ratio, and anisotropy factor are also discussed and analyzed, which indicates that the three structures are mechanically stable and each has a ductile feature. The Debye temperature is deduced from the elastic properties. The total density of states (TDOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) of the three phases are investigated. The TDOS results show that the \u03b3 phase is most stable with a pseudogap near the Fermi level, and the PDOS analysis indicates that the conduction band of the three phases is composed mostly of Mg-3s, Ag-4d, and Sb-5p. In addition, the changes of the free energy, entropy, specific heat, thermal expansion of \u03b3-MgAgSb with temperature are obtained successfully. The obtained results above are important parameters for further experimental and theoretical tuning of doped MgAgSb as a thermoelectric material at high temperature.",

        "abstract": "On the basis of first-principles calculations, the ability of a single-wall MoS2 nanotube to detect NO, NO2, CO, SO2, and NH3 gas molecules is studied. The most stable adsorption configurations, adsorption energies, and charge transfers are calculated. Among these gas molecules, the NO molecule has the biggest interaction with the MoS2 nanotube. The adsorption energy of NO on the nanotube is 129.3 meV, which is almost double compared to that for the monolayer (74.4 meV). The charge density difference calculation shows that all the molecules on the MoS2 nanotube act as electron acceptors except NH3. The charge transfer between NO and the nanotube is still one order of magnitude higher than that for the monolayer. Compared with the results for these molecules adsorbed on the MoS2 monolayer, the nanotube is more sensitive, especially for the NO molecule. Moreover, a comparative study of MoS2 nanotubes with different diameters (curvatures) indicates that the NO adsorption capability of the outer surface decreases on the increasing radius. It is predicted that the MoS2 nanotube with a smaller diameter should increase the stability and sensitivity of MoS2-based field-effect-transistor (FET) sensors.",

Our calculated results indicate that the synergistic effect of (Fe\u00a0+\u00a0Ni) codoping can lead to a band gap narrowing and the hybridized states of Fe 3 d  and Ni 3 d  appearing in the forbidden gap, which enhances greatly the optical absorption of TiO 2  nanomaterials from the ultraviolet-light to the infrared-light region and reduces the recombination of photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs. In particular, (Fe\u00a0+\u00a0Ni) codoping can improve greatly the infrared-light absorption of TiO 2  nanomaterials. Furthermore, the researches of electronegativity show that (Fe\u00a0+\u00a0Ni)-codoped TiO 2  system has a stronger redox power for hydrogen generation by photocatalytic water splitting compared with pure, Fe-doped, and Ni-doped TiO 2  systems.

        "abstract": "Abstract   The electronic and optical properties of both substitutional and interstitial N-doped, La-doped and N-La co-doped rutile TiO 2  have been investigated systematically by the spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. In substitutional La-N co-doped system, an N 2 p  impurity state appears in the forbidden gap and has improved the visible light absorption performance by reducing the transition energy. Interstitial La-N co-doping induces several impurity states which helps transfer electrons from valance band maximum to conduction band minimum and an obvious lattice distortion which reduces the recombination of electrons and holes. When the dopant concentration increases or the distance between two dopants shortens, the interaction between dopants will be strengthened, which leads to a better visible-light absorption.",

The calculated results show that the magnetic properties of monolayer MoS2 can be tuned by changing the distribution of the G8 atom and S vacancy. The S vacancy tends to decrease the net magnetic moment of the doped system when these two defects are in their closest configuration. By adjusting the distance between the dopant and the S vacancy, the doped MoS2 monolayer may show a variable net magnetic moment. In particular, all of the Ni-doped MoS2 monolayers show zero magnetic moment with or without an S vacancy. The mean-field approximation is used to estimate the Curie temperature (TC). Our results show that Fe, Co, Ru, Rh, Os and Ir-doped MoS2 monolayers are potential candidates for ferromagnetism above room temperature. The density of states calculations provide further explanations as to the magnetic behavior of these doped systems. These results provide a new route for the potential application of atomically thin dilute magnetic semiconductors in spintronic devices by employing monolayer MoS2.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The electronic and optical properties of g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2  heterostructure are investigated using spin-polarized DFT+ U  calculations. The equilibrium spacing (1.94\u00a0A) and binding energy (24 meV/A 2 ) show that g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2  is a van der Waals heterostructure. And the calculated band gap of g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2  is significantly reduced compared with TiO 2 . Therefore, the visible light response of g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2  heterostructure is remarkably improved. Besides, the predicted type II band alignment would ensure that the electrons can migrate from g-C 3 N 4  monolayer to anatase TiO 2  (101) surface, which leads oxidation and redox reactions can occur on g-C 3 N 4  and TiO 2 , respectively. Finally, a built-in electric field within the interface region will be set. Above processes can benefit the separation of photoexcited carriers and enhance the hydrogen-evolution activity. In addition, compared with TiO 2 , g-C 3 N 4 /TiO 2  with higher conduction band minimum energy can effectively produce higher-energy electrons to reduce hydrogen ions. Moreover, the influence of composite distance and the number of g-C 3 N 4  layers are also investigated systematically. The results indicate that the optical absorption is enhanced over the whole spectrum with the increase of the number of g-C 3 N 4  layers. Similar visible light enhancing is also found when the composite distance is decreased.",

Energy and exergy analysis was applied to a quasi-dimensional two-zone SI engine model, including Wiebe function to model the actual combustion process based on fuel types and operating conditions. Results were obtained for an SI engine at 3000 rpm by changing spark timing, volume fraction of n-butanol, and load. When sweeping spark timing, it was found that the location of maximum first and second-law efficiency appear at around \u221231 \u00b0CA ATDC for iso-octane, BU10, BU20 and BU30, and approximately \u221228 \u00b0CA ATDC for n-butanol. Increasing butanol fraction in the blends increases the percentage of total irreversibility in total availability at either MBT or constant spark timing, while has slight influence on availability transferred by heat transfer. At the MBT spark timing and WOT condition, the first-law efficiency increases slightly with increase of n-butanol, while the second-law efficiency for blended fuel decreases slightly. However, with decreasing engine load, the percentages of total irreversibility and availability transferred by heat transfer increase, the first and second-law efficiencies both decrease.",

Using iso-octane as gasoline surrogate, the entropy production and exergy balance of n-butanol and iso-octane constant volume combustion process were analysed with the CHEMKIN software by considering detailed n-butanol and iso-octane chemical reaction mechanisms. The results of exergy balance analysis showed that, during the adiabatic constant-volume combustion process, there is a trade-off between exergy destruction and exergy loss due to incomplete combustion. The exergy destruction of n-butanol is obviously higher than that of iso-octane. The results of entropy generation analysis showed that, with high initial temperature, two apparent peaks of heat release rate and exergy loss rate are observed both for iso-octane and n-butanol.

A detailed energy and exergy analysis is applied to a quasi-dimensional two-zone spark ignition engine model which combines turbulence flame propagation speed model at 1500\u00a0rpm by changing gas fuel types, compression ratio, load and ignition timing. It was found that the irreversibility of methane is the maximum and that of syngas is the minimum among the three different fuels. The irreversibility in the combustion process of a coke oven gas fueled SI engine is reduced when the compression ratio or the throttle valve opening angle is increased and the ignition timing is delayed. Increasing the compression ratio and delaying the ignition timing can improve the first and second law efficiency and reduce the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC). The power performance and fuel economy are good and the energy is also used effectively when the compression ratio is 11, the throttle angle is 90% and the ignition time is \u221210\u00b0 CA ATDC respectively.",

The proposed combined reduction approach successfully reduced the detailed n-butanol mechanism (326 species and 1884 reactions) to a reduced mechanism containing 75 species and 285 reactions. Extensive validations were performed by comparing experimental data of shock tube ignition delay times, jet-stirred reactor (JSR) species profiles, laminar flame speed and premixed laminar flame species profiles with modeled results. The reduced mechanism was also validated by comparing with the detailed mechanism in a single-zone engine model. High accuracy is demonstrated in wide ranges of temperature ( T \u00a0=\u00a0700\u20131500\u00a0K), pressure ( p \u00a0=\u00a01\u201380\u00a0bar), and equivalence ratio ( \u03a6 \u00a0=\u00a00.5\u20132.0), which indicated that the present n-butanol reduced mechanism can well predict the experimental data.",

        "abstract": "Over the last decade, object-based image classification (OBIC) has become a mainstream method in remote sensing land-use/land-cover applications. Many supervised classification methods have been proposed in the OBIC framework. However, most did not use deep learning methods. In this paper, a new deep-learning-based OBIC framework is introduced. First, we segment the original image into objects by graph-based minimal-spanning-tree segmentation algorithm. Second, we extract the spectral, spatial, and texture features for each object. Then we put all features into stacked autoencoders (SAE) or stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAE) network, and trained the parameters of the network using training samples. Finally, all objects were classified by the network. Based on our SAE/SDAE OBIC framework, we achieved 97% overall accuracy when classifying an UAV image into five categories. In addition, our experiment shows that our framework increases overall accuracy by approximately 6% when compared to the linear support vector machine (linear SVM) and radial basis function kernel support vector machine (RBF SVM) algorithms when sufficient training samples are lacking.",

However, most of classification methods in OBIC are dealing with 1D hand-crafted features extracted from segmented image objects (superpixels). To extract 2D deep features of superpixels, a new deep OBIC framework is introduced in this letter by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We first analyze the different mask policies of superpixels and design two architectures of networks. Then, we determine the specific details of our framework before experiments.

The advent of high-resolution remote sensing images has greatly increased our ability to monitor land use and land cover changes from space. At the same time, high-resolution remote sensing images present a new challenge over other satellite systems, in which time-consuming and tiresome manual procedures must be needed to identify the land use and land cover changes. In recent years, deep learning (DL) has been widely used in the fields of natural image target detection, speech recognition, face recognition, etc., and has achieved great success. Some scholars have applied DL to remote sensing image classification and change detection, but seldomly to high-resolution remote sensing images change detection.

Systematic screening of 1255 microRNAs (miRNAs) identified miR-30a as a synthetic lethal in KRAS-mutant CRC cells. miR-30a was downregulated in CRCs and repressed by P65. miR-30a directly targeted malic enzyme 1 (ME1) and KRAS, and inhibited anchorage-independent growth and in vivo tumorigenesis by KRAS-mutant CRC cells. ME1 was significantly upregulated in KRAS-mutant CRCs. Eliminating ME1 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) resulted in obviously decreased NADPH production, levels of triglyceride and fatty acid, and an inhibition of tumorigenicity of KRAS-mutant CRCs. miR-30a overexpression and ME1 suppression attenuated AOM/DSS-induced colorectal tumorigenesis. The critical roles of miR-30a and ME1 in the development of KRAS-mutant CRCs indicate therapy potentials for this subtype of cancer.",

        "abstract": "The cellular size and biomass of picophytoplankton were studied by flow cytometer during spring monsoon (March-May of 2015) in equatorial eastern Indian Ocean. We established an empirical relationship between forward scatter and cellular size to address the size and biomass of picophytoplankton. Results indicated that mean cell diameter of Prochlorococcus (0.60\u00a0\u03bcm) was the smallest, and then followed by Synechococcus (0.98\u00a0\u03bcm) and picoeukaryotic phytoplankton (1.05\u00a0\u03bcm). Thereafter, the biomass converted by abundance reached 0.64\u00a0\u03bcg\u00b7C\u00b7L for Prochlorococcus, 0.34\u00a0\u03bcg\u00b7C\u00b7L for Synechococcus, and 0.20\u00a0\u03bcg\u00b7C\u00b7L for picoeukaryotic phytoplankton. Additionally, the distinct biomass contribution of picophytoplankton appeared to be affected by abundance, but not changes in cellular size. Vertically, the cellular sizes of picophytoplankton were remarkably small in upper waters, which was predominantly controlled by the nutrient availability. In contrast, they were larger in deeper waters, which was primarily attributed to the combined effects of low temperature and reduced light availability. Spatially, under the influence of high nutrient concentration induced by the different circulations and coastal upwelling, slightly high carbon biomass of picophytoplankton was observed around the coastal zones of Sri Lanka island and Sumatra, as well as the southern Bay of Bengal.",

The coccolithophore community was dominated by Gephyrocapsa oceanica, Emiliania huxleyi, Florisphaera profunda, Umbilicosphaera sibogae, and Helicosphaera carteri. The abundance of coccoliths and coccospheres ranged from 0.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910 to 160\u2009\u00d7\u200910 coccoliths l and 0.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910 to 68\u2009\u00d7\u200910 cells l, averaged 23\u2009\u00d7\u200910 coccoliths l and 9.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910 cells l, respectively.

Vertically, the great majority of coccoliths and coccospheres were concentrated in water taken from depths of <75\u2009m. The ratios between the number of coccospheres and free coccoliths indicated that coccoliths experience different levels of dissolution when transported to deep water. Abundant coccolithophores mainly occurred at the west of 90\u00b0E, which is in accordance with the presence of Wyrtki jets.

        "abstract": "Ammonia-oxidizing Archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing Bacteria (AOB) oxidize ammonia to nitrite, and therefore play essential roles in nitrification and global nitrogen cycling. To better understand the population structure and the distribution of AOA and AOB in the deep Eastern Indian Ocean (EIO), nine surface sediment samples (>3,300 m depth) were collected during the inter-monsoon Spring 2013. One sediment sample from the South China Sea (SCS; 2,510 m) was also included for comparison. The community composition, species richness, and diversity were characterized by clone libraries (total 1,238 clones), and higher diversity of archaeal A genes than bacterial A genes was observed in all analyzed samples. Real time qPCR analysis also demonstrated higher abundances (gene copy numbers) of archaeal A genes than bacterial A genes, and the ratios of AOA/AOB ranged from 1.42 to 8.49 among sites. In addition, unique and distinct clades were found in both reconstructed AOA and AOB phylogeny, suggesting the presence of niche-specific ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in the EIO. The distribution pattern of both archaeal and bacterial A genes revealed by NMDS (non-metric multidimensional scaling) showed a distinct geographic separation of the sample from the SCS and most of the samples from the EIO following nitrogen gradients. Higher abundance and diversity of archaeal A genes indicated that AOA may play a more important role than AOB in the deep Indian Ocean. Environmental parameters shaping the distribution pattern of AOA were different from that of AOB, indicating distinct metabolic characteristics and/or adaptation mechanisms between AOA and AOB in the EIO, especially in deep-sea environments.",

        "abstract": "To better understand the physicochemical conditions in affecting regional distribution of phytoplankton community, one research cruise was carried out in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea during 3rd and 23th May, 2010. The phytoplankton community, including Bacillariophyta (105 taxa), Pyrrophyta (54 taxa), Chrysophyta (1 taxon) and Chlorophyta (2 taxa), had been identified and clearly described from six ecological provinces. And, the six ecological provinces were partitioned based on the top twenty dominant species related with notable physicochemical parameters. In general, the regional distributions of phytoplankton ecological provinces were predominantly influenced by the physicochemical properties induced by the variable water masses and circulations. The predominant diatoms in most of water samples showed well adaptability in turbulent and eutrophic conditions. However, several species of dinoflagellates e.g., Protoperidinium conicum, Protoperidinium triestinum, Protoperidinium sp. and Gymnodinium lohmanni preferred warmer, saltier and nutrient-poor environment. Moreover, the dinoflagellates with high frequency in the Yellow Sea might be transported from the Yellow Sea Warm Current. The horizontal distribution of phytoplankton was depicted by diatoms and controlled by phosphate concentration, while the vertical distribution was mainly supported by light and nutrients availability in the subsurface and bottom layers, respectively.",

While, their distributions in the Eastern Indian Ocean (EIO) still remain unknown. This study investigated the diversity and abundance of anammox bacteria from water column (0\u20132000 m with seven depths) down to the surface sediments in the EIO targeting 16S rRNA gene by using clone library and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis. Results showed a wide distribution of anammox bacteria in both water column and sediments in the EIO, with the  Candidatus  Scalindua sp. assemblage as the predominant group among the anammox communities. The diversity of anammox bacteria was higher in water column, but abundances (based on copy numbers of 16S rRNA gene) were lower than the corresponding sediment samples. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis demonstrated distinct spatial patterns (both horizontal and vertical): samples from the Bay of Bengal and the Equator showed strong stratification in different layers and were distinct from other two regions. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that dissolved oxygen, temperature, and nitrate were the major environmental factors shaping the distribution of anammox bacteria. This is the first investigation on detailed community structure and distribution of anammox bacteria in the EIO, and the results are consistent with (i) potential contribution of sedimentary anammox bacteria towards nitrogen removal, and (ii) dispersal of anammox bacteria diversity via the ocean.",

        "abstract": "Tintinnid community structure was investigated by plankton net (20 mu m) sampling in the water column (0-200 m) at 33 stations during the spring inter-monsoon (10 March to 9 April 2012) in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean. A total of 126 species belonging to 32 genera were recorded. Tintinnid abundance and biomass in the range of 193-2983 ind. m(-3) and 0.99-14.75 mu g C m(-3) were positively related to integrated chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration. Taxonomic and morphological diversity were not significantly related to integrated chl a concentration and size diversity, estimated by size-fractionated chl a concentration in the water column of 0-200 m, but were negatively correlated to the depth of the deep chlorophyll maximum. Species abundance distributions at most stations (31 of 33) and in the 3 zones-the northern zone of the equator, the southern zone of the equator (SEQ) and the equator (EQ)-followed a typical lognormal distribution. The geometric distribution gave the best fit for the distribution of lorica oral diameter size-classes in the NEQ and SEQ. Our results suggest that the community structure of tintinnids is governed by the underlying water column environment rather than by the neutral theory of random colonization from a large species pool.",

        "abstract": "The transient mesophyll protoplast expression system has become a powerful tool for rapid gene functional analysis, and it has been used successfully in several plant species, including model plants Arabidopsis and rice, but not in rubber tree. In this study, we describe an improved method to isolate high quality rubber tree mesophyll protoplasts. The transient expression of exogenous DNA constructs in this mesophyll protoplast system was observed by using green fluorescent protein, and was detected by immunoblot. Furthermore, we used two typical pathogen-associated molecular patterns flg22 and chitin from bacteria and fungi, respectively, as inducers of plant innate immunity responses to detect the immunity response of rubber tree. Our data showed that flg22 and chitin induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, generation and accumulation of reactive oxygen species, and transcription of defense genes. Our study demonstrated that the rubber tree mesophyll protoplast system can be used for functional analysis of immune responses of rubber tree and the dissection of cell signaling pathways. This transient mesophyll protoplast system may be applied to analyse gene function of rubber tree, a perennial plant for which the applicable transformation system was limited.",

        "abstract": "The gibberellic acid-stimulated arabidopsis (GASA) peptide family widely existed in plant species and plays various functions in regulating biological processes. Based on the transcriptome and the genome of the rubber tree, 16 genes encoding the GASA proteins were identified in Hevea brasiliensis. The phylogenetic relationship of the 16 GASA proteins of H. brasiliensis was analyzed by comparing with that of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. Transcriptional assay showed that the GASA genes were regulated by the fungal pathogens Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana revealed that the GASA genes were involved in generating reactive oxygen species, indicating their roles in plant innate immunity. In addition, the quantitative real-time PCR assays suggested that the GASA genes were regulated by plant hormone in complex ways. Taken together, the present study provides the comprehensive analysis and reveals putative roles of GASA genes in fungal pathogen resistance in H. brasiliensis.",

The results of catalyst characterization using XRD, SEM and CO 2 -TPD techniques indicate that the Fe load has a significantly influence on the composition, particle size, alkalinity and CO 2  adsorption capacity of resulting Fe/Ca x O materials. As catalysts, the selectivity of H 2  was increased and the selectivity of CO was reduced with increasing Fe load. The highest gasification yield of 48.3\u00a0wt.%, H 2  yield of 37.48\u00a0vol.% and H 2 /CO ratio of 1.36 were obtained at an optimized composition of Ca/Fe\u00a0=\u00a02/1, with the gasification efficiency as high as 76.4%. GC\u2013MS analysis of the condensable tar indicated that the as-synthesized Fe/Ca x O catalysts were capable for selective phenolics production from biomass gasification, with the maximum phenolics yield as high as 90.06%. Moreover, based on the results of structure characteristics and catalytic activities, a synergistic catalytic mechanism was proposed that the Ca 2 Fe 2 O 5  and Fe 3 O 4  formed by partial reduction of Ca 2 Fe 2 O 5  during biomass gasification are the main active site for catalytic cracking of tar, which can be further promoted by the in-situ CO 2  absorption of CaO.",

It was found that the Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrated better activity in the conversion of oxygenates and formation of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) than the ZSM-5 catalyst. Furthermore, for catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass with Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst, the yields of aromatic hydrocarbons were significantly increased with the rise of temperature from 500\u00a0\u00b0C to 600\u00a0\u00b0C, and then decreased with the increase of temperature from 600\u00a0\u00b0C to 800\u00a0\u00b0C. Based on the results of catalyst characterization and activity experiments, it seems that the Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst maintained the structure of ZSM-5, and the incorporation of Fe into ZSM-5 zeolites contributed to the formation of MAHs and simultaneously hindered the further polymerization reaction of MAHs and other oxygenates.",

Because of the lack of an effective disposal method, oil sludge has caused severe environmental pollution and issues. Pyrolysis is one of the effective and environmentally friendly ways for oil sludge reduction and energy recovery. In the present work, the fast pyrolysis of oil sludge and product distribution were investigated using the PY-GC/MS detection technique. The results indicated that the cracking of oil sludge increased, and heavy hydrocarbon products were increasingly decomposed into light hydrocarbons with increasing temperature. CaO and NiO catalysts effectively promoted the deep transformation of the products. In particular, NiO was able to increase the conversion of aromatic products significantly. This work clearly demonstrated that the catalysts have profound effects on the fast pyrolysis of oil sludge into light hydrocarbons.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A series of Ni/CaO catalysts with different ratios of Ni content were prepared by using an isovolumetric impregnation method. The performance of Ni/CaO catalysts on cyclic CO 2  absorption and catalytic pyrolysis of herb residues was investigated by using a thermogravimetry and differential thermal analyzer (TG-DTA) and a fixed micro-bed pyrolysis reactor system. The results of cyclic absorption experiments using Ni/CaO catalysts with different ratios of Ni content showed that the CO 2  absorption capability of CaO decreased rapidly with increasing number of cycle, and the addition of Ni increased the anti-deactivation capability of CaO in cyclic CO 2  absorption. Among the catalysts, the absorption rate of 10% (wt) Ni/CaO was up to 0.7 in the eighth cycle, which was 22.8% higher than that of pure CaO. The analysis of the catalytic pyrolysis products of herb residues indicated that the addition of CaO and 10% (wt) Ni/CaO resulted in effective removal of CO 2  in the gaseous products, significant increase in the lower heating value (LHV), and reduction in the yield of condensable liquids such as tar. Compared with CaO, the addition of Ni increased effective gases production and the heating value of the gaseous product and further decreased the yield of condensable liquids. Under the conditions of 700\u202f\u00b0C, 10% (wt) Ni/CaO catalyzed pyrolysis of herbal residues yielded an effective gas production of 325.3\u202fmL/g and the lower heating value of 18.6\u202fMJ/m 3 .",

In this work, CaO catalyst was used to catalyze the pyrolysis of herb residues to produce biobased gas. The mechanism of biomass pyrolysis with in-situ CO 2  capture was studied by experimental investigation and thermodynamic simulation. The results of the thermogravimetric and infrared analysis showed that CaO could promote biomass pyrolysis, water gas shift reaction, methanation reaction, and macromolecular transformation, thus significantly improving the quality of catalytic cracking gas. The further mechanistic study indicated that in-situ CO 2  capture promoted by CaO relieved the thermodynamic constraints of methanation at high temperature and achieved a high CH 4  selectivity in the temperature range of biomass pyrolysis and tar catalytic cracking, which is consistent with the result of the thermodynamic analysis. Mechanistically, CaO promotes the water gas shift reaction by absorbing CO 2 , reduces the volume contents of CO 2  and CO in gas and improves H 2  and CH 4  concentration to afford high-quality gas.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In the present study, we studied the hydrogen-rich gas production from catalytic pyrolysis of sawdust using various Fe-based catalysts derived from layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursor in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor. Specifically, we investigated the effect of support characteristics (Fe\u2013Mg, Fe\u2013Ca and Fe\u2013Al) on the physicochemical properties and catalytic performances in relation to hydrogen production and coke formation. Various characterization techniques, such as XRD, SEM, BET, H 2 -TPR and TG-DTG temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), were employed to thoroughly characterize the fresh and reacted Fe-based catalysts. It revealed that the support characteristics played an important role in determining the iron species form, textural properties and catalytic abilities of the resulting catalysts. The Al-supported Fe-based catalyst was found to be the most effective catalyst for hydrogen-rich gas production with the highest gaseous efficiency of 61.4\u2009wt.%, gas yield of 598\u2009mL/g biomass, H 2  yield of 217\u2009mL/g biomass, and H 2 /CO molar ratio of 2.5 at 700 \u00b0C. Based on the results of structural characteristics, this might be attributed to its fine particle, enhanced reducibility, high surface area and generation of surface acidity by introduction of Al form, which could provide efficient active sites for pyrolysis volatiles to crack and reform through a series of catalytic reactions. According to GC\u2013MS experiment results, the Fe\u2013Al catalyst was capable of selectively producing aromatic compounds, with the maximum yield as high as almost 100%. Therefore, the Fe\u2013Al catalyst developed in this work could provide a promising route for hydrogen-rich gas production from catalytic pyrolysis of biomass.",

Specifically, the effects of catalyst calcination temperature and catalytic bed temperature on the composition and yield of syngas were investigated. Various characterization techniques such as XRD, SEM, BET, H 2 -TPR and CO 2 -TPD were employed to thoroughly characterize the Fe/CaO catalysts both before and after the catalytic reaction. It was found that the catalyst synthesized at a mild temperature of 600\u00a0\u00b0C performed the best in producing hydrogen-enriched syngas, probably because of its uniform morphology, smaller particle size, superior reducibility and stronger CO 2  absorption ability. In addition, higher temperature was found to benefit the syngas production due to the acceleration of reaction rate and promotion of secondary cracking and reforming reactions of heavy organic molecules with the maximum syngas yield of 63.0\u00a0wt.% and H 2  yield of 172\u00a0mL/g biomass obtained at catalytic temperature of 800\u00a0\u00b0C using Fe/CaO catalyst calcined at 600\u00a0\u00b0C. Nevertheless, the H 2 /CO ratio was only at a suboptimal level of 0.99 because the decomposition of CaCO 3  at higher catalytic temperature released CO 2  and suppressed the water gas shift reaction to produce more H 2 .",

        "abstract": "Abstract   As a sedimentary rock composed of organic carbonaceous matters with different molecular sizes and inorganic minerals, coal can be extracted by organic solvents and dissolved by acids to make chemical compositions and structures changed, thus influencing on the occurrence and migration of coalbed methane (CBM). For the purpose of investigating the impacts of different solvents on coal structure, semi-anthracite coal samples from Huoerxinhe coalmine in the central part of Qinshui Basin were treated by four single solvents (tetrahydrofuran (THF), carbon disulfide (CS 2 ), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and chlorine dioxide (ClO 2 )), and by combined solvents (an organic solvent and an inorganic solvent with different treatment orders). Then the solubility behaviors of the organic compounds or inorganic matters from coal were investigated and the changes of the functional groups and the microcrystalline structure in coal were addressed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results show the extraction yields of organic solvents are significantly greater than the dissolution yields of inorganic solvents, and the solubility of HCl is relatively higher than that of ClO 2 . Specifically, main functional groups in coal, including aliphatic, aromatic and oxygen-containing functional groups, have a decline tendency to different degrees under the treatment of organic solvents. Further, main microcrystalline structure parameters increase in vertical direction but reduce in parallel direction of the aromatic carbon network layer with the swelling effect, regardless of an organic solvent or inorganic solvent treatment. Only by the organic solvent treatment, do the  d  002  values of the basic structure unit of coal appear dramatically enlarged characteristics. Whereas, main functional groups and microcrystalline structure in coal show relatively complex features within the combined solvents treatment because of the phenomenon of pore-blockade, pore-expansion or slight solvent retention. Based on the change characteristics and mechanisms, the chemical structure model of semi-anthracite coal is put forward for providing a reference for the further study of coal structure.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Coal is a porous medium with fractal characteristics. With the removal of soluble fractions under solvent treatment, the structures and fractal characteristics of pores are bound to produce changes. Exampled by low volatile bituminous coals with different degrees of deformation from Huoerxinhe and Changcun coal mines in Qinshui basin, North China, the paper investigated on the changes of pore structure parameters and minerals compositions of coals before and after different solvents treatments, including tetrahydrofuran (THF), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and chlorine dioxide (ClO 2 ). And Insight into the relationships between fractal dimensions and pore structure parameters and coal compositions were provided. Results show that: The shapes of N 2  adsorption/desorption isotherms rarely change but their adsorption quantities differ sharply after different solvents treatments for coal with same deformation, indicating no change in pore type but a change in the number of pore in the same pore size. Compared to raw coals, with the removal of soluble fractions in coals pore volume (PV) and specific surface area (SSA) tend to ascend after THF extraction; changes in PV and SSA depend jointly on the dissolution of carbonate minerals and the swelling of clay minerals after HCl treatment; and the varieties of PV and SSA, to a great extent, are closely related to the swelling of clay minerals after ClO 2  treatment. Pore structure fractal dimension (D A ) and surface fractal dimension (D B ) are obtained based on Frenkel-Halsey-Hill model. D A  is mainly affected by the proportion of transitional pores and mesopores on PV; therefore, D A  can be used to describe pore volumetric roughness of these transitional pores and mesopores. Meanwhile, D B  is mainly influenced by the proportion of micropores on SSA; therefore, D B  can be utilized to represent pore surface roughness of these micropores. As coal deformation increases, D A  grows for raw coals and coals after extraction with THF; therefore, PV has a significant migration to the pores of small apertures causing the growing contribution of micropores to PV. However, D A  declines for coals treated by HCl and ClO 2 , potentially because the welling of clay minerals blocks the pores of small apertures and increase the proportion of the pores of large apertures on PV. D B  shows no clear trends with increasing coal deformation. A \u201creversed U-shaped\u201d curve relationship is observed between moisture in coal and two fractal dimensions, which is due to the effect of water molecule interfacial tension. Ash correlates negatively with D A  and positively with D B  because of the various influences of minerals on pore homogeneity in pores of different apertures.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Coalbed methane (CBM) as an environmentally clean energy resource, its origin and geochemistry characteristics play critical roles for the exploration and development of CBM resource. In this paper, the carbon isotopic distribution laws and the geochemistry mechanisms of CBM were analyzed in the No. 3 coal seam of Permian Shanxi Formation and the No. 15 coal seam of Late Carboniferous Taiyuan Formation, central-southern part of Qinshui basin, China. The research results revealed that the \u03b4 13 C 1  values of the No. 3 coal seam distribute between \u221247.3\u2030 and \u221226.5\u2030 (average \u221236.4\u2030), which are generally larger than those of the No. 15 coal seam that range from \u221248.6\u2030 to \u221227.5\u2030 (average \u221238.3\u2030). As a whole, the \u03b4 13 C 1  values of CBM in the two coal seams show a gradually decreasing tendency from southeast to northwest. Then, due to the greater generation and the higher adsorption capacity of  13 CH 4  in the high rank coal, the \u03b4 13 C 1  values show a strongly positive correlation with the thermal evolution degree. The gas content and burial depth also have positive correlations with the \u03b4 13 C 1  values, but the hydrodynamic activity presents a negative relationship along with the \u03b4 13 C 1  values. Actually the burial depth, geological structure and hydrodynamic activity influence the distribution of CBM carbon isotopes by affecting the gas content. Moreover, there also exists an obvious fractionation phenomenon for CBM carbon isotopes under the post-reformation effects. On the one hand, owing to the preference for  13 CH 4  adsorption and postponement for  13 CH 4  desorption in the coal reservoir, the desorption-diffusion-migration effect that occurs during tectonic evolution contributes a weak \u201cvertical zone\u201d characteristic. On the other hand, the lateral groundwater circulation and the vertical thermal fluid circulation under an abnormally paleo geotemperature field have a good effect on  13 CH 4  dissolution. Finally it concluded that the geological period from the Late Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous is a crucial stage in causing this fractionation phenomenon and determining the thermal evolution feature and gas-bearing property, thus forming the current distribution of CBM reservoir and geochemistry characteristics in the central-southern Qinshui basin.",

        "abstract": "The physical characteristics of coal reservoirs are important for evaluating the potential for gas desorption, diffusion, and seepage during coalbed methane (CBM) production, and influence the performance of CBM wells. Based on data from mercury injection experiments, low-temperature liquid nitrogen adsorption, isothermal adsorption, initial velocity tests of methane diffusion, and gas natural desorption data from a CBM field, herein the physical characteristics of reservoirs of high-rank coals with different coal-body structures are described, including porosity, adsorption/desorption, diffusion, and seepage. Geometric models are constructed for these reservoirs. The modes of diffusion are discussed and a comprehensive diffusion-seepage model is constructed. The following conclusions were obtained. First, the pore distribution of tectonically deformed coal is different from that of normal coal. Compared to normal coal, all types of pore, including micropores ( 1000 nm), are more abundant in tectonically deformed coal, especially mesopores and macropores. The increase in pore abundance is greater with increasing tectonic deformation of coal; in addition, the pore connectivity is altered. These are the key factors causing differences in other reservoir physical characteristics, such as adsorption/desorption and diffusion in coals with different coal-body structures. Second, normal and cataclastic coals mainly contain micropores. The lack of macropores and its bad connectivity limit gas desorption and diffusion during the early stage of CBM production. However, the good connectivity of micropores is favorable for gas desorption and diffusion in later gas production stage. Thus, because of the slow decline in the rate of gas desorption, long-term gas production can easily be obtained from these reservoirs. Third, under natural conditions the adsorption/desorption properties of granulated and mylonitized coal are good, and the diffusion ability is also enhanced. However, for in situ reservoir conditions, the high dependence of reservoir permeability on stress results in a weak seepage of gas; thus, desorption and diffusion is limited. Fourth, during gas production, the pore range in which transitional diffusion takes place always increases, but that for Fick diffusion decreases. This is a reason for the reduction in diffusion capacity, in which micropores and transitional pores are the primary factors limiting gas diffusion. Finally, the proposed comprehensive model of CBM production under in situ reservoir conditions elucidates the key factors limiting gas production, which is helpful for selection of reservoir stimulation methods.",

        "abstract": "The degree of deformation of coal under the action of geological structure has important effects on the permeability and gas-bearing properties of a coal reservoir. Therefore, it is critical to understand how the characteristics of coals vary with degree of deformation in coalbed methane (CBM) exploration and exploitation. In this work, Young\u2019s modulus and Poisson\u2019s ratio of coal samples with various degrees of deformation, cored from the CBM wells in South Qinshui Basin, China, were tested with an electro-hydraulic servo-controlled rock mechanic testing system (RMT 150B). Statistical analysis was subsequently conducted with the corresponding P-wave times. The results demonstrate that the destructive effect of geological structure had significant influences on the Young\u2019s modulus of coals. Poisson\u2019s ratio had no significant correlation, but Young\u2019s modulus decreased with increased deformation, and coals can thus be classified into one of three types based on the critical values of Young\u2019s modulus. Further study found that P-wave time had a positive linear correlation with S-wave time in coal samples, and P-wave time is obviously shorter than S-wave time with the same coal. Both P-wave and S-wave times become longer with increased deformation. P-wave time is also linearly correlated with Young\u2019s modulus. Based on well log data, values inferred from the statistical formulas among P-wave time, S-wave time, and Young\u2019s modulus can provide a more accurate classification in terms of the degree of coal deformation.",

        "abstract": "Despite the recent success in the realization of the quantum anomalous Hall effect, the underlying physical mechanism of the long range Ferromagnetism is still unclear. Based on our density functional theory calculations, we discovered an intriguing long-range ferromagnetic order in Cr-doped, carrier-free Bi2Te3, with the separation between dopants more than 8 {AA}. We found that this magnetic coupling is facilitated by an anti-bonding state originated from the lone pair of a Te 5p state and a Bi 6s state, despite this anti-bonding state lies below the valence band maximum. Such a state serves as a hidden step stone merged in the electron sea and mediates the long-range magnetic order. An effective electron hopping model is proposed to explain this mechanism. This novel mechanism sheds light on the understanding of long-range ferromagnetism in insulators and may lead to the realization of the long-range magnetic order in dilute magnetic semiconductors.",

        "abstract": "Tuning magnetic order in magnetic semiconductors is a long sought goal. A proper concentration of acceptors can dramatically suppress local magnetic order in favor of the long one. Using Mn and an acceptor codoped LiZnAs as an example, we demonstrate, by first-principles calculation, the emergence of a long-range magnetic order. This intriguing phenomenon can be understood from an interplay between an acceptor-free magnetism and a band coupling magnetism. Our observation thus lays the ground for a precise control of the magnetic order in future spintronic devices.",

Based on DFT calculations, we discovered an intrinsic long range AFM coupling in V doped CuInTe$_2$. The AFM coupling is mainly due to the $p-d$ coupling and electron redistribution along the interacting chains. The relatively small energy difference between $p$ and $d$ orbitals and the small energy difference between d orbitals of the dopants and that of stepping stone sites can enhance the stability of this AFM configuration. A multi-bands Hubbard model was proposed to provide fundamental understanding to the long range AFM coupling in chalcopyrite diluted magnetic semiconductors(DMS).",

The objective is to find the appropriate viscoelastic coefficients to suppress the nonlinear dynamic response of a marine riser. The pipe is placed in a uniform cross flow and geometric nonlinearities are considered. Two distributed and coupled Van der Pol wake oscillators are applied to characterize the fluctuating lift and drag coefficients, respectively. The highly nonlinear fluid-structure interaction equations are directly coupled and solved by the finite element method. Firstly, the model is validated by comparing with published experimental data and numerical simulation results. Then, modal analysis is performed to determine the impact of viscoelastic coefficients on the natural frequency for different damping values. A nonlinear dynamic analysis is carried out to determine the impacts of the viscoelastic coefficients on displacements, stresses, modal variation and phase portraits. The results show that the viscoelastic coefficients have a significant effect on the natural frequency of the studied marine riser. It is also demonstrated that appropriate viscoelastic coefficients are very important to effectively suppress the maximum displacements and stresses.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this article, a three-dimensional nonlinear dynamic model, which takes into account both the geometric and hydrodynamic nonlinearities, is presented to characterize the behavior of a flexible fluid-conveying pipe under vortex-induced vibration by extended Hamiltonu0027s principle. It should be noted that the pipe conveying fluids is placed in a uniform cross flow. Two distributed and coupled van der Pol wake oscillators are utilized to model the fluctuating lift and drag coefficients, respectively. The finite element method is adopted to directly solve the highly coupled nonlinear fluid-structure interaction equations. Model validations are firstly performed through comparisons with published experimental data and numerical simulation results. The results show that the natural frequency will rapidly decrease with the increase of internal flow velocity. Parametric studies highlight that the maximum displacements and stresses of the riser can be increased or decreased depending on the internal flow velocity, and the critical internal flow velocities result in the increase of mode order for different cross-flow velocities. The opposite variation between axial and in-line or cross-flow displacement amplitude and maximum stress within the modal transition region is revealed. Moreover, the discontinuous jumping phenomenon of in-line response modal is discovered.",

A van der Pol wake oscillator is adopted to represent the fluctuating lift forces, and nonlinear hydrodynamic force is also introduced. The goal of the present work is to discuss VIV dynamic responses of a fluid-conveying riser to guide the design and usage of riser in offshore oil field. The constant tension analyses are first obtained to determine the lock-in region of cross-flow velocity. Then, the influence of excitation frequency and harmonic tension amplitude on the resonance regions, the displacement amplitudes, the maximum stresses for various internal flow velocity, has been investigated. The results show that the dominated resonance region changed from twice the fundamental frequency to the fundamental frequency when harmonic tension amplitudes and cross-flow velocities are simultaneously increased. It is also revealed that the foremost two lock-in regions, respectively, appeared near the fundamental frequency and twice the fundamental frequency for varying cross-flow velocities.",

This paper aims to improve the sealing performance of the dynamic seal used in the deep sea motor via numerical simulations and response surface method (RSM). The contact pressure of the seal for different compression ratio was analyzed, then the pumping effect of Kalsi seal was analyzed, and the leakage rate for the edge region was discussed. On this basis, the relationship between the objective functions and the seal design parameters were established by the second-order polynomial models using 30-group simulation results with four independent seal parameters. The analysis of variance shows that the precision of regression equations of the outer contact pressure and leakage...",

Results showed a significant decrease in the leaf thickness among plants treated with N0.25, N1.5N and P0.25, whereas showed an increase among plants treated with P1.5 (p u003c 0.05). Stomatal density was reduced in P0.25- and N0.25-treated plants, whereas increased in N1.5- and P1.5-treated plants (p u003c 0.05). Moreover, N0.25-treated plants showed reduced trichome density, whereas N1.5-treated plants exhibited the highestamount of trichome density (p u003c 0.05). The densest veins occurred in the leaves of P1.5P-treated plants, then density reduced in plants with N1.5, N1P1, N0.25, P0.25 treatments, in a decreasing order (p u003c 0.05).",

        "abstract": "Fast and effective visualization research of leaf lettuce leaves was particularly important in modern fine agriculture irrigation. Therefore, hyperspectral imaging technology was used to test the moisture content in leaf lettuce sample. A method involving wavelet transform coupled with partial least squares regression (WT-PLSR) was proposed to extract characteristic wavelengths, build models, and evaluate characteristic wavelengths. Hyperspectral imaging data of 200 leaf lettuce leaves of five moisture gradients were obtained using hyperspectral imaging instrument. The whole region of leaf lettuce sample was selected as region of interest (ROI) to extract the hyperspectral data using sheffield index, image segment, and masking. To reduce noise interference, Savitzky\u2013Golay (SG) algorithm was used to manage spectral data. Besides, WT-PLSR algorithm was used to select effective feature wavelengths, build detection model, and evaluate characteristic wavelengths. The best prediction model of moisture content in leaf lettuce sample was PLSR model (RMSEP\u2009=\u20090.1688, Rp2=0.8307) building by characteristic wavelength extracted from fourth layers of wavelet decomposition, and it was applied to achieve the distribution of moisture content in leaf lettuce leaves. Hyperspectral imaging technology coupled with WT-PLSR algorithm can effectively realize the quantitative detection of moisture content in leaf lettuce sample, and visualizing distribution map of moisture content in leaf lettuce leaves offered a more intuitive and comprehensive assessment of moisture contents.Practical applicationsWell understanding moisture content in leaf lettuce leaves is very important for revelation of novel biological function and calcium (Ca) content. To facilitate more intuitively and comprehensively detect the moisture content in leaf lettuce leaves, a method involving wavelet transform coupled with partial least squares regression (WT-PLSR) was proposed to extract characteristic wavelengths, build models, and evaluate characteristic wavelengths. It confirms that the WT-PLSR algorithm is feasible and effective for building models of different moisture contents in leaf lettuce leaves, and visualizing distribution map of leaf lettuce leaves offered a more intuitive and comprehensive assessment of moisture contents.",

This technology extracts the nitrogen hyperspectral feature image and the plant three dimensional morphological characters, to achieve the rapid quantitative analysis of nitrogen in tomato. The characteristic spectrum of nitrogen was extracted, and the mean intensity characteristic of the image feature was obtained. Then based on the acquisition of the tomato hyperspectral image data cube at different nitrogen levels, the sensitive region stepwise regression combined with correlation analysis was performed. Based on the acquired three dimensional laser scanning data of tomatoes, the stem diameter, the plant height and other biomass characteristics of different nitrogen levels were obtained by establishing the spatial geometric model of tomato three dimensional point cloud. A multi-feature fusion model for tomato nitrogen detection was established by partial least square regression. The results showed that the R2 in the constructed model was 0.94, with the accuracy significantly better than that of the single feature model established by using hyperspectral image and three dimensional laser scanning.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.   The effects of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and a zinc-modified biochar catalyst on lignin pyrolysis were analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Thermal decomposition analysis disclosed that lignin and LDPE co-pyrolysis was more complicated than pyrolysis of lignin alone, addition of the catalyst caused a decrease in reaction temperature and a slight increase in the conversion rate, and most of the compounds decomposed at 260\u00b0C for lignin alone and at about 450\u00b0C for the lignin/LDPE blend. The synergistic effect between lignin and LDPE in co-pyrolysis with the catalyst was also analyzed. The kinetic parameters indicated that lignin pyrolysis was a third-order reaction, while lignin/LDPE co-pyrolysis was a second-order reaction. Addition of LDPE to lignin during pyrolysis lowered the activation energy from 49.10 to 30.26\u00a0kJ mol -1 . Analysis of the reaction kinetics revealed that the reaction rate improved with addition of the catalyst.",

The composites were characterized by FTIR and XRD. The magnetic properties of the samples were measured and analyzed by VSM. The results indicated that the average crystallite sizes located in a range of 29\u00b77\u201332\u00b79\u00a0nm. Lattice constants, a and c were close to 5\u00b788 and 23\u00b705\u00a0A for the M-type strontium ferrite phase.

The synthesis conditions for activated carbon (AC) and V 2 O 5 /AC were thoroughly investigated via orthogonal experiments and single factor experiments, respectively. The obtained optimal parameters could be directly adopted in practical application about utilization of stone coal ore. The optimal deashing experimental parameters for stone coal ore were: HF concentration of 15%, H 2 SO 4  concentration of 15%, acid leaching temperature of 85\u202f\u00b0C, and acid leaching time of 2\u202fh. The as-prepared activated carbon from stone coal ore could be applied to the removal of methylene blue. The as-prepared V 2 O 5 /AC photocatalyst possessed a highly visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity for the removal of Rhodamine B (RhB) dye. The RhB degradation ratio could reach to 90.0% after only 3\u202fh photocatalytic reaction. This photocatalyst would be possibly applied to treatment other organic dye wastewater. Actually, this work would extend the application field of stone coal ore. Most importantly, we hope the proposed new concept that in situ utilization of ore can be widely spread and applied.",

        "abstract": "Nd3+, as one of the most important rare-earth (RE) ion, has been playing a significant role in pumping the infrared (IR) light. Depending on different synthesis strategies, doping content, and crystal lattice, however, Nd3+ always shows different IR intensity. In this work, we have fabricated two series of Nd3+ doped nanocrystallines that share with the same crystal structure, i.e., Nd3+ doped Y3Al5O12 (YAG) and Yb3Al5O12 (YbAG), through using the co-precipitation synthesis method while the ammonium bicarbonate as the precipitant agent. To reveal the influence of the synthesis conditions (e.g., synthetic temperature and pH value) on structural and florescent properties of Nd3+ doped YAG and YbAG nanocrystallines, several techniques have been performed in this work, including the X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimeter (TG-DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Raman and florescent spectroscopy spectra. Our results reveal that the optimal synthesis conditions are 1000 \u00b0C and pH 8 for YAG:Nd3+ and 900 \u00b0C and pH 9 for YbAG:Nd3+. Moreover, we also find the optimal Nd3+ doping contents of the YAG:Nd3+ and YbAG:Nd3+ nanocrystallines are 3% and 1.5%, which correspond to the strongest fluorescent intensity upon excitation at 808 nm and 980 nm, respectively. Typically, we reveal that substitution of Y with Yb ions could allow to enhancing the Nd3+ fluorescent intensity upon excitation at 808 nm. This work provides new insights into designing excellent crystal materials that can allow us to realize the laser transparent ceramics.",

        "abstract": "We synthesized a flower-like Ni-Mn-S on Ti mesh (Ni-Mn-S/TM) as monolithic sensing platform by facile electrodeposition method. The phase composition and surface morphology of the as-prepared samples were characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM and HRTEM. The electrodeposits displayed unique hierarchical nanosheet structure. Mn incorporation remarkably modulated the surface morphology of Ni-S on TM. This flower-like structure could increase the active surface area, providing more active sites for electrocatalytic reaction. Electrochemical measurement demonstrated Ni-Mn-S/TM exhibited good response to glucose at the range of 12 \u03bcM to 3.5 mM with high sensitivity of 860.8 \u03bcA mM-1 cm-2. The binder-free Ni-Mn-S/TM electrode also presented good anti-interference ability, reusability and stability. This work gives a new avenue to improve glucose sensing performance of nickel sulfide and even other nanomaterials.",

However, the etiology and pathogenesis of splay leg syndrome in piglets are still poorly understood. The aims of this paper were to characterize changes in the transcriptome of splay leg piglets and identify candidate genes responsible for this disease. We chose three splay leg piglets and their healthy full sibs, and constructed six RNA libraries using skeletal muscle samples from both groups and identified the differentially expressed genes between the two groups using RNA-seq. A total of 555 differentially expressed genes were identified, of which 216 were up-regulated and 339 genes were down-regulated in the splay leg group relative to the healthy group. In addition, 321 significantly enriched GO terms and 12 significantly enriched KEGG pathways were identified. FBXO32 is one of the ten most differentially expressed genes in our experiment, and it is regulated by the significantly enriched pathway (PI3K-Akt). The overexpression of FBXO32 which leads to the process of muscle atrophy might be responsible for congenital splay leg in piglets. The result of this study could help improve understanding of the molecular mechanism of congenital splay leg syndrome.",

In this study, we found that the expression of miR-214 in porcine ovaries was higher than in many other tissues, and miR-21 expression in ovaries was significantly higher than in the uterus and pituitary. Meanwhile, miR-21 was upregulated and miR-214 was downregulated in the ovaries of high litter size (YH) pigs compared with low litter size (YL) pigs. Moreover, the lowest expression of miR-21 and miR-214 occurred on Days 14 and 7 of the estrous cycle and was expressed at greater levels in the granulosa cells of subordinate follicles than in dominant follicles on Day 3 of the estrous cycle. Bioinformatics analysis showed that miR-21 and miR-214 might target several genes that involved in the mTOR signaling, apoptosis, and steroid biosynthesis pathways, and they play important roles in maintaining the porcine estrous cycle. The qPCR and western blot analysis indicated that miR-214 inhibited the expression of SCARB1 gene in the transcriptional level, but not affected the SCARB1 gene's protein level. Our research findings indicated that miR-21 and miR-214 played important roles in reproduction regulation during porcine estrous.",

To evaluate the effects of the adiponectin (ADIPOQ) gene on porcine litter size, we investigated ADIPOQ polymorphisms in three breeds, Wannan Black pigs, Berkshire pigs, and BW pigs (crossbred pigs produced from mating male Berkshire pigs and female Wannan Black pigs), using the PCR-SSCP method. Three SNPs (c. 178G u003e A, c. 1165A u003e G, and c. 1138G u003e A) were identified. In Wannan Black pigs, association analysis indicated that the c. 178G u003e A SNP genotype was significantly associated with an effect on total number born (TNB; P   A SNP was significantly associated with an effect on TNB (P u003c 0.05) and NBA (P u003c 0.05) in primiparity and multiparity. In addition, three of the nine possible genotype combinations, AACC, AACD, and AGCD, were found. AGCD resulted in primiparous and multiparous sows with the highest TNB. These results indicated that polymorphisms in the ADIPOQ gene could be used for marker-assisted selection programs for the genetic improvement of reproductive characteristics in pigs.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the expression difference of miRNAs and mRNAs between the follicular phase (FP) and luteal phase (LP) in porcine ovaries and provide a theoretical basis for the research on mammalian reproductive regulation. RNA-Seq and miRNA-Seq were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMs) between the FP and LP in ovaries of six sows (3-year-old Yorkshire pigs with similar weights and same parities). Bioinformatic analysis was used to screen potential genes and miRNAs related to porcine ovarian function. Real-time qualitative PCR was used to validate the sequencing results. RNA-Seq results showed that 3078 genes were up-regulated and 1444 genes were down-regulated in the LP compared with the FP, and DEGs were significantly enriched in 242 Gene Ontology (GO) terms and 33 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. miRNA-Seq identified 112 DEMs, of which 25 were up-regulated and 87 were down-regulated in the LP compared with the FP. We obtained 186 intersection genes (IGs) between the 4522 DEGs and 2444 target genes predicted from the 112 DEMs. After constructing a miRNA-gene-pathway network, we identified key miRNAs and genes including miR-17-3p, miR-214, miR-221-5p, miR-125b, FGF1, YWHAG, YWHAZ, FDFT1, and DHCR24, which are enriched in Hippo and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, and various metabolic pathways. These results indicate that these key genes and miRNAs may play important roles in the developmental transition from FP to LP in porcine ovaries, and represent candidate targets for further study.

        "abstract": "Yucatan miniature pig (YMP), a naturally small breed, has been domesticated in the hot and arid Yucatan Peninsula for a long time. However, its selection signatures on the X chromosome remain poorly understood. In this study, we focused on elucidating the selection signatures of YMP on the X chromosome during its domestication and breeding, using the whole-genome sequencing data. We performed population admixture analyses to determine its genetic relationships with other domesticated breeds and wild boars. Subsequently, we used two approaches, the fixation index (Fst) and \u03c0 ratios, to identify the selection signatures with 100 kb windows sliding in 10 kb steps. As a result, we found that the ectodysplasin A ( EDA ) gene was related with hypoplasia or absence of hair and sweat glands. This could uncover the relative lack of odor in YMP and the presence of hypoplasia or absence of hair in pigs. Furthermore, we found several genes under selection in other animals. A bioinformatics analysis of the genes in selection regions showed that they were associated with growth, lipid metabolism, reproduction, and immune system. Our findings will lead to a better understanding of the unique genetic and phenotypic characteristics of YMP and offer a plausible method for their utilization as an animal model for hair and odor disease research.",

Stable Q-switched pulses with a pulse energy of 0.322\u00a0\u03bcJ, a pulse width of 78.7\u00a0ns and a pulse repetition rate of 410.3\u00a0kHz have been obtained. Compared with the passively Q-switched laser with carbon nanotubes dispersed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), the laser with reticularly ordered single-walled carbon nanotube can produce shorter pulses and higher peak power at almost the same incident pump power. The results suggest that the reticularly ordered single-walled carbon nanotube can be an attractive candidate of saturable absorber for Q-switched laser.",

For transcription to occur, the closed promoter complex (RPc), where DNA is double stranded, must isomerize into an open promoter complex (RPo), where the DNA is melted out into a transcription bubble and the single-stranded template DNA is delivered to the RNAP active site. Using a bacterial RNAP containing the alternative \u03c3 factor and cryoelectron microscopy, we determined structures of RPc and the activator-bound intermediate complex en route to RPo at 3.8 and 5.8\u00a0\u00c5. Our structures show how RNAP-\u03c3 interacts with promoter DNA to initiate the DNA distortions required for transcription bubble formation, and how the activator interacts with RPc, leading to significant conformational changes in RNAP and \u03c3 that promote RPo formation. We propose that DNA melting is an active process initiated in RPc and that the RNAP conformations of intermediates are significantly different from that of RPc and RPo.",

        "abstract": "Transcription initiation is highly regulated in bacterial cells, allowing adaptive gene regulation in response to environment cues. One class of promoter specificity factor called sigma54 enables such adaptive gene expression through its ability to lock the RNA polymerase down into a state unable to melt out promoter DNA for transcription initiation. Promoter DNA opening then occurs through the action of specialized transcription control proteins called bacterial enhancer-binding proteins (bEBPs) that remodel the sigma54 factor within the closed promoter complexes. The remodelling of sigma54 occurs through an ATP-binding and hydrolysis reaction carried out by the bEBPs. The regulation of bEBP self-assembly into typically homomeric hexamers allows regulated gene expression since the self-assembly is required for bEBP ATPase activity and its direct engagement with the sigma54 factor during the remodelling reaction. Crystallographic studies have now established that in the closed promoter complex, the sigma54 factor occupies the bacterial RNA polymerase in ways that will physically impede promoter DNA opening and the loading of melted out promoter DNA into the DNA-binding clefts of the RNA polymerase. Large-scale structural re-organizations of sigma54 require contact of the bEBP with an amino-terminal glutamine and leucine-rich sequence of sigma54, and lead to domain movements within the core RNA polymerase necessary for making open promoter complexes and synthesizing the nascent RNA transcript.",

Shoreline change of the northern Yellow River (Huanghe) Delta after the latest deltaic course shift in 1976 and its influence factors. 222 high-quality Landsat satellite images were used in this study to extract the instantaneous shoreline positions on 22 sections of the northern Yellow River delta. Based on the instantaneous water line position data, a new statistical method for studying annual shoreline change was proposed. The annual shoreline movement of the northern Yellow River delta after the latest deltaic course shift in 1976 was obtained. The results showed that the shoreline on northern Yellow River delta was mostly undergoing a retreat back process since 1976 due to the river course shift, relative sea level change, regional marine hydrodynamic forces and the local engineering constructions. The influence of the Yellow River deltaic course shift in 1976 on the shoreline change mainly occurred in the first 20 year...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The eastern Nanhui mudflat (ENM), located in the southern flank of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Estuary, plays a key role in storm protection, defense against sea level rise, and land resource provision for Shanghai, Chinau0027s largest city. Recently, there has been a great deal of concern for its evolutionary fate, since a drastic reduction in the Changjiang sediment discharge rate and an increased number of estuarine enclosures might negatively impact the environmental protection functions that this mudflat provides. In this paper, a novel method, which employed the envelope lines of instantaneous shoreline positions identified in 436 Landsat satellite images from 1975 to 2016, was used to demonstrate the evolution of the mudflat high and low tide lines in a detailed, quantitative way. Our study reveals the southeast progradation rate of the mudflat doubled from 24\u202fm/yr in 713\u20131974\u202fCE to 49\u202fm/yr in 1975\u20131995\u202fCE, probably due to the influence of the estuarine turbidity maximum zone shifting to the ENM. Under the ample sediment input directly from the turbidity maximum zone, the spatial evolution of the ENM was governed predominantly by the changing morphology of the South Passage due to the quick progradation of the ENM, which narrowed the South Passage by pushing the South Passage Trumpet southeastward. Therefore, the ENM experienced rapid accretion during 1975\u20132016. The accretion rate of the high tide line increased 2\u201313 times due to vegetation and intertidal enclosures, resulting in the rapid reduction of the intertidal area. The area decreased from 97\u202fkm 2  in 1976 to 66\u202fkm 2  in 1995, mainly due to vegetation, and continued decreasing to 12\u202fkm 2  in 2006 due to the intertidal enclosures. In contrast, the accretion rate of the low tide line increased by 25 times due to subtidal enclosures and caused the intertidal area increased to 78\u202fkm 2  in 2015. The almost disappeared intertidal zones in 2006 reappeared. However, this reappearance might be a temporary transitional state, and once the subtidal enclosures are completed, most of the intertidal zones will be replaced by enclosure land. Our study reveals that the drastic reduction in the Changjiang sediment flow to the sea has not caused a decline in the ENM. In contrast, the ENM has experienced rapid accretion in the past 40\u202fyears, resulting in the strengthening of its functional abilities to protect Shanghai, an unexpected outcome.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, 342 Landsat satellite images were used to study the evolution of the Qingshuigou and Qing8 Lobes during 1976\u20132016. Sea-level correction and statistical analysis were used to eliminate the effect of sea-level fluctuations on the shoreline positions. The results revealed that the evolution of the two newborn Huanghe Delta lobes was mainly influenced by the river sediment discharges, river channel changes, course shifts, floods, droughts, and marine hydrodynamic forces.  During 1976\u20132016, the total land gain of the two lobes was 377\u202fkm 2  according to mean-tide line, and the average epeirogenetic efficiency of river sediment discharge was 0.020\u202fm 2 /ton, which was greatly less than that when the channels were natural. The artificial stabilization of the deltaic channels had negative impact on the land gain. Assuming no artificial adjustment to the deltaic channels, the total land gain would increase 435\u202fkm 2 . The land gain of the two lobes was a function of the cumulative sediment discharges, shoreline lengths and Course Shift Bonuses under the circumstance of historical river channel changes. The critical sediment discharge maintaining the area balance of the two lobes was a function of historical shoreline lengths, which increased linearly from 61\u202fM\u202fton in 1976 to an average of 163\u202fM\u202fton during 1996\u20132016. In the future, there are two ways to increase the land gain under the less Huanghe sediment discharge: reducing artificial disturbance of deltaic channels and letting the river enter the sea through the southwest coast of Qingshuigou Lobe.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, 364 Landsat satellite images were utilized to study the spatial and temporal shoreline changes of the southern Yellow River Delta in 1976\u20132016, and a new method revised and improved after Zhang et al. (2016) was proposed. By employing that method, the calculated sea levels calculated from simulated tidal heights and instantaneous shoreline positions rather than simulated tidal heights were used to correct fluctuations in instantaneous shoreline positions caused by tidal height and seasonal sea level changes and other random sea level fluctuations. When calculating the shoreline erosion rates and beach slopes, a statistical analysis of a large number of corrected shoreline positions was used to reduce the influence of random errors that were mainly caused by waves and other casual factors. The shoreline erosion rates and beach slopes presented in this paper are therefore more precise and reliable than those derived in previous studies, which only used two satellite images.  The results of this study show that the shoreline of the southern Yellow River Delta primarily experienced gradual erosion during 1976\u20132016, with an average erosion rate of 26.9\u00a0m/year. The average shoreline erosion rate increased from 24.9\u00a0m/year in 1976\u20131996 to 34.9\u00a0m/year in 1996\u20132016\u2014an increase of 40%\u2014probably due to the reduction in sediment discharge and shifting northward course of the Yellow River after 1996. The shoreline erosion rate of the central coast decreased from 50.2\u00a0m/year in 1976\u20131996 to 27.1\u00a0m/year in 1996\u20132016\u2014a decrease of 46%\u2014probably due to the protection offered by coastal hard structures. The average shoreline erosion rate caused by relative sea level rise was 8.5\u00a0m/year or 32% of the total average shoreline erosion rate. Relative sea level rise plays an important role in the erosion of the southern Yellow River Delta due to its flat beach. The beach slope of the southern Yellow River Delta was flat and stable in 1976\u20132016, and the average slope over most of the beach was 0.043%.",

However, information about how these molecules interact with their cellular targets (on- and off-) is highly limited. Herein, we designed and synthesized photo-reactive and \"clickable\" affinity-based probes (AfBPs), Nap-2 and Nap-5, by introducing photo-crosslinkers to Nap-1, a fluorescent derivative of a small-molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor S1-6. The resulting trifunctional probes Nap-2 and Nap-5 can enrich, visualize and identify cellular on- and off-targets of Bcl-2 inhibitors both in vitro and in situ. Tubulin was validated as an off-target of Bcl-2 inhibitors (Nap-1 and S1-6) by large-scale cell-based proteome profiling and pull-down/Western blotting (PD/WB) using Nap-2 and Nap-5. The BH3-containing property of tubulin was preliminarily illustrated, as some well-known Bcl-2 inhibitors can block the labelling of tubulin by Nap-2.",

The fluorescence of the probe O-NH2 was quenched because of the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process, but switched on by a glutathione-triggered specific recognition reaction between the probe O-NH2 and glutathione. The recognition mechanism for glutathione was explored and verified by theoretical calculations and ESI-MS analysis. Using O-NH2 as the probe, the GSH fluorescence images were demonstrated in HeLa cells and the intracellular GSH levels in different imatinib-resistant K562 tumor cells were firstly determined. Further, O-NH2 was utilized to detect glutathione in D. magna and zebrafish embryos. The combined results indicate that O-NH2 can be applied as an effective tool for detecting glutathione in biological investigations.",

We reported the success in the development of two PROTACs (C3 and C5) that potently and selectively induce the degradation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 (DC50 = 0.7 and 3.0 \u03bcM), respectively, by introducing the E3 ligase cereblon (CRBN)-binding ligand pomalidomide to Mcl-1/Bcl-2 dual inhibitors S1-6 and Nap-1 with \u03bcM-range affinity. C3-induced Mcl-1 ubiquitination translated into much more lethality in Mcl-1-dependent H23 cells than the most potent Mcl-1 occupancy-based inhibitor A-1210477 with nM-range affinity. Moreover, structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations discovered the structural basis for turning nonselective or promiscuous Bcl-2 family ligands into selective PROTACs. C3 and C5 exhibited reversible depletion in living cells, which provides a new potent toolkit for gain-of-function studies to probe the dynamic roles of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 in apoptosis networks.",

However, in the field of organic crystalline film growth, where the crystallization and morphology modulation are of significant importance in optoelectronics, this method has rarely been utilized. Particularly, some potential high-performance materials such as rubrene face the problem of crystallization during film formation. Here a strategy is reported to promote the crystallization of rubrene films in the initial stage assisted by foreign particles. Highly ordered thin film from the sub-monolayer stage can be achieved. Efficient charge transport and high mobility up to 2.95 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) are achieved on thus ultrathin crystalline films. Such a method enables the well controlling of the film growth from the very early stage and produces uniform crystalline films with good reproducibility, thus highly promising to yield desired optoelectrical properties and applications.

Here, two interface modification methods were applied to modulate the thin film morphology of the organic semiconductor, 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene(TIPS-pentacene). The resulting different film morphologies and packing structures led to distinct charge transport abilities. A substantial 40-fold increase in charge carrier mobility was observed on the octadecyltrichlorosilane(OTS)-modified sample compared to that of the transis-tor on the bare substrate. A better charge mobility greater than 1 cm2\u00b7V\u20121\u00b7s\u20121 is realized on the p-sexiphenyl(p-6P)-modified transistors due to the large grain size, good continuity and, importantly, the intimate \u03c0-\u03c0 packing in each domain.",

This study provides a simple approach to address the contact issue by incorporating an inducing layer prior to the organic semiconductor deposition. The molecules of the inducing layer nucleate into lamellar grains from the edge to the channel, resulting in a good morphological contact to the bottom electrodes. The following active layer maintains nearly layer-by-layer growth mode and yields uniformed terraced-like films both on the electrode edges and in the channels. With the inducing layer, pentacene thin-film bottom-contact transistors are obtained with a hole mobility exceeding 1 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121.",

Diffusion profiles of cerium in such glasses were obtained with the conventional Rutherford backscattering technique. Through fitting the diffusion profiles with the thin-film solution of Fick\u2019s second law, diffusion coefficients of cerium with different annealing temperatures and durations were solved.

However, increasing evidence suggests that not all target sites mediate regulatory function, raising the questions of how to determine which sites are active, what are the epigenetic consequences of TF binding at these sites, and how the specificity is coded. To address these questions, we focused on CRX, a disease-associated homeodomain TF required for photoreceptor gene expression and development. Since CRX binds more than 6000 sites across the genome in the retina, we profiled chromatin landscape changes at each binding site during normal development and in the absence of CRX and interpreted the results by thorough investigation of other epigenomic datasets and sequence features.",

The calculated self-diffusion coefficients of [Emim][Dmp] and water increase rapidly with temperature increase. When water mole fraction is less than 0.6, the self-diffusion coefficients of [Emim][Dmp] and water vary little with water mole fraction and the binary solution is more ionic liquid like because the hydrogen-bonds (H-bonds) between IL and water are stronger than that between water molecules. In this case, water molecules are restricted by IL. However, when water mole fraction is more than 0.8, the self-diffusion coefficients of [Emim][Dmp] and water increase obviously due to the fact that some free water molecules can form H-bonds with themselves rather than IL. The weak H-bonds between H2 in cation and O atoms in anion and strong hydrogen bond between O21 in anion and H34 in water are also found from radial distribution functions (RDFs). The strong interaction between [Dmp] \u2212  and water may also explain why [Emim][Dmp] and water have good solubility and affinity. Moreover, the H-bonds between [Dmp] \u2212  and water become weaker with temperature increase.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were dispersed into ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium diethylphosphate ([EMIM][DEP]), and its aqueous solution [EMIM][DEP](1)\u00a0+\u00a0\\(\\hbox {H}_{2}\\hbox {O}(2)\\) to enhance the thermal conductivity of base liquids, which will be the promising working pairs for absorption heat pumps and refrigerators. The enhancement effects on thermal conductivity were studied by experiment and molecular dynamic simulation (MD) methods. The thermal conductivities of [EMIM][DEP]\u00a0+\u00a0SWCNTs (INF) and [EMIM][DEP](1)\u00a0+\u00a0\\(\\hbox {H}_{2}\\hbox {O}(2)\\)\u00a0+\u00a0SWCNT(SNF) both with SWCNT mass fraction of 0.5, 1, and 2 (wt%) were measured by transient hot-wire method. The results indicate that the enhancement ratio of thermal conductivity of INF, and SNF can approach 1.30 when SWCNT is 2 (wt%). Moreover, SWCNTs has a higher enhancement ratio than multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Density and thermal conductivity of [EMIM][DEP], [EMIM][DEP](1)\u00a0+\u00a0\\(\\hbox {H}_{2}\\hbox {O}(2)\\), INF and SNF systems, together with self-diffusion coefficients of \\(\\hbox {[EMIM]}^{+}\\), \\(\\hbox {[DEP]}^{-}\\), [EMIM][DEP] and water in solution [EMIM][DEP](1)\u00a0+\u00a0\\(\\hbox {H}_{2}\\hbox {O}(2)\\), were investigated by MD simulations. The results indicate that the maximum relative error between the simulated and experimental densities is about 2\u00a0%, and the simulated self-diffusion coefficient of [EMIM][DEP] is in the order of magnitude of \\(10^{-11}\\,\\hbox {m}^{2}\\cdot \\hbox {s}^{-1}\\). The average relative deviation for the simulated thermal conductivity of [EMIM][DEP](1)\u00a0+\u00a0\\(\\hbox {H}_{2}\\hbox {O}(2)\\), INF and SNF from experimental ones are 23.57\u00a0%, 5\u00a0%, and 5\u00a0%, respectively. In addition, the contributions of kinetic energy, potential energy, and virial and partial enthalpy terms to thermal conductivity were also calculated. The results indicate that virial term\u2019s contribution to thermal conductivity is the maximum, which accounts for 75\u00a0% to 80\u00a0% of total thermal conductivity.",

        "abstract": "In the last few years, long-pulse H-mode plasma discharges (with small edge-localized modes and normalized beta, \u03b2 N ~ 1) have been realized at the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST). This paper reports on high-\u03b2 N (u003e1.5) discharges in the 2015 EAST campaign. The characteristics of these H-mode plasmas have been presented in a database. Analysis of the experimental limit of \u03b2 N has revealed several main features of typical discharges. Firstly, efficient, stable high heating power is required. Secondly, control of impurity radiation (partly due to interaction between the plasma and the in-vessel components) is also a critical issue for the maintenance of high-\u03b2 N discharges. In addition an internal transport barrier (ITB) has recently been observed in EAST, introducing further improvement in confinement surpassing H-mode plasmas. ITB dynamics is another key issue for high-\u03b2 N plasmas in EAST. Each of these features is discussed in this paper. Study and improvement of these issues could be considered as the key to achieving long-pulse high-\u03b2 N operation with EAST.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic field regulation is a difficult and long-existing issue in surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs). To produce effective and efficient flux regulation for PMSMs, a new topology, named a dual-structure parallel hybrid excitation machine (DS-PHEM), is presented in this paper. In this machine, the rotating permanent magnet (PM) excitation and stationary DC field excitation are artificially arranged and designed at the inner and outer magnetic circuits, respectively. Therefore, a decoupling and parallel feature is obtained between two excitation sources. This machine integrates the merits of a brushless structure and theoretically infinite constant power range, as well as zero risk of demagnetization. In this paper, the machine configuration is introduced, mainly focusing on some important design criteria for electromagnetic integration, and the operating principles of flux control are also analyzed in detail. To further verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme, the overall electromagnetic performance of the proposed DS-PHEM is evaluated by using the time-stepping finite-element method.",

        "abstract": "This paper incorporates the idea of integrated field and armature windings into the design of novel hybrid excited machines with bi-directional flux modulating effect, which results in a new hybrid-excited machine concept that is referred as dual-electrical-port DC-coil-free hybrid-excited machine (DEP-DCF-HEM). In the proposed design, DC field windings are eliminated and DC bias currents are injected into the windings to generate DC excitation field. In addition, the armature windings are divided into dual electrical ports, and zero-sequence current flows between these two ports can adjust the air-gap field effectively. Compared with existing HEMs with additional DC coils, the proposed machines can achieve both higher torque density and wider flux weakening range. The presented design principle can be utilized in a variety of configurations of DEP-DCF-HEMs. Topologies with stator permanent magnet (PM), rotor PM and dual PM are possible designs, which are all investigated in this paper. A dual PM DEP-DCF-HEM prototype is manufactured, and experimental measurements are conducted to verify its performances.",

        "abstract": "Numerous studies have reported that inflammation is involved in the pathophysiology of depression. Pioglitazone, a PPAR-\u03b3 agonist, has potential anti-inflammatory and antidepressive effects. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the antidepressant-like effect of pioglitazone on an inflammation-related mouse model of depression remain to be fully elucidated. Herein, we aimed to explore the effects of pioglitazone on depressive-like behaviours of mice exposed to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We assessed behaviour changes of mice pretreated with pioglitazone exposed to LPS. Additionally, neural apoptosis, and the expression of apoptosis-related (cleaved caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, cyt c) and signalling proteins (AKT, JNK, p38) were assessed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of these mice. Furthermore, we assessed the influence of anisomycin, a JNK/p38 agonist, and LY294002, a PI3K/AKT inhibitor, on the antidepressant-like effect of pioglitazone in mice. We show that pioglitazone pretreatment (20mg/kg, intragastrically) attenuated LPS-induced (10 ng/\u03bcl/site) depressive-like behaviours. GW9662, a PPAR-\u03b3 antagonist, significantly blocked the antidepressant-like effect of pioglitazone. Furthermore, at the molecular level, pioglitazone significantly reversed, via PPAR-\u03b3-dependent increase in neural apoptosis in the PFC of mice, accompanied by up-regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and down-regulation of the JNK/p38 pathway. Moreover, both anisomycin and LY294002 abrogated the antidepressant-like effect of pioglitazone. In conclusion, our results showed that PI3K/AKT/JNK/p38 signalling pathway-mediated neural apoptosis in the PFC of mice may be involved in the antidepressant-like effect of pioglitazone. This provides novel insights into and therapeutic targets for inflammation-related depression. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

This study aimed to investigate the association of white blood cell (WBC) count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) with the occurrence of DCI in SAH patients.  A total of 122 patients diagnosed with aSAH within 72 h of onset were retrospectively enrolled. The count of WBC, neutrophil count (NC), and lymphocyte (LC) was collected on admission. Computed tomography perfusion was performed within 7 days after SAH. The occurrence of DCI was recorded during the hospitalization.  Among enrolled patients, 43 (35.2%) developed DCI during hospitalization. Patients who developed DCI had a higher count of WBC, NC, and NLR as well as a lower count of LC. NC and NLR were independently associated with the occurrence of DCI, while NLR was the best predictive parameter according to the receiver operating characteristic curve. Moreover, there was a strong correlation between NLR and mean cerebral blood flow, mean transit time and mean time to peak.  Leukocytosis is an early pathology of SAH, and NLR may be a practical predictor for the occurrence of DCI in SAH patients.",

The dissolved organic matter, cellular morphology, viability, and recovery of M. aeruginosa cells after flocculation and sedimentation were also included. In addition, the effects of pH and addition order of PSFA and PDADMAC on algal removal were investigated. The removal efficiency of algae coagulated using combined PDADMAC and PSFA was improved by 34.5% and 19.3%, respectively. The organic matter removal was also enhanced. The optimum pH range for algal removal is 7.0-10.0, and the preferable addition sequence is the simultaneous addition of PDADMAC and PSFA. Scanning electron microscopy observation indicated that the combined usage of PDADMAC and PSFA caused no damage to the algal cell. Moreover, the experiment on algal recovery demonstrated that PDADMAC has bacteriostatic ability.",

Different concentrations of potassium permanganate were added into the suspension of Anabaena spiroides, one of the dominant algae in water bloom, and after pre-oxidation of permanganate for 1\u00a0h, the results show that the removal rate significantly increases by 33.99~36.35% compared to direct coagulation. Then, the algal characteristics, including photosynthetic ability, the changes in extracellular organic matter three-dimensional fluorescence, and the distribution of molecular weight were conducted and the results show that along with increasing concentration of potassium permanganate, the photosynthetic ability of algae decreases, more extracellular organic matter is secreted, and large molecular weight matter (humic-like and fulvic-like substances) are generated. Therefore, this study demonstrates that potassium permanganate could be used in addressing the algae-rich water.",

        "abstract": "Lithium, a classic mood stabilizer, prevents apoptosis-dependent cellular death and has garnered considerable interest as a neuroprotective agent that is efficacious in the treatment of many neurological diseases. However, the effects of lithium in epilepsy remain controversial. We found that different doses of lithium affect epileptic seizure activity and bidirectionally modulate the susceptibility to and severity of seizures induced by pilocarpine in rats. Recently, it has been demonstrated that systematically administered lithium affects the powers of hippocampal gamma and theta oscillations in baseline electroencephalograms. Low-dose lithium (10\u2009mg/kg) administered to pilocarpine-treated rats markedly increased the powers of basal gamma (30-80\u2009Hz) and theta (4-12\u2009Hz) oscillations, decreased the proportion of Racine stage 4-5 seizures, extended latency until seizure onset, and significantly reduced the frequency of lower-class seizures (p < 0.05). Conversely, when the dose was increased to 40\u2009mg/kg, lithium reduced the frequency of lower-class seizures compared to control treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Further, at this high dose, lithium reduced the power of basal gamma oscillations and markedly increased the susceptibility to and severity of pilocarpine-induced seizures and enhanced ripple rhythms (80-200\u2009Hz) postictally. Our results provide a framework for further investigations of the underlying electrophysiological mechanisms of lithium-induced imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory neural circuits that regulate seizure activity in rats. In conclusion, the observed in vivo changes in the powers of basal gamma and theta oscillations in response to different doses of lithium may reflect hippocampal neural network responsiveness.",

        "abstract": "Aim:  The aim of this study is to establish a method for determination of eupatilin in  Folium artemisiae  Argyi and observe the inhibitory effect of  Folium artemisiae  Argyi extract on human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells.  Methods:  High-performance liquid chromatograph system with 2910 pump, 2930 UV detector, and N2000 workstation was used for determination of eupatilin in  Folium artemisiae  Argyi. Human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells were cultured and cell proliferation was measured using the MTT assay. The expression protein levels of p53, Topo II, and bcl-2 were detected using Western blotting.  Results:  Eupatilin exhibited a linearity range of 0.5\u20133.0 \u03bcg/mL and a recovery of 100.72%, relevant standard derivation = 2.28%.  Folium artemisiae  Argyi extract had marked cytostatic and cytotoxic effects on SMMC-7721 cells, inhibited the SMMC-7721 colony formation in a dose-dependent manner.  Folium artemisiae  Argyi extract already possessed delayed effect after treating SMMC-7721 cells for 8 h, which became obvious at 12 h from treatment. After drug withdrawal, cells still tended to apoptosis.  Folium artemisiae  Argyi extract could inhibit p53, Topo II, and bcl-2 expressions in tumor cells. The present method for determination of eupatilin is simple, fast, accurate, sensitive, and reproducible.  Conclusion:  Hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells are quite sensitive to  Folium artemisiae  Argyi extract, which may be associated with its suppression of p53, Topo II, and bcl-2 expressions.

This process is aided by chromatin-remodeling complexes, such as the multisubunit INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex. Here we present cryo-EM structures of the active core complex of human INO80 at 9.6\u2009\u00c5, with portions at 4.1-\u00c5 resolution, and reconstructions of combinations of subunits. Together, these structures reveal the architecture of the INO80 complex, including Ino80 and actin-related proteins, which is assembled around a single RUVBL1 (Tip49a) and RUVBL2 (Tip49b) AAA+ heterohexamer. An unusual spoked-wheel structural domain of the Ino80 subunit is engulfed by this heterohexamer; both, in combination, form the core of the complex. We also identify a cleft in RUVBL1 and RUVBL2, which forms a major interaction site for partner proteins and probably communicates these interactions to its nucleotide-binding sites.",

        "abstract": "Several chromatin remodellers have the ability to space nucleosomes on DNA. For ISWI remodellers, this involves an interplay between H4 histone tails, the AutoN and NegC motifs of the motor domains that together regulate ATPase activity and sense the length of DNA flanking the nucleosome. By contrast, the INO80 complex also spaces nucleosomes but is not regulated by H4 tails and lacks the AutoN and NegC motifs. Instead nucleosome sliding requires cooperativity between two INO80 complexes that monitor DNA length simultaneously on either side of the nucleosome during sliding. The C-terminal domain of the human Ino80 subunit (Ino80CTD) binds cooperatively to DNA and dimerisation of these domains provides crosstalk between complexes. ATPase activity, rather than being regulated, instead gradually becomes uncoupled as nucleosome sliding reaches an end point and this is controlled by the Ino80CTD. A single active ATPase motor within the dimer is sufficient for sliding.",

        "abstract": "Access to DNA within nucleosomes is required for a variety of processes in cells including transcription, replication and repair. Consequently, cells encode multiple systems that remodel nucleosomes. These complexes can be simple, involving one or a few protein subunits, or more complicated multi-subunit machines  . Biochemical studies have placed the motor domains of several chromatin remodellers in the superhelical location 2 region of the nucleosome. Structural studies of yeast Chd1 and Snf2-a subunit in the complex with the capacity to remodel the structure of chromatin (RSC)-in complex with nucleosomes have provided insights into the basic mechanism of nucleosome sliding performed by these complexes. However, how larger, multi-subunit remodelling complexes such as INO80 interact with nucleosomes and how remodellers carry out functions such as nucleosome sliding  , histone exchange  and nucleosome spacing remain poorly understood. Although some remodellers work as monomers  , others work as highly cooperative dimers. Here we present the structure of the human INO80 chromatin remodeller with a bound nucleosome, which reveals that INO80 interacts with nucleosomes in a previously undescribed manner: the motor domains are located on the DNA at the entry point to the nucleosome, rather than at superhelical location 2. The ARP5-IES6 module of INO80 makes additional contacts on the opposite side of the nucleosome. This arrangement enables the histone H3 tails of the nucleosome to have a role in the regulation of the activities of the INO80 motor domain-unlike in other characterized remodellers, for which H4 tails have been shown to regulate the motor domains.",

It is theoretically and experimentally proved that the proposed metamaterial can obtain two sound insulation bands where the sound energy is also efficiently harvested at the same frequency simultaneously. The peak of the output power can reach up to 244 nW when the incident sound pressure is 1 Pa, which is about 14 times larger than structures composed of single membrane reported before with the same input. Moreover, considerable energy harvesting with average output power of about 20 nW can be achieved within wider frequency ranges (with bandwidth up to 90 Hz) by choosing proper parameters. Additionally, the hybrid resonance mechanism of the proposed metamaterials is explained well with an equivalent theoretical model. These novel properties of the proposed metamaterial can be applied in many potential applications in noise control and energy harvesting.",

        "abstract": "Metamaterial provides a promising way to control low-frequency noise, but its narrow bandgap limits its applications. To end this, a membrane-type smart metamaterial with multi-modal sound insulation property is studied. The proposed metamaterial consists of an aluminum membrane bonded with multi-modal resonant piezoelectric resonators. Both simulated and experimental results show that the proposed metamaterial can broaden the locally resonant bandgaps because of the effect of the multi-modal resonance (the percent bandwidths are 0.19 and 0.22 for the lowest mode and higher two modes, respectively). Large multi-modal sound insulations (over 37\u2009dB) are obtained around the designed resonant frequencies in low frequency regime (<2000\u2009Hz) with an ultra-thin thickness (over 1000 times thinner than the acoustic wavelength). It is also demonstrated that the excellent sound insulation property can be tuned by simply adjusting the external circuits instead of modifying the structure itself. The underlying mechanism of the unusual sound insulation of the proposed metamaterial is attributed to the negative effective bending stiffness  derived by the effective medium method. In addition, the parametric study shows that the circuital parameters (capacitances) are inversely related to the sound transmission loss of the proposed multi-resonant metamaterial, which benefits the optimization of insulation effect.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new methodology to determine the position of a magnetically guided robot (MGR) in horizontal planes using magnetic flux sensors. This position determination methodology can be used independently as well as in collaboration with optical sensors in the case of the optical blockage. A combination of linear Hall-effect sensors (two sensors for each axis of motion) was employed to measure the magnetic flux in the MGRu0027s working space. A configuration of several electromagnets was used as a source of magnetic field, and an analytical model of the system is developed. The MGRu0027s position was determined based on the polynomial relation between the Hall-effect sensorsu0027 output and the location of the minimum magnetic potential energy point in horizontal planes. Using the cross-validation method, it was found that a fourth-order polynomial model could accurately predict the MGRu0027s position. Experiments were conducted on a horizontal plane to validate the performance of position estimation using the magnetic flux sensing method. The accuracy of the position determination method was 0.4-mm root-mean-square errors in both the  x - and  y -direction over 8 \u00d7 8\u00a0mm 2  working area. This paper also experimentally validates a combined optical-magnetic position determination technique for the motion control of a magnetically guided robot in optical blockage conditions as unknown environment that can be used as a promising replacement of X-ray and ultrasound techniques.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic navigation microrobotics is a promising technology in micromanipulation and medical applications. A magnetically navigated microrobot (MNM) usually has permanent magnets or ferromagnetic materials attached to it to create interaction force for navigation in the presence of an external magnetic field. During the exploration of the MNM, it is necessary to simultaneously control the position of the MNM and the contact force when the microrobot is constrained by its environment. However, owing to the small size of an MNM and noncontact property of magnetic levitation, installing on-board force sensors is very challenging. This paper presents a dual-axial interaction force determination mechanism that uses magnetic flux measurement, with no need for a conventional on-board force sensor. The interaction force is then used as the feedback force of a position-based impedance controller to actively track the reference force on the MNM in uncertain environment. To reduce the force tracking error caused by environmental uncertainty, an adaptive control algorithm is implemented to generate a reference motion trajectory that attempts to minimize the force error to an acceptable level. The force tracking performance of the robot is experimentally validated. A 2.01\u00a0\u03bcN root mean square force tracking error is reported. The proposed technique can be applied to biomedical microsurgery, such as for cutting tissue with controlled force.",

The LCO possessed reactivity with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and could be used to modify RGO. Maleimide groups could be grafted onto the RGO surface via the Diels-Alder reaction, whereby the mesogenic units enable the LCO to have optical rotation and excellent liquid crystalline properties, while the carboxyl groups could improve the dispersibility of RGO in solvents and disperse more TiO on the surface of modified RGO than on pure RGO. Spectroscopic tools (Raman and XRD) were used to confirm the completion of the reaction. A Fourier transform infrared imaging was utilized to analyze the dispersibility of RGO in the RGO-LCO composites. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to determine the thermal properties of the composites. Due to the excellent thermal property of RGO and the interactions between RGO and LCO, the dispersed RGO can increase the decomposition activation energy and the glass transition of composites. RGO can enhance the photocatalytic degradation of TiO due to its high electron mobility and large specific surface area. By preventing the aggregation of TiO and RGO, thus improving the solubility and dispersion stability of the RGO and increasing the affinity of RGO to TiO, the LCO-modified RGO was better than pure RGO to enhance the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of TiO.",

There were significant pooled effects of different exercise durations on VO2max (within 3 months 95% CI: -2.51 to -1.57; I2=0%; 4-6 months 95% CI: -4.63 to -2.44; I2=0%) and Systolic Blood Pressure (4-6 months 95% CI: 5.55 to 7.52; I2=35%). Additionally, Systolic Blood Pressure was significantly decreased in unhealthy women (95% CI: 5.78 to 8.73; I2=84.3%). The Heart Rate, Total Cholesterol, High Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol and Low Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol\u00a0of untrained women were significantly improved with short-duration, mid-duration and long-duration exercise. Conclusion: There are different effects of exercise duration on cardiovascular health in untrained women aged less than 60 years. The short-duration exercise can improve aerobic capacity in women, but the improvement becomes less with the increase of age. The short-duration, mid-duration and long-duration exercise can improve cholesterol metabolism and decrease Heart Rate in untrained women. The mid-duration exercise can significantly decrease Systolic Blood Pressure in unhealthy women but not in healthy women.",

        "abstract": "A facile, controllable, inexpensive and green electrochemical synthesis of IrO2-graphene nanohybrid thin films is developed to fabricate an easy-to-use integrated paper microfluidic electrochemical pH sensor for resource-limited settings. Taking advantages from both pH meters and strips, the pH sensing platform is composed of hydrophobic barrier-patterned paper micropad (\u00b5PAD) using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), screen-printed electrode (SPE) modified with IrO2-graphene films and molded acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic holder. Repetitive cathodic potential cycling was employed for graphene oxide (GO) reduction which can completely remove electrochemically unstable oxygenated groups and generate a 2D defect-free homogeneous graphene thin film with excellent stability and electronic properties. A uniform and smooth IrO2 film in nanoscale grain size is anodically electrodeposited onto the graphene film, without any observable cracks. The resulting IrO2-RGO electrode showed slightly super-Nernstian responses from pH 2-12 in Britton-Robinson (B-R) buffers with good linearity, small hysteresis, low response time and reproducibility in different buffers, as well as low sensitivities to different interfering ionic species and dissolved oxygen. A simple portable digital pH meter is fabricated, whose signal is measured with a multimeter, using high input-impedance operational amplifier and consumer batteries. The pH values measured with the portable electrochemical paper-microfluidic pH sensors were consistent with those measured using a commercial laboratory pH meter with a glass electrode.",

Methods: For 36 cases of research objectsdiagnosed with APR, the partial inferior turbinectomy and septoplasty was administered.For 6 APR cases among them, the pre- and postoperative observation ofanterior nasal mucosa of the inferior turbinate on the same side under the electronmicroscope was conducted for one year respectively. In addition, their pathologicalalterations of tissues were also conducted. Results: In the pre-operative observationunder the electron microscope, it was found that the nasal mucosae epithelium cellswere nude without cilia. The lamina propria had edema, and mesenchyme presentedthe infiltration of substantial eosinophilic granulocytes, basophilic granulocytes,plasmacytes and mast cells. Additionally, abundant degranulation and vacuolation ofcytoplasts were observed. The plentiful glands, duct ectasia, edema and structuralchanges were also found. Some gland cells had degenerated. After the operation, itwas found that the epithelium nudity still existed and the deficiency of cilia was notimproved. Only a very small amount of microvilli existed. The edema of lamina propriawas improved and eosinophilic granulocytes were rarely observed in mesenchyme.However, the infiltration of basophilic granulocytes, plasmocytes and mastcells was still observed. The particle structure was generally stable and the centralcrystal was clear without degranulation. Meanwhile, the amount of glands was reducedand the tissue structure tended to be recovered.

        "abstract": "We perform comprehensive studies on the fundamental loss mechanisms in III-nitride waveguides in the visible spectral region. Theoretical analysis shows that free carrier loss dominates for GaN under low photon power injection. When optical power increases, the two photon absorption loss becomes important and eventually dominates when photon energy above half-bandgap of GaN. When the dimensions of the waveguides reduce, the sidewall scattering loss will start to dominate. To verify the theoretical results, a high performance GaN-on-sapphire waveguide was fabricated and characterized. Experimental results are consistent with the theoretical findings, showing that under high power injection the optical loss changed significantly for GaN waveguides. A low optical loss ~2 dB/cm was achieved on the GaN waveguide, which is the lowest value ever reported for the visible spectral range. The results and fabrication processes developed in this work pave the way for the development of III-nitride integrated photonics in the visible and potentially ultraviolet spectral range for nonlinear optics and quantum photonics applications.",

        "abstract": "Enabling robust energy benchmarking to reliably locate performance inefficiency for upgrading is critical to the success of building retrofitting programs in building sector. Multi-criteria benchmarking is emerging as a more rational option over the traditional single-angle method to assess building performance which is fundamentally of multi-factor nature. Particularly, with its easier concept, the compromise Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) based multi-angle benchmarking appears attractive. Nevertheless, existing TOPSIS based procedures tend to ignore the common issue of multicollinearity trap which could result in misleading decisions. Meanwhile, variable clustering renders an empirical alternative for handling multicollinearity with high traceability. Combining with information-oriented Shannon entropy, this paper develops an iterative Clustering around Latent Variables (CLV) based objective entropy weighted TOPSIS approach for benchmarking building energy performance in a multi-factor manner. It essentially integrates the benefits of variable clustering to address multicollinearity with information theory for objective weighting on decision attributes in order to pursue TOPSIS benchmarking accuracy. A 324-dwelling case shows the robustness of the constructed procedure in a temporally dynamic context.",

        "abstract": "We study verticalGaN p-n and Schottky power diodes with different buffer layer thicknesses grown on free-standingGaN substrates, using metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. High breakdown voltage of u003e 1 kV and low specific on-resistance of 3    $text{m}Omega cdot $   cm   $^{2}$    are achieved on GaN p-n diode with    $1~mu text{m}$    buffer layer and    $9~mu text{m}$    drift layer without passivation or field plate. Detailed device analysis on GaN Schottky diodes indicates that buffer layer has significant impacts on the electrical properties of drift layer and thus device performances of GaN p-n diodes. A thicker buffer layer will significantly enhance the breakdown voltages of these devices, which is possibly due to the improved material quality of drift layers with reduced defect densities. Higher doping concentration in drift layer with thicker buffer layer will, however, lower breakdown voltage. More discussions reveal improving the material quality of drift layer plays amore dominant role in achieving high breakdown GaN-on-GaN p-n and Schottky diodes with increasing buffer layer thickness.",

The optical properties and photovoltaic performance of the nonpolar and semipolar InGaN solar cells were systematically studied, and the results were compared to the conventional polar c-plane devices. The absorption spectra, current density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) characteristics, external quantum efficiency (EQE), and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) were measured for nonpolar m-plane, semipolar ( 20 2 \u00af 1 ) plane, and polar c-plane InGaN/GaN MQW solar cells. Nonpolar m-plane InGaN/GaN MQW solar cells showed the best performance across all devices, with a high open-circuit voltage of 2.32\u2009V, a low bandgap-voltage offset of 0.59\u2009V, and the highest EQE and IQE. In contrast, the polar c-plane device showed the lowest EQE despite the highest absorption spectra. This huge difference is attributed to the better carrier transport and collection o...",

The dispersion relation, mode profile, energy density    $W$   of electromagnetic field, cavity quality factor   $Q$  , and effective mode area    $A_{e,f,f}$   are theoretically investigated. The results show that although the strongest confinement of the field is achieved by surface plasmon modes at GaN/Ag interface, the energy density   $W$   is small inside the cavity, leading to a high effective mode area. Additionally, the cavity without metallic coating has the highest   $Q$   factors since no metal loss is involved. These results can serve as guidelines for the design and fabrication of high efficiency and high speed LEDs for the applications of solid-state lighting and visible-light communication.",

A typical Z-scan technique was used for the measurement with a femtosecond Ti:S laser from wavelengths of 724\u2009nm to 840\u2009nm. For the two-photon absorption coefficient ( \u03b2), similar values were obtained for polar, nonpolar, and semipolar samples, which are characterized to be \u223c0.90\u2009cm/GW at 724\u2009nm and \u223c0.65\u2009cm/GW at 730\u2009nm for all the three samples. For the Kerr nonlinear refractive index ( n kerr), self-focusing features were observed in this work, which is different from previous reports where self-defocusing features were observed on GaN in the visible and near-UV spectral regions.

This device shows a 3-dB electrical-to-optical modulation bandwidth of 92.7 MHz. IEEE 802.11ac modulation scheme with 80 MHz bandwidth, as an entry level of the fifth generation of Wi-Fi, was employed to use the micro-LED bandwidth efficiently. These practical techniques were successfully utilized to achieve a demonstration of line-of-sight (LOS) VLC at a speed of 433 Mbps and a bit error rate (BER) of 10\u22125 with a free space transmit distance 3.6 m. Besides this, we demonstrated directed NLOS VLC links based on mirror reflections with a data rate of 433 Mbps and a BER of 10\u22124. For non-directed NLOS VLC using a print paper as the reflection material, 16 QAM, 195 Mbps data rate, and a BER of 10\u22125 were achieved.",

The device structure mimics the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology, consisting of thin    $n$   -AlN epilayer as the device active region and thick resistive AlN underlayer as the insulator. At room temperature, the devices show outstanding performances with a low turn-ON voltage of 1.2 V, a high ON/OFF ratio of    $sim 10^{5}$   , a low ideality factor of 5.5, and a low reverse leakage current below 1 nA. The devices also exhibit excellent thermal stability over 500 K owing to the ultra-wide bandgap of AlN. The breakdown voltage of the devices can be further improved by employing field plate, edge termination technologies, and optimizing the SOI-like device structure. This letter presents a cost-effective route to high performance AlN-based Schottky barrier diodes for high-power, high-voltage, and high-temperature applications.",

Through a case study of students from one academic writing course in an urban university in China and primarily qualitative analysis of interviews with students, written artifacts, and students\u2019 reflections, it was found that the selection and use of on-line learning resources, guided by the teacher\u2019s SFL perspective on writing as a meaning-making process, facilitated students\u2019 transition. That is, students gained a principled perspective on the use of on-line resources and were able to use pertinent knowledge in producing effective academic writing. The study concludes that the pedagogical use of on-line resources, when supported by SFL, could transform students\u2019 perception of the value of on-line materials and improve their self-efficacy as academic writers.",

By drawing on the written documents of four students written, and on interviews conducted with these students over an academic semester in an EFL writing course, this qualitative study, through content analysis and discourse analysis, shows that the SFL theory-based material adoption did a good job of supporting EFL students in their internalization of language knowledge from both open educational resources and traditional textbooks, while also enabling students to use materials flexibly instead of passively following along with the content in the mandatory textbook. The flexibility of the students participating in the study was particularly reflected by their ability to construct principled knowledge informed by SFL and to independently apply such knowledge to effectively navigate literacy practices (e.g., critical construction and deconstruction of discourses).",

The study draws on qualitative content analyses of the teacher\u2019s reflections, interviews, and classroom interactions. The results show that through SFL-based distance education, the teacher, interacting with his agency, overcame multiple constraints and developed academically in terms of how to understand valued academic writing. Additionally, the teacher also harnessed this newfound knowledge to support students\u2019 socialization into academic English discourse. The study concludes the effectiveness of SFL-based distance education for English writing teachers in similarly constrained contexts, which could be enhanced by teachers\u2019 agency. Implications of the study include synergizing the SFL-based curriculum with distance teacher education so that language educators can better assist students in gaining the knowledge needed for navigating academic English literacy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The formulation and inkjet printing of constantan ink is described. Due to the small nozzle sizes which are used for inkjet printing, nano-sized particles are typically required for ink formulation. However, it is well-known that most metallic nanoparticles would form an oxide layer on the surface during the nanoparticle fabrication process. In this work, a simple chemical process has been developed to remove the oxidation and cure the printed patterns. Ammonia chloride (NH 4 Cl) is used to etch the surface oxidation and nanoparticles can be sintered together with thiourea dioxide (TD) additive which reduces the sintering process temperature. The resistivity of synthesized constantan sensor is around 4\u00a0\u03bc\u03a9\u00a0m and temperature coefficient is as same as the bulk constantan. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) show that the oxidation has been removed/ reduced successfully. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) result shows that printed particles are sintered very well; relative high resistivity is caused by the porous structure. The low temperature sintering is attributed to the reduced copper and nickel from etched oxidation surfaces. The reduced copper and nickel small particles have high surface energy and tend to sinter with each other; this process can cause solid diffusion among constantan particles. This process has been proved by Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Differential thermal analysis (DTA). Chemical reduction sintering method can also be used to sinter alloy particles at low temperature and make printed alloy sensors on flexible substrates.",

The effect of polarization of the Si doped HfO2 layer on photovoltaic properties of this ferroelectric-semiconductor system was investigated. Piezoresponse force microscopy method provided clear evidence for ferroelectric properties of HfO2 films with 10\u2009nm thickness. Kelvin probe force microscopy showed that change in the surface potential of the negatively poled sample due to illumination is opposite to the response from unpoled and positively poled samples. Transport measurements also revealed a significant difference between photo-responses of the ferroelectric films that were polarized in opposite directions.",

In conventional pulse elasto-magnetic measurements, the feature parameters in frequency domain are seldom discussed. In this study, attempts are made to seek new parameters in frequency domain which are mainly influenced by cable tension force and less sensitive to temperature. A custom-developed pulse elasto-magnetic instrument is employed to conduct cable tension monitoring in the construction stage of a cable-stayed bridge. The field testing results show that only after temperature compensation, the monitoring results of the feature parameters extracted from the magnetic characteristic curve can reflect the stepped changes of cable tension force. Surprisingly, a new frequency-domain parameter, the summation of spectra amplitudes in a carefully selected frequency range, is found to be insensitive to temperature and can well reflect the stepped change behavior of cable tension force.

        "abstract": "Induction coils are an important device for magnetic field measurement, and they are widely applied in the electromagnetic non-destructive testing and magnetotelluric measurement because of the simple structure and reliable performance, such as Barkhausen noise and eddy current testing. However, the self-capacitance of induction coils largely determines their performance especially at high frequencies, such as sensitivity to the variation of the magnetic field and the operation frequency range. To accurately predict the self-capacitance of multi-layer circular-section induction coils with hexagonal winding, an analytical model is proposed in this paper. The comparative study between the existing models and the new hexagonal model indicates that the hexagonal model has the higher prediction accuracy for the induction coils with standard or flyback winding. Moreover, the dependencies of the self-capacitance on the geometrical and winding parameters are investigated for the purpose of optimizing the self-capacitance of multi-layer circular-section induction coils.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The varying intensity of the East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) governs the strength of the counter-clockwise surface circulation of the South Yellow Sea and the redistribution of sediment and terrestrial organic material that had accumulated on the shallow shelf during the summer season into the central part of that basin. We compiled a time series spanning about 6.3 ka of terrestrial lignin proxies from sediment core N02 from Central Yellow Sea Mud that has well-preserved high-resolution sedimentary records (24 yr/cm average spacing). The \u201chydrodynamic sorting effect\u201d driven by century-scale climate variation in the strength of the EAWM exerts the main underlying control on the variation of lignin proxies in marginal sea sediments, rather than paleovegetation variability in provenance region driven by the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM). Our lignin proxies data imply that North Atlantic climate forcing recorded by ice-rafted debris (\u201cBond cycles\u201d) played a critical role in generating EAWM variability on these centennial timescales during the Holocene. These variations of lignin records are superimposed on general multi-thousand-year trends that appear to mirror the relative frequency and intensity of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Our results indicate that lignin can be adopted as an additional reliable proxy for paleoclimate evolution, at least in South Yellow Sea area.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Sediment core A02 collected from the central Yellow Sea mud (CYSM) was analyzed for various lignin parameters to provide evidence for the paleoclimate changes in the southern Yellow Sea (SYS) area during the Holocene. The results showed that the variations of various lignin parameters were dominated by the hydrodynamic sorting process driven by climate factors, and in turn lignin records can well reflect paleoclimate changes during the Holocene. The paleovegetation of the Yellow River basin was dominated by nonwoody angiosperms, and the terrestrial organic matter in core A02 was highly degraded and mainly came from peat and surface soils. Compared with climate records in previous studies, we found that terrestrial organic matter indicator \u01a98, marine organic matter indicator P phenols and vegetation parameters S/V, C/V ratios had the similar variation trends with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the millennial time scale and correlated well with the Bond events (0 to 6) and the East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) on the multidecadal to centennial time scale. ENSO events dominated the long-term trends of the biomarkers in the SYS during the Holocene while EAWM for the shorter time scale. Lignin records of core A02 responded not only to the regional climatic factors such as the EAWM but also to the global climatic factors such as Bond events and ENSO. In addition to the global cold climate events, it also recorded other regional cold events (at around 3.7\u00a0cal. kyr\u00a0B.P., 6.5\u00a0cal. kyr\u00a0B.P. and 7.0\u00a0cal. kyr\u00a0B.P.) and coincided well with previous related records in the East Asian. These proved that the paleoclimate in SYS area was controlled by both regional and global climatic factors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Koi sleepy disease (KSD), also known as carp edema virus (CEV) disease, is an important, largely acute infection of common carp and ornamental koi ( Cyprinus carpio ). Since the first report of KSD in Japan in the 1970s, the disease has spread to many countries including England, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, the Czech Republic, Austria, Poland, and India. In the spring of 2015, a koi farm in Hangzhou experienced an outbreak of an infectious disease. In this study we conducted clinical, histopathological, and molecular diagnostic analyses to determine the cause of the outbreak. CEV was found to be the causative agent of the disease. Moreover, PCR sequencing and phylogenetic analyses revealed that CEV was the extremely likely etiological agent of the mortality in this outbreak, which was further confirmed by sequence analysis of the PCR products obtained after nested PCR of the degenerate PCR. We also found that temperature is an important factor affecting carp morbidity and mortality in CEV infection. This is the first report of the detection of CEV in relation to KSD outbreaks in China. Our findings highlight the need for research on the CEV genome to better characterize the spread of CEV.",

Based on introducing the structure of the robot, finite element analysis of the robot structure based on SolidWorks/simulation is performed in this paper, so as to verify whether the structure meets requirements of strength and stiffness or not. Then, by SolidWorks/simulation, modal analysis of the robot is done, so that the inherent frequency and modal characteristics of the robot can be obtained, which has practical significance to avoid resonance in operating frequency range. These analysis based on SolidWorks/simulation are meaningful to judge whether safety, reliability and stability of the designed robot or not. It reduces the production cost, shorten the development cycle and improve the product quality.",

        "abstract": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a modern useful tool of bypassing usual channels of muscle and peripheral nervous system to establish a direct connection between brain and external devices and to restore fundamental communication and control skills. Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), as one of the most popular EEG modality, has been widely used in BCI applications. For SSVEP BCI, the most challenging task is to effectively improve the accuracy, especially in minimum number of recording electrodes and short stimulation duration. In this study, a novel multi-channel integrated GT 2  circ  statistic method was proposed for the frequency recognition in a four-class steady-state motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP)-based BCI. The proposed method was compared with the widely used canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and verified with three-channel EEG data from three healthy subjects. Results indicated that a higher recognition performance with shorter recording time and few electrodes can be achieved by using of this novel method rather than CCA method, making multi-channel integrated GT 2  circ  statistic a robust approach for the implementation of SSVEP BCIs.",

Accurate trajectory tracking ability is the base of the exoskeleton mechanical leg to coordinately drive trainers to do rehabilitation training on the treadmill. In this paper, aiming at the existing exoskeleton body, taking into account the uncertain factors such as the modeling errors and the environment, the position controller is designed based on different gait events. During the swing phase, the kinetic model of the robot is basically determined, and the position controller is designed by using the sliding mode control (SMC) method, and the fuzzy compensation method is introduced to reduce disturbances; during the stand phase, as the introduction of treadmill contact force, the kinetic model cannot be determined, then, the cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) is used as feedforward control, and the PID control is introduced as feedback to ensure the stability of the control system; finally, the above methods are mixed by the position segmentation. The simulation results show that the proposed method has good trajectory tracking ability and stability in the presence of modeling errors and other disturbances when compared with the traditional computed torque control.",

        "abstract": "Brain control technology can restore communication between the brain and a prosthesis, and choosing a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) paradigm to evoke electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is an essential step for developing this technology. In this paper, the Scene Graph paradigm used for controlling prostheses was proposed; this paradigm is based on Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) regarding the Scene Graph of a subject's intention. A mathematic model was built to predict SSVEPs evoked by the proposed paradigm and a sinusoidal stimulation method was used to present the Scene Graph stimulus to elicit SSVEPs from subjects. Then, a 2-degree of freedom (2-DOF) brain-controlled prosthesis system was constructed to validate the performance of the Scene Graph-SSVEP (SG-SSVEP)-based BCI. The classification of SG-SSVEPs was detected via the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) approach. To assess the efficiency of proposed BCI system, the performances of traditional SSVEP-BCI system were compared. Experimental results from six subjects suggested that the proposed system effectively enhanced the SSVEP responses, decreased the degradation of SSVEP strength and reduced the visual fatigue in comparison with the traditional SSVEP-BCI system. The average signal to noise ratio (SNR) of SG-SSVEP was 6.31\u00b12.64 dB, versus 3.38\u00b10.78 dB of traditional-SSVEP. In addition, the proposed system achieved good performances in prosthesis control. The average accuracy was 94.58%\u00b17.05%, and the corresponding high information transfer rate (IRT) was 19.55\u00b13.07 bit/min. The experimental results revealed that the SG-SSVEP based BCI system achieves the good performance and improved the stability relative to the conventional approach.",

        "abstract": "One of the most exciting areas of rehabilitation research is brain-controlled prostheses, which translate electroencephalography (EEG) signals into control commands that operate prostheses. However, the existing brain-control methods have an obstacle between the selection of brain computer interface (BCI) and its performance. In this paper, a novel BCI system based on a facial expression paradigm is proposed to control prostheses that uses the characteristics of theta and alpha rhythms of the prefrontal and motor cortices. A portable brain-controlled prosthesis system was constructed to validate the feasibility of the facial-expression-based BCI (FE-BCI) system. Four types of facial expressions were used in this study. An effective filtering algorithm based on noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD) and sample entropy (SampEn) was used to remove electromyography (EMG) artifacts. A wavelet transform (WT) was applied to calculate the feature set, and a back propagation neural network (BPNN) was employed as a classifier. To prove the effectiveness of the FE-BCI system for prosthesis control, 18 subjects were involved in both offline and online experiments. The grand average accuracy over 18 subjects was 81.31 \u00b1 5.82% during the online experiment. The experimental results indicated that the proposed FE-BCI system achieved good performance and can be efficiently applied for prosthesis control.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) have been utilized widely in applied fields, such as the speller, wheelchair control, prosthesis control, industrial robot and so on. Various paradigms were designed to improve BCI performance. However, the relationship between control objects and SSVEP paradigm has been neglected. In this study, we proposed a new object-oriented SSVEP-BCI paradigm. This paradigm used continuous action scene of controlled object to replace traditional stimulus to stimulate the generation of SSVEP, which improve SSVEP recognition accuracy and realize the more user-friendly BCI system of \u201cwhat you see is what you get\u201d. The SSVEP-BCI system for controlling a 2DOFs prosthesis hand was customized as an example and four healthy subjects were recruited for our experiments. Firstly, Electroencephalogram (EEG) data was analyzed in frequency domain and time-frequency domain. Results show that significantly strong SSVEP was elicited. Then canonical correlation analysis (CCA) algorithm was used for SSVEP recognition. Experimental results show that the mean recognition accuracy and ITR (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) in short time window (1-2s) reached  $87.66pm 2.09%$  and  $28.51pm 5.63$  bits/min respectively, which was comparable or even better than the performances of conventional four-choice SSVEP-based BCIs. Finally, the paradigm is universal and can be applied to various SSVEP-BCI fields. Taken together, these results suggest that the proposed paradigm is a promising option in BCI applications.",

        "title": "Debugging Multithreaded Programs as if They Were Sequential.",
        "abstract": "Debugging multithread programs is extremely difficult because the basic assumption that underlies sequential program debugging, that is, the program behavior is deterministic under a fixed input, is no longer valid due to the nondeterminism attributed to thread scheduling. It is because the programs behavior is non-deterministic due to the nondeterminism of parallel execution, which makes debugging or testing multithreaded programs extremely difficult. In this paper, we propose a proactive debugging method to restore this basic assumption so that programmers can debug multithreaded programs as if they were sequential. Our approach is based on the synergistic integration of symbolic analysis and dynamic analysis techniques. In particular, symbolic analysis investigates the program behavior under the same input to search whether there is a thread schedule would trigger a bug or a not-yet-explored path. Dynamic analysis is to execute these new paths with the guide of the generated thread schedules, thereby further guiding the symbolic analysis. The net effect of applying this feedback loop is a systematic and complete coverage of the program behavior under a fixed test input. We implement the proposed approach in a prototype tool called proactive-debugger. Our experiments show that proactive-debugger outperforms both ESBMC and Maple, which are two powerful and well-known testing tools for failure detection in multithreaded programs.",

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of Android malware poses great challenges to anti-malware systems because the sheer number of malware samples overwhelm malware analysis systems. A promising approach for speeding up malware analysis is to classify malware samples into families so that the common features in malwares belonging to the same family can be exploited for malware detection and inspection. However, the accuracy of existing classification solutions is limited because of two reasons. First, since the majority of Android malware is constructed by inserting malicious components into popular apps, the malwareu0027s legitimate part may misguide the classification algorithms. Second, the polymorphic variants of Android malware could evade the detection by employing transformation attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that constructs frequent subgraph (fregraph) to represent the common behaviors of malwares in the same family for familial classification of Android malware. Moreover, we propose and develop FalDroid, an automatic system for classifying Android malware according to fregraph, and apply it to 6,565 malware samples from 30 families. The experimental results show that FalDroid can correctly classify 94.5% malwares into their families using around 4.4s per app.",

        "abstract": "With the advent of multicore processors, there is a trend towards multithreading to take advantage of parallel computing resources. Due to greatly increased complexity, programmers need effective testing methodology that can thoroughly test multithreaded programs. There has been significant progress based on symbolic execution that attempts to exhaustively explore all the intra-thread paths and inter-thread interleavings. However, such testing approach faces two insuperable challenges. Firstly, exploring an astronomically large number of paths and interleavings limits its scalability. Secondly, a path itself does not directly help programmers understand program behavior. In this paper, we propose an alternate testing methodology that focuses on definition-use data flow instead of paths/interleavings. Such approach not only leads to orders of magnitude reduction in testing complexity, but also gives programmers direct help on examining the shared variable usage in a multithreaded program.",

In order to provide a scientific basis for China Earthquake Planning and construction of mitigation structures, this paper focuses on China earthquake disaster risk assessment and relief materials allocation of the Central Reserve System (CRS) based on the result. Taking into account of four factors for the formation of China's earthquake disaster risk, seismic hazard, exposure, vulnerability and disaster prevention and reduction capacity, we applied GIS technology and natural disaster risk assessment methods. From geography, disaster science, environmental science and viewpoints on knowledge from other subject visions, earthquake disaster risk assessment index system was proposed. The system was used to assess the risk of earthquakes in different counties and the contribution of risk factors, and the map for China earthquake disaster risk level was completed. The service area of CRS was figured out using network analysis method in ArcGIS software on rail and road in China. Based on the number of people to be transferred in emergency according to China earthquake disaster risk level, relief materials allocation of the CRS can be given.",

The problems of how these two disaster types distribute and what disaster-forming environments are important to their occurrence are the most pressing problems in disaster risk assessment and salvage material arrangement. The present study aims to establish the regularity of flood/snow disaster outbreaks and the important disaster-forming environmental factors, and a spatial autocorrelation analysis method and a canonical correlation analysis method are used to answer these two questions separately. Experimental results indicate that serious flood disasters distribute mainly on the south area of China and snow disasters occur on the north area; those areas should be allocated correspondingly more salvage materials.

        "abstract": "Various remote sensing-based drought indices have been developed during the past decades. These indices have their own applicability. Examination of adaption associated with limitations in drought indices would be useful for index selection and improvement. In this study, five drought indices (e.g. the temperature condition index (TCI), vegetation condition index (VCI), vegetation health index (VHI), temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), drought severity index (DSI)) generated by time series of MODIS data, which include 8-day MOD11 LST products, MOD13 NDVI products and MOD16 ET/PET products at 1km resolution from 2000 to 2012, were performed in Henan, and Shaanxi province in the northern China, aiming to better understand the differences and potential monitoring ability among these drought indices. 8-day drought indices were compared against winter wheat yield at the prefecture-city scale from 2000 to 2012. Results showed that TVDI outperformed the five drought indices in correlation with winter wheat yield, and followed by DSI, and next is the VHI, whereas TCI and VCI have the lowest correlation. Furthermore, during the winter wheat growth period, drought shows varying agricultural impacts on winter wheat yield at different phenological stages, jointing-heading stage and flowering-filling stage have higher correlations than others, and the highest correlation coefficient can reach 0.8, which indicated that winter wheat requires more water during these stages. As a result, the sensitive phenological stages can be used as the key period for effective agricultural drought monitoring. And during the two highest correlation growth period \u2014 jointing-heading stage and flowering-filling stage, higher correlations were found between TVDI and the winter wheat yield, which the correlation coefficient can reach 0.5. Furthermore, the correlation between drought indices and yield in Shaanxi province is generally stronger than that of Henan province, which showed that remote sensing drought indices have a better indication in rain fed area on drought.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To estimate regional-scale winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) yield, we developed a data-assimilation scheme that assimilates remotely sensed reflectance into a coupled crop growth\u2013radiative transfer model. We generated a time series of 8-day, 30-m-resolution synthetic Kalman Smoothed reflectance by combining MODIS surface reflectance products with Landsat surface reflectance using a KS algorithm. We evaluated the assimilation performance using datasets with different spatial and temporal scales (e.g., three dates for the 30-m Landsat reflectance, 8-day and 1-km MODIS surface reflectance, and 8-day and 30-m synthetic KS reflectance) into the coupled WOFOST\u2013PROSAIL model. Then we constructed a four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVar) cost function to account for differences between the observed and simulated reflectance. We used the shuffled complex evolution\u2013University of Arizona (SCE-UA) algorithm to minimize the 4DVar cost function and optimize important input parameters of the coupled model. The optimized parameters were used to drive WOFOST and estimate county-level winter wheat yield in a region of China. By assimilating the synthetic KS reflectance data, we achieved the most accurate yield estimates ( R  2 \u2009=\u20090.44, 0.39, and 0.30; RMSE\u2009=\u2009598, 1288, and 595\u2009kg/ha for 2009, 2013, and 2014, respectively), followed by Landsat reflectance ( R  2 \u2009=\u20090.21, 0.22, and 0.33; RMSE\u2009=\u2009915, 1422, and 637\u2009kg/ha for 2009, 2013, and 2014, respectively) and MODIS reflectance ( R  2 \u2009=\u20090.49, 0.05, and 0.22; RMSE\u2009=\u20091136, 1468, and 700\u2009kg/ha for 2009, 2013, and 2014, respectively) at the county level. Thus, our method improves the reliability of regional-scale crop yield estimates.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTResearchers are continually finding new applications of satellite images because of the growing number of high-resolution images with wide spatial coverage. However, the cost of these images is sometimes high, and their temporal resolution is relatively coarse. Crowdsourcing is an increasingly common source of data that takes advantage of local stakeholder knowledge and that provides a higher frequency of data. The complementarity of these two data sources suggests there is great potential for mutually beneficial integration. Unfortunately, there are still important gaps in crowdsourced satellite image analysis by means of crowdsourcing in areas such as land cover classification and emergency management. In this paper, we summarize recent efforts, and discuss the challenges and prospects of satellite image analysis for geospatial applications using crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing can be used to improve satellite image analysis and satellite images can be used to organize crowdsourced efforts for coll...",

        "abstract": "Lodging in maize, which is the result of the genotype-by-environment interactions, causes severe yield losses annually. There are many studies on lodging resistance of maize varieties now, but information about maize planting environment lodging stress is very rare. The environment lodging stress, which is a result of various factors, is characterized by uncertainty. Fuzzy sets theory and fuzzy logic are advantageous for dealing with the questions with uncertainties. The objective of this study is to assess the environment lodging stress for maize planting. Based on the daily weather data in the recent 59 years (1951-2009) and soil data, five counties (or cities) in ShanDong Province and HeNan Province in Huang-Huai-Hai-Plain, China, are selected as study sites; the maximum wind speed, rainfall, and potassium content in soil are chosen as stress indicators, and the overall stress level of each study site is obtained by a fuzzy synthetic evaluation approach. The consistency is shown between our calculation results and the results obtained with actual survey data on lodging in maize, indicating that the employed model is a promising approach for assessing environment lodging stress, and providing a scientific basis for maize variety extension and recommendation and comprehensive management to reduce maize planting risk and loss.",

The latitude, longitude and elevation of each station were used as input variables of BPN, and the accumulated temperature as output variable. Other key network parameters, such as learning rate, momentum, the number of hidden nodes, and the learning iterations, were optimized using a trial and error approach. The optimized BPN model was compared with the multiple linear regression (MLR) model. In summary, BPN model was generally more accurate than MLR model. This infers that artificial neural network models are more applicable than regression models when predicting accumulated temperature.",

        "abstract": "Lodging is one of the major problems in maize production which causes severe yield loss every year all over the world. In the present study, the lodging suitability of different maize varieties in target growing environments was investigated based on geographical information science. A total of 401 maize planting counties in northeast China and northern China were selected as study areas. The mean and standard deviation of environment accumulated temperature in vegetative stage of maize were calculated from raw temperature data obtained from 167 meteorology stations in these areas. The variety lodging resistance was determined based on the data of national regional variety trials for maize, and the environment lodging stress was measured using field survey data on lodging. Probability analysis based on the calculated values of environment accumulated temperature in vegetative stage of maize was utilized to determine whether a maize variety can be physically mature in a planting county, and lodging suitability of the variety was evaluated with geographical information science combining variety lodging resistance and local environment lodging stress together. A new maize variety NH1101 was taken as an example to illustrate the modeling and calculating procedures. The result shows that, from southwest to northeast of the study areas, the overall suitability trend changes from nonsuitable to suitable, then to not very suitable. And it is demonstrated that the lodging suitability is not only related to the variety resistance but also to the local environment stress. \u00a9 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

        "abstract": "Previous analyses on variety yield have usually focused on regression coefficients as an indicator to measure the stability and adaptation of a specific variety under experimental conditions. Due to the huge differences between experimental plots and farm fields, the model results from experimental plots can hardly be applied to farm fields. In this study, a regression analysis was conducted between the variety yield and an on-trial environment index (the mean yield of all varieties in the same test site). Then, using the average proportional coefficient between the on-trial environment index and the on-farm environment index (the statistical maize production yield of the growing county containing the test site) as a bridge, the on-farm environment index was converted to the corresponding on-trial environment index, which was then applied to the regression model generated from the on-trial plot-scale data. This procedure ensured the homogeneity of the model parameters and successfully predicted the yield of maize varieties under a target environment. The procedure also produced the 95% confidence interval predicted yield, making the results more practically significant. By introducing the proportional coefficient and confidence interval, the new approach provides a feasible solution for studying the performance of varieties under on-farm conditions. Finally, we used the maize variety NH1101 as an example to illustrate the modeling procedures. The results indicated that the model produced promising results. The new method provides direct support for variety recommendation, and facilitates the identification of better-adapted varieties.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The current detection methods for maize seed damage and viability assessment are usually time-consuming, tedious, and costly. In this investigation, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), a nondestructive and rapid analytical method, was explored to analyze frost-damaged and non-viable seeds. Principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS) and orthogonal linear discriminant analysis (OLDA) were combined to extract feature from near infrared (NIR) spectra. PLS\u00a0+\u00a0OLDA can extract difference characteristics of normal and frost-damaged seeds more efficiently than PCA\u00a0+\u00a0OLDA. Three classification algorithms were utilized and compared: Support vector machine (SVM), biomimetic pattern recognition (BPR), and mahalanobis distance (MD). BPR can classify normal and frost-damaged seeds better and achieved the highest average accuracy of 97%. Discrimination model of viable and non-viable seeds in frost-damaged seeds based on SVM, BPR and MD were built and achieved accuracies of 94%, 97.25% and 89.5% respectively. BPR model yielded the most correct value in predicting germination rate of validation set, and improved the germination rate of validation set dramatically from 27.5% to 100% by screening out non-viable seeds. NIRS and chemometrics as demonstrated in this paper can provide a novel method which can assess and improve quality of maize seed quickly and inexpensively.",

Nowadays, mobile geographic information system (GIS) applications are extensively used in collecting field data to enhance the decision-making ability of investigators while on the field. However, although the traditional object-oriented mode for developing GIS functions generally follows a modular approach to reduce repeated tasks, this mode still cannot take advantage of the fact that GIS requirements are similar for different data-collection applications. Furthermore, changing data formats or contents requires a demanding program modification workload. In this article, a component, which can be embedded into different applications for collecting field data to provide mobile GIS functions, is designed and implemented. This component provides different types of interfaces. Moreover, it can adapt dynamically to different applications by modifying these interfaces. The developed component is tested by using it to provide GIS functions to three different applications, namely, locust data collection, land-quality data collection and land reclamation engineering inspection. Result shows that the component exhibits advantages such as high development efficiency, ease of application, low power consumption, and extension flexibility. The shortcomings and issues of the component, as well as suggestions for future work, are also presented.",

        "title": "Spatial sampling of multi-environment trials data for station layout of maize variety",
        "abstract": "Classification methodology is widely used by plant breeders to group environments on the results of regional evaluation trials to assist selection among genotypes. To be effective, Multi-environment trial (MET) is a key point for breeders to test productivity and adaptability of crop varieties. With the development of science and technology in breeding, for METs at any stage of a breeding program, the breeder is dealing with a finite sample of environments that sample a relatively small subset of potential geographical and crop management conditions in a limited number of years. The general term \u2018enviro typing\u2019, used as a complement to the more familiar terms genotyping and phenotyping, is classifying the environments (location-year-management combinations) within a MET to assess how they represent target population of environments. However, the planting environment is complex and varied. Therefore, on one hand, the challenges associated with conducting METs in a finite number of years to predict genotype-trait performance in the target population-environment are crucial. On the other hand, it is also very important to ensure the accuracy of MET and decrease the loss of seed promotion to have a good understanding of the type of the planting environment and make reasonable decision to set the station of METs. In the paper, we mainly study on a new spatial sampling method of multi-environment trial layout and take maize in Jilin province in China for example. According to characteristics of METs, the algorithm combined with spatially stratified sampling and spatial balanced random sampling, which set a reasonable scheme of spatial distribution of MET station for maize. The main steps are as follows: Firstly, we build an index system for the classification of maize environment with sufficiently detailed data such as weather, soil, DEM, road network, cultivated area, actively accumulated temperature, precipitation, the sunshine duration during the whole growing period and gradient. Secondly, we develop methods for identifying the optimal numbers of classes for the planting environment and use spatially stratified sampling model to calculate the minimum number of stations to meet the requirements. Finally, the method was applied to the spatial distribution of MET station for maize in Jilin province, and compute the optimal number of clusters for planting environment and METs stations number, which are 5 and 25, respectively. The result is roughly consistent with the existing MET station for maize with the sample precision of 94.5%, and have a certain reference significance for the layout of MET stations for maize in Jilin province.",

        "abstract": "False seeds can often be seen in the maize seed market, leading to a serious decline in maize yield.  Those existing variety identification methods are expensive, time consuming, and destructive to seeds.  The aim of this study is to develop a cheap, fast and non-destructive method which can robustly identify large amounts of maize seed varieties based on near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) and chemometrics.  Because it is difficult to establish models for every variety in the market, this study mainly investigated the performance of models based on a large number of samples (more than 40 major varieties in the market).  The reflectance spectra of maize seeds were collected by two modes (bulk kernels mode and single kernel mode).  Both collection modes can be applied to identification, but only the single kernel mode can be applied to purity sorting.  The spectra were pretreated with smoothing, the first derivative and vector normalization; and then principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and biomimetic pattern recognition (BPR) were applied to establish identification models.  The environmental factors such as producing areas and years have a significant influence on the performance of the models.  Therefore, the method to improve the robustness of the models was investigated in this study.  New indexes (correct acceptance degree (CAD), correct rejection degree (CRD) and correct degree (CD)) were defined to analyze the performance of the models more accurately.  Finally, the models obtained a mean correct discrimination rate of over 90%, and exhibited robust properties for samples harvested from different areas and years.  The results showed that NIR technology combined with chemometrics methods such as PCA, LDA, and BPR could be a suitable and alternative technique to identify the authenticity of maize seed varieties.Keywords: maize, seed variety identification, near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS), biomimetic pattern recognition (BPR)DOI: 10.25165/j.ijabe.20181102.2815Citation: Cui Y J, Xu L J, An D, Liu Z, Gu J C, Li S M, et al.

        "abstract": "Variety regional tests based on multiple environments play a critical role in understanding the high yield and adaptability of new crop varieties. However, the current approach mainly depends on experience from breeding experts and is difficulty to promote because of inconsistency between testing and actual situation. We propose a spatial layout method based on the existing systematic regional test network. First, the method of spatial clustering was used to cluster the planting environment. Then, we used spatial stratified sampling to determine the minimum number of test sites in each type of environment. Finally, combined with the factors such as the convenience of transportation and the planting area, we used spatial balance sampling to generate the layout of multi-environment test sites. We present a case study for maize in Jilin Province and show the utility of the method with an accuracy of about 94.5%. The experimental results showed that 66.7% of sites are located in the same county and the unbalanced layout of original sites is improved. Furthermore, we conclude that the set of operational technical ideas for carrying out the layout of multi-environment test sites based on crop varieties in this paper can be applied to future research.",

        "abstract": "Managing computation resources in a cost-effective way has become the core competence for a Cloud provider to win over the market because of the \"pay-as-you-go\" business model. Therefore, VM placement has become more and more important in the research and practices of VM management by determining at what condition and on which physical server a VM should be placed so that the SLA can be guaranteed and servers' utilization can be improved. Much existing work simply formulates the above issue to be a bin-packing problem, which does not take the VM relationships into account. However, the relationship information can greatly impact the SLA of the Cloud system and the resource utilization. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a relationship-based VM placement framework, SmartCRS, to optimize the VM placement procedure. SmartCRS reveals the relationships between VMs automatically. Then by using such information and based on a constraint library, it gives a proper VM placement plan. Finally, the plan is carried out by SmartCRS automatically or by Cloud administrators manually to improve the server utilization and guarantee the required SLA. Two case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework at the end of this paper.",

        "abstract": "System management is becoming increasingly complex and brings high costs, especially with the advent of cloud computing. Cloud computing involves numerous platforms often of virtual machines (VMs) and middleware has to be managed to make the whole system work cost-effectively after an application is deployed. In order to reduce management costs, in particular for the manual activities, many computer programs have been developed remove or reduce the complexity and difficulty of system mamnagement. These programs are usually hard-coded in languages like Java and C++, which bring enough capability and flexibility but also cause high programming effort and cost. This paper proposes an architecture for developing management programs in a simple but powerful way. First of all, the manageability of a given platform (via APIs, configuration files, and scripts) is abstracted as a runtime model of the platform's software architecture, which can automatically and immediately propagate any observable runtime changes of the target platforms to the corresponding architecture models, and vice versa. The management programs are developed using modeling languages, instead of those relatively low-level programming languages. Architecture-level management programs bring many advantages related to performance, interoperability, reusability, and simplicity. An experiment on a real-world cloud deployment and comparisonwith traditional programming language approaches demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness, and benefits of the new model based approach for management program development. \u00a9 2012 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

Recent study demonstrated that 3T3-L1 preadipocytes will not be differentiated into mature adipocytes without CI stage, which indicated that CI stage plays an important role during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism is not yet fully understood. In the present study, we found that the expression level of miR-29a/b/c was decreased and the expression of DNMT3A was up-regulated during CI stage, respectively. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-29a/b/c during CI stage inhibits adipogenesis significantly but not at other stages. In addition, miR-29a/b/c repressed DNMT3A expression by directly targeting its 3' untranslated region (3' UTR). Our data reveal a novel mechanism of miR-29a/b/c in the regulation of adipogenesis.",

The hyaline old and discharged conidia with 1\u20132 septa, broader spermatia formed in the culture and smaller ascostroma readily distinguished it from  B. dothidea  and other species in  Botryosphaeria . The intergenic spacer (ITS)\u00a0 and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1) DNA sequence analysis results also support its separation from other  Botryosphaeria  species. Its relationships with other species of  Botryosphaeria  are also discussed based on morphology and DNA sequence comparisons.",

        "abstract": "A geometric modeling and solution procedure for direct kinematic analysis of 6-4 Stewart platforms with any link parameters is proposed based on conformal geometric algebra (CGA). Firstly, the positions of the two single spherical joints on the moving platform are formulated by the intersection, dissection, and dual of the basic entities under the frame of CGA. Secondly, a coordinate-invariant equation is derived via CGA operation in the positions of the other two pairwise spherical joints. Thirdly, the other five equations are formulated in terms of geometric constraints. Fourthly, a 32-degree univariate polynomial equation is reduced from a constructed 7 by 7 matrix which is relatively small in size by using a Grobner-Sylvester hybrid method. Finally, a numerical example is employed to verify the solution procedure. The novelty of the paper lies in that  the formulation is concise and coordinate-invariant and has intrinsic geometric intuition due to the use of CGA and  the size of the resultant matrix is smaller than those existed.",

There are two traditional solutions for management in IT systems. One relies on administrators, but there are lacks of experienced administrators. The other relies on systems themselves, but there are no important progresses in related technologies about self-management, such as the artificial intelligence. \u201cManagement as a Service\u201d (MaaS) is the solution from the reuse point of view. MaaS regards functions, processes, rules and experiments in IT management as reusable assets and is to enable them to be presented, be used and collaborate in a service-oriented style. However, it is the premise that management is suit to be reused in the service-oriented style. In this paper, we construct the Internet ware Cloud which focus on middleware management and investigate the reusability of the basic management operations and management processes in the MaaS solution.",

        "abstract": "Middleware has become the popular runtime infrastructure of modern IT systems. Due to the complex application contexts and various user requirements, more and more applications are now making use of different middleware platforms. It might require the cooperation of several types of middleware, and result in challenging issues for collaborative management of heterogeneous middleware. To solve this problem, it may be a feasible solution to make management interfaces delivered in the form of services and used in service-oriented styles. In this paper, we propose an approach to encapsulating middleware management interfaces into Web services. First of all, we introduce middleware management problems induced by the development of requirements. Then, we present the technical challenges and illustrate the details about how to enable different management interfaces to be in service-oriented styles. Followed by identified technical challenges, we evaluate the approach and primarily discuss how to manage middleware systems collaboratively based on management services.",

        "abstract": "Plant litter is an indispensable component of constructed wetlands, but how the submergence of plant litter affects their ecosystem functions and services, such as water purification, is still unclear. Moreover, it is also unclear whether the effects of plant litter submergence depend on other factors such as the duration of litter submergence, water source or litter species identity. Here we conducted a greenhouse experiment by submerging the litter of 7 wetland plant species into three types of water substrates and monitoring changes in water nutrient concentrations. Litter submergence affected water quality positively via decreasing the concentration of nitrate nitrogen and negatively via increasing the concentrations of total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus. The effects of litter submergence depended on the duration of litter submergence, the water source, the litter species identity, and the plant life form. Different plant species had different effects on the water nutrient concentrations during litter submergence, and the effects of floating plants might be more negative than that of emergent plants. These results are novel evidence of how the submergence of different plant (life form) litter may affect the purification function of constructed wetlands. For water at low eutrophication levels, submerging a relative small amount of plant litter might improve water quality, via benefiting the denitrification process in water. These findings emphasized the management of floating plant litter (a potential removal) during the maintenance of human-controlled wetland ecosystems and provided a potential tool to improve the water quality of constructed wetlands via submerging plant litter of different types.",

        "abstract": "Coastal wetlands are considered as a significant sink of global carbon due to their tremendous organic carbon storage. Coastal CO2 and CH4 flux rates play an important role in regulating atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations. However, the relative contributions of vegetation, soil properties, and spatial structure on dry-season ecosystem carbon (C) rates (net ecosystem CO2 exchange, NEE; ecosystem respiration, ER; gross ecosystem productivity, GEP; and CH4) remain unclear at a regional scale. Here, we compared dry-season ecosystem C rates, plant, and soil properties across three vegetation types from 13 locations at a regional scale in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). The results showed that the Phragmites australis stand had the greatest NEE (-1365.4 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1), ER (660.2 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1), GEP (-2025.5 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1) and acted as a CH4 source (0.27 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1), whereas the Suaeda heteroptera and Tamarix chinensis stands uptook CH4 (-0.02 to -0.12 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1). Stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that plant biomass was the main factor explaining all of the investigated carbon rates (GEP, ER, NEE, and CH4); while soil organic carbon was shown to be the most important for explaining the variability in the processes of carbon release to the atmosphere, i.e., ER and CH4. Variation partitioning results showed that vegetation and soil properties played equally important roles in shaping the pattern of C rates in the YRD. These results provide a better understanding of the link between ecosystem C rates and environmental drivers, and provide a framework to predict regional-scale ecosystem C fluxes under future climate change.",

        "abstract": "Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle and potentially have a significant impact on regional climate change. Restoring and rewetting the degraded peatlands is an urgent task. However, effects of rewetting on the carbon emissions of peatlands remain poorly understood. In this study, the process of rewetting a piece of the degraded Zoige alpine peatland was experimentally simulated and the derived results were compared with those of natural rewetting by monitoring CO2 and CH4 fluxes and other environmental factors before and after rewetting. The natural rewetting results showed that rewetting decreased ecosystem respiration (ER) by about 60%. Furthermore, rewetting increased CH4 emissions by 127%, decreased total carbon emissions (TCE) from 270 to 157 mg CO2 m\u22122 h\u22121, and decreased TCE from the entire ecosystem by 42%. The results of the controlled experiment showed that ER decreased gradually as the degree of rewetting was increased, and CH4 fluxes and changes in water level were significantly and positively correlated: CH4 fluxes increased from 0.3 (water level \u221220 cm) to 2.17 mg CH4 m\u22122 h\u22121 (water level 20 cm). After rewetting, the TCE of the whole ecosystem were significantly decreased. Regional observations showed that CO2 fluxes were significantly and negatively correlated to the water level; and the corresponding CO2 equivalent was significantly and positively correlated to the water level, while TCE were significantly and negatively correlated to the water level. Our findings indicate that rewetting can decrease carbon emissions and thus contribute in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change in alpine peatland.",

        "abstract": "Nitrogen removal efficiency in constructed wetlands (CW) is influenced by multiple environmental factors. However, little is known about the role of cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation in affecting nitrogen removal efficiency. This study investigated how cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation affects the efficiency, at which a CW removes nitrogen from an associated artificial lake (AL) in Beijing. For this purpose, we measured cell densities of N-fixing and non-N-fixing cyanobacteria, the aquatic nitrogen fixation rate (RNfix), and the concentration of various nitrogen fractions over the growing season (April\u2013November) of 2014 in both AL and CW. We found that the removal of particulate organic nitrogen (PON) contributed to u003e90% of the total nitrogen removal in the CW. The removal efficiency of PON was lower during August\u2013October (55.45 \u00b1 27.49%) than during April\u2013July (68.86 \u00b1 8.83%). Phytoplankton proliferation in summer, as one of the main sources of PON, may have exceeded the capacity of the CW and led to declines in PON removal efficiency. RNfix peaked in July\u2013October (3\u2013169 ng N\u00b7L\u22121\u00b7h\u22121) and was positively correlated with both PON concentration and the cell density of N-fixing Anabaena sp. over the growing season, suggesting that aquatic nitrogen fixation (primarily in the AL) may increase PON and thereby reduce the its removal efficiency in the CW.",

        "abstract": "Suaeda salsa is a pioneer species in coastal wetlands of East Asia and recently an ecosystem engineer species, Phragmites australis, has started to enter into S. salsa communities owing to either autogenic or external drivers. The consequences of this phenomenon on the ecosystem functions of coastal wetlands are still unclear, especially for decomposition processes. Here we compared the decomposition rate of S. salsa litter, and associated litter chemistry dynamics, between sites with and without P. australis encroachment. We conducted a litter transplantation experiment to tease apart the effects of litter quality and decomposing environment or decomposer community composition. Our results showed that P. australis encroachment led to higher carbon and phosphorus losses of S. salsa litter, but equal losses of total mass, lignin, hemicellulose and nitrogen. Phragmites australis encroachment might affect decomposition rate indirectly by making S. salsa produce litter with higher lignin concentrations or via increasing the fungal diversity for decomposition. Moreover, P. australis as an ecosystem engineer might also alter the allocation of total phosphorus between the plants and the soils in coastal wetlands. Our findings indicate that P. australis could impact aboveground and belowground carbon and nutrient dynamics in coastal wetlands, and highlight the important consequences that encroaching plant species, especially ecosystem engineers, can have on ecosystem functions and services of coastal wetlands, not only in East Asia but probably also elsewhere in the world.",

        "abstract": "Intracellular triglyceride (TG) hydrolysis or lipolysis is catalyzed by the key intracellular triglyceride hydrolase, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). The G0/G1 Switch Gene 2 (G0S2) was recently identified as the major selective inhibitor of ATGL and its hydrolase function. Since G0S2 levels are dynamically linked and rapidly responsive to nutrient status or metabolic requirements, the identification of its regulation at the protein level is of significant value. Earlier evidence from our laboratory demonstrated that G0S2 is a short-lived protein degraded through the proteasomal pathway. However, little is currently known regarding the underlying mechanisms. In the current study we find that 1) protein degradation is initiated by K48-linked polyubiquitination of the lysine- 25 in G0S2; and 2) G0S2 protein is stabilized in response to ATGL expression and TG accumulation. Mutation of lysine-25 of G0S2 abolished ubiquitination and increased protein stability. More importantly, G0S2 was stabilized via different mechanisms in the presence of ATGL vs. in response to fatty acid (FA)-induced TG accumulation. Furthermore, G0S2 protein but not mRNA levels were reduced in the adipose tissue of ATGL-deficient mice, corroborating the involvement of ATGL in the stabilization of G0S2. Taken together our data illustrate for the first time a crucial multifaceted mechanism for the stabilization of G0S2 at the protein level. ",

        "abstract": "Liver X receptors (LXRs) are transcription factors essential for cholesterol homeostasis and lipogenesis. LXR\u03b1 has been implicated in regulating hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation upon both influx of adipose-derived fatty acids (FAs) during fasting and stimulation of de novo FA synthesis by chemical agonism of LXR. However, whether or not a convergent mechanism is employed to drive deposition of FAs from these 2 different sources in TGs is undetermined. Here, we report that the G0/G1 Switch Gene 2 (G0S2), a selective inhibitor of intracellular TG hydrolysis/lipolysis, is a direct target gene of LXR\u03b1. Transcriptional activation is conferred by LXR\u03b1 binding to a direct repeat 4 (DR4) motif in the G0S2 promoter. While LXR\u03b1 mice exhibited decreased hepatic G0S2 expression, adenoviral expression of G0S2 was sufficient to restore fasting-induced TG storage and glycogen depletion in the liver of these mice. In response to LXR agonist T0901317, G0S2 ablation prevented hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia without affecting the beneficial effects on HDL. Thus, the LXR\u03b1-G0S2 axis plays a distinct role in regulating hepatic TG during both fasting and pharmacological activation of LXR.",

        "abstract": "The autophagic digestion of lipid droplets (LDs) through lipophagy is an essential process by which most cells catabolize lipids as an energy source. However, the cellular machinery used for the envelopment of LDs during autophagy is poorly understood. We report a novel function for a small Rab guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) in the recruitment of adaptors required for the engulfment of LDs by the growing autophagosome. In hepatocytes stimulated to undergo autophagy, Rab10 activity is amplified significantly, concomitant with its increased recruitment to nascent autophagic membranes at the LD surface. Disruption of Rab10 function by small interfering RNA knockdown or expression of a GTPase-defective variant leads to LD accumulation. Finally, Rab10 activation during autophagy is essential for LC3 recruitment to the autophagosome and stimulates its increased association with the adaptor protein EHBP1 (EH domain binding protein 1) and the membrane-deforming adenosine triphosphatase EHD2 (EH domain containing 2) that, together, are essential in driving the activated \u201cengulfment\u201d of LDs during lipophagy in hepatocytes.",

Compton recoil electrons are generated by a lithium converter, and then confined by a complex collimator and spectrally resolved by a sector-shaped double-focusing magnet. A method of optimization for the converter is investigated, and the dependence of the best energy resolution on converting efficiency is quantitatively revealed. The configuration of the magnet is specially designed to cover a wide range of electron energy and to achieve a large collecting solid angle. The efficiency and relative energy resolution of the designed spectrometer, according to Monte-Carlo simulation using Geant4, are 10-4 e/p and about 5% respectively for 3 MeV photons.",

The DRSD considers multiple sectors within a general decision-support framework to generate cross-sector optimal development schemes at a county scale. It integrates a dynamic database system, large-scale linear programming for regional managers, and integer linear programming for farmers, which makes a solid step toward linking farmers' microplanning with administrators' macropolicies. Yongxin, an economically relatively undeveloped and geographically relatively isolated county, was chosen as the paradigm for this DRSD application; this selection provided a good opportunity to analyze the relationships between rapid economic development, ecological destruction, and environmental deterioration within the region. The results from the representative scenario, Sustainable Development, suggested that maximization of overall economic benefits for 23 towns in Yongxin over a 15-year period, from 2007 to 2022 would require relatively small increases in agricultural and horticultural areas, significant increases in scales of livestock, poultry, sericulture, forestry, and fisheries, as well as significant increases in investment in both the secondary and the tertiary industry sectors. Future directions and implementation challenges for this type of DSS were discussed.",

        "abstract": "Water quality management is inevitably complicated since it involves a number of environmental, socio-economic, technical, and political factors with dynamic and interactive features. In planning water quality management systems, uncertainties exist in many system components and may affect the system behaviours. It is thus desired that such complexities and uncertainties be effectively addressed for providing decision support for practical water quality management. The objective of this study is to develop a model-based decision support system for supporting water quality management under hybrid uncertainties, named FICMDSS, which is based on a hybrid uncertain programming (HFICP) model with fuzzy and interval coefficients. The system provides an effective tool for the decision makers in dealing with water quality management problems and formulating desired policies and strategies. The user can easily operate the system and obtain the decision support through user-friendly graphical interfaces. The HFICP model improves upon the existing inexact programming methods through incorporation of hybrid fuzzy and interval uncertainties into the optimization management processes and resulting solutions. Results of a water quality management case study indicated that the developed FICMDSS can facilitate the decision making in planning agricultural activities for water quality management in agricultural systems. Feasible decision alternatives for cropping area, amounts of manure and fertilizer application, and sizes of livestock husbandry can be generated for achieving the maximum agricultural system benefit subject to the given water-related constraints. The user can better make the decisions for water quality management under hybrid uncertainties with the help of FICMDSS.",

        "abstract": "Groundwater contamination is one of important environmental problems at petroleum-related sites, which is causing more and more attention. It can bring serious adverse effects on the environment and human health. Design of a groundwater remediation system is desired for supporting the management of petroleum-contaminated sites. Due to high remediation cost and extensive alternatives, efficient remediation design needs to be determined. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is an approach to measure the relative efficiencies of decision-making units (DMUs) with multiple inputs and multiple outputs without underlying assumptions. However, few of these studies were applied to the design of groundwater remediation systems, where efficient alternatives for remediation systems design need to be determined. This paper proposes a hybrid decision support approach based on data envelopment analysis to determine the most preferable design alternatives for groundwater remediation systems. The total remediation system cost, amount of additional wells, and manpower requirements will be employed as the input variables, while the removal efficiency and technical feasibility as the output variables. The proposed approach will be applied to a case study of designing a groundwater remediation system at a petroleum-contaminated site in western Canada. The most preferable design alternative can be obtained to provide effective decision support for cleaning up the contaminated site.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A statistical approach in defining particle morphology in terms of an ensemble of hexahedra of distorted shapes is employed for modeling the Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) of aquatic particles. The approach is inspired by the rich variability in shapes of real aquatic particles that cannot be represented by one particular shape. Two methods, the Invariant Imbedding T-matrix (II-TM) and Physical Geometric Optics Hybrid (PGOH) method, are combined to simulate the IOPs for aquatic particles of sizes ranging from the Rayleigh scattering to geometric optics regimes. Nonspherical effects on the IOPs are examined by comparing the results with predictions based on the Lorenz-Mie theory to explore the limitations of assuming the particles to be spherical. We pay special attention to backscattering-related and polarimetric scattering properties, particularly the backscattering ratio, Gordon parameter, backscattering volume scattering function and the degree of linear polarization. The simulated IOPs are compared with the in-situ measurements to assess the feasibility of using a hexahedral ensemble in modeling the IOPs of the aquatic particles.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Diel variations of inherent optical properties (absorption coefficient, attenuation coefficient and volume scattering function at 124\u00b0) of four species of phytoplankton were measured in the laboratory and were simulated using a homogeneous spherical model, a coated spherical model and a homogeneous hexahedral model. The required inputs to run each optical model were acquired from the measurements; the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index were determined from the intracellular carbon and absorption coefficient, and particle size distributions from the Coulter counter. We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the inherent optical properties in response to changes in the slope of Junge distributions that were used to represent non-phytoplankton particles of radii less than 1.12\u202f\u00b5m (the minimum size of the Coulter counter), realistic maximum and minimum values of the refractive indices used for the shell and core, shell thickness, cell radius and the number of cells. We found that the shellu0027s refractive index is the most important factor influencing the backscattering ratio. We found that the coated spherical model reproduced the observed optical properties best for all species possessing a shell. The hexahedral and homogenous spherical models give relatively good results for the absorption and attenuation coefficients; but underestimated the volume scattering function at 124\u00b0. Correlations between the measured backscattering cross sections and carbon are significant only for  E. huxleyi  and  D. tertiolecta . In situ measurements will be necessary to determine if our models can reproduce the diel variations of backscattering that are observed in the ocean.",

The effects of assumed phytoplankton morphology variations and its vertical distribution on the lidar attenuated backscatter and depolarization ratio are studied. In this study, a phytoplankton particle is assumed to be a sphere, a sphere with a core, or a randomly distorted hexahedron with or without a core. The single-scattering properties of the nonspherical/inhomogeneous particles are computed using appropriate state-of-the-art light-scattering computational capabilities. Vertical variation of the phytoplankton distribution is derived explicitly using a PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) limited carbon biomass balance equation that is subsequently coupled with the Monte Carlo solver.",

        "abstract": "Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been widely used in the analysis fields of traditional Chinese medicine. It has the advantages of fast analysis, no damage to samples and no pollution. In this research, a fast quantitative model for zinc oxide (ZnO) content in mineral medicine calamine was explored based on NIR spectroscopy. NIR spectra of 57 batches of calamine samples were collected and the first derivative (FD) method was adopted for conducting spectral pretreatment. The content of ZnO in calamine sample was determined using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) titration and taken as reference value of NIR spectroscopy. 57 batches of calamine samples were categorized into calibration and prediction set using the Kennard-Stone (K-S) algorithm. Firstly, in the calibration set, to calculate the correlation coefficient (r) between the absorbance value and the ZnO content of corresponding samples at each wave number. Next, according to the square correlation coefficient (r) value to obtain the top 50 wave numbers to compose the characteristic spectral bands (4081.8-4096.3, 4188.9-4274.7, 4335.4, 4763.6,4794.4-4802.1, 4809.9, 4817.6-4875.4cm), which were used to establish the quantitative model of ZnO content using back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) algorithm. Then, the 50 wave numbers were operated by the mean impact value (MIV) algorithm to choose wave numbers whose absolute value of MIV greater than or equal to 25, to obtain the optimal characteristic spectral bands (4875.4-4836.9, 4223.6-4080.9cm). And then, both internal cross and external validation were used to screen the number of hidden layer nodes of BP-ANN. Finally, the number 4 of hidden layer nodes was chosen as the best. At last, the BP-ANN model was found to enjoy a high accuracy and strong forecasting capacity for analyzing ZnO content in calamine samples ranging within 42.05-69.98%, with relative mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV) of 1.66% and coefficient of determination (R) of 95.75% in internal cross and relative mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 1.98%, R of 97.94% and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) of 6.11 in external validation.",

The aim was to establish a fast determination model of zinc oxide (ZnO) content in calcined calamine and to explore methods through judging the end point of calamine calcination. Eight batches of calamine samples sourced from hydrozincite with different sizes and textures were calcined at different temperatures. During the calcination process, ZnO contents, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, and near-infrared spectra of the samples were used to analyze their changes rules. The model of determining ZnO content of calcined calamine was established to use near-infrared spectroscopy based on the partial least squares (PLS) regression algorithm. In addition, this paper summarized the change rules of calamine in calcination according to XRD patterns, using the \u201cK value\u201d quantitative method to define the characteristic T value. When the T value was equal to 1.00 (100%), that is to say, the calamine sample was completely calcined. Then, matching the near-infrared spectroscopy data with the T value and establishing the T value analysis model using the PLS algorithm were performed. Through cross and independent validation and evaluation, it was proved that the two models were very effective and had strong predictive abilities. Finally, the purpose of the online monitoring of the calcination process and controlling the quality of the calcined calamine was achieved.",

        "abstract": "The center shaft of rotary steering spindle system is bendable under bias force. A severe partial load effect occurs among rollers, the inside and outside circles of the first cantilever bearing. Simulation analysis was conducted by loading boundary condition of the spindle under bias force. Furthermore, three different types of deep cavity rollers, which were cylindrical, conical, and spherical, respectively, were analyzed by finite element method. The effects of deep cavity angles, radius, and offset on mechanical properties of bearing were studied. The data obtained by simulation analysis were trained and predicted by Back Propagation (BP) neural network, and then the BP neural network model was incorporated into fmincon function. Thereby, structure optimization of rollers was established based on BP neural network model and fmincon function. The results show that structure of the conical deep cavity roller gets optimal mechanical performance. After being optimized, maximum stress of edge region and elliptical area decreases, respectively, by 22 and 17% than before, indicating that structure optimization method of the neural network and fmincon function can be used in optimization of deep cavity rollers. This method can quickly search for the optimal solution with sufficient engineering accuracy, ease of use, and adaptability.",

        "abstract": "To improve the power generation efficiency, the parameters matching analysis method for the downhole generator with asymmetric turbine is established on basis of the experimental design theory, response surface methodology and orthogonal experimental design. Firstly, according to the theoretical analysis, the computational domain model is built by the three-dimensional modeling software. Based on the calculation results by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), the blade parameters of stator and rotor which affect the objective function a lot are screened out by the single-factor experimental design. Then, to get the optimal design results, these parameters are analyzed and determined by the Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology. Once the approximation model of objective function is constructed, the interplay between these parameters is discussed in this paper. Furthermore, the secondary factors are analyzed to obtain the more reasonable matching by orthogonal experimental method. Finally, the experimental study is conducted on the optimal design point of the new asymmetric turbine. The results show that CFD simulations are in good accordance with the calculations based on response surface method. The relative error of experimental value is smaller compared with the predictive value, and the trends of performance curves are almost the same. What\u2019s more, the efficiency of new asymmetric turbine increases by 10\u00a0% after optimizing matching. It declares that the design method based on Box-Behnken and the orthogonal design experiments can be used in the matching analysis of asymmetric turbine\u2019s parameters. The research in this paper provides reliable guidance in turbine blade design and technological parameters optimizing.",
