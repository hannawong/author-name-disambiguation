Literature values for PAHs and OCs obtained by the same method were 1.9-5.1 times of present values at +20 degrees C. Experimentally determined K(SA) ranged over six orders of magnitude, with log K(SA) from 4.5 for alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane at +30 degrees C to 10.4 for trans-nonachlor at -20 degrees C. Separate linear regressions of log K(SA) and reciprocal absolute temperature were employed at temperatures above 0 degrees C and below 0 degrees C. The calculated enthalpies associated with the phase transfer from the soil to the air (DeltaH(SA)) over 0 to +30 degrees C range from 78 to 108 kJmol(-1), which are in a good agreement with the literature values.",

        "abstract": "Direct utilization of solar energy for photocatalytic removal of ammonia from water is a topic of strong interest. However, most of the photocatalysts with effective performance are solely metal-based semiconductors. Here, we report for the first time that a new type of atomic single layer graphitic-C(3)N(4) (SL g-C(3)N(4)), a metal-free photocatalyst, has an excellent photocatalytic activity for total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) removal from water. The results demonstrated that over 80% of TAN (initial concentration 1.50 mg \u00b7 L(-1)) could be removed in 6 h under Xe lamp irradiation (195 mW \u00b7 cm(-2)). Furthermore, the SL g-C(3)N(4) exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity in alkaline solution than that in neutral or acidic solutions. The investigation suggested that both photogenerated holes and hydroxyl radicals were involved the TAN photocatalytic oxidation process and that the major oxidation product was NO3(-)-N. In addition, SL g-C(3)N(4) exhibited good photocatalytic stability in aqueous solution. This work highlights the appealing application of an inexpensive metal-free photocatalyst in aqueous ammonia treatment.",

The concentrations of petroleum in photolytic processes were analyzed by UV-Vis. GC-FID and FTIR were used for the characterization of petroleum hydrocarbons. Experimental results indicated that photochemical degradation of petroleum on soil surfaces followed pseudo first-order kinetics with the rate constant of 0.0026-0.0172 h(-1) and half-life of 40-267 h. GC-FID analysis showed that, after 50 h of irradiation, the content of saturated hydrocarbons with longer chain decreased, while the proportion of shorter chain ones increased slightly; in addition, most chromatogram peaks of aromatics weakened or disappeared. After 60 h of photolysis, the appearance of carbonyl compounds in FTIR spectra of the extract from soil demonstrated that petroleum was gradually oxidized in the photolytic process.",

After being spiked with gamma-HCH, soil samples loaded with the composite photocatalysts were exposed to UV-light irradiation. The results indicated that the photocatalytic activities of the composite photocatalysts varied with the content of TiO2 in the order of 10% < 70% < 50% < 30%. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of the composite photocatalysts with TiO2 content 30% was higher than that of the pure P25 with the same mass of TiO2. The strong adsorption capacity of the composite photocatalysts and quantum size effect may contribute to its increased photocatalytic activities. In addition, effect of dosage of composite photocatalysts and soil pH on gamma-HCH photodegradation was investigated. Pentachlorocyclohexene, trichlorocyclohexene, and dichlorobenzene were detected as photodegradation intermediates, which were gradually degraded with the photodegradation evolution.",

The results indicated that the acidogenic efficiency was improved by settling a bio-electrochemical system. When hydraulic retention times decreased from 12 to 3h, R1 showed 18.9% more chemical oxygen demand removal and 13.8% more acidification efficiency. After cutting off the voltage of R1, the COD removal decreased by about 5%. Coupling of Fe(2+) leaching and electric field accelerated the hydrolysis of polysaccharide, relieving its accumulation in the sludge phase. Several acidophilic methanogenic Archaea such as Methanosarcina sp. were enriched in R1, which was favorable for consuming organic acids and preventing excessive pH decline. Thus, the developed acidogenic reactor with Fe-carbon electrodes is expected to be potentially effective and useful for wastewater treatment.",

        "abstract": "Aimed at enhancing photocatalysis through intensifying light harvesting, a new photocatalyst was fabricated by infiltrating Au nanoparticles into TiO(2) photonic crystals (TiO(2) PC/Au NPs). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images showed that the Au NPs with average diameter around 15 nm were dispersed uniformly into the porous TiO(2) material. The results of the transmittance spectra demonstrated that the light absorption by Au NPs was amplified after they were infiltrated into TiO(2) 240, which was fabricated from 240 nm polystyrene spheres. In the photocatalytic experiments of 2,4-dichlorophenol degradation under visible light (\u03bb > 420 nm) irradiation, the kinetic constant using TiO(2) 240/Au NPs was 2.3 fold larger than that using TiO(2) nanocrystalline/Au NPs (TiO(2) NC/Au NPs). The excellent photocatalysis benefited from the cooperatively enhanced light harvesting owing to the localized surface plasmon resonance of Au NPs, which extended the light response spectra and the photonic effect of the TiO(2) 240 which intensified the plasmonic absorption by Au NPs. The hydroxyl radicals originated from the electroreduction of dissolved oxygen with photogenerated electrons via chain reactions were the main reactive oxygen species responsible for the pollutant degradation.",

In this work, a self-sustained carbon nanotube hollow fiber scaffold supported polyamide thin film composite (CNT TFC-FO) membrane was firstly proposed with high porosity, good hydrophilicity and excellent electro-conductivity. It showed a specific structure parameter as low as 126 \u00b5m, suggesting its weakened ICP. Against a pure water feed using 2.0 M NaCl draw solution, its fluxes were 4.7 and 3.6 times as high as those of the commercial cellulose triacetate TFC-FO membrane in the FO and pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) modes, respectively. Meanwhile, the membrane showed excellent electrically assisted resistance to organic and microbial fouling. Its flux was improved by about 50% during oil-water simulation separation under 2.0 V voltage. These results indicate that the CNT TFC-FO membrane opens up a frontier for stably and effectively recycling potable water from electrochemical FO process.",

        "abstract": "Accumulation of hydrogen during anaerobic processes usually results in low decomposition of volatile organic acids (VFAs). On the other hand, hydrogen is a good electron donor for dye reduction, which would help the acetogenic conversion in keeping low hydrogen concentration. The main objective of the study was to accelerate VFA composition through using azo dye as electron acceptor. The results indicated that the azo dye serving as an electron acceptor could avoid H2 accumulation and accelerate anaerobic digestion of VFAs. After adding the azo dye, propionate decreased from 2400.0 to 689.5mg/L and acetate production increased from 180.0 to 519.5mg/L. It meant that the conversion of propionate into acetate was enhanced. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed that the abundance of propionate-utilizing acetogens with the presence of azo dye was greater than that in a reference without azo dye. The experiments via using glucose as the substrate further demonstrated that the VFA decomposition and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal increased by 319.7mg/L and 23.3% respectively after adding the azo dye. Therefore, adding moderate azo dye might be a way to recover anaerobic system from deterioration due to the accumulation of H2 or VFAs.",

        "abstract": "A highly ordered TiO2/Au nanorod array was successfully fabricated by direct current electrodeposition and subsequent spin-coating. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images revealed that the TiO2 film completely covered the surface of the Au nanorods, which resulted in TiO2 shell Au core nanorods. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed that the TiO2 film was anatase with preferential orientation in the (101) plane. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra showed a shift in the absorption edge toward the visible region because of the formation of a Schottky junction between Au and TiO2. A new absorption peak that ranged from 400 to 800 nm appeared because of the localized surface plasmon resonance of the Au nanorod arrays. For the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B under UV light irradiation, the TiO2/Au nanorod array exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity and its kinetic constant was 2.0 times that of pristine TiO2 and 1.3 times that of a TiO2/Au film. The enhanced photocatalysis was attributed to the high surface volume ratio, an improved UV light response, efficient separation, and the convenient migration of photogenerated charge carriers because of the one-dimensional nanorod structure and the Schottky junction between Au and TiO2. This work could provide new insights into the fabrication of a high performance photocatalyst and thus facilitate practical environmental applications.",

The acute toxicity was evaluated according to the mortality rate of zebrafish, and genotoxicity was evaluated by micronucleus (MN) and comet assays. Removal of color and chemical oxygen demand (COD) was also investigated. The results indicated that the dye effluent showed strong acute toxicity and genotoxicity to zebrafish. After 4h of treatment by Fenton-coagulation process, the dye effluent exhibited no significant acute toxicity and genotoxicity to zebrafish. In addition, its COD was less than 50mg/L, which met the discharge standard.

Anaerobic degradation rates of gamma-666, p,p'-DDT were 0.020 d-1, 0.009 d-1 respectively for the sediments without additional carbon resources. However, with additional carbon resources, the anaerobic degradation rates of gamma-666, p,p'-DDT were 0.071 d-1 and 0.054 d-1 in the original sediments respectively. After removing organic matter, the rates were decreased to 0.047 d-1, 0.037 d-1. In the sediments removed organic matter and hydrous metal oxides, the rates were increased to 0.067 d-1, 0.059 d-1.

Previous characterization suggested that the organic carbon content (OC) of black soil was higher. The sorption and desorption isotherms at different SSRs fit well to a linear equation. Desorption hysteresis due to sorption irreversibility was observed and hysteresis index (HI) used to quantify the desorption hysteresis increased from 1.43 to 2.21 with increasing SSR from 10.00 g x L(-1) to 75.00 g x L(-1) for agricultural soil (OC = 1.54%) and increased from 1.18 to 1.37 with increasing SSR from 2.50 g x L(-1) to 5.00 g x L(-1) for black soil (OC = 15.91%), indicating that an increase of SSR and decrease of OC of soils caused a simultaneous increase in sorption irreversibility of DPH. The organic-carbon-normalized sorption coefficients (K(OC)) derived from sorption isotherms, were dependent on SSR. A SSR-effect isotherm equation for a given system, which could be applied in the extrapolation of batch-measured sorption parameters to field conditions, was established.",

        "abstract": "An ultrasensitive methodology was successfully developed for the quantitative detection of picomolar Hg(2+) based on the combination of thymine-Hg(2+)-thymine (T-Hg(2+)-T) coordination chemistry and exonuclease III-aided recycling signal amplification. Single-strand probe DNA was immobilized on an Au electrode via an Au-S bond. In the presence of Hg(2+), the probe DNA hybridized with the target DNA containing four thymine-thymine (T-T) mismatches via the Hg(2+)-mediated coordination of T-Hg(2+)-T base pairs. Then the probe DNA in the DNA duplex was specifically recognized and selectively digested by exonuclease III; in contrast the target DNA was safely dissociated from the DNA duplexes to subsequently hybridize with a new signal probe, leading to target recycling and signal amplification. As a result, the peak current caused by the electrostatic interactions of [Ru(NH3)6](3+) cations with the backbone of the probe DNA decreased by different degrees, corresponding to the Hg(2+) concentrations. Under the optimum conditions, the proposed electrochemical DNA biosensor showed a robust detection limit as low as 1 pM (S/N = 3), with a wide linear range from 0.01 to 500 nM and good selectivity. In addition, the proposed method was successfully applied to assay Hg(2+) in real environmental samples.",

        "abstract": "In present work, three-dimensional porous HxTiS2 nanosheet-polyaniline (PANI) nanocomposites were first synthesized by a two-step method. Firstly HxTiS2 ultrathin nanosheets were prepared by the lithium-intercalation-and-exfoliation method, followed by the surface polymerization reactions of aniline. The influences of the amount of HxTiS2 nanosheets on the nanocomposite morphology and electrochemical performances of the nanocomposites modified glass carbon electrode (HxTiS2 nanosheet-PANI/GCE) were investigated. The results demonstrated that the incorporation of HxTiS2 nanosheets as a suitable substrate can regulate the growth of PANI, enhance the electrode stability and improve interfacial electron transfer rates. In addition, based on the nanocomposites, we developed a novel electrochemical sensor to directly detect trace Cu2+, and discovered that the coordination interaction between Cu2+ and the nitrogen atoms of the imine moieties in PANI endowed the electrochemical sensor with high selectivity. Owing to the synergetic effects of HxTiS2 nanosheets and PANI, the as-prepared electrochemical sensor exhibited highly sensitive and selective assaying of Cu2+ with a detection limit of 0.7 nM (S/N=3) and a linear range from 25 nM to 5 \u03bcM under optimal conditions.",

        "abstract": "For the sake of utilizing the light-harvesting ability of Si in pollution control, the p-silicon nanowire (SiNW)/TiO2 core/shell heterojunction arrays have been synthesized. Based on the surface photovoltage (SPV) measurement, these p-SiNW/TiO2 heterojunction arrays display considerable SPV response to the light with wavelength ranging from 300 to 700 nm. Under the protection of TiO2 shell, the SiNW core could harvest visible light stably in aqueous solution. The resistivity of the starting Si wafer has a distinct influence on the cathodic behaviors of p-SiNW/TiO 2 arrays. The higher photocurrent is observed for the sample using the starting Si wafer with moderate resistivity, in contrast with those using high- or low-resistivity starting Si wafer. In the photoelectrocatalytic experiments of phenol degradation under visible light irradiation conditions, the kinetic constant using p-SiNW/TiO2 cathode (0.983 h-1) is 17.7 times larger than that (0.0523 h-1) of TiO2 film on p type Si wafer (p-Si/TiO2). This result demonstrates that p-SiNW/TiO2 cathode could utilize visible light todecomposephenol with a considerable efficiency. The mechanism of phenol degradation is considered that the photogenerated electrons from p-SiNW/TiO2 cathode could be scavenged by dissolved oxygen first, followed by generation of hydroxyl radicals species via a chain reaction, and finally phenol could be oxidized. By constructing this kind ofheterojunctions,manyothernarrow- bandgapsemiconductors might be utilized as photocatalysts in pollution control, consequently, the optimal sunlight harvesting would be achieved. \u00a9 2009 American Chemical Society.",

We expected that the photocatalytic capability of this hybrid photocatalyst could be enhanced by the efficient visible light absorption owing to the photonic crystal structure and effective charge separation owing to the unique heterojunction built between TiO(2) and P3HT. The bilayer TiO(2)/P3HT photocatalyst was prepared first by depositing inverse TiO(2) opal on FTO substrate via replicating polystyrene opal, followed by spin coating a layer of TiO(2) nanoparticles on the inverse TiO(2) opal. The as prepared bilayer TiO(2) was modified by P3HT via dipping method. Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) images demonstrated that the as prepared photocatalyst was composed of inverse TiO(2) opal layer and TiO(2) nanoparticles layer. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra showed that the optical absorption for bilayer TiO(2)/P3HT was more intensive than for pristine TiO(2) nanoparticle/P3HT (NP-TiO(2)/P3HT) in the range of 400-650 nm. The enhanced generation of photocurrent under visible light irradiation (lambda > 400 nm) was observed using the bilayer TiO(2)/P3HT. The results of photocatalytic experiments under visible light irradiation revealed that the pseudofirst-order kinetic constant of photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue using the bilayer TiO(2)/P3HT was 2.08 times as great as that using NP-TiO(2)/P3HT, showing the advantage of the unique structure in the bilayer TiO(2)/P3HT for efficient photocatalysis.",

Rabbit anti-8-OHdG antibody was covalently bound to CQDs on the surface of Au/SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles. Through signal amplification of Au/SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles, 8-fold enhancement of the ECL signals was achieved. Under optimal conditions, a good linear range from 0.2 to 200 ng mL(-1) with a low detection limit of 0.085 ng mL(-1) (S/N=3) for 8-OHdG detection was obtained. Interfering substances tests showed that the corresponding ECL intensity (\u0394ECL) of 8-OHdG is 8-18 times higher than that of guanine, uric acid (UA) and ascorbic acid, demonstrating its good selectivity for 8-OHdG detection. The ECL immunosensor exhibits long-term stability with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 8.5% even after 16 cycles of continuous potential scans. The result of analytical detection of 8-OHdG in real samples was satisfactory. The proposed ECL immunosensor shows good performance with high sensitivity, specificity, repeatability, stability and provided a powerful tool for 8-OHdG monitoring in clinical samples.",

In this paper, a facile assembly of CNTs into novel hollow fiber membranes with tunable inner/outer diameters and structures is developed for the first time. These free-standing membranes composed entirely of CNTs feature a porosity of 86\u00b15% and a permeation flux of about 460\u00b150 L m(-2) h(-1) at a pressure differential of 0.04 MPa across the membrane. The randomly oriented interwoven structure of CNTs endows the membranes considerable resistance to pore blockage. Moreover, the adsorption capability of the CNT hollow fiber membranes, which is crucial in the efficient removal of small and trace contaminant molecules, is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of commercial polyvinylidene fluoride hollow fiber membranes. The unique advantage of the CNT hollow fiber membranes over other commercial membranes is that they can be in situ electrochemically regenerated after adsorption saturation.",

        "abstract": "Norfloxacin (NOR), an ionizable antibiotic frequently used in the aquaculture industry, has aroused public concern due to its persistence, bacterial resistance, and environmental ubiquity. Therefore, we investigated the photolysis of different species of NOR and the impact of a ubiquitous component of natural water - dissolved organic matter (DOM), which has a special photochemical activity and normally acts as a sensitizer or inhibiter in the photolysis of diverse organics; furthermore, scavenging experiments combined with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) were performed to evaluate the transformation of NOR in water. The results demonstated that NOR underwent direct photolysis and self-sensitized photolysis via hydroxyl radical (OH) and singlet oxygen ((1)O2) based on the scavenging experiments. In addition, DOM was found to influence the photolysis of different NOR species, and its impact was related to the concentration of DOM and type of NOR species. Photolysis of cationic NOR was photosensitized by DOM at low concentration, while zwitterionic and anionic NOR were photoinhibited by DOM, where quenching of OH predominated according to EPR experiments, accompanied by possible participation of excited triplet-state NOR and (1)O2. Photo-intermediate identification of different NOR species in solutions with/without DOM indicated that NOR underwent different photodegradation pathways including dechlorination, cleavage of the piperazine side chain and photooxidation, and DOM had little impact on the distribution but influenced the concentration evolution of photolysis intermediates. The results implied that for accurate ecological risk assessment of emerging ionizable pollutants, the impact of DOM on the environmental photochemical behavior of all dissociated species should not be ignored.",

        "abstract": "The effects of several aquatic environmental factors on the photochemical transformation of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) have been investigated. Ferric ion (Fe(III)) has been found to promote the phototransformation of BDE-47, and this process is further enhanced with the added chloride ion (Cl(-)), while it is suppressed with increasing pH. Electron spin resonance results show that the formation of hydroxyl radical, and the added Cl(-) could influence the generation of hydroxyl radical in Fe(III) solution. Hence, Cl(-) enhances the phototransformation of BDE-47 most probably because of the reaction with Fe(III) species under irradiation, yielding hydroxyl and chloride radicals. These radicals can not only decompose PBDEs, but also lead to their photodebromination and photochlorination. These results indicate that the aquatic environmental factors and Cl(-) in particular played an important role in the photochemical transformation process of PBDEs, providing insight into the likely fate of PBDEs in the marine environment.",

        "abstract": "TiO_ 2 /Al_ 2 O_ 3 composite membranes have been successfully fabricated from TiO_ 2 sols on the support of Al_ 2 O_ 3 . Pore sizes of the resulting membrane were mainly controlled by the sol properties and the immersion time. TiO_ 2 /Al_ 2 O_ 3 composite membranes were characterized using SEM, XRD, EDX, TEM and UV-Vis diffuse reflective spectra. The results proved that TiO_ 2 immobilized on the support of Al_ 2 O_ 3 had anatase crystal structure within the calcination temperature range. The anatase phase was 86% and the average particle size of TiO_ 2 was 22 nm. Acid Orange \u2161 was used as a test pollutant for the investigation of the multifunctions of photocatalysis and separation of the composite membrane. The influence of various experimental parameters was investigated to obtain high photocatalytic reaction rates, operating stability and high membrane rejection. By coupling membrane separation with photocatalysis technique, the removal efficiency of Acid Orange \u2161 was improved remarkably being 80% within 400 min, while the values were 65% with photocatalysis alone and 59% with membrane separation alone during the same time, respectively. Good photocatalytic activity of composite membrane under UV irradiation helped to obtain high permeate flux of the composite membrane and prevent the composite membrane from fouling.",

The results indicated that the biodegradation of test hydrocarbons followed first-order kinetics. The biodegradation rate constant of phenanthrene, anthracene, and n-hexadecane existed individually in soil was 0.0283, 0.0226 and 0.0096 d -1, respectively. When co-existed with phenanthrene, nhexadecane could serve as a co-metabolic substrate and promote the biodegradation of phenanthrene , making the half life of phenanthrene reduced by 44% , comparing with that when phenanthrene existed individually. In the meanwhile, n-hexadecane oxygenase was induced by phenanthrene. The increase of the induced oxygenase activity promoted the degradation of n-hexadecane, and reduced the half life of n-hexadecane by 49% , comparing with that when n-hexadecane existed individually. Contrarily, the coexistence of phenanthrene and anthracene promoted the biodegradation of phenanthrene but inhibited that of anthracene.",

After being spiked with gamma-HCH, soil samples were loaded with alpha-Fe2O3 or TiO2 and exposed to UV-light irradiation. Different catalyst loads, 0%, 2%, 5%, 7%, and 10% (wt.) alpha-Fe2O3; 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2: (wt.)TiO2, were tested for up to 7 d irradiation. The effects of soil thickness, acidity, and humic substances were also investigated. The obtained results indicated that the gamma-HCH photodegradation follows the pseudo-first-order kinetics. The addition of alpha-Fe2O3 or TiO2 accelerates the photodegradation of gamma-HCH, while the photodegradation rate decreases when the content of alpha-Fe2O3 exceeds 7% (wt.). The degradation rate increases with the soil pH value. Humic substances inhibit the photocatalytic degradation of gamma-HCH. Pentachlorocyclohexene, tetrachlorocyclohexene, and trichlorobenzene are detected as photodegradation intermediates, which are gradually degraded with the photodegradation evolution.",

Due to the essential surface and quenching properties of two-dimensional graphene, it can function as both \"scaffold\" and \"quencher\" of the Cu(2+)-dependent DNAzyme, facilitating the formation of self-assembled graphene-quenched DNAzyme complex. However, Cu(2+)-induced catalytic reaction disturbs the graphene-DNAzyme conformation, which will produce internal DNA cleavage-dependent effect. In this case, the quenched fluorescence in graphene-DNAzyme is quickly recovered to a large extent in 15 min. Compared with common DNAzyme-based sensors, the presented graphene-based catalytic beacon greatly improves the signal-to-background ratio, hence increasing the sensitivity (LOD=0.365 nM). Furthermore, the controllable DNA cleavage reaction provides an original and alternative internal method to regulate the interaction between graphene and DNA relative to the previous external sequence-specific hybridization-dependent regulation, which will open new opportunities for nucleic studies and sensing applications in the future.",

        "abstract": "A coupling process of anaerobic methanogenesis and electromethanogenesis was proposed to treat high organic load rate (OLR) wastewater. During the start-up stage, acetate removal efficiency of the electric-biological reactor (R1) reached the maximization about 19 percentage points higher than that of the control anaerobic reactor without electrodes (R2), and CH4 production rate of R1 also increased about 24.9% at the same time, while additional electric input was 1/1.17 of the extra obtained energy from methane. Coulombic efficiency and current recorded showed that anodic oxidation contributed a dominant part in degrading acetate when the metabolism of methanogens was low during the start-up stage. Along with prolonging operating time, aceticlastic methanogenesis gradually replaced anodic oxidation to become the main pathway of degrading acetate. When the methanogens were inhibited under the acidic conditions, anodic oxidation began to become the main pathway of acetate decomposition again, which ensured the reactor to maintain a stable performance. FISH analysis confirmed that the electric field imposed could enrich the H2/H(+)-utilizing methanogens around the cathode to help for reducing the acidity. This study demonstrated that an anaerobic digester with a pair of electrodes inserted to form a coupling system could enhance methanogenesis and reduce adverse impacts.",

        "abstract": "Membrane filtration provides effective solutions for removing contaminants, but achieving high permeability, good selectivity, and antifouling ability remains a great challenge for existing membrane filtration technologies. In this work, membrane filtration coupled with electrochemistry has been developed to enhance the filtration performance of a CNTs/Al2O3 membrane. The as-prepared CNTs/Al2O3 membrane, obtained by coating interconnected CNTs on an Al2O3 substrate, presented good pore-size tunability, mechanical stability, and electroconductivity. For the removal of a target (silica spheres as a probe) with a size comparable to the membrane pore size, the removal efficiency and flux at +1.5 V were 1.1 and 1.5 times higher, respectively, than those without electrochemical assistance. Moreover, the membrane also exhibited a greatly enhanced removal efficiency for contaminants smaller than the membrane pores, providing enhancements of 4 orders of magnitude and a factor of 5.7 for latex particles and phenol, respectively. These results indicated that both the permeability and the selectivity of CNTs/Al2O3 membranes can be significantly improved by electrochemical assistance, which was further confirmed by the removal of natural organic matter (NOM). The permeate flux and NOM removal efficiency at +1.5 V were about 1.6 and 3.0 times higher, respectively, than those without electrochemical assistance. In addition, the lost flux of the fouled membrane was almost completely recovered by an electrochemically assisted backwashing process.",

        "abstract": "To elucidate the effect of nitrite ion (NO\u2082(-)) on the photodegradation of organic pollutants, a 300 W mercury lamp and Pyrex tubes restricting the transmission of wavelengths below 290 nm were used to simulate sunlight, and the photodegradation processes of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) with different concentrations of NO\u2082(-) in freshwater and seawater were studied. The effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the photolysis of 2,4-D was also demonstrated using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The results indicated that the 2,4-D photolysis reaction followed the first-order kinetics in freshwater and seawater under different concentrations of NO\u2082(-). Meanwhile, the photochemical reaction rate of 2,4-D increased with increasing concentration of NO\u2082(-). When the concentration of NO\u2082(-) was lower than 23 mg/L, the photodegradation rate of 2,4-D in seawater was higher than that in freshwater. However, when the concentration of NO\u2082(-) was reached 230 mg/L, 2,4-D degradation slowed down in seawater. It was important to note that EPR spectra showed NO\u2082 radical was generated in the NO\u2082(-) solution under simulated sunlight irradiation, indicating that 2,4-D photodegradation could be induced by NO\u2082. These results show the key role of NO\u2082(-) in photochemistry and are helpful for better understanding of the phototransformation of environmental contaminants in natural aquatic systems.",

        "abstract": "Due to their build-in electric fields locating at interfaces of different materials, heterojunctions have shown excellent carrier separation ability and received wide attention in photocatalysis and photovoltaics. In general, larger interface area and smoother carrier transfer pathway are favorable for heterojunctions to achieve larger active area of build-in electric fields and longer photogenerated charge lifetime, respectively, and sequentially the heterojunctions may show optimized separation ability. However, there is hardly any report about this topic. In this paper, we design a new heterojunction material where a graphene (Gr) layer is close-fitting as the surface of the ZnIn2S4 microspheres (ZnIn2S4@Gr) in virtue of the electrostatic interaction between the functional groups of GO and the amino groups of ZnIn2S4 microspheres. Benefiting from the effective contact of Gr and ZnIn2S4 at their interface as well as the superior charge transfer ability of Gr, this structure displays good photocatalytic capability. The kinetic constant of phenol degradation on ZnIn2S4@Gr was 3.03 h(-1), which was 8.4-fold and 1.5-fold higher than those on ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4-Gr composites, respectively. Furthermore, the excellent performance was stable according to the result of the consecutive cycling experiment. These experimental results demonstrated that the large interface area and smooth carrier transfer pathway were significant for heterojunction materials to provide better photogenerated charge separation properties.",

        "abstract": "Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were prepared by electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) polymer solutions followed by thermal treatment. For the first time, the influence of stabilization procedure on the structure properties of CNFs was explored to improve the adsorption capacity of CNFs towards the environmental pollutants from aqueous solution. The adsorption of three organic chemicals including ciprofloxacin (CIP), bisphenol (BPA) and 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) on electrospun CNFs with high surface area of 2326m(2)/g and micro/mesoporous structure characteristics were investigated. The adsorption affinities were compared with that of the commercial powder activated carbon (PAC). The adsorption kinetics and isotherms showed that the maximum adsorption capacities (qm) of CNFs towards the three pollutants are sequenced in the order of CIP>BPA>2-CP, which are 2.6-fold (CIP), 1.6-fold (BPA) and 1.1-fold (2-CP) increase respectively in comparison with that of PAC adsorption. It was assumed that the micro/mesoporous structure of CNFs, molecular size of the pollutants and the \u03c0 electron interaction play important roles on the high adsorption capacity exhibited by CNFs. In addition, electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic interaction also contribute to the adsorption of CNFs. This study demonstrates that the electrospun CNFs are promising adsorbents for the removal of pollutants from aqueous solutions.",

The results demonstrated thatthe high-quality BDD film prepared here was suitable to be used as an electrode, with which the COD measurement could be conducted. The effect of several important experimental parameters, such as applied potentials, pH, flow rates, and supporting electrolyte concentrations, on the analytical performance was investigated. Under optimized testing conditions, the proposed method was successfully applied in the COD analysis of synthetic samples. The linear range and the detection limit were 2-175 and 1 mg L(-1), respectively. In addition, the COD values determined by the proposed method compared well with those analyzed bythe conventional method as demonstrated by small relative errors.",

        "abstract": "A zero valent iron (ZVI) bed with a pair of electrodes was installed in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor to create an enhanced condition to increase the rate of anaerobic granulation. The effects of an electric field and ZVI on granulation were investigated in three UASB reactors operated in parallel: an electric field enhanced ZVI-UASB reactor (reactor R1), a ZVI-UASB reactor (reactor R2) and a common UASB reactor (reactor R3). When a voltage of 1.4\u00a0V was supplied to reactor R1, COD removal dramatically increased from 60.3% to 90.7% over the following four days, while the mean granule size rapidly grew from 151.4\u00a0\u03bcm to 695.1\u00a0\u03bcm over the following 38 days. Comparatively, COD removal was lower and the increase in granule size was slower in the other two reactors (in the order: R1\u00a0>\u00a0R2\u00a0>\u00a0R3). The electric field caused the ZVI to more effectively buffer acidity and maintain a relatively low oxidation\u2013reduction potential in the reactor. In addition, the electric field resulted in a significant increase in ferrous ion leaching and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production. These changes benefited methanogenesis and granulation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that different microorganisms were dominant in the external and internal layers of the reactor R1 granules. Additionally, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis indicated that the relative abundance of methanogens in reactor R1 was significantly greater than in the other two reactors. Taken together, these results suggested that the use of ZVI combined with an electric field in an UASB reactor could effectively enhance the sludge granulation.",

The strategy involved preparation of TiO2 macroporous membrane as a backbone and subsequently coating it with mesoporous Ti-Mn catalyst layer. Scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope and nitrogen sorption isotherms characterization demonstrated that the TiO2 membrane was composed of TiO2 nanorods with 200-400nm diameter, 5\u03bcm length, and mesoporous Ti-Mn layer was coated on the membrane surface uniformly with the thickness of about 100nm and pore size of 10nm. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-rays photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometer showed that Ti-Mn mixed oxide was spread into the inner voids of the membrane to form a hierarchical porous structure. Treating simulated wastewater (aqueous solution of dye Red-3BS and Aniline) it was found that hierarchical porous catalytic membrane exhibited high catalytic ozonation capability which resulted in an enhancement of membrane antifouling, separation and degradation of organic pollutants when the membrane was used as a key device in the combined membrane and ozone system. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

Here we present an efficient and multifunctional metal-free electrocatalyst, vertically aligned boron and nitrogen codoped nanodiamond (VA-BND)/Si rod array (RA). It can achieve high electro-oxidation activity by varying its chemical composition while maintaining superior electro-reduction performance. Methanol oxidation was selected to evaluate its electro-oxidation activity towards small organic molecules in fuel cells. The VA-BND3/Si RA (B/C = 0.015 and N2 = 1.0%) presented superior methanol oxidation activity with a more negative peak potential compared with commercial Pt/C. Meanwhile, the durability of VA-BND3/Si RA was highly improved relative to that of the Pt/C catalyst. Reduction of refractory organic pollutants, 2,2\u2032,4,4\u2032-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), was chosen to study the electro-reduction activity of VA-BND3/Si RA. The VA-BND3/Si RA was found to be advantageous over the Pd electrode for electro-reduction of BDE-47 in both kinetics and current efficiency at -0.8 V. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of VA-BND/Si RA mainly originated from the doped B and N. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

Graphene sheet grafted Ag@AgCl composite is fabricated by photoreducing AgCl/graphene oxide (GO) hybrids prepared by deposition-precipitation method. The microscopic analysis and Raman scattering reveal the direct interface between Ag nanocrystal and graphene sheet, which manipulates the electronic structures of Ag@AgCl. UV-vis absorption spectra of Ag@AgCl/reduced GO (RGO) hybrids exhibit strong absorbance in the visible region due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption of Ag nanocrystal. In situ assembled Ag@AgCl/RGO plasmonic photocatalyst exhibits remarkable photocatalytic activity. Compared with bare Ag@AgCl nanoparticle, a 4-fold enhancement in the photodegradation rate toward rhodamine B is observed over Ag@AgCl/RGO hybrids under visible light irradiation. The large enhancement of photocatalytic activity was attributed to the effective charge transfer from plasmon-excited Ag nanocrystal to RGO, which suppress the charge recombination during photocatalytic process.

Literature values for PAHs and OCs obtained by the same method were 1.9\u20135.1 times of present values at +20 \u00b0C. Experimentally determined K SA ranged over six orders of magnitude, with log K SA from 4.5 for \u03b1-hexachlorocyclohexane at +30 \u00b0C to 10.4 for trans -nonachlor at \u221220 \u00b0C. Separate linear regressions of log K SA and reciprocal absolute temperature were employed at temperatures above 0 \u00b0C and below 0 \u00b0C. The calculated enthalpies associated with the phase transfer from the soil to the air (\u0394 H SA ) over 0 to +30 \u00b0C range from 78 to 108 kJ mol \u22121 , which are in a good agreement with the literature values. Keywords Soil/air partition coefficient Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) Organochlorine pesticides (OCs) Temperature-dependence 1 Introduction Partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds (SOCs) between gas and condensed phases is essential in modeling the environmental fate of these compounds because such sorption processes can slow down the long range transport of compounds in the atmosphere ( Nam et al., 2008 ) as well as the transformation processes, such as phototransformation ( Ciani et al., 2005 ) and biodegradation ( Xia et al., 2006 ). Among these processes, soil/air partitioning is notable since air is the major transport media and the vector of SOCs to humans ( McLachlan, 1996 ), while soil is the key reservoir of SOCs in the terrestrial environment ( Harrad et al., 1994; Wild and Jones, 1995 ). The research group of Goss has contributed a lot to the study of the partitioning of diverse compounds between soil components and air, such as bulk water surface ( Roth et al., 2002 ), bulk ice surface ( Goss, 1993a ), quartz sand ( Goss, 1992 ), clay minerals ( Goss, 1993b ), salts surface, and humic acid ( Niederer et al., 2007 ) and the effect of compounds\u2019 structure on their partitioning behavior ( Goss et al., 2008; Niederer and Goss, 2008 ). The partitioning between soil and air described by the partition coefficient ( K SA ) is temperature-dependent. It has been found that chemicals present in air experience a very strong tendency to condense into soil with the drop of temperature ( Mackay and Wania, 1995 ), and the regression between log K SA and the reciprocal temperature is approximately linear ( Goss and Schwarzenbach, 1999 ). The partition coefficients as a function of temperature have been determined for organochlorine pesticides (OCs) over a temperature range of 0\u201355 \u00b0C ( Meijer et al., 2003b ) and for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) over a temperature range of 5\u201360 \u00b0C ( Hippelein and McLachlan, 2000 ). But no data are available at temperature below 0 \u00b0C, which normally occurs in the middle and high altitude area in the winter. Northeast China (known as the old industrial base in China) has a long cold winter usually from November to February with the extremely low temperature even below \u221235 \u00b0C. An understanding of soil/air partitioning behavior at subzero is crucial for the study of the environmental fate of organic compounds in cold climates. Fugacity meter is a novel method for measuring the equilibrium partitioning of SOCs. The method was initially developed for plants ( Horstmann and McLachlan, 1992 ) and then was successfully employed to study the partitioning between soil and air ( Cousins et al., 1998; Hippelein and McLachlan, 1998, 2000; Meijer et al., 2003b; Wolters et al., 2008 ) and human faeces and air ( Moser and McLachlan, 2002 ). In the fugacity meter, air is passed over a solid phase in such a way that equilibrium is achieved. Gas-phase chemical is collected on a sorbent and the concentration of chemical in the gas phase is measured. The concentration in the solid phase is also measured. The soil/air partition coefficient is calculated from the quotient of concentrations in solid and gas phases as follows: (1) K SA = \u03c1 d C S C A where C S is the concentration in the soil (mg kg \u22121 ), C A is the concentration in air (mg L \u22121 ), and \u03c1 d is the density of the soil solids (g mL \u22121 ). Hence units of K SA are mass/volume of soil divided by mass/volume of air. In present study, the temperature-dependence of the soil/air partition coefficients for selected PAHs and OCs were measured by the solid-fugacity meter over the temperature range of 0\u201330 \u00b0C and, for the first time, over the temperature range of \u221230 to 0 \u00b0C, respectively. The enthalpies associated with the phase change from soil phase to air were also calculated. This work would be helpful for modeling the behavior and fate of organic chemicals, especially, in a low-temperature environment for the severe lack of information on the physicochemical properties at subzero temperatures in literatures. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Description of the contaminated soil The soil was a silty clay loam (4.6% sand, 76.1% silt and 19.3% clay) with an organic carbon content of 1.00%, a soil moisture content of 14%, and dry soil solid density of 2.2 g cm \u22123 , which was air dried prior to use. The bulk density of the soil after sieving (60 mesh) was 1.2 g cm \u22123 . The tested compounds are phenanthrene (Phe), fluoranthene (Flu), \u03b1-hexachlorocyclohexane (\u03b1-HCH), \u03b3-hexachlorocyclohexane (\u03b3-HCH), trans -chlordane (TC), o,p \u2032-DDE, cis -chlordane (CC) and trans -nonachlor (TN). The PAHs and OCs were spiked in two 200 g-soils separately (about 1 mg kg \u22121 for each compound). The soil spiked procedure was same as described in Hippelein and McLachlan (1998) . Five replicate sub-samples (1 g) were analyzed to investigate the homogeneity of the mixed soil. Of all the compounds tested, the standard deviations were within 10% of the mean concentrations in soil. Two dilutions of this soil (10 and 100 times) were prepared by mixing it with unspiked soil on the rotary evaporator without vacuum at least for 12 h. In most cases the soil water content was set to about 14% of soil dry weight. For the experiments at \u22125 \u00b0C, the soil water content was varied from 7% to 20%. 2.2 Measurement of K SA The experimental set-up as well as the air-humidified methods is given in the Supplementary Material (Fig. S1) . Briefly, the solid-fugacity meter has a capacity of about 0.43 L and 200 g of contaminated soils were rested on a glass frit in the fugacity meter. The pre-humidified air was passed over the soil column and when leaving the solid phase, gaseous PAHs or OCs carried by the air were trapped by the sorbent. A series of measurements were conducted at 15 different temperatures between \u221230 and +30 \u00b0C. Three replicates were made at each temperature. The concentrations in the soil were determined before and after the series of measurements. For all tested compounds, the difference of the concentrations in soils is lower than 15%, and such a difference can be attributed to the relatively small amount of chemical sampled in the air, implying that the processes which could affect the partitioning, such as biodegradation, were not significant over the experimental period. The sorbent for the gaseous phase compounds were 10 g Amberlit XAD-2 (Supelco, Munich, Germany). Prior to sampling, XAD-2 was cleaned in a Soxhlet apparatus for 24 h with 1:1 hexane/dichloromethane (v/v) for the measurement of OCs and with hexane for the measurement of PAHs, and subsequently dried at 80 \u00b0C in an oven. The sampling was carried out over periods of 0.5\u201372 h depending on the temperature at a flow rate of 100 L h \u22121 . For the experiments at \u22125 and \u221220 \u00b0C, the flow rate was at 15, 50 and 100 L h \u22121 , respectively to check whether the equilibrium between soil surface and the air was achieved. Blank air measurements were made using an empty fugacity meter. The potential background sorption in the fugacity meter was checked as follows: glass wool spiked with amount of tested compounds was placed in the fugacity meter without soil, air was passed through the fugacity meter at 100 L h \u22121 for 72 h, and then the glass wool and XAD-2 were analyzed. The results showed that the recoveries for all compounds were above 85% indicating the weak background sorption of the fugacity meter. 2.3 Validation of the method It has been confirmed that soil water content has no influence on the K SA above 0 \u00b0C, when the soil relative humidity (RH) maintained at 100% ( Hippelein and McLachlan, 1998 ). Therefore, the influence of soil water content on the K SA was only investigated under a frozen condition (at \u22125 \u00b0C) over a water content range of 7% (exceeds the amount at which 100% RH maintained for present soil) to 20%. No variance of K SA was observed as the soil water content changed from 7% to 20%. Water content of the tested soil in situ is about 14%, hence 14% was chosen in most cases. The equilibrium between the soil and gas stream was evaluated by varying the gas residence time in fugacity meter from 2.7 to 18 s, which corresponded to the flow rate from 100 to 15 L h \u22121 , at \u22125 and \u221220 \u00b0C, respectively. No disequilibrium was observed as all the compounds\u2019 concentrations in air were independent of the flow rate. The linear range of the partition isotherm was confirmed by comparing the K SA values in the contaminated soil and in the two dilutions (10 and 100 times) of this soil. The RSDs of K SA for all compounds were within 10% for the three contamination levels. 2.4 Extraction and analysis The XAD-2 traps analyzed for PAHs were extracted with 10:1 hexane/diethyl ether (v/v) ( Hippelein and McLachlan, 1998 ) and cleaned up using a silica gel/alumina column ( Hippelein et al., 1993 ). The extracts were reduced to 0.5 mL and hexamethylbenzene dissolved in hexane was added as internal standard for volume correction. The traps analyzed for OCs were extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus for 10 h using 1:1 hexane/dichloromethane (v/v) and cleaned up with an alumina column ( Meijer et al., 2003a ). The extracts were reduced to 0.5 mL, and hexachlorobenzene dissolved in hexane was added as internal standard for volume correction. Soil samples (1 g) analyzed for both PAHs and OCs were extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus for 24 h with 2:1 hexane/acetone (v/v). The extracts were dried using Na 2 SO 4 , cleaned up by respective methods as the air samples, subsequently concentrated to 0.5 mL, and corresponding internal standards were added. OCs were analyzed using GC-\u03bcECD (HP-6890, Hewlett-Packard, USA). The capillary column was HP-5 (30 m \u00d7 0.32 mm i.d. \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness). The oven temperature was programmed from 150 (held for 2 min) to 200 \u00b0C at a rate of 15 \u00b0C min \u22121 , and then from 200 to 230 \u00b0C (held for 6 min) at a rate of 2 \u00b0C min \u22121 . Injector and detector temperatures were held at 250 and 310 \u00b0C, respectively. The nitrogen was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min \u22121 . Injections (1 \u03bcL) were splitless with the split vent opened after 0.75 min at a purge flow rate of 60 mL min \u22121 . PAHs were determined using GC-MS (6890 GC, 5973N MSD, Agilent, USA). The capillary column was HP-5MS (30 m \u00d7 0.32 mm i.d. \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness). The oven temperature was programmed from 100 (held for 2 min) to 200 \u00b0C at a rate of 15 \u00b0C min \u22121 , and then from 200 to 230 \u00b0C (held for 2 min) at a rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . Injector, transfer line and ion source temperatures were 230, 280 and 230 \u00b0C, respectively. The helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min \u22121 . The MSD was operated in the SIM mode, and the electron energy and multiplier voltage were 70 eV and 1420 V, respectively. The MSD was adjusted to monitor m/z values of 178 for Phe and 202 for Flu, all with 100 ms dwell time. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Results of K SA measurements Results of log K SA for PAHs and OCs at 20 \u00b0C are given in Table 1 as well as the reported literature values for comparison. The measured K SA at 20 \u00b0C are, in general, lower than the literature values with a factor of 1.96 for Flu to 5.13 for \u03b3-HCH ( Table 1 ). The K SA values for PAHs were taken from Hippelein and McLachlan (1998) which were determined at 21 \u00b0C in a silty sand soil with the same organic carbon as present study. The K SA values of OCs from Meijer et al. (2003b) were determined into three different types of soils: soybean soil, volcanic soil and muck soil. As the organic carbon contents were different from present study, a correction of organic carbon contents was made to literature K SA for OCs. Among the three soils, the soybean soil is a typical agricultural soil, which is used for comparison. In Meijer et al. (2003b) , no further treatments were made to the particle size of the soils. Also in Hippelein and McLachlan (1998) , soils particle size (lower than 2 mm) was larger than present study. The difference in soil particle size perhaps accounts for the difference between present and literature K SA values, because there are more regions in the large soil particle where organic matter are not available to the air, resulting in a decrease of compounds\u2019 concentrations in air. Experimental data show a good reproducibility ( Table S1 in the Supplementary Material ). In most cases, standard deviations were less than 10% of the means K SA for determinations above 0 \u00b0C and larger deviations were observed at lower temperatures for the OCs attributed to the interferences during the GC analysis. Of all compounds tested, the K SA increased generally by 4.5 orders of magnitude over temperature range of about 60 \u00b0C, indicating that OCs and PAHs experience a strong tendency to partition into soil at lower temperatures. The K SA increased by a factor of 31 for Phe to 116 for TN with temperature decreasing from +30 to 0 \u00b0C, while this increase became more pronounced at subzero temperatures, by a factor of 35 for Phe to 537 for TN only with a decline of temperature from 0 to \u221220 \u00b0C. 3.2 Temperature-dependence of K SA Log K SA measured at subzero temperatures increased linearly with reciprocal absolute temperature which is consistent with the phenomena often observed above 0 \u00b0C ( Hippelein and McLachlan, 2000; Meijer et al., 2003b ). But plots of log K SA vs. 1/ T exhibited two separate regression lines below and above 0 \u00b0C. Values of K SA as a function of temperature are presented in Fig. 1 for Phe and Flu over the temperature range of \u221225 to +30 \u00b0C and in Fig. 2 for \u03b1-HCH and \u03b3-HCH (\u221230 to +30 \u00b0C), TC, CC and o,p \u2032-DDE (\u221225 to +30 \u00b0C), and TN (\u221220 to +30 \u00b0C). The parameters of Eq. (2) are listed in Table 2 . Linear regressions between log K SA and 1/ T were excellent, with r 2 > 0.98 ( Table 2 ). (2) log K SA = A + 1000 B T An alternative expression of soil/air partition coefficient which is determined on a pressure basis and its temperature-dependence equation are as follows: (3) K SA \u2032 = K SA RT (4) log K SA \u2032 = a + 1000 b T where K \u2032 SA has units of concentration/pressure; a and b are regression coefficients. Theoretically, the relationship between log K SA \u2032 and 1/ T is linear ( Harner and Bidleman, 1996, 1998 ), while the relationship between log K SA and 1/ T is only approximately linear (see Supplementary Material ). However, Eq. (2) has been previously used to describe the temperature-dependence of the partitioning between a condensed phase and air at temperature above 0 \u00b0C ( K\u00f6mp and McLachlan, 1997; Hippelein and McLachlan, 2000; Shoeib and Harner, 2002; Meijer et al., 2003b ). The soil/air partitioning data in temperature range of 0 to +30 \u00b0C can be treated by plotting log K SA \u2032 vs. 1/ T (Eq. (4) ), and using the regression coefficients, a and b, the K SA \u2032 can be extrapolated to subzero temperatures and then multiplying the extrapolated K SA \u2032 values by RT to yield K SA . Values of K SA obtained in this way (hollow squares in Figs. 1 and 2 ) are significant different from the measured data (squares in Figs. 1 and 2 ). Thus the bend of the regression curves at 0 \u00b0C is not caused by the nonlinearity in plots of log K SA vs. 1/ T over the temperature range of \u221230 to +30 \u00b0C. The K SA shows a strong temperature-dependence over the tested temperature ranges. The slope B (Eq. (2) ) was from 4.11 to 4.84 for the PAHs and from 4.75 to 5.65 for the OCs ( Table 2 ). And K SA was more sensitive to the temperature below 0 \u00b0C, with B from 5.51 to 6.10 for the PAHs and from 6.23 to 9.68 for the OCs. The enthalpy of phase change from soil to air, \u0394 H SA , ranged from 78 to 108 kJ mol \u22121 and 105 to 185 kJ mol \u22121 ( Table 3 ) for the temperature ranges of \u2a7e0 \u00b0C and \u2a7d0 \u00b0C, respectively. Larger slopes were observed for CC and TN at \u2a7d0 \u00b0C resulting in higher \u0394 H SA . These were caused by the poor reproductions of K SA at low temperatures ( Table S1 ). Excluding the K SA values at \u221220 \u00b0C for CC, and \u221215 and \u221220 \u00b0C for TN, the slopes are 7.95 and 7.76, the \u0394 H SA are 152.2 and 148.6 kJ mol \u22121 for CC and TN, respectively. Using these \u0394 H SA at \u2a7d0 \u00b0C difference in \u0394 H SA between temperatures \u2a7e0 \u00b0C and \u2a7d 0 \u00b0C is generally about 33 kJ mol \u22121 indicating that more energy is required to remove the PAHs and OCs from soil to air at temperatures \u2a7d0 \u00b0C. With the exception of \u03b3-HCH, \u0394 H SA values (\u2a7e0 \u00b0C) were in a good agreement with the literature values ( Meijer et al., 2003b ), regardless of the organic carbon content and soil type. The enthalpies associated with the phase change of a chemical from octanol to air, \u0394 H OA , have been reported for PAHs ( Harner and Bidleman, 1998 ) and OCs ( Shoeib and Harner, 2002 ). Similarly, \u0394 H VAP represents the enthalpy involved with the phase change of a chemical from the subcooled liquid phase of the chemical to air, which is calculated from the temperature-dependent values of subcooled liquid vapor for PAHs and OCs ( Hinckley et al., 1990 ). In all cases \u0394 H SA was larger than both \u0394 H OA and \u0394 H VAP, and this was consistent with the work of others ( Hippelein and McLachlan, 2000; Meijer et al., 2003b ) demonstrating that the PAHs and OCs undergo stronger interactions with soil matrix than they do with octanol or their own pure phase. 3.3 Influence of physiochemical properties on K SA As the K OA is a surrogate of K SA in the case when the K SA is not available in assessing the transport and fate of organic compounds, the relationships between these two coefficients for the PAHs and the OCs are discussed. Temperature-dependent relationships of K OA for Phe and Flu are available in Harner and Bidleman (1998) and for \u03b1-HCH, \u03b3-HCH, TC, CC and TN are available in Shoeib and Harner (2002) , so the K OA values for these compounds can be corrected to the respective temperatures. According to the discussion of K SA , there should be potential errors in extrapolating K OA values to the temperatures exceeding the tested temperature range, for K OA was determined on a volume basis. However, this error is relatively minor (less than 6% at all temperatures tested) and can be neglected here. With the exception of \u221230 \u00b0C, linear regressions were performed between log K SA (including three parallel measurements) and log K OA for OCs at each temperature ( Fig. 3 ). All regressions were significant ( p < 0.05). Variance analysis performed on the regressions showed that the slopes of the regression lines at different temperatures were not significantly different from each other at the p < 0.05 level with an average value of 0.63. The deviation of the slope from 1 indicated that the soil organic matter is different from octanol with respect to the interactions that control the sorption process of OCs ( Goss and Schwarzenbach, 1998 ). Using the same slope for the regression lines at all temperatures, for the reason that it was previously confirmed that there is no significant difference in the slope when regressed separately, we can investigate the difference in intercept between the regression lines. The result showed that the intercept as a measure of the sorbing capacity increased gradually with the decline of temperature. The extended Karickhoff equation based on K OA was often employed to predict K SA ( Hippelein and McLachlan, 1998 ). The expression is (5) K SA = 0.411 f OC \u03c1 d K OA where f OC is organic carbon content (%). Substituting the f OC with 1.00%, \u03c1 d with 2.2 g cm \u22123 , Eq. (5) was plotted in Fig. 3 in dash lines. The predicted Karickhoff values were generally larger than the measured values with a factor of 3 for the PAHs at +20 \u00b0C. These differences were greater for the OCs but never exceeded one order of magnitude with the exception of TN (factor = 18) at +20 \u00b0C. The higher predicted Karickhoff value for TN was due to the larger reported log K OA value. Furthermore, the deviations between the measured and predicted K SA values became smaller for all the compounds as the temperature drops below 0 \u00b0C due to the fact that the notable enhancement of the sorption capacity from 0 \u00b0C as observed in the temperature-dependence of the K SA . K OA -based Karickhoff equation could be used to roughly estimate the K SA for PAHs and OCs. 4 Conclusions The temperature-dependence of the K SA for the selected PAHs and OCs are investigated at temperature above and below 0 \u00b0C. Separate linear regressions of log K SA and reciprocal absolute temperature were employed over these temperature ranges. The results indicated that slopes for the regression over \u221230 to 0 \u00b0C were larger than that over 0 to +30 \u00b0C for all the tested compounds, implying the greater enhanced partitioning into soil with the decline of temperature at subzero temperatures. Present data would be useful for modeling the persistence and transport of the PAHs and OCs in the environment, especially in a low-temperature environment. The \u0394 H SA values calculated over 0 to +30 \u00b0C, range from 78 to 108 kJ mol \u22121 for all tested compound, which are in a good agreement with the literature values. While \u0394 H SA is larger than reported \u0394 H OA and \u0394 H VAP demonstrating that the PAHs and OCs undergo stronger interactions with soil matrix.

        "abstract": "The activated sludge (AS) process is widely applied in dyestuff wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs); however, the nitrogen removal efficiency is relatively low and the effluent does not meet the indirect discharge standards before being discharged into the industrial park's WWTP. Hence it is necessary to upgrade the WWTP with more advanced technologies. Moving bed biofilm processes with suspended carriers in an aerobic tank are promising methods due to enhanced nitrification and denitrification. Herein, a pilot-scale integrated free-floating biofilm and activated sludge (IFFAS) process was employed to investigate the feasibility of enhancing nitrogen removal efficiency at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs). The results showed that the effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrate (NH-N) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations of the IFFAS process were significantly lower than those of the AS process, and could meet the indirect discharge standards. PCR-DGGE and FISH results indicated that more nitrifiers and denitrifiers co-existed in the IFFAS system, promoting simultaneous nitrification and denitrification. Based on the pilot results, the IFFAS process was used to upgrade the full-scale AS process, and the effluent COD, NH-N and TN of the IFFAS process were 91-291 mg/L, 10.6-28.7 mg/L and 18.9-48.6 mg/L, stably meeting the indirect discharge standards and demonstrating the advantages of IFFAS in dyestuff wastewater treatment.",

Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX), and X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) indicated that the as-prepared samples were a vertically well-aligned TiO2-Pt coaxial nanotube array, and the outer TiO2 nanotube was anatase with the preferential orientation of (101) plane. The asymmetry of the current-voltage (I-V) curve revealed that a schottky barrier had been formed between TiO2 and Pt. The enhanced separation of photogenerated holes and electrons was demonstrated by surface photovoltage (SPV) and photocurrent measurement. For the degradation of phenol under UV light irradiation, the TiO2-Pt coaxial nanotube array exhibited a much higher photocatalytic efficiency (up to 87%) than did the TiO2 nanotube array, and the kinetic constant of it was 2.3 times as great as that of the TiO2 nanotube array. \u00a9 2008 American Chemical Society.",

Under the conditions of microwave power 400 W, influent flow 6.4 mL min(-1) and air flow 120 mL min(-1), phenolic solutions with high concentration (initial concentrations of PNP and PCP solutions were 1469 and 1,454 mg L(-1), respectively) were treated effectively by Pt/GAC, 86% PNP and 90% PCP were degraded and total organic carbon (TOC) removal reached 85% and 71%, respectively. Compared with GAC, loaded Pt apparently accelerated oxidative reaction so that Pt/GAC had a better degrading and mineralizing efficiencies for PNP.

The process consisted of a granular activated carbon (GAC) fixed bed reactor, a MW source, solution and air supply system, and a heat exchanger. The process was operated in continuous flow mode. Air was applied for oxygen supply. GAC acted as a MW energy absorption material as well as the catalyst for PNP degradation. MW power, air flow, GAC dose, and influent flow proved to be major factors which influenced PNP degradation. The results showed that PNP was degraded effectively by this new process. Under a given condition (PNP concentration 1330mg/L, MW power 500 W, influent flow 6.4 mL/min, air flow 100 mL/min), PNP removed 90%, corresponding to 80% of TOC removal. The pathway of PNP degradation was deduced based on GC-MS identification of course products. PNP experienced sequential oxidation steps and mineralized ultimately. Nitro-group of PNP converted to nitrite and nitrate. Biodegradability of the solution was improved apparently after treatment by MW assisted oxidation process, which benefit to further treatment of the solution using biochemical method.",

However, their origins are not fully understood. We explored the feasibility of the generation of HO-PBDEs through photochemical processes from bromophenol, a commonly detected pollutant with anthropogenic source in freshwater and natural source in the marine environment. The results showed that when 2,4-dibromophenol (2,4-diBP) was irradiated in aquatic solutions under simulated sunlight, significant amounts of 2'-hydroxy-2,3',4,5'-tetrabromodipheyl ether (2'-HO-BDE68) were rapidly formed as the dimeric product of 2,4-diBP. The formation of 2'-HO-BDE68 intensified with the increase of light intensity and with the initial concentration increase of 2,4-diBP, whereas it weakened with an increase in pH. Moreover, Fe(III) and fulvic acid played important roles in the formation of 2'-HO-BDE68. This study provides important insight into a possible source of HO-PBDEs from bromophenols in natural aquatic systems through photochemical approaches.",

The formation of ZnO seed-layer by the anodic oxidation technique (AOT) plays an important role in the subsequent\n growth of highly oriented ZnO nanorods arrays. Temperature also proved to be a significant factor in the growth of ZnO nanorods\n and had a great effect on their optical properties. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, selected-area electron diffraction (SAED)\n pattern and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) indicated that the needle-like ZnO nanorods were single crystal in nature and that\n they had grown up preferentially along the [0001] direction. The well-aligned ZnO nanorods arrays on Zn substrates exhibited\n strong UV emission at around 380\u00a0nm at room temperature. To investigate their potential as photocatalysts, degradation of\n pentachlorophenol (PCP) in aqueous solution was carried out using photocatalytic processes, with comparison to direct photolysis.\n After 1\u00a0h, the degradation efficiencies of PCP by direct photolysis and photocatalytic processes achieved 57% and 76% under\n given experimental conditions, respectively. This improved degradation efficiency of PCP illustrates that ZnO nanorods arrays\n on Zn substrates have good photocatalytic activity. This simple low-temperature seed-layer growth approach in solution resulted\n in the development of an effective and low-cost fabrication process for high-quality ZnO nanorods arrays with good optical\n and photocatalytic properties that can be applicable in many fields such as photocatalysis, photovoltaic cells, luminescent\n sensors, and photoconductive sensors.",

        "abstract": "Relationship between the photoinductive activity and the properties of humic acids (HA) fractions were investigated with and without Fe(III). Three fractions were separated based on the molecular weight (M(w)) and were obtained following the order of M(w): F(A)>F(B)>F(C). Compared to F(A) and F(B), photodegradation of atrazine under simulated sunlight was much faster in solution containing F(C), whose structure was dominated by greater aromaticity, more oxygen groups and fluorophores. The interaction of HA fractions and Fe(III) was studied using fluorescence spectrometry and F(C) had the largest quenching constant. The capacity of electron transfer, estimated from the amount of photoformed Fe(II), was also highest for F(C). Thus, the Fe(III)-F(C) complex was efficient in phototransformation of atrazine in nearly neutral aqueous solutions. These results suggest that the aromaticity and oxygen groups content of HA exert great influence on the binding ability of metals and on the fate of pollutants in natural waters.",

        "abstract": "Integrating a microfiltration with photocatalysis is a rising method for improving the anti-fouling capability of membrane by degradating pollutants blocked the pores of membrane via photocatalysis. However, the quick recombination of photogenerated charges in the photocatalytic layer limited the performance of this photocatalytic membrane. To inhibit the recombination of photogenerated charges, a CNTs-TiO2/Al2O3 composite membrane was designed and fabricated. Compared with TiO 2/Al2O3 membranes (the typical photocatalytic membrane), the CNTs-TiO2/Al2O3 composite membrane displayed lower photoluminescence intensity and higher photocurrent density, which indicated the higher separation efficiency of its photogenerated charges. To get a good combination of membrane flux and rejection, the CNTs content and the thickness of CNTs-TiO2 layer was optimized. Under the best prepared parameters, the Polyethylene glycol (PEG) rejection and permeate flux was 70% and 980 L m-2 h-1, respectively. The optimized CNTs-TiO2/Al2O3 composite membrane under UV light irradiation exhibited 3 times higher of the stable permeate flux than filtration alone, and the humic acid removal rate of composite membrane was 10% higher than TiO2/Al2O3 membranes. This work could provide an alternative way to improve rejection and photocatalytic efficiency for conventional photocatalytic membranes and facilitate their practical application in water treatment. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "The soil/air partition coefficients (KSA) for hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in oilcontaminated (crude oil and diesel) rice paddy field soils were measured in a solid fugacity meter at different oil concentrations over the temperature range of 5 to 30\u00b0C at 100% relative humidity. The results showed that values of KSA increased with a decrease of temperature. As for oil content, there is a critical separate phase concentration (CSPC) above which KSA increased with increasing of oil content. When oil content is above CSPC, oil plays a role as a separate phase that enhances the sorption capacity of the soil. At a given temperature (20\u00b0C) values of CSPC depended on the natural organic matter (NOM) contents of the soil, while for a given oil concentration they depended on the temperature. The normalized oil/air partition coefficients (Kair oil) forHCB deduced from KSA for oils and experimentally determined with crude oil/quartz sand system were similar and 0.7-7 times higher than the normalized organic/air partition coefficient (Kair OC), which implied that oil was a super sorbent. The enthalpies (\u0394HSA) for crude oil and diesel were 64.9 and 55.7 kJ mol-1, respectively. \u00a9 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical oxidation based on SO and OH generated from sulfate electrolyte is a cost-effective method for degradation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). However, sulfate activation remains a great challenge due to lack of active and robust electrodes. Herein, B/N codoped diamond (BND) electrode is designed for electrochemical degradation of POPs via sulfate activation. It is efficient and stable for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) oxidation with first-order kinetic constants of 2.4 h and total organic carbon removal efficiency of 77.4% (3 h) at relatively low current density of 4 mA cm. The good activity of BND is mainly originated from the B and N codoping effect. PFOA oxidation rate at sulfate electrolyte is significantly enhanced (2.3-3.4 times) compared with those at nitrate and perchlorate electrolytes. At sulfate, PFOA oxidation rate decreases slightly in the presence of OH quencher while it declines significantly with SO and OH quenchers, indicate both SO and OH contribute to PFOA oxidation but SO contribution is more significant. Based on intermediates analysis, proposed mechanism for PFOA degradation is that PFOA is oxidized to shorter chain perfluorocarboxylic acids gradually by SO and OH until it is mineralized.",

The pore sizes of the prepared membrane were mainly controlled by the sol properties and the calcination conditions. The influence of different parameters such as additives and solvents on the hydrolysis and polycondensation properties of the sols was studied by DTA\u2013TG and viscosity measurements. The TiO 2 /ZrO 2 composite ceramic membranes were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Composite membrane permeability and rejection properties were also investigated. The results proved that the range of composite membrane flux and retention could be controlled by controlling the amount of polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEG in titania sol systems was suitable for use as an organic additive to fabricate crack-free composite membranes. The larger the amount of PEG added to the precursor solution, the larger the size and number of pores produced in the prepared membranes when the PEG was completely combusted during heat-treatment. By controlling the amount of PEG added to the precursor solution, TiO 2 /ZrO 2 composite ceramic membranes with different pore sizes were prepared, which can be used in photocatalytic membrane reactors and applied in liquid\u2013liquid or liquid\u2013solid separation in future research.",

        "abstract": "For adsorptive separation processes, the adsorption rate and capacity are two important factors affecting the costs. This study describes the anodic polarization of activated carbon fibers (ACFs), which can enhance the adsorption rate and capacity of aniline. The electrosorption kinetics and the affecting factors (bias potential, electrolyte, and pH) of isotherms for aniline on ACFs were investigated. The adsorption/electrosorption of aniline on ACFs follow pseudo-first-order adsorption kinetics, and the adsorption rate improves with increasing bias potential. The electrosorption isotherms, which exhibit a variety of responses depending on bias potential, electrolyte and pH, follow the two classical models of Langmuir and Freundlich. With electrosorption of aniline from aqueous solution, a two-fold enhancement of adsorption capacity is achievable. The initial and saturated ACFs were characterized using scanning electron micrograph (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The SEM micrographs show that the surface of ACFs is not oxidized, which is also verified by cyclic voltammetry results. The FT-IR spectroscopy suggests that the interaction between aniline and ACFs is main weak physisorption instead of chemisorption. These experimental results suggest that the electrochemical polarization of ACFs can effectively improve the adsorption rate and capacity of aniline, which may be due to the enhanced affinity between aniline and ACFs instead of the oxidation on the surface of ACFs or in the solution.",

Analysis of fresh and spent catalysts by XRD, BET, XPS, TG and FTIR indicated that Ce sites were sulfated preferentially over Ce-Fe/WMH during the SCR reaction in the presence of SO2, which could increase the amount of surface active oxygen species. On the other hand, the formation of surface hydroxyls due to the hydration of SO4 2- could supply more Br?nsted acid sites to adsorb NH3 in the form of NH4 +. These two factors played significant roles in the good SO2 durability of Ce-Fe/WMH. In addition, the sulfation of CeO2 on catalyst surface might approach a stable state upon certain amount of SO2 in reactant gas. The reaction mechanism study showed that only Eley-Rideal reaction pathway between ionic NH4 +, coordinated NH3 and gaseous NO dominated in the reaction; the Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction pathway was cut off by the sulfation, resulting in the rapid decrease of NOx conversion in the early period of SCR reaction in the presence of SO2. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Herein, we reported the assembly of colloidal graphene (CG) and microcystin (MC)-LR-DNA bioconjugates to develop a homogeneous competitive fluorescence-based immunoassay for rapid and sensitive detection of MC-LR in water samples. Initially, the MC-LR-DNA probe was quickly adsorbed onto the CG surface through the strong noncovalent \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions and can be effectively quenched benefiting from the high quenching efficiency of CG. In contrast, the competitive binding of anti-MC-LR with MC-LR-DNA destroyed the graphene/MC-LR-DNA interaction, thus resulting in the restoration of fluorescence signal. This signal transduction mechanism made it possible for analysis of the target MC-LR. Taking advantage of the colloidal nature of the as-prepared graphene, the assay was carried out in homogeneous solution throughout, which avoided numerous immobilization, incubation, and washing steps that were necessary to traditional heterogeneous immunoassays, thereby reducing the whole assay time (within less than 35 min) and allowing a much better antigen-antibody interaction. Moreover, due to the direct competitive mode, the assay did not involve any antibody labeling or modification process, which would be beneficial to preserve the binding affinity of antigen-antibody. Under optimal conditions, the proposed immunosensor can be applied for quantitative analysis of MC-LR with a detection limit of 0.14 \u03bcg/L, which satisfied the World Health Organization (WHO) provisional guideline limit of 1 \u03bcg/L for MC-LR in drinking water, thus providing a powerful tool for rapid and sensitive monitoring of MC-LR in environmental samples.",

Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images revealed that the TiO 2 film completely covered the surface of the Au nanorods, which resulted in TiO 2 shell Au core nanorods. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed that the TiO 2 film was anatase with preferential orientation in the (101) plane. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra showed a shift in the absorption edge toward the visible region because of the formation of a Schottky junction between Au and TiO 2. A new absorption peak that ranged from 400 to 800 nm appeared because of the localized surface plasmon resonance of the Au nanorod arrays. For the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B under UV light irradiation, the TiO 2/Au nanorod array exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity and its kinetic constant was 2.0 times that of pristine TiO 2 and 1.3 times that of a TiO 2/Au film. The enhanced photocatalysis was attributed to the high surface volume ratio, an improved UV light response, efficient separation, and the convenient migration of photogenerated charge carriers because of the one-dimensional nanorod structure and the Schottky junction between Au and TiO 2. This work could provide new insights into the fabrication of a high performance photocatalyst and thus facilitate practical environmental applications.",

        "abstract": "ZnIn2S4 film was fabricated on Ti substrate by a two-step approach including electrodeposition and annealing. The film obtained after electrodeposition was composed of Zn, In, and S. Then this precursor film was gradually converted to hexagonal phase ZnIn2S4 during the process of annealing in a nitrogen flow. The crystallographic structures and photoresponse ability of the film could be affected significantly by the annealing temperature. From diffuse reflection spectra, ZnIn2S4 film annealed at 500 degrees C exhibited the highest absorption intensity in visible light region among all the samples, resulting in a high photoresponse in the electrochemical measurement. The microstructures of ZnIn2S4 were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, and the results indicated that the interlayer distance was 0.295 nm, corresponding to d(104) space of hexagonal ZnIn2S4. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectra showed that the atomic ratio of Zn:In:S was 9.3:20.3:39.5, which was close to the stoichiometry ZnIn2S4. The photocatalytic ability of ZnIn2S4 was investigated by photoelectrocatalytic inactivation of Escherichia coli ( E. coli) with the initial concentration of approximately 3 x 10(8) colony forming units per milliliter. More than 3 logs of E. coli were killed within 60 min with the ZnIn2S4 film under visible light, and when the photocatalytic process was assisted by a 0.6 V positive potential, no surviving bacteria were detected after 60 min of inactivation.",

        "abstract": "In this work, hierarchically porous silicon was fabricated through electro-assisted chemical etching using a silicon wafer as a substrate. Pores with an average diameter of ca. 1200. nm (macropores) were observed and a large number of nanopores with a diameter of less than 5. nm were uniformly distributed over the surface of the macropore, forming the hierarchically porous silicon with nanopores in macropores structure (NP-MPSi). UV-vis diffuse reflection measurements indicated that NP-MPSi has a bandgap of 2.12. eV, which is 1.0. eV higher than that of the original silicon wafer because of the quantum confinement effect caused by the nanopores. Mott-Schottky experiments further demonstrated that the increase in bandgap of NP-MPSi arises from a positive shift of the valence band potential, which improves its capability for photocatalytic oxidation. NP-MPSi exhibited higher photoelectrochemical stability than macroporous silicon (MPSi), a comparison sample lacking nanopores. Using phenol as an example, photocatalytic experiments under irradiation with a Xe lamp demonstrated that the kinetic constants of phenol degradation and total organic carbon removal using NP-MPSi were nearly 3.5 and 8.0 times larger, respectively, than those using MPSi. This unique porous silicon material is therefore an attractive photocatalyst for environmental applications. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

Single application of PFOS showed no inhibition on the growth of S. obliquus below 40 mg L(-1), whereas PFOS acting with pentachlorophenol resulted in higher algal growth inhibition in comparison with pentachlorophenol alone. A maximum increase of 45% in the growth inhibition was observed at a pentachlorophenol concentration of 2.56 mg L(-1) together with a PFOS concentration of 40 mg L(-1). On the contrary, the algal growth inhibition of atrazine and diuron was depressed by PFOS. Furthermore, cell uptake was examined to gain some insights into the mechanisms of the effects of PFOS on the toxicity of the other compounds. Cell uptake of pentachlorophenol increased while that of atrazine and diuron was reduced in cells that have been exposed to PFOS. The effects of PFOS on the toxicity of pentachlorophenol, atrazine and diuron were possibly related to the influence of PFOS on the cell uptake of these hydrophobic compounds. Results suggested that PFOS influenced the cell uptake and toxicity of structurally different compounds in dissimilar manners and potentially increased the accessibility and toxicity of more hydrophobic compounds to algal cells.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports experimental results on removal of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS), using silica/titania nanorods/nanotubes composite membrane with photocatalytic capability. This multifunctional composite membrane has been successfully prepared from colloidal X- silica/titania sols (X denotes molar percent of silica) by the sol-gel technique. The prepared nanorods/nanotubes composite membranes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), scanning probe microscope (SPM) and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). XRD patterns confirmed that the embedding of amorphous silica into nanophase titania matrix helped to increase the thermal stability of titania and control the size of titania particles. The small size titania particles with anatase phase played an important role in formation of silica/titania nanorods/nanotubes composite membranes with photocatalytic capability. The percentage of anatase phase titania reached 93% when 20%-silica/titania nanorods/nanotubes composite membrane calcined at 400 8C for 2 h. Most (95%) of the pore volume was located in mesopores of diameters ranging from 1.4 to 10 nm. The experimental results showed that the removal of SDBS achieved 89% after 100 min by combining the photocatalysis with membrane filtration techniques. Although the SDBS was not completely decomposed by photocatalysis, the degradation of the SDBS helped to enhance composite membrane flux and prevent membrane fouling. It was possible to treat successfully surfactant wastewater using multifunctional silica/titania nanorods/nanotubes composite membrane by means of a continuous process; this could be interesting for industrial applications. # 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Keywords Electrocatalytic dechlorination Activated carbon fiber Palladium Pentachlorophenol 1 Introduction Contamination of water and soil by chlorophenolic compounds now represents a significant environmental burden due to their widespread industrial use, inherent toxicity and persistence in the environment [1] . Chlorophenols are usually used as the intermediates for organic synthesis, wood preservatives and pesticides. The toxicity of these compounds is connected with the chlorine content, and their biodegradability is strongly affected by chlorine substitution in the molecules. Most chlorophenols are listed as priority pollutants by the US EPA [2] . Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds are recalcitrant towards disposal. Biological treatment of low concentration of such materials in aqueous waste streams often leaves the chlorinated compounds untreated or required a long time, e.g. several days [3,4] . The chemical hydrodehalogenation methods have been developed based on zero-valent metals, such as iron, known as dissolving metal reductions [5\u20138] . Iron has been used to dechlorinate compound containing one or two carbon atoms [5,6] . Treatment of halogenated aromatic compounds has been suffered slow reaction rate [7,8] . Therefore, it is desirable to develop efficient and safe alternative technology for the dechlorination of chloroaromatic compounds. Recently, the electrochemical reductive approach has been suggested as a promising method for detoxification of chlorine-containing aromatic hydrocarbons [9\u201314] . This method ensured the selective removal of chlorine atoms under mild experimental conditions without using the highly reactive reducing agents. As a result, the much less toxic dechlorinated products could be treated further by more convenient and economic means, for example, biodegradation. In particular, electrochemical processes have been developed for the destruction of carbon\u2013halogen bonds. However, in many eases, the effective performance required the use of non-aqueous reaction media mainly aprotic solvents [15\u201319] or environmentally unpleasant cathode materials, such as mercury or lead [9,10,15] , which made such methods unattractive. Recently, the dehalogenation of aromatic compounds in aqueous medium by electrochemical hydrodehalogenation using Pd as catalyst has been reported [11\u201314] . Dabo et al. reported 99% conversion of pentachlorophenol to phenol over Pd (5 wt.%)/Al 2 O 3 entrapped in a reticulated vitreous carbon electrode at 75 \u00b0C [12] . In general, electrochemical hydrodehalogenation of low concentration compounds in aqueous solution observed low current efficiency and high energy consumption. These features render the approach unattractive with respect to the treatment of large volumes of organic wastewater with low concentrations. Activated carbon fiber (ACF) is widely used for water purification due to its high adsorption capacity and fast adsorption rates for organics [20] . And Pd is usually employed as catalyst loaded on inert supports like carbon for the electrochemical reactions [21] . In present work, we reported an adsorption/electroreduction process using Pd loaded ACF for the treatment of pentachlorophenol (PCP). Special attentions were paid to the adsorption capacity of Pd/ACF, the catalytic activity and the influence of current density on the efficiency of PCP dechlorination. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals and materials The following chemicals were used as received: pentachlorophenol (PCP, >99%, Fanghua Agent Company, China); tetramethyl-ammonium chloride (TMAC1, >99%, Kemiou Agent Company, China); methanol, acetone, dichloromethane and acetonitrile (HPLC-grade, Tedia Agent Company, USA); PdCl 2 (>99%, Tianjin Chemical Reagent Company, China). ACF made from polyacrylonitrile resin was supplied by Anshan Activated Carbon Fiber Company, China. 2.2 Apparatus and procedures 2.2.1 Preparation of Pd/ACF electrode After cleaned with deionized water, the ACF was boiled in 1 M HNO 3 for 3 h, then rinsed with deionized water and dried for 24 h at 100 \u00b0C. The surface area of the ACF was determined by the BET method. PdCl 2 with various concentrations in 1 M HCl solutions were deposited into the ACF by incipient-wetness method. The Pd-impregnated ACF was then dried at 80 \u00b0C for 4 h and was electroreduced in 0.3 M H 2 SO 4 solution. Surface characterization of the Pd/ACF was performed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM, JSM-5600L, UK) and X-ray Diffractometer (XRD, LabxXRD-6000, Shimadzu, Japan) using Cu K\u03b1 as radiation. Contents of Pd were determined by ICP-AES (Advantage, IRIS, USA.). 2.2.2 Electrocatalytic reactor Electrocatalytic dechlorination of PCP was carried out in a Teflon-made H-cell divided into two compartments by cation-exchange membrane (Nafion N324, Dupont Company, USA), as shown schematically in Fig. 1 . The volume of each electrolyte compartment was 50 mL. The working electrode was a piece of Pd/ACF (15 mm \u00d7 15 mm \u00d7 3mm and 70 mg in weight), which was fixed on tile titanium mesh. The working electrode was placed in the cathodic compartment. The catholyte was a 40% methanol aqueous solution with 0.25 M TMAC1 supporting electrolyte. The counter-electrode was a platinum plate with the dimension of 10 mm \u00d7 10 mm \u00d7 0.2 mm. Anodic compartment was filled with 1 M NaOH supporting electrolyte. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode. The electrolysis was performed at a constant current and 40 \u00b0C. A potentiostat (DJS-292, Shanghai Rex Instrument Co., China) was used as power source. 2.2.3 Analytical method PCP concentrations in solution and on the Pd/ACF electrode were measured at different intervals during electrolysis separately. Pd/ACF electrode was extracted with 25 mL mixture of acetone and dichloromethane (1:1, v/v) plus 0.2 mL 30% HC1 (shaking at 250 rpm for 4 h). The above procedure was repeated six times. The solvent fractions were combined and dried on a rotary evaporator (Shanghai Biochemistry Instrument Co., China). The resulted sample was dissolved in acetonitrile and analyzed by HPLC (PU-1580, UV-1575, Jasco, Japan) at 220 nm with a Kromasil ODS column (250 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm). The mobile phase was acetonitrile:water (0.1% acetic acid) = 3:2 (v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The volume of the injected sample was 20 \u03bcL. Identification of intermediates was carried out with an HP 6890 gas chromatography (GC) coupled with 5973N mass selective detector (MSD) with a capillary column (HP-5 MS, 30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm, Agilent, USA). The flow rate of carrier gas (He) was 1.0 mL/min. A solvent delay at 8 min, and full scan mode was used. The oven temperature was increased from 40 to 260 \u00b0C (hold for 20 min) at a rate of 15 \u00b0C/min. The injector temperature was 260 \u00b0C, and the ion source temperature was 230 \u00b0C. The MSD was operated with the electron impact (El) mode with the electron energy being 70 eV. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of ACF The structural parameters of ACF were calculated from the nitrogen isotherms. Surface area ( S BET ) was 1335.4 m 2 /g, micropore volume was 0.5857 cm 3 /g and average pore diameter was 2.13 nm. 3.2 Distribution of palladium on the ACF The SEM micrographs of the ACF and Pd (4.2 wt.%)/ACF are shown in Fig. 2 . The ACF ( Fig. 2 A) appeared as flat fibers without any visible pores. The uniformly dispersed Pd particles were seen on ACF ( Fig. 2 B). Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the Pd (4.2 wt.%)/ACF where peaks for Pd particles were observed [22] while, as expected, no Pd signal for the ACF. 3.3 Adsorption kinetics and isotherms of PCP on ACF and Pd/ACF The adsorption kinetics curves of PCP on ACF and Pd (4.2 wt.%)/ACF are plotted using 100 mL of 200 mg/L PCP solution in a series of 250 mL flasks under the conditions of 20 \u00b0C and 250 rpm. Experimental data was applied to the Lagergren rate equation [23] : (1) q t = q e ( 1 \u2212 e \u2212 k L t ) where q e and q t (both in mg/g) are the amounts of PCP adsorbed at equilibrium and at any given time t (h), respectively, and k L (h \u22121 ) is the Lagergren rate constant. Fig. 4 shows the adsorption kinetic curves of PCP on the ACF and Pd (4.2 wt.%)/ACF. The parameters were calculated by non-linear regression ( Table 1 ). From Fig. 4 and Table 1 , it could be seen that the load of 4.2% of Pd did not lead to significant changes in the adsorption rate. The adsorption isotherms of PCP on ACF and Pd (4.2 wt.%)/ACF at the temperature of 20 \u00b0C and pH 7.50 were measured according to the Mollah method [24] ( Fig. 5 ). The adsorption isotherms can be correlated well by the Freundlich model: (2) Q = k F C 1 / n where Q is adsorption capacity (mg/g), C the equilibrium concentration in solution (mg/L), n (dimensionless) the empirical parameter that represents the heterogeneity of the site energies and k F (mg/g) (L/mg) 1/ n the unit capacity factor. k F and n are indicators of adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity, respectively. Fig. 5 shows the adsorption capacity was slightly affected by the impregnation with Pd (4.2 wt.%), and Table 2 displays the corresponding parameters calculated for the adsorption isotherms. The results implied that ACF has an excellent adsorption capacity for PCP in solution; for example, a 1 mg/L PCP solution produces an equilibrium loading of about 174 mg PCP/g of Pd (4.2 wt.%)/ACF at 20 \u00b0C. Such high adsorption capacity is crucial considering the removal of PCP from the aqueous solution. 3.4 Electrocatalytic dechlorination of PCP on Pd/ACF at various current densities PCP was adsorbed on the Pd (4.2 wt.%)/ACF before electrolysis by mixing 100 mL PCP solution (200 mg/L, pH 7.50) in a 250 mL flask. The flask was sealed and placed in a thermostatic shaker (250 rpm, 20 \u00b0C) for 25 h. The degradation of PCP and yield of phenol were calculated by the Eqs. (3) and (4) : (3) degradation of PCP = m ads \u2212 ( m sol + m ACF ) m ads \u00d7 100 % where the m ads was the initial amount of PCP adsorbed on the Pd (4.2 wt.%)/ACF before electrolysis; m sol and m ACF were the amounts of PCP residue in the catholyte and on the Pd/ACF after electrolysis, respectively, (4) yield of phenol = M phenol M PCP \u00d7 100 % where the M PCP was the initial amount (in moles) of adsorbed PCP and M phenol were the amount of phenol in the catholyte and on the Pd/ACF after eletrolysis. The degradation of PCP and the yield of phenol from electrocatalytic dechlorination over the cathode of Pd (4.2 wt.%)/ACF at different current densities are presented in Fig. 6 . As seen from Fig. 6 , the higher current density, the higher degradation efficiency and yield of phenol. 94.8% of degradation was obtained after 200 min of electrolysis at 25 mA/cm 2 , while the value was 63.8% at 10 mA/cm 2 . And the yield of phenol was 86.1% at 25 mA/cm 2 being about two times of that at 10 mA/cm 2 . Table 3 shows that the current efficiency of complete dechlorination to phenol was significantly affected by the applied current density. The highest current density led to the lowest current efficiency. High current density need more negative potential to be applied. This fact may be related to the competition of side reactions, mainly hydrogen evolution, which was not favorable for the contact of PCP with the electrode [13] . These kinds of side reactions will result in lower efficiencies at higher current density and more negative potential. In present experiment, the production of H 2 at potential of \u22121.20 V was observed visually. The pH of solution increased gradually with the increase of current density, suggesting that the rate of water electrolysis increase with the current density. 3.5 Catalytic activity of the catalyst The Pd (4.2 wt.%)/ACF working electrode was used three times at the current density of 25 mA/cm 2 to test the catalytic activity. After each run, the used Pd/ACF was shaken at 250 rpm for 4 h in a mixture of acetone and dichloromethane (1:1, v/v) plus 0.2 mL 30% HCl. The above procedure was repeated six times to remove the adsorbed organic compounds. The analysis shows that no phenols were detected in the sixth extract. Fig. 7 A shows that the degradation efficiency decreased from 94.8 to 65.1% when the electrode was used three times. Fig. 7 B shows that the yield of phenol decreased from 86.1 to 37.3% after the electrode was used three times. The three times used Pd/ACF still had a much higher electrocatalytic activity than bare ACF considering that PCP degradation efficiency was only 36.5% and no phenol was detected with the bare ACF acting as working electrode. The results of this experiment indicate that the Pd plays an important role in the dechlorination of PCP. The SEM micrograph of used Pd/ACF is given in Fig. 8 , and there is no evident difference between the images of used and fresh Pd/ACF (Figs. 8 and 2 B). The results of ICP-AES analysis show that 10.5% of the initial amount of Pd leached from Pd/ACF after being used three times. The decrease of catalytic activity may be attributed to the loss of Pd or the inactivation of catalyst. 3.6 Identification of intermediate products by GC/MS The extracts from the Pd/ACF electrode and electrolyte solution were analyzed by GC/MS and main results are shown in Fig. 9 . After 40 min of electrolysis, five kinds of main dechlorination products were detected including tetrachlorophenols (TetraCP), trichlorophenols (TriCP), dichlorophenols (DiCP), chlorophenols (CPL) and phenol (PNL). After 200 min, only phenol and small amount of chlorophenols were detected. On the basis of the above results, the dechlorination pathways of PCP in Pd/ACF cathode are proposed as Fig. 10 . 4 Conclusions Pd/activated carbon fiber showed high adsorption capacity for PCP ( k F = 170.1 (mg/g) (L/mg) 1/6 , n = 6.00) and high dechlorination efficiencies of up to 94.8% with phenol as the main products (86.1% in yield). A further improvement in stability of the Pd/ACF is required.

The phenol elimination rate on the Si-doped BiVO(4) film electrode in the photoelectrocatalytic process was 1.84 times as great as that on the BiVO(4) film electrode.

After being spiked with p,p'-DDT, soil samples loaded with different doses of TiO2 (0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 3% wt) were exposed to UV-light irradiation for 24 h. The results indicated that the photodegradation of p,p'-DDT followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics. TiO2 accelerated the photodegradation of p,p'-DDT significantly as indicated by the half-life reduction from 23.3 h to 10.4 h, corresponding to the TiO2 content from 0% to 3% respectively. In addition, the effects of soil pH, photon flux and humic substances on p,p'-DDT degradation were investigated. The photodegradation rate increased with the increase of the soil pH and photon flux. The humic substances (2% wt) inhibited the p,p'-DDT photodegradation by reducing the amount of light available to excite the p,p'-DDT and TiO2 or by quenching radicals capable of oxidizing p,p'-DDT. p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD and DDMU were main degradation intermediates and they were further degraded in the presence of TiO2.",

The concentrations of petroleum in photolytic processes were analyzed by UV-Vis. GC-FID and FTIR were used for the characterization of petroleum hydrocarbons. Experimental results indicated that photochemical degradation of petroleum on soil surfaces followed pseudo first-order kinetics with the rate constant of 0.0026-0.0172 h-1 and half-life of 40-267 h. GC-FID analysis showed that, after 50 h of irradiation, the content of saturated hydrocarbons with longer chain decreased, while the proportion of shorter chain ones increased slightly; in addition, most chromatogram peaks of aromatics weakened or disappeared. After 60 h of photolysis, the appearance of carbonyl compounds in FTIR spectra of the extract from soil demonstrated that petroleum was gradually oxidized in the photolytic process.",

The effect of the synthesis method on the catalytic activity was investigated. XRD patterns revealed that both OMS-2 materials had the typical cryptomelane-type structure.

While hydrothermal reduction without sonolytic treatment, metal nanocrystal with a diameter of \u223c18 nm grows on graphene sheet. The size-selective growth of metal nanodots on graphene sheet arises from the higher diffusion barrier in metal ion doped graphene oxide (GO) system formed during sonolytic process and limited the size of growing metal nanodot.

        "title": "Characterization of boron-doped TiO2 nanotube arrays prepared by electrochemical method and its visible light activity",
        "abstract": "The boron-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays were fabricated by potentiostatic anodization of titanium in an aqueous electrolyte containing fluoride ion and sodium fluoroborate (NaBF 4 ). The highly ordered nanotube arrays with an inner pore diameter of approximately 80 nm and a length of 1.4 \u03bcm are obtained. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data indicate that the boron atoms are successfully incorporated into the TiO 2 matrix, forming Ti\u2013B\u2013O bond in the sample with small amount of boron (1.5 at.%), and the chemical environment surrounding boron is more similar to that in B 2 O 3 in the samples with larger amounts of boron (3.1 and 3.8 at.%). The B-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays with a mixture of anatase phase and very little rutile phase upon thermal annealing at 500 \u00b0C for 2 h were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Red shifts and enhanced absorption intensities in both UV and visible light regions are observed in the spectra of UV\u2013vis absorption of B-doped samples. The B-doped nanotube arrays show improved photochemical capability under both simulated sunlight and UV irradiation. By comparison, the sample with 3.1 at.% of boron exhibits the best photoelectrochemical properties, and its photocurrent densities under simulated sunlight and UV irradiation are approximately 1.17 and 1.27 times of those of TiO 2 nanotube arrays, respectively. The visible photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) activities of the prepared electrodes were evaluated using atrazine as a test substance under simulated sunlight irradiation. The kinetic constant of PEC degradation of atrazine using B-doped electrode with 3.1 at.% of boron is 53% higher than that using non-doped one. A synergetic effect of the photocatalytic (PC) and electrochemical (EC) processes is observed. Keywords Boron doping TiO 2 nanotube arrays Potentiostatic anodization Visible photoelectrochemical activity 1 Introduction One-dimensional nanostructures with nanotubular symmetries are proved to be very efficient as physical and chemical nanodevices due to their valuable high surface area structure, and offer great potential applications in the sensing, fuel cells and water photolysis [1] . Beginning with the discovery of carbon nanotubes [2] , the variety of interesting properties of the material has stimulated a series of approaches to synthesize nanotublar structures other than carbon. TiO 2 , one of the most promising photocatalyst, has attracted special attention due to its high photocatalytic (PC) activity, chemical stability, nontoxicity and relatively low price. Therefore, particular attempts are carried out to fabricate the vertically oriented TiO 2 nanotube arrays by electrochemical (EC) anodization in order to further improve its properties to meet the practical application requirements [3\u20135] . Compared with any other form of titania, the highly ordered nanotube arrays possess large internal surface area, and their unique architectural characterization and crystalline nature make them attractive electron percolation pathways for vectorial charge transfer between interfaces [6,7] , thus, convincing TiO 2 nanotube arrays be worthy of scientific consideration. Furthermore, the oxide tubes grow directly on the Ti sheet by the simple anodization method, which strengthens the adhesion of TiO 2 nanotube arrays to the substrate; in addition, the parameters, such as the pore size, the length and the wall thickness, can be precisely controlled by tailoring the EC conditions [8\u201310] . In recent years, TiO 2 nanotube arrays have been applied in water photoelectrolysis, photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) degradation of organic pollutants and used as photoelectrode in solar cell [11\u201313] . Titania dioxide has long been regarded as an attractive photocatalyst, however, it is photochemically active only under UV light irradiation; especially TiO 2 nanotube, its band gap is even wider than that of TiO 2 nanofilm [12] . Therefore, considerable efforts have focused on band-gap engineering of titania. One approach is to sensitize TiO 2 with suitable dyes [7,13] , while the dyes occur self-degradation under irradiation [14] , thus, limiting its practical applications. The other approach is to modify TiO 2 by elemental doping. It has been proved that anion-doped TiO 2 , such as nitrogen-, carbon-, or sulfur-doped TiO 2 , all exhibit visible photoresponse [15\u201317] . Currently, there are two major explanations for anion-doped effect that lead the absorption edge of TiO 2 to shift to the visible region. Asahi et al. [15] proposed that N-doping caused the narrowing of TiO 2 band gap, producing TiO 2\u2212 x N x with visible photoactivity. Carbon- and sulfur-doped TiO 2 displayed similar behavior under visible light irradiation. Some studies, however, proposed that the isolated band, which was introduced by anion dopant, formed above the O 2p valence band, causing two-step electronic transitions, that is, from valence band to localized states and then from localized states to the conduction band of TiO 2 [18,19] . While Serpone suggested that the red shift of the absorption edge was due to the formation of the color centers, not to a narrowing of the original band gap of TiO 2 through mixing of dopant and oxygen states [20] . Accordingly, it is a viable way to improve the visible response of TiO 2 by anionic doping, although the doping mechanism needs to be further studied. Based on the consideration of smaller radius of boron than that of nitrogen, it is logical for boron incorporating into TiO 2 matrix easily. The preparation of B-doped TiO 2 by sol\u2013gel method has been reported [21,22] , however, this method was only used for preparing B-doped TiO 2 in powder form and could not be suitable for fabrication of ordered TiO 2 nanotube arrays produced by anodization method. We have previously reported on boron incorporation by chemical vapor deposition on anodically formed TiO 2 nanotube arrays [23] and found it conceivable to prolong the absorption edge of TiO 2 nanotube arrays to visible region by boron doping, but it was a two-step fabrication approach and the preparation process was relatively complex. In this paper, we develop a one-step way to prepare B-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays by EC oxidation of Ti sheet in the electrolyte containing boron. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of different boron contents on the structure characteristics and the photoelectrochemical capabilities of B-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays. The PC oxidation efficiency can be enhanced by applying low bias potential across the photoanode and the PEC oxidation is becoming a welcome technology in wastewater treatment. Thus, the PEC activity of B-doped samples was also evaluated by PEC degradation of atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamine-6-isopropylamino- s -triazine), a widely used herbicide, under simulated sunlight irradiation. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of B-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays Titanium sheet (99% pure) with a thickness of 0.5 mm was anodized to produce TiO 2 nanotube arrays. NaBF 4 of different concentrations from 0.625 to 2.5 mM was added to the electrolytic solutions. The choice of this kind of compound was based on the considerations of its chemical property, that is, it could not affect anodization process; and of its chemical composition so as to restrain the electrolytic ions and control other possible elements, which might be incorporated into the anodic titania films. More details of anodic oxidation had been described previously [23] . To induce crystallinity, the initially amorphous as-anodized films were annealed at 500 \u00b0C for 2 h with heating and cooling rates of 2 \u00b0C min \u22121 . 2.2 Characterization Morphological characterization of the samples was carried out using environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM; Quanta 200 FEG). Direct cross-sectional image was taken from cracked layers after bending the samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using a diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (Shimadzu LabX XRD-6000) was used for determining the crystalline structure of the samples. The elemental composition of the samples was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; AMICUS). The UV\u2013vis spectra were recorded on a Jasco UV-550 spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere; BaSO 4 was used as a reference sample. 2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements The photocurrent density was measured using a CHI EC analyzer (CH Instruments 650B, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co. Ltd., China) in a standard three-electrode configuration with the prepared sample as the working electrode, a platinum foil as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode in 1 M KOH electrolyte. A 350-W high-pressure mercury lamp (Beijing Huiyixin Lighting Co., China), or a high-pressure xenon short arc lamp (CHF-XM35-500W, Beijing Changtuo Co., China) that was introduced as a spectra physics solar simulator, was applied as the radiation source. 2.4 Photoelectrocatalytic experiment The PEC oxidation of atrazine was carried out in a single photoelectrochemical compartment. The B-doped TiO 2 nanotube array photoanode, a platinum foil cathode and a SCE as the reference electrode were all connected to the CHI 650B EC analyzer. Bias potentials applied on photoanode were 0.6 V (vs. SCE) in the experiments. The spectra physics solar simulator with the illumination intensity of 80 mW cm \u22122 at the position of photoanode was placed in parallel with the photoreactor. All the experiments went on with continuous magnetic stirring, using 0.01 M sodium sulfate as the electrolyte. The initial concentration of atrazine aqueous solution was 10 mg L \u22121 . The determination of atrazine concentration was performed by HPLC (Waters 2695, Separations module) with a Sunfire\u2122 C 18 (5 \u03bcm) reverse-phase column at 30 \u00b0C equipped with photodiode array detector (Waters 2996). The mobile phase was 1.0 mL min \u22121 of methanol and water (v:v = 0.55:0.45) and the spectrum was chosen at the wavelength of 220 nm. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Morphology of B-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays Fig. 1 shows ESEM images of B-doped TiO 2 anodized in the electrolyte containing 1.25 mM NaBF 4 . Clearly, the structure consists of self-organized and ordered nanotubes with an inner diameter of approximately 80 nm, a wall thickness of approximately 15 nm and a length of approximately 1.4 \u03bcm. It is apparent that B-doped sample still keeps nanotubular structure with no significant morphology change, which is also found for the samples anodized in the electrolyte with lower (0.625 mM) and higher (2.5 mM) concentrations of NaBF 4 (figures not shown). 3.2 XPS analysis Fig. 2 shows the B 1s XPS spectra of B-doped samples with the NaBF 4 concentration in the anodization electrolyte ranging from 0.625 to 2.5 mM. The intensity of B 1s peak increases with the increase of NaBF 4 concentration and the amounts of boron are estimated as 1.5, 3.1 and 3.8 at.%, respectively, indicating that the amount of boron dopant is a linear function of boron addition when the NaBF 4 concentration is below 1.25 mM. Furthermore, the B 1s peaks gradually shift from 192.6 to 193.4 eV with the increase of boron amount, suggesting more of B\u2013O bonds on the surface of B-doped TiO 2 sample. Referring to the standard binding energies of B 1s in B 2 O 3 (193.1 eV, B\u2013O bond) and in TiB 2 (187.5 eV, Ti\u2013B bond), it is speculated that boron atom might probably be incorporated into the TiO 2 matrix, forming Ti\u2013B\u2013O bond in the sample with small amount of boron (1.5 at.%), while the chemical environment surrounding boron in the samples with larger amounts of boron (3.1 and 3.8 at.%) is more similar to that in B 2 O 3 . The Ti 2P 3/2 peaks of B-doped samples are observed at about 459.8 eV (figures not shown), shifting to larger energy in comparison with that of Ti 2P 3/2 in TiO 2 (459.0 eV), which implies that oxygen atoms in the lattice of TiO 2 might be partially substituted by boron atoms and a stable state is formed [21] . However, further investigation is needed to get the detailed information on the anodization involving BF 4 \u2212 to form B-doped TiO 2 . 3.3 Effect of boron on the crystallinity of TiO 2 nanotube arrays In order to examine the effect of boron dopant on the structure of TiO 2 nanotube arrays, XRD patterns for non- and B-doped samples are presented in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that the crystallized structures for doped samples mainly consist of anatase phase (corresponding to 2 \u03b8 = 25.4\u00b0) and little amount of rutile phase (corresponding to 2 \u03b8 = 27.5\u00b0) due to boron doping. The increase in the crystallite sizes calculated from the Scherrer equation of the doped samples might be attributed to the fractional phase transfer from anatase to rutile. It is known that the solid-phase transformation is a process of nucleation and growth [24] . At low temperature (500 \u00b0C in this work), the net transformation rate is limited by the rate of rutile nucleation [25] . By contrast with pure TiO 2 , the partial substitution of O atoms for B atoms causes a decrease of the TiO 2 content in B-doped TiO 2 samples and the amount of anatase particles also decreases to some extent; therefore, it is speculated that at the same annealing temperature, the small anatase particles of the doped samples tend to become bigger, and thus, the rutile nucleation might occur at the subset of anatase interfaces. For TiO 2 nanotubes, the rutile crystallites originate in the oxide layer underneath the nanotubes [11] and the phase transition from anatase to rutile during annealing is inhibited by nano-dimensional nanotube walls [26] . Therefore, it is suggested that the appearance of rutile phase is attributed to boron doping, while the unique nanostructure hampers its growth to some extent. On the other hand, the rutile peak of the sample with medium boron amount is sharper and more intensive, indicating that this sample could exhibit higher PC activity than the others under visible light. 3.4 UV\u2013vis absorption spectra The effects of boron doping on the light absorption characteristics of TiO 2 nanotube arrays are shown in Fig. 4 . The B-doped samples all exhibit red shifts in the band gap transition and the absorption edge in the spectrum of sample with 3.1 at.% of boron has the biggest red shift of approximately 30 nm, which might be attributed to the rutile phase existence, since rutile has a narrower band gap than anatase. The band gap energies estimated with Kubelka\u2013Munk function [27] of pure TiO 2 is about 3.33 eV, of B-doped TiO 2 (3.1 at.% of boron) is about 3.10 eV, and of the other two doped samples (1.5 and 3.8 at.% of boron) are both about 3.16 eV. In addition, the B-doped samples also exhibit stronger absorption in the UV\u2013vis range. The results of the absorption feature suggest that B-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays could be activated by visible light and might exhibit enhanced photoresponse under UV light as well. 3.5 Photoelectrochemical measurement The photocurrent densities as a function of applied potential of TiO 2 nanotube array and B-doped TiO 2 nanotube array electrodes, in a 1 M KOH electrolyte, under simulated sunlight irradiation (80 mW cm \u22122 ), are shown in Fig. 5 . The dark current is so low that can be negligible and the photocurrents are calculated from the measured currents subtracting the respective dark one. Clearly, the photocurrent densities of B-doped samples are higher than that of non-doped one, and the slope to the titania's photocurrent\u2013potential characteristic also increases, implying that under the same irradiation with the same bias potential, more photoexcited electrons on the B-doped TiO 2 electrode flow to the cathode, leaving more photoexcited holes involved in the oxidation reaction. The improved photoelectrochemical properties of B-doped TiO 2 nanotube array electrodes could be attributed to boron doping, which gives the direct evidence that the B-doped TiO 2 nanotube array electrodes prepared in this work can improve the visible photoresponse of TiO 2 nanotube arrays, and thus, may find its application in photoelectrochemical degradation of organics under sunlight irradiation. By comparison, the photocurrent density of the sample with 3.1 at.% of boron is the highest among the samples, which is approximately 1.17 times of that of TiO 2 nanotube arrays, and the photocurrent density of the sample with 3.8 at.% amount of boron is a little higher than that of the third-doped sample (1.5 at.% of boron). Therefore, 3.1 at.% is an optimal doping amount and the sample with such boron amount exhibits the best photoelectrochemical capability than the others under simulated sunlight irradiation. The photoelectrochemical behaviors of B-doped TiO 2 nanotube array samples under UV light irradiation (0.75 mW cm \u22122 ) are also investigated with results displayed in Fig. 6 . In accordance with the discoveries under simulated sunlight irradiation, increased photocurrent densities are observed due to boron doping, which causes the titania electrode more sensitive to UV light (see Fig. 4 ), and the photocurrent density of the sample with 3.1 at.% of boron is approximately 1.27 times of that of TiO 2 nanotube arrays. In addition, the photocurrent density increases with the increase of boron dopant till the boron amount reaches 3.1 at.%, and further increasing the boron-doping amount in the B-doped sample leads to a decrease of its photocurrent density. Therefore, 3.1 at.% is an optimal doping amount and the sample with such boron amount exhibits the best photoelectrochemical capability under UV light irradiation. 3.6 Photoelectrocatalytic degradation of atrazine Visible photoelectrochemical activity of B-doped TiO 2 nanotube array electrode is evaluated by PEC degradation of atrazine in an aqueous solution under simulated sunlight irradiation. As Fig. 7 shows, more atrazines are removed on B-doped electrode with 3.1 at.% of boron, and the atrazine removal increases by approximately 32% than on non-doped one. It is also found that atrazine removals on the other two B-doped electrodes (1.5 and 3.8 at.%) are higher than that on TiO 2 nanotube array electrode, but both are inferior to the one with 3.1 at.% of boron. The atrazine degradation follows pseudo-first kinetic equation, and the kinetic constants of atrazine photoelectrocatalysis are 1.08, 0.907, and 0.863 h \u22121 on the electrodes with 3.1, 3.8, and 1.5 at.% of boron, which are 53%, 29% and 23% higher than that on TiO 2 electrode (0.704 h \u22121 ), respectively (see Table 1 ). Obviously, the atrazine removal rates in PEC process on B-doped electrodes are all faster than that on TiO 2 electrode, proving the contribution of boron dopant in improving visible activity of TiO 2 . The sample with 3.1 at.% of boron exhibits the best activity, which is in good agreement with the results of photocurrent density test in Fig. 5 . With respect to photoelectrocatalysis, the function of the bias potential acts in promoting photogenerated charges as to increase the lifetime of electron\u2013hole pairs [28] . Fig. 8 shows the atrazine degradation on the electrode with 3.1 at.% of boron in four different processes, that is, EC, direct photolysis (DP), PC and PEC. It is anticipatory that almost no atrazine is removed in EC process, affirming that the bias potential of 0.6 V is too low to induce atrazine degradation. It is reasonable that atrazine removal efficiency in PC process is higher than in DP process, proving that B-doped TiO 2 nanotube array electrode can be excited under sunlight irradiation and partial photogenerated holes involve oxidation reaction before combination. Furthermore, more atrazine is removed on the B-doped electrode when a low bias potential (0.6 V vs. SCE) being applied to produce a PEC oxidation reaction. After irradiation, the degradation efficiencies of atrazine in EC, DP, PC and PEC processes are about 2.36%, 34.7%, 53.2% and 66.8%, respectively. The reaction kinetics is undergone by linear fit and corresponding kinetic constants in four processes on B-doped sample are shown in Table 2 . Clearly, there is a synergetic effect between the PC and EC processes. 4 Conclusions This work reports an EC method for producing B-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays. Boron atoms are successfully incorporated into the TiO 2 matrix during the process of anodization which occurrs in the electrolyte containing fluoride ion and NaBF 4 . The B-doped electrodes display a clear increase in their photocurrent densities, confirming that the boron doping would improve the photoelectrochemical capabilities of TiO 2 nanotube arrays. Furthermore, the B-doped sample with 3.1 at.% of boron exhibits the best photoelectrochemical and PEC performance under simulated sunlight irradiation. Accordingly, it is suggested the feasibility of EC method for fabricating B-doped TiO 2 nanotube arrays and such material would be promising in visible photoelectrocatalytic region. In summary, efforts have been made to investigate the unique properties of TiO 2 nanotube arrays, but the researches on their modification with anion elements for further utilization of solar energy are still limited. We believe it is necessary to investigate more solar energy related applications of B-doped TiO 2 nanotube array material. These will be the subjects of ongoing studies.

        "abstract": "In the past decades, catalyst stability and metal ions leaching have always been one of the most important issues in the heterogeneous peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation system. In this work, cobalt implanted TiO2 was proposed as an effective catalyst for improving the catalyst stability and inhibiting cobalt leaching. A simple hydrolysis method was employed for the preparation of nanocatalysts with Co(NO3)2\u00b76H 2O and Ti(OC3H7)4 as precursors. Characterization by X-ray diffractometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature programmed reduction indicated that the doped cobalt uniformly distributed in the faces of TiO2 crystallite as Co2+ and interacted with TiO2 through a strong Co-O-Ti bond. Compared to the Co3O4 immobilized TiO2 catalysts, the cobalt ion implanted TiO2 nanocatalysts reduced half of the cobalt dosage but exhibited paralleled catalytic activity and, moreover, the cobalt leaching declined about 60%. The reduction of cobalt dosage, uniform distribution of Co2+ in the TiO2 crystal lattice and the strong interaction of Co2+ with TiO2 support were believed to improve the performance in heterogeneous activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and decrease the cobalt leaching. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Graphene electrodes (Ti/Gr) were prepared by depositing Gr sheets on Ti substrate, followed by an annealing process for enhancing the adhesion strength. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopies and X-ray diffraction patterns displayed that the electrochemical behavior of Ti/Gr electrodes can be improved due to the generation of TiO2 layer at Ti-Gr interface during the annealing process. The palladized Gr electrodes (Ti/Gr/Pd) were prepared by electrochemical depositing Pd nanoparticles on Gr sheets. The debromination ability of Ti/Gr/Pd electrodes was investigated using BDE-47 as a target pollutant with various bias potentials. The results indicated that the BDE-47 degradation rates on Ti/Gr/Pd electrodes increased with the negative bias potentials from 0 V to -0.5 V (vs. SCE). Almost all of the BDE-47 was removed in the debromination reaction on the Ti/Gr/Pd electrode at -0.5 V for 3 h, and the main product was diphenyl ethers, meaning it is promising to debrominate completely using the Ti/Gr/Pd electrode. Although the debromination rate was slightly slower at -0.3 V than that under -0.5 V, the current efficiency at -0.3 V was higher, because the electrical current acted mostly on BDE-47 rather than on water. ? 2014 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

The kinetics, which followed the Lagergren adsorption rate law, exhibited a variety of responses depending on bias potential, initial concentration, and electrolyte. The electrosorption isotherms were in agreement with the classical models of Langmuir and Freundlich, but the former gave more satisfactory correlation coefficients. With electrosorption at a bias potential of 700 mV from the basic solution, a nearly 10-fold enhancement of maximum adsorption capacity was achievable. The electrosorption free energy (DeltaG(ads)), enthalpy (DeltaH(ads)), and entropy (DeltaS(ads)) of phenol on the ACFs were calculated from adsorption isotherms at different temperatures. The results indicated that electrosorption of phenol in basic solution was spontaneous and exothermic. Furthermore, it was assessed that electrosorption occurred by dipole-dipole interaction with DeltaH(ads) of -20.14 kJ mol(-1) besides suppositional electrostatic interaction.",

The soil in the three sites had greater sorption capacities for Pb(II) than Cu (II), which was affected strongly by the soil characteristics. In the binary metal solution containing 1:1 molar ratio of Pb(II) and Cu(II), the total amount of Pb(II) and Cu(II) adsorption was affected by the simultaneous presence of the two metal ions, indicating the existence of adsorption competition between the two metal ions.

        "abstract": "Excellent fouling resistance to various foulants is crucial to maintain the separation performance of membranes in providing potable water. Antimicrobial modification is effective for antibiofouling, but fails to mitigate organic fouling. Improving surface charges can improve the resistance to charged foulants, while the lack of antimicrobial ability results in bacterial aggregation. Herein, a silver nanoparticles modified carbon nanotubes (Ag-CNT)/ceramic membrane was prepared with enhanced antifouling and antimicrobial properties under electrochemical assistance. The presence of silver nanoparticles endows the composite membrane with antimicrobial ability by which inhibits biofilm formation. Its steady-state flux is 1.9 times higher than that for unmodified membrane in filtering bacteria suspension. Although the formation of organic fouling did weaken the biofouling resistance, the negatively charged bacteria and organic matter can be sufficiently repelled away from the cathodic membrane under electrochemical assistance. The flux loss under a low-voltage of 2.0 V reduced to <10% from >35% for membrane alone when bacteria and organic matter co-exist in feed water. More importantly, silver dissolution was significantly inhibited via an in-situ electro-reduction process, by which the Ag+ concentration in effluent (<1.0 \u03bcg/L) was about two orders of magnitude lower than that without voltage. The integration of antimicrobial modification and electrochemistry offers a new prospect in developing membranes with high fouling resistance for water treatment.",

The results of the transmittance spectra demonstrated that the light absorption by Au NPs was amplified after they were infiltrated into TiO 2 240, which was fabricated from 240 nm polystyrene spheres. In the photocatalytic experiments of 2,4-dichlorophenol degradation under visible light (> 420 nm) irradiation, the kinetic constant using TiO 2 240/Au NPs was 2.3 fold larger than that using TiO 2 nanocrystalline/Au NPs (TiO 2 NC/Au NPs). The excellent photocatalysis benefited from the cooperatively enhanced light harvesting owing to the localized surface plasmon resonance of Au NPs, which extended the light response spectra and the photonic effect of the TiO 2 240 which intensified the plasmonic absorption by Au NPs. The hydroxyl radicals originated from the electroreduction of dissolved oxygen with photogenerated electrons via chain reactions were the main reactive oxygen species responsible for the pollutant degradation. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Removal of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) from aqueous solution has attracted wide attention in light of their environmental persistence, bioaccumulation, and potential toxicity. Although various destructive technologies were developed, removal of PFOX (X = A and S) under mild conditions are still desirable. In this work, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were applied to remove PFOX in electrochemically assistant adsorption. Electrosorption kinetics and isotherms were investigated relative to open circuit (OC) adsorption and adsorption on powder MWNTs. Compared with powder MWNTs adsorption, the initial adsorption rate (\u03c5(0)) of 100 \u03bcg/L PFOX at 0.6 V increased 60-fold (PFOA) and 41-fold (PFOS) according to pseudosecond-order kinetics model and the maximum electrosorption capacity (q(m)) of PFOX (50 \u03bcg/L to 10 mg/L) increased 150-fold (PFOA) and 94-fold (PFOS) simulated with Langmuir model. These significant improvements were assumed to benefit from enhanced electrostatic attraction under electrochemical assistance. Furthermore, the used MWNTs were found to be regenerative and reusable. This work provides not only a new approach to effective removal of perfluorochemicals from aqueous solution but also a low energy-consumption and environmentally-friendly strategy for application of carbon nanotubes in water treatment.",

Three flow rates, 9.17, 19.87 and 40.66 m(3)m(-2)h(-1), were investigated for p-xylene inlet concentration ranging from 0.1 to 3.3 g m(-3). A high elimination capacity of 80 g m(-3)h(-1) corresponding to removal efficiency of 96% was obtained at a flow rate of 9.17 m(3)m(-2)h(-1) (empty bed residence time of 132 s). At a flow rate of 40.66 m(3)m(-2)h(-1) (empty bed residence time of 30s), the maximum elimination capacity for p-xylene was 40 g m(-3)h(-1) and removal efficiencies were in the range of 47-100%. The production of carbon dioxide (P(CO(2))) is proportional to elimination capacity (EC) and the linear relation was formulated as P(CO(2))=1.65EC+15.58. Stable pH values ranging from 6.3 to 7.6 and low pressure drop values less than 0.2 cm H(2)O (19.6 Pa) of packing media in compost-based biofilter of hybrid biofilter were observed, which avoided acidification and compaction of packing media and sustained the activity of microorganism populations.",

Oil is a strong sorbent for PFOS, together with the independence of oil-water distribution coefficient (K(oil)) on solution parameters (pH values and [Ca(2+)]), suggesting that hydrophobic interactions of the hydrophobic moieties of PFOS with oil played a dominant role. BC sorption for PFOS is not stronger or more nonlinear than other natural organic carbon from solution in the case of 0.5mM [Ca(2+)] and pH 5.05, indicating that specific adsorption sites on BC were probably not fit for PFOS. However, both sorption capacity and nonlinearity of PFOS increased obviously with decreasing solution pH and increasing [Ca(2+)], resulting in the potential importance of BC at environmentally low PFOS level, from solution at high [Ca(2+)] or low pH.

A novel strategy for enhancing anaerobic wastewater treatment via dosing Fe powder (40g) in an acidogenic reactor (2L) is described. The results showed that the hydrolysis/fermentation was accelerated by Fe dosing. As a result, the acidogenic performances in COD removal (45-56%) and VFA production (1170-1340mg/L) were less affected by shortened hydraulic retention time (HRT) from 6 to 2h. However, COD removal declined to 25% and VFA production decreased to 661mg/L in a reference reactor without Fe0 dosing (A2). Besides, Fe0 dosing optimized fermentation type, namely, the production of propionate was decreased, which was favorable for subsequent acetogenesis and methanogenesis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis indicated that Fe0 dosing increased the abundance of acidogens, especially acetogens. The methanogenic reactor fed with the effluent of A1 had higher COD removal and treatment stability with almost no propionate detected. These results suggested that the enhancement of acidification by Fe0 powder dosing was helpful to accelerate and improve anaerobic acidogenesis to create a favorable feeding condition for the subsequent treatment. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V..",

        "abstract": "A novel Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 composite electrode was fabricated for COD determination. The new electrode configuration improved the sensitivity of the amperometric method apparently. Effects of common experimental parameters, such as applied potential, pH and concentration of the electrolyte on its analytical performance were investigated. A linear range of 0.5\u2013200 mg L \u22121 COD and a detection limit (a signal-to-noise ratio of 3) of 0.3 mg L \u22121 were achieved under optimized conditions. The experiments for detecting COD in model samples and real samples were carried out to evaluate the electrode's performance. The obtained results were in good agreement with those determined by the standard dichromate method, with a relative error less than 12%. Keywords Chemical oxygen demand Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode Amperometric detection 1 Introduction Chemical oxygen demand (COD) is an important parameter for the evaluation of water quality [1] . The most common COD determination method is dichromate titration, which has been established as a standard method in many countries. This method involves time-consuming and tedious analytical procedure, consumes some toxic (Cr 6+ , Hg 2+ ) and expensive (Ag 2 SO 4 ) chemicals as well, which have drawn many attentions to shorten the analysis time [2,3] and reduce the consumption for toxic chemicals. However, the existing method and its modified methods are required to be conducted in a laboratory, where reflux digestion equipments (for example, the equipment used in regular chemical digestion, microwave-assisted digestion or ultrasound-assisted digestion) are available. This limitation makes these methods not suitable for onsite measurement, which is helpful for monitoring the water quality on time. To achieve COD onsite measurement, several new methods for COD determination have been developed including photocatalytic oxidation method [4\u20137] , photoelectrochemical method [8\u201314] , and electrochemical method [15\u201321] . Previous reports indicated the reproducibility and low dynamic range of COD value determined by photocatalytic oxidation method were influenced by the oxygen content in the tested water [13] , since these methods used oxygen molecules as electron acceptors to scavenge electrons leading to the decrease of dissolved oxygen in water and interference on COD determination. By introducing a potential bias to scavenge electrons, the photoelectrochemical method effectively overcame the shortcomings of photocatalytic oxidation method. Nevertheless, the utilizing of UV light and electronic field complexes the configuration of measurement device and increases the device cost. Due to its relative simple device and directness in the acquisition of analytical signal, electrochemical measurement was proposed as a suitable and competitive method for COD onsite measurement. In electrochemical detection process, organic compounds in testing water are oxidized by the hydroxyl radicals ( OH) produced on working electrode and generated electrical signals, which is proportional to COD values. Based on this detection mechanism, the key point for COD electrochemical detection is to fabricate or find an ideal and adoptable working electrode, which determines the quantity of OH generated under available condition. Several kinds of working electrodes have been developed for this purpose. Rossler-Fromme and Scholz [15] and Orozco et al. [16] fabricated composite electrodes consisting of graphite, AgO, and CuO, and reported their properties for COD determination. However, the available potential for those electrodes is not high enough to oxidize all the organic compounds. Yu et al. reported boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode with satisfied potential and its good performance for COD determination due to its wide electrochemical potential window [17,18] . Nevertheless, its fabrication process is complicated and requiring special instrument leading to high cost of BDD. Compared with these electrodes, PbO 2 electrode and modified PbO 2 electrode have significant price advantages with good performance for COD detection. The lowest detection limit was 2.5 mg L \u22121 with the response current 0.8 \u03bcA per mg L \u22121 COD for F-PbO 2 electrode or nano-PbO 2 on Pt wires electrode [19\u201321] , which still has an improvement space for COD determination in order to better comply the determination requirement for surface waters with low COD values. In this work, a novel Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 composite electrode was fabricated and its electrochemical sensing behaviors for COD determination were firstly investigated. The net steady-state electronic current originated from electrocatalytic oxidation of organic compounds was used as the analytical signal for COD determination. The analytical performance of the Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 composite electrode with a high potential of oxygen evolution was compared with the Ti/F-PbO 2 electrode, which showed that the new Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 composite electrode exhibited good performance for COD determination and its sensitivity was significantly improved. The effects of important parameters on the analytical signal were investigated systematically. Based on the optimized parameters, real sample analyses were also performed by the Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 composite electrode. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Glucose, sucrose, p -hydroxybenzoic acid, hydroquinone, p -nitrophenol, sodium fluoride, and tetracycline (analytical grade) were obtained from Tianjin Bodi Chemicals Co. Ltd. (Tianjing, China). Tin tetrachloride (SnCl 4 \u00b75H 2 O) and lead nitrate (Pb(NO 3 ) 2 ) were purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Sb 2 O 3 nano-particles with 30\u201350 nm diameter were obtained from Institute of Fangyuan Nano-material (Anhui University of Technology, China). Real samples were collected from reservoir, domestic sewage treatment plants and factories near the city of Dalian, stored in dark at 4 \u00b0C and analyzed within 48 h. All solutions were prepared by Milli-Q water (18 M\u03a9 cm). 2.2 Equipment All electrochemical measurements were carried out with a PARSTAT 2273 electrochemical system (Princeton applied research, USA). Morphologies of Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 composite electrodes were characterized by environmental scanning electron microscope (SEM, Quanta 200 FEG, the Netherlands). X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected by a diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (Shimadzu LabX XRD-6000, Japan). 2.3 Preparation of Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 and Ti/F-PbO 2 electrodes Ti plates (0.5 mm \u00d7 15 mm \u00d7 30 mm) were used as electrode substrates, which was firstly polished with 500-grit and 1500-grit sandpapers sequentially, then immersed into 40% NaOH solution at 80 \u00b0C for 2 h, and further etched with 20% oxalic acid at 96 \u00b0C for 6 h, afterwards they were washed with deionized water and acetone in turn for a few minutes. The fabrication of Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 composite electrode followed two steps. The first step was to achieve a Sb\u2013SnO 2 layer modified Ti electrode (Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 electrode) by electrodepositing Sb\u2013SnO 2 layer onto the Ti plate followed by thermal decomposition, as described in Ref. [22] . In brief, electrodeposition was carried out in a two-electrode system, which was employed with Ti plate as the working electrode, and a platinum plate as the counter electrode with a constant DC current of 60 mA between the two electrodes for 30 min. The electrolyte used in the electrodeposition consisted of 3.5 g SnCl 4 \u00b75H 2 O, 0.15 g Sb 2 O 3 nano-particles, and 0.4 mL HCl (37 wt.%) dissolved in 20 mL alcohol. Afterwards, the Ti plate calcined in an oven at 400 \u00b0C for 2 h was dipped into a precursor solution containing 6 g SnCl 4 \u00b75H 2 O, 0.16 g Sb 2 O 3 nano-particles, and 0.5 mL HCl (37 wt.%) dissolved in 10 mL n -butanol. The dipping\u2013calcining procedure was repeated up to 5 times at room temperature, and then the electrode was annealed in an oven at 550 \u00b0C for 2 h. The whole first step described above was repeated five times to obtain an Sb\u2013SnO 2 layer modified Ti electrode (Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 electrode). The second step was implemented in a common three-electrode system by electrodeposition using the Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 electrode as the working electrode, a platinum plate as the counter electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode to achieve the final Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 composite electrode. During the second electrodeposition, 2.6\u20133.0 V potential ( vs. Ag/AgCl) was applied for 0.5\u20132.0 min under gently stirring. The electrolyte consisted of 125 mM HClO 4 , 20 mM Pb(NO 3 ) 2 and 20 mM NaF. The temperature during the second step was maintained at 80 \u00b0C. A Ti/F-PbO 2 electrode was prepared according to the methods presented by Cong and Wu [23] and used as a control electrode to compare its performance with that of the new Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 composite electrode for COD determination. The process for Ti/F-PbO 2 electrode fabrication was illustrated briefly as following. After the pretreatment mentioned above, the Ti plate was immersed into the precursor solution containing Pb(Ac) 2 , NH 4 -Ac, and (NH 4 ) 2 S 2 O 8 for 1 min and calcined at 500 \u00b0C for 1 h, with the whole process repeated up to 5 times. Afterwards, it was used as the working electrode to be electrodeposited forming a Ti/F-PbO 2 electrode in a common three-electrode system with a platinum plate as the counter electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was a mixture of 500 mM Pb(NO 3 ) 2 , 200 mM HNO 3 and 25 mM NaF. During the electrodeposition, a potential of 2.6 V vs. a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode was applied for 2 min, and hydrogen peroxide was added into the electrolyte to eliminate the formation of NO 2 \u2212 . 2.4 COD measurement procedure COD measurements were performed in a conventional three-electrode system with a Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode as working electrode (effect area was 200 mm 2 ), a platinum plate and a saturated Ag/AgCl as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The measuring and signal quantification procedures are as follows: a steady blank current ( i blank ) of the Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode in 18 mL 25 mM Na 2 SO 4 supporting electrolyte solution was recorded when the potential vs. the reference electrode was applied. 2 mL model sample solution or real sample solution was mixed with the Na 2 SO 4 supporting electrolyte solution to obtain a steady total current ( i total ). The difference between i blank and i total was achieved and defined as i net . After each COD measurement, a potential of 3 V vs. the reference electrode was applied for 30 s to clean the working electrode completely. During each measurement and cleaning, the solution was stirred gently by a magnetic stirrer. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Measuring principle and signal quantification According to the electrocatalytic reaction mechanism, the organic compounds are oxidized on the surface of the Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode, where hydroxyl radicals ( OH) are generated by the discharge reaction. With the powerful oxidizing properties of OH, organic pollutants are oxidized indiscriminately, gradually forming dehydrogenated or hydroxylated derivatives, and finally being decomposed to carbon dioxide and water [24,25] , as described in formula (1) . (1) M( OH) + R \u2192 M + CO 2 + H 2 O + H + + e \u2212 where M( OH) represents hydroxyl radicals produced on the Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode; R is organic pollutants. During this process, the electrochemical charge originated from this reaction would simultaneously generate a proportional signal current, which could be used to quantify the concentration of organics in a sample (formula (2) ): (2) i n e t = n k A F Z c c R where n is the number of electrons attending the oxidization reaction, k is reaction constant of (1) , Z c is the stoichiometry factor for the complete combustion of organic pollutants, A , F , and c R are area of the electrode, Faraday constant, and the molar concentration of organic pollutants, respectively. According to the definition of COD, c R can be converted to COD/8000 n. Herein, i net can be represented as: (3) i n e t = k A F [ COD ] 8000 From formula (3) , it is obvious that i net is proportional to COD of organic pollutants. Besides, in our determination method, i net was obtained by subtracting i blank from i total . i blank and i total were the current produced on the Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode before and after the addition of samples into the electrolyte solution. 3.2 Characterization of the electrodes The surface morphology of the electrodes before and after PbO 2 electrodeposition was characterized by SEM and XRD, shown in Figs. 1 and 2 . The morphology of Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 electrode exhibits a typical mud-crack structure ( Fig. 1 a), which is a typical characteristic of other oxide electrodes fabricated by a thermal decomposition method [26,27] , because of the thermal expansion coefficient differences between Ti substrate and the Sb\u2013SnO 2 layer. It is shown in Fig. 1 b that after the electrodeposition of PbO 2 , the Sb\u2013SnO 2 layer including the cracks on its surface is completely covered by PbO 2 particles diameter of 200\u2013500 nm ( Fig. 1 b), which can greatly increase the surface area of the composite electrode and the density of adsorption sites. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 electrode and Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode. In comparison of these two XRD patterns, the crystallographic characteristics of PbO 2 at 2 \u03b8 = 25.3, 35.9 and 48.8 are clearly identified, which suggests that the existence of PbO 2 on the surface of Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode. The other intense peaks at 2 \u03b8 = 26.4, 33.7 and 51.6 correspond to SnO 2 , which are slightly different with those of pure SnO 2 due to the coexistence of Sb [28] . In addition, the same peaks in the two XRD diagrams ( Fig. 2 a and b) at 2 \u03b8 = 38.2, 39.9 and 70.4 belong to Ti substrate. All the evidence illustrate the formation of Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode. 3.3 Response of Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode to glucose Fig. 3 shows a set of typical i net -time profiles of Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 , Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 and Ti/F-PbO 2 electrodes with the successive addition of glucose (10 mg L \u22121 COD). After the addition of glucose, the oxidative currents immediately increase and reach 95% or 98% of the steady state within 10 s for Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 and Ti/F-PbO 2 , respectively. While, although the current response of Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 electrode also performs well to the successive addition of glucose, as proved by the electrochemical degradation of phenols [21] , the sensitivity to the organics is not high enough to be used as COD determination sensor. Compared to the Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 electrode, it is apparent that the larger i net of Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 and Ti/F-PbO 2 are attributed to the high catalytic performance and large surface area of the nano-PbO 2 on Ti sheet. Moreover, it is worth noting that the i blank of the Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode was much lower than that of Ti/F-PbO 2 electrodes, which is benefit to distinguishing minor i net from i total , suggesting it is more sensitive on COD determination. Hence, this suggested that the Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 composite electrode is more favorable for COD determination compared to Ti/F-PbO 2 electrode. 3.4 Optimization of the measuring conditions 3.4.1 Applied potential To obtain an appropriate potential for COD measurement, a series of amperometric response to the addition of 10 mg L \u22121 COD glucose were investigated at different potentials. The results ( Fig. 4 ) show that i net increases gradually with the potential increasing from 1.3 V to 1.55 V. While further increasing of potential to 1.60 V leads to the obvious decrease of i net . On the other hand, i blank almost keeps a constant value with the potential ranging from 1.30 V to 1.40 V. However, once the potential exceeds 1.50 V, i blank increases rapidly caused by the evolution of oxygen on the composite electrode. In addition, although i net achieves the largest value at 1.55 V, the current stability and reproducibility of the Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 composite electrode drop down (data not shown). Consequently, 1.40 V is chosen as the applied potential in further investigation. 3.4.2 pH and concentration of electrolyte solution Because the solution pH can affect both the production of OH on the electrode surface and the chemical forms of organic compounds in the solution, these pH dependent factors may affect the analytical signal. The effects of pH, ranging from 2 to 11, on both the i net and i blank were investigated and shown in Fig. 5 . It is apparent that both the i net and i blank increase with the increasing of pH, but the increasing rates are different. At the beginning, i net increases rapidly within the pH range of 2\u20133. Then it increases slightly as the pH value increases from 3 to 9. This phenomenon is consistent with that basic solution is favorable for OH generation. On the other hand, the increasing of pH leads to the lower over potential for oxygen evolution as well. Herein, when pH value of the solution is over 10, oxygen evolution gradually becomes the main reaction compared to the oxidization reaction of organic pollutants, leading to a rapid increase of i blank . Thus, the suitable pH range for the COD determination is 3\u20139. The electric conductivity of solution is another influencing factor in most electrochemical reaction. As the electric conductivity of solution is associated with the concentration of supporting electrolyte, we investigated the effects of different concentrations of Na 2 SO 4 solution (10\u201360 mM) as supporting electrolyte on i net and i blank . The results show little change in i net within this Na 2 SO 4 concentration range, while i blank increases slightly due to the increase of the conductivity. Accordingly, the medium low concentration of the electrolyte, 25 mM, was selected in the following experiments. 3.5 COD electrochemical determination based on the Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode Fig. 6 shows the relationships between i net , measured at 1.4 V in 25 mM Na 2 SO 4 , and the theoretical COD values of the six kinds of model sample solution, which is calculated based on the concentration of the organic compound postulated to be oxidized completely. The six kinds of samples are glucose, sucrose, nitrophenol, hydroquinone, p -hydroxybenzoic acid and tetracycline solution, which are common organic compounds in water representing carbohydrate, phenols, carboxylic acid, and antibiotics, respectively. i net increased linearly with the increase of theoretical COD values ( Fig. 6 ) with almost the same slope for the six investigated samples, demonstrating that the relationship between i net and COD values is independent on the type of organic species. The linear range for COD determination is 0.5\u2013200 mg L \u22121 and the detection limit is estimated to be 0.3 mg L \u22121 (a signal-to-noise ratio of 3), which is lower than those of F-PbO 2 electrode or nano-PbO 2 on Pt wires electrode [19\u201321] . Moreover, the reproducibility of COD determination based on the Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode is satisfied with relative standard deviations of interior-day and inter-day less than 5.0% and 10%, respectively. 3.6 Analysis of real samples To investigate the feasibility of the Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode for COD determination of real samples, several real water samples from reservoir, municipal sewage plants, and factories were analyzed. The pH values of the samples were in the range of 5\u20139, which is within the proper pH range for COD determination. The COD values determined by the conventional method (dichromate method) were used as control values. All the samples with high COD values were diluted to a proper concentration before analyzed by the proposed electrochemical method or dichromate titration method. The comparison of COD values performed by the Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode with the COD values determined by the conventional method is listed in Table 1 , which shows that the values obtained by the two methods are consistent, with relative errors less than 12%, illustrating the good performance of Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode on COD determination. 3.7 Interference of chloride ion Considering chloride ion is an ordinary reductive ion in water, and it is one of the major factors influencing COD measurement by dichromate titration method [29] , the effects of chloride ion concentration on the COD determination by Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode were investigated (shown in Fig. 7 ). The concentration range of Cl \u2212 selected in this experiment was from 10 to 200 mg L \u22121 , covering the normal Cl \u2212 concentration level in domestic water (30\u2013100 mg L \u22121 ). It is worth noting that the concentration of Cl \u2212 plays a positive role on the i net producing on the Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode, leading to measurement errors ( Fig. 7 ). Furthermore, the corresponding ratio of i net to [Cl \u2212 ] ( i net /[Cl \u2212 ]) rises with the increasing of Cl \u2212 concentration. For example, i net /[Cl \u2212 ] is 0.024 \u03bcA as the concentration of Cl \u2212 is 10 mg L \u22121 , and it rises to 0.078 \u03bcA with the concentration of Cl \u2212 up to 100 mg L \u22121 . Therefore, dilution before COD determination is necessary for the samples with large amounts of Cl \u2212 and high COD value, in order to prevent the measurement errors caused by Cl \u2212 interference. As for a sample with large amounts of Cl \u2212 but low COD value, precipitation of Cl \u2212 by the addition of Ag + before COD determination is a feasible and optional method. 4 Conclusion In this study, a novel Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 composite electrode with good analytical performance was fabricated for COD amperometric determination. Under the optimized conditions, an excellent correlation between i net and COD value ( i net = 2.059COD + 0.3762, R 2 = 0.9910) and a low detection limit (0.3 mg L \u22121 ) were achieved, which were comparable to or better than those of previously reported F-PbO 2 electrode or nano-PbO 2 electrode. Ti/Sb\u2013SnO 2 /PbO 2 electrode would be extremely attractive in the field of COD electrochemical determination for surface water or other clean waters with low COD values.

        "abstract": "Pentachlorophenol (PCP) vertical transportation in soil column during its phototransformation on the soil surface was investigated\n using a new designed photoreactor. Three kinds of soils were used to study the effect of soil water and soil properties. In\n air-dried sandy loam, no obvious PCP transportation occurred in the soil profile when PCP was phototransformed on the soil\n surface. And the average removal of PCP in the whole soil column was close to zero after 48\u00a0h irradiation. In the moist sandy\n loam, PCP in the deeper soil could transport to the soil surface with water evaporation and then be transformed during UV\n irradiation, thus the average PCP removal in the whole soil column was improved. When the initial water contents are 9.3 and\n 19.2%, the average PCP removal in the sandy loam after 48\u00a0h irradiation accounted to 20.9 and 39.9%, respectively. The improving\n of PCP removal induced by soil water was limited in the clay and silt soils where PCP transportation was impeded because of\n their higher adsorption capacity. In the silt soil where the initial water content was 19.7%, not only PCP transportation\n in the deeper soil but also PCP phototransformation on the surface was inhibited seriously because of the high organic matter\n content of 18%.",

        "abstract": "The photochemical formation of Fe(II) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2) coupled with humic acids (HA) was studied to understand the significance of iron cycling in the photodegradation of atrazine under simulated sunlight. The presence of HA significantly enhanced the formation of Fe(II) and H 2O 2, and their subsequent product, hydroxyl radical ( (*)OH), was the main oxidant responsible for the atrazine photodegradation. During 60 h of irradiation, the fraction of iron presented as Fe(II) (Fe(II)/Fe(t)) decreased from 20-32% in the presence of the Fe(III)-HA complex to 10-22% after adding atrazine. The rate of atrazine photodegradation in solutions containing Fe(III) increased with increasing HA concentration, suggesting that the complexation of Fe(III) with HA accelerated the Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycling. Using fluorescence spectrometry, the quenching constant and the percentage of fluorophores participating in the complexation of HA with Fe(III) were estimated by the modified Stern-Volmer equation. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) offered the direct evidence that Fe(III)-carboxylate complex could be formed by ligand exchange of HA with Fe(III). Based on all the information, a possible reaction mechanism was proposed.",

The pseudo-first-order rate constant of 2,4-D photodegradation with the presence of F(mip-b) was 2.5 times as high as that in solution containing effluent fraction (F(eff)).

The photodegradation of lindane on the surfaces of these sediments was investigated to observe the effects of Fe2O3 and other photoinducable substances, such as TiO2 and organic substances, on photodegradation of lindane. A partial least-squares (PLS) analysis model was developed to find out the statistical relationship between the photodegradation and the contents of these photoinducable substances. It was concluded from the PLS analysis that inorganic carbon and organic carbon have negative effects, whereas Fe2O3 and TiO2 accelerate the photodegradation of lindane in the sediment samples when 365 nm UV light was used as light source. In all cases of the experiments, the photodegradation of lindane in the sediment samples were fitted for pseudo-first-order kinetics.",

The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses revealed that the introduced silicon might be incorporated into titania matrix. This incorporation helped to increase the thermal stability of titania, which was in favor of suppressing phase transformation from anatase to rutile and also inhibiting the growth of anatase crystallite at high calcination temperature. A significant blue-shift with enhanced absorption intensities was observed in the spectrum of UV absorption for Si-doped sample. The Si-doped sample with 5 mol % of silicon exhibited the best photoelectrochemical property, and its photocurrent density under UV light was 1.7 times that of TiO2 nanofilm. The photocatalytic (PC) and electro-assisted photocatalytic (EAPC) activities were investigated using phenol as a probe substance. Compared with TiO2 nanofilm, the Si-doped TiO2 showed better PC and EAPC capabilities in the degradation of phenol under UV-light irradiation. The kinetic constants of phenol degradation for the 5 mol%-Si-doped TiO2 in PC and EAPC processes under UV-light irradiation were 1.3 and 1.8 times as great as the values for the undoped TiO2 nanofilm. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The samples were also characterized by X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity of these film; towards photodegradation of pentachlorophenol pollutant was examined and their efficiency was compared to those of the different TiO2 films. It has been shown that the film photocatalysts can efficiently decompose the pollutant. The photoelectrocatalytic degradation of PCP showed important variation that decreases in the order: ZnO/TiO2 > TiO2 > Fe 2O3/ZnO/TiO2 > Fe2O 3/TiO2.

        "abstract": "Environmental context Chlorinated organic compounds are ubiquitous in the environment, and cause concern owing to their persistence and toxicity to organisms. In addition to anthropogenic sources, photochemical processes in saline waters could also yield chlorinated organic compounds. The present paper investigates the effects of iron, pH, nitrate and dissolved organic matter on the photochlorination of bisphenol A, a widely distributed endocrine disrupting chemical. Abstract Effects of several key influencing factors of environmental photochemistry, including iron, nitrate and dissolved organic matter (DOM), on the photochlorination of bisphenol A (BPA) were investigated. Iron promoted the formation of chlorinated BPA, but the rate decreased with increasing pH. This result was consistent with the results of laser flash photolysis, which showed that high pH decreased the formation of reactive chlorine species (chlorine radical, Cl2 \u2022). Nitrate ion and citric acid, which was selected as an analogue of DOM, inhibited the chlorination of BPA separately. The results presented in this paper are helpful to get some idea of the degree of photochemical chlorination in aqueous environment. \u00a9 CSIRO 2010.",

        "abstract": "The adsorption of activated carbon fibers (ACFs) and their surface characteristics were investigated before and after electrochemical polarization. The adsorption kinetics of m -cresol showed the dependence on polarized potential, and the adsorption rate constant increased by 77.1%, from 6.38 \u00d7 10 \u22123 min \u22121 at open-circuit (OC) to 1.13 \u00d7 10 \u22122 min \u22121 at polarization of 600 mV. The adsorption isotherms at different potentials were in good agreement with Langmuir isotherm model, and the maximum adsorption capacity increased from 2.28 mmol g \u22121 at OC to 3.67 mmol g \u22121 at polarized potential of 600 mV. These indicated that electrochemical polarization could effectively improve the adsorption rate and capacity of ACFs. The surface characteristics of ACFs before and after electrochemical polarization were evaluated by N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms, scanning electron microscope (SEM), zeta potential and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results showed that the BET specific surface area and pore size increased as the potential rose. However, the surface chemical properties of ACFs hardly changed under electrochemical polarization of less than 600 mV. This study was beneficial to understand the mechanism of electrochemically enhanced adsorption. Keywords Electrosorption Adsorption kinetics Adsorption isotherms Activated carbon fibers Surface properties 1 Introduction Electrochemistry is widely used in wastewater treatment because of its environmentally friendly advantage. Electrochemical treatment technologies include electro-oxidation [1\u20133] , electro-reduction [4\u20138] and electrosorption [9\u201315] . Electro-oxidation and reduction are Faraday processes containing charge transfer through the phase boundary. However, electrosorption, which is generally defined as potential polarization-induced adsorption on the surface of electrodes, is a non-Faraday process. After the polarization of the electrodes, the polar molecules or ions can be removed from the electrolyte solution by the imposed electric field and adsorbed onto the surface of the electrodes. Because of its low energy consumption and environmentally friendly advantage, electrosorption has attracted a wide interest in the adsorption processes for the treatment of wastewater and the purification of supplying water. The investigations suggest that electrosorption can effectively enhance the adsorption of metal ions. The electrosorption processes of ions are mature, and the corresponding industrial products have been developed. However, the electrosorption for organic substances is a new technology. Some researchers [16\u201321] are exploring the feasibility of electrosorption for organic substances. Plaisance et al. [16] found that the 34% enhancement of adsorption capacity for benzene by electrochemical polarization was achievable. Niu and Conway [21] reported that the polarization of C-electrodes could enhance the adsorption rate of pyridinium ion, 1,4-pyrazine and 1-quinoline in the wastewater. These investigations indicate that electrochemical polarization can enhance adsorption rate and efficiency of organic substances on C-electrodes. The capacity and rate of adsorption for porous materials depend on many factors, such as the nature of pore structure and the surface polarity [13] . It is well known that the surface area and pore size distribution of adsorbents play an important role during the adsorption processes. Besides the surface chemical properties and the interaction affinity between adsorbates and adsorbents, the surface area and the pore size distribution may be also affected by electrochemical polarization. Therefore, to understand the mechanism of the enhancement for the adsorption rate and capacity of activated carbon fibers (ACFs), the investigation of physical and chemical properties of adsorbents after electrochemical polarization is important. However, to the best of our knowledge, the investigation of characteristics for activated carbon after electrochemical polarization has not been found. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of electrochemical polarization on the adsorption rate and capacity of ACFs. And the physiochemical properties of ACFs, such as BET surface area, pore size distribution, the surface morphologies, zeta potential and surface functional groups, were analyzed to better understand the mechanism of electrosorption. We selected m -cresol as target substance, which is one kind of noxious organic pollutants that is present in some industrial wastewaters and needs to be removed, to study its electrosorption rate and capacity on ACFs electrode. 2 Experimental 2.1 Pretreatment of ACFs The commercial polyacrylonitrile-based ACFs cloth (obtained from Anshan Activated Carbon Fiber Company, China) were first heated in boiling 5% NaOH for 1 h, which may avoid the desorption of trace organic compounds during the adsorption procedure. And then the ACFs seethed in 5% HCl for 1 h after a batch of deionization elution procedures was applied, which remove fines and inorganic ions that may dissolve during the adsorption measurements. At last, the ACFs treated by the above procedures was heated in boiling deionized water for 1 h, immersed overnight in the deionized water and washed to neutral. Then the washed ACFs was dried at 105 \u00b0C for 24 h [22] , and kept in a desiccator for use. 2.2 Characterization of ACFs The BET surface area and pore size distribution of ACFs before and after electrochemical polarization in the solution of 0.01 mol L \u22121 Na 2 SO 4 were carried out with an automated gas sorption system, using N 2 as the adsorbate at 77 K. Before the experiment, the ACFs were heated at 100 \u00b0C and outgassed to a vacuum of around 10 \u22125 Torr. The pore size was calculated using the BJH model in the range 2.0\u2013100 nm. The surface morphologies of ACFs before and after electrochemical polarization were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-5600LV, Oxford, UK) with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The zero-potentials were measured by a Zetameter (Zetaplus V3.52, Japan). Six solutions of 50 mg L \u22121 of each ACFs ground after different polarization were prepared in bottles with CO 2 -free bi-distilled water with 1 mmol L \u22121 KCl. The pH value was adjusted between 2 and 12 by adding HCl and NaOH. The bottles were sealed, dispersed uniformly by ultrasonic treatment for 24 h and left to stabilize for 24 h before the measurements. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis was performed after grinding the carbon samples and mixing with KBr power to prepare sample-KBr pellets. The infrared spectra of ACFs were recorded at room temperature in the range between 400 and 4000 cm \u22121 using a Fourier transform spectrophotometer (IR Prestige-21, Shimadzu, Japan). Pellets thickness was kept constant by fixing the sample-in-KBr weight (180 \u00b1 0.2 mg), using the same die diameter, being palletized under the same pressure and time. The ACFs contained in the pellets was 0.1 wt%. 2.3 Instrumentation and adsorption cell A conventional three-dimensional electrode system was adopted in the adsorption/elecrosorption investigation in both open-circuit (OC) and electrochemical polarization experiments. The experimental apparatus was in detail described in our previous work [23] . All experiments were performed with a CH Instruments Model 800A electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Corporation, China) for supplying bias potential, which was connected with a personal computer that was used to control the experimental parameters. The working electrode was a piece of ACFs (weight 30.0 \u00b1 0.5 mg) connected by platinum wire, which was fixed by plexiglas with four big holes. Saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was selected as the reference electrode, and the distance between SCE and the working electrode was about 2.5 mm. The auxiliary electrode, a piece of platinum plate (25 mm \u00d7 25 mm) attached to another platinum wire, served as a current collector. And the distance between the working electrode and counter electrode was 45 mm. 2.4 Adsorption/electrosorption kinetics The adsorption/electrosorption kinetics experiments were carried out in the aqueous solution of 100 mL with 2 mmol L \u22121 m -cresol ( ) and 0.01 mol L \u22121 Na 2 SO 4 . The 1 mL solution was withdrawn at a given time intervals, diluted to 10 mL with deionized water and the concentration was measured by UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (JASCO V-550, Japan) at 271 nm. The adsorption rate constants of m -cresol were determined with the Lagergren [24] Eq. (1) , which is the first-order adsorption kinetics equation: (1) log ( q e \u2212 q ) = log \u2061 q e \u2212 k ads t 2.303 where k ads (min \u22121 ) is the adsorption rate constant, q e and q (mmol g \u22121 ) are the amounts of m -cresol adsorbed at equilibrium and time t (min), respectively. 2.5 Adsorption/electrosorption isotherms Isotherm experiments for m -cresol at different bias potentials, corresponding to adsorption/electrosorption kinetics, were carried out with fixed amount of ACFs (30.0 \u00b1 0.5 mg). The amount of adsorbed m -cresol was calculated from the following equation: (2) q e = ( C 0 \u2212 C ) V m where C 0 and C are the concentration at the beginning and the equilibrium adsorption state, respectively. V is the volume of solution and m is the mass of ACFs. Isotherms in all experimental cases were fitted to two classical empirical models of Langmuir [25] and Freundlich [26] . (3) q e = Q L b L C e 1 + b L C e (4) q e = k F C e 1 / n where Q L is the maximum saturation adsorption capacity, b L the Langmuir constant, K F and n are the Freundlich constants. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The determination of electrosorption potential window for m-cresol In order to ensure that the m -cresol was not oxidized or reduced during the electrosorption process, the electrosorptive bias potential must be controlled. The cyclic voltammetries of solution without and with m -cresol were measured by electrochemical workstation at anodic polarization, respectively, and the results are shown in Fig. 1 . Steady increases and decreases observed in current with electric potential in both solutions indicate that no oxidation or reduction occurs in the range between 0 and 600 mV. Therefore, the electrosorption was carried out in this potential range to prevent m -cresol from being reduced or oxidized. 3.2 Adsorption/electrosorption kinetics To investigate the effect of electrochemical polarization on the adsorption rate which is necessary for the accurate design and model of adsorption processes, four experiments on adsorption/electrosorption kinetics were carried out with the initial m -cresol concentration of about 2 mmol L \u22121 , the ACFs weight of 30 mg, at room temperature, but at different bias potentials (OC, 200, 400 and 600 mV). The adsorption rate constants were determined using Lagergren adsorption kinetics equation and were found to be 6.38 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , 8.56 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , 1.14 \u00d7 10 \u22122 and 1.13 \u00d7 10 \u22122 min \u22121 at the polarization of OC, 200, 400 and 600 mV, respectively. The results (shown in Fig. 2 ) show that the adsorption rate constants and capacity are improved with increasing the bias potential of electrochemical polarization, indicating that electrochemical polarization can effectively enhance the adsorption rate and capacity of m -cresol on ACFs. The pH almost remained constant during the course of all experiments, suggesting that water splitting didn\u2019t happen. According to the results of cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical degradation of m -cresol was unable to happen when bias potential supplied was below 600 mV. This implies that the enhancement of adsorption rate and capacity for m -cresol at bias potentials supplied is not due to direct electrochemical degradation or secondary reactions caused by active oxidizing free radicals, such as free hydroxyl radicals produced by electrochemical water splitting, but may mainly be due to the affinity between the surface of ACFs and m -cresol, enhanced by the polarization under electric field. 3.3 Adsorption/electrosorption isotherms The adsorption capacity of adsorbents is a very important parameter in the practical process design. Therefore, the adsorption isotherms at different bias potentials, OC, 200, 400 and 600 mV, corresponding to the polarization potentials for kinetics above-mentioned, were investigated at 25 \u00b0C for 22 h. Fig. 3 shows the experimental equilibrium data and corresponding ones fitted with the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The results show that the adsorption capacity of m -cresol enhances with increasing polarization potential, indicating that the adsorption capacity of ACFs can be effectively improved by electrochemical polarization. The parameters for two isotherms were evaluated by least squares method based on an optimization algorithm and shown in Table 1 along with the average absolute percentage deviation, % D , which is determined as follows: (5) % D = 1 N \u2211 i = 1 N q exp \u2212 q pred q exp \u00d7 100 % where N is the number of experimental data points, q pred (mmol g \u22121 ) the predicted amount of m -cresol adsorbed with the isotherm model and q exp (mmol g \u22121 ) is the experimental amount of m -cresol adsorbed. The experimental data is in good agreement with Langmuir with small percentage deviations and high correlation coefficient, suggesting that the adsorption of m -cresol at polarization is monolayer. And the b L increases as the potential supplied rose from OC to 600 mV, showing that the affinity force can be effectively enhanced by electrochemical polarization. The maximum adsorption capacity increases by 61.0%, from 2.28 mmol g \u22121 at OC to 3.67 mmol g \u22121 at 600 mV. 3.4 The characterization of ACFs before and after electrochemical polarization In order to understand the mechanism of electrosorption for m -cresol on ACFs, the surface characteristics of ACFs before and after electrochemical polarization were evaluated in this paper. The electrosorption was mainly monolayer that was mostly dependent on the BET surface area and the pore size distribution of adsorbent. Hence, the surface area and pore size distribution of ACFs before and after electrochemical polarization were investigated by N 2 adsorption. And the morphologies, zeta potential and surface functional groups were also investigated. 3.4.1 The BET surface area and pore size distribution The adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms of N 2 on the ACFs were shown in Fig. 4 . Based on their shape, the adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms of ACFs before and after electrochemical polarization are type I according to the BDDT classification [27] . All of the isotherms have two characteristic regions; one below the relative pressure ( P / P 0 < 0.2), where a rapid increase of adsorption uptake is observed with increasing P / P 0 . This indicates that the ACFs contain a large number of micropores. The appearance of hysteresis loops in the N 2 isotherms of all the ACFs indicates the existence of some mesoporosity [28] . The hysteresis loops, whose area were 45.0, 46.9, 49.7 and 53.2, corresponding to the initial, 200, 400 and 600 mV polarized ACFs, increase slightly with increasing polarized potential. This suggests that the mesoporosity is enhanced slightly, which is also indicated by the later average pores. The BET surface areas of ACFs are 1335, 1384, 1479 and 1561 m 2 g \u22121 , corresponding to the initial, 200, 400 and 600 mV polarized ACFs, indicating that the electrochemical polarization can improve the BET surface areas. Only the inelastic deformation of surface, which was caused by electrostatic repulsion and the expanded action of the adsorption enhanced under electrochemical polarization for water and adsorbates, can be measured by this measured method applied. It is well known that the specific surface area is an important factor affecting the monolayer adsorption capacity, which the higher BET surface area causes the higher adsorption capacity. The pore size distributions of ACFs calculated using BJH method were shown in Fig. 5 in the range 2\u2013100 nm. It seems that the pores in the mesopore range, which are defined as pores of width between 2 and 50 nm, increase with the increasing potential in the experimental potential range. The mesopores contribution to the BET surface area of ACFs is usually smaller compared with micropores. However, they play an important role in the adsorption of organics [29] . Similar to the specific surface area measurement, only the inelastic deformation of pore size caused by electrochemical polarization can be measured by this measured method applied. The enhancement of adsorption capacity for m -cresol may mainly be due to the improvement of BET surface areas and average pore sizes besides the affinity between the surface of ACFs and m -cresol, enhanced by the polarization under electric field. 3.4.2 The surface morphologies The surface morphologies of ACFs before and after polarization were characterized by SEM and shown in Fig. 6 . In order to distinguish the morphologies of ACFs at different polarized potentials, the micrographs at the polarized potentials of 800 and 1000 mV were also shown. When the polarized potential is less than 600 mV, there is no evident difference in the surface of ACFs. When the polarized potential is over 800 mV, some pits are formed on the surface, indicating that the surface is electro-oxidized. Active oxidizing free radicals probably develop on the surface, which may oxidize the adsorbate during the electrosorption. Therefore, controlling the polarized potentials in the range between 0 and 600 mV is reasonable for the electrosorption of m -cresol. 3.4.3 The zeta potential The zeta potential can represent a characteristic and practical value for the prevailing functional groups containing oxygen on the surface of ACFs [30] . By means of zeta potential measurements, valuable information can be obtained on the change that occurs on the surface of ACFs after electrochemical polarization. Fig. 7 shows the zeta potential of the ACFs before and after electrochemical polarization in the presence of 1 mmol L \u22121 KCl solution as a function of the pH value. With increasing pH value of the solution, the excess of negative charges on the surface of the ACFs increases. The isoelectric points (IEP, it is the pH at which the zeta potential is zero) of as received ACFs and the ACFs after polarizing at 200, 400 and 600 mV, are almost identical for the pH value of 6.1. However, the IEP is 5.0 in case of the polarization of 800 mV. This indicates that the surface functional groups are not affected by the electrochemical polarization in the range between 0 and 600 mV. There are more acidic functional groups [30] on the surface of ACFs after polarization of 800 mV, which may be resulted in by electrochemical oxidation. This is consistent with the results of SEM micrographs. 3.4.4 FTIR It is generally accepted that electrochemical polarization can change the surface oxygen-containing functional groups of ACFs. In order to investigate the change of surface functional groups, FTIR is used to qualitatively identify the functional groups of ACFs. The surface functional groups of the original and electrochemically polarized ACFs were evaluated by FTIR and the spectra are shown in Fig. 8 . The results show that when the polarization potentials are less than 600 mV, there is no evident difference between original and polarized ACFs. However, new (3150, 1300\u20131000 cm \u22121 ) and higher relative intensities bands (1400 cm \u22121 ) occur in the FTIR spectra for the ACFs at polarized potential of 800 mV. In spite of the fact that the measurement procedure applied here makes quantitative comparison of the FTIR spectra impossible, the presence and relative intensities of the respective bands indicate that some changes have occurred in the surface chemical structure of ACFs. The new band at around 3150 cm \u22121 is present, which may be assigned to the stretching vibration of O H\u22efO formed on the surface [31,32] . The band in the region of 1400 cm \u22121 , which was intensified after the polarization of 800 mV, can be ascribed to carboxyl-carbonate structures [33] . The broad absorption within the range 1300\u20131000 cm \u22121 can be assigned to various C O bonds, such as those in ethers, phenols and hydroxyl groups [34] . Therefore, the surface of ACFs is probably oxidized at the polarization of 800 mV, but not at 600 mV, which is consistent with the results of SEM and zeta potential. 4 Conclusions In a summary, the electrochemical polarization can effectively enhance the adsorption rate and capacity of ACFs for m -cresol. In all experimental cases, the adsorption kinetics is fitted to the first-order adsorption kinetics. The adsorption isotherms obtained for m -cresol at different potentials follow Langmuir isotherm model. And the maximum adsorption capacity increases by 61.0%, from 2.28 mmol g \u22121 at OC to 3.67 mmol g \u22121 at 600 mV. The ACFs before and after polarization were characterized by BET, SEM, zeta potential and FTIR. The BET results show that the surface area and average pore size increase with increasing the polarized potential. The results of the other characteristics suggest that the surface of ACFs is not oxidized when the potential applied is less than 600 mV. Therefore, the enhancement of surface area and pore size for ACFs probably plays an important role during the electrochemically enhanced adsorption process, being beneficial to understand the enhanced adsorption mechanism.

        "title": "Enhanced oxidation of 4-chlorophenol using sulfate radicals generated from zero-valent iron and peroxydisulfate at ambient temperature",
        "abstract": "An efficient advanced oxidation process, which is based on the zero-valent iron (ZVI)-mediated decomposition of peroxydisulfate (PDS) that results in the generation of very strong oxidizing species (sulfate radicals) in aqueous solution, is reported. Experiments were conducted in the dark using ZVI loading ranging from 0.05 to 0.40 g L \u22121 in the presence of PDS. The results showed that ZVI significantly improved the degradation efficiencies of 4-chlorophenol at ambient temperature. The optimum loading of ZVI was 0.20 g L \u22121 and 88% removal of 4-chlorophenol was observed in 1 h of reaction time. The addition of methanol and tert-butyl alcohol as hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical scavengers proved the presence of sulfate radicals in the ZVI-PDS reaction system. The degradation of 4-chlorophenol was accompanied by the formation of hydroquinone, 1,4-benzoquinone, and small molecule compounds such as oxalic acid and succinic acid. Therefore, hydroquinone pathway was regarded as the main step in the oxidation of 4-chlorophenol. Chloride ion release and formation of oxidation intermediates were evidence of 4-chlorophenol degradation involving sulfate radicals. Keywords Sulfate radical anion Peroxydisulfate Advanced oxidation process Zero-valent iron 4-Chlorophenol 1 Introduction In the past few decades, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) such as O 3 , UV/H 2 O 2 , UV/O 3 , Fe 2+ /H 2 O 2 and UV/O 3 /H 2 O 2 had emerged as promising technologies for the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants [1\u20133] . All these processes which produced hydroxyl radicals as the primary oxidant assisted in environmental remediation. Hydroxyl radicals whose redox potential is 2.8 V vs. NHE are highly reactive species. More recently, the application of AOPs based on sulfate radicals in the field of wastewater treatment has been the subject of recent interest because sulfate radical anion, SO 4 \u2212 ( E 0 = 2.5\u20133.1 V vs. NHE) possesses higher oxidation potential than hydroxyl radical. Several studies had been carried out by the use of sulfate radicals for the degradation of a variety of chemical contaminants, such as azo-dyes, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), and chlorinated contaminants [4\u20137] . These studies demonstrated that sulfate radicals are stronger oxidants than hydroxyl radicals, especially at elevated pH. Furthermore, the high reactivity of sulfate radicals could remain in the range of pH 3\u20138. Manoj et al. [8] also reported that cyanuric acid, an end product of the hydroxyl radical-induced degradation of atrazine, could be decomposed in aqueous medium using sulfate radical anion. The sulfate radicals could be produced from peroxydisulfate (PDS) or peroxymonosulfate via thermal, photochemical, radiolytic, or redox decomposition (Reactions (1)\u2013(4) ). Although the reaction of sulfate radicals with organic substrates had received considerable attention, most studies had focused on the cobalt-mediated decomposition of peroxymonosulfate [9\u201311] . Experimental evidence suggested that Co(II) was the best catalyst for the decomposition of peroxomonosulfate and Ag(I) was the most efficient catalyst for the decomposition of peroxydisulfate [12,13] . However, there are significant drawbacks regarding the use of Co(II) and Ag(I) for environmental applications. The use of heavy metal, cobalt, may adversely affect human health and the quality of the environmental systems [14] . Therefore, for water treatment, it is interesting to develop environmentally benign methods with respect to environmental and economic considerations. (1) S 2 O 8 2 \u2212 + heat \u2192 2 S O 4 \u2212 (2) S 2 O 8 2 \u2212 + h \u03bd \u2192 2 S O 4 \u2212 (3) S 2 O 8 2 \u2212 + e \u2212 \u2192 S O 4 \u2212 + S O 4 2 \u2212 (4) S 2 O 8 2 \u2212 + M n + \u2192 S O 4 \u2212 + S O 4 2 \u2212 + M ( n + 1 ) + Iron has been widely used in water treatment processes because it is relatively inexpensive, nontoxic and effective. Most studies on metal iron were mainly focused on the reductive transformation of halogenated organic compound under the anaerobic condition [15,16] . Previous investigations on the metal iron activation of peroxydisulfate or peroxymonosulfate were limited to Fe(II) or Fe(III) as the catalyst. Rastogi et al. [17] reported sulfate radicals generated from activation of peroxymonosulfate with Fe(II) for PCBs degradation in aqueous and sediment systems. Fe(II)-activated PDS system had been used in wastewater treatment, especially for in situ chemical oxidation using sulfate radicals [18,19] . However, there existed critical barriers to the practical application of Fe(II): the reaction was performed under acidic conditions, and the efficiency was too low. Evidence for the latter was that some of the sulfate radicals produced reacted with excess Fe(II) thereby lowering the concentration of sulfate radicals that were available to degrade contaminants in the system (Reactions (5) and (6) ). (5) S 2 O 8 2 \u2212 + F e 2 + \u2192 S O 4 \u2212 + S O 4 2 \u2212 + F e 3 + (6) S O 4 \u2212 + F e 2 + \u2192 S O 4 2 \u2212 + F e 3 + These factors are undesirable in the application, and a neutral or slightly acidic pH would be preferred. The use of zero-valent iron (ZVI) would not only overcome the disadvantages of Fe(II) but also has the advantages of avoiding the addition of other anions to the treated system. Bergendahl and Thies illustrated the effectiveness of using ZVI as the iron source in Fenton's oxidation for treating MTBE-contaminated water [20] . Bermner et al. also reported the degradation of phenol with hydroxyl radicals generated from zero-valent iron and hydrogen peroxide [21] . To the best of our knowledge, only few researchers have worked on the oxidation of contaminants by the combination of ZVI and PDS at room temperature. Liang and Lai [22] reported trichloroethylene degradation using zero-valent iron and peroxydisulfate, and their work focused on the peroxydisulfate decomposition and the surface morphology of zero-valent iron in the In-Situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO) treatment. Moreover, Oh et al. [23] also investigated the oxidation of polyvinyl alcohol by peroxydisulfate activated with heat, Fe 2+ , and zero-valent iron. Complete oxidation of polyvinyl alcohol was obtained by ZVI-activated peroxydisulfate in 2 h. However, the reaction mechanism of sulfate radicals involved in the ZVI-PDS system at near neutral pH is still lacking, and the degradation pathway of contaminants using sulfate radicals needs further investigation. 4-Chlorophenol was chosen as the target compound because it is present in many chemical industry wastewaters from pulp and paper, dyestuff, pharmaceutical and petrochemical. The major objective of this study was to explore the mechanism and pathway of chlorophenol degradation by the combination of ZVI and PDS under near neutral pH conditions. In this study, ZVI loading, solution pH, the reaction mechanism, and the products of 4-chlorophenol degradation were also evaluated. From the environmentally-friendly point of view, the combination of ZVI and PDS for wastewater treatment provides a promising alternative as a new technology for contaminants elimination. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Sodium peroxydisulfate (Na 2 S 2 O 8 , 98% purity) was purchased from Kemiou Chemical Reagent Company (Tianjin, China). Iron powder (Fe 0 , 98% purity) was purchased from Shenyang Reagent Company (China). 4-Chlorophenol (99% purity), 1,4-benzoquinone (99% purity), and hydroquinone (98% purity) were obtained from Feixiang Chemical Company (Shanghai, China). All Chemicals were used as received. 2.2 Experimental procedure All experiments were performed at room temperature (20 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C) in a 250 mL glass vessel using a total volume of 200 mL under constant stirring with a magnetic stir bar. The vessel was wrapped with the tinfoil in order to avoid any photochemical effects. Prior to the addition of PDS, the suspensions were stirred for 30 min to obtain uniform mixture. Samples of 1 mL taken at different reaction times were mixed with the same volume of methanol to quench the reaction, and the remaining 4-chlorophenol in the solution was analyzed. The initial concentration of 4-chlorophenol was 0.156 mM (20 mg L \u22121 ). All batch tests were carried out in duplicate at least to ensure the reproducibility of experimental results. The solutions were prepared in deionized water. Stock solutions of 4-chlorophenol were made in aqueous solution and stored in the dark at 4 \u00b0C. Sodium peroxydisulfate solutions were prepared no more than 7 days before use in the experiments. 2.3 Analytical methods The concentrations of 4-chlorophenol, hydroquinone, and 1,4-benzoquinone were measured by HPLC (Waters 2695) equipped with a SunFire\u2122 C 18 column (150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5.0 \u03bcm) and photodiode array detector (Waters 2996). 4-Chlorophenol, hydroquinone, and 1,4-benzoquinone were detected with their corresponding peaks at 280 nm, 290 nm, and 245 nm, respectively. Mixtures of methanol (55%) and water (45%) were used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min \u22121 . For the identification of 4-chlorophenol and its degradation intermediates, liquid samples after silylation were analyzed with a gas chromatography (HP GC-6890) equipped with a mass selective detector (MSD-5973) and a capillary column HP-5 (30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm) (Agilent, USA). The carrier gas was He at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min \u22121 . A solvent delayed at 4 min, and full scan mode was used. The injector temperature was set to 240 \u00b0C, and the column temperature was ramped at 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 from 60 \u00b0C to 210 \u00b0C where it was held for 5 min. The mass spectrometry was operated at the electron impact mode. Concentrations of chloride and sulfate ions were analyzed with an IC (HIC-VP Super Shimadzu, Japan) coupled with a Shim-pack IC-A3 non-suppressor column (4.6 mm \u00d7 150 mm) and a CDD-10A vp conductivity detector. An eluent solution, containing 8 mM p -hydroxybenzoic acid, 1.6 mM Bis-Tris, and 25 mM boric acid, was pumped at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min \u22121 . The solution was measured by PB-20 pH meter (Sartorious, Germany). Ferrous ion was measured colorimetrically with 1,10-phenanthroline at a wavelength of 510 nm using a 721 spectrophotometer (Shanghai Xinmao Instrument Co., Ltd., China). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 ZVI-mediated activation of PDS for 4-chlorophenol degradation Experiments were conducted to determine the effect of ZVI amount on the removal efficiency of 4-chlorophenol by changing ZVI loading while keeping PDS constant of 0.78 mM and 4-chlorophenol concentration of 0.156 mM. The amounts of ZVI applied were 0.02, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.40 g L \u22121 and the particle size of ZVI was 10 \u03bcm. As shown in Fig. 1 , the degradation of 4-chlorophenol followed pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to ZVI at all iron loadings used in 1 h of reaction time. The initial rate constants increased with the increase of ZVI loading from 0.02 to 0.20 g L \u22121 . However, the degradation rate of 4-chlorophenol decreased when the ZVI loading was further increased to 0.40 g L \u22121 . The degradation rates of 4-chlorophenol in the solution followed this order 0.20 g L \u22121 > 0.40 g L \u22121 > 0.10 g L \u22121 > 0.02 g L \u22121 with k values of 2.16, 1.20, 0.96, and 0.12 h \u22121 , respectively. The optimum amount of ZVI was observed in this study for achieving the highest degradation efficiencies of 4-chlorophenol. When the loading of ZVI was around 0.20 g L \u22121 , 88% removal of 4-chlorophenol was observed within 1 h. The interesting results would be discussed in the following section. This study showed that the addition of ZVI was highly effective in degrading 4-chlorophenol in aqueous solution. PDS alone did not induce any significant transformation of 4-chlorophenol in the absence of ZVI during 1 h of reaction time because sodium peroxydisulfate is relatively stable at or below ambient temperature (25 \u00b0C). In the presence of ZVI alone, no significant degradation of 4-chlorophenol was observed. Joo et al. [24] reported that in the presence of oxygen, benzoic acid could also be oxidized by hydroxyl radical and other oxidants generated during the corrosion process of ZVI. In this study, the oxidation of 4-chlorophenol due to ZVI corrosion could be neglected. 3.2 Trend of iron species change in the ZVI-PDS system To further confirm the role of ZVI in the ZVI-PDS system, we investigated the concentration of ferrous ion in aqueous solution at near neutral pH 6.0. Fig. 2 shows the trend of ferrous ion in the different loadings of ZVI in the ZVI-PDS system. The loading of ZVI was in the range of 0.02\u20130.40 g L \u22121 , and the concentrations of ferrous ion increased with increasing amount of ZVI. There are two hypothesized possibility for the generation of ferrous ion in the ZVI-PDS system: one is due to the direct electron transfer from ZVI to PDS in a Haber\u2013Weiss like mechanism during Fenton-like reaction. The other is due to the corrosion of the metal iron under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions through the following reaction: (7) 2 F e 0 + O 2 + 2 H 2 O \u2192 2 F e 2 + + 4 O H \u2212 (8) F e 0 + 2 H 2 O \u2192 F e 2 + + 2 O H \u2212 + H 2 Iron is a strong electron donor ( E 0 (Fe 2+ /Fe 0 ) = \u22120.447 V vs. NHE), and it is possible that it can induce reductive decomposition of PDS. Moreover, because PDS ( E 0 = 2.01 V vs. NHE) by itself is an oxidant, which tends to abstract electron to form sulfate radical, the presence of PDS promotes ZVI dissolution (Reaction (9) ), similar to aqueous oxygen. Although the reaction of ZVI and PDS was thermodynamically favorable, it was a slow process at near neutral pH 6.0. (9) S 2 O 8 2 \u2212 + F e 0 \u2192 2 S O 4 2 \u2212 + F e 2 + (10) 2 F e 3 + + F e 0 \u2192 3 F e 2 + Zero-valent iron has been previously studied as a precursor of Fe(II) in acid media in Fenton reactions. However, in this study, the experiment was performed in near neutral pH medium. The initial product of ZVI corrosion is Fe(II) in accordance with Reactions (7) and (8) . Moreover, the multivalent oxidation states of iron may enhance the electron transfer, causing high catalytic reactivity. The recycling of ferric iron at the iron surface through Reaction (10) is fast compared to the homogeneous Fenton process. When the amount of ZVI was 0.40 mg L \u22121 , the most amount of ferrous ion was formed, however, the degradation of 4-chlorophenol decreased. This can be explained that either scavenging of SO 4 \u2212 radicals in the presence of excess Fe(II) (Reaction (6) ) or the rapid conversion of all Fe(II) to Fe(III); thus limiting the ultimate oxidizing capability of the system. Although the mechanism of these reactions was not well elucidated, it appears that, generally, a two-electron transfer occurs directly at the iron surface, oxidizing ZVI to Fe(II) ions. These investigations showed that ZVI was the source of Fe(II), which activated PDS in the ZVI-PDS system. Once PDS was activated, sulfate radicals formed might initiate a series of radical chain reactions involving other radicals and oxidants, where organic compounds were usually degraded. Therefore, in the presence of PDS, ZVI is a good Fe(II) provider for the activation of PDS to sulfate radicals which degrade 4-chlorophenol. The degradation of 4-chlorophenol initiated by Fe(II)-PDS and Fe(III)-PDS was also examined. Compared with the homogeneous Fe(II)-PDS and Fe(III)-PDS, the heterogeneous system, ZVI-PDS was very efficient in the degradation of 4-chlorophenol at near neutral pH 6.0. The removal of 4-chlorophenol in the Fe(II)-PDS and Fe(III)-PDS system was only 31% and 17%, respectively in 4 h while 88% was obtained in the ZVI-PDS system in 1 h ( Fig. 3 ). As expected, when ZVI instead of Fe(II) was used, ZVI could gradually release Fe(II) into the aqueous solution and the removal efficiency of 4-chloropenol was enhanced in the process. In agreement with Liang, sequential addition of Fe(II) in small increments resulted in an increased TCE removal efficiency [25] . Therefore, ferrous ions released from ZVI participated in Fenton-like reactions. 3.3 Oxidative mechanism in the ZVI-PDS system It is thoroughly established in the literature that alcohols containing alpha hydrogen, such as methanol and ethanol, readily react with hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals. Therefore, methanol (MeOH) is widely used as the scavenger of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals. Moreover, alcohols with no alpha hydrogen such as tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) are effective quenching agents for hydroxyl radicals. We investigated the effects of MeOH and TBA on the degradation of 4-chlorophenol in order to evaluate the reaction mechanism and the species that played role in the ZVI-PDS system. About 88% of 4-chlorophenol was removed in the absence of alcohol additive. However, a 76% and 47% drop in the degradation efficiency was observed in the presence of MeOH and TBA, respectively ( Fig. 4 ). The results showed that the reaction was completely quenched by adding MeOH as OH radical and SO 4 \u2212 radical scavengers, while the addition of TBA only moderately influenced the degradation rate of 4-chlorophenol. According to the literature report, the rate constants for reactions of MeOH with hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals are 8.0\u201310 \u00d7 10 8 M \u22121 s \u22121 and 0.9\u20131.3 \u00d7 10 7 M \u22121 s \u22121 , respectively. Although TBA is effective quenching agent for hydroxyl radicals ( k = 3.8\u20137.6 \u00d7 10 8 M \u22121 s \u22121 ), it reacts much slower with sulfate radicals ( k = 4.0\u20139.1 \u00d7 10 5 M \u22121 s \u22121 ) than with hydroxyl radicals [26,27] . The phenomenon in the presence of MeOH provided evidence for the involvement of hydroxyl radical or sulfate radical mechanism in the ZVI-PDS system. Furthermore, because TBA is also a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals, the degradation of 4-chlorophenol in the presence of TBA should be primarily ascribed to the formation of sulfate radical anion generated from Reaction (5) . In Reaction (11) , hydroxyl radical would be formed, but this reaction is slow at near neutral pH ( k < 3 \u00d7 10 3 s \u22121 ) [26] . Therefore, we believe that sulfate radical anion as the dominant active species is responsible for the oxidation of 4-chlorophenol in the ZVI-PDS system. (11) S O 4 \u2212 + H 2 O \u2192 HS O 4 \u2212 + OH 3.4 Effect of pH The pH value of the solution is an important factor that affects the decomposition of target compounds in the ZVI system [28] . In order to observe the effect of pH on the degradation of 4-chlorophenol, experiments were carried out at pH 3.0 and 6.0. Initially, the pH of the solution was 6.0 without pH adjustment. In the other solution, the pH was previously adjusted to 3.0 using 0.1 M H 2 SO 4 . From the experimental data in Fig. 5 , we can observed that the removal of 4-chlorophneol was only 12% in the presence of ZVI alone at pH 3.0, and the removal of 4-chlorophenol with ZVI-PDS was 86% and 80% at pH 3.0 and 6.0, respectively. At pH 3.0, the addition of ZVI alone could degrade 4-chlorophenol, yet it demanded longer time than ZVI coupled with PDS. At pH 6.0, the degradation efficiency of 4-chlorophenol was 80%, similar to the removal at pH 3.0. This result suggests that lowering solution pH slightly improves the degradation rate of 4-chlorophenol as it causes fast disappearance of ZVI, and hence the enrichment of Fe(II). Huang et al. reported that the oxidation of MTBE in groundwater by peroxydisulfate was inhibited by carbonate ions reacted as sulfate radical scavengers [29] . Hence, in this study, the experiment was performed without buffers or ionic strength compensation to avoid potential complications due to reaction between these additives and sulfate radicals. Taking into account the practical application of the system, the optimum pH for the highest degradation efficiency of 4-chlorophenol by the ZVI-PDS system was at near neutral value 6.0. 3.5 Identification of the reaction products and mechanism As shown in Fig. 6 , the degradation of 4-chlorophenol was observed and also accompanied by the formation of Cl \u2212 and SO 4 2\u2212 ions as the main inorganic products in aqueous solution. The increase of chloride ion in the solution was detected for 2 h of reaction time, implying that the chlorine on the aromatic ring was first removed. This result was easily understood because the carbon\u2013chloride bond energy was considerably weaker than the carbon\u2013oxygen bond energy. The mass balance calculation of chloride concentrations demonstrated that chlorine on the aromatic ring of 4-chlorophenol was almost removed. Moreover, the formation of SO 4 2\u2212 resulted from decomposition of PDS showed that the reaction took place in the ZVI-PDS system. Identification of reaction products was critical in proposing the reaction pathways and mechanisms. In order to detect the intermediates of 4-chlorophenol in the ZVI-PDS system, we increased the initial concentration of 4-chlorophenol to be 40 mg L \u22121 . Significant formation of partial oxidation products was detected during the degradation of 4-chlorophenol. Fig. 7 shows that the formation of intermediates such as 1,4-benzoquinone and hydroquinone were observed during the oxidation of 4-chlorophenol in the ZVI-PDS system. The degradation of 4-chlorophenol was extremely fast in the first 1 h, and then was gradually slow in the following 2 h. In the degradation of 4-CP with initial pH of 6.0, a decrease in pH was observed. This could be explained by the formation of reaction products such as HCl and organic acids. On the other hand, in the ZVI/PDS system, peroxydisulfate decomposition results in bisulfate (HSO 4 \u2212 ) byproduct formation (p K a = 1.92), and therefore usually causes a pH decrease [22] . GC\u2013MS analysis also revealed the formation of small organic acid such as succinic acid and oxalic acid. The results are in good agreement with those of previous reports that the majority of the products formed by sulfate radical attack on aromatics are hydroxylation products, which are also intermediates of hydroxyl radical attack [9] . Previous reports have shown that there are two degradation pathways in the photocatalytic degradation of 4-chlorophenol: substitution to form hydroquinone and hydroxylation to form 4-chlorocatechol [30,31] . Hirvonen et al. [32] also reported that products similar to the ones detected in this study were observed during oxidation of chlorinated phenols in aqueous solution. Because hydroquinone as well as its oxidation product 1,4-benzoquinone were detected throughout the reaction in the ZVI-PDS system, hydroquinone pathway was regarded as the first step in the oxidation of 4-chlorophenol. During the oxidation of 4-chlorophenol, the electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction were assumed to be the first step of the sulfate radical attack. A sulfate radical mediated attack on an aromatic leads to the formation of carbon-centered radicals via electron transfer from the organic compounds to the sulfate radical because SO 4 \u2212 as well as OH are electrophilic radicals [33] . The results on reaction intermediates indicated that hydroquinone and 1,4-benzoquinone were two primary intermediates from 4-chlorophenol degradation which were then further oxidized to succinic acid and oxalic acid after aromatic rings were broken, so the possible degradation pathway for 4-chlorophenol is depicted in Scheme 1 . 4 Conclusions In summary, we have developed an advanced oxidation process that uses ZVI in conjunction with PDS, which is highly effective in generating sulfate radicals. This combination is an example of a heterogeneous oxidation reaction, and the reaction can take place at near neutral pH. ZVI-PDS system using zero-valent iron as the source of ferrous ions significantly improved the degradation rate of 4-chlorophenol. The formation of intermediates such as hydroquinone and 1,4-benzoquinone showed that hydroquinone pathway is the main step in the oxidation of 4-chlorophenol. This study indicated that the addition of ZVI in combination with PDS is a feasible alternative in the treatment of wastewater containing chlorophenols. Therefore, promising and eco-friendly oxidation system is likely an interesting contribution to the field of advanced oxidation technologies.

The as-prepared samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra (DRS), respectively. The results indicate that these samples were of ordered network, which was built by the Pt skeleton frame and the outer TiO2 layer. The TiO2 layer was identified as anatase with the preferential orientation of (101) plane. The experiments of short-circuit photocurrent (SCPC) and photocatalytic degradation of phenol were also conducted under the UV irradiation in order to evaluate the photoactivity of the samples. By tuning the red edge of photonic stop-band overlapping the absorption maximum of anatase (at 360 nm), both the UV absorption and the carrier separation of the samples were improved. The kinetic constant using the optimal inverse TiO2/Pt opals (0.992 h(-1)) was about 1.5 times as great as that of the disordered inverse TiO2/Pt opals (TiO2/Pt-mix) and was 3.3 times as great as that of pristine TiO2 nanocrystalline film (TiO2-nc) on Ti substrate.",

The particles were proved to be nanoscale amorphous alloy with an average diameter of about 30 nm and a BET surface area of 20.9 m2 g(-1). Experiments for dechlorination of pentachlorophenol (PCP) by the Ni-Fe bimetallic nanoscale particles in aqueous solutions were carried out under the enhancement of ultrasound. Major factors that influence the dechlorination efficiency, such as initial pH value, Ni content in the Ni-Fe particles, and output power of ultrasonic irradiation, were investigated. The results indicated that Ni-Fe nanoscale bimetallic particles were very effective for the dechlorination of PCP. Dechlorination efficiency was 46% in 30 min under the optimal condition without assistance of ultrasound, whereas it increased to 96% when ultrasonic irradiation was present. Initial pH value showed apparent effect on the dechlorination. As the pH varied from acidic condition to neutral condition, the dechlorination efficiency decreased dramatically. In addition, the dechlorination efficiency was improved with increased Ni/Fe ratio and ultrasonic output power.

        "title": "Removal of ternary VOCs in air streams at high loads using a compost-based biofilter",
        "abstract": "Waste gases in the industry process are often characterized by the presence of multi-pollutants and concentration varieties of the compounds. In this study, the behavior of a biofilter system under high loads of ternary VOCs was studied. The biofilter was operated using a mixture of compost, lava and soil and applied to treat the air containing ethyl acetate, isopropanol and toluene. The biofilter treated up to 200 g m \u22123 bed h \u22121 of ethyl acetate and 120 g m \u22123 bed h \u22121 of isopropanol with percentage removals of nearly 100% and the empty bed retention time between 45 and 90 s. Toluene removal efficiencies were in the range of 40\u2013100% with the inlet concentration about 0.5 g m \u22123 due to the inhibition of ethyl acetate and isopropanol. During the 3 months operation, filter media clogging/channeling, pH decrease and nitrogen loss from the media resulted in the deterioration of the biofilter performance. The results demonstrated that under the conditions of pH ranging from 6.4 to 7.4 and the nitrogen content of the media above 0.3 mg g \u22121 , the mixture of ethyl acetate, isopropanol and toluene could be treated effectively using a compost-based biofilter. Keywords Biofilters VOCs Biodegradation Ethyl acetate Isopropanol Toluene 1 Introduction A large quantity of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is released from various industrial plants and processes. These VOCs will rapidly become atmospheric pollutants and are facing increasingly stringent environmental regulations. Toluene, ethyl acetate and isopropanol are among the key pollutants that are largely present in the emissions of color printing industries. Toluene is a hydrophobic compound and one of the 189 hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) listed in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendment (CAAA90) proposed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Ethyl acetate and isopropanol, on the other hand, are hydrophilic and readily biodegradable compounds. The presence of the three compounds, as well as of other VOCs, in the color printing air emissions has been the subject of the recent environmental regulations. The relevant enterprises are thus required to apply an appropriate technology to reduce their emissions. The current control technologies for these VOCs, such as thermal and catalytic incineration, are usually cost intensive and are often companioned with the generation of nitrogen oxides. Biofiltration of off-gases containing VOCs is a relatively new application of bioprocess engineering in waste management and has proven to be an effective and economical technology [1\u20134] . Biofilters work by passing humidified polluted air streams through a bed of porous media that are capable of adsorbing gaseous compounds and supporting biological growth. Under optimum conditions, biodegradable contaminants are rapidly converted to carbon dioxide and water without the accumulation of intermediates or dead-end metabolites. The biofiltration of toluene and ethyl acetate were well studied by some previous researchers [5\u20139] . Deshusses et al. [10] studied the maximum elimination capacities (EC) of isopropanol and other VOCs by biofilters using a 48 h test. However, to our knowledge to date, little studies have looked at the biofiltration of the mixture of ethyl acetate, isopropanol and toluene despite that this situation exists in a large number of air emissions. Hence, it has importance of investigating the simultaneous biofiltration of mixtures of the three compounds. The primary goal of this work was to investigate the treatability of the mixture of ethyl acetate, isopropanol and toluene, emitted from printing industries with relatively high concentrations of ethyl acetate and isopropanol, using a compost-based biofilter. The experimental work was conducted for a period about 3 months during which the biofiltration of the mixture of ethyl acetate, isopropanol and toluene and their interaction on one another were focused on. Also, the effects of pH, nitrogen content and the packing media reconstruction on the biofilter performance were investigated in order to find the optimum range of media pH and nitrogen content that was required for the biofilter operation. The results of these aspects may provide useful information concerning the design criteria and operation of full-scale biofilters treating the streams from color printing works. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Biofilter set-up The biofilter ( Fig. 1 ) was made from a transparent Plexiglas tube having a 7.5 cm diameter. It was divided into three 30 cm high sections (referred to as the first, the second and the third sections from the top to the bottom), each section being filled to a height of 19 cm with equal amounts of the prepared filter-bed materials. In order to support the packing material and to ensure homogeneous radial distribution of the input gas, a stainless steel mesh was installed at the base of each section. The airflow, supplied by an air compressor was first to pass through a granular activated carbon canister to adsorb oil and VOCs, and then was divided into four fractions. The major portion of the air was humidified to ensure that the air humidity was above 95%. The other three portions of the air were allowed to bubble through liquid VOC (ethyl acetate/isopropanol/toluene) containers with temperature regulations. The previous separated airflows were then mixed in an air mixer and the resultant polluted humid input gas was carried to the top of the biofilter, i.e. the experiments were conducted in a down flow mode of operation. Ports were placed in the biofilter column between the bed sections and were used for gas and filter material sampling. Water was added from the top of the biofilter through a water nozzle. 2.2 Filter media The filter media consisted of a \u201cmixed compost\u201d, lava, and a kind of soil containing plenty of humic substances. The \u201cmixed compost\u201d, containing 30% pig manure compost, 30% compost which was produced by the other lab of our school and 40% dehydrated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant, had been stored in a barrel for about 3 months in the laboratory and was sieved to remove visible dirt and large floc particles before being used. The media was inoculated with activated sludge mixed liquor from the wastewater treatment facility of Dalian Chemical Industry Corporation, which had been cultivated with ethyl acetate and toluene for about 20 days. 2.3 Water content of the media Water content of the media is one of the most important factors that affect the performance of the biofilter [11\u201316] . According to Sun et al. [15,16] , the optimal initial water content of the packing media treating toluene and ethyl acetate ranged from 50 to 70% and from 40 to 60%, respectively. The results of Richard Auria's research [11] showed that ethanol elimination capacity was relatively high for water contents ranging from 49 to 70%. In order to maintain the water content of the filter media in this work, the air streams were humidified above 95% relative humidity (the apparatus used for testing the relative humidity was not sensitive when the relative humidity was higher than 95%) and water was added into the bed from the top of the biofilter according to the condition of the packing media. During this project, the water content of the packing media in the first, the second and the third sections ranged from 50 to 60%, 55 to 60% and 55 to 65%, respectively. 3 Analytical methods VOC concentrations were measured online and via chromatographic analysis using a Shimadzu 14A gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a FID detector. The inlet and outlet streams, as well as from between the biofilter sections, were sampled using an air sampling apparatus connected to a 6-position switching valve (Shimadzu) with a 1 ml loop. Aqueous extracts of the packing materials were obtained by shaking mechanically with distilled water at solid-double distilled water (DDI) of 1:5 (w/v) for 2 h. The suspensions were centrifuged at 10,000 rmp and filtered through 0.45 \u03bcm membrane filters. The following analyses were carried out on the water extracts: NH 4 + \u2013N by the spectrophotometry method using Nessler reagent [17] , NO 3 \u2212 \u2013N (including NO 2 \u2212 \u2013N) by the method provided by Zhao et al. [18] . The gravimetric moisture content of the media was measured by the weight loss after the medium samples were dried at 105 \u00b0C for 2 h. To measure the pH values of the bed material, 5 g of packing media was blended with 25 ml distilled water and was determined using a digital pH monitor (Sartorious PB-S). Each time the media were sampled, the same amount (about 5 or10 g) of fresh media were added into the biofilter to compensate the media loss. 3.1 Operation and performance parameters Studies were performed on the level of the VOC inlet load (IL), the corresponding removal efficiency ( X) , elimination capacity (EC). The definitions for these parameters are set out below: (1) IL = Q C in V (2) X s = 1 \u2212 C out C in \u00d7 100 % (3) EC = Q ( C in \u2212 C out ) V where C is VOC concentration (g m \u22123 ), Q the volumetric gas flow rate (m 3 h \u22121 ) and V is the volume (m 3 ) of the packing bed considered; Subscripts \u201cin\u201d and \u201cout\u201d are referred to the inlet and outlet of the packing bed considered. EC is an actual removal capacity in the biofilter. It is usually less than load (IL) and sometimes equal to IL when 100% removal efficiency is achieved. Generally, the nearer the location is to the inlet, the higher the EC value is and the lower the removal efficiency is. If C i,s , C 1,s , C 2,s and C o,s are employed to stand for the concentrations of a substrate along the height of the biofilter (i.e. inlet concentrations, concentrations after the first and the second section, and outlet concentrations), the removal efficiencies after the gas passes the first section ( X 1,s ), the second section ( X 2,s ) and the third section ( X 3,s ) are calculated as follows: (4) X 1 , s = 1 \u2212 C 1 , s C i,s \u00d7 100 % (5) X 2 , s = 1 \u2212 C 2 , s C i,s \u00d7 100 % (6) X 3 , s = 1 \u2212 C 3 , s C i,s \u00d7 100 % Subscript \u201cs\u201d stands for a certain substance presents in the air stream (s = e, ethyl acetate, p, isopropanol, and t, toluene). All of these parameters were studied in accordance with the operating conditions, as summarized in Table 1 . The whole experimental period was split into five successive stages, i.e. A, B, C, D, and E, which were summarized in Table 2 . The biofilter was unpacked three times during the stage E. On day 51, the media were mixed mechanically and the water content was adjusted to 50\u201360%. On day 62, pH of the media was adjusted to about 7.3 using NaOH solution and the location of Sections 1 and 3 were exchanged before the reconstruction. On day 80, 30 ml of 20 g l \u22121 KNO 3 solution was added to each section of the biofilter. The average concentrations of ethyl acetate, isopropanol and toluene in the air emissions of a color printing works in East North China are about 1.0, 0.5 and 0.1 g m \u22123 , respectively. In the current experiment, the average influent concentrations of ethyl acetate and isopropanol during stages B\u2013E were remained about 2.5 and 1.0 g m \u22123 , which were twice as that in the actual air emissions. In view of the fact that toluene is much more difficult to eliminate through biofiltration than ethyl acetate and isopropanol, toluene and ethyl acetate/isopropanol were introduced at a higher ratio than that of the actual air emissions. 4 Results and discussions 4.1 Overall biofilter performance The performance of the biofilter in removing the mixtures of ethyl acetate, isopropanol and toluene was studied for a period of 3 months. As shown in Fig. 2 , ethyl acetate and isopropanol could be completely removed by the biofilter, however, toluene removal efficiency varied between 40 and 100% despite the fact that toluene inlet concentrations were relatively low. In Deshusses\u2019 study [2] , the maximum elimination capacity (EC) of ethyl acetate was 200 g m \u22123 bed h \u22121 (grams of pollutants per cubic bed media per hour), when high loads of ethyl acetate were biodegraded at the presence of toluene. When isopropanol and acetone were treated simultaneously, 90% removal efficiencies of isopropanol were obtained with influent loads about 133 g m \u22123 bed h \u22121 [19] . As shown in Fig. 3 , the biofilter in this study could provide a complete removal of ethyl acetate and isopropanol when the corresponding loads were below 200 and 120 g m \u22123 bed h \u22121 , respectively. Therefore, it is obvious that higher ECs of ethyl acetate and isopropanol could be obtained compared with the researches mentioned above. The interaction between the biodegradation of ethyl acetate and isopropnaol could only be investigated from the performance of the first two sections for the fact that the two pollutants were mostly removed by the first two sections and the third one took a minor role in removing the pollutants. Fig. 4 shows that maximum EC of ethyl acetate in the first section is about 350 g m \u22123 bed h \u22121 . In stage E, the EC values were not as homogeneous as that in the other stages due to the deterioration of the biofilter performance during this stage. Data depicted in Fig. 5 show that EC of isopropanol in the first section can achieve 150 g m \u22123 bed h \u22121 when the corresponding loads vary from 160 to 300 g m \u22123 bed h \u22121 , comparative to the maximum EC value (150 g m \u22123 bed h \u22121 ) reported by Deshusess [10] . The EC values of ethyl acetate in stage A (without isopropanol) were a little higher than that in other stages at the equivalent inlet loads, indicating that competition, including competition between the bacteria accumulation and between substances [20] , existed when isopropanol was simultaneously biodegraded with ethyl acetate. These kinds of competition are very popular in the biofilters treating the mixtures of some VOCs [21,22] . The maximum EC of toluene was only about 20 g m \u22123 bed h \u22121 and had a remarkable fluctuation ( Fig. 6 ). Also, it was found that the decrease of ethyl acetate and isopropanol removal in the upper two sections always occurred with the decrease of toluene removal in the air stream. Some examples of the VOC concentrations along the height of the biofilter are shown in Fig. 7 . It can be seen that little or no toluene removal occurred at the location where ethyl acetate and isopropanol concentrations were high, indicating that the presence of high concentrations of ethyl acetate and isopropanol inhibited the biodegradation of toluene. Similar inhibition has been found by other researchers [2\u20134,9] , however, the exact mechanisms related to this inhibition still remain unclear and the data reported by some researchers are somewhat conflicting [19\u201322] . Further research is required to determine the actual mechanisms of the inhibition in this situation. Table 3 provides the average removal efficiencies of ethyl acetate and isopropanol after the first and the second sections, together with the average removal efficiencies of toluene in the treated air. It could be noted that toluene removal efficiencies were apparently linked to the removal rates of ethyl acetate and isopropanol. The average toluene removal efficiency of toluene in the treated air was 97% during the period of stage B, when the average removal of ethyl acetate and isopropanol after the first and the second sections was 87 and 93%, respectively. During the stages C and D, the removal rates of ethyl acetate and isopropanol in the first two sections decreased due to the increase of the gas flow rate, and thus the average toluene removal efficiency dropped from 97 to 80% and then to 56%. After the air flow rate had resumed to 0.1 m 3 h \u22121 during the stage E, the removal efficiency of the mixtures increased in the first 4 days, however, significant decrease was observed from day 47 onwards. On day 50, the removal efficiency of ethyl acetate and isopropanol in the first section was only 35% (shown in Fig. 2 b), suggesting that significant deterioration of the first section of the biofilter had happened. Toluene removal efficiency on this day was 68%, much lower than that in the stage B though the removal efficiency of ethyl acetate and isopropanol after the second section (88%) was comparative to the average value in stage B (91%). This could be explained by the fact that the increase of ethyl acetate and isopropanol concentrations in the second section, resulting from the deterioration of the first section, increased the inhibition of toluene biodegradation in this section. It is obvious that the levels near to the inlet of a biofilter (the first section of this experiment), where the concentrations of pollutants are relatively high, will firstly deteriorate and the effective levels removing VOCs in the biofilter will go downwards, and accordingly, the performance of the global biofilter will deteriorate if this situation continues. Three factors were assumed to be involved in the deterioration of the biofilter performance, i.e. media compaction/channeling, acidification and nutrient limitation. In order to resume the performance of the biofilter and to evaluate the effects of these factors on the biofilter operation, several steps were taken up in stage E. 4.2 Media clogging/channeling Over a certain period of operation, clogging/channeling will occur in the packing media, partly owing to the media compaction along the air flow direction or the formation of an excessive amount of biomass [23\u201325] . Processes preventing the biofilter from clogging/channeling include physical/mechanical, chemical and biological approaches [23\u201325] . On day 51, the packing media in each section of the biofilter were removed and mixed mechanically before reassembling. Complete removal of the VOCs was achieved during days 51\u201353, indicating that clogging/channeling had occurred in the media after about 50 days of operation. The increase of VOC removal was mostly resulted from the improvement of the performance of the first two sections because toluene elimination capacities by the third sections had no obvious increase after the reconstruction ( Fig. 8 ). This phenomena suggested that clogging/channeling exerted a more significant effect on the performance of the first section compared to the third one, i.e. clogging/channeling was readily to affect the biofilter performance under a high VOC loads after a certain period of operation. From day 55 onwards, the removal efficiencies of VOCs decreased gradually ( Fig. 2 b), implying that there were still other mechanisms related to the deterioration of the biofilter performance besides the media clogging/channeling. 4.3 The variation of the media pH The measured pH of the media decreased gradually (listed in Table 4 ). Devinny and Hodge [26] studied the intermediates in an overloaded ethanol biofilter (load > 156 g m \u22123 bed h \u22121 ethanol) and found that the rapid ethanol consumption was associated with the production of acetaldehyde, acetic acid and ethyl acetate. Therefore, it was reasonable that acetic and acetaldehyde would be present in the media/air stream since ethyl acetate and ethanol existed in the air stream and the VOC loads were higher than 156 g m \u22123 bed h \u22121 in the whole biofilter. Ethanol could be detected in the air after the first section when ethyl acetate concentrations were higher than 0.6 g m \u22123 bed h \u22121 (data not shown). We tried to detect the presence of acetic acid but failed. The accumulation of the by-products in the media will decrease the pH as well as the elimination capacity for the pollutants. Another process resulting to the decrease of the media pH is associated with the nitrification of ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 + \u2013N) to nitrate nitrogen (NO 3 \u2212 \u2013N). Microorganisms can use both NH 4 + \u2013N and NO 3 \u2212 \u2013N as nitrogen sources when pollutants are assimilated. At the same time, the nitrifying of NH 4 + /NH 3 \u2013N occurs at the aerobic conditions. If the media can neutralize the proton resulted from the biodegradation and the nitrification processes, the pH will be relatively constant, and otherwise, the acidification of the packing media will occur. It could be seen from Table 4 that media pH dropped more rapidly in the first section than that in the other two sections, suggesting that pH buffer (lava) could not neutralize the acid at high loads of ethyl acetate and isopropanol. On day 62, the media in each section were unpacked again and the pH of which was adjusted to about 7.0 \u00b1 0.3, the first and the third sections were exchanged. The average removal efficiency of toluene in the treated air was below 80% after the pH adjusting, indicating that there were still some other factors affecting the biofilter performance. 4.4 The variation of nitrogen content One reason for using compost as a filter medium is that nutrients from the compost would presumably be formed by mineralization and diffuse into the biofilm to replace what is consumed by microorganisms. However, composts have a significant variation in C:N ratio and, even more importantly, some composts release all their nutrients within a few weeks, while others might have slower release rates but can provide nutrients for years. Nitrogen is one of the most readily depleted nutrient because it is a major constituent of the microorganism proteins and nucleic acids and makes up to 15% of the microbial cell dry weight. Therefore, nitrogen can be a limiting nutrient if adequate amounts are not available in the biofilter [27\u201331] . Generally, as contaminants are degraded, neither the form of the nitrogen nor the availability is constant with either time or location within a biofilter. Independent of the initial form of the nitrogen presents in the biofilter media, cell growth produces organic nitrogen. During cell death and decay, organic nitrogen is converted to ammonia, which, in turn, may be volatilized, nitrified, assimilated into new cells, or denitrified to nitrogen gas and/or ammonia in local anoxic or anaerobic zones. If the nitrogen recycling efficiency is less than 100% (i.e. denitrification, stripping, or leaching occurs), nitrogen can eventually be depleted from the media. As shown in Fig. 9 , NH 4 + \u2013N content decreased along the length of the biofilter and with the operation time. However, NO 3 \u2212 \u2013N content in the packing media did not drop distinctly until day 42, and the distribution of NO 3 \u2212 \u2013N along the biofilter length was not as regular as that of NH 4 + \u2013N. This trend may be resulted from the following aspects. Firstly, microorganisms prefer to use NH 4 + \u2013N as nitrogen source when NH 4 + \u2013N and NO 3 \u2212 \u2013N co-exist in the media for NH 4 + is more similar to the organic form. Secondly, NH 4 + \u2013N can be nitrified to NO 3 \u2212 \u2013N. And also, NO 3 \u2212 \u2013N is readily to leach out with the movement of water in the packing media [28] . During days 20\u201331 (stage B), the EC of the ethyl acetate and isopropanol in the first section ranged from 400 to 520 g m \u22123 bed h \u22121 with a retention time of 15\u201320 s. According to Demeestere et al. [31] , 0.1 mg g \u22121 NO 3 \u2212 \u2013N seemed to be a threshold concentration of the microbial available NO 3 \u2212 \u2013N, above which methanol elimination capacity up to 422 g m \u22123 bed h \u22121 were observed at the retention time of 25 s and under the load of 424 g m \u22123 bed h \u22121 . If the biofiltration of ethyl acetate and isopropanol followed this nitrogen threshold, the decrease of VOC ECs during days 46\u201351 ( Table 3 ) was not supposed to be the result of nitrogen limitation, because NO 3 \u2212 \u2013N and NH 4 + \u2013N content in the packing media ranged 0.2\u20130.4 mg g \u22121 . NH 4 + \u2013N content in the media during days 62\u201380 was about 0.1 mg g \u22121 ( Fig. 9 a), this was more than 200 times lower than that in the initial media, implying that the release of NH 4 + N from the packing media was relatively slow during this period. NO 3 \u2212 \u2013N content ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 mg g \u22121 during days 62\u201380 ( Fig. 9 b), which approximated to the threshold recommended by Demeestere et al. [31] . Therefore, nitrogen limitation was suspected to be one of the possible reasons that led to the deterioration of the biofilter performance. On day 80, 30 ml of 20 g l \u22121 KNO 3 solution was added to the media of each section, this would release about 0.7 mg g \u22121 NO 3 \u2212 \u2013N in the media. The packing media were exposed to the air for about 8 h before being repacked to assure that the water content was in the range of 50 to 65%. Above 90% removal of toluene was achieved after the addition of KNO 3 solution ( Fig. 2 ; Table 3 ). The increase of pollutant removal proved that nitrogen limitation had occurred after about 80 days of operation and nitrogen addition was necessary during the operation of the biofilter. 4.5 The overall maintenances of the biofilter During the 95-day operation, ethyl acetate and isopropanol could be removed completely, however, toluene removal efficiencies varied between 40 and 100%. Toluene removal efficiency can be maintained above 90% only during some particular periods. These periods, along with the pH values and nitrogen content, are listed in Table 5 . The pH of the media in the first section ranged from 5.7 to 7.5. Considering the whole biofilter, the average pH values varied from 6.4 to 7.4. The soluble nitrogen content ranged from 0.3 to 3.1 mg g \u22121 during these periods, indicating that the nitrogen content in the packing media should be higher than 0.3 mg g \u22121 in order to remove the VOCs successfully. Several points, which are important to the performance of a compost-based biofilter subjects to high loads of VOCs, can be made about when the overall performance of the biofilter ( Fig. 2 ) and the distribution of the VOC concentrations inside the biofilter ( Fig. 7 ) are taken into consideration. First, the clogging/channeling of the filter media should be avoided. Second, the adjustment of media pH and the addition of nitrogen are necessary for maintaining the biofilter performance. And also, the three-layer biofilter was appropriate for removing the mixtures of ethyl acetate, isopropanol and toluene, in view of the distribution of the concentration of the three pollutants in the biofilter ( Fig. 7 ). This multiphase structure makes it easier to control the biofilter performance according to the conditions of the media in each layer. 5 Conclusions Biofiltration of ethyl acetate, isopropanol and toluene was performed through a laboratory scale three-layer biofilter under high loads of ethyl acetate and isopropanol. Cent percent removal of ethyl acetate and isopropanol was achieved with influent loads of ethyl acetate and isopropanol below 200 and 120 g m \u22123 bed h \u22121 , respectively. For toluene, the biofilter achieved a maximum elimination capacity of 20 g m \u22123 bed h \u22121 with the removal rate varying from 40 to 100% and at the empty bed retention time from 45 to 90 s. The relative lower removal rate was partly resulted from the inhibition by the presence of high concentrations of ethyl acetate and isopropanol. The pH of the media decreased obviously during the biofiltration process, this decrease was related to the formation of acid by-products and the nitrification of ammonium nitrogen to nitrite and/or nitrate nitrogen. The content of the soluble nitrogen (ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen) in the media decreased gradually and the nitrogen limitation would be the limiting nutrient ultimately if no nitrogen source were added. In order to maintain the performance of the biofilter, the optimum pH range of the media should be in the range of 6.4\u20137.4 and the soluble nitrogen content in the media must be above 0.3 mg g \u22121 .

ASE and MAE provided significantly better extraction efficiency than Soxhlet extraction. The concentrations were 126.7 and 114.8%, respectively, of the values obtained by classical Soxhlet extraction, whereas the results from FBE and dive-in Soxhlet were comparable with those from the standard Soxhlet procedure. The reproducibility of FBE was the best, with RSDs ranging from 0.3 to 3.9%. Under the investigated operation conditions UE was not efficient, with the recoveries of target compounds being about 50% less than Soxhlet. Additionally, the performances of Soxhlet, dive-in Soxhlet, MAE, ASE and FBE were validated by determination of the certified reference material BCR-115. The results from the extraction techniques were in good agreement with the certified values.",

        "abstract": "Graphene oxide modified g-C 3N 4 (GO/g-C 3N 4) with efficient photocatalytic capability under visible light irradiation was fabricated by sonochemical approach. Transmission electron microscopy images demonstrated that GO was two-dimensional sheets with chiffon-like ripples and the g-C 3N 4 possessed a layered structure. GO was overlaid on the surface of g-C 3N 4 in the GO/g-C 3N 4 hybrids. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra showed that the GO/g-C 3N 4 hybrid had intense optical absorption in the visible light region. Photoluminescence spectra confirmed that the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge in GO/g-C 3N 4 was more intensive than pristine g-C 3N 4, indicating the GO acts as a separation centre and electron acceptor in the GO/g-C 3N 4 hybrid. The effective photogenerated charge separation efficiency lead to a remarkable improvement in the visible light photocatalysis. The pseudo-first-order kinetic constants of photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B and 2, 4-dichlorophenol under visible light irradiation with GO/g-C 3N 4 were 3.80 and 2.08 times as large as that with pristine g-C 3N 4, respectively. This work indicates that the metal-free GO/g-C 3N 4 hybrid photocatalyst is a promising material in waste control, and GO could be an excellent material to combine with other semiconductors to make composites. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "The anoxic-oxic (A/O) process has been extensively applied for simultaneous removal of organic contaminants and nitrogen in wastewater treatment. However, very little is known about its ability to remove toxic materials. Municipal wastewater contains various kinds of pollutants, some of which have recalcitrant genotoxicity and may cause potential threat to environment, and even can lead to extinction of many species. In this study, we have selected three municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) employing anoxic-oxic (A/O) process to evaluate their ability to remove acute toxicity and genotoxicity of wastewater. Mortality rate of zebrafish (Danio rerio) was used to evaluate acute toxicity, while micronucleus (MN) and comet assays were used to detect genotoxicity. Results showed that in this process the acute toxicity was completely removed as the treatment proceeded along with decrease in chemical oxygen demand (COD) (<50 mgL(-1)) in the effluent. However, in these treatment processes the genotoxicity was not significantly reduced, but an increase in genotoxicity was observed. Both MN and comet assays showed similar results. The eliminated effluent may pose genotoxic threaten although its COD level has met the Chinese Sewage Discharge Standard. This study suggests that further treatment of the wastewater is required after the A/O process to remove the genotoxicity and minimize the ecotoxicological risk.",

The ammonia removal was normally >95% at influent ammonia concentrations of 20-500ppmv. According to the test results, the influent ammonia concentration should be <200ppmv (0.1570g ammonia/kg media per day) so that the effluent concentration of ammonia is <1.0mg/m(3) (the emission standard of China), and the biofiltration system can achieve good long-term performance. In the biofiltration system utilized in this study, the shortest retention time that the system could attain was 0.532min. However, the retention time can be decreased further without decreasing the ammonia removal efficiency. Countercurrent flow is favorable, as it enhances the moisture retention ability of the media. In the bioreactors, ammonia can be converted into the nitrate. The bioreactors have a stratification phenomenon for ammonia removal over the biofiltration depth, which implies that different parts of the bioreactor play different roles in the ammonia removing process.",

        "abstract": "BiVO 4 film coated on F-doped SnO 2 (FTO) glass was successfully fabricated by modified metalorganic decomposition (MOD) technique. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that the film was composed of grains with 200\u2013300 nm in size and the grains were composed of particles, which were about 10 nm in size. Diffused reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) revealed that the absorption performance of the BiVO 4 film was intense in visible light region and the band gap was 2.43 eV. The analysis of X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and Raman spectra identified to the monoclinic type BiVO 4 . Photoelectrochemical measurements indicated the photocurrent densities of BiVO 4 films had an elevation with the increase of film thickness from 0.23 to 1.04 \u03bcm due to enhanced amount of absorption of the incident photons. The removal rate of phenol in photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) process by the BiVO 4 film electrode under visible light (>400 nm) was 27.1 times that in photocatalytic (PC) process. The prominent enhancement was induced by the promoted separation of photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs. Furthermore, the BiVO 4 film electrode coated on FTO glass showed good stability in the PEC process. Keywords BiVO 4 film Visible light Photocatalytic process Photoelectrocatalytic process Phenol degradation 1 Introduction Photocatalysts with visible light response has extensively been explored. Doping photocatalysts with foreign elements is effective for the construction of visible-light-driven photocatalyst materials [1,2] . However, these photocatalysts always suffer from the problems of the discrete doping levels and the low mobility of the carriers in the doping levels. Besides, the low doping quantity makes it difficult to absorb a sufficient quantity of visible light by transitions. Complex oxides have recently been under intense investigation because of their response to the visible light. Zou et al. [3] first reported In 1\u2212 x Ni x TaO 4 induced direct splitting of water into stoichiometric amounts of oxygen and hydrogen under visible light irradiation. Recently, visible light responsive complex oxides containing bismuth have also drawn the interest of a number of researchers. Shimodaira et al. [4] reported that Bi 2 MoO 6 showed an intense absorption band in the visible light region and photocatalytic (PC) activity for O 2 evolution under visible light irradiation. Zhao et al. [5] found Bi 2 WO 6 could degrade 4-CP under visible light. BiVO 4 , one of the complex oxides containing bismuth element, has attracted attention in its ferroelastic, acoustooptical and ion conductive properties [6] . Recently, monoclinic type crystal BiVO 4 powder was verified to have PC performance. It showed ability of O 2 evolution under visible light when electron acceptors were existed, but this semiconductor had no H 2 evolution ability [7,8] . The valence band (VB) of BiVO 4 is composed of hybridized Bi 6s and O 2p orbitals. The hybridization of the Bi 6s and O 2p levels makes the VB largely dispersed, which favors the mobility of photogenerated holes in the VB and is beneficial to the oxidation reaction [9\u201311] . The BiVO 4 powder could efficiently degrade pollutants under visible light [12\u201314] , confirming that BiVO 4 powder is suitable for environmental pollutants purification in terms of using visible light. However, the PC oxidation technology in suspended system always suffers from the difficulty of separating the photocatalysts from aqueous solution. Aiming to solve this problem, many researchers have made efforts to immobilize photocatalysts on a solid substrate, whereas the surface area of fixed photocatalyst exposed to the solution is lower than that of suspended photocatalyst, resulting in the decrease of PC performance. Photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) process is the versatile technique to improve the efficiency of PC process [15] . The bias potential applied to the reaction compartment promotes the separation of the photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs so as to improve the PC efficiency of the photocatalysts. Herein, BiVO 4 film electrode was produced by modified metalorganic decomposition (MOD) technique onto F-doped SnO 2 (FTO) glass. Phenol, a common pollutant in the industry wastewater, was chosen as a test substance to evaluate the PC and PEC performance of BiVO 4 film under visible light. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of BiVO 4 film electrode Vanadium (V) tri-i-propoxy oxide was purchased from Strem Chemicals, USA. All of the other reagents (analytical grade purity) were purchased from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagents Development Centre, China and were used without further purification. FTO glass, which was purchased from Geao Co., China, was employed as a substrate with a thickness of 2.2 mm and a sheet resistance of 15 \u03a9/square. The BiVO 4 films were prepared by a modified MOD method [16] . Bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO 3 ) 5 \u00b75H 2 O) was dissolved in acetic acid (CH 3 COOH) and the solution was named A; vanadium (V) tri-i-propoxy oxide was dissolved in acetylacetone (C 5 H 8 O 2 ) and the solution was named B. B was added into A with a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of Bi to V. The sol was vigorously stirred for 0.5 h. The BiVO 4 films were obtained by depositing the above sol on the FTO glass by a spin coater and annealed in air at 500 \u00b0C for 2 h. The coating and annealing processes were repeated to result in different coating layers. 2.2 Characterization of the prepared samples The morphology and microstructure of the BiVO 4 films were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM FEI-Tecnai G 2 20) and scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-5600LV) with an accelerating voltage of 30.0 kV. The crystal structure of the films was investigated using X-ray diffractometry (XRD Rigaku D/MAX-2400) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation, accelerating voltage of 40 kV, current of 30 mA and a scanning rate of 0.02\u00b0 s \u22121 in the 2 \u03b8 range of 10\u201370\u00b0. UV\u2013visible absorption spectra of the samples were recorded on a UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (UV-160A) with a wavelength range of 350\u2013800 nm. The Raman spectrum was obtained using a Renishaw Micro-Raman System 2000 spectrometer operated at He\u2013Ne laser excitation. The film thickness was measured by surfcorder (ET 4000M) and three points were detected for every sample. 2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements The experimental cell was a standard three-electrode configuration with the BiVO 4 film electrode as photo-anode, a platinum foil as counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode. Photocurrent densities were measured using a CHI electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments 650B, Shanghai Chenhua, China). A 150 W Xe lamp (Shanghai Jiguang Light, China) served as the visible light source. The light was passed through a glass filter, which allowed wavelength above 400 nm to be incident on the photo-anode at a measured intensity of 30 mW cm \u22122 . 2.4 Photoelectrocatalytic degradation of phenol The PEC degradation of phenol was performed in a cuboid quartz reactor. The initial concentration of phenol was 5 mg L \u22121 with 0.01 M sodium sulfate as the electrolyte and the initial volume of phenol solution was 45 mL. The BiVO 4 film electrode, a platinum foil and a SCE served as photo-anode, cathode and the reference electrode respectively. The action area of BiVO 4 film electrode was 6 cm 2 . The light source and the light intensity were the same as photoelectrochemical measurement process. Bias potentials applied on the photo-anode were 0.6 V vs. SCE. The concentration of phenol was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Waters 2695, Photodiode Array Detector 2996) with a SunFire C18 (5 \u03bcm) reverse-phase column at 30 \u00b0C. Methanol and water (v:v = 0.55:0.45) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min \u22121 served as the mobile phase. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD patterns BiVO 4 has three main crystal forms: tetragonal zircon type, monoclinic scheelite type and tetragonal scheelite type. Their properties strongly depend on the crystal form [7] . Only monoclinic scheelite type BiVO 4 has PC performance due to the distortion of the Bi\u2013O polyhedron [8] . The XRD pattern of the film was shown in Fig. 1 . The crystal form of BiVO 4 can be identified to the monoclinic scheelite type by the diffraction pattern shown in Fig. 1 according to JCPDS card no. 14-0688 (lattice constants of a = 5.195 nm, b = 11.7 nm, c = 5.092 nm, and \u03b2 = 90.38\u00b0). The characteristic peaks are at 15.2\u00b0, 18.8\u00b0, 28.9\u00b0, 30.6\u00b0, 34.5\u00b0 and 35.2 \u00b0 of 2 \u03b8 [12] . And the monoclinic scheelite BiVO 4 can also be certified by existence of the splitting of peaks at 18.5\u00b0, 35\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 of 2 \u03b8 [17] . 3.2 SEM and TEM observations The morphology of the BiVO 4 film was presented in Fig. 2 . It was seen that the film was composed of many grains with 200\u2013300 nm in size. The microstructure of the film detected by TEM was shown in Fig. 3 . The TEM image showed that the grains were composed of particles, which were about 10 nm in size ( Fig. 3 (a)). The HRTEM of the sample was presented in Fig. 3 (b). It can be measured that the d spacing was 0.3099 nm, which matches well to the lattice spacing of (1 2 1) of monoclinic BiVO 4 according to the JCPDS card no. 14-0688. 3.3 DRS analysis The optical absorption property of a semiconductor, which is relevant to the electronic structure feature, is recognized as an important character of the semiconductor. The UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy of the BiVO 4 film was shown in Fig. 4 (a) . The BiVO 4 film showed intense absorption in the visible light region (from 400 to 500 nm) in addition to that in the UV light region. The band gap absorption edge was around 510 nm. The steep shape of the spectrum in the visible light region is due to the transition of the band gap [18,19] . The band gap was determined to be 2.43 eV according to the function: (1) \u03b1 h \u03bd = A ( h \u03bd \u2212 E g ) n / 2 where n in the function equals 1 for the BiVO 4 because BiVO 4 is the directly allowed optical transition ( Fig. 4 (b)) [20] . The value of the estimated band gap agreed well with those of the monoclinic type BiVO 4 in other literatures [21] where band gap values of 2.4 eV were reported for monocline BiVO 4 film. 3.4 Raman spectra The Raman spectrum of the BiVO 4 film on FTO was presented in Fig. 5 . The peaks at 822, 365, 325, and 219 cm \u22121 were assigned to the symmetric stretch mode of V\u2013O, the symmetric deformation mode of VO 4 3\u2212 , the asymmetric deformation mode of VO 4 3\u2212 , and the external mode of the monoclinic BiVO 4 [22,23] . The Raman analysis showed that the BiVO 4 was well crystallized with the monoclinic structure, which was in accordance with the result of XRD observation. 3.5 Photoelectrochemical measurements The photocurrent densities vs. electrode potential (V vs. SCE) in 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution for BiVO 4 films with different coating layers under visible light illumination (30 mW cm \u22122 ) were shown in Fig. 6 , the inset showed the film thicknesses of different coating layers. The photocurrent density of electrode was determined by tow opposite factors about film thickness [24,25] . The photocurrent density increased with the increasing the film thickness due to the enhanced amount of absorption of the incident photons. While the light intensity usually attenuates as it penetrates into the solid photocatalyst film. When the film thickness is thicker than the light penetration depth, the film far from the light source absorbed few incident photons and served an obstacle of the transporting of the charge from and to the bulk electrolyte to the substrate due to the longer diffusion path. The photocurrent densities had an elevation with the increase of the electrode layers from one to six corresponding to the film thickness from 0.23 to 1.04 \u03bcm, indicating that the thickness of 1.04 \u03bcm is thinner than the light penetration depth and the elevated photocurrent density is due to the enhanced amount of absorption of the incident photons. The dark current densities of the determined electrodes were negligible. 3.6 Photoelectrocatalytic degradation of phenol Fig. 7 displayed the phenol concentration as a function of reaction time on BiVO 4 film electrode in the electrochemical (EC), direct photolytic (DP), PC and PEC processes under Xe lamp (>400 nm) irradiation. In 8 h, the phenol removal efficiency were only 3.0% and 2.8% in EC and DP process, respectively, indicating the elimination of the phenol in EC and DP processes was negligible. The elimination efficiency of phenol in PEC process was 95.6% in 8 h, while it was only 10.4% in PC process, indicating the PC performance of the BiVO 4 film was prominently enhanced by PEC process. It was found that the phenol elimination in four processes followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics by the linear transforms ln( C 0 / C t ) = \u2212 kt ( k is kinetic constant). The k of phenol removal in PEC process (0.371 h \u22121 ) was 27.1 times that in PC process (0.0137 h \u22121 ). Such enhancement confirmed that the bias potential applied in PEC process could efficiently separate the photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs by transporting the photogenerated electron to the counter electrode and therefore inhibit the combination. 3.7 Stability of the BiVO 4 film electrode To evaluate the stability of the BiVO 4 film electrode, repeated experiments were carried out and the result was shown in Fig. 8 . After five recycles for the photodegradation of phenol, no significant loss of activity was found, confirming photo corrosion of BiVO 4 film was not significant. Furthermore, the fall of the BiVO 4 was not obvious during the reaction, testifying that BiVO 4 film was coated on the FTO tightly. The crystal structure of the BiVO 4 film detected by Raman spectra was also unchanged after PEC process (data not shown). 4 Conclusions In summary, monoclinic type BiVO 4 film with 2.43 eV band gap was fabricated by MOD technique. The BiVO 4 film showed intense absorbance performance in visible light region and prominent PEC performance under visible light. Compared with PC degradation, the prominent enhancement of 27.1 times of the phenol removal rate in PEC process was induced by the promoted separation of photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs. The phenol removal efficiency in PEC process was 95.6% in 8 h. Furthermore, no significant loss of activity was found after five cycles for the photodegradation of phenol. Considering the PEC performance and the stability of BiVO 4 film electrode, it is believed that this electrode may have potential application in the field of pollutants elimination.

        "abstract": "A series of iron-modified Ce/TiO2 catalysts with different Fe/Ti molar ratios were prepared by an impregnation method and used for selective catalytic reaction (SCR) of NOx with NH3. The Fe-Ce/TiO2 catalyst with a Fe/Ti molar ratio of 0.2 had good low-temperature activity and sulfur-poisoning resistance compared with the Ce/TiO2 catalyst. The introduction of Fe could increase the amount of Ce3+ and chemisorbed oxygen species on the catalyst surface and thereafter generate more ionic NH4 + and in situ formed NO2, respectively. In addition, the dispersion of cerium oxide could be improved by the addition of iron, and no visible phase of iron oxide could be observed at low Fe/Ti molar ratios (0.2). All of these factors played significant roles in the enhanced catalytic activity, especially the low-temperature activity. Furthermore, mechanisms of the SCR reaction and the SO2 poisoning of the Fe(0.2)-Ce/TiO2 catalyst were studied using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. Coordinated NH3 and ionic NH4 + species as well as adsorbed NO2 might be the key intermediates in the SCR reaction in the relatively low-temperature range. The formation of ammonium sulfate appeared to be the dominant cause for the catalyst deactivation in SO 2-containing gases. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "A photoelectrochemical immunosensor was developed by incorporating graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and highly oriented silicon nanowires (SiNWs) for the determination of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) in water samples. The GQDs/SiNWs heterostructure was employed for signal transduction and biocompatible nanoscaffold for antibody (Ab) immobilization. The results showed that the fabricated GQDs/SiNWs electrode exhibited better photoelectrochemical performance than that of SiNWs. The specific recognition of MC-LR affected the optoelectronic properties of the Ab/GQDs/SiNWs electrode, leading to the photocurrent decreases. In the linear range from 0.1 \ufffd\ufffdg L-1 to 10 \ufffd\ufffdg L-1, the photocurrent decrease was proportional to the concentration of microcystin-LR and the linear regression equation was Y = 59.67 - 6.08X with a limit of detection of 0.055 \ufffd\ufffdg L-1. The immunosensor possessed good sensitivity, selectivity and acceptable reusability for the determination of microcystin-LR, which was successfully applied in determining MC-LR in real water samples. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "A TiO2-boron doped diamond (TiO2-BDD) heterojunction was employed as a photocatalyst to simultaneously oxidize an azo dye C.I. reactive yellow 15 (RY15) and reduce hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). This heterojunction was fabricated first by depositing a BDD film on a Ti sheet in a hot filament chemical vapor deposition reactor, followed by covering a layer of TiO2 in a metal-organic chemical vapor deposition system. The morphology of this heterojunction was characterized by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and current-voltage (I-V) measurement were used to characterize its structures. Additionally, the characterization of surface photovoltage showed that the TiO2-BDD heterojunction exhibited a higher photovoltage response and a better ability for charge separation than the photocatalyst of TiO2 directly deposited on a Ti sheet (TiO2-Ti). The photocatalytic experiments revealed that the kinetic constants for the oxidation of RY15 and the reduction of Cr(VI) were, respectively, increased by 85 and 71% when the photocatalyst of TiO2-Ti was replaced by the TiO2-BDD heterojunction. Meanwhile, a significant synergy was confirmed in the simultaneous oxidation of RY15 and reduction of Cr(VI). The enhanced photocatalytic ability of the TiO2-BDD composite could be attributed to the heterojunction. The possible photocatalytic mechanism was also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Sulfate inhibits anaerobic digestion because it stimulates sulfate reduction bacteria (SRB) to compete with methanogens for electron utilization and sulfide produced has toxicity to microorganism. Considering that zero-valent iron (ZVI) is expected to abbreviate the above negative effects due to its reductibility, a ZVI bed was packed into an anaerobic (ZVI-anaerobic) reactor (R1) for improvement of sulfate-containing wastewater treatment. The results showed that R1 could maintain high COD removal performance (87.4%) at sulfate concentration (1100. mg/L), significantly higher than a control reactor without ZVI (R2, 58.2%). In R1, 95% of the sulfate was reduced at the bottom, which decreased its effects on methanogens in the upper portion. In consequence, the COD removal in the upper portion of R1 (39.4%) was significantly higher than that of R2 (11.4%). Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that the fractions of methanogens and SRB presented highest in the upper portion and the bottom of R1 respectively. PCR-DGGE analysis indicated that the microbial communities between the bottom and the upper part of R1 were different and diversity by the addition of ZVI bed. The functionalized partitioning of microbial activities in R1, i.e., most sulfate reduction occurring in the bottom and more efficient methanogenesis occurring in the upper, which was similar to a two-stage anaerobic reactor for sulfate-containing wastewater treatment, made this ZVI-anaerobic reactor displayed well. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

Firstly, PCP in water was adsorbed onto GAC, then the PCP was decomposed and GAC regenerated by MW irradiation. The liquid and gas produced during irradiation were collected through condensing, and absorbed by a 0.1 mol l \u22121 NaOH solution, respectively. The determination of the PCP concentrations in the distillate, absorption solution and GAC was accomplished by a HPLC. The results suggested that when irradiated with 850 W MW for 10 min, most of the PCP adsorbed by GAC and whatever fragments formed were decomposed to CO 2 , H 2 O and HCl or tightly bound to GAC, and less than 2% of PCP was transformed into intermediates in the distillate. Some dechlorination and dehydroxylation products were identified by the GC/MS analysis, and the degradation mechanism was proposed. It was also confirmed that GAC could be reused after several adsorption/MW regeneration cycles and its adsorption capacity could maintain a relatively high level, even higher than that of virgin GAC, as indicated by BET results, iodine values and PCP adsorption isotherms.",

Kinetics data obtained for the adsorption of these model pollutants at open-circuit and 400mV, -400mV polarization was applied to the Lagergren equation, and adsorption rate constants (Ka) were determined. With the anodic polarization of 400mV, the capacity of sodium phenoxide increases from 0.0083mmol x g(-1) at open-circuit to 0.18mmol x g(-1), and a seventeen-fold enhancement is achievable; however, the capacity of p-nitrophenol decreases from 2.93 mmol x g(-1) at open-circuit to 2.65 mmol x g(-1). With the cathodal polarization of -400mV, the capacity of aniline improves from 3.60 mmol x g(-1) at open-circuit to 3.88 mmol x g(-1); however, the capacity of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate reduces from 2.20 mmol x g(-1) at open-circuit to 1.59 mmol x g(-1). The enhancement for electrosorption changes with different groups substituting. Anodic polarization enhances the adsorption of benzene with electron-donating group. But whether anodic or not cathodal polarization has less effect on the adsorption of electron-accepting aromatic compounds, and decreases the adsorption of benzene bearing donor-conjugate bridge-acceptor but increases the adsorption rate. Electrostatic interaction plays a very important role in electrosorption of ion-pollutants.",

For this purpose, seasonally existent crop compartment, time-variant emission rates, and seasonal model parameters are provided in the model calculation. Besides, crop processing factor (PF) is also introduced to calculate the concentration in foodstuff produced by crop. The fate of three HCHs from 1952 to 2011 is calculated. Sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis, and model comparison are conducted to evaluate the model. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the LRBPOP model is most sensitive to air and water advection, HCHs applied rate, and reaction half-life in soil. Model comparison shows that absolute levels, partitioning between media, temporal trends, and ratios between HCHs reproduce well within an order of magnitude, often within a factor of 3. The predicted results indicate that the study area has been subject to severe contamination of HCHs in the early of 1980s, and the residues of three HCHs decrease largely with different vanishing rates after 1983. According to modeling results, the 97.5th percentiles of SigmaHCH residues in surface water, agricultural soil, and crop food are lower than the corresponding maximum residue limits (MRLs) in 2008, 2005, and 2005, respectively.",

A typical monolith has a structure with parallel and usually straight channels or cells, and the catalysts are dispersed on the channels\u2019 wall. This reactor design provides a large gas\u2013solid contact area and the low pressure drop (up to two orders of magnitude) [1] . Monolithic substrates are generally made of cordierite or metal alloys, but its impermeable walls suppress radial mixing. In monoliths, the interphase mass transfer was low [2] . Under certain circumstances the performance limit for pollutant removal of the monolith catalysts was determined by the rate of external mass transfer [3] . Therefore, the new structure catalysts should combine highly enhanced mass transfer and moderate flow resistances compared with monolith. Recently, wire mesh catalysts had received much interest. Wire mesh catalysts are commonly used in the production of nitric acid from ammonia, and are made of pure noble metal (Pt/Rt catalyst). However, this kind of catalyst is very expensive. Currently, many non-noble wire mesh catalysts had been developed. Lyubovsky et al. reported the application of the Microlith \u00ae catalysts (consist of wire meshes) with supported Pd-based catalyst to catalytic combustion and demonstrated this kind of catalyst had the stable performance at about 800 \u00b0C over a wide range of inlet conditions [4] . Ahlstr\u00f6m-Silversand and Odenbrand compared the performance of wire mesh, monolith and pellets catalysts, and found that wire mesh catalysts had high mass and heat transfer numbers [5] . Mass transfer volumetric coefficients of wire gauzes were up to 90 times higher than that of standard monoliths [6] . However, wire mesh catalysts was structured by single gauzes stacked, which was inconvenient for being assembled in the reactor. Wire mesh honeycomb that is manufactured by stacking alternatively corrugated and plain wire mesh sheets is new structure catalytic reactor, and its structure combines the characteristics of wire mesh and monolith catalyst. It had been used in catalytic oxidation of 1,2-dichlorobenzene [7] , ethyl acetate [8,9] , volatile organic compounds in air [10] and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO x [11] . In contrast to the study on catalytic process in the new structured catalytic reactor, little work was focused on the mass transfer characterization of wire mesh honeycomb catalysts. A perfect description of the mass transfer process is important to design the wire mesh honeycomb catalyst, and the physical size and other geometric parameters of the catalyst can be obtained by parameters of mass transfer. Jiang et al. applied the Sh expressions of honeycomb, gauze and packed bed to model the oxidation of ethyl acetate in wire mesh honeycomb modules, and found that the packed bed type Sh expression could predict the catalytic behavior satisfactorily [12] . Selective catalytic reduction of NO x with NH 3 is used worldwide for NO x abatement from stationary resources. The design of monolith catalyst or reactors is a key technology for SCR. Constructing a model of monolith reactor for SCR of NO x is beneficial for designing and controlling of integrated after-treatment systems. The aim of this paper is to develop a numerical model to simulate the SCR of NO x with NH 3 on wire mesh honeycomb catalyst so as to accurately describe the reactor performance. The modeling calculation is verified by the experimental data. The interphase and intraphase mass transfers are analyzed in order to investigate the effect of washcoat and size of the channel on the mass transfer. The performances of wire mesh honeycomb catalyst and ceramic monolith catalyst are compared in this study. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The plain and corrugated sheets were adopted, and they were stacked alternately to construct wire mesh honeycomb. It consisted of arrays of parallel channels with the porous wall, and the shape of the channels was sinusoidal. The wire mesh used for manufacturing wire mesh honeycomb had a wire diameter ( d 0 ) of 0. 13 mm. Because the surface areas of metal wire are very low and the catalysts cannot be dispersed directly, it is necessary to deposit the ceramic oxide washcoat with a high surface area over the wire mesh substrate. Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method had been employed to deposit alumina washcoat on the wire mesh substrates. The alumina suspension was prepared with \u03b3-alumina (\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 ) powders gritted from \u03b3-alumina pellets. Polycyclic acid and aluminum isopropoxide were used as additives. The detailed prepared approaches were described in previous work [13] . The wire mesh honeycomb was coated by an Al 2 O 3 washcoat with a thickness of 30\u201370 \u03bcm, and the specific surface area of the Al 2 O 3 layer ( S a ) was about 87.5 m 2 /g. The Al 2 O 3 -coated wire mesh honeycomb was impregnated in titania sol which was prepared by hydrolysis of tetra- n -butyl titanate [Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 ]. The impregnated sample was dried at 110 \u00b0C for 3 h and calcined in air at 500 \u00b0C for 2 h. After preparing TiO 2 washcoat, the samples were impregnated into the solution of the vanadium oxalate, which was prepared from ammonium metavanadate and oxalic acid, and ammonium tungstate. Following the impregnation step, the catalysts were dried at 110 \u00b0C for 3 h and calcined at 350 \u00b0C for 2 h. The composition of catalyst was 3 wt.% V 2 O 5 \u20137 wt.% WO 3 \u2013TiO 2 . 2.2 Catalytic tests The catalytic studies were carried out in a continuous tubular fixed-bed reactor which was a square-shape reactor (40 mm \u00d7 40 mm in width) made of stainless steel with a total bed length of 1000 mm equipped with a temperature controller. The size of wire mesh honeycomb catalyst was 38 mm \u00d7 38 mm \u00d7 20 mm. The reaction gas mixture consisted of 900 ppm NO, 1000 ppm NH 3 and 3% O 2 in a N 2 balance. The reactant gases flowed into the reactor and the activity measurements were performed in the temperature range from room temperature to 450 \u00b0C. The experiments were normally performed in the mass transfer controlled region, where the observed reaction rate had exceedingly weak dependence on temperature. On the basic of the Eley\u2013Rideal mechanism between adsorbed NH 3 and gaseous (or weakly adsorbed) NO, the simple expression was adopted to describe the reaction rate of NO on the catalyst surface, in line with the literature on SCR monolith catalysts [14,15] : (1) r NO = k C NO k N H 3 C N H 3 1 + k N H 3 C N H 3 Basing on the characteristics of our catalytic system and a preliminary analysis, the assumptions were made: (1) the reaction takes place under isothermal conditions due to very low concentration of NO and NH 3 . (2) The kinetic dependence on O 2 could be neglected for O 2 feed concentrations in excess of 2% (v/v) [15] . (3) For the overstoichiometric feed ratios (NH 3 /NO > 1) and large amount of oxygen, the SCR reaction could be considered to a first-order with respect to NO and zero-order with respect to NH 3 [16,17] . 2.3 Model description 2.3.1 Reactor model The simulation of a wire-mesh honeycomb can be performed using models taking axial dispersion into consideration. In this study one-dimensional catalyst model was selected. The assumption of a single channel model implied uniform catalyst distribution, a plug flow and an adiabatic reactor. In developing the model of wire mesh honeycomb reactor the axial dispersion was taken into account. Therefore, for the case of isothermal first-order reaction, one-dimensional two-phase model is (2) 1 P e r \u00d7 d 2 X d z 2 \u2212 d X d z + Da ( 1 \u2212 X ) = 0 , \u2003 z = 1 L , \u2009\u200a\u200a X = C A C A 0 The conversion ( X ) can be determined by solving the second-order ordinary differential equation. Eq. (2) is solved numerically and the isothermal solution for a first-order reaction is given in Eq. (3) : (3) X = 1 \u2212 4 q \u2009 exp ( P e r / 2 ) ( 1 + q ) 2 \u2009 exp ( P e r \u2009 q / 2 ) \u2212 ( 1 \u2212 q ) 2 \u2009 exp ( \u2212 P e r q / 2 ) , \u2003 q = 1 + 4 Da P e r Damk\u00f6hler number ( Da ) is obtained according to D a = ( \u03c9 c k ov / v 0 ) , where w c is the weight of catalyst, k ov is the overall rate constant, and v 0 is the volume flow. Peclet number Pe r = ( UL / \u025b b D a ) is dependent on the axial dispersion coefficient (effective Aris\u2013Taylor dispersion coefficient) D a = D AB + ( U 2 ( D h /2) 2 )/48 D AB , the superficial gas velocity ( U ) and the catalytic bed length ( L ). 2.3.2 The mass transfer coefficient and J D ( j -factor for mass transfer) A simple balance of NO x over wire mesh honeycomb catalyst was described with the boundary condition of zero NO x concentration at the wall. The mass transfer coefficient ( k m ) can be calculated from the conversion of NO x obtained in the totally mass transfer controlled region according to Eq. (4) : (4) k m = \u2212 v 0 a ext \u2009 ln ( 1 \u2212 X exp ) j -factor for mass transfer was calculated from the conversion according to Ahlstr\u00f6m-Silversand and Odenbrand [5] : (5) J D = \u2212 \u03b5 b A a ext \u2009 ln ( 1 \u2212 X exp ) \u03bd D g 2 / 3 where J D = Sh/Re Sc 1/3 , Re = D h U / \u03b5 b v . 2.3.3 Model parameters For first-order isothermal system, the overall effectiveness factor, k ov , which reflects the integrated effect of the pore diffusion, interphase mass transfer and intrinsic reaction, is defined as (6) 1 k ov = 1 k m a ext / w c + 1 \u03b7 k r where a ext is the specific gas\u2013solid interphase area, \u03b7 is the effectiveness factor and k r is intrinsic reaction rate constant. For first-order reaction, k r = k r 0 exp( \u2212 E a / T ). There are two important types of mass transfer limitation in monolith reactor. The first is diffusion limitation of reactants from the gas bulk into surface of the washcoat. Another is the diffusion in the porous washcoat. The effects of interphase mass transfer and intraporous diffusion are characterized by the express 1 \u2212 C As / C A and the effectiveness factor ( \u03b7 ), respectively. The effectiveness factor is calculated from Thiele modulus: (7) \u03b7 = 3 \u03d5 2 ( \u03d5 \u2009 coth ( \u03d5 ) \u2212 1 ) Thiele modulus of a first-order reaction is evaluated from the intrinsic reaction rate ( k r ), the catalyst density ( \u03c1 c ), the effective diffusivity ( D eff ), the catalyst volume ( V c ) and the exterior surface area ( a ext ): (8) \u03d5 = V c a ext k r \u03c1 c D eff where D eff = ( ( 1 / D g ) + ( 1 / D k ) ) \u2212 1 ( \u03b5 c / \u03c4 ) , \u2009\u200a\u200a D k = 97.0 r \u2032 ( T / M ) = 194 ( V p / S a ) ( T / M ) . The effectiveness factor and C As / C A usually have the value between 0 and 1. The value of 1 indicates that the diffusion is not important, whilst the value less than 1 indicates that there is diffusion limitation. 2.3.4 Properties of wire mesh honeycomb catalyst When the external surface area of the catalyst is calculated, the catalyst layer is assumed to be evenly coated on the surface of wire mesh honeycomb substrate. The external surface is then calculated from the external surface area of wire mesh honeycomb substrate ( S wmh ), the wire mesh radius ( r 0 ), the catalyst weight ( w c ) and the density of the catalyst layer ( \u03c1 c ): (9) a ext = w c 2 \u03c0 r \u03c1 c ( \u03c0 r 2 \u2212 \u03c0 r 0 2 ) = 2 w c S wmh \u03c1 c r 0 + S wmh 2 where the external surface area S wmh = ( 2 w m / \u03c1 F e r 0 ) . 2.3.5 Pressure drop Wire mesh honeycomb can be described as a sinusoidal monolith with opening wall, so the pressure drop can be calculated with the Darcy\u2013Weisbach equation that is well-known for predicting pressure drop of monolith [5] . For Darcy\u2013Weisbach equation, pressure drop is calculated from the superficial gas velocity ( U ), the length of monolith ( L ), the hydraulic diameter ( D h ), the friction coefficient ( f ) and the density of the gas ( \u03c1 ): (10) \u0394 P = f L \u03c1 U 2 2 D h where the friction coefficient f = ( 64 / Re ) , \u2009\u200a\u200a Re = ( D h U / \u03b5 b v i ) . On the other hand, wire mesh can be treated as stacked wire mesh catalyst with sinusoidal mesh holes. Ergun's model that usually described pressure drop through packed bed was employed to calculate pressure drop of wire mesh catalyst by Ahlstr\u00f6m-Silversand and Odenbrand [5] . Furthermore, Ergun equation was adjusted to meet the new geometry of stacked wire mesh by Ko\u0142ldzie and \u0141okewska [18] . The Ergun equation commonly is given as following, where the particle diameter is replaced with hydraulic diameter of wire mesh honeycomb: (11) \u0394 P = 150 G h U L D h 2 ( 1 \u2212 \u03b5 b ) 2 \u03b5 b 3 + 1.75 \u03c1 U 2 L D h 1 \u2212 \u03b5 b \u03b5 b 3 3 Results and discussion 3.1 j -Factor and Sherwood numbers The correlation of Sh could be regressed from the experimental data. Ahlstr\u00f6m-Silversand and Odenbrand had demonstrated that Sh expression could be predicted according to the correlations between the j -factor for mass transfer and Reynolds number calculated from experimental data [5] . In the section, the mass transfer coefficient and J D were calculated from the experimental data obtained in the mass transfer controlled region according to Eqs. (4) and (5) , and the j-factor plotted versus the Reynolds number is shown in Fig. 1 . By non-linear curve fitting, the expression of a power-law fit to the experimental data is obtained: (12) J D = 1.08 R e 0.50 \u2009\u200a\u200a ( 1.1 < Re < 138 ) According to J D = ( Sh / Re Sc 1/3 ), therefore, the Sherwood number was calculated as (13) S h = 1.08 \u2009 R e 0.5 \u2009 S c 1 / 3 The Sh expression of wire mesh honeycomb is the same as the type of packed bed catalyst, which was consistent with the study by Jiang et al. [12] . 3.2 Influence of the washcoat thickness The catalytic activities of wire mesh honeycomb catalyst with different thickness were studied. A set of wire mesh honeycomb catalysts with different washcoat thickness was prepared with the catalytic active phase (V 2 O 5 \u2013WO 3 ) kept at constant of 10 wt.%. The experimentally obtained conversion and calculated data for NO x catalytic reduction are presented in Fig. 2 . As can be seen, the agreement between experimental and calculated data is excellent, which indicates that the model can predict well the influence of washcoat thickness on NO x conversion over wire mesh honeycomb catalysts. In Fig. 2 , it is also found that NO x conversion depends markedly on the washcoat thickness. The wire mesh catalyst with 50 \u03bcm exhibits the higher catalytic activity for NO x than the catalysts with 70 and 30 \u03bcm. The thinnest washcoat leads to the lowest NO x conversion. Washcoat thickness can have a significant effect on the catalyst activity [19] . The effect of washcoat on catalytic reaction has two parts: catalytic compounds loading and diffusion of reactants. For wire mesh honeycomb catalysts, it is common practice to maximize the number of active sites by dispersing the catalytic components onto the washcoat. Although the procedure maximizes the catalytic area, it introduces the mass transfer limit of the reactant to the catalytic sites. The diffusion in the catalyst/washcoat layer is significant factor influencing the catalyst activity [20] . The effectiveness factor ( \u03b7 ) reflects intraporous diffusion, and the expression C As /C A represents the interphase mass transfer. Figs. 3 and 4 show that the effectiveness factor and C As /C A of the catalysts with different washcoat thickness, respectively. The results show that the effectiveness factors decrease with increasing the washcoat thickness, which indicates the dramatic influence of intraporous diffusion for thick washcoat, specially, at high temperature. The effectiveness factor of the washcoat of 30 \u03bcm is greater than 0.9 at all temperatures. The influence of intraporous diffusion is small and can be ignored. Thus, for the wire mesh honeycomb catalysts with 30 \u03bcm, the low NO x conversion could be associated with the catalytic sites. As shown in Fig. 5 (a) , SEM micrographs of wire mesh honeycomb coated Al 2 O 3 washcoat with 30 \u03bcm presents that the thin washcoat is coated on the substrate, which could lead to the small loading of catalytic compounds. In addition, the amount of catalytic active sites increases when the washcoat thickness increases. Therefore, the wire mesh honeycomb catalyst with 50 \u03bcm exhibits the higher NO x conversion. But further increasing the washcoat thickness (in Fig. 5 (b)), the effectiveness factor decreases, and the washcoat has a negative effect on NO x conversion due to the intraporous diffusion resistance. Furthermore, for a thicker washcoat, although the amount of catalytic sites is sufficient, some sites are not accessible within the residence time of reactants [21] . On the other hand, the washcoat affects the surface concentration of reactants on the catalysts. The plots of the ratio of surface to bulk concentration ( C As /C A ) with temperature are shown in Fig. 4 . It is apparent that the ratio decreases with increasing temperature. The catalyst with 70 \u03bcm washcoat thickness has the lowest ratio, which is in accordance with modeling results by Hayes et al. [22] . They reported that the washcoat could induce the larger variations in concentration around the surface, and the concentration on the washcoat in the corners was low where washcoat was thick. This is also one reason of low NO x conversion for thick washcoat catalyst, and it indicates the effect of interphase diffusion resistance on catalytic activity. 3.3 Influence of the cell density Catalytic activities of wire mesh honeycomb catalysts with cell density from 40 to 70 cpsi (the cells per square inch) are studied. All catalysts were coated with Al 2 O 3 washcoat and active material was the same as that with 50 \u03bcm washcoat thickness in Section 3.2 . Comparison of NO x conversion between experimental data and the prediction obtained by one-dimensional model for wire mesh honeycomb catalyst with different cell density is shown in Fig. 6 . It can be found that there is good agreement between the experimental data and theoretically predicted ones in the case of cell density 40 and 50 cpsi, whereas a deflection of calculation is observed for cell density 70 cpsi. The difference may be attributed to the assumption of a plug flow when one-dimensional catalyst model is adopted. Because the channel of wire mesh honeycomb is interconnected with each other through the openings in the wire mesh sheet, the gas feed entering the reactor can flow in three-dimensional directions, creating flow disturbance that increase mass transfer to the wall [23] . Furthermore, the different catalytic activity caused by the channel size of wire mesh honeycomb reflects the importance of interphase mass transfer. The ratio C As / C A of catalyst with different cell density is compared in Fig. 7 . It shows that the surface concentration of reactant increases with increasing the cell density. The high cell density means the small cell space, and the interphase mass transfer path length for reactant from bulk gas to the surface of catalyst is short. 3.4 Influence of space velocity (GHSV) The effect of space velocity on the NO x conversion is studied, and the NO x conversion data measured were compared with the calculated data in Fig. 8 . On the whole, the NO x conversion decreases slightly with increasing GHSV. There is a good agreement between the experimental result and the predicted data at low GHSV. However, it is also important to note that there is a difference between calculation and practice at high GHSV because NO x conversion at 8000 h \u22121 is higher than that at 6000 h \u22121 at the temperature range from 240 to 400 \u00b0C. The higher GHSV means the shorter residence time, therefore NO x conversion decreased with GHSV. However, in the case of higher GHSV, high linear velocity could increase the gas flow disturbance caused by the porous wall to improve the mass transfer from the bulk gas to the catalyst surface. 3.5 Pressure drop When the pollutant gas stream enters wire mesh honeycomb, a pressure drop usually develops along the reactor length. A higher pressure drop represents a loss in power. Therefore, maximum permitted pressure drops is an important design parameter for honeycomb as a part of the overall system engineering and economics. The pressure drops are modeled with the modified Darcy\u2013Weisbach equation and Ergun equation, respectively, and the results are compared with the experimental data. As shown in Fig. 9 (a) , it can be found that the Darcy\u2013Weisbach equation is not fit for predicting the pressure drop of wire mesh honeycomb because the measure value is higher clearly than the model value. This indicated that wire mesh honeycomb could have the higher pressure drop than monolith with the same bed length and hydraulic diameter of channel. For the porous wall of wire mesh honeycomb, it should be taken account of the presence of the convective flow across the bed diameter. The Ergun equation is often used to estimate the pressure drop of a packed bed, and the predicated value is shown in Fig. 9 (b). At low flow rate, the experimentally obtained pressure drops and the calculated value by the Ergun equation had a good agreement. However, the calculated pressure drop is higher than the measured value at high flow rate. For high flow rate (high Re range), the flow through wire mesh honeycomb become turbulent flow from laminar, which could decrease the accuracy of model, as demonstrated by Ko\u0142ldzie and \u0141okewska [18] . In addition, the result indicates that wire mesh honeycomb has a low pressure drop attributed to the high porosity. 3.6 Comparison of ceramic monolith and wire mesh honeycomb catalysts In previous work, it was found that wire mesh honeycomb catalyst had higher catalytic ability than ceramic monolith with the same cell density [11] . Therefore, in this study, the catalytic activity of wire mesh honeycomb catalyst is compared with ceramic monolith catalyst with 400 cpsi, and the results are shown in Fig. 10 . For both catalysts, the amount of the catalytic phase (V 2 O 5 \u2013WO 3 ) was about 10 wt%. It is interesting that although wire mesh honeycomb catalyst has 50 cpsi, it exhibited the similar catalytic activity for NO x to monolith catalyst with 400 cpsi. It is important to evaluate the catalyst performance relative to the catalyst weight and the geometric surface area (GSA) in catalytic application. According to Ahlstr\u00f6m-Silversand and Odenbrand [5] , the \u2212ln(1 \u2212 X )/ S GSA and \u2212 ln ( 1 \u2212 X ) / w c are employed to describe the catalytic performance relative to the geometric surface area and the catalyst weight, and the evaluation parameters for wire mesh honeycomb catalyst and ceramic monolith catalyst are presented in Fig. 11 . The catalyst utilization for wire mesh honeycomb catalyst is obviously better than that for ceramic monolith catalyst, specially, relative to the geometric surface area. This fact is attributed to the excellent mass transfer and the high available surface area between the gas and the catalysts. 4 Conclusions The mass transfer of wire mesh honeycomb catalyst is investigated experimentally by the selective catalytic reduction of NO x with NH 3 . The expression of ( Sh = 1.08 Re 0.5 Sc 1/3 ) is obtained based on the measured data of NO x conversion over wire mesh honeycomb, and it is similar to the packed bed type Sh expression. This Sh expression can predict satisfactorily the mass transfer behavior of wire mesh honeycomb, and the model predictions using a one-dimensional model agree well with the experimental data. Both the experimental and model data confirm the optimum washcoat thickness is 50 \u03bcm in the range from 30 \u03bcm to 70 \u03bcm, and the high cell density of wire mesh honeycomb benefits for NO x removal, which are approved by the studies of the intraporous diffusion and interphase mass transfer. An optimum washcoat thickness for the wire mesh honeycomb catalyst can reduce the effect of diffusion resistance and save the catalysts. The high cell density means the short interphase mass transfer path for reactant from bulk gas to the surface of catalyst. The pressure drop of wire mesh honeycomb is somewhat higher than that of monolith, but it is lower than packed bed, especially at high flow rate. The relatively low pressure drop is attributed to the high porosity of wire mesh honeycomb. Furthermore, compared with ceramic monolith catalyst, wire mesh honeycomb catalyst exhibits the excellent catalytic activity for NOx and high catalyst utilization due to high mass transfer characteristics. The combination of excellent mass transfer characteristics with a low pressure drop makes wire-mesh honeycomb catalysts perspective applied in automotive catalysts, catalytic combustion in energy production and VOCs removal.

        "abstract": "To elucidate the roles of humic acids (HAs) and iron on the environmental fate and transport of organic pollutants in natural water, the interactions of HAs with Fe(III) were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra, Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra and fluorescence spectra, indicating the formation of HAs-Fe(III) complex. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra show *OH radicals are generated and can participate in the photoreaction in solutions containing HAs, Fe(III) and HAs-Fe(III) complex. Under Xe lamp irradiation (lamda >290 nm), the photodegradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), as a kind of herbicide, followed the pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. The pseudo-first-order rate constant of 2,4-D photodegradation with the presence of only 2,4-D (2 mg x L(-1)) was 0.007 h(-1). In the presence of HAs (5 mg x L(-1)), Fe(III) (0.2 mmol x L(-1)) and HAs-Fe(III) complex, the rate constants of 2,4-D degradation were 0.004, 0.034 and 0.046 h(-1), respectively. It was interesting to note that in the existence of HAs, 2,4-D photodegradation was inhibited. While in the presence of Fe(III), 2,4-D photodegradation was enhanced. Furthermore, in the coexistence of HAs and Fe(III), HAs-Fe(III) complex showed better increased effect on the photodegradation of 2,4-D than Fe(III) alone.",

Furthermore, the self-assembled bio-composites exhibit high stability even in saline solution (0.4 M NaCl) and can function as ideal components for real-time assay for screening genotoxic chemicals, not only avoiding the complex layer-by-layer assembly in comparison with those of conventional electrochemistry-based sensors, but also improving the signal transduction. We envision that the stacked-CCG, a novel type of colloidal graphene-derived material, could open new opportunities for the rational design of multifunctional graphene-based biocomposites and provide a brand new avenue in biosensing, drug screening and genotoxicity screening in the future. \u00a9 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

The film obtained after the initial hydrothermal reaction was composed of titanate nanotubes or nanowires by regulating the temperature of hydrothermal treatment. Then both the precursor films were readily transformed into corresponding NAFs (nanoparticles and nanowires) via a secondary hydrothermal treatment with 0.05 M HNO 3 solution at 120 \u00b0C. The NAFs exhibited remarkably high surface photovoltage (SPV) responses and photocurrent densities in UV region, suggesting the enhanced separation ability of photogenerated electrons and holes compared with the compact titania film (CTF) prepared by calcining the TiO 2 sol film. The photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) activities of the NAFs were evaluated using phenol as a test substance under UV light irradiation. The kinetic constants of PEC degradation towards phenol with NAF-nanoparticles and NAF-nanowires were 2.2 and 3.4 times as great as the values with CTF, respectively. A significant PEC synergetic effect between the photocatalytic (PC) and electrochemical (EC) processes was also observed.

        "abstract": "PANI modified core\u2013shell mesoporous TiO 2 (PANI/M-TiO 2 ) with efficient photocatalytic capability under visible light irradiation was fabricated by hydrothermal method and chemisorption approach. The nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption characterization indicated that the specific surface area of mesoporous M-TiO 2 was 2.8 times as great as that of P25, which resulted in the increased uptake of PANI molecule on the surface of M-TiO 2 . Environmental scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images demonstrated that the PANI/M-TiO 2 possessed a unique core\u2013shell structure, which allowed multiple reflection or scattering of light in the photocatalyst and led to the increase of optical path length subsequently. Both the increased uptake of PANI molecules and optical path length in photocatalyst contributed to enhance the visible light absorption. The UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra confirmed that the optical absorption for PANI/M-TiO 2 was more intensive than that for PANI modified TiO 2 nanoparticle (PANI/NP-TiO 2 ) in the visible light region. The intensive visible light absorption and effective charge separation owing to the heterojunction built between TiO 2 and PANI lead to remarkable improvement of visible light photocatalysis. The pseudo-first-order kinetic constant of photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B and 4-chlorophenol under visible light irradiation with 6% PANI/M-TiO 2 was 5.04 and 2.03 times as great as that with PANI/NP-TiO 2 respectively, showing the advantage of the unique core\u2013shell mesoporous structure in the PANI/M-TiO 2 for efficient photocatalysis.",

The experiments were carried out in three reactors operated in parallel: an electric field enhanced ZVI-anaerobic reactor (R1), a ZVI-anaerobic reactor (R2) and a common anaerobic reactor (R3). R1 presented the highest performance in removal of COD and color. Raising voltage in R1 further improved its performance. Scanning electron microscopy images displayed that the structure of granular sludge from R1 was intact after being fed with the high dye concentration, while that of R3 was broken. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis indicated that the abundance of methanogens in R1 was significantly greater than that in the other two reactors. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that the coupling of electric field and ZVI increased the diversity of microbial community and especially enhanced bacterial strains responsible for decolorization.",

What is more, one of the unique features of our synergetic catalyst is that its interface can be reversibly switched from \"inactive\" to \"active\" upon treatment with different ssDNA species in solution, thus providing a powerful and versatile basis for designing graphene/DNA-based label-free colorimetric biosensors. Compared with other signal transduction modes in traditional graphene/aptamer-based systems, our novel signaling strategy not only avoids any labeling or modification procedures but also reduces the background signal due to the \"off-on\" switching mode during the sensing. Furthermore, this facile and general approach can be applicable to the other extended graphene/aptamer-based systems for colorimetric detection of a wide range of analytes. We envision that the tunable graphene-based smart interface could find potential applications in the development of biocatalysis, bioassays, and smart material devices in the future.",

        "abstract": "This study examined phototransformation of \u03b3-hexachlorocyclohexane (\u03b3-HCH) in different solutions. The presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) inhibited the phototransformation of \u03b3-HCH. This phenomenon could be correlated to the binding interaction between \u03b3-HCH and DOM. \u03b1-Fe2O3 promoted the transformation of \u03b3-HCH. The humate-coated \u03b1-Fe2O3 revealed a slight, however significant, favorable effect compared to the bare one. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) offered the direct evidence that humate-coated \u03b1-Fe2O3 could form surface Fe(III)-carboxylate complexes by ligand exchange. Additional experiments demonstrated that the photocorrosion of \u03b1-Fe2O3 coated by DOM was much more acute than that of the bare one. These combined results suggested that the transformation of \u03b3-HCH on humate-coated \u03b1-Fe2O 3 is more related to a surface complex and not to a semiconductor-assisted photoreaction. In the humate-coated \u03b1-Fe 2O3, absorption of a photon results in an excited ligand-to-metal charge-transfer state of the complexes, and a rich variety of free radical reactions ensue, which is concurrently accompanied by the dissolution of the iron oxide. Such reactions may generate reactive transients such as Superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, which may be expected to transform \u03b3-HCH.",

        "abstract": "Chlorinated organic compounds are generally of great concern, but many uncertainties exist regarding how they are generated. To illustrate the possibility of photochemical formation of organochlorine compounds in natural water, the phototransformation of bisphenol A (BPA) in aqueous saline solution containing Fe(lll) and fulvic acid (FA), and in coastal seawater under simulated solar light irradiation was investigated. 2-(3-Chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propane (3-CIBPA) and 2,2-bis(3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl) propane (3,3-diCIBPA) were the main chlorinated derivatives during the processes. Laser flash photolysis (LFP) and electron spin resonance (ESR) results indicated that the chlorination of BPA was most likely due to the formation of Cl2(*-) radical as a consequence of Fe(III) irradiation, yielding Cl* and OH* radical species and finally forming Cl2(*-) radical upon further reaction with chloride. The formation of Fe(III)-FA complex, which is a normal coexistence configuration of Fe(III) and FA in natural water, promoted the BPA chlorination through producing more Cl2(*-) radical. Moreover, FA had two opposite effects: forming Fe(III)-FA complex to enhance Cl2(*-) formation and competing radicals with BPA, which resulted in different overall effects at different concentrations: BPA chlorination was enhanced with the increasing of FA concentration ([FA]) when [FA] < 3.2 mg L(-1); when the concentration of FA was as high as 10 mg L(-1), it slowed down obviously. The described BPA photochlorination process took place from pH 6.3 to 8.5 and increased with the increasing of chloride concentration, indicating it could occur universally in natural saline surface water. These results propose a natural photochemical source for organochlorine compounds.",

        "abstract": "Importance of environmental black carbon (BC) to sorption of dissolved petroleum hydrocarbons (DPH) on two soils with high BC:TOC ratios (33% and 11%, respectively) was evaluated at a relatively high concentrations (mg/L \u223c \u03bcg/L range). Sorption isotherms of DPH were determined for the two original soils and soils combusted at 375\u00b0C (only BC). The sorption isotherms of the original soils were linear, whereas the isotherms of the combusted soils were highly nonlinear (nF = 0.45, 0.60). It is indicated that intrinsic BC-water sorption coefficient is not possible to be used to estimate total sorption to the original soil, even in our relatively high concentrations. From the sorption isotherms, Freundlich coefficient of environmental BC sorption, KF,BCenv of 102.55 \u00b1 0.21 was calculated and could be used as a generic starting point for environmental modeling purposes. From the data, it could be deduced that BC was responsible for 50% of the total sorption at concentrations of 45 and 4 \u03bcg/L (\u03bcg/L range), which were significantly higher than literature concentrations (ng/L range). These results demonstrate that in soil with high BC:TOC ratio BC is the most important geosorbent constituent with respect to sorption of DPH at relatively high concentrations ranged in \u03bcg/L.

The prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra (DRS), respectively. The results indicated that InNbO 4 particles with monoclinic type mainly distributed on the Gr sheet uniformly. The samples had good visible light response. Photocatalytic degradation of Methylene Blue (MB) was conducted under the visible light irradiation (>400nm) in order to evaluate the photoactivity of this photocatalyst. The kinetic constant of MB removal with Gr/InNbO 4 (0.0346min -1) was 1.87 times that with InNbO 4 (0.0185min -1). The enhanced photocatalytic performance of Gr/InNbO 4 was attributed to the improved adsorption performance and the separation efficiency of the carriers. With Gr/InNbO 4 as the photocatalyst the OH radicals be another type of oxidant in the photocatalytic process in addition to holes and electrons on Gr transporting from InNbO 4 participated the oxidation of MB adsorbed on Gr. Overall, the result of this work could provide a new way of the construction of a visible-light-driven photocatalyst with high performance. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

Direct photolysis half-lives for some other PAHs without reported values were predicted. It was concluded from the model that the main factors affecting photolysis half-lives of PAHs under irradiation of sunlight are PAH absolute hardness and electronegativity, which are related to the energy difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and the highest occupied molecular orbital, (Elumo - Ehomo) and (Elumo + Ehomo), respectively. Increasing Ehomo and the average molecular polarizability (alpha) values of the PAHs leads to decrease of photolysis half-lives. Increasing (Elumo - Ehomo) and Elumo values of the PAHs leads to an increase of the PAH photolysis half-lives.",

They are widely distributed in environment and present a potential risk to environment and public health. Thus, it is important to develop effective and feasible methods to remove them from ecosystem. Here, we presented a novel vertically aligned nitrogen-doped nanodiamond (VA-NDD)/Si rod array (RA) electrode with a low hydrogen evolution potential, -1.95V vs Hg/Hg2SO4 electrode, and superior activity for electroreductive debromination of persistent 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47). Over 97% BDE-47 (20mg/L) was electrochemically reduced in 2h at -1.85V with a first-order kinetic constant of 1.93h-1, which was 8.7 times, 4.7 times, 3.5 times and 2.3 times as great as those of boron-doped diamond (BDD)/Si RA, graphite, Pt wafer and Pd film electrodes under the experimental conditions applied. The durability test demonstrated VA-NDD/Si RA electrode was stable and reusable. Furthermore, the intermediates analysis revealed that BDE-47 could be debrominated completely to diphenyl ether. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Graphene (Gr)/InNbO 4 composite with visible light response was fabricated by a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and diffuse reflectance UV\u2013vis spectra (DRS), respectively. The results indicated that InNbO 4 particles with monoclinic type mainly distributed on the Gr sheet uniformly. The samples had good visible light response. Photocatalytic degradation of Methylene Blue (MB) was conducted under the visible light irradiation (>400 nm) in order to evaluate the photoactivity of this photocatalyst. The kinetic constant of MB removal with Gr/InNbO 4 (0.0346 min \u22121 ) was 1.87 times that with InNbO 4 (0.0185 min \u22121 ). The enhanced photocatalytic performance of Gr/InNbO 4 was attributed to the improved adsorption performance and the separation efficiency of the carriers. With Gr/InNbO 4 as the photocatalyst the OH radicals be another type of oxidant in the photocatalytic process in addition to holes and electrons on Gr transporting from InNbO 4 participated the oxidation of MB adsorbed on Gr. Overall, the result of this work could provide a new way of the construction of a visible-light-driven photocatalyst with high performance. Keywords Photocatalysis Visible light InNbO 4 Graphene Adsorption 1 Introduction Heterogeneous photocatalysis is one of the potential approaches for removing organic pollutants mainly attributed to its strong oxidation power, moderate operation temperature, and relative \u201cgreen\u201d final products [1\u20134] . However, this process has limitation in practical applications because of the low quantum yield. Quick charge separation and surface reactions (participated by the electrons and the holes transporting to the surface of the photocatalyst) are the key steps of the photocatalysis. Many efforts have been devoted to improve the efficiency of the charge separation and surface reactions. The way of promoting the charge separation is to facilitate the transportation of holes or electrons by applying an external bias potential to the semiconductor electrode [5] or constructing the heterojunction [6,7] . The strategy of accelerating surface reactions is to enhance the capture quantities of electrons (adsorbed O 2 ) or holes (adsorbed H 2 O, pollutants, surface hydroxyl groups, etc.) by doping Si [8] or supporting photocatalysts with materials which have excellent adsorption ability [9\u201311] . Graphene (Gr) is a novel material that is expected to be a promising electron transporter due to its extremely high electron mobility, good stability, and excellent optic transparency [12,13] . In addition, Gr has great adsorption ability and is expected to be a good choice for adsorbent coated on photocatalyst. Thus, constructing Gr and photocatalyst composite may enhance the photocatalytic performance. Recently, the enhanced photocatalytic performance of Gr/TiO 2 composite was demonstrated [14,15] , which was largely attributed to the great adsorptivity, extended light absorption range, and efficient charge separation properties of the Gr/TiO 2 composite. However, TiO 2 semiconductor has a relatively large band gap of 3.2 eV, which cannot utilize the visible light. As for the composite of Gr and other photocatalyst, it is still unclear if the pollutant adsorbed on the Gr will be degraded on the local site of Gr or in the vicinity of the semiconductor surface. Several complex oxides (e.g. InTaO 4 , BiVO 4 , and Bi 2 WO 6 , etc.) with native small band gap have been under investigation aiming for utilization of visible light [16\u201319] . InNbO 4 is one of the kinds. It was calculated that the conduction band level ( E CB ) of InNbO 4 is \u22120.7 eV vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), and its valence band ( E VB ) level is 1.8 eV vs. NHE [20] . The work function of a free-standing Gr sheet is 4.5 eV [21] , so the Fermi level E F of Gr, which can be calculated by the formula E F = E 0 (vacuum level) \u2212 W (work function), is \u22124.5 eV relative to vacuum level, or 0 eV relative to the NHE. The matching between the energy level of Gr and InNbO 4 makes Gr a good electron acceptor generated by InNbO 4 in Gr/InNbO 4 composite. In this paper, Gr/InNbO 4 composite was prepared by a facile one-step hydrothermal method to improve the photocatalytic activity of visible-light-driven photocatalyst. To our knowledge, few works have been published on the composite of Gr and visible-light-driven photocatalysts, including the preparation and their photocatalytic ability in pollution control. Organic pollutant of Methylene Blue (MB) with cationic group substituting the hydrogen atom of the aromatic ring, which may strengthen the inter force of Gr and aromatic ring, was selected to test the photocatalytic kinetics and mechanism of organics adsorbed on the Gr/InNbO 4 composite. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of the Gr/InNbO 4 powder InNbO 4 powder was prepared by hydrothermal method. In detail, 0.391 g In(NO) 3 \u00b75H 2 O (purchased from Tianjin Jinke Research Institute of Fine Chemical Industry, China) was dissolved in 25 mL deionized water and then was mixed with the NbCl 5 solution, which was made by dissolving 0.270 g NbCl 5 (Aldrich, 99.9+%) in 25 mL deionized water. The pH value of the mixture was adjusted to 3.5 by 5 M NH 3 solution. The mixture was stirred for 0.5 h, and then was sealed in a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and heated at 270 \u00b0C for 24 h under autogenous pressure. After this procedure, the precipitates were filtered, washed with deionized water for three times, and then dried in an oven at 60 \u00b0C for 3 h. The graphite oxide (GO) was produced by the modified Hummer's method. Firstly, 1 g graphite and 23 mL of H 2 SO 4 were mixed vigorously at 0 \u00b0C. Three gram of KMnO 4 was then added slowly to the above solution in 40 min, followed by 60 min of sonication. After this step, the suspended solution was stirred continuously for 1 h, and 46 mL of water was added slowly to the suspension in 15 min. Subsequently, the suspension was diluted by 140 mL of water and 10 mL of H 2 O 2 (30%), and then being separated by centrifugation. The deposition was finally washed with hydrochloric acid (5%), filtered, washed with water, and then dried to obtain GO. Gr/InNbO 4 composite was fabricated by a facile one-step hydrothermal method. Briefly, 500 mg InNbO 4 and 15 mL of 1 mg/mL GO solution were added to deionized water and vigorously stirred for 1 h to get a homogeneous suspension. The suspension was then poured into a 50 mL Teflon-sealed autoclave and heated to 180 \u00b0C for 6 h. After that, the precipitate was filtered, washed with deionized water for three times, and then dried at 60 \u00b0C for 3 h. In addition, Gr was fabricated by the same method without InNbO 4 to serve as control. 2.2 Characterization The morphology of the samples was measured using a transmission electron microscopy (TEM; FEI-Tecnai G 2 F30 S-Twin). The crystal structure of the samples was identified by an X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu LabX XRD-6000) with CuK\u03b1 radiation, accelerating voltage of 40 kV, current of 30 mA and a scanning rate of 0.02\u00b0/s in the 2 \u03b8 range of 20\u201370 \u00b0C. UV\u2013vis absorption spectra of the samples were recorded on a UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (UV 2450 Shimadzu) with a wavelength range of 250\u2013800 nm. Surface photovoltage (SPV) was measured by SPV monitor. XPS of the samples was obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (AMICUS). 2.3 Photocatalytic degradation of MB The photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated by the degradation of MB in a single compartment photo reactor (4 cm \u00d7 5.5 cm \u00d7 7 cm). A 500 W Xe lamp (Shanghai Jiguang Light Company, China) served as the visible light source. The light was passed through a glass filter, which should shield any wavelength above 400 nm. The initial concentrations of MB solution were 5 mg/L. Prior to irradiation, the suspensions were magnetically stirred in dark for about 30 min. At certain time intervals, 3 mL aliquots were sampled and centrifuged to remove the particles. To probe the oxidizing species in the photocatalytic process, the formic acid (FA), a normally used hole scavenger, or tert -butyl alcohol (TBA), an efficient OH radicals quencher was added in the solution. The concentrations of the quenching chemicals were at 1 mM. The concentration of MB was determined by UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (UV-721, Xinmao) at 664 nm. To avoid photosensitization effect, the photocatalytic degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) was also carried out by a same procedure. The concentration of 2,4-DCP was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Waters 2695, Separations module) with a Sunfire\u2122 C18 (5 mm) reverse-phase column equipped with photodiode array detector (Waters 2996). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD Fig. 1 showed the typical XRD pattern of the prepared InNbO 4 and Gr/InNbO 4 powders. The crystal form of the InNbO 4 was identified to the monoclinic type by the diffraction pattern shown in Fig. 1 according to ICDD card No. 33-619 [22] . No characteristic peaks of the other impurities were observed. Compared to InNbO 4 , peaks for Gr were not observed in the diffraction patterns of the Gr/InNbO 4 , which might be due to low amount and relatively low diffraction intensity of Gr. We also observed that the crystal form of the InNbO 4 did not change in the process of Gr loading. 3.2 TEM As shown in Fig. 2 a , the shape of the InNbO 4 particles was regular hexagon and the size of them was about 100 nm in width and 200 nm in length. Gr were thin and big sheets with ripples ( Fig. 2 b), which might be able to provide enough surface area to host InNbO 4 particles. The InNbO 4 particles mainly distributed on the Gr sheet uniformly ( Fig. 2 c), providing enough contacting surface between Gr and InNbO 4 particles and also presumably provide good potential for carrier transport. Fig. 2 d showed the HRTEM images of Gr/InNbO 4 . It was found that the lattice structure of InNbO 4 was in distinctive order and the boundary between the InNbO 4 and Gr was clearly identified. 3.3 DRS It is well known that the optical absorption property, which can exhibit the spectrum range the catalyst can absorb and excite the catalyst to generate the hole and electron, is the key factor in determining the photocatalytic performance of the catalyst [23] . The UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra of InNbO 4 and Gr/InNbO 4 were illustrated in Fig. 3 . The InNbO 4 showed good absorption in the visible light region. Compared with that of InNbO 4 , there was no obvious red shift of the absorption edge of Gr/InNbO 4 . The result suggested that the abilities of absorbing the visible light between Gr/InNbO 4 and InNbO 4 were generally same. In an earlier publication, a decrease in band gap energy was observed for Gr/TiO 2 composite due to the formation of the Ti\u2013O\u2013C bond [14] . From the result of the DRS, we proposed that most of the carbon in the Gr/InNbO 4 were \u201cfree\u201d. This speculation was certified by the XPS spectra of InNbO 4 and Gr/InNbO 4 . There were no obvious shift in binding energy of the peaks which was attributed to the In 3d , Nb 3d and O 1s between InNbO 4 and Gr/InNbO 4 . The result showed that the environment of the In 3d , Nb 3d and O 1s in InNbO 4 and Gr/InNbO 4 were nearly same. Thus, our results suggested that the carbon in the Gr/InNbO 4 had minimum effect on the InNbO 4 . 3.4 Photocatalytic degradation of MB and 2,4-DCP The photocatalytic activities of InNbO 4 and Gr/InNbO 4 were evaluated by photocatalytic degradation of MB under visible light illumination. Fig. 4 illustrated the C t / C 0 vs. reaction time for the degradation of MB and UV\u2013vis spectra of MB with Gr/InNbO 4 as the photocatalyst. The degradation rate of MB by direct photolysis was 14.9% in 90 min, indicating that MB could be degraded under visible light illumination. The elimination efficiency of MB with Gr/InNbO 4 was 97.6% in 90 min, higher than that the efficiency with InNbO 4 (only 83.4%). It was found that the degradation of MB by photolysis and the photocatalytic elimination of MB with InNbO 4 and Gr/InNbO 4 followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics by the formula (1) . (1) ln C t C 0 = \u2212 k t In the above equation, k is kinetic constant. The k of MB removal in the photocatalytic process with InNbO 4 was 0.0185 min \u22121 , which was largely enhanced compared to that in the process of direct photolysis (0.00201 min \u22121 ), showing InNbO 4 had good visible-light-driven photocatalytic performance. The k of MB removal with Gr/InNbO 4 (0.0346 min \u22121 ) was 1.87 times that with InNbO 4 . The result implied that coating Gr on InNbO 4 could enhance the photocatalytic performance of InNbO 4 . In order to exclude photosensitized effect in the photocatalytic process, the photodegradation of 2,4-DCP over InNbO 4 and Gr/InNbO 4 composite under visible light irradiation was performed ( Fig. 5 ). The direct photolysis of 2,4-DCP served as control and 6.7% of 2,4-DCP was eliminated in the direct photolysis during 60 min illumination. Compared with that in the direct photolysis, the removal rate of 2,4-DCP in photocatalytic process was largely enhanced, which was 81.5% with InNbO 4 and 98.1% with Gr/InNbO 4 , indicating that InNbO 4 could be excited by visible light and degrade the pollutant with no absorption in visible light range. The k of 2,4-DCP removal with Gr/InNbO 4 (0.0538 min \u22121 ) was 2.10 times that with InNbO 4 (0.0256 min \u22121 ), showing that coating Gr on InNbO 4 could enhance the photocatalytic performance of InNbO 4 . This result was further certified the conclusion obtained in the photocatalytic process of MB. 3.5 Mechanism on enhancement of photocatalytic activity One possible reason for the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the Gr/InNbO 4 could be the synergistic role of Gr due to the charge transfer process between Gr and InNbO 4 . We have measured the SPV of the InNbO 4 and the Gr/InNbO 4 (shown in Fig. 6 ), which is one of many indexes evaluating the separation efficiency of the photogenerated carries [24,25] . It was found that the SPV of the Gr/InNbO 4 was obviously larger than that of InNbO 4 indicating that the introduction of Gr would improve the separation efficiency of the carriers generated in InNbO 4 . The result was attributed to the key fact that the E F is negative than the E CB of InNbO 4 . When Gr/InNbO 4 was illuminated by visible light, the InNbO 4 was excited and photogenerated electrons would transfer from the conduction band of InNbO 4 to Gr. Thus, Gr served as an acceptor of the generated electrons of InNbO 4 and effectively suppressed the charge recombination, leaving more charge carriers to participate the oxidation reaction and promote the degradation of MB. Adsorption performance of the targeted substance is very important for the surface reaction. To evaluate the adsorption ability of InNbO 4 and Gr/InNbO 4 , the residue rate of MB after 30 min stirring in the dark was determined. The residue rate of MB in the solution with InNbO 4 as the adsorbent was 89.5%, whereas that of Gr/InNbO 4 as the adsorbent was 80.7%. It was obviously that the adsorption ability of the InNbO 4 was enhanced by introduction of Gr, which is a prequisite for good photocatalytic activity [14,26] . A number of diagnostic experiments were conducted to understand the mechanism for MB degradation with InNbO 4 . The experimental results are shown in Fig. 7 . FA, a commonly used scavenger of holes was added in the solution to explore if holes participated in the degradation of the MB. In our experiments, the degradation of MB was almost terminated indicating the hole was the major role in oxidation of MB either as the oxidizing agent or the origination of OH radicals. In order to further identify the role of OH radicals in the MB degradation, TBA, an efficient OH radicals quencher was added into the solution. In the presence of TBA, the degradation of MB was not quenched obviously. From the above discussion we propose that the oxidation of MB with InNbO 4 as the photocatalyst was mainly attributed to holes. The similar experiments were done in the photocatalytic process with Gr/InNbO 4 , as illustrated in Fig. 8 . In the presence of FA and TBA, the eliminations of MB were decelerated, showing the holes and OH radicals all contributed to the oxidation of MB at the same time. Compared with InNbO 4 , another type of the oxidizing species ( OH radicals) in photocatalytic process with Gr/InNbO 4 was found. To judge if the electrons on Gr transporting from InNbO 4 is the origination of OH radicals which participated the oxidation of MB, molecular oxygen which generates OH by the capturing reaction of electrons was pumped into the solution. In the O 2 -staturated aqueous solution, the degradation of MB was enhanced significantly. The enhancement can be explained on the basis of the hypothesis that more O 2 molecules scavenged more electrons with consequently producing more OH radicals. This observation implied that electrons on Gr were responsible for the generation of the OH radicals, which then oxidized the MB. These OH radicals would give a preferential degradation of the MB adsorbed on the Gr which was in the vicinity to them. The collective observations implied that with Gr/InNbO 4 as the photocatalyst the OH radicals be another type of oxidant in the photocatalytic process in addition to holes and electrons on Gr transporting from InNbO 4 participated the oxidation of MB adsorbed on Gr by producing OH radicals. Based on the experimental results, a schematic mechanism for the MB degradation with Gr/InNbO 4 as the photocatalyst was illustrated in Scheme 1 . As irradiated, the InNbO 4 particles were excited and generated holes and electrons. Due to the matching between the energy level of Gr and InNbO 4 , the exited electrons quickly transported to Gr and then reacted with adsorbed O 2 on the Gr to produce OH radicals which oxidized the MB adsorbed on Gr at last. Meanwhile, holes left on InNbO 4 surfaces participated the degradation of MB either by direct oxidation or by OH radicals produced in the reaction of holes and its scavengers. 4 Conclusions Gr/InNbO 4 composite with visible light response was fabricated by a facile one-step hydrothermal method and its photocatalytic performance was tested by MB degradation under visible light irradiation. Compared to InNbO 4 , the enhancement of photocatalytic capability was achieved which was attributed to the enhanced adsorption performance and facilitated separation of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, with Gr/InNbO 4 as the photocatalyst the OH radicals was another type of oxidant in addition to holes and electrons on Gr transporting from InNbO 4 participated the oxidation of MB adsorbed on Gr. We believe that the construction of composite of Gr and photocatalysts with the visible light response and the detailed mechanism discussion in this work will open up new perspectives on development of highly efficient photocatalysts for environmental remediation technology.

        "abstract": "A novel V 2O 5/WO 3/TiO 2/Al 2O 3/wire-mesh honeycomb (WMH) catalyst was prepared for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO x with NH 3. The resistances to H 2O, SO 2, and dust were investigated for the WMH catalyst, which were compared with those for ceramic honeycomb (CH) catalysts. The results showed that the WMH catalyst kept above 95% NO x conversion in the broad temperature window (250-425 \u00b0C) and provided nearly 92% NO x conversion during H 2O and SO 2 durability test, which might be attributed to the unique three-dimensional structure. Furthermore, the WMH catalyst could provide nearly 90% NO x conversion during 40 h dust exposure experiment owing to the little dust deposition of 2.9 g/m 2, whereas the amount of dust deposited on the CH catalyst with the same cell density reached 6.7 g/m 2, which resulted in a decrease of the NO x conversion from 72% to 58%. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "A zero valent iron (ZVI) bed with a pair of electrodes was installed in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor to create an enhanced condition to increase the rate of anaerobic granulation. The effects of an electric field and ZVI on granulation were investigated in three UASB reactors operated in parallel: an electric field enhanced ZVI-UASB reactor (reactor R1), a ZVI-UASB reactor (reactor R2) and a common UASB reactor (reactor R3). When a voltage of 1.4 V was supplied to reactor R1, COD removal dramatically increased from 60.3% to 90.7% over the following four days, while the mean granule size rapidly grew from 151.4 \u03bcm to 695.1 \u03bcm over the following 38 days. Comparatively, COD removal was lower and the increase in granule size was slower in the other two reactors (in the order: R1 > R2 > R3). The electric field caused the ZVI to more effectively buffer acidity and maintain a relatively low oxidation-reduction potential in the reactor. In addition, the electric field resulted in a significant increase in ferrous ion leaching and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production. These changes benefited methanogenesis and granulation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that different microorganisms were dominant in the external and internal layers of the reactor R1 granules. Additionally, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis indicated that the relative abundance of methanogens in reactor R1 was significantly greater than in the other two reactors. Taken together, these results suggested that the use of ZVI combined with an electric field in an UASB reactor could effectively enhance the sludge granulation.",

        "abstract": "A facile, rapid, stable and sensitive approach for fluorescent detection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is designed based on DNA ligase reaction and \u03c0-stacking between the graphene and the nucleotide bases. In the presence of perfectly matched DNA, DNA ligase can catalyze the linkage of fluorescein amidite-labeled single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and a phosphorylated ssDNA, and thus the formation of a stable duplex in high yield. However, the catalytic reaction cannot effectively carry out with one-base mismatched DNA target. In this case, we add graphene to the system in order to produce different quenching signals due to its different adsorption affinity for ssDNA and double-stranded DNA. Taking advantage of the unique surface property of graphene and the high discriminability of DNA ligase, the proposed protocol exhibits good performance in SNP genotyping. The results indicate that it is possible to accurately determine SNP with frequency as low as 2.6% within 40 min.

        "title": "Fabrication of photocatalytic membrane and evaluation its efficiency in removal of organic pollutants from water",
        "abstract": "TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membranes with photocatalytic capability have been successfully prepared from colloidal titania sols by the sol\u2013gel technique. Pore sizes of the resulting membrane were mainly controlled by the sol properties and the immersion time. A preliminary investigation of the sol\u2013gel process, the membrane characterization and the stability of composite membrane were carried out using IR-spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results proved that TiO 2 immobilized on the support of Al 2 O 3 had anatase crystal structure in the calcination temperature range. Direct Black168 was used as the test pollutant for investigation of the multifunctions of photocatalysis and separation of TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membrane. Some operational parameters such as the pressure in the membrane cell, the initial pH and air flow were determined and the influence of various parameters was also discussed to obtain high reaction rates, high membrane rejection and operating stability. The removal of Direct Black168 with UV irradiation alone achieved 70% and the retention of the dye with membrane filtration alone reached 65% after 300 min in the continuous system. By combining the photocatalysis with membrane techniques, the removal efficiency of the dye was improved markedly and reached 82% after 300 min. Although the dye was not completely decomposed by photocatalysis, the degradation of the dye helped to enhance the composite membrane flux and prevent membrane fouling. It was possible to treat successfully Direct Black168 solutions (100 mg/L) by means of a continuous process obtaining good values of permeate fluxes (82 L/m 2 h). The TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membrane with photocatalytic function could be interesting for water purification. Keywords Composite membranes Titania sols Photocatalysis and separation Membrane rejection Permeate fluxes 1 Introduction Nowadays water pollution, caused by hazardous organic chemicals used in industry and agriculture, is a very serious problem. Food, pharmaceutical, pesticides, the textile dyeing and finishing industry produces large volumes of discharge effluent and is considered as one of the major industrial pollutants [1\u20133] . These effluents are usually treated by physicochemical, oxidative or, most commonly, active sludge biochemical processes [4,5] . The main drawback of the above processes is that they generally produce secondary pollution due to the introduction of chemicals and/or the possible accumulation of other bio-resistant species in the environment. As a new method, membrane separation processes have been studied in order to reuse waste water derived from many fields by means of nano and ultrafiltration of discharge effluent [6\u20138] or they have been coupled with other technologies as for instance the ozonation [9] . Membrane separation processes have already shown to be competitive with other separation processes for what concerns energy costs, material recovery, reduction of the environmental impact and achievement of integrated processes with selective removal of some components [10,11] . However, this technique only transfers pollutants from a phase to another and only displays a simple separation function. Photocatalytic reactions allow in many cases a complete degradation of organic pollutants in very small and innoxious species, without using chemicals, avoiding sludge production and its disposal. Over the past several years TiO 2 nanostructures have become a focus of considerable interest because they possess unique properties relevant to applications including chemical sensing [12] , photocatalysis [13] and photovoltaics [14] . TiO 2 photocatalysis proves to be a promising technology for purification and treatment of both contaminated air and water [15] . Chen et al. have reported a novel TiO 2 \u2013based p\u2013n junction nanotube photocalyst, which shows excellent photoactivity [16] . Some multicomponent or mixed oxides such as SrTiO 3 , BaTiO 3 , TiO 2 /ZrO 2 , K 2 La 2 TiO 3 , Ni 2 O 3 /TiO 2 \u2212 x B x , ZnO\u2013ZnS and silica\u2013titania have good photoactivity [17\u201323] . In particular, TiO 2 in the crystalline form of anatase has been widely used due to its low cost, its photostability and to the fact that it is not a noxious chemical. Although TiO 2 is known to be an excellent photocatalyst for removal of organic contaminants, the separation of TiO 2 particles creates another problem to be solved in practical applications of the process [24] . A major difficulty in the separation of TiO 2 particles from treated water arises because TiO 2 particles are too fine to be removed by gravity settling. Recently, some attempts have been made to effectively separate TiO 2 photocatalysts, for example, by coagulation, membrane separation, etc. [25,26] . The coagulation method also has another problem related to the production of chemical sludge that must be disposed. The membrane separation may increase the treatment cost in practical applications of the process. Another investigator tried to use a photocatalytic membrane reactor for degradation of toxic organic species such as 4-nitrophenol while immobilizing TiO 2 particles on different flat polymeric membranes by means of ultrafiltration [27] . Almost complete degradation of the organic pollutant was achieved after 5 h irradiation, but the membranes used were slightly damaged by UV irradiation depending on the membrane materials. This study explored the feasibility of combining the photocatalytic with membrane techniques for removal of organic pollutants. Therefore, we prepared successfully TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membranes with photocatalytic capability by sol\u2013gel technique. It is foreseen that the TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membrane may have the multifunctions of separation and photocatalysis simultaneously and this kind of composite membrane may play an important role in photocatalytic reaction and separation process. In a word, the aim of this work is to understand this behaviour and to improve the performance of the composite membrane with photocatalytic function in order to take advantage of the benefits of both the photocatalytic and membrane technology for pollutants treatment. In this paper, Direct Black168 [28] was used as the test pollutant. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and reagents Tetra- n -butyl titanate ([CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 O] 4 Ti) was analytical reagent grade and obtained from Shanghai Reagent Company. Ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH), acetic acid (CH 3 COOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl), H 2 O 2 and other chemicals were AR grade and all obtained from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagents Development Centre. The high-purity water used in the experiment was double distilled and then purified with the Milli-Q system. The substrate of Direct Black168 dye was obtained from Shanghai Dyestuff Chemical Plant and used without further purification. Table 1 shows the properties of Direct Black168 and Fig. 1 displays its molecular structure. The alumina template membranes with 200 nm diameter pores were obtained commercially (Whatman Anopore filters, Fisher, Anodisc 47). 2.2 Preparation of TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membranes TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membranes were prepared using sol\u2013gel method. Tetra- n -butyl titanate (5.0 mL) was added to 25 mL of ethanol, and the resulting solution was stirred in an ice bath. To a second 25 mL portion of ethanol were added 0.5 mL of water and 1.5 mL of acetic acid. The tetra- n -butyl titanate solution was removed from the ice bath and the ethanol/acetic acid/water solution was slowly added. Unless otherwise noted, the temperature was maintained at 20 \u00b0C. The resulting alkoxide was kept standing at 20 \u00b0C for hydrolysis reaction for 30 min, and then was irradiated with an ultrasonic cleaning bath for 10 min, resulting in the transparent TiO 2 sol. The alumina template membrane was immediately dipped into this solution for a certain immersion time. After the desired immersion time, the membrane was removed from the sol and dried in air for 1 h at room temperature. The composite membranes were then placed in a muffle furnace. The temperature was ramped to 400 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0C/h) and kept for 6 h, and then ramped back down (50 \u00b0C/h) to the room temperature. 2.3 Instruments and analysis methods The morphology of TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membranes was observed using scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-5600LV, Oxford, UK). The phases and structures of samples were identified by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, LabX-6000, Shimadzu, Japan) employing Cu K\u03b1 radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA over the 2 \u03b8 range of 20\u2013100\u00b0. IR-spectra of dried TiO 2 sol samples were measured to investigate structural information and specific molecule-groups information (IR Prestige-21, Fourier Transform Spectrophotometer, Shimadzu, Japan). Concentration of Direct Black168 was measured by UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (JASCO V-550, Japan). The pH value was controlled by acidimeter (Basic pH Meter PB-20, Sartorius, Germany). 2.4 Membrane permeation, rejection and photocatalytic experiments The experiment of photocatalytic reaction was conducted in static system and continuous system, respectively. In static experiment, 100 mL of 50 mg/L Direct Black168 dye solution was used, and the temperature was maintained at room temperature. At given reaction interval, a 3 mL of sample was withdrawn, analyzed with a spectrophotometer at 610 nm and returned quickly. For dark reaction, the experiment was carried out in darkness. Continuous run experiment was conducted using a peristaltic pump and 1000 mL of 100 mg/L Direct Black168 was used. Composite membrane permeation and rejection experiments were performed using a vacuum pump. When the photocatalytic reaction was performed, a 300 W high-pressure mercury lamp with a characteristic wavelength of 365 nm was used as UV source, which was surrounded by quartz cooling thimble (25 mm diameter). The lamp was placed upper the reactor and the distance between its bulb and the surface of the photocatalytic membrane was 10 cm; the light intensity at this distance was 400 \u03bcW cm \u22122 . During the experiment, air was bubbled into the solution using an inorganic ceramic microfiltration membrane (inside diameter = 8 mm, length = 50 mm, average pore diameter = 0.2 \u03bcm) in continuous run experiment and porous capillary was used to dissolve air into the solution in static experiment. In fact, inorganic ceramic microfiltration membrane and porous capillary were able to maximize exchange surface in order to achieve optimal air dissolution into solution by means of microbubble formation. Direct Black168 solution was stirred by air bubbling in darkness for 30 min to establish adsorption\u2013desorption equilibrium before the experiments started. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Investigation of the sol\u2013gel process and membrane characterization 3.1.1 IR-spectroscopic investigations Fig. 2 shows the IR-spectra (KBr pellets method) of dried TiO 2 sol sintered at different temperatures in the range from 100 to 400 \u00b0C. The spectra of the samples treated up to 200 \u00b0C exhibit only slight differences. The high-frequency part of the spectra is dominated by the OH stretching (3100\u20133500 cm \u22121 ) and bending (1640 cm \u22121 ) of water [29,30] . The deformation modes of CH-stretching modes of alcohol groups from the alkoxide appeared in the range between 1300 and 1500 cm \u22121 [31] . The band at wave number near to 1100 cm \u22121 can be attributed to Ti(O\u2013C)-streching vibration [32] . This clearly indicates that in spite of gelation and drying of the TiO 2 sol samples, some hydroxyl group (\u2013OH) remained in coordination with the Ti-atom. Heat treatment of the gel at 300 \u00b0C leads to the decomposition of the alkoxide\u2013additive complex and the formation of Ti\u2013O group at 500\u2013520 cm \u22121 [33] . The bands in the high-frequency range (3100\u20133500 cm \u22121 ) and between 1300 and 1700 cm \u22121 vanished nearly. It can be seen from the IR-spectra that organic groups are few at 400 \u00b0C, which was due to the combustion and carbonization of organic materials at this temperature. 3.1.2 XRD analysis Fig. 3 shows X-ray diffraction patterns of composite membrane samples at various calcination temperatures by sol\u2013gel technique. In comparison with the XRD pattern of the standard anatase crystalline TiO 2 , the prepared composite membrane (at 400 \u00b0C) had already formed anatase crystal structure due to the presence of attributive peaks (2 \u03b8 = 25.4, 38.0, 47.8, 54.6\u00b0). As shown, anatase TiO 2 single phase was considerably obvious at 300 \u00b0C. As calcination temperature increased, the peak intensity as well as the number of peaks correspondingly increased which further indicated the transformation of the TiO 2 of amorphous to polycrystalline nature together with the presence of mixed phase. The corresponding crystal-type of TiO 2 was dominantly anatase-phase from 300 to 500 \u00b0C, which was very beneficial for photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminations [34] . In the following photocatalytic experiment, the TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membranes calcinated in air at 400 \u00b0C were used as photocatalytic membrane. The percentage of anatase and rutile of TiO 2 are 86% and 14% at 400 \u00b0C, respectively. The above results are in agreement with IR-spectra of dried TiO 2 sol sintered at different temperatures. 3.1.3 Electron microscopy Fig. 4 a shows surface micrograph of TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membrane with immersion time for 30 min. As shown, there are many fine and uniform pores in the composite membranes. The pore size is about 50\u2013100 nm. In order to investigate TiO 2 tubules microstructures in the inside of composite membrane, surface TiO 2 layer of the composite membrane was removed by sand paper. The surface TiO 2 layer could endure strong basic solution and therefore inhibited the dissolution of Al 2 O 3 support. Then the membrane was glued to a piece of filter paper with the polished face up. The resulting composite was immersed into 6 mol/L NaOH solution for 5 min at 50 \u00b0C to dissolve the alumina, and then rinsed with 1 mol/L HCl and deionized water sequently. Fig. 4 b shows SEM image of TiO 2 tubules in the alumina membrane. It can be seen from Fig. 4 b that the TiO 2 tubules were about 50 \u03bcm long (the thickness of the alumina membrane) and had outside diameters of 200 nm (the diameter of the pores). Fig. 4 c shows cross section SEM image of TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membrane with immersion time for 30 min. As shown, the thickness of composite membrane is about 50 \u03bcm. Surface TiO 2 layer of composite membrane could not be observed obviously from the SEM image of cross section. The reason is that the surface TiO 2 layer may be very thin. TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membrane with photocatalytic capability after 180 min UV irradiation and membrane filtration was investigated using SEM ( Fig. 4 d). As shown, the TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membrane has coarse surface microstructure after being used six times. The reason is that Direct Black168 and its photodegradation products coated on the surface of composite membrane. Many fine and uniform pores in the composite membranes could still be observed after being used six times, but a sign of more and more large pores was shown, which may be owing to the dissolution of TiO 2 microstructure. 3.1.4 Membrane permeation and rejection All permeation and rejection measurements were evaluated using the membrane test unit. The test solution was pumped from a solution reservoir through the membrane cell and back to the reservoir. Permeate and retentate were recycled. The temperature of the system was kept at 298 K. The flow velocity through test cell was kept constant at 12.7 L/h. Fig. 5 shows deionized water permeation flux as a function of time at different pressure difference. As shown, in the studied pressure difference range, the initial deionized water permeation flux increases with increase of pressure difference. However, the flux attenuation becomes more and more rapid with increase of pressure difference. In particular, the deionized water permeation flux reduces almost 80% after 30 min at pressure difference of 0.10 MPa. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the deionized water permeation flux is almost steady at different pressure difference after 30 min filtration. Moreover, the steady permeation flux increases also as pressure difference increases. The above results indicate that there is a critical pressure during the process of membrane filtration. The driving force in the membrane filtration increases faster than the resistance in the membrane filtration under critical pressure. The driving force and the resistance in the membrane filtration is produced by the increase of pressure difference. If the pressure difference is beyond critical pressure, the increase trend of permeation flux should become slow. Membrane rejection was determined using Direct Black168 solutions. Fig. 6 shows Direct Black168 steady retention of TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membrane at different pH. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the optimal pH was about 3.5, and the Direct Black168 retention above pH 4.0 decreased with pH increasing. The reason is that surface of TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membrane is positively charged at acid solutions. Usually, anionic dye is more easily adsorbed by composite membrane than cationic dye. The surface state of composite membrane at different pH has great effect on adsorption of the dye on composite membrane. The surface state of composite membrane may change or damage under strong acidic conditions. Therefore, Direct Black168 retention decreased below pH 3.5. At the optimal pH, TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membrane obviously possessed better adsorption capacity, and therefore, the retention of Direct Black168 was relatively high. The results of Direct Black168 steady permeation flux at different pH are also in agreement with above conclusions. At pH 3.5, the permeation flux (after 60 min) of Direct Black168 is lower (82 L/m 2 h) than above or below pH 3.5, and but the retention is relatively high (60%) at this pH ( Fig. 7 ). 3.2 Photocatalytic activity 3.2.1 Static experiments Direct Black168 in water has a strong absorption peak at 610 nm and it is quite stable to the irradiation even with UV light at \u03bb max = 365 nm ( Fig. 8 a ). When TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membrane ( Fig. 8 d) was used as photocatalytic membrane, the dye can be decomposed under UV irradiation, as indicated by the decrease in the absorbance at 610 nm ( Fig. 9 ). The removal of Direct Black168 achieved 63% after 180 min UV irradiation. H 2 O 2 was also added to reaction system, and the aim is to enhance photocatalytic efficiency. Fig. 8 c shows that Direct Black168 was degraded under UV irradiation when H 2 O 2 was added to reaction system. The relative efficiency of the processes shown in Fig. 8 can be summarized in the order of H 2 O 2 \u2013TiO 2 membrane-UV > TiO 2 membrane-UV > H 2 O 2 -UV > H 2 O 2 -dark > UV. Fig. 10 shows that the relationship of \u2212ln C / C o over time is linear ( C : the concentration of Direct Black168; C o : the original concentration). The linearity suggests the degradation of Direct Black168 follows pseudo-first-order dynamics in the studied concentration range. The reaction ratio constant was observed to obey the following order: 0.01184 min \u22121 (H 2 O 2 \u2013TiO 2 membrane-UV) > 0.00707 min \u22121 (TiO 2 membrane-UV) > 0.00425 min \u22121 (H 2 O 2 -UV). The above results illuminated that TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membranes obviously show much better photoactivity. According to the principle of photocatalysis, the photoactivity mainly dependent on three factors [35] : (I) electron\u2013hole generation capacity; (II) separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons; (III) transfer efficiency of electrons to surrounding supports or compounds adsorbed on photocatalyst matrix. The degradation mechanism appears to be the reaction of the dye substrate with some reactive species such as HO radicals formed in each process. It has been known that H 2 O 2 irradiated with the UV light at \u03bb \u2264 370 nm produces the HO radicals and HO can oxidize dye molecules (Eq. (1) ). In addition, dye solution decolorization occurs through direct electron (e \u2212 ) transfer from the TiO 2 surface to the dye molecule [2,36] , as shown by Eq. (2) . Direct oxidation by reaction with holes (h + ) has also been reported by Houas et al. [37] , as shown by Eq. (3) : (1) Dye + OH \u2192 Dye \u2212 + H 2 O \u2192 degradation products (2) Dye + e \u2212 \u2192 Dye \u2212 \u2192 degradation products (3) Dye + h + \u2192 Dye + \u2192 degradation products Haarstrick et al. [38] reported that oxygen is the key molecule for hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) formation and accelerates photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. Oxygen is well known for scavenging the photogenerated electrons (Eq. (4) ), impeding the hole\u2013electron pair recombination process (Eq. (5) ) and freeing up the photogenerated holes for further reactions. Thus, sufficient oxygen is important for successful and efficient photocatalysis. In our experiment, air was bubbled simply into the solution. It had two important functions: supplied oxygen and stirred solution. Air flow, during the process of photocatalytic reaction, has been studied ( Fig. 11 ). As shown, the efficiency of photocatalytic reaction increases as air flow increases. However, the photocatalytic efficiency is very close at air flow of 0.5 and 0.8 L min \u22121 . This may be attributed to two aspects. One is that oxygen is sufficient for photocatalytic reaction at air flow of 0.5 L min \u22121 . Therefore, excessive air (0.8 L min \u22121 ) cannot improve photocatalytic efficiency. The other reason is that a great deal of air bubble produced at 0.8 L min \u22121 , which may affect photoabsorption on the surface of TiO 2 and less photo reaches the photocatalyst surface, resulting in slower photocatalytic reaction. (4) O 2 + e \u2212 \u2192 O 2 \u2212 (5) e \u2212 + h + \u2192 heat 3.2.2 Continuous experiments It was possible to treat successfully highly concentrated dye solutions using photocatalysis coupled with membrane technology. Therefore, removal of Direct Black168 was also tested in the continuous system. For this system, the following experimental conditions were used, i.e. 1000 mL of aqueous solution containing the dye Direct Black168 (100 mg/L) at 298 K and pressure difference of 0.05 MPa; air flow 1.0 L min \u22121 ; initial pH 3.5; in the experiment, the lamp was switched on after 30 min of mixing and running in darkness (to allow the saturation of the dispersion with oxygen and the achievement of steady-state conditions for the adsorption phenomena). Fig. 12 a and b shows the results of Direct Black168 in the retentate and in the permeate in the absence of UV light, respectively. The concentration of Direct Black168 in the retentate remained almost constant throughout the run, and only a small increase was observed after 300 min. The TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membrane had an average rejection of 60% at steady-state conditions, but the concentration of Direct Black168 in the permeate depended on the history of the run. By continuing the run without interruptions, a decrease of the concentration of Direct Black168 of the permeate was observed reaching a rejection equal to 65% after 300 min. Fig. 12 c and d shows the results of Direct Black168 in the retentate and in the permeate under UV irradiation, respectively. The concentration of Direct Black168 in the retentate decreased with irradiation time. It means that photodegradation reaction occurred under UV irradiation. The concentration of Direct Black168 in the permeate under UV irradiation is lower than that of dye in the permeate without UV irradiation. By combining the photocatalysis with membrane techniques, the removal efficiency of the dye was improved markedly and reached 82% after 300 min. Although the dye was not completely decomposed by photocatalysis, the degradation of the dye helped to enhance composite membrane flux and prevent membrane pollution. At the same time, we can also find that the continuous filtration at a given pressure difference can enhance Direct Black168 adsorption on the surface of composite membrane. The adsorption of pollutants on photocatalyst is an important factor of heterogenous phtocatalytic reaction. 4 Conclusions TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membranes were prepared using sol\u2013gel technique. Pore sizes of the resulting membrane were mainly controlled by the sol properties and the immersion time. With the aid of IR-spectra, XRD, SEM, the morphology, microstructure, chemical features of the sol\u2013gel process and the composite membranes were investigated. The results proved that the TiO 2 immobilized on the support of Al 2 O 3 had anatase crystal structure in the calcination temperature range. It is very beneficial for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. The TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membranes can be used for photocatalytic reactions and show better photocatalytic activity. The pH has a great effect on adsorption property of Direct Black168 on TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membrane. At optimal pH, the retention of Direct Black168 reached 65% after 300 min and moreover good values of permeate fluxes (82 L/m 2 h) was obtained. Good adsorption property great contributed its high photocatalytic activity. By coupling photocatalysis with membrane separation techniques, the removal efficiency of Direct Black168 was improved markedly and achieved 82% after 300 min in the continuous system. In a summary, according to our research, the TiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 composite membranes have the multifunctions of photocatalysis and separation simultaneously. The use of the two techniques in a single device can boost the efficiency without increasing in excess the complexity of the process. Moreover, coupling the photocatalysis and membrane techniques result a very powerful process with a great innovation in water purification. Such an innovation has important significance in exploring a new efficient method to solve water pollution problem.

The degradation efficiencies increased from 63 to 100% under UV light, and 79-100% under visible light (lambda>400 nm), compared with TiO2 nanotube array electrode. The enhanced PEC activity of SA-modified TiO2 nanotube array electrode was attributed to the amount of surface hydroxyl groups introduced by SA-modification and the extension of absorption wavelength range.",

Nitrobenzene (NB) was chosen as the probe compound to investigate the material's electro-reduction activity. The effects of potential, electrolyte concentration and pH on NB reduction and aniline (AN) formation efficiencies were studied. NDD exhibited high electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for reduction of NB to AN. The NB removal efficiency and AN formation efficiency were 96.5% and 88.4% under optimal conditions, respectively; these values were 1.13 and 3.38 times higher than those of graphite electrodes. Coulombic efficiencies for NB removal and AN formation were 27.7% and 26.1%, respectively; these values were 4.70 and 16.6 times higher than those of graphite electrodes under identical conditions.

We expected that the photocatalytic capability of this hybrid photocatalyst could be enhanced by the efficient visible light absorption owing to the photonic crystal structure and effective charge separation owing to the unique heterojunction built between TiO 2 and P3HT. The bilayer TiO2/P3HT photocatalyst was prepared first by depositing inverse TiO2 opal on FTO substrate via replicating polystyrene opal, followed by spin coating a layer of TiO 2 nanoparticles on the inverse TiO2 opal. The as prepared bilayer TiO2 was modified by P3HT via dipping method. Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) images demonstrated that the as prepared photocatalyst was composed of inverse TiO2 opal layer and TiO 2 nanoparticles layer. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra showed that the optical absorption for bilayer TiO2/P3HT was more intensive than for pristine TiO2 nanoparticle/P3HT (NP-TiO2/P3HT) in the range of 400-650 nm. The enhanced generation of photocurrent under visible light irradiation (\u03b3 > 400 nm) was observed using the bilayer TiO 2/P3HT. The results of photocatalytic experiments under visible light irradiation revealed that the pseudofirst-order kinetic constant of photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue using the bilayer TiO 2/P3HT was 2.08 times as great as that using NP-TiO2/P3HT, showing the advantage of the unique structure in the bilayer TiO 2/P3HT for efficient photocatalysis. \u00a9 2010 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), which are considered to be promising candidates for the adsorption of toxic organics, are released into aqueous environment with their increasing production and application. In this study, the adsorption behaviors of five structurally related ionizable organic contaminants namely perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 4-n-nonylphenol (4-NP) onto MWNTs with different oxygen contents (3.84-22.85%) were investigated. The adsorption kinetics was investigated and simulated with pseudo-second-order model. The adsorption isotherms were found to be fitted with Freundlich model and influenced by both the properties of organic chemicals and the oxygen contents of MWNTs. As adsorption capacity decreases dramatically with the increasing of oxygen contents, the MWNTs with the lowest oxygen contents possess the highest adsorption capacity among four MWNTs. For the MWNTs with the oxygen contents of 3.84%, the adsorption affinity related with hydrophobic interaction and \u03c0-electron polarizability decreased in the order of 4-NP>PFOSA>PFOS>2,4-D>PFOA. Furthermore, the adsorption characters of five contaminants were affected by solution pH and solute pK(a) considering electrostatic repulse force and hydrogen bonding, which showed the adsorption of MWNTs with lower oxygen content is much sensitive to solution chemistry.",

        "abstract": "An investigation was performed for the regeneration of three granular activated carbons (GACs) exhausted with acid orange 7 (AO7). The three GACs were made from different materials, i.e. coconut shells, almond nucleus and coal. The AO7 adsorption process was carried out in a continuous-flow adsorption column. After adsorption, the AO7-saturated GAC was dried at 120 degrees C, then regenerated in a quartz reactor by 2450 MHz microwave (MW) irradiation at 850 W for 5 min. The efficacy of this procedure was analyzed by determining the rates and amounts of AO7 adsorbed in successive adsorption-MW regeneration cycles. Effects of this regeneration on the structural properties, surface chemistry and the AO7 adsorption capacities of GAC samples were examined. It was found that after several adsorption-MW regeneration cycles, the adsorption rates and capacities of GACs could maintain relatively high levels, even higher than those of virgin GACs, as indicated by AO7 breakthrough curves and adsorption isotherms. The improvement of GAC adsorption properties resulted from the modification of pore size distribution and surface chemistry by MW irradiation.",

        "abstract": "Heterogeneous catalytic ozonation, in which ozone is activated by various catalysts to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), is an effective approach to degrade persistent organic pollutants in water. However, catalyst with high activity and good stability for catalytic ozonation still remains rare. In this work, a highly dispersed cerium oxide on oxidized carbon nanotubes (CeO-OCNT) were prepared and characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and temperature-programmed reduction using hydrogen (TPR-H) experiments. The as-synthesized CeO-OCNT showed significantly enhanced catalytic performance for degrading organic pollutants during catalytic ozonation. The removal efficiency of optimized CeO-OCNT for phenol mineralization was 2-3 times of pure CeO and OCNT, and was also better than that of a composite with the same composition, which demonstrated a synergic effect between OCNT and CeO on CeO-OCNT for catalytic ozonation. The TOC removal efficiency exhibited no obvious reduction after five cycling experiments, indicating the synthesized CeO-OCNT possessed good reusability. Moreover, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and radicals quenching experiments revealed that hydroxyl radicals (OH) were the dominant ROS for organic pollutants degradation. The superior activity of CeO-OCNT for catalytic ozonation could be attributed to the well-dispersed CeO, the improved mass transfer, and the facilitated redox Ce/Ce cycling.",

The plots of log K(SA) vs. reciprocal absolute temperature show a change in slope at 0 degrees C. A log-log linear regression of K(SA) vs. octanol/air partition coefficient (K(OA)) has a slope close to 1, indicating that K(OA) is a good descriptor of the interchemical variability in K(SA).

        "title": "Temperature measurement of GAC and decomposition of PCP loaded on GAC and GAC-supported copper catalyst in microwave irradiation",
        "abstract": "A sheltered type-K thermocouple was applied to record the temperature rising courses of granular activated carbon (GAC) in a microwave irradiation field under various conditions. The results showed that GAC could absorb microwave energy effectively and its temperature rose up to 1100 \u00b0C in a few minutes. This interaction of GAC and microwave was utilized to the preparation of GAC-supported copper catalyst. The catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), iodine number and adsorption isotherm. It was found that elemental copper distributed uniformly on the surface of GAC, and after loading copper, the adsorption capacity of GAC decreased due to occupation of adsorption sites by copper. Decomposition of a typical chlorinated organic chemical, pentachlorophenol (PCP), on virgin GAC and copper-loaded GAC was assisted by microwave irradiation. Firstly, PCP in water was adsorbed onto GAC, then PCP-loaded GAC irradiated by microwave in a quartz reactor. The results indicated that most of PCP adsorbed on virgin GAC was decomposed or bound irreversibly to GAC under 850 w microwave irradiation for 10 min, and less than 2% was transformed into intermediates. A more rapid decomposition rate of PCP was observed on copper-loaded GAC with larger amount of intermediates formed. Identification of intermediates was accomplished by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. Keywords Microwave Activated carbon Catalyst Preparation Pentachlorophenol Decomposition 1 Introduction Microwaves are electromagnetic waves of which spectrum lies between infrared radiation and radio frequencies corresponding to wavelengths of 1 mm to 1 m (frequencies of 300 GHz to 300 MHz). Microwave radiation when applied to materials makes the dipolar molecules rotate and the ions migrate. The energy absorbed is dissipated as heat [1] . Microwave heating is therefore internal as compared to conventional heating which is external. Sources of microwave irradiation allow high temperatures and high rates of heating to be obtained [2] . A typical example of microwave heating material is its effect on carbon. When carbon is exposed to a microwave field, its temperature can rise to 1000 \u00b0C in a few minutes [2] . The reason can be explained by space charge polarization [3] . Some carbons have free electrons whose displacement is restricted by grain boundaries. When these carbons are subjected to an electromagnetic field, space charge polarization takes place. Entire macroscopic regions of the material become either positively or negatively synchronizing their orientation with the field. At low frequency, the polarization synchronizes its orientation with the field, but as the frequency of waves increases there is a phase lag between the polarization and the applied field. This leads to absorption of energy and Joule heating of the carbon particles. The temperature measurement in microwave field is regarded crucial for reactions. Some researchers [4] believe that traditional technique of thermocouples for temperature measurements cannot be applied inside microwave ovens due to the electromagnetic field and the metal probes interactions, while there are reports that a thermocouple introduced normal to the direction of the electromagnetic field does not influence the electromagnetic field distribution [5,6] . Men\u00e9ndez et al. [7] compared an Inconel sheltered type-K thermocouple and an infrared pyrometer in measuring the temperature of carbon bed during microwave treatment and found that the obtained results for these two techniques were comparable. The selective-heating character of microwave gives us an advantage of energy saving in the heating processes. Microwave dielectric heating has been widely applied to catalyst preparation [8] , catalysis reaction [9] , and environmental remediation [10\u201313] . Among various novel methods used in the preparation of catalysts, microwave irradiation is developed as effective technique which can offer rapid drying, uniform distribution of active components, physically stronger pellet during preparation of catalysts and enhance conversion rate and selectivity with significant energy saving during the performance [14] . Lingaiah et al. [15] prepared a series of silica-supported Pd-Fe bimetallic catalysts by conventional as well as microwave heating methods. They found that the catalysts prepared with microwave irradiation had a different morphology and possessed a higher hydrodechlorination activity compared to their conventionally prepared analogues. Microwave-assisted treatment has been applied to the in situ soil remediation of sites contaminated with PCBs [11] , PAHs [12] , as well as the disposal of sludge containing heavy metals [13] . Another typical application of microwave is in the processing of packaging wastes [2] . Processes applying granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption and microwave decomposition to the treatment of VOCs have shown considerable savings in energy consumption and process efficiency [16] . The purposes of this study are to monitor the temperature rising courses of GAC exposed to 2450 MHz microwave field under various conditions with a sheltered type-K thermocouple probe, and to explore the effects of microwave irradiation on the preparation of GAC-supported copper catalyst as well as on the decomposition of PCP loaded on virgin GAC and copper-loaded GAC. 2 Experimental Commercial coal-based GAC (Tangshan Corp., China) was first immersed in 10% diluted hydrochloric acid for 24 h, heated in boiling water for 30 min, washed with deioned water to remove fines and impurities and dried at 105 \u00b0C overnight before impregnating it with the active component. Catalyst with 10 wt.% Cu was prepared by impregnating the GAC with an aqueous solution of copper nitrate (Shenyang Agent Company, China). The suspension was mixed in a shaking bed at 250 rpm for 2 h and evaporated to near-dryness in a microwave oven at 640 w intermittent power for 2 min. The catalyst was subsequently calcined in a quartz reactor ( Fig. 1 ) with no air input by microwave irradiation at 100% power (850 w, 2.45 GHz) for 10 min. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the catalyst was recorded with a Shimadzu LabX XRD-6000 X-ray diffractometer using Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The surface morphology of the catalyst was determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using Oxford JSM-5600 LV microscope assisted with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) to analyze the approximate atomic composition on the examined surface. The samples were characterized at tension voltages of 15 and 20 eV, and the results were expressed as secondary electron images (SEI). Decomposition of PCP loaded on GAC and GAC-supported copper catalyst was carried out in a quartz reactor. Loaded GAC was obtained by mixing 100 ml of PCP solution (2000 mg l \u22121 , pH 10.0) with 10 g GAC in 250 ml flasks. The flasks were sealed and placed in thermostatic shaker (250 rpm, 20 \u00b0C) for 6 h to obtain equilibrium. Separation of GAC from the solution was completed by filtration. The schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus is shown in Fig. 1 . An 850 w modified domestic microwave oven at the frequency of 2450 MHz with continuous adjustable power settings was used. The quartz column reactor (34 mm i.d.) was installed into the microwave oven. At the bottom of the column, a perforated quartz plate was fixed to sustain GAC. GAC loaded with PCP was put into the column and treated by microwave heating under various conditions. The temperature rising courses of GAC were recorded with a sheltered type-K thermocouple probe, which was inserted to a point near the center of the carbon bed. The top of the column was connected to a condensing system. A vessel was used to collect distillate and the contaminant vapor generated passed through two bottles both containing 20 ml of 0.1 mol l \u22121 NaOH solution. The determination of PCP concentrations in the filtrate, distillate and alkaline absorption solution was performed by HPLC (PU-1580, UV-1575, Jasco Chromatography, Japan) using a Kromasil ODS (5 \u03bcm, 4.6 mm \u00d7250 mm) reverse phase column, a methanol: water=0.8: 0.2 ml min \u22121 of the mobile phase and UV-absorbance detection (220 nm). Total organic carbon analyzer (TOC-V CPH , Shimadzu, Japan) was employed for distillate analysis. PCP amounts in GAC before and after microwave irradiation were also detected by HPLC. The pretreatment procedure was as follows: approximately 1 g of GAC was heated at 103 \u00b0C for 6 h to constant weight. After cooling to the room temperature, 0.100 g of GAC was accurately weighed. PCP in GAC was extracted by 20 ml mixture of acetone and dichloromethane (3:2 (v/v)), with 0.2 ml of 37% hydrochloric acid added (shaking at 250 rpm for 2 h, then ultrasonic extracting for 30 min). The extraction procedure was repeated for six times. Afterwards, the extract was evaporated in 60 \u00b0C water bath to incipient dryness. The resultant sample was dissolved in 10 ml acetonitrile and analyzed by HPLC. A gas chromatograph (GC) (HP6890) with a capillary column (HP-5MS, 30 m \u00d70.25 mm \u00d70.25 \u03bcm ) and a mass spectrometer (MS) (HP5973) were employed to the identification of intermediates and decomposition products. A solvent delay at 5 min, and full scan mode were used. The oven temperature was programmed from 60 to 260 \u00b0C (20 min) at a ramp rate of 15 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The injector temperature was 260 \u00b0C and the transfer line was maintained at 280 \u00b0C. The MSD was operated in the electron impact (EI) mode. The ion source temperature was 200 \u00b0C and the electron energy was 70 eV. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Temperature rising courses of GAC in microwave field According to the method presented by Men\u00e9ndez et al. [7] , the temperature rising courses of GAC in microwave field under different microwave power, GAC dose and moisture content, were recorded by a sheltered type-K thermocouple. 3.1.1 Microwave power The temperature attained in the carbon bed depends on the nature of the carbon (dielectric properties) as well as on the microwave power applied to the sample. For a given carbon, the temperature can in principle, be modified by adjusting the input power [7] . One special point to be noted is that the power levels used here are continuous, not just timed mark/space ratio control. The investigated power series was 160, 320, 480, 640 and 850 w. GAC dose and water content involved were 10 g and 52.5%, respectively. The results were illustrated in Fig. 2 . It can be clearly seen that at larger microwave output power, the temperature of GAC bed rises more rapidly. When the microwave power was as high as 640 w, the temperature rose up to 1100 \u00b0C in 4 min. Since the highest temperature that the thermocouple can endure is 1200 \u00b0C, as soon as the displayed value is close to 1150 \u00b0C, the microwave oven must be turned off. 3.1.2 GAC dose As different GAC dose means different volume and height of GAC in the reactor, thus different GAC load to microwave irradiation, GAC dose greatly influences the receiving of microwave energy. The GAC doses investigated were 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 g, with 850 w power and 52.5% moisture content. During the experiment, it was found that when the GAC dose was as small as 5 g, the thermocouple could not be utilized to indicate its temperature. Because when the amount of GAC is too small, the probe of thermocouple could not be immersed into GAC bed and it is exposed to microwave irradiation directly, which causes sparks on the tip of the probe. In that case, the displayed temperature value was not that of GAC bed, but that of the sparks. Although the temperature of 5 g GAC bed could not be determined by the thermocouple, it was observed that the GAC bed did not turn red in 10 min irradiation. In a subsequent experiment, the position of GAC bed was raised up to the center of reactor and the same phenomenon was observed. The temperature rising courses of GAC bed in other doses were exhibited in Fig. 3 . It seems that a larger GAC dose absorbs microwave energy more effectively and its temperature rises more rapidly at the beginning. However, the temperature rising rate of larger GAC dose decreased later. The reason was considered to be that more energy was needed to maintain high temperature for larger dose. And the 15 g dose was taken as the best in view of absorbing microwave energy and keeping high temperature. 3.1.3 Moisture content of GAC The moisture content of a sample has an effect on the final temperature it attains during microwave heating [17] . Changes in moisture content will alter the conductivity and permittivity of the sample, and hence the strength of the electric fields in the material and the power dissipated in it. Water has a high dielectric loss factor, so relatively small differences in moisture contents between samples will result in temperature differences between them. Generally, it is believed that microwave activation occurs much faster with dry carbon than with wet carbon. A series of four moisture contents of GAC were studied, i.e. 0, 16.8, 36.4 and 52.5%, with microwave power 850 w and GAC dose 10 g. The results were shown in Fig. 4 , which were consistent with that of Haque et al. [18] . They found that to heat 100 g of dry carbon from room temperature to 650 \u00b0C, about 0.2\u20130.25 kWh of microwave power input was required, whereas the same mass of wet carbon of approximately 50% moisture required about 0.4\u20130.6 kWh. 3.2 Decomposition of PCP on virgin GAC and copper-loaded GAC XRD measurement was carried out to analyze the status and crystal structure of copper on the support. Fig. 5 shows the XRD spectroscopy of virgin GAC and copper-loaded GAC. Sharp intensive peaks were observed in the characteristic positions of elemental copper structure at 2 \u03b8 =43.3 and 2 \u03b8 =50.4\u00b0 for the prepared catalyst (dotted line). Unlike the prepared catalyst, the virgin GAC (solid line) shows very small crystalline structure related to copper at 2 \u03b8 =43.3\u00b0. This indicates that the crystalline structure of copper presented in the prepared catalyst is due to the decomposition of copper nitrate. The two SEM pictures ( Fig. 6 ) obtained on virgin GAC and copper-loaded GAC corroborate the results obtained on XRD. In the case of GAC-supported copper catalyst, agglomeration of elemental copper into large particles is clearly visible. From EDX analysis, it was found that the copper loading on this catalyst is about 12.6 wt.%. Iodine number provides an indication of the adsorption ability of GAC to small molecular compounds. This index was tested for the two GAC samples according to the National Standard Testing Methods of P. R. China (GB/T 12496.8-1999). The corresponding values for virgin GAC and copper-loaded GAC were 944.1 and 824.0 mg g \u22121 , respectively. It was because that for the latter sample, some adsorption sites were occupied by elemental copper after loading, as can be seen from the SEM images. The adsorption isotherms ( Fig. 7 ) of the two GAC samples to PCP were also measured according to the method provided by Mollah and Robinson [19] , the results were in consistency with that of iodine number. For the decomposition of PCP, the initial amounts of PCP loaded on 10 g virgin GAC and on GAC-supported copper catalyst were 199.52 and 198.78 mg, respectively. The operating parameters for PCP decomposition experiment were: microwave output power 850 w, irradiation time 10 min and moisture content 52.5%. The temperature rising courses ( Fig. 8 ) of the two GAC beds during PCP decomposition were also recorded by the sheltered type-K thermocouple. It seemed that water evaporated faster from the surface of copper-loaded GAC due to its less adsorption capacity to water molecules, so its temperature began to increase rapidly after 60 s microwave irradiation (about 40 s earlier than that of virgin GAC). But the overall temperature rising rate of copper-loaded GAC was smaller and its final temperature after 10 min microwave irradiation might be lower as observed from appearance status. The reason was that elemental copper loading on the GAC surface decreased its ability in absorbing microwave energy (some microwave irradiation was reflected by copper). From the HPLC analysis for the off-gas basic absorption solutions, it was found that anything could hardly be detected in these two cases. Organic solvent and acid extraction of the PCP-loaded GAC before irradiation led to a 55.4\u00b11.5% recovery rate. The total amount of chemicals in distillate was indicated by the index of TOC. PCP residues left in virgin GAC and copper-loaded GAC and TOC in distillate after different microwave irradiation times were plotted in Figs. 9 and 10 . As can be seen from Fig. 9 , PCP was decomposed promptly on virgin GAC or on copper-loaded GAC. More than 95% was decomposed or bound irreversibly (carbonization) to GAC after 6 min microwave irradiation for PCP on virgin GAC and nearly 100% for PCP on copper-loaded GAC. One special issue to be mentioned is that PCP was decomposed more rapidly on the latter although its temperature might be lower. The faster decomposition rate was deemed due to the contribution from the catalysis effect of copper. Data in Fig. 10 indicated that the amount of TOC in distillate was minor compared to the initial amount of PCP loaded on GAC. And for the decomposition of PCP loaded on GAC-supported copper catalyst, much more TOC was formed in distillate. The reason was the same as that of temperature rising, i.e. faster water evaporating rate brought out more PCP and its derivatives into distillate. Identification of intermediates was performed by GC/MS analysis. For the distillate from virgin GAC, three main dechlorination intermediate products, tetrachlorophenol, trichlorophenol and dichlorophenol, were distinguished and some minor amount of dehydroxylation products, pentachlorobenzene and trichlorobenzene were also identified. For the distillate from GAC-supported copper catalyst, further dechlorination intermediates, chlorophenol and phenol were found besides those mentioned above. The detailed degradation mechanism of PCP loaded on GAC exposed to microwave irradiation will be discussed elsewhere [20] . 4 Conclusions The potential of microwave heating as an alternative to conventional conductive heating for the introduction of energy into reactions encourages researchers to use microwave power in various fields. In this study, the temperature rising courses of GAC exposed to microwave irradiation were recorded with a sheltered type-K thermocouple, and it was found that microwave power and moisture content of GAC sample were the two key parameters. Microwave oven with adjustable power settings and with full-power level of 850 w was employed to the preparation of GAC-supported copper catalyst. Compared to conventional catalyst preparation method, this novel method is energy and time saving, does not need inert gas protection and hydrogen reduction with highly dispersed GAC-supported elemental copper catalyst obtained. PCP adsorbed on virgin GAC or copper-loaded GAC was almost completely decomposed or tightly bound to GAC under microwave irradiation in a few minutes. All this has demonstrated the potential effectiveness of microwave irradiation in catalyst preparation and environmental remediation.

        "abstract": "To elucidate the relationship between photochemical functions with the structure of humic acids (HA), we developed a molecular imprinting method to separate the substances with given structure and investigated their photochemical behavior in aqueous solution. The substances with porphyrin-like core structure, such as chlorophyll or heme, were employed as template substances for preparing molecular imprinting polymers (MIP). The polymers were used to separate the substances with porphyrin-like structure from HA. Photochemical experiments were conducted to evaluate effects of the separated HA fractions on the photodegradation of coexisting organic pollutant. The results showed that all fractions bound by MIP accelerated photochemical degradation of coexisting 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) under simulated sunlight (lambda>290 nm) irradiation, indicating that HA with porphyrin-like structure possesses better photoactivity than ones without the structure. The photochemical degradation of 2,4-D was enhanced when Fe(III), the ubiquitous element in natural aquatic systems, was added owing to the formation of Fe(III) complex with the HA. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra indicated that OH* and 1O2 radicals were generated in the solutions of HA fractions bound by MIP under simulated sunlight irradiation, implying that 2,4-D degradation could be related to oxidation reactions caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS).",

        "title": "Silicon nanowire/TiO2 heterojunction arrays for effective photoelectrocatalysis under simulated solar light irradiation",
        "abstract": "The silicon nanowire (SiNW)/TiO 2 heterojunction arrays have been prepared by chemical vapor depositing a TiO 2 layer on SiNW arrays which are obtained by chemical etching of Si wafers. The types of SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunctions can be modulated simply by using p-type or n-type Si wafers. Compared with samples of depositing TiO 2 on p-type or n-type Si wafers (p-Si/TiO 2 or p-Si/TiO 2 ), both n-SiNW/TiO 2 and p-SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunctions can improve the ultraviolet photoresponse under a bias potential, and in particular, a remarkable visible photoresponse of n-SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunction is observed when the bias potential is higher than 1.7 V (vs. SCE). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves illuminate that n-SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunctions have steady visible photoresponse in aqueous solution. According to the surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements, it is found that n-SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunctions possess window effect, namely, n-SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunctions can utilize the superposition photoresponse in the wavelength ranges from 300 to 400 nm (contributed by TiO 2 ) and from 400 to 800 nm (contributed by n-SiNW). The mechanism of this phenomenon is explained based on the energy band model. The photoelectrocatalytic activity of the n-SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunction arrays is evaluated using phenol as a test substance under Xe lamp irradiation. The kinetic constant and total organic carbon (TOC) removal are 1.7 times and 2 times as great as those of n-Si/TiO 2 , respectively. Keywords Silicon nanowire (SiNW) TiO 2 Photoelectrocatalysis Heterojunction 1 Introduction Photocatalysis, as a useful technique in environmental cleaning, can degrade a wide range of contaminants in air or water rapidly and drastically [1] . In the photocatalytic process in water, photocatalysts are generally loaded on the surface of carriers to avoid the difficulties of separating suspended TiO 2 particles from aqueous solution as well as enhance quantum efficiency by applying a bias potential on the conductive carriers [2] . Among these carriers, conductive silicon wafer is the most attractive one, because the lower crystallization temperature [3,4] and faster phase transformation rate [5] of TiO 2 can be obtained using silicon substrate than using other materials, and at the same time, the contaminants of TiO 2 by component of carrier can be suppressed by using silicon substrate [6] . Therefore, many groups select silicon wafer as carrier of TiO 2 [7\u201310] , and the effects of conductive types [11,12] , crystal face [13] or surface morphology [14\u201316] of silicon wafers on the properties of TiO 2 are also investigated. Besides silicon wafer, nano-silicon [17] and porous silicon [18] are also used to support TiO 2 . Compared with bulk or disorder nano-carriers, aligned nano-materials are regarded as better carriers because they possess large specific surface area and can be constructed with TiO 2 to form heterojunction with the photogenerated charge separation ability [19,20] . However, the work on using nano-silicon array as carrier of photocatalysts is rather limited. The blank would be filled up since silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays have been fabricated [21] . SiNW as a novel material has been studied extensively because of its high compatibility with standard CMOS technology and possible integration in future electronic devices. Because SiNW has considerable photo-harvesting ability [22] and its conductive types can be modulated [23] , it is a promising material to construct various types of heterojunctions with semiconductor photocatalysts. And subsequently, it is favorable to explore other properties of heterojunctions in photocatalytic degradation of pollutant, such as window effect, which is a common concept in physics of semiconductors [24] and has been widely investigated in solar cells [25\u201329] and solar light water splitting [30\u201332] . When a heterojunction, which is constructed by covering a wide band-gap semiconductor (such as TiO 2 ) on the top surface of a narrow band-gap semiconductor, is illuminated with solar light, the UV light could be absorbed by TiO 2 , while the visible light could permeate the TiO 2 layer on the top of the heterojunction and would be absorbed by the narrow-gap semiconductor in the bottom of the heterojunction. Because the short and long wavelength lights can be absorbed by TiO 2 and the narrow-gap semiconductor, respectively, the photoconversion efficiency is enhanced effectively. In this process, TiO 2 acts as a window of narrow-gap semiconductor, so this property of heterojunction is named window effect. Due to window effect, the heterojunction photocatalyst can utilize both visible light and UV light of the solar spectrum in photocatalytic process, and thus its photocatalytic ability would be enhanced remarkably. However, no papers to date have been published on window effect in photocatalytic degradation of pollutant. It has higher requests for photocatalytic electrodes in degradation of pollutant than in solar cells or solar light water splitting. The photoelectrodes in degradation of pollutant must be composed of nontoxic materials, be stable with respect to photocorrosion, have band-gap energies sufficient for degradation of pollutant and have a high efficiency in general electrolyte. In all these aspects, the SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunction arrays would be a proper electrode. Furthermore, most photocatalytic electrodes (existing in the domain of solar cell or water splitting) with window effect are the planar multilayer structure [33] , while the SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunction arrays are the aligned coaxial-cable structure. It is obvious that the SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunction arrays possess high specific surface areas, enhanced antireflection ability and excellent transfer routes for charge carriers. Herein, we fabricate the SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunction arrays on conducting silicon substrate. By using p-type or n-type silicon wafers, p-SiNW and n-SiNW can be obtained, and subsequently, p\u2013n and n\u2013n heterojunctions of SiNW/TiO 2 are fabricated. It is found that the n\u2013n junction has window effect, but p\u2013n junction not. Because n-SiNW/TiO 2 can response to both visible light and UV light of the solar spectrum, its photocatalytic mineralizing ability is enhanced. 2 Experimental methods 2.1 Fabrication of SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunction arrays Si wafers (n-type Si (1 1 1), phosphorus-doped, and p-type Si (1 1 1), boron-doped) were purchased from China Electronics Science & Technology Group No. 46 Institute. The process of cleaning Si wafers involved firstly rinsing in ultrasonic bath with acetone (5 min), ethanol (5 min) and deionized water (10 min), sequentially; secondly chemical etching by immersing in a mixture of H 2 SO 4 and H 2 O 2 (3:1 in volume) for 30 min; and lastly dipping into a solution of HF (5%) for 1 min and drying in argon flow at room temperature. The clean Si wafer was then put into the vessel containing the etching solution of 4.6 M HF and 0.02 M AgNO 3 [21] . The reaction was lasted for 60 min at 50 \u00b0C in thermostatic water bath. After reaction, the sample was put into the mixture of HNO 3 and H 2 O (1:1 in volume) to remove Ag catalysts. Then the SiNW array was dipped into 5% HF solution for 1 min. As soon as the SiNW array was taken out, it was rinsed with water immediately, dried in a Ar flow, put into a tubular quartz reactor in a furnace and then heated in a combined flow of Ar (800 mL min \u22121 ) and H 2 (100 mL min \u22121 ). When the temperature reached 320 \u00b0C, the H 2 flow was turned off and titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TTIP) was fed continuously into the tubular quartz reactor through a capillary. At the outlet of the capillary, TTIP was immediately volatilized and swept into the reaction zone by the Ar flow. After 10 min, the reaction finished and the substrate was annealed in air at 400 \u00b0C for 60 min with a heating rate of 2 \u00b0C min \u22121 . Then the substrate was allowed to cool to room temperature, and SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunction was obtained. Schematic diagram of this fabrication process was shown as Fig. 1 , and the flow chart was in Supplementary Material . As comparison, TiO 2 was deposited on the clean Si wafers to fabricate Si/TiO 2 . If the Si wafer was p type, p-SiNW/TiO 2 and p-Si/TiO 2 was obtained, while n-SiNW/TiO 2 and n-Si/TiO 2 could be fabricated by using n-type Si wafer. 2.2 Characterization Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM Quanta 200 FEG) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM FEI-Tecnai G 2 20) coupled with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) were employed to characterize the morphologies of SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunctions. The crystallographic structures of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD; Shimadzu Laboratory X XRD-6000). The photovoltage was measured using a surface photovoltage (SPV) measurement system which consisted of a monochromator (model Omni-k 3005) and a lock-in amplifier (model SR830-DSP) with an optical chopper (model SR540). Photoelectrochemical measurements were preformed in 0.01 M Na 2 SO 4 using three-electrode cell that was connected to a CHI 650B electrochemical station (CH Instruments, Shanghai Chenhua, China), where the SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunction arrays acted as the working electrode, a platinum foil as the counter electrode and the SCE as the reference electrode. A high pressure xenon short arc lamp (CHF-XM35-500W, Beijing Changtuo Co., China) was used as the light source to simulate solar light. The light intensity was 100 mW cm \u22122 . 2.3 Photocatalytic experiment Photocatalytic degradation of phenol in the aqueous solution using 0.01 M Na 2 SO 4 as the electrolyte was carried out under the 500 W xenon lamp irradiation in a reactor with a quartz window (1 cm \u00d7 1 cm) to allow the incident radiation to enter with minimal attenuation. The n-SiNW/TiO 2 arrays served as the photoanode, a platinum foil and the SCE acted as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. For comparison, the n-Si/TiO 2 was used as the photoanode by replacing the n-SiNW/TiO 2 arrays. The applied areas of the n-SiNW/TiO 2 and the n-Si/TiO 2 are both 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm. The concentration of phenol was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Waters 2695, Separations module) with a Sunfire\u2122 C18 (5 \u03bcm) reverse-phase column at 30 \u00b0C equipped with photodiode array detector (Waters 2996). The mobile phase was 0.5 mL min \u22121 of methanol and water (v:v = 0.55:0.45) and the wavelength was set at 280 nm for phenol and 254 nm for intermediates, respectively. Total organic carbon analyzer (TOC-V CPH , Shimadzu, Japan) was employed for TOC determination. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Morphologies and crystallographic structures Fig. 2 a illuminates that large-scale oriented high-aspect-ratio n-SiNW arrays can be produced on the surface of Si wafer by immersing it in etching solution for 60 min. After depositing TiO 2 around SiNW, the array structure remains without destruct ( Fig. 2 b). While depositing TiO 2 on n-Si wafer, the TiO 2 nanoparticles congregate into big ball with the diameter of about 2 \u03bcm ( Fig. 2 c). Fig. 3 a is a TEM image of a single SiNW. Its diameter is about 200 nm, which enlarges to about 400 nm after depositing TiO 2 , and there are clear boundaries between SiNW core and TiO 2 shell (inset in Fig. 3 a). Fig. 3 b is the EDX analysis, which shows that the synthesized products contain Si, Ti and O elements (Cu signals are from copper TEM grid) and the element ratio of Ti and O is about 1:2, that is, the shell layer is composed of TiO 2 . Fig. 3 c is a high-magnified TEM image of TiO 2 shell layer, from which the cubic lattice feature of the edge is clearly visible. In order to obtain the distance between the adjacent lattice fringes, the line profile from the area labeled by the rectangular frame in Fig. 3 c is displayed in the inset. As shown in this inset, the periodic fringe spacing of 0.351 nm can be assigned to the interplanar distance of the (1 0 1) plane of anatase TiO 2 . In addition, the loading amount of TiO 2 is 0.93 mg cm \u22122 for n-SiNW/TiO 2 by calculating the mass difference of SiNW/TiO 2 and SiNW. In order to determine crystallographic structures of the samples, XRD patterns of SiNW/TiO 2 and Si/TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 4 . The peaks at 2 \u03b8 = 25.3\u00b0 and 28.4\u00b0 correspond to anatase TiO 2 (1 0 1) reflections and Si (1 1 1) reflections, respectively. Moreover, the average diameter of TiO 2 is 31.8 nm for Si/TiO 2 and 25.4 nm for SiNW/TiO 2 according to Scherrer equation [34] . Comparison with Si/TiO 2 , the peak locations of SiNW/TiO 2 are the same, but the peak intensities are changed. It is obvious that the specific surface area of SiNW array is larger than that of Si wafer. As a result, the thickness of TiO 2 layer on SiNW array is thinner than that on Si wafer if depositing TiO 2 for the same duration. In this condition, Si diffraction peak of SiNW/TiO 2 is stronger than that of Si/TiO 2 , while TiO 2 diffraction peaks of SiNW/TiO 2 are weaker than that of Si/TiO 2 . 3.2 Photoelectrochemical properties The photoelectrochemical measurements of SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunctions are performed in 0.01 M Na 2 SO 4 solution. The simulated solar light is provided by the xenon lamp and the visible light is obtained by using a cutoff filter, which allows wavelengths larger than 400 nm to be incident. As shown in Fig. 5 a , the photocurrents increase with bias potential for both n-SiNW/TiO 2 and n-Si/TiO 2 , and the photocurrent of n-SiNW/TiO 2 is higher than that of n-Si/TiO 2 in the measuring potential region. When the bias potential is below 1.7 V (vs. SCE), neither samples show visible light photoresponse. When the bias potential exceeds 1.7 V (vs. SCE), the total photocurrent of n-Si/TiO 2 increases slowly and there is no visible light photoresponse. But the onset of the visible light photoresponse is observed at approximately 1.7 V (vs. SCE) for n-SiNW/TiO 2 , whose total photocurrent increases accordantly with the visible light photocurrent. It is obvious that both UV light and visible light contribute the photocurrent, that is to say, n-SiNW/TiO 2 behave a window effect. Depending on window effect, the photocurrent of n-SiNW/TiO 2 reaches 1.44 mA cm \u22122 at 3.0 V (vs. SCE), which is 2.9-fold of that of n-Si/TiO 2 at the same potential. The SiNW/TiO 2 has the higher photocurrent density than the planar Si/TiO 2 due to high specific surface areas, enhanced antireflection ability, excellent transfer routes for charge carriers. The fact that Si/TiO 2 has no visible-light response is because TiO 2 layer on Si wafer surface is thicker than that around SiNW surface with the same deposition time. For a heterojunction with a planar film structure, there is an optimal thickness of the front semiconductor (wide band gap) [35] . If the thickness of TiO 2 layer on Si wafer exceeds the optimal thickness, the inner TiO 2 could not be induced and would obstruct the transfer of photogenerated carriers, and consequently, window effect would not occur. In order to investigate the difference of visible light photoresponse between n-SiNW and n-SiNW/TiO 2 in solution, cyclic voltammetry (CV) characteristic was measured under visible light irradiation. According to the CV curves, the photocurrent of n-SiNW can not maintained constant in 0.01 M Na 2 SO 4 solution ( Fig. 5 b). After 10 cycles, it decreases from above 3.0 mA cm \u22122 sharply to 0.34 mA cm \u22122 at 3.0 V (vs. SCE) and would decrease continuously. The photocurrent of n-SiNW/TiO 2 , however, is steady and about 0.90 mA cm \u22122 after 10 cycles ( Fig. 5 c). These results indicate that the visible light photoresponse of n-SiNW/TiO 2 can be steady. Based on electrochemistry theory of semiconductor, photocurrent could be generated when the n-Si anode is illuminated [36] . But this photocurrent is unstable in aqueous electrolytes [37] . In the electrolyte without fluoric anion, oxide would be generated on the surface of Si electrode and photocurrent would be shut off. Therefore, the photocurrent of SiNW itself is very large at the initial stage, and then decreasing gradually in general electrolyte. In the case of SiNW/TiO 2 , SiNW could avoid the contact with the electrolyte duo to the TiO 2 layer existing, and no oxide of silicon could generate. As a result, the photocurrent could be maintained in the general electrolyte. On the other hand, the oxidation of water is the only reaction under our experiment conditions. The anodic photocurrents are attributed to oxygen evolution, whose onset potential is about 2.1 V (vs. SCE), while the standard potential of oxygen evolution is 1.23 V (vs. NHE). Therefore, the overvoltage can be calculated to be about 1.1 V. Because water oxidation is a competing reaction in the photocatalytic degradation process of pollutant in aqueous solution, the high overvoltage of oxygen evolution is advantageous for pollutant oxidation [38,39] . The surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements are always used to observe the photoresponse abilities under different wavelengths because the signal of SPV is attributed to the changes of surface potential barriers before and after illumination [40] . In order to illuminate why n-SiNW/TiO 2 but n-Si/TiO 2 has window effect, the SPV spectra of n-Si, n-SiNW, n-Si/TiO 2 and n-SiNW/TiO 2 are shown in Fig. 6 . The n-Si wafer exhibits photoresponse in all the wavelengths, and its SPV signal is obviously higher in visible light region from 400 to 800 nm than that in UV light region from 300 to 400 nm, which means that Si has preponderant photoresponse ability in visible light region. The SPV spectrum of n-SiNW is similar to that of n-Si, but its SPV signal is higher than n-Si possibly because of its excellent antireflection ability [41] . After deposition of TiO 2 , which has main photoresponse in UV light region, SPV response of n-SiNW/TiO 2 is distinctly different from that of n-Si/TiO 2 . In UV light region, both the SPV signals of n-Si/TiO 2 and n-SiNW/TiO 2 exhibit the characteristic of TiO 2 . While in visible light region, no SPV response is observed from n-Si/TiO 2 , but remarkable SPV response, which is similar to that of Si in shape, appears in case of n-SiNW/TiO 2 . These phenomena illuminate that n-SiNW/TiO 2 can superpose the visible light photoresponse of n-SiNW and the UV light photoresponse of TiO 2 , but n-Si/TiO 2 has no this ability. It is also noticed that the SPV signal of n-SiNW/TiO 2 is even higher than that of n-Si/TiO 2 in UV light region. The type of SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunction can affect the behavior of window effect. Fig. 7 shows photocurrents of p-SiNW/TiO 2 and p-Si/TiO 2 . Their photocurrents also increase with bias potential, and the photocurrent of p-SiNW/TiO 2 is higher than that of p-Si/TiO 2 in the measuring potential region. The abrupt increase of dark current is observed for potentials higher than 2.0 V (vs. SCE), and the visible light photocurrent curve is almost a repetition of dark current curve in the whole potential region, which illuminates p-SiNW/TiO 2 showing no visible light photoresponse. 3.3 Mechanisms The extraordinary photoelectrochemical properties of SiNW/TiO 2 are illuminated by schematic band diagrams of the p-SiNW/TiO 2 and n-SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunctions as shown in Fig. 8 . The diameter of SiNW in this paper is about 200 nm, which is too large to affect the energy bands [42] , and therefore the energy bands of SiNW are same to that of Si. The TiO 2 is a typical n-type semiconductor, whose Fermi level locates close to the conduction-band edge, which is more positive (vs. NHE) than that of n-SiNW. When TiO 2 nanoparticles are in contact with n-SiNW, the electrons will flow from the conduction band of n-SiNW into the conduction band of TiO 2 through the interface, and they will assemble in the TiO 2 side of the interface since electron is also the majority carriers for n-TiO 2 [43] . The flowing process will stop when the Fermi levels of the TiO 2 and n-SiNW are equal. In this process, the energy bands of n-SiNW shift downside with Fermi lever, whereas the energy bands of TiO 2 shift upside, leading to the valence band difference (\u0394 E v ) decreased. In fact, \u0394 E v is the barrier for photogenerated-hole injection into TiO 2 from n-SiNW [44] . Once the applied voltage overcomes this barrier, the holes generated by visible light would transfer from n-SiNW to TiO 2 , and participate in redox reactions together with the other holes generated from TiO 2 by UV light. As for p-SiNW, its Fermi level is more positive (vs. NHE) than that of TiO 2 , the energy bands of p-SiNW and TiO 2 shift upside and downside, respectively, and the valence band difference (\u0394 E v ) should increase. Therefore, a big bias potential is required to overcome the valence band difference. But when the bias potential is higher than 2.0 V, which is still less than \u0394 E v of p-SiNW/TiO 2 , the dark current increases remarkably. Thus, the visible light photoresponse cannot be observed. 3.4 Photoelectrocatalytic activity In order to evaluate the photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) ability of n-SiNW/TiO 2 , the experiments of PEC degradation of phenol using n-Si/TiO 2 and n-SiNW/TiO 2 have been carried out. For comparison, phenol degradations in electrochemical process (EC) with n-SiNW/TiO 2 and directly photolytic process (DP) have been also performed. As shown in Fig. 9 , under xenon lamp irradiation, in 3 h, the degradation efficiency of phenol in PEC is up to 99% involving n-SiNW/TiO 2 , whereas it is 85% on n-Si/TiO 2 . The PEC degradation of phenol follows pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the kinetic constants involving n-Si/TiO 2 and n-SiNW/TiO 2 are 0.010 ( R 2 = 0.998) and 0.017 min \u22121 ( R 2 = 0.998), respectively. The kinetic constant with the heterojunction arrays is 1.7 times as great as the value with the n-Si/TiO 2 . To further illuminate the PEC ability of n-SiNW/TiO 2 , the TOC is measured and the result is shown in Fig. 10 . In 3 h, 66% of TOC are removed with n-SiNW/TiO 2 and only 33% with n-Si/TiO 2 , respectively. The TOC removal of phenol on n-SiNW/TiO 2 is double to that on n-Si/TiO 2 , indicating that considerable intermediate products are oxidized rapidly by n-SiNW/TiO 2 but accumulated in the solution using n-Si/TiO 2 ( Fig. 11 ). The results confirm that n-SiNW/TiO 2 possesses higher mineralizing ability than n-Si/TiO 2 . 4 Conclusion SiNW fabricated by chemical etching of Si wafer is a promising material to construct n\u2013n and p\u2013n heterojunctions with TiO 2 . The heterojunction composed of n-type SiNW and TiO 2 possesses excellent photoconversion ability due to superposition of the UV light photoresponse of TiO 2 and the visible light photoresponse of SiNW. But the heterojunction of p-SiNW and TiO 2 has no this ability. The n-SiNW/TiO 2 heterojunction with window effect shows a higher mineralizing ability than n-Si/TiO 2 . It is expected that this work would provide an access to synthesizing proper heterostructure for various application aims.

Based on it, the hydrophilic QDs were incorporated into multilayer films by layer-by-layer self-assembly. It was found that the as-prepared nanocomposite presented high photostability and allowed highly sensitive and selective determination of copper(II) ions. Under optimum conditions, the FL quenching effect of low concentrations of copper(II) ions could be well described by Langmuir-type binding isotherm in the range from 0.02 to 1.0 \u03bcM, with a detection limit of 8.0 nM. Furthermore, at low concentration levels, it was observed that the FL intensity of nanocomposite could recover to optimal level with the attenuation rate less than 5.8% for five \"on-off-on\" times. At high concentrations, the FL responses fitted fairly well to the typical Stern-Volmer equation range from 1.0 to 30 \u03bcM, while the quenching process turned out to be irreversible. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "A highly ordered TiO 2/Au nanorod array was successfully fabricated by direct current electrodeposition and subsequent spin-coating. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images revealed that the TiO 2 film completely covered the surface of the Au nanorods, which resulted in TiO 2 shell Au core nanorods. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed that the TiO 2 film was anatase with preferential orientation in the (101) plane. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra showed a shift in the absorption edge toward the visible region because of the formation of a Schottky junction between Au and TiO 2. A new absorption peak that ranged from 400 to 800 nm appeared because of the localized surface plasmon resonance of the Au nanorod arrays. For the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B under UV light irradiation, the TiO 2/Au nanorod array exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity and its kinetic constant was 2.0 times that of pristine TiO 2 and 1.3 times that of a TiO 2/Au film. The enhanced photocatalysis was attributed to the high surface volume ratio, an improved UV light response, efficient separation, and the convenient migration of photogenerated charge carriers because of the one-dimensional nanorod structure and the Schottky junction between Au and TiO 2. This work could provide new insights into the fabrication of a high performance photocatalyst and thus facilitate practical environmental applications. \u00a9 2011 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.",

        "abstract": "The Partial Least-Squares (PLS) method was used to further study Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) for photohydrolysis quantum yields of selected aromatic halides. The cluster of substituted bromobenzenes and iodobenzenes was further grouped into two clusters, substituted bromobenzenes and substituted iodobenzenes, for which QSPRs were obtained, respectively. The QSPRs obtained by PLS are more significant than those obtained in previous studies. The studies showed that only when the compounds belonging to different groups are studies separately, inherent relationships between molecular properties and their structure characteristics can be revealed. It can be generally concluded that the photohydrolysis quantum yields of the substituted aromatic halides are dependent on the overall characters of the molecules, the characters of the carbon-halogen bonds to be broken in the photolysis, and the character of the halogen atoms to be replaced in the photolysis. Electronegativity has great relevance to the photohydrolysis processes of the compounds. Substituted aromatic halides with large average molecular polarizability and molecular weight values tend to have low photolysis quantum yields.",

        "abstract": "An anaerobic reactor packed with a pair of Fe-graphite plate electrodes (supplied with 1.2V) was developed to enhance azo dye wastewater treatment. The results showed that decolorization and COD removal of the azo dye wastewater in this hybrid reactor (R1) reached 83.4% and 84.7% at a dye concentration of 1200mg/L, respectively. These values were significantly higher than the sum of the same values in a single anaerobic reactor (R2) and a single electrode reactor (R3). Salinity enhanced the performance of R1 to a certain extent, but weakened that of R2. After a long period of operation, reactor R1 still performed better than the control, even when the voltage supplied to the electrode was off. Taken together, these results indicate that there was a coupling effect between the electrode reaction and biodegradation. 16S rDNA analysis revealed that anaerobic microorganisms in R1 were richer and more diverse. This increased richness and diversity was partially related to the Fe 2+ leaching induced by the electrochemical reaction and increased production of extracellular polymeric substances, which benefited microbial growth and function. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

The results demonstrated that the amount of recognition sites in the polymer was significantly increased and the electron transfer ability of the sensor was improved. The relationship between the peak current and the TC concentration was linear in the range from 0.1 to 40mg L-1, and the detection limit was 0.04mg L-1 (S/N=3). The peak current to TC was 4.3, 6.2 and 6.8 times larger than that of oxytetracycline, chloramphenicol and nafcillin, respectively. Thus, the combination of MIP and MWNTs-GNPs provides a sensitive and selective electrochemical detection method for tetracycline. Copyright \u00a9 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.",

An atomic single layer g-C3N4 (SL g-C3N4) with the thickness of 0.5nm was fabricated by a two-step approach including thermal etching of bulk g-C3N4 into g-C3N4 nanosheets (g-C3N4 NS) and followed by an ultrasonic exfoliation of g-C3N4 NS. The performance of photocatalytic disinfection was investigated by inactivation of Escherichia coli. Under the visible light irradiation, 2\ufffd\ufffd107cfumL-1 of E. coli could be killed completely over the SL g-C3N4 within 4h, whereas only about 3log and 5log of E. coli could be killed on bulk g-C3N4 and g-C3N4 NS under the same condition, respectively. Especially, the direct destruction of the E. coli cell wall was observed by TEM. The enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency of SL g-C3N4 was attributed to the low charge transfer resistance and efficient charge separation which were confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photo-current measurements. Owing to the excellent performance of SL g-C3N4, a visible light response and environmental friendly photocatalyst for disinfection was achieved. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Sorption of nonpolar (phenanthrene and butylate) and polar (atrazine and diuron) organic chemicals to oil-contaminated soil was examined to investigate oil effects on sorption of organic chemicals and to derive oil-water distribution coefficients (K(oil)). The resulting oil-contaminated soil-water distribution coefficients (K(d)) for phenanthrene demonstrated sorption-enhancing effects at both lower and higher oil concentrations (C(oil)) but sorption-reducing (competitive) effects at intermediate C(oil) (approximately 1 g kg(-1)). Rationalization of the different dominant effects was attempted in terms of the relative aliphatic carbon content which determines the accessibility of the aromatic cores to phenanthrene. Little or no competitive effect occurred for butylate because its sorption was dominated by partitioning. For atrazine and diuron, the changes in K(d) at C(oil) above approximately 1 g kg(-1) were negligible, indicating that the presently investigated oil has little or no effect on the two tested compounds even though the polarity of the oil is much less than soil organic matter (SOM). Therefore, specific interactions with the active groups (aromatic and polar domains) are dominantly responsible for the sorption of polar sorbates, and thus their sorption is controlled by available sorption sites. This study showed that the oil has the potential to be a dominant sorptive phase for nonpolar pollutants when compared to SOM, but hardly so for polar compounds. The results may aid in a better understanding of the role of the aliphatic and aromatic domains in sorption of nonpolar and polar organic pollutants.",

The objective of this study was to improve anode performance of a MEC combined anaerobic reactor (R1) for high concentration industrial wastewater treatment via dosing Fe(OH)3. For the first 53 days without power, the addition of Fe(OH)3 in R1 enhanced the degradation of reactive brilliant red X-3B dye and sucrose. Applying a voltage of 0.8 V in R1 resulted in a higher decolorization and COD removal through driving the redox reactions at electrodes under Fe(III)-reducing conditions. Real-time PCR and enzyme activity analysis showed that the abundance and azoreductase activity of bacteria were improved in R1.

TEM observation confirmed that the sizes of the Ag particles were 10-20nm. The investigation of the phenol degradation demonstrated that the photocatalytic (PC) degradation rate of the phenol on the Ag doped BiVO(4) film was enhanced by 1.61 times in PC process and by 42.7 times in photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) process compared with that of the BiVO(4) film. The transportation of the electrons from the BiVO(4) to Ag driven by the schottky barrier formed between Ag and BiVO(4) can increase the charge carrier separation, and consequently enhance the PC performance. The enhancement of the PC ability in PEC process could be attributed to the simultaneous movements of the photogenerated electrons to external circuit and the photogenerated holes to the Ag particles deposited on the BiVO(4) film. In 4h, the elimination efficiency and the TOC removal efficiency of phenol on the Ag doped BiVO(4) film in PEC process were 94.1% and 61.0%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "A novel and promising \u201cturn-on\u201d fluorescent Cu 2+ biosensor is designed based on graphene\u2013DNAzyme catalytic beacon. Due to the essential surface and quenching properties of two-dimensional graphene, it can function as both \u201cscaffold\u201d and \u201cquencher\u201d of the Cu 2+ -dependent DNAzyme, facilitating the formation of self-assembled graphene-quenched DNAzyme complex. However, Cu 2+ -induced catalytic reaction disturbs the graphene\u2013DNAzyme conformation, which will produce internal DNA cleavage-dependent effect. In this case, the quenched fluorescence in graphene\u2013DNAzyme is quickly recovered to a large extent in 15 min. Compared with common DNAzyme-based sensors, the presented graphene-based catalytic beacon greatly improves the signal-to-background ratio, hence increasing the sensitivity (LOD = 0.365 nM). Furthermore, the controllable DNA cleavage reaction provides an original and alternative internal method to regulate the interaction between graphene and DNA relative to the previous external sequence-specific hybridization-dependent regulation, which will open new opportunities for nucleic studies and sensing applications in the future. Keywords Biosensor DNAzyme DNA cleavage Fluorescence Graphene 1 Introduction In recent years, considerable efforts have been devoted to the detection of heavy-metal ions in both the aquatic environment and biological system due to their deleterious effects on public health and ecosystem. Of particular interest is the quantitative analysis of aqueous copper (Cu 2+ or Cu + ). As one of the most important micronutrient elements for human life, low-level copper is essential for biological activities such as enzyme regulation, metabolism and immune function. However, it has been demonstrated that high-level copper exposure can lead to neural disturbance, liver or kidney damage ( Georgopoulos et al., 2001; Zietz et al., 2003 ), as well as serious neurodegenerative diseases ( Brown and Kozlowski, 2004; Vulpe et al., 1993; Waggoner et al., 1999 ), including Menkes and Wilson diseases, hereditary aceruloplasminemia, Alzheimer's disease, and prion diseases. In this regard, it is highly desirable to develop a facile, environment-friendly and high-throughout method for the determination of trace copper with high sensitivity and selectivity to meet the requirements in the fields of environmental monitoring, waste management and biology toxicology. Current protocols for the detection of copper generally require complex laboratory instruments, such as atomic absorption spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, and atomic fluorescence (FL) spectrometry, which realize their excellent performances at the expense of time and elaborate sample preparation or preconcentration processes. In response to these limitations, the past years witnessed great progress in the development of various optical probes for rapid, low-cost and practical detection of copper, such as fluorescent sensors based on organic fluorophores or chromogens ( Wen et al., 2006; Zeng et al., 2006 ), novel-metal nanoclusters ( Chen et al., 2009a; Shang and Dong, 2008 ), luminescent quantum dots or nanorods ( Chan et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010a ), luminescent metal-organic framework ( Chen et al., 2009b ), and colorimetric sensors relied on Au nanoparticles ( Xu et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2008 ) or catalytic carbon nanotube ( Song et al., 2010 ). Nevertheless, most of these strategies still suffer from either limitations with respect to selectivity, water solubility and stability or potential toxicity. Ever since the discovery of DNAzyme ( Breaker and Joyce, 1994 ), great interest has focused on the identification and filtration of the catalytic DNA via in vitro selection process, which exhibits catalytic activity or binding activity in the presence of specific cofactors including inorganic, organic and biomolecules, and even cells or viruses ( Breaker, 1997; Carmi et al., 1996; Li et al., 2000; Li and Lu, 2000; Mei et al., 2003 ). As noted, the binding affinity of DNAzyme was demonstrated to rival protein antibody in terms of specific target molecules. In addition, the cofactor-dependent DNAzymes toward inorganic metal ions make them ideal recognition platforms in sensing resulting from their unique advantages over antibodies, such as facile preparation and outstanding stability under harsh conditions. Therefore, many novel principles based on DNAzyme have been designed to detect Cu 2+ ( Liu and Lu, 2007a, 2007b; Qin et al., 2010a; Wu et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2009 ), Pb 2+ ( Liu and Lu, 2003, 2005; Li et al., 2010a; Wang et al., 2008 ), Hg 2+ ( Liu and Lu, 2007c; Li et al., 2009 ), UO 2 2+ ( Lee et al., 2008; Moshe et al., 2009 ), and K + ( Kong et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010b, 2010c; Qin et al., 2010b ) with high sensitivity and selectivity, producing fluorescent, electrochemical as well as colorimetric outputs. Among them, fluorescent sensors particularly allow a powerful signal for practical on-site and real-time detection with portable fluorimeters. For example, in a typical Cu 2+ -dependent DNAzyme sensor ( Liu and Lu, 2007a ), the fluorophore-labeled substrate strand quenched by a quencher-modified enzyme through energy or electron transfer will irreversibly be cleaved and then released to recover the FL signal in the presence of the target. In this case, it is a big challenge in the design of labeling components and strategies capable of reducing the background signal. In general, most current functional DNAzyme-based sensors require the covalent attachment of two or more quenchers to either the end or the internal site of one DNA strand ( Liu and Lu, 2007a; Mei et al., 2003 ), which will inevitably lead to not only a complicated or expensive operation, but also a weaker performance of DNAzyme in comparison with their label-free analogues. Alternatively, efforts have been made to develop DNAzyme-based label-free fluorescent sensors relied on binding-dependent FL activation and dynamic cleavage activity ( Xiang et al., 2009, 2010; Xu and Lu, 2010 ). Despite of the progress, there is still need to explore other general platforms in label-free sensors that could further improve the signal-to-background ratio, strengthen the binding affinity of organic dyes to DNAzyme, and avoid the introduction of dSpacer into adenosine aptamers ( Xiang et al., 2009 ). Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to search for universal signaling strategies and introduce novel materials to break these limitations in traditional DNAzyme-based sensors. With the tremendous progress in nanotechnology, low-dimensional nanomaterials have emerged as efficient \u201cscaffold\u201d and \u201cquencher\u201d of biomolecules due to their unique surface and electronic properties ( Kata and Willner, 2004; Wang et al., 2009 ). In particular, two-dimensional graphene-based material has shown great potential as novel platform in constructing DNA biosensor by means of strong \u03c0-stacking interactions between the nucleotide bases in single-stranded DNA and the graphene surface ( Dong et al., 2010; He et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2010 ). Besides, graphene-based material can act as highly efficient super-quencher of the fluorophore based on both electron transfer and energy transfer processes, providing a powerful basis for fluorescent sensors. In our previous study, we demonstrated that nano-scale graphene sheet can obscure the traditional donor-to-acceptor distance in a self-assembled fluoroimmunoassay ( Liu et al., 2010b ). In other words, the effective graphene-biomolecule configurations were independent on the size or orientation of donors to a large extent, producing a distance-independent quenching effect. Therefore, taking advantage of the remarkable interaction between two-dimensional graphene and DNA bases, as well as the essential distance-independent quenching effect of graphene, it is possible to explore self-assembled graphene\u2013DNAzyme complex in designing a facile, rapid and sensitive platform for the detection of heavy metal ions. In this study, we presented a general method for \u201cturn-on\u201d DNAzyme catalytic beacon for Cu 2+ ions by employing fluorophore-labeled Cu 2+ -dependent DNAzyme as recognition site and two-dimensional graphene as the FL transduction unit. The key factor was an internal controllable competition that allowed the cleaved DNA liberating from the graphene surface, which provided a vigorous basis for our design. Compared with conventional DNAzyme-based sensors, this novel self-assembled catalytic beacon required only one end labeled fluorophore, which maintained the high catalytic activity of DNAzyme. Furthermore, it improved the signal-to-background ratio due to the exceptional DNA-binding selectivity of graphene. More importantly, we demonstrated that the graphene\u2013DNA interaction could also be readily tuned by the dynamic cleavage of DNA relative to external sequence-specific hybridization-dependent graphene\u2013DNA interaction in common graphene-based sensing platform, thus opening new opportunities for the design and engineering of graphene\u2013DNA complex-based applications. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials and reagents The nucleic acids Cu-Sub (5\u2032-T 10 AGCTTCTTTCTAATACGGCTTACC-FAM-3\u2032) and Cu-Enz (5\u2032-GGTAAGCCTGGGCCTCTTTCTTTTTAAGAAAGAAC-3\u2032) were purchased from Takara Biotechnology Co. (Dalian, China) and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). KMnO 4 , NaCl, CdCl 2 , CuCl 2 , Pb(NO 3 ) 2 , ZnCl 2 , CaCl 2 , FeCl 3 , MnCl 2 , BaCl 2 and CoCl 2 were of analytical reagent grade and purchased from the Kemiou Agent Co., Tianjin, China. Sodium ascorbate was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China). Other reagents such as NaOH, HCl, HNO 3 , H 2 O 2 (30%), acetone and anhydrous ethanol were used as received without any further treatment. Ultrapure water obtained from a Millipore water purification system (resistivity >18.0 M\u03a9 cm \u22121 , Laikie Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) was used throughout. All the glassware was first cleaned with a mixture of HCl and HNO 3 (ratio of HCl/HNO 3 = 3:1 in volume) and thoroughly rinsed with ultrapure water. Phosphate buffer solution (PBS, 0.05 M) with various pH values was prepared by mixing the stock solution of Na 2 HPO 4 and NaH 2 PO 4 with different volume ratios. 2.2 Instruments Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out on Agilent PicoPlus II. The AFM sample was prepared by casting 5 \u03bcL of graphene dispersion on a freshly-cleaved mica surface. FL measurements were performed using Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer with a scan rate at 1200 nm/min. The excitation wavelength was set at 494 nm, and the photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage was 700 V. The slits for excitation and emission were set at 5 nm/10 nm. The FT-IR measurements on powdered samples were made using a Bruker VERTEX 70 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer in transmission mode with a KBr window. The Raman spectra were obtained by a Renishaw Micro-Raman System 2000 Spectrometer operated at He\u2013Ne laser excitation (wavelength 623.8 nm; laser power 35 mW) with a beam spot size of about 2 \u03bcm. 2.3 Preparation of graphene oxide and graphene sheet Graphene oxides (GO) were prepared by our previously reported method ( Liu et al., 2010b ). Briefly, graphite powder (1.0 g) was first dispersed in concentrated H 2 SO 4 (23 mL) at room temperature. KMnO 4 (3 g) was then added gradually under stirring at 0 \u00b0C. Successively, the mixture was sonicated for 6 h to give a dark green solution. Afterward, ultrapure water (46 mL) was slowly transferred to the mixture. After keeping boiling for 30 min, the reaction was then terminated by adding ultrapure water (140 mL) and H 2 O 2 solution (30%, 10 mL). Finally, the resultant yellow product was separated by centrifugation, and washed with 5% HCl solution and ultrapure water, sequently. An environment-friendly hydrothermal route was employed to convert graphene oxide to graphene ( Zhou et al., 2009 ). The obtained graphene sheet could be readily dispersed in water due to the residually carboxylic acid groups at the edges ( Li et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2008 ). The resultant aqueous dispersion of graphene (0.12 mg/mL) was stored at room temperature and employed in the following work. 2.4 Preparation of DNAzyme To form the Cu 2+ -dependent DNAzyme, 2 \u03bcM Cu-Sub and 2 \u03bcM Cu-Enz were annealed in a buffer containing 50 mM PBS, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.0. The mixture was warmed to 95 \u00b0C for 1 min in a water bath and subsequently allowed to cool naturally to room temperature. The resultant DNAzymes were stored in a 4 \u00b0C dark room. 2.5 FL assay of Cu 2+ In a typical experiment, 380 \u03bcL of buffer (50 mM PBS, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), 10 \u03bcL of DNAzyme, 20 \u03bcL of sodium ascorbate (5 mM) and 80 \u03bcL of graphene solution (0.12 mg/mL) were sequentially added into a microcentrifuge tube. After 30 min reaction, the solution was transferred to a quartz cell at room temperature. Subsequently, 10 \u03bcL of Cu 2+ stock solution was added to the mixture for time-dependent FL measurement at \u03bb ex / \u03bb em = 494/518 nm. 2.6 Electrophoresis analysis Cu 2+ -dependent DNAzymes before and after the catalytic reaction were respectively loaded onto 6\u00d7 loading buffer containing 30 mM EDTA, 36% (v/v) Glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) Xylene Cyanol FF, and 0.05% (w/v) Bromophenol blue, pH 7.0. The samples were then put on a 20% polyacrylamide gel in a 1\u00d7 TAE buffer (40 mM Tris acetate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.5) followed by electrophoresis for 180 min at 60 V to separate cleaved DNA. After ethidium bromide staining, the gel was imaged using a G: BOX HR system (Gene Co., Ltd.). 2.7 Analysis of drinking water samples A series of testing samples were prepared by mixing drinking water with standard Cu 2+ solution. The samples (10 \u03bcL) were then added to graphene\u2013DNAzyme solution (total volume, 500 \u03bcL) containing 50 mM PBS (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM sodium ascorbate and 19.2 \u03bcg/mL graphene. Subsequently, time-dependent FL measurements were recorded at \u03bb ex / \u03bb em = 494/518 nm. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Design strategy An ideal DNAzyme catalytic beacon should provide a low FL background by employing effective quenchers, further enabling the prompt separation of the cleaved substrate during the cleavage reaction. In order to achieve the above sensing performance, we designed a novel catalytic beacon for Cu 2+ as shown in Fig. 1 . The system was a combination of two components that formed a self-assembled complex. The first component was the Cu 2+ -dependent DNAzyme containing a 3\u2032-FAM-modified Cu-Sub and a Cu-Enz, which served as an effective recognition site. As noted, there was no additional labeled quencher in the DNAzyme. The second component was the FL transduction unit of graphene, which was employed as an independent quencher to suppress background signal. Initially, despite of the DNAzyme containing engineered duplex and triplex regions or structures, optimum amount of graphene guaranteed the fluorophore in close proximity to the graphene surface, facilitating the following complete quenching. In the presence of Cu 2+ , the DNA substrate was irreversibly cleaved as a result of the specific DNAzyme\u2013Cu 2+ interaction, thus disturbing the self-assembled graphene\u2013DNAzyme conformation. In such a case, the \u201creleased\u201d FAM-labeled DNA strand in turn produced a concentration-dependent FL signal. Compared with the normal DNAzyme-based designs, it was apparent that this strategy provided a robust and cost-effective construction by utilizing both the intrinsic advantage of two-dimensional graphene and catalytic DNA. 3.2 Characterization of graphene sheet AFM was employed to characterize the morphology and thickness of a graphene sheet. A typical AFM image showed a high-quality single-layer graphene sheet with the lateral width of hundreds nanometers and the relatively low amount of defects or disorders (Fig. S1A In Supplementary Material) . The cross-section of a AFM image indicated that the resultant graphene sheet was with an average height of 10 \u00c5 ( Fig. S1B ), which was consistent with the single-layer graphene of 0.8\u20131.2 nm reported by other groups ( Cote et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2010 ). The FT-IR spectroscopy and Raman spectrum further provided the information of graphene. As shown in Fig. S1C , functional groups of GO were observed in FT-IR spectrum, which displayed the presence of O\u2013H (3400 cm \u22121 ), C O (1733 cm \u22121 ), C C (1625 cm \u22121 ), and C\u2013O (1070 cm \u22121 ). After hydrothermal reduction, most oxygen-containing groups decreased dramatically and even disappeared entirely. In addition, two typical peaks at 1340 and 1590 cm \u22121 appeared ( Fig. S1D ), which could be assigned to the D-band (the symmetry A 1g mode) and G-band (the E 2g mode of sp 2 carbon atoms) in graphene, respectively. Taken together, these results suggested that GO were successfully reduced into graphene by a simple hydrothermal dehydration route. 3.3 DNA cleavage-dependent graphene\u2013DNA interaction Earlier studies demonstrated that graphene-based material possessed different adsorption affinity for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) ( He et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2009 ), which led to the differences in quenching efficiency and FL signals. Interestingly, we observed that the FL of FAM-modified DNAzyme was effectively quenched by graphene as well, although the DNAzyme was composed of engineered duplex and triplex elements. Fig. 2 A showed the FL emission spectra of DNAzyme under different conditions. Upon excitation at 494 nm, FAM-labeled DNAzyme remained strong FL intensity in PBS buffer solution. As expected, over 99% FL was quenched with the presence of 19.2 \u03bcg/mL of graphene, suggesting the formation of self-assembled graphene\u2013DNAzyme complex ( Lu et al., 2009 ), which then brought the FAM and the graphene surface in close proximity. As shown in Fig. 2 B, both the quenching kinetics rate and the quenching efficiency were depended on the concentration of graphene. Furthermore, the quenching reaction reached equilibrium only in several minutes, indicating the high self-assembled rate of the DNAzyme on graphene. To demonstrate the potential use of self-assembled graphene-quenched Cu 2+ -dependent DNAzyme in the detection of Cu 2+ , FL response was investigated in the presence of the target. Fig. 2 C showed the kinetics of FL enhancement as a function of reaction time, displaying an increasing rate with higher concentrations of Cu 2+ . Moreover, a 32-fold FL enhancement comparable to the original intensity was observed when the concentration of Cu 2+ reached 1 \u03bcM, probably due to the Cu 2+ -induced catalytic cleavage of DNAzyme and the following release of FAM-labeled DNA strands. As noted, the enhancement is much higher than the 13-fold enhancement of the catalytic beacon with dual quenchers ( Liu and Lu, 2007a ), demonstrating that graphene-quenched DNAzyme approach could potentially improve the sensitivity in the catalytic beacon for Cu 2+ determination. It was well-known that both zero-dimensional Au nanoparticles (NPs) ( Jennings et al., 2006; Singh and Strouse, 2010; Yun et al., 2005 ) and one-dimensional carbon nanotubes ( Liu et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2008a, 2008b; Zhang et al., 2010a ) were successfully applied as excellent FL acceptors or quenchers for organic fluorophore or inorganic luminescent nanomaterial in fluorescent assay. Furthermore, the differences in the adsorption properties of either Au NPs or carbon nanotubes toward ssDNA and dsDNA offered the basis for their applications in molecular beacon and DNA sensing ( Jeng et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2008b ). At this point, the performance of the two-dimensional graphene-based material was similar to that of Au NPs or carbon nanotubes. Nevertheless, it was observed that the interaction between Au NPs and DNA was inherently dependent on the dipole orientation of zero-dimensional Au NPs as well as the DNA configuration ( Kim et al., 2006; Saini et al., 2009 ). As a result, further development of Au NPs-based assay was hampered by its dependence on donor-acceptor distance, beyond which the transfer rate and quenching efficiency were dramatically reduced. The quenching behavior of one-dimensional carbon nanotube and graphene were also compared as follows. In general, the adsorption rate of DNA on the surface of carbon nanotube was slow at room temperature ( Yang et al., 2008a, 2008b ). Therefore, a best quenching efficiency was obtained almost in 1 h ( Yang et al., 2008a ), hindering its further application as a general platform. Moreover, due to the one-dimensional surface effect of the carbon nanotube, the interaction between DNA (especially for hairpin-structured DNA) and carbon nanotube was dependent on the DNA configuration ( Yang et al., 2008b ), hence limiting the quenching behavior as well as the quenching efficiency in the self-assembled carbon nanotube-DNA complex. In direct contrast, the graphene-based material not only provided better quenching behavior but also improved the sensing performance, which resulted from its distance-independent quenching effect and two-dimensional surface effect ( Liu et al., 2010b; Lu et al., 2009 ). To confirm that the above FL changes of DNAzyme were due to the Cu 2+ -catalyzed cleavage reaction, gel-electrophoresis was carried out to measure the activity of 1 \u03bcM DNAzyme in the presence of 25 \u03bcM Cu 2+ . As shown in Fig. 2 D, DNA bands were well-separated after the addition of Cu 2+ , indicating the effective cleavage reaction ( Liu and Lu, 2007a ). Considering the interaction between graphene and DNA, it could be concluded that a two-step process, including DNA cleavage and graphene/DNA adsorption, happened in the presence of the target. In principle, the FL of cleaved DNA should be quenched completely due to the \u03c0-stacking interaction between graphene and DNA ( Dong et al., 2010; He et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2010 ). While in reality, the quenched FL in graphene\u2013DNAzyme was quickly recovered to a large extent in 15 min, implying that cleaved DNA was liberated from the graphene surface during the catalytic reaction. Therefore, we drew a conclusion that the DNA cleavage rate was significantly higher than the binding rate of DNA strand with graphene, resulting in the released FAM-modified DNA. We believed that the surface effect of graphene and DNA cleavage-dependent effect contributed to the basis of our proposed design. Remarkably, this DNA-cleavage-dependent effect in self-assembled graphene\u2013DNA complex provided an internal method to regulate the interaction between graphene and DNA. In comparison with the external competition-dependent effect in previously reported graphene\u2013DNA-based platform ( Dong et al., 2010; He et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2010 ), the alternative and controllable internal competition-dependent effect in graphene\u2013DNA complex was expected to extend its applications (especially for the situation not suitable to pose an external competition) in the future. 3.4 Sensor optimization We employed signal-to-background ratio (S/B) to reflect the sensing performance in different systems ( Liu et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2008a ). The S/B was defined as ( F 1 \u2212 F buffer )/( F 0 \u2212 F buffer ), where F 1 , F 0 , and F buffer were the FL intensities of the probe-target hybrid, probe without target and buffer solution, respectively. The ratio between Cu-Sub and Cu-Enz in DNAzyme was first optimized to obtain the best sensing performance. As shown in Fig. S2A (In Supplementary Material) , a decrease of the ratio of Cu-Enz in DNAzyme (ratios 2:1, 3:2 and 1:1) resulted in a gradual decrease of background signal, and an increase of S/B, implying that optimal ratio of Cu-Enz could facilitate the interaction of the DNAzyme with graphene. For example, a S/B as high as 21.2 was obtained with the 1:1 Cu-Enz to Cu-Sub ratio. However, further reducing the Cu-Enz affected the DNAzyme performance, resulting in slow catalytic kinetics and decreased S/B ( Fig. S2B ). pH was also one of the most important parameters in the catalytic reaction. As shown in Fig. S3A (In Supplementary Material) , the kinetics rates of FL enhancement increased when the pH ranged from 6.0 to 7.4, and then decreased when pH further increased to 8.0, in accordance with the trends of S/B ( Fig. S3C ). It was reported that DNAzyme-based biosensors were effective in neutral pH ( Xiang et al., 2009, 2010; Zhang et al., 2010b ). In addition, it was well-known that FL intensity of FAM increased with the increasing pH ( Fig. S3B ). Consequently, we attributed the FL enhancement at pH 7.4 to the effect of pH-dependent FAM. The concentration of salt was another key factor in optimal sensor due to its effects on the catalytic activity of DNAzyme and the stability of graphene ( Fig. S4A ). As shown in Fig. S4B (In Supplementary Material) , the S/B increased to 19.7 with the salt concentration increasing from 0 mM to 50 mM, and then decreased to 11.75 when the salt concentration was up to 100 mM. On the basis of these results, a Cu 2+ -dependent DNAzyme with the 1:1 Cu-Enz to Cu-Sub ratio in a pH 7.4 PBS buffer solution containing 50 mM NaCl was selected for the following experiments. 3.5 Sensor performance Under the optimal condition, the sensitivity and selectivity of the sensor were investigated, respectively. A kinetics study was carried out to record the time-dependent FL changes at 518 nm after the addition of various amounts of Cu 2+ . As shown in Fig. 3 A , the FL intensity gradually increased with the reaction time. Furthermore, the kinetics of FL enhancement was indeed dependent on the concentration of Cu 2+ . Fig. 3 B presented the calibration curve of the sensor in the range from 0.01 to 1.5 \u03bcM. For the control experiment, no FL enhancement was observed in the absence of the target. The detection limit was determined to be 0.365 nM on the basis of the 3 \u03c3 /slope ( Fig. 3 C), which was much lower than that of previously reported DNAzyme-based copper sensor ( Liu and Lu, 2007a, 2007b; Qin et al., 2010a; Wu et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2009 ), and at least 95 times lower compared to that of dual quenchers labeled sensors ( Liu and Lu, 2007a ). We believed that the excellent quenching behavior of graphene and DNA cleavage-dependent effect were the main contributors to the better sensitivity. To understand the selectivity of the system, we measured its response in the environmentally relevant ionic species including Ba 2+ , Ca 2+ , Cd 2+ , Fe 3+ , Mn 2+ , Pb 2+ , Zn 2+ , Co 2+ with the concentrations of 0.1 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM ( Fig. 3 D). The results revealed that the competitive metal ions yielded only minimal responses even at relatively high concentration levels, indicating that this method had good selectivity, which was comparable with the selectivity of the original Cu 2+ -dependent DNAzyme sensor. 3.6 Sensor application To explore the practicality of the present approach, the designed self-assembled graphene\u2013DNAzyme complex was used to analyze Cu 2+ in drinking water. We first obtained a linear correlation ( R = 0.997) between the FL response and the concentration of Cu 2+ in the drinking water ( Fig. S5, In Supplementary Material ). Then two prepared samples with as-known concentration were tested to evaluate the feasibility of the approach ( Fig. S6 ). As shown in Table S1 (In Supplementary Material) , the self-assembled graphene\u2013DNAzyme catalytic beacon provided recoveries of 94.3\u2013103%, suggesting that our graphene-quenched DNAzyme system was successful in detection of Cu 2+ in environmental samples. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, we designed a promising self-assembled graphene\u2013DNAzyme catalytic beacon for Cu 2+ based on internal DNA cleavage-dependent graphene\u2013DNA interaction. Due to the intrinsic advantage of two-dimensional graphene and the catalytic activity of Cu 2+ -dependent DNAzyme, the novel catalytic beacon not only provided convenient protocol but also effectively increased the sensitivity in environmental monitoring. Future experiments that further improve the sensitivity are being conducted. Moreover, the internal and controllable competition between graphene and DNA was presented, which will open new opportunities for the development of extended system in molecular engineering and biosensor design.

        "title": "Amperometric determination of chemical oxygen demand using boron-doped diamond (BDD) sensor",
        "abstract": "A new application of boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode was developed for detecting chemical oxygen demand (COD) by amperometric method. The effects of some basic experimental parameters including pH and applied potential on the response of the BDD electrode were investigated and the optimal operating conditions were obtained. In the COD tests of standard samples, a wide linear range of 20\u20139000 mg l \u22121 COD and a low detection limit of 7.5 mg l \u22121 COD were well established with the present approach. Additionally, the BDD sensor was successfully employed to determine the COD of real samples from various chemical or pharmaceutical wastewaters and the performance still kept stable after over 400 measurements. The results obtained indicated that, as compared with the conventional COD determination techniques, the proposed sensor was an environmentally friendly method with the advantages of short analysis period, simplicity, and no requirement of complicated sample pretreatment even for a sample containing relatively high concentration of organic pollutants. Keywords Boron-doped diamond (BDD) Chemical oxygen demand (COD) Amperometric determination Sensor Wide linear range 1 Introduction Chemical oxygen demand (COD) is widely used as a very important parameter in environmental monitoring. However, the conventional dichromate method for COD test suffers from several inherent drawbacks, for instance, time consuming process, requirement of a skilled operator in order to minimize handling errors, incomplete oxidation of volatile compounds, and consumption of expensive (Ag 2 SO 4 ) and toxic (Cr and Hg) chemicals. In view of these disadvantages in the conventional COD test, huge effort was made to develop other suitable methods, among which the electrochemical method was received great attention [1\u20133] . Although the electrodes investigated in the past were successfully used to detect COD as far as the detection speed and simplicity were concerned, their applications in practice may be limited by the low efficiency and the risk of toxic metal ion leaching (e.g. lead). Recently, boron-doped diamond (BDD) thin film electrodes have been investigated extensively [4] . As compared with other conventional electrodes, the BDD electrode owns four advantages [5,6] : (i) wide electrochemical working potential window in aqueous electrolyte; (ii) high mechanical strength and corrosion resistance (even anodic polarization in acidic solutions); (iii) high resistance to deactivation by impurities and long term response stability; and (iv) low and stable voltammetric background current. Furthermore, in point of environmental protection, the BDD electrode is relatively friendly. Numbers of studies have been carried out with BDD electrodes to investigate the electrochemical behavior of different kinds of pollutants in aqueous phase, such as phenolic compounds [7\u201310] , nitrogen-containing inorganic chemicals [11\u201314] , pesticides and pharmaceuticals [15\u201317] , endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) [18] , surfactants [19] , dyes [20] , chemical intermediates [21] , carboxylic acids [22,23] , amino acids [24] , organic soluble polymers [25] , etc. All of these works demonstrated that the BDD film is excellent electrode material and being used more extensively in the fields of electrochemistry and environmental science. However, most researches were carried out for the purpose of either wastewater treatment or analysis of single toxic substance. To the best of our knowledge, no report with respect to COD detection using BDD has been presented so far. The aim of this study was (i) to investigate the feasibility of using the BDD electrode to detect COD, (ii) to study the effects of pH and applied potential on the performance of this BDD sensor, and (iii) to compare the BDD sensor and the conventional dichromate method by detecting the COD values of synthetic and real wastewater samples. This innovative idea may be contributive to the rapid and efficient development of the method for COD tests. 2 Experimental 2.1 Reagents and materials Nine organic compounds were selected as standard samples, which were classified to three types: the first one was calibration standard samples often used for COD analysis [26] : glucose, potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP), and glutamic acid; the second one was pollutants usually exiting in chemical or pharmaceutical wastewater: phenol, p- nitrophenol (PNP), salicylic acid, and cysteamine; the last one was intermediate products during electrolysis of organic contaminants: oxalic acid and acetic acid (the corresponding sodium salts were used in our experiments). All the reagents purchased from Tianjin Bodi Chemieals Co., China, were of analytical reagent grade and were used without further purification. All the solutions were prepared using water of 18 M\u03a9 cm purified by a Milli-Q purification system. BDD film was synthesized by the hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HF CVD) technique on a Ti substrate. As a source gas, the mixture of ultrahigh purity (99.999%) methane and hydrogen (1% CH 4 in H 2 ) was supplied to the reaction chamber at a flow rate of 200 sccm. B 2 H 6 diluted in H 2 was employed as a boron doping agent at a concentration of 10 ppm. The deposition time was 12 h. 2.2 Apparatus The general morphology of the BDD film was characterized using environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM; Quanta 200 FEG). The Raman spectrum was obtained using a Renishaw Micro-Raman System 2000 Spectrometer operated at He\u2013Ne laser excitation (wavelengths 623.8 nm; laser power 35 mW) with a beam spot size of about 2 \u03bcm. All the electrochemical experiments were performed on an electrochemical system (CH Instruments 650B, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co. Ltd., China) at room temperature (about 20 \u00b0C) in a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell (5 cm depth and 3 cm in diameter) with the BDD film on titanium substrate as the working electrode, and the effective area is 0.5 cm 2 . A platinum foil and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were as the auxiliary and reference electrode, respectively. 2.3 Procedure of electrochemical measurements The electrochemical measurements were carried out in 10 ml of sodium sulfate (0.1 M) solution stirred by a magnetic stirrer. The pH value was 2 unless otherwise specified. When a proper potential bias was applied, the blank current was allowed to reach a steady state in 100 s, and then the corresponding increase in current could be obtained by injecting aliquots of wastewater samples. The measured net increase in current could be converted into the equivalent COD according to the calibration curve determined with synthetic samples. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Reaction mechanism and detection principle According to the generalized mechanism, in the first step, H 2 O is discharged at the anode to produce physisorbed \u201cactive oxygen\u201d (hydroxyl radicals) on the surface of BDD electrode [27,28] (1) BDD [ ] + H 2 O \u2192 k 1 BDD ( OH ) + H + + e - In Eq. (1) , BDD[ ] represents unoccupied surface sites where the discharge reaction is assumed to be constant and the back reaction for H 2 O discharge is ignored; k 1 is the electrochemical rate constant for H 2 O discharge; BDD( OH) corresponds to adsorbed hydroxyl radicals. Hydroxyl radical is a non-selective, very powerful oxidizing agent and is able to react with organic pollutants giving dehydrogenated or hydroxylated derivatives till the complete mineralization (i.e., CO 2 , water and inorganic ions) is reached, which is commonly named electrochemical combustion or incineration [28\u201330] . (2) R + BDD ( OH ) \u2192 k 2 BDD [ ] + CO 2 + H 2 O + \u22ef where R is the reactant and k 2 is the electrochemical rate constant for the combustion of organics. In case I, k 1 \u226b k 2 c R , the available hydroxyl radicals are enough for the combustion of the reactant. Accordingly, an equation can be derived as follows [28,31] : (3) I = nFAk 2 Z c c R where n is the number of involved electrons, F is the Faraday constant, A is the area of BDD electrode, Z c is the stoichiometry factor for the complete combustion of organics, and c R is the surface concentration of the reactant. Since one oxygen molecule is equivalent to four transferred electrons and, according to COD definition, the nc R can be substituted by COD/8000, in which 8000 is a dimensional factor (32000 mg O 2 mol \u22121 O 2 /4 mol e mol \u22121 O 2 ). Therefore, Eq. (3) can be rewritten as (4) I = FAk 2 Z c COD / 8000 In case II, k 1 \u226a k 2 c R , the total reaction is controlled in the mechanism of Eq. (1) and the current I total become saturated because of insufficiency of the physisorbed hydroxyl radicals. According to Popovi\u0107 and Johnson [32] , I total can be simplified to the form as given by (5) I total = 2 FAk 1 \u0393 0 where \u0393 0 is the density of surface sites available for adsorption of OH. Based on the presentation above, it is known that the current of the working electrode will change proportionally with the concentration of the reactant or COD as long as the physisorbed hydroxyl radicals are sufficient for the reaction in Eq. (2) 3.2 Characterization of BDD film Fig. 1 displays a typical scanning electron micrograph of the BDD film that was composed of well faceted diamond crystals ranging in diameter from 0.5 to 1.5 \u03bcm. The film appeared to be continuous and uniform over the entire substrate surface without any noticeable cracks, which could ensure high electrochemical stability of the BDD electrode. Raman spectroscopy was often employed to evaluate the quality of diamond film. As shown in Fig. 1 (inset), the film used in this work exhibited a typical crystalline diamond band at 1333 cm \u22121 . The Raman cross-sectional scattering coefficients for graphite (500 \u00d7 10 \u22127 cm \u22121 /sr) were over 50 times higher than those for diamond (9 \u00d7 10 \u22127 cm \u22121 /sr) [33] , therefore, the film possessed good quality despite the existence of a broad band near 1500 cm \u22121 resulting from scattering by amorphous or graphitic sp 2 carbon impurities incorporated into the film. 3.3 Optimization of operating conditions 3.3.1 pH Although the BDD electrode was successfully used for electrooxidation of organic compounds at different pH [34] , the controlled experiments were conducted in 10 ml of 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte under an applied potential of 2.5 V (vs. SCE) to investigate the effect of pH value on the analytical performance of the BDD sensor and to choose the best pH condition for COD tests. \u0394 I was defined as the net increase in current caused by injecting aliquot of organic matter and the increase of 100 \u03bcM glucose was used here. As found in the experiments, \u0394 I went up slightly from 79.5 \u03bcA at pH 1 to 80.5 \u03bcA at pH 3 and further to 93.7 \u03bcA at pH 7. This was because the higher the pH value was adjusted, the more readily hydroxide ions and water were oxidized to generate hydroxyl radicals, and the more organic matter would be decomposed to contribute the ascend of \u0394 I . At the same time, the over potential for oxygen evolution would be lowered when the solution became more alkaline, which could be known from the cyclic voltammograms measured at different pH value (data not shown), and then the oxygen evolution gradually turned into the main reaction. Thus \u0394 I declined from 93.7 \u03bcA at pH 7 to 72.4 \u03bcA at pH 11 and, especially at pH 11, lots of gas bubbles were observed rising on the surface of the BDD electrode and the current signals was disrupted greatly. The discussions above could be confirmed further by the phenomenon that although a slight decrease in \u0394 I was obtained at pH 11, the corresponding background current was twice the value observed at pH 1, reaching about 720 \u03bcA. Under a given applied potential of 2.5 V (vs. SCE) in this part of experiments, a large amount of evolved oxygen at relatively high pH value prevented accurate and reproducible measurement of COD. Consequently, pH 2 was selected in the following studies. 3.3.2 Applied potential In order to screen out an appropriate potential for COD measurement, a series of amperometric experiments were performed by the increase of 50 \u03bcM glucose in 10 ml of 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 (pH 2) solution under different applied potentials. The results indicated that \u0394 I increased dramatically from 0 \u03bcA under potential of 2.1 V to 69.4 \u03bcA under potential of 2.6 V (vs. SCE). In fact, the background current was rather low (<2 \u03bcA) under potential of 2.1 V (vs. SCE), which was an advantage of the BDD electrode in analytical application, yet the BDD sensor had no response to aliquots of glucose. Things were different to the potential ranging from 2.2 V to 2.5 V (vs. SCE). The BDD sensor worked stably and \u0394 I was almost linear with the variation of applied potential. Besides, in spite of the highest \u0394 I obtained under potential of 2.6 V (vs. SCE), the great disturbance caused by the drastic oxygen evolution was a broad hint of bad reproducibility and indicated that the potential of 2.6 V (vs. SCE) or more was not favorable to use for the determination of COD because, as we know, both high sensitive responses and stable signals were usually indispensable for precise analysis. Compared with the effect of pH on the background current, the function of applied potential appeared more important. The background current varied greatly from 10 \u03bcA measured at 2.2 V (vs. SCE), at which the signals of \u0394 I came into existence, to 820 \u03bcA detected at 2.6 V (vs. SCE). As discussed above, the sensitivity and reproducibility of the BDD sensor were influenced directly by applied potential. So, on the premise of stable operation, the applied potential should be set as high as possible in order to achieve good response signals and avoid electrode fouling [29] . In the subsequent experiments, a potential bias of 2.5 V (vs. SCE) was employed. 3.4 Amperometric response, reproducibility and stability Fig. 2 illustrates a typical amperometric response of the BDD sensor at 2.5 V (vs. SCE) to the successive increase of glucose. The electrolyte was 10 ml of 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 (pH 2). At first, a steady state background current was attained in 100 s, and then several well-defined oxidation current signals proportional to the concentration of glucose were detected. The BDD sensor had a quick response to the addition of samples, and 95% steady state current could be reached normally in about 15 s. The total analysis of one sample took about 2\u20133 min. As compared with the conventional method, the time consumed here was quite short. In addition, a good reproducibility of this BDD sensor was assayed by the small relative standard deviation (RSD) of current changes (1.87%) resulting from the increase of 50 \u03bcM glucose ( n = 13). Furthermore, the BDD sensor still performed stably after over 400 COD tests during a period of 20 days. The current response to 50 \u03bcM glucose ( n = 5) varied by 6.24% with the RSD of 4.13%. 3.5 Linearity and detection limit The evaluations of linear range and detection limit were carried out using three types of organic compounds as standard samples containing a known theoretical oxygen demand (ThOD). Firstly, the calibration plot of \u0394 I and ThOD of standard samples in electrochemical cell is given in Fig. 3 and the regression equation was y = 3.828 x , R = 0.9976 ( n = 44). It could be known from the slope of regression line that a high response current to the unit ThOD, 3.8 \u03bcA/1 mg l \u22121 ThOD, could be obtained. In addition, a good agreement between all data and the regression line indicated that the COD measurements by the BDD sensor were almost independent of the type of organic species employed here. Based on the calibration plot above and the proportion of injected sample volume in the electrolyte, \u0394 I could be easily converted into the corresponding ThOD of the tested sample. The correlation between ThOD of synthetic samples determined by the BDD sensor and the corresponding COD measured by the conventional dichromate method is shown in Fig. 4 , in which a significant linear relationship was illustrated. Obviously, the COD of a given sample should be equal to ThOD, determined by the BDD sensor, divided by the correction coefficient of 1.095 (the slope of regression line in Fig. 4 ). Consequently, the linear range of COD test by the proposed method was from 20 mg l \u22121 to 9000 mg l \u22121 COD, and the detection limit was 7.5 mg l \u22121 COD ( S / N = 3). 3.6 Analysis of real samples A comparison between the BDD sensor and the conventional dichromate method for the COD measurements was also evaluated using real wastewater samples from chemical manufacture and pharmaceutical factory. The results given in Table 1 showed that all the relative errors calculated from the COD values determined by the proposed sensor and the dichromate method were around \u00b16.0%. It was believed that these two methods agreed well. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, as a promising material extensively utilized for electroanalysis, the BDD electrode was for the first time developed for a new application to COD tests by amperometric method. In this work, a pH of 2 and an applied potential of 2.5 V (vs. SCE) were optimal conditions, under which the resulting BDD sensor was successfully employed to measure the COD of both synthetic samples and real wastewater samples. The results obtained demonstrated that the total assay for one sample could be completed in a short time period. As compared with the conventional method, the approach described here was easier to operate. Moreover, it was an environmentally friendly method without toxic matter discharged after COD tests. With a good prospect in the field of environmental monitoring, the present protocol provided a simple and robust method for rapidly detecting COD, especially, of industrial wastewater and inlet or outlet wastewater from sewage treatment plant.

        "title": "Generation of hydroxyl radical in aqueous solution by microwave energy using activated carbon as catalyst and its potential in removal of persistent organic substances",
        "abstract": "A novel and rapid method for sequential generation of OH in aqueous solution using microwave energy was presented. Dose of activated carbon, air supply, and MW power proved to be key factors influencing OH generation. About 72\u2013100% degradation (corresponding to 40% and 82% TOC removal) was observed in 60 min for two levels of PCP concentrations (500 and 2000 mg/L). Abstract Salicylic acid (SA, hydroxybenzoic acid) was used as molecular probe to determine hydroxyl radical ( OH) in aqueous solutions, where microwave (MW) radiation was involved and activated carbon (AC) existed. Rapid reaction of OH with SA produced a stable fluorescence product, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA) as well as its homologue, 2,5-DHBA, which were determined by HPLC. Dose of AC, air supply, and MW power proved to be key factors influencing OH generation under MW radiation. The rate of OH generation reached 0.036 \u03bcmol s \u22121 , and the OH yield reached 3.2 \u03bcmol in 3 min under a given condition. OH is an active species with high oxidative activity and can initiate free radical reactions. Another experiment was carried out to confirm that organic substance may degrade in aqueous solution by the MW assisted catalytic process. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was used as target. Results showed that nearly 72\u2013100% degradation (corresponding to 40% and 82% TOC removal) was observed in 60 min for two levels of PCP concentrations (500 and 2000 mg L \u22121 ), which implies that continuous production of OH during MW radiation supports free radical reactions that benefit PCP degradation. Keywords Microwave Hydroxyl radical Oxidation Degradation Activated carbon 1 Introduction The investigation on functions and mechanisms of hydroxyl radical ( OH) has attracted more and more attentions because its active reactivity in a number of chemical and biological reactions, which occur in the natural and artificial processes [1,2] . The existence of OH in the aquatic systems and the atmospheric phase has been universally believed [3,4] . Its existence in the environment can greatly influence the fate of many natural and artificial substances that co-exist [5] . AOP (advanced oxidation processes) is an example of the artificial processes, which were specially designed to utilize mainly OH species for decomposition of non-biodegradable organic substances. In a conventional AOP process, oxidizing agents, such as H 2 O 2 and O 3 are applied. They can induce the generation of OH and other oxidative free radicals in the presence of catalysts or UV light. These oxidative free radicals have strong capacity to oxidize organic substances even into the degree of mineralization. However, these processes are not suitable for the treatment of heavily contaminated water. Wet air oxidation (WAO) or called catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) in the case of catalysts presence, is another effective and extensively used process to treat heavily polluted industrial effluents. The apparent characteristic of the process is that oxygen comes from the air, and used as oxidant source. The oxygen can induce reactions of free radicals (such as OH) under high temperature (150\u2013350 \u00b0C) and high pressure (5\u201320 MPa) [6] . In the ideal case, oxidation of organic compounds would only produce CO 2 , H 2 O, N 2 and other mineralized substances. However, WAO or CWAO is restricted in practical application due to its severe operation conditions and high operation expenses. Microwave (MW) is an energy composed of an electric field and magnetic field. It is a form of electromagnetic waves with the wavelengths of 1 mm\u20131 m (frequency 300 MHz\u2013300 GHz) [7] . The electric field interacts with polar materials and the magnetic field reacts with magnetic or charged materials. In recent years, the enhancement of chemical reactions by MW energy has become a very attractive method in synthetic organic chemistry because of its great capability to accelerate reactions and to improve yields and selectivity [8] . MW has also been found its application in the environmental field. Abramovitch et al. proved the rapid decompositions of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soils under the existence of MW absorption or conduction materials [9,10] . In the processes, thermal cracking, caused by locally superheating by MW energy around MW absorption or conduction materials, was possibly a dominating mechanism. MW energy was reported to enhance the generation of OH in aqueous solution irradiated by UV light [11] . We believe that UV, not MW induced OH because UV has the energy of 4.1 eV, which can cause chemical bond cleaving, while MW has only of 10 \u22123 eV [12] , which is not sufficient to cleave chemical bonds. However, proper designs of experiments are foreseen to be possible to generate OH indirectly in an aqueous solution using MW energy with the presence of proper material that has excellent capability for MW absorbing and converting it to heat. The realization of this consideration may find its significance in the fields of green chemical synthesis and pollution control. For example, we can perform CWAO process more rapidly under milder condition (low bulk temperature and even under normal pressure) using MW assisted method. The objectives of this work are to investigate the feasibility of OH generation in aqueous solution using MW energy as sole energy source, and to determine the factors associated with its generation, as well as its role in the treatment of non-biodegradable organic wastewater. Because OH has extremely short lifetime (<10 \u22123 s) [13] , it is difficult to determine it directly. In this paper, salicylic acid (SA, o -hydroxybenzoic acid) was chosen as molecular probe to capture OH. When OH exists in the solution, it will rapidly react with SA and produce 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA) or 2,5-DHBA [14] , which can be determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and fluorescence detection. The (2,3-DHBA) and 2,5-DHBA yields may indicate the amount of OH in the solution. The reaction equation is as follows. 2 Experimental 2.1 Reactor system A modified MW furnace (Whirlpool Model T120, 1000 W, China) was employed as MW source. A \u00d8 50 mm hole was drilled on its cover, with a copper pipe (\u00d8 40 mm \u00d7 50 mm) inserted to prevent MW emission [15] . The quartz column reactor (\u00d8 32 mm \u00d7 350 mm) was installed into MW furnace through the hole of the copper pipe, and the top of the column was connected to a vertical water cooling condenser. A bottle, charged with 10 mL distilled water was used to absorb the off gas after condensation. Air compressor was used to supply air. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1 . Clearly, all experiments were performed under the atmospheric pressure. 2.2 Materials and experimental procedures Commercial activated carbon (AC, A.P, Tianjin Chemical Reagent Company, China), with a particle size of 1.0\u20132.0 mm, was washed with dilute hydrochloric acid and distilled water in turn, and then dried at 105 \u00b0C for 2 h. SA (99.5% purity, from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Company, China,) was purified by recrystallizing it twice for decreasing background response during determination. 2,3-DHBA (Sigma) and 2,5-DHBA (Sigma) were prepared as standard solution according to desired concentration. Twenty millilitres of distilled water and 10 g fresh AC were added into the reaction retort and pre-irradiated for 5 min under MW power of 800 W and airflow rate of 0.5 mL min \u22121 . Then 5 mL of 4 mmol L \u22121 SA solution was added into the retort from its top carefully, and irradiated further for a given time. Afterwards, the aqueous phase and AC were spilled from the retort and collected separately. 2.3 Analysis After measurement of the solution volume, DHBA (representing 2,3-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA) and in the aqueous solution was determined directly by HPLC. DHBA and SA on AC were collected using following procedure. Used AC was heated at 105 \u00b0C to constant weight. After cooling to room temperature, it was accurately weighed. DHBA and SA in the AC were extracted by 30 mL mixture of acetone and methanol (3:2, v/v), with 0.5 mL of 37% hydrochloric acid. The extraction procedure was repeated twice. The extracts for each extraction were combined and evaporated in water bath at 70 \u00b0C to dryness. The residual was dissolved in 10 mL distilled water for HPLC analysis. Determination of SA, 2,3-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA concentrations in the solution was performed by HPLC (Agilent), coupled with fluorescent detector at 237 nm of excitation wavelength and at 405 nm of emission wavelength, using a ZORBAX Edipse XDB-C8 column (5 \u03bcm, 4.6 mm \u00d7 150 mm), with mobile phase of HAC\u2013NaAC (30 mmol L \u22121 , pH 4.9) at flow rate of 1.0 mL min \u22121 . The temperature was recorded with a sheltered type-K thermocouple probe. Procedures for extraction of Pentachlorophenol (PCP) from the solution and the AC were similar to those for DHBA except that the extracting solvent was changed to mixture of acetone and dichloromethane (3:2, v/v). Determination of PCP concentrations was performed by HPLC using a Kromasil ODS (5 \u03bcm, 4.6 mm \u00d7 250 mm) reverse phase column, a methanol:water = 0.8:0.2 mL min \u22121 of the mobile phase and UV detector (220 nm). A TOC analyzer (Shimadzu TOC-V CPH ) was employed to investigate the degree of PCP mineralization. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Identification of OH In HPLC chromatograph of aqueous solution after 10 s MW radiation under existence of 20 g AC and 0.5 L min \u22121 air supply, besides SA peak at the retention time of 6.48 min, two obvious peaks appear at 1.19 and 2.41 min, which were identified to be 2,3-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA by comparing their retention times with those of 2,3-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA standards under the same HPLC operation condition. The pattern of HPLC chromatograph is similar to that found in Ref. [16] , where OH was identified in UV/H 2 O 2 system using the same molecular probe as we did. As it well known, the capability of UV/H 2 O 2 process to generate OH is universally believed. Other oxidative species that might exist in the aqueous solution, such as HO 2 , O 3 , and H 2 O 2 , are difficult to realize quick reactions with SA [17] . Thus, we can believe that all 2,3-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA resulted mainly from the oxidation of SA by OH. 3.2 Key factors for OH generation Experiments were carried out under following conditions in order to identify key factors for OH generation: (1) MW irradiation alone; (2) irradiation with airflow (without AC); (3) irradiation with AC (without airflow); (4) irradiation with AC and airflow. Total yields of DHBA (2,3-DHBA + 2,5-DHBA) during whole course of radiation for four experiments were illustrated in Fig. 2 . According to initial test, SA and DHBA decomposed after 5 min MW radiation. Therefore, we adapt and present here the data before 3 min (180 s). As can be seen in Fig. 2 , for the experiment (1) (MW irradiation alone) and (2) (irradiation with air supply), no OH was produced. For the experiment (3) (MW irradiation with presence of AC) OH was detectable but at very low level, and maintained a relative constant value after 30 s of irradiation. On the contrary, under the condition of AC presence and air supply, OH generated rapidly with the increase of irradiation time. After 180 s irradiation, DHBA accumulation reached as high as 3.2 \u03bcmol. The results of above four experiments indicated that simultaneous presence of AC, air supply, and MW irradiation is essential for OH generation. Slight generation of OH in experiment (3) is due to the fact that limited amount of dissolved oxygen (8.2 mg L \u22121 ) existed in the solution. Further discussion on the functions of AC, air supply, and MW power is as follows. 3.2.1 Activated carbon It is clear that AC played an important role in the generation of OH in MW involved process. Fortuny et al. proved that AC could function as excellent catalyst in CWAO [18] . Its catalytic activity was found to be eight times higher than a commercial copper oxide catalyst in CWAO for phenol degradation. It was well known that free radicals dominate in the reactions of CWAO. Therefore, it is reasonable to suppose that one function of AC should be catalytic effect on OH generation. Another apparent characteristic for AC in MW field is its excellent capability for MW energy absorption. The MW energy absorbed by AC may quickly convert to heat, resulting in rapid increase of temperature in AC body. An experiment was carried out to compare temperature rising between dry AC and water at 800 W MW power. As shown in Fig. 3 , the temperature of 20 mL water increased steadily to 103 \u00b0C (boiling point) in 25\u201330 s, and maintained this temperature afterwards. Water was in the boiling state, and the evaporation vapor was cooled down, flowing back to the bottom of the reactor. However, the temperature of 10 g dry AC reached as high as 800 \u00b0C in the same period of time and rose to 1200 \u00b0C within 40 s. We can imagine when 10 g AC and 20 mL water were mixed and irradiated by MW, AC could be cooled down by water. However, there should be a temperature gradient from AC particles to water phase although it is difficult to be measured. In other words, the temperature of the micro-surfaces of AC particles might be high enough to induce catalytic generation of OH. Similar suggestion was made by Booske et al. [19] , who assumed that a portion of MW energy could be concentrated into hot spots by the localized resonant coupling of MW energy to point defects or weak surface bonds of solid materials. The \u201chot spots\u201d here could benefit the initiation of free radical generation. We expected that AC dose could have effect on OH generation. Four different AC doses, 5, 7.5, 10, and 12.5 g, were experimented, and the temperature was recorded simultaneously ( Fig. 4 ). The temperature for AC + water mixed phases rose faster than for water alone. The more AC dosed, the faster the temperature rose. The time to boiling (103 \u00b0C) was observed to be 28, 24, 21, 19, and 17 s, corresponding to AC dose 0, 5, 7.5, 10, and 12.5 g, respectively. Fig. 5 illustrates DHBA yields under different AC dose. It indicated that DHBA yield rose as AC dose increased. However, the differences of DHBA yields became smaller as AC dose increased from 5 to 12.5 g although the steps of AC increase remained the same (2.5 g). There is no obvious difference of DHBA yields between 10 and 12.5 g AC dose. It infers that there is an optimal AC dose for a given experimental condition. 3.2.2 Air supply OH generation was highly dependent on air supply (or other source of oxygen). Oxygen acts as an electron acceptor and may involve in the initial reaction. Fig. 6 shows change of DHBA yields along with the variation of air flow. Three levels, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 L min \u22121 , were investigated. Air was supplied to the reactor using an air compressor during whole course of MW irradiation under ambient temperature and pressure. Continuous air supply supported the continuous OH generation. Slight air supply to the aqueous solution promoted DHBA production obviously. However, excess amount of air supply showed less effect on OH generation. For present study, about 0.5 L min \u22121 was sufficient. We can deduce that other electron acceptors such as H 2 O 2 and O 3 , may have similar function as oxygen for free radical generation in MW involved catalytic process. 3.2.3 MW power MW supplied energy to the reaction system. Therefore, the positive effect of MW power output on the generation of OH was foreseen. Four levels of MW power output, 200, 400, 600 and 800 W were investigated, respectively, and the temperature of the reaction phase was measured simultaneously ( Fig. 7 ). It was found that the temperature rose to the boiling point (103 \u00b0C) at different rate under different MW power. The rate of temperature increase was measured to be 5, 2, 1.2, and 0.83 \u00b0C s \u22121 with respect to the MW power 800, 600, 400, and 200 W. Correspondingly, increase of MW power enhanced OH generation. It is interesting that when MW power output increased four times from 200 to 800 W, the DHBA yield increased by the same factor of 4 (0.8\u20133.2 \u03bcmol) ( Fig. 8 ). This result is very similar to that observed by Horikoshi et al. when they investigated degradation of Rhodamine-B (a dyestuff) by the integrated MW/UV method [20] . They found that color fading increased by a factor of 1.3 as MW power output increased from 225 to 300 W (300/225 = 1.3). 3.3 Consideration of kinetics and mechanism for OH generation As proposed for CWAO by Tufano [21] , a simplified model can be proposed to describe basic pathway to produce OH in the MW involved process. As shown in Fig. 2 , existence of oxygen is critical in OH generation. We found that OH could not be produced without oxygen supply. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that oxygen was involved in the first step. Based on this basic assumption, the following four simplified steps with respect to OH generation and elimination were proposed: (1) O 2 \u2192 O + O \u2009 ( k 1 ) (2) O + H 2 O \u2192 2 OH \u2009 ( k 2 ) (3) OH + M \u2192 products \u2009 ( k 3 ) (4) O + M \u2192 products \u2009 ( k 4 ) where M represents the substances that can eliminate OH. The catalysis of AC and MW energy demand are mainly involved in step (1) . According to the reactions (1)\u2013(4) , free radical generation rates are described as follows: (5) d [ OH ] d t = k 2 [ O ] [ H 2 O ] \u2212 k 3 [ OH ] [ M ] = k \u2032 2 [ O ] \u2212 k \u2032 3 [ OH ] Suppose that H 2 O and M exist in constant quantities, [H 2 O] and k 2 can be combined to a new constant k \u2032 2 , and [M] and k 3 is combined to k \u2032 3 . At steady state of OH concentration, k \u2032 2 [ O ] \u2212 k \u2032 3 [ OH ] = 0 , namely: (6) [ \u00b7 OH ] = k \u2032 2 k \u2032 3 [ \u00b7 O ] Similarly, we can deduce from reactions (1)\u2013(4) , the [ O] concentration at steady state: (7) [ O ] ss = k \u2032 1 k \u2032 2 + k \u2032 4 where k \u2032 1 , \u2009 k \u2032 2 , \u2009 k \u2032 3 , and k \u2032 4 represent k 1 [O 2 ], k 2 [H 2 O], k 3 [M] and k 4 [M], respectively. [ OH] at steady state is obtained by combining Eqs. (6) and (7) : (8) [ OH ] ss = k \u2032 1 k \u2032 2 k \u2032 3 ( k \u2032 2 + k \u2032 4 ) Although Eqs. (1)\u2013(8) are very helpful for understanding the theoretic pathway with respect to OH generation, it is difficult in practical use because of the difficulty to determine each individual rate constant ( k ). In fact, determination of the apparent rate constant based on the overall equation of is a more common way for kinetic description. In present study, DHBA was formed from SA under MW irradiation and a constant supply of air. Thus, the overall equation of the reaction was expressed as: (9) x SA + y O 2 + z H 2 O \u2192 a DHBA + other products ( if any ) . The rate of DHBA formation was: (10) d [ DHBA ] d t = k d [ SA ] x [ O 2 ] y [ H 2 O ] z where k d is the rate constant for DHBA formation. Since O 2 was supplied at a constant flow, and H 2 O remained almost the same quantity, [O 2 ] and [H 2 O] were supposed to be constant. In addition, the last item [SA] was also supposed to be constant at the initial course because excess amount of SA (20 \u03bcmol) was added. Then, the equation was simplified as: (11) d [ DHBA ] d t = k \u2032 d (12) [ DHBA ] = k \u2032 d t + a where k \u2032 d is a renewed rate constant for DHBA formation. Eq. (12) expresses a linear relationship between the DHBA concentration and the irradiation time. Fig. 9 illustrates the experimental curve for DHBA yield vs. the time of irradiation. The experiment was carried out under the condition: 10 g AC dose, 0.5 L min \u22121 air flow, and 800 W MW power. The experimental result showed good agreement with the pseudo-zero-order kinetic equation although the experimental points go slightly down in the last course, which was possibly caused by an apparent consumption of SA during the last course, leading to non-constant for item [SA]. The rate of DHBA formation, known from the pseudo-zero-order kinetic equation, was 0.0176 \u03bcmol s \u22121 . The total DHBA yield reached 3.2 \u03bcmol in 3 min, which imply that not less than 3.2 \u03bcmol OH were generated in the same period (production of 1 mol DHBA consumes the same amount of OH). The fraction of OH in the formation of DHBA was calculated from following equation: (13) f M OH = M DHBA where f stands for the percentage fraction of DHBA, M DHBA the mol fraction of OH for DHBA formation, and M OH is the total amount of OH generated. According to the literature presented by Chen and Mopper and Grootveld and Halliwell [16,22] , f ranges from 50% to 90% in SA aqueous solution. Hence, the total yield of OH was estimated to be 3.6\u20136.4 \u03bcmol, and the average rate was 0.020\u20130.036 \u03bcmol s \u22121 . 3.4 A case for degradation of persistent organic substances in aqueous solution using MW assisted oxidation method Because MW energy has the capability to produce OH under presence of AC and oxygen supply as shown in previous section, we expect that this MW involved method should be effective in degradation of non-biodegradable organic substances. Since air was employed as oxidant in this process, we may call it MW assisted catalytic wet air oxidation (MW/CWAO). Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was used as target substance because it is one of the typical persistent toxic substances that are hardly biodegradable. Experiment was carried out for two levels of PCP concentration (500 and 2000 mg L \u22121 at pH 10) under the condition of MW power 800 W, airflow 0.5 L min \u22121 , and AC dose 10 g, 20 mL of PCP aqueous solution. The results were illustrated in Fig. 10 . The novel MW/CWAO showed effective degradation of PCP within 1 h of operation time. PCP removal reached nearly 100% for 500 mg L \u22121 PCP solution and 72% for 2000 mg L \u22121 PCP solution, among which 82% and 40% were mineralized, respectively. This result was comparable to the level treated using conventional CWAO, whereas, the MW/CWAO was operated under normal pressure and 100\u2013103 \u00b0C. Therefore, the advantage of MW/CWAO over conventional CWAO in reducing operation risk is apparent. 4 Conclusions OH was generated indirectly by MW energy. Simultaneous presences of activated carbon and oxygen proved to be critical in OH generation. Temperatures of water and AC increased at the different rates under MW irradiation due to the internal heating by MW energy, which could cause locally higher temperature in some micro-surfaces of the AC particles than water bulk. Oxygen was supposed to participate in the first step to initiate OH because OH was only observed when oxygen exists. Its generation was fitted for pseudo-zero-order kinetic equation at initial stage of reaction. The rate of OH generation was estimated to range from 0.020 to 0.036 \u03bcmol s \u22121 under our experimental conditions. Continuous generation of OH served to the degradation of pentachlorophenol, even to the degree of mineralization. This work supplies a simple and rapid method for sequential generation of OH in aqueous solution using microwave energy. As OH is an active and environmental friendly oxidant, it will have great significance in the fields of green chemistry, environmental protection, and other related fields.

Its surface was structured with surface voids and the nanotubes were open at top end with an average diameter of approximately 50 nm. The MIP-modified TiO2 nanotube array with anatase phase was identified by XRD and a distinguishable red shift in the absorption spectrum was observed. The MIP-modified electrode also exhibited a high adsorption capacity for TC due to its high surface area providing imprinted sites. Photocurrent was generated on the MIP-modified photoanode using the simulated solar spectrum and increased with the increase of positive bias potential. Under simulated solar light irradiation, the MIP-modified TiO2 nanotube array electrode exhibited enhanced photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) activity with the apparent first-order rate constant being 1.2-fold of that with TiO2 nanotube array electrode. The effect of the thickness of the MIP layer on the PEC activity was also evaluated. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

The SEM imagines showed that the obtained nanotube arrays were highly ordered and vertically oriented. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that the introduced silicon might be incorporated into titania matrix, and hence helped to increase the thermal stability of titania, which was in favor of suppressing the formation of rutile and the growth of anatase crystallite. A significant blue shift with enhanced absorption intensities in UV light regions was observed in the spectra of UV absorption of Si-doped samples. The enhanced photoelectrochemical response of Si-doped nanotube-array photoanode was obtained under UV light irradiation, and its photocurrent density under UV light is 1.48 times that of the undoped TiO2 nanotube arrays. The photoelectrocatalytic activity of the prepared electrode was evaluated with pentachlorophenol as a test substance, and the degradation kinetic constant of Si-doped electrode is 2.0 times that with undoped TiO2 nanotube electrode under UV light irradiation.",

        "abstract": "The photoelectrochemical degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) at a Pt doped TiO 2 /Ti electrode was investigated. The electrode was prepared by first oxidizing the surface of a titanium sheet to form TiO 2 and then doping platinum in H 2 PtCl 6 solution. The degradation efficiency of 2,4-D in the solution with 51 mg/l concentration was, respectively, 16% for electrochemical process and 27% for photochemical process after 5 h reaction. It became 53% when photo- and electrochemical processes were integrated. The 10% higher 2,4-D degradation efficiency by the integrated method than the sum of the two individual processes demonstrates an obvious synergetic effect between the photo- and electrochemical catalysis. Besides, a decrease in current density was observed with reaction time. The degradation efficiency increased with the increase of potential bias. The degradation of 2,4-D was also dependent on pH and concentration of sodium sulfate acting as a supporting electrolyte.",

Its other advantages include high thermal shock resistance, geometric flexibility, simplicity in catalyst recovery, excellent thermal response, high mechanical strength, good axial dispersion, and low cost. In this study, the effects of temperature, space velocity, concentration, feed ratio, oxygen, and water on properties of WMH catalyst were investigated. NO reduction was controlled by chemical kinetics and increased with temperature increase at < 280\u00b0C. The NO conversion had a maximum at \u223c 320\u00b0C. Ammonia oxidation began at 340\u00b0C. At > 380\u00b0C, the reaction was fully controlled by ammonia oxidation. NO conversion increased with increase in feed concentration and NH3/NO ratio. NO reduction was seriously inhibited under a condition of oxygen deficiency. With water volume fraction < 2%, the addition of water at < 340\u00b0C lowered NO conversion, while its addition at higher temperatures enhanced reaction selectivity.",

When the SBMBBR was conducted under a two-sludge system, stable and high performance was obtained. Removal rates of phosphorus and TN reached 89.2% and 84.5% under the influent COD of 140-170 mg/L and TN of 34-42 mg/L, respectively.

        "abstract": "Luminescence bioassay using Vibrio fischeri and in vitro ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) induction bioassay using H4-IIE rat hepatoma cell were employed to test toxicity changes during the photoelectrocatalysis process for the degradation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) on TiO(2) nanotubes electrode. Acute toxicity of the reaction solution reduced by 83% after 120 min of irradiation. Bioassay-derived 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents (TEQ(bio)) increased from 0.72 to 6.72 ng l(-1) during the former reaction stage, decreasing rapidly to 1.25 ng l(-1) during the latter reaction stage. HRGC/HRMS analysis detected polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) congeners in the reaction mixtures. TEQ(bio) and chemical-derived 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents (TEQ(cal)) were about of the same order of magnitude. Both results illustrated the formation of dioxins and their removal by photoelectrocatalysis. Moreover, photoelectrocatalysis showed a significant priority over direct photolysis and photocatalysis depending on the reaction conditions, not only for PCP removal but also for reduction in toxicity.",

Scanning electron microscopy showed that TiO 2 was uniformly coated on the entire carbon nanowall and a TiO 2 /carbon nanowall composite was obtained. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction indicated that the crystal phase of the TiO 2 coating was anatase. The asymmetry of the current-voltage plot for the material revealed that a heterojunction was formed between the TiO 2 and the carbon nanowall. As a result of this heterojunction, enhanced separation of photogenerated electrons and holes was confirmed by surface photovoltage and photocurrent measurements. The investigation of photocatalytic ability showed that the TiO 2 /carbon nanowall had a higher photocatalytic activity than TiO 2 nanotubes for the degradation of phenol under UV light irradiation.",

Comparing this value with the sum of the decolorization ratios obtained by a sole application of electrochemical (lower than 3%) and photochemical (about 23%) procedures, a significant synergic effect between both processes was observed.

        "abstract": "Catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) is a promising method for the treatment of heavily contaminated wastewater. However, its application is restricted due to severe operation conditions (high pressure and high temperature). A microwave (MW) assisted oxidation method was investigated aiming to treat heavily contaminated wastewater under milder conditions. H-acid (1-amino-8-naphthol-3, 6-disulfonic acid) was selected as target compound to evaluate the performance of this novel process. The removal of H-acid and TOC (total organic carbon) for H-acid solution of 3000 mg/L reached as high as 92.6% in 20 min and 84.2% in 60 min, respectively under optimal conditions. The existence of activated carbon and oxygen proved to be critical for effective treatment. The activated carbon acted not only as a catalyst for H-acid decomposition, but also as a special material for the absorption of MW energy. Air was supplied to the reactor as an oxygen source at constant flows. The amino group in H-acid was converted ultimately into nitrate, and sulfonic group into sulfate. This observation gave an evidence of H-acid mineralization although other organic intermediates were unable to be determined. The value of BOD(5)/COD (ratio of 5d biochemical oxygen demand to chemical oxygen demand) increased from 0.008 to 0.467 indicating a significant improvement of biodegradability for the solution, which is beneficial for the further biological treatment of the wastewater.",

Only a few theoretical molecular descriptors were included in the QSPR models, including average molecular polarizability, molecular weight, total energy and standard heat of formation, which implies that intermolecular dispersive forces play an important role in governing the magnitude of P(L) and K(OW). The models were tested as acceptable for prediction of P(L) and K(OW) by validation set. The consistency between observed and predicted values for P(L) is the best, followed by K(OW) and S(W,L). The Q(2)(cum) values of the PLS models obtained are higher than 0.95, indicating high robustness of the models. Since P(L), K(OW) and S(W,L) values for many PCDE congeners are not available, the developed models can be used for estimation.",

To clarify the respective effects of combining Fe(III) dosage and a MEC and Fe(III) dosage only on strengthening anaerobic digestion, three anaerobic reactors were operated in parallel: a MEC - anaerobic reactor with dosing Fe(OH)3 (R1), an anaerobic reactor with dosing Fe(OH)3 (R2) and a common anaerobic reactor (R3). With increasing influent COD from 1500 to 4000 mg/L, the COD removal in R1 was maintained at 88.3% under a voltage of 0.8 V, which was higher than that in reactor R2 and R3. When the power was cut off, the COD removal in R1 decreased by 5.9%. The addition of Fe(OH)3 enhanced both anaerobic digestion and anodic oxidation, resulting in the effective mineralization of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). The reduced Fe(II) combined with electric field resulted more extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production. Quantitative real - time PCR showed a higher abundance of bacteria in the anodic biofilm and R1. Pyrosequencing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis revealed that the dominant bacteria and archaea communities were richer and more abundant in the anode biofilm and R1.",

After being spiked with \u03b3-HCH, soil samples were loaded with \u03b1-Fe2O3 or TiO2 and exposed to UV-light irradiation. Different catalyst loads (0%, 2%, 5%, 7%, and 10% (wt). \u03b1-Fe2O3; 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2% wt). TiO2 were tested for up to 7 d irradiation. The effects of soil thickness, acidity, and humic substances were also investigated. The obtained results indicated that the \u03b3-HCH photodegradation follows the pseudo-first-order kinetics. The addition of \u03b1-Fe2O3 or TiO2 accelerates the photodegradation of \u03b3-HCH, while the photodegradation rate decreases when the content of \u03b1-Fe2O3 exceeds 7%(wt.). The degradation rate increases with the soil pH value. Humic substances inhibit the photocatalytic degradation of \u03b3-HCH.

The separation of oil-water mixtures is essentially an interfacial issue, and thus controllable surface wettability of membrane is extremely significant for efficient and cost-effective oil/water separation. Herein, poly-3-methylthiophene (P(3-MTH))/carbon membranes (CMs-P) with switchable surface wettability between superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity were designed. The CMs-P, prepared from coating P(3-MTH) on the highly porous and electrically conductive carbon nanofiber membranes, could exhibit the wettability switch by doping or dedoping the P(3-MTH) with ClO 4  \u2212  under electro-stimuli. The switch can be quickly achieved in less than 30\u202fs and shows desired recyclability. Driven by gravity only, the prepared CMs-P are capable of completely separating free oil-water mixture. Furthermore, the separation efficiency reaches to 99.5% for surfactant-stabled emulsions with various oil-water ratios. This work presents new insights into the study for smart gating membranes and the design of novel functional oil/water separation devices.",

Among the test compounds, PFOS, PFDoA, and PFTeA inhibited algal growth rate in a concentration-dependent manner while PFBS, PFHxA, and PFOA did not inhibit algal growth within the test concentration ranges. An enhancement of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and cell membrane permeability in S. obliquus was observed caused by exposure to PFOS, PFOA, PFDoA, and PFTeA. Both carbon chain length and acid group influenced the toxicity of PFAAs, where the toxicity increased with increasing carbon chain length for the compounds belonging to the same class. The observed effective concentrations lie in the micromole range and the test compounds disrupted membrane properties at concentrations below those associated with algal growth inhibition. Flow cytometry is proved to be a useful technique for toxicity testing with microalgae and provide additional information regarding the mode of action of PFAAs to algal species.",

        "abstract": "In China, a considerable part of industrial wastewater effluents are discharged into the municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) after pretreatment in their own wastewater treatment plants. Even though the industrial effluents meet the professional emission standards, many micro-pollutants still remained, and they could be resistant in the municipal WWTPs with conventional activated sludge process. Pigment wastewater was chosen in this study, and the acute toxicity reduction and identification of the pigment-contaminated wastewater treated by the conventional anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A/A/O) process were evaluated. Results indicated that the raw pigment-contaminated wastewater was acutely toxic to Photobacterium phosphoreum (P.\u00a0phosphoreum), Daphnia magna (D.\u00a0magna) and Danio rerio (D.\u00a0rerio). The acute toxicity was decreased in some degree after A/A/O treatment, but the final effluent still exhibited acute toxicity to D.\u00a0magna and D.\u00a0rerio with the toxic units (TU) of 1.1 and 2.0, respectively. Chemical analyses showed the presence of various refractory and toxic nitrogen-containing polycyclic and heterocyclic compounds in the pigment-contaminated wastewater. Toxicity identification by combining chemical analyses and correlation analysis showed that N-containing refractory organic toxicants were the main toxicity source for the pigment-contaminated wastewater, and several toxicants showed significant correlation with P.\u00a0phosphoreum and D.\u00a0magna. This study indicated that the A/A/O process was not efficient for pigment-contaminated wastewater treatment, and it was irradiative for technology improvement in the WWTPs receiving pretreated industrial wastewater effluents.",

        "abstract": "Manganese incorporated fibrous silica nanosphere (MnOx-0.013/KCC-1) was synthesized by one step hydrothermal method for the first time and its catalytic activity for ozonation of oxalic acid was studied. For comparison, manganese loaded MCM-41 (MnOx-0.013/MCM-41) was prepared by impregnation method. Various characterizations showed that the morphological, structural and textural properties of MnOx-0.013/KCC-1 were well preserved. Ozonation and catalytic ozonation by MnOx-0.013/KCC-1 and MnOx-0.013/MCM-41 led to 4, 85 and 60% reduction in TOC respectively. Furthermore, 0.05 and 1.2mgL(-1) leaching of Mn was detected from MnOx-0.013/KCC-1 and MnOx-0.013/MCM-41, which are approximately 2.0 and 42.0% of the total Mn present in MnOx-0.013/KCC-1 and MnOx-0.013/MCM-41 respectively. The high catalytic activity was attributed to the generation of hydroxyl radical. Surface hydroxyl groups investigated by using phosphates and ATR-FTIR were believed to be the active sites. Our proposed method of synthesis can be generalized for the synthesis of other metal oxides incorporated fibrous silica for environmental catalysis and other catalytic reactions. ",

However, few studies have evaluated the detoxification efficiencies of the treatment processes that are extensively performed in operational coking wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). This study investigates the detoxification efficiencies of a combined anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (AO)-ozonation and AO-Fenton oxidation process in two coking WWTPs using an acute immobilization test for Daphnia magna, acute toxicity test for adult zebrafish, embryo toxicity test for zebrafish and the comet assay. The raw coking wastewaters displayed high acute daphnia and fish toxicity, zebrafish embryo toxicity and genotoxicity. The AO processing unit effectively removed acute and embryo toxicity, but not genotoxicity. In addition, the AO effluent quality did not meet the integrated wastewater discharge standard in China (GB18918-2002). The ozonation and Fenton oxidation units used as post-treatments in these two plants not only treated the coking wastewater to the discharge standard but also reduced the genotoxicity. However, the final effluents still showed potential genotoxicity after high dilution. The results suggest that the discharge of treated coking wastewater probably poses potential risks to human health and the environment even if it met regulatory standards.",

        "abstract": "Nanoporous carbons (NPCs) derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are attracting increasing attention in many areas by virtue of their high specific surface area, large pore volume and unique porosity. The present work reports the preparation of an NPC with high surface area (1731m/g) and pore volume (1.68cm/g) by direct carbonization of MOF-5. We examined the adsorption of three typical contaminants from aqueous solutions, i.e., sulfamethoxazole (SMX), bisphenol A (BPA) and methyl orange (MO), by using the as-prepared NPC. The results demonstrated that NPC could adsorb the contaminants effectively, with adsorption capacity (q) of 625mg/g (SMX), 757mg/g (BPA) and 872mg/g (MO), respectively. These values were approximately 1.0-3.2 times higher than those obtained for single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and commercial powder active carbon (PAC) under the same conditions. With its high surface area and unique meso/macropore structure, the enhanced adsorption of NPC most likely originates from the cooperative interaction of a pore-filling mechanism, electrostatic interaction, and hydrogen bonding. In particular, the pH value has a crucial impact on adsorption, suggesting the significant contribution of electrostatic interaction between NPC and the contaminants. This study provides a proof-of-concept demonstration of MOF-derived nanoporous carbons as effective adsorbents of contaminants for water treatment.",

Here, electro-assisted adsorption onto activated carbon fiber in continuous-flow mode was used to remove three ionizable antibiotics, sulfadimethoxine (SDM), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and clarithromycin (CLA), from water. Benefiting from strengthened electrostatic interactions, the adsorption capacities for the target antibiotics (10\u202fmg/L) in flow mode (70.9-202.2\u202fmg/g) increased by \u223c5 times under a potential of 1.0\u202fV (SDM) or\u00a0-1.0\u202fV (CIP and CLA) relative to those of open circuit (OC) adsorption. Meanwhile, effluent concentration decreased from >100\u202f\u03bcg/L to 9.6\u202f\u03bcg/L with removal efficiency increasing from 99.0% to 99.9%. Moreover, high recovery efficiency of ACF up to 96.35\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.65% was achieved by imposing a reverse potential (-1.0\u202fV) relative to that used for SDM adsorption. In addition, trace levels of antibiotics (364-580\u202fng/L) in surface water could be removed effectively to achieve low effluent concentration (0.4-1.2\u202fng/L) and high removal efficiency (99.9%) upon treating up to \u223c1560 bed volumes (BVs), demonstrating the potential of electro-assisted adsorption for practical application in water treatment.",

        "abstract": "Metal-free carbon materials have been presented to be potential alternatives to metal-based catalysts for heterogeneous catalytic ozonation, yet the catalytic performance still needs to be enhanced. Doping carbon with non-metallic heteroatoms (e.g., N, B, and F) could alter the electronic structure and electrochemical properties of original carbon materials, has been considered to be an effective method for improving the catalytic activity of carbon materials. Herein, fluorine-doped carbon nanotubes (F-CNTs) were synthesized via a facile method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy. The as-synthesized F-CNTs exhibited notably enhanced catalytic activity towards catalytic ozonation for the degradation of organic pollutants. The oxalic acid removal efficiency of optimized F-CNTs was approximately two times as much as that of pristine CNTs, and even exceeded those of four conventional metal-based catalysts (ZnO, AlO, FeO, and MnO). The XPS and Raman studies confirmed that the covalent CF bonds were formed at the sp C sites instead of sp C sites on CNTs, not only resulting in high positive charge density of C atoms adjacent to F atoms, but remaining the delocalized \u03c0-system with intact carbon structure of F-CNTs, which then favored the conversion of ozone molecules (O) into reactive oxygen species (ROS) and contributed to the high oxalic acid removal efficiency. Furthermore, electron spin resonance (ESR) studies revealed that superoxide radicals (O) and singlet oxygen (O) might be the dominant ROS that responsible for the degradation of oxalic acid in these catalytic systems.",

        "abstract": "Nanofiltration (NF) has received much attention for wastewater treatment and desalination. However, NF membranes generally suffer from the trade-off between permeability and selectivity. In this work, the co-enhancement of permeability and ion selectivity was achieved through tuning the surface charge and pore size of oxidized carbon nanotube (OCNT) intercalated reduced graphene oxide (RGO) membranes. With the increase of OCNT content from 0 to 83%, the surface charge and the pore size are increased. The permeability increased to 10.6 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 and rejection rate reached 78.1% for Na2SO4 filtration at a transmembrane pressure of 2 bar, which were 11.8 and 1.3 times higher than those of pristine RGO membrane. The composite membrane also showed 11.1 times higher permeability (11.1 L m-2 h-1 bar-1) and 2.9 times higher rejection rate (35.3%) for NaCl filtration. The analyses based on Donnan steric pore model suggest that the increased permeability is attributed to the combined effects of enlarged pore size and increased surface charge, while the enhanced ion selectivity is mainly dependent on the electrostatic interaction between the membrane and target ions. This finding provides a new insight for the development of high-performance NF membranes in water treatment and desalination.",

        "abstract": "Recently cobalt-based heterogeneous catalysts have been widely investigated for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation in sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation processes. However, the improvement of the catalytic performance for PMS activation remains to be a challenge. As the limiting step, the rapid transformation of Co/Co redox pairs is crucial for PMS activation. Perovskites attract increasing attention due to their controllable oxidation state of B-site metal and formation of oxygen vacancies, which accelerates the cycle of redox pairs. LaCoMO (M\u202f=\u202fCu, Fe and Mn) perovskites as heterogeneous catalysts of PMS were synthesized for the degradation of phenol. The results showed that LaCoCuO exhibited the highest catalytic activity. The pseudo first-order kinetic constant of phenol degradation on LaCoCuO is 0.302\u202fmin, being about 5 times as high as Co with same molar concentration of cobalt in LaCoCuO. XPS analysis confirmed that substitution of copper could promote the cycle of Co/Co, thus enhance the catalytic efficiency for PMS activation. The facilitated cycle of Co/Co played a crucial role in the generation of sulfate radicals, hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen. And sulfate radical was the primary radical responsible for pollutants degradation. The results provide insights into constructing novel perovskite catalysts for the removal of organic pollutants in water.",

        "abstract": "A novel photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor with graphitic-phase carbon nitride quantum dots (g-CN; QDs) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was fabricated. The g-CN QDs possess enhanced emission quantum yield (with an emission peak at 450\u00a0nm), improved charge separation ability and effective optical absorption, while rGO has excellent electron transfer capability. Altogether, this results in improved PEC performance. The method is making use of an aptamer against sulfadimethoxine (SDM) that was immobilized on electrode through \u03c0 stacking interaction. Changes of the photocurrent occur because SDM as a photogenerated hole acceptor can further accelerate the separation of photoexcited carriers. Under optimized conditions and at an applied potential of +0.2\u00a0V, the aptasensor has a linear response in the 0.5\u00a0nM to 80\u00a0nM SDM concentration range, with a 0.1\u00a0nM detection limit (at S/N\u00a0=\u20093).

Herein, we synthesized oxide-derived Cu/carbon (OD Cu/C) catalysts by a facile carbonization of Cu-based MOF (HKUST-1). The resulting materials exhibited highly selective CO reduction to alcohol compounds with total faradic efficiencies of 45.2-71.2% at -0.1 to -0.7 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). High-yield methanol and ethanol has been achieved on OD Cu/C-1000 with the production rates of 5.1-12.4 and 3.7-13.4 mg L h, respectively. Notably, the onset potential for CHOH formation is near -0.1 V (versus RHE), corresponding to \u223c190 mV of overpotential, which is among the lowest overpotentials reported to date for the reduction of CO to CHOH. The improvements in activity and selectivity of the oxide-derived Cu/carbon might be attributed to the synergistic effect between the highly dispersed copper and the matrix of porous carbon. These findings provide a new insight into design of practical catalysts for decreasing atmospheric CO levels and synthesizing liquid fuels.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is an attractive technique for reducing CO2 emission and converting it into useful chemicals, but it suffers from high overpotential, low efficiency or poor product selectivity. Here, N-doped nanodiamond/Si rod array (NDD/Si RA) was proposed as an efficient nonmetallic electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction. It preferentially and rapidly converted CO2 to acetate over formate with an onset potential of -0.36 V (vs RHE), overcoming the usual limitation of low selectivity for C2 products. Moreover, faradic efficiency of 91.2-91.8% has been achieved for CO2 reduction at -0.8 to -1.0 V. Its superior performance for CO2 reduction can be attributed to its high overpotential for hydrogen evolution and N doping, where N-sp(3)C species was highly active for CO2 reduction. Electrokinetic data and in situ infrared spectrum revealed the main pathway for CO2 reduction might be CO2 \u2192 CO2(\u2022-) \u2192 (COO)2(\u2022) \u2192 CH3COO(-). ",

Here, an Au-coated carbon nanotube (Au/CNT) hollow fiber membrane was fabricated by depositing Au nanoparticles on a CNT hollow fiber membrane. The Au/CNT hollow fiber membrane exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol. The observed improvement in the catalytic activity can be ascribed to the synergistic effect between the Au nanoparticles and CNT membrane. The Au/CNT hollow fiber membrane described in this paper presented high stability in the 4-nitrophenol reduction process.

        "abstract": "In order to improve the permeate flux of photocatalytic membranes, we present an approach for coupling TiO2 with ceramic hollow fiber membranes. The ceramic hollow fiber membranes with high permeate flux were fabricated by a controlled wet-spinning process using polyethersulfone (PESf) and ceramic powder as precursors and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone as solvent, and the subsequent TiO2 coating was performed by a dip-coating process using tetra- n -butyl titanate as precursor. It has been found that the PESf/ceramic powder ratio could influence the structure of the membranes. Here the as-prepared TiO2 hollow fiber membranes had a pure water flux of 4,450 L/(m2\u00b7h). The performance of the TiO2 hollow fiber membrane was evaluated using humic acid (HA) as a test substance. The results demonstrated that this membrane exhibited a higher permeate flux under UV irradiation than in the dark and the HA removal efficiency was enhanced. The approach described here provides an operable route to the development of high-permeable photocatalytic membranes for water treatment.",

        "abstract": "An integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) process (G1) and an activated sludge anoxic\u2013oxic process (G2) were operated at nitrate liquor recirculation ratio (R) of 100, 200 and 300% to investigate the feasibility of enhancing nitrogen removal efficiency ( R TN) and reducing R by improving simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) in the IFAS process. The results showed that the effluent NH4+-N and total nitrogen (TN) of G1 at R of 200% were less than 1.5 and 14.5 mg/L, satisfying the Chinese discharge standard (NH4+-N u003c 5 mg/L; TN u003c 15 mg/L). However, the effluent NH4+-N and TN of G2 at R of 300% were higher than 8.5 and 15.3 mg/L. It indicated that better R TN could be achieved at a lower R in the IFAS process. The polymerase chain reaction\u2013denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis results implied that nitrifiers and denitrifiers co-existed in one microbial community, facilitating the occurrence of SND in the aerobic reactor of G1, and the contribution of SND to TN removal efficiency ranged 15\u201319%, which was the main reason that the R TN was improved in the IFAS process. Therefore, the IFAS process was an effective method for improving R TN and reducing R. In practical application, this advantage of the IFAS process can decrease the electricity consumption for nitrate liquor recirculation flow, thereby saving operational costs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Highly active metal-free electrocatalysts consisting of earth-abundant elements for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are extremely desired for renewable energy technologies. Here we prepare the nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene/carbon nanotube (NS-GR/CNT) with 3D architecture by one-step hydrothermal method, which presents good performance for OER. The as-prepared NS-GR/CNT exhibits more negative onset potential and lower Tafel slope (0.56\u00a0V, 103\u00a0mV\u00a0decade \u22121  vs. S.C.E. in 0.1\u00a0M KOH) compared to single N doped graphene/carbon nanotube (0.65\u00a0V, 285\u00a0mV\u00a0decade \u22121 ), which indicates S doping can significantly enhance the OER performance. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the thiophene-like S (C-S-C) is the dominant S species in all the S doped samples. NS-GR/CNT with C-S-C content of 0.26% has the Tafel slope of 151\u00a0mV\u00a0decade \u22121  while the value for NS-GR/CNT with C-S-C content of 1.09% is 103\u00a0mV\u00a0decade \u22121 . The decreased Tafel slope demonstrates the catalytic kinetics are highly correlated with the content of C-S-C. Density functional theory calculations suggest that C-S-C may improve the catalytic kinetics by facilitating the adsorption of the OH \u2212  intermediate. Besides, the 3D architecture composed of graphene and CNTs also contributes to the good performance and chronoamperometric measurement demonstrates the good durability of NS-GR/CNTs.",

In this work, membrane distillation coupling with electrochemistry was developed to achieve high desalination performance on superhydrophobic CNT hollow fiber membrane. The prepared membrane possessed higher permeability, better wetting resistance with permeate flux of 1.3\u20131.6 folds, water entry pressure of 1.4\u20131.7 folds as high as conventional PVDF and PP hollow fiber membranes. When it worked as cathode at a low voltage of 0.5\u00a0V, its fouling resistance was further improved and no flux loss occurred in 36\u00a0h operation for feed containing natural organic matter, while 15% flux loss was observed under open circuit. Interestingly, the energy consumed by electrochemical assistance can be self-powered by thermoelectric power generating module from the temperature gradient between feed and permeate.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Herein, we reported a method to inhibit the oxidation passivation of Si nanomaterials (taking Si nanowire array (SiNW, about 100\u00a0nm of diameter) as a representative) via structuring nanopores (less than 10\u00a0nm) on their surface. SiNW array was prepared through metal-assisted chemical etching. After 30\u00a0min of etching, nanopores were formed on the surface of SiNW and the amount of nanopores increased with the prolonging of the etching duration. Due to the generation of the nanopores, the decrease of optical reflection was observed. The photoelectrochemical performance of samples prepared after 30, 60 and 90\u00a0min etching were evaluated. The sample etched for 60\u00a0min displayed the highest and stable photocurrent and was used in the photoelectrocatalytic testing. The SiNW with nanopores exhibited significant photoelectrocatalytic stability than that of SiNW. The kinetic constant of Cr(VI) reduction over SiNW with nanopores was 0.081\u00a0min \u22121 , which was 1.8 times as much as that over SiNW (0.045\u00a0cm \u22121 ) and maintained above 0.080\u00a0min \u22121  after three repeated experimental runs. These results demonstrate that constructing surface nanopores on the surface of SiNW is an effective approach to realize the use of Si materials as photoelectrodes in the aqueous solution.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   It is of great interest to develop metal-free electrocatalysts derived from cheap and environmental friendly biomass for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here we report a facile method to prepare graphene-like N-doped carbons with a high degree of graphitization and large surface area using chitosan as precursor and FeCl 3  as soft template. The graphitization degree, surface area and the N species can be simply adjusted by controlling the annealing temperature. The soft template induced sample annealed at 800\u00a0\u00b0C (STS800) exhibits more positive onset potential than the samples annealed at 600\u00a0\u00b0C and 1000\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22120.08\u00a0V compared to \u22120.12\u00a0V and \u22120.15\u00a0V), which demonstrates that all of the high degree of graphitization, large surface area and the high percentages of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N play curial roles in the good ORR activity. The value of onset potential for STS800 is just 25\u00a0mV negative than that for Pt/C (\u22120.08\u00a0V to \u22120.055\u00a0V) and the ORR current density at merely \u22120.3\u00a0V for STS800 (\u22122.16\u00a0mA\u00a0cm \u22122 ) is larger than that for Pt/C (\u22122.12\u00a0mA\u00a0cm \u22122 ), which indicates its superior ORR activity even compared to Pt/C. Besides, the current for STS800 retains 95% at \u22120.2\u00a0V in 30000\u00a0s while that for Pt/C just retains 88%, which reveals its longer durability. With the addition of 3\u00a0M methanol, the CV curve of STS800 shows no noticeable current attenuation, indicating its good methanol tolerance. The excellent ORR activity, good methanol tolerance, and long durability demonstrate that STS800 could be a promising alternative for costly Pt-based electrocatalysts.",

In this paper, the superhydrophobic membrane, constrained by high porosity and large pore size, was prepared. Titania is regarded as a promising candidate material for environmental application, due to its high photocatalytic ability, relatively low cost, remarkable photostability, and toxicity. The membrane, consisted of titania nanofibers, was designed and fabricated by vacuum filtration and fluorination modification. Compared with ceramic particle aggregated membrane distillation (MD) membrane, an interconnected pore structure was constructed by entangled nanofibers to endow the prepared membrane with porosity higher than 80%. During direct contact membrane distillation process, the prepared membrane displayed an excellent desalination performance with flux of 12 LMH and salt rejection of 99.92%. Importantly, the flux was much higher than those of ceramic membranes with particle aggregation structure. Moreover, the prepared membrane possesses a good stability for long-term MD operation in pure water and even desalinating high saline water. The superhydrophobic titania nanofibrous ceramic membrane modified by fluorinated holds promise for practical applications due to its excellent performance for water desalination.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In the biofilm wastewater treatment process, the start-up period of biofilm process is affected by the biofilm formation on the surface of carriers. Controlling surface charge property of carriers could accelerate the biofilm formation. The surface of conventional biofilm carriers, such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) is negatively charged, as is the surface of bacterial cells of activated sludge, which could lead to electrostatic repulsion between the biofilm carriers and the bacteria. Herein, the conventional high-density polyethylene (HDPE) carriers were modified by two kinds of positively charged polymers with different charge strength, which were noted as polyquaternium-10 (PQAS-10) and cationicpolyacrylamides (CPAM), respectively, to accelerate the startup of biofilm-based wastewater treatment process. The results showed that the positive Zeta potential was measured on the surface of modified carriers, whereas the surface Zeta potential of unmodified carriers was negative. It indicated that the modified carriers carried positive charge. Furthermore, the positive charge on the modified PQAS-10 carriers was higher than that on the modified CPAM carriers. The reactor with modified PQAS-10 carriers achieved shorter reactor start-up time and higher attached biomass compared to that with unmodified carriers and modified CPAM carriers. As a result, the removal efficiencies of COD, NH 4  + -N and TN in the reactor with the modified carriers were higher than that with the unmodified carriers. These findings demonstrated that the success of electrophilic modification on the surface of carriers was expected to accelerate the startup of biofilm-based reactors and improve the reactor performance in the practical application.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nitrogen doped nanocarbon materials have emerged as promising metal-free catalysts towards peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation for environmental remediation. However, their catalytic efficiency for PMS activation still needs improvement. Moreover, the relationship between the catalytic efficiency and nitrogen content or species, which is important to clarify the catalytic mechanism, remains unclear. In this study, three nitrogen-rich metal-organic frameworks (ZIF-8, NH 2 -MIL-53 and IRMOF-3) with nitrogen content of 24.7\u00a0wt%, 6.28\u00a0wt% and 5.16\u00a0wt% respectively were chosen to prepare the nitrogen doped porous carbons (NPCs) with different nitrogen content. Several carbonization temperatures were employed to obtain the NPCs with varying nitrogen species. The PMS catalytic performance of NPCs and its relationship with nitrogen content or species were investigated. The results showed all the NPCs exhibited enhanced PMS activation for phenol degradation compared with the nitrogen-free porous carbon (obtained from MOF-5), and was even superior to the most effective PMS activator of homogeneous Co 2+ . The ZIF-8 derived NPC carbonized at 1000\u00a0\u00b0C, with the highest graphitic N content, displayed best performance with the kinetic constant of phenol degradation 4 times higher than that on porous carbon. The graphitic N plays a critical role for activating PMS to produce sulfate radical and hydroxyl radical.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The worldwide presence of harmful micropollutants in water resources drives the development of innovative and energy-efficient water treatment technologies. Herein, a novel carbon-nanotube-(CNT)-based hollow fiber membrane, with a sandwich-like structure in its cross section, is designed and prepared for expanded micropollutant removal under electrochemical assistance. The CNT membranes consist of (1) outer CNT layer as separation layer, (2) middle porous polyvinylidene fluoride layer and (3) inner CNT layer as support. Apart from their intrinsic functions as separation membranes, they can construct a complete electrochemical system, in which two CNT layers are also designed as electrodes and the PVDF layer as insulating separator. Low-concentration microcystin-LR can be cost-efficiently and continuously removed (u003e99.8%) by these CNT ultrafiltration membranes through facile switches between adsorption and desorption/electrochemical oxidation. Such switches can be achieved at a high flux of 500\u00a0L\u00a0m \u22122 \u00a0h \u22121  without terminating filtration process. Degradation product analysis has evidenced the breaking of Mdda chains that are largely responsible for the toxicity of microcystins. This work synergistically combines adsorption and electrochemistry with membrane separation, and highlights their potentials for advanced wastewater treatment and drinking water purification.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The unique charge carrier migration with electrons transferring from photocatalytic oxidation system to photocatalytic reduction system in Z-scheme system is the key step which ensures their high reduction and oxidation capacities. However, it is difficult to control this vectorial electron transfer as it could only be realized with the downward band bending from photocatalytic oxidation system (PS II) to photocatalytic reduction system (PS I) at the interface. For ferroelectric materials, different band bending can be formed due to the switched polarization-induced electric fields inside the materials, and the required band bending can be obtained using suitable poling conditions. Therefore, Z-schematic charge carrier transfer should be enhanced by inserting a ferroelectric material with downward band bending between PS II and PS I. Herein, this inference was verified by the improved photocurrent density and generated reactive oxygen species on BiVO 4 -BiFeO 3 -CuInS 2 + with the polarization-induced electric field oriented from CuInS 2  to BiVO 4 . Finally, the photocatalytic degradation rate of 4-nitrophenol on BiVO 4 -BiFeO 3 -CuInS 2  was proved to be 2.8 and 16.9 times higher than those on CuInS 2  and BiVO 4 -CuInS 2 , respectively, and the degradation rate of 2,4-dichlorophenol on the former was 1.6 and 3.4 times those on the latter, demonstrating the polarization-induced electric field led to improved photocatalytic performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Coupling membrane filtration with photocatalysis provides a promising way to improve the membrane performance for water treatment. However, the quick recombination of photogenerated electron-holes and poor visible-light response limit the performance of photocatalytic membrane. Herein, a g-C 3 N 4 /CNTs/Al 2 O 3  membrane was prepared through sequentially coating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) layer with high electroconductivity and g-C 3 N 4  layer with good visible-light response on Al 2 O 3  membrane support. When a positive voltage was applied on the CNTs layer, photogenerated electrons in the visible light irradiated g-C 3 N 4  layer could be drawn away and separated from the holes, thus rendering membrane with photoelectrocatalytic function and largely improved performance. The membrane filtration integrated with photoelectrocatalysis (PECM) showed enhanced phenol removal with the increase of voltage supply. At 1.0\u00a0V, the PECM process displayed photoelectric synergetic effect, whose phenol removal efficiency was 2.7, 2.0 and 10.1 times higher than that of filtration with visible light irradiation (PCM), filtration with 1.0\u00a0V and filtration alone, respectively. The PECM also presented improved antifouling capability during the removal of natural organic matters. Its stable permeability (measured at 1.5\u00a0V) was 1.4 and 3.0 times higher than that of PCM and filtration alone, respectively. Significantly, the PECM also displays outstanding capability in surface water treatment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Protons tend to bond strongly with unsaturated-coordinate S element located at the edge of nano-MoS 2  and are consequently reduced to H 2 . Therefore, increasing the active S atoms quantity will be a feasible approach to enhance hydrogen evolution. Herein we developed a porous TiO 2  derived from metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as scaffold to restrict the growth and inhibit the aggregation of MoS 2  nanosheets. As a result, the thickness of the prepared MoS 2  nanosheets was less than 3\u00a0nm (1\u20134 layers), with more edges and active S atoms being exposed. This few-layer MoS 2 -porous TiO 2  exhibits a H 2  evolution rate of 897.5\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0h \u22121 \u00a0g \u22121 , which is nearly twice as much as free-stand MoS 2  nanosheets and twenty times more than physical mixture of MoS 2  with porous TiO 2 . The high performance is attributed to that more active edge sites in few-layer MoS 2 -porous TiO 2  are exposed than pure MoS 2.  This work provides a new method to construct MOFs derived porous structures for controlling MoS 2  to expose active sites for HER.",

In this study, a narrow band gap Ag-based semiconductor Ag 2 CrO 4  with broad visible light response range (\u03bb\u00a0 3 N 4  for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . A series of Z-scheme Ag 2 CrO 4 /Ag/g-C 3 N 4  composites were synthesized via facile in-situ growth strategy and photoreduction approach, and their photocatalytic performances for 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) degradation were evaluated under visible light irradiation (\u03bb\u00a0u003e\u00a0420\u00a0nm). Benefiting from the broadband light utilization of the composite and efficient separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers, as well as the sufficient redox capacities of the photogenerated electrons and holes, the as-synthesized composites displayed remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity for 2,4-DCP degradation, which was about 5.2 times as high as that over individual g-C 3 N 4 . Meanwhile, mechanism study through the active species trapping, electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments and band edge position estimation analysis provided evidences that the possible enhancing photocatalytic mechanism was ascribed to the Z-scheme. This work will shed light on design of other efficient g-C 3 N 4 -based Z-scheme photocatalytic systems for application in environmental remediation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nanofiltration (NF) provides an effective strategy for rejecting large organic molecules. However, attaining high permeability, antifouling ability and good selectivity simultaneously still remains a crucial task for existing NF technologies. Herein, we built a photo-assisted multifunctional NF membrane assembled with g-C 3 N 4 , TiO 2 , carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene oxide (GO), in which CNTs not only expand the interlayer space between neighbored graphene sheets, but also enhance the stability and strength of GO layer. Benefiting from the photo-assistance, our NF membranes show an enhanced water flux (\u223c16\u00a0L\u00a0m \u22122 \u00a0h \u22121 \u00a0bar \u22121 ), while keep a high dye rejection (\u223c100% for Methyl Orange). The photo-assisted NF membranes also display good rejection ratio for salt ions (i.e., 67% for Na 2 SO 4 ) due to the layer-by-layer sieving. Meanwhile, the NF membrane coupled with photocatalysis exhibits a multifunctional characteristic for the efficient removal of ammonia (50%), antibiotic (80%) and bisphenol A (82%) in water. Besides, the performance of integrated system is also tested by treating the real aquaculture wastewater to evaluate its practical application ability. The lost flux of the fouled membrane is effectively recovered by the photochemically assisted process. Hence, this work mitigates the longstanding challenge of GO-based NF membranes in large-scale application by integrating photocatalysis and nanofiltration technologies.",

Heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts have been demonstrated to be promising alternatives to homogeneous catalysts because of their reusability and lack of sludge production. These catalysts, however, generally show low activity for generating    OH due to their limited exposed active sites and difficulty in the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II). Here, enhanced catalytic performance was achieved by using an iron-based metal organic framework (MIL-88B-Fe) as a heterogeneous Fenton-like catalyst over a wide pH range (4\u20136). The catalytic activity of MIL-88B-Fe was about 1\u20133 orders of magnitude higher than that of three other conventional catalysts (Fe 2 O 3 , \u03b1-FeOOH, and Fe 3 O 4 ) and two other iron-based MOFs (MIL-53-Fe and MIL-101-Fe). The superior activity of MIL-88B-Fe could originate from the abundance of active sites, the flexible structure, and facilitated reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II). Hydroxyl radicals generated from reaction between MIL-88B-Fe and H 2 O 2  were the main reactive oxidative species for phenol degradation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A rational design and precise control over charge carriers transportation in Z-scheme system is favorable for achieving its optimal photocatalytic performance. Herein, a ternary composite Z-scheme photocatalyst with Au@CdS selectively deposited on the {010} facets of BiVO 4  was prepared. Due to the fact that the CB edge and VB edge of the {110} facet of BiVO 4  are higher than those of its {010} facet, the photo-generated electrons and holes in well-faceted BiVO 4  transferred to the {010} and {110} facets, respectively. The electrons on the {010} facets of BiVO 4  transferred through Au NPs as the electron mediator to combine with holes of CdS at the interface. Benefiting from the dual-facilitated charge carriers transportation in Z-scheme and well-faceted BiVO 4  crystals, the photocatalytic efficiency of the optimal ternary BiVO 4 -Au@CdS hybrids is 6.11, 3.03 and 2.95 times higher than those of BiVO 4 , BiVO 4 -Au and BiVO 4 -CdS toward Rhodamine B degradation and 1.46 times higher than that of BiVO 4  (random facets)-Au@CdS toward 4-nonylphenol degradation.

        "abstract": "Abstract   It\u2019s significant to develop efficient and durable metal-free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The ORR performance of metal-free electrocatalysts are known to be limited by insufficient activity compared with platinum catalysts. Optimizing the configuration of porous texture or electronic structure can create and expose more active sites as well as facilitate mass transfer, which are effective ways to improve ORR activity. Here we fabricated a core-shell N-doped hierarchically porous carbon nanopolyhedras (CS-HPCNs) derived from core-shell ZIF-8@ZIF-8 single crystals. The pore characteristics and doped N species of catalysts were tuned by controlling the carbonization process for higher ORR activity. CS-HPCNs exhibited increased mesopore volume and surface area, higher contents of pyridinic and graphitic N compared with carbon nanocubes (HPCNs) without core-shell structure. Compared to commercial Pt/C catalyst, CS-HPCN1000-5 (carbonized at 1000\u202f\u00b0C for 5\u202fh) showed comparable onset potential, higher limiting current density and kinetic current density in an approximate four-electron ORR process. The large mesopore volume and surface area of such core-shell hierarchically porous structures, together with high contents of pyridinic and graphitic N, contributed to its good ORR activity. The construction of hierarchically porous structures with enhanced mesopore volume and surface area in metal-free N-doped carbon catalyst is proved to be an efficient approach to boost ORR activity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Excitonic effect, originated from the strong Coulomb attraction between electron and hole, plays an important role in the photocatalytic process of polymeric materials but has been long ignored. In view point of hot-carriers generation, the dissociation of Frenkel excitons is proposed as an effective way to improve the photocatalytic performance of polymeric photocatalysts. Herein, by taking graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) as an example, we verify that endowing g-C 3 N 4  with electron storage ability can facilitate exciton dissociation by extracting electrons from bound electron-hole couples around the electron stotage sites, therefore enhancing the hot-carriers harvest and suppressing the charge recombination. Benefiting from these advantages, the as-prepared material demonstrates excellent photocatalytic performance for both H 2  evolution and H 2 O 2  generation. As a result, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) for H 2  evolution at 420 nm reaches 55%, which is much higher than most of the reported polymeric materials. The study described here offers a new way for designing advanced polymeric photocatalysts toward high performance solar energy conversion via excitonic engineering.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Recently cobalt-based heterogeneous catalysts have been widely investigated for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation in sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation processes. However, the improvement of the catalytic performance for PMS activation remains to be a challenge. As the limiting step, the rapid transformation of Co II /Co III  redox pairs is crucial for PMS activation. Perovskites attract increasing attention due to their controllable oxidation state of B-site metal and formation of oxygen vacancies, which accelerates the cycle of redox pairs. LaCo 1-x M x O 3  (M\u202f=\u202fCu, Fe and Mn) perovskites as heterogeneous catalysts of PMS were synthesized for the degradation of phenol. The results showed that LaCo 0.4 Cu 0.6 O 3  exhibited the highest catalytic activity. The pseudo first-order kinetic constant of phenol degradation on LaCo 0.4 Cu 0.6 O 3  is 0.302\u202fmin \u22121 , being about 5 times as high as Co 2+  with same molar concentration of cobalt in LaCo 0.4 Cu 0.6 O 3 . XPS analysis confirmed that substitution of copper could promote the cycle of Co II /Co III , thus enhance the catalytic efficiency for PMS activation. The facilitated cycle of Co II /Co III  played a crucial role in the generation of sulfate radicals, hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen. And sulfate radical was the primary radical responsible for pollutants degradation. The results provide insights into constructing novel perovskite catalysts for the removal of organic pollutants in water.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The construction of efficient photocatalytic systems has received considerable attention in the fields of water splitting and environmental remediation because of the great potential of these systems to solve the current energy-related and environmental problems. Herein, a two-dimensional BiOIO 3 /graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) heterostructured composite bearing BiOIO 3  nanoplates coupled with g-C 3 N 4  nanosheets has been fabricated through a facile electrostatic self-assembly method. The as-prepared hybrids exhibit significantly improved photocatalytic activities toward 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) degradation and hydrogen evolution in water splitting under simulated solar light irradiation over those of bare g-C 3 N 4 . The apparent rate constant, k, for 2,4,6-TCP degradation (0.97\u202fh \u22121 ) and the hydrogen evolution rate (56.4\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fh \u22121 ) of the BiOIO 3 /g-C 3 N 4  composites are approximately 4.8 and 3.5 times higher, respectively, than those of g-C 3 N 4 . The outstanding activity of the hybrids arises from the Z-scheme charge transfer mode, which imparts a superior photogenerated carrier separation ability and strong redox capability. In this Z-scheme, the I 3  \u2212 /I \u2212  redox pairs formed at the contact interface between BiOIO 3  and g-C 3 N 4  act as electron mediators. This work provides insight into the rational design of other two-dimensional Z-scheme composites with applications in solar energy conversion and environmental remediation.",

        "abstract": "Heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction has been extensively investigated to eliminate refractory organic contaminants in wastewater, but it usually shows low catalytic performance due to difficulty in reduction from Fe(III) to Fe(II). In this study, enhanced catalytic efficiency was obtained by employing Cu-doped BiFeO3 as heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts, which exhibited higher catalytic performance toward the activation of H2O2 for phenol degradation than un-doped BiFeO3. BiFe0.8Cu0.2O3 displayed the best performance, which yielded 91% removal of phenol (10 mg L\u20131) in 120 min. The pseudo first-order kinetic rate constant of phenol degradation in BiFe0.8Cu0.2O3 catalyzed heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction was 5 times higher than those of traditional heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts, such as Fe3O4 and goethite. The phenol degradation efficiency could still reach 83% after 4 cycles, which implied the good stability of BiFe0.8Cu0.2O3. The high catalytic activity of BiFe0.8Cu0.2O3 was attributed to the fact that the doping Cu into BiFeO3 could promote the generation of Fe(II) in the catalyst and then facilitate the activation of H2O2 to degrade the organic pollutants.Open image in new window",

The properties of H 2 O 2  formation and recovery of Fe 2+  are critical factors in electro-Fenton process, which is related to the electronic structure of catalysts. In this work, the electronic structure of carbon was controlled by incorporation of fluorine (F), which facilitated H 2 O 2  generation and accelerated the recycle of Fe 2+  from Fe 3+ , thus enhancing electro-Fenton activity.

Owing to the attractive photocatalytic efficiency of g-C 3 N 4  NS under visible light irradiation and photogenerated charge separation resulting from the unique hetero-structure between g-C 3 N 4  NS and RGO, g-C 3 N 4  NS/RGO/CA composite photocatalytic membranes exhibited superior performance in water treatment under visible light irradiation. The removal efficiency of Rhodamine B by the integrated process of filtration and visible light driven photocatalysis was four times that of membrane filtration alone. The integrated process also displayed efficient inactivation of  Escherichia coli  at three orders of magnitude higher than that of filtration alone. The permeate flux for the integrated process was 3.7 times that of filtration alone, suggesting its good anti-fouling property under visible light irradiation. The integrated system was employed to treat surface water and evaluate its performance in real water treatment. The integrated process showed much better efficiencies for the removal of COD Mn , TOC, UV 254 , and bacteria from surface water than those of membrane filtration alone. This work gives insight to the effective application of solar energy for the improvement of membrane separation in water treatment.",

        "abstract": "A three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured photocatalyst combined with g-C3N4 quantum dots (QDs) and a TiO2 nanotube array (TNA) was fabricated to form a 3D g-C3N4/TNA nanocomposite by a facile electro-deposition process. The photocatalytic ability of the 3D g-C3N4/TNA was evaluated by measuring the amount of hydrogen generated from water splitting under visible light irradiation. Benefiting from an attractive heterostructure between g-C3N4 and TiO2 leading to a unique photogenerated charge separation, as well as a distinctive 3D well-ordered nanotube structure, this 3D g-C3N4/TNA exhibited an average H2 production of approximately 243 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121, which was approximately 4.7 times higher than that of sole g-C3N4 under the same experimental conditions. Therefore, this work could offer a prospective 3D nanostructure for visible light-driven photocatalytic applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) via two-electron pathway of oxygen reduction reaction is a promising alternative to the current anthraquinone process. The H 2 O 2  production from O 2  is a competing reaction with four-electron O 2  reduction to H 2 O, and the selectivity is related to the adsorption energy of the OOH intermediate on electrocatalysts surface. Generally, the properties for binding of OOH intermediate on catalysts can be controlled by changing its electronic structure. Herein, the electronic structure of porous carbon materials was tuned by doping different types and contents of fluorine species. The yield of H 2 O 2  generation depended on the F content and the best catalytic activity toward H 2 O 2  electrosynthesis was obtained with F content of 3.41\u202fat.%. The resultant F-doped porous carbon (FPC) catalysts exhibited good H 2 O 2  selectivity of 97.5\u201383.0% and the H 2 O 2  production rate could reach 112.6\u2013792.6\u202fmmol\u202fh \u22121 \u202fg \u22121  over the potential range of 0.2\u202fV to \u22120.3 vs. RHE (pH 1). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experiments revealed that the incorporation of CF 2, 3  into carbon plane promotes the activation of O 2  molecule and facilitates desorption of OOH intermediate, which was crucial to H 2 O 2  synthesis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Herein a novel carbon nitride composite with triazine-based crystalline carbon nitride (tri-C 3 N 4 ) vertically aligned on tri- s -traizine-based crystalline carbon nitride (tri- s -tri-C 3 N 4 ) is first proposed for efficient visible light driven (\u03bb\u202fu003e\u202f420\u202fnm) photocatalytic H 2  evolution. The well matched lattice fringes between (002) plane of tri- s -tri-C 3 N 4  and (102) plane of tri-C 3 N 4  characterized by TEM unambiguously demonstrate the successful construction of tight crystalline junction between tri- s -tri-C 3 N 4  and tri-C 3 N 4 . As a result, the crystalline carbon nitride phase junction (tri-/tri- s -tri-C 3 N 4 ) shows a high visible light photocatalytic H 2  evolution activity of 144\u202f\u03bcmol/h, which is 30 times higher than that of pristine g-C 3 N 4 . This outstanding photocatalytic H 2  evolution performance could be attributed to the fact that the construction of crystalline tight junction can greatly enhance the transfer and separation efficiency of photoinduced carriers. This study may provide a new way for rational design of carbon nitride heterojunction for gaining high photocatalytic activity.",

        "abstract": "Ionizable antibiotics have attracted serious concerns because of their variable dissociation forms and thereby rendering unique toxicity and microorganism resistance. Developing an efficient and environmentally friendly method for removing these micropollutants from environmental media remains very challenging. Here, electro-assisted adsorption onto activated carbon fiber in continuous-flow mode was used to remove three ionizable antibiotics, sulfadimethoxine (SDM), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and clarithromycin (CLA), from water. Benefiting from strengthened electrostatic interactions, the adsorption capacities for the target antibiotics (10\u202fmg/L) in flow mode (70.9-202.2\u202fmg/g) increased by \u223c5 times under a potential of 1.0\u202fV (SDM) or\u00a0-1.0\u202fV (CIP and CLA) relative to those of open circuit (OC) adsorption. Meanwhile, effluent concentration decreased from >100\u202f\u03bcg/L to 9.6\u202f\u03bcg/L with removal efficiency increasing from 99.0% to 99.9%. Moreover, high recovery efficiency of ACF up to 96.35\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.65% was achieved by imposing a reverse potential (-1.0\u202fV) relative to that used for SDM adsorption. In addition, trace levels of antibiotics (364-580\u202fng/L) in surface water could be removed effectively to achieve low effluent concentration (0.4-1.2\u202fng/L) and high removal efficiency (99.9%) upon treating up to \u223c1560 bed volumes (BVs), demonstrating the potential of electro-assisted adsorption for practical application in water treatment.",

Covering a protection layer on Si surface is an effective approach to overcome this disadvantage. In this paper, \u03b1-Fe2O3 is demonstrated to be an excellent alternative as a protection material. \u03b1-Fe2O3 layer was deposited around each p-type Si micropillar (SiMP) in well-ordered array by chemical bath deposition method. The diameter of SiMP was 5 mm and the thickness of \u03b1-Fe2O3 layer was about 20 nm. The photoeletrochemical stability of SiMP/\u03b1-Fe2O3 was proved by 10 circles cyclic voltammetry testing. Compared with SiMP, its optical absorption and photocurrent density improved 2 times and 4 times, respectively, and its onset potential for hydrogen evolution moved positively about 0.4 V. These improved performances could be ascribed to the enhanced photogenerated-charge-separation efficiency deriving from built-in electric field at the interface between Si and \u03b1-Fe2O3. The above results show an effective strategy to utilize Si material as photocatalyst or electrode in aqueous solution or moist air.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Membranes provide an effective solution to treat emulsified oily wastewater, but usually have inherent drawbacks: permeability and selectivity trade-off as well as serious membrane fouling. In this study, carbon nanotube-polyvinyl alcohol (CNT-PVA) composite membranes with high water flux and good electrical conductivity were fabricated and then served as cathode during the filtration of  n -hexadecane-in-water emulsion ( n -emulsion) and cutting fluid emulsion (c-emulsion) to improve the oil removal efficiency and alleviate membrane fouling. Results show that oil removal rates increase from 85.2% to 97.6% for  n -emulsion and from 56.7% to 83.0% for c-emulsion after the application of \u22121.5\u202fV. The permeation flux after an operation of 60\u202fmin with \u22121.5\u202fV are 2.3\u202ftimes and 2.2\u202ftimes of those without potential for  n -emulsion and c-emulsion, respectively. Additionally, less oil fouling can be observed from the SEM images of the membrane surface and fouling can be mitigated according to the analysis of fouling model. Cyclic voltammetry and zeta potential analysis demonstrate that electrostatic repulsion rather than electrochemical reactions is responsible for the enhanced oil removal rate and antifouling ability in the filtration process. Furthermore, the results of long term filtration with five runs indicate that the application of potential onto the membranes maintains remarkable stability in high oil removal rate and high flux recovery rate.",

        "abstract": "Pristine Si is oxidized to insulative SiO2 when it comes in contact with air and water. Covering it with a protection layer inhibits passivation of Si and significantly improves its photoelectrochemical performance. In this study, TiOx with gradient change of oxygen stoichiometry ratio (TiOx) was designed as a protection layer and fabricated via a chemical vapour deposition process in Ar flow under 400 \u00b0C for 1 min. The anaerobic atmosphere and short heating duration synergistically produced the ratio of O and Ti lower than two in the prepared film. XPS analysis suggested the existance of TiO2 only at the surface of TiOx film and Ti3+ and Ti2+ appeared successively with the increase of distance to the surface. The first advantage of lower-valence-state Ti and oxygen deficiency was to inhibit the oxidation of Si and to reduce electric resistance of the interface and the protection layer. The second advantage was to create a defect energy level under the conduction band of TiO2 which provided the possibility for holes in the valence band of Si to be transferred to this defect level. This tunnel like transfer enhanced the photogenerated charge separation and redox ability of TiOx\u2013Si which brought a 3.25 folds enhancements in photocurrent density compared to that of stoichiometric TiO2\u2013Si at 0 V (SCE) under simulated sunlight. This study highly motivates further research on transparent and conductive protection layer of Si photoelectrode.",

        "abstract": "Based on the Hagen\u2013Poiseuille equation, theoretical membrane permeability is inversely and directly proportional to its thickness and pore-radius, respectively, indicating that a thin membrane with an effective pore-radius is extremely permeable. However, the trade-off between selectivity and permeability restricts their applications for pressure-driven separation membranes. Hence, balancing the contradiction between the permeability and selectivity of a separation membrane is desired in future applications. Herein, we report a superpermeable nanoporous carbon (PC) membrane which offers a separation layer (\u223c80 nm) and effective pore radius (\u223c20 nm) by selectively removing parts of carbon atoms, thus greatly decreasing the transport resistance of water molecules through the membrane. The experimental results have shown a water flux of \u223c8000 L m\u22122 h\u22121 bar\u22121 for the membrane. High selectivity is demonstrated via selective separation of nanoparticles with their narrowly distributed pores. Self-production of H2O2 and self-circulation of Fe2+/Fe3+ was achieved simultaneously on the PC membrane via coupling with electro-Fenton technology, which leads to the in situ production of hydroxyl radicals. The removal efficiencies of organic contaminants (SMX, BPA and phenol) by electro-Fenton driven PC membranes were \u223c96.3%, \u223c97.4% and 92.1%, respectively. Given their compatible high permeability and high selectivity, our porous PC membranes might provide an alternative as future membranes and motivate the design of innovative membranes.",

Empirical evidence suggests that ultrathin membranes may achieve the ultimate permeation and the preclusion of irreversible fouling. Considering the atomic thickness of graphene, we present for the first time a direct growth method of molecularly thin porous graphene membranes, through a synchronous thermal conversion and chemical etching process. Such graphene membranes allow for ultrafast water permeation, affording a permeance of up to 182\u2006000 L m\u22122 h\u22121 bar\u22121, which is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of conventional membranes, with a similar pore size of approximately 50 nm, and comparable to that of the reported state-of-the-art membranes. Additionally, much higher recalcitrance to irreversible fouling (in terms of higher flux recovery after a simple hydrodynamic flush) is observed, compared with polyvinylidene fluoride ultrafiltration membranes, during the filtration of engineered polystyrene nanoparticles and humic acid molecules. Both the high permeability and resistance to irreversible fouling of the graphene membranes can be attributed to their molecularly thin structure, perpendicular pore channels and appropriate surface chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Rational design of high-efficiency carbon-based nanomaterials towards heterogeneous activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for environmental remediation is highly desirable. Codoping of Co and N into carbon may synergistically modify the electronic structure of carbon and enhance its catalytic activity towards PMS. However, the synergistic mechanism between Co and N, especially the role of Co, remains unknown. Herein, Co and N codoped porous carbons (Co\u2013N-PCs) were constructed for enhanced PMS activation. The Co doping level was varied to study the role of Co in Co\u2013N-PCs. Results showed that codoping of Co and N into carbon generated a synergistic effect to enhance PMS activation for the degradation of organic pollutants. The kinetic constant of phenol degradation of the Co\u2013N-PC was 48.4, or 17.6 times larger than that of porous carbon with only N or Co doping, and was superior to that of homogeneous Co2+ (best reported PMS catalyst). Moreover, the catalytic activity of Co\u2013N-PC was significantly enhanced with the increase of Co\u2013N coordination sites (Co\u2013Nx), which could also inhibit Co leaching due to its strong binding. The experimental and DFT results revealed that the synergism of Co and N was ascribed to the combination of their different roles: the N doping mainly produced the charged carbon sites for PMS adsorption, while the Co doping mainly facilitated the electron transfer from carbon to PMS for its dissociation into sulfate radical.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have received significant interest as a promising photocatalyst for environmental remediation due to its high surface area and porous nature. The small pores ( 2\u2009nm) and open pore cavities that can provide right pathways for ingoing and outgoing of molecules during catalysis. Herein, we successfully report stable mesoporous MIL-100(Fe) loaded with ZnO NS by an  in situ  self-assembly method. The prepared samples were characterized by Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) and N 2  adsorption-desorption isotherm to study their surface area and porosity. The catalytic performance of mesoporous MIL-100(Fe) was approximately 2\u20133 order of magnitude more than that of microporous MIL-100(Fe). Such higher catalytic activity in mesoporous MIL-100(Fe) can be ascribed to its mesocellular structure which can improve the molecular diffusion and accessibility inside MOF channels. The charge separation efficiency and photo-Fenton activity of mesoporous MIL-100(Fe) can further be increased by introduction of certain amount of ZnO NS and H 2 O 2 . Moreover, the as synthesized sample shows higher photo-Fenton degradation efficiency at lower pH value with certain amount of H 2 O 2 . Lastly, the possible catalytic mechanism has been tentatively proposed. This study not only used for the pollutants degradation but also provide useful platform for the application of mesoporous MOFs as an efficient photo-Fenton activity to various other fields.",

        "abstract": "By incorporating glucose oxidase-like activity and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs), a novel nanozyme-Fenton system is designed, i.e., ultrasmall AuNPs and \u03b1-FeOOH microcrystals are grown on porous carbons for constructing a nanozyme-Fenton catalyst. AuNPs can catalytically oxidize glucose with oxygen for producing H2O2 (the crucial reagent in Fenton process) and gluconic acid (regulating the pH of micro-environment). Due to the SPR effect, the interaction between the glucose molecules and oscillating local electromagnetic fields contributes to the activation of the glucose molecules, promoting the reaction with O2 in close proximity, thus enhancing the production of H2O2. The heat released from AuNPs by absorbing light energy can increase the system temperature to the optimum condition of the enzymatic reaction. Hot electrons from plasmon-excited AuNPs promote charge separation at the Au/\u03b1-FeOOH interface, leading to efficient cycling of Fe3+/Fe2+. Besides, growing these \u03b1-FeOOH nanocrystals on the porous structures of carbon frameworks is beneficial for the electron transfer between the carbon and \u03b1-FeOOH, and this restricts the leaching of iron ions. This study can provide a novel path for the development of a Fenton-like reaction based on a photo-induced surface plasmon-enhanced nanozyme-Fenton catalyst to improve the \u02d9OH production efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Although Si is a successful photovoltaic material, its application in the photoelectrochemical (PEC) field is limited because an insulated SiO2 layer always extends quickly from surface to depth once bare Si contacts with an aqueous solution. To inhibit this oxidation passivation, Si nanowires (SiNWs) were coated with graphitic-C3N4 quantum dots (g-C3N4 QDs) to form SiNWs@g-C3N4 QDs, in which g-C3N4 QDs acted as a protection layer to isolate Si from water and to improve the photogenerated charge transfer. Observed by SEM and TEM, it was confirmed that dispersive g-C3N4 QDs anchored on the surface of SiNWs. PEC performance indicated that the photocurrent of bare SiNWs declined obviously while the photocurrent of SiNWs@g-C3N4 QDs was stable. The photocurrent of SiNWs@g-C3N4 QDs reached 6.7 mA cm\u22122 at \u22121.5 V (vs. SCE) which was 1.6 times higher than that of pristine SiNWs (4.2 mA cm\u22122). Taking 4-chlorophenol as a target pollutant to investigate the photoelectrocatalytic capability of the SiNWs@g-C3N4 QDs, more than 85% of 4-chlorophenol was successfully removed in 120 min, while the value for SiNWs was only 52.0%. The pseudo-first-order kinetic constant of 4-chlorophenol degradation on SiNWs@g-C3N4 QDs was 2.3 times as great as that on pristine SiNWs. The improved degradation efficiency benefited from the improved stability as well as the enhanced photo-generated charge transfer and separation driven by the built-in electric field at the interface between g-C3N4 QDs and SiNWs. The SiNWs@g-C3N4 QDs will also be useful in other research areas such as water splitting, sensors, etc.",

        "abstract": "Membrane filtration provides an effective solution for removing pollutants from water but is limited by serious membrane fouling. In this work, an effective approach was used to mitigate membrane fouling by integrating membrane filtration with electropolarization using an electroconductive nanocarbon-based membrane. The electropolarized membrane (EM) by alternating square-wave potentials between +1.0 V and -1.0 V with a pulse width of 60 s exhibited a permeate flux 8.1 times as high as that without electropolarization for filtering feed water containing bacteria, which confirms the ability of the EM to achieve biofouling mitigation. Moreover, the permeate flux of EM was 1.5 times as high as that without electropolarization when filtrating natural organic matter (NOM) from water, and demonstrated good performance in organic fouling mitigation with EM. Furthermore, the EM was also effective for complex fouling mitigation in filtering water containing coexisting bacteria and NOM, and presented an increased flux rate 1.9 times as high as that without electropolarization. The superior fouling mitigation performance of EM was attributed to the synergistic effects of electrostatic repulsion, electrochemical oxidation and electrokinetic behaviors. This work opens an effective avenue for membrane fouling mitigation of water-treatment membrane filtration systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nanofiltration offers an effective solution in wastewater treatment by size sieving and particularly electrostatic interaction (Donnan effect). However, its separation performance fluctuates with pH changes because both membrane charge and contaminate ionization are sensitive to pH. Therefore, it is significant to fabricate a nanofiltration membrane with steady separation efficiency over a wide pH range. In this study, a novel pH-responsive reduced graphene oxide membrane intercalated by polyacrylic acid-grafted-carbon nanotube (RGO-gCNT membrane) was designed elaborately. Benefited from the pH-responsive property of polyacrylic acid, the pore size of RGO-gCNT membrane can be narrowed in acid solution and enlarged in basic solution. And the pore sizes at pH 3.0 and pH 8.2 are calculated to be about 0.8 and 1.3\u202fnm, respectively. The results of pH influence on phosphate separation show that phosphate rejection rate of the non-responsive RGO-CNT membrane decreases sharply from 91.6% to 11.1% when the pH changes from 8.2 to 3.0. However, the pH-responsive RGO-gCNT membrane can retain 92.7% and 74.2% of the feed phosphates at pH 8.2 and 3.0, respectively. This novel pH-responsive RGO-gCNT membrane provides reliable separation efficiency over a wide pH range and gives new insight to design smart membranes.",

Inspired by the atomic thickness of graphene, herein we report a four-layered graphene membrane with a thickness of about 2 nm. The ultrathin membrane is facilely fabricated by directly punching a complete graphene sheet through selective removal of some carbon atoms with metal oxide nanoparticles at high temperature. Their perpendicular pore channels spanning the whole thickness could, to a great extent, reduce hydrodynamic resistance for water transport. Experimental tests have revealed a flux of up to 4600 L m\u20132 h\u20131 of the membranes with a pore size of 50 nm and pore density of 1.0 \u00d7 107 cm\u20132 at a pressure of 0.2 bar. This flux is 40\u2013400 times higher than those of conventional ceramic membranes and track-etched membranes. The enhancement in water permeance is attributed to their atomic thickness and straight pore channels. High selectivity is also evidenced b...",

Enzymes are extremely efficient at catalyzing a variety of reactions with high catalytic activity, substrate specificity and yields in living organisms. Inspired by the multiple functions of natural multienzyme systems, an exquisite nanozyme-modified \u03b1-FeOOH/porous carbon (PC) biomimetic catalyst constructed by in situ growth of glucose oxidase-mimicking Au nanoparticles and crystallization of adsorbed ferric ions within carboxyl into hierarchically PC is developed as an efficient enzyme-Fenton catalyst. The products (H2O2, ~4.07 mmol\u2022L-1) of the first enzymatic reaction are immediately used as substrates for the second Fenton-like reaction to generate the valuable \u2022OH (~96.84 \u03bcmol\u2022L-1), thus mimicking an enzyme-cascade pathway. \u03b1-FeOOH nanocrystals, attached by C-O-Fe bondings, are encapsulated into the mesoporous PC frameworks facilitating the electron transfer between \u03b1-FeOOH and porous carbon support and greatly suppressing iron leaching. This study paves a new avenue to design biomimetic enzyme-based Fenton-catalysts mimicking a nature system for \u2022OH production.",

        "abstract": "Z-scheme photocatalytic system shows superiority in degradation of refractory pollutants and water splitting due to the high redox capacities caused by its unique charge transfer behaviors. As a key component of Z-scheme system, the electron mediator plays an important role in charge carrier migration. According to the energy band theory, we believe the interfacial energy band bendings facilitate the electron transfer via Z-scheme mechanism when the Fermi level of electron mediator is between the Fermi levels of Photosystem II (PS II) and Photosystem I (PS I), whereas charge transfer is inhibited in other cases as energy band barriers would form at the semiconductor-metal interfaces. Here, this inference was verified by the increased hydroxyl radical generation and improved photocurrent on WO3-Cu-gC3N4 (with the desired Fermi level structure), which were not observed on either WO3-Ag-gC3N4 or WO3-Au-gC3N4. Finally, photocatalytic degradation rate of 4-nonylphenol on WO3-Cu-gC3N4 was proved to be as high as 11.6 times than that of WO3-gC3N4, further demonstrating the necessity of a suitable electron mediator in Z-scheme system. This study provides scientific basis for rational construction of Z-scheme photocatalytic system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Herein, a continuous-flow-mode photocatalytic disinfection device with the capacity of 1\u00a0m 3 /h was presented. The core reactor of the photocatalytic device was structured by installing a TiO 2  (Degussa P25) coated helical support around a UV lamp into an annular reactor. This photocatalytic device exhibited superior disinfection capability to UV technology. After 2.42\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 6 \u00a0CFU/L of  Escherichia coli  ( E. coli ) suspension flowed through the photocatalytic device, 3.05\u00a0log 10  reduction of  E. coli  was removed, while only 2.57\u00a0log 10  reduction of  E. coli  was removed by UV disinfection device. The residual  E. coli  in the effluent decreased to only 2.16\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 3 \u00a0CFU/L for photocatalytic device, which was distinctly lower than 6.44\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 3 \u00a0CFU/L for UV disinfection process. Photocatalytic disinfection also displayed prominent ability in restraining  E. coli  reactivation. After 24\u00a0h of preservation, concentration of  E. coli  in effluent for UV process was found as 1.20\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 4 \u00a0CFU/L (0.74\u00a0log 10  of increase), 16 times less than 1.99\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 5 \u00a0CFU/L (1.49\u00a0log 10  of increase) of UV process. Moreover, the photocatalytic device exhibited high endurance to flux fluctuation and  E. coli  concentration change. These results demonstrated an access of applying photocatalytic technology to applying for disinfection of wastewater.",

        "abstract": "Hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-PBDEs) are of great concern due to their higher toxicity compared to PBDEs. However, the abiologic process whereby PBDEs are converted to OH-PBDEs in the aquatic environment is not well understood. To explore the possibility of OH-PBDEs photoformation in natural water, the photohydroxylation of BDE-47 has been investigated in aqueous Fe(III) and/or fulvic acid (FA) solutions and in natural lake water under simulated solar light irradiation. The results showed that 6-OH-BDE-47 and 2\u2032-OH-BDE-68 were generated from BDE-47 under these conditions. Based on the identification of derivatives and reactive radicals, OH-PBDEs formation can be ascribed to an addition reaction of ortho-tetra-BDE radical and hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH), with or without a subsequent Smiles rearrangement reaction. Since the ortho-tetra-BDE radical could be readily produced by the photolysis of BDE-47, even in pure water, \u2022OH production was considered as critical for the photoformation of OH-PBD...",

        "abstract": "Nanofiltration (NF) is considered a promising candidate for brackish and sea water desalination. NF exhibits high multivalent ion rejection, but the rejection rate for monovalent ions is relatively low. Besides, great challenges remain for conventional NF membranes to achieve high ion rejection without sacrificing water flux. This work presents an effective strategy for improving the ion rejection of conductive NF membrane without decreasing the permeability through electrically-assisted enhancement of surface charge density. With increasing the external voltage from 0 to 2.5 V, the surface charge density of the membrane increases from 11.9 to 73.0 mC m-2, which is 6.1 times higher than that without external voltage. Correspondingly, the rejection rate for Na2SO4 increases from 81.6 to 93.0% and that for NaCl improves from 53.9 to 82.4%; meanwhile, the membrane retains high permeabilities of 14.0 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 for Na2SO4 filtration and 14.5 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 for NaCl filtration. The Donnan-steric-pore model analysis suggests that the Donnan potential difference between the membrane and bulk solution is increased under electrical assistance, leading to increased ion transfer resistance for improved ion rejection. This work provides new insight into the development of advanced NF technologies for desalination and water treatment.",

This method used low toxic thiourea as a sulfur source and was carried out at 200\u00b0C. Thus, it was better than the traditional methods, which are based on an annealing process at relatively high temperature (above 400\u00b0C) using toxic H2S as reducing agent. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images showed that the morphologies of MoS2/CdS samples were feather shaped and MoS2 layer was on the surface of CdS. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy testified that the sample was composed of stoichiometric MoS2 and CdS. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra displayed that the loading of MoS2 can enhance the optical absorption of MoS2/CdS. The photocatalytic activity of MoS2/CdS was evaluated by producing hydrogen. The hydrogen production rate on MoS 2/CdS reached 192 mol\u00b7h-1. This performance was stable during three repeated photocatalytic processes. \u00a9 2013 Yang Liu et al.",

Its synthesis from the electrochemical reduction of N2 is an attractive alternative to the industrial method that requires high temperature and pressure. Currently, electrochemical N2 fixation has suffered from slow kinetics due to the difficulty of N2 adsorption and N\u2261N cleavage. Here, N-doped porous carbon (NPC) is reported as a cost-effective electrocatalyst for ammonia synthesis from electrocatalytic N2 reduction under ambient conditions, where its N content and species were tuned to enhance N2 chemical adsorption and N\u2261N cleavage. The resulting NPC was effective for fixing N2 to ammonia with a high ammonia production rate (1.40 mmol g\u20131 h\u20131 at \u22120.9 V vs RHE). Experiments combined with density functional theory calculations revealed pyridinic and pyrrolic N were active sites for ammonia synthesis and their contents were crucial for promoting ammonia production on NPC.

        "abstract": "Electrochemical reduction of CO_2 to ethanol, a clean and renewable liquid fuel with high heating value, is an attractive strategy for global warming mitigation and resource utilization. However, converting CO_2 to ethanol remains great challenge due to the low activity, poor product selectivity and stability of electrocatalysts. Here, the B- and N-co-doped nanodiamond (BND) was reported as an efficient and stable electrode for selective reduction of CO_2 to ethanol. Good ethanol selectivity was achieved on the BND with high Faradaic efficiency of 93.2\u2009% (\u22121.0 V vs. RHE), which overcame the limitation of low selectivity for multicarbon or high heating value fuels. Its superior performance was mainly originated from the synergistic effect of B and N co-doping, high N content and overpotential for hydrogen evolution. The possible pathway for CO_2 reduction revealed by DFT computation was CO_2\u2192*COOH\u2192*CO\u2192*COCO\u2192*COCH_2OH\u2192*CH_2OCH_2OH\u2192CH_3CH_2OH.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical reduction of CO to ethanol, a clean and renewable liquid fuel with high heating value, is an attractive strategy for global warming mitigation and resource utilization. However, converting CO to ethanol remains great challenge due to the low activity, poor product selectivity and stability of electrocatalysts. Here, the B- and N-co-doped nanodiamond (BND) was reported as an efficient and stable electrode for selective reduction of CO to ethanol. Good ethanol selectivity was achieved on the BND with high Faradaic efficiency of 93.2\u2009% (-1.0\u2005V vs. RHE), which overcame the limitation of low selectivity for multicarbon or high heating value fuels. Its superior performance was mainly originated from the synergistic effect of B and N co-doping, high N content and overpotential for hydrogen evolution. The possible pathway for CO reduction revealed by DFT computation was CO \u2192*COOH\u2192*CO\u2192*COCO\u2192*COCH OH\u2192*CH OCH OH\u2192CH CH OH.",

The response of Pb2+ on the nanocomposite-modified electrode was evaluated, and the relevant parameters were optimized by square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV).

Much research has focused on increasing the power output of lithium batteries by reducing lithium-ion diffusion distances, but outputs remain far below those of electrochemical capacitors and below the levels required for many applications. Here, we report an alternative approach based on the redox reactions of functional groups on the surfaces of carbon nanotubes. Layer-by-layer techniques are used to assemble an electrode that consists of additive-free, densely packed and functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The electrode, which is several micrometres thick, can store lithium up to a reversible gravimetric capacity of approximately 200 mA h g(-1)(electrode) while also delivering 100 kW kg(electrode)(-1) of power and providing lifetimes in excess of thousands of cycles, both of which are comparable to electrochemical capacitor electrodes. A device using the nanotube electrode as the positive electrode and lithium titanium oxide as a negative electrode had a gravimetric energy approximately 5 times higher than conventional electrochemical capacitors and power delivery approximately 10 times higher than conventional lithium-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "We report the making of chemically reduced graphene (CRG) sheets separated by layer-by-layer-assembled multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) for electrochemical micro-capacitor applications. Submicron thin films of amine-functionalized MWCNTs (MWCNT-NH 2 ) and CRG derived from graphene oxides, were shown to be cross-linked with amide bonds having high packing densities of \u223c70%. These carbon-only electrodes were found to have large volumetric capacitance of \u223c 160 F/cm electrode 3 in an acidic electrolyte (0.5 M H 2 SO 4 ). The electrode capacitance in a neutral electrolyte (1 M KCl) was found much lower, which supported the hypothesis that the observed high capacitances in the acidic electrolyte can be attributed primarily to redox reactions between protons and surface oxygen-containing groups on carbon. 1 Introduction There are a growing number of thin-film electrical energy storage applications from portable electronic devices such as smart cards and e-books, to microelectronics and microsystems, which require higher energy densities than that current micro-capacitor technologies can provide [1\u201310] . Electrochemical capacitors store energy by primarily utilizing electrical double layer (EDL) capacitance and/or surface redox reactions (providing pseudocapacitance), which provide high power (10 kW/kg) and long cycle life but low energy (5 Wh/kg) as compared to rechargeable batteries. State-of-the-art electrodes based on activated carbon (AC) provide reasonably high gravimetric and volumetric capacitances (\u223c200 F/g and \u223c120 F/cm 3 in aqueous electrolytes and \u223c100 F/g and \u223c80 F/cm 3 in organic electrolytes) [11,12] . Recent work on surface functionalization of AC by introducing surface oxygen-containing groups can further increase capacitances up to \u223c400 F/g and \u223c200 F/cm 3 in aqueous electrolytes [13] . The processing of conventional powder-based AC electrodes involves roll-processing methods and doctor-blade techniques, which can control thickness from a few to several hundred microns, but faces many challenges to design more optimized nano-structured, submicron-thick electrodes for micro-scale electronic devices. Very recently AC-based thin-film electrodes of 1\u20132 \u03bcm in thickness prepared by an inkjet printing process have been reported but they exhibit significantly lower capacitances than conventional AC electrodes [5] . Considerable research efforts have been focused on making nano-structured porous carbon electrodes based on carbide-derived carbon [1] , carbon nanotubes [3,6,7,14\u201317] and graphenes [18\u201323] , which allow control and tuning of electrode nanostructures and carbon surface chemistry for charge storage. Recent electrochemical micro-capacitor studies based on carbide-derived carbon [1] have shown that \u223c2-\u03bcm-thick electrodes have much higher volumetric capacitance (\u223c180 F/cm 3 ) than those of \u223c200 \u03bcm of thickness (\u223c30 F/cm 3 ) in organic electrolytes. Decreasing electrode thickness can increase the utilization of electrode surface area in electrochemical reactions and decrease the resistance of ionic and electronic conduction. Although high specific capacitances (up to \u223c135 F/cm 3 for carbon nanotubes [17] and up to \u223c87 F/cm 3 for graphenes [21] in aqueous electrolytes) comparable to AC have been reported for electrodes processed from powder having tens/hundreds of microns in thickness, electrodes made by novel processes that can produce electrode thicknesses smaller than one micron, have shown lower capacitances [6,7] , especially on the electrode volume basis (see details in Table S1 ). Increasing electrode packing densities and coverage of redox-active species on carbon surfaces can increase capacities of thin electrodes required for micro-scale electrochemical capacitors. Previously we have reported the making of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) thin-film electrodes by layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly (LBL-MWCNT/MWCNT) [3] . These films consist of only carbon (binder-free) having a high packing density of MWCNTs (\u223c70%), which show high volumetric capacitances in acidic electrolytes (\u223c130 F/cm 3 ) [3] , and in organic electrolytes (\u223c180 F/cm 3 ) [4] . The new concept we introduce in this work is demonstrating binder-free thin-film electrodes consisting of graphene sheets separated by MWCNTs for electrochemical capacitor applications. Graphene, a single sheet of graphitic layer, has been considered as a promising electrode material for electrochemical capacitors [18\u201322] due to its high surface area (theoretically over 2630 m 2 /g per single layer) [18] , and well-developed surface functionalization methods [24\u201326] . However, graphene sheets can pile up via the \u03c0 \u2013 \u03c0 interaction to have the interlayer distance (\u223c0.34 nm, too small for ions to access) [18,20\u201322] comparable to that in graphite, which prevents full utilization of the surface area of graphene sheets in electrochemical reactions. Very recently LBL assmbly of negatively charged graphene oxide (GO) and positively charged poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI)-MWCNTs have been reported [23] . However, in order to maximize the electrochemically active area of carbon and electrode capacitance, the presence of insulating polymer/binder in the electrode is not desirable. We here describe the alternate assembly of MWCNT-NH 2 (amine-functionalized MWCNT) and GO, after which GO is reduced to CRG (chemically reduced graphene). MWCNTs serve as pillars to separate CRG layers in carbon-only electrodes, which makes the surfaces of graphene sheets electrochemically active. These LBL-assembled MWCNT/CRG electrodes have high volumetric capacitances up to 160 F/cm 3 electrode , which can be attributed to (1) the EDL capacitance and redox reactions between protons and surface oxygen-containing groups on CRGs in an acidic electrolyte; (2) a high packing density of nanostructured MWCNT/CRG surfaces accessible to ions and electrons; and (3) fast ionic and electronic conduction within the electrode nanostructure. 2 Experimental 2.1 Sample preparation 2.1.1 Amine functionalization of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) To introduce amine groups to MWCNT surfaces, the following two steps were used: (1) oxidation of pristine MWCNT (MWCNT-COOH, carboxylic acid groups on MWCNT) and (2) amine-substitution reaction of the oxidized MWCNT [3] . One gram of raw MWCNT (95% purity, NANOLAB) was refluxed in a solution consisting of 150 mL of H 2 SO 4 (96.7%) and 50 mL of HNO 3 (68\u201370%) at 70 \u00b0C for 2 h with stirring, which was then washed in 5% of HCl solution. The oxidized MWCNT dispersion was filtrated at least 3 times using a filter paper having 0.5 \u03bcm of pore size (PC, Whatman\u00ae), which was subsequently dried in air. The oxidized MWCNTs, MWCNT\u2013COOHs, were chlorinated in 100 mL of thionyl chloride (SOCl 2 , Sigma\u2013Aldrich) at 70 \u00b0C for 24 h with stirring and reflux in N 2 . After removing remaining SOCl 2 solution by a distillation, the MWCNTs were aminated by slowly injecting 5 mL of ethylenediamine (NH 2 (CH 2 ) 2 NH 2 , 99.5%, Sigma\u2013Aldrich) into 100 mL of anhydrous toluene (99.8%, Sigma\u2013Aldrich) and stirring at 70 \u00b0C for 24 h under N 2 -purged reflux condition. The amine-functionalized MWCNT (MWCNT-NH 2 ) powders were dried in vacuum at 50 \u00b0C for 24 h after 3 times of washing steps with ethanol and deionized (DI) water ( R = 18.2 M\u03a9). 2.1.2 Chemical oxidation of graphite A graphene oxide (GO) solution was formed by using a modified Hummers method [24,26] . One gram of raw graphite powder (SP-1, Bay Carbon) with 0.5 g of K 2 S 2 O 8 (Fluka) and 0.5 g of P 2 O 5 (Fluka) was stirred in 1.5 mL of H 2 SO 4 solution at 80 \u00b0C for 4.5 h, from which the pre-oxidized graphite was obtained by subsequent filtration with DI water at least 3 times. After overnight drying in air, the pre-oxidized graphite powder was further oxidized in 23 mL of H 2 SO 4 solution with gradual addition of 3 g of KMnO 4 (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) at 0 \u00b0C. After stirring the solution at 36 \u00b0C for 2 h, 46 mL of DI water was slowly added and stirred for 2 h. The oxidation was completed by addition of 140 mL of the DI water and 2.5 mL of H 2 O 2 solution (35%), where the solution color was changed to a light brown. The GO solution was washed, filtrated with 10% of HCl and re-dispersed in DI water, which was then dialyzed for 2 weeks. 2.1.3 Layer-by-layer (LBL) assembled MWCNT-NH 2 and GO film (LBL-MWCNT/GO) An MWCNT-NH 2 powder was dispersed in DI water to be 0.5 mg/mL of concentration with sonication and stirring for several hours. The stable MWCNT-NH 2 colloidal solution was then dialyzed for 2 days before starting a LBL assembly process. 0.18 mg/mL of GO colloidal solution was prepared by an exfoliation of the concentrated GO solution through sonication (100 W for 30 min) and centrifugation (3000 r.p.m. for 30 min) and dilution. The pH values of MWCNT-NH 2 and GO solutions were adjusted to 2.5 and 3.5, where zeta potentials were 33 and \u221242 mV, respectively, and sonicated for 30 min prior to LBL assembly. The LBL assembly of MWCNT/GO was performed by a modified Carl Zeiss DS50 programmable slide stainer on various substrates such as ITO-coated glass (indium tin oxide coated-glass, R s = 4\u20138 \u03a9, Delta Technologies, LTD), quartz (fused, Alfa Aesar), and Si/SiO 2 . Substrates were first air-plasma treated for 5 min then dipped immediately in (1) (+) MWCNT-NH 2 colloidal solution, (2) 3 times of washing solutions (pH = 2.5 of aqueous solutions), (3) (\u2212) GO colloidal solution, and (4) 3 times of washing solutions (pH = 3.5 of aqueous solution) (1 bilayer of MWCNT/GO = 1 cycle from (1) to (4) process). The dipping time of MWCNT-NH 2 or GO solution and three aqueous washing solutions were 30, 2, 1, and 1 min, respectively. The cycle was repeated to reach a desired number of bilayers then the film substrates were dried in air. 2.1.4 Drop-cast GO and MWCNT-NH 2 films on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) A GO or MWCNT-NH 2 electrode for cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements was obtained from drop-casting 40 \u03bcL of GO solution (pH = 3.5, 0.18 mg/mL) or same amount of MWCNT-NH 2 solution (pH = 2.5, 0.5 mg/mL) on polished GCE (Pine Research Instrument, diameter = 5 mm). The electrode was dried slowly in air for 24 h. 2.1.5 Vacuum-filtrated GO film for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR FT-IR) analyses GO solution (0.37 wt.%) was vacuum filtrated using filter papers having 0.5 \u03bcm of pores. A uniform and substrate-free GO film was obtained after drying in air. 2.1.6 A conversion of GO to chemically reduced graphene (CRG) using hydrazine vapor treatment The MWCNT/GO and GO films formed through abovementioned procedures could be reduced to MWCNT/CRG and CRG, respectively, by hydrazine vapor via a bubbler [27] . The films in a closed cell were first exposed to dry N 2 gas at a flow rate of \u223c140 cc/min for 1 h at room temperature. After heating the cell up to 120 \u00b0C, the hydrazine vapor (anhydrous hydrazine solution, 98%, Sigma\u2013Aldrich) was passed using \u223c115 cc/min of flowing N 2 gas for 24 h then the cell was cooled down to room temperature in N 2 . 2.2 Analysis 2.2.1 Characterization Zeta potential values of colloidal solutions were measured using a zeta potential analyzer (Zeta PALS, Brookhaven Instrument Corporation), and were calculated by the Smoluchowski method. Thickness and area mass density measurements of LBL-MWCNT/GO and MWCNT/CRG films were performed using a surface profilometer (P-16, Tencor) in air at room temperature and a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM, Masscal Scientific Instruments) under dry N 2 gas flow at \u223c29 \u00b0C, respectively. To investigate thickness of LBL-MWCNT/GO and MWCNT/CRG, the films deposited on substrates were crossly scratched by a razor blade and height differences between film surface and scratched section touched to the rigid substrate were taken at least four different areas per one sample. For the QCM measurements, the LBL-MWCNT/GO films were uniformly deposited on QCM substrates (Au-film coated-quartz, diameter of top surface of gold: 1.3 cm) using the LBL process, which was subsequently treated with hydrazine in flowing N 2 at 120 \u00b0C to produce MWCNT/CRG films. A reliable data could be obtained by (1) dry N 2 gas flow for a removal of moistures and (2) keeping a stable motional resistance (mechanical damping indicator of QCM substrate) less than 20 \u03a9 during the measurement. The frequencies of the bare and film-deposited QCM quartz substrates were recorded in 5 min, and the difference in frequencies gave rise to the film area mass densities based on the Sauerbrey equation. The film densities were finally obtained by combining thickness from the profilometer measurements and area mass density results. Sheet resistances of LBL-MWCNT/GO and MWCNT/CRG films were measured by a 4-point probe (Signatone S-302-4) with device analyzer (Keithley 4200), from which electronic conductivities were calculated with the film thickness information obtained from the profilometer measurements. Surface morphologies of the LBL and drop-cast electrode films were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM, Digital Instrument EnvironScope, Vecco) via a tapping mode, scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL 6320), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2010). Image root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of those films was examined from AFM images with a size of 5 \u00d7 5 \u03bcm 2 . XPS data before and after hydrazine-treatment of LBL-MWCNT/GO, vacuum-filtrated GO, and MWCNT-NH 2 were obtained by Kratos AXIS ultra imaging XPS. All spectra were calibrated with the C 1s photoemission peak for sp 2 -hybridized carbons at 284.5 eV. Curve fitting of the photoemission spectra was done after a Shirley type background subtraction. IR and UV\u2013vis absorption spectra of LBL-MWCNT/GO and MWCNT/CRG films were collected on ATR FT-IR (Nicolet Magna 860), and UV\u2013vis-NIR dual-beam spectrophotometer (Care 5E), respectively. 2.2.2 Electrochemical measurements A 3-electrode cell was used including the LBL-MWCNT/GO or MWCNT/CRG film-deposited ITO-coated glass (or electrode-deposited GCE) as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, Analytical Sensor Inc.) as the reference electrode. CVs were collected between \u22120.242 and 0.80 V versus SCE in a 0.5 M of Ar-saturated H 2 SO 4 solution with a sweep rate of 50 mV/s by using bipotentiostat (Pine Research Instrument), from which capacitances were calculated. 3 Results and discussion The making of MWCNT/CRG electrodes is shown in Fig. 1 . LBL-MWCNT/GO films were first assembled by alternatively dipping plasma-treated ITO-coated glass slides into the MWCNT-NH 2 and GO colloidal dispersions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of a GO sheet and an MWCNT-NH 2 are shown in Fig. 2 a and b, respectively. Zeta potential measurements show that positively charged MWCNT-NH 2 and negatively charged GO colloidal dispersions are both very stable in the pH range of 1\u20134 while the CRG was unstable at low pHs ( Fig. S1 ). The GO sheets were sequentially built up on the substrate in alternation with MWCNT-NH 2 via electrostatic interactions [28] . Topographic AFM images of a 1-bilayer LBL film in Fig. 2 c\u2013d reveal an adsorbed monolayer of GO sheets on top of a monolayer of MWCNTs, where the height profile of individual GO sheet is \u223c1.3 nm [26] . With increasing number of bilayers, LBL-MWCNT/GO films remain relatively smooth (with RMS roughness of \u223c18 nm for 10 bilayers in Fig. 2 e and \u223c36 nm for 20 bilayers in Fig. 2 f). The LBL-MWCNT/GO films were then reduced to MWCNT/CRG using hydrazine vapor at 120 \u00b0C for 24 h. High-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of an MWCNT/CRG film show that MWCNTs and CRG sheets are distributed uniformly in-plane in Fig. 3 a and through the film thickness in Fig. 3 b, which clearly shows CRG sheets in the MWCNT matrix. In addition, TEM images of a piece of MWCNT/CRG in Fig. 3 c, which was scratched out from the substrate, further confirm that MWCNTs and CRG sheets are randomly dispersed ( Fig. 3 d). A representative optical image of LBL-MWCNT/GO films with 5\u201320 bilayers ( Fig. 4 a) shows notably decreased transparency with increasing film thicknesses. The thicknesses of LBL-MWCNT/GO and MWCNT/CRG films, measured by using a profilometer, linearly increase with the number of bilayers ( Fig. 4 b). This trend is in agreement with linearly increased absorption intensities in the UV\u2013visible spectra as a function of the number of bilayers ( Fig. S2 ). It is interesting to note that the addition of GO layers to films with 4.5, 9.5, 14.5 and 19.5 bilayers, which have MWCNT-NH 2 as the top layer, did not lead to any significant increases in the film thicknesses considering experimental uncertainty ( Fig. 4 b). The observation suggests that the volume fraction of GO in the LBL-MWCNT/GO film is small, and some GOs may fill the pore space of MWCNTs [29] . Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements show that the apparent density of as-prepared LBL-MWCNT/GO films ( d LBL-MWCNT/GO ) is \u223c0.92 g/cm 3 ( Fig. 5 ) and the volume percentage of GO in the LBL-MWCNT/GO films ( V volume% of GO ) was estimated to be \u223c10% (see Appendix ). After the hydrazine treatment, MWCNT/CRG electrodes have a comparable density of \u223c0.92 g/cm 3 to MWCNT/GO ( Fig. 5 ). Assuming X-ray densities of 1.2 g/cm 3 for MWCNTs and 2.2 g/cm 3 for CRGs, the result suggests that MWCNT/CRG electrodes have a high packing density of (\u223c70%). It is interesting to note that the packing density of MWCNT/CRG films (underwent a hydrazine treatment at 120 \u00b0C) is greater than as-assembled LBL-MWCNT/MWCNT electrodes (\u223c60%) and is comparable to LBL-MWCNT/MWCNT electrodes after heat-treatments up to 300 \u00b0C reported previously [3,4] , which is among the highest packing densities of carbon-based electrodes reported to date [5,6,13\u201322] . The hydrazine treatment clearly enhanced the electronic transport characteristics of the electrode films. The electronic conductivities of LBL-MWCNT/GO and MWCNT/CRG with 4.5\u201320 bilayers were measured from a 4-point probe and exhibited \u223c6 times higher values for MWCNT/CRG relative to LBL-MWCNT/GO ( Fig. 6 a and b ). It is interesting to note that the MWCNT/GO films with a GO top layer have lower conductivities than those with an MWCNT-NH 2 top layer (e.g., the conductivities of 5 versus 4.5 bilayer), which is expected from the insulating characteristics of GO sheets [30] . However, this behavior is no longer present after the hydrazine treatment, which is in agreement with the improved conductivity of the CRG sheets. The increased electronic conductivity of MWCNT/CRG electrodes can be attributed to removal of considerable oxygens from the GO sheets after the thermal reduction step. X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) analysis in Table 1 reveals that LBL-MWCNT/GO ( Fig. S3 ) has \u223c24 at.% (atomic concentration) of O, which is in agreement with \u223c31 at.% of O found for vacuum-filtered GO films ( Fig. S4 ). Upon the hydrazine treatment, the surface O of both samples is decreased by \u223c9 at.% while surface N reaches \u223c6 at.%. On the contrary, MWCNT-NH 2 powder itself shows a negligible change of surface O content after the same hydrazine treatment ( Fig. S5 ). Therefore, it is proposed that the reduced O content in the MWCNT/CRG relative to LBL-MWCNT/GO originates from cut lysed hydroxyl and epoxide groups of GO sheets ( Fig. 7 a and Fig. S3 ). In addition, the N content in the MWCNT/CRG film is increased relative to LBL-MWCNT/GO presumably resulting from nitrogen doping from the hydrazine vapor. The N 1 s peak indicates the presence of only amide bonds (399.9 \u00b1 0.1 eV in N 1s [31] ) in MWCNT/CRG instead of both amine ( NH 3 + , 401.8 \u00b1 0.2 eV in N 1s [31] ) and amide bonds in MWCNT/GO ( Fig. 7 b), which indicates that the hydrazine treatment can induce cross-linking between carboxylic acid groups of GO/CRG and amine groups of MWCNT-NH 2 [32] . This hypothesis is further supported by attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform IR (ATR-FTIR) spectra, which shows more visible features for amide bonds (1500\u20131750 cm \u22121 of wavenumber) in the MWCNT/CRG films than LBL-MWCNT/GO ( Fig. 7 c) but not in GO powder nor CRG powder ( Fig. 7 d) subject to the hydrazine treatment. Electrochemical properties of LBL-MWCNT/GO and MWCNT/CRG films were investigated using cyclic voltammograms (CVs) in three-electrode cells since this three-electrode setup can be a useful diagnostic tool to investigate intrinsic charge storage mechanism of materials including EDL capacitance and pseudocapacitance [33] . CVs of LBL-MWCNT/GO (350\u2013370 nm of thickness and 55\u201360 \u03bcg of mass in 20 bilayers) and MWCNT/CRG films (330\u2013350 nm of thickness and 50\u201355 \u03bcg of mass in 20 bilayers) show a rectangular shape in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 at a sweep rate of 50 mV/s ( Fig. 8 a). Averaged volumetric and specific capacitances of as-prepared LBL-MWCNT/GO films are 58 \u00b1 6 F/cm electrode 3 and 63 \u00b1 7 F/g electrode , respectively (see Appendix ). After the hydrazine treatment at 120 \u00b0C, the volumetric and specific capacitances of MWCNT/CRG films increase significantly to 144 \u00b1 16 F/cm electrode 3 and 157 \u00b1 18 F/g electrode , respectively. All MWCNT/CRG films of different thicknesses have comparable specific and volumetric capacitances as current ( Fig. 8 b) and integrated charge per unit film area linearly increases with the number of bilayers ( Fig. S6 ). The markedly enhanced capacitances of MWCNT/CRG relative to LBL-MWCNT/GO can be attributed primarily to the conversion to CRGs from GOs in the films. This is in agreement with the fact that the capacitance change of MWCNT-NH 2 upon the hydrazine treatment was negligible. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that MWCNT-NH 2 powder, which was drop-cast on the electrode, shows a negligible change of its specific capacitance before and after the hydrazine treatment while the specific capacitance of CRG powder is remarkably enhanced from that of GO ( Fig. 9 c and d , Table 1 ). In addition, the specific capacitance values of both drop-cast MWCNT-NH 2 and CRG on GCE are significantly smaller than those of MWCNT/CRG films ( Table 1 ). This result highlights the importance of electrode nanostructure (made from LBL ( Fig. 2 e\u2013f) versus drop-cast ( Fig. 9 a and b), which is key to allow easy electron and ion access to carbon surfaces and to optimize electrode capacitances per unit volume or weight. Moreover, it is interesting to note that the volumetric capacitances of MWCNT/CRG electrodes are higher than those of graphene [22] , MWCNT/graphene [23] and MWCNTs [3] in aqueous electrolytes. As capacitances obtained from three-electrode measurements can be higher than those obtained from two-electrode measurements [33] , it should be noted that the capacitances of LBL-MWCNT/GO and MWCNT/CRG films were compared only with those reported values from three-electrode measurements ( Table S1 ). High capacitances of MWCNT/CRG films can be attributed to EDL capacitance and additional charge storage via surface redox (Faradaic) processes. Reversible cathodic and anodic peaks at 0.25\u20130.35 V (versus SCE) were found for MWCNT/CRG films ( Fig. 8 a). It has been reported that the functional groups containing oxygen and/or nitrogen heteroatoms on graphitic layers can participate in charge transfer reactions with protons in electrolytes, of which redox reaction influences on delocalized \u03c0 electrons and electronic properties of the carbon matrix [34] . As the temperature (120 \u00b0C) of the hydrazine treatment in this work is too low to produce electrochemically active heterocyclic nitrogens, e.g., pyridine and pyrrole [34\u201336] , the nitrogen-derivatives in the CRG and MWCNT-NH 2 are expected to have a minor impact on the Faradaic process. Therefore, it is hypothesized that oxygen-containing groups such as quinone and carbonyl groups on the graphitic layers of CRGs are responsible for the redox peaks as they become reduced or oxidized in the acidic solution (e.g., quinone + 2H + + 2e \u2212 \u2194 hydroquinone) as proposed previously for similar redox peaks of carbon materials [37,38] . This hypothesis is supported by much smaller capacitances for MWCNT/CRG electrodes, and the disappearance of these redox peaks in 1 M KCl ( Fig. 8 c), where a similar change in the redox peak as a function of pH has been reported previously for a carbon-cloth electrode [38] . Volumetric and specific capacitances of the MWCNT/CRG film in the KCl electrolyte, which can be attributed primarily to EDL capacitance, are \u223c50% less than those found in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 . It is interesting to note that such redox peaks were not observed in the LBL-MWCNT/GO film nor in previously reported LBL-PEI-MWCNT/CRG electrodes (with a polymer component) [23] in acidic electrolytes. It is postulated that the absence of redox peaks can be attributed to poor electronic conductivity of GO within the LBL-MWCNT/GO film, preventing the effective utilization of oxygen-containing groups on the GO surface. 4 Summary In summary, we report the synthesis of carbon-only MWCNT/CRG thin-films that are cross-linked with amide bonds, which has a packing density of \u223c70%. Thin-film electrodes (330\u2013350 nm of thickness) were shown to have high specific (up to 175 F/g electrode ) and high volumetric (up to 160 F/cm electrode 3 ) capacitances from three-electrode measurements. The porous MWCNT/CRG network creates fast electronic and ionic conduction channels and surface oxygen-containing functional groups on CRGs enhance capacitances in aqueous electrolytes. Although the capacitances of two-electrode cells or electrochemical capacitors having MWCNT/CRG thin films are dependent on electrode thickness, the electrolyte, and counter electrode used, these nanostructured carbon-only electrodes show promise as a platform to design to design high-performance, thin-film electrodes in micro-scale electrochemical capacitors for thin film devices and microsystems such as on-chip power, energy harvesting storages and sensors.

Appendix A A.1 Estimation of volumetric fraction of GO in the LBL-MWCNT/GO Provided that the packing of MWCNTs in the LBL-MWCNT/GO films is the same as that in the LBL-MWCNT/MWCNT films ( d LBL-MWCNT/MWCNT : \u223c0.74 g/cm 3 , without any heat treatment steps [3] ), the volume percentage of GO in the LBL-MWCNT/GO films ( V volume % of GO ) is \u223c10%, which can be estimated using Eq. (1) : (1) V volume % of GO = ( d LBL-MWCNT/GO - d LBL-MWCNT/MWCNT ) d GO \u00d7 100 where the density of GO ( d GO ) is 1.8 g/cm 3 [39] . A.2 Estimation of volumetric capacitances Volumetric capacitances (F/cm 3 ) were calculated by Eq. (2) , of which values were converted to specific capacitances by using area mass densities ( Fig. 5 ). 3 samples of LBL-MWCNT/GO and 8 samples of MWCNT/CRG were used to attain the volumetric capacitance averages and their standard deviations used as error bars. Specific capacitance averages (F/g) of 3 samples of drop-cast GO and CRG, 5 samples of drop-cast MWCNT-NH 2 before and after the hydrazine treatment were also estimated by Eq. (2) : (2) C capacitance = 0.5 \u00d7 ( \u222b i \u00b7 dV ) \u0394 V \u00d7 \u03c5 \u00d7 1 X where C is the capacitance, i is the current, V is the potential, and \u03c5 is the scan rate. X is the active sample volume for the volumetric capacitance or active sample mass for the specific capacitance of the working electrode. Error bars indicate their standard deviations. Note: Considering the potential of zero charge (PZC) of MWCNT/CRG is comparable to carbon aerogel reported recently [40] , the PZC of MWCNT/CRG is \u223c0.377 V versus RHE (or \u223c0.135 V versus SCE) in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 . If we calculate the capacitances of MWCNT/CRG from PZC to the high-voltage limit (0.135\u20130.8 V versus SCE), the capacitances are reduced by \u223c35% in comparison to capacitances obtained from the entire voltage range. The CV curves showed comparable currents between charging and discharging, and capacitances obtained from discharge only (\u223c5% higher) are very comparable to those averaged from both charge and discharge, as shown Fig. 8 . Therefore, averaging charging and discharging curve dose not greatly alter the capacitances of our electrodes relative to computing the capacitance from discharge only.

We demonstrate that these LbL-assembled MWNT (LbL-MWNT)/MnO2 thin films consist of a uniform coating of nanosized MnO2 on the MWNT network structure using SEM and TEM, which is a promising structure for electrochemical capacitor applications. LbL-MWNT/MnO2 electrodes yield a significantly higher volumetric capacitance of 246 F/cm3 with good capacity retention up to 1000 mV/s due to rapid transport of electrons and ions within the electrodes. The electrodes are generated with two simple aqueous deposition processes: the layer-by-layer assembly of MWNTs followed by redox deposition of MnO2 at ambient conditions, thus providing a straightforward approach to the fabrication of high-power and -energy electrochemical capacitors with precise control of electrode thickness at nanometer scales.",

Negatively and positively charged MWNTs were prepared by surface functionalization, allowing the incorporation of MWNTs into highly tunable thin films via the LBL technique. The pH dependent surface charge on the MWNTs gives this system the unique characteristics of LBL assembly of weak polyelectrolytes, controlling thickness and morphology with assembly pH conditions. We demonstrate that these MWNT thin films have randomly oriented interpenetrating network structure with well developed nanopores using AFM and SEM, which is an ideal structure of functional materials for various applications. In particular, electrochemical measurements of these all-MWNT thin film electrodes show high electronic conductivity in comparison with polymer composites with single wall nanotubes, and high capacitive behavior with precise control of capacity.",

        "abstract": "Nanograins and nanotwins are produced in specimens using one processing technique to allow direct comparison in their nanohardnesses. It is shown that the hardness of nanotwins can be close to the lower end of the hardness of nanograins. The resistance of nanotwins to dislocation movement is explained based on elastic interactions between the incident 60\u00b0 dislocation and the product dislocations. The latter includes one Shockley partial at the twin boundary and one 60\u00b0 dislocation in the twinned region. The analysis indicates that a resolved shear stress of at least 1.24 GPa is required for a 60\u00b0 dislocation to pass across a twin boundary in the nickel alloy investigated. It is this high level of the required shear stress coupled with a limited number of dislocations that can be present between two adjacent twin boundaries that provides nanotwins with high resistance to dislocation movement. The model proposed is corroborated by the detailed analysis of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.",

Simulated Munsell color chips under simulated CIE standard illuminant D65 were adopted as the test stimulates, when presented on a BP neural network calibrated CRT monitor, its color difference was far less than the minimum perceptible color difference (MPCD). With the test paradigm of brightness matching, a 4 (test surface) by 4 (matching background) by 16 times repeated measures within subjects design test was conducted on 9 adult male users, 4 users data for model parameter estimation, another 5 users data for model assessment. Repeated measures ANOVA results showed that the 4 users matched brightness was significantly influenced by the brightnesses of test surface and matching background. The 4 users test data were fitted by a series of power function, with the background brightness as independent variable, the Weber contrast which was made of the matching surface brightness and background brightness as dependent variable. The results showed that all the R squares of fitted models were larger than 0.99. Then the fitted model was evaluated by another 5 users model assessment data, and all evaluated R squares were larger than 0.95. With a fantastic precision, the fitted model described how the user percepted brightness varied with the brightness variations of the test surface and the test background.",

The determination coefficient of neural network predicted tristimulate values and measured tristimulate values were both greater than 0.9999. The mean CIE color difference between the predicted and the measured tristimulate values was 0.4097 with standard deviation of 0.3323, which was far less than the minimum perceptible color difference (MPCD). Compared with the mean color difference (mean value was 4.6955, standard deviation was 3.5330) of CIE gamma correction model, the color difference of the BP neural network model was significantly smaller.",

        "abstract": "This paper combines an analysis of data on security vulnerabilities (published in Bugtraq database) and a focused source-code examination to develop a finite state machine (FSM) model to depict and reason about security vulnerabilities. An in-depth analysis of the vulnerability reports and the corresponding source code of the applications leads to three observations: (i) exploits must pass through multiple elementary activities, (ii) multiple vulnerable operations on several objects are involved in exploiting a vulnerability, and (iii) the vulnerability data and corresponding code inspections allow us to derive a predicate for each elementary activity. Each predicate is represented as a primitive FSM (pFSM). Multiple pFSMs are then combined to create an FSM model of vulnerable operations and possible exploits. The proposed FSM methodology is exemplified by analyzing several types of vulnerabilities reported in the data: stack buffer overflow, integer overflow, heap overflow, input validation vulnerabilities, and format string vulnerabilities. For the studied vulnerabilities, we identify three types of pFSMs, which can be used to analyze operations involved in exploiting vulnerabilities and to identify the security checks to be performed at the elementary activity level. A demonstration of the practical usefulness of the FSM modeling approach was the discovery of a new heap overflow vulnerability now published in Bugtraq.",

A finite-state machine (FSM) approach is employed to decompose programs into multiple elementary activities, making it possible to extract simple predicates to be ensured for security. The FSM analysis pinpoints common characteristics among a broad range of security vulnerabilities: predictable memory layout, unprotected control data, and pointer taintedness. We propose memory layout randomization and control data randomization to mask the vulnerabilities at runtime. We also propose a static analysis approach to detect potential security vulnerabilities using the notion of pointer taintedness.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study which shows that, for the Intel x86 architecture, single-bit control flow errors in the authentication sections of targeted applications can result in significant security vulnerabilities. The experiment targets two well-known Internet server applications: FTP and SSH (secure shell), injecting single-bit control flow errors into user authentication sections of the applications. The injected sections constitute approximately 2-8% of the text segment of the target applications. The results show that out of all activated errors (a) 1-2% compromised system security (create a permanent window of vulnerability), (b) 43-62% resulted in crash failures (about 8.5% of these errors create a transient window of vulnerability), and (c) 7-12% resulted in fail silence violations. A key reason for the measured security vulnerabilities is that, in the x86 architecture, conditional branch instructions are a minimum of one Hamming distance apart. The design and evaluation of a new encoding scheme that reduces or eliminates this problem is presented.",

There are two major aspects to this work: to conduct extensive error injection experiments on the Linux kernel and to quantify the possibility of error-caused security violations using a Stochastic Activity Network (SAN) model. The error injection experiments show that about 2% of errors injected into the firewall code segment cause security vulnerabilities. Two types of error-caused security vulnerabilities are distinguished: temporary, which disappear when the error disappears, and permanent, which persist even after the error is removed, as long as the system is not rebooted. Results from simulating the SAN model indicate that under an error rate of 0.1 error per day during a 1-year period in a networked system protected by 20 firewalls, two machines (on the average) will experience security violations. This indicates that error-caused security vulnerabilities can be a non-negligible source of a security threat to a highly secure system.",

        "abstract": "Most malicious attacks compromise system security through memory corruption exploits. Recently proposed techniques attempt to defeat these attacks by protecting program control data. We have constructed a new class of attacks that can compromise network applications without tampering with any control data. These non-control data attacks represent a new challenge to system security. In this paper, we propose an architectural technique to defeat both control data and non-control data attacks based on the notion of pointer taintedness . A pointer is said to be tainted if user input can be used as the pointer value. A security attack is detected whenever a tainted value is dereferenced during program execution. The proposed architecture is implemented on the SimpleScalar processor simulator and is evaluated using synthetic programs as well as real-world network applications. Our technique can effectively detect both control data and non- control data attacks, and it offers better security coverage than current methods. The proposed architecture is transparent to existing programs.",

        "abstract": "This paper is motivated by a low level analysis of various categories of severe security vulnerabilities, which indicates that a common characteristic of many classes of vulnerabilities is pointer taintedness. A pointer is said to be tainted if a user input can directly or indirectly be used as a pointer value. In order to reason about pointer taintedness, a memory model is needed. The main contribution of this paper is the formal definition of a memory model using equational logic, which is used to reason about pointer taintedness. The reasoning is applied to several library functions to extract security preconditions, which must be satisfied to eliminate the possibility of pointer taintedness. The results show that pointer taintedness analysis can expose different classes of security vulnerabilities, such as format string, heap corruption and buffer overflow vulnerabilities, leading us to believe that pointer taintedness provides a unifying perspective for reasoning about security vulnerabilities.",

        "abstract": "Most memory corruption attacks and Internet worms follow a familiar pattern known as the control-data attack. Hence, many defensive techniques are designed to protect program control flow integrity. Although earlier work did suggest the existence of attacks that do not alter control flow, such attacks are generally believed to be rare against real-world software. The key contribution of this paper is to show that non-control-data attacks are realistic. We demonstrate that many real-world applications, including FTP, SSH, Telnet, and HTTP servers, are vulnerable to such attacks. In each case, the generated attack results in a security compromise equivalent to that due to the control-data attack exploiting the same security bug. Non-control-data attacks corrupt a variety of application data including user identity data, configuration data, user input data, and decision-making data. The success of these attacks and the variety of applications and target data suggest that potential attack patterns are diverse. Attackers are currently focused on control-data attacks, but it is clear that when control flow protection techniques shut them down, they have incentives to study and employ non-control-data attacks. This paper emphasizes the importance of future research efforts to address this realistic threat.",

The proposed system includes a rotor speed estimator using a q-axis flux and stator resistance identifier using the d-axis flux. The advantages of the proposed system are simplicity and avoidance of problems caused by using only a voltage model. Since the mathematical model of this system is constructed in a synchronously rotating reference frame, a linear model is easily derived for analyzing the system stability, including the influence of the observer gain, motor operating state, and parameter variations. In order to obtain stable low-speed operation and speed control accuracy, an algorithm for compensating for the deadtime of the inverter and correcting the nonideal features of an insulated gate bipolar transistor was developed. The effectiveness of the proposed system has been verified by digital simulation and experimentation.",

Traditionally, high thermoelectric figure-of-merit, ZT, has been the only parameter pursued for high conversion efficiency. Here, we emphasize that a high power factor (PF) is equivalently important for high power generation, in addition to high efficiency. A new n-type Mg2Sn-based material, Mg2Sn0.75Ge0.25, is a good example to meet the dual requirements in efficiency and output power. It was found that Mg2Sn0.75Ge0.25 has an average ZT of 0.9 and PF of 52 \u03bcW\u22c5cm(-1)\u22c5K(-2) over the temperature range of 25-450 \u00b0C, a peak ZT of 1.4 at 450 \u00b0C, and peak PF of 55 \u03bcW\u22c5cm(-1)\u22c5K(-2) at 350 \u00b0C. By using the energy balance of one-dimensional heat flow equation, leg efficiency and output power were calculated with Th = 400 \u00b0C and Tc = 50 \u00b0C to be of 10.5% and 6.6 W\u22c5cm(-2) under a temperature gradient of 150 \u00b0C\u22c5mm(-1), respectively.",

        "abstract": "Lead telluride and its alloys have been extensively studied for medium temperature thermoelectric applications due to decent figure-of-merit (ZT) at temperature close to 900 K. However, little emphasis has been given to improve the ZT near room temperature. In this investigation, we report a systematic study of Cr doping in PbTe1-y Se-y with y=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.85, and 1. We found the peak ZT temperature increased with increasing concentration of Se. The highest ZT of similar to 0.6 at room temperature in Te-rich Cr0.015Pb3.985-Te0.75Se0.25 was obtained due to a lowered thermal conductivity and enhanced power factor resulted from high Seebeck coefficient of about -220 mu V K-1 and high Hall mobility similar to 1120 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at room temperature. A room temperature ZT of 0.5 and peak ZT of 1 at about 573-673 K is shown by Se-rich sample Cr3.01Pb3.99Te0.25Se0.75. This improvement of the room temperature ZT improved the average ZT over a wide temperature range and could potentially lead to a single leg efficiency of thermoelectric conversion for Te-rich Cr0.015Pb0.985Te0.75Se0.25 up to 11% and Se-rich Cr0.01Pb0.99Te0.255Se0.75 up to 13% with cold side and hot side temperature at 300 K and 873 K, respectively, if matched with appropriate p-type legs.

It was found that Se increases the doping concentration of K in PbTe as a result of the balance of electronegativity and also lowers the lattice thermal conductivity because of the increased number of point defects. Tuning the composition and carrier concentration to increase the density of states around the Fermi level results in higher Seebeck coefficients for the two valence bands of PbTe1-ySey. Peak thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) values of similar to 1.6 and similar to 1.7 were obtained for Te-rich K0.02Pb0.98Te0.75Se0.25 us at 773 K and Se-rich K0.02Pb0.98Te0.15Se0.85 at 873 K, respectively. However, the average ZT was higher in Te-rich compositions than in Se-rich compositions, with the best found in K0.02Pb0.98Te0.75Se0.25. Such a result is due to the improved electron transport afforded by heavy K doping with the assistance of Se.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Half-Heusler compounds with valence electron count (VEC) of 19 were not believed to have good thermoelectric properties because it was theoretically predicted as metallic. However, this work demonstrates experimentally that half-Heusler compound VCoSb we synthesized is in fact a good thermoelectric material. As-made samples show single half-Heusler phase and negative Seebeck coefficient with a peak value around\u00a0\u2212130\u00a0\u03bcV/K at 600\u00a0\u00b0C, which indicates the semiconductor-, not metallic-, like behavior. The VCoSb samples were made by arc-melting the elements to first form ingots, then ball-milling the ingots, and finally hot-pressing the fine powder to form the bulk materials. Different hot-pressing temperatures at 750\u00a0\u00b0C, 800\u00a0\u00b0C, and 900\u00a0\u00b0C were carried out and the results are discussed. A maximum thermoelectric figure-of-merit (ZT) around 0.5 is achieved at 700\u00a0\u00b0C for all the samples.",

The \u03b2-phase of such material possesses a natural superlattice-like structure that combines ordered selenium (Se) and disordered copper (Cu) layers in its unit cell, resulting in a low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.4\u20130.5 W m\u22121 K\u22121. A \u03bb-shaped specific heat peak indicates a phase transition from cubic \u03b2-phase to tetragonal \u03b1-phase at around 140 \u00b0C upon cooling and vice versa. An abnormal decrease in specific heat with increasing temperature was also observed due to the increased random motion of disordered Cu atoms. These features indicate that \u03b2-phase Cu2Se could be potentially an interesting thermoelectric material, competing with other conventional thermoelectric materials.",

        "abstract": "Constantan alloy (Cu\u2013Ni) has been known for a long time in thermocouples due to its thermal power property. In this study, we show an enhancement in thermoelectric performance of Cu56Ni42Mn2 alloy by introducing nanoscale twins into its microstructure. Comparing to arc-melted ingot (without nanoscale twins), the ball milled and hot pressed (BM\u2013HP) samples with twinning showed a higher Seebeck coefficient of ~\u221272.5 \u03bcV K\u22121 (an increase of ~12% at 873 K), a larger power factor of ~102 \u03bcW cm\u22121 K\u22122 (an increase of ~21% at 873 K), and hence a higher ZT of ~0.19 (an increase of ~34% at 873 K). A high output power density of ~53.4 W cm\u22122 is calculated from the high power factor even though the conversion efficiency is lower than 3% due to the low ZT. TEM characterization shows there is a large quantity of nanoscale twins with spacing of 50\u2013200 nm. It is very likely that low-energy carriers are selectively scattered by the twin boundaries (i.e., potential barrier scattering) thus lead to enhanced Seebeck coefficient. The improved thermoelectric performance of nano-twinned Cu\u2013Ni alloy suggests constantan could be promising in thermoelectric power generation where the power output density is more important than the conversion efficiency.",

The samples are made by arc melting followed by ball milling and hot pressing via the nanostructuring approach. A peak thermoelectric figure-of-merit (ZT) of \u223c1.0 is achieved at 500 \u00b0C in samples with a composition of Hf0.5Zr0.25Ti0.25NiSn0.99Sb0.01 due to a slight increase in carrier concentration and also a lower thermal conductivity caused by Ti. The ZT values below 500 \u00b0C of hot pressed Hf0.5Zr0.25Ti0.25NiSn0.99Sb0.01 samples are significantly higher than those of the same way prepared Hf0.75Zr0.25NiSn0.99Sb0.01 samples at each temperature, which are very much desired for mid-range temperature applications such as waste heat recovery in automobiles.",

        "abstract": "As the lightest and most electropositive material, lithium metal is regarded as the ultimate anode material for next-generation high-energy batteries. However, uncontrolled dendritic lithium growth as well as low Coulombic efficiency hinders its widespread application in secondary batteries. Interfacial modification of anodes with protective layers has been proved to be an effective way to inhibit the growth of ramified lithium. Here we report on a freestanding, highly flexible nanostructured carbon film, which is ready to be transferred onto electrodes with great ease. We show that such mechanically robust carbon films can effectively suppress the growth of Li dendrites upon cycling at practical current densities (0.25\u20131.0 mA cm\u22122) with significantly improved Coulombic efficiency up to ~99.5% for over hundreds of cycles and thousands of operation hours. Notably, this semi-tubular carbon film demonstrated instant, reliable protection to electrodes in not only reactive electrolytes but also ambient environment with high humidity, offering a practically feasible route toward the dendrite-free lithium metal batteries.",

        "abstract": "Manipulating the transport properties of titania nanotubes (NTs) is paramount in guaranteeing the material's successful implementation in various solid state applications. Here we present the unique semiconducting properties of individual titania NTs as revealed from thermoelectric and structural studies performed on the same individual NTs. The NTs were in the anatase phase fabricated by anodic oxidation and doped with intrinsic defects created by reducing the lattice thermally. Despite their polycrystalline nature and nanoscale walls, the doped NTs were found to be 4-5 orders of magnitude more electrically conducting than TiO nanowires and thin films, with values approaching the bulk single crystal conductivity. The reason for the high conductivity was found to be the high carrier concentration on the order of 10 cm, which counteracted the low mobility values \u223c0.006 cm V s. Furthermore, this high level of carrier concentration transitioned the NTs to a degenerate state, which is the first such example in thermally doped titania NTs. More importantly, our study showed the creation of acceptor states along with donor states in individual nanotubes upon lattice reduction. These acceptor levels were found to be active at low temperatures when donor states were not ionized, shifting the Fermi level (E) from the conduction band to the valence band.",

The loofah scaffold was first loaded with G and TiO by immersing, squeezing, and loosening into the mixed solution of graphene oxide and titania, and then carbonized at 900 \u00b0C to form the BC-G-TiO composite. The synergistic effects of the naturally hierarchical biocarbon structure, graphene, and TiO nanoparticles on the electrochemical properties are analyzed. The biocarbon provides a high interconnection and an easy accessibility surface for the electrolyte. Graphene bridged the BC and TiO nanoparticles, improved the conductivity of the BC-G-TiO composite, and increased the electron transfer efficiency.

The results show that SWCNTs with weakly bonded oxygen molecules on the surface were determined to be initially p-type with metallic behavior and after annealing in vacuum they transition to n-type with semiconducting behavior where the charge transport is dominated by a 2D Mott variable range hopping mechanism due to molecular desorption. The structural characterization reveals that there is no change in the structure of the SWCNT network, indicating that the source of the drastic change in electrical properties is due to the molecule interaction with the surface of the SWCNT. Even though there is a significant change in the electrical properties, the thermal conductivity remains unchanged. On the other hand, the oxidized SWCNT sample with stronger C\u2013O bonds exhibits purely p-type metallic behavior that is insensitive to annealing conditions and shows lower thermal conductivity values because of the enhanced phonon scattering due to the absorbed oxygen molecules and residual poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA).",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The effects of co-doping Na and Zn into thermoelectric Mg 3 Sb 2  were investigated. Na was found to be a very effective hole dopant in our previous study. However, the lattice thermal conductivity noticeably increases limiting further improvement of the figure of merit. Here, we show that isoelectronic Zn doping weakens the polar covalent bonding and ionized impurity scattering and leads to a 3 fold increase of carrier mobility. Lattice thermal conductivity, due to the introduced ionic mass contrast between Zn 2+  and Mg 2+ , is supressed significantly especially at lower temperature range between 300\u00a0K and 450\u00a0K. The indicator of the average performance, the ( PF ) eng  (engineering power factor) and ( ZT ) eng  (engineering  ZT ), were showed \u223c50% and \u223c76% improvement, respectively. The same strategy of co-doping two different elements with different functions could also be applied to other thermoelectric Zintl compounds typically with low carrier concentration and carrier mobility for even higher thermoelectric properties.",

Consequently, anode materials with high power, long lifespan, and safe operation are highly desired. In this work, we successfully fabricate black K2Ti6O13 nanowires as an anode material that exhibits the desired properties. The black K2Ti6O13 nanowires are prepared via a hydrothermal method followed by post calcination and final hydrogen plasma treatment. The black K2Ti6O13 anode delivers a high reversible capacity of 249 mA h g\u22121. Impressively, it could sustain 20\u2006000 cycles without apparent capacity fade. The first-principles calculation results suggest that the electrical conductivity of K2Ti6O13 would be improved while the sodiation energy barrier could be reduced after introducing oxygen vacancies.",

In manganites, charge ordering (CO) has been traditionally identified as an ordered arrangement of Mn 3+  and Mn 4+  ions. Here, by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in combination with image deconvolution technique and the high-dimensional space description, the nature of CO related to the structural modulation is revealed as an incommensurate charge-density wave (CDW) in real-space for overdoped manganites La 0.8 Ca 2.2 Mn 2 O 7 . This result resolves the current controversy and confirms the incommensurate CO is not simply a mixture of commensurate ones with different periodicities. In this sense, we provide the first HRTEM imaging evidence for a CDW picture.",

Due to their negative surface charge across a wide range of environmental conditions, metal cations have strong affinities for MnO x , and the presence of metal cations during or after the formation of MnO x  might significantly affect their structure and reactivity. This study systematically investigates the effects of Zn 2+  presence during mineral formation (i.e. coprecipitation) on the structure of acid birnessite and \u03b4-MnO 2 , two synthetic analogs that are structurally similar to fresh biogenic MnO x  but with different crystallinity. For both acid birnessite and \u03b4-MnO 2 , Zn 2+  existed as surface adsorbed species at vacancy sites, interrupted layer stacking along  c  axis, and caused reductions of the lateral particle size. Zn 2+  also reduced Mn(III) contents in \u03b4-MnO 2  layers, leaving more vacancy sites (capped by adsorbed Zn 2+ ). The reduction of layer stacking was more obvious for acid birnessite, while the modification of layer structure was more significant for \u03b4-MnO 2 . These structural changes will likely lead to modified reactivity of MnO x  in natural systems.",

However, large volume change during sodiation and desodiation leads to poor cyclic performance. Introduction of inactive element would improve the cyclic performance but reduce the capacity significantly.

The Sb 2 Te 3  nanocrystals with a size of about 20\u00a0nm embedded in the carbon matrix are produced. The as-obtained Sb 2 Te 3 /C exhibits specific capacity of 360\u00a0mA\u00a0h\u00a0g \u20131  with capacity retention of 93% after 400 cycles at 1\u00a0A\u00a0g \u20131 .  In situ  transmission electron microscopy study was carried out to investigate the origin of the high capacity retention. The synergetic effects of carbon matrix and nanosized particles can release stress efficiently during large volume change and suppress the aggregation of the pulverized nanoparticles.",

        "abstract": "It is understood that defects of the atomic arrangement of the lattice in 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) can have a profound effect on the electronic and optical properties. Beyond these it is a major prerequisite to also understand the fundamental effect of such defects on phonon transport, to guarantee the successful integration of MoS2 into the solid-state devices. A comprehensive joint experiment-theory investigation to explore the effect of lattice defects on the thermal transport of the suspended MoS2 monolayer grown by CVD is presented. The measured room temperature thermal conductivity values are 30 \u00b1 3.3 and 35.5 \u00b1 3 W m\u22121 K\u22121 for two samples, which are more than two times smaller than that of their exfoliated counterpart. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy shows that these CVD-grown samples are polycrystalline in nature with low angle grain boundaries, which is primarily responsible for their reduced thermal conductivity. Higher degree of polycrystallinity and aging effects also result in smoother temperature dependency of thermal conductivity (\u03ba) at temperatures below 100 K. First-principles lattice dynamics simulations are carried out to understand the role of defects such as isotopes, vacancies, and grain boundaries on the phonon scattering rates of our CVD-grown samples.",

        "abstract": "It is well understood that defect engineering can give rise to exotic electronic properties in transition metal dichalcogenides, but to this date, there is no detailed study to illustrate how defects can be engineered to tailor their thermal properties. Here, through combined experimental and theoretical approaches based on the first-principles density functional theory and Boltzmann transport equations we have explored the effect of lattice vacancies and substitutional tungsten (W) doping on the thermal transport of the suspended molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) monolayers grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The results show that even though the isoelectronic substitution of the W atoms for Mo atoms in CVD-grown Mo0.82W018Se2 monolayers reduces the Se vacancy concentration by 50% compared to those found in the MoSe2 monolayers, the thermal conductivity remains intact in a wide temperature range. On the other hand, Se vacancies have a detrimental effect for both samples and more so in the Mo0.82W018Se2 monolayers, which results in thermal conductivity reduction up to 72% for a vacancy concentration of 4%. This is because the mass of the W atom is larger than that of the Mo atom, and missing a Se atom at a vacancy site results in a larger mass difference and therefore kinetic energy and potential energy difference. Furthermore, the monotonically increasing thermal conductivity with temperature for both systems at low temperatures indicates the importance of boundary scattering over defects and phonon-phonon scattering at these temperatures.",

Tungsten disulfide (WS2) has been long-pursued as a promising candidate, but the progress is slow, which is probably due to its poor electrical contact with the support and low density of active sites. Here we developed a highly active and stable WS2 catalyst for the HER by growing it into a 3D porous architecture on conducting graphene/Ni foam. The catalysts exhibit a \u223c0.1 V overpotential, accompanied by a large cathode current density (10 mA cm\u22122 at \u2212119 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode), a low Tafel slope of \u223c43 mV per decade and good stability. The HER performance of WS2 catalysts is greatly improved, and is comparable to that of the well-known catalysts (MoS2, CoSe2, CoS2, etc.), which benefits from the improved electrical conductivity of the WS2 catalysts by graphene and porous structures of the support. This work paves a new way to develop active and efficient WS2-based catalysts for hydrogen generation.",

        "abstract": "Splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis using electricity from intermittent waste heat, wind, or solar energies is one of the easiest and cleanest methods for high-purity hydrogen production and an effective way to store the excess electrical power. The key dilemma for efficient large-scale production of hydrogen by splitting of water via the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER, respectively) is the high overpotential required, especially for the OER. We report an exceptionally active and durable OER catalyst yielding current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm\u22122 at overpotentials of only 259 mV and 289 mV in alkaline electrolyte, respectively, fulfilling the commercial criteria of the OER process. Together with a good HER catalyst, we have achieved the commercially required current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm\u22122 at 1.586 and 1.657 V, respectively, with very good stability, dramatically lower than any previously reported voltage. This discovery sets the stage for large-scale hydrogen production by water splitting using excess electrical power whenever and wherever available.",

Here, we present a theoretical and experimental study to demonstrate that ternary Ni 2(1-x) Mo 2x P porous nanowire arrays grown on Ni foam, as a highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst toward alkaline HER under large-current-density. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mo substitution of Ni in Ni 2 P leads to optimal free energy of water activation and hydrogen adsorption on the catalyst surface. Benefiting from the enhanced intrinsic activity, large active surface area and fast gas releasing, the Ni 2(1-x) Mo 2x P catalyst exhibits an excellent HER activity with low overpotentials of 72, 240, and 294\u202fmV at current densities of 10, 500, and 1000\u202fmA\u202fcm \u22122 , respectively, along with superior stability in 1\u202fM KOH. This highly active and stable catalyst enables an electrolyzer operating at 10\u202fmA\u202fcm \u22122  at a voltage of 1.51\u202fV, 100\u202fmA\u202fcm \u22122  at 1.65\u202fV, and 500\u202fmA\u202fcm \u22122  at 1.82\u202fV in 1\u202fM KOH at room temperature, which are much better than the benchmark of IrO 2 /Pt.

Tungsten dichalcogenides (WS2, WSe2, etc.) are promising candidates for such purpose, but their HER performances are inherently limited by the sparse catalytic edge sites and poor electrical conductivity. Here we demonstrate a highly active and stable HER catalyst by integrating ternary tungsten sulfoselenide WS2(1\u2013x)Se2x particles with a 3D porous metallic NiSe2 foam, in which good electrical conductivity, good contact, large surface area, and high-density active edge sites are simultaneously obtained, thus contributing to outstanding catalytic performance: large cathode current density (\u221210 mA/cm2 at \u221288 mV), low Tafel slope (46.7 mV/dec), large exchange current density (214.7 \u03bcA/cm2), and good stability, which is better than most reports on WS2 and NiSe2 catalysts.

        "abstract": "Efficient and low-cost bifunctional catalysts toward both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for overall water splitting are of great significance to energy and environmental sustainability. Here, we report on a novel hierarchical Cu@CoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) core-shell nanostructure catalyst for efficient overall water splitting in the alkaline medium. Benefiting from the smart structure, the optimized composite affords small overpotentials of 171 mV for the HER and 240 mV for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122, along with Tafel slopes of 36.4 and 44.4 mV dec\u22121 for the HER and OER, respectively. Strikingly, the overall water splitting performance is very good since it just requires a voltage of 1.681 V to gain a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122, which is only 60 mV larger than the benchmark of IrO2 (+)/Pt (\u2212) electrodes. Moreover, the optimized composite electrodes exhibit outstanding durability within 48 h testing, which is much better than that of the benchmark. Our rational design of the hierarchical core-shell nanoarchitectures presents a simple approach to fabricate advanced catalysts for water splitting.",

This study investigated the stability of Cr(III)-Fe(III)-(oxy)hydroxides, common Cr(VI) remediation products, with a range of compositions in the presence of common microbial exudates, siderophores and small organic acids. In the presence of a representative siderophore, desferrioxamine B (DFOB), iron (Fe) was released at higher rates and to greater extents relative to Cr from all solid phases. The presence of oxalate alone caused the release of Cr, but not of Fe, from all solid phases. In the presence of both DFOB and oxalate, oxalate acted synergistically with DFOB to increase the Fe, but not the Cr, release rate. Upon reaction with DFOB or DFOB + oxalate, the remaining solids became enriched in Cr relative to Fe. Such incongruent dissolution led to solid phases with different compositions and increased solubility relative to the initial solid phases. Thus, the presence of microbia...",

For commercially feasible water electrolysis, it is imperative to develop electrocatalysts that perform as efficiently as Pt but using only earth-abundant commercial materials. However, the highest performance current catalysts consist of nanostructures made by using complex methods. Here we report a porous nickel diselenide (NiSe2) catalyst that is superior for water electrolysis, exhibiting much better catalytic performance than most first-row transition metal dichalcogenide-based catalysts, well-studied MoS2, and WS2-based catalysts. Indeed NiSe2 performs comparably to the state-of-the-art Pt catalysts. We fabricate NiSe2 directly from commercial nickel foam by acetic acid-assisted surface roughness engineering. To understand the origin of the high performance, we use first-principles calculations to identify the active sites. This work demonstrates the commercial possibility of hydrogen production via water electrolysis using porous bulk NiSe2 catalysts.",

First-row transition-metal (Ni, Co, and Fe)-based compounds are promising candidates as OER catalysts to substitute the benchmark of noble-metal-based catalysts, such as IrO2 and RuO2. Although Fe is the cheapest and one of the most abundant transition-metal elements, there are seldom papers reported on Fe-only compounds with outstanding catalytic OER activities. Here we propose an interesting strategy by growing iron nitride (Fe3N/Fe4N) based nanoporous film on three-dimensional (3D) highly conductive graphene/Ni foam, which is demonstrated to be a robust and durable self-supported 3D electrode for the OER featuring a very low overpotential of 238 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm2, a small Tafel slope of 44.5 mV/dec, good stability, and ...",

Here we investigate the TE properties of Ni-substituted n-type MCoSb. The anomalous changes of carrier concentration and lattice thermal conductivity with higher amount of Ni indicate the presence of atomic disorder. Peak power factor of \u223c33\u00a0\u03bcW\u00a0cm \u22121 \u00a0K \u22122  and peak  ZT  of 0.6 are obtained in ZrCo 0.9 Ni 0.1 Sb. Further substitute Zr by Hf suppresses the lattice thermal conductivity and yields a peak  ZT  exceeding 1 in the composition Zr 0.5 Hf 0.5 Co 0.9 Ni 0.1 Sb at 1073 K. Thus the MCoSb compounds possess promising TE properties by both n- and p-type doping, which is unique among the half-Heusler based TE materials.",

Electrochemical water splitting is an environmentally friendly way to produce hydrogen, but high overpotentials and cost are the main limitations to the application of electrocatalysts in large-scale hydrogen production. Here, an inexpensive catalyst composed of Ni 5 P 4 /NiP 2  nanoparticles on Ni 5 P 4 /NiP 2  nanosheets was prepared by a simple chemical vapor deposition method to increase the active catalytic sites. This nickel phosphide exhibits an overpotential of 35\u202fmV\u202fat a current density of 10\u202fmA\u202fcm \u22122  in an acidic condition, outperforming other reported nickel phosphides. Additionally, it shows great stability at a high current density of 1200\u202fmA\u202fcm \u22122 , which is very important for large-scale applications. Furthermore, this sample shows pH universality, with good performance in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. This work advances nickel phosphide as an efficient catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction in water splitting.",

In this work we investigate the thermoelectric properties of Te between 323 K and 623 K. By varying the alloying concentration of Se, a minimum lattice thermal conductivity was achieved with ~10% alloying of Te by Se. Additionally, Sb has been used as a dopant to increase the carrier concentration of the system. With reduced lattice thermal conductivity by Se alloying and increased carrier concentration by Sb doping, the room-temperature figure of merit (ZT) increased by 60%, leading to an average ZT of ~0.8 in Te0.88Se0.10Sb0.02, which corresponds to an engineering figure of merit \u3016(ZT)\u3017_eng ~0.5 between 323 K and 623 K and an efficiency of ~8% in the same temperature range.

        "abstract": "Facile design of low-cost and high-efficiency catalysts with earth-abundant and cheap materials is desirable to replace platinum (Pt) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water splitting, but the development of such HER catalysts with Pt-like activity using simple strategies remains challenging. A mesoporous hybrid catalyst of nickel phosphides nanoparticles and cobalt phosphosulfide/phosphide (CoS|Ni|P) nanosheet arrays for HER is reported here, which is developed by a facile three-step approach consisting of electrodeposition, thermal sulfurization, and phosphorization. This hybrid catalyst is highly robust and stable in acid for HER, and is distinguished by very low overpotentials of 41, 88, and 150 mV to achieve 10, 100, and 1000 mA cm , respectively, as well as a small Tafel slope (45.2 mV dec ), and a large exchange current density (964 \u00b5A cm ). It is among the most efficient earth-abundant catalysts reported thus far for HER. More importantly, this electrocatalyst has electrochemical durability over 20 h under a wide range of current densities (up to 1 A cm ) in acidic conditions, as well as very high turnover frequencies of 0.40 and 1.26 H s at overpotentials of 75 and 100 mV, respectively, showing that it has great potential for practical applications in large-scale water electrolysis.",

Here we introduce a simple and cost-effective strategy for one-step synthesis of 3D porous NiSe2/Ni hybrid catalysts from commercially available Ni foams via thermal selenization. This catalyst exhibits superior catalytic performance featured by a small overpotential (~143 mV) to afford 10 mA/cm2, small Tafel slope (49.0 mV/dec), large exchange current density (15.7 \u03bcA/cm2) and good stability in acid, which benefits from the good electrical conductivity of NiSe2 catalysts on Ni foam and the increase of additional porous structures at NiSe2 surface. This performance is superior to most of well-studied MoS2 or WS2-based catalysts, and the exchange current density is much larger than CoSe2 or MoS2-based catalysts. This achievement provides a straightforward and effective route to produce cheap and efficient catalysts from commercially available materials for large-scale water splitting.",

Electrocatalytic measurements on the methanol oxidation reaction show that the peak current density (normalized to the electrochemical surface area) of our Au mesh in alkaline electrolyte (0.5 M KOH) can reach 0.264 mA cm\u22122, which is significantly higher than those of the well-studied nanoporous Au film (0.081 mA cm\u22122) and nanoporous Au nanoparticles (0.112 mA cm\u22122). Over 90% of the current density can be maintained after 500 cycling tests. Through transmission electron microscopy studies, the superior intrinsic activity and stability lie in the high linear density of surface defects, the exposure of active facets, and superficial tensile strain on the outter-most layers.",

Using them as bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting, a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 was achieved at a voltage of 1.54 V, and 100 mA cm\u22122 at 1.69 V with excellent durability, which is much better than the benchmark of IrO2(+)//Pt(\u2212) electrodes.

        "abstract": "Highly active catalysts composed of earth-abundant materials, performing as efficiently as Pt catalysts, are crucial for sustainable hydrogen production through water splitting. However, most efficient catalysts consist of nanostructures made via complex synthetic methods, making scale-up quite challenging. Here we report an effective strategy for developing a very active and durable pH-universal electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This catalyst is constructed using a sandwich-like structure, where hierarchical cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanoparticles serve as thin skins covering both sides of nickel phosphide (Ni5P4) nanosheet arrays, forming self-supported sandwich-like CoP/Ni5P4/CoP microsheet arrays with lots of mesopores and macropores. The as-prepared electrocatalyst requires an overpotential of only 33 mV to achieve a benchmark of 10 mA cm\u22122, with a very large exchange current density and high turnover frequencies (TOFs) in acid media, superior to most electrocatalysts made of metal phosphides, well-known MoS2 and WS2 catalysts, and it performs comparably to state-of-the-art Pt catalysts. In particular, this electrocatalyst shows impressive operational stability at an extremely large current density of 1 A cm\u22122, indicating its possible application toward large-scale water electrolysis. Additionally, this electrocatalyst is very active in alkaline electrolyte (71 mV at 10 mA cm\u22122), which demonstrates its pH universality as a HER catalyst with outstanding catalytic activity. This simple strategy does not involve any solvothermal and hydrothermal processes, paving a new avenue toward the design of robust non-noble electrocatalysts for hydrogen production, aimed at commercial water electrolysis.",

        "abstract": "Developing stable and efficient bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen is a critical step in the realization of several clean-energy technologies. Here we report a robust and highly active electrocatalyst that is constructed by deposition of the ternary metal phosphide FeMnP onto graphene-protected nickel foam by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition from a single source precursor. FeMnP exhibits high electrocatalytic activity toward both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Utilizing FeMnP/GNF as both the anode and the cathode for overall water splitting, a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 is achieved at a cell voltage of as low as 1.55 V with excellent stability. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that facets exposing both Fe and Mn sites are necessary to achieve high HER activity. The present work provides a facile strategy for fabricating highly efficient electrocatalysts from earth-abundant materials for overall water splitting.",

Here, we demonstrate an efficient core/shell photoanode with a highly active oxygen evolution electrocatalyst shell (FeMnP) and semiconductor core (rutile TiO2) for photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution reaction. Metal\u2013organic chemical vapor deposition from a single-source precursor was used to ensure good contact between the FeMnP and the TiO2. The TiO2/FeMnP core/shell photoanode reaches the theoretical photocurrent density for rutile TiO2 of 1.8 mA cm\u20132 at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode under simulated 100 mW cm\u20132 (1 sun) irradiation. The dramatic enhancement is a result of the synergistic effects of the high oxygen evolution reaction activity of FeMnP (delivering an overpotential of 300 mV with a Tafel slope of 65 mV dec\u20131 in 1 M KOH) and the conductive interlaye...",

Because of the high electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactivity (HER) of ultrafine Mo2C nanocrystals and edges of two-dimensional MoS2, an electrode with a synergistic integration of these two nanomaterials is expected to show a better HER performance. Here we report this hybrid nanostructure of vertically aligned MoS2/Mo2C nanosheets on conductive carbon paper. It was revealed that the original structure of MoS2 nanosheets remains intact after the carburization, but the surfaces are incorporated with either Mo2C nanodomains or a heteroatomic mixture of S and C. The hybrid catalyst exhibits a much lower HER overpotential in comparison to those of the corresponding Mo2C and MoS2 alone. Its high activity is congruent with DFT calculations, which show that multiple S and C coordinated Mo sites with near zero Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption exist. Thus, the low overpotential of this binder-f...",

Recently, zinc-blende boron arsenide (BAs) has been predicted to have a very high thermal conductivity of over 2000\u2009W m\u22121\u2009K\u22121 at room temperature by first-principles calculations, rendering it a close competitor for diamond which holds the highest thermal conductivity among bulk materials. Experimental demonstration, however, has proved extremely challenging, especially in the preparation of large high quality single crystals. Although BAs crystals have been previously grown by chemical vapor transport (CVT), the growth process relies on spontaneous nucleation and results in small crystals with multiple grains and various defects. Here, we report a controllable CVT synthesis of large single BAs crystals (400\u2013600\u2009\u03bcm) by using carefully selected tiny BAs single crystals as seeds. We have obtained BAs single crystals with a thermal conductivity of 351\u2009\u00b1\u200921\u2009W m\u22121\u2009K\u22121 at room ...",

        "abstract": "We report the development of an efficient and earth-abundant catalyst for electrochemical overall water splitting. Trimetallic NiFeMo alloy is synthesized by hydrothermal deposition from inorganic precursors and subsequent low-temperature thermal annealing. A complete cell made of NiFeMo electrodes on nickel foam exhibits a low voltage of 1.45 V at 10 mA/cm2 as a result of low overpotentials for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals that nanometer-sized single-crystal domains of Ni, Fe, and Mo are intimately integrated at the atomic level, which enables a synergistic effect of metallic Ni, Fe, and Mo for efficient HER, while self-formed Ni\u2013Fe\u2013Mo (oxy)hydroxides on the surface of the NiFeMo anode become active sites for OER. Such a multimetallic alloy and its (oxy)hydroxides represent a typical HER/OER catalyst couple, and our method provides a new route to develop efficient low-cost metallic alloys for overall w...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Superconductivity intrinsic to the intercalated black phosphorus (BP) with a transition temperature T c  of 3.8\u202fK, independent of the intercalant, whether an alkali or an alkaline earth element, has been reported recently by R. Zhang et\u00a0al. (2017). However, the reported T c  and the field effect on the superconducting (SC) transition both bear great similarities to those for the pure Sn, which is commonly used for BP synthesis under the vapor transport method. We have therefore decided to determine whether a minute amount of Sn is present in the starting high purity BP crystals and whether it is the culprit for the small SC signal detected. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy results confirmed the existence of Sn in the starting high purity BP crystals purchased from the same company as in R. Zhang et\u00a0al. (2017). We have reproduced the SC transition at 3.8\u202fK in Li- and Na-intercalated BP crystals that contain minute amounts of Sn when prepared by the vapor transport method but not in BP crystals that are free of Sn when prepared by the high-pressure method. We have therefore concluded that the SC transition reported by R. Zhang et\u00a0al. (2017) is associated with the Sn but not intrinsic to the intercalated BP crystals.",

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional lead halide perovskites have surprised people for their defect-tolerant electronic and optical properties, two-dimensional lead halide layered structures exhibit even more puzzling phenomena: luminescent edge states in Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites and conflicting reports of highly luminescent versus non-emissive CsPb$_{text{2}}$Br$_{text{5}}$. In this work, we report the observation of bright luminescent surface states on the edges of CsPb$_{text{2}}$Br$_{text{5}}$ microplatelets. We prove that green surface emission makes wide-bandgap single crystal CsPb$_{text{2}}$Br$_{text{5}}$ highly luminescent. Using polarized Raman spectroscopy and atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy, we further prove that polycrystalline CsPb$_{text{2}}$Br$_{text{5}}$ is responsible for the bright luminescence. We propose that these bright edge states originate from corner-sharing clusters of PbBr$_{text{6}}$ in the distorted regions between CsPb$_{text{2}}$Br$_{text{5}}$ nanocrystals. Because metal halide octahedrons are building blocks of perovskites, our discoveries settle a long-standing controversy over the basic property of CsPb$_{text{2}}$Br$_{text{5}}$ and open new opportunities to understand, design and engineer perovskite solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.",

        "abstract": "Zero dimensional perovskite Cs4PbBr6 has attracted considerable attention recently not only because of its highly efficient green photoluminescence (PL), but also its two highly debated opposing mechanisms of the luminescence: embedded CsPbBr3 nanocrystals versus intrinsic Br vacancy states. After a brief discussion on the root cause of the controversy, we provide sensitive but non-invasive methods that can not only directly correlate luminescence with the underlying structure, but also distinguish point defects from embedded nanostructures. We first synthesized both emissive and non-emissive Cs4PbBr6 crystals, obtained the complete Raman spectrum of Cs4PbBr6 and assigned all Raman bands based on density functional theory simulations. We then used correlated Raman-PL as a passive structure-property method to identify the difference between emissive and non-emissive Cs4PbBr6 crystals and revealed the existence of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals in emissive Cs4PbBr6. We finally employed a diamond anvil cell to probe the response of luminescence centers to hydrostatic pressure. The observations of fast red-shifting, diminishing and eventual disappearance of both green emission and Raman below Cs4PbBr6 phase transition pressure of ~3 GPa is compatible with CsPbBr3 nanocrystal inclusions as green PL emitters and cannot be explained by Br vacancies. The resolution of this long-lasting controversy paves the way for further device applications of low dimensional perovskites, and our comprehensive optical technique integrating structure-property with dynamic pressure response is generic and can be applied to other emerging optical materials to understand the nature of their luminescent centers.",

        "abstract": "Since the first report of the green emission of 2D all-inorganic CsPb Br , its bandgap and photoluminescence (PL) origin have generated intense debate and remained controversial. After the discovery that PL centers occupy only specific morphological structures in CsPb Br , a two-step highly sensitive and noninvasive optical technique is employed to resolve the controversy. Same-spot Raman-PL as a static property-structure probe reveals that CsPbBr nanocrystals are contributing to the green emission of CsPb Br ; pressure-dependent Raman-PL with a diamond anvil cell as a dynamic probe further rules out point defects such as Br vacancies as an alternative mechanism. Optical absorption under hydrostatic pressure shows that the bandgap of CsPb Br is 0.3-0.4 eV higher than previously reported values and remains nearly constant with pressure up to 2 GPa in good agreement with full-fledged density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Using ion exchange of Br with Cl and I, it is further proved that CsPbBr  X (X = Cl or I) is responsible for the strong visible PL in CsPb Br  X . This experimental approach is applicable to all PL-active materials to distinguish intrinsic defects from extrinsic nanocrystals, and the findings pave the way for new design and development of highly efficient optoelectronic devices based on all-inorganic lead halides.",

The Black-P crystals are found grown in situ at the site where the solid clathrate originally resides, which suggests chemical vapor mineralizer does not play a critical role for the Black-P formation. More detailed systematical studies have indicated the P vacancies in the framework of the ternary clathrate Sn24P22\u2013xI8 are important for the subsequent Black-P from phosphorus vapors, and a likely vapor\u2013solid\u2013solid model is responsible for the Black-P crystal growth. The obtained room temperature mobility \u03bc is \u223c350 cm2/V\u00b7s from Hall measurements at mechanically cleaved flakes, where noticeable microcracks are visible. The obtained high mobility value further suggests the high quality of the Black-P crystals synthesized through this route.",

Here, a novel signal cascade strategy is reported via an ultrasensitive polymeric sensing system (UPSS) composed of gold nanoparticle (gNP)-decorated polymer, which enables gNP aggregation in polymeric network and electrical conductance change upon specific aptamer-based biomolecular recognition. Ultralow concentrations of thrombin (10 m) as well as a low molecular weight anatoxin (165 Da, 10 m) are detected selectively and reproducibly. The biomolecular recognition induced polymeric network shrinkage responses as well as dose-dependent responses of the UPSS are validated using in situ real-time atomic-force microscopy, representing the first instance of real-time detection of biomolecular binding-induced polymer shrinkage in soft matter. Furthermore, in situ real-time confocal laser scanning microscopy imaging reveals the dynamic process of gNP aggregation responses upon biomolecular binding.",

        "abstract": "Classic embryological studies have documented the inductive role of root dentin on adjacent periodontal ligament differentiation.  The biochemical composition of root dentin includes collagens and cleavage products of dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), such as dentin sialoprotein (DSP).  The high abundance of DSP in root dentin prompted us to ask the question whether DSP or peptides derived thereof would serve as potent biological matrix components to induce periodontal progenitors to further differentiate into periodontal ligament cells. Here, we test the hypothesis that domain of DSP influences cell fate. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses showed that the COOH-terminal DSP domain is expressed in mouse periodontium at various stages of root development. The recombinant COOH-terminal DSP fragment (rC-DSP) enhanced attachment and migration of human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSC), human primary PDL cells without cell toxicity. rC-DSP induced PDLSC cell proliferation as well as differentiation and mineralization of PDLSC and PDL cells by formation of mineralized tissue and ALPase activity. Effect of rC-DSP on cell proliferation and differentiation was to promote gene expression of tooth/bone-relate markers, transcription factors and growth factors. The results for the first time showed that rC-DSP may be one of the components of cell niche for stimulating stem/progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation and a natural scaffold for periodontal regeneration application.",

Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2) is essential for tooth formation. However, the role of Bmp2 during enamel formation remains unknown in vivo. In this study, the role of Bmp2 in the regulation of postnatal enamel formation was investigated via the conditional ablation of Bmp2 in enamel using the (Osx-Cre) mouse. Bmp2 gene ablation was confirmed by PCR analysis in Osx-Cre, Bmp2(flox/flox) mice. Bmp2-null mice displayed a severe and profound tooth phenotype with asymmetric and open forked incisors. Microradiographs revealed broken incisor tips and dental pulp chamber exposure. The enamel layer of incisors and molars was thin with hypomineralization. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that the enamel surface was rough with chipping and the enamel lacked a typical prismatic architecture. These results demonstrate that Bmp2 is essential for enamel formation.",

However, the development of such associated miRNAs into diagnostic and therapeutic targets remains unaddressed, mostly because of a lack of functional validation. Here, we identified circulating miR-338 associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis, and performed functional validation  and . : We collected the serum from postmenopausal osteoporosis patients (N=15) and female volunteers of the same age but with normal bone density (N=15) and examined the enrichment of miR-338 cluster. We also confirmed such enrichment using mice subjected to ovariectomy at different stages. We employed primary bone marrow stromal cells from mice and the MC-3T3 cell line along with CRISPR, RNA-seq and ChIP-qPCR to validate the biological function of secreted miR-338 cluster on osteoblastic differentiation and their upstream regulators. Moreover, we generated miR-338 knockout mice and OVX mice injected with an inhibitor against miR-338 cluster to confirm its biological function . : We observed a significant enrichment of miR-338 cluster in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients. Such enrichment was also prominent in serum from mice subjected to ovariectomy and was detected much earlier than bone density decreases revealed by micro-CT. We also confirmed the presence of an estrogen-dependent //miR-338 positive feedback loop that modulated osteoblast differentiation, providing a possible explanation for our clinical findings. Moreover, deletion of the miR-338 cluster or direct intravenous injection of an miR-338 cluster inhibitor significantly prevented osteoporosis after ovariectomy. : Circulating miR-338 cluster in the serum could serve as a promising diagnostic and therapeutic target for postmenopausal osteoporosis patients.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dentin sialoprotein (DSP) is a dentin extracellular matrix protein, a unique marker of dentinogenesis and plays a vital role in odontoblast differentiation and dentin mineralization. Recently, studies have shown that DSP induces differentiation and mineralization of periodontal ligament stem cells and dental papilla mesenchymal cells in vitro and rescues dentin deficiency and increases enamel mineralization in animal models. THE HYPOTHESIS: DSP as a nature therapeutic agent stimulates dental tissue repair by inducing endogenous dental pulp mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells into odontoblast-like cells to synthesize and to secrete dentin extracellular matrix forming new tertiary dentin as well as to regenerate a functional dentin-pulp complex. As DSP is a nature protein, and clinical procedure for DSP therapy is easy and simple, application of DSP may provide a new avenue for dentists with additional option for the treatment of substantially damaged vital teeth. EVALUATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Dental caries is the most common dental disease. Deep caries and pulp exposure have been treated by various restorative materials with limited success. One promising approach is dental pulp stem/progenitor-based therapies to regenerate dentin-pulp complex and restore its functions by DSP induction in vivo.",

However, recent studies have shown that DSPP is also expressed in several active metabolic ductal epithelial tissues and exists in a variety of sequences. We have investigated DSPP expression in various mouse tissues using RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses. To identify DSPP gene polymorphisms, we screened a mouse tooth cDNA library as well as isolated and characterized DSPP variations. Our results show that DSPP is predominantly expressed in teeth and moderately in bone tissues. We also have characterized a full-length DSPP cDNA clone with an open-reading frame of 940 codons and this polyadenylation signal. Compared to previously reported mouse DSPP cDNAs, 13 sequence variations were identified, including 8 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms and an in-frame indel (8 amino acids) at DPP domain of the mouse DSPP. These 8 amino acids are rich in aspartic acid and serine residues. Northern blot assay showed a prominent band at 4.4kb. RT-PCR demonstrated that this mouse DSPP gene was dominantly expressed in teeth. The predicted secondary structure of DPP domain of this DSPP showed differences from the previously published mouse DPPs, implying that they play different roles during tooth development and formation.",

        "abstract": "Dentin sialoprotein (DSP) is a major noncollagenous protein in dentin. Mutation studies in human, along with gene knockout and transgenic experiments in mice, have confirmed the critical role of DSP for dentin formation. Our previous study reported that DSP is processed into fragments in mouse odontoblast-like cells. In order to gain insights into the function of DSP fragments, we further evaluated the expression pattern of DSP in the mouse odontoblast-like cells using immunohistochemistry and western blot assay with antibodies against the NH2- terminal and COOH-terminal regions of DSP. Then, the distribution profiles of the DSP NH2-terminal and COOHterminal fragments and osteopontin (OPN) were investigated in mouse teeth at different ages by immunohistochemistry. In the odontoblast-like cells, multiple low molecular weight DSP fragments were detected, suggesting that part of the DSP protein was processed in the odontoblast-like cells. In mouse first lower molars, immunoreactions for anti-DSP-NH2 antibody were intense in the predentin matrix but weak in mineralized dentin; in contrast, for anti-DSPCOOH antibody, strong immunoreactions were found in mineralized dentin, in particular dentinal tubules but weak in predentin. Therefore, DSP NH2-terminal and COOHterminal fragments from odontoblasts were secreted to different parts of teeth, suggesting that they may play distinct roles in dentinogenesis. Meanwhile, both DSP antibodies showed weak staining in reactionary dentin (RD), whereas osteopontin (OPN) was clearly positive in RD. Therefore, DSP may be less crucial for RD formation than OPN. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2012.",

In this study, we established and characterized immortalized mouse floxed Bmp2 dental papilla mesenchymal cell lines, which were isolated from 1st mouse mandibular molars at postnatal day 1 and immortalized with pSV40 and clonally selected. These transfected cell lines were characterized by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and analyzed for alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization nodule formation. One of these immortalized cell lines, iBmp2-dp, displayed a higher proliferation rate, but retained the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics similar to primary cells as determined by expression of tooth-specific markers as well as demonstrated the ability to differentiate and form mineralized nodules. In addition, iBmp2-dp cells were inducible and responded to BMP2 stimulation.

These results show that transfected floxed Bmp2/4 osteoblasts bypassed senescence with a higher proliferation rate, but retain the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics similar to the primary cells. Thus, we for the first time demonstrate the establishment of an immortalized mouse floxed Bmp2/4 osteoblast cell line.",

        "abstract": "Dentin tissue is derived from mesenchymal cells induced into the odontoblast lineage. The differentiation of odontoblasts is a complex process regulated by several transcriptional factor signaling transduction pathways. However, post-translational regulation of these factors during dentinogenesis remains unclear. To further explore the mechanisms, we investigated the role of microRNA (miRNA) during odontoblast differentiation. We profiled the miRNA expression pattern during mouse odontoblast differentiation using a microarray assay and identified that miR-145 and miR-143 were down-regulated during this process. In situ hybridization verified that the two miRNAs were gradually decreased during mouse odontoblast differentiation. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments revealed that down-regulation of miR-145 and miR-143 could promote odontoblast differentiation and increased Dspp and Dmp1 expression in mouse primary dental pulp cells and vice versa. We found that miR-145 and miR-143 controlled odontoblast differentiation through several mechanisms. First, KLF4 and OSX bind to their motifs in Dspp and Dmp1 gene promoters and up-regulate their transcription thereby inducing odontoblast differentiation. The miR-145 binds to the 3'-UTRs of Klf4 and Osx genes, inhibiting their expression. Second, KLF4 repressed miR-143 transcription by binding to its motifs in miR-143 regulatory regions as detected by ChIP assay and dual luciferase reporter assay. Third, miR-143 regulates odontoblast differentiation in part through miR-145 pathway. Taken together, we for the first time showed that the miR-143 and miR-145 controlled odontoblast differentiation and dentin formation through KLF4 and OSX transcriptional factor signaling pathways.",

        "abstract": "Dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp) as a differentiation marker of odontoblasts is regulated by BMP-2. However, the intimate mechanism is still unknown. Transcription factors Dlx3 and Osx are essential for odontoblasts differentiation. We hypothesized that BMP-2 regulation of Dspp transcription was mediated by Dlx3 and/or Osx in odontoblasts. In the present investigation, we found that BMP-2 stimulated expression and nuclear translocation of Dlx3 and Osx in odontoblasts both in vitro and in vivo. Osx was a downstream target of Dlx3 and both of them stimulated Dsp expression. Both Dlx3 and Osx were able to activate Dspp promoter from nucleotides (nt) -318 to +54 by transfections of luciferase reports containing different lengths of mouse Dspp promoters. The binding of Dlx3 and Osx with nt -318 to +54 of Dspp promoter was verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation in vivo. Two Dlx3 binding sites and one Osx binding site on Dspp promoter were found by EMSA. Furthermore, the exact biological function of these binding sites was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. At last, the protein-protein interaction between Dlx3 and Osx in odontoblasts was detected by co-immunoprecipitation. In conclusion, in this study we found a novel signaling pathway in which BMP-2 activates Dspp gene transcription via Dlx3/Osx pathway.",

        "abstract": "Klf10, a member of the Kr\u00fcppel-like family of transcription factors, is critical for osteoblast differentiation, bone formation and mineralization. However, whether Klf10 is involved in odontoblastic differentiation and tooth development has not been determined. In this study, we investigate the expression patterns of Klf10 during murine tooth development in vivo and its role in odontoblastic differentiation in vitro. Klf10 protein was expressed in the enamel organ and the underlying mesenchyme, ameloblasts and odontoblasts at early and later stages of murine molar formation. Furthermore, the expression of Klf10, Dmp1, Dspp and Runx2 was significantly elevated during the process of mouse dental papilla mesenchymal differentiation and mineralization. The overexpression of Klf10 induced dental papilla mesenchymal cell differentiation and mineralization as detected by alkaline phosphatase staining and alizarin red S assay. Klf10 additionally up-regulated the expression of odontoblastic differentiation marker genes Dmp1, Dspp and Runx2 in mouse dental papilla mesenchymal cells. The molecular mechanism of Klf10 in controlling Dmp1 and Dspp expression is thus to activate their regulatory regions in a dosage-dependent manner. Our results suggest that Klf10 is involved in tooth development and promotes odontoblastic differentiation via the up-regulation of Dmp1 and Dspp transcription.",

        "abstract": "Transcription factors bind to cell-specific cis-regulatory elements, such as enhancers and promoters, to initiate much of the gene expression program of different biological process. Odontoblast differentiation is a necessary step for tooth formation and is also governed by a complex gene regulatory network. Our previous in vitro experiments showed that Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) can promote odontoblastic differentiation of both mouse dental papillary cells (mDPCs) and human dental pulp cells; however, its mechanism remains unclear. We first used Wnt1-Cre; KLF4 (Klf4 cKO) mice to examine the role of KLF4 during odontoblast differentiation in vivo and demonstrated significantly impaired dentin mineralization and enlarged pulp/root canals. Additionally, combinatory analysis using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq revealed genomewide direct regulatory targets of KLF4 in mouse odontoblasts. We found that KLF4 can directly activate the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway at the beginning of odontoblast differentiation with Runx2 as a cofactor. Furthermore, we found that KLF4 can directly upregulate the expression levels of Dmp1 and Sp7, which are markers of odontoblastic differentiation, through binding to their promoters. Interestingly, as a transcription factor, KLF4 can also recruit histone acetylase as a regulatory companion to the downstream target genes to positively or negatively regulate transcription. To further investigate other regulatory companions of KLF4, we chose histone acetylase HDAC3 and P300. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that KLF4 interacted with P300 and HDAC3. Next, ChIP analysis detected P300 and HDAC3 enrichment on the promoter region of KLF4 target genes Dmp1 and Sp7. HDAC3 mainly interacted with KLF4 on day 0 of odontoblastic induction, whereas P300 interacted on day 7 of induction. These temporal-specific interactions regulated Dmp1 and Sp7 transcription, thus regulating dentinogenesis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that KLF4 regulates Dmp1 and Sp7 transcription via the modulation of histone acetylation and is vital to dentinogenesis. \u00a9 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

Although the controlling mechanisms of dentinogenesis and osteogenesis require further study, a large body of evidence points to the importance of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) participate in a wide variety of extracellular matrix degradation. Currently, we attempt to find that in MMP-9 knock out (KO) mice displayed severe attrition on teeth development. In this study a technique of low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin relaxation (T) is applied for assessment of MMP-9 KO mice and wild-type (normal). Then, the spin relaxation decay curve is converted into T distribution spectrum. Here, we propose an NMR \"calibration method\" - the ratio of the amount of fluid in pulp component to the amount of fluid in dentin component obtained from NMR T distribution spectra. This ratio method can be used to calibrate the age-growth MMP-9 KO structural changes in teeth while eliminating any variations in size of teeth. Five MMP-9 KO groups from 10 days to 147 days were tested in this study. It is found that the ratio of dental pulp chamber to dentin greatly varies on the early age periods (1 month) than on the elder ages suggesting that MMP-9 is more involved in early stages of tooth development and formation.",

The first principle calculations clearly show an increase of the density of states close to the Fermi level in the conduction band due to Al doping, which averages up the energy and effective mass of electrons, resulting in enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient.

The prepared material is anisotropic with a peak ZT of approximate to 0.8 at about 773 K measured along the hot pressing direction. This is the first report on thermoelectric properties of n-type Sn chalcogenide alloys. With increasing content of iodine, the carrier concentration changed from 2.3 x 10(17) cm(-3) (p-type) to 5.0 x 10(15) cm(-3) (n-type) then to 2.0 x 10(17) cm(-3) (n-type). The decent ZT is mainly attributed to the intrinsically low thermal conductivity due to the high anharmonicity of the chemical bonds like those in p-type SnSe. By alloying with 10 at% SnS, even lower thermal conductivity and an enhanced Seebeck coefficient were achieved, leading to an increased ZT of approximate to 1.0 at about 773 K measured also along the hot pressing direction.",

By either partial replacement of Hf and Zr with Ti in Hf0.5Zr0.5CoSb0.8Sn0.2 or partial replacement of Hf and Ti with Zr in Hf0.8Ti0.2CoSb0.8Sn0.2, a peak ZT of 1 is achieved at 800 degrees C in Hf0.44Zr0.44Ti0.12CoSb0.8Sn0.2. This composition has two advantages over the previous two best compositions: higher ZT than Hf0.5Zr0.5CoSb0.8Sn0.2 and less Hf than in Hf0.8Ti0.2CoSb0.8Sn0.2. A higher ZT with less Hf is very much desired since Hf is much more expensive than other constituent elements. The ZT improvement is the result of thermal conductivity reduction due to phonon scattering by both alloy and the nanostructure effect.",

        "abstract": "Thermoelectric properties are heavily dependent on the carrier concentration, and therefore the optimization of carrier concentration plays a central role in achieving high thermoelectric performance. The optimized carrier concentration is highly temperature-dependent and could even possibly vary within one order of magnitude in the temperature range of several hundreds of Kelvin. Practically, however, the traditional doping strategy will only lead to a constant carrier concentration, and thus the thermoelectric performance is only optimized within a limited temperature range. Here, we demonstrate that a temperature-dependent carrier concentration can be realized by simultaneously introducing shallow and deep defect levels. In this work, iodine (I) and indium (In) are co-doped in PbTe, where iodine acts as the shallow donor level that supplies sufficient electrons and indium builds up the localized half-filled deep defect state in the band gap. The indium deep defect state traps electrons at a lower temperature and the trapped electrons will be thermally activated back to the conduction band when the temperature rises. In this way, the carrier concentration can be engineered as temperature-dependent, which matches the theoretically predicted optimized carrier concentration over the whole temperature range. As a result, a room temperature ZT of _0.4 and a peak ZT of _1.4 at 773 K were obtained in the n-type In/I co-doped PbTe, leading to a record-high average ZT of _1.04 in the temperature range of 300 to 773 K. Importantly, since deep defect levels also exist in other materials, the strategy of deep defect level engineering should be widely applicable to a variety of materials for enhancing the thermoelectric performance across a broad temperature range. \u00a9 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Grain growth is a major issue in the preparation of nanostructured bismuth-antimony-tellurides during hot pressing the nanopowders into dense bulk samples. To prevent grain agglomeration during ball milling and growth during hot pressing, organic agent (Oleic Acid, OA) as additive was added into the materials at the beginning of the ball milling process. With different concentrations of OA (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 wt%), grains with different sizes are obtained. Structural analysis clearly shows that it is the particle size of the nanopowders that determines the final grain size in the densely compacted bulk samples. A combination of small grains similar to 200-500 nm and nanopores leads to effective phonon scattering, which results in the decrease of lattice thermal conductivity, and ZT of similar to 1.3 at 373 K for the sample with 2.0 wt% OA.

        "abstract": "Ti, V, Cr, Nb, and Mo are found to be effective at increasing the Seebeck coefficient and power factor of n-type PbSe at temperatures below 600 K. It is found that the higher Seebeck coefficients and power factors are due to higher Hall mobility approximate to 1000 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at lower carrier concentration. A larger average ZT value (relevant for applications) can be obtained by an optimization of carrier concentration to approximate to 10(18)-10(19) cm(-3). Even though the highest room temperature power factor approximate to 3.3 x 10(-3) W m(-1) K-2 is found in 1 at% Mo-doped PbSe, the highest ZT is achieved in Cr-doped PbSe. Combined with the lower thermal conductivity, ZT is improved to approximate to 0.4 at room temperature and peak ZTs of approximate to 1.0 are observed at approximate to 573 K for Pb0.9925Cr0.0075Se and approximate to 673 K for Pb0.995Cr0.005Se. The calculated device efficiency of Pb0.995Cr0.005Se is as high as approximate to 12.5% with cold side 300 K and hot side 873 K, higher than those of all the n-type PbSe materials reported in the literature.",

The drop is made up of simple DPD particles, and the immiscible fluids are achieved by increasing the conservative coefficient between the drop and the external fluid. The channel's upper and lower walls are moved in opposite directions to generate the shear flow field. No-slip boundary condition is imposed near the walls, and periodic boundary condition is implemented in the X and Y directions. The DPD computational results show that the drop is unstable in simple shear flow when the capillary number is larger than the critical value of 0.25. The drop is elongated and sufficiently deformed drop will break up into several smaller stable drops. For separating collision of two drops, the distance between the drop centers along the velocity gradient direction is a function of time, the value of \u03b4z after collision is larger than that before collision.",

The vortex lattice CFD method can represent the mechanism of flow-induced vibration through studying the vortex convention and vortex diffusion.

The numerical simulations are carried out by the STAR-CD solver combined with the user developed subroutines that control the numerical calculation procedures. Through the tests it is found that the discretization scheme using CD, LUD or MARS will not affect the accuracy of the numerical simulations. Through the diameter effect studies, it is found that the heat transfer of supercritical water flows in the horizontal round tube is strongly affected by the buoyancy especially for the large diameter tube. The large diameter (D = 10 mm) tube will have a high risk to have the strong heat transfer deterioration that can introduce a 180 \u00b0C wall temperature difference between the top and bottom surfaces due to the buoyancy effects. The magnitudes of the effects can be quantificationally expressed by a ratio of Grashof number over Reynolds number square. Under the high mass flux regime, the heat transfer deterioration will disappear for all the diameters from 5 mm to 10 mm. The different secondary flow patterns at different tube diameters are also studied. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The channel's walls are made up of three layers of DPD particles with no-slip boundary condition imposed on it. Periodic boundary condition is implemented in the x direction. A gravity force is applied to each fluid particle in order to drive the flow. The DPD computational results show that the fully developed velocity profile in a square channel is in good agreement with that of numerical simulation based on N-S equations. The parallel computation message passing interface (MPI) technology was implemented in the computation process, and it shows that DPD is suitable to implement parallel computation. The number of particles that are associated to the communication overhead is small compared with the number of total particle simulated in each node, hence higher parallel efficiency could be achieved. The parallel efficiency can be maintained over 80% when the number of nodes is not bigger than 18.",

Besides capillary number (Ca) and viscosity ratio, the interfacial tension between two drops plays an important role in the coalescence collision or separation collision of the two drops. Due to the non-zero surface tension between two drops, a compound drop could be formed under certain conditions, and the compound drop tumbles in simple shear flow.",

        "abstract": "The system pressure effect on heat transfer of supercritical water (SCW) flows in a horizontal round tube has been studied by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique, aiming for extending previous researches on the buoyancy effect by further investigating the coupling effects of the system pressure and the buoyancy. A commercial CFD software STAR-CD v4.02 has been used for this purpose. Simulation starts with the sensitive study of key issues, i.e. the mesh dependency, the turbulence model influence, and the near-wall treatments. It was found that on baseline mesh of 477 000 elements with near-wall grid resolution of y+ = 0.2, the simulation using the Speziale nonlinear high Reynolds k - \u03b5 turbulence model and the Hassid and Poreh near-wall treatment gives the best predictions in comparison with the experimental data. After the validation, further simulations continued to study the system pressure effect on heat transfer characteristics of SCW flows in a horizontal round tube. It was found that when the buoyancy effect is negligible, the system pressure change has significant effects on the heat transfer of the flow. This implied that the SCW physical property variations due to the system pressure change could play some dominate roles on the heat transfer. However, when the buoyancy effect was considerably strong, the system pressure change has less effect on the heat transfer due to the strong influences of the buoyancy force. This finding has indicated that the heat transfer of SCW flows in a horizontal round tube was primarily governed by the buoyancy effect as observed by previous researchers, but the system pressure changes could also have some effects that cannot be simply ignored. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

With this modified interaction, steady vapor-liquid interface could be obtained in DPD simulation, and the stress distribution across the vapor-liquid interface region was also discussed, which were found in accordance with those obtained by multibody DPD. Furthermore, surface tension of vapor-liquid interface was studied, and it was verified that Laplace's law is satisfied in our simulation.

        "abstract": "To study the deformation of red blood cells(RBCs)acted upon by an external force,a coarse-grained network model of RBCs' membrane presented recently was adopted.In the model,the membrane was constructed by a network of nonlinear springs,and the wormlike chain(WLC)spring model was applied.The free energy of the system took the in-plane free energy,bending energy,area and volume conservation constraints into consideration.The RBCs model was handled by a systematic coarse-graining procedure,and the coarse-grained model was applied to simulating the stretching deformation of RBCs by using dissipative particle dynamics(DPD).The scaling procedure relating the model's nondimensional units to physical units was discussed in detail,and the force acting on the vertices due to bend energy,area and volume conservation constraints were analyzed.The simulating results were compared with the experiments results.The results show that the coarse-grained model is efficient in simulating the deformation of RBCs,but the model is influenced by many parameters,and it needs a further improving.",

We give different formulations for our framework in different scenarios, and the experiments show that our framework can not only lead to high sparse solutions but also better performance than traditional methods.",

By using this new model and MRAS, a new sensorless vector control system with compensation of iron loss is proposed. This system includes a torque current control by compensating iron loss for high accuracy and a minimization control of losses for saving energy, especially operating in light load. The magnetizing current is optimized and varied with the load. The system control torque has higher accuracy. The proposed system satisfies the speed control requirement and achieves the goal of saving energy. The effectiveness has been verified by digital simulation.",

Under the environment of emerging Internet of Things (IoT), there would be an increasing demand for data analysis. Moreover, due to the large scope of IoT, most of the data analysis work should be handled by fog computing. However, the fog computing devices may not be trustable while the data privacy is the significant concern of the users. Thus, the data privacy should be preserved when performing SVD for data analysis. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving fog computing framework for SVD computation. The security and performance analysis shows the practicability of the proposed framework. One application of recommendation system is introduced to show the functionality of the proposed framework.",

This paper addresses subjectivity as an important issue in trust management for IoT. Subjectivity means that the information provided by each autonomous IoT device, represented by an agent, is likely to have been influenced by the deviceu0027s individual preference, which can be misleading in trust evaluation. In this paper, we seek to align the potentially subjective information with the information seekeru0027s own subjectivity so that the acquired second-hand information is more useful and personalized. Accordingly, we propose a multiagent subjectivity alignment (MASA) mechanism, which models the subjectivity using a regression technique and exchanges the models among agents as the input to an alignment process. This mechanism substantially counteracts biases incurred by different agents and improves the accuracy of second-hand information fusion as demonstrated by our simulations. In addition, we also conduct experiments using a real-world dataset (MovieLens) which further validates the efficacy of MASA.",

In these contexts, it may be important to be filtering the wealth of messages that have been sent, which form the ongoing communication within a large community of users. This is achieved by constructing an intelligent agent that reasons about the message and each peer rater of the message, learning over time to properly gage whether a message is good or bad to show a user, based on message ratings, rater similarity, and rater credibility. Our approach employs a partially observable Markov decision process for trust modeling, moving beyond the more traditional adoption of probabilistic reasoning using beta reputation functions. In addition to outlining the technique in full, we present empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, both in simulations featuring head to head comparisons with competitors, and in the context of some existing online social networks where ground truth data are available.",

In the future cyber-physical system (CPS), all objects in cyber world and physical world would be connected, and the concepts of cyber world and physical world will no longer exist. The speed of information transmitting and processing will be faster, the abilities of controlling facilities and handling events will be more powerful, and our lives will be better. In the CPS, machine to machine (M2M) communication is in charge of data collecting and transmitting, which utilizes both wireless and wired systems to monitor physical or environmental conditions and exchange the information among different systems without direct human intervention. As a part of CPS, M2M communication is considerably important while being fragile at the same time because M2M communication still faces lots of security threats that are not only from outside but also from inside. In traditional M2M communication, the M2M service provider (MSP) is always assumed to be trusted. However, the MSP could be compromised in real world. In that case, the previous security solutions would fail because the most confidential materials are kept in the MSP by the conventional solutions. How to protect the entire system from the compromised MSP is one important problem the paper intends to solve. In addition, the communication bandwidth and energy resource for the M2M devices are precious. Another issue the paper is addressing is the design of efficient security schemes being able to save both energy and communication bandwidth. In this paper, an authentication scheme applying authenticated identity-based cryptography without key-escrow mechanism has been proposed. In the proposed scheme, only partial secrets instead of full secrets are stored in the MSP, which could prevent the compromised MSP from endangering the whole system. The authenticated encryption property of the proposed scheme could leave out the work of signature generation, transmission, and verification so as to save the computation and communication resource of the whole system. The security analysis with Burrows\u2013Abadi\u2013Needham logic (BAN Logic) and Simple Promela Interpreter (SPIN) shows that the proposed scheme is well designed and could withstand Man-in-the-Middle attacks, impersonation attacks, replay attacks, DoS attacks, and compromised attacks.

        "abstract": "The Internet has made our planet a smaller world while the cyber world and the physical world have not been integrated seamlessly. In the future cyber-physical system (CPS), all objects in the physical world would be connected to the cyber world for achieving faster information processing, more accurate control and real-time response. Our abilities of controlling facilities and handling events will be much more powerful to make our lives much better. In the CPS, the machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, which is in charge of data collection, utilizes both wireless and wired systems to monitor environmental conditions and transmits the information among different systems without direct human intervention. As a part of the CPS, the M2M communication is considerable important while being fragile at the same time since M2M communication still faces lots of security threats. There are some security vulnerabilities that yet to be solved. In this paper, we propose an anonymous authentication scheme for multi-domain M2M environment. The proposed scheme applies hybrid encryption scheme involving certificateless cryptography and advanced encryption standard (AES) to achieve the authentication and anonymity properties. The security analysis with Burrows\u2013Abadi\u2013Needham (BAN) logic and the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) shows that the proposed scheme is well designed and could withstand multiple attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, replay attacks, DoS attacks, impersonation attacks and compromised attacks.",

        "abstract": "Raman spectroscopy has shown great potential in biomedical applications. However, intrinsically weak Raman signals cause slow data acquisition especially in Raman imaging. This problem can be overcome by narrow-band Raman imaging followed by spectral reconstruction. Our previous study has shown that Raman spectra free of fluorescence background can be reconstructed from narrow-band Raman measurements using traditional Wiener estimation. However, fluorescence-free Raman spectra are only available from those sophisticated Raman setups capable of fluorescence suppression. The reconstruction of Raman spectra with fluorescence background from narrow-band measurements is much more challenging due to the significant variation in fluorescence background. In this study, two advanced Wiener estimation methods, i.e. modified Wiener estimation and sequential weighted Wiener estimation, were optimized to achieve this goal. Both spontaneous Raman spectra and surface enhanced Raman spectra were evaluated. Compared with traditional Wiener estimation, two advanced methods showed significant improvement in the reconstruction of spontaneous Raman spectra. However, traditional Wiener estimation can work as effectively as the advanced methods for SERS spectra but much faster. The wise selection of these methods would enable accurate Raman reconstruction in a simple Raman setup without the function of fluorescence suppression for fast Raman imaging. ",

        "abstract": "Raman spectroscopy has been intensively explored in biomedical applications. However, Raman data acquisition is generally slow due to inherently weak Raman signals. Narrow-band Raman measurements can compensate for the weak Raman signal by performing integration in the wavenumber dimension, in which the Raman spectrum with high spectral resolution needs to be reconstructed from the narrow-band measurements. However, this method is limited in the requirement of a calibration dataset, in which the calibration samples have to be similar to test samples in Raman features. Therefore, a new calibration dataset is often needed for every type of samples. We propose a method to create a universal calibration dataset for Raman reconstruction to overcome this limitation. In our method, the Raman spectra measured from each basic biochemical component in samples instead of from actual samples are used in the calibration dataset. In this study, the proposed method was tested on 27 liquid phantoms and 56 cell measurements. The results demonstrated the excellent performance of Raman reconstruction using the universal calibration dataset compared to that using the traditional calibration dataset and the measured Raman spectra.",

        "abstract": "Flap transfer has become a common technique in reconstructive surgery. However, a significant number of compromised skin flaps are not successfully salvaged because the current clinical method for flap assessment relies heavily on the clinician's experience. Vascular occlusion is the major reason for flap failure, thus the accurate and objective early prediction of blood vessel occlusion is vitally important. Our parallel point measurement study has demonstrated the great potential of joint diffuse reflectance and autofluorescence spectroscopy in the early detection and differentiation of venous and arterial occlusion in skin flaps. Unfortunately, the technique of point measurements is not suitable to examine a large skin flap when a high spatial resolution is required. In this study, we attempted to overcome this problem by performing spectral diffuse reflectance and autofluorescence imaging on a rat skin flap model. Both imaging data and reconstructed spectra were used to statistically differentiate control flaps, arterially occluded flaps and venously occluded flaps. Our preliminary results suggest that the technique of joint diffuse reflectance and autofluorescence spectroscopic imaging can achieve high classification accuracy thus could be used to detect and differentiate flaps with venous and arterial occlusion accurately at an early time point in a large skin flap. Typical reconstructed spectra of (a) diffuse reflectance and (b) autofluorescence after normalization.",

        "abstract": "Raman spectroscopic imaging is a powerful label-free tool for studying cells and tissues in biology and medicine, but it suffers from extremely slow data acquisition. In this Letter, a novel multi-channel Raman imaging technique is proposed to speed up Raman acquisition. Wide-field Raman images are taken in multiple narrow-band channels, each through a different bandpass filter, simultaneously in one camera frame. Then Wiener estimation is used to quickly reconstruct the full Raman spectrum at each pixel from narrow-band measurements. The proposed system with four channels was evaluated in the mixtures of two and three chemicals exhibiting strong Raman scattering because of convenience in the verification of reconstructed spectra. This new technique is expected to overcome the limitation of traditional Raman spectroscopic imaging in speed, and expand its applications in the label-free analysis of both biological and non-biological samples, where potential species are known and fast imaging is required to investigate temporally varying events.

        "abstract": "Raman spectroscopy has demonstrated great potential in biomedical applications. However, spectroscopic Raman imaging is limited in the investigation of fast changing phenomena because of slow data acquisition. Our previous studies have indicated that spectroscopic Raman imaging can be significantly sped up using the approach of narrow-band imaging followed by spectral reconstruction. A multi-channel system was built to demonstrate the feasibility of fast wide-field spectroscopic Raman imaging using the approach of simultaneous narrow-band image acquisition followed by spectral reconstruction based on Wiener estimation in phantoms. To further improve the accuracy of reconstructed Raman spectra, we propose a stepwise spectral reconstruction method in this study, which can be combined with the earlier developed sequential weighted Wiener estimation to improve spectral reconstruction accuracy. The stepwise spectral reconstruction method first reconstructs the fluorescence background spectrum from narrow-band measurements and then the pure Raman narrow-band measurements can be estimated by subtracting the estimated fluorescence background from the overall narrow-band measurements. Thereafter, the pure Raman spectrum can be reconstructed from the estimated pure Raman narrow-band measurements. The result indicates that the stepwise spectral reconstruction method can improve spectral reconstruction accuracy significantly when combined with sequential weighted Wiener estimation, compared with the traditional Wiener estimation. In addition, qualitatively accurate cell Raman spectra were successfully reconstructed using the stepwise spectral reconstruction method from the narrow-band measurements acquired by a four-channel wide-field Raman spectroscopic imaging system. This method can potentially facilitate the adoption of spectroscopic Raman imaging to the investigation of fast changing phenomena.",

In this report, we further evaluated our technique for the early detection and differentiation of venous occlusion and arterial occlusion in a rat groin flap model. We performed both diffuse reflectance and autofluorescence measurements on the skin flap model and statistically differentiated between flaps with and without occlusions as well as between flaps with venous occlusion and those with arterial occlusion based on these non-invasive optical measurements. Our preliminary results suggested that visible diffuse reflectance and autofluorescence spectroscopy can be potentially used clinically to detect both venous and arterial occlusion and differentiate one from the other accurately at an early time point.

        "abstract": "Raman spectroscopy is a rapid and non-destructive technique for detecting unique spectral fingerprints from biological samples. Raw Raman spectra often come with strong fluorescence background that makes spectral interpretation challenging. Although fluorescence background can be suppressed experimentally, this approach requires sophisticated and costly instruments. For convenience and cost-effectiveness, numerical methods have been used frequently to remove fluorescence background. Unfortunately, many of such methods suffer from long computation time. Therefore, a fast numerical method for fluorescence suppression is highly desirable especially in Raman spectroscopic imaging where Raman measurements from many pixels need to be processed rapidly. In response to this demand, we propose a fast numerical method for fluorescence background suppression based on the strategy of stepwise spectral reconstruction that we previously developed. Compared with traditional computational methods, including polynomial fitting, wavelet transform, Fourier transform, and peak detection, our results consistently show significant advantages in both accuracy and computational efficiency when tested on Raman spectra measured from phantoms and cells as well as surfaced enhanced Raman spectra from blood serum samples. In particular, our method yields clean Raman spectra closest to the reference results generated by polynomial fitting while several orders of magnitude faster than others. Therefore, the proposed fast fluorescence suppression method is promising in Raman spectroscopic imaging or related application in which high-computation efficiency is critical and a calibration dataset is available.",

This paper investigated the characteristics of epipolar geometry for a single-lens prism-based stereovision. The prism was considered as a single optical lens. By analyzing each plane individually and then combining them together, an affine transformation matrix which can express the relationship between an object point and its image was derived. Then, the homography between object point and its image was established. Finally, the epipolar geometry as well as the epipolar rectification method was proposed. Experimental results verify that rectification of the image pair based on our proposed model can achieve better performance with much less geometric distortion.",

Accurate analysis of the type of kidney stones plays a crucial role in the patient's follow-up treatment. This study used microscopic Raman spectroscopy to analyze and classify the different mineral components present in kidney stones. There were several Raman changes observed for the different types of kidney stones and the four types were oxalates, phosphates, purines and L-cystine kidney stones. We then combined machine learning techniques with Raman spectroscopy. KNN and SVM combinations with PCA (PCA-KNN, PCA-SVM) methods were implemented to classify the same spectral data set. The results show the diagnostic accuracies are 96.3% for the PCA-KNN and PCA-SVM methods with high sensitivity (0.963, 0.963) and specificity (0.995,0.985). The experimental Raman spectra results of kidney stones show the proposed method has high classification accuracy.

The results showed that the effect of the SVM classifier in predicting breast axillary lymph node metastasis was significantly higher than that of the KNN classifier and LDA classifier. The SVM classifier performed best, with the highest accuracy of 89.54%, and obtained an AUC of 0.8615 for identifying the lymph node status.

        "abstract": "Raman spectroscopy is a label-free and non-destructive spectroscopic technique that has been explored for bacterial identification. However, noise often interferes with the interesting Raman peaks because the Raman signal is inherently weak, especially for bacterial samples. Although this problem can be solved by increasing the exposure time or the power of the excitation laser, a longer acquisition time is required or the risk of sample damage is increased. In contrast, short exposure time and low laser power often lead to inadequate acquisition of Raman scattering, in which the Raman spectra with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is difficult to be further analyzed. In order to quickly and accurately characterize biological samples by using low SNR Raman measurements, a weighted spectral reconstruction based method was developed and tested on Raman spectra with low SNR from 20 bacterial samples of two species. Principal component analysis followed by support vector machine was applied on the reference Raman spectra and the spectra recovered from the low SNR Raman measurements by the proposed method, the traditional spectral reconstruction method, and four other commonly used de-noising methods for the discrimination of bacterial species. The results showed that a classification accuracy of 90% was achieved based on our method, which was comparable to that of the reference Raman spectra and showed significant advantages over other spectral recovery methods. Therefore, the weighted spectral reconstruction method can preserve the most biochemical information for the bacterial speciesu0027 identification while removing the noise from the low SNR Raman spectra, in which the advantages of lesser sample damage and shorter acquisition time would promote wider biomedical applications of Raman spectroscopy.",

        "abstract": "Maternally expressed gene 3 (Meg3), a long non-coding RNA, has been reported to be associated with the pathogenesis of multiple malignancies. However, little is known regarding the role of Meg3 in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). In this study, we found that the expression of Meg3 was lower in epithelial ovarian carcinoma, and has potential to be considered as a biomarker for ovarian cancer. After transfecting the ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR3 and A2780 with Meg3, phenotypic changes and autophagy-related molecules were examined. Upregulation of Meg3 inhibited cell proliferation, plate colony formation, induced cell cycle arrest in G2 phases, and promoted apoptosis. Observation of autophagosomes was performed by transmission electron microscopy. The expression levels of LC3-II, ATG3, LAMP1 were elevated, while SQSTM1/p62 expression declined. Upregulated expression of Meg3 also suppressed tumorigenesis in vivo in a xenograft mouse model through upregulating ATG3 expression. RIP (ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation) and RNA pull-down assays showed that Meg3 was co-immunoprecipitated with ATG3. In addition, Meg3 protected ATG3 mRNA from degradation following treatment with actinomycin D. Overall, our results suggest that the lncRNA Meg3 acts as a tumor suppressor in EOC by regulating ATG3 activity and inducing autophagy.",

        "abstract": "Metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 (MACC1), has recently been identified as a key regulator in the progression of many cancers. However, its role in endometrial carcinoma (EC) remains unknown. MACC1 expression was determined in EC and normal endometrial tissues by immunohistochemistry. EC cell phenotypes and related molecules were examined after MACC1 downregulation by Small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) transfection. We found that MACC1 was highly expressed in EC tissues than normal samples, and was significantly different in FIGO staging (I and II vs. III and IV), the depth of myometrial infiltration (<1/2 vs. \u22651/2), lymph nodes metastasis (negative vs. positive), besides, MACC1 overexpression was correlated with lower cumulative and relapse-free survival rate. MACC1 downregulation by siRNA transfection significantly induced G1 phrase arrest, suppressed EC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, MACC1 downregulation also reduced expression of Cyclin D1 and Cyclin-dependent Kinase 2 (CDK2), N-cadherin (N-Ca), \u03b1-SMA, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), and MMP9, but increased expression of E-cadherin (E-Ca). Bioinformatic predictions and dual-luciferase reporter assays indicate that MACC1 is a possible target of miR-23b. MiR-23b overexpression reduced MACC1 expression in vitro and induced G1 phrase arrest, suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. MiR-23b transfection also reduced Cyclin D1 and CDK2, N-Ca, \u03b1-SMA, MMP2, MMP9 expression, but increased E-Ca expression. Furthermore, the nude mouse xenograft assay showed that miR-23b overexpression suppressed tumour growth through downregulating MACC1 expression. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that MACC1 may be a new and important diagnosis and therapeutic target of endometrial carcinoma.",

We found that miR-372 expression is much lower in EC than normal endometrial specimens. Cell function experiments demonstrated that miR-372 overexpression suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and led to a G1 phase arrest and promoted the apoptosis of endometrial carcinoma cells  in vitro . The nude mouse xenograft assay demonstrated that miR-372 overexpression suppressed tumor growth. RT-PCR and Western blot assays detected the expression of known targets of miR-372 in other malignant tumors and found Cyclin A1 and Cyclin-dependent Kinase 2 (CDK2) was downregulated by miR-372. Bioinformatic predictions and dual-luciferase reporter assays found that RhoC was a possible target of miR-372. RT-PCR and Western blot assays demonstrated that miR-372 transfection reduced the expression of RhoC, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP9, while it increased the expression of cleaved poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) and bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax). The cell function experiments that transfected siRNA with RhoC showed the same trend as those which were transfected with miR-372. Taken together, our results demonstrated for the first time that miR-372 suppresses tumorigenesis and the development of EC; RhoC is a new and potentially important therapeutic target.",

The expression of lncRNA ABHD11-AS1 was quantified by qRT-PCR in human endometrial carcinoma (n\u00a0=\u00a089) and normal endometrial tissues (n\u00a0=\u00a027). LncRNA ABHD11-AS1 was stably overexpressed or knocked-down in endometrial carcinoma cell lines to examine the cellular phenotype and expression of related molecules. Compared to normal endometrial tissue, lncRNA ABHD11-AS1 was significantly overexpressed in endometrial carcinoma. Overexpression of lncRNA ABHD11-AS1 promoted the proliferation, G1-S progression, invasion and migration of endometrial cancer cells; inhibited apoptosis; up-regulated cyclin D1, CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, Bcl-xl and VEGFA; and down-regulated p16, while ABHD11-AS1 down-regulation has the opposite effect. RNA pull down demonstrated that lncRNA ABHD11-AS1 binds directly to cyclin D1. Knockdown of cyclin D1 can reverse the effect of ABHD11-AS1. Overexpression of lncRNA ABHD11-AS1 increased the tumorigenicity and up-regulated cyclin D1 in an in\u00a0vivo model of endometrial cancer in nude mice. LncRNA ABHD11-AS1 functions as an oncogene to promote cell proliferation and invasion in endometrial carcinoma by positively targeting cyclin D1.",

        "abstract": "E2F1 (E2F transcription factor 1) can act as a tumor suppressor or oncogene. We report the molecular mechanism of E2F1 in ovarian carcinoma tumorigenesis and progression. E2F1 expression levels in ovarian carcinoma tissue were examined by immunohistochemistry. After E2F1 plasmid transfection and E2F1-microRNA-519d (miR-519d)/si-RhoC (Ras homolog gene family member C) co-transfection, ovarian cancer cell phenotypes and the related molecules were examined in vitro and in vivo. E2F1 was overexpressed in type I and type II ovarian carcinoma as compared to normal ovary tissues and normal fallopian tube tissues, respectively. E2F1 overexpression promoted cell proliferation, G1-S progression, survival, migration, and invasion in vitro; miR-519d or siRhoC co-transfection reversed E2F1 oncogenic effects. E2F1 overexpression promoted tumor growth in vivo; miR-519d overexpression inhibited it. E2F1 overexpression increased RhoC, Bcl-2, cyclin D1, survivin, MMP2 (matrix metalloproteinase 2), MMP9, STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), and HuR (ELAV-like RNA-binding protein 1) expression; miR-519d overexpression decreased their expression. E2F1 downregulated miR-519d directly and miR-519d downregulated RhoC directly. Conversely, miR-519d directly downregulated E2F1, There is a direct repressive regulatory loop between E2F1 and miR-519d. We provide evidence that E2F1/miR-519d/RhoC is a promising signaling pathway for diagnosing and treating ovarian carcinoma.",

However, the relationship between FOXA1 and ovarian cancer has not been reported. We examined normal ovarian tissue and ovarian cancer tissue and found increased FOXA1 expression in the cancer tissue. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and flow cytometry assays demonstrated that transfection with small interfering RNA to silence FOXA1 (si-FOXA1) in ovarian cancer cell lines decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and S-phase arrest. In addition, si-FOXA1 transfection inhibited cell migration and invasion. Western blotting showed that si-FOXA1 transfection decreased the levels of YY1-associated protein 1, cyclin-dependent kinase 1, cyclin D1, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, E2F transcription factor 1, B-cell lymphoma 2, and vascular endothelial growth factor A protein. Based on these results, we suggest that FOXA1 plays a catalytic role in ovarian cancer pathogenesis and development by affecting the expression of the above-mentioned proteins.",

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been associated with cancer; its role in endometrial carcinoma is an emerging area of research. In this article, lncRNA TDRG1 expression in human endometrial carcinoma tissues and normal endometrial tissues was quantified by qRT-PCR. LncRNA TDRG1 was overexpressed or knocked-down in neither HEC-1B nor Ishikawa endometrial carcinoma cells, respectively, to assess cellular phenotype and expression of related molecules. Our results showed that lncRNA TDRG1 was significantly overexpressed in endometrial carcinoma tissues. Overexpression of lncRNA TDRG1 promoted endometrial carcinoma cell viability, invasion and migratory ability, inhibited apoptosis, and upregulated VEGF-A, PI3K, Bcl-2, MMP2 and survivin; knockdown of lncRNA TDRG1 had the opposite effects. LncRNA TDRG1 overexpression increased tumorigenicity in vivo and was associated with the upregulation of VEGF-A. RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays confirmed that lncRNA TDRG1 directly binds to VEGF-A protein. Furthermore, knockdown of VEGFA in lncRNA TDRG1-overexpressing endometrial carcinoma cells reversed the effects of lncRNA TDRG1 on cell proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis. In conclusion, lncRNA TDRG1 may promote endometrial carcinoma cell proliferation and invasion by positively targeting VEGF-A and modulating relative genes.",

        "abstract": "Recently, a large number of studies have focused on the important role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in metabolism and development and have found that abnormal lncRNA expression is associated with the pathogenesis and development of many diseases. The lncRNA DLEU1 is involved in many solid tumours and haematological malignancies. However, its role in epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) and the associated molecular mechanisms has not been reported. In this study, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated higher lncRNADLEU1 expression in EOC tissues than in normal tissues. Plasmid transfection of DLEU1 to up-regulate its expression in the ovarian cancer cell lines A2780 and OVCAR3 increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while inhibited apoptosis. Nude mouse xenograft assay demonstrated that DLEU1 overexpression promoted tumour growth in\u00a0vivo. QRT-PCR showed decreased miR-490-3p expression, while Western blotting demonstrated increased its target genes CDK1, cyclinD1 and SMARCD1, as well as matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), Bcl-xL and P70S6K protein expression, respectively. Short interfering RNA silencing of DLEU1 produced opposite results, where qRT-PCR showed increased miR-490-3p expression. The dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed a direct interaction between DLEU1 and miR-490-3p. MiR-490-3p plays a tumour suppressor role in epithelial ovarian cancer by targeting CDK1 regulation and influencing SMARCD1 and cyclin D1 (CCND1) expressions. Therefore, we suggest that through interaction with miR-490-3p, DLEU1 may influence the expression of CDK1, CCND1 and SMARCD1 protein, subsequently promoting the development and progression of EOC.",

As new members of the ncRNAs, circRNAsu0027 formation, function, and mechanism are attracting increased research attention. CircRNAs play important roles in all kinds of cancer and may be potential novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancer treatment through their function as microRNA (miRNA) molecular  RNA-binding protein (RBP) sponges, protein translators, and gene transcription regulators.

        "abstract": "Endometrial carcinoma is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in females. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been associated with cancer; its role in endometrial carcinoma is an emerging area of research. In this article, lncRNA TDRG1 expression in human endometrial carcinoma tissues and normal endometrial tissues was quantified by qRT-PCR. LncRNA TDRG1 was overexpressed or knocked-down in neither HEC-1B nor Ishikawa endometrial carcinoma cells, respectively, to assess cellular phenotype and expression of related molecules. Our results showed that lncRNA TDRG1 was significantly overexpressed in endometrial carcinoma tissues. Overexpression of lncRNA TDRG1 promoted endometrial carcinoma cell viability, invasion and migratory ability, inhibited apoptosis, and upregulated VEGF-A, PI3K, Bcl-2, MMP2 and survivin; knockdown of lncRNA TDRG1 had the opposite effects. LncRNA TDRG1 overexpression increased tumorigenicity in vivo and was associated with the upregulation of VEGF-A. RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays confirmed that lncRNA TDRG1 directly binds to VEGF-A protein. Furthermore, knockdown of VEGFA in lncRNA TDRG1-overexpressing endometrial carcinoma cells reversed the effects of lncRNA TDRG1 on cell proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis. In conclusion, lncRNA TDRG1 may promote endometrial carcinoma cell proliferation and invasion by positively targeting VEGF-A and modulating relative genes.",

        "abstract": "Circular RNAs are known to participate in tumorigenesis through a variety of pathways, and as such, have potential to serve as molecular markers in tumor diagnosis and treatment. Here, using quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR, we showed that circ-CSPP1 is highly expressed in ovarian cancer (OC) tissues. Particularly, we detected circ-CSPP1 expression in three OC cell lines; of which, OVCAR3 and A2780 demonstrated higher levels of circ-CSPP1 expression, and CAOV3 showed lower circ-CSPP1 expression level. Subsequent silencing of circ-CSPP1 in OVCAR3 and A2780 cell lines revealed decreased cell growth, migration and invasion, while overexpression of circ-CSPP1 caused opposite results We also found that miR-1236-3p is a target of circ-CSPP1. Circ-CSPP1 silencing increased the expression of miR-1236-3p, and circ-CSPP1 overexpression decreased miR-1236-3p expression. MiR-1236-3p reportedly plays a tumor-suppressor role in OC by targeting zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1). In agreement with this, we showed that silencing circ-CSPP1 significantly decreased ZEB1 expression at both RNA and protein levels, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related markers (E-cadherin and N-cadherin) varied with ZEB1 expression. Circ-CSPP1 silencing also caused decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), both of which are related to tumorigenesis. Overexpression of circ-CSPP1 had opposite effects. In addition, we indicated that the tumor-promoting effect was inhibited after we transfected miR-1236-3p into circ-CSPP1 overexpressing OC cells. Altogether, our findings suggest that by acting as a miR-1236-3p sponge, circ-CSPP1 impairs the inhibitory effect of miR-1236-3p on ZEB1, which subsequently promotes EMT and OC development.",

MiR-490-3p has been reported to be a suppressor in various human cancers; however, little is known about the biological functions of miR-490-3p in endometrial cancer (EC). In our study, we found that MiR-490-3p mRNA expression was significantly lower in ECs than in normal endometrial tissues. MiR-490-3p mRNA expression was also negatively associated with depth of invasion (mucosa  vs . muscular and serosa) and lymph node metastasis (negative  vs . positive) in EC. MiR-490-3p overexpression reduced proliferation; promoted G1 arrest and apoptosis; suppressed migration and invasion; and reduced TGF\u03b1, NF-kB, cyclin D1, survivin, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) mRNA and protein expression, and improved Bax mRNA and protein expression. The dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-490-3p directly targeted TGF\u03b1 by binding its 3\u2019 untranslated region. MiR-490-3P transfection also suppressed tumor development and TGF\u03b1 expression (as determined by immunohistochemistry and western blotting) in vivo in the xenograft mouse model. This is the first demonstration that miR-490-3P might act as a suppressor in EC tumorigenesis and progression by targeting TGF\u03b1. Our results provide a theoretical basis for the further study on the molecular target for endometrial cancer.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Recent studies have shown that microRNAs may regulate the ABCB1 gene (ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B [MDR/TAP], member 1). Computational programs have predicted that the 3\u2019-untranslated region (3\u2019-UTR) of ABCB1 contains a potential miRNA-binding site for miR-186. Here, we investigated the role of miR-186 in sensitizing ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel and cisplatin. Results Human ovarian carcinoma cell lines OVCAR3, A2780, A2780/DDP, and A2780/Taxol were exposed to paclitaxel or cisplatin with or without miR-186 transfection, and cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis were used to assess the MDR1, GST-\u03c0, and MRP1 expression levels. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to reveal the correlation between miR-186 and ABCB1. Lower miR-186 while higher MDR1 and GST-\u03c0 mRNA expression levels were found in the A2780/Taxol and A2780/DDP cells than in the A2780 cells. After miR-186 transfection, all the cell lines showed increased sensitivity to paclitaxel and cisplatin. MiR-186 transfection induced apoptosis while anti-miR-186 transfection reduced apoptosis. The dual-luciferase reporter assay verified that that miR-186 combined with the 3\u2019-untranslated region (UTR) of ABCB1. MDR1 and GST-\u03c0 mRNA and protein expression levels were downregulated after transfection with miR-186 but upregulated following anti-miR-186 transfection compared to the mock and negative control cancer cells; however, the MRP1 expression levels did not significantly differ among the groups. Conclusion Our results are the first to demonstrate that miR-186 may sensitize ovarian cancer cell to paclitaxel and cisplatin by targeting ABCB1 and modulating the expression of GST-\u03c0.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNA-93, derived from a paralog (miR-106b-25) of the miR-17-92 cluster, is involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of many cancers such as breast, colorectal, hepatocellular, lung, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer. However, the role of miR-93 in endometrial carcinoma and the potential molecular mechanisms involved remain unknown. Our results showed that miR-93 was overexpressed in endometrial carcinoma tissues than normal endometrial tissues. The endometrial carcinoma cell lines HEC-1B and Ishikawa were transfected with miR-93-5P, after which cell migration and invasion ability and the expression of relevant molecules were detected. MiR-93 overexpression promoted cell migration and invasion, and downregulated E-cadherin expression while increasing N-cadherin expression. Dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-93 may directly bind to the 3' untranslated region of forkhead box A1 (FOXA1); furthermore, miR-93 overexpression downregulated FOXA1 expression while miR-93 inhibitor transfection upregulated FOXA1 expression at both mRNA and protein level. In addition, transfection with the most effective FOXA1 small interfering RNA promoted both endometrial cancer cell migration and invasion, and downregulated E-cadherin expression while upregulating N-cadherin expression. Therefore, we suggest that miR-93 may promote the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in endometrial carcinoma cells by targeting FOXA1.",

Here we show that CEMIP expression level in ovarian cancer tissues was higher than that in normal ovaries. Silencing of CEMIP in ovarian cancer cell lines A2780 and OVCAR3 significantly decreased cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion capacity, while the proportion of apoptotic cells was increased. In addition, Western blotting demonstrated that knockdown of CEMIP inhibited activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Altogether, these data suggest that CEMIP may promote the development of ovarian cancer by regulating PI3K/AKT signaling.",

        "abstract": "Highly upregulated in liver cancer (HULC) is a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), which has recently been identified as a key regulator in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, gliomas and gastric cancer. However, its role in epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) remains unknown. In this study, HULC expression was examined in EOC, borderline and benign ovarian tumors, and normal ovarian tissues by RT-PCR. Ovarian cancer cell phenotypes, as well as autophagy-associated proteins were examined after HULC overexpression or downregulation by plasmid or small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection, respectively. LncRNA-protein interactions were examined by ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. We found that HULC expression levels were higher in EOC tissues than normal samples. HULC overexpression induced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, whereas reduced cell apoptosis in vitro and induced tumor growth in vivo. In contrast, downregulation of HULC by siRNA transfection reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and induced cell apoptosis and autophagy. Our results showed that HULC overexpression reduced ATG7, LC3-II and LAMP1 expression, while inducing SQSTM1 (P62) and ITGB1 expression. HULC downregulation had the opposite effects. Furthermore, RIP indicated that ATG7 interacted with HULC; ATG7 downregulation also induced cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis and inhibited autophagy in vitro by reducing LC3-II and LAMP1 expression, while inducing SQSTM1 expression. Furthermore, ATG7 co-transfection with HULC reversed the oncogenic effects of HULC both in vitro and in vivo; however, downregulating ATG7 did not affect cell migration and invasive ability. We found that ITGB1 siRNA co-transfection with HULC reversed the function of HULC in inducing ovarian cancer cell migration and invasive ability. Taken together, our results show that HULC may promote ovarian carcinoma tumorigenesis by inhibiting ATG7 and inducing progression by regulating ITGB1.",

This study focused on assessing the expression, functions and molecular mechanism of circPUM1 in lung adenocarcinoma. Here, it showed that circPUM1 is significantly upregulated in both lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and tissues. Furthermore, silencing of circPUM1 impaired the proliferation, migration and invasion ability, and increased apoptosis in A549\u202fcells. Nevertheless, overexpression of circPUM1 in SPC-A1 cells has the opposite effect. Silencing of circPUM1 inhibits the tumorigenesis in nude mice. Mechanistically, circPUM1 could sponge miR-326 and promote the expression of its downstream proteins Cyclin D1 and Bcl-2. In summary, this present study revealed that circPUM1 functions as an oncogene to promote the tumorigenesis of lung adenocarcinoma through circPUM1/miR-326/Cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 axis.

        "abstract": "We present a detailed study of geochronology, mineral chemistries, bulk-rock major and trace element abundances, and Sr-Nd-Hf isotope compositions of the granodiorite and associated dioritic dikes in the Hongqilafu pluton at the northwestern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The granodiorite and dioritic dikes yielded zircon U-Pb ages of similar to 104 Ma and similar to 100 Ma, respectively. The dioritic dikes comprise varying lithologies of gabbroic diorite, diorite porphyry and granodiorite porphyry, exhibiting a compositional spectrum from intermediate to felsic rocks. Their mineral compositions display disequilibrium features such as large major element compositional variations of plagioclase, clinopyroxene and amphibole crystals. These dioritic dikes are enriched in incompatible elements (Ba, Rb, Th, U, K) and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopes (Sr-87/(86)Sri: 0.7066 to 0.7071, epsilon(Nd)(t): 5.3 to 7.4, epsilon(Hf)(t): -3.6 to -6.2). We suggest that the dioritic dikes were most likely derived from partial melting of mantle wedge metasomatized by the subducted/subducting seafloor with a sediment component, followed by AFC processes with fractional crystallization of clinopyroxene, amphibole and plagioclase and assimilation of lower continental crust. The mantle-wedge derived magma parental to the dioritic dikes underplated and induced the lower continental crust to melt, forming the felsic crustal magma parental to the granodiorite with mantle melt signatures and having more enriched isotope compositions (Sr-87/(86)Sri: 0.7087 to 0.7125, epsilon(Nd)(t): 9.5 to -11.6, epsilon(Hf)(t): -10.3 to -14.1) than those of the dioritic dikes. The Hongqilafu pluton is thus the product of mantle-crust interaction at an active continental margin subduction setting over the period of several million years. This understanding further indicates that the closure timing of the Shyok back-arc basin and the collision between the Kohistan-Ladakh Arc and the Karakoram Terrane may have taken place later than similar to 100 Ma.

        "abstract": "Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is the most commonly used technique to determine the abundances of trace elements in a wide range of geological materials. However, incomplete sample digestion, isobaric interferences and instrumental drift remain obvious problems that must be overcome in order to obtain precise and accurate results. For this reason, we have done many experiments and developed a set of simple, cost-effective and practical methods widely applicable for precise and rapid determination of trace element abundances in geological materials using ICP-MS. Commonly used high-pressure digestion technique is indeed effective in decomposing refractory phases, but this inevitably produces fluoride complexes that create new problems. We demonstrate that the fluoride complexes formed during high-pressure digestion can be readily re-dissolved using high-pressure vessel at 190 \u00b0C for only 2 h for 50 mg sample. In the case of isobaric interferences, although oxide (e.g., MO+/M+) and hydroxide (e.g., MOH+/M+) productivity is variable between runs, the (MO+/M+)/(CeO+/Ce+) and (MOH+/M+)/(CeO+/Ce+) ratios remain constant, making isobaric interference correction for all other elements of interest straightforward, for which we provide an easy-to-use off-line procedure. We also show that mass-time-intensity drift curve is smooth as recognized previously, for which the correction can be readily done by analyzing a quality-control (QC) solution and using off-line Excel VBA procedure without internal standards. With these methods, we can produce data in reasonable agreement with recommended values of international rock reference standards with a relative error of  60% of time (e.g.,  60 h).",

        "title": "Petrogenesis of Luchuba and Wuchaba granitoids in western Qinling: geochronological and geochemical evidence",
        "abstract": "The West Qinling Orogenic Belt (WQOB) is a major portion of the Qinling-Dabie-Sulu Orogen and holds essential information for understanding the prolonged evolution of the northeastern branch of the Paleo-Tethys in East Asia. This study focuses on the petrogenesis of granitoids from Luchuba and Wuchaba plutons in the WQOB. We obtained zircon U-Pb ages of 211 \u00b1 1.4 Ma for the Luchuba pluton and 218.7 \u00b1 1.3 Ma for the Wuchaba pluton, which are the same as the proposed timing of continental collision at \u223c220 Ma. We thus interpret the granitoids to represent a magmatic response to the collision between the North China Craton (NCC) and the Yangtze Block (YB). The two plutons are metaluminous to weakly peraluminous I-type granitoids. Samples from the two plutons show strong light rare earth element (REEs) enrichment and weak heavy REE depletion, with varying negative Eu anomalies, which is most consistent with significant plagioclase fractionation although the possible effect of plagioclase as residual phase in the magma source region cannot be ruled out. In primitive mantle normalized multi-element variation diagrams, nearly all the samples show negative Nb, Ta, P and Ti anomalies and relative enrichment in Rb, Pb, U and K. These characteristics resemble those of the average continental crust. The Luchuba pluton has lower (87Sr/86Sr)i (0.7051 to 0.7104), higher eNd(t) (\u22128.11 to \u22125.73) and eHf(t) (\u22126.70 to \u22121.65) than mature continental crust ([87Sr/86Sr]i u003e 0.72, eNd(t) u003c \u221212). The Wuchaba pluton also has lower (87Sr/86Sr)i (0.7069 to 0.7080), higher eNd(t) (\u22129.86 to \u22123.34) and eHf(t) (\u22125.69 to 1.58) than mature continental crust. We conclude that the Luchuba and Wuchaba granitoids in the WQOB are best explained as resulting from fractional crystallization with crustal assimilation of parental magmas derived from melting of Mianlue oceanic crust under amphibolite facies conditions during the initial stage of continental collision between the North China Craton and the Yangtze Block. Mafic magmatic enclaves (MMEs) of Wuchaba pluton are earlier cumulates of the same magmatic system. The Mianlue oceanic crust (MORB-like) contributes to the source of the Luchuba and Wuchaba granitoids, pointing to the significance of melting of oceanic crust for continental crust accretion.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The East Kunlun Orogenic Belt (EKOB), an important part of the Greater Tibetan Plateau, is an ideal region for understanding the tectonic evolution of the Anyemaqen Ocean. Here, we present zircon U\u2013Pb ages, bulk-rock major and trace element analyses and Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Hf isotope compositions on representative samples of the syn-collisional Dulan batholith at the eastern end of the EKOB. The zircon U\u2013Pb age data indicate that the bulk of the Dulan batholith was emplaced at 240\u2013235\u00a0Ma. The granitoids have high- to medium-K and metaluminous characteristics. They are enriched in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs) and light rare earth elements (LREEs) and depleted in some high field strength elements (HFSEs, e.g., Nb and Ta), while having a flat heavy REE (HREEs) pattern. The mafic magmatic enclaves (MMEs) share the same age, mineralogy and indistinguishable Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Hf isotopes with their granitoid hosts except for the higher HREE abundances. We show that the MMEs represent cumulate formed at earlier stages of the same magmatic system. The trace element data (e.g., Nb/Th, Ta/U) and inherited mantle isotopic characteristics of the Dulan batholith are also consistent with an origin via partial melting of the last fragments of underthrusting ocean crust. Simple mass balance calculations using the Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Hf isotopic data show that ~\u00a085% Paleo-Tethys MORB and ~\u00a015% mature crustal material (the Proterozoic gneiss of the study area) contribute to the source of the granitoids. The Dulan batholith shows compositional similarities to the bulk continental curst with inherited mantle isotopic signatures. The syn-collisional felsic magmatism must have contributed to the net continental crust growth in the EKOB. We infer that the Kunlun and Qinling orogens may actually be one single orogen offset later by the Wenquan fault system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The abundant  syn -collisional granitoids produced and preserved at the northern Tibetan Plateau margin provide a prime case for studying the felsic magmatism as well as continental crust growth in response to continental collision. Here we present the results from a systematic study of the  syn -collisional granitoids and their mafic magmatic enclaves (MMEs) in the Laohushan (LHS) and Machangshan (MCS) plutons from the North Qilian Orogenic Belt (NQOB). Two types of MMEs from the LHS pluton exhibit identical crystallization age (~430\u202fMa) and bulk-rock isotopic compositions to their host granitoids, indicating their genetic link. The phase equilibrium constraints and pressure estimates for amphiboles from the LHS pluton together with the whole rock data suggest that the two types of MMEs represent two evolution products of the same hydrous andesitic magmas. In combination with the data on NQOB  syn -collisional granitoids elsewhere, we suggest that the syn-collisional granitoids in the NQOB are material evidence of melting of ocean crust and sediment. The remarkable compositional similarity between the LHS granitoids and the model bulk continental crust in terms of major elements, trace elements, and some key element ratios indicates that the  syn -collisional magmatism in the NQOB contributes to net continental crust growth, and that the way of continental crust growth in the Phanerozoic through syn-collisional felsic magmatism (production and preservation) is a straightforward process without the need of petrologically and physically complex processes.",

This recognition offers an unprecedented insight into the petrogenesis of both the adakitic host granodiorite and the enclosed MMEs. The  and their host granodiorites share many characteristics in common, including identical crystallization age (similar to 430 Ma), same mineralogy, similar mineral chemistry and whole-rock isotopic compositions, indicating their genetic link.

Subsequent replenishment of adakitic magmas could have disturbed the cumulate piles as MMEs dispersed in the adakitic granodiorite host during emplacement. The geochemical data and petrogenetic modeling of trace elements suggest that the QMS adakitic host granodiorite is most consistent with fractional crystallization dominated by the mineral assemblage of the MMEs. The parental magma for the QMS granodiorite is best explained as resulting from partial melting of the ocean crust together with recycled terrigenous sediments during continental collision, which may have also experienced interaction with mantle peridotite during ascent.

        "abstract": "The Caledonian-age Qilian Orogenic Belt at the northern margin of the Greater Tibetan Plateau comprises abundant granitoids that record the histories of the orogenesis. We report here our study of these granitoids from two localities. The Qingchengshan (QCS) pluton, which is situated in the eastern section of the Central Qilian Block, is dated at ~430\u2013420 Ma. It has high-K calc-alkaline composition with high SiO2 (u003e 70 wt%), enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs), depletion in high field strength elements (HFSEs), and varying degrees of negative Sr and Eu anomalies. The granitoids in the Tongwei (TW) area, 150 km east of the QCS, are complex, the majority of which are dated at ~440 Ma, but there also exist younger, ~230 Ma intrusions genetically associated with the Qinling Orogeny. The Paleozoic TW intrusions also have high SiO2, fractionated REE (rare earth element) patterns, but a negligible Eu anomaly. The whole rock Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions suggest that all these Paleozoic granitoids are consistent with melting-induced mixing of a two-component source, which is best interpreted as the combination of last fragments of subducted/subducting ocean crust with terrigenous sediments. The mantle isotopic signature of these granitoids (87Sr/86Sri: 0.7038 to 0.7100, eNd(t): \u22124.8 to \u22121.3, eHf(t): \u22120.7 to +4.0) reflects significant (~70 %) contribution of the ocean crust derived in no distant past from the mantle at ocean ridges with an inherited mantle isotopic signature. Partial melting of such ocean crust plus terrigenous sediments in response to the ocean closing and continental collision (between the Qilian and Alashan Blocks) under amphibolite facies conditions is responsible for the magmatism. Varying extents of fractional crystallization (\u00b1plagioclase, \u00b1amphibole, \u00b1garnet, \u00b1zircon) of the parental magmas produced the observed QCS and TW granitoids. We note that sample HTC12\u201301 in the TW area shows an A-type or highly fractionated granite signature characterized by elevated abundances and a flat pattern of REEs, weak Nb-Ta anomaly, conspicuous negative Sr and Eu anomalies (Sr/Sr* = 0.09, Eu/Eu* = 0.22), and thus the high 87Sr/86Sr ratio (0.7851), and moderate eNd(t) (\u22124.9) and eHf(t) (\u22122.0), pointing to the significant mantle contribution. Compared with the Paleozoic granitoids, the ~230 Ma granitoids in the TW area represented by sample JPC12\u201302 have higher initial 87Sr/86Sr (0.7073) and lower eNd(t) (\u22126.2) and eHf(t) (\u22124.5) values, offering an ideal opportunity for future studies on tectonic effects of juxtaposition of younger orogenesis on an older orogen.",

        "title": "Origin of the Jurassic-cretaceous intraplate granitoids in Eastern China as a consequence of paleo-Pacific plate subduction",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Jurassic-Cretaceous granitoids are widespread in eastern continental China and have been considered by many as resulting from paleo-Pacific subduction. However, the actual mechanism of their petrogenesis remains speculative. In order to address this important problem and on the basis of our regional study, we hypothesized that the coastal granitoids may result directly from the paleo-Pacific plate subduction, whereas the widespread granitoids in the continental interiors ultimately result from dehydration of the paleo-Pacific slab stagnated in the mantle transition zone ( Niu et al., 2015 ). Here, we present the very first study testing this hypothesis. We sampled 18 Jurassic-Cretaceous granitoid plutons along a ~ 1300\u202fkm long traverse parallel to the inferred paleo-Pacific subduction from the southeast coastline to the Xiaoqinling in the continental interiors and carried out a detailed study on these plutonic samples, including zircon U Pb geochronology, bulk-rock major and trace element compositions and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic characteristics. These plutons give varying zircon crystallization ages of ~146 to 100\u202fMa. They are mostly granitic and minor granodioritic, quartz monzonitic and syenitic in composition, enriched in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs), depleted in high field-strength elements (HFSEs) and have varying negative Sr and Eu anomalies. The plutons in the continental interiors show significant positive correlations of Nd (e Nd  (t)\u202f=\u202f\u221225.5 to \u221210.9) and Hf (e Hf  (t)\u202f=\u202f\u221231.5 to \u221211.3) isotopes with Pb isotopes ( 206 Pb/ 204 Pb (t)\u202f=\u202f15.827 to 17.622), with the enriched endmember characterized by low e Nd  (t), e Hf  (t) and  206 Pb/ 204 Pb (t). The plutons towards the coastal region have relatively high e Nd  (t) (\u22129.0 to \u22125.2), e Hf  (t) (\u221211.2 to \u22124.1) and  206 Pb/ 204 Pb (t) (18.051 to 18.349). The coastal granitoids are best explained as resulting directly from subduction slab dehydration induced mantle wedge melting and resultant crustal anatexis, whereas the interior granitoids are best interpreted as resulting from mature crustal anataxis caused by basaltic magmatism associated with mantle lithosphere thinning, ultimately triggered by dehydration of paleo-Pacific slab stagnant in the mantle transition zone.",

        "abstract": "The Qinling Orogen was a consequence of continental collision of the South China Craton with the North China Craton in the Triassic and caused widespread granitoid magmatism. However, the petrogenesis of these granitoids remains controversial. In this paper, we choose the Baijiazhuang (BJZ) and Lvjing (LJ) plutons in the West Qinling Orogen for a combined study of the zircon U-Pb geochronology, whole-rock major and trace element compositions and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic characteristics. We obtained zircon crystallization ages of similar to 216 Ma and similar to 212 Ma for the BJZ and the LJ plutons, respectively. The granitoid samples from both plutons have high K2O metaluminous to peraluminous compositions. They are enriched in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs), light rare earth elements (LREEs) and depleted in high field-strength elements (HFSEs) with significant negative Eu anomalies. The BJZ samples have initial Sr isotopic ratios of 0.7032 to 0.7078, epsilon(Nd)(t) of -10.99 to -8.54 and epsilon(Hf)(t) of -1022 to -6.41. The LJ granitoids have initial Sr isotopic ratios of 0.7070 to 0.7080, epsilon(Nd)(t) of -5.37 to -4.58 and epsilon(Hf)(t) of -3.64 to -1.78. The enriched isotopic characteristics of the two plutons are consistent with their source being dominated by ancient continental crust. However, two BJZ samples show depleted Sr isotope compositions, which may infer possible involvement of mantle materials. Mantle-derived melt, which formed from partial melting of mantle wedge peridotite facilitated by dehydration of the subducted/subducting Mianlue ocean crust, provide the required heat for the crustal melting while also contributing to the compositions of these granitoids. That is, the two granitic plutons are magmatic responses to the closure of the Mianlue ocean basin and the continental collision between the Yangtze and South Qinling crustal terranes.

        "abstract": "We analysed whole-rock major and trace elements and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopes of the late Cenozoic volcanic rocks in the Leizhou Peninsula, South China to investigate their mantle source characteristics. These volcanic rocks, collected from Jiujiang, Tianyang and Huoju areas of the Leizhou Peninsula, are characterized by incompatible element enrichment but variable isotopic depletion. The volcanic rocks from Jiujiang and Tianyang show prominent primitive-mantle-normalized positive Nb, Ta and Sr anomalies and depleted Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotope compositions, whereas those from Huoju show slight positive to negative Nb and Ta anomalies, a prominent positive Pb anomaly, and more enriched Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotope compositions. Two types of mantle metasomatism are required to explain the geochemical characteristics of these rocks. The Jiujiang and Tianyang samples were largely derived from a mantle source metasomatized recently by a low-F melt. Such low-F melt is generated within the asthenospheric mantle, which is enriched in volatiles and incompatible elements with positive Sr anomaly and depleted Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotope compositions. The Huoju samples were largely derived from a mantle source metasomatized by recycled upper continental crust material. These two types of mantle metasomatism beneath the Leizhou Peninsula are consistent with trace element characteristics of mantle mineralogy (e.g. clinopyroxene vs. amphibole), which reflects source evolution in space and time (e.g. tectonic setting change).",

        "abstract": "We present the results of our study on 16 Cretaceous granitoid plutons along the south\u2010east coast of continental China. The zircon U\u2013Pb ages and the bulk\u2010rock Rb\u2013Sr isochron age (R2 = 0.935) indicate that the granitoids represent the last episode of magmatism (119\u201392 Ma) associated with the paleo\u2010Pacific Plate subduction beneath continental China. These granitoids show large compositional variation that is to a first\u2010order consistent with varying extents of magma evolution, which is best expressed by a large SiO2/MgO range and correlated trends of SiO2/MgO with the abundances and ratios of major and trace elements. The correlated Nd (eNd(t) = \u22126.1 to \u22121.2) and Hf (eHf(t) = \u22124.7 to +3.4) isotopic variation reflects parental magma compositional differences as a result of varying sources and processes. The Nd\u2013Hf isotope data indicate that these granitoids were produced by mature continental crust melting with significant mantle input (~20\u201360%). Rhyolite\u2010MELTS modelling shows that relative to the less evolved (i.e., low SiO2/MgO) granitoid plutons, the progressively more evolved (i.e., varying larger SiO2/MgO) plutons can be explained by varying extents (~24% to 67%) of fractional crystallization. The origin of the magmas parental to the granitoids is best explained by a two\u2010stage process: (a) subducting slab dehydration\u2010induced mantle wedge melting for basaltic magmas and (b) ascent and underplating/intrusion of the basaltic magmas caused the mature crustal melting for the granitoid magmas. The systematic northward decrease in eNd(t) and eHf(t) suggests progressively more enriched crustal material towards the north, but it may very well indicate northward crustal thickening, permitting a greater extent of crustal assimilation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Laoshan granite is an example of the widespread intraplate granitoids of early Cretaceous age in eastern continental China. The petrogenesis of these granitoids remains in dispute and we choose the Laoshan granite as the representative case to study these granitoids. Zircons from the Laoshan granite give a crystallization age of ~120\u202fMa, which is consistent with the emplacement age of ~ 126\u202fMa given by the bulk-rock Rb-Sr isochron. Representative samples from the granite show a large range of major element compositional variation (e.g., SiO 2 /MgO\u202f=\u202f64 to 1937), reflecting a varying degree of fractional crystallization of plagioclase, alkali feldspar, amphibole, biotite and accessory phases as observed. The samples are enriched in light rare earth elements, Rb, Th and U, but depleted in Ba and Sr with negative Eu anomalies. The high  87 Sr/ 86 Sr (0.7083 to 1.2265) is largely caused by variably high Rb/Sr (~0.31 to 91 with an average of ~13) due to feldspar fractionation. The low  \u0190Nd (t) (\u221213.8 to \u221219.5), e Hf (t) (\u221214.6 to \u221224.4), and ( 206 Pb/ 204 Pb) i  (16.244 to 17.304) are consistent with significant contributions of the lower continental crust to magmas parental to the Laoshan granite. The origin of the parental magmas is best understood as resulting from anatexis of the lower crust (~20% \u2212 25% partial melting of the mafic granulite) triggered by and mixed with the underplating and intruding basaltic magmas. The basaltic magmas were likely derived from melting of the thinning lithosphere being transformed into the asthenosphere as the result of \u201cbasal hydration weakening\u201d with the water ultimately coming from dehydration of the stagnant paleo-Pacific slab in the mantle transition zone.",

        "title": "On the origin of mafic magmatic enclaves (MMEs) in syn-collisional granitoids: evidence from the Baojishan pluton in the North Qilian Orogen, China",
        "abstract": "Mafic magmatic enclaves (MMEs) are abundant in Baojishan syn-collisional granitoids located in the eastern section of the North Qilian Orogen. Zircon U-Pb ages of the host granodiorite (433.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4\u00a0Ma) and their MMEs (431.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8\u00a0Ma) are the same as the time of the Qilian ocean closing and continental collision at \u223c440\u2013420\u00a0Ma, indicating that the granitoids represent a magmatic response to the collision between the Qilian-Qaidam block and the Alashan block. The MMEs have the same mineralogy as the host granodiorite except that they are more abundant in mafic phases (e.g., amphibole and biotite) and thus have higher heavy rare earth element (HREE) abundances. Both the host granodiorite and the MMEs have light REE-enriched patterns and relatively flat HREE patterns (i.e., [Dy/Yb]N\u2009=\u20091\u20131.1). They are enriched in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs; e.g., Rb, K, Pb) and depleted in high field strength elements (HFSEs; e.g., Nb, Ta, Ti) and show a varying Sr anomaly (i.e., Sr/Sr*\u2009=\u20090.9\u20132.2) for the host and a negative Sr anomaly (i.e., Sr/Sr*\u2009=\u20090.4\u20130.6) for the MMEs. Both the host granodiorite and the MMEs have overlapping and indistinguishable Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions (87Sr/86Sr(i)\u2009=\u20090.7067\u20130.7082, \u03b5Nd(t)\u2009=\u2009\u22123.9\u2013\u22123.2, \u03b5Hf(t)\u2009=\u20091.0\u201314.7). The extremely high \u03b5Hf(t)\u2009=\u200914.7 of sample BJS12-06MME likely results from the calculation due to nugget effect of zircons because of the unexpectedly high Hf (3.53\u00a0ppm) and too high Zr (128\u00a0ppm). All these characteristics are fully consistent with the MMEs being of cumulate origin formed at earlier stages of the same magmatic systems rather than representing mantle melt required by the popular and alleged magma mixing model. The radiogenic Sr and unradiogenic Nd (\u03b5Nd(t) <0) indicate the contribution of mature continental crust, while variably radiogenic Hf (\u03b5Hf(t)\u2009>\u20090) for both the MMEs and their host granodiorite manifest the significant mantle input. The apparent decoupling between Nd and Hf isotopes are likely caused by partial melting of recycled terrigenous sediments and the remaining part of the North Qilian ocean crust under the amphibolite facies conditions during the collision.",

        "abstract": "Biodegradable and biocompatible elastomers (bioelastomers) could resemble the mechanical properties of extracellular matrix and soft tissues and, thus, are very useful for many biomedical applications. Despite significant advances, tunable bioelastomers with easy processing, facile biofunctionalization, and the ability to withstand a mechanically dynamic environment have remained elusive. Here, we reported new dynamic hydrogen-bond cross-linked PSeD-U bioelastomers possessing the aforementioned features by grafting 2-ureido-4[1H]-pyrimidinones (UPy) units with strong self-complementary quadruple hydrogen bonds to poly(sebacoyl diglyceride) (PSeD), a refined version of a widely used bioelastomer poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS). PSeD-U polymers exhibited stronger mechanical strength than their counterparts of chemically cross-linked PSeD and tunable elasticity by simply varying the content of UPy units. In addition to the good biocompatibility and biodegradability as seen in PSeD, PSeD-U showed fast self-healing (within 30 min) at mild conditions (60 \u00b0C) and could be readily processed at moderate temperature (90-100 \u00b0C) or with use of solvent casting at room temperature. Furthermore, the free hydroxyl groups of PSeD-U enabled facile functionalization, which was demonstrated by the modification of PSeD-U film with FITC as a model functional molecule. ",

        "abstract": "The development of bioactive soft materials that can guide cell behavior and have biomimetic mechanical properties is an active and challenging topic in regenerative medicine. A common strategy to create a bioactive soft material is the integration of biomacromolecules with polymers. However, limited by their complex structures and sensitivity to temperature and chemicals, it is relatively difficult to maintain the bioactivity of biomacromolecules during their preparation, storage, and application. Here, a new kind of bioactive soft material based on the molecular integration of metal ions and polymers is designed and exemplified by a hybrid of magnesium ion (Mg) and poly(glycerol-sebacate-maleate) (PGSM-Mg). Mg was firmly incorporated into PGSM molecules through a complexation interaction as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The PGSM matrix provided the soft nature and facile processing of the hybrid, which could serve as an injectable material and be fabricated into elastic porous three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds. The Mg immobilized in the PGSM chain conferred neuroactivity to the resultant hybrid. PGSM-Mg exhibited adequate biodegradability and a sustained release of Mg. PGSM-Mg 3D scaffolds promoted the adhesion and proliferation of Schwann cells (SCs) more effectively than poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffolds. Furthermore, SCs on PGSM-Mg scaffolds expressed significantly more neural specific genes than those on PLGA, PGS, and PGSM, including nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophic factor-3 (NTF3). All these results indicated that Mg immobilized through molecular integration could efficiently regulate the bioactivity of polymers. In view of the wide availability, diverse bioactivity, and high stability of metal ions, the strategy of molecular coupling of metal ions and polymers is expected to be a new general approach to construct bioactive soft materials. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Bioactive soft materials are designed on the basis of the molecular integration of metal ions and polymers. Immobilized metal ions offer a new way to endow bioactivity to polymers. Different from biomolecules such as proteins and genes, metal ions are quite stable and can resist harsh processing conditions. Further, the polymeric matrix provides the soft nature and facile processing of the hybrid. Different from stiff metal-containing inorganic materials, the hybrid is a biomimetic soft material and can be readily processed just like its polymer precursor under mild conditions. In view of the diversity of metal ions and polymers, this strategy is expected to be a new powerful and general approach to construct bioactive soft materials for a wide range of biomedical applications.",

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is critical for the stem cell niche as a physical support and is known to be able to maintain stem cell properties. In this study, the ECM derived from ADSCs was produced and termed the ADM. The ADM was demonstrated to markedly promote proliferation of bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSCs) and exhibited strongly osteogenic simulative effects in vitro. The results showed that alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, Alizarin red S (ARS) staining, osteogenic gene markers and proteins were significantly up-regulated. Next, we developed a poly(sebacoyl diglyceride) (PSeD) mesh scaffold coated with the ADM and evaluated its capacity to create an osteogenic microenvironment. BMSCs were cultured on the composite scaffolds and subjected to osteogenic differentiation in vitro. The results showed that the composite scaffolds facilitated the osteogenesis more than a simple PSeD scaffold. Then the PSeD/ADM scaffold seeded with BMSCs was used to repair critical-sized calvarial defects in rats, which significantly enhanced the reparative effects as confirmed via micro-CT, sequential fluorescent labeling and histological observation. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the ADM could promote both proliferation and osteogenesis of BMSCs, and the combination of ADM and PSeD synergistically stimulated bone formation, which may provide a novel scheme for bone regeneration.",

It is charming to transform CO2 to desirable, economical chemicals and materials. Poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) is an emerging CO2-based material. Herein, we report the design, synthesis and characterization of the reactive hot melt polyurethane adhesive (RHMPA) based on PPC polyol. The resultant RHMPAs exhibit good adhesion properties to multiple substrates including plastics (PC, PMMA, ABS) and metals (aluminium, steel), which is comparable to or even better than conventional RHMPAs prepared from petro-based polyol. Furthermore, the PPC-based RHMPAs have tunable mechanical properties, and are thermally stable in the typical working range of bonding process (up to 270 \u00b0C). The study is expected to expand the applications of PPC and provide a new type of CO2-based renewable and eco-friendly materials.",

Herein, a novel Cu(II)-dimethylglyoxime-urethane-complex-based polyurethane elastomer (Cu-DOU-CPU) with synergetic triple dynamic bonds is developed. Cu-DOU-CPU demonstrates the highest reported mechanical performance for self-healing elastomers at room temperature, with a tensile strength and toughness up to 14.8 MPa and 87.0 MJ m , respectively. Meanwhile, the Cu-DOU-CPU spontaneously self-heals at room temperature with an instant recovered tensile strength of 1.84 MPa and a continuously increased strength up to 13.8 MPa, surpassing the original strength of all other counterparts. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the coordination of Cu(II) plays a critical role in accelerating the reversible dissociation of dimethylglyoxime-urethane, which is important to the excellent performance of the self-healing elastomer. Application of this technology is demonstrated by a self-healable and stretchable circuit constructed from Cu-DOU-CPU.",

        "abstract": "Phosphorylated polymers are promising for bone regeneration because they may recapitulate the essence of the phosphorylated bone extracellular matrix (ECM) to build an instructive environment for bone formation. However, most of the existing synthetic phosphorylated polymers are not fully biodegradable; thus, they are not ideal for tissue engineering. Here, we designed and synthesized a new phosphorylated polymer, poly(sebacoyl diglyceride) phosphate (PSeD-P), based on the biodegradable osteoconductive backbone PSeD. To our knowledge, PSeD-P is the first polymer to integrate the osteoinductive moiety \u03b2-glycerol phosphate (\u03b2-GP). PSeD-P shows good biodegradability and can be readily fabricated on 3D porous scaffolds. It has a porous structure with interconnected macropores (75-150 \u03bcm) and extensive micropores (several microns). PSeD-P promotes the adhesion, proliferation, and maturation of osteoblasts more effectively than poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). Furthermore, PSeD-P induces a significantly higher expression of osteogenic biomarkers and ALP activity in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) compared to its non-phosphorylated precursor, PSeD. The level of improvement is comparable to free \u03b2-GP in culture medium. More importantly, without using \u03b2-GP, the typical mineralization promoter in osteogenic culture media, PSeD-P substantially induces the mineralization of the ECM in MSCs, which is totally absent using PSeD under identical culture conditions. PSeD-P provides a new strategy to integrate bioactive phosphates via\u03b2-GP into biomaterial, and has promise for bone regeneration applications. In addition, the synthetic method is versatile; both the backbone and the side phosphate groups could be readily tailored to generate a family of phosphorylated polymers for a wide range of biomedical applications.",

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing offers great potential to customize sophisticated constructs for a myriad of applications. However, many thermosets require long-term curing under harsh conditions, which is not compatible with rapid 3D printing processing. 3D printing of these thermosets remains a challenge. Here, we report a new strategy for direct 3D printing of various thermosets via readily available extrusion-based technology using sacrificial sodium chloride particles as a removable thickener for printing and a reinforcer for curing, exemplified by crosslinked polyester, polyurethane and epoxy resins. Specifically, the 3D constructs exhibited hierarchical and porous architectures, which are highly desired for many applications, including regenerative medicine, sensors, actuators, catalyst supports, and energy absorbers. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we 3D printed vapomechanical sensors and actuators featuring fast, large, robust, and gradient responsiveness, in addition to biodegradable scaffolds to promote vascularization and tissue ingrowth in vivo and elastic myocardial patches to efficiently treat myocardial infarction. We expect that this study will pave a new way to tailor sophisticated 3D structures of thermosets and will be very useful for diverse applications.",

However, the typical triggers of shape recovery such as heat, UV light, and electricity may be harmful to humans. Accordingly, water-responsive SMPs have become significant, especially for in vivo applications, due to the intrinsic biocompatibility and ready availability of water. However, the reported water-responsive SMPs are limited and relatively complicated. Here, we design a new water-responsive SMP, poly(butanetetrol fumarate) (PBF); the properties of PBF could be modulated by curing. The cured PBF scaffolds exhibited high shape recovery and fixity rates (>95%). PBF showed good biodegradability, and it could support the attachment, viability and alkaline phosphatase activity of osteoblasts. Furthermore, PBF could be readily functionalized via pendant hydroxyl groups, which was demonstrated by the immobilization and controlled release of bone morphogenetic protein 2. We expect that PBF will be useful for various biomedical applications including water-responsive scaffolds, sensors or actuators.",

The patterned PHMs possess a biomimetic three level vascular structure including a custom-made scalable 3D framework, interconnected microchannels and permeable walls with controllable micropores. The fabrication process can be adapted to various polymers and integrated with diverse matrices including hydrogels, particle leached porous scaffolds, electrospun nanofibers, and bacterial cellulose.

The numerical simulation performed by using a particle-based numerical method, Many-body Dissipative Particle Dynamics (MDPD), is adopted to observe the stick-slip motion of droplets driven by a constant body force. The fractions of two types of surfaces are varied from 0.3 to 0.7 to investigate their influence on stick-slip motion of droplets. The dynamic contact angles and the variation in distance Dfr between the front and the rear contact points are shown for different fractions.

The simulated results show that the droplets undergo a spontaneous uptake even for a non-wetting capillary. In contrast to the liquid in a reservoir in which the direction of liquid spontaneous movement in the capillary depends on the wettability, the moving direction of droplets in the capillary relies not only on the surface wettability but also the radius of the droplets. We give an explanation from the viewpoint of force balance. Our results demonstrate that capillary force could be used to drive liquid in microfluidics.",

The influences of Weber number ( We ) and fraction (    \u03a6   l  i  c         ratio of hydrophilic area to whole region) on dimensionless spreading diameter (D* ratio of spreading diameter to initial droplet diameter), dimensionless height (H* ratio of height of droplets to initial droplet diameter), advancing contact angle (   \u03b8     a  ) and receding contact angle (   \u03b8     r  ) are systematically analyzed. The simulated results show that larger  We  and      \u03a6   l  i  c       lead to larger spreading diameter, even overspreading. Particularly, the stick-slip motion of droplet during recoiling stage is found to be affected both by Weber number ( We ) and fraction (     \u03a6   l  i  c      ), which cannot be captured on homogenous surface. As a result, the stick-slip motion could be divided into two sub-stages during recoiling stage, which is novel to the situation involving droplet with fixed impact velocity. It provides an insight to understand the mechanism of stick-slip motion for droplet impingement on chemically heterogeneous surfaces.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The spontaneous wetting transition of droplet coalescence on immersed micropillared surfaces was investigated by using many-body dissipative particle dynamics (MDPD). The simulation results show that wetting states are influenced by both the interpillar spacing and intrinsic contact angle of surfaces during droplet coalescence. The overestimation of the contact angle by the Cassie equation was modified by introducing a penetration factor, and the energy analysis suggests that the spontaneous Wenzel-to-Cassie transition could be predicted from critical contact angles. For surfaces with small interpillar spacing and large intrinsic contact angle, the spontaneous Wenzel-to-Cassie transition occurs during droplet coalescence, irrespective of the size of the immersed area. The contact angle hysteresis was also studied, in which the droplet was driven on immersed micropillared surfaces. It was found that reducing interpillar spacing is a feasible option to maintain robust superhydrophobicity, and that it is possible to realize the spontaneous Wenzel-to-Cassie transition. Otherwise, larger interpillar spacing and larger size of the immersed region will result in longer contact lines pinned by pillars if the spontaneous Wenzel-to-Cassie transition fails to occur. Meanwhile, it leads to the weakening of droplet mobility during transportation. The outcomes demonstrate that appropriate geometrical structures and wettability properties should be taken into consideration in order to achieve robust superhydrophobicity and high efficiency of the droplet transportation.",

In the present study, a further numerical study on the penetration of a droplet into non-wetting capillaries is carried out by using many-body dissipative particle dynamics (MDPD). The simulation results show the outer (outside of the capillary) and inner (inside of the capillary) curvatures of the droplet can cause two Laplace pressures. The difference between these two pressures forms a net pushing force which directly drives the droplet flowing into the non-wetting capillary. We give a detailed analysis on how the outer and inner curvatures change during the penetration process. To further show the effect of the Laplace pressure difference on the droplet movement, we also simulate a new droplet/capillary/film system. In this system, the droplet and liquid film are placed at both ends of a prefilled capillary. It is very interesting to find that the droplet penetrates even faster in lyophobic capillaries over lyophilic ones, and the spontaneous penetration does not pose any wettability restriction which is different from previous study in literatures. The present work is expected to provide new ideas for designing microfluidics or nanofluidics devices by utilizing the driving force from the droplet itself.",

        "abstract": "Brain connectivity studies often refer to brain areas as graph nodes and connections between nodes as edges, and aim to identify neuropsychiatric phenotype-related connectivity patterns. When performing group-level brain connectivity alternation analyses, it is critical to model the dependence structure between multivariate connectivity edges to achieve accurate and efficient estimates of model parameters. However, specifying and estimating dependencies between connectivity edges presents formidable challenges because (i) the dimensionality of parameters in the covariance matrix is high (of the order of the fourth power of the number of nodes); (ii) the covariance between a pair of edges involves four nodes with spatial location information; and (iii) the dependence structure between edges can be related to unknown network topological structures. Existing methods for large covariance/precision matrix regularization and spatial closeness-based dependence structure specification/estimation models may not fully address the complexity and challenges. We develop a new Bayesian nonparametric model that unifies information from brain network areas (nodes), connectivity (edges), and covariance between edges by constructing the function of covariance matrix based on the underlying network topological structure. We perform parameter estimation using an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We apply our method to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 60 subjects of a schizophrenia study and simulated data to demonstrate the performance of our method.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive deficits contribute to functional disability in patients with schizophrenia and may be related to altered functional networks that serve cognition. We evaluated the integrity of major functional networks and assessed their role in supporting two cognitive functions affected in schizophrenia: processing speed (PS) and working memory (WM). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data, N = 261 patients and 327 controls, were aggregated from three independent cohorts and evaluated using Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta Analysis rsfMRI analysis pipeline. Meta- and mega-analyses were used to evaluate patient-control differences in functional connectivity (FC) measures. Canonical correlation analysis was used to study the association between cognitive deficits and FC measures. Patients showed consistent patterns of cognitive and resting-state FC (rsFC) deficits across three cohorts. Patient-control differences in rsFC calculated using seed-based and dual-regression approaches were consistent (Cohen's d: 0.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09 and 0.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08, p\u2009<\u200910 ). RsFC measures explained 12-17% of the individual variations in PS and WM in the full sample and in patients and controls separately, with the strongest correlations found in salience, auditory, somatosensory, and default-mode networks. The pattern of association between rsFC (within-network) and PS (r = .45, p = .07) and WM (r = .36, p = .16), and rsFC (between-network) and PS (r = .52, p = 8.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ) and WM (r = .47, p = .02), derived from multiple networks was related to effect size of patient-control differences in the functional networks. No association was detected between rsFC and current medication dose or psychosis ratings. Patients demonstrated significant reduction in several FC networks that may partially underlie some of the core neurocognitive deficits in schizophrenia. The strength of connectivity-cognition relationships in different networks was strongly associated with network's vulnerability to schizophrenia.",

Memory dysfunction has been shown to be related to altered brain glucose metabolism and brain insulin resistance in animal models and human studies of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, differences in brain glucose using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and blood Extracellular Vesicle (EV) biomarkers of neuronal insulin resistance (i.e. Akt and signaling effectors) between SZ and controls were investigated, as well as whether these measures were related to memory impairments. Neuronal insulin resistance biomarkers showed a trend for being lower in SZ compared to controls, and memory measures were lower in SZ compared to controls. Occipital cortex glucose was higher in SZ compared to controls indicating lower brain glucose utilization. Linear regression analyses revealed significant relationships between neuronal insulin resistance biomarkers, memory measures, and brain glucose. More specifically, p70S6K, an insulin signaling effector, was related to verbal learning and brain MRS glucose in the SZ group. For the first time, we show that memory impairments in SZ may be related to brain glucose and brain insulin resistance. These data suggest that brain insulin resistance may play a role in the pathophysiology of learning and memory dysfunction in SZ.",

        "abstract": "Interactions between features of high-dimensional biomedical data often exhibit complex and organized, yet latent, network topological structures. Estimating the non-sparse large covariance matrix of these high-dimensional biomedical data while preserving and recognizing the latent network topology are challenging. A two step procedure is proposed that first detects latent network topological structures from the sample correlation matrix by implementing new penalized optimization and then regularizes the covariance matrix by leveraging the detected network topological information. The network topology guided regularization can reduce false positive and false negative rates simultaneously because it allows edges to borrow strengths from each other precisely. Empirical data examples demonstrate that organized latent network topological structures widely exist in high-dimensional biomedical data across platforms and identifying these network structures can effectively improve estimating covariance matrix and understanding interactive relationships between biomedical features.",

Neuroimaging techniques provide noninvasive methods of investigating abnormal connectivity patterns in ASD. In the present study, we compare functional connectivity networks in people with ASD with those in typical controls, using neuroimaging data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) project. Specifically, we focus on the characteristics of intrinsic functional connectivity based on data collected by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Our aim was to identify disrupted brain connectivity patterns across all networks, instead of in individual edges, by using advanced statistical methods. Unlike many brain connectome studies, in which networks are prespecified before the edge connectivity in each network is compared between clinical groups, we detected the latent differentially expressed networks automatically. Our network-level analysis identified abnormal connectome networks that (i) included a high proportion of edges that were differentially expressed between people with ASD and typical controls; and (ii) showed highly-organized graph topology. These findings provide new insight into the study of the underlying neuropsychiatric mechanism of ASD.",

The massive biomedical data (e.g. gene expression or neuroimaging data) often include networks where features are correlated with each other, and thus the covariance matrix in a complex yet organized topology. Although, current large covariance matrix and precision matrix estimation methods using thresholding or shrinkage strategies could provide satisfactory overall covariance/precision matrix estimation, they are limited for automatic network/topology detection and network induced covariance matrix estimation. To fill the gap, we propose a new network induced covariance estimation method (NICE) to simultaneously detect highly correlated networks and estimate the covariance matrix by leveraging an adaptive and graph topology oriented thresholding strategy. The novel thresholding strategy can reduce both false positive and false negative discovery rates by using the whole graph topological information which allows edges to borrow with each other. Moreover, we propose a novel `quality and quantityu0027 objective function to shrink the covariance matrix towards a parsimonious model while retaining most of the information. Simulation study results show that our method outperform the competing thresholding and shrinkage methods. We further illustrate the application of our new method by analysis of a serum mass spectrometry proteomics data set.",

        "abstract": "Functional connectivity analysis using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has emerged as a powerful technique for investigating functional brain networks. The functional connectivity is often quantified by statistical metrics (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient), which may be affected by many image acquisition and preprocessing steps such as the head motion correction and the global signal regression. The appropriate quantification of the connectivity metrics is essential for meaningful and reproducible scientific findings. We propose a novel empirical Bayes method to normalize the functional brain connectivity metrics on a posterior probability scale. Moreover, the normalization function maps the original connectivity metrics to values between zero and one, which is well-suited for the graph theory based network analysis and avoids the information loss due to the (negative value) hard thresholding step. We apply the normalization method to a simulation study and the simulation results show that our normalization method effectively improves the robustness and reliability of the quantification of brain functional connectivity and provides more powerful group difference (biomarkers) detection. We illustrate our method on an analysis of a rs-fMRI dataset from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) study. ",

        "abstract": "Although people diagnosed with schizophrenia are known to have elevated risks of abuse and dependence for nicotine, alcohol, cocaine, and cannabis, it is less clear if schizophrenia is associated with higher rates of opioid use disorders compared to either the general population or individuals with other major psychiatric disorders. Here we examine a large publicly available database from substance abuse treatment centers to compare how frequently patients with schizophrenia report problems with heroin or other opioid drugs compared to other major drugs of abuse. For comparison, the pattern of substance abuse in schizophrenia is contrasted with individuals with major depression, bipolar disorder, and the entire sample of individuals seeking substance abuse treatment. We find that a significantly lower proportion of patients with schizophrenia are reported to have problems with heroin (5.1%) relative to the entire treatment population (18.2%). The schizophrenia sample also had a significantly lower proportion of individuals with a non-heroin opioid problem (7.2%) compared to the entire treatment population (14.8%), patients with depression (23%), and patients with bipolar disorder (17.3%). In contrast, the schizophrenia sample had significantly higher proportions of individuals with problems with alcohol, cocaine, and cannabis relative to the treatment population. Although these data do not allow conclusions on the relative rate of opioid addiction in schizophrenia compared to the general population, the results suggest a discrepancy in patterns of drug choice that may aid our understanding of schizophrenia and substance use comorbidity.",

Here, we report 3 patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent the ablative therapy with split-dose 18F-FDG fused PET/CT scans for early identification of residual tumors and follow-up evaluation of treatment.

        "abstract": "Background:  The high incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been perceived in post thoracic surgery patients. However, the significance of perioperative coagulation and fibrinolysis related parameters after lung surgery for VTE predicting is not clear. To investigate that, we conducted a prospective single center study. Methods:  A total of 111 patients undergoing lung surgery were enrolled in this study, included 52 primary lung cancer patients and 59 benign lung disease patients from July 2016 to March 2017. Preoperative and postoperative days 1, 3, and 5 coagulation and fibrinolysis related parameters were tested, including antithrombin (AT), fibrinogen degradation product (FDP), prothrombin time (PT), prothrombin time activity (PA), prothrombin time ratio (PR), international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), plasma fibrinogen (FBG), thrombin time (TT) and D-Dimer. The Doppler ultrasonography was performed before and after surgery for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) confirmation. Patients with new postoperative DVT, unexplained dyspnea, hemoptysis, chest pain, or high Caprini score (\u22659) were received further computer tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for pulmonary embolism (PE). We used the area under receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve to discriminate patients between those who developed VTE and those who did not. Single factor analysis was utilized to define risk factors associated with VTE. Results:  The overall incidence of VTE was 16.2% (18/111). The incidence of VTE in primary lung cancer patients was 23.1% (12/52), much higher than that in benign lung diseases 10.2% (6/59), but did not reach statistical significance (P=0.066). Among 18 VTE patients, 83.3% was DVT, 16.7% was DVT + PE and 72.2% was muscular veins of the calf thrombosis. D-Dimer was much higher in VTE group than that in non-VTE group preoperatively and at postoperative days 1, 3 (0.64\u00b10.24  vs . 0.33\u00b10.06, P=0.007; 3.14\u00b10.75  vs . 1.51\u00b10.09, P=0.005, and 1.88\u00b10.53  vs . 0.76\u00b10.05, P=0.001, respectively). And the ROC curve areas of preoperative and postoperative days 1, 3 of D-Dimer were 0.70, 0.71 and 0.74, respectively. And FDP was much higher in VTE group than that in non-VTE group at postoperative day 3 (6.78\u00b11.43  vs . 3.79\u00b10.15, P=0.004). But AT, PT, PA, PR, INR, APTT, FBG and TT there were no significantly difference.  Conclusions:  The overall incidence of VTE after lung surgery was 16.2%. The patients with preoperative high D-Dimer should receive VTE prophylaxis.",

        "abstract": "We performed a retrospective analysis to evaluate whether a postoperative chemotherapy selection method based on four tumoral gene expression tests would improve prognosis in patients with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after surgery.Between January 2007 and July 2011, 148 patients with stage IIIA NSCLC underwent radical lobectomy with four cycles of adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy. Forty-five patients had tailored treatment plans based on the results of tumoral gene expression tests. The tests consisted of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses to measure the messenger ribonucleic acid levels of the excision repair cross-complementing gene 1, ribonucleotide reductase Ml, type III \u03b2-tubulin, and thymidylate synthase genes in tumor tissues. One hundred and three patients received conventional chemotherapy. Disease responses were assessed after two cycles and every three months after the first four cycles of chemotherapy. The one and two-year survival rates and diesease-free survival (DFS) rates were recorded, and the adverse effects documented.The one and two-year DFS rates in the genetically tested group were better than those in the non-tested group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The two-year Kaplan-Meier DFS curve analysis results were significantly better in the genetically tested group (X(2) = 8.228, P = 0.004). The adverse effects during the treatments were not significantly different (P > 0.05) between the two groups.The chemotherapy selection method based on four tumoral gene expression tests demonstrated its feasibility to improve the efficacy of adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy and benefit stage IIIA NSCLC patients by yielding better DFS without increasing the adverse effects of chemotherapy.",

Eleven patients who were treated from July 2014 to December 2016 were included in this study. The mandibular angle was resected through the medial side of the mandible after BSSRO. The mandibular angle measurements of the patients changed significantly after surgery (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Unanticipated fractures and mandibular hematoma did not occur. Therefore, BSSRO combined with mandibular angle ostectomy through the medial side of the mandible can be used to safely and effectively correct facial deformity.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to describe the clinical features of different types of traumatic temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis. Seventy-one patients with 102 ankylosed joints were retrospectively reviewed and categorized into four groups according to the grades of severity: type I, non-bony ankylosis of the joint with almost-normal joint space; type II, lateral bony ankylosis marked by a normal joint space that coexists with a radiolucent line; type III, complete bony ankylosis of the joint characterized by only a radiolucent line; and type IV, extensive bony ankylosis without any radiolucent line. The period of ankylosis, maximal mouth opening (MMO), rate of complications, and histopathological changes were compared among groups. Intergroup comparison showed significant differences in the clinical features of MMO and the incidence of complications (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Younger trauma patients tended to develop more severe types of ankylosis than older patients. Additionally, long post-trauma periods were related to the development of severe ankylosis. MMO was highly negatively correlated with the severity of ankylosis. Significant differences were noted among the four types of ankylosis. Younger trauma patients with long post-trauma periods tended to develop more severe TMJ ankylosis, experience more complications, and face more challenges in treatment than older patients.",

        "abstract": "Symphyseal and parasymphyseal fractures and bilateral condylar fractures represent a pattern that is quite challenging to manage. This study evaluated the treatment outcomes of a group of patients who underwent surgery using miniplate fixation for anterior mandibular fractures.This retrospective case series study reviewed patients with bilateral condylar fractures and noncomminuted symphyseal and parasymphyseal fractures. The patients were surgically treated from 2008 to 2014 in the department of oral surgery. Evaluation of facial width control was considered the primary outcome variable, which consisted of clinical assessment and measurement of the lingual gap using computed tomography. Medical information was collected before surgery. Temporomandibular joint function and postoperative complications also were evaluated during follow-up. A paired sample t test was used for statistical analysis.Forty-five patients (37 male, 8 female; mean age, 34.8 \u00b1 14.5 yr; range, 16 to 74 yr) were included in this study. Lingual gaps measured before surgery (3.38 \u00b1 0.61 mm) and after surgery (0.64 \u00b1 0.14 mm) were significantly different (P < .001). No patient was rated as \"unsatisfactory\" after esthetic evaluation of facial width.For noncomminuted symphyseal and parasymphyseal fractures associated with bilateral condylar fractures, 2 2.0-mm miniplates with monocortical screws are stable and efficacious in controlling mandibular width when bilateral condylar fractures are anatomically reduced and stably fixated.",

This study investigated the protection of TFR against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury via cystathionine--lyase- (CSE-) produced HS mechanism. CSE mice and CSE-siRNA-transfected rat were used. Relaxation of cerebral basilar artery (CBA), HS, and CSE mRNA were measured. TFR significantly inhibited cerebral ischemia-reperfusion-induced abnormal neurological symptom and cerebral infarct in the normal rats and the CSE mice, but not in the CSE mice, and the inhibition was markedly attenuated in CSE-siRNA-transfected rat; TFR elicited a significant vasorelaxation in rat CBA, and the relaxation was markedly attenuated by removal of endothelium or CSE-siRNA transfection or coapplication of NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME and PGI synthase inhibitor Indo. CSE inhibitor PPG drastically inhibited TFR-evoked vasodilatation resistant to L-NAME and Indo in endothelium-intact rat CBA. TFR significantly increased CSE mRNA expression in rat CBA endothelial cells and HS production in rat endothelium-intact CBA. The increase of HS production resistant to L-NAME and Indo was abolished by PPG. Our data indicate that TFR has a protective effect against the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury via CSE-produced HS and endothelial NO and/or PGI to relax the cerebral artery.",

        "abstract": "SB-706375 is a selective receptor antagonist of human urotensin-II (hU-II), which can block the aorta contraction induced by hU-II in rats. The effect of SB-706375 on myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is unclear. The major objective of this study was to investigate whether SB-706375 has a protective effect on myocardial I/R injury in rats and explore its possible mechanisms. Isolated hearts of Adult Sprague-Dawley were perfused in a Langendorff apparatus, and haemodynamic parameters, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase-MB (CK-MB), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), RhoA, and the protein expressions of U-II receptor (UTR), receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3), Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) and Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) were assessed. We found that SB-706375 (1\u2009\u00d7\u200910 and 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00a0mol/L) significantly inhibited the changes of haemodynamic parameters and reduced LDH and CK-MB activities and also cTnI level in the coronary effluents in the heart subjected to myocardial I/R injury. Further experiments studies showed that SB-706375 obviously prevented myocardial I/R increased RhoA activity and UTR, RIP3, ROCK1, and ROCK2 protein expressions. ROCK inhibition abolished the improving effect of SB-706375 on myocardial I/R-induced haemodynamic change in the isolated perfused rat heart. These findings suggested that SB-706375 provides cardio-protection against I/R injury in isolated rats by blocking UTR-RhoA/ROCK-RIP3 pathway.",

        "abstract": "Spectrum sensing exploiting polarization has been identified as an effective method for improving detection performance. However, the optimal polarization-based sensing algorithm with an upper bound performance has yet to be developed. The polarization likelihood ratio test (PLRT) is derived using the Neyman\u2013Pearson theorem, resulting in an optimal detector with regard to the likelihood ratio. The best linear polarization processor or filter, i.e., the polarization matched filter (PMF), which processes the observed polarization data to provide the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the output of the filter, is also derived. Although the PLRT and the PMF provide an ideal upper bound on the performance of all detection methods that exploit polarization when likelihood functions or statistic parameters of likelihood functions are exactly known, their performance for realistic blind sensing remains unknown. Using the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) method, we formulate two practical polarization-based detectors, i.e., GLRT based on received electric-field vector (GLRT-EV) and GLRT of the   Stokes    subvector, according to the statistical distribution of observed data expressed as a received electric-field vector and a   Stokes   vector, respectively. The two GLRT detectors can serve as a practical bound when all statistical parameters are unknown. Theoretical and numerical simulation results of the detection performance for the proposed detectors are presented. Additionally, these polarization-based detectors were thoroughly tested via a realistic wireless regional area network. Our experimental results show that the GLRT-EV detector exhibits better performance than other polarization-based detectors in terms of sample complexity and computational complexity, which is particularly critical in real-time applications.",

        "abstract": "Polarization is an important property of electromagnetic waves. It has shown the great application potential in optical fiber, radar, and satellite communications, where polarization has been exploited to be a promising means of enhancing channel capacity. The existing research has shown that, in theory, it has great potential to sixfold the channel capacity by using six co-located orthogonally polarized electric and magnetic dipoles. Wireless communications exploits the electromagnetic medium, which is also intrinsically polarization-sensitive. In the past decades, wireless communications have mainly exploited the dimensions of time, frequency, and space, and most wireless channels, technologies, and applications have been devised without explicit consideration of polarization. To keep up with the recent exponentially growing network capacity, as such, leveraging polarization for wireless communications is a logical next step. However, exploiting polarization in wireless communications involves many challenges that differentiate it from conventional polarization applications in terms of optical fiber, radar, and satellite communications due to complex depolarization effects, restriction on additional gain offered, and limited degrees of freedom in the polarization domain. These challenges have inspired recent advances, particularly related to polarization channels, polarization technologies (such as polarization-based modulation, polarization-based signal sensing, polarization-based orthogonal transmission, and polarization-based filtering), and their applications to emerging communication scenarios including energy-efficient communications, cognitive radio networks, and in-band full-duplex transmission. This paper thoroughly surveys these recent advances and presents the state-of-the-art research progress on each aspect. Furthermore, open research issues and challenges are discussed in order to provide perspectives for future research directions.",

        "abstract": "Ultra-dense deployment of small cell networks is widely regarded as a key role to meet the increasing demand for huge capacity of wireless communication systems. Meanwhile, network densification will result in severe inter-cell interference and thus impair system performance. Traditional radio resource management schemes pay attention to interference mitigation through resource allocation in time, frequency, space, and power domains, or a mix of them. In this paper, polarization, an important and underutilized property of electromagnetic waves, is exploited as a novel means to enhance system capacity. We propose a multicell joint polarization, power and subcarrier allocation (MC-JPPSA) scheme to maximize system capacity through joint optimization of transmitting polarization states, power, and subcarriers with an iterative approach. Though the iterative solution is suboptimal, simulation results demonstrate that MC-JPPSA scheme can strike a balance between performance and complexity compared with the optimal exhaustive search. Furthermore, the proposed scheme outperforms traditional joint power and subcarrier allocation schemes by means of exploiting polarization in ultra-dense small cell networks.",

The poor estimated performance of sample covariance matrix leads to degradation of sensing performance. Therefore, based on Neyman-Pearson theorem, we propose two oracle approximating shrinkage estimator based cooperative spectrum sensing (OAS-CSS) algorithms by utilizing oracle approximating shrinkage (OAS) estimator which is more accurate compared with sample covariance matrix. First method is proposed in case of ideal noise and we derive the theoretical expressions of probability of false and threshold. In the latter method, non-ideal noise is considered whose variances are imbalanced. Simulations show that our proposed OAS-CSS detectors exhibit better performance than traditional detectors and existing high-dimensional detectors. Also, theoretical sensing performance results with respect to ideal noise show an excellent agreement with simulation results when sample dimension and sample size are large.",

        "abstract": "In order to reduce the pressure of licensed spectrum and improve the cellular network capacity, Long Term Evolution (LTE) in unlicensed spectrum (LTE-U) has attracted wide attention. However, there are many challenges to the heterogeneous network which is mainly formed by LTE-U and Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) in the 5GHz unlicensed band. For improving the utilization of the unlicensed band, spectrum sharing of cognitive radio (CR) is an effective solution. For CR users (CRs) which have no information about primary users (PUs), the detected signal may be LTE or Wi-Fi signal, and how to accurately recognize both will be a challenge. In this paper, a blind recognition method of signals is proposed in LTE-U and Wi-Fi heterogeneous cognitive networks, and the signal model based on third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) LTE and 802.11 Wi-Fi is considered. Without any prior information, the proposed method is based on the signal characteristic parameters which include the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) size, oversampling ratio and the number of effective subcarriers and these parameters are estimated based on autocorrelation and high order spectrum (HOS) properties of the signal. The blind recognition performance of the LTE and Wi-Fi signals is simulated versus different signal-to-noise ratio(SNR). Furthermore, simulation results show that the proposed method not only has better recognition performance, but also has lower complexity than the method based on eighth order statics and neural network classifier (EOS-NN).",

The terahertz RCAI method resolves target scatterers using the correlation processing of the modulated echoes and the reference signal matrix. This process is similar to the basic principle of RCI. To investigate the coding strategies of terahertz RCAI, this study derives three signal models describing operation with the coded aperture placed separately in the transmitting terminal and the receiving terminal and in both of them simultaneously. Furthermore, coding strategies are categorized according to coded-aperture placement and encoded signal, including amplitude modulation and phase modulation. In addition, qualitative and quantitative analysis methods are introduced to describe the resolving ability of terahertz RCAI. Numerical simulations are performed to analyze and compare the performance on different coding strategies. These analyses can provide constructive guidelines for the design of terahertz RCAI systems.",

In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional (3D) TCAI architecture based on single input multiple output (SIMO) technology, which can reduce the coding and sampling times sharply. The coded aperture applied in the proposed TCAI architecture loads either purposive or random phase modulation factor. In the transmitting process, the purposive phase modulation factor drives the terahertz beam to scan the divided 3D imaging cells. In the receiving process, the random phase modulation factor is adopted to modulate the terahertz wave to be spatiotemporally independent for high resolution. Considering human-scale targets, images of each 3D imaging cell are reconstructed one by one to decompose the global computational complexity, and then are synthesized together to obtain the complete high-resolution image. As for each imaging cell, the multi-resolution imaging method helps to reduce the computational burden on a large-scale reference-signal matrix. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture can achieve high-resolution imaging with much less time for 3D targets and has great potential in applications such as security screening, nondestructive detection, medical diagnosis, etc.",

        "abstract": "For synthetic aperture radars, it is difficult to achieve forward-looking and staring imaging with high resolution. Fortunately, terahertz coded-aperture imaging (TCAI), an advanced radar imaging technology, can solve this problem by producing various irradiation patterns with coded apertures. However, three-dimensional (3D) TCAI has two problems, including a heavy computational burden caused by a large-scale reference signal matrix, and poor resolving ability at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This paper proposes a 3D imaging method based on geometric measures (GMs), which can reduce the computational burden and achieve high-resolution imaging for low SNR targets. At extremely low SNRs, it is difficult to detect the range cells containing scattering information with an ordinary range profile. However, this difficulty can be overcome through GMs, which can enhance the useful signal and restrain the noise. By extracting useful data from the range profile, target information in different imaging cells can be simultaneously reconstructed. Thus, the computational complexity is distinctly reduced when the 3D image is obtained by combining reconstructed 2D imaging results. Based on the conventional TCAI (C-TCAI) model, we deduce and build a GM-based TCAI (GM-TCAI) model. Compared with C-TCAI, the experimental results demonstrate that GM-TCAI achieves a more impressive performance with regards to imaging ability and efficiency. Furthermore, GM-TCAI can be widely applied in close-range imaging fields, for instance, medical diagnosis, nondestructive detection, security screening, etc.",

        "abstract": "As a promising radar imaging technique, terahertz coded-aperture imaging (TCAI) can achieve high-resolution, forward-looking, and staring imaging by producing spatiotemporal independent signals with coded apertures. However, there are still two problems in three-dimensional (3D) TCAI. Firstly, the large-scale reference-signal matrix based on meshing the 3D imaging area creates a heavy computational burden, thus leading to unsatisfactory efficiency. Secondly, it is difficult to resolve the target under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose a 3D imaging method based on matched filtering (MF) and convolutional neural network (CNN), which can reduce the computational burden and achieve high-resolution imaging for low SNR targets. In terms of the frequency-hopping (FH) signal, the original echo is processed with MF. By extracting the processed echo in different spike pulses separately, targets in different imaging planes are reconstructed simultaneously to decompose the global computational complexity, and then are synthesized together to reconstruct the 3D target. Based on the conventional TCAI model, we deduce and build a new TCAI model based on MF. Furthermore, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to teach the MF-TCAI how to reconstruct the low SNR target better. The experimental results demonstrate that the MF-TCAI achieves impressive performance on imaging ability and efficiency under low SNR. Moreover, the MF-TCAI has learned to better resolve the low-SNR 3D target with the help of CNN. In summary, the proposed 3D TCAI can achieve: (1) low-SNR high-resolution imaging by using MF; (2) efficient 3D imaging by downsizing the large-scale reference-signal matrix; and (3) intelligent imaging with CNN. Therefore, the TCAI based on MF and CNN has great potential in applications such as security screening, nondestructive detection, medical diagnosis, etc.",

Frequency-domain (FD)-TCAI (FD-TCAI) is able to reduce the two problems only in a limited degree. Therefore, this paper first proposes a space-domain (SD)-TCAI (SD-TCAI) method, which achieves more effective and efficient 3-D imaging than FD-TCAI under low SNR. With correlation operation, SD-TCAI transforms the echo signals from frequency domain to space domain, where spike pulses appear in the target positions. According to different spike pulses, the 3-D imaging areas can be divided and reconstructed in parallel, and finally synthesized together to obtain the whole 3-D target. In this way, the computational burden is further reduced, leading to an improved SNR. In this paper, we build and present the imaging models and procedures of TD-TCAI, FD-TCAI, and SD-TCAI, respectively.

Three-dimensional (3D) TCAI relies mainly on the reference-signal matrix (RSM), the large size and poor accuracy of which reduce the computational efficiency and imaging ability, respectively. According to the previous research on TCAI, traditional TCAI cannot reduce the heavy computational burden while the improved TCAI achieve reconstructing the target parts of different ranges in parallel. However, large-sized RSM still accounts for the computational complexity of traditional TCAI and the improved TCAI. Therefore, this paper proposes a more efficient imaging method named back projection (BP)-TCAI (BP-TCAI). Referring to the basic principle of BP, BP-TCAI can not only divide the scattering information in different ranges but also project the range profiles into different imaging subareas. In this way, the target parts in different subareas can be reconstructed simultaneously to synthesize the whole 3D target and thus decomposes the computational complexity thoroughly. During the pulse compression and projection processes, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of BP-TCAI is also improved. This present the imaging method, model and procedures of traditional TCAI, the improved TCAI and the proposed BP-TCAI. Numerical experimental results prove BP-TCAI to be more effective and efficient than previous imaging methods of TCAI. Besides, BP-TCAI can also be seen as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging with coding technology. Therefore, BP-TCAI opens a future gate combining traditional SAR and coded-aperture imaging.",

We at first analyze and model the system architecture, derive the matrix imaging equation, and then study the phase retrieval techniques to reconstruct the original target with high resolution. Numerical experiments are performed and the results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the system complexity in the receiving process while maintaining high resolution imaging capability. Furthermore, the approach of using incoherent detection array instead of single detector is capable of decreasing the encoding and sampling times, and therefore helps to improve the imaging frame rate. In our future research, the method proposed in this paper will be experimentally tested and validated, and high-speed PTCAI at nearly real-time frame rates will be the main work.",

        "abstract": "The high resolution radar imaging has important applications in battlefield reconnaissance target detection and recognition et al.. Compared to microwave used in the conventional radar imaging, the terahertz wave has higher frequency and shorter wavelength and thus can provide larger absolute bandwidth. And the coded-aperture imaging is an expansion of the classic pinhole imaging, which has great applications in optical imaging. In this paper, we proposed a terahertz coded-aperture imaging technology with high resolution which can obtain the scattering coefficient of the target by modulating the amplitude and phase distribution of the terahertz wave. By analyzing the radiation pattern and the wave-front of the terahertz beam, we confirmed that random phase shifting can change the distribution of the wave-front to be fluctuant and generate various irradiation modes, which can provide the system with the potential for high resolution imaging and the possibility of coded-aperture imaging. To distinguish multiple scattering points in the beam, it is required that the radiation field is statistical independent in both time and space domain in one beam. After that, different targets irradiated by the seam beam will be scaled by variously distributed radiation field, and radiation echoes will contain the distinguishable information of the target distribution, which makes it possible to decouple and distinguish the target information. The more obvious spatial irrelevance the detecting signal is, the higher resolution the target cross-section imaging will be. By studying the mathematical model, we conducted a theoretic analysis of the imaging mechanism and solving method of terahertz coded-aperture imaging. And then, a simulation experiment was implemented and good results were finally obtained. The result shows that the larger range the phase shifts, the clearer image we can obtain, which proves the feasibility of high resolution imaging of the proposed method.",

Single-phase and two-phase flow pressure drop characteristics have been experimentally investigated in coiled tubes of inner diameters of 12.5\u202fmm and 14.5\u202fmm. The helical diameters of the helical coils are 180, 280 and 380\u202fmm and the system pressure range from 2 to 8\u202fMPa. The effects of flow and geometry parameters on two-phase frictional pressure drop multiplier are discussed. For flow parameters, the two-phase frictional pressure drop multiplier decreases with higher system pressure and is insensitive to mass flux and heat flux. For geometric parameters, the two-phase frictional pressure drop multiplier is insensitive to the curvature ratio under the investigated conditions. Comparison with correlations reported in the literature is performed. A single-phase friction factor correlation and a two-phase frictional pressure drop multiplier correlation for helical coils with small coil diameters at high pressure are proposed and give good agreements with the experimental data.",

The boiling heat transfer characteristics of helically coiled tubes are important to optimal design of helically coiled steam generators. In the present work, various experiments with helically coiled tubes are performed to investigate the boiling heat transfer characteristics at high pressure with water as the working medium. Six test sections are made of thin walled stainless steel tubes having inner diameters of 12.5\u202fmm and 14.5\u202fmm. The system pressure is varying from 2 to 8 MP. The effects of heat flux, mass flux and system pressure on boiling heat transfer behavior are discussed in detail. Increase in heat flux increases the subcooled boiling and saturated nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficient. However, heat flux has no influence on saturated convective boiling heat transfer coefficient. Mass flux increases the saturated convective boiling heat transfer coefficient. Increase in system pressure increases the subcooled boiling and saturated nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficient but decreases the saturated convective boiling heat transfer coefficient. For the investigated experimental conditions, the results show that the Baburajanu0027s correlation gives the best prediction in subcooled boiling region and the Gungor and Wintertonu0027s correlation predicts well with the experimental data in saturated boiling region. For the investigated experimental conditions, the results also indicate that the helically coiled tubes have similar performance of heat transfer in boiling regions compared with straight tubes.",

Experiment investigation of heat transfer characteristics of subcooled flow boiling in helical coils with different inner diameters and coil diameters was performed in the present paper. The rise angles of these helical coils were all 6 degrees. The system pressure was in the range of 1.8\u202fMPa and 7.8\u202fMPa, mass flux ranged between 300\u202fkg/(m 2 \u00b7s) and 1100\u202fkg/(m 2 \u00b7s), and heat flux varied from 100\u202fkW/m 2  to 450\u202fkW/m 2 .

Experimental investigations were performed in helical coils of 12.5 and 14.5\u202fmm inside diameters. The coil diameters were 180, 280 and 380\u202fmm. Experimental results were presented for the effects of flow parameters and geometric parameters, tube diameter and coil diameter, on dryout characteristics in helically coiled tubes. The results indicated that a partial dryout region exists because of the geometrical characteristics of the helically coiled tube, and secondary flow has great influence on critical dryout quality. For flow parameters, increase in mass flux increases dryout quality and increase in heat flux or system pressure decreases dryout quality. Dryout characteristics are also significantly influenced by the geometric parameters. The dryout quality increases with increasing hydraulic diameter and decreasing coil diameter. None of the available dryout correlations in the literature are able to predict the dryout quality well in helical coils with small coil diameters under the investigated experimental conditions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Post-dryout heat transfer for steam-water flow in helical coils is experimentally investigated. The inner diameters of the helical coils are 12.5\u202fmm and 14.5\u202fmm, and the coil diameters range from 180\u202fmm to 380\u202fmm. The experimental system pressure covers the range 2\u20138\u202fMP. The results indicate that the centrifugal force induced secondary flow has a great influence on post-dryout heat transfer in helical coils. In the low quality post-dryout region, because of the high redeposition rate induced by secondary flow, the heat transfer coefficient of helical coils is significantly higher than that of straight tubes. As the total droplet mass decreases with increasing quality, the heat transfer performance of helical coils decreases and continuously approaches that of straight tubes. In high quality post-dryout region, the bulk fluid in helical coils is closer to thermodynamic equilibrium state due to the secondary flow, and the heat transfer coefficient may be exceeded by straight tubes. For the effects of flow parameters, the post-dryout heat transfer performance decreases in heat flux and increases in mass flux. For system pressure, due to the change of the dominant heat transfer mechanism, the post-dryout heat transfer decreases in the low quality region but increases in the high quality region with increasing system pressure. Based on a detailed analysis of the effects of various dimensionless parameters, a new correlation containing a quality correction is proposed and provides good prediction accuracy.",

The present study aimed to examine the potential role of miRNA (miR)\u2011205\u20115p in the developmental process of colorectal cancer (CRC) through protein\u2011tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7). Initially, TargetScan was used to predict the miRNA target sites in the sequence of the PTK7 3'\u2011untranslated region. It was then found that the mRNA expression level of miR\u2011205\u20115p was lower in CRC cells, determined using reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, and there was a negative correlation between miR\u2011205\u20115p and PTK7 in CRC tissues. It was also found that miR\u2011205\u20115p regulated the gene transcription of PTK7, determined using a luciferase reporter assay. The results of RT\u2011qPCR and western blot analyses in human colorectal cancer revealed that miR\u2011205\u20115p suppressed the expression of PTK7. Finally, it was revealed that miR\u2011205\u20115p restricted the proliferation ability of CRC cells through inhibiting PTK7, which was determined using colony forming and 3\u2011(4,5\u2011dimethylthiazol\u20112\u2011yl)\u20112,5\u2011diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays. miR\u2011205\u20115p accelerated cell apoptosis through inhibiting PTK7, demonstrated using Annexin V\u2011FITC/propidium iodide staining. The results of a Transwell assay indicated that miR\u2011205\u20115p inhibited the migration and invasion abilities of CRC cells through inhibiting PTK7. Therefore, miR\u2011205\u20115p is involved in the proliferation, migration and invasion of CRC through inhibiting PTK7.",

Here, we proposed to develop a\u00a0lncRNA-based signature with a prognostic value for colorectal cancer (CRC) overall survival (OS). Through mining microarray datasets, we analyzed the lncRNA expression profiles of 122 patients with CRC from Gene Expression Omnibus. Associations between lncRNA and CRC OS were firstly evaluated through univariate Cox regression analysis. A random survival forest method was applied for further screening of the lncRNA signature, which resulted in eight lncRNAs, including PEG3-AS1, LOC100505715, MINCR, DBH-AS1, LINC00664, FAM224A, LOC642852, and LINC00662. Combination of the eight lncRNAs weighted by their multivariate Cox regression coefficients formed a prognostic signature, through which, we could divide the 122 patients with CRC into two subgroups with significantly different OS. Good robustness of the lncRNA signature's prognostic value was verified through an independent data set consisting of 55\u00a0patients with CRC. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis indicated the potential association between high prognostic value and oxygen metabolism-related processes. This result should indicate that lncRNAs could be a useful signature for CRC prognosis.",

Functional and pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs was carried out. Targets of the DEMs were identified. Overlaps between the DEGs and targets of DEMs were selected. The miRNA-mRNA regulatory network of these overlaps was constructed and visualized. The candidate genes selected were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. DEGs were identified and considered DEGs-1 and DEGs-2. A total of 584 genes in DEGs-1 and 527 genes in DEGs-2 were obtained, including 465 overlaps, and 44 DEMs were identified. The overlaps were enriched in 46 Gene Ontology terms and 19 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Moreover, 137 overlapped genes between targets of the DEMs and the 465 overlaps were obtained. The miRNA-mRNA regulating network of the 137 overlapped genes was constructed. Extracellular matrix-related proteins and pathways might play critical roles in the development of CRC. The quantitative real-time PCR results of the candidates were in agreement with the bioinformatics analysis. miR-128, miR-182, and miR-143 might be key miRNAs regulating cell proliferation and metastasis of CRC.",

Until recently, several meta-analysis studies have been conducted, and reported significant association between rs4939827 and CRC risk. However none of these studies evaluated the potential association between rs4939827 and CRC risk in Chinese population. In this study, we evaluated this association by a meta-analysis using 12077 samples including 5816 CRC cases and 6261 controls. In the end, we identified the T allele of rs4939827 to be significantly related with an increase CRC risk ( P =2.22E-05, OR=1.14, 95% CI 1.07-1.21) in Chinese population.",

        "abstract": "Purpose To develop a three-dimensional (3D) high-spatial-resolution time-efficient sequence for use in quantitative vessel wall T1 mapping. Materials and Methods A previously described sequence, simultaneous noncontrast angiography and intraplaque hemorrhage (SNAP) imaging, was extended by introducing 3D golden angle radial k-space sampling (GOAL-SNAP). Sliding window reconstruction was adopted to reconstruct images at different inversion delay times (different T1 contrasts) for voxelwise T1 fitting. Phantom studies were performed to test the accuracy of T1 mapping with GOAL-SNAP against a two-dimensional inversion recovery (IR) spin-echo (SE) sequence. In vivo studies were performed in six healthy volunteers (mean age, 27.8 years \u00b1 3.0 [standard deviation]; age range, 24-32 years; five male) and five patients with atherosclerosis (mean age, 66.4 years \u00b1 5.5; range, 60-73 years; five male) to compare T1 measurements between vessel wall sections (five per artery) with and without intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH). Statistical analyses included Pearson correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman analysis, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test with data permutation by subject. Results Phantom T1 measurements with GOAL-SNAP and IR SE sequences showed excellent correlation (R = 0.99), with a mean bias of -25.8 msec \u00b1 43.6 and a mean percentage error of 4.3% \u00b1 2.5. Minimum T1 was significantly different between sections with IPH and those without it (mean, 371 msec \u00b1 93 vs 944 msec \u00b1 120; P = .01). Estimated T1 of normal vessel wall and muscle were 1195 msec \u00b1 136 and 1117 msec \u00b1 153, respectively. Conclusion High-spatial-resolution (0.8 mm isotropic) time-efficient (5 minutes) vessel wall T1 mapping is achieved by using the GOAL-SNAP sequence. This sequence may yield more quantitative reproducible biomarkers with which to characterize IPH and monitor its progression.  RSNA, 2017.",

        "abstract": "Objective\u2014  Carotid intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) is associated with cardiovascular events. Calcification, which frequently accompanies IPH, may play a role in IPH occurrence. In this study, we aimed to investigate the associations between calcification characteristics and IPH in carotid plaques.  Approach and results\u2014  One hundred seventeen patients with cerebrovascular symptoms and carotid plaques detected by ultrasound were recruited and underwent multicontrast magnetic resonance imaging. Advanced carotid plaques with composition measured by magnetic resonance imaging were included in the analysis. Carotid calcifications were divided into the following categories: surface, mixed, and deep calcification. They were also classified into single and multiple calcifications according to quantity. Logistic regression models utilizing generalized estimating equations were performed to evaluate the relationship between calcification and IPH. Of 117 subjects, 85 with 142 plaques were included in the final analysis, whereas 32 were excluded because of lack of plaque compositions. Of the 142 plaques, 40 (28.2%) had IPH. Plaques with IPH showed greater prevalence of calcification than those without (87.5% versus 55.9%;  P =0.005). After adjusting for age, low-density lipoprotein, maximum wall thickness, and maximum soft plaque thickness, multiple calcifications (odd ratio, 10.1; 95% confidence interval, 3.3\u201330.4), surface calcification (odd ratio, 29.4; 95% confidence interval, 4.1\u2013210.8), and mixed calcifications (odd ratio, 27.9; 95% confidence interval, 7.3\u2013107.1) were found to be strongly associated with the presence of IPH (all  P   Conclusions\u2014  Surface calcification and multiple calcifications in carotid atherosclerotic plaques are independently associated with the presence of IPH, suggesting that both quantity and location of calcification may play important roles in the occurrence of IPH. These findings may provide novel insights for understanding mechanisms of IPH.",

However, the realization of near-infrared (NIR) organic nanowire lasers is always a big challenge due to the difficultly in fabrication of organic nanowires with diameters of \u2248100 nm and material issues such as low photoluminescence quantum efficiency in the red-NIR region. What is more, the achievement of wavelength-tunable OSSLs has also encountered enormous challenge. This study first demonstrates the 720 nm NIR lasing with a low lasing threshold of \u22481.4 \u00b5J cm\u22122 from the organic single-crystalline nanowires, which are self-assembled from small organic molecules of (E)-3-(4-(dimethylamino)-2-methoxyphenyl)-1-(1-hydroxynaphthalen-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one through a facile solution-phase growth method. Notably, these individual nanowiresu0027 Fabry\u2013Perot cavity can alternatively provide the red-NIR lasing action at 660 or 720 nm from the 0\u20131 or 0\u20132 radiative transition channels, and the single (660 or 720 nm)/dual-wavelength (660 and 720 nm) laser action can be achieved by modulating the length of these organic nanowires due to the intrinsic self-absorption. These easily-fabricated organic nanowires are natural laser sources, which offer considerable promise for coherent light devices integrated on the optics microchip.",

        "abstract": "Two bipolar emitters, deep blue phenanthroimidazole derivatives, PhImAc and PhImEn, were synthesized by incorporating the hole-transporting 9,9-dimethylacridan/9,9-diphenylacridan and electron transporting phenanthroimidazole moieties via D\u2013\u03c0\u2013A architecture. Both compounds feature Commission International de L\u2019Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of y u003c 0.08 as well as high photoluminescence quantum yields of 0.46 in thin films. Non-doped organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) with compounds PhImAc and PhImEn as the emitters were fabricated and exhibited narrow full-width at half-maximum values of 62 nm and 59 nm with the CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.07) and (0.15, 0.05), respectively, which is very close to the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) standard blue (0.14, 0.08). The device using the PhImAc emitter possesses a favorable maximum efficiency of 3.68% for external quantum efficiency (EQE). When the luminescence reaches 10\u2006000 cd m\u22122, only a slight roll-off in EQE was observed, i.e., maintaining at 3.01%. The CIEy coordinates of the device using the PhImEn emitter were among the smallest reported values of non-doped OLEDs. The excellent thermal stability of PhImAc/PhImEn and the balanced charge transfer performance of our devices demonstrate that both emitters could be alternative host materials in OLED applications. In addition, white organic light-emitting diodes were fabricated using PhImAc or PhImEn doped with indium phosphor (PO-01), and they showed maximum current efficiency of 19.2 cd m\u22122 and CIE coordinates of (0.34, 0.26). The results of this work have confirmed that the novel phenanthroimidazole\u2013acridine hybrids can not only be used as deep blue emitters, but also have the potential to be excellent hosts for other emitters.",

        "abstract": "Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) can enhance luminescent intensity in the solid-state by suppressing concentration quenching and exciton annihilation, while thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) can offer highly efficient luminescence by harvesting singlet and triplet excitons. High performance organic light-emitting diode (OLED) materials with simultaneous TADF and AIE features are in high demand. Herein, we proposed a rational molecular design that exhibits both features, i.e., aggregation-induced emission-delayed fluorescence (AIDF), and green to red fluorescence with high photoluminescence quantum yield (up to 87.4% in doped films). Two D\u2013A type emitters NAI\u2013BiFA and NAI\u2013PhBiFA are developed based on a central naphthalimide acceptor core and arylamine donor units. In comparison with NAI\u2013BiFA, NAI\u2013PhBiFA inserts the phenyl linker between the D and A units, forming a spatially twisted structure and resulting in a blue shift emission. While a non-doped OLED employing NAI\u2013PhBiFA as an orange emitter exhibited an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of only 1.39%, a doped OLED based on NAI\u2013PhBiFA demonstrated a remarkable improvement including a maximum EQE of 7.59%, a maximum current efficiency (CE) of 27.95 cd A\u22121 and a maximum power efficiency (PE) of 20.97 lm W\u22121. In addition, a host-free device employing NAI\u2013BiFA as an emitter achieved CIE (0.65, 0.34), which is very close to the National Television Standards Committeeu0027s (NTSC) standard red (0.67, 0.33). The high efficiencies and low roll-offs in both the doped or non-doped devices demonstrate that our molecular design strategy is highly promising for a variety of OLED applications.",

Based on this crystal direction-oriented asymmetric photon transport, these as-prepared 2D cocrystals have been demonstrated as a microscale optical logic gate with multiple input/out channels, which will offer potential applications as the 2D optical component for the integrated organic photonics.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we investigated whether the metabolic alteration of  (CAFs) occurs via miR-21 remodeling and the effect of this alteration on pancreatic cancer cells. CAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated and cultured. Glucose consumption and lactic acid production were tested, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), pyruvate kinase m2 (PKM2), and miR-21 expression were examined. The level of glycolysis in CAFs was determined after treatment with a miR-21 inhibitor. Primary miR-21-NC CAFs and miR-21-inhibitor CAFs were indirectly co-cultured with BxPc-3 , and the invasion capacity of these cells was determined. The aerobic oxidation index of cancer cells and the expression of succinodehydrogenase (SDH) and fumarate hydratase (FH) were assessed. Compared with NFs, CAFs showed enhanced glucose uptake capacity, lactic acid production, and elevated LDHA, PKM2, and miR-21 expression. After miR-21 inhibitor treatment, the extent of glycolysis in CAFs was reduced. After indirect co-culture with CAFs, oxidative phosphorylation and SDH, FH, and MCT expression increased in BxPc-3 cells. After co-culture with miR-21-inhibitor-CAFs, oxidative phosphorylation and invasion ability of the pancreatic cancer cells decreased. MiR-21 was involved in metabolic alteration of CAFs and affected the development of cancer cells. This metabolic alteration may be an important mechanism by which the microenvironment promotes tumor progression in a nonvascular manner.",

Currently, the exact mechanisms underlying EMT-MET conversion are unclear. In the present study, the mechanisms by which primary sites (hypoxic) and homing sites (normoxic or hyperoxic) participate in EMT-MET conversion were evaluated. Pancreatic cancer cells were grown under different oxygenation conditions. Cell morphology and epithelial (E)-cadherin and vimentin expression were examined. Transwell chambers were used to examine tumor invasiveness, and scratch assays were performed to examine cell migration. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were used to quantitate the mRNA and protein expression of E-cadherin, vimentin, Snail and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1. BxPc-3 and Panc-1 cells grown under hypoxic conditions demonstrated increased partial EMT, reduced E-cadherin expression, and increased vimentin expression, compared with cells grown under normoxic or hyperoxic conditions. Cells grown under hypoxic conditions also indicated increased migration and invasiveness. HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA and protein expression was increased in cells grown under hypoxic conditions. These changes were reversed when a specific inhibitor of the HIF-1\u03b1 receptor was used to block HIF-1\u03b1 signaling. Differences in oxygen concentration at primary sites and homing sites are important in the EMT-MET process, and the underlying mechanism may involve HIF-1\u03b1-Snail signaling.",

Using an indirect three-dimensional co-culture model, the morphological changes were observed by light microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy. The invasive and migration capacity of pancreatic cancer cells was determined by Transwell chamber migration assay or scratch assay. The mRNA and protein expression levels of E-cadherin, vimentin, and Gli1 were determined by RT-PCR and western blotting. Primary cultures of isolated CAF, NF, HSF showed satisfactory growth with active proliferation. Indirect co-culture with CAF, BxPc-3 and Panc-1 cells showed significant partial EMT, reduced E-cadherin expression, and enhanced vimentin expression as compared with the single culture and NF/HSF co-culture groups, with corresponding increases in migratory and invasive capacities. PCR and western blotting results showed that mRNA and protein expression levels of Gli1 in CAF and Snail in cancer cells were increased. This process could be reversed by inhibition of hedgehog (HH) signaling in CAF. In the tumor microenvironment, activation of CAF is the key event in mediating partial EMT, and its mechanism may be associated with paracrine action after activation of HH signaling in CAF.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the mechanism of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in promoting the invasion and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells in a non-vascular manner. We verified the original generation of isolated cultured CAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) based on the expression of \u03b1-SMA and vimentin, and we examined the cell glycolysis level through glucose consumption and lactate production experiments. The mRNA and protein expression of CAF glycolytic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase\u00a0m2, were examined by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. In\u00a0vitro culture first-generation pancreatic CAFs were collected and cultured together with pancreas cancer BxPc-3 and Panc-1 cells. Cell invasion and migration were assessed using a Transwell assay and scratch test, respectively. Mitochondrial activity was assessed by experimentally determining oxidative phosphorylation (OP) activity. The aerobic oxidation index of cancer cells was also examined. Succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase (FH), and monocarboxylate transporter\u00a01 (MCT1) expression were examined using an MCT1-specific inhibitor to remove 'tumor-stromal' metabolic coupling to observe the influence of cell interstices on pancreas cancer progression. First-generation isolated cultured CAFs and NFs both grew well, and showed active proliferation. Glucose absorption and lactate production were significantly enhanced in CAFs compared with that in NFs. PCR and western blotting showed that the lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase m2 mRNA and protein expression levels were increased in the CAFs. After indirect co-culture, OP was increased in the BxPc-3 and Panc-1 cells; correspondingly, succinate dehydrogenase, FH and MCT expression were increased. After the MCT1-specific inhibitor removed 'tumor-stromal' metabolic coupling, the migration and invasion abilities of the pancreatic cancer cells were decreased. Pancreatic CAFs can alter metabolism as well as communicate with and respond to cancer cell migration and invasion. This may be an important mechanism for promoting tumor progression in a non-vascular manner in the tumor microenvironment. The mechanism by which CAFs reshape metabolic transition requires further analysis.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the association of family history of malignant tumors with clinicopathological characteristics of colorectal cancer, and its effects on prognosis. We conducted a retrospective review of pathological and follow-up data of patients with colorectal cancer treated in our hospital from January 2010 to December 2015. Of 870 patients undergoing surgery, 737 received follow-up (84.7%). Among them, 192 (26.1%) were family history of malignant neoplasm-positive [MN-FH (+)] and 545 (73.9%) were family history of malignant neoplasm-negative [MN-FH (-)]. MN-FH (+) patients had earlier disease onset, smaller tumor diameter, lower rate of lymph node metastasis, and lower depth of invasion. There were significant differences in BMI between the groups (P<0.05) but no differences in sex or tumor differentiation grade (P>0.05). Rates of Her-2 and p53 protein expression in MN-FH (+) patients were 34.3 and 40.5%, respectively, compared with 22.2 and 26.3% in MN-FH (-) patients. In stage 3, significantly higher Her-2 and p53 protein expression rates were observed in MN-FH (+) than in MN-FH (-) patients. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization showed significantly higher Her-2 expression in MN-FH (+) than in MN-FH (-) patients. The 3 and 5-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and progression-free survival were significantly lower in MN-FH (+) than in MN-FH (-) patients (P<0.05). MN-FH (+) patients with colorectal cancer had earlier disease onset and smaller tumor area, lower invasion depth, a lower rate of lymph node metastasis, and earlier TNM tumor stage at diagnosis than MN-FH (-) patients. BMI value distribution significantly differed between groups. However, long-term prognosis was worse for MN-FH (+) than MN-FH (-) patients, suggesting that internal pathogenic genes play a more crucial role than external environmental factors in prognosis. Family history of tumors could be an independent prognostic factor for colon cancer.",

This paper firstly introduces the structure and deficiency of traditional monitoring system. Then, relying on high precision operating parameters collected by Phase Measurement Unit (PMU), an improved on-line monitoring method is proposed, which overcomes the obstacle of existing Wide Area Monitoring System (WAMS) in global analysis of low-frequency oscillation when processing multiple PMU data. This novel method improves the traditional info-exchange and accident-reaction structure between regional and central monitoring station, which assists in the synchronization of oscillation information and coordinated recognition of an accident. Besides, the real-time global identification of inter-area oscillation and coherency grouping are as well ameliorated on considering the geographical location and distance of PMU monitoring stations. This proposed method was applied in the analysis of the Turkish blackout happened on March 2015 which resulted in serious successive degradation of frequency in European power grid. Signals measured in representative monitoring stations with PMU equipment locating Continental Europe (CE) were used to establish detailed and global analysis of the accident, including the warning of oscillation, the propagation trend and the identification of the inter-area oscillations. Based on this practical application in on-line monitoring case, the effectiveness and sensitivity of the proposed method are discussed at the end of the paper.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of Smart Grid, urban distribution networks have greatly expanded, in which power cables have been widely used in many countries. Monitoring of power cables will increase reliability of supply and the integrity of the transmission system. Wireless Sensors Nodes (WSNs) are independent sensors which can sense and monitor certain parameters including temperature, humidity, load condition, etc., and then transmit the data collected wirelessly to a base station. Power to the WSNs is usually provided by batteries. However, batteries have a finite amount of energy and need replacement when exhausted, which is a great cost of manpower. This paper presents an improved approach based on electromagnetic induction to take energy from electromagnetic fields around 10kV three-core cables. The whole energy harvesting system is composed of three parts: energy-gaining coils, rectifier u0026 filter circuit, energy storage u0026 regulated output circuit. The performance of this methodology is evaluated under simulation using Ansoft u0026 Simplorer and laboratory tests. The results indicate that this proposed non-invasive energy harvester can collect energy from surrounding electromagnetic fields of three-core cables, and generate impulse power of tens to hundreds of milliwatts which can meet the requirements of WSNs. Key points of future work are highlighted at the end of paper.",

With increasing Sn doping concentration, the (SnxSb1\u2212x)2Se3 crystals exhibited a great improvement in electrical conductivity by several orders of magnitude thanks to the great increase of carrier concentration reaching almost 2 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22123. Compared to undoped Sb2Se3, the dark current density of a representative (Sn0.10Sb0.90)2Se3 increased by approximately 10 times and the photocurrent density with essentially visible illumination increased by approximately 14 times. In addition, the doped sample showed a faster, reversible and stable photoresponse.

However, low electrical conductivity (10\u20136 \u03a9\u20131\u00b7m\u20131 in bulk state) largely limits the extensive applications of Sb2Se3. By a hot-injection-based Sn/Sb substitution strategy, we prepare 1D Sb2\u2013xSnxSe3 microrods to further improve photodetecting performances of Sb2Se3 microrods. Phase and microstructural analysis revealed the formation of orthorhombic 1D Sb2\u2013xSnxSe3 microrods with the length of 20\u201330 \u03bcm. From Hall effect measurements and absorption spectra, the Sb2\u2013xSnxSe3 microrods were evidenced as a p-type semiconductor with a higher electrical conductivity (6.95 \u00d7 10\u20134 \u03a9\u20131\u00b7m\u20131) and a smaller band gap (0.97 eV) compared with Sb2Se3 microrods.

        "abstract": "Pristine Si is oxidized to insulative SiO when it comes in contact with air and water. Covering it with a protection layer inhibits passivation of Si and significantly improves its photoelectrochemical performance. In this study, TiO with gradient change of oxygen stoichiometry ratio (TiO) was designed as a protection layer and fabricated via a chemical vapour deposition process in Ar flow under 400\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min. The anaerobic atmosphere and short heating duration synergistically produced the ratio of O and Ti lower than two in the prepared film. XPS analysis suggested the existance of TiO only at the surface of TiO film and Ti and Ti appeared successively with the increase of distance to the surface. The first advantage of lower-valence-state Ti and oxygen deficiency was to inhibit the oxidation of Si and to reduce electric resistance of the interface and the protection layer. The second advantage was to create a defect energy level under the conduction band of TiO which provided the possibility for holes in the valence band of Si to be transferred to this defect level. This tunnel like transfer enhanced the photogenerated charge separation and redox ability of TiO\u2013Si which brought a 3.25 folds enhancements in photocurrent density compared to that of stoichiometric TiO\u2013Si at 0\u00a0V (SCE) under simulated sunlight.

        "title": "Carbon nanotubes-incorporated MIL-88B-Fe as highly efficient Fenton-like catalyst for degradation of organic pollutants",
        "abstract": "Iron-based metal organic frameworks have been verified to be efficient heterogeneous Fenton catalysts due to their open pore channels and highly uniform distribution of metallic centers. In these catalysts, however, the iron element is mainly in the form of Fe(III), which results in a process required to reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II) to initiate Fenton reaction. To address this problem, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with electron-rich oxygen-functional groups on the surface were incorporated into the metal organic frameworks (MIL-88B-Fe) to improve Fe(II) content for an enhanced Fenton-like performance. The prepared CNT@MIL-88B-Fe (C@M) showed much stronger catalytic ability toward H2O2 than MIL-88B-Fe. The pseudo-first-order kinetic constant for phenol degradation by C@M (0.32 min\u20131) was about 7 times that of MIL-88B-Fe, and even higher than or comparable to the values of reported heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts. Moreover, the Fenton-like system could effectively degrade various kinds of refractory organic pollutants and exhibited excellent catalytic activity over a wide pH range (4\u20139). XPS analysis confirmed that Fe(II) content of the catalyst gradually increased with CNT loadings. Electron spin resonance analysis showed that the signal intensity (\u2022OH) of C@M was much higher than MIL-88B-Fe, which was consistent with the degradation efficiency of pollutants. Furthermore, the Fe(II) content of the catalyst gradually increased along with the oxygen-functional group content of CNTs. The result demonstrated that oxygen-containing functional groups of CNTs have a significant impact on the enhanced catalytic performance of C@M. This study provides a new insight to enhance Fenton reaction by using nanocarbon materials.",

        "abstract": "The spontaneous oxidation process of pristine silicon (Si) limits its application as photocatalyst or electrode in aqueous solution or moist air. Covering a protection layer on Si surface is an effective approach to overcome this disadvantage. In this paper, \u03b1-Fe2O3 is demonstrated to be an excellent alternative as a protection material. \u03b1-Fe2O3 layer was deposited around each p-type Si micropillar (SiMP) in well-ordered array by chemical bath deposition method. The diameter of SiMP was 5 mm and the thickness of \u03b1-Fe2O3 layer was about 20 nm. The photoeletrochemical stability of SiMP/\u03b1-Fe2O3 was proved by 10 circles cyclic voltammetry testing. Compared with SiMP, its optical absorption and photocurrent density improved 2 times and 4 times, respectively, and its onset potential for hydrogen evolution moved positively about 0.4 V. These improved performances could be ascribed to the enhanced photogenerated-charge-separation efficiency deriving from built-in electric field at the interface between Si and \u03b1-Fe2O3. The above results show an effective strategy to utilize Si material as photocatalyst or electrode in aqueous solution or moist air.",

This study included 4 young children with type IIB and type III hemifacial microsomia treated with CCG to reconstruct the condyle at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery in our hospital from March 2008 to March 2014. Radiographic measurements and clinical examinations were conducted. The mean age of patients at operation was 3.8 years, ranging from 2.8 to 5.3 years. The mean follow-up period was 43.5 months, ranging from 23 to 63 months. Functional improvement was observed in all patients. The ribs had grown in all patients to date. Three patients had clinically improved face appearance with no significant chin point deviation and canting of the occlusal plane. Although the other patient had partly improved face appearance compared with preoperative condition, he still showed clinically significant facial asymmetry and chin deviation. Our results showed that condylar reconstruction with CCG is a feasible method in the treatment of type IIB and type III hemifacial microsomia in young children. These results will provide early preliminary suggestions of growth and stability of CCG in patients <5 years.",

        "abstract": "This study evaluated the differences in the facial morphological characteristics of female patients exhibiting skeletal class II deformity with and without temporomandibular joint osteoarthrosis.Eighty-three female patients with skeletal class II deformity were included in this study; these patients were classified into three groups on the basis of the condylar features shown in cone-beam computed tomography scans: normal group, indeterminate for osteoarthrosis group, and osteoarthrosis group. The cephalometric differences among the three groups were evaluated through one-way ANOVA.Of the 83 patients, 52.4% were diagnosed with osteoarthrosis, as indicated by the changes in the condylar osseous component. The cephalometric measurements that represented skeletal characteristics, including mandibular position relative to the cranial base, mandibular plane angle (MP-SN), posterior facial height (S-Go), and facial height ratio, were significantly different among the three groups (p < 0.05). The patients in the osteoarthrosis group yielded the smallest S-Go, the highest MP-SN, and the most retruded mandible.Temporomandibular joint osteoarthrosis is commonly observed in female patients with skeletal class II deformity. The morphological characteristics of the facial skeleton in patients with bilateral condylar osteoarthrosis may be altered.",

Shaking tests are commonly performed on shaking tables, which are generally used for small motion ranges and are usually financially costly. The research is required to generate shaking motions in three translational directions for a specimen for shaking tests, but it also needs to produce 6-degree of freedom (DOF) motions with large motion ranges. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 A hydraulic 6-DOF (degree of freedom) parallel manipulator is applied to achieve this goal. The link-space control is adopted for the manipulator, and PID controller and feed-forward controller are used for each loop of the system. A hybrid reference signal generator is proposed by using a shaking controller, which is developed to convert the shaking motion into position signal. The converted result is directly added to the pose signal. The whole real-time control system is realized by using MATLAB xPC Target. Findings \u2013 The d...",

Optimization is achieved by each particle\u2019s movement, updated by its local best-known position and global best-known position according to a fitness function, which itself is a function of the estimation error between the identified acceleration and the original acceleration response.

To successfully achieve the task in practical applications, the positioning accuracy of the robot is an important issue to be considered. Based on the kinematic model using Denavit-Hartenberg method, the matrix differential method is applied here to establish the static position and orientation error model. The impact of parameter errors upon the static pose error of the uncoupling manipulator is analysed. The flexibility of the robot's key components is taken into consideration to analyse its impact on the position and orientation error of the manipulator. The position and orientation error compensation is developed by using input motion planning method to improve the pose accuracy of the robot. Additional motions are added to each joint of the robot such that the uncoupling manipulator can generate a corresponding tiny perturbation, which is used to eliminate the positioning error, ensuring the uncoupling action is completed successfully.",

Upon near-infrared light irradiation, the upconversion fluorescence can induce the hydrophobic spiropyran to be isomerized to the hydrophilic merocyanine and disrupt the spherical morphology of the nanocomposites. Meanwhile, at low pH, the hydrophobic spiropyran can be also protonated to become hydrophilic merocyanine, and the self-assemblies are swollen. Model molecules, hydrophobic Coumarin 102, are demonstrated to be released from the nanocomposites triggered by the near-infrared light and acidic pH.

        "abstract": "Here a novel photo, pH, and redox triple-responsive nanogel of poly(acrylic acid-co-spiropyran methacrylate) crosslinked by disulfide-containing N,N-bis(acryloyl)cystamine was prepared. Upon UV light irradiation or at low pH, the hydrophobic spiropyran (SP) isomerized to the hydrophilic merocyanine (MC) and the nanogels swelled-up. Upon the addition of reductant agents, the nanogels were disrupted due to the oxidative scission of the disulfide crosslinkers. The anticancer drug doxorubicin (Dox) could be loaded into the nanogels based on electrostatic interactions with the acrylic acids on the NGs, which would be released upon the stimulation of light, pH and DTT. The in vitro cytotoxicity study indicates that the nanogels loaded with anticancer drugs could kill the cancer cells effectively and the effect would be enhanced when irradiated by UV light. Interestingly, the isomerized MC in nanogels could emit intensive green light even endocytosed into the nucleus of the cancer cells, which afforded great potential in fluorescence cell imaging.",

        "abstract": "A novel visible light responsive polymeric multilayer was constructed by layer-by-layer (LbL) electrostatic self-assembly, from which the trapping/release of cargoes via azobenzene/cyclodextrin-based host\u2013guest interactions could be realized upon light stimulation. Visible light responsive poly{6-[(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)azo-4-(2\u2032,6\u2032 dimethoxy)phenoxy]propyl dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate-random-poly(2-(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl) methacrylate)} (Azo-PDMAEMA) was synthesized, which was used as a polycation to combine with polyacrylic acid (PAA) for the construction of multilayers through the LbL electrostatic self-assembly technique. The cargo molecules, cyclodextrins modified with rhodamine B, could be loaded into the multilayers via the interaction between the trans azobenzene and cyclodextrin. Green light would induce isomerization of azobenzene from the trans-configuration to the cis, which disassembled the host\u2013guest complex and resulted in the release of cargoes from the multilayers. Upon blue light irradiation, the cis azobenzene could recover to the trans form, thus a stable inclusion complex would be formed and the cargoes could be reloaded into the multilayers again. It is noted that the visible-light-controlled trapping/release of cargoes from the multilayers could be reconstructed reliably and conveniently. The electrostatically self-assembled multilayers of the prepared azobenzene-functionalized polymers combined with cyclodextrin show great potential in reversible trapping and release of cargoes controlled by visible light.",

In aqueous solution, the synthesized copolymer P(DMAEMA-SP) could self-assemble into polymeric nanoparticles. The spiropyran-quaternized segments endow the system with UV and visible light responsiveness and un-quaternized segments of PDMAEMA endow the system with temperature and pH responsiveness. Multiple stimuli-triggered morphological changes of the polymeric nanoparticles were revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The controlled release of hydrophobic dyes from the polymeric nanoparticles under the stimulation of UV light, temperature and pH could be realized. When the stimuli such as pH and UV light were synergistically applied, the release efficiency of encapsulated molecules would be enhanced greatly. The multiple stimuli-responsive self-assembled polymeric nanoparticles show promising potential as new nanocarriers for precisely controlled release of encapsulated molecules.",

It is noted that the azobenzene functionalized polycations show strong antibacterial activities, while the polyanions show excellent bioadhesive properties, as can be switched through the alternate assembly upon visible-light irradiation.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have become a promising therapy for cartilage damage and diseases due to the advantages of easy separation, high proliferative potentiality, and genetic stability. Synovium-derived MSCs (SMSCs) have been recognized as an ideal source for cartilage repair. In our previous study, we found that Sox4 promoted proliferation and chondrogenesis of SMSCs through upregulation of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) DANCR. However, the exact molecular mechanism by which DANCR promotes proliferation and chondrogenesis of SMSCs remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effect of lncRNA DANCR on the proliferation and chondrogenesis of SMSCs. We found that overexpression of DANCR could promote proliferation and chondrogenesis of SMSCs, while knockdown of DANCR had the opposite effect. Moreover, our data demonstrated that DANCR directly interacted with myc, Smad3, and STAT3 mRNA to regulate their stability. Finally, we found that the promotion of SMSC proliferation induced by DANCR depended on myc. Also, DANCR activated chondrogenesis of SMSCs via upregulation of Smad3 and STAT3 expression. Our growing knowledge of the role of DANCR is pointing toward its potential use as a novel therapeutic approach for cartilage damage and diseases.",

        "abstract": "Background/Aims: The bradykinin B2 receptor (BDKRB2) +9/-9 gene polymorphisms have been shown to be associated with the susceptibility and severity of osteoarthritis (OA); however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we investigated the correlation between the BDKRB2 +9/-9 polymorphisms and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in OA and the molecular mechanisms involved. Methods: A total of 156 patients with primary knee OA and 121 healthy controls were enrolled. The BDKRB2 +9/-9 polymorphisms were genotyped. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 levels were determined using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-4 mRNA levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The basal and bradykinin-stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in human OA synoviocytes and the involvement of TLR-2 and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were investigated. Results: The presence of -9 bp genotype is associated with higher TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8 levels and higher TLR-2 expression in OA patients. The basal and bradykinin-induced TLR-2 expressions in human OA synoviocytes were significantly reduced by specific inhibitors of p38, JNK1/2, and ERK1/2. Both the B2 receptor antagonist MEN16132 and TLR-2 silencing inhibited IL-6 and IL-8 secretion in human OA synoviocytes. Conclusion: The data suggested that the BDKRB2 +9/-9 polymorphisms influence pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in knee osteoarthritis by altering TLR-2 expression.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Implant-related bacterial infection is one of the most severe postoperative complications in orthopedic or dental surgery. In this context, from the perspective of surface modification, increasing efforts have been made to enhance the antibacterial capability of titanium surface. In this work, a hierarchical hybrid surface architecture was firstly constructed on titanium surface by two-step strategy of acid etching and H 2 O 2  aging. Then silver nanoparticles were firmly immobilized on the hierarchical surface by ion implantation, showing no detectable release of silver ions from surface. The designed titanium surface showed good bioactivity. More importantly, this elaborately designed titanium surface can effectively inactivate the adherent  S. aureus  on surface by virtue of a contact-killing mode. Meanwhile, the designed titanium surface can significantly facilitate the initial adhesion and spreading behaviors of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on titanium. The results suggested that, the elaborately designed titanium surface might own a cell-favoring ability that can help mammalian cells win the initial adhesion race against bacteria. We hope the present study can provide a new insight for the better understanding and designing of antimicrobial titanium surface, and pave the way to satisfying clinical requirements.",

Synovium-derived (SMSCs) have been recently recognized as an excellent source. SRY-related HMG-box (Sox) family plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of SMSCs. However, the role of Sox4 in human SMSCs remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated the role of Sox4 in SMSCs through gain-of-function studies and found that Sox4 promoted cell proliferation and chondrogenesis. Furthermore, Sox4 could directly bind to the promoter of long noncoding RNA DANCR and increased its expression. Finally, knockdown of DANCR could reverse the stimulative effect of Sox4 on the proliferation and chondrogenesis of SMSCs. Taken together, our data highlights the pivotal role of Sox4 in the proliferation and differentiation of SMSCs.",

A TLR4 extracellular gene fragment was cloned into the pET32a plasmid to determine its expression in  and purification. A dialysis labeling method was used to stain HBD-3 with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). FITC-HBD-3 was used to induce the differentiation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) into immature dendritic cells (imDC) . Binding reactions were established using FITC-HBD-3 and sTLR4 into cell suspensions. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to analyze the results. Western blot analysis confirmed the identity of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and was used to quantify its nuclear translocation. The results showed that, HBD-3 bound to imDC in a Ca-dependent manner, and sTLR4 and LPS competitively inhibited the binding. HBD-3 competitively blocked the binding of LPS and imDC by binding to imDC. HBD-3 significantly decreased the translocation of LPS-induced NF-\u03baB into the nucleus. In conclusion, HBD-3 can competitively inhibit the binding of LPS and imDC through its binding to TLR4 molecules, which are expressed in imDC, thereby preventing LPS from inducing the maturity of the imDCs.",

Healthy adult male Sprague-Dawley rats with average weight of 230 g were selected to construct the infection model of MRSA-induced implant drug-resistant bacteria biofilm in the mouse left tibial bone marrow. The drugs were intraperitoneally injected after 24 h medullary cavity infection, and the experimental groups included the model group, HBD-3 group, and vancomycin group (20 rats in each group). The model group was injected with 10 ml saline, HBD-3 group was injected with 10 ml of 8 \u00b5g/ml (1 MIC) and vancomycin group was injected with 10 ml of 0.5 \u00b5g/ml (1 MIC), five animals in each group were sacrificed on the 1, 7, 14 and 21 days, respectively. Observation was carried out on whether there was swelling and purulent secretion on the local wound; 1 ml venous sinus blood of eye socket was collected for blood routine examination and blood culture, and the laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to observe the morphology of the biofilm on the implant surface and the number of viable bacteria. Immunohistochemical staining was adopted to test the expression of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), and ELISA method was used to test interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), IL-1\u03b1 and interferon-\u03b3 (INF-\u03b3)-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) expression levels. There was no death due to infection in the HBD-3 group or vancomycin group, 1 case with significant wound swelling was found, respectively, in each group, but there was no purulent secretion. The percentage of the total white blood cells and neutrophil granulocytes as well as the biofilm morphology and the number of viable bacteria in the model group was gradually increased with time, while those in the HBD-3 group and vancomycin group were decreased with time. The comparative difference among groups was statistically significant (P<0.05); those in the HBD-3 group and vancomycin group at each time-point was decreased significantly compared with the model group, and the difference among groups was statistically significant (P<0.05), but in terms of the comparison between the HBD-3 group and vancomycin group, the difference was not significantly different (P>0.05). The NF-\u03baB and TLR-4 expressions in the model group and vancomycin group were not significantly changed at each time-point, those in the HBD-3 group began to increase on the 1st day, and reached the peak on the 7th day and began to decline on the 14th day, and the comparative difference at each time-point was statistically significant (P<0.05); those in the HBD-3 group were significantly higher than the model group and vancomycin group at each time-point and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, and IP-10 expressions in the model group at each time were significantly higher than the other two groups and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05); in terms of the comparison between the HBD-3 group and vancomycin group, the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05).

        "abstract": "Two kinds of possible movements of droplets (i.e., following or against the topographic wettability gradient) on a micropatterned surface are investigated by using a particle-based method: many-body dissipative particle dynamics (MDPD). The displacement along the wettability gradient and contact angles on both sides of the droplet are analyzed. The results show that the migration trajectory of the droplet is determined by the coexistence of Cassie and Wenzel states and the unbalanced Young\u2019s force, which are related to the impact velocity, pillar height, and surface tension. The droplet remains in the Cassie state and advances spontaneously following the wettability gradient under a small impact velocity, high pillar height, and large surface tension. On the contrary, when the coexistence of Cassie and Wenzel states appears, the contact line on the side of the Cassie state retracts and that on the side of the Wenzel state pins, inducing droplet movement against the wettability gradient. Additionally, the ...",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe Schmidt number effect on the rheology of finitely extensible nonlinear elastic chains (FENE) in many-body dissipative particle dynamics (MDPD) is investigated in this work. We find that the Schmidt number, ranging from (101) to (103), has limited influence on the polymer properties, such as its radius of gyration (Rg), diffusion coefficient (D) and relaxation time (\u03c4). The simulation results follow Zimm modelu0027s predictions well. The hydrodynamic interaction strength parameter h* demonstrates that the full hydrodynamic interaction can be simulated for Schmidt number from (100-106) in MDPD. Next, the rheology of FENE polymers is studied using Lees-Edward boundary condition in shear flow. The shear-thinning and normal stress difference are measured and analysed with MDPD; meanwhile, the volume fraction, solvent quality and chain length are varied to explore their effects on the extent of the Newtonian region. Finally, the non-Newtonian droplet is firstly simulated in MDPD. Its maximum spreading d...",

        "abstract": "AbstractViscometric properties of polymer are explored by the many-body dissipative particle dynamics (MDPD) using Lees\u2013Edwards boundary conditions. The equation of state for the MDPD system is modified by fitting the density correction to different values of the cut-off radius. Due to the many-body interactions in MDPD, the viscosity contributed from the conservative force increases considerably with increasing repulsive coefficient, density and cut-off radius, and cannot be ignored compared to the \u2018standard\u2019 DPD case. The influence of these parameters on the MDPD viscosity is investigated, and we propose an equation to predict the viscosity in MDPD model. Additionally, the dumbbell polymer suspension model is investigated in the MDPD fluid, and the relations concerning first normal stress difference and shear rate, the relaxation time and spring constant, are consistent to theoretical works. We conclude that the MDPD model can be used to investigate the dynamics of non-Newtonian droplets.",

        "abstract": "Up to now, various matrix norms (e.g., l\u2081-norm, l\u2082-norm, l2,1-norm, etc.) have been widely leveraged to form the loss function of different regression models, and have played an important role in image analysis. However, the previous regression models adopting the existing norms are sensitive to outliers and, thus, often bring about unsatisfactory results on the heavily corrupted images. This is because their adopted norms for measuring the data residual can hardly suppress the negative influence of noisy data, which will probably mislead the regression process. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel \u03b4(delta)-norm to count the nonzero blocks around an element in a vector or matrix, which weakens the impacts of outliers and also takes the structure property of examples into account. After that, we present the \u03b4-norm-based robust regression (DRR) in which the data examples are mapped to the kernel space and measured by the proposed \u03b4-norm. By exploring an explicit kernel function, we show that DRR has a closed-form solution, which suggests that DRR can be efficiently solved. To further handle the influences from mixed noise, DRR is extended to a multiscale version. The experimental results on image classification and background modeling datasets validate the superiority of the proposed approach to the existing state-of-the-art robust regression models.",

The main challenge of Lidar based obstacle detection is that processing the disordered and sparse point clouds would be difficult and time-consuming. Hence, this paper presents a novel usage of U-disparity to locate obstacles indiscriminately with point clouds, which makes obstacle detection effective and efficient. The proposed method firstly uses cross-calibration to align point cloud with reference image, so that a depth map is formed. Then, the U-disparity map is introduced to process Lidar based depth map. Due to the particularity of Lidar based U-disparity, we select local peaks in column in U-disparity to identify relevant disparities of obstacles. After applying filtering and clustering steps on these salient peak disparities, the corresponding obstacles can be precisely localized. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on KITTI object detection benchmark and road detection benchmark reveal that the proposed method achieves very encouraging performances in various environments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A resonant type piezoelectric stepping motor using a bolt-clamped transducer is proposed and its novel driving method for stepping motion is discussed in this study. The exciting signals used in the driving method consist of several sinusoidal signals and a pause in one driving period, and the two exciting signals applied to the longitudinal PZT plates and bending PZT plates have a phase shift of \u03c0/2. The first longitudinal vibration and second bending vibration of the motor are excited and two intermittent reciprocating vibrations along two orthogonal directions are generated on the driving tip to press and drive a linear runner step-by-step, respectively. The proposed motor is designed and its driving method is described. The operating principle of the motor is illustrated by finite element method. A prototype is fabricated and its impedance characteristics are tested to obtain the resonance frequencies. An experimental system is established to test mechanical output characteristics. The results state that the proposed stepping motor outputs a velocity and thrust force of 11.73\u2009mm/s and 18\u2009N under voltage of 200 V p-p . The displacement resolution is tested as 0.26\u2009\u03bcm when the voltage and number of sinusoidal signal in one period are 200 V p-p  and 1.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A U-shaped stepping piezoelectric actuator featuring low motion coupling is proposed, fabricated and tested. The actuator contains four similar piezoelectric actuation units (PAUs): two of them are used as the clamping units, while the other two act as the pushing units. The sliders and brackets supporting the clamping units can strongly suppress the motion coupling. The actuator can move the runner twice in each cycle with the operating principle similar to an inchworm. Static models are developed to calculate the step length and clamping force of the proposed actuator. A prototype is fabricated and its mechanical output characteristics are measured. The measured step length and clamping force agree well with the calculated results by the static model. The operating principle is verified by the experiment results, and the motion coupling ratio is 4%. The output speed linearly depends on the voltage applied on the pushing units, which indicates that the proposed actuator is very suitable for speed control. The working frequency has positive effect on the speed in range from 0.05\u202fHz to 6.25\u202fHz, whereas negative effect is found over 6.25\u202fHz. The prototype achieves a maximum thrust force of 189.7\u202fN and a maximum speed of 273.4\u202f\u03bcm/s.",

        "abstract": "Our previous study showed that invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells might act as an adjuvant to promote Th2 inflammatory responses in an OVA-induced mouse model of allergic asthma, but the mechanism remains unknown. To clarify the underlying mechanism through which iNKT cells promote Th2 inflammatory responses, we investigated the modulatory influence of iNKT cells on phenotypic and functional maturation of lung dendritic cells (LDCs) using iNKT cell-knockout mice, specific iNKT cell activation, coculture experiments, and adoptive transfer of iNKT cells in mouse models of asthma. Our data showed that iNKT cell deficiency could downregulate surface maturation markers and proinflammatory cytokine secretion of LDCs from a mouse model of asthma. However, elevated activation of iNKT cells by \u03b1-galactosylceramide and adoptive transfer of iNKT cells could upregulate surface maturation markers and proinflammatory cytokine secretion of LDCs from mouse models of asthma. Meanwhile, iNKT cells significantly influenced the function of LDCs, markedly enhancing Th2 responses in vivo and in vitro. In addition, iNKT cell can induce LDCs expression of CD206 and RELM-\u03b1, reflecting alternative activation of LDCs in a mouse model of asthma. \u03b1-Galactosylceramide treatment significantly enhanced expression of CD40L of lung iNKT cells from a mouse model of asthma, and the coculture experiment of LDCs with iNKT cells showed that the blockade of CD40L strongly suppressed surface maturation markers and proinflammatory cytokine production by LDCs. Our data suggest that iNKT cells can promote immunogenic maturation of LDCs to enhance Th2 responses in mouse models of asthma.",

        "abstract": "Asthma is a common inflammatory pulmonary disorder involving a diverse array of immune cells such as proinflammatory T helper 2 (Th2) cells. We recently reported that intraperitoneal injection of \u03b1-galactosylceramide (\u03b1-GalCer) can stimulate lung invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and does not lead to airway inflammation in WT mice. Other studies indicate that iNKT cells play an important role in inducing regulatory T cells (Treg cells) and peripheral tolerance. Using iNKT cell-knockout mice, functional inactivation of Treg cells, and co-culture experiments in murine asthma models, we investigated the immunoregulatory effects of \u03b1-GalCer treatment before allergen sensitization on Th2 cell responses. We also studied whether \u03b1-GalCer's effects require lung Treg cells induced by activated iNKT cells. Our results disclosed that intraperitoneal administration of \u03b1-GalCer before allergen sensitization could promote the expansion and suppressive activity of lung CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells. These effects were accompanied by down-regulated Th2 cell responses and decreased immunogenic maturation of lung dendritic cells (LDCs) in WT mice. However, these changes were absent in CD1d-/- mice immunized and challenged with OVA or house dust mite, indicating that the effects of \u03b1-GalCer on Treg cells mainly require iNKT cells. Moreover, functional inactivation of Treg cells could reverse the inhibitory ability of this \u03b1-GalCer therapy on Th2 cell responses in a murine asthma model. Our findings indicate that intraperitoneal administration of \u03b1-GalCer before the development of asthma symptoms induces the generation of lung Treg cells via iNKT cells and may provide a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent allergic asthma.",

        "abstract": "Cargo transport along axons, a physiological process mediated by motor proteins, is essential for neuronal function and survival. A current limitation in the study of axonal transport is the lack of a robust imaging technique with a high spatiotemporal resolution to visualize and quantify the movement of motor proteins in real-time and in different depth planes. Herein, we present a powerful imaging technique that fully exploits the characteristics of upconversion nanoparticles. This technique can be used as a nanoscopic probe for quantitatively in-situ tracking of retrograde transport neurons with single-particle resolution in multilayered cultures. This study may provide a powerful tool to reveal dynamic neuronal activity and intra-axonal transport function as well as any associated neurodegenerative diseases resulting from mutation or impairment in the axonal transport machinery.",

It is limited, however, because visible light cannot penetrate deep inside brain tissue. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) absorb tissue-penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light and emit wavelength-specific visible light. Here, we demonstrate that molecularly tailored UCNPs can serve as optogenetic actuators of transcranial NIR light to stimulate deep brain neurons. Transcranial NIR UCNP-mediated optogenetics evoked dopamine release from genetically tagged neurons in the ventral tegmental area, induced brain oscillations through activation of inhibitory neurons in the medial septum, silenced seizure by inhibition of hippocampal excitatory cells, and triggered memory recall. UCNP technology will enable less-invasive optical neuronal activity manipulation with the potential for remote therapy.",

        "abstract": "Over many years, high phosphorus (P) loading for intensive vegetable cropping in greenhouses of North China has contributed to excessive P accumulation, resulting in environmental risk. In this study, the influences of manure and nitrogen (N) application on the transformation and transport of soil P were investigated after nine years in a greenhouse tomato double cropping system (winter-spring and autumn-winter seasons). High loading of manure significantly increased the soil inorganic P (Pi), inositol hexakisphosphate (IHP), mobile P and P saturation ratio (PSR, >0.7 in 0-30\u00a0cm depth soil; PSR was estimated from P/(Fe\u00a0+\u00a0Al) in an oxalate extract of the soil). The high rate of N fertilizer application to the studied calcareous soil with heavy loading of manure increased the following: (i) mobile organic P (Po) and Pi fractions, as evidenced by the decrease in the ratio of monoesters to diesters and the proportion of stable Pi (i.e., HCl-Pi) in total P (Pt) in 0-30\u00a0cm depth soil; (ii) relative distribution of Po in the subsoil layer; and (iii) P leaching to soil depths below 90\u00a0cm and the proportion of Po in Pt in the leachate. More acidic soil due to excessive N application increased P mobility and leaching. The increase in Ox-Al (oxalate-extractable Al) and the proportion of microbe-associated Po related to N application at soil depths of 0-30\u00a0cm suggested decrease in the net Po mineralization, which may contribute to downward transport of Po in the soil profile.

        "abstract": "Potassium (K) is important for crop quality, and this knowledge has stimulated substantial K fertilizer application in intensive cropping systems of China, resulting in an unbalanced nutrient supply and the squandering of K resources. In this study, we assessed the status of K in China\u2019s intensive vegetable planting systems using data from the literature and our recent results. Scenario analysis was designed to estimate the potential for reducing chemical K fertilizer based on the K recommended strategy and manure replacement strategies. The results showed that K surplus, and soil exchangeable K levels in vegetable fields increased during the period with a stable growing area (2003\u2013) compared to the period with an expanding growing area (before 2003). Much higher K surplus and accumulation and more severe K leaching were observed in greenhouse. Excessive K application contributed to low K use efficiency and K resource waste. Based on the data analysis, the K consumption derived from chemical fertilizer and organic amendments was 8.2 million Mg K, though the theoretical demand for vegetable planting was only 6.0 million Mg K with the K recommendation strategy of \u201cbuild-up and maintenance (Bu0026M)\u201d. Scenario analysis suggested that chemical K fertilizer application could be reduced by 21.7, 69.6 and 54.3% by considering alternative K sources derived from manure and straw, as based on the conventional proportion, N-based strategy and P-based strategy, respectively. Maximizing the use of K from organic amendments requires limiting manure application by considering environmental deterioration and the topdressing requirement with chemical K fertilizer.",

Influences of manure application on the forms and sorption-desorption characteristics of P in surface (0\u201330\u202fcm) and subsurface (30\u201360\u202fcm) layer of a calcareous soil were investigated in a six-year field trial in comparison to chemical fertilizer application. Hedley fractionation and P K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy were used to determine the soil P forms. Manure (M) and chemical fertilizer (F) treatments resulted in P accumulation in two soil depths, but the total P accumulation in surface soil with M treatment was significantly lower than F treatment with similar P surplus. Compared to control, M and F treatments were significantly increased the proportion of labile P at both depths. In surface soil, M treatment significantly decreased stable Ca-associated P proportion and increased Fe-associated P and inositol hexakisphosphate proportions. The accumulation and transformation of P in M treatment distinctly decreased P sorption maximun, sorption coefficient and buffer capacity, and increased the degree of P saturation and P desorption relative to F treatment. The soil properties of pH, organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), Mehlich-3 extractable Ca and Fe, and phytase in surface soil and pH, OC, TN, Mehlich-3 extractable Ca and dehydrogenase in subsurface soil had significant effects on the compositions of soil P ( P",

Column batch flooded experiment using vegetable (VEG) and steppe (STE) soils was conducted to investigate the P transformation and mobility influenced by 60-day intermittent elution with an (1500\u202fmg\u202fN kg) solution or an acid sulfate (107\u202fmmol\u202fH kg) solution. The results showed that AN elution significantly decreased the contents of all P fractions and strengthened P leaching, whereas acid elution increased the contents of Al-P, Fe-P, and reductant-soluble P and reduced P leaching in VEG soil. In contrast, AN elution increased the contents of soluble-P and Al-(P\u00a0+\u00a0P) and decreased Ca-P and Fe-P, no effects on P leaching, whereas acid elution increased the contents of soluble-(P\u00a0+\u00a0P), Al-(P\u00a0+\u00a0P), Fe-(P\u00a0+\u00a0P) and reduced P leaching in STE soil. Variances analysis showed that pH and microbial biomass carbon were the most important factors to predict the P composition of the VEG and the STE soil, respectively. This indicated that AN elution released the soil mineral-bound phosphate with ammonia oxidation coupled with Fe(III) reduction, besides the same chemical influences on Fe/Al oxides as acid elution in VEG soil; while predominantly affected biochemical/biological processes of soil P by changing microbial biomass and enzyme activities in STE soil.",

Thermal behavior characterizations were carried out through specific heat, effective thermal conductivity, and coefficient of thermal expansion analyses using differential scanning calorimetry, high temperature guarded-comparative-longitudinal heat flow technique, and thermomechanical analyzer (TMA), respectively. The experimental results were compared with analytical results obtained from, respectively, rule of mixture, Brailsford and Majoru0027s model, and modified Turneru0027s model for verification. United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) standards were employed as regulatory standards and criteria for fire retardant property study. The results revealed a superior thermal resistance and fire survivability of CMFs compared to 304L stainless steel. A physics-based three-dimensional model accounting for heat conduction was built using Finite Element Analysis to validate the reliability of the experimental results. The model led to a good reproduction of the experimentally measured data when comparing CMF to bulk stainless steel. This research indicates that one of the potential applications of lightweight CMFs can be in nuclear spent fuel casks replacing conventional structural and radiation shielding materials with demonstrated benefits of excellent thermal isolation, fire retardant, light weight and energy absorption capabilities.",

        "title": "Studies on surface preparation and smoothness of nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys by electrochemical and mechanical methods",
        "abstract": "Significant improvements in the dimensionless thermoelectric figure-of-merit (ZT) for nanostructured bismuth telluride, Bi 2 Te 3 , and its alloys have been demonstrated. In designing high-performance thermoelectric devices, variations in the thermal and electrical contact resistances due to interfacial effects between the nanostructured alloy and the metallic electrodes remain a significant issue. Smooth scratch-free surfaces should provide a baseline for contact resistance studies. In this paper, the root mean square roughness over a 10 \u03bcm 2 of nanostructured bismuth tellurium based alloys was reduced from 133 nm to 1.9 nm by a procedure consisting of electrolysis, mechanical polishing, and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Post-CMP cleaning was also developed to yield a wettable surface for the subsequent conformable metallization. Keywords Nanostructures Bismuth telluride based alloys Thermoelectrics Electrolysis Chemical mechanical polishing 1 Introduction Nanostructured thermoelectric alloys exhibiting an enhanced dimensionless thermoelectric figure-of-merit (ZT) have attracted considerable interest recently for use in high-performance thermoelectric devices [1\u20133] . In particular, nanostructured p-type bismuth antimony tellurides have achieved a peak ZT of about 1.4 at 100 \u00b0C [1] . Bi 2 Te 3 -based alloys (Bi x Sb 2\u2212 x Te 3 as the p-type and Bi 2 Se y Te 3\u2212 y as the n-type) are the most widely used thermoelectric materials near room temperature. Device performance not only depends on ZT, but also on the electrical and thermal contact resistances between the electrodes and the thermoelectric materials [4,5] . Interfacial electrical and thermal contact resistances depend on the interface morphology. Surface roughness is an important parameter to control the interface morphology. One limit of the interface control is to achieve smooth and scratch-free surfaces. However, very little research has been conducted in the surface treatment of Bi 2 Te 3 -based alloys, especially nanostructured thermoelectric materials [6] . In conventional polishing processes, scratches are inevitably generated on the surface because of the relatively low hardness of Bi 2 Te 3 -based alloys compared with abrasives such as alumina or silica. In addition, nanostructured alloys have many grain boundaries which are weak points for mechanical or chemical treatment. This article presents a technique to prepare smooth scratch-free surfaces of nanostructured Bi 2 Te 3 -based alloys by electrolysis, mechanical polishing, and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). A post-CMP method was also developed to achieve a wettable surface for the subsequent metallization. Root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of 1.9 nm is achieved. Such smooth surfaces will be of fundamental interest for studying interfacial electrical and thermal contact resistances, and is particularly convenient for interfacial thermal resistance measurements using time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTF) technique [7\u20139] . 2 Experimental 2.1 Sample fabrication Bulk nanostructured Bi 2 Te 3 -based materials, p-type (alloyed with Sb as Bi x Sb 2\u2212 x Te 3 ) and n-type (alloyed with Se as Bi 2 Se y Te 3\u2212 y ) disk samples of 25 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness were made by a ball milling and hot pressing method [1] . After hot pressing, both sides of the disk sample were polished using sand paper. This initial surface was used as a reference for the polishing process. A South Bay Technologies Model 920 polishing tool was used for all polishing processes. 2.2 Measurements A Nanoscope IIIa atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to scan the surfaces and calculate the root mean square (RMS) roughness. A KLA-Tencor P16 profilometer was used to do line-scan across the surface for dissolution rate evaluation. Contact angle was measured by a static contact angle goniometer, Kyowa Kaimen CA-X. Electrochemical measurement, including cyclic voltammogram, open circuit potential, static potentiodynamic polarization was performed using a Gamry PCI4/300 potentistat/galvanostat system. A platinum mesh was used as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode in standard three-electrode system. The experiments were successively carried out on n-type nanostructured Bi 2 Se y Te 3\u2212 y alloys at first and then on p-type Bi x Sb 2\u2212 x Te 3 . 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 (a) is an AFM image of the initial surface and exhibits a root mean square roughness of 133 nm. At this roughness, mechanical polishing will require a long processing time to reach a low surface roughness. However, polishing for an extended period of time has a high possibility of generating deep scratches or chemical corrosion, particularly in nanostructured alloys which are prone to such issues due to the abundant grain boundaries. The details of Figs. 1 (b)\u2013(d) are described in the subsequent sections. A previous paper reported that mixtures of NaOH\u2013tartaric acid form a good electrolyte for electrolytic etching of Bi 2 Te 3 with the goal of achieving a preliminary flat surface to reduce processing time for the following polishing steps [6] . However, very few papers provided detailed explanation of this method. Here, we tried to understand and utilize this method from an electrochemical perspective. We were interested in the range of pH and potentials where it is possible to dissolve both major species of bismuth and tellurium in an aqueous solution. According to the Pourbaix diagram of Bi 2 Te 3 , tellurium is soluble as TeO 4 2\u2212 but bismuth precipitates as insoluble Bi 2 O 3 in a range at pH > 7.5 [10,11] . If applying potentials larger than 1.5 V at pH > 10.5, tellurium is still soluble as TeO 4 2\u2212 and bismuth would form Bi 2 O 5 . Based on reactions relating aqueous bismuth and tellurium species and its precipitates, Bi 2 O 5 would react with hydrogen cations to become Bi 3+ which would dissolve into solution [11,12] . Fig. 2 is the anodic wave of cyclic voltammetry in a 10% sodium hydroxide solution and a mixture of 10% sodium hydroxide and 5% tartaric acid to make pH 11.5 solutions. The rise in current density is less pronounced when tartaric acid is not used. It leads us to believe that tartaric acid performs the role of providing hydrogen cations for Bi 2 O 5 in the electrolysis reaction. In principle, an ideal electrolysis process can achieve a low surface roughness by itself, but at the cost of greater surface damage due to a longer processing time. SEM pictures of surfaces after electrolyzing at 1.5 V for 30 s and 1.5 V for 60 s are shown in Fig. 3 . These figures confirm that electrolysis at longer processing time damages the surface, with cracks forming at the grain boundaries. Thus, the initial surface was electrolyzed at 1.5 V for 30 s in a mixture of 10% NaOH and 5% tartaric acid to achieve a preliminary flat surface. The RMS roughness was reduced from 133 nm to 52 nm, as seen in Fig. 1 (b). The samples were then mechanically polished on a Buehler Trident cloth pad with an upper soft cloth surface and lower hard polyurethane support. A composite polishing pad is important for nanostructured Bi 2 Te 3 -based alloys because the upper soft cloth will prevent deep scratches while the lower hard supporting pad will prevent the surface from being polished along its beginning topography. The slurry used here is a 5 wt% 0.05 \u03bcm alumina suspension, also commercially available from Buehler. The polishing down-force was 1.1 psi with a counter-clockwise plate rotational speed of 110 rpm and a counter-clockwise carrier rotation of 30 rpm. The slurry flow rate was fixed at 45 mL/min. The low down-force polishing is used to eliminate surface scratches but will extend polishing time. If chemical mechanical polishing was directly used instead, frictional heat would accelerate the chemical reaction, causing corrosion on the nanostructured Bi 2 Te 3 surface. For that reason, mechanical polishing was performed prior to chemical mechanical polishing to make the chemical reaction short. The 52 nm RMS roughness of the sample after electrolysis was reduced to 3.2 nm over a 10 \u03bcm 2 area after polishing for 30 min, as shown in Fig. 1 (c). But, mechanical polishing inevitably generated scratches on the surface of nanostructured Bi 2 Te 3 -based alloys. Following the mechanical polishing step, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) was employed to erase surface scratches. The abrasive used in this slurry consisted of a 5 wt% 0.05 \u03bcm colloid silica. The CMP slurry chemistry determines the final polishing performance where the key is to form a passivation layer in order to reduce the isotropic etching of recessed regions on an uneven surface. According to the Pourbaix diagram, Bi 2 Te 3 can be passivated in acidic media with pH ranging from 3.5 to 6 [11\u201313] . Nitric acid, which is a good etchant for Bi 2 Se y Te 3\u2212 y alloys, was added to adjust the pH. Fig. 4 (a) shows the open circuit potential (OCP) of n-type nanostructured Bi 2 Se y Te 3\u2212 y alloys as a function of the pH value. At pH values ranging from 3.5 to 9, bismuth forms insoluble Bi 2 O 3 . At a pH of 5, OCP decreased to a stable value indicating the formation of passivation layer. At a pH of 3.5, OCP decreased first and then increased. The reason could be that TeO 3 is not stable at low pH acidic solution and would be reduced to TeO 2 or HTeO 2 + based on thermodynamic expressions of the Bi 2 Te 3 system [10,12] . For general conditions, it would form HTeO 4 \u2212 dissolved in slurry to increase OCP. Therefore, the pH needs to be controlled between 4 and 7 to prevent Te dissolution. So, the slurry pH we used here was 5. In general, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) can be utilized in polishing slurries as an oxidizer to enhance the passivating reaction and some inhibitors, such as benzotriazole (BTA), are also added to avoid isotropic etching. Fig. 4 (b) is the polarization scans with and without H 2 O 2 and BTA. At a pH of 5, there is a sign of passivation at the anodic current branch. The film may not completely passivate the surface but may still decrease the dissolution rate, as is expected according to the results for open circuit potential. In the presence of 1 vol% hydrogen peroxide, the corrosion potential increased and the corrosion current density decreased. This result reveals that the effect of adding an extra oxidizer would decrease the corrosion rate. We tried to add more hydrogen peroxide up to 5 vol% into the system, but the corrosion potential and current did not show any significant change. The reason could be that the surface is already in its passive state above 1 vol% H 2 O 2 and that etching is likely controlled by ionic diffusion through a passivation layer [13] . In an efficient CMP operation, the dissolution rate at a recessed region on the uneven surface should be as small as possible to avoid isotropic etching. Benzotriazole (BTA) is a well-known corrosion inhibitor for copper, copper-alloys, and other metal surfaces [14] . The effect of BTA on metal CMP to reduce the corrosion in the recessed areas has also been studied [15] . If a 0.1 vol% BTA is added into 1 vol% H 2 O 2 pH 5 slurry, the potential drop became more positive and the corrosion current density decreased, and there was pronounced passivation sign between 0 V and 0.8 V SCE (saturated calomel electrode), as shown in Fig. 4 (b). Fig. 4 (c) shows an average dissolution rate to provide evidence that a protective layer was formed using both 1% hydrogen peroxide and 0.1% benzotriazole in slurry. Based on previous studies [14\u201317] , even a small amount of BTA reduces the dissolution rate significantly and further increase of BTA concentration does not enhance the metal protection. As mentioned above, CMP slurry for the nanostructured Bi 2 Se y Te 3\u2212 y alloys is 1% hydrogen peroxide, 0.1% benzotriazole, and 5 wt% 0.05 \u03bcm colloidal silica at pH of 5 adjusted by nitric acid. Fig. 1 (d) shows a scratch-free surface after 5 min of chemical mechanical polishing. As a result, a scratch-free surface with 1.9 nm RMS roughness over 10 \u03bcm 2 was achieved on nanostructured Bi 2 Se y Te 3\u2212 y alloy by 30 s electrolysis, 30 min mechanical polishing, and 5 min chemical mechanical polishing. Since the CMP process leaves abrasive particles, trace metal, and organic component on the surface, post-CMP cleaning is necessary. Any particles left behind has a significant effect in creating imperfections ranging from bumps or pits to regions of excessive contact resistance or to causes non-uniform thin metal transducer layer for pump-and-probe measurement [18,19] . On the other hand, almost the entire surface of Bi 2 Se y Te 3\u2212 y alloys would be covered with a hydrophobic thin oxide layer after CMP, which functions poorly as nucleation sites for metallization because the growth of metal film on substrates is classified by the same principles as wetting or nonwetting of liquids [20,21] . If the film wets the substrate, the atoms are more strongly bound to the substrate than to each other and grow layer-by-layer (Frank\u2013van der Merwe growth). In contrast, if the film wets poorly, the atoms are more strongly bound to each other than to the substrate and grow three-dimensional islands (Volmer\u2013Weber growth). Volmer\u2013Weber growth is similar to liquid droplets with a large contact angle and is usually not desirable for technological applications. Therefore, post-CMP cleaning must yield a wettable and clean surface beneficial to subsequent metallization processes. The contact angle was used to evaluate wettability and particle removal efficiency [18,22] . Generally, the number of residual slurry particles decreases with decreasing contact angle in the region until reaching a threshold in wettability [22] . A 0.5% bromine in ethanol solution was chosen to remove the thin oxide on Bi 2 Te 3 -based alloys [6] . After bromine\u2013ethanol treatment, a 5% additive (product name: CLEAN-100, Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.) was chosen to improve the wettability, dissolve the organic components, and promote lift-off of particles from the substrate [19] . After 1 min of immersing in bromine-ethanol at room temperature and a 5 min immersion in CLEAN-100 at 45 \u00b0C with sonication, the contact angle with the sample surface and water was measured, as shown in Fig. 5 . The sample surface with and without post-CMP cleaning showed a contact angle of 53.6\u00b0 and 79.7\u00b0, respectively. So, it is believable that a metal film would wet on the nanostructured Bi 2 Se y Te 3\u2212 y surface after cleaning. 100 nm nickel films by sputtering on sample surfaces with and without post-CMP cleaning were evaluated by SEM observation ( Fig. 6 (a) and (c) ). The SEM results are consistent with wettability of liquids where a conformable nickel film was formed on the wettable surface, and cracked on the nonwetting surface where metal islands can be clearly seen. AFM was also used to measure the roughness of the 100 nm nickel films sputtered on the surface of nanostructured Bi 2 Se y Te 3\u2212 y alloys with and without post-CMP cleaning ( Fig. 6 (b) and (d)). Uniform nickel film can be achieved on wettable surface. Poor wettability has relatively large surface roughness because poor nucleation results in growing three-dimensional islands. These results support the SEM observation and can be explained by Volmer\u2013Weber growth model. These processes were also successfully reproduced on p-type Bi x Sb 2\u2212 x Te 3 samples with the same performance. We performed this process sequence on several samples of both n- and p-types to prove that the smooth scratch-free surface can be achieved on nanostructured Bi 2 Te 3 -based alloys. Based on this work, more experiments and investigations can be carried out for a complete understanding of the interfacial effect on mechanical strength and contact resistance of nanostructured Bi 2 Te 3 -based alloys. 4 Conclusions In this paper, a new polishing process involving electrolysis, mechanical polishing, chemical mechanical polishing, and post-CMP cleaning was developed to fabricate scratch-free surfaces with a 1.9 nm root mean square roughness over a 10 \u03bcm 2 on both n- and p-type nanostructured Bi 2 Te 3 -based alloys. It was found that an optimal electrolysis treatment can preliminarily reduce surface roughness in a short time. Mechanical polishing, using a composite pad and slurry of 5 wt% 0.05 \u03bcm alumina, was then conducted to achieve global planarization. Chemical mechanical polishing was then used to remove scratches by softening the surface. The slurry used in this process consisted of 1% hydrogen peroxide, 0.1% benzotriazole, and 5 wt% 0.05 \u03bcm colloidal silica at pH of 5. To achieve a wettable surface for subsequent metallization, a 0.5% bromine in ethanol solution with 5% WAKO CLEAN-100 additive was used for post-CMP cleaning. Conformable metallization by sputtering was then achieved on the wettable and smooth surface. Acknowledgements The authors thank Jonathan K.

        "abstract": "Biology is well known for its ability to communicate through molecularly specific signaling modalities and a globally acting electrical modality associated with ion flow across biological membranes. Emerging research suggests that biology uses a third type of communication modality associated with a \u201cflow\u201d of electrons through reduction/oxidation (redox) reactions. This redox signaling modality appears to act globally and has features of both molecular and electrical modalities: since free electrons do not exist in aqueous solution, the electrons must \u201cflow\u201d through molecular intermediates that can be switched between two states\u2014with electrons (reduced) or without electrons (oxidized). Importantly, this global redox modality is easily accessible through its electrical features using convenient electrochemical instrumentation. In this review, we explain this redox modality, describe our electrochemical measurements, and provide four examples demonstrating that redox enables communication between biology and electronics. The first two examples illustrate how redox probing can acquire biologically relevant information. The last two examples illustrate how redox inputs can transduce biologically relevant transitions for patterning and the induction of a synthetic biology (synbio) \u201ctransceiver\u201d for two-hop molecular communication. In summary, we believe redox provides a unique ability to bridge biodevice communication because simple electrochemical methods enable global access to biologically meaningful information. Furthermore, we envision that redox may facilitate the application of information theory to the biological sciences.",

Here, we move information processing upstream for data acquisition and report that a sample's \"chemical space\" can be actively probed using a tailored sequence of redox-based input signals. Specifically, we use a redox-active iridium salt (KIrCl) and an oxidative pulse-redox-relaxation input sequence to probe serum samples for chemical information. Optical and electrical output responses are collected simultaneously and analyzed using signal metrics that are sensitive to component and concentration dependent chemical information. We use the example of schizophrenia to illustrate the potential of this signal processing approach to rapidly discover discriminating signatures using simple and inexpensive instrumentation. These studies indicate that redox-probing provides an orthogonal measurement approach to accelerate biomarker discovery and further suggest a simple means to supply chemical information for the internet-of-things in medical and consumer applications.",

        "abstract": "Accumulating evidence implicates oxidative stress in a range of diseases, yet no objective measurement has emerged that characterizes the global nature of oxidative stress. Previously, we reported a measurement that employs the moderately strong oxidant iridium (Ir) to probe the oxidative damage in a serum sample and reported that in a small study (N\u202f=\u202f15) the Ir-reducing capacity assay could distinguish schizophrenia from healthy control groups based on their levels of oxidative stress. Here, we used a larger sample size to evaluate the Ir-reducing capacity assay to assess its ability to discriminate the schizophrenia (N\u202f=\u202f73) and healthy control groups (N\u202f=\u202f45). Each serum sample was measured (in triplicate) at three different times that were separated by several weeks. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC\u202f=\u202f0.69) for these repeated measurements indicates the assay detects stable components in the sample (i.e., it is not detecting transient reactive species or air-oxidizable serum components). Correlations between the Ir-reducing capacity assay and independently-measured total serum protein levels (r\u202f=\u202f+0.74, p\u202f<\u202f2.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10) suggest the assay is detecting information in the protein pool. For cross-validation of the discrimination ability, we used machine learning and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. After adjusting for potential confounders (age and smoking status), an area under the curve (AUC) of ROC curve was calculated to be 0.89 (p\u202f=\u202f9.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10). In conclusion, this validation indicates the Ir-reducing capacity assay provides a simple global measure of oxidative stress, and further supports the hypothesis that oxidative stress is linked with schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Acesulfame has attracted much attention due to its wide application, environmental persistence and potential safety risk of transformation products (TPs). Little information is known on acesulfame transformation in the presence of oxidants/disinfectants. The acesulfame oxidation by permanganate (Mn(VII)) in water under environmentally relevant conditions was systematically evaluated. The pH of water showed negligible influence in acesulfame oxidation. Inorganic ligand (pyrophosphate) exhibited insignificant effect whereas organic ligands (oxalate, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, and humic acid) exerted obvious suppression on acesulfame oxidation. Natural organic matter in real water had important influence in acesulfame oxidation by Mn(VII). Acesulfame transformation pathways were initiated by the attack of Mn(VII) on double bond of ring via [3+2] addition electrocyclic reaction and rich electron of N moiety through electrophilic reaction, followed by oxidation and hydrolysis reactions to produce TPs. Among them, five TPs were for the first time identified. The ecotoxicity tests uncover higher toxicity of the TPs than acesulfame itself. The study on oxidative transformation of acesulfame by Mn(VII) would illumine comprehensive evaluation of this emerging contaminant. Water treatment plants need to consider cautiously to protect the safety of downstream system when using Mn(VII) to dispose the water resource containing acesulfame or other artificial sweeteners.",

        "abstract": "Prednisolone (PDNN) as an emergent micropollutant directly influences the regional ecological security. In this study, the degradation of PDNN by ultraviolet activated chlorine (UV/chlorine) oxidation process was comprehensively evaluated. The quenching experiment suggested that the PDNN degradation in UV/chlorine process was involved in the participation of hydroxyl radical (OH) and reactive chlorine species (RCS). Influence factors including chlorine dosage, pH, common anion and cation, fulvic acid (FA) on PDNN degradation via UV/chlorine process were investigated. A low chlorine (\u22647.1\u202fmg\u202fL) promoted the PDNN degradation, while a high chlorine dosage (>7.1\u202fmg\u202fL) was adverse. The pH (4.0-10.0) showed negligible effect, while the investigated anions (Cl, Br, HCO and SO), NH and FA exerted negative impact on PDNN degradation. An efficient process to minimize pharmaceutical micropollutants was the disposal of human urine containing a high concentration of pharmaceutical and potential toxic metabolites. An inhibitory effect was observed in the synthetic urine (fresh urine and hydrolyzed urine). The intermediates/products were identified and the mechanism of PDNN degradation was proposed. PDNN gone through three degradation routes, involving the direct addition of \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated ketone at C or C, the photolysis of C and H-abstraction of C. The main reactive sites were further determined by comparison of the frontier orbitals calculation and the proposed mechanism. Based on the toxicological tests for PDNN degradation, TP396 (TP396-CCl and TP396-CCl) and TP414-2-1 (TP414-CClCOH) exhibited much higher toxicity than PDNN, and prolonging reaction time was necessary to achieve PDNN detoxification.",

At the optimal PS-MS conditions, the calibration curves of bisphenols in the range of 1-100 \u03bcg/mL were linear. The correlation coefficients were higher than 0.998, and the LODs of the target compounds were 0.1-0.3 \u03bcg/mL. After a simple treatment by dichloromethane on the surface, the samples were analyzed by PS-MS in situ for rapid screening without a traditional sample pretreatment procedure, such as powdering, extraction, and enrichment steps. The analytical time of the PS-MS method was less than 1 min. In comparison with conventional HPLC-MS/MS, it was demonstrated that PS-MS was a more effective high-throughput screening and quantitative analysis method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Although UV/chlorine advanced oxidation process has been employed to treat contaminants, the roles of secondary radicals are generally negligible. The comprehensive evaluation of secondary radicals on contaminants degradation remains deficient. In this study, two typical neonicotinoid insecticides, imidacloprid (IMD) and thiacloprid (THIA), were degraded via UV/chlorine process. It is for the first time found that the existence of Cl \u2212  significantly promoted THIA degradation during UV/chlorine process, attributed to the formation of Cl 2   \u2212 . In addition, the effects of pH, fulvic acid (FA), and bicarbonate (HCO 3  \u2013 ) on the degradation of IMD and THIA were evaluated. Low pH was in favor of the degradation of IMD and THIA, while both FA and HCO 3  \u2013  had slight inhibition effects. Meanwhile, the degradation of IMD and THIA via UV/chlorine process was inhibited in real matrices. The existence of Br \u2212  heavily suppressed the degradation of THIA via UV/chlorine process. The initial transformation pathways of IMD and THIA involved electron transfer, H-abstraction, and then disproportionation or the methylene bridge cleavage, yielding hydroxyl and keto derivatives as well as free amine. Although the mineralization for IMD (29%) and THIA (35%) was low, the acute toxicity to  Vibrio fischeri  for the treated samples was lower than that for corresponding parent compounds. This study comprehensively evaluated the degradation of IMD and THIA via UV/chlorine process, highlighting Cl 2   \u2212  as an important reactive species for THIA elimination.",

        "abstract": "As a dedicated communication protocol for Internet-of-Things, narrowband internet of things (NB-IoT) needs to establish the communication link rapidly and reduce retransmissions as much as possible to achieve low power consumption and stable performance. To achieve these targets, the low-power scheme of the initial cell search and frequency tracking is investigated in this paper. The cell search process can be subdivided into narrowband primary synchronization signal (NPSS) detection and narrowband secondary synchronization signal (NSSS) detection. We present an NPSS detection method whose timing metric is composed of symbol-wise autocorrelation and a dedicated normalization factor. After the detection of NPSS, the symbol timing and fractional frequency offset estimation is implemented in a resource-efficient way. NSSS detection is conducted in the frequency domain with a calculation-reduced algorithm based on the features of NSSS sequences. To compensate the accumulated frequency offset during uplink transmission, a pilot-aided rapid frequency tracking algorithm is proposed. The simulation results of the proposed cell search scheme are outstanding in both normal coverage and extended coverage NB-IoT scenarios, and the accumulated frequency offset can be estimated with high efficiency.",

        "abstract": "in this paper, the problem of coarse timing synchronization of low signal-to-noise radio (SNR) wireless orthogonal frequency-division-multiplexing systems (OFDM) for Internet of Things (IoT) is investigated. When OFDM is applied in IoT scenarios, the system needs to work at quite low SNR to achieve extended coverage. The proposed coarse synchronization method can response efficiently to the aforementioned challenge with a noise-eliminated timing metric. The simulation results of detection failure probability at different SNRs and number of processed frames indicate that significant performance improvement is obtained with the proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "Wireless charging technologies have attracted much attention from both academia and industry due to their great potential of freeing devices from wires and batteries, becoming one of the key research areas in recent years. Many platforms have been designed based on different charging technologies for a wide range of scenarios, including structural monitoring, habitat monitoring, wearable devices, volcano monitoring, and so on. However, these existing platforms cannot be deployed quickly and flexibly in many harsh environments, resulting in high deployment cost. In this article, we propose Q-Charge, a wireless charging platform integrated with a quadcopter, which is able to provide desirable energy for large-scale sensing applications. Q-Charge is composed of three components: an energy transfer module, a programmable quadcopter unit, and a cloud server. A wireless charger is installed on a quadcopter to achieve remote energy delivery, and a sink node retrieves data packets from sensors and forwards them to the cloud via a service gateway. Our platform has been successfully implemented for building structure and farmland monitoring, which demonstrates Q-Charge to be effective and efficient.",

        "abstract": "RF power transfer is becoming a reliable solution to energy supplement of Internet of Things (IoT) in recent years, thanks to the emerging off-the-shelf wireless charging and sensing platforms. As a core component of IoT, sensor nodes mounted with these platforms can not work and harvest energy simultaneously, due to the low-manufacture-cost requirement. This leads to a new design challenge of optimally scheduling sensor nodesu0027 operation states: working or recharging, to achieve a desirable network utility. We show that the operation state scheduling problem is quite challenging, since the time-varying network topology leads to spatiotemporal coupling of scheduling strategies. We first consider a single-hop special case of small-scale networks. We employ geometric programming to transfer it into a convex optimization problem, and obtain an optimal analytical solution. Then a general case of large-scale multi-hop networks is investigated. Based on Lyapunov optimization technique, we design a State Scheduling Algorithm (SSA) with a proved performance guarantee. Our algorithm decouples the primal problem by defining a dynamic energy threshold vector, which successfully schedules each sensor node to the desirable state according to its energy level. To verify our design, the SSA is implemented on a Powercast wireless charging and sensing testbed, achieving about 85% of the theoretical optimal with quite low time complexity. Furthermore, numerous simulation results demonstrate that the SSA outperforms the baseline algorithms and achieves good performance under different network settings.",

        "abstract": "Drosophila melanogaster Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam1) can potentially generate 38,016 different isoforms through stochastic, yet highly biased, alternative splicing. Genetic studies demonstrated that stochastic expression of multiple Dscam1 isoforms provides each neuron with a unique identity for self/non-self-discrimination. However, due to technical obstacles, the functional significance of the highly specific bias in isoform expression remains entirely unknown. Here, we provide conclusive evidence that Dscam1 splicing bias is required for precise mushroom body (MB) axonal wiring in flies in a variable exon-specific manner. We showed that targeted deletion of the intronic docking site perturbed base pairing-mediated regulation of inclusion of variable exons. Unexpectedly, we generated mutant flies with normal overall Dscam1 protein levels and an identical number but global changes in exon 4 and exon 9 isoform bias (Dscam\u03944D and Dscam\u03949D), respectively. Dscam\u03949D mutant exhibited remarkable mushroom body defects, which were correlated with the extent of the disrupted isoform bias. By contrast, the Dscam\u03944D animals exhibited a much less severe defective phenotype than Dscam\u03949D animals, suggestive of a variable domain-specific requirement for isoform bias. Importantly, mosaic analysis revealed that changes in isoform bias caused axonal defects but did not influence the self-avoidance of axonal branches. We concluded that, in contrast to the Dscam1 isoform number that provides the molecular basis for neurite self-avoidance, isoform bias may play a non-repulsive role in mushroom body axonal wiring.",

Drosophila PGRP-LC can generate three major 3' splice isoforms that exhibit distinct innate immune recognition and defenses against various microbial infections. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the uniquely biased splicing pattern at the 3' variable region remain unclear. Here we show that competing RNA pairings control the unique splicing of the 3' variable region of Drosophila PGRP-LC pre-mRNA. We reveal three roles by which these RNA pairings jointly regulate the 3' variant selection through activating the proximal 3' splice site and concurrently masking the intron-proximal 5' splice site, in combination with physical competition of RNA pairing. We also reveal that competing RNA pairings regulate alternative splicing of the highly complex 3' variable regions of Drosophila CG42235 and Pip. Our findings will facilitate a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of highly complex alternative splicing as well as highly variable 3' processing.",

RADA self-assembling peptide hydrogels have been proved to have an excellent ability to promote cell proliferation, wound healing, tissue repair, and drug delivery. Here, we report that D-RADA16 and L-RADA16-RGD self-assembling peptides can form stable second structure and hydrogel scaffolds, affording the slow release of growth factor (transforming growth factor cytokine-beta 1 [TGF-beta 1]). In vitro tests demonstrated that the plateau release amount can be obtained till 72 hours. Moreover, L-RADA16, D-RADA16, and L-RADA16-RGD self-assembling peptide hydrogels containing TGF-beta 1 were used for 3D cell culture of bone mesenchymal stem cells of rats for 2 weeks. The results revealed that these three RADA16 peptide hydrogels had a significantly favorable influence on proliferation of bone mesenchymal stem cells and hold some promise in slow and sustained release of growth factor.",

Based on micro-computed tomography (CT), it was revealed that d-RADA16 hydrogel and l-RADA16 hydrogel were capable to obtain the extensive bone healing. Histological evaluation also found that these two hydrogels facilitate the presence of more mature bone tissue within the femoral condyle defects. Additionally, d-RADA16 hydrogel showed some potential in storing and releasing basic-fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) which was able to further promote bone regeneration based on micro-CT analysis. These results indicate that d-form peptide nanofiber hydrogel have some special capacity for bone repair.",
