        "abstract": "Reduced graphene oxide aerogel (RGOA) is synthesized successfully through a simultaneous self-assembly and reduction process using hypophosphorous acid and I2 as reductant. Nitrogen sorption analysis shows that the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of RGOA could reach as high as 830 m2 g-1, which is the largest value ever reported for graphene-based aerogels obtained through the simultaneous self-assembly and reduction strategy. The as-prepared RGOA is characterized by a variety of means such as scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Electrochemical tests show that RGOA exhibits a high-rate supercapacitive performance in aqueous electrolytes. The specific capacitance of RGOA is calculated to be 211.8 and 278.6 F g-1 in KOH and H2SO4 electrolytes, respectively. The perfect supercapacitive performance of RGOA is ascribed to its three-dimensional structure and the existence of oxygen-containing groups.",

The capacitive performance of these carbons was investigated in organic and H2SO4 electrolytes. As demonstrated by structure analysis the prepared carbons possessed parallel mesoporous channels. The pore size increased from 3.3 to 5.7 nm and the molar fraction of oxygenated groups on the carbon surface increased from 2.0% to 5.2% with an increase in the amount of boric acid doping from 0 to 50% (molar fraction). In the organic electrolyte, the carbons mainly showed typical electric double layer capacitive performance and no visible pseudo-capacitance was induced. In H2SO4 electrolytes, BOMC-5 showed the highest specific mass capacitance of 140.9 F\u00b7g-1 and the specific surface capacitance of the prepared carbons increased with an increase in the oxygenated groups and this carbon showed visible pseudo-capacitance because of the rapid redox reactions of the oxygenated groups. The capacitance retention ratio depends on the surface chemical properties, which determines the wettability of the carbon surface and the electrolytes.",

The CDCs were characterized systematically by a variety of means such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultimate analysis, energy dispersive spectroscopy, N2 adsorption, and transmission electron microscopy. CO2 adsorption measurements showed that the oxidation process led to an increase in CO2 adsorption capacity of the porous carbons. Structural characterizations indicated that the adsorbability of the CDCs is not directly associated with its microporosity and specific surface area. As evidenced by elemental analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy, the adsorbability of the CDCs has a linear correlation with their surface oxygen content. The adsorption mechanism was studied using quantum chemical calculation. It is found that the introduction of O atoms into the carbon surface facilitates the hydrogen bonding interactions between the carbon surface and CO2 molecules. This new finding demonstrated that not only the basic N-containing groups but also the acidic O-containing groups can enhance the CO2 adsorbability of porous carbon, thus providing a new approach to design porous materials with superior CO2 adsorption capacity.",

        "abstract": "Mesoporous carbon electrode materials were prepared directly from pyrolysis of barium citrate. N 2 adsorption shows that the carbons prepared are typical mesoporous materials and that the specific surface area, total pore volume, mesopore volume and average pore size increase with the rise of carbonization temperature. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the carbons prepared at 700 and 800\u00b0C have superior capacitive performances than OMC prepared by hard-templated method. BaC-700 and BaC-800 could maintain high energy density at high power output, at which their mesopore surface are utilized efficiently. It is believed that these carbons are very promising for the scenarios where both high energy density and high power output are required.",

FCC waste catalyst was used as raw material for the synthesis of NaY zeolite from silica gel, sodium hydroxide and the directing(nucleation) agent via the hydrothermal method. For comparison purposes, the reference NaY zeolite was prepared using common industrial chemicals. The effect of FCC waste catalyst pretreatment on the performance of NaY zeolite was studied. It is found that Y zeolite synthesized using alkali activated FCC catalyst possesses high crystallinity and purity. Selected sample was characterized by XRD, N 2 adsorption-desorption techniques, TG-DTA method and temperature-programmed desorption of ammonium(NH 3-TPD). The results indicate that the NaY zeolite has similar performances to the reference zeolite and its surface area and pore volume can reach 615 m 2\u00b7g -1 and 0.38 cm 3\u00b7g -1 respectively.",

Hippocampus is a major target of aluminum accumulation in brain areas,and is learning and memory-related area. Aluminum affects neurologic functions through signal transduction molecules and transcription-related factors such as Ras/Raf/ERK(Ras/ERK) and CREB. Ras/Raf/ERK(Ras/ERK) pathway is related to learning and memory,CREB is involved in a variety of neural activities,including synaptic plasticity as well as learning and memory.

        "abstract": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a sustainable increase in the postsynaptic potential due to the rapidly repetitive stimulation applied in presynaptic neurons in a short period of time, which is considered as the basis for learning and memory formation. Sodium is one of the most important ions in the process of LTP induction, as the sodium influx causes a depolarization called the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). The high frequency stimuli causes the progressive depolarization of neurons as a result of EPSP summation, which relieves the magnesium blocked of the NMDA receptor, promotes the calcium influx and triggers the formation of LTP. Chronic aluminum exposure was reported to inhibit LTP induction and cut down LTP amplitude.The mRNA levels of 9 types of sodium channels, including Nav1.1-Nav1.9, have been analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR from the rat hippocampal neurons.The results showed that 7 of the sodium channels were significantly increased (P<0.05) at mRNA levels following chronic aluminum exposure, except for Nav1.4 and Nav1.8. The protein expression of Nav 1.2(the brain-type sodium channel) was significantly increased by Western blot analysis. It was concluded that chronic aluminum exposure might impair the learning and memory function by altering the expressin of sodium channels, therefore, affecting the postsynaptic depolarization required for the induction of LTP.",

        "abstract": "Aluminum-induced neuronal injury has been implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders. However, the underlying mechanism involved in this pathogenesis still remains unknown. Our present findings demonstrated that chronic aluminum exposure resulted in spatial learning impairment and significantly increased intracellular calcium level in the hippocampus of rats. Examination of the associated protein molecules essential for induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation revealed that aluminum exposure could increase the expression level of calmodulin (CaM), but the expression levels of CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and phosphorylated cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) were significantly reduced, whereas the total protein levels of CaMKII and CREB did not change in the aluminum-treated hippocampus. Thus, we provide a previously unrecognized mechanism whereby chronic aluminum exposure impairs hippocampal learning and memory, at least in part, through disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis and CaM/CaMKII/CREB signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "Objective In this research,we have observed changes of the activities of PKC and MAPK,and their regulatory roles in changing the amplitude value of LTP due to aluminium exposure so that we can discuss the impact on the learning and memory that caused by the changed activities of PKC and MAPK due to chronic aluminium exposure.Methods 80 Delactosed wistar rats were divided into 4 groups.The rats drank water containing different doses of aluminium chloride(AlCl_3)(0,2,4,6 g/L respectively) for 3 m.Measured the LTP in hippocampus and determined the activities of PKC & MAPK with improved Takai method.Results AlCl_3 exposure could inhibit both PKC and MAPK in dose-dependent manner.For MAPK,the multiple of specific activity for each group was respectively 3.43\u00b10.91,2.53\u00b11.21 and 2.64\u00b10.55(P<0.05);For PKC in cytoplasm,the multiple of specific activity for each group was respectively 4.95\u00b10.76,5.31\u00b10.90 and 5.50\u00b11.46(P<0.01);For PKC in cytolemma,the multiple of specific activity for each group was separately 9.84\u00b13.84,8.35\u00b12.32 and 7.56\u00b12.06(P<0.01).Conclusions Chronic aluminium exposure can reduce the amplitude value of LTP in hippocampus of rats and adjust the activities of PKC and ERK downwards.",

        "abstract": "Aim To investigate the effects of maternal chronic aluminum exposure on memorial behaviour and hippocampal intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i)on their offspring after the induction of LTP(long-term potentiation). Methods Adult Wistar rats (150~200 g) were exposed to aluminum by drinking distilled water, the concentration of AlCl3 is 0.015 mol\u00b7L-1(2 g\u00b7L-1) and 0.03 mol\u00b7L-1(4 g\u00b7L-1) aluminum chloride (AlCl3) solution, respectively, for 30 days prior to mating and during the whole gestation and suckling period. Their offspring were distributed into three experimental groups: control group; two exposed groups (represented by 0.2%-Al and 0.4%-Al ) administrated aluminum exposure ended at postnatal day 21. The brain tissue and blood aluminum levels were measured by Atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Memorial ability of the offspring was tested by Step down test.[Ca2+]i was measured by the technique of Fura-2/AM calcium ions fluorescence indicator. Results The mean aluminum content in blood and brain tissue was significantly higher than the control group(P<0.05 or P<0.01). The latencies of step down was significantly decreased, however, the error times of step down was significantly increased in the Al3+ exposed groups (P<0.01) as compared to the control group. The [Ca2+]i reduced in 0.2%-Al exposed group as well as 0.4%-Al exposed group. However, this reduction in 0.2%-Al exposed group was statistically non-significant(P>0.05), but was significantly decreased in 0.4%-Al exposed group(P<0.01). Conclusion Aluminum exposure of maternal rats impaired the memorial behaviour of the offspring, this impairment might be related to the decrease in [Ca2+]i caused by the aluminum exposure.",

The activity of protein kinase C (PKC) was determined and the Effect of aluminum on protein expressions of Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase \u2161 (CaMK\u2161) and neurogranin (Ng) were detected. The ablactated Wistar rats were used to establish the chronic aluminium exposure models by the gavage of AlCl_3 of different concentrations in the drinking water. And 3 months later, the concentrations of aluminum in brain and blood were measured, PS(population spilke) LTP in hippocampus of the rat was recorded, and then the activity of PKC was determined by modified Takai Method. Western blotting was used to determine the protein expressions of CaMK\u2161 and Ng in hippocampus. The PKC activity of AlCl_3 exposure groups is obviously lower than that of control groups (P<0.01). The protein expression of Ng in the hippocampi of AlCl_3-exposure groups falls down comparing with that of control groups in a dose dependent manner (P<0.05).The protein expression of CaMK\u2161 in the hippocampi of AlCl_3-exposure groups is lower than that of control groups in a dose dependent manner too (P<0.05). Chronic aluminum exposure can reduce not only the activity of PKC but also the protein expressions of CaMK\u2161 and Ng and the phosphorylation level of Ng, thus affecting the affinity between Ng and calmodulin (CaM). The adjustment and modulation of Ca2+-CaM complex to CaMK\u2161 were also impacted, inhibiting the formation of LTP and damaging learning and memory.",

The DGGE fingerprints indicated that as the organic loading rate of the reactor increased and the operating time elapsed, the eubacterial community was kept stable relatively, while the archaeal community was changed significantly, which resulted in the gradual decrease of the archaeal varieties.

The results indicate that as the OLR increased from 1.5 kg/(m3 x d) to 10.0 kg/(m3 x d), the microbial communities of archaea and eubacteria in the 6 sludge samples are not changed greatly. The archaea population is highly similar among the 6 samples. The Shannon indexes of archaea population are 5.51, 5.88, 5.47, 5.25, 5.32 and 5.11, respectively. Except the seed sludge, the eubacteria population is similar among the other 5 samples. The Shannon indexes of eubacteria population are 2.97, 5.07, 5.44, 6.38, 6.66 and 5.21, respectively. The dominant archaea in the 6 granular samples are Methanobacterium, Methanocorpusculum, Methanosaeta and Methanospirillum. As the OLR of the reactor increased and the operation time elapsed, Methanocorpusculum parvum and Methanospirillum hungatei, both are hydrotrophic methanogens, become the dominant archaea. The archaea content in the samples decreases slightly at the beginning, but increases later and finally reaches to a level obviously higher than that in the seed sludge.",

The mesophilic reactor, a CSTR, was operated over 4 months by seeding with river sediments and feeding with glucose solution, in which the highest hydrogen production rate was 8.6 L/(L x d) and the substrate hydrogen production molar ratio (H2/glucose) was 1.98. After seeded with anaerobic methanogenic granules, a UASB reactor was thermophilically operated by feeding with sucrose solution and during its steady operation period, the hydrogen production rate was 6.8 L/(L x d) and the substrate hydrogen production molar ratio (H2/sucrose) was 3.6. Within the produced gas, the H2 percentages were about 43% and others were CO2, no methane could be detected. Thermophilic hydrogen-producing granules were successfully cultivated in the UASB reactor, which were grey-white in color, the diameters were about 0.8 - 1.2 mm, and typical settling velocities were about 30 - 40 m/h. Through SEM a great number of bacilli could be found on the surface of the granules which made the surface rough. Total DNA of these two hydrogen production sludges were extracted and purified, and the PCR and DGGE process were conducted, the results indicate that most of the eubacteria in two sludges are the same, but the dominant species are obviously different with each other.",

        "abstract": "A lab-scale EGSB reactor fed by artificial brewery wastewater was operated under 20\u00b0C continuously, and its process performance, characteristics of granular sludge, microbial community structure were investigated. The results indicated that: (1) After 184 days' operation, the organic loading rate of EGSB reactor could reach 10 kg/(m 3\u00b7d) at HRT of about 18 h, the COD removal efficiencies were above 85%, and the specific biogas production was about 0.58 m 3 per kilogram COD removed. (2) As the organic loading rate increased, the average diameter of the granule increased, and the settling velocity increased too, but when the loading rate reached about 10 kg/(m 3\u00b7d), the granular average diameter decreased slightly. Compared with the granular sludge operated at mesophilic condition, the ECP contents especially the protein contents in the granular sludge operated at 20\u00b0C increased obviously. (3) Compared with the seed sludge, the main Archaea (methanogenes) species in the sludge samples operated at different loading rates under 20\u00b0C did not change greatly, but the dominant methanogenes in the sludge operated under 15\u00b0C for 6 months seeded with the same mesophilic sludge changed obviously.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the capability of first-pass volume perfusion computed tomography (PCT) for differentiation of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) and to compare that of combination of PCT and routine CT with CT alone for the differentiation.Our institutional review board approved this study and informed consent was obtained. With nine excluded, 65 consecutive patients having a SPN with histopathologic proof or follow-up underwent a 30s PCT using the deconvolution model were evaluated. Kruskal-Wallis tests and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis were underwent. Four radiologists assessed nodules independently and retrospectively. Diagnostic capability was compared for CT alone and PCT plus CT. ROC analysis, McNemar test, and weighted kappa statistics were performed.Significant differences were found in parameters between malignant and benign nodules (p<0.0001 for blood flow, blood volume, and permeability surface area product), SPNs were more likely to be malignant by using threshold values of more than 55 ml/100 g/min, 2.5 ml/100 g, and 10 ml/100 g/min, respectively. PCT plus CT was significantly better in overall sensitivity (93%, p=0.004) and accuracy (94%, p=0.003) compared to CT alone, not specificity (96%). Area under the curve for ROC analyses of PCT plus CT was significantly larger than that of CT alone (p=0.018). Mean weighted kappa for PCT plus CT was 0.715, that for CT alone was 0.447.Volume first-pass PCT can distinguish SPNs. Using PCT plus routine CT may be more sensitive and accurate for differentiating malignant from benign nodules than CT alone and allows more confidence and constancy.",

Methods 382 patients were included in the study and successively underwent 16-slice CTA examination for suspected cere- bral aneurysms. Using maximum-intensity projections and volume-rendering techniques, two neuroradiologists performed the morphology, size and location of the aneurysms, neck geometry, and the relationship of aneurysms to bone structures and adjacent branch vessels. Sixteen-slice CTA images were used to determine whether the aneurysm was suitable for endovascular treatment or whether a surgical procedure was preferable. Results 223 cerebral aneurysms were identified in 203 of the 382 patients. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 16-slice CTA in detecting all aneurysms were 97.8%, 97.8%, and 97.8, respectively, on a per-aneurysm basis. There was no statistically significant difference in accuracy between 16-slice CTA and DSA. 136 aneurysms were suitable for endovascular coiling by using the 16-slice CTA images, and 132 aneurysms were success- fully treated by endovascular coiling. Forty-eight aneurysms were suitable for surgical clipping, and all aneurysms were deemed completely occluded during surgical clipping. Conclusion Sixteen-slice CTA is a highly accurate imaging examination for the diagnosis of cerebral aneurysms, and it can provide sufficient diagnostic information in guiding the treatment of aneurysms.",

In addition, the ReHo differences were demonstrated in superior frontal gyrus (Z = 3.21), middle frontal gyrus (Z = 3.19, Z = 3.22), medial frontal gyrus (Z = 3.15), lingual gyrus (Z = 3.43) and cerebellum (Z = 3.11, Z = 2.97) increased more in 12 years old group (12 vs 10, 12 vs 8). And the precuneus (Z = 2.95) and posterior cingulate (Z = 2.64) had increasing ReHo values with the age growth (12 vs 8).The function of execution control, accommodation of attention, visual spatial integration and default mode network became gradually developed with increasing age.",

The clinical features and CT findings of both with regard to the size, contour, margin, growth type, contrast enhancement pattern, contrast enhanced degree,presence or absence of ulcer were retrospectively reviewed and the latter were compared by two experienced radiologists\u3002The statistical significance was evaluated by using 95% confidence interval,one-way ANOVA, q test and chi square test.Results The diameter of benign GISTs were significantly smaller than that of gastrointestinal schwannomas and malignant GIST (mean\u00b1SD, 3.6\u00b1 1.27, 6.0\u00b12.49, 7.8\u00b13.56, respectively) (P<0.05). The contour was round or oval in most of both gastrointestinal schwannomas and benign GISTs (83.3% and 80%, respectively), but lobulated in malignant GISTs (84%). There was significant difference in shape between gastrointestinal schwannomas and GISTs. Growth types in schwannomas and GISTs were diverse as endoluminal, exogastric, or both, with no statistical difference (P>0.05). There was significant difference in model and extent of enhancement between gastrointestinal schwannomas, benign GISTs and malignant GISTs (P<0.05). Ulcer in malignant GISTs (28%)was more common than that in gastrointestinal schwannomas,(25%), benign GISTs (20%), but without statistical difference (P> 0.05). Conclusion Most gastrointestinal schwannomas are appeared as round, and homogeneous solid tumors with slight or nonenhancement on CT, these CT findings are very similar to those of benign GISTs, but distinguishable from those of malignant GISTs.",

        "abstract": "End-stage renal disease and dialysis patients have a higher incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) than the general population. Preoperatively evaluating the biological behavior of RCC plays an important role in treatment decision-making. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) can visualize the distribution of microvenous structures and hemorrhage without contrast materials.To evaluate the feasibility of SWI in grading clear cell RCCs (CRCC) and compare the ability of SWI and necrosis for grading CRCCs.Retrospective reviews of 35 patients with pathologically-proven CRCCs were performed. All patients underwent both conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and SWI examinations. The morphology of the intratumoral susceptibility signal intensities (ITSS) was classified into hemorrhage and microvessels. The differences of ITSSs on SWI and necrosis between low- and high-grade CRCCs were assessed. The diagnostic values of ITSSs and necrosis in differentiating low- from high-grade CRCCs were compared by receiver-operating characteristics.ITSSs were seen in 31 of 35 patients. No ITSSs were seen in four patients with low-grade CRCCs. Mean scores of ITSSs on SWI were significantly lower for low-grade CRCCs (1.24\u2009\u00b1\u20090.72) than that for the high-grade CRCCs (2.70\u2009\u00b1\u20090.48). No significant necrosis was seen in 10 patients with low-grade CRCCs. There was a significant difference of the presence of intratumoral necrosis between low- and high-grade CRCCs. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were for ITSSs: 70%, 100%, 100%, and 89.3%, respectively; for necrosis: 100%, 40%, 40%, and 100%.SWI can evaluate ITSSs without contrast materials and can be an alternative to grading CRCCs preoperatively for some special patients.",

Rabbits from control and Group A underwent abdominal MR imaging (MRI), MRE, and DWI. In Group A, random eight rabbits underwent MRI examinations at 4, 5, 6, 10 weeks after carbon tetrachloride oil subcutaneous injection. Liver stiffness (LS) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of liver parenchyma were measured. The diagnostic performance of MRE and DWI for staging HF was compared using the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis on the basis of the histopathological analysis of HF.Significant differences of LS and DWI values were present among HF stages (P < 0.005). The LS values measured on MRE (r = 0.838, P < 0.001) were more strongly correlated with the HF stages than with ADC values (r = -0.527, P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of LS were significantly larger than those of DWI were for discriminating two stages of HF (0.979 vs. 0.712 for \u2265 S1, 0.922 vs. 0.699 for \u2265 S2). MRE showed higher specificity for predicting all stages of HF compared to DWI.MRE more strongly correlated with the HF stages than DWI and is more specific in predicting all HF stages.",

Methods 471 consecutive patients underwent CTA and DSA for suspected intracranial aneurysms. CTA and DSA images were reviewed by two independent neuroradiologists. DSA or surgical findings or both were considered as the ultimate reference standard against which the diagnostic accuracy of CTA and DSA were compared. Results The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of multislice CTA in detecting all aneurysms were 97.0%,98.3% and 97.6%, respectively, on a per-aneurysm basis. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of detecting aneurysms on multislice CTA on a per-aneurysm basis were 98.5% and 96.6%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in sensitivity between multislice CTA and DSA (P>0.05). Conclusion Multislice CTA has a very high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of detecting aneurysms, and it is sensitive enough to replace conventional DSA in the triage and diagnosis in patients with intracranial aneurysms.",

Methods: Animal models of lymph node metastasis were divided into irradiation group (16 lymph nodes) and control groups (10 lymph nodes). MRI and DWI were performed respectively before and 1, 3, and 7 days after irradiation in all rabbits. The volumes and ADC values of lymph nodes were measured, and the variants were evaluated with repeated measures ANOV. At each time interval, the Student's t test was used to assess differences between two groups. Results: In irradiation group, necrosis was found in 4 nodes 7 days after therapy. Necrosis revealed hypointensity on T1WI and hyperintensity on T2WI. ADC values of all nodes adopted irradiation decreased 1 day after therapy (1.04\u00b10.17)\u00d710 -3 mm 2/s, then ADC values increased gradually ([1.27\u00b10.20]\u00d710 -3 mm 2/s and [1.69\u00b10.33]\u00d710 -3 mm 2/s) 3 days and 7 days later. Significant difference of variation of ADC values between two groups present 7 days after therapy (F=17.87, P<0.05). In irradiation group, 3 and 7 days after therapy, ADC values were significantly higher than pre-treatment and 1 day after therapy (both P<0.05). Conclusion: ADC values can be used to observe early radiation response in animal models.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To evaluate the clinical value of diffusion weighted imaging(DWI) in the diagnosis of breast lesions,and the relationship of apparent diffusion coefficient(ADC) value with the estrogen receptors(ER) in breast cancer patients.Methods:Thirty-two female patients(age ranged from 29 to 61 years,mean 45 years,) with histopathologically confirmed breast lesions were enrolled,including 17 cases of breast carcinomas.Routine MRI protocol and DWI with echo planar imaging were performed on a Siemens Verio 3.0T scanner,and the b-values of 50,800s/mm2 were applied.The t-test was used for testing the difference of ADC values between benign and malignant groups.ROC curve was deduced to test the diagnostic efficiency of ADC.The sensitivity,specificity of ADC for the diagnosis of breast lesions were calculated.Results:The ADC values of malignant lesions[1.12\u00b10.20)\u00d710-3mm2/s] were markedly lower than that of benign lesions [(1.49\u00b10.25)\u00d710-3mm2/s,t=-0.52,P<0.001].The sensitivity,specificity of malignant diagnosis with the ADC threshold of 1.25\u00d710-3mm2/s were 88.2%,86.7% respectively.Area under ROC was 0.943.The median ADC value in the ER-positive group[(1.07\u00b10.09)\u00d710-3mm2/s] was not significant different to that in the ER-negative group [(1.18\u00b10.12)\u00d710-3mm2/s;t=-2.12,P=0.051)].Conclusion: DWI is helpful to differentiate benign and malignant breast lesions,and the ADC value is especially useful.But the ADC value do not reflect ER(+) or ER(-) in breast cancer patients.",

Methods In a prospective study, 65 consecutive patients treated with detachable coils underwent DSA and MRA at 1.5T wtih a follow-up range from 3 to 12 months after coil placement. MRA images were evaluated for presence of aneurysm remnants, and DSA results were considered as a reference standard. Results The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MRA for the residual aneurysms were 80% (95% confidence interval (CI): 51.9\uff5e95.7%),100% (97.5% CI: 93.5\uff5e100%) and 95. 7% (95% CI: 88.0\uff5e99.1%), respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 94.8%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in accuracy between MRA and DSA. Conclusion MRA at 1.5T is an accurate and noninvasive imaging examination in the follow-up of patients with cerebral aneurysms treated with coil placement.",

Methods: Twenty new zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into two groups with 10 rabbits in each group. According to the grouping, the inflammatory (benign group, totally 10 nodes) and metastatic (malignant group, totally 16 nodes) lymph nodes were established respectively. All the rabbits were examined with conventional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the muscle were measured by two radiologists with three different sizes of region of interest (ROI) in order to evaluate the repeatability of muscles used as the reference organ. ADC values of benign, malignant lymph nodes and the contralateral quadriceps were obtained, and rADC values of benign nodes to muscles and malignant nodes to muscles were calculated. The statistical analysis was performed. Results: Muscles revealed good repeatability when ROI included 5 pixels. Statistical differences of ADC and rADC values in nodes were found between benign and malignant groups (all P<0.05). When using ADC value to differentiate benign and malignant nodes, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.82, and the threshold of ADC value was 0.88\u00d710 -3 mm 2/s, while the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy was 86.67%, 80.00% and 84.00%, respectively. When rADC value was used for differentiating, the AUC was 0.97, while the threshold was 0.64 and the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy was 93.33%, 90.00%, and 92.00%, respectively. Conclusion: Muscles revealed good repeatability as a reference organ when appropriate ROI was selected. Using rADC values can differentiate benign and malignant lymph nodes more accurately than ADC values in rabbit models.",

Some studies have confirmed DWI can detect the early changes of tumors that have originated from various organs, even after treatment.To compare the usefulness of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and morphologic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for monitoring the therapeutic response of metastatic disease in lymph nodes to radiotherapy.Twenty-six rabbits (metastatic, n = 17; non-metastatic, n = 9) were divided into group A (metastatic, n = 10), group B (metastatic, n = 7) and group C (non-metastatic, n = 9). Groups A and C underwent irradiation, whereas group B was set as a reference. Standard MR imaging and DWI were performed before and 1, 3, and 7 days after radiotherapy for all rabbits. The lymph node volumes and ADCs were measured and evaluated with repeated measures ANOVA. The difference between group A and B was analyzed using Student's t-test.In all rabbits, a total of 35 lymph nodes were found, including 16 nodes in group A, 10 in group B and nine in group C. In group A, 3 and 7 days after therapy ADCs were significantly higher than pre-treatment and 1 day after therapy (P < 0.05). For groups A and B, a significant difference of ADCs was present 7 days after therapy. A significant difference of variation of ADCs among the three groups was also present (P < 0.001).DWI is superior to morphological MRI in monitoring early radiation response in animal models.",

The design and fabrication of a high-performance electrode material based on cobalt disulfide/reduced graphene oxide (CoS2/RGO) nanocomposites is reported by a one-step hydrothermal method. Benefiting from its structural advantages, namely, large amount of exposed surface, fast charge transfer, and synergistic effect between CoS2 and RGO, the as-prepared nanocomposites are exploited as a catalyst for the HER. The results indicate that CoS2/RGO-5 % exhibits the best performance of hydrogen evolution and the smallest overpotential of 159 mV to achieve a 15 mA cm\u22122 current density, possessing the easiest releasing of hydrogen gas and the highest charge transfer rate, as well as remarkable stability.",

Because water molecules tend to build hydrogen bonds with the amine, carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups of UiO-66-NH/GO hierarchical structure, the hierarchical structure can easily capture water and tightly lock the water to build a stable water layer on the steel mesh surface and block oil in contact with the steel mesh. Therefore, the obtained hierarchical structured steel mesh exhibits super-hydrophilicity, underwater super-oleophobicity, excellent oil resistance and outstanding oil/water separation performance with a superior high permeating flux (54,500\u2009L m \u2009h) and rejection (>99.9%) under gravity force, indicating the mesh possesses great potential for treating oily wastewater.",

The DFT calculations demonstrate that the porous C2N monolayer is stable enough to be used as a gas separation membrane and the porous C2N monolayer with a suitable pore size presents a surmountable energy barrier (0.13 eV) for He molecules passing through the membrane. Furthermore, the porous C2N monolayer shows an exceptionally high selectivity for He/Ne (Ar, CH4, CO2, N2, etc.) in a wide range of temperatures. Besides, using MD simulations we demonstrate that the porous C2N monolayer exhibits a He permeance of 1 \u00d7 107 GPU at room temperature, which is much higher than the value (20 GPU) in current industrial applications. Therefore, the porous C2N monolayer should be an excellent candidate for He separation from natural gas, due to its high selectivity and excellent permeability.",

        "abstract": "We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to show that a DNA-like double helix of two poly(acetylene) (PA) chains can form inside single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). The computational results indicate that SWNTs can activate and guide the self-assembly of polymer chains, allowing them to adopt a helical configuration in a SWNT through the combined action of the van der Waals potential well and the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction between the polymer and the inner surface of SWNTs. Meanwhile both the SWNT size and polymer chain stiffness determine the outcome of the nanostructure. Furthermore, we also found that water clusters encourage the self-assembly of PA helical structures in the tube. This molecular model may lead to a better understanding of the formation of a double helix biological molecule inside SWNTs. Alternatively, it could form the basis of a novel nanoscale material by utilizing the 'empty' spaces of SWNTs.",

N 2 adsorption shows that the specific surface area of the porous carbons prepared amounts to approximate 2 000 m 2\u00b7 g -1, and that mesopore size and volume increase with the rise of carbonization temperature. Typical meso-structured porous carbon can be prepared when carbonization temperature is higher than 800 \u00b0C. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that MgC-800 and MgC-900 possess good capacitive behavior. Compared to hard-templated OMC, MgC-800 and MgC-900 have lager specific capacitance within the applied current densities in this work, which can be ascribed to their large surface area and mesoporous structure that favors fast electrolyte diffusion in the pore channels.",

        "abstract": "Ultramicroporous carbon materials with uniform pore size accurately adjusted to the dimension of electrolyte ions or CO2 molecule are highly desirable for maximizing specific capacitance and CO2 uptake. However, efficient ways to fine-tuning ultramicropore size at angstrom level are scarce. A completely new approach to precisely tuning carbon ultramicropore size at sub-angstrom level is proposed herein. Due to the varying activating strength and size of the alkali ions, the ultramicropore size can be finely tuned in the range of 0.60\u20130.76 nm as the activation ion varies from Li+ to Cs+. The carbons prepared by direct pyrolysis of alkali salts of carboxylic phenolic resins yield ultrahigh capacitances of up to 223 F g-1 (205 F cm-3) in ionic liquid electrolyte, and superior CO2 uptake of 5.20 mmol g-1 at 1.0 bar and 25 \u00b0C. Such outstanding performance of the finely tuned carbons lies in its adjustable pore size perfectly adapted to the electrolyte ions and CO2 molecule. This work paves the way for a new route to finely tuning ultramicropore size at the sub-angstrom level in carbon materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Porous carbon spheres are prepared by direct carbonization of potassium salt of resorcinol\u2013formaldehyde resin spheres, and are investigated as CO 2  adsorbents. It is found that the prepared carbon materials still maintain the typical spherical shapes after the activation, and have highly developed ultra-microporosity with uniform pore size, indicating that almost the activation takes place in the interior of the polymer spheres. The narrow-distributed ultra-micropores are attributed to the \u201cin-situ homogeneous activation\u201d effect produced by the mono-dispersed potassium ions as a form of \u2013OK groups in the bulk of polymer spheres. The CS-1 sample prepared under a KOH/resins weight ratio of 1 shows a very high CO 2  capture capacity of 4.83\u00a0mmol/g and good CO 2 /N 2  selectivity of \u223c17\u201345. We believe that the presence of a well-developed ultra-microporosity is responsible for excellent CO 2  sorption performance at room temperature and ambient pressure.",

        "abstract": "The lithium/fluorinated carbon (Li/CFx) battery is a widely used solid-state lithium primary battery (LPB) with the highest ever known specific energy. However, the scarcity of lithium resources compels researchers to explore other types of batteries. Sodium batteries have been considered as the most suitable candidate power sources due to the low cost of sodium and its similar chemistry to lithium. In this work, we prepared two series of fluorinated carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are fluorinated common CNTs (FCNT-x) and fluorinated graphitized CNTs (FGCNT-x). The effects of graphitization of the CNTs on the structure of fluorinated carbon nanotubes and C\u2013F bonding are systematically studied. FGCNT-x prepared from the graphitized CNTs exhibit a lower ratio of F/C and weaker C\u2013F bonding than those of the FCNT-x prepared from ordinary CNTs at the same fluorination temperature. FGCNT-0.81 exhibits very high specific capacities of 798.8 and 751 mA h g\u22121 in lithium and sodium primary batteries, nearly reaching the theoretical capacity calculated using the F/C ratio. Besides, FGCNT-0.81 possesses a maximum energy density of 2006.6 W h kg\u22121 in Li/CFx batteries and 1733.4 W h kg\u22121 in Na/CFx batteries. The maximum power density for Li/CFx and Na/CFx batteries could reach up to 3861.1 (FCNT-0.81) and 1863.9 W h kg\u22121 (FGCNT-0.81), respectively. It is proved that the binding energy of the C\u2013F bond, the electronegativity and the polarization force of the metal ions collaboratively determine the electrochemical performance of the fluorinated CNTs. The new-type Na/CFx primary batteries developed here are promising in low power applications such as high-energy density and low-cost batteries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) is one of the most promising electrode material for supercapacitor. However, pure OMCs have low specific capacitance due to its simplex storage mechanism based on electric double layer. In this work, anthraquinone (AQ) is used as a modifier to boost the capacitance of OMCs. The modified materials (AQ/OMCs) can not only provide mesoporous channels facilitating rapid ion diffusion, but also generate extra pseudocapacitance improving specific capacitance greatly. As evidenced by electrochemical measurements, AQ/OMCs can exhibit specific capacitance as high as 346\u00a0F\u00a0g \u22121  in 1\u00a0M H 2 SO 4  electrolyte at the current density of 0.5\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121 . Besides, the AQ/OMCs also possess excellent rate performance with capacitance retention ratio of up to 84.3% even at a very high current density of 30\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121 . The outstanding capacitive performance of AQ/OMCs can be ascribed to the synergic effect between OMCs and AQ, in which ordered mesoporous channels facilitate rapid ion diffusion, and AQ generates large pseudocapacitance. In addition, asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled using AQ/OMCs and OMC as negative and positive electrode, respectively, which can deliver a very high energy density of 14.51\u00a0Wh kg \u22121  and excellent long-term cycle stability, retaining 96.3% of initial capacitance, after 10,000 cycles.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In the present contribution, a single step H 2 -reduction strategy was developed for the first time to fabricate nickel-based KIT-6 (Ni-KIT-6) for adsorptive desulfurization of fuels. As-synthesized KIT-6 was used as a support and nickel nitrate, nickel chloride and nickel acetate as a nickel precursor was directly introduced into as-synthesized KIT-6. Ni 0 -based KIT-6 was obtained by single-step H 2 -reduction strategy which not only remove template and decompose nickel precursors to NiO but also reduce NiO to Ni 0 . This strategy is much more convenient and facile than reported strategies for Ni-based mesoporous silica KIT-6. Characterization results show that Ni-KIT-6 with nickel content up to 30\u00a0wt.% was highly dispersed due to silanols and confined space in as-synthesized KIT-6. The percentage content (54%) of Ni 0  in the as-synthesized KIT-6 is higher than Ni-based calcined KIT-6 (38%). Interestingly, Ni-based as-synthesized KIT-6 prepared using nickel nitrate as a precursor exhibited stronger nickel-KIT-6 interaction, higher Ni 0  content and dispersion than those prepared with nickel chloride and nickel acetate precursors. We also demonstrate here that the shielding effect of capping anions and hydration degree of different nickel precursors significantly affect the dispersion of nickel species even using as-prepared KIT-6 as a support. As a result, Ni-KIT-6(NO 3  \u2212 ) captured 0.195 and 0.12\u00a0mmol\u00a0g \u22121  of sulfur from model fuel and FCC gasoline, respectively. Thus, single step H 2 -reduction strategy may have potential applications to be applied for fabrication of other nickel based mesoporous silicas for adsorptive desulfurization technology.",

        "abstract": "In this study, a clew-like ZnO superstructure was synthesized by a copolymer-controlled self-assembly homogeneous precipitation method. Ni was impregnated to the clew-like ZnO superstructure to obtain Ni/ZnO adsorbents. The synthesized materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, N2 sorption, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and H2-temperature programmed reduction techniques. The reactive adsorption desulfurization (RADS) performance of the adsorbents was evaluated in a fixed bed reactor using thiophene in n-octane as a model fuel. Sample Ni/ZnO-4h exhibits a remarkably high performance with a sulfur capacity of 189.1 mg S g\u20131, which is above 6 times that of the one prepared with commercial ZnO. Characterization results show that the morphology changes from micro-clews to large solid sticks with the increase of the crystallization time. The loose and open architecture of the clew-like ZnO superstructure facilitates the diffusion of reactants/products, and prevents the adsorbent particles from breakage by supplying space for the volume expansion during the RADS process. The small nanoparticles in ZnO nanostrips result in a high sulfur adsorption capacity and also favor the dispersion of Ni, leading to an excellent RADS performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Well-dispersed Au-Pt (2\u20135\u202fnm) and Au-Pd (1\u20135\u202fnm) nanoparticles (NPs) supported on mesoporous silica (meso-SiO 2 ) were prepared by a facile one-pot synthesis method using 3-mercapto(propyl)trimethoxysilane (MPTMS) to anchor metal NPs to the support. The obtained catalysts were characterized and evaluated in cyclohexane oxidation with molecular oxygen. The bimetallic NPs catalysts prepared in this work exhibited a high stability with enhanced dispersion because of the intercalation of the metal alloy NPs in the meso-SiO 2  channels via the anchoring effect of MPTMS. The generation of surface Au \u03b4\u2212  species in Au-Pt and Au-Pd catalysts was identified due to the alloying of Au with Pt and Pd. Although the electronic modification of Au atoms weakened the capability of Au for O 2  activation and leads to lower cyclohexane conversions on bimetallic catalysts, the deep oxidation reactions were reduced and a higher selectivity of desired products, K/A oil (cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone) was achieved. This work demonstrates an effective preparation method to improve the stability and surface chemical modification of Au NP catalysts, which provides general implications for other noble metal NPs catalysts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Unusual nickel dispersion in the micro-environment of as-synthesized SBA-15 was achieved for the first time by one-pot reduction strategy. Template occluded SBA-15 was used as a host and Ni(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O salt precursor was directly introduced into the micro-environment between the aggregates of template and silica walls. The subsequent one-pot reduction strategy plays three functions in one by decomposing Ni(NO 3 ) 2  to NiO, template P123 removal, and reduction of NiO to Ni 0 . This solvent-free technique is not only time and energy efficient but also well-disperse large amount, 30\u00a0wt%, of Ni 0  species in mesoporous channels as verified by various characterization techniques. In comparison with traditional strategies, our method is much convenient for N 0 -based adsorbents, and the yield of N 0  is 75% in the case of NiAS-30 derived from as-prepared SBA-15, which is apparently higher than 65% of NiCS-30 counterpart obtained from calcined SBA-15. The synthesized materials are highly active in adsorptive desulfurization of thiophene due to strong acidity and the adsorbed amount over NiAS-30 reach 0.22\u00a0mmol/g much better than NiCS-30 (0.12\u00a0mmol/g). More importantly, the thiophene capture abilities were recovered without any loss. Convenient synthesis, high activity, good stability and reusability made the present materials highly promising in adsorptive desulfurization technologies.",

        "abstract": "The deposition of appreciable amounts of metal poisons and carbon poses serious problems to the refiner during fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit operation. To check the effects of these contaminants on the catalyst, an in-depth understanding of their locations and existing states becomes necessary. In this work, the location and nature of vanadium, nickel, and coke species on the FCC catalyst were investigated. Detailed analyses of catalyst samples, including industrial equilibrium catalysts (E-cats), were accomplished using a variety of characterization techniques. It was found that nickel and vanadium concentrated mainly in meso- and micropores of the FCC catalyst, respectively. On the surface of E-cats, vanadium exists mainly in +4 and +5 oxidation states, while nickel is present as NiO, NiAl2O4, and surface nickel hydrosilicates and as NiO and NiAl2O4 in the bulk. The formation of a large amount of NiAl2O4 on the alumina support by nickel indicates its preferential location in the alumina component ...",

        "abstract": "A new matrix material for the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst was prepared using the zeolite Y mother liquor to modify the surface acidity of \u03b3-Al2O3. The modified \u03b3-Al2O3 was characterized using a variety of techniques, and the relationship between surface acidity and catalytic performances in the catalytic cracking of vacuum gas oil (VGO) was correlated. Characterization results showed that Bronsted acid sites derived mainly from isolated silanol groups, which increased on modified \u03b3-Al2O3, while Lewis acid sites reduced dramatically after modification. Correlation results indicated that increased Bronsted acid sites effectively improved the conversion of VGO. In addition, new medium strong acid sites engendered at the interfaces of \u03b3-Al2O3/amorphous silica\u2013alumina or \u03b3-Al2O3/zeolite Y played a critical role in determining the final product distribution, leading to yields of gasoline and liquefied petroleum gas higher than those of the pure \u03b3-Al2O3 derived catalyst.",

Thus, modified \u03b3-Al2O3 as a matrix material was used in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts, and its performance of cracking vacuum gas oil (VGO) was evaluated. In comparsion with unmodified \u03b3-Al2O3, the modified matrix material exhibited superior catalytic performance with heavy oil conversion increased by 5.64%, enhancing the gasoline yield by 2.19% and the LPG yield by 3.00%. Characterization results indicated that the zeolite Y SDA modification effectively introduced Si species into the framework of \u03b3-Al2O3. The interaction between hydroxyl groups on silanol and Al\u2013OH led to the formation of bridged hydroxyl groups (Si\u2013OH\u2013Al), which are the origin of medium-strength Bronsted acid sites on the modified alumina matrix accounting for the enhanced catalytic performance of FCC catalysts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Increasing concerns about the atmospheric CO 2  concentration and its impact on the environment promote developing new materials and technologies for efficient CO 2  capture and conversion. Here, for the first time we investigate the CO 2  adsorption on C 3 N nanosheet with different charge states by means of density functional theory calculations. It is found that injecting extra negative electrons instead of positive electrons can extremely improve CO 2  adsorption capacity of C 3 N nanomaterial. The adsorption strength of CO 2  molecules on this 3\u202fe \u2212  negatively charged nanomaterial is 20 times of that on neutral surface while there is little difference between these on positively charged surface and the neutral surface. Interestingly, CO 2  molecules can spontaneously adsorb and desorb from C 3 N sorbent with appropriate charge density range by injecting and removing extra negative charges. Importantly, this negatively charged C 3 N exhibits highly selective adsorption for CO 2 /C 2 H 2 , CO 2 /CH 4 , CO 2 /H 2 , C 2 H 2 /CH 4  and C 2 H 2 /H 2  mixtures through tuning charge density. Our theoretical results could provide guidance for designing high-capacity and high-selectivity CO 2  capture materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Separation of light hydrocarbons (C1-C3) is extremely significant since these are alternative energy resources and raw materials in the industrial process. In this work, we have examined the performance of S-graphite slit pore in selective separation of CH 4  over C 2 H 2 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 6  and C 3 H 8  using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo calculations. Generally, its C3/C1 selectivity is higher than C2/C1 selectivity. Exactly, at 300\u202fK and 1\u202fbar, the selectivity is around 13, 17 and 18 for CH 4 /C 2 H 2 , CH 4 /C 2 H 4  and CH 4 /C 2 H 6  while it is about 63 and 70 for CH 4 /C 3 H 6  and CH 4 /C 3 H 8 , respectively. Importantly, we have found that the optimum pore size is 0.65\u202fnm for CH 4 /C 2 H 2  and CH 4 /C 2 H 4 , 0.75\u202fnm for CH 4 /C 2 H 6 , which is smaller than that (1.0\u202fnm) for CH 4 /C 3 H 6  and CH 4 /C 3 H 8 . Besides, density functional theory calculations demonstrate the remarkable selective separation of CH 4  over C 2 H 2 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 6  and C 3 H 8  of S-graphite slit pore is attributed to its stronger interactions with C 2 H 2 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 6  and C 3 H 8  molecule than CH 4  molecule due to the larger polarizability of C2 and C3 molecules, which also manifests that S-graphite slit pore is an extremely promising candidate for separating light hydrocarbons.",

Among all the defective S/N-graphite slit-pores, it is found that the doped sites of S and N atoms affect slightly on CO2 uptake of graphite slit-pore. More importantly, the increasing ratio of S/N enhances the selective CO2 adsorption. For example, at 300 K and 1 bar, the full N-graphite slit-pore with SW 5577 has a CO2 uptake of 79.77 mmol/mol with good CO2/H2 selectivity (\u223c356) whereas full S-graphite slit-pore with SW 5577 possesses a considerable CO2 uptake of 104.66 mmol/mol with excellent CO2/H2 selectivity (\u223c526).

Therefore, in this study, we report a comprehensive investigation of CO2, CH4, H2, C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6 on different Me\u2013N\u2013C nanosheets with different charge densities via density functional theory calculations. Our results demonstrate that CO2 is weakly absorbed on neutral and positively charged Me\u2013N\u2013C monolayer, whereas CO2 adsorption strength can be dramatically strengthened on a negatively charged Me\u2013N\u2013C monolayer, especially the Fe\u2013N\u2013C nanosheet.

        "abstract": "Abstract   A nanofibrous polyacrylonitrile membrane decorated with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) of UiO-66-NH 2  is prepared via a simple and flexible self-assemble method. It is found that the membrane shows high-efficiency separation performance of oil-water emulsions, due to the hydrophilic carboxyl and amino groups of UiO-66-NH 2  and the gaps between neighboring UiO-66-NH 2 . Remarkably, solely driven by gravity (\u223c0.01\u202fbar), the obtained membrane can effectively separate oil-water emulsions with an excellent separation efficiency (u003e99%, TOC\u202f \u22122 \u202fh \u22121 ). It is demonstrated that the hydrophilic carboxyl and amino groups of UiO-66-NH 2  enhance the superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity of the membrane so as to greatly improve the antifouling properties of the membrane. Besides, because the size of gaps between neighboring UiO-66-NH 2  is mostly much smaller than that of oil drops and the UiO-66-NH 2  are underwater oleophobic, the oil drops hardly enter the gaps between neighboring UiO-66-NH 2  so that the gaps provide much more water flow tunnels, which obviously enhance the flux of the membrane. In this study, we present a new avenue of building MOFs loaded nanofibrous membrane with excellent oil-water separation performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   An environmental-friendly stainless steel mesh (SSM) decorated with polydopamine (PDA) and graphene oxide (GO) for oil/water mixture separation was successfully fabricated via a facile dipping coating method. PDA particles were firstly modified on the mesh surface by the self-polymerization of dopamine. Then, GO was firmly anchored onto the surface of PDA particles through the covalent bonds or electrostatic interaction between GO and PDA. Finally, a SSM/PDA/GO multilevel structure was prepared, which shows superior hydrophilicity and excellent anti-fouling properties due to the hydrophilic functional groups and a thicker water layer confined inside SSM/PDA/GO multilevel structure. Therefore, the as-prepared SSM/PDA/GO mesh with a large oil intrusion pressure (u003e3\u202fkPa) can separate oil/water mixture with ultra-high flux (\u223c15,000\u202fL\u202fm \u22122 \u202fh \u22121 ), preferable separation efficiency (u003e99.95%) and outstanding recyclability. Furthermore, the SSM/PDA/GO possesses superior stability under harsh environmental conditions, which indicates that the mesh is a promising candidate for practical oil spill cleanup in harsh conditions, especially in high salty marine environment.",

Besides, the one-sided N-CNS shows excellent CO 2  uptake and impressive CO 2 /N 2  selectivity, for example, the one-sided N-CNS with 22.2\u00a0wt% nitrogen has an ultra-high CO 2  uptake of 18.21\u00a0mmol/g with good CO 2 /N 2  selectivity (\u223c63), and one-sided N-CNS with 12.6\u00a0wt% nitrogen possesses a considerable CO 2  uptake of 8.70\u00a0mmol/g with excellent CO 2 /N 2  selectivity (\u223c163) at 300\u00a0K and 1\u00a0bar. The high CO 2  uptake is attributed to the strong interaction between one-sided N-CNS and CO 2  molecules and its tunable space. Because one-sided N-CNS has greater interactions with CO 2  molecules than N 2  molecules, due to the quadrupole moment of CO 2  molecules, it shows the impressive selectivity of CO 2 /N 2 . One-sided N-CNS with excellent CO 2  uptake and impressive CO 2 /N 2  selectivity should be a promising sorbent for selective CO 2  capture from flue gas.",

It was observed that the Pt-SnO 2  NFs were comprised of strings of tiny SnO 2  nanoparticles decorated with Pt and PtO nanoparticles, resulting in the formation of PtO/SnO 2  heterojunction and high porosity. And then, we studied the methane (CH 4 ) sensing performance of the sensors fabricated from these NFs and found that 20\u00a0mol% Pt-SnO 2  NFs exhibited excellent CH 4  sensing properties over a temperature range of 100\u2013350\u00a0\u00b0C, for example, the 20\u00a0mol% Pt-SnO 2  NFs showed an obvious response of 1.11\u20131\u00a0ppm CH 4  at 350\u00a0\u00b0C, which was 2 orders of magnitude lower than the minimum detection limit of the current SnO 2  based CH 4  sensors. The great enhancement of the CH 4  sensing properties of Pt-SnO 2  NFs can be understood by the PtO/SnO 2  heterogeneous sensitization and Pt catalytic effect. Our findings present a novel strategy for the application of SnO 2  based NFs in highly effective CH 4  detection.",

In this paper, we theoretically explored the H 2  separation performance of graphitic carbon oxide (g-C 2 O) monolayer. The van-der-Waals-corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that g-C 2 O monolayer is chemically inert to the studied gas molecules (H 2 , CO 2 , CO, N 2 , and CH 4 ), and with a suitable pore size, the g-C 2 O monolayer shows an exceptionally high selectivity for H 2 /CO 2  (CO, N 2 , and CH 4 ) in a wide range of temperatures. In addition, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations yield a high H 2  permeance for the g-C 2 O monolayer at room temperature. With excellent selectivity and ultrahigh permeance, the g-C 2 O monolayer has great potential application in H 2  separation.",

In this work, we develop a new model of CN pores based on GCMC calculations to describe its CO adsorption capacity and selectivity. Remarkably, it exhibits an outstanding CO adsorption capacity and selectivity. For example, at 0.15 bar it shows exceptionally high CO uptakes of 3.99 and 2.07 mmol/g with good CO/CO, CO/H, and CO/CH selectivity at 300 and 350 K, separately. More importantly, this adsorbent also shows better water stability. Specifically, its CO uptakes are 3.80 and 5.91 mmol/g for and 0.15 and 1 bar at 300 K with a higher water content. Furthermore, DFT calculations demonstrate that the strong interactions between CN pores and CO molecules contribute to its impressive CO uptake and selectivity, indicating that CN pores can be an extremely promising candidate for CO capture.",

        "abstract": "Abstract A molecular simulation technique is employed to investigate the transport of H2/CH4 mixture through the two-dimensional (2D) channel between adjacent graphene layers. Pristine graphene membrane (GM) with pore width of 0.515~0.6 nm is found to only allow H2 molecules to enter rather than CH4, forming a molecular sieve. At pore widths of 0.64~1.366 nm, both H2 and CH4 molecules could fill into the GM channel, where the permeability of methane is more preferential than that of hydrogen with the largest CH4/H2 selectivity (1.89) at 0.728 nm. The edge functionalization by \u2013H, \u2013F, \u2013OH, \u2013NH2, and \u2013COOH groups could significantly alter gas permeability by modifying the active surface area of the pore and tuning attractive and/or repulsive interaction with molecules at the entrance of channel. At the pore width of 0.6 nm, the H2 permeability of molecular sieve is enhanced by \u2013H, \u2013F, and \u2013OH groups but restrained by \u2013NH2, especially \u2013COOH with a passing rate of zero. At pore widths of 0.64 and 0.728 nm, both \u2013H and \u2013F edge-functionalized GMs show a preferential selectivity of methane over hydrogen, while the favorable transport for GM\u2013OH is changed from H2 molecules at 0.64 nm to CH4 molecules at 0.728 nm. For GM\u2013NH2, it exhibits an excellent hydrogen molecular sieve at 0.64 nm and then turns into a significant H2/CH4 selectivity at 0.728 nm. Meanwhile, small H2 molecules start to enter the channel of GM\u2013COOH at the pore width up to 0.728 nm. For the largest pore width of 1.336 nm, the influence of edge functionalization becomes small, and a comparable CH4/H2 selectivity is observed for all the considered membranes.",

        "abstract": "To study the effect of interlayer spacing of pillared graphene oxides (GOs) on CO2 uptake, we have obtained CO2 isotherms with respect to the interlayer distance of pillared graphene oxide by both experimental and simulation methods. Interlayer distances of GO were modulated by intercalation of three kinds of diaminoalkanes with a different number of carbon atoms (NH2(CH2) n NH2, n = 4, 8, and 12) as pillars. The intercalated GOs (IGOs) and their reduced products (RIGOs) are characterized using a variety of approaches such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and N2 adsorption. Gas adsorption performance shows that the CO2 uptake of IGOs and RIGOs decrease with the increase of the interlayer distance at low pressure, while at high pressure, the adsorption capacity of IGO-12 has a larger growth than those of both IGO-4 and IGO-8 and surpasses them at 30\u00a0bar. The contribution of the electrostatics to CO2 adsorption is larger than that of van der Waals force at low pressures, whereas for the high pressures, the adsorption is dominated by van der Waals force.",

        "abstract": "To study the effect of interlayer spacing of pillared graphene oxides (GOs) on CO2 uptake, we have obtained CO2 isotherms with respect to the interlayer distance of pillared graphene oxide by both experimental and simulation methods. Interlayer distances of GO were modulated by intercalation of three kinds of diaminoalkanes with a different number of carbon atoms (NH2(CH2) n NH2, n = 4, 8, and 12) as pillars. The intercalated GOs (IGOs) and their reduced products (RIGOs) are characterized using a variety of approaches such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and N2 adsorption. Gas adsorption performance shows that the CO2 uptake of IGOs and RIGOs decrease with the increase of the interlayer distance at low pressure, while at high pressure, the adsorption capacity of IGO-12 has a larger growth than those of both IGO-4 and IGO-8 and surpasses them at 30\u00a0bar. The contribution of the electrostatics to CO2 adsorption is larger than that of van der Waals force at low pressures, whereas for the high pressures, the adsorption is dominated by van der Waals force.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Electrode design in nanoscale is considered to be ultra-important to construct a superb capacitor. Herein, a sandwich-like composite was made by combining graphene/polypyrrole (GPPY) with nickel-aluminum layered double hydroxide nanowires (NiAl-NWs) via a facile hydrothermal method. This sandwich-like architecture is promising in energy storage applications due to three unique features: (1) the conductive GPPY substrate not only effectively prevents the layered double hydroxides species from aggregating, but also considerably facilitates the electron transmission; (2) the ultrathin NiAl-NWs ensure a maximum exposure of active Ni 2+ , which can improve the efficiency of rapid redox reactions even at high current densities; (3) the sufficient space between anisotropic NiAl-NWs can accommodate a large volume change of the nanowires to avoid their collapse or distortion during the reduplicative redox reactions. Keeping all these unique features in mind, when the as-prepared composite was applied to supercapacitors, it presented an enhanced capacitive performance in terms of high specific capacitance (845\u00a0F\u00a0g \u22121 ), excellent rate performance (67% retained at 30\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121 ), remarkable cyclic stability (92% maintained after 5000 cycles) and large energy density (40.1 Wh\u00b7Kg \u22121 ). This accomplishment in the present work inspires an innovative strategy of nanoscale electrode design for high-rate performance supercapacitor electrodes containing pseuducapacitive metal oxide.",

This composite material is used as a flexible asymmetric supercapacitor positive electrode and oxygen evaluation reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. Integrated carbon foams with controllable three-dimensional pores are easily obtained and served as conductive backbones for the growth of the flower-like NiMn-LDH nanoarrays. The as-prepared flexible electrode, combining a highly open scaffold-like structure with well-designed electron transfer channels, shows significantly enhanced cyclic stability (99.6% of the initial activity maintained after 5000 cycles) and high energy density (41.0 Wh\u00b7Kg \u22121 ) in aqueous electrolyte. The as-prepared SC@NiMn-LDH@G//NPC asymmetric supercapacitor can lighten a LED indicator for more than 10\u00a0minutes.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Aluminum ion batteries are attractive new generation energy storage devices in large-scale energy applications such as grid storage due to its low cost, high safety and three-electron-redox properties potentially leading to high capacity. Cathode materials with both high capacity and rate performance are urgently needed to fulfill such applications. Here, a three-dimensional carbon-encapsulated cobalt selenide nanoparticles are developed from metal organic frameworks as a novel aluminum ion batteries cathode. The cathode material delivers an unprecedented capacity of 427\u202fmAh g \u22121  at 1000\u202fmA\u202fg \u22121  with two high discharge plateaus at 1.0\u202fV and 1.9\u202fV (equivalent to energy density of 424\u202fWh kg \u22121 ). And even at a very high current density of 5000\u202fmA\u202fg \u22121 , the initial discharge capacity of cathode electrode can reach 254.8\u202fmAh g \u22121 , and a high capacity of 62.4\u202fmAh g \u22121  is retained after 100 cycles. Such outstanding performance are attributed to the well-defined nanostructure of three-dimensional carbon-encapsulated cobalt selenide cathode material. This work represents a significant step forward to prepare advanced cathode materials for aluminum ion batteries.",

The ultrathin LDH nanoflakes (3\u20135 nm) expose their abundant active sites to the electrolyte, thus generating huge pseudocapacitance. Combining the abovementioned features, this specially designed 3D nanostructured hybrid possesses an exceptional specific capacitance (2395 F g\u22121 at 1 A g\u22121), excellent rate performance (retaining 71.8% of capacitance at the current density of 20 A g\u22121), and remarkable cycling stability (99.6% retention after 10\u2006000 cycles).

        "abstract": "Abstract   The main bottleneck of supercapacitor is its low energy density, mainly arising from the low capacity of the electrode materials. Although some pseudocapacitive metal oxide/hydroxides have been selected to improve the energy density of supercapacitor, their low conductivity and inferior reversibility still need to be considered. In this work, we prepared a free-standing composite comprised of NiAl-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoflakes decorated on a cotton derived carbon microfiber (CMF@NiAl-LDH) via a facile hydrothermal method. The large-scale and compressible cotton derived carbon fiber with connected three-dimensional pores served as conductive backbones for the growth of the NiAl-LDH nanoflakes. It can not only improve the conductivity of NiAl-LDH, but also amend the distribution of NiAl-LDH nanosheets, leading to both rapid electron and electrolyte ions transport kinetics. The abundant space among NiAl-LDH nanoflakes as well as developed 3D pores of CMF can accommodate the volume expansion of NiAl-LDH during long lifespan cycling. Benefited from these rational design, the as-prepared CMF@NiAl-LDH electrode exhibited significantly improved capacitive performance in terms of high specific capacitance (1667\u202fF\u202fg \u22121  at 1\u202fA\u202fg \u22121 ), excellent rate performance (68.7% retained at 15\u202fA\u202fg \u22121 ) and remarkable cyclic stability (105.4% maintained after 2000 cycles) in aqueous electrolytes. The assembled CMF@NiAl-LDH//porous carbon asymmetric supercapacitor can deliver a large energy density of 45.2\u202fWh Kg \u22121 . This investigation suggests that the prepared CMF@NiAl-LDH electrode offers a great potential in large-scale energy storage device applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Recent years, there have been massive reports of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) used as electrode materials. However, the synergistic effect between different host metal ions on the electrochemical behavior of LDHs is rarely studied. We prepared a series of LDHs with different host metal combinations and investigated their physiochemical properties and redox behaviors to study the synergistic effects between different active metal ions. According to the experimental and theoretical calculation results, LDHs with dual transition metals possessed lower band-gap energies and higher conductivities than mono-transition metal-based samples. The reduced band-gap energy and enhanced conductivity should be ascribed to the hybridization between 3d-orbitals of different transition atoms. As a result, LDHs with dual transition metals exhibited lower charge transfer resistances and redox potentials as well as longer electron lifetime, implying that they could be oxidized or reduced more easily during the redox process. The lowest charge transfer resistance and longest electron lifetime of NiMn-LDHs signify that the synergistic effect between Ni and Mn is the best. From  in situ  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results, more than 50% Ni atoms in NiMn-LDHs can be oxidized under 0.45\u00a0V, which also demonstrates the excellent redox efficiency of NiMn-LDHs.",

        "abstract": "Rechargeable aluminum-ion batteries (RAIBs) are regarded as the next generation of low-cost and high-capacity electrical energy storage systems. Compared to graphene-based cathodes, metal dichalcogenide cathodes can potentially provide RAIBs with higher capacities. However, metal dichalcogenides suffer from poor cycling performance, hindering the further development of high-capacity RAIBs. Thus, to further improve the performance of RAIBs, it is imperative to gain a deep understanding of the mechanisms behind the energy-storage and capacity-deterioration characteristics of these materials. In this work, we conducted detailed characterization to acquire a deep understanding of the energy storage mechanism of a CoSe2-based cathode. The characterization results revealed that energy storage involved incorporation of Al3+ into CoSe2 to generate AlmConSe2 (i.e., partial substitution of Co2+ by Al3+) and elemental Co, while capacity deterioration resulted from the dissolution of active cobalt species into the electrolyte and the pulverization of the CoSe2 phase. The understanding of the capacity-deterioration mechanism allowed us to design a two-step concept for a new type of RAIB composite cathode material. Thus, we employed a conductive wrapping layer of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to protect CoSe2/carbon nanodice composites from cobalt dissolution and CoSe2 pulverization while also improving the conductivity of the materials. This novel design resulted in a CoSe2/carbon nanodice@rGO composite material with an outstanding cycling performance (after 500 cycles) of 143 mA h g\u22121 at 1000 mA g\u22121, which is one of the best performances for a metal-based RAIB cathode material reported to date. These findings are of great significance for the further development of high-capacity RAIBs.",

In this study, a series of N-doped microporous carbon materials were synthesized from low cost and widely available urea formaldehyde resin co-polymerized with furfuralcohol. These N-doped microporous carbons showed tunable surface area in the range of 416-2273\u00a0m(2)\u00a0g(-1) with narrow pore size distribution within less than 1\u00a0nm and a high density of the basic N functional groups (2.93-13.92\u00a0%). Compared with the carbon obtained from urea resin, the addition of furfuralcohol apparently changed the surface chemical composition and pore size distribution, especially ultramicropores as can be deduced from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and pore size distribution measurements and led to remarkable improvement on CO2 adsorption capacity. At 1\u00a0atm, N-doped carbons activated at 600\u00a0\u00b0C with KOH/UFFC weight ratio of 2 (UFFA-2-600) showed the highest CO2 uptake of 3.76 and 1.57\u00a0mmol\u00a0g(-1) at 25 and 75\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively.

Herein, we developed a new strategy to prepare microporous carbons with uniform ultramicropores (\u223c0.57\u202fnm) through ionic activation method by using potassium carboxylate as an activating agent, which was uniformly incorporated onto the surface of hydrothermally prepared hydrochar.

N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms were used to determine their microporosity and the results revealed that both the carbonization temperature and urea/furfural ratio are important to form abundant micropores, which will lead to higher CO2 adsorption capacity. Recyclability and selectivity of the materials were also conducted and these results showed their high stability and recyclability along with high selectivity for CO2 over N2. The presently developed N-doped carbon materials are promising adsorbents for CO2 adsorption.\n",

        "abstract": "Carbon-based adsorbent is considered to be one of the most promising adsorbents for CO2 capture form flue gases. In this study, a series of N-doped microporous carbon materials were synthesized from low cost and widely available urea formaldehyde resin co-polymerized with furfuralcohol. These N-doped microporous carbons showed tunable surface area in the range of 416\u20132273\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u22121 with narrow pore size distribution within less than 1\u00a0nm and a high density of the basic N functional groups (2.93\u201313.92\u00a0%). Compared with the carbon obtained from urea resin, the addition of furfuralcohol apparently changed the surface chemical composition and pore size distribution, especially ultramicropores as can be deduced from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and pore size distribution measurements and led to remarkable improvement on CO2 adsorption capacity. At 1\u00a0atm, N-doped carbons activated at 600\u00a0\u00b0C with KOH/UFFC weight ratio of 2 (UFFA-2-600) showed the highest CO2 uptake of 3.76 and 1.57\u00a0mmol\u00a0g\u22121 at 25 and 75\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively.",

The enhancement of isomerization during catalytic cracking process is a feasible approach to improve the gasoline yield and quality. In this study, meso-SAPO-11 was synthesized by citric acid modification to generate mesopores in the SAPO-11 molecular sieve. The modification temperature played an important role in the mesopore generation. Nitrogen sorption and X-ray diffraction analysis had been utilized to characterize the mesoporous structure. Meso-SAPO-11 was further used as an additive in the FCC catalyst for catalytic evaluation with atmospheric gas oil and coking gas oil. The additive showed significant improvement of heavy oil conversion, especially for the gasoline yield and quality .",

A series of factors including the concentration of CA and AFS, the volume ratio of CA and AFS, adding rate of AFS, reaction time and temperature were studied to get the optimum operation condition. The pore structure, acid property and crystal structural of modified USY zeolite were characterized by a variety of means such as N2 adsorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, NH3-temperature programmed desorption and X-ray diffraction. The as-synthesized sample presents an increased secondary pore volume up to 0.20\u00a0cm3/g which accounts for 46.5\u00a0% of the total pore volume, and appropriate acidity distribution as well as good crystallinity. In addition, the modified USY zeolite possesses a superhigh Si/Al ratio of 25.7 which is more than twice higher than that of commercial USY zeolite. Furthermore, the hydrothermal stability of the modified samples meet the requirements of commercial catalysts for hydrocracking.

        "abstract": "Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) attract more attention because of sodium's abundant availability, affordable price, and potential to be an effective anode material. Meanwhile, carbon-based materials provide the most promising anode materials. Due to the large radius of sodium ions, sodium ion batteries don't exhibit favorable electrochemical performance. Introducing heteroatoms into the carbon lattice is an effective strategy to enlarge the interlayer space of carbon-based materials which can improve carbon's electrochemical performance. In addition, anode materials with surface-induced capacitive process can enhance SIB's electrochemical performance because its capacitive process increases the kinetics of ion diffusion. Here, we describe an SIB's anode material containing nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene sheets (denoted as PDMcT/RGO) which are synthesized via carbonization of poly(2,5-Dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole) (PDMcT) polymerized on the surface of graphene oxides. PDMcT/RGO exhibited high capacities (240 mAh g-1 at 500 mA g-1), improved rate performance (144 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1) and good cycling stability (153 mAh g-1 after 5000 cycles at 5000 mA g-1). These unique results are attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing and electronic conductivity from the heteroatoms which facilitate the sodium ion's insertion and electron transport. These results represent that PDMcT/RGO is a great potential anode material for SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Metal sulfides were considered as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, volume expansion during charging/discharging is an issue. One dimensional nanofibers are considered here to alleviate the change in stress of the anodeu0027s structure. Here we incorporated the nanofibers and WS 2  nanosheets which used (DODA) 3 PW 12 O 40  as the precursor. The precursor was prepared by an ion-exchange method, and then used to fabricate the anode material (denoted as DODA-WS 2 ) via electrospinning. Use of surfactant dimethyldistearylammonium bromide (DODA\u00b7Br) disperses the WS 2  nanosheets in the nanofibers. Carbonization and decomposition of DODA ligands provides porosity that accommodates volume expansion. The resulting structure of the anode material delivers high capacities of 363 and 318\u202fmAh g \u22121  with 96% and 91% rate capacity retention after 400 cycles at 200 and 500\u202fmA\u202fg \u22121 , respectively. Also, improved rate capabilities (395 and 91\u202fmAh g \u22121  at 50 and 10000\u202fmA\u202fg \u22121 , respectively) and good cycling stability (226.5\u202fmAh g \u22121  after 800 cycles at 1000\u202fmA\u202fg \u22121 ). These unique results are ascribed to the well-dispersed WS 2  cross-linked nanofiber framework and its conductive network. This structure facilitates the transportation of electrons and Na +  and relieve the stress due to expansion. DODA-WS 2  has a high potential for use as anode materials in SIBs.",

Interestingly, compared to a state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst, the as-prepared Pt/NC catalyst shows a superior electrocatalytic performance with a 1.4-fold improvement in mass activity and a 1.5-fold enhancement in stability for methanol electrooxidation reaction.

        "abstract": "Sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) and aminopropyltriethoxysilane (KH550) hybrid membranes doped with different weight ratio of phosphotungstic acid (PWA) were prepared by the casting procedure, as well as PWA as a catalyst for sol\u2013gel process of KH550. The chemical structures of hybrid membranes were characterized by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The morphology of hybrid membranes was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results had proved the uniform and homogeneous distribution of KH550 and PWA in these hybrid membranes. The influence of the dispersed PWA on the properties of membranes such as thermal stability, water uptake, swelling ratio, and proton conductivity was researched. Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) results indicated that the hybrid membranes had high thermal stability below 200\u00a0\u00b0C. The dimensional stabilities of the hybrid membranes were improved by addition of KH550-10/PWA compared with the pristine SPEEK. The proton conductivity of the hybrid membrane with 5\u00a0wt.% PWA into SPEEK/KH550-10 reached the maximum of 0.084\u00a0S cm \u2212 1 at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 0.16\u00a0S cm \u2212 1 at 80\u00a0\u00b0C under the 100% relative humidity condition. The proton conductivity mechanism in the hybrid membranes was discussed. Therefore, the possibility of the hybrid membranes for usage in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) was explored.

        "abstract": "The development of advanced support materials displays the potential for both reducing the cost and simultaneously increasing the activity of catalysts. In the current work, a novel N-doped carbon coated hydrophilic titanium dioxide (TiO 2@N-doped C) nano-composite, constructed by the procedure of an in situ polymerization and subsequent pyrolysis, was utilized to support Pt nano-crystals for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The as-prepared Pt/TiO 2@N-doped C catalyst generated 1.74-fold higher activity, 2.08-fold higher stability and much better resistance to CO poisoning than a commercial state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. The enhanced catalytic performance was ascribed to the improved CO tolerance and the catalyst-support interaction due to the utilization of the TiO 2@N-doped C nano-composite, which not only provides rich active -OH groups to promote CO oxidation via the bifunctional mechanism, but also modifies the electronic structure of the Pt NPs to improve the intrinsic kinetics of MOR. The as-developed TiO 2@N-doped C nano-composite is a highly promising catalyst support material for use in fuel cell technology. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "The methanol electro-oxidation behaviors on the Pt\u2013MoO x /C catalysts with various compositions were investigated and compared to those of Pt/C catalyst by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The Pt\u2013MoO x /C catalysts were prepared by depositing Pt on the MoO x /C support obtained by precipitation-reduction method in advance. The physical properties of the prepared catalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, EDX and TEM. From the results of XRD and TEM, it was shown that the MoO x /C support facilitated the dispersion of Pt particles. All the Pt\u2013MoO x /C catalysts showed relative lower Mo contents comparing to their nominal values. No PtMo alloy was formed in these catalysts, which were affirmed by XPS and XRD. It was found that all the Pt\u2013MoO x /C catalysts showed higher mass activity (normalized to the mass of Pt) but lower specific activity (normalized to the electrochemical active surface areas) for methanol oxidation than the Pt/C catalyst. With the increase of Mo contents in Pt\u2013MoO x /C catalysts, the activities of Pt\u2013MoO x /C catalysts decreased. Combined with the composition and structure analyses, the differences in methanol oxidation on these catalysts were attributed to the interaction between the Pt particles and the MoO x /C support. It was suggested that the Pt metal\u2013MoO x /C support interaction resulted in two effects. One was decreasing the Pt particle size; the other was decreasing the specific activities of these catalysts for methanol oxidation. Comprising these two contradictory effects, the mass activities of these catalysts for methanol oxidation increased.",

The enhancement effect of MoO x on Pd/C catalyst for the electrooxidation of formic acid was verified by electrochemical experiments. Compared to the Pd/C catalyst, the experimental results showed that the addition of MoO x could significantly enhance the electrocatalytic performances for the electrooxidation of formic acid. Significant improvements in electrocatalytic activity and stability were primarily ascribed to the effect of MoO x on the Pd catalyst. In addition to the large specific surface area, the hydrogen spillover effect is speculated to have accelerated the electrooxidation rate of formic acid in the direct pathway.",

The kinetic parameters for this process, such as the standard rate constant (k0) and anodic transfer coefficient (alpha) for this irreversible heterogeneous electron transfer process at the electrode/solution interface and apparent diffusion coefficient (D(app)) for the homogeneous charge transfer process within liquid film near the electrode surface, were obtained with NPV theory from analyzing the dependence of current-potential curves upon the sampling times. The results showed that this process is truly a very slow, completely irreversible kinetic process, as k0 is in the order of 10(-9) cm/s for the rate-determining step. The values of k0 and D(app) decreased with the increase of methanol concentration, while alpha was independent of the concentration of methanol and its value was 0.35 +/- 0.05. Theoretical fitting is very consistent with the experimental data.",

        "abstract": "A series of Pt/C catalysts with controlled Pt particle sizes is synthesized using a surfactant-free process with ethylene glycol as the weak reducing agent. The Pt particle size can be regulated by controlling the pH of the Pt (IV) complex via the addition of different amounts of urea. The results of X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy confirm that the Pt nanoparticles on the carbon exhibit good size controllability and dispersion. The electroactive surface area (ESA), the electron transfer coefficient, and the electrocatalytic activity to dimethyl ether electrooxidation are dependent on the Pt particle size, and a comparison of the electrochemical properties of the samples reveals that the relationships are parabolic. The results are important for understanding the mechanism of and designing an effective catalyst for dimethyl ether (DME) electrooxidation and providing a size-controlled synthetic method for Pt-based catalysts. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, Fe based catalysts suffer serious stability issue from oxidative corrosion via Fenton reaction. Herein, using metal organic framework as anchoring matrix, we for the first time obtained pyrolyzed Cr/N/C SACs for ORR, where the atomically dispersed Cr are confirmed in Cr-N4 coordination structure. The Cr/N/C catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity with optimal half-wave potential of 0.773V versus RHE. More excitingly, the Fenton reaction is substantially restrained and therefore the final catalysts show superb stability. This work proposes an innovative and robust active site for ORR, which opens a new route to circumvent the stability issue regarding the non-noble metal ORR catalysts.",

        "title": "Synthesis and characterization of novel sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) copolymers with pendant carboxylic acid groups for proton exchange membranes",
        "abstract": "A series of novel side-chain-type sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone)s with pendant carboxylic acid groups copolymers (C-SPAEKs) were synthesized by direct copolymerization of sodium 5,5\u2032-carbonyl-bis(2-fluorobenzenesulfonate), 4,4\u2032-difluorobenzophenone and 4,4\u2032-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) valeric acid (DPA). The expected structure of the sulfonated copolymers was confirmed by FT-IR and 1 H NMR. Membranes with good thermal and mechanical stability could be obtained by solvent cast process. It should be noted that the proton conductivity of these copolymers with high sulfonatation degree (DS > 0.6) was higher than 0.03 S cm \u22121 and increased with increasing temperature. At 80 \u00b0C, the conductivity of C-SPAEK-3 (DS = 0.6) and C-SPAEK-4 (DS = 0.8) reached up to 0.12 and 0.16 S cm \u22121 , respectively, which were higher than that of Nafion 117 (0.10 S cm \u22121 ). Moreover, their methanol permeability was much lower than that of Nafion 117. These results showed that the synthesized materials might have potential applications as the proton exchange membranes for DMFCs. Keywords DMFC Carboxylic acid C-SPAEK DPA Aliphatic 1 Introduction Today, there is growing interest in developing highly conductive with low methanol crossover and low cost alternatives as proton exchange membranes (PEMs) for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) in order to reduce Ohmic losses and enhance their efficiencies during operation [1\u20135] . Perfluorosulfonic acid membranes, such as Nafion \u00ae , are the current state-of-the-art PEM materials, because of their superior chemical and electrochemical stability, in addition to high proton conductivity with relatively low ion exchange capacity (IEC). However, their high cost, loss of proton conductivity at high temperature (>80 \u00b0C) and high methanol permeability hinder their applications in fuel cells [6,7] . Hence, great efforts have been devoted to the development of alternative PEMs. In recent years, many kinds of sulfonated aromatic polymers have been widely investigated as candidates for PEM materials [8\u201316] . Among them are sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone)s (SPAEKs) developed by several groups [17\u201319] , due to their good thermal, mechanical stability and appropriate conductivity. Like other sulfonated aromatic copolymers, SPAEKs require a high IEC to achieve sufficient proton conductivity. However, higher IEC usually leads to high water uptake which will result in the loss of the mechanical strength and high methanol permeability. This can be interpreted from their morphology. The model discussed by Kreuer on the basis of small angle X-ray scattering data for conventional SPAEK membranes shows a less pronounced phase separation than that of Nafion \u00ae , that is, a morphology with narrower channels than those in Nafion \u00ae , but with highly branched and many dead-end channels [7] . If novel SPAEK membranes are to be successful as PEMs, the morphology must be understood and controlled in such a way that will provide more distinct phase separation between hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains as well as connectivity between hydrophilic domains. Recently, incorporating proton conducting sites, such as sulfonic and carboxylic acid groups, onto the side chain of copolymers fell into this category to change the mirophase-separated structure [20,21] . Kim et al. have reported sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) copolymers containing carboxylic acid groups on rigid backbone [22] . They observed that proton conductivity of these copolymers was not influenced by the pendant carboxylic acid groups obviously. Because of the space resistance, these carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid groups were isolated and unable to form defined hydrophilic domains efficiently. The rigidity of the hydrophobic backbone also hindered ionic domains to connect with each other to form proton conducting pathways. To overcome this drawback, in this communication, we synthesized novel SPAEK copolymers with carboxylic acid groups tethered to the flexible aliphatic chains by a direct copolymerization method. It is expected that the existence of the carboxylic acid groups on flexible aliphatic side chains is meaningful for the nanophase separation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains, and increasing proton conductivity. Carboxylic acid group as a proton donator can also contribute to the proton conductivity of the resulted membranes. The structure and properties of the membranes were studied in detail. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and reagents 4,4\u2032-Difluorobenzophenone was purchased from Longjing Chemical plant, China. 4,4\u2032-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) valeric acid (DPA) was purchased from Shanghai Chemical works, China. Potassium carbonate was dried at 180 \u00b0C for 10 h prior to be used. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was dried with CaH 2 and distilled. Toluene was dried by azeotropic distillation. All other chemicals were obtained commercially and used as received. 2.2 Preparation of sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) copolymers with pendant carboxylic acid groups (C-SPAEKs) To prepare the sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) copolymers, sodium 5,5\u2032-carbony-bis(2-fluorobenzenesulfonate) (monomer m) was first prepared via sulfonated method [23] . The sulfonated monomer was further copolymerized with DPA and 4,4\u2032-difluorobenzophenone (monomer k). C-SPAEK copolymers with different DS were prepared by varying the molar ratio of m to k. A typical synthetic procedure to prepare C-SPAEK-5 (DS = 1.0) was as follows: A 250 ml three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a N 2 inlet, and a Dean-Stark trap, was charged with DPA (0.025 mol, 7.15 g), monomer m (0.0125 mol, 5.275 g), monomer k (0.0125 mol, 2.725 g) and potassium carbonate (0.045 mol, 6.21 g). Then 35 ml DMSO and 15 ml toluene were added into the reaction flask under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was heated until the toluene began to reflux. After removal of toluene, the reaction temperature was increased to 180 \u00b0C. When the solution viscosity had increased obviously, the mixture was cooled to 100 \u00b0C and poured into 500 ml HCl (0.01 M) solution. The copolymers were washed with hot deionized water for several times, and then dried in vacuum at 80 \u00b0C for 24 h. 2.3 Membrane preparation Membranes were prepared by dissolving C-SPAEK copolymers in dimethylformide (DMF) with 10% (w/v) composition under constant stirring. Resulting solution was casted onto the glass plate and dried at 60 \u00b0C for 24 h. The membranes were immersed into 1.0 M HCl solution for 1 day and washed with pure deionised water to get H + form membranes. 2.4 Characterization of C-SPAEK copolymers FT-IR spectroscopy of dry membrane samples was recorded on the power samples dispersed in dry KBr in form of disks, using a BRUKER Vector 22 spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm \u22121 min \u22121 from 4000 to 400 cm \u22121 . 1 H NMR spectrometer was measured on a 500 MHz Bruker Avance 510 spectrometer at 298 K with deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d 6 ) as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the standard. A Pyris 1TGA (PerkinElmer) was employed to study the thermal stability behaviors of C-SPAEK copolymers. The TGA measurements were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere using a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 from 50 to 720 \u00b0C. 2.5 Characterization of C-SPAEK membranes 2.5.1 DS The low-field signals (6.5\u20138.5 ppm) were characteristic resonances of the aromatic hydrogen atoms. The signal at 8.18 ppm was assigned to the aromatic hydrogen atoms (H 5 ) at the ortho position to the electron-withdrawing \u2013SO 3 H groups. The DS of the copolymer was estimated by 1 H NMR [24,25] and calculated by the following equation: (1) DS 16 - 2 DS = A H 5 \u2211 A H where A H 5 was the peak area of H 5 , \u2211 A H was the integral peak area of the signals corresponding to the other aromatic hydrogen. 2.5.2 Ionic exchange capacity (IEC) and water uptake IEC and water uptake were measured as reported previously [26] . In this paper, the water uptake values of the membranes were measured at different temperatures for compare. The theoretical IEC can be calculated from DS with Eq. (2) : (2) IEC = 1000 DS 464 + 80 DS 2.5.3 Mechanical properties The mechanical properties of the membranes were measured using SHIMADZU AG-I 1 KN at the speed of 2 mm min \u22121 . The size of the membrane was 15 mm \u00d7 4 mm. For each measurement, at least four samples were used and their average value was calculated. 2.5.4 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis AFM measurement was carried out with a commercial instrument (Digital Instrument, Nanoscope IIIa, Multimode) under ambient conditions at room temperature. The tapping mode image was measured at room temperature in air with the microfabricated rectangle glass cantilevers (Nanosensor). 2.5.5 Methanol permeability Methanol permeability was measured using a liquid permeability cell described in the literature [27,28] . This cell consisted of two half reservoirs separated by the membrane. 1.0 M methanol was placed on one side (A cell) and distilled water was placed on the other side of the diffusion cell (B cell). The magnetic stirrers were used on each compartment to ensure uniformity. The concentration of the methanol in B cell was measured by using SHIMADZU GC-8A chromatograph. The methanol permeability was calculated by the following equation: (3) C B ( t ) = A V B D K L C A ( t \u2212 t 0 ) where A (in cm 2 ), L (in cm) and V B (in ml) were the effective area, the thickness of the membrane and the volume of permeated reservoirs, respectively. C A and C B (in mol m \u22123 ) were the methanol concentration in feed and in permeate, respectively. DK (in cm 2 s \u22121 ) denoted the methanol permeability. 2.5.6 Proton conductivity Proton conductivity was measured by a four-point probe alternating current (ac) impedance spectroscopy using an electrode system connected with an impedance/gain-phase analyzed (Solatron 1260) and an electrochemical interface (Solatron 1287, Farnborough Hampshire, ONR, UK). The membranes were sandwiched between two pairs of gold-plate electrodes and they were set in a Teflon cell. Conductivity measurement of fully hydrated membranes was carried out with the cell immersed in liquid water at desired temperature. The proton conductivity was calculated by the following equation: (4) \u03c3 = L R S where \u03c3 was the proton conductivity (in S cm \u22121 ), L was the distant between the two electrodes ( L = 1 cm), R was the resistant of the membrane and S was the cross-sectional area of the membrane (in cm 2 ). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of the C-SPAEK copolymers The C-SPAEK copolymers were synthesized via nucleophilic substitution reactions ( Scheme 1 ). FT-IR and 1 H NMR spectra were used to confirm the chemical structure of C-SPAEKs. Fig. 1 shows the comparative FT-IR spectra of C-SPAEKs with different DS. Observed bands at 1026 and 1084 cm \u22121 were assigned to symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of O S O. The absorption band at 615 and 1702 cm \u22121 could be assigned to the stretching of the C\u2013S and C O of carboxylic acid groups, respectively. The molecular structure of C-SPAEKs was also confirmed with 1 H NMR spectra. The 1 H NMR spectrum of C-SPAEK-3 (DS = 0.6) and C-SPAEK-0 (DS = 0) are shown in Fig. 2 . The peaks at 8.18 ppm were separated from the other aromatic groups, and were assigned to the hydrogen atoms adjacent to the sulfonic acid group. The peaks at 12.09, 2.36, 2.04 and 1.59 ppm were assigned to the hydrogen atoms of carboxylic acid group and aliphatic side chain, respectively. Therefore, both FT-IR and 1 H NMR spectrum showed that the sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) copolymers with pendant carboxylic acid groups were synthesized as desired. As shown in Table 1 , the calculated DS values from 1 H NMR spectra were in agreement with the expected DS derived from the monomer ratios. This result indicated that we could easily control the DS values by adjusting the molar ratio of monomer m to monomer k. 3.2 Thermal stability The thermal stabilities of the copolymers were investigated by TGA measurement ( Fig. 3 ). C-SPAEK-0 had only one weight loss step with an onset at around 370 \u00b0C, which showed better thermal stability than others. All the other C-SPAEKs in acid form exhibited three step degradation patterns. The first weight loss was observed around 100 \u00b0C. This weight loss was attributed to the loss of the absorbed moisture by the hygroscopic sulfonic acid and carboxylic acid groups in the membrane. The second weight loss occurred at around 220 \u00b0C, which was attributed to the splitting-off of sulfonic acid groups. The third degradation step around 430 \u00b0C corresponded to the main chain decomposition. 3.3 Mechanical properties The mechanical properties of C-SPAEK membranes were evaluated and listed in Table 2 . The membranes prepared from C-SPAEK-0 to C-SPAEK-5 had the tensile modules of 808.54\u20131598.31 MPa, elongations at break of 4.07\u201317.07, and tensile strength of 31.30\u201346.47 Mpa. These results indicated that the C-SPAEK membranes were tough and ductile enough for potential use as PEM materials. 3.4 IEC and water uptake of the C-SPAEK membranes IEC is usually defined as the moles of fixed SO 3 sites per gram of polymer, which plays a crucial role in deciding the water uptake and proton conductivity. The measured IEC values in [(mmol\u2013SO 3 \u2212 + mmol\u2013COO \u2212 )g \u2212 1 ] and theoretical calculated IEC values by 1 H NMR in [(mmol\u2013SO 3 \u2212 )g \u2212 1 ] are shown in Table 3 . Due to the present of carboxylic acid groups, the measured values were higher than the calculated ones. The IEC values increased with DS, which would lead to an increase in both the proton conductivity and water uptake of the membranes. It is well known that water serves the transport of protons in a proton exchange membrane and therefore influences the proton conductivity of the membrane. So the membrane must be able to absorb enough water. However, excess water uptake can lead to deteriorating mechanical properties of the membrane, which will limit the practical application of the membrane in fuel cells. Fig. 4 shows the water uptake values of C-SPAEK membranes at different temperature. As expected, the water uptake values of all C-SPAEK membranes increased with increasing temperature and IEC. For the membranes with low IEC (<1.13 mmol g \u22121 ), the water uptake values increased moldly with increasing temperature. The membranes with high IEC (>1.13 mmol g \u22121 ) exhibited a sharp increase in water sorption at high temperature (above 60 \u00b0C), which was partly attributed to the introduction of hydrophilic carboxylic acid groups on the polymer chains. The existence of carboxylic acid groups possibly lead to the formation of continuous ion network in sulfonated copolymers [10,29] . 3.5 Morphology analysis Tapping mode phase image of the acid-form C-SPAEK-4 was recorded under ambient condition on a 500 \u00d7 500 nm size scale to investigate the mirophase-separated structure ( Fig. 5 ). The dark regions in the images were assigned to a soft structure, corresponding to the hydrophilic sulfonic and carboxylic acid groups containing water. The bright phases in the images were attributed to a hard structure, corresponding to hydrophobic polymer matrix. The ionic clusters with an average size 22 nm connected to each other to form proton conducting paths. This image provided a direct evidence of a biphasic-morphology for this type C-SPAEK membrane. 3.6 Proton conductivity Proton conductivities of these C-SPAEK membranes were measured in water in the temperature range of 25\u201380 \u00b0C. As expected, proton conductivity depends significantly on IEC, water uptake and temperature ( Table 3 ). Fig. 6 shows the temperature dependence of the proton conductivity. C-SPAEK copolymers with high DS showed high proton conductivity probably due to their higher water uptake and improved microphase separated structure. For example, the proton conductivity of C-SPAEK-4 membrane increased from 0.07 to 0.16 S cm \u22121 with temperature increasing from 25 to 80 \u00b0C, which was well agreement with its water uptake. The water uptake of C-SPAEK-4 membrane increased more obviously with temperature than that of Nafion 117 especially at high temperature ( Table 3 ). With the temperature increasing, the molecular mobility increases and the water molecules can easily penetrate through the polymer backbone and hydrate a maximum number of sulfonic and carboxylic acid groups, which further leads to high proton conductivity at high temperature. However, excess water content dilutes the proton concentration in the membrane, thus resulting in a sharp decrease of the proton conductivity of C-SPAEK-5 membrane above 60 \u00b0C. On the other hand, microphase-separated structure is another important reason for their high proton conductivity. As mentioned above, the carboxylic acid groups are locked on the flexible aliphatic side chains of the copolymers, which can interact with sulfonic acid groups easily to form define hydrophilic domains. Especially at high temperature, the mobility of the flexible aliphatic side chains increases, consequently they form mirophase-separated structure where the ionic domains connect to each other to form proton conducting pathways [31] . As the result, the introduction of carboxylic acid groups in copolymers lead to a significant increase in proton conductivity and water uptake with increasing temperature. 3.7 Methanol permeability The methanol permeability of the C-SPAEK membranes at room temperature are shown in Table 3 . The membranes exhibited methanol permeability in the range of 1.10 \u00d7 10 \u22128 to 1.48 \u00d7 10 \u22126 cm 2 s \u22121 , which were all much lower than that of Nafion 117 (2.38 \u00d7 10 \u22126 cm 2 s \u22121 ). As reported previously [32,33] , it appears that both proton conductivity and methanol permeation take place through the same pathway in the membranes as have the similar changing trend depending on DS. As shown in Fig. 7 , both the methanol permeability and proton conductivity of the membranes increased linearly up to 20 mol% sulfonated monomer content, then a sudden increase was observed above 20 mol% sulfonated monomer content. This is referred to as the \u201cpercolation threshold\u201d [22] . In general, the introduction of hydrophilic moieties on the polymer chains, such as carboxylic and sulfonic acid groups can increase the water content of the membranes, which will lead to enlarging the hydrophilic clusters, and also methanol molecules as well as proton can pass through these hydrophilic domains [34] . C-SPAEK-3 (IEC = 1.13 mmol g \u22121 ) and C-SPAEK-4 (IEC = 1.38 mmol g \u22121 ) membranes exhibited high proton conductivity and low methanol permeability and could be promising materials for DMFC application. 4 Conclusions A series of novel sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone)s containing pendant carboxylic acid groups with different DS were successfully synthesized by aromatic nucleophilic substitution polycondensation. 1 H NMR spectra was used to confirm the DS of the copolymers. All C-SPAEK membranes in acid form possessed good thermal stabilities and mechanical properties. Carboxylic acid groups increased the hydrophilic ability of the copolymers, which resulted in the high water uptake values of the membranes. AFM observations suggested that the copolymer with high DS showed improved nanophase separation. High water uptake and improved micropahse separated morphology which was formed by the interactions of carboxylic and sulfonic acid groups were favorable for high proton conductivity. Take C-SPAEK-3 and C-SPAEK-4 membranes for example, their conductivity reached up to 0.12 and 0.16 S cm \u22121 at 80 \u00b0C, respectively, which were all higher than that of Nafion 117 (0.10 S cm \u22121 ) at the same measuring condition. This result demonstrated they probably were promising in DMFCs application. In addition, these kinds of C-SPAEK copolymers have reactive carboxylic acid groups which can react with crossing agent containing a hydroxyl or amide group to form a crossing membrane material, consequently increases their mechanical properties and decreases their water uptake as well as methanol permeability.

It shows high electrocatalytic activity and stability for both the ORR process with onset potential of 1.03 V in alkaline and the CO2RR to CO with high faradic efficiency up to 90% and selectivity of about 100% at low overpotential of 0.49 V. For CO2RR to CO, it is revealed that Fe C is active but the activity of FeN centers is lower than that of C-N-based centers, contrary with that observed for ORR. Due to its low cost and high electrocatalytic performance for these two reduction reactions, the obtained catalyst is very promising for extensive application in future. The revealed huge activity difference of the same types of active sites for different reactions can efficiently guide the synthesis of advanced materials with multifunction.",

        "abstract": "A series of poly(aryl ether sulfone)s containing triptycene groups PES-x-TPD (x refers to molar percentage of TPD) were firstly synthesized through nucleophilic aromatic substitution polycondensation by using 2,5-triptycenediol (TPD), bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) sulfone (BHPS) and 4,4\u2032-difluorodiphenyl sulfone (DFDPS). The sulfonation of copolymers was conducted at room temperature by using a mild sulfonating reagent (98% H2SO4), and the degree of sulfonation was readily and accurately controlled by adjusting the ratio of TPD and BHPS. The structures of PES-x-TPD and SPES-x-TPD were characterized by IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra. These ionomers generally showed high thermal stability and mechanical strength at low humidity regardless of high IEC value. Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that these novel SPES-x-TPD membranes with high IEC value achieved high proton conductivity in a wide range of humidity at 80 \u00b0C. For example, SPES-60-TPD with the highest IEC value 2.86 mmol/g displays the conductivity of 2.5 \u00d7 10 -1 S/cm which is much higher than that of the perfluorinated Nafion membrane (1.1 \u00d7 10-1 S/cm) at 80 \u00b0C and 94% RH. At 80 \u00b0C and 34% RH, SPES-60-TPD displays the conductivity of 4.5 \u00d7 10 -3 S/cm which is also higher than that of the Nafion membrane (3.0 \u00d7 10-3 S/cm). Microscopic analyses revealed that well-dened phase separated structures and uniform ionic pathway was formed for SPES-45-TPD membrane with the IEC of 2.29 mmol/g. Moreover, a H2/O2 fuel cell using the SPES-55-TPD (IEC = 2.68 mmol/g) also showed better performance than that of Nafion 117 at 40 \u00b0C and 30% RH. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

For the purpose of comparison, phosphotungstic acid (PWA) and sodium tungstate are used as the precursor of WO 3 . Both the Pd\u2013WO 3 /C catalysts have much higher catalytic activity for the electrooxidation of formic acid than the Pd/C catalyst. The Pd\u2013WO 3 /C catalyst prepared from PWA shows the best catalytic activity and stability for formic acid oxidation; it also shows the maximum power density of approximately 7.6 mW cm \u22122 when tested with a small single passive fuel cell. The increase of electrocatalytic activity and stability is ascribed to the interaction between the Pd and WO 3 , which promotes the oxidation of formic acid in the direct pathway. The precursors used for the preparation of the WO 3 /C hybrid support have a great effect on the performance of the Pd\u2013WO 3 /C catalyst. The WO 3 /C hybrid support prepared from PWA is beneficial to the dispersion of Pd nanoparticles, and the catalyst has potential application for direct formic acid fuel cell.

        "abstract": "At low current densities the uncalcined material exhibits the best catalytic properties with the lowest total overpotential for OER. The potential then increases with increasing calcining temperature. At high current densities, above 200 mA cm 2 , the potential of OER for uncalcined sample exceeds that of samples prepared at 350 and 450 \u00b0C and with a very steep rise of the slope of the curve. These results show that the catalytic properties of the material are governing the potential for OER at low current densities, whereas the ohmic resistance of the catalyst layer ( R f ) determines the potential for OER at high current densities. This means that an optimum is found at 350 \u00b0C where the total anodic potential in the high current densities range of 0.2\u20131 A cm 2 is lowest. Abstract The RuO 2 anode catalyst for water electrolysis was prepared by a pyrolysis process in a nitrate melt at 300 \u00b0C and then calcined at different temperature from 350 to 550 \u00b0C. The physio-chemical properties of RuO 2 catalysts were examined by XRD, FE-SEM, CV, EIS, BET, etc. The impedance results in oxygen evolution region clearly show that the electrocatalytic activity of RuO 2 material decreases with the increase of calcining temperature. The resistance of catalyst layer ( R f ), however, decreases with increase of calcining temperature. Thus, optimum calcining conditions are found at 350 \u00b0C, where the total polarization reaches a minimum in higher current density (>200 mA cm \u22122 ). Furthermore, the RuO 2 anode also displays better stability at higher current density (1.1 A cm \u22122 ) in the PEM based electrolysers. Keywords RuO 2 Thermal treatment Water electrolysis Oxygen evolution 1 Introduction Dimensionally stable anode (DSA) with RuO 2 -TiO 2 as a catalytically active layer coated on a titanium substrate by the thermal decomposition method has been successfully used and caused a technological revolution in the chlor-alkali industry since its invention in 1960s [1] . The first fundamental research on the properties of RuO 2 , the main component of DSA, appeared in the open literature only in 1971 [2] . Since then, fundamental investigations of RuO 2 as anodes have increased exponentially, one of the new directions in this field is to develop RuO 2 anodes for the application in oxygen evolving conditions such as electroplating, electrowinning, electrofloatation, electrosynthesis, cathodic protection, water electrolysis, etc. [3\u20139] . In a future energy scenario based on renewable energy, hydrogen is an attractive energy carrier, which can be used as a non-toxic energy storage and transport medium. Hydrogen production by water electrolysis is a clean and simple way of storing energy from sources such as solar, wind and hydroelectric power. The hydrogen can then subsequently be utilized in a range of fuel cells without concern of contaminants such as carbon monoxide, which is present in reformed hydrogen. Water electrolysis is traditionally carried out in alkaline media with many commercial electrolysers available on the market. Advanced water electrolysers using proton exchange membranes (PEM) are less common and generally utilize expensive materials such as noble metal electrocatalysts and sulphonated polymers of perfluorocarbon chains as the proton exchange membranes. The benefits of PEM based electrolysers over alkaline systems is the much higher current densities (1\u20133 A cm \u22122 compared with 0.2 A cm \u22122 [10,11] ), no circulating liquid electrolyte, wide range of power loadings and very rapid power-up/power-down rates. The first electrolyser using polymer membrane as electrolyte was developed by General Electric Co. in 1966 for space applications [12] . Extensive research and development on SPE electrolysers has been performed by Japanese WE-NET program and other investigators [13\u201317] . The oxygen electrode has attracted great interest because it is the main source of overpotential in this system. Because non-noble metals like Ni and Co will corrode and Pt will be oxidated to low-conducting oxide when as anode catalysts in acidic Nafion membrane have been used as electrolyte. Thus, the oxides of noble metals Ru and Ir due to their high ohmic conductivity, chemical and thermal stability have been more used as anodic catalysts. In the present work, the RuO 2 catalysts were prepared from RuCl 3 \u00b7 n H 2 O using the Adams fusion method [18] and then calcined at various temperatures. We are focusing on the effect of thermal treatment on structures and performance of oxygen evolution of RuO 2 anode such as electrochemical active area, film resistance ( R f ), charge transferred resistance ( R ct ), etc. 2 Experimental A fresh hydrated RuCl 3 (Ru assay = 37.2%) by SPM Co. Ltd. was used. Nafion membrane and Nafion solution from Du Pont and 40 wt% Pt/C made in self. Nitrate sodium of analytical purity was supplied by Beijing chemical industry plant. All the water used was tapped from a Milli-Q Ultra Pure Water system with a water resistivity of 18.2 M\u03a9 cm. 2.1 Preparation of RuO 2 catalyst RuO 2 catalysts were prepared from RuCl 3 \u00b7 n H 2 O using the Adams fusion method [18] . In our preparation 1 g of metal chloride precursor was mixed in an excess of 20 g of NaNO 3 and dissolved in water. The water was gradually evaporated from the mixture and the salt mixture was introduced into a ceramic furnace, pre-heated at 300 \u00b0C for 3 h, then the salt mixture was cooled to room temperature and washed in water to remove impurities. The resulting metal oxide was then dried and calcined at a predetermined time and temperature. 2.2 Preparation of MEAs The anodic and cathodic electrodes were prepared by a brushing procedure using catalysts, carbon powder (Vulcan XC-72, Cabot), a carbon paper substrate, a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) suspension (Teflon 306A, Du Pont) and a 5 wt% Nafion solution (Aldrich). A homogeneous suspension composed of PTFE and carbon powder was brushed onto the carbon paper (geometric area of 9 cm 2 ) to form the diffusion layer (thickness about 100 \u03bcm) of the electrodes [19,20] . The composite structure was then dried in air at 120 \u00b0C for 30 min followed by thermal treatment in air at 350 \u00b0C for 30 min to remove the dispersion agent contained in PTFE. The amount of PTFE in the diffusion layer was 20 wt%. To prepare the catalyst layer, a homogeneous suspension was formed from the RuO 2 or 40 wt% Pt/C catalyst and the Nafion solution with isopropanol as solvent. The resulting ink was deposited onto the composite diffusion layer of the electrode by a brushing procedure to produce the catalyst layer. RuO 2 loading, platinum loading and Nafion content were 10, 0.4 and 1 mg cm \u22122 in slurry, respectively. After pretreatment of the Nafion membrane with H 2 O 2 /H 2 SO 4 , electrodes and membrane have been hot-pressed (4 MPa, 120 \u00b0C) for 3 min. The single SPE cell body was made of gilded Ti with flow fields machined into the Ti plates. Gilded Ti-net functioned as backings and was pressed by the Ti plates against the MEAs. 2.3 Electrochemical measurements and characterization of RuO 2 Applying a three-electrode cell with one reference electrode is extremely difficult for the investigation of electrochemical systems with solid electrolytes, furthermore Marshall et al. [21] also reported that oxide catalysts have similarly behaves in aqueous and PEM cell. Thus, cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies were performed with a PAR 273A potentiostat/galvanostat in a three-electrode configuration using a platinum plate counterelectrode and a saturated silver-chloride reference electrode. The working electrode was prepared by mixing the active material with 5 wt% Nafion ionomer in ethanol solvent, which was made into slurry. A small drop of the slurry was added on to the mirror polished glassy-carbon substrate. The electrolyte was 1 M H 2 SO 4 and the scan rate was from 10 to 500 mV s \u22121 with the voltage range from 0 to 1.2 V referred to the saturated silver-chloride electrode. The voltammetric charges ( q * ) corresponding to active surface areas was determined by integrating the area of the cyclic curve. Impedance measurements were also performed with a PAR 273A potentiostat/galvanostat in above three-electrode configuration and were carried out using an EG&G-PARC model 5210 lock-in amplifier. The frequencies were scanned between 100 mHz and 100 KHz using the \u201csingle-sine\u201d method. The experimental impedance data were fitted to an equivalent circuit using Wuhan University's EvolCRT software (Version 6.0). The electrodes polarization and stability-test were measured in SPE cell at galvanostatic condition up to 1.1 A cm \u22122 at room temperature. X-ray powder diffraction measurements were performed at room temperature using a D/max 2500 V PC X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku), with monochromatized Cu K\u03b1 radiation. Morphology and particle sizes were analyzed in a XL30 ESEM FEG (FEI Co.) field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The ruthenium contents in the liquid were determined by a POEMS (TJA Co.) inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP). Nitrogen physical adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms were performed with a micromeritics Asap model 2010 at 77 K. They were used to estimate specific surface area from BET. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of the RuO 2 powder after calcining at various temperatures (350\u2013550 \u00b0C) for 15 h. As can be seen in the figure, all peaks match a rutile-structure RuO 2 as indexed. On the other hand, the RuO 2 peak intensity increased with further increase of the calcining temperature, indicating that the RuO 2 gradually crystallized and sintered at high temperature. The increase of calcining temperature result in the decrease of surface area of RuO 2 catalysts, which due to a result of RuO 2 particle sintering. This also confirmed by the decrease of BET surface area and increase of diameter of crystal size of samples with increase of calcining temperature (see Table 1 ). Moreover, the decrease of surface area with increase of crystallization temperature also reported by Ioroi et al. in the study of IrO 2 /Pt electrocatalysts for unitized regenerative fuel cell [22] . In order to investigate the crystallization and sintering process of RuO 2 catalysts, a direct morphology observation was conducted. FE-SEM images of RuO 2 catalysts calcined at various temperatures are shown in Fig. 2 . Any crystalline RuO 2 forms are not observed in uncalcined RuO 2 ( Fig. 2 A). SEM observation with high magnification for uncalcined RuO 2 ( Fig. 2 A, inset) showed that it appeared to consist of agglomerates of the 30\u201340 nm RuO 2 particles. SEM images of calcined samples ( Fig. 2 B\u2013D) clearly showed that RuO 2 particles gradually agglomerating and crystallizing with increase of calcining temperature. The surface of RuO 2 catalyst after calcination at low temperature was much rougher than that after calcinations at high temperature. Thus, the RuO 2 catalyst after calcinations at low temperature has small particle size and larger surface areas, so it means that the more material near the center of the particles can be utilized. Cyclic voltammograms for samples as porous electrode at 20 mV s \u22121 are shown in Fig. 3 . The irreversible peaks occurring around +0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl have been attributed to the valence state change of the metal oxide from 3+ to 4+ in the RuO 2 [23] . Integration of the j \u2013 E curve provides the voltammetric charge q * , which is proportional to the number of surface active sites. The change of q * values of samples with sweep rate v are shown in Fig. 4 . It is found that the q * values of samples all decrease with increase of sweep rate v gradually. According to the investigation of some researchers [24,25] , when sweep rate v smaller, the q * value is related to the whole active surface. Conversely, when sweep rate v larger, the q * value is related to outer active surface. Thus, the change of q * values of samples at lower sweep rate also shows whole active surface of sample calcined at low temperature is much larger than that of sample calcined at high temperature. Moreover, when heat-treated temperature is higher, the change of q * value of samples with sweep rate v is more flat. This phenomenon is attributed to the increase of outer active surface and the decrease of whole active surface of RuO 2 under higher heat-treated temperature. This is also in good agreement with the observation from SEM. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at constant potential 0.3 V (double layer region) and 1.4 V (oxygen evolution region) was used. The complex plane (\u2212 Z image versus Z real ) at a given potential 0.3 V for various samples is shown in Fig. 5 A . The Nyquist plots of RuO 2 electrodes prepared at various temperatures for 0.3 V potential are characterized by two distinct regions. In the high frequency region, a short straight line with a lower angular coefficient is observed changing significantly with calcining temperature. A decrease in the frequencies caused a gradual change in the curve resulting in a second straight line with a higher angular coefficient observed in the low frequency domain. The high frequency intercept with the real axis almost is constant for all samples (as can be seen from Table 1 ). While the impedance behavior observed at low frequencies can be attributed to the oxide/electrolyte interface, the liner behavior observed in the high frequency domain may be related to the intrinsic properties of these materials. Similar impedance spectra have been observed for thermally prepared RuO 2 -based electrodes [26\u201330] . The equivalent circuit model in Fig. 6 A was used to analyze the EIS data. In this circuit the parallel ( R f C f ) combination takes into account the properties of the film, while the C dl is associated with the oxide/electrolyte interface. R s and R f represent solution resistance and oxide film resistance, respectively. The parameters obtained by simulation are summarized in Table 1 . The OER impedance behavior was investigated in the potential region at 1.4 V. Fig. 5 B shows representative Nyquist plots of the electrochemical impedance behavior, together with the data obtained by simulation using the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 6 B. Nyquist plots show that the diameter of the low frequency arc, which should be a measure of the polarization resistance and thereby of the catalytic activity of the electrode, is lowest for the uncalcining sample and increases continuously with increase of calcining temperature. These results are probably connected with the crystal growth of RuO 2 with increase of calcining temperature followed by a lower electrocatalytic activity. In Fig. 6 B, this circuit the parallel ( R f C f ) combination takes into account the properties of the film, while the parallel ( R ct C dl ) combination is associated with the OER. R s , R f and R ct represent solution resistance, oxide film resistance and charge transfer resistance for oxygen evolution, respectively. The parameters obtained by simulation are also summarized in Table 1 . It is found from Table 1 that R \u03a9 values between 0.3 and 0.4 \u03a9 cm 2 , independent of calcining temperature and applied potentials are found. The film resistance ( R f ) decreases with increase of calcining temperature, which can be attributed to the corresponding increased crystallinity of the oxide films, however, leads to an increase in the electrical conductivity. Charge transfer resistance ( R ct ) as a function of calcining temperature increases with increase of calcining temperature, suggest the uncalcining RuO 2 is the most efficient for the OER. The further increase of R ct , observed at the higher calcining temperature, is associated with a more extensive sintering occurring at the higher calcining temperature, as a result of which a lower number of active sites is exposed to the solution. This observation is in agreement with the behavior of C dl (see Table 1 ) as a function of the calcining temperature, as evidenced by SEM and CV. In fact, R ct is proportional to the product of the number of active sites and the site activity [31] . Thus, to obtain information with respect to the real electrocatalytic activity of the several materials, R ct values must be normalized for morphological effects. According to some authors [32,33] , this can be done dividing 1/ R ct (overall electrode activity) by the number of active sites ( q * ) or 1/ R ct q * [32,33] . The 1/ R ct q * data show highest site activity is found for uncalcining sample, while a poorer performance for the OER in acidic medium is observed for the other samples prepared at higher calcining temperature (see Fig. 7 ). This behavior of 1/ R ct q * as a function of calcining temperature reveal that the calcining conditions have a considerable effect on the properties of the catalytic layers. Steady-state polarization curves for uncalcined material and for samples calcined at temperatures ranging from 350 to 550 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 8 . The potentials are not corrected for IR drops. At low current densities the uncalcined material exhibits the best catalytic properties with the lowest total overpotential for OER. The potential then increases with increase of calcining temperature. At high current densities, above 200 mA cm \u22122 , the potential of OER for uncalcined sample exceeds that of samples prepared at 350 and 450 \u00b0C and with a very steep rise of the slope of the curve. These results show that the catalytic properties of the material are governing the potential for OER at low current densities, whereas the resistance of the catalyst layer ( R f ) determines the potential for OER at high current densities. This means that an optimum heat-treated temperature is found at 350 \u00b0C where the total anodic potential in the high current densities range of 0.2\u20131.1 A cm \u22122 is lowest. The results of stability-test for electrodes calcined at different temperature are presented in Fig. 9 . The electrolysis time of 2000 h has been ran at room temperature with 1100 mA cm \u22122 of applied current density. The cell voltage decreases during the initial stage of the electrolysis, which can be attributed to the wetting of less accessible inner surface of the oxide electrode due to its porous nature [34,35] . The cell voltage is then stable for a long period, and finally only cell voltage of uncalcined sample has the slow rises-trend was observed. In general, the deactivation of this type of electrodes is usually associated with the coating dissolution during electrolysis [36] . The losing amounts of RuO 2 for electrodes calcined at different temperature in electrolysis are presented in Fig. 10 . The losing amounts of RuO 2 for these electrodes rises abruptly during the initial stage of the electrolysis, which can be attributed to preferred-dissolution of \u201cirregular\u201d coating in porous structure RuO 2 . The dissolution of RuO 2 electrodes calcined at different temperature is then mild for a very long time, and only the dissolution rate of uncalcined RuO 2 electrode was more rapid. Similar results also obtained by Krysa et al. [37,38] in the study of dissolution of IrO 2 electrodes during the accelerated life-tests. Because the dissolution of RuO 2 is slow and the question of oxidation of Ti substrate is not existing, the stability of electrodes is better and the cell voltage is not rising abruptly. Furthermore, this result also reveals that RuO 2 electrode calcined at higher temperature has higher corrosion resistance. 4 Conclusion Above study revealed that the catalytic performance of the catalyst for OER is related with the heat treatment of material. RuO 2 particle size increases and the material becomes more crystalline with increase of calcining temperature, leading to lower electrochemical active surface and higher electronic conductivity. There seem to exist both positive and negative related to the effect of calcining temperature on the OER performance of the catalysts. Thus, optimum calcining conditions were found at 350 \u00b0C in this work.

        "abstract": "A series of sulfonated polyimides (SPIs) were synthesized in m -cresol from 4,4\u2032-binaphthyl-1,1\u2032,8,8\u2032-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BNTDA), 4,4\u2032-diaminodiphenylether-2,2-disulfonicacid (ODADS), and 4,4\u2032-diamino-diphenyl ether (ODA) in the presence of triethylamine and benzoic acid. The resulted polyimides showed much better water resistance than the corresponding sulfonated polyimides from 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTDA) and ODADS, which is contributed to the higher electron density in the carbonyl carbon atoms of BNTDA. Copolyimides S-75 and S-50 maintained their mechanical properties and proton conductivities after aging in water at 100 \u00b0C for 800 h. The proton conductivity of these SPIs was 0.0250\u20130.3565 S/cm at 20 \u00b0C and 100% relative humidity (RH), and increased to 0.1149\u20130.9470 S/cm at 80 \u00b0C and 100% RH. The methanol permeability values of these SPIs were in the range of 0.99\u20132.36 \u00d7 10 \u22127 cm 2 /s, which are much lower than that of Nafion 117 (2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 cm 2 /s). Keywords 4,4\u2032-Binaphthyl-1,1\u2032,8,8\u2032-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BNTDA) Sulfonated polyimides Water resistance 1 Introduction Recently, considerable attentions have been paid to proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) as a clean electric source for automobile, stationary, and portable power applications due to their lower weight, high efficiency, and low poison emission [1\u20133] . Proton exchange membrane (PEM) is a critical component in PEMFC. Perfluorosulfonate ionomers, such as Nafion, are the state-of-art membrane materials with features of high conductivity and excellent chemical stability [4\u20136] . However, because of their high cost, low operational temperature below 80 \u00b0C, and large gas crossover, many efforts have been made to develop alternative PEMs, especially sulfonated aromatic polymers [7\u20139] . Sulfonated polyimides have been studied by several groups as potential PEM materials [10\u201318] . Water resistance (including hydrolytic stability and solubility or swelling in water) of SPIs is an important factor that affects the fuel cell performance since the imide groups are relatively susceptible to decomposition due to the nucleophilic attack by water. The influence of the diamine structures on the hydrolytic stability of SPIs has been well investigated. It is known that SPIs derived from the diamine with higher basicity showed better hydrolytic stability. The separation of sulfonic acid groups from the aminophenyl rings and the introduction of aliphatic segments in both the main and the side chains are effective approaches to enhance the basicity of diamines [10\u201318] . Watanabe et\u00a0al. [15,16] prepared SPIs from 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTDA), 3,3\u2032-bis(sulfopropoxy)-4,4\u2032-diaminobiphenyl (BSPA), and 10-decamethylenediamine (DMDA). Impressively, these SPI membranes showed comparable performance to Nafion in fuel cell at 80 \u00b0C and were durable for 5000 h without distinct degradation. By far, most widely used six-membered dianhydride for\u00a0SPIs is NTDA, except for 4,4\u2032-ketone dinaphthalene 1,1\u2032,8,8\u2032-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (KDNTDA) recently employed by Okamoto et\u00a0al. [19] . The hydrolysis of imide groups was mainly resulted from the nucleophilic attack of the water molecule on the carbonyl carbon atoms; the dianhydrides with higher electron density in carbonyl carbon atoms should produce polyimides with higher hydrolytic stability. The electron density of the carbonyl carbon atoms can be characterized by their electron affinity ( E a ), and the lower the absolute values of E a is, the higher the electron density is in carbonyl carbon atoms [20] . It has been reported that 4,4\u2032-binaphthyl-1,1\u2032,8,8\u2032-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BNTDA) has a lower electron affinity, i.e. 3.7790 vs 4.0102 eV, than NTDA [21] . Therefore, in this paper, we present the synthesis of SPIs on the basis of BNTDA, 4,4\u2032-diaminodiphenylether-2,2-disulfonicacid (ODADS), and 4,4\u2032-diamino-diphenyl ether (ODA). Furthermore, the SPIs based on BNTDA showed enhanced water resistance compared with the corresponding polymers from NTDA. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials 4,4\u2032-Binaphthyl-1,1\u2032,8,8\u2032-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BNTDA) [22] and 4,4\u2032-diaminodiphenylether-2,2-disulfonicacid (ODADS) [12] were prepared according to the reported procedures. The other reagents used in this study were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Plant. 4,4\u2032-Diamino-diphenyl ether (ODA) was purified by sublimation in vacuum. Triethylamine (Et 3 N) and m -cresol were used after distillation. Other reagents were of analytical grade and used as received. 2.2 Synthesis of sulfonated polyimides based on BNTDA A representative polymerization procedure is described as\u00a0follows: 0.5400 g (1.5 mmol) of ODADS, 0.3004 g (1.5 mmol) of ODA, 0.8040 g (3.0 mmol) of BNTDA, 0.51 g (4.2 mmol) of benzoic acid, 0.36 g (3.6 mmol) of triethylamine, and 15 mL of m -cresol were placed in a three-necked, 100 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, nitrogen inlet and outlet. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 min and then heated at 80 \u00b0C for 2 h and then at 180 \u00b0C for 10 h. After cooling to 100 \u00b0C, 10 mL m -cresol was added to dilute the viscous solution. Then it was poured into 100 mL of ethanol with stirring. The fiberlike precipitate was collected by filtration and extracted with ethanol in a Soxhlet extractor for 24 h, and then dried in vacuum for 4 h to afford powder of sulfonated polyimide with the yield of 95%. 2.3 Membrane preparation and proton exchange SPI films (in triethylammonium salt form) were prepared by casting their m -cresol solution (5%) at 100 \u00b0C for 8 h. Then the film was soaked in methanol for 24 h to remove the residual solvent and dried at 120 \u00b0C for 8 h in vacuum. The proton exchange was performed by boiling the films in 0.5 mol/L H 2 SO 4 for 3 h and then immersing them in 2 mol/L H 2 SO 4 at room temperature for 2 weeks. The films in proton form were thoroughly washed with deionized water. 2.4 Measurements Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were determined with a Bio-Red Digilab Division FTS-80 spectrometer. 1 H NMR (tetramethylsilane as an internal standard) spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity spectrometer at 400 Hz. Inherent viscosities were determined at 30 \u00b0C with an Ubbelohde viscometer, and the concentration was 0.5 dL/g in m -cresol. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a Perkin\u2013Elmer TGA-2 thermogravimetric analyzer at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min in air. The films were dried at 120 \u00b0C or 3 h in vacuum and then balanced at 50% relative humidity for 2 days before measurements. The tensile measurements were carried out on an Instron model 1122 at room temperature at a rate of 5 mm/min. The relative humidity when testing was also 50%. 2.5 Proton conductivity Proton conductivity of membranes was measured by a four-electrode AC impedance method from 0.1 Hz to 100 KHz, 10 mV ac perturbation and 0.0 V dc rest voltage. Impedance spectra were recorded using a Princeton Applied Research Model 273A Potentiostat (Model 5210 Frequency Response Detector, EG&G PARC, Princeton, NJ). The membranes were fixed in a measuring cell made of two outer gold wires to feed current to the sample and two inner gold wires to measure the voltage drops. Conductivity measurements under fully hydrated conditions were carried out with the cell immersed in water. The proton conductivity ( \u03c3 ) of the membranes was calculated using the following equation: (1) \u03c3 = L R A where L , R , and A denote the distance between the two inner gold wires, the resistance of the membrane, and the cross-sectional area of the membrane, respectively. 2.6 Water uptake Water uptake was measured by immersing an SPI sample into water at 80 \u00b0C for 6 h. Then the sample was taken out, wiped with tissue paper very quickly, and weighed on a microbalance. Water uptake was calculated from the following equation: (2) S = ( W s \u2212 W d ) / W d \u00d7 100 % where W d and W s are the weights of dry and corresponding water-swollen membranes, respectively. 2.7 Water resistance tests Water resistance tests were performed by aging membrane sheets of SPIs in proton form in water at 100 \u00b0C for 200\u2013800 h. After aging, the membrane sheets were dried at 120 \u00b0C for 3 h and then subjected to the characterizations, such as mechanical properties and proton conductivities. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Synthesis of polymers As shown in Scheme 1 , a series of SPIs were synthesized in m -cresol from BNTDA, ODADS, and ODA in the presence of triethylamine and benzoic acid. The percent of ODADS in the diamines was 100, 75 and 50, and the polymers were coded as S-100, S-75, and S-50, respectively. Their inherent viscosity (in triethylammonium salt form) was in the range of 1.60\u20132.20 dL/g in m -cresol. The polyimides were proton-exchanged with 0.5 mol/L H 2 SO 4 in boiling condition for 3 h and then with 2 mol/L H 2 SO 4 at room temperature for 2 weeks [14] . The completion of proton exchange was confirmed by the disappearance of the peaks assigned for triethylamine in 1 H\u00a0NMR spectra. The structures of polymers were further confirmed by FT-IR and the results are shown in Fig.\u00a01 . The absorption bands near 1707 cm \u22121 (asym C O str), 1660 cm \u22121 (sym C O str), and 1367 cm \u22121 (C\u2013N str) were assigned to the characteristic absorption of imide ring groups and the bands near 1084 (asym S O str) and 1026 cm \u22121 (sym S O str) were assigned to the sulfonic acid groups. Furthermore, the intensities of the bands at around 1026 and 1084 cm \u22121 increased with the degree of sulfonation. BNTDA-based SPIs (in proton form) were soluble in DMSO and m -cresol at room temperature, as well as in DMAc and NMP on heating. Thermal stability of BNTDA-based SPIs was investigated by TGA measurement. The TGA curves of SPIs are illustrated in Fig.\u00a02 . All SPIs showed three-step weight loss: the first from room temperature to 170 \u00b0C due to the loss of absorbed water, the second starting from 280 \u00b0C due to the degradation of sulfonic acid groups, and the third at around 500 \u00b0C due to the decomposition of polyimide backbones. The thermal stability of BNTDA-based SPIs was similar to that of SPIs from NTDA and ODADS [12] . 3.2 Water uptake, proton conductivity, and methanol permeability The ion exchange capacity (IEC), water uptake, and proton conductivity of BNTDA-based SPIs are listed in Table 1 . Proton conductivity of the membranes (about 30 \u03bcm) of BNTDA-based SPIs was measured at 100% relative humidity (RH). The proton conductivity of these SPIs at 100% RH is a function of temperature, and increased linearly in general as the temperature increases ( Fig.\u00a03 ). Though all BNTDA-based SPIs have much higher IEC values compared with Nafion 117, their proton conductivity is in the same magnitude or even slightly lower (S-50) than those of Nafion 117. This is due to the strong acidity and unique phase-separation structure of Nafion, which is favorable for proton transport. Furthermore, the proton conductivity of BNTDA-based SPIs greatly depended on their IEC and water uptake. Higher IEC and water uptake led to higher proton conductivity. The values of water uptake and the numbers of water molecules per sulfonic acid group ( \u03bb ) were in the range of 38\u201383%, and 13\u201316, respectively. The homopolymers showed highest water uptake among these SPIs because of its highest IEC value. The water uptake values of BNTDA-based SPIs were lower than those of the corresponding polyimides from NTDA with an equal IEC value [12] . It can be rationalized in terms of the introduction of bulky, hydrophobic binaphthyl group. The methanol permeability of BNTDA-based SPIs was investigated at 20 \u00b0C by the method in the literature [23] and the results are listed in Table 1 . The methanol permeability values of SPIs were about one order of magnitude lower than that of Nafion. These properties will reduce the crossover of water and methanol, which is useful to enhance the performance of direct methanol fuel cells. 3.3 Water resistance The water resistance of BNTDA-based SPIs was tested by aging their membrane sheets at 100 \u00b0C in water. After aging, the membrane sheets were dried in vacuum at 120 \u00b0C for 3 h, and then subjected to the characterizations such as mechanical properties and proton conductivities. After aging at 100 \u00b0C for 150 h, S-100 became brittle, whereas the membranes of S-75 and S-50 were not broken when they were folded to zero degree and then folded back after aging both at 100 \u00b0C for 800 h. The comparison of the properties of S-75 and S-50 before and after aging is listed in Table 2 . S-75 and S-50 maintained their mechanical properties after aging at 100 \u00b0C for 800 h with a small decrease in tensile strength, modulus, and elongation. Furthermore, no appreciable difference was observed on proton conductivity values of S-75 and S-50 after aging. The hydrolytic stability of SPIs from NTDA and BNTDA is compared in Table 3 . It can be concluded that the usage of BNTDA improved greatly the hydrolytic stability of sulfonated polyimides. In NTDA-based polyimides, the two imide groups were located in one naphthyl ring. The electron density in the carboxyl carbon atoms was decreased due to the strong electron withdrawing of the other imide group. On the other hand, in BNTDA-based polyimides, the imide groups were separated into two different and non-coplanar naphthyl rings. The conjugation was broken and the withdrawing effect of one imide group on the other was weak. Therefore, the electron density in the carboxyl carbon atoms in BNTDA-based polyimide was much higher than that of NTDA. The higher electron density made the nucleophilic attack of the water molecule on the carboxyl carbon atoms more difficult, resulting in the extreme hydrolytic stability of polyimides. 4 Conclusion In summary, we have demonstrated two novel sulfonated polyimides with high water resistance by the introduction of BNTDA with a higher electron density in the carboxyl carbon atoms. The copolymers maintained their reasonably high mechanical properties and proton conductivities after aging at 100 \u00b0C for 800 h, while SPIs from NTDA and ODADS could not keep their mechanical properties at 80 \u00b0C for more than 200 h. In addition, these SPIs also possessed acceptable proton conductivities and very lower methanol permeability. The results mentioned above indicate that SPIs from BNTDA are promising candidate materials for high temperature PEMFCs. References [1] P. Costamagna S. Srinivasan J Power Sources 102 2001 253 [2] V.

        "abstract": "Nitrogen-doped acetylene carbon black (N-C) is prepared by annealing acetylene carbon black and melamine under the protection of N2 at different temperatures. The resultant N-C materials are used as the support of Pd catalyst (Pd/N-C) for formic acid electrooxidation (FAEO). The catalytic activity of the Pd/N-C catalyst towards FAEO is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, COad stripping voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The results show that when the heat-treatment temperature of support is 900 C, the corresponding catalyst, Pd/N-C-900, generate 2.84-fold and 0.96-fold higher activity than homemade and commercial Pd/C catalysts in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.5 M HCOOH solution. The COad stripping voltammetry results demonstrate that Pd/N-C-900 has much better resistance to CO poisoning. Moreover, the effect of formic acid concentration and the temperature on the Pd/N-C catalysts are also explored, which confirms the really enhanced performances for FAEO. It is founded that the doping of nitrogen results an increase in the performance for FAEO due to the improved Pd nanoparticles (Pd NPs) dispersion and the modified electronic effect. The results indicate that the Pd/N-C catalyst has great application prospect as a high-performance anode catalyst for direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs). \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "In this paper, it was found that glucose oxidase (GOD) has been stably immobilized on glassy carbon electrode modified by ordered mesoporous silica-SBA-15 and Nafion. The sorption behavior of GOD immobilized on SBA-15 matrix was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013vis), FTIR, respectively, which demonstrated that SBA-15 can facilitate the electron exchange between the electroactive center of GOD and electrode. The direct electrochemistry and electrocatalysis behavior of GOD on modified electrode were characterized by cyclic voltammogram (CV) which indicated that GOD immobilized on Nafion and SBA-15 matrices displays direct, nearly reversible and surface-controlled redox reaction with an enhanced electron transfer rate constant of 3.89 s \u22121 in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) (pH 7.12). Furthermore, it was also discovered that, in the absence of O 2 , GOD immobilized on Nafion and SBA-15 matrices can produce a wide linear response to glucose in the positive potential range. Thus, Nafion/GOD-SBA-15/GC electrode is hopeful to be used in the third non-mediator's glucose biosensor. In addition, GOD immobilized on SBA-15 and Nafion matrices possesses an excellent bioelectrocatalytic activity for the reduction of O 2 . The Nafion/GOD-SBA-15/GC electrode can be utilized as the cathode in biofuel cell. Keywords Glucose oxidase SBA-15 Direct electrochemistry Electrocatalysis Glucose",

        "abstract": "Electrical energy generated directly from sunlight and biomass solution with a Photoelectrochemical Biofuel Cell (PEBFC) was investigated. The PEBFC consisted of a meso-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP)-sensitized nanocrystalline titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) mesoporous film (NTDMF) as the photoanode and platinum black as the cathode. The interaction between TCPP sensitizer and NTDMF was evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectra and FT-IR absorption spectra, indicating that the TCPP sensitizer was adsorbed on the NTDMF by bridging or bidentate coordinate bonds. The spectroscopic properties of pure TCPP ethanol solution and TCPP-sensitized NTDMF were obtained by UV-vis absorption spectra, demonstrating that the characteristic absorption peaks of TCPP on NTDMF displayed slight red shift compared with pure TCPP ethanol solution. The performances of the PEBFC were obtained by photocurrent-photovoltage characteristic curves. The open-circuit photovoltage (V(oc)), the short-circuit photocurrent (I(sc)) and the maximum power density (P(max)) was 0.74 V, 69.96 \u03bcA and 33.94 \u03bcWcm(-2) at 0.45 V, respectively. The fill factor (FF) was 0.19 and the incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was 36.0% at 436 nm. The results demonstrated that the TCPP was an appropriate photosensitizer for PEBFC.",

Herein, we develop a rational bottom-up engineering strategy to improve the ORR performance of a metal-free catalyst by constructing a three-dimensional ultrathin N, P dual-doped carbon nanosheet. The resultant catalyst represents unprecedented ORR performance with an onset potential of 0.91\u202fV, half-wave potential of 0.79\u202fV. Impressively, a maximum power output at 579\u202fmW\u202fcm\u22122 is generated in the fuel cell test, the best among reported metal-free catalysts and outperforms most of the M-Nx-C catalysts. The outstanding catalytic performance results from the highly active polarized carbon sites which are induced by selective graphitic nitrogen and phosphorous dual doping. Our findings provide new directions for the exploration of alternatives to Pt and bring a renew interests in the metal-free catalysts.",

        "title": "Highly conductive, methanol resistant fuel cell membranes fabricated by layer-by-layer self-assembly of inorganic heteropolyacid",
        "abstract": "Layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly is a simple and elegant method of constructing organic\u2013inorganic composite thin films from environmentally benign aqueous solutions. In this paper, we utilize this method to develop proton-exchange membranes for fuel cells. The multilayer film is constructed onto the surface of sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) (SPAEK\u2013COOH) membrane by LBL self-assembly of polycation chitosan (CTS) and negatively charged inorganic particle phosphotungstic acid (PTA). The highly conductive inorganic nanoparticles ensure SPAEK\u2013COOH\u2013(CTS/PTA) n membranes to maintain high proton conductivity values up to 0.086 S cm \u22121 at 25 \u00b0C and 0.24 S cm \u22121 at 80 \u00b0C, which are superior than previous LBL assembled electrolyte systems. These multilayer systems also exhibit extremely low water swelling ratio and methanol permeability. The selectivity of SPAEK\u2013COOH\u2013(CTS/PTA) 8 is 2 orders of more than Nafion \u00ae 117, which is attractive in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). Keywords Sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) Proton-exchange membrane Layer-by-layer Chitosan Phosphotungstate 1 Introduction Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) using polymer electrolyte membranes are considered as promising candidates for transportation, distributed power, and portable power applications, as they can be operated at low temperatures and without any fuel processing equipment [1,2] . Superior proton conductivity, thermal and chemical durability, and oxidative stability have made perflurosulfonic polymers (Nafion \u00ae ) as commonly used electrolytes in DMFCs [3] . However, methanol readily migrates through Nafion \u00ae membrane between the electrodes and causes reduction of DMFCs voltage and poisoning at cathode. Furthermore, high cost, difficulty in synthesizing and processing have impeded their commercial development [4\u20136] . Considerable efforts to explore new PEM materials have been carried out. Sulfonated aromatic polymers, including poly(aryl ether ketones) (SPAEKs), fell into this category [7\u20139] . The membranes require a high sulfonation level to achieve sufficient proton conductivity. Unfortunately, increasing loading of acidic groups leads to undesirable high swelling and excessive methanol crossover [7,10,11] . For example, McGrath and co-workers reported that once the degree of disulfonation reached 60 mol%, the membranes swelled dramatically to form a hydrogel that would not be useful as a PEM [7,11] . Several attempts have been carried out to modify the SPAEKs membranes, e.g. addition of basic polymers, incorporating inorganic fillers or particles, coating barrier films on the surface, and so on. The modification of SPAEKs membranes could suppress the methanol crossover and, in general, improve the performance of DMFCs to some extent [12\u201314] . However, in most of these cases, the proton conductivity also decreased significantly due to the addition of non-conductive materials. The layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly is a powerful and simple method to deposit a thin multilayer film on a substrate by sequential electrostatic adsorption between the negatively and positively charged polyelectrolytes [15,16] . This technique can also be used to blend functional polymers with inorganic particles at the nanometer scale by utilizing electrostatic forces or secondary interactions such as hydrogen bonding. Recently, LBL technology has been used successfully in the area of both proton-exchange membranes and direct methanol fuel cell electrodes and electrolytes [17\u201321] . Jiang et al. found that the LBL self-assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and polystyrene sulfonic acid) on a Nafion \u00ae membrane showed significant effect on reduction in methanol crossover without much reduction in conductivity [22] . Kang and co-workers also demonstrated that the multilayer films on the Nafion \u00ae membranes reduced methanol permeability by half, while maintaining a high conductivity [23] . In most of the cases, the multilayered polyelectrolytes complex (PEC) membranes were prepared on the substrate of Nafion \u00ae , which are very expensive. As LBL method was not limited for polymers, any shaped nanostructures with charges can be used as well, highly conductive inorganic nanoparticles becomes another possibility to further increase the conductivity and keep their extremely high methanol resistance. Here, we report a novel approach to construct a stable multilayer film onto the surface of SPAEK membrane by LBL self-assembly polycation chitosan (CTS) and negatively charged inorganic particle phosphotungstic acid (PTA) ( Fig. 1 ). It can suppress the methanol diffusion while maintaining a high proton conductance. Negatively charged SPAEK containing alternative sulfonic and carboxylic pendant groups (SPAEK\u2013COOH) were selected as support materials for the preparation of multilayered film to ensure good adhesion between the top and support layer, thanks to high electrostatic interactions. CTS is extremely attractive to prepare polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) because of the presence of both amino and hydroxyl groups [24] . Phosphotungstic acid, H 3 PW 12 O 40 , is one of the Keggin-type heteropolyacids and exhibits extremely high proton conductivity (between 0.02 and 0.1 S cm \u22121 at 25 \u00b0C). By LBL method, PTA can be firmly fixed in the thin multilayer PECs through electrostatic interaction. Then, the multilayer PECs coated on the SPAEK\u2013COOH membranes were evaluated in terms of SEM, TGA, swelling behavior, proton conductivity, and methanol permeability. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Chitosan (MW 500,000 and 90% degree of deacetylation) was purchased from Sanland-chem International Inc. (Xiamen, China). Phosphotungstic acid was obtained from Shanghai Mayao Chemical Technology Co., Ltd., China. Sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) bearing carboxylic groups was synthesized according to our previous report with ion exchange capacity (obtained from the titration) (1.84 mmol g \u22121 ) [25] . Other chemicals and solvents were used as received. Milli-Q water (Millipore, 18.2 M\u03a9 at 25 \u00b0C) was used in the experiments. 2.2 Layer-by-layer assembly The SPAEK\u2013COOH membranes (the thickness is about 50 \u03bcm) were immersed into 1.0 M HCl solutions for 24 h, then the membrane was rinsed in Milli-Q water three times to remove traces of HCl. The membranes were stored in Milli-Q water before use. 2% (w/v) chitosan solution was prepared by dissolving chitosan powder in 2% (v/v) acetic acid solution. After chitosan powder was completely dissolved, solution was filtered and deformed by leaving it quiescent at ambient temperature for 2 h. The PTA powder was dissolved in Milli-Q water to form PTA (1 mmol L \u22121 ) solutions (pH 2.5). The LBL deposition of CTS-PTA multilayer's was carried out by alternate dipping of the pretreated SPAEK\u2013COOH membrane in CTS (2 g L \u22121 ) and PTA (1 mmol L \u22121 ) solutions at room temperature for 10 min. After each dipping step, the membrane was rinsed with Milli-Q water to remove weakly bonded polyelectrolyte molecules and dried in a stream of N 2 gas for 5 min. The process was repeated to increase the number of CTS/PTA bilayers [15] . The resulted polyelectrolyte multilayer modified membrane was finally cleaned with Milli-Q water and stored before usage. Depositing CTS/PTA multilayers on glass plates and silicon wafers were performed by a similar method. 2.3 Characterization UV\u2013vis spectra were recorded with a SHIMADZU-UV2501 PC spectrometer after each layer of deposition on a glass plate. The morphology and thickness of CTS/PTA multilayered film on the SPAEK\u2013COOH substrate were determined by using JSM-6700F scanning electron microscope (SEM). The water uptake (WU) of the membrane was determined by measuring the change in the weight between the dry and swollen membranes. A detailed procedure was reported previously [26] . The water swelling ratio was defined as follows: (1) swelling \u2009\u200a\u200a ratio \u2009 ( % ) = L wet \u2212 L dry L dry \u00d7 100 % where L wet and L dry are the length of wet and dry membranes, respectively. The swelling degree in methanol solution of the membrane was determined by the reference report [27] . The dried membrane was immersed into 2 M methanol solution for 1 day. The swelling degree was calculated by the change in weight between dry and wet samples. The conductivity of the LBL self-assembled SPAEK\u2013COOH was measured by a four-electrode AC impedance method from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz, 10 mV AC perturbation and 0.0 V DC rest voltage using a Princeton Applied Research Model 273A Potentiostat (Model 5210 frequency response detector, EG&G PARC, Princeton, NJ). The membranes were fixed in a measuring cell made of two outer gold wires to feed current to the sample and two inner gold wires to measure the voltage drops. The impedance measurements were performed in water with 100% relative humidity at desired temperature. The proton conductivity was calculated by the following equation (2) : (2) \u03c3 = L R A where \u03c3 is proton conductivity in S cm \u22121 , L is the distance between electrodes, R is the membrane resistance and A is the cross-sectional area of membrane. Methanol diffusion coefficient was measured using a home-made glass diffusion cell, which consisted of two compartments and divided by a membrane sample. 100 ml methanol\u2013water solution (10 M) was placed on one side of the diffusion cell (cell A) and 100 ml water was placed on the other side (cell B). Both compartments were continuously stirred using submersible magnetic stirrers. The concentration of the methanol in cell B was measured by using SHIMADZU GC-8A chromatograph. Peak areas were converted to the methanol concentration with a calibration curve. The methanol diffusion coefficient was calculated by Eq. (3) : (3) C B ( t ) = A V B DK L C A ( t \u2212 t 0 ) where A , L and V B are the effective area, membrane thickness and receptor reservoir volume, respectively. C A and C B are the methanol concentration in the donor and receptor reservoirs, respectively. DK and t 0 are the methanol diffusion coefficient and the time lag, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 UV\u2013vis spectra The CTS/PTA multilayer buildup process was monitored by the UV\u2013vis spectra after deposition of each layer on a glass plate. Fig. 2 shows the UV\u2013vis spectra of (CTS/PTA) n ( n = 2, 4, 6, 8) multilayered PEC. These films exhibit the characteristic bands at 245 nm, which can be ascribed to the oxygen-to-tungsten charge transfer (CT) transitions of PTA. Since CTS has no absorption in the UV\u2013vis spectral range, the linear increase of absorbance peak at about 245 nm with increasing the number of CTS/PTA bilayers confirms the successful incorporation of PTA into multilayer films. The slope of the line, or the absorbance of one bilayer, is about 0.032. This linear feature suggests that each adsorption cycle contributes an equal amount of PTA into the thin films, which provide strong evidence for the regular growth of the multilayer and for high reproduction of layer-by-layer assembly. 3.2 SEM Multilayered CTS/PTA films were first deposited on negatively charged silicon wafers to study the surface morphology, following the protocol [28] . As seen in Fig. 3 , CTS precursor layer exhibits a quite uniform and homogeneous surface while CTS/PTA bilayer film shows a phase-separated structure. The PTA uniformly disperses in the PEC films. It does not recrystallize into large particles and agglomerate, but interact with CTS electrostatically. After several deposition cycles, a homogeneous morphology with no obvious separation is achieved again. This homogeneity of PEC membrane confirms that the ionic interaction between them leads PTA particles to be entrapped or surrounded by CTS chains. The SEM measurements were also used to provide visual evidence that the SPAEK\u2013COOH supporting membrane is uniformly coated in the LBL assembly process. The cross-sectional SEM images of SPAEK\u2013COOH coated with CTS/PTA multilayered films are shown in Fig. 4 . In contrast to the pristine SPAEK\u2013COOH supporting membrane ( Fig. 4 a), a very thin dense layer coated on the surface is clearly visible in the images of CTS/PTA multilayer modified membranes ( Fig. 4 b and c). There is a sharp transition between the amorphous SPAEK\u2013COOH and the lighter shaded band of LBL film. The thickness of LBL films deposited onto the SPAEK\u2013COOH support can increase to 2 \u03bcm upon changing the number of CTS/PTA bilayers, as confirmed at a higher magnification ( Fig. 4 d). Compared with conventional multilayered films, the CTS/PTA multilayers coated on SPAEK\u2013COOH is surprisingly thicker when prepared under similar conditions. This might be caused by the higher charge density of the polyelectrolyte complex used and the supporting SPAEK\u2013COOH membrane bearing more charge sites [28] . 3.3 Thermal analysis The thermal properties of SPAEK\u2013COOH substrate and CTS/PTA PECs coated membranes were studied by thermogravimetric analysis under N 2 atmosphere at a heat rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . All membranes exhibited two distinct degradation steps ( Fig. 5 (a) ). Fig. 5 (b) shows the first derivative of their TG traces. SPAEK\u2013COOH exhibited two main peaks in the first-derivative plot. During the first step, a broad peak centered at 281 \u00b0C was produced. This weight loss is believed to be associated with the loss of sulfonic acid groups. The second weight loss step started at about 400 \u00b0C can be divided into two regions. The shoulder at around 527 \u00b0C is related to the side-chain decomposition, while the intense peak centered at 621 \u00b0C corresponds to the decomposition of the polymer main chain. In the case of CTS/PTA PECs coated membrane, the peak maximum in the first stage is similar to that found with SPAEK\u2013COOH substrate. However, the 5% and 10% weight loss temperatures of coated membrane are higher than the SPAEK\u2013COOH substrate, indicating that electrostatic forces and hydrogen bonding between the oppositely charged polyelectrolytes improve thermal stability of a polymer below 400 \u00b0C [29] . In the second stage, the peak centered at 556 \u00b0C for the coated membrane is lower than that of the substrate, which is caused by the lower decomposition temperatures of PECs and CTS. The TGA studies revealed that the PECs coated membranes are still thermally stable within the temperature range for fuel cell applications. 3.4 Water uptake and swelling ratio It has been widely reported in the literature that the water swelling behavior plays an important role in membrane conductivity, dimensional stability and mechanical strength [11] . Generally, the water within the membrane provides a carrier for the proton and maintains high proton conductivity. However, excessive water uptake results in membrane fragility and dimensional change, which leads to weakness or a dimensional mismatch when incorporated into a membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The results of water uptake and swelling ratios for CTS/PTA multilayer's modified SPAEK\u2013COOH and pristine SPAEK\u2013COOH membrane at 25 and 80 \u00b0C are illustrated in Fig. 6 . It is noticed that CTS/PTA multilayer assembled on the surface of SPAEK\u2013COOH membrane effectively reduces the excessive water swelling and dimensional change at high temperature of 80 \u00b0C. For example, the water uptake of pristine SPAEK\u2013COOH membrane is approximately 208% at 80 \u00b0C, whereas, the CTS/PTA multilayer modified membranes shows the water uptake of 61.1%, 58.7%, 58.5% and 58.4%, respectively. Although these values are still higher than that of Nafion \u00ae 117 (38%), excessive water uptake is restricted. Maintaining an appropriate water uptake level is indispensable to ensure superior proton conductivity and to simultaneously reduce undesirable side effects. Similarly, the swelling ratio of SPAEK\u2013COOH\u2013(CTS/PTA) n is approximately four fold lower than that of pristine SPAEK\u2013COOH membrane and is smaller than that of Nafion \u00ae 117 (about 20%). The swelling degrees in methanol solution (2 M) of the membranes were also measured and are listed in Table 1 . In this experiment, the membrane is primarily hydrated by water and the methanol plays a small role in hydration of the polymer structure. Similar to the swelling degree in the pure water, the assembled membranes have slightly lower swelling degrees than that of pristine SPAEK\u2013COOH membrane at ambient temperature. When the CTS/PTA multilayered PEC with much low swelling property is coated, the hydrophilic \u2013SO 3 \u2013 and \u2013COOH\u2013 clusters on the surface of SPAEK\u2013COOH substrate is failed to be available to form hydrogen bond with water molecules. Thus, the CTS/PTA PEC multilayers can suppress membrane swelling in water effectively, which is also related to the methanol permeation. 3.5 Proton conductivity and methanol permeability The proton conductivities of pristine SPAEK\u2013COOH and CTS/PTA modified SPAEK\u2013COOH membranes were measured and are shown in Table 1 . For comparison, the proton conductivity of Nafion \u00ae 117 membrane in its fully hydrated state was also measured under the same condition. With an increase in the number of self-assembled CTS/PTA bilayers, the conductivity of the membrane decreases slightly. After the self-assembly eight CTS/PTA bilayers, the proton conductivity is 0.075 S cm \u22121 at 25 \u00b0C, a decrease of 13% compared with that of a membrane deposited two CTS/PTA bilayers. However, the value is still superior to the pristine SPAEK\u2013COOH (0.069 S cm \u22121 ) and comparable to Nafion \u00ae 117 (0.077 S cm \u22121 ). Compared to a SPAEK composite membrane with 10 wt.% phenoxy resin (PHR) as a promising candidate in DMFC, the CTS/PTA assembled membranes also show much higher conductivities [26] . This result indicates that the incorporation of highly conductive PTA ensures the multilayer modified membranes to maintain high proton conductivity values. The self-assembled PEC multilayers seem to have some negative effect on the conductivity of the membrane. However, this effect can be reduced into a minimum by using a proper combination of polycation and polyanion, as shown in the case of self-assembly of highly conductive inorganic nanoparticles. Two factors affects the proton conductivity of modified membranes: (i) it is interesting to find SPAEK\u2013COOH\u2013(CTS/PTA) n membranes shows slight higher proton conductivity when the temperature is relatively low. This phenomenon may be explained by the addition of high proton conductive ability of PTA. (ii) CTS/PTA multilayers restrict water swelling of SPAEK\u2013COOH membrane at high temperature. The modified membranes exhibit extremely low water uptake and swelling values compared to the pristine SPAEK\u2013COOH membrane. So the mobility of charge carrier species in SPAEK\u2013COOH membrane could be restricted, resulting in a decrease in proton conductivity of the self-assembled composite membrane. These two factors determine the overall proton conductivity of the CTS/PTA multilayer modified membranes. The conductivity data are also analyzed in terms of Arrhenius plot, as reported in Fig. 7 . From the Arrhenius plots, the activation energy ( E a ) can be calculated, which is an indication of the mechanism of proton transport. The E a for the pristine SPAEK\u2013COOH membrane is 21.9 kJ mol \u22121 . With the increase in the number of self-assembled CTS/PTA bilayers, the activation energies for the modified membranes decrease ( Fig. 8 ). The values are 16.4, 15.3, 12.6 and 8.3 kJ mol \u22121 , respectively. In the pristine SPAEK\u2013COOH membrane, the proton migration is primarily by the Grothuss or \u201cjump\u201d mechanism, which can be idealized as the proton which forms as H 3 O + ion jumps to the neighboring lone pair of electrons of a water molecule. In this mechanism, the activation energies for proton conduction should be between 14 and 40 kJ mol \u22121 [24] . The smaller activation energy indicates the easier proton transfer. The smaller activation energies of modified membranes might be due to the addition of HPAs (Keggin-type) with proton mobility and the existence of continuous hydrophilic channels in the multilayered CTS/PTA films [30,31] , which promoted the conduction of protons in the modified membranes. In addition, the water stability of modified membranes was evaluated by comparing the proton conductivity values before and after immersing in water for 2 weeks. It is thought that little change in proton conductivity corresponds to good water stability. As shown in Table 1 , the multilayer modified membranes exhibit good water stability with negligible change in proton conductivity. This result indicates that the water swollen PTA can be immobilized in the multilayer PEC membranes through electrostatic interaction and be much less prone to leaching out. Proton conductivity and methanol permeability are two crucial transport properties that determine the fuel cell performance. In general, methanol prefers to permeate through membranes with high sulfonated degree, thus eliminating any advantage with respect to Nafion \u00ae when used in solid state. However, by introducing CTS and PTA self-assembled with SPAEK\u2013COOH, it is effective to decrease methanol permeability while maintaining high proton conductivity. For example, the methanol permeability of SPAEK\u2013COOH\u2013(CTS/PTA) 8 is over 1 order of magnitude less than pristine SPAEK\u2013COOH, SPEEK/PHR composite membrane and over 2 order of magnitude less than Nafion \u00ae 117. It is known that the highly sulfonated aromatic polymers usually contain two domain regions: ion-rich hydrophilic domains and hydrophobic domains. The methanol diffuses primarily through the hydrophilic water-rich domains. When the surface of SPAEK\u2013COOH is coated by the PEC multilayers, the electrostatic interactions or the ionically crosslinking effects between the polyacid/polybase pairs block the water-rich domains, which are mainly associated with \u2013SO 3 \u2013 and \u2013COOH clusters on the substrate surface [22] . Thus, the PEC multilayer is effective as a methanol barrier. Furthermore, it can be seen from Table 1 that the methanol diffusion coefficient increases with an increase in the temperature. Similar to the proton conduction, the methanol diffusion is also thermally stimulated. The selectivity, which is defined as the ratio of proton conductivity to methanol permeability, is often used to evaluate the potential performance of DMFC membranes [32] . Fig. 9 shows the selectivity of SPAEK\u2013COOH\u2013(CTS/PTA) n and Nafion \u00ae 117 at 25 \u00b0C. CTS/PTA multilayer modified SPAEK\u2013COOH membranes show a gradually increasing tendency with an increase in the number of deposited bilayers. The selectivity of SPAEK\u2013COOH\u2013(CTS/PTA) 8 is 2 orders of more than Nafion \u00ae 117, which is attractive for applications in DMFC. 4 Conclusions Novel multilayered PEC proton-exchange membranes based on SPAEK\u2013COOH were successfully prepared from CTS and PTA by the LBL method. SEM results showed the presence and stability of thin CTS/PTA layers coated on SPAEK\u2013COOH membranes. It shows significant effect on reduction in methanol diffusion, water uptake and swelling. The methanol diffusion values are about 1 order of magnitude less than SPAEK\u2013COOH and 2 orders of magnitude less than Nafion \u00ae 117. Most importantly, the modified SPAEK\u2013COOH membranes by LBL self-assembly shows a slightly higher or much smaller negative effect on proton conductivity, a significant advantage compared to other modification approaches and previous LBL assembled electrolyte systems [22] . The selectivity of SPAEK\u2013COOH\u2013(CTS/PTA) n membranes are over 2 orders of magnitude higher than Nafion \u00ae 117, which is attractive in DMFC. Thus, LBL self-assembly of inorganic heteropolyacid is a convenient and effective method for preparing excellent polyelectrolyte membranes for DMFC applications.

The electrocatalytic activity of this Pt/C-A catalyst for oxygen reduction is excellent because the Pt/C catalyst prepared with this pre-precipitation method possesses a small average particle size, low relative crystalinity and a large electrochemically active surface area. In addition, the pre-precipitation method is simple and economical and it can be used to prepare a Pt/C catalyst on a large scale.",

The sensor effectively operates on a basis of measuring the current output produced by methanol diffusion through the Nafion 115 membrane. The sensor displays a robust sensitivity to the widely used methanol concentration (from 0 to 5 M) and operating temperature (from 30 to 60 \u00b0C), as proved by the steady-state polarization measurements. Particularly, linear correlation was presented between the output current of the senor and the methanol concentration from 0 to 2 M. The stability test shows that the sensor has an average degradation rate as low as 1.22 mA cm-2 h -1. Therefore, the as-fabricated sensor shows a promising application in DMFCs in terms of its high sensitivity, high stability and the merits of simple processing, fabrication and low cost. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

By taking advantage of the strong electrostatic interactions between Nafion \u00ae ionomer and CS component, Nafion ionomer is effectively implanted into the PVA/CS composite membranes, and improves proton conductivity of the PVA/CS composite membranes. Furthermore, this effect dramatically depends on the composition ratio of PVA/CS, and the optimum conductivity is obtained at the PVA/CS ratio of 1:1. The developed composite membranes exhibit much lower methanol permeability compared with the widely used Nafion \u00ae membrane, indicating that these novel membranes have great potential for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs).",

It was demonstrated that in the pH 7.2 phosphate buffer solution, the interaction of TH and CT-DNA is in the intercalative mode. The absorbance of the absorption peak of TH decreases and the peak position shifts to the red direction. The binding constant (K) of TH with CT-DNA is 1.45x 10(4) mol x L(-1). The fluorescence intensities of TH decrease drastically with increasing the concentration of CT-DNA. The Stem-Volmer quenching constant (Ksv) was calculated to be 1.01 x 10(4) mol x L(-1). The intercalative sites are mainly located at the G-C sequences of the CT-DNA molecule through the S atom in the TH molecule according to the experimental data obtained from the fluorescence spectra and XPS analysis. The secondary structure conformation of CT-DNA is changed due to its interaction with TH.",

The additional catalyst layer formed an assistant cell with the cathode to prevent methanol crossover. A simple one-dimensional mathematical model was presented to describe the performance of this new type of membrane electrode assembly system. As seen from both experimental result and model analysis, the additional catalyst layer can not only effectively prevent the methanol crossover, but also generate electrical power with the crossover methanol. The percentage of output power of the assistant cell to the total power analyzed by the model is about 40% under usual condition, which is much higher than that from experimental result, indicating the potential of the development in the DMFC designing. It was also discovered that the electrical power generated from the assistant cell with crossover methanol could take higher percentage in total electrical power when the main DMFC current density became lower.",

It shows high electrocatalytic activity and stability for both the ORR process with onset potential of 1.03 V in alkaline and the CO2RR to CO with high faradic efficiency up to 90% and selectivity of about 100% at low overpotential of 0.49 V. For CO2RR to CO, it is revealed that Fe C is active but the activity of FeN centers is lower than that of C-N-based centers, contrary with that observed for ORR. Due to its low cost and high electrocatalytic performance for these two reduction reactions, the obtained catalyst is very promising for extensive application in future. The revealed huge activity difference of the same types of active sites for different reactions can efficiently guide the synthesis of advanced materials with multifunction.",

Abstract A new single passive direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) supplied with pure methanol is designed, assembled and tested using a pervaporation membrane (PM) to control the methanol transport. The effect of the PM size on the fuel cell performances and the constant current discharge of the fuel cell with one-fueling are studied. The results show that the fuel cell with PM 9 cm 2 can yield a maximum power density of about 21 mW cm \u22122 , and a stable performances at a discharge current of 100 mA can last about 45 h. Compared with DMFC supplied with 3 M methanol solution, the energy density provided by this new DMFC has increased about 6 times. Keywords Passive direct methanol fuel cell Pervaporation membrane Pure methanol Power density 1 Introduction The DMFC is a promising power source for portable applications due to its high energy density, long life and so on [1\u20134] . The theoretical specific energy and energy density of pure methanol are about 6100 Wh kg \u22121 and 4800 Wh L \u22121 . In practice, the fuel supplied at the anode of passive DMFC must be a low methanol concentration (less than 5 M). Therefore, this will lead to a short runtime of the fuel cell, and the specific energy and energy density will be largely decreased. In order to increase the operation time, several efforts [5\u20138] have been carried out to develop advanced DMFC technology. Abdelkareem et al. [5,9,10] employed a porous carbon plate to increase the mass transport resistance on the anode and realized to supply the fuel cell with high methanol concentration over 20 M. Kim et al. [11,12] used the hydrogels to control the methanol transport from the fuel reservoir to the anode even at high fuel concentration. Pervaporation membrane (PM) was employed for the separation of mixture of liquids and several new membranes were reported to separate the small molecular substances such as methanol, ethanol, and water and so on [13\u201315] . Based on the properties of PM, in our experiment, the work was tentatively to introduce the PM into a single passive DMFC and to check if it can be used to control the methanol transport on the anode. Therefore, in this communication, a new fuel cell structure was proposed with PM to control the methanol transport when the fuel was supplied with pure methanol. The experiment results demonstrated that the passive DMFC with the proposed new structure can successfully operate with pure methanol. Under the same condition, the discharge time of the proposed DMFC supplied with pure methanol at a constant current was much longer than that of the conventional fuel cell supplied with methanol solution. 2 Experimental 2.1 Membrane electrode assembly Pt\u2013Ru and Pt black catalysts (Johnson Matthey) were used as anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, respectively. The carbon papers (TGP-H-60, Toray) with 20% and 40% polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) content were used as anodic and cathodic backing layers, on which carbon black (Vulcan-XC 72) with PTFE content of about 20% and 40% as the micro-porous layer had been pre-coated with a loading of 2 mg cm \u22122 respectively. Nafion \u00ae -117 membrane (DuPont Co., USA) was pretreated before use [16,17] . The catalyst ink consisted of the catalyst, deionized water, isopropyl alcohol and Nafion solution (5 wt.%, DuPont Co., USA) was coated on the carbon backing layer to fabricate the electrodes. The catalyst loading as high as 8 mg cm \u22122 is used on each electrode to achieve high performance. The Nafion ionomer loading in the catalyst was 10 wt.% for the cathode and 15 wt.% for the anode, defining by the ratio that dry ionomer takes up in the catalyst layer. The MEA, area of 9 cm 2 , was fabricated by sandwiching the membrane between the anode and the cathode, and then it was hot-pressed at 408 K and 5 MPa for 3 min. 2.2 Fuel cell design and test The single fuel cell structure is shown in Fig. 1 , which is a modification for the conventional fuel cell structure [18] . The fuel tank is divided into two tanks: a pure methanol tank and a low methanol concentration tank (reaction chamber). The PM of 0.17 mm thick was bought from Beijing Hongzhi Jiahe Technology Co., China and used as-received. The PM was fixed between the two tanks to control the methanol transport. The fixing of the PM was not clear in Fig. 1 , here, it was further explained. In order to easily change the effective PM size, the PM was sandwiched between two polycarbonate sheets (0.5 mm thick). The apparent PM size was close to that of the polycarbonate sheet and an open size of the desired effective PM area was machined on the polycarbonate sheet. The fringe of the open size was covered by adhesive-sealant silicone and then the PM was sandwiched between the two polycarbonate sheets. The PM sandwiched between the polycarbonate sheets was fixed between the pure methanol tank and reaction chamber at the anode. The low methanol concentration tank was the reaction chamber for the anodic oxidation of methanol and it was about 3 mm in thickness. The volumes of the reaction chamber and the pure methanol tank were about 2.7 mL and 5 mL, respectively. Other components such as current collectors, fuel cell body were the conventional parts used in fuel cell [19,20] . The polarization curves of the single fuel cell were measured during discharge process with a Fuel Cell Test System (Arbin Instruments Co.). The discharge curves of voltage vs. time were also tested at a constant current to record the voltage. For comparison, the MEA prepared in the same patch was also tested in a conventional single fuel cell with a dilute methanol solution. The designed fuel cell supplied with pure methanol was denoted as DMFC-P, and the conventional fuel cell supplied with a dilute methanol solution was denoted as DMFC-S. For the DMFC-S, the volume of the fuel tank was about 7.7 mL, which equaled to the sum of the volume of the reaction chamber and the pure methanol tank of the DMFC-P. The fuel cell was tested at ambient conditions (20\u201325 \u00b0C). 3 Results and discussion Prior to testing the DMFC-P, a small amount of water of about 2 mL was syringed into the reaction chamber to wet the anode of the fuel cell. According to the anodic oxidation of methanol, the water is necessary for the reaction. Therefore, the syringed water can be used to dilute the penetrated methanol for the initial anodic methanol oxidation. The water needed for the reaction during the fuel cell operation was obtained from the water created on the cathode [20\u201322] . According to our experiment, if the MEA has been soaked in the water, the foregoing step could be omitted. The pure methanol was injected and the injection port was sealed completely during the operation. Before testing, the voltage of open circuit was recorded until the stable high voltage was reached; the process lasted for several minutes. For the purpose of comparison, the DMFC-S fed with a dilute methanol solution was tested in the same conditions. 3.1 Effect of pervaporation membrane size In order to know the effect of the PM size on the performances of the DMFC-P and to find an optimal PM size, the PM with apparent area of about 9, 6, 3 and 1 cm 2 was employed. Because of the difficulty to measure the methanol concentration in the anodic catalyst layer, the polarization curves of the DMFC-S supplied with different methanol solution were tested and according to the similar curves, the methanol concentration of the DMFC-P was obtained by a rough estimate. The polarization curves and power density curves are shown in Fig. 2 . The features of the curve for the DMFC-S were consistent with the results published elsewhere [23,24] . When the methanol concentration was increased, the performance became much better and the maximum power density was about 22 mW cm \u22122 for the DMFC-S with 3 M methanol solution. For the DMFC-P, the performance of PM with 9 cm 2 was about 21 mW cm \u22122 , which was close to the performance of the DMFC-S with 3 M methanol solution. When the PM size was decreased, it was evident from Fig. 2 that the maximum power density was also decreased. The cell performance of PM with 6 cm 2 was between the performance of 3 M and 2 M methanol solution for the DMFC-S. For PM with 3 and 1 cm 2 , the corresponding performances were higher and lower than those of 1 M methanol solution for the DMFC-S, respectively. Therefore, the concentration of methanol on the anodic side of DMFC-P can be approximately estimated according to the polarization curves in Fig. 2 . For the DMFC-P, the best power density was obtained by using PM with 9 cm 2 . It was interesting that the polarization curves with different PM sizes for the DMFC-P have similar features. For instance, when the current density was below 50 mA cm \u22122 , the performance was close to that of the DMFC-S supplied with methanol solution. However, when the current density was above 60 mA cm \u22122 , the polarization curve decreased much faster than that of DMFC-S supplied with methanol solution. This reason can be explained by the transport limitation of the methanol. At high current density, the performance is controlled by the transport rate of methanol. For the DMFC-P, at high current density, the methanol penetrated through the PM cannot meet the demand of methanol consumed during the fuel cell operation. Therefore, the polarization curves appeared the limitation of the mass transport. 3.2 Discharge time of the fuel cell with one-fueling For the passive DMFC, from a practical aspect, it is much better if the cell can operate for a longer time with one-fueling. The following experiment was conducted on the DMFC-P supplied with 5 mL pure methanol and 2 mL water using PM with 9 cm 2 . For the purpose of comparison, the DMFC-S supplied with the same volume of 3 M methanol solution was evaluated. The two kinds of DMFC were operated at 100 mA at ambient conditions. The curves of the output voltage vs. runtime are shown in Fig. 3 A and the curves of the initial 10 h are also shown in Fig. 3 B. The fluctuation of voltage was very small for the DMFC-P, but the reasons were complicated. There were several parameters that may lead to the fluctuation of voltage such as the temperature fluctuation in the fuel cell, the change of methanol transport rate, the change of water amount from cathode and the evolution of CO 2 gas product at anode. It was evident that the operation time of the DMFC-P was much longer than that of the DMFC-S; meanwhile, the output voltage of the DMFC-S was stable, which was close to that of the DMFC-S with 3 M methanol solution. Because of using the pure methanol, it was no doubt that the DMFC-P had a long runtime. Above the acceptable voltage of 0.35 V, the runtime of DMFC-P and DMFC-S was 45 and 7 h, respectively. The corresponding energy density (defining as energy vs. fuel volume) was about 260.57 and 41.4 Wh L \u22121 for the DMFC-P and DMFC-S, respectively, which indicated that the energy density increased about 6 times. In fact, the Faradic efficiency and energy efficiency of the DMFC-P were still low. Specifically, the energy efficiency was 8% and 7% for the DMFC-P and DMFC-S, respectively. Compared to the DMFC-S, the energy efficiency of the DMFC-P was not greatly increased. It can be mainly attributed to the evaporation and crossover of the pure methanol. However, it was evident that the discharge time of the DMFC-P was greatly increased with the same fuel cell system volume as compared with that of the DMFC-S. Based on this point, the DMFC-P has advantage than the conventional passive DMFC supplied with dilute methanol solution. From the above discussion, PM can be successfully used to control the methanol transport, and the DMFC-P can yield a stable and good performance for a long runtime with one-fueling. Though there are some difficulties in practical application, it gives us a hope or an idea to increase the operation time for passive DMFC. 4 Conclusions A new single passive DMFC supplied with pure methanol using a PM to control the methanol transport was designed and tested. The maximum power density of approximately 21 mW cm \u22122 was obtained with the PM size of 9 cm 2 . When the fuel cell was discharged at 100 mA, the operation time of the DMFC-P was increased about 6 times as compared with that of the DMFC-S.

        "title": "Low methanol permeable composite Nafion/silica/PWA membranes for low temperature direct methanol fuel cells",
        "abstract": "Nafion/silica/phosphotungstic acid (PWA) composite membranes were studied for low temperature (<100 \u00b0C) direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). The composite membranes were prepared by sol\u2013gel reaction of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) within the nanophase of hydrated perfluorosulfonic acid membranes (Nafion 117) and the subsequent treatment in phosphotungstic acid (PWA) solution. X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicates that the silica can decrease the crystallinity of Nafion. The silica in membranes can greatly decrease the methanol diffusion coefficient ( D ) within appropriate silica content range. The proton conductivities ( \u03c3 ) of these composite membranes are higher than those of commercial Nafion 117. The result of \u03c3 / D shows the optimal silica content in composite membrane is 38.2 \u03bcg/g. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the incorporation of silica and PWA does not affect the thermostability of membrane. The data from single direct methanol fuel cell using these two membranes of commercial Nafion without treatment and Nafion/silica/PWA composite membranes with optimal silica content as polymer\u2013electrolyte show that the cell with composite membrane has higher open circuit voltage (OCV = 0.75 V) and maximal power density ( P max = 70 mW/cm 2 ) than those of commercial Nafion without treatment (OCV = 0.68 V, P max = 62 mW/cm 2 ) at 80 \u00b0C. Keywords Nafion DMFC Methanol Composite electrolytes Proton conductivity 1 Introduction Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have attracted considerable attention for potential applications and advantages in view of their low weight, easy manipulation, high efficiency and low poison emissions [1\u20134] . Perfluorosulfonate ionomer membranes, such as Nafion membranes, are the primary membranes used in the DMFCs presently. However, the commercial Nafion membranes do not meet the requirement for sufficiently low methanol permeability especially at low temperatures (<100 \u00b0C) [5] . The methanol permeation results in not only a loss of fuel but also a mixed potential being established at the cathode and leading to a lower overall voltage performance. So, for the liquid fuel cells it is very important to reduce the permeation of liquid fuel through membrane. Advanced membrane materials with high ionic conductivity and low methanol permeability are of important significance for developing DMFCs with high performance. Up to now many people have reported the properties of Nafion/silica-based composite. Antonucci et al. [6] , Dimitrova et al. [10] and Shao et al. [7] have recast Nafion/silica composite membranes with Nafion solution and used them in high temperature (145 \u00b0C) DMFCs. They found that the incorporation of silica into Nafion avoided the loss of proton conductivity up to 145 \u00b0C with the ability of maintaining water. Fenton and co-workers [9] recast the Nafion/heteropolyacid (HPA) composite for H 2 /O 2 fuel cell and found that the HPA can increase the conductivity of the membrane. Later Staiti et al. [8] recast Nafion/silica/phosphotungstic acid (PWA) composite membranes for high temperature (145 \u00b0C). Many basic studies have been done on these Nafion/silica composite membranes [11\u201315] ; some work about the application of the modified commercial Nafion membranes also has been done [16,17] . Adjemian et al. [16] and Jung et al. [17] modified the commercial Nafion 115 membranes with sol\u2013gel reaction of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and applied them to the H 2 /O 2 fuel cells and DMFC, respectively. They found that the silica incorporated into the membrane decreases the proton conductivity of membrane at low temperature (<100 \u00b0C). So in the present work, we try to maintain the high proton conductivity of membrane with the incorporation of good proton conductor of PWA. The commercial Nafion/silica/PWA membranes were prepared by in situ sol\u2013gel reaction in Nafion 117 and subsequent treatment in PWA solution. The composite membranes were characterized with XRD and TGA. The effects of incorporated silica on methanol permeability and proton conductivity were examined by electrochemistry monitoring technique [18,19] and two-terminal impedance analyzer, respectively. The single DMFC performance of these composite membrane and commercial Nafion without treatment in DMFC at 80 \u00b0C was also evaluated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The deionized water was prepared with Millipore (>18 M\u03a9). Sulfuric acid (Shen Yang, China) was obtained in 98% purity and used as received. Methanol (Beijing, China) was washed over alumina, filtered, distilled, and stored refriger. The silicon tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and phosphotungstic acid (PWA, Keggin-type) were supported by Aldrich and used as received. 2.2 Pretreatment of commercial Nafion and preparation of composite membranes The commercial Nafion membranes (N117) were pretreated by boiling for over 1 h for each step in 30% H 2 O 2 , in deionized water, in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 , and again in deionized water. Thus, the pretreated membranes in acid form were stored in deionized water before use. The composite membranes were prepared by in situ sol\u2013gel reaction in pretreated initially hydrated and alcohol-containing N117 that was immersed in TEOS/methanol solutions of 3:2 (v/v) for different prescribed times and subsequent treatment in PWA solution. The membranes immersed in this TEOS/methanol solution for different times were taken out, surface-blotted dry, and finally placed under high vacuum for 72 h at room temperature, and then 2 h were spent in heating at 110 \u00b0C. Half of the dried\u2013annealed samples were stored in a desiccator, prior to the different measurements (Nafion/silica composite membranes). The other half were subsequently immersed in saturated phosphotungstic acid (Keggin-type: PW 12 O 40 H 3 ) water solution for 24 h. Then, the membranes were washed with deionized water for three times to remove the surface PWA molecules and then dried\u2013annealed under high vacuum for 24 h at 80 \u00b0C and then stored in a desiccator prior to the different measurements (Nafion/silica/PWA composite membranes). The percent weight uptakes of silicon and tungsten in final annealed\u2013dried Nafion/silica/PWA were determined with inductively coupled plasma\u2013mass spectrometry (ICP\u2013MS), POEMS Model (TJA Corporation). 2.3 Area loss of membranes and the stability of PWA in membranes The area loss of membrane after the incorporation of silica was characterized by the following experiment: two pieces of pretreated Nafion membranes (previously dried at 120 \u00b0C in oven under high vacuum for 24 h) with area of 2 cm\u00d72 cm were cut and immersed in 50 mL TEOS/methanol solution of 3:2 (v/v) for 2 h and 12 h, respectively. Then the membranes were taken out and the areas were measured in wetting state. Next, the membranes were washed with deionized water for three times and immersed in concentrated PWA solution for 24 h, and then washed with deionized water for three times again, dried at 120 \u00b0C in oven under high vacuum for 24 h, and in the last the areas were measured. The stability of PWA in membranes was studied by inspecting the changes of acidity of the water solution before and after the immersion of composite membranes for 30 min at 60 \u00b0C. 2.4 Measurements of proton conductivity The measurements of proton conductivity, \u03c3 (S/cm), of membranes were carried out at room temperature via the ac impedance spectroscopy using a Princeton Applied Research Model 273A Potentiostat (Model 5210 Frequency Response Detector, EG&G PARC, Princeton, NJ) from 10 Hz to 1 MHz, 10 mV ac perturbation and 0.0 V dc rest voltage. A sample of the membrane (0.9 cm in diameter) was placed between two smooth platinum (Pt) disk electrodes of the same diameter. The electrode\u2013membrane\u2013electrode sandwich is embedded between two exactly fitting half cell made of Telfon material, which are immersed in deionized water at room temperature. The proton conductivity of the membranes was calculated using the following equation with the value of membrane resistance obtained in the above experiment: \u03c1 = L R S where \u03c1 , L , R , and S denote the proton conductivity, thickness of membranes, the resistance of the membrane and the cross-sectional area of the membrane, respectively. 2.5 Measurements of methanol permeability The diffusion coefficient, D (cm 2 /s), of methanol was determined using the electrochemical monitoring technique [17,18] at room temperature. During the measurement, membrane was supported by a platinum mesh, which served as a current collector for the working electrode. An Ag/AgCl electrode was used as a reference electrode and a platinum foil as a counter electrode. The potential of working electrode was kept at a constant value of 0.7 V versus Ag/AgCl, where the complete methanol oxidation is controlled by the transport of methanol through membrane. 2.6 XRD measurements XRD measurements were performed using a conventional diffractometer (Rigaku D/maximum 2500 VPC) that employs Ni-filtered Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The dried sample membranes were mounted on an aluminum sample holder. The scanning angle ranged from 1\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 with a scanning rate 2\u00b0 min \u22121 . All the spectra were taken at ambient temperature (22 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C). 2.7 Thermoanalysis A Perkin Elmer computer/thermal analyzer was used to obtain the TGA thermograms under N 2 at 30 mL/min with rate of 10 \u00b0C/min for different samples: dry commercial Nafion 117 and dry composite membrane. The thermograms were obtained from 30 \u00b0C to 630 \u00b0C. 2.8 Fabrication of the membrane\u2013electrode assembly (MEA), and measurement of single cell performance The pretreated commercial N117 was directly used to prepare the MEAs. The composite membranes with optimal silica content were immersed in deionized water for 48 h before the preparation of MEAs. Catalyst slurries were prepared by mixing 2-propanol solution, PTFE solution, and 20% Pt/C for cathode ink and 60% PtRu/C for anode ink supplied by E-TEK. For fabrication of MEA, the catalyst slurry was coated on carbon paper (SGL, Germany) for the electrode substrate. The Pt loadings were approximately 1.5 mg/cm 2 and 2 mg/cm 2 for anode and cathode, respectively. The effective electrode area of the single cell was 4.0 cm 2 . The MEAs for the DMFC test cell were made by hot-pressing pretreated membranes together with an anode sheet and a cathode sheet at 120 \u00b0C, under the pressure of 50 atm for 120 s. The fuel was 2 M CH 3 OH delivered at 2 mL/min by a micropump and oxygen pressure was 1.6 atm at 500 mL/min with a working temperature of 80 \u00b0C. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Silica and tungsten contents versus immersion time Fig. 1 a shows that the silica content increases slowly with immersion time initially. When the immersion time is larger than 15 min, the silica content increases greatly. The dependence of tungsten content on the immersion time is shown in Fig. 1 b which indicates the existence of PWA. Obviously, the higher the silica content, the higher is the tungsten content. A possible reason for this may be that more silica can fixup tightly the more PWA molecules. On the other hand, when the time is long enough the content of silica or tungsten increases quickly. This phenomenon may be attributed to the slight partial dissolution of membranes in TEOS/MeOH solution when immersion time is too long. This explanation can be supported by the following measurements of area loss, methanol permeability, and proton conductivity. 3.2 The area loss of composite membranes and the stability of PWA in membrane The results for the area loss of composite membranes after the incorporation of silica are shown in Table 1 . Obviously, Nafion membrane can be swelled greatly in TEOS/MeOH solution. As shown in Table 1 , the swelling was up to 56% with the immersion time of 2 h. After treating in PWA solution and dried, the area loss was up to 5% compared with the initial dried membrane area. When the immersion time is longer (24 h), the phenomena of swelling and area loss were more serious. This result can only be explained by the slight partial dissolution of Nafion backbone. The stability of PWA in membrane was studied by immersing the Nafion/silica/PWA composite membrane in deionized water. The result showed that the acidity of water solution has almost no change after immersing for 30 min at 60 \u00b0C. This indicated, the PWA molecules in the membranes were very stable and would not leak out easily. Based on this fact it can be sure that the PWA molecules have been truly fixup tightly by silica network when the PWA catalyzed the hydrolyzation and condensation reaction of TEOS in membrane [20] . Generally the anions of POM are not stable in Nafion membrane for the repulsion of static electricity from \u2212SO 3 \u2212 [9] . This is not consistent with the above fact. The possible reason is that, in the present experiment, PWA molecules entered the membrane through the way opened by TEOS, which partially dissolved the Nafion backbone. After the hydrolyzation and condensation reactions of TEOS, catalyzed by the acid of PWA, the product of silica network fixup tightly the PWA molecules. The silica network absorbed many water molecules [6\u20138] . This water-rich surrounding enables the PWA to be an effective proton conductor. 3.3 Microstructure characterization by X-ray diffraction data Wide-angle X-ray investigation was made to provide information about the morphological properties, mainly to assess the degree of crystallinity of the sample. Typical wide-angle X-ray diffraction profiles for Nafion/silica/PWA composite membranes are shown in Fig. 2 . The broad diffraction peaks at 2 \u03b8 = 12\u00b0\u201320\u00b0 result from a convolution of amorphous (2 \u03b8 = 16\u00b0) and crystalline (2 \u03b8 = 17.5\u00b0) scattering from the perfluorocarbon chains of Nafion. Fig. 3 shows detailed information on these aspects derived from a peak profile analysis. By comparison of these diffractograms, a decrease of the ratio (or crystallinity) between the area of crystalline peak and the amorphous scattering with the increasing of silica content is apparent in composite membranes. This fact is contrary with the results reported by others with recast method [6\u201310] . The difference probably came from different preparation methods. Adjemian et al. [16] and Jung et al. [17] had not reported the effect of silica incorporated on the crystallinity of Nafion membrane. Here we attribute to that the TEOS molecules entered the crystalline region and interrupted its continuity. 3.4 Methanol permeability Fig. 4 a shows the methanol diffusion coefficients of Nafion/silica composite membranes. For these membranes, the value of methanol diffusion coefficients decreases with the increasing of silica content, at low silica content. The lowest methanol diffusion coefficient is 2.8 \u00d7 10 \u22127 cm 2 /s, while methanol diffusion coefficient for the commercial Nafion without treatment is 5.2 \u00d7 10 \u22127 cm 2 /s. This phenomenon is constant with those reported by others [6\u201310] . A possible reason for this result may be that the incorporated silica particles tend to hold up methanol. When the silica content is up to 70.2 \u03bcg/g the methanol permeability increases abnormally. The highest methanol diffusion coefficient is 9.0 \u00d7 10 \u22127 cm 2 /s at the silica content of 291 \u03bcg/g. These phenomena can be explained by the partial dissolution of Nafion in the TEOS/MeOH solution and the formation of microholes in membranes. The following result of proton conductivity of membranes can also be explained as the above. Fig. 4 b shows the dependence of diffusion coefficients on the silica content for the Nafion/silica/PWA membranes. The varying tendency was similar to that of curve a except a small decreasing. The reason possibly is the hydrolyzation and condensation reactions catalyzed by PWA tightened the microstructure of the membrane and further held up methanol. 3.5 Proton conductivity Fig. 5 a shows the results of proton conductivity of Nafion/silica composite membranes; clearly the proton conductivity decreases with the increasing of silica content. This phenomenon is consistent with those reported by others [6\u201310] . The decreasing of proton conductivity is attributed to the inhibition of the free proton conduction in the membrane with the increasing of silica content [17] . Fig. 5 b shows the relationship of proton conductivity with silica content for Nafion/silica/PWA composite membranes. Obviously, the proton conductivity increases according to the increase of silica content. The reason for this obviously is that more silica network fixup tightly more proton-conducted PWA molecules shown in Fig. 1 b. But when the silica content is up to 70 \u03bcg/g, the proton conductivity increases slowly. The reason for this slight increasing probably is the loss of proton conductive \u2212SO 3 \u2212 group caused by the partial dissolution of Nafion in TEOS/methanol solution. From the above results of proton conductivity and methanol permeation it was found that the immersion time of membrane in TEOS/methanol solution should not exceed 15 min under this condition, or else the nonpolar TEOS molecules will dissolve the Nafion nonpolar C F backbone to lose \u2212SO 3 \u2212 group seriously. The too much loss will deteriorate the proton conductivity and the methanol permeability. 3.6 Determination of the optimal composition of Nafion/silica/PWA composite membrane from \u03c3 / D The integrated properties of a new proton exchange membrane are usually characterized by the ratio of \u03c3 / D [21] . That is to say, higher the value of \u03c3 / D , the better is the membrane. Fig. 6 shows the result of \u03c3 / D for different Nafion/silica/PWA composite membranes. From the highest points of the curve, it is found that the optimal content of silica in composite membrane is 38.2 \u03bcg/g. The following results are based on this optimal composite membrane. 3.7 Thermoanalysis The TGA thermograms for composite Nafion/Silica/PWA membrane with silica content of 38.2 \u03bcg/g and the commercial Nafion without treatment are displayed in Fig. 7 . It can be seen that the samples retain more than 92% weights up to a temperature of about 330 \u00b0C. The lost components mainly are the small molecules such as water, CH 3 OH and CH 3 CH 2 OH [11\u201315] . After this point, all samples start decomposing rather rapidly. It is clear from the Fig. 7 that the incorporation of silica and PWA does not deteriorate the thermal stability of membrane. 3.8 Performance of single cells Fig. 8 shows the polarization and power density curves for MEAs equipped with Nafion/silica/PWA composite membrane with optimal silica content and commercial Nafion without treatment. The performance of the single cell was measured at 80 \u00b0C. As shown in Fig. 8 , the performance of the single cell with composite membrane is better than that with commercial Nafion without treatment. The cell with composite membrane has higher open circuit voltage (OCV = 0.75 V) and maximal power density ( P max = 70 mW/cm 2 ) than those of commercial Nafion without treatment (OCV = 0.68 V, P max = 62 mW/cm 2 ). The higher open circuit voltage clearly indicates that silica impregnated into Nafion membrane has truly decreased the rate of methanol crossover in these composite membranes. The higher maximal power density indicates a better performance of Nafion/silica/PWA than that of commercial Nafion without treatment. 4 Conclusions Nafion/silica/PWA composite membranes have been prepared for low temperature DMFC by sol\u2013gel reaction of TEOS within the Nafion 117 and the subsequent treatment in PWA solution. The incorporation of silica and PWA has resulted in higher proton conductivity and lower methanol permeation of membranes and does not affect its thermal stability. The data from single cell show that the Nafion/silica/PWA composite membrane with optimal silica content has higher performance than that of commercial Nafion 117 without treatment with higher open circuit voltage and maximal power density at 80 \u00b0C.

        "abstract": "A novel strategy in which the benzimidazole group and sulfonic group are simultaneously attached to an aromatic polymer has been reported in this paper. For this purpose, sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) copolymers containing carboxylic acid groups (SPAEK- x -COOH, x refers to the molar percentage of sulfonated repeating units) are prepared by the aromatic nucleophilic polycondensation of sodium 5,5\u2032-carbonyl-bis(2-fluobenzene-sulfonate) (SDFBP), 4,4\u2032-difluorobenzophenone (DFBP) and phenolphthalin (PPL). Then the carboxylic acid groups attached to the SPAEK- x -COOH are transformed to benzimidazole units through condensation reactions (referred to as SPAEK- x -BI). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 1 H NMR measurements are used to characterize and confirm the structures of these copolymers. SPAEK- x -COOH membranes exhibit superior mechanical properties with maximum elongations at break up to 133%, meanwhile SPAEK- x -BI also shows good thermal and mechanical stability. The proton conductivity, swelling ratio and methanol permeability of the polymers with benzimidazole are lower than those with carboxylic groups, which indicated that there is an acid\u2013base complex between benzimidazole and sulfonic acid groups. A balance of proton conductivity, methanol permeability, thermal and mechanical stabilities can be designed by incorporation of functional groups to meet the requirements for the applications in direct methanol fuel cells.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, it was found that glucose oxidase (GOD) has been stably immobilized on glassy carbon electrode modified with mesoporous carbon FDU-15 (MC-FDU-15) and Nafion by simple technique. The sorption behavior of GOD immobilized on MC-FDU-15 matrix was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013vis), FTIR, respectively, which demonstrated that MC-FDU-15 could facilitate the electron exchange between the active center of GOD and electrode. The direct electrochemistry and electrocatalysis behavior of GOD on the modified electrode were characterized by cyclic voltammogram (CV) which indicated that GOD immobilized on Nafion and MC-FDU-15 matrices display direct, reversible and surface-controlled redox reaction with an enhanced electron transfer rate constant of 4.095 s \u22121 in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) (pH 7.12). Furthermore, it was also discovered that, in the presence of O 2 , GOD immobilized on Nafion and MC-FDU-15 matrices could produce a linear response to glucose. Thus, Nafion/GOD-MC-FDU-15/GC electrode is hopeful to be used in glucose biosensor. In addition, GOD immobilized on MC-FDU-15 and Nafion matrices possesses an excellent bioelectrocatalytic activity for the reduction of O 2 . So, the Nafion/GOD-MC-FDU-15/GC electrode can be utilized as the cathode in biofuel cell. Keywords Direct electron transfer Electrocatalysis Glucose oxidase Mesoporous carbon FDU-15 Glucose",

For the purpose of comparison, WO 3 /C is also prepared by a conventional method using sodium tungstate as the precursor. These two WO 3 /C species are denoted as WO 3 /C-1 and WO 3 /C-2, respectively. It is shown from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) that the WO 3 particles in WO 3 /C-1 present a more even distribution and smaller particle size than those in WO 3 /C-2. Pt particles dispersed on WO 3 /C-1 display the characteristic diffraction peaks of Pt in the face-centered cubic phase. Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry show that the Pt\u2013WO 3 /C-1 catalyst exhibits much better methanol oxidation activity than the Pt\u2013WO 3 /C-2 and Pt/C catalysts. This significant improvement in catalytic performance may be attributed to the hydrogen spillover effect and the uniform distribution of Pt and WO 3 particles.",

Phosphotungstic acid can be fixed within PECs membranes through strong electrostatic interactions, which avoids the decrease of conductivity caused by the dissolving of phosphotungstic acid as previously reported. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows that the PECs membranes are homogeneous and dense. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) demonstrates that hydrogen bonding is formed between chitosan and phosphotungstic acid. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the PECs membranes have good thermal stability up to 210 \u00b0C. The PECs membranes exhibit good swelling properties and low methanol permeability ( P , 3.3 \u00d7 10 \u22127 cm 2 s \u22121 ). Proton conductivity ( \u03c3 ) of the PECs membranes increases at elevated temperature, reaching the value of 0.024 S cm \u22121 at 80 \u00b0C. Keywords Polyelectrolyte complexes Proton conducting Chitosan Phosphotungstic acid 1 Introduction Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) with polymer electrolyte membranes are promising candidates for portable devices or transportation applications in view of their high energy density, easy manipulation, and high efficiency [1\u20133] . As one of the crucial components of DMFCs, polymer electrolyte membranes function as both electrolyte and separation of the cathode and anode. Perfluorosulfonic acid membranes, such as Nafion \u00ae membranes, are the primary membranes applied in DMFCs presently. However, commercial Nafion \u00ae membranes do not meet the requirement for low methanol permeability especially at low temperatures (<100 \u00b0C) [4] . The methanol permeation results in a reduced open-circuit potential (OCP) and a poisoning of the electrocatalysts at the cathode. To date, effort has been made to develop new alternatives and extensive researche has been done on the modifications to Nafion \u00ae to reduce methanol cross-over. The approaches are diverse, ranging from doping with inorganic materials such as sulfonated montmorillonite [2] , silica [5] , silica/phosphotungstic acid [6] , etc., depositing a Pd thin film on the surface of Nafion \u00ae [7] to in situ polymerization with poly(1-methylpyrrole) [8] . Polymer materials based on the arylene main chain such as poly (ether ether ketone)s [9] and polybenzimidazoles [10] , have been prepared and functionalized as proton-conducting membranes. Composite membranes, which consist of polymer materials and inorganic materials, for example, phosphoric acid-doped polybenzimidazole [11] and polysulfone/heteropolyacid [12] , have also been studied because of the controllable chemical and physical properties produced by combining different properties of the components. Pore-filling membranes, which are composed of a porous substrate and a filling polymer electrolyte, have shown good performance and have been widely studied as proton-conducting membranes [13,14] . Generally, oppositely charged polyions (polycations or polyanions) interact electrostatically to form polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs). Such PECs have recently attracted considerable attention due to their application in a broad field [15] . However, little literature about PECs as proton-conducting membranes has been found except in ref [16] . Chitosan ( Fig. 1 A ) is a natural and low-cost biopolymer which has many excellent properties such as biocompatibility, nontoxicity, chemical and thermal stability, thus it has been widely studied as a promising source of membrane materials [17,18] . As a kind of polycation, chitosan is extremely attractive to prepare PECs by electrostatic interaction with polyanions [19] . The acids and salts of heteropolyanions constitute a large category of compounds which have high potential for practical applications [20] . However, no report has been found about the PECs formed between chitosan and heteropolyanions so far. [PW 12 O 40 ] 3\u2212 is a kind of heteropolyanion and its molecular structure is shown in Fig. 1 B. Phosphotungstic acid, H 3 PW 12 O 40 , possesses a unique discrete ionic structure and exhibits extremely high proton conductivity [21] . As a good inorganic proton conductor, phosphotungstic acid has played an important role in developing proton-conducting membranes [22\u201332] . However, phosphotungstic acid is likely to be dissolved in the electrochemically produced water and leak out during the cell operation, thus performance would decay [24,25] . It has been found that the mixing of chitosan solution and phosphotungstic acid solution leads to electrostatic interactions to form PECs. Therefore, phosphotungstic acid can be fixed within the membranes through electrostatic interaction and the PECs of chitosan and phosphotungstic acid in the form of thin films can be considered as novel proton-conducting membranes. In the present work, we firstly report the PECs formed between chitosan and phosphotungstic acid. The PECs as proton-conducting membranes for DMFCs were evaluated in terms of SEM, FTIR, TGA, swelling behavior, proton conductivity, and methanol permeability. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Chitosan powder (Haidebei Ltd., China) has the degree of deacetylation of 95% and the molecular weight of 50000 g mol \u22121 . Phosphotungstic acid (Keggin-type) was supported by Aldrich and used as received. Sodium hydroxide and acetic acid were purchased from Beihua Fine Chemical, Beijing, China. The deionized water was prepared with Millipore (>18.23 M\u03a9). 2.2 Formation of insoluble PECs of chitosan and phosphotungstic acid 1% (w/v) chitosan solution was prepared by dissolving chitosan powder in 2% (v/v) acetic acid solution. After chitosan powder had been fully dissolved, this chitosan solution was filtered and deformed by leaving it quiescent at ambient temperature for 2 h. Then, 0.5 ml chitosan solution was put into a test-tube and then 0.5 ml 0.02 M phosphotungstic acid (Keggin-type) solution was added. 2.3 Membrane preparation and the stability of phosphotungstic acid in membrane The chitosan solution above was poured onto a glass plate and left to dry via evaporation for 24 h and then heated at 60 \u00b0C for 6 h. The dried membranes were neutralized in 1 M NaOH and then washed thoroughly [33] . The membranes above were immersed in 0.05 M phosphotungstic acid solution for 24 h, and then were washed with deionized water and stored in deionized water prior to the different measurements. The stability of phosphotungstic acid in the membranes was tested as follows: the prepared membranes (in the following referred to as PECs membranes) were washed thoroughly in water with stirring at 60 \u00b0C for 12 h, then the resulted membranes from the process were termed washed membranes. The percent weight of tungsten in PECs membranes and washed membranes were determined with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), POEMS MODEL (TJA Corporation). 2.4 Scanning electron microscopy The morphology of the PECs was characterized by a LEO 1525 FE-SEM scanning electron microscope. 2.5 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy The IR spectra (4000\u2013500 cm \u22121 , resolution 4 cm \u22121 ) were recorded in absorbance mode with a Bruker Vertex 70 RTIR spectrometer. 2.6 Thermal analysis The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a Perkin-Elmer thermal analysis system. Measurements were made heating from 40 to 650 \u00b0C, at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 under N 2 atmosphere. 2.7 Swelling behavior The swelling of membranes was evaluated by water uptake and dimensional change. The water uptake of the membranes was determined in the following way: membrane samples were equilibrated in deionized water at ambient temperature for 24 h, and the swollen membranes ( W w ) were weighed as quickly as possible after surface-attached water on the membranes was removed with filter paper. Weight of dry membrane ( W d ) was determined after being completely dried in 60 \u00b0C for 12 h. The water uptake was calculated using the following equation: (1) WU \u2009 ( % ) = W w \u2212 W d W d \u00d7 100 The dimensional change of the PECs was also investigated in the procedure above. The changes of thickness and width were calculated by the following equations: (2) \u0394 L = L \u2212 L d L d , \u2003 \u2003 \u0394 T = T \u2212 T d T d where L and T are the length and thickness of the membranes, respectively, and the subscript \u201cd\u201d denotes the dry membranes. 2.8 Measurements of proton conductivity Proton conductivity of the PECs and Nafion \u00ae 112 membranes was measured by a four-electrode ac impedance method from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz, 10 mV ac perturbation and 0.0 V dc rest voltage. Impedance spectra were recorded using a Princeton Applied Research Model 273A Potentiostat (Model 5210 Frequency Response Detector, EG&G PARC, Princeton, NJ). The membranes were fixed in a measuring cell made of two outer gold wires to feed current to the sample and two inner gold wires to measure the voltage drops [34] . Conductivity measurements under fully hydrated conditions were carried out with the cell immersed in liquid water. The proton conductivity ( \u03c3 ) of the membranes was calculated using the following equation: (3) \u03c3 = L R A where L , R , and A denote the distance between the two inner gold wires, the resistance of the membrane, and the cross-sectional area of the membrane, respectively. 2.9 Measurements of methanol permeability Methanol permeability of these membranes was determined utilizing a glass diffusion cell. This glass cell consisted of two chambers each approximately 100 ml; one chamber of the cell was filled with 2 M methanol solution, and the other with deionized water. The membrane (effective area 4.5 cm 2 ) was clamped between the two compartments which were kept under stirring during an experiment. The methanol concentration in the receptor chamber was measured versus time using a gas chromatography (Shimazu GC-14B) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The methanol permeability was calculated by the following equation: (4) C B ( t ) = A P V B L C A ( t \u2212 t 0 ) where C B ( t ) is the concentration of methanol measured in the receptor compartment as a function of time, V B the volume of receptor compartment, and L and A are the thickness and effective area of membrane, respectively. P is the methanol permeability and can be determined from the slope of the plot of methanol concentration in the receptor compartment versus time. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Formation and stability of insoluble PECs membranes Insoluble PECs were formed in a test-tube when phosphotungstic acid solution was added. The percent weight of tungsten in the PECs membranes and washed membranes were 15.2 and 14.5%, respectively, therefore the percent weight of phosphotungstic acid (excluding crystalline water) in PECs membranes and washed membranes could be calculated. The results show that the percent weight of phosphotungstic acid in washed membranes (19.2%) is lower than that in PECs membranes (20.1%), which might be attributed to physically absorbed phosphotungstic acid. Based on the above phenomenon, phosphotungstic acid could be fixed by electrostatic interaction, which avoids the decrease of proton conductivity as a result of dissolving and leak of phosphotungstic acid. 3.2 Scanning electron microscopy Part A and B of Fig. 2 show the surface and cross-sectional images of PECs. From the both images, it can be observed that the PECs membranes are homogeneous, dense, and with no obvious phase separation, which suggests that phosphotungstic acid does not recrystallize into large particles, but interact electrostatically with chitosan. 3.3 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy Figs. 3 and 4 present the IR spectrum of phosphotungstic acid, chitosan and PECs membranes. The IR spectra of phosphotungstic acid (Keggin-type) in Fig. 3 show four characteristic bands at 1080 (P\u2013O a ), 983 (W O d ), 891 (W\u2013O b \u2013W) and 803 cm \u22121 (W\u2013O c \u2013W) [31] . All of these characteristic bands of phosphotungstic acid (Keggin-type) are also presented in the spectra of PECs membranes, which indicates the preservation of the Keggin ion geometry in the PECs membranes. The bands at 951 and 785 cm \u22121 of the PECs membranes, which are attributed to W O d band and W\u2013O c \u2013W band, decrease significantly in comparison with pure phosphotungstic acid. Such behavior indicates that the Keggin unit of phosphotungstic acid interacts (hydrogen bonding) with hydroxyl groups or amino groups of chitosan [29,30] . The peaks of the PEC membranes near 1077 and 890 cm \u22121 are ascribed mainly to P\u2013O a band and W\u2013O b \u2013W band, even partially to chitosan. The IR spectra of chitosan in Figs. 3 and 4 show a strong band at 3451 cm \u22121 for OH stretch, two strong bands at 3364 and 3313 cm \u22121 for NH stretch, and two weak CH stretch bands at 2910 and 2864 cm \u22121 . The bands at 1152, 1068 and 1030 cm \u22121 can be assigned to the saccharide structure [35] . In comparison with the IR spectra of chitosan, the IR spectra of PECs in Fig. 4 show a broad band at 3404 cm \u22121 for OH stretch, and single band at 3239 cm \u22121 for NH stretch. 3.4 Thermal analysis The thermal stability of the PECs membranes was studied by thermogravimetric analysis, as shown in Fig. 5 . There are three major weight loss stages around 40\u2013150, 210\u2013280, and 280\u2013650 \u00b0C in the tested temperature range. The 5% weight loss takes place in the first stage and the lost components mainly are small molecules such as physically absorbed water and acetic acid [24] . The thermal degradation of PECs membranes takes place at a maximum rate in the temperature range from 210 to 280 \u00b0C. The 14% weight loss can be attributed to the release of structural water from phosphotungstic acid [29] . In the third stage, above 280 \u00b0C, the weight loss is assigned to structure collapse of phosphotungstic acid [29,32] and thermal decomposition of polymeric netwok. So it can be concluded that the PECs membranes are stable at desired operating temperatures (<100 \u00b0C) for DMFCs. 3.5 Swelling behavior The swelling property has a profound effect on proton transport and dimensional stability of proton-conducting membranes. Proton transport requires a significant amount of water to coordinate with protons. However, excessively high levels of water uptake can result in the dimensional change of membranes, which leads to the loss of mechanical properties. Table 1 shows the results of water uptake and dimensional change for the PECs and Nafion \u00ae 112 membranes. The water uptake of the PECs is 17%, slightly higher than that of Nafion \u00ae 112 (15%). The dimensional change (\u0394 L , \u0394 T ) of PECs membranes is smaller than that of Nafion \u00ae 112 (about 20%). Furtherly, the dimensional change of PECs membranes both in length and in thickness are all the same (17.6%), indicating an isotropic property of the PECs membranes. The experimental results above indicate that the PECs membranes display better swelling property than Nafion \u00ae 112. 3.6 Proton conductivity Fig. 6 shows the variations in proton conductivity with temperature for the PECs membranes. The conductivity of the PECs membranes is measured at four different temperatures. The PECs membranes exhibit a marked increase in proton conductivity with increasing temperature and reach the highest proton conductivity of 0.024 S cm \u22121 at 80 \u00b0C in the tested temperature range. The conductivity of PECs is in the order of 10 \u22122 S cm \u22121 , which is inferior to that of Nafion \u00ae 112 membranes (in the order of 10 \u22121 S cm \u22121 ). The change of proton conductivity with temperature follows the Arrhenius relationship as depicted in Fig. 7 . From the Arrhenius plots, the activation energy can be calculated, which is 15.2 kJ mol \u22121 . In solid phosphotungstic acid with crystalline water, the proton migration can be ascribed to the vehicle mechanism [36] . For the Grotthuss mechanism, activation energy for proton conduction is around 14\u201340 kJ mol \u22121 [16] and the value obtained for the PECs membranes falls into the range. We suspect that both the vehicle mechanism and the Grotthuss mechanism are responsible for the proton conduction of PECs membranes. 3.7 Methanol permeability The methanol permeability of the PECs and Nafion \u00ae 112 membranes are measured at ambient temperature, respectively, and the results are shown in Table 1 . The methanol permeability of the PECs is 3.3 \u00d7 10 \u22127 cm 2 s \u22121 ; while the permeability of Nafion \u00ae 112 is 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u22126 cm 2 s \u22121 . The permeability of PECs is approximately 1/6 of that of Nafion \u00ae 112. This indicates that methanol cross-over may significantly be reduced if the PECs are used in DMFCs. The polymer electrolyte membranes applied in DMFCs should possess simultaneously high proton conductivity and low methanol permeability. Membrane performances can be estimated from the ratio of proton conductivity ( \u03c3 ) to methanol permeability ( P ). That is to say, the higher the value of \u03c3 / P is, the better the performance of the membrane would be [31] . Fig. 8 shows the results of \u03c3 / P for the PECs and Nafion \u00ae 112 at different temperature. It can be noticed that: (1) both the ratio of \u03c3 / P for the PECs and that for Nafion \u00ae 112 increase with elevated temperature, yet the ratio of \u03c3 / P for the PECs changes comparatively faster than that for Nafion \u00ae 112; (2) the ratio of \u03c3 / P for the PECs and that for Nafion \u00ae 112 are close to each other in the tested temperature range; in other words, the PECs are equivalent to Nafion \u00ae 112 in terms of their performance. 4 Conclusions Polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) of chitosan and phosphotungstic acid have been prepared and evaluated as novel proton-conducting membranes for direct methanol fuel cells. The homogeneous PECs membranes show good thermal stability up to 210 \u00b0C and exhibit a relatively high proton conductivity ( \u03c3 , 0.024 S cm \u22121 at 80 \u00b0C) and a low methanol permeability ( P , 3.3 \u00d7 10 \u22127 cm 2 s \u22121 ). In addition, phosphotungstic acid can be fixed within the membrane through strong electrostatic interactions. Therefore, the PECs are promising proton-conducting materials and have great potential for application in DMFCs.

It was found that high catalyst loading could suppress the methanol crossover effectively,but too high catalyst loading can lead to high mass transport resistance. Hydrophobic anodic MPL with 30% ( by mass) PTFE could facilitate the CO2 bubble detachment,which decreased the methanol concentration gradient and suppressed the methanol crossover accordingly. When Nafion 115 was used as membrane,methanol crossover was severe,while Nafion 117 was used, the water in cathode could not be effectively back-flowed to the anode by hydraulic pressure. For considerations of complicated interactions and trades-off between the water and methanol crossover effects,the optimized MEA showed peak power density of 33 mW\u00b7cm-2 at ambient conditions,the best working methanol concentration was 4 mol\u00b7L-1.",

        "abstract": "A novel sulfonated diamine monomer, 1,4-bis(4-aminophenoxy)-naphthyl-2,7-disulfonic acid (BAPNDS), was synthesized. A series of sulfonated polyimide copolymers were prepared from BAPNDS, 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTDA) and nonsulfonated diamine 4,4\u2032-diaminodiphenyl ether (ODA). Flexible, transparent, and mechanically strong membranes were obtained. The membranes displayed slightly anisotropic membrane swelling. The dimensional change in thickness direction was larger than that in planar. The novel SPI membranes showed higher conductivity, which was comparable or even higher than Nafion 117. Membranes exhibited methanol permeability from 0.24 \u00d7 10 \u22126 to 0.80 \u00d7 10 \u22126 cm 2 /s at room temperature, which was much lower than that of Nafion (2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 cm 2 /s). The copolymers were thermally stable up to 340 \u00b0C. These preliminary results have proved its potential availability as proton-exchange membrane for PEMFCs or DMFCs. Keywords Sulfonated polyimide Proton conductivity Degree of sulfonation 1 Introduction Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have attracted much attention because of their high power density and high energy conversion efficiency as well as low pollution levels [1\u20134] . One of the main components of a PEMFC is proton-exchange membrane (PEM) itself. Hydrated perfluorosulfonic acid membranes, such as DuPont's Nafion membrane, are typically used as the proton-exchange membrane in PEMFCs. However, there are still some drawbacks, such as high cost, low operation temperature, and less echo-friendly [5] . These limitations have stimulated many efforts in the development of alternative membrane materials based on sulfonated aromatic polymers [6\u201316] . Among these new polymers, sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes were shown to be very promising materials for electrochemical applications in terms of proton conductivity, selectivity, stability and cost. Hence, various structures of SPI materials were synthesized and studied [17\u201339] . For instance, Mercier group first successfully synthesized NTDA-based SPI and tested it in fuel cells [17\u201320] . Okamoto's group [21\u201328] has developed two types of SPIs (main-chain type and side-chain type) intending to study systematically the structure\u2013property relationship of SPIs. Watanabe's group has reported sulfonated polyimide copolymers introducing aliphatic segments both in the main and in the side chains, and a stability of more than 5000 h has been achieved in fuel cell [29\u201332] . We have also developed a kind of binaphthyl type sulfonated polyimide (SPI 1, the chemical structures are shown in Fig.\u00a01 ), and investigated the relationship between the chemical structure and membrane properties [39] . They showed well microphase-separated structures and higher conductivity. However, unfortunately, these membranes showed poor water stability at higher temperatures because of membranes' excessive swelling. It may be since nonplanar binaphthyl group results in polymer chain easy relaxation and produces large interchain space in which more water molecules can be held. To prevent membrane excessive swelling, a novel sulfonated diamine bearing naphthyl groups 1,4-bis(4-aminophenoxy)-naphthyl-2,7-disulfonic acid (BAPNDS) was devised. Furthermore, sulfonic acid groups were located at the same side of the main chains. It may be favorable for forming hydrophilic clusters, by which better proton conductivity performance would be achieved. In this article, we report on the preparation of BAPNDS and the corresponding SPI. Through several experiments such as water uptake, proton conductivity, and water stability, the relationship between the chemical structure and membrane properties is discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Naphthalene-2,7-diol, 4-chloronitrobenzene, 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTDA) was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co.

Found: C, 51.55%; H, 3.78%; N, 5.32%; S, 13.03%. 2.3 Synthesis of random NTDA\u2013BAPNDS\u2013ODA copolyimides A synthesis procedure of sulfonated copolyimide is described below using SPI 50 as an example. To a 100 mL completely dried three-necked flask were added 0.5025 g (1 mmol) of BAPNDS, 3.0 mL of m -cresol, and 0.35 mL of Et 3 N, with stirring under nitrogen flow. After BAPNDS was completely dissolved, 0.2000 g (1 mmol) of ODA, 0.5364 g (2 mmol) of NTDA and 0.5495 g of benzoic acid were added to the flask. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for a few minutes and then heated to 80 \u00b0C for 12 h and 180 \u00b0C for 12 h. After cooling to 80 \u00b0C, the solution was poured into acetone. The resulting fiber-like precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with acetone, and dried in vacuo at 80 \u00b0C for 12 h. 2.4 Membrane formation and proton exchange The SPI membranes were obtained by solution casting using NMP as solvent. The films were dried at 80 \u00b0C for 20 h. The membranes were soaked in alcohol at room temperature for 12 h to remove the residual solvent. The proton-exchange treatment in 1 mol/L H 2 SO 4 solution at room temperature and the completion of proton exchange was confirmed by 1 H NMR measurement judging from the disappearance of the peaks\u00a0corresponding to triethylamine, followed by washing with deionized water several times. 2.5 Measurements Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were determined with a Bio-Red Digilab Division FTS-80 spectrometer. 1 H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity spectrometer at 300 and 600 Hz with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. Tandem gel permeation chromatography/light scattering (GPC/LS) was done at 30 \u00b0C using an HPLC 515 pump connected to Wyatt Optilab DSP and Wyatt DAWN EOS light scattering detectors. Separations were achieved using HMW 6E columns with 0.1 M LiBr in DMF as eluent and flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The polymer solutions were filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm PTFE filter prior to injecting into the column. The molecular weight was calibrated with polystyrene standard. Thermogravimetric analyses were obtained at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min in nitrogen atmosphere with a Perkin\u2013Elmer TGA-2 thermogravimetric analyzer. The tensile measurements were carried out on an Instron model 1122 at room temperature. Inherent viscosities were determined at 30 \u00b0C with an Ubbelodhe viscometer, and the concentration was 0.5 g/dL in\u00a0NMP. The ionic-exchange capacity (IEC) was measured by means of a classical titration method. A membrane sample of about 100 mg was soaked in 50 mL of a saturated NaCl solution for 2 days. Released protons were titrated using a 0.1 mol/L NaOH solution. 2.6 Water uptake and dimensional change Water uptake was measured by immersing an SPI sample into water at 80 \u00b0C for 5 h. Then the membrane was taken out, wiped with tissue paper very quickly, and weighed on a microbalance. Water uptake was calculated from the following equation: (1) S = ( W s \u2212 W d ) / W d \u00d7 100 % where W d and W s are the weights of dry and corresponding water-swollen membranes, respectively. Size change of SPI membrane was investigated by immersing three sheets of samples in water at 80 \u00b0C for 5 h. The changes of thickness and diameter were calculated from the following equation: \u0394 t = ( t \u2212 t s ) / t s (2) \u0394 l = ( l \u2212 l s ) / l s where t s and l s are the thickness and diameter of the membrane equilibrated at atmosphere, respectively; t and l refer to those of the membrane immersed in liquid water. 2.7 Methanol permeability measurement A glass diffusion cell was used to obtain the methanol permeability of the SPI membrane. The glass cell was composed of two chambers divided by a membrane sample. One chamber of the cell ( V 1 ) was filled with a 2 M ( C 1 ) methanol solution in distilled water. The other chamber ( V 2 ) was filled with water. A sample (effective area 3.80 cm 2 ) was clamped between the two chambers. Methanol permeates across the membrane by the concentration difference between the two chambers. The methanol concentration in the receiving chamber as a function of time is given by (3) C 2 ( t ) = A V 2 D K l C 1 ( t \u2212 t 0 ) where A (cm 2 ) is the membrane area, l (cm) the membrane thickness, D the methanol diffusivity, and K the partition coefficient between the membrane and the adjacent solution. The product DK means the membrane permeability ( P ): (4) P = C 2 ( t ) A C 1 ( t \u2212 t 0 ) V 2 l C 2 is measured several times during the permeation experiment and the methanol permeability is obtained from the slope of the straight line. The methanol concentration was measured by using a gas chromatography equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (Shimadzu, GC-2010A, Tokyo, Japan). 2.8 Proton conductivity Proton conductivity was measured using a four-point-probe electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique (Model 5210 Frequency Response Detector, EG&GPARC, Princeton, NJ) over the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. A sample of the membrane and two pairs of gold plate electrodes were set in a Teflon cell. The distance between two electrodes was 1 cm. The cell was placed in a thermo-controlled chamber in liquid water for measurement. Proton conductivity was calculated using the following equation with the value of membrane resistance obtained in the above experiment: (5) \u03c3 = L / ( R S ) where \u03c3 , L , R , and S denote the proton conductivity, thickness of membranes, the resistance of the membrane and the cross-sectional area of the membrane, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterization of monomer and copolyimides BAPNDS monomer was prepared according to common methods and the synthetic routes are shown in Scheme 1 . First, BNPN was synthesized from compound naphthalene-2,7-diol and 4-chloronitrobenzene. Water was generated as the by-product of the reaction and was removed with toluene as an azeotroping agent. Then, BNPN was sulfonated by concentrated sulfuric acid at 90 \u00b0C for 4 h. The electrophilic substitution reaction occurred on ortho position to ether bond. Finally, BNPNDS was reduced in alcohol using hydrazine monohydrate as the reducing agent and Pd/C as the catalyst to obtain the sulfonated diamine BAPNDS. The chemical structure of the obtained product was characterized by 1 H NMR, FT-IR, and elemental analysis. A series of novel sulfonated copolyimides were synthesized by copolymerization of NTDA, BAPNDS, and common unsulfonated diamine (ODA) in the presence of triethylamine and benzoic acid ( Scheme 2 ). This is a literature method that has been used for the preparation of various six-membered ring polyimides [19] . The obtained copolyimide membranes were proton-exchanged with 1.0 M H 2 SO 4 at room temperature and the completion of proton exchange was confirmed by disappearance of the peaks corresponding to triethylamine in 1 H NMR spectrum. The IEC values obtained from titration (1.294\u20132.127 mEq/g) were slightly smaller than the theoretical value (1.289\u20131.970 mEq/g). The chemical structure of sulfonated polyimide was confirmed by 1 H NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy. Fig.\u00a02 shows the 1 H NMR spectrum of SPI 60. Aromatic protons were well assigned to the chemical structure of the copolyimide. The integration ratios of the peaks corresponded well to the polymer composition from the feed\u00a0monomers. Fig.\u00a03 shows the FT-IR spectrum of SPI 60\u00a0(proton\u00a0form). FT-IR: 1714 (C O, symmetric), 1670 (C O, asymmetric), 1345 (C\u2013N, symmetric), 1036 (S O, symmetric), 1120 cm \u22121 (S O, asymmetric). The resulting SPIs showed excellent solubility. They (triethylamine salt form) can be soluble in common polar solvents, such as (DMAc), N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Table 1 shows properties of sulfonated polyimide copolymers. The molecular weights of the polymers were evaluated by\u00a0GPC using DMF as the eluent and the data are listed in Table 1 . The number molecular weights ( M n ) of the sulfonated polymers in the proton form are in the range from 44,630 to 74,330 and the polydispersity indices ( M w / M n ) are between 1.014 and 1.140. 3.2 Water uptake and dimensional change The water uptake of the sulfonated polyimide films was evaluated and is given in Table 2 and Fig.\u00a04 . Generally, higher IEC shows higher water uptake, because the introduction of sulfonic acid group makes the polymer membranes hydrophilic. As expected, water uptake increases with increase in the amount of sulfonyl group. SPI 40\u2013SPI 70 exhibited an increase in water uptake from 8.32 to 44.36%. Fig.\u00a04 shows the water uptake of naphthyl polymers (SPI) and binaphthyl polymers (SPI 1), they had different water uptake behavior. In addition, the difference of water uptake values between SPI and SPI 1 membranes became much large with increasing sulfonated diamine content. For binaphthyl polymers (SPI 1), nonplanar binaphthyl group results in polymer chain easy relaxation and produces large interchain space, so more water molecules were held. In the case of naphthyl polymer (SPI), the ionic channels were relatively narrow, thus the water molecules might be localized in a limited area, which were favorable of decrease membrane swelling. It proved that reasonable water uptake and membrane swelling can be controlled by the changes in the chemical structure. The SPI membranes displayed slightly anisotropic membrane swelling. The dimensional change in thickness direction was larger than that in planar. The ratios of \u0394 t /\u0394 l were in the range of 1.8\u20133, indicating the more significant anisotropic membrane swelling. 3.3 Proton conductivity and methanol permeability Conductivity of the sulfonated polyimides with different sulfonated degrees was measured against increasing temperature and is given in Table 2 and Fig.\u00a05 . Proton conductivities of these copolyimides are strongly dependent on their IEC and water uptake, membranes with higher IEC and larger water uptake tend to have higher proton conductivities. For example, membranes with degrees of sulfonation of 50, 60 and 70% exhibit conductivities at 30 \u00b0C of 0.0836, 0.1320 and 0.1720 S/cm, respectively. For comparison purpose, the conductivity data of binaphthyl type polyimide membrane (SPI-1-70) and Nafion 117 are also shown in Fig.\u00a05 . It can be seen that for all the polyimide membranes the proton conductivities increased with increasing the temperature, which is\u00a0a typical behavior as has been observed for Nafion 117 and many other sulfonated polymer membranes. Naphthyl type sulfonated polyimide (SPI 70) displayed the highest proton conductivity among these membranes due to the highest IEC. However, it should be noted that although naphthyl type sulfonated polyimide SPI 60 (IEC = 1.882) and binaphthyl type sulfonated polyimide SPI-1-70 (IEC = 1.81) had similar IEC, the former showed higher proton conductivities than latter. Furthermore, SPI 60 displayed much lower water uptake than SPI-1-70. It showed a different trend from water uptake. This might be related to substitution position of the sulfonic acid groups. Sulfonic acid groups located at the same side of the main chains will be favorable for forming hydrophilic clusters, thus better proton conductivity performance would be achieved. Polymer membranes exhibited methanol permeability at 20 \u00b0C of 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22127 to 8 \u00d7 10 \u22127 cm 2 /s depending on the degree of sulfonation. These values are around one order of magnitude lower than that of Nafion membranes (2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 cm 2 /s) at the same temperature. The proton conductivity and methanol permeability ratio \u03c6 ( \u03c6 = \u03c3 / P M ) at 20 \u00b0C was 19 \u00d7 10 4 to 27 \u00d7 10 4 S s/cm 3 , which was about 4\u20135 times larger than that of Nafion 117. These characteristics reduce the hydrodynamic solvent transport, which may help reduce the problems associated with water and methanol crossover for direct methanol fuel cells. 3.4 Thermal stability and mechanical properties Thermal stability of the sulfonated polyimides was investigated by TGA measurement. The onset temperature for the second and the third degradation steps is given in Table 3 , and the thermograms are shown in Fig.\u00a06 . All the sulfonated polyimide films exhibited three-step degradation patterns. The initial weight loss around 100 \u00b0C is due to the absorbed water in the membrane. The second step of degradation around 340 \u00b0C corresponds to the degradation of sulfonic acid groups. The third step indicates the decomposition of the polyimide backbone (around 550 \u00b0C). The TGA curve clearly indicates that this polyimide has fairly good thermal stability. It is essential for electrolyte membranes to retain the mechanical strength under humidified conditions in light of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) to be used in fuel cells. To evaluate the mechanical properties of membranes under wet conditions, membranes were immersed in liquid water at room temperature. After one day of equilibration, the tensile properties of these membranes were measured and are depicted in Table 4 . The membrane initial Young's modulus is from 1.128 (SPI 40) to 0.9578 GPa (SPI 70). The maximum tensile stress at break was from 80.556 (SPI 40) to 36.218 MPa (SPI 70). These results showed that the SPI membrane was tough enough at high moisture conditions, which is favorable for practical application in PEMFCs or DMFCs. 3.5 Membrane stability The stability test toward water of the polyimide membranes was performed by immersing the membranes into distilled water at 100 \u00b0C and characterized by the elapsed time until the hydrated membranes lost mechanical properties. The criterion for the judgment of the loss of mechanical properties is that the membrane sheet starts breaking into pieces under boiling. Table 5 lists the IEC, water uptake, and the water stability of the polyimide membranes. Usually water stability of polymer membranes is strongly dependent on the water uptake. Membranes with lower water uptake should have better water stability. Naphthyl SPI displayed better water stability than binaphthyl SPI with the same nonsulfonated diamine moiety (ODA) and similar IEC. The naphthyl SPI also displayed better water stability than other main-chain type sulfonated polyimide, for example, NTDA\u2013BAPFDS/ODA (1/1) and NTDA\u2013ODADS/ODA (1/1) [22] . Compared to side-chain\u00a0type sulfonated polyimide [25,29] , our SPI membranes showed rather poor water stability. The results suggest that the substitution position of the sulfonic acid groups had significant influence on the membrane stability. The longer the distance between the sulfonic acid group and the amine group, the better the water stability of the resulting SPI. The stability of the copolyimides to oxidation was also investigated by immersing the membranes (the size of each sheet: 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 cm 2 ) into Fenton's reagent (30 ppm FeSO 4 in 30% H 2 O 2 ) at 30 \u00b0C. The oxidative stability of the membranes was characterized by the expended time that the membranes started to become a little brittle (the membrane was broken when it was lightly bent). As listed in Table 5 , the oxidation stabilities of these membranes are comparable to that of some sulfonated polyimides with the sulfonic acid groups directly bonded to the polymer backbone [21,22] . The SPI membrane exhibited higher proton conductivity and lower methanol permeability compared with the Nafion 117 membrane, but their membrane stability did not reach the stringent membrane criteria for practical applications yet. Therefore, we will focus on the development of high performance membrane materials with long-term durability under hydrolysis and free radical attacks in future work. 4 Conclusions A series of novel SPIs were prepared from NTDA, BAPNDS, and common nonsulfonated diamines. Tough and transparent membranes were obtained from solution casting. The novel SPIs displayed good solubility in common polar solvents and high thermal stability of the sulfonic acid groups up to 350 \u00b0C. They showed high proton conductivities in liquid water, for example, SPI 70 showed conductivity values of 0.27 S/cm at 80 \u00b0C, which has higher proton conductivity than Nafion 117. Naphthyl SPI membranes displayed lower water uptake values than binaphthyl SPIs and exhibited smaller dimensional changes. The dimensional change was clearly anisotropic, with much larger swelling degree in thickness direction than that in plane. The SPI exhibited good mechanical properties before and after the treatment in water at 100 \u00b0C for 240\u2013500 h, and this indicated higher flexibility and robustness in both dry and hydrated states. These electrolyte properties (thermal stability, mechanical strength, and proton conductivity) seem promising for the application to PEMFCs and DMFCs.

        "abstract": "A series of novel multiblock copolymers based on sulfonated copolyimides were developed and evaluated for use as proton exchange membranes (PEMs). In these multiblock copolyimides, the hydrophilic blocks were composed of the sulfonated dianhydride and the sulfonated diamine, with sulfonic acid groups on every aromatic ring (i.e., fully sulfonated). This molecular design was implemented to effectively enhance the proton conductivity. The properties of the multiblock copolyimides with varying IEC values or block lengths were investigated to obtain a better understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and properties of proton exchange membranes. The water uptake and proton conductivity were found to be highly dependent upon their structure. The block copolymers displayed significantly higher proton conductivities, especially at low relative humidity than the random copolymers with a similar IEC. The results indicated that the distribution of sulfonic acid and the length of the blocks play a key role on properties of proton exchange membranes. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Herein, a novel binuclear active site structure, Co2NxCy, is intentionally designed and successfully fabricated to efficiently catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is achieved by precisely controlling the atomic scale structure of bimetal-organic frameworks before pyrolysis. Through discovering a two-atom site with Co-Co distance at 2.1\u20132.2\u202f\u00c5 from aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), as well as a novel shortened Co-Co path (2.12\u202f\u00c5) from the X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we for the first time identified the binuclear Co2NX site in the pyrolyzed catalyst. Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the structure is further confirmed as Co2N5. Excitingly, the Co2N5 site performs approximately 12 times higher activity than the conventional CoN4 site and the corresponding catalyst shows unprecedented catalytic activity in acidic electrolyte with half-wave potential of 0.79\u202fV, approaching the commercial Pt/C catalyst and presenting the best one among the Co-N-C catalysts. Theoretical density functional theory calculations reveal that the novel binuclear site exhibits considerably reduced thermodynamic barrier towards ORR, thus contributing to the much higher intrinsic activity. Our finding opens up a new path to design efficient M-Nx/C catalysts, thus pushing the fuel cell industry field one step ahead.",

Owing to the excellent promotion effect of Ni2 P that was found in methanol oxidation, we extended the catalyst system of Pt or Pd modified by Ni2 P in direct ethanol fuel cells. The Ni2 P-promoted catalysts were compared to commercial catalysts as well as to reference catalysts promoted with only Ni or only P. Among the studied catalysts, Pt/C and Pd/C modified by Ni2 P (30\u2005wt\u2009%) showed both the highest activity and stability. Upon integration into the anode of a homemade direct ethanol fuel cell, the Pt-Ni2 P/C-30\u2009% catalyst showed a maximum power density of 21\u2005mW\u2009cm(-2) , which is approximately two times higher than that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst. The Pd-Ni2 P/C-30\u2009% catalyst exhibited a maximum power density of 90\u2005mW\u2009cm(-2) . This is approximately 1.5\u2005times higher than that of a commercial Pd/C catalyst. The discharge stability on both two catalysts was also greatly improved over a 12\u2005h discharge operation.",

        "abstract": "A novel method was developed to prepare the highly active Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst. The deposition of phosphorus significantly increased electrochemical active surface (EAS) area of catalyst by reduces Pt\u2013Ru particle size. TEM images show that Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P nanoparticles have an uniform size distribution with an average diameter of 2 nm. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), Chronoamperometry (CA), and CO stripping indicate that the presence of non-metal phosphorus as an interstitial species Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst shows high activity for the electro-oxidation of methanol, and exhibit enhanced performance in the oxidation of carbon monoxide compared with Pt\u2013Ru/C catalyst. At 30 \u00b0C and pure oxygen was fed to the cathode, the maximum power density of direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) with Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C and Pt\u2013Ru/C catalysts as anode catalysts was 61.5 mW cm \u22122 and 36.6 mW cm \u22122 , respectively. All experimental results indicate that Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst was the optimum anode catalyst for direct methanol fuel cell. Keywords Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C Electrocatalyst Phosphorus Direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) 1 Introduction In recent years, fuel cells attracted significant attention because of its high energy density, low temperature operation and low pollution. Especially the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) showed promising prospect as a potential power generator for portable electronic devices and vehicular applications [1\u20135] . However, DMFC has some critical technical drawbacks including the low catalytic activity in methanol electro-oxidation, low catalyst efficiency and CO poisoning of the anode. To date, the bimetallic Pt\u2013Ru catalyst dispersed on carbon is one of the most promising anode electrocatalysts for methanol and carbon monoxide-containing hydrogen [6\u201310] . Because of electronic substrate effects and low potentials to oxidize chemisorbed carbon monoxide by the activation of H 2 O, this catalyst exhibits enhanced CO tolerance by lowering CO binding energy on platinum [7,11,12] . However, as for the successful application of DMFCs, in particular, either the catalytic performance or the amount of noble metal catalysts should be reduced significantly. And further, this catalyst system is susceptible to CO poisoning [13\u201315] . Therefore, the development of catalysts with smaller particle sizes (and hence higher active area) will decrease the amount of noble metal required and lower the fuel cell cost. Also, the discovery of new catalysts with high methanol oxidation activity and good CO tolerance has been a key research objective in the DMFC area [16\u201320] . Ultrafine amorphous alloy particles (UAAP) consisting of transition metal (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) and metalloid element phosphorus have been studied extensively because of their interesting chemical and physical properties [21\u201324] . Many studies have addressed on the influences of P on the electronic state of metal elements, which obviously should have significant effects on some of the properties, e.g. magnetic and catalytic properties, of UAAP [24\u201326] Okamoto et al. reported that a variation in 3d electron density on the nickel metal induced by phosphorus would modify the activity and selectivity of the nickel catalyst for hydrogenation [26] . Herein, we firstly described a novel, cost-effective route to synthesize carbon-supported Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P nanoparticles, which have an average diameter of 2 nm, narrow particle size distribution and high electrochemical active surface (EAS) area. These Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P particles can be highly dispersed on the carbon surface. The presence of phosphorus as an interstitial species in Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst shows very high activity for the electro-oxidation of methanol and exhibits enhanced performance in the oxidation of carbon monoxide. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals The H 2 PtCl 6 \u00b7 6H 2 O (further referred to as H 2 PtCl 6 ) and RuCl 3 \u00b7 xH 2 O (further referred to as RuCl 3 ) were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. NaH 2 PO 2 \u00b7 H 2 O (further referred to as NaH 2 PO 2 ) was purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich Co. Vulcan Carbon powder XC-72 was purchased from Cabot Corporation. Ultrapure water (18.2 M\u03a9) was used to prepare the solutions. All solvents were reagent grade and used as received unless otherwise noted. 2.2 Preparation of Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C electrocatalysts Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalysts were prepared as follows. First, H 2 PtCl 6 and RuCl 3 solutions by the molar ratios of Pt:Ru = 1:1 were mixed with Vulcan XC-72 carbon in the distilled water. And then the solutions above were ultrasonic agitation for 30 min in air at the room temperature. After the appropriate amount of the NaH 2 PO 2 solution was added into the mixture, the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 9.2 by 5% NaOH solution. This solution was heated to 90 \u00b0C for 10 h, and then cooled in air, before the carbon-supported Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P catalysts were filtered and washed with distilled water. Finally these catalysts were dried at 80 \u00b0C in vacuum oven. 2.3 Physical characterization of Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C and Pt\u2013Ru/C electrocatalysts The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the catalysts were obtained using a Rigaku-D/MAX-PC 2500 X-ray diffractometer with the Cu K\u03b1 ( \u03bb = 1.5405 \u00c5) radiation source operating at 40 kV and 200 mA. The bulk composition of the prepared catalysts was evaluated by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) on a XL30 ESEM FEG scanning electron microscopy operating at 20 kV. The TEM images were recorded on a JEOL 2010 transmission electron microscopy operating at 200 kV. 2.4 Electrochemical characterization of Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C and Pt\u2013Ru/C electrocatalysts The electrochemical measurements of cyclic voltammetry were conducted using a conventional three-compartment electrochemical cell at room temperature. A Pt flat and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. The working electrode was a glassy carbon disk with a diameter of 3 mm. The working electrode was polished with slurry of 0.5 \u03bcm and 0.03 \u03bcm alumina successively and washed ultrasonically in Millipore water (18 M\u03a9 cm \u22121 ) before use. The working electrode was prepared by pipetting catalyst ink on a mirror-finished glassy carbon electrode. First, 5 mg of the Pt\u2013Ru/C catalyst was dispersed ultrasonically in 1 mL of the alcohol solution with 50 \u03bcL of 5% Nafion solution. Then, 10 \u03bcL of the dispersion was pipetted and spread on a mirror-finished glassy carbon electrode with 3 mm diameter. Finally, the electrode was dried at room temperature for 30 min. The apparent surface area of the glassy carbon electrode was 0.07 cm 2 and the metal Pt catalyst loading was therefore 0.142 mg cm \u22122 . Electrochemical CO stripping voltammograms was measured by oxidation of pre-adsorbed CO (CO ad ) in the 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 solution at a scan rate of 10 mV s \u22121 . CO was purged into the 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 solution for 30 min to allow the complete adsorption of CO onto the catalyst when the working electrode was kept at 0 mV vs. Ag/AgCl electrode, and excess CO in the electrolyte was then purged out with N 2 for 50 min. The amount of CO ad was evaluated by integration of the CO ad stripping peak, corrected for the electric double-layer capacitance. The special surface area of Pt\u2013Ru metal was estimated assuming a monolayer of linearly adsorbed CO and the coulombic charge necessary for oxidation as 420 \u03bcC cm \u22122 [27,28] . The cyclic voltammograms of methanol were measured at the working electrode in the 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 solution with 0.5 M CH 3 OH. Oxygen was purged from the solution by bubbling with high purity argon for 15 min prior to each electrochemical measurement. The electrochemical experiments were performed using an EG&G Park potentiostat/galvanostat Model 273 A (Princeton Applied research). The scan rate is 10 mV s \u22121 . The potential range is \u22120.2 \u223c 0.6V (vs. Ag/AgCl). 2.5 The MEA preparation and single fuel cell test The membrane electrode assemble (MEA) was prepared as follows. The catalyst inks containing the appropriate weight percent of a Nafion solution (Aldrich) was spread on the surface of the carbon paper substrates (TGPH-090, E-Tek Co.) and formed the anode and cathode catalyst layers. Then, 160 \u03bcL of 5 wt% Nafion solution was spread on the catalyst layers and dried in the room temperature. The catalyst loadings based only on metal content were 1.5 mg cm \u22122 of supported Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C or Pt\u2013Ru/C catalysts at the anode and 2.0 mg cm \u22122 of 30 wt% Pt loadings on Vulcan XC-72 (E-TEK commercial catalyst) at the cathode. The MEA was fabricated by hot-pressing the anode and cathode catalyst layer onto the pretreated Nafion-117 membrane for 3 min at 50 atm and 120 \u00b0C. To fabricate the single DMFC, the MEA was placed between two graphite current collectors with a serpentine design for the fuel and air distribution. The single cell was consisting of two ribbed graphite plates, which were compressed between two gold plated end stainless steel plates. These we provided with liquid and gas-feed tubes to which were connected the electric wires for the current/voltage measurements. To measure the performance of the single DMFC with a 3 \u00d7 3 cm 2 active cross-sectional catalyst area, and a fuel cell testing system (Arbin Instruments) that recorded cell potentials under constant-current conditions. A 2.0 M methanol solution was preheated (30 \u00b0C) and supplied to the anode with a 5.0 mL min \u22121 flow rate and pure oxygen was fed to cathode with 100 mL min \u22121 flow rate at 2 atm were used. The fuel cell operating temperature was 30 \u00b0C. 3 Results and discussion A Schematic flow chart of the preparation of Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C electrocatalysts by the NaH 2 PO 2 method was illustrated in Fig. 1 a. The following four independent reactions may take place in the system during reduction of metal chlorides with NaH 2 PO 2 (see Fig. 1 b). As shown in Fig. 1 a, the initial pH value of the solution was about 9\u201310. After the solution was incubating for 10 min at 90 \u00b0C, the pH value of the solution dropped rapidly because of the reduction of PtCl 6 2 - and Ru 3+ which produced H + as shown in Eqs. (1) and (2) (see Fig. 1 b). When the pH value dropped to about 6\u20137, the reaction of Eq. (3) might slow down the decrease of pH value of the solution, and meanwhile large amounts of H 2 evolved due to the hydrolysis of H 2 PO 2 - as depicted by Eq. (4) catalyzed by the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P ultrafine alloy nanoparticles formed. Finally, the reaction ended in several hours after the pH value of the solution dropped to about 4, and the hypophosphite ions were reacted. This means that while the hypophosphite was used as reducing agent for the preparation of Pt/C or Pt\u2013Ru/C alloy catalysts, the non-metallic phosphorus with platinum and ruthenium deposited together on the surface of support. The bulk composition of the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst determined by EDX and ICP-AES was Pt 1.01 Ru 0.98 P 0.79 (19.36 wt% Pt, 9.82 wt% Ru, and 2.38 wt% P). These results indicate that P and Pt\u2013Ru coexisted. Fig. 2 a and b were the low- and high-magnification TEM images of the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P catalyst, respectively. The Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P particles uniformly dispersed on the carbon support was observed by TEM (see Fig. 1 a and b). The average size of the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P particles is 2 nm and the size distribution is as narrow as 2.0 \u00b1 0.5 nm, based on the measurements of 300 particles in random regions (see Fig. 2 c). The present observation demonstrates that the addition of phosphorus inhibits the aggregation of Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P, leading higher dispersion of the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. It\u2019s well known that the uniform distribution of the catalysts and a small particle size were key factors for the stable and efficient operation of a DMFCs [16\u201320,29\u201333] . Fig. 3 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst and the commercial Pt\u2013Ru/C catalyst. The first peak at 2 \u03b8 about 25\u00b0 was the XC-72 carbon support. In the XRD pattern of the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst, firstly, the diffraction peaks were much broader than that of the Pt\u2013Ru/C catalyst, indicating that the average size of the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P particles were much smaller than that of the Pt\u2013Ru particles. Secondly, the characteristic diffraction peaks Pt(200), Pt(220), and Pt(311) almost cannot be observed. The degree of preferential orientation of Pt crystal faces were expressed using texture coefficient (TC) [34] . The TC value of Pt(220) and Pt(311) crystal faces for Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C were lower than that of Pt\u2013Ru/C catalysts. It indicates that the relative crystallinity of the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C particles in the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst were much lower than that of Pt\u2013Ru/C particles in the Pt\u2013Ru/C catalyst, which may be attribute to the deposition of phosphorus. Similar XRD results once have been observed in the case of Ni\u2013P or Fe\u2013Ni\u2013P alloy [35,36] . Although Ru and P were clearly present in Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalysts, as seen from ICP-AES and EDX analysis, their diffraction peaks were not observed in XRD, perhaps indicative of dispersion at the atomic level. Indeed, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to analyze the surface composoition. Fig. 4 shows the Pt(4f), Ru(3p), and P(2p) spectra. The spectrum of Pt(4f) shows a doublet containing a low binding energy (4f 7/2 ) at 71.6 eV, and a high binding energy (4f 5/2 ) at 74.8 eV (as shown in Fig. 4 a), which was 3.2 eV higher than the low binding energy. These peaks were due to the existence of two different Pt oxidation states, namely Pt(0) and Pt(II) [37] . The lower binding energy peak at 71.6 eV shifted positively by 0.5 eV that for Pt metal at 71.1 eV comparing to the literature values [37] . This shows that there were strong interactions between the three components within the catalyst. The Ru(3p) spectrum was shown in Fig. 4 b. The Ru(3p) binding energy peak at 462.8 eV can be assigned as to Ru(0) metal, Ru(IV) and oxidation state of Ru(VI) [37,38] . Fig. 4 c shows the region for P(2p) in the spectrum of the XPS of the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P catalyst. The main peaks at the higher binding energy was assigned to oxidized phosphorus (133.1 eV) [22,39] . The small peak at the lower energy (129.3 eV) was assigned to phosphorus interacting with platinum and rutinum (metal phosphide) [22,39] . XPS analysis indicated that the P coexisted with Pt\u2013Ru particle and that most of P existed in oxidized state at surface of Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst. But there was little formation of metal phosphide and phosphorus. Fig. 5 shows the cyclic voltammograms of the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C and Pt\u2013Ru/C catalyst electrodes in the 0.5 M CH 3 OH + 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 solution at 10 mV s \u22121 and 25 \u00b0C using the Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. It can be observed from Fig. 5 that the onset potential, peak potential and peak current at the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst electrode were 180 mV, 516 mV, and 2.06 mA, respectively. The corresponding values at the Pt\u2013Ru/C catalyst electrode were 210 mV, 546 mV, and 1.26 mA, respectively. From the current measurements, it is clear that the catalytic activity of the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P catalysts was about 1.6 times larger than that of conventional commercial Pt\u2013Ru catalyst. It was apparent that the ternary phases of composition Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P exhibit enhanced performance of electro-oxidation methanol and the presence of phosphorus as an interstitial species does not appear to inhibit methanol electro-oxidation. Further more, we find that amorphous Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P nanocatalysts were more active than the corresponding crystallized Pt\u2013Ru nanocatalysts for the electro-oxidation of methanol. Fig. 6 shows cyclic voltammograms with (solid curve) and without (dashed curve) CO ad at Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C and Pt\u2013Ru/C electrocatalyst in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 . It shows that the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst exhibits better CO electro-oxidation activities than the commercial Pt\u2013Ru/C catalyst tested, the onset of CO oxidation was lower compared to that on Pt\u2013Ru/C catalyst. It was found that difference CV\u2019s (solid curve) in Fig. 6 , which is the transition from a single, well-defined stripping peak at Pt\u2013Ru/C catalyst to a broad, extended stripping peak at the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst. It suggests that the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst had higher number of active surface metal sites. In particular, the specific surface area measured for Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C (\u223c76.2 m 2 g \u22121 ) is significantly greater than the Pt\u2013Ru/C catalysts (\u223c57.8 m 2 g \u22121 ) by CO ad stripping methods [27,28] . Assuming a Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P particle with sphere model and no agglomeration, the theoretical surface area is estimated to be \u223c178.68 m 2 g \u22121 according to Ref. [40] . Because the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P electrocatalysts were supported on carbon, the exposed surface should be roughly half this value, \u223c89.34 m 2 g \u22121 , while the specific surface area with 76.20 m 2 g \u22121 ( S CO = 76.20 m 2 g \u22121 ) for Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst measured by CO ad stripping analysis. These results demonstrate the validity of characterization of the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P surface area using CO ad stripping analysis. The higher activity of Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalysts is attributed to the higher surface area and higher number of active surface metal sites. The results of this study further show that the incorporation of P as metalloid elements into the Pt and Ru may act to reduces the size of Pt\u2013Ru catalyst particle and increase the specific surface area. Fig. 7 shows Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C and Pt\u2013Ru/C catalysts of the CA curves obtained in 0.5 M methanol solution in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 at an anodic potential of 0.30 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst was able to maintain the higher current density for over 60 min between the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C and Pt\u2013Ru/C catalysts. The final current density for 60 min were 28.7 mA mg \u22121 metal and 11.3 mA mg \u22121 metal for Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C and Pt\u2013Ru/C catalyst, respectively. This result is consistent with the above CV results. Fig. 8 shows the polarization curves and power density curves of the single DMFC with the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C and the commercial E-TEK Pt\u2013Ru/C catalysts as the anodic catalyst at 30 \u00b0C. At 0.5 V, where the activation polarization regime was mainly affected by the activity of the catalyst, the current density of the single DMFC with the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst was 44.5 mA cm \u22122 , which was higher than that with the Pt\u2013Ru/C commercial E-TEK catalyst (5.6 mA cm \u22122 ). In addition, the maximum power density of direct methanol fuel cell using conventional commercial E-TEK PtRu catalyst was 36.6 mW cm \u22122 , while it was 61.5 mW cm \u22122 for DMFC with the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst. It means that the maximum power density of DMFC with the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst was about 1.7 times larger than that with the Pt\u2013Ru/C catalyst. The electrochemical results mentioned above clearly demonstrated that the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst for the methanol oxidation was much better than that of the Pt\u2013Ru/C catalyst. In conclusion, the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst can be prepared with a very simple and new method. Adding of P to the Pt\u2013Ru catalysts leads to reduce the size of PtRu catalyst particle and increase the specific surface area and active surface metal sites. The electrocatalytic activity of the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst for the methanol oxidation was better than that of the commercial E-TEK Pt\u2013Ru/C catalyst. It was demonstrated that the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P/C catalyst was a promising candidate as both the electrocatalytic activity and efficiency of catalyst were simultaneously improved. From combining the results of the electrochemical cell and the practical single DMFC, we conclude that Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P catalyst was an excellent electrocatalysts for the direct methanol fuel cell. The Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P electrocatalyst was hopeful to have a practical application in DMFC. Detailed studies on the origins of the excellent performance of the Pt\u2013Ru\u2013P catalysts will be reported in the future.

The electrocatalytic activity of the Pt-Ru/C catalyst for the methanol oxidation is much higher than that of the commercial E-TEK Pt-Ru/C catalyst with the similar average size and relative crystallinity, but low alloying. It is indicated that the alloying of Pt-Ru could significantly affect the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt-Ru/C catalyst for the methanol oxidation. The Pt-Ru/C catalyst with high alloying can be obtained because THF and H2PtCl6 can form the complex leading to that the reduction potentials of H2PtCl6 and RuCl3 are closed in the aqueous solution with THF.",

The UV-vis spectra indicated that the IL interacted with the Pd precursor to form a complex that plays an important role in the nucleation and growth process of Pd nanoparticles. The IL-mediated synthesis of the Pd/C catalyst (Pd/C-IL) was extensively characterised by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electrochemical CO ad stripping, linear scanning voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Physical characterisations revealed that the Pd/C-IL had an average size of 2.8 nm and a narrow size distribution. In addition, a very 'clean' surface was obtained for the Pd nanoparticles due to a weak interaction between the IL and the Pd nanoparticle surface resulting in the facile removal of the IL in the post-treatment process. More importantly, electrochemical studies demonstrated that, at an operating potential of 0.2 V, the catalytic activity of the Pd/C-IL was approximately 1.6 and 4.2-fold greater than the commercial Pd/C catalyst and the common Pd/C catalyst, respectively. \u00a9 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The results demonstrate that MP-11 was initially adsorbed via its polypeptide chain with a \u03b1-helix conformation, as indicated by the enhancement of the characteristic bands related to the amides I and III. The weak resonance effect of the porphyrin macrocycle in the near IR region contributes to the spectrum of the heme group. The presence of imidazole as the sixth ligand to the heme iron influences the conformation of the polypeptide chain of MP-11 on the electrode surface. Evaporation of solvent water results in an opened conformation of the adsorbed MP-11, which allows the heme group to contact the electrode surface directly.",

Two different composing PtRu/C nanocatalysts (catalyst 1, Pt 20 wt %, Ru 15 wt %; catalyst 2, Pt 20 wt %, Ru 10 wt %) were synthesized. The catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis, and the particles were found to be nanosized (2-4 nm) and inherit the Pt face-centered cubic structure with Pt and Ru mainly in the zero valance oxidation state. The ruthenium oxide and hydrous ruthenium oxide (RuO(x)()H(y)()) were also found in these catalysts. The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) and chronoamperometries for methanol oxidation on these catalysts showed that catalyst 1 with a higher Ru content (15 wt %) has a higher and more durable electrocatalytic activity to methanol oxidation than catalyst 2 with low Ru content (10 wt %). The CV results for catalysts 1 and 2 strongly support the bifunctional mechanism of PtRu/C catalysts for methanol oxidation. The data from direct methanol single cells using these two PtRu/C as anode catalysts show the cell with catalyst 1 has higher open circuit voltage (OCV = 0.75 V) and maximal power density (78 mW/cm(2)) than that with catalyst 2 (OCV = 0.70 V, P(max) = 56 mW/cm(2)) at 80 degrees C.",

        "title": "A novel hybrid based on carbon nanotubes and heteropolyanions as effective catalyst for hydrogen evolution",
        "abstract": "Heteropolyanions of tungstophosphoric acid (PWA) have been successfully hybridized with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by a severe mechanical milling. The obtained hybrid is electroactive for hydrogen evolution (HE) at potentials as positive as \u22120.16 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.2 M HClO 4 aqueous solution and its electrocatalysis is up to the level of Pt/CNTs (20 wt% Pt) for HE, indicating a vigorous alternative to Pt group metals. The HE mechanism of the hybrid was also studied and it was found that the tungsten oxycarbides are the electroactive components for HE. Keywords PWA Hydrogen evolution Pt Carbon nanotubes Fuel cells 1 Introduction The interest in electrochemical hydrogen evolution (HE) catalysts is currently increasing due to that molecular hydrogen is being considered as an energy carrier [1] . Unlike hydrocarbon fuels used today, hydrogen produces only water during oxidation, for instance in fuel cells. For hydrogen to be a real alternative to hydrocarbons, it must be produced in large scaled fashions. One possibility is electrochemical evolution with electric current to split water, which requires an efficient electrocatalyst. This requires that the HE process preferably bases on materials that are cheap and abundant. Currently the HE processes are catalyzed most effectively with expensive noble metals (such as Pt) that are not only high in cost but also limited in resources [2] . Therefore it is urgent to find alternatives to the noble metals, such as Pt, for HE [3\u20135] . In recent years, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and heteropolyanions (HPA) have attracted more and more attention from various chemical fields [6\u201327] . The particularities of high surface area, hollow geometry, high electronic conductivity and special mechanical properties exhibit that CNTs can greatly promote electron transfer reactions [6\u20138] . HPA based on oxometallate compounds have been used for several years. For example, for some metallic electrodes [16\u201321] and semiconducting electrodes [22\u201327] , the overvoltage of HE can be significantly and persistently reduced by a treatment with HPA. In the present work an effective electrocatalyst for HE was prepared based on CNTs and PWA (Keggin-type, PW 12 ) by a severe mechanical milling. It was found that the tungsten carbides or tungsten oxycarbides are the electroactive components for HE. 2 Experimental Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were purchased from Shenzhen Nanotech. Port. Co. Ltd. (Shenzhen, China). 12-Tungstophosphic acids (PWA, Keggin-type: PW 12 ), sulfuric acid, perchloric acid (HClO 4 ) and ammonium tungstate ((NH 4 ) 2 WO 4 ) were from Beijing Xinhua Chemical Co., China. The CNTs/PWA hybrid was prepared based on the following process: firstly the commercial CNTs were refluxed in 2.6 M nitric acid for 16 h and then the mixture was washed with deionized water several times to remove residual acid and then the pretreated CNTs were obtained, secondly both pretreated CNTs (100 mg) and different PWA (50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg, respectively) were weighed into a stainless steel capsule containing a milling ball (Specks Co., 3500 cycles per min). Then the capsule was vigorously shaken for 4 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then washed with water and ethanol to get neutral state, finally dried under vacuum at 60 \u00b0C overnight to obtain the CNTs/PWA hybrid. The CNTs/PWA mixture was prepared by dipping the GC/CNTs electrode into saturated PWA aqueous solution for 30 min to adsorb intact PWA molecules and then rinsed with pure water for three times before testing. Pt/CNTs (20 wt% Pt) catalyst was prepared as the following: the acid-treated CNTs were sonicated in a bit of concentrated sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate solution for 10 h, then the H 2 PtCl 6 solution (3.08 mg Pt/mL) was added with stirring for 24 h and strong alkali NaOH was added to adjust the pH value to 9. Two hours later the reducing reagent of NaBH 4 water solution (0.2 g/mL) was dropped to reduce the metallic precursors in 3 h. Then the mixture was filtrated and washed with ethanol and water repeatedly to remove impurities. The XC-72 carbon black (CB)/PWA and XC-72 CB/tungstic acid hybrids were prepared with the same mechanical milling procedure as shown above. The heat-treated CNTs/(NH 4 ) 2 WO 4 hybrid was prepared as following: 100 mg CNTs and 200 mg (NH 4 ) 2 WO 4 were weighed into a beaker containing 100 mL water. After being sonicated for 30 min the obtained mixture was dried under air. Then the dried mixture was calcined under Ar atmosphere at 500 \u00b0C for 5 h. XPS analyzes were recorded by a Phi Quantum 2000 XPS system (Physical Electronics Inc.). The samples were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy (Bio-Rad FTS) with KBr pellets. An EG&G model 273 potentiostat/galvanostat and a conventional three-electrode test cell were used for electrochemical measurements. The working electrode was a thin layer of Nafion impregnated catalyst cast on a glassy carbon disk electrode (\u22055 mm, Tokai carbon from Japan) held in a Teflon cylinder. The solid loading in catalyst layer was 0.15 mg/cm 2 . The electrode was then dried at 60 \u00b0C for 1 h. A Pt foil electrode and an Ag/AgCl (KCl saturated) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All electrolyte solutions were deaerated by high purity argon for 15 min prior to any measurement. 3 Results and discussion The electrocatalytic properties of CNTs/PWA hybrids for HE were studied as shown in Fig. 1 . Compared with glassy carbon (GC) electrode ( Fig. 1 A(a)), the HE current for GC/CNTs electrode commenced slowly at the onset potential of \u22120.4 V as shown in Fig. 1 A(b). This indicates CNTs as electrode material could promote electron transfer in reaction, [6\u20138] but the electrocatalysis for HE is very weak. While after typically hybridized with PWA (200 mg), an obvious HE current appeared at a more positive onset potential of \u22120.16 V as shown in Fig. 1 A(c), which is even higher than that (\u22120.2 V) of Pt/CNTs (20 wt% Pt) catalyst ( Fig. 1 A(d)) for HE. The onset potential of \u22120.16 V is also higher than that of \u22120.4 V for HE reported by Dong et al. obtained from metalloporphyrin-heteropolyanion hybrid film [9] and slightly higher than that of \u22120.20 V for HE on \u03b1 2 -P 2 W 17 MoO 62 K 6 -modified GC electrode [17] . The higher onset potential for HE probably could be attributed to the utilization of CNTs, which can greatly promote the electron transfer in HE process [6\u20138] . Further tests of HE rates under potentiostatic conditions were conducted at \u22120.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl to avoid complications from the adsorption effects [4] ( Fig. 1 B). Although the initial current on CNTs/PWA hybrid ( Fig. 1 B(a)) is lower than that on Pt/CNTs ( Fig. 1 B(b)), after the shorter decline time the steady current is slightly higher than that on Pt/CNTs. These results indicated that these CNTs/PWA hybrids could be a vigorous alternative to Pt group metals for HE. It was further found that the electroactivity for HE of these hybrids increased with the increase of the initial PWA/CNTs weight ratio and then when the weight of PWA is higher than 200 mg, the electroactivity is almost constant. The reason obviously is due to the saturation of PWA immobilized on CNTs at higher PWA/CNTs weight ratio. So in the following the CNTs/PWA hybrid with optimal composition (initial weight ratio of CNTs/PWA = 100 mg/200 mg) was used to perform the following all experiments. Fig. 2 shows the IR spectra of pure PWA and CNTs/PWA hybrid. Three of the characteristic peaks (at 891 cm \u22121 (W\u2013O b \u2013W), 982 cm \u22121 (W O d ) and 1080 cm \u22121 (P\u2013O a )) in CNTs/PWA hybrid show a blue shift while the fourth characteristic peak near 798 cm \u22121 (W\u2013O c \u2013W) shifts a little in red compared with intact PWA. A new peak also appears near 1028 cm \u22121 after hybridized with CNTs, which obviously should be attributed to the special interaction between CNTs and PWA. The relative contents of the characteristic covalent bonds were also obtained approximately from peak areas. It was found that the contents of W\u2013O b \u2013W, W O d and P\u2013O a decreased from 10.3%, 22.5% and 17.2% in the intact PWA to 10.2%, 14.1% and 6.7% after hybridized with CNTs, respectively, indicating the interruption of covalent bonds of W\u2013O b \u2013W, W O d and P\u2013O a in the rigid structure. The energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) shows the atomic ratio of W/P is 12 for intact Keggin PWA while the ratio of W/P for CNTs/PWA hybrid is about 9, further confirming some covalent bonds in the rigid P\u2013O a \u2013W primary structure of heteropolyanions had been interrupted. The XPS spectra ( Figs. 3 A and C) of C 1s in pure CNTs and CNTs in CNTs/PWA hybrid showed great difference. The large peak located at 290 eV ( Fig. 3 C) indicated a great deal of C\u2013W covalent bonds had been formed in the hybrid after the severe mechanical milling [28,29] . Figs. 3 B and D show the XPS spectra of the W 4f region in pure PWA and CNTs/PWA samples. The spectra were fitted with two different doublets of W 4f with 4f 7/2 located at 35.3 and 40.0 eV representing the tungsten oxides (+6) and superoxides (>+6), respectively [12,13] . As for the intact PWA almost all the valences of tungsten are equal to +6 ( Fig. 3 B) while after hybridized with CNTs by severe mechanical milling, the percentage of tungsten superoxides increased greatly. Combining the above IR spectra it could be deduced that some of the WO 6 octahedral units had been broken off from the central of PO 4 and some covalent bonds between P and O in the W\u2013O a \u2013P rigid structure had been interrupted and then produced some fragments of tungsten superoxides. Combining the XPS spectra of C 1s, it could be further deduced that the tungsten oxycarbides had been formed from the destruction of PWA. Figs. 4 A and C show the XPS spectra of P 2p in intact PWA and CNTs/PWA hybrid, respectively. The slight enhanced signal of P 2p at 134.2 eV on hybrid indicates a slight enrichment of surface with phosphorus as a result of the interruption of P\u2013O a in the rigid structure of PW 12 [12] . Figs. 4 C and D show the XPS spectra of O 1s in pure PWA and CNTs/PWA hybrid, respectively. The spectrum of intact PWA shows two strong peaks at 531.2 eV (labeled A, assigned to W\u2013O\u2013W) and 532.6 eV (labeled B, assigned to W\u2013O a \u2013P) [12,13] . After hybridized with CNTs, peak B decreased greatly, further confirming the interruption of P\u2013O a . The new peaks of C and D should be attributed to oxo-groups on CNTs or water species on the sample surface [14,15] . Based on the above results, it could be concluded firmly that the intact structure of PW 12 had been wrecked and the tungsten oxycarbides had been formed on carbon after the severe mechanical milling. Just as that shown on the above, the conditions in the mechanical milling were so severe that the intact heteropolyoxotungstates were destroyed and transformed into completely different tungsten carbides or oxycarbides. As shown in Fig. 1 A(e), the intact PWA physically adsorbed on CNTs shows no catalysis for HE. This fact implies the tungsten carbides or oxycarbides rather than the intact units are the effective components for HE. In order to further validate the above conclusion, a new hybrid was prepared by hybridization of CNTs with (NH 4 ) 2 WO 4 solution followed by calcinations at 500 \u00b0C under Ar atmosphere for 5 h. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the intact tungstate shows a very weak catalysis for HE on CNTs (curve a), while after hybridized with CNTs at high temperature, a relatively large HE current appears (curve c). While the pure tungsten oxide (WO 3 ) simply supported by CNTs, as shown in curve b, only shows a very small HE current. The XPS spectra show the W\u2013C covalent bonds were also formed in the heat-treated CNTs/(NH 4 ) 2 WO 4 hybrid but do not appear in the simple mixtures of CNTs/PWA, CNTs/(NH 4 ) 2 WO 4 or CNTs/tungsten oxide. Similar conclusions were also obtained on the other two kinds hybrids of XC-72 CB/PWA and XC-72 CB/tungstic acid prepared with the same severe mechanical milling ( Figs. 5 B and C). All these facts further validate the tungsten oxycarbides are the electroactive components for HE. In fact Etcheberry et al. [27] had reported that tungsten oxide rather than the intact Keggin structure ( SiW 12 O 40 4 - ) was the effective component for HE. Fig. 5 D shows the comparison among the heat-treated CNTs/(NH 4 ) 2 WO 4 (curve a), XC-72 CB/PWA (after severe mechanical milling, curve b) and CNTs/PWA (after severe mechanical milling, curve c) hybrids. The inset shows a comparison between intact PWA and the CNT/PWA hybrid. Compared with the intact PWA a similarity among these hybrids could be found: the large HE currents covered all the \u2217 1 peaks. Based on this fact, the HE mechanism for the above hybrids could be described as following with the immobilized tungsten oxycarbides denoted as C \u2013 WO x n - (3 \u2a7d x < 6) [9,16\u201327,11] : (1) C \u2013 WO x n - + e \u21d4 C \u2013 WO x ( n + 1 ) - (2) C \u2013 WO x ( n + 1 ) - + e \u21d4 C \u2013 WO x ( n + 2 ) - (3) 2 H + + 2 C \u2013 WO x ( n + 2 ) - \u2192 C \u2013 WO x ( n + 1 ) - + H 2 On the other hand as shown in Fig. 5 D, with the same W loadings the CNTs/PWA hybrid (curve c) shows the highest catalysis for HE and the heat-treated CNTs/(NH 4 ) 2 WO 4 hybrid (curve a) only shows a relatively weak catalysis for HE. This difference probably could be attributed to the different effective amounts of tungsten oxycarbides immobilized on carbon. Their C 1s XPS spectra show there is a higher C\u2013W content in the CNTs/PWA hybrid. 4 Conclusions In summary the CNTs/PWA hybrid was prepared as a vigorous electrocatalysts for HE, which is much cheaper and more abundant than noble metal catalysts. Its activity and stability are all up to the level of Pt/CNTs (20 wt% Pt) catalysts. Spectra and electrochemical results show that the tungstate oxycarbides formed on carbon materials by W\u2013C covalent bonds are the main electroactive components for HE.

        "abstract": "H2-mesoporphyrin IX and Zn-mesoporphyrin IX have been investigated as sensitizers for the titanium dioxide (TiO2) film electrode to construct a new two-compartment photoelectrochemical biofuel cell (PEBFC). The PEBFC can convert the light and chemical energy to electricity by consuming photons and oxidizing glucose. The two sensitizers are similar with two carboxyl anchoring groups, except that the central hydrogen atoms in the H2-mesoporphyrin IX are replaced by zinc. To determine how cell performance is affected by the sensitizer, we analyze the photochemical and photoelectrochemical properties of the two sensitizers by physical characterization and photoelectrochemical experiments. The UVeVis absorption spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) indicate that the interactions between the sensitizer and TiO2 decrease in the order of H2-mesoporphyrin IX Zn-mesoporphyrin IX The interactions are also determined by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra which indicate that the two sensitizers are adsorbed on the TiO2 film through the carboxyl groups. The photovoltaic characteristics show the Zn-mesoporphyrin IX is less effective in comparison with the H2-mesoporphyrin IX, since the Zn-mesoporphyrin IX enhances the back electron-transfer process, producing lower IPCE and current. These results reveal that the H2-mesoporphyrin IX is a more efficient sensitizer compared with the Zn-mesoporphyrin IX for the PEBFC. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Composite membranes based on Sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) and sulfonated organically modified Si-SBA-15 (S-SBA-15) were investigated with the purpose of increasing the proton conductivity. The novelty of the composite membranes was attributed to two special structures and different ion exchange capacities (IEC) of S-SBA-15 fillers, which were embedded in membranes. The typical hexagonal channels array of S-SBA-15 was confirmed by XRD and TEM. The regular vermiculate and amorphous structures of the inorganic fillers were proved by SEM. Composite membranes were prepared through common solvent casting method. SEM images indicated that the inorganic filler with regular structure dispersed homogeneously in the composite membranes, but the amorphous filler caused an agglomeration phenomenon at the same loading content. The composite membranes exhibited good thermal stability, enhanced water uptake and proton conductivity. The proton conductivity of the composite membranes with low IEC filler was higher than the composite membranes with high IEC filler at the same loading content. The highest proton conductivity value of 0.156 S cm \u22121 was obtained for the composite membrane containing 5 wt.% S-SBA-15 with the IEC of 1.41 mequiv g \u22121 at 80 \u00b0C. This composite membrane also showed other promising properties such as good thermal and mechanical stability which exceeded the other composite membranes with different loading contents. Keywords SPEEK S-SBA-15 Proton conductivity 1 Introduction Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have attracted much attention as clean energy sources because of their high power density and efficiency with low emission levels for various applications such as electric vehicles, portable electronics, and residential power generation [1\u20133] . The core of these fuel cell devices is a polyelectrolyte thin film that facilitates the transport of proton at predetermined operating conditions and should block the fuel diffusion in cells [4,5] . At present, Nafion membrane is widely used due to its excellent chemical, mechanical stability, as well as its relatively high proton conductivity. However, it also has drawbacks including expensive price, high methanol diffusion and poor proton conductivity at elevated temperature [6,7] . Some PEMs based on hydrocarbon aromatic polymer such as Sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone)s, Sulfonated polyimides [8,9] are prepared as alternatives to Nafion. However, their poor proton conductivity in low-humidity environment restricts the application in PEMFCs. Significant efforts have been made to modify PEMs. Inorganic\u2013organic composite membrane is one of the effective approaches which has been mainly investigated as an alternative to enhance water retention at high temperature, decrease methanol crossover. Silica, zirconia and titania are main inorganic additives in PEMs modification. Watanabe et\u00a0al. [10] first presented their work on the use of hygroscopic oxides for perfluorosulfonic acid membranes. Tang et\u00a0al. [11] proposed self-assembled Nafion\u2013silica nanoparticles for elevated-high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. Chen et\u00a0al. [12] described Nafion/Zeolite nanocomposite membranes by in situ crystallization for a direct methanol fuel cell. The incorporation of nonconductive inorganic compounds into the membrane normally results in a decrease of proton conductivity. To overcome this problem, some groups modified SPEEK membrane with functionalized silica [13,14] . There are also several reports on sulfonic acid functionalized silica/Nafion composite membranes [15,16] . Pereira et\u00a0al. [17] reported advanced mesostructured hybrid silica\u2013Nafion membranes for high-performance PEM fuel cell. Acid functionalized mesoporous silicas are advantage oxide additives because of their high acid strength and adjustable acid group density allowing the fast proton transport through pore channel. Margolese et al. [18] first reported the direct synthesis sulfonic acid functionalized ordered SBA-15 mesoporous silica. This silica has well hexagonal mesoscopic ordered structure and high content of sulfonic acid, but the author did not study its proton conductivity property. Another paper [19] reported the compare of conductivity about sulfonic acid functionalized ordered mesoporous silica SBA-15, SBA-16 and MCM-41. The research found that sulfonic acid functionalized ordered SBA-15 mesoporous silica had higher proton conductivity. There are many hybrid membranes based on mesoporous silica such as Si-MCM-41 [20,21] , but so far no reports about SPEEK composite membranes with sulfonic acid functionalized ordered mesoporous silica SBA-15 as inorganic filler. Herein, we do some research about it firstly. We choose two kinds of sulfonated SBA-15 mesoporous silicas with discrepant properties as additives to modify SPEEK and study the different properties of the composite membranes. 2 Experiment 2.1 Materials SPEEK with ion exchange capacity (IEC) of 2.3 mequiv g \u22121 was synthesized according to our previous report [5] . Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) (Beijing chemical company), 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) (Nanjing lipai chemical company), H 2 O 2 (Beijing chemical company), Pluronic123 was purchased from Aldrich. 2.2 Synthesis of S-SBA-15 mesoporous silica The synthesis of sulfonated SBA-15 mesoporous silica (S-SBA-15) followed a similar process to that reported by G. D. Stucky's [18] . Typically, 2 g of Pluronic123 was dissolved with stirring in 60 g of 1.9 mol L \u22121 HCl at room temperature, then the solution was heated to 40 \u00b0C and predetermining TEOS was added to prehydrolysis several hours before the addition of the thiol precursor MPTMS and the aqueous solution H 2 O 2 (30%). The molar composition of each mixture for 2 g of copolymer was X TEOS: (0.041 \u2013 X )MPTMS: Z H 2 O 2 : 0.24HCl: 6.67H 2 O, where X = 0.0369 and 0.0328, Z = 0.0123. The resultant solution was stirred for another 20 h at 40 \u00b0C, after which the mixture was aged at 100 \u00b0C for 24 h under static condition. The solid product was recovered by filtration and air-dried at room-temperature overnight. The template was removed from the as-synthesized material by washing with ethanol under reflux for 24 h. 2.3 Preparation of composite membranes The preparation of the SPEEK/S-SBA-15 composite membranes was as follows by solution casting method: first, SPEEK was dissolved in NMP to form a 10% solution. Then, a predetermined amount of S-SBA-15 was added in the polymer solution and ultrasonic about 20 min to make a homogeneous suspension. After that, casting the solution on a clean glass plate, followed by overnight drying at 60 \u00b0C for the solvent evaporation. The membranes were peeled off from the glass plate by immersing the plate into the deionized water. Finally, the membranes were immersed into a 1.0 mol L \u22121 HCl solution for 48 h to obtain the membranes with acid form. 2.4 Characterization 2.4.1 FT-IR FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Impact 410 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer using KBr disc. 2.4.2 XRD The XRD pattern of S-SBA-15 was collected on a RIGAKU X-ray diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation. 2.4.3 SEM and TEM The particle morphology and the cross-section of membranes were determined by SEM with a SHIMADZU SSX-550 microscope. Transmission electron microcopy (TEM) microphotographs were carried out on an H-8100IV electron microscope operating at 200 kV. 2.4.4 Ion-exchange capacity (IEC) The IEC of SPEEK membranes and S-SBA-15 fillers were determined by two methods. Method1. Classical titration: using 2 mol L \u22121 NaCl aqueous solutions (aq) as exchange agents, the amount of H + released from the samples was determined by titrating with 0.01 mol L \u22121 NaOH (aq) using phenolphthalein as an indicator (equation (1) ). Method2. Back titration: the samples were converted to Na + ionic form by immersing the samples into 0.01 mol L \u22121 NaOH (aq) for 12 h, then back titrated the solution with 0.01 mol L \u22121 HCl solution using phenolphthalein as an indicator (equation (2) ). For each sample, at least three measurements were carried out until it had reached to a constant value. (1) IEC= V NaOH \u00d7 C NaOH weight\u00a0of\u00a0dried\u00a0membrane ( mequiv g \u2212 1 ) where V NaOH is the volume of NaOH solution, C NaOH is the molarity of NaOH solution, respectively. (2) IEC= V NaOH \u00d7 C NaOH \u2212 V HCI \u00d7 C HCI weight\u00a0of\u00a0dried\u00a0membrane ( mequiv g \u2212 1 ) where V NaOH and V HCl are the volume of NaOH and HCl solutions, C NaOH and C HCl are the molarity of NaOH and HCl solutions, respectively. 2.4.5 Thermal property Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on a Perkin ElemerPyris 1 thermal analyzer system was employed to assess thermal stability of the membranes. Before testing, all the membranes were preheated at 120 \u00b0C for 10 min to remove any residual moisture and solvent, then the samples were cooled to 100 \u00b0C and reheated to 700 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 in N 2 flow. 2.4.6 Mechanical property The mechanical properties of the dry composite membranes were measured by SHIMADZU AG-I 1KN equipment at the strain speed of 2 mm min \u22121 . The samples were treated as 15 \u00d7 4 mm 2 before test and for each result, three samples were measured and the average value was calculated. 2.4.7 Water uptake and swelling ratio After drying at 80 \u00b0C for 6 h, the size and weight of the membranes were measured. Then the samples were equilibrated into deionized water at the desired temperature for a certain time. After taking out and removing the residual water on the surface, the membranes were measured as soon as possible. This procedure was repeated at least three times to obtain a satisfactory data reproducibility. The swelling ratio and water uptake were calculated by the changes in size and weight between dry and fully hydrated samples as follows: (3) Water\u00a0uptake ( % ) = W wet \u2212 W dry W dry \u00d7 100 % (4) Swelling\u00a0ratio ( % ) = L wet \u2212 L dry L dry \u00d7 100 % where W wet and W dry are the mass of wet and dry membranes, L wet and L dry are the length of wet and dry membranes. 2.4.8 Proton conductivity ( \u03c3 ) The measurement of proton conductivity was carried out via the four-electrode AC impedance spectroscopy using a Princeton Applied Research Model 273A potentiostat with a Model 5210 Frequency Response Detector (EG&G PARC, Princeton, NJ) from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. During the measurement, the membranes which were pretreated in distilled deionized water for at least 24 h before test were immersed in the deionized water to assure the 100% relative humidity. The proton conductivity was calculated in the following equation: (5) \u03c3 = L R \u00d7 A where L is the distance between the two electrodes, R is the membrane resistance and A is the cross-sectional area of membrane. 3 Result and discussion 3.1 Characterization of S-SBA-15 The properties of the two S-SBA-15 silicas we prepared were listed in Table 1 . The evidence for the presence of alkylsulfonic acid groups in S-SBA-15 was confirmed by FT-IR spectra in Fig.\u00a01 a . It can be seen that the vibration at 2921 cm \u22121 is corresponded to C\u2013H stretch vibration; the weak absorbances at 1470 cm \u22121 , 1420 cm \u22121 are assigned to bending vibrations of methylene groups; 1000\u20131250 cm \u22121 , 790 cm \u22121 , 470 cm \u22121 are assigned to typical Si\u2013O\u2013Si groups stretch vibrations [18, 22] . The weak band at 1350 cm \u22121 is assigned to the asymmetric stretching band of the SO 2 moieties, the band at 650 cm \u22121 relates to the C\u2013S stretching vibrations [23] . The peaks corresponding to the S O stretching vibrations of sulfonic acid at 1000\u20131200 cm \u22121 cannot be resolved due to their overlap with the Si\u2013O\u2013Si stretch vibrations [22] . Fig.\u00a01 b showed the X-ray diffraction patterns of samples. For sample 1.4S-SBA-15, an XRD pattern typical of hexagonal SBA-15 was obtained and a regular morphology was confirmed by SEM in Fig.\u00a01 c, however, for the sample 2.7S-SBA-15, an intensity decrease of (100) peak was observed although the peaks of (110) and (200) existed, which indicated that the addition of more MPTMS in the initial mixture will decrease the mesoscopic order [18] and the SEM in Fig.\u00a01 d proved that an amorphous material was obtained. TEM images in Fig.\u00a02 showed the typical hexagonal channels array of 1.4S-SBA-15, which was supported by the result of XRD. The IEC of S-SBA-15, as measured by the classical titration method and back titration method, were shown in Table 1 . The density of sulfonic groups measured via classical titration was lower than the one determined by back titration. This is probably because the strong hydrogen bond interaction between \u2013OH and \u2013SO 3 H in the S-SBA-15 lead to incomplete exchange of H + by NaCl in classical titration method. 3.2 Preparation of the composite membranes The chemical structures of SPEEK and S-SBA-15 were shown in Fig.\u00a03 and the description of SPEEK/S-SBA-15 composite membranes with various S-SBA-15 contents was listed in Table 2 . The dispersion of S-SBA-15 within the composite membranes with the help of effective ultrasonic was examined with SEM. As shown in Fig.\u00a04 a and Fig.\u00a04 b, when the loading contents of filler below 5 wt.%, no obvious silica agglomeration occurred on the membrane cross-sections, the filler well dispersed in the membranes. The explanation of this phenomenon may be due to the interaction of sulfonic acid groups between the 1.4S-SBA-15 and SPEEK. The formation of hydrogen bond restricted particles motion in the membranes during the solvent volatilization process [24] . Moreover, from Fig.\u00a03 b, it is easy to find that the alkylsulfonic acid groups in 1.4S-SBA-15 are flexible chain which can sway rather freely in the solution and make for the formation of \u2013SO 3 H/\u2013SO 3 H interaction and the distribution of the 1.4S-SBA-15 silica in the polymer solution. As shown in Fig.\u00a04 c, with the increase of the particle content, some silica agglomeration was observed because the more particle cannot disperse completely at the stated solvent. As sample SPEEK/5-2.7S-SBA-15 in Fig.\u00a04 d, the obvious agglomeration phenomenon was due to the amorphous structure of the particles with disordered size and indistinct morphology. The microstructure of the composite membranes was so important that well dispersed state of the\u00a0fillers will be beneficial to various important properties of the membranes such as the mechanical, thermal properties and proton conductivity. 3.3 Thermal stability and mechanical property The thermal stability of S-SBA-15 was analyzed by TGA as shown in Fig.\u00a05 . The thermogram of S-SBA-15 exhibited only one distinct decomposition region at about 450 \u00b0C which was mainly attributed to the thermal decomposition of sulfonic groups in the mesoporous silica. From 100 \u00b0C to 300 \u00b0C, there was a weight loss which was induced by the evaporation of the water absorbed by silica [25, 26] . The thermal stability of all the membranes was shown in Fig.\u00a06 . Two distinct degradation steps were observed: the first weight loss at 250 \u00b0C was due to the decomposition of sulfonic groups of the polymer [4, 5] and the second step above 450 \u00b0C represented the decomposition of the polymer SPEEK main chain and alkylsulfonic acid groups in S-SBA-15. The thermal stability of the composite membranes was a little lower than the neat SPEEK except the SPEEK/5-1.4S-SBA-15. The composite membrane SPEEK/5-1.4S-SBA-15 showed the same good thermal stability with SPEEK at the first step and exhibited the enhancement of the thermal stability at the second step which may be caused by the strong interaction between 1.4S-SBA-15 and SPEEK at this ratio. The result of TGA indicated that the introduction of the inorganic particle into the membranes cannot affect the thermal performance obviously and it can be applied to the fuel cell. It is well known that the mechanical properties of composite membranes are strongly affected by interfacial structure and property between fillers and matrixes [27] . Tensile test was carried out on the hybrid membranes and the neat membrane in order to evaluate the influence of S-SBA-15 fillers on the mechanical properties of the membrane. As shown in Table 3 , the tensile strength of the SPEEK membrane was about 57.1 Mpa, whilst the composite membranes showed a slightly decrease from 53.9 to 45.8 Mpa with the increase of the loading content. This phenomenon was different from the previous report [28] which was probably due to the larger particle size resulting in an increase of pores in the membrane. However, the elongation at break of the composites increased from 18.4% to 27.6% and then markedly decreased to 14%. This may attribute to the well disperse of the particle in the membranes. When the loading content increased, the agglomeration of the particle would break the structure integrity and the elongation at break decreased obviously. By contrast, the weak mechanical property of the composite SPEEK/5-2.7S-SBA-15 was induced by the inferior membrane microstructure which was caused by the agglomeration of the particle with amorphous structure. 3.4 Water uptake and swelling ratio The content of water in hybrid membrane plays a remarkable role in the proton conductivity. The water uptake of the neat SPEEK and composite membranes were shown in Fig.\u00a07 , the composite membranes exhibited anticipative higher water uptake than SPEEK at different temperature due to the introduction of S-SBA-15 additive which was hydrophilic in nature into the SPEEK membranes [14] . Compared with neat SPEEK, the water uptake of the composite membranes increased from 70.4% to 79.2% at 25 \u00b0C and increased from 90.7% to 107.1% at 80 \u00b0C. Among these composites which was noticeable was that the SPEEK/5-1.4S-SBA-15 showed the highest water uptake than others. There is an anomalous rule that is increasing the loading of 1.4S-SBA-15 from 5% to 10% reduced the water uptake instead. The reason for this phenomenon is that with the increase of fillers content in the membranes, the stronger interaction between 1.4S-SBA-15 and SPEEK will result in an ionic cross-link structure so as to restrain the water absorption [24] . The water uptake in composite membrane SPEEK/5-1.4S-SBA-15 was higher than SPEEK/5-2.7S-SBA-15. The different characters of the S-SBA-15 particles were responsible for this result. During the preparation process of particles, the more \u2013SO 3 H introducing into silica will break Si\u2013O\u2013Si network which was described ahead and make against the water absorption although owning two double \u2013SO 3 H content [29] . As shown in Fig.\u00a08 , the trend of the swelling ratio was the same as the water uptake, however, the increase extent was much smaller than the water uptake. This indicated that introducing inorganic additives would enhance the water uptake whilst restrain the change of the dimension, which was propitious to the size stability of the composite membranes. 3.5 Proton conductivity To examine the effect of incorporating the S-SBA-15 into the SPEEK membranes on the proton conductivity at elevated temperature, the conductivity of the neat SPEEK and composite membranes were measured and listed. All the composite membranes in Fig.\u00a09 exhibited generally higher proton conductivity than the neat SPEEK with the increase of the temperature. This can be explained by the better ability of water absorption and microstructure of the composite membranes than SPEEK. As shown in Fig.\u00a09 a, the proton conductivity of the composite membranes increased from 0.128 S cm \u22121 to 0.156 S cm \u22121 as the 1.4S-SBA-15 filler content increased from 0 wt.% to 5 wt.% at 80 \u00b0C, mainly because the well-separated 1.4S-SBA-15 with hexagonal 1D pore channel in favor for proton conductivity [19] in the membranes forming advantage structure supports for proton conduction. Another feature is that the proton conductivity decreased when the filler content increased from 5% to 10%, which may be due to the agglomeration of excessive particles resulting in phase-separated microstructure when the particles content increased [15] . What is worthy of note is that in Fig.\u00a09 b the proton conductivity of the membrane SPEEK/5-1.4S-SBA-15 was higher than the membrane SPEEK/5-2.7S-SBA-15. The structure and the pore channels are probably the reasons. As mentioned above, the 1.4S-SBA-15 owned regular structure and typical hexagonal 1D pore channel which benefited the transport of proton and the 2.7S-SBA-15 is an amorphous material although its IEC is higher [19] . Compared to the relatively high IEC, the regular structure is a much more important factor here, which can make for the dispersion of the particle and the transport of the proton. The proton conductivity of the membrane not only depends on the high IEC but also the microstructure in the membrane [30, 31] . 4 Conclusion SPEEK composite membranes with S-SBA-15 as inorganic filler have been investigated here for the first time. The structure of the S-SBA-15 filler was an important factor for the properties of the composite membranes. The incorporation of S-SBA-15 mesoporous silica enhanced the water uptake, greatly improved the proton conductivity and exhibited excellent mechanical property. The proton conductivity showed firstly increase and decrease afterward with the increase of the filler amount. The highest proton conductivity value of 0.156 S cm \u22121 was obtained for the composite membrane SPEEK/5-1.4S-SBA-15 at 80 \u00b0C, which increased 21.9% in comparison with the neat SPEEK. Due to the properties of fillers themselves, the composite membrane SPEEK/5-1.4S-SBA-15 exhibited better proton conductivity than SPEEK/5-2.7S-SBA-15.

        "abstract": "A stable electroactive thin film of cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) was electrochemically deposited on the surface of a glassy carbon (GC) electrode with a new and simple method. The cyclic voltammograms of the CoHCF film modified GC (CoHCF/GC) electrode prepared by this method exhibit two pairs of well-defined redox peaks, at scan rates up to 200 mV s \u22121 . The advantage of this method is that it is easy to manipulate and to control the surface coverage of CoHCF on the electrode surface. The modified electrode shows good electrocatalytic activity towards the electrochemical reaction of dopamine (DA) in a 0.1 mol dm \u22123 KNO 3 +phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0). The rate constant of the electrocatalytic oxidation of DA at the CoHCF/GC electrode is determined by employing rotating disk electrode measurements.",

Cyanogel, a jelly-like inorganic polymer, can be used to synthesize various three-dimensionally (3D) porous alloy nanomaterials owing to its double-metal property and particular 3D backbone. Here, 3D porous PdNi@Pt core-shell nanostructures (CSNSs) are facilely synthesized by first preparing the Pd-Ni alloy networks (Pd-Ni ANWs) core via cyanogel-reduction method followed by a galvanic displacement reaction to generate the Pt-rich shell. The as-synthesized PdNi@Pt CSNSs exhibit a much improved catalytic activity and durability for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in the acidic media compared to the commercial used Pt black because of their specific structural characteristics. The facile and mild method described herein is highly attractive for the synthisis of 3D porous core-shell nanostructures.",

The obtained materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, impedance spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the indium doping promoted formation of the cubic Nb2P4O15 phase instead of the monoclinic Nb5P7O30 phase in the pristine niobium phosphates and enhanced the preservation of OH functional groups in the phosphates. The preserved OH functionalities in the phosphates after the heat treatment at 650 \u00b0C contributed to the anhydrous proton conductivity. The Nb0.9In0.1 phosphate exhibited a proton conductivity of five times higher than that of the un-doped analog at 250 \u00b0C. The conductivity was stabilized at a level of above 0.02 S cm -1 under dry atmosphere at 250 \u00b0C during the stability evaluation for 3 days.

        "title": "Chitosan/heteropolyacid composite membranes for direct methanol fuel cell",
        "abstract": "As inorganic proton conductors, phosphomolybdic acid (PMA), phosphotungstic acid (PWA) and silicotungstic acid (SiWA) are extremely attractive for proton-conducting composite membranes. An interesting phenomenon has been found in our previous experiments that the mixing of chitosan (CS) solution and different heteropolyacids (HPAs) leads to strong electrostatic interaction to form insoluble complexes. These complexes in the form of membrane (CS/PMA, CS/PWA and CS/SiWA composite membranes) have been prepared and evaluated as novel proton-conducting membranes for direct methanol fuel cells. Therefore, HPAs can be immobilized within the membranes through electrostatic interaction, which overcomes the leakage problem from membranes. CS/PMA, CS/PWA and CS/SiWA composite membranes were characterized for morphology, intermolecular interactions, and thermal stability by SEM, FTIR, and TGA, respectively. Among the three membranes, CS/PMA membrane was identified as ideal for DMFC as it exhibited low methanol permeability (2.7 \u00d7 10 \u22127 cm 2 s \u22121 ) and comparatively high proton conductivity (0.015 S cm \u22121 at 25 \u00b0C). Keywords Chitosan Heteropolyacid Composite membrane Methanol permeation Proton-conducting 1 Introduction Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) are promising candidates for portable devices or transportation applications in view of their high energy density, easy manipulation, and high efficiency [1\u20133] . Polymer electrolyte membranes, a crucial component in the DMFCs separating the cathode and anode, function as proton conductor as well as methanol separator between the cathode and anode. Nowadays, perfluorosulfonic acid membranes, such as Nafion \u00ae membranes, are the primary membranes used in the DMFCs. Although commercial Nafion \u00ae membranes have high proton conductivity, they do not meet the requirement for low methanol permeability especially at low temperatures (<100 \u00b0C) [4] . Methanol permeation results in reducing the open-circuit potential (OCP) and poisoning the electrocatalysts at the cathode. Various attempts have been made to overcome the drawbacks of Nafion \u00ae membranes for DMFC applications. The approaches described are diverse, ranging from doping with inorganic materials such as sulfonated montmorillonite [2] , silica [5] , silica/phosphotungstic acid [6] , zeolite [7] and zirconium phosphate [8] etc., in situ polymerization with poly(1-methylpyrrole) [9] or polyfurfuryl alcohol [10] to modify the surface of Nafion \u00ae [11\u201314] . Most of the modified Nafion \u00ae membranes indeed reduce methanol permeation, but their proton conductivity is often markedly lower than that of the original ones. On the other hand, enormous efforts have been made to develop new alternatives. Pore-filling membranes, which are composed of a porous substrate and a filling polymer electrolyte, have shown good performance [15,16] . Polymer materials based on the arylene main chain such as poly (ether ether ketone)s [17] and polybenzimidazole [18] have been prepared and functionalized as proton-conducting membranes. Composite membranes, which consist of polymer materials and inorganic materials, for example, phosphoric acid-doped polybenzimidazole [19] and polysulfone/heteropolyacid [20] , have also been studied. Solid heteropolyacids (HPAs) possess a unique discrete ionic structure including heteropoly anions and countercations (H + , H 3 O + , H 5 O 2 + , etc.), and consequently exhibit extremely high proton mobility [21] . Such high ionic conductivity properties make HPAs very attractive for fuel cells. Phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) as a solid-protonic electrolyte in the fuel cells was first investigated by Nakemura et al. [22] . In addition, many proton-conducting composite membranes doped with HPAs have been reported [23\u201333] . However, HPAs are likely to be dissolved in water and leak out during the cell operation, ultimately resulting in degradation in performance [23,30] . This problem could be resolved by introducing the electrostatic interactions between chitosan and HPAs. It has been found that the mixing of chitosan solution and HPAs solution leads to the formation of insoluble complexes. Therefore, HPAs can be immobilized in the membranes through electrostatic interaction. Generally, oppositely charged polyions (polycations or polyanions) interact electrostatically to form polyelectrolyte complexes. Such complexes as proton-conducting membranes have been reported in the literatures [34\u201336] . Chitosan is a natural and low-cost biopolymer with unique properties such as biocompatibility, nontoxicity, chemical and thermal stability, and has been widely studied as a promising source of membrane materials [37,38] . As a kind of polycation, chitosan is extremely attractive to prepare polyelectrolyte complexes through electrostatic interactions with polyanions [39] . The acids and salts of heteropolyanions constitute a large category of compounds, thus a variety of polyelectrolyte complexes would be formed between heteropolyanions and chitosan. In this study, we use three commercially available HPAs (Keggin-type): phosphomolybdic acid, phosphotungstic acid (PWA) and silicotungstic acid (SiWA) to prepare three kinds of CS/HPAs composite membranes (CS/PMA, CS/PWA and CS/SiWA). These composite membranes were evaluated as novel proton-conducting materials for DMFC in terms of SEM, FTIR, TGA, mechanical properties, ion exchange capacity, water uptake, proton conductivity, and methanol permeability. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Chitosan powder (Haidebei Ltd., China) has the degree of deacetylation of 95% and the molecular weight of 50000 g mol \u22121 . Phosphomolybdic acid (PMA, H 3 PMo 12 O 40 ), phosphotungstic acid (PWA, H 3 PW 12 O 40 ) and silicotungstic acid (SiWA, H 4 SiW 12 O 40 ) were purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagent Factory and used as received. Nafion \u00ae membranes were obtained from DuPont. Sodium hydroxide and acetic acid were purchased from the Bei Hua Fine Chemical, Beijing, China. The deionized water was prepared with Millipore (>18.23 M\u03a9). 2.2 Formation of insoluble complexes of chitosan and HPAs 1% (w/v) chitosan solution was prepared by dissolving chitosan powder in 2% (v/v) acetic acid solution. After the chitosan powder was fully dissolved, the solution was filtered and deformed by leaving it quiescent at ambient temperature for 2 h. 2 ml of 0.02 M PMA, PWA and SiWA solutions were put into three different test-tubes and then 2 ml chitosan solution was added into each of them. 2.3 Preparation of composite membranes Chitosan/heteropolyacids composite membranes (CS/HPAs) were prepared in an infiltration and self-assembly method. As an example, chitosan/phosphomolybdic acid (CS/PMA) was used here to describe the sample preparation procedure. The 1% (w/v) chitosan solution was poured onto a glass plate and left to dry via evaporation for 24 h and then heated at 60 \u00b0C for 6 h. After the dried membranes were neutralized in 1 M NaOH and then washed thoroughly [40] , they were immersed in 0.05 M phosphomolybdic acid solution for 24 h and then were washed with deionized water and stored in deionized water prior to the different measurements. 2.4 The stability of HPAs in membranes The stability of HPAs in composite membranes was tested as follows: the CH/HPAs membrane was washed thoroughly in water with stirring at 80 \u00b0C for 24 h, and then the resulted membranes from this process were termed as W-CH/HPAs membrane. The percent weight of molybdenum (or tungsten) in the CH/HPAs membrane and the W-CH/HPAs membrane were determined with inductively coupled plasma\u2013mass spectrometry (ICP\u2013MS), POEMS MODEL (TJA Corporation). 2.5 Characterizations of composite membranes Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was carried out on a Philips XL30 ESEM at 30 kV. IR spectra (4000\u2013500 cm \u22121 , resolution 4 cm \u22121 ) were recorded with a Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a PerkinElmer thermal analysis system. Measurements were made heating from 40 to 650 \u00b0C, at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 under N 2 atmosphere. Tensile measurement was performed with a mechanical tester Instron-1211 instrument at a speed of 10 mm min \u22121 . The swelling of membranes was evaluated by the water uptake in the following way: membrane samples were equilibrated in deionized water at ambient temperature for 24 h, and the swollen membranes ( W w ) were weighed as quickly as possible after surface-attached water on the membrane samples was removed with filter paper. Weight of dry membranes ( W d ) was determined after completely drying in 60 \u00b0C for 12 h. The water uptake was calculated by using the following equation: (1) WU ( % ) = W w \u2212 W d W d \u00d7 100 Ion exchange capacity (IEC) was determined through titration. The membranes in the H + form were immersed in a 1-M NaCl solution for 24 h to liberate the H + ions (the H + ions in the membrane were replaced by Na + ions). The H + ions in solution were then titrated with 0.01 M NaOH. The proton conductivity of the CS/HPAs membranes was measured by a four-electrode AC impedance method from 0.1 Hz to 100 KHz, 10 mV ac perturbation and 0.0 V dc rest voltage. Impedance spectra were recorded using a Princeton Applied Research Model 273A Potentiostat (Model 5210 Frequency Response Detector, EG&G PARC, Princeton, NJ). The membranes were fixed in a measuring cell made of two outer gold wires to feed current to the sample and two inner gold wires to measure the voltage drops [41] . The methanol permeability of these membranes was determined and calculated by the method described in the literature [36] . The methanol concentration in the receptor chamber was measured versus time by using a gas chromatograph (Shimazu GC-14B) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Formation of insoluble CS/HPAs of chitosan and HPAs Chitosan is a weak base and its solubility is pH-dependent. When the pH value exceeds its p K a (about 6.3), chitosan becomes insoluble [42,43] . When the chitosan solution was added into the HPAs solution, insoluble complexes were formed in those tubes, as shown in Fig. 1 . The same phenomenon occurred even when the pH value of the chitosan solution was changed. These results suggest that: firstly, there is a strong electrostatic interaction between HPAs and chitosan, which makes HPAs immobilized in the complexes, a mechanism to prevent the HPAs from water leakage from membranes. Secondly, the traditional method (mixing of the chitosan solution with inorganic fillers or polyelectrolyte solution in different proportions followed by casting) cannot be applied in the preparation of CS/HPAs composite membranes. Instead, the procedure of infiltration and self-assembly should be used, as detailed in the previous section. 3.2 The stability of HPAs in membranes The percent weight of the HPAs (excluding crystalline water) in the CS/HPAs membranes and W-CS/HPAs can be calculated by the percent weight of molybdenum (or tungsten). The percent weights of the HPAs in the three W-CS/HPAs membranes were 24.5% (PMA), 19.0% (PWA) and 21.4% (SiWA), respectively; while the percent weight of the HPAs in the three CS/HPAs membranes were calculated to be 26.5% (PMA), 20.1% (PWA) and 22.9% (SiWA), respectively. Clearly the percent weight of the HPAs in the W-CS/HPAs membranes is slightly lower than that in the CS/HPAs membranes, which might be attributed to dissolving and leaking of physically absorbed HPAs. Consequently, the HPAs are very stable in the CS/HPAs membranes and could be stabilized by the strong electrostatic interaction. 3.3 Scanning electron microscopy Fig. 2 shows the surface and cross-sectional images of the three CS/HPAs composite membranes. It is clearly seen from this figure that the CS/HPAs composite membranes are homogeneous with no phase separation, implying that the HPAs do not recrystallize into large particles, but electrostatically interact with chitosan to form the CS/HPAs. 3.4 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy Fig. 3 presents the IR spectra of PMA, chitosan and CS/PMA membranes. The IR spectra of PMA (Keggin-type) in Fig. 3 A shows four characteristic bands at 1064, 963, 868, 793 cm \u22121 , and these bands are ascribed to the stretching vibrations \u03bd as (P\u2013O), \u03bd as (M O O), \u03bd as (M O \u2013O c \u2013M O ) and \u03bd as (M O \u2013O e \u2013M O ), respectively [44] . The bands at 931, 856 and 797 cm \u22121 of the CS/PMA membranes are attributed to \u03bd as (M O O), \u03bd as (M O \u2013O b \u2013M O ) and \u03bd as (M O \u2013O c \u2013M O ), respectively. The peak of the CS/HPAs membranes at 1063 cm \u22121 is ascribed to \u03bd as (P\u2013O) and the saccharide structure of chitosan. All of these characteristic bands are also presented in the spectra of the CS/PMA membranes, which indicates the preservation of the Keggin ion geometry in the CS/PMA membranes. In the IR spectra of CS, the bands at 1152, 1068 and 1030 cm \u22121 can be assigned to the saccharide structure [45] . Fig. 4 presents the IR spectra of PWA, chitosan and CS/PWA membranes and Fig. 5 presents IR spectra of SiWA, chitosan and CS/SiWA membranes. Similarly, all characteristic bands of PWA and SiWA are also appeared in the spectra of the CS/PWA membranes and the CS/SiWA membranes respectively, which confirms the preservation of the Keggin ion geometry in the CS/HPAs membranes. 3.5 Thermal analysis The thermal stability of the CS/PMA, CS/PWA and CS/SiWA membranes was studied by thermogravimetric analysis, as shown in Fig. 6 . The degradation processes of the three CS/HPAs composite membranes are similar. There are three major weight loss stages (40\u2013120, 200\u2013275 and 275\u2013650 \u00b0C for CS/PMA, 40\u2013120, 210\u2013280 and 280\u2013650 \u00b0C for CS/PWA and 40\u2013120, 220\u2013315 and 315\u2013650 \u00b0C for CS/SiWA) in the tested temperature range. Around 6% weight loss takes place in the first stage and the lost components mainly are small molecules such as physically absorbed water and acetic acid. The thermal degradation of the CS/HPAs composite membranes takes place at a maximum rate in the second stage. The weight loss (17% for CS/PMA, 14% for CS/PWA and 21% for CS/SiWA) can be attributed to the release of structural water from PMA [31] and the scission of the ether linkage in chitosan backbone [46] . In the third stage, above 290 \u00b0C, the weight loss is assigned to structure collapse of the HPAs [31] and the thermal decomposition of glucosamine residue [33,46] . So it can be concluded that the CS/HPAs composite membranes are stable at desired operating temperatures (<100 \u00b0C) for DMFCs. 3.6 Mechanical properties The break strength and elongation at break of CS/HPAs and CS membranes are given in Table 1 . From the results, it can be observed that CS/HPAs membranes exhibit much larger break strength than CS membranes, but smaller elongation at break than CS membranes. These results may be attributed to the strong electrostatic interaction between HPAs and chitosan, which results in an increase in the rigidity and a reduction in elongation at break. 3.7 Water uptake and IEC The swelling property has a profound effect on proton transport and dimensional stability of proton-conducting membranes. Proton transport requires a significant amount of water to coordinate with protons. However, excessively high levels of water uptake can result in the dimensional change of the membranes, which leads to the loss of their mechanical properties. Table 1 shows the results of water uptake for CS/HPAs and Nafion \u00ae 117 membranes. The water uptakes of CS/PMA, CS/PWA and CS/SiWA are 18.6%, 17.0% and 17.4% respectively, markedly higher than that of CS (11.6%)and Nafion \u00ae 117 (15.2%), which is due to the distinct hydrophilicity of the HPAs (Keggin-type) and CS. Ion exchange capacity is an indirect and reliable approximation of the proton conductivity. The IEC values of all the membranes are listed in Table 1 . The IEC values of CS/HPAs range from 0.38 mmol g \u22121 for CS/PWA to 0.46 mmol g \u22121 for CS/PMA, which are lower than that of the Nafion \u00ae 117 (0.9 mmol g \u22121 ), but much higher than that of the CS membranes (0.22 mmol g \u22121 ). This result is consistent with that of proton conductivity. 3.8 Proton conductivity Proton conductivity ( \u03c3 ) is one of the most important properties for proton-conducting membranes used in fuel cell. Fig. 7 shows typical impedance spectrum of CS/PMA membrane obtained using four-electrode longitudinal geometry. The \u03c3 values of the CS/HPAs, CS and Nafion \u00ae 117 membranes at 25 \u00b0C were listed in Table 1 . Among the three membranes, the CS/PMA membranes exhibited higher proton conductivity than the CS/PWA and CS/SiWA, which is mainly because the proton conductivity of PMA is higher than those of PWA and SiWA. Note that currently no standard methods are adopted to determine proton conductivity, and the \u03c3 value of same membrane reported in the literatures were not always consistent due to the different test methods and various conditions applied. For example, the \u03c3 value of chitosan reported by Ram\u00edrez-Salgado et al. [47] and Wan et al. [48] was in the order of 10 \u22124 S cm \u22121 , much lower than that (in the order of 10 \u22122 S cm \u22121 ) obtained by Jiang et al. [34] and Smitha et al. [35] . In this study, the \u03c3 values of the Nafion \u00ae 117 and CS membranes are 8.4 \u00d7 10 \u22122 and 3.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 S cm \u22121 . The \u03c3 value of CS/HPAs is lower than that of the Nafion \u00ae 117, but much higher than that of the CS membranes. Fig. 8 shows the proton conductivity as a function of temperature. The \u03c3 values of the CS/HPAs composite membranes increase with increasing temperature and the change of \u03c3 values with temperature follows the Arrhenius relationship. From the Arrhenius plots, the activation energy ( E a ) can be calculated. The E a of the CS/PMA, CS/PWA and CS/SiWA membranes is 11.2, 12.3 and 10.4 kJ mol \u22121 , lower than that for only \u201cjump\u201d mechanism which was reported to be 14\u201340 kJ mol \u22121 [49] . It has been generally accepted that Grotthus mechanism and vehicle mechanism are commonly adopted in discussing the proton transfer. In the CS/HPAs membranes, HPAs are preserved in the form of the Keggin ion geometry, and in solid HPAs (Keggin-type) with crystalline water, the proton migration can be ascribed to the vehicle mechanism [50] ; meanwhile, membranes could hold much water due to the distinct hydrophilicity of CS. Therefore, HPAs and CS construct continuous hydrophilic channels, which enables protons to transport by vehicle mechanism in the form of hydronium ions. Due to electrostatic interaction between CS and HPAs, CS/HPAs membranes contain numerous hydroxy group, \u2013NH 3 + and heteropolyanions, the proton transferred along the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds by \u201cjumping\u201d from one function group to another. Therefore we suggest that both the vehicle mechanism and the Grotthuss mechanism are responsible for the proton conducivity of the CS/HPAs membranes. 3.9 Methanol permeability The methanol permeability of the CS/HPAs and Nafion \u00ae 117 membranes were measured at ambient temperature, respectively, and the results are shown in Table 1 . The methanol permeability of the CS/PMA, CS/PWA and CS/SiWA is 2.7 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , 3.3 \u00d7 10 \u22127 and 3.8 \u00d7 10 \u22127 cm 2 s \u22121 , much lower than that of the Nafion \u00ae 117 (2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 cm 2 s \u22121 ). Compared to the Nafion \u00ae 117, the CS/HPAs show strong resistance to methanol permeability. This indicates that methanol cross-over could be significantly reduced if the CS/HPAs were used in DMFCs. The polymer electrolyte membranes applied in DMFCs should possess simultaneously high proton conductivity and low methanol permeability. Although the ratio of proton conductivity ( \u03c3 ) to methanol permeability ( P ) alone is not sufficient to evaluate the membranes performance, it is often used to describe and compare the total performances of various membranes. A high \u03c3 / P value implies a better performance of the membrane. The \u03c3 / P values obtained for the three CS/HPAs and Nafion \u00ae 117 membranes are shown in Table 1 . It can be found that the \u03c3 / P values obtained for the CS/PMA and CS/PWA are higher than that for the Nafion \u00ae 117, but not for the CS/SiWA. 4 Conclusions The three CS/HPAs composite membranes (CS/PMA, CS/PWA and CS/SiWA) have been prepared by an infiltration and self-assembly method, and evaluated as novel proton-conducting membranes for DMFC. HPAs can be immobilized within the membranes through electrostatic interaction, which overcomes the leakage problem from membranes. The homogeneous CS/HPAs membranes show good thermal stability up to 200 \u00b0C and high water uptake. FTIR spectra indicate the preservation of the Keggin ion geometry in the CS/HPAs membranes. Among the three CS/HPAs membranes, the CS/PMA membrane exhibits the highest proton conductivity and the lowest methanol permeability. Accordingly, the \u03c3 / P value of 5.6 \u00d7 10 4 S s cm \u22123 for the CS/PMA membrane was obtained, about two times higher than that for Nafion \u00ae 117. Therefore, the CS/HPAs composite membranes (especially the CS/PMA membrane) are promising proton-conducting materials and have great potential for application in DMFCs.

Low surface area of ATO caused poor dispersion of Pt particles compared to composite supports, which limited the mass activity of the supported catalysts.

        "abstract": "The PtRu/C electrocatalyst with high loading (PtRu of 60 wt%) was prepared by synergetic effect of ultrasonic radiation and mechanical stirring. Physicochemical characterizations show that the size of PtRu particles of as-prepared PtRu/C catalyst is only several nanometers (2\u20134 nm), and the PtRu nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed on carbon surface. Electrochemistry and single passive direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) tests indicate that the as-prepared PtRu/C electrocatalyst possessed larger electrochemical active surface (EAS) area and enhanced electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The enhancement could be attributed to the synergetic effect of ultrasound radiation and mechanical stirring, which can avoid excess concentration of partial solution and provide a uniform environment for the nucleation and growth of metal particles simultaneously hindering the agglomeration of PtRu particles on carbon surface.

        "abstract": "A modified impregnation method was used to prepare highly dispersive carbon-supported PtRu catalyst (PtRu/C). Two modifications to the conventional impregnation method were performed: one was to precipitate the precursors ((NH 4 ) 2 PtCl 6 and Ru(OH) 3 ) on the carbon support before metal reduction; the other was to add a buffer into the synthetic solution to stabilize the pH. The prepared catalyst showed a much higher activity for methanol electro-oxidation than a catalyst prepared by the conventional impregnation method, even higher than that of current commercially available, state-of-the-art catalysts. The morphology of the prepared catalyst was characterized using TEM and XRD measurements to determine particle sizes, alloying degree, and lattice parameters. Electrochemical methods were also used to ascertain the electrochemical active surface area and the specific activity of the catalyst. Based on XPS measurements, the high activity of this catalyst was found to originate from both metallic Ru (Ru 0 ) and hydrous ruthenium oxides (RuO x H y ) species on the catalyst surface. However, RuO x H y was found to be more active than metallic Ru. In addition, the anhydrous ruthenium oxide (RuO 2 ) species on the catalyst surface was found to be less active.",

The results indicated that for oxygen reduction, the electrocatalytic activity of the Au/C catalyst prepared with the PVA protection method is much better than that of a Au/C catalyst prepared with the pre-precipitation method. This is due to the small average size and low relative crystallinity of the Au particles in the Au/C catalyst prepared by the PVA protection method, compared to that of the Au/C catalyst prepared by the pre-precipitation method, illustrating that the average size and the relative crystallinity of the Au particles has an effect on the electrocatalytic activity of the Au/C catalyst for oxygen reduction. In addition, because Au has no electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of formic acid, the Au/C catalyst possesses a high formic acid tolerance. After the electrocatalytic activity of the Au/C catalyst for the oxygen reduction is improved, it is suitable to be used as the cathodic catalyst in DFAFC.",

Combined with a DC-DC convertor, the fuel cell can realize a much more stable constant voltage output; combined with super capacitors, it can provide a large current pulse discharge. After a reproducible operation of approximately 300 h at 60 mA with five times of refueling fuel, the Faradic efficiency and energy efficiency were a little decreased and the maximum performance degradation was approximately 8%. As increasing the operating time, the methanol crossover and produced water at the cathode could cause the fuel cell performance degradation.

A high-redox potential (254 mV vs. Ag/AgCl) was obtained on glassy carbon (GC) electrode modified by immobilizing Cyt c on rod-like SBA-15. With ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013vis), circular dichroism (CD), FTIR and cyclic voltammetry, it was demonstrated that immobilization made Cyt c exhibits stable and ideal electrochemical characteristics while the biological activity of immobilized Cyt c is retained as usual. The electrochemistry behavior at the modified GC electrode is surface-controlled quasi-reversible process with an enhanced electron-transfer rate constant of 2.20 s \u22121 because of the optimal DETT between Cyt c and SBA-15. It was also found that the modified GC electrode exhibited a predominant electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, which may open up a possibility for designing and fabricating enzyme electrodes with application potentials in biosensor and biofuel cells.

The kinetic parameters, charge transfer coefficient and the diffusion coefficient of formic acid were obtained under the quasi steady-state conditions.",

        "abstract": "A series of new composite proton exchange membranes for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) based on poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA), phosphotungstic acid (PWA) and silica were prepared. The highest proton conductivity ( \u03c3 ) of these membranes is 0.017 S/cm at ambient temperature. The methanol permeability ( D ) of these composite membranes ranges from 10 \u22127 to 10 \u22128 cm 2 /s. From the ratios of \u03c3 / D , it was found that the optimal weight composition of the PVA/PWA/SiO 2 membrane is PVA/PWA/SiO 2 =0.40:0.40:0.20 wt. Infrared (IR) spectrographic measurements indicate that the Keggin structure characteristics of the PW 12 O 40 3\u2212 anion is present in the composite membranes. Cyclic voltammetry shows that the electrochemical stability window of the complex membrane is from \u22120.5 to 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode. The results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) show that silica can improve the thermal stability of the complexes and the single Tg of the membrane indicates that the membrane is homogeneous. The complexes behave as X-ray amorphous. The swelling results indicate that both PWA and SiO 2 decrease the water absorption of the PVA complex membranes.",

The morphology and electrocatalytic properties of the as-obtained catalysts have been investigated by transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The catalytic activity and stability of Pt/TiO 2-C catalyst are both improved markedly compared with that of Pt/C catalyst. The initial and final current of Pt/TiO 2-C catalyst after 3600 s reactions for methanol oxidation is about 1.57 and 6 times as high as that of the Pt/C catalyst, respectively. The promotion effect of TiO 2 on catalytic activity and stability for Pt/TiO 2-C catalyst is investigated further by physical and electrochemical measurements. It is found that the addition of TiO 2 could facilitate CO removal, hinder CO formation on Pt surface during methanol oxidation, and inhibit the agglomeration and corrosion of Pt particles, which can be resulted from the strong interaction between TiO 2-C and Pt. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "The control for surface of catalysts is intrinsically required to improve catalytic efficiency. In current work, we demonstrate that the surface of Pt/C catalyst can be effectively reconstructed by ultrasonic mixing with Pb/C in an acidic environment and electorchemical activation process. As a result, the surface-reconstructed Pt/C catalyst exhibits a significant enhancement of activity of a ca. 10-fold improvement in mass activity and a ca. 38-fold improvement in specific activity as compared with a pure Pt/C catalyst for formic acid electroxidation (FAEO). The evidences show that some of Pb species are transferred from Pb/C to surface of Pt/C catalyst probably through the dissolution-adsorption pathway during ultrasonic mixing and electorchemical activation processes. The presence of Pb on surface of Pt not only isolates the continuous Pt sites through the third-body effect but also modifies electronic band structure of platinum via electronic effect, which leads to that the direct pathway is preferably occurred and the CO formation is effectively inhibited. These results provide useful information for further understanding the promotion mechanism of Pb ad-atom during FAEO and rationally controlling the catalytic surface to improve catalytic efficiency. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

The morphology, composition and electrocatalytic properties of the PdEuOx/C catalyst are investigated by the transmission electronmicroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray diffraction, the linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry, respectively. The EDX results confirm the existence of EuOx in the PdEuOx/C catalysts. The XRD results indicate that the Pd is in the state of face-centered cubic phase structure. The linear sweeping voltammetry and chronoamperometry measurements show that the current of formic acid electrooxidation on the PdEuOx/C catalyst is ca. 2.5 times and 9 times as high as that of the home-made Pd/C catalyst, respectively; moreover, the performances are also much higher than the commercial Pd/C catalyst.

        "title": "Sulfonated polyimides bearing benzimidazole groups for proton exchange membranes",
        "abstract": "A series of sulfonated polyimides containing benzimidazole groups were synthesized using 4,4\u2032-binaphthyl-1,1\u2032,8,8\u2032-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA), 4,4\u2032-diaminodiphenyl ether-2,2\u2032-disulfonic acid (ODADS) as the sulfonated diamine, and 2-(3\u2032,5\u2032-diaminophenyl)benzimidazole ( a ) or 6,4\u2032-diamino-2-phenylbenzimidazole ( b ) as the nonsulfonated diamine. The electrolyte properties of the synthesized polyimides ( Ia \u2212 x , Ib \u2212 x , x refers to molar percentage of the sulfonated diamine) were investigated and compared with those of polyimides ( Ic \u2212 x ) from BTDA, ODADS, and m -phenylenediamine ( c ). All synthesized polyimides possessed high molecular weights revealed by their high viscosity, and formation of tough and flexible membranes. Polyimides with benzimidazole groups exhibited much better swelling capacity than those without benzimidazole groups. This was attributed to the strong interchain interaction through basic benzimidazole functions and sulfonic acid groups. The sulfonated polyimides that are incorporated with 1,1\u2032,8,8\u2032-binaphthalimide exhibited better hydrolytic stability than that with 1,4,5,8-naphthalimide. Polyimide membranes with good water stability as well as high proton conductivity were developed. Polyimide membrane ( Ia \u2212 90), for example, did not lose mechanical properties after being soaked in boiling water for 1000 h, while its proton conductivity was still at a high level (compared to that of Nafion 117). Keywords Sulfonated polyimides Benzimidazole Proton exchange membrane 1 Introduction Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have attracted much attention as alternative sources of electricity due to their low emissions and high conversion efficiency [1,2] . Improvement in performance of the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) has been the focus in the development of PEMFCs because the PEM is one of the key components for successful PEMFC fabrications [3] . Nafion (Dupont), a perfluorosulfonic acid polymer, is a currently used PEM in commercial systems. Nafion is highly proton conductive and chemically and physically stable at moderate temperatures. However, these preferable properties are deteriorated above their glass transition temperature ( T g = ca. 110 \u00b0C) [4,5] . High gas permeability, high cost, high methanol crossover, and environmental inadaptability of the fluorinated materials are also serious drawbacks for the practical fuel cell applications. These limitations have stimulated many efforts in the development of alternative non-fluorinated materials with low cost and high performance [6\u20138] . So far, many kinds of sulfonated aromatic polymers, such as poly(ether ether ketone) [9\u201314] , poly(ether sulfone)s [15\u201322] , polysulfone [23] , polyimide [24\u201331] , and poly( p -phenylene)s [32\u201335] have been widely investigated as candidates for PEM materials. Among those sulfonated aromatic polymers, sulfonated aromatic polyimides (SPIs) are considered as promising alternative materials for fuel cell applications due to their high thermal stability, excellent mechanical strength, superior chemical resistance, and good film forming ability. However, water stability of sulfonated polyimides has been an issue to be addressed. The aromatic imide linkage tends to hydrolyze under high moisture conditions and at high temperatures, and this results in the degradation of the polymer main chain and a dramatic drop in the mechanical strength for SPI membranes. To investigate the relationship between water stability and chemical structure of SPIs and to achieve the high water stability, many types of SPIs based on novel sulfonated diamines have been developed. Okamoto and co-workers have reported on the water stability of sulfonated polyimides from different sulfonated diamines. They revealed the factors controlling the water stability of sulfonated polyimide membranes, of which the most important factor is the basicity of the sulfonated diamine [36,37] . Moreover, they have found that the sulfonated and nonsulfonated diamines having flexible linkages could improve water stability of the polyimide based on six-membered ring dianhydride [38,39] . Watanabe et\u00a0al. had shown that NTDA-based SPIs with bulky fluorenyl groups having unique water uptake behavior produced higher conductivities than Nafion [40] . They also reported that polyimides bearing aliphatic sulfonic acid groups had enhanced water stability [41,42] . Acid\u2013base blend membranes synthesized by a combination of polymeric nitrogen-containing bases (N-bases) with polymeric sulfonic acids are new class of interesting materials that exhibit improved thermal stability and good resistance to swelling. For example, Han and co-workers reported the synthesis of the base polyimide using diaminoacrydine hemisulfate and 1,4,5,8-naphthalene-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTDA), and its blending with a polyimide having sulfonic acid group in the main chain [43] . The formation and properties of the blend membranes are based on the interaction between the sulfonic acid groups and the N-bases. The formed polysalt between the acid polymer and base polymer acts as ionic cross-linking point and it also resists the polymer swelling. In the similar manner, the polymers bearing both sulfonic acid groups and N-bases should possess the improved water stability. In view of this consideration, efforts have been made to develop membrane materials based on sulfonated polyimides containing benzimidazole groups. In this article, we report the synthesis of sulfonated polyimides by copolymerization of 4,4\u2032-binaphthyl-1,1\u2032,8,8\u2032-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA), 4,4\u2032-diaminodiphenyl ether-2,2\u2032-disulfonic acid (ODADS), and 2-(3\u2032,5\u2032-diaminophenyl)benzimidazole ( a ) or 6,4\u2032-diamino-2\u2013phenylbenzimidazole ( b ). The introduction of basic benzimidazole groups was expected to increase interchain interaction of the SPIs, thus to improve the water swelling capacity of the SPIs. 4,4\u2032-Binaphthyl-1,1\u2032,8,8\u2032-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA) was used due to its unique structure. BTDA dianhydride has two anhydride groups which are located on the two twist noncoplanar naphthalene rings. As a result, the polyimides from BTDA should possess a decreased positive charge density of carbonyl groups in the naphthalimide moieties compared with that from NTDA. This is favorable to depress the hydrolysis of the imide rings. For comparison study, the polyimides ( IIc \u2212 x ) from BTDA, ODADS, and m -phenylenediamine were also synthesized. The effects of both the dianhydride and the diamine structures on the properties of the copolymers were evaluated through the study of their electrolyte properties. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials 3,5-Dinitrobenzoyl chloride, o -phenylenediamine, m -phenylenediamine (MPDA), and 4,4\u2032-diaminodiphenyl ether (ODA) were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. Reagent grade anhydrous NiBr 2 was dried at 220 \u00b0C under vacuum. Triphenylphosphine (PPh 3 ) was recrystallized from hexane. Zinc dust was stirred with acetic acid, filtrated, washed thoroughly with diethyl ether, and dried under vacuum. Polyphosphoric acid, 5-chloro-1,8-naphthalic anhydride and 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride were used as received from Beijing Multi. Technology Co., Ltd. 4,4\u2032-Diaminodiphenyl ether-2,2\u2032-disulfonic acid (ODADS) was prepared according to a previously described procedure [38] . All other reactants and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and used as received. 2.2 Monomer and polymer syntheses 2.2.1 Synthesis of dimethyl-4-chloro-1,8-naphthalenedicarboxylate A mixture of 100 g (0.43 mol) of 4-chloro-1,8-naphthalic anhydride ( 1 ), 128 g (0.62 mol) of phosphorus pentachloride and 180 mL of phosphorus oxychloride was refluxed for 24 h and the solvent then removed by distillation. The residual solid was added slowly into 500 mL methanol while cooling in an ice-bath and stirring vigorously. The resulting mixture was allowed to stand for 0.5 h at room temperature and diluted with water to 1500 mL. The solid was filtered off and washed with water and recrystallized from about 400 mL of methanol which gave 100.6 g (84.0%) of white crystals, m.p. 80\u201381 \u00b0C. 1 H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO- d 6 ): \u03b4 (ppm): 3.92 (s, 6H, \u2013CH 3 ), 7.64\u20137.72 (t, 2H, Ar-H), 7.91\u20137.94 (d, 1H, Ar-H), 8.06\u20138.08 (d, 1H, Ar-H), 8.51\u20138.53 (d, 1H, Ar-H). 2.2.2 Synthesis of 4,4\u2032-binaphthyl-1,1\u2032,8,8\u2032-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA) To a 100 mL three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a serum cap, nitrogen inlet and outlet was added anhydrous NiBr 2 (0.087 g, 0.4 mmol), PPh 3 (0.786 g, 3 mmol), zinc dust (1.56 g, 24 mmol), and dry DMAc (5 mL). The flask was evacuated and filled with nitrogen three times and then placed in an oil bath heated at 85\u201390 \u00b0C. After the red-brown color was formed, a nitrogen purged solution of dimethyl-4-chloro-1,8-naphthalenedicarboxylate (1.67 g, 6 mmol) in 15 mL dry DMAc was added via a syringe. The mixture was stirred at 85 \u00b0C for another 2\u20134 h until the red color resumed. The resulting mixture was poured into 300 mL 10% HCl/water. The solid was collected by filtration and washed with ethanol. The tetra-ester was treated with potassium hydroxide (1.5 g) in ethylene glycol (20 mL) at 150 \u00b0C for 18 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solid was filtered off and washed with acetone. It was dissolved in water and the solution was acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid to yield the tetra-acid. The solid was washed with water thoroughly and dehydrated at 200 \u00b0C under vacuum for 12 h to afford pure dianhydride BTDA 1.02 g (89%). 1 H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO- d 6 ): \u03b4 (ppm): 7.70\u20137.73 (d, 1H), 7.77\u20137.82 (t, 1H), 7.97\u20137.99 (d, 1H), 8.57\u20138.59 (d, 1H), 8.68\u20138.71 (d, 1H). Anal. Calcd for C 24 H 10 O 6 (394.05): C, 73.10; H, 2.56; Found: C, 73.00; H, 2.67. IR (KBr, \u03bd c o , cm \u22121 ): 1773, 1732. 2.2.3 Synthesis of sulfonated copolyimide ( Ia \u2212 50) To a 100 mL completely dried 3-necked flask were added 0.3604 g (1 mmol) of ODADS, 10 mL of m -cresol, and 0.68 mL (about 2 mmol) of Et 3 N successively under nitrogen flow. After the sulfonated diamine was completely dissolved, 0.7886 g (2 mmol) of BTDA, 0.2243 g (1 mmol) of nonsulfonated diamine (DAPBI) and 0.4884 g (4 mmol) benzoic acid were added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for a few minutes and then heated at 80 \u00b0C for 4 h and 180 \u00b0C for 20 h. After cooling to 80 \u00b0C, additional 20 mL of m -cresol was added to dilute the highly viscous solution, and then the solution was poured into acetone. The fibre-like precipitate was filtered off, washed with acetone thoroughly, and dried in vacuum oven for 12 h at 150 \u00b0C to give product with 97% yield. FT-IR: 1705 cm \u22121 ( \u03bd sym C O), 1659 cm \u22121 ( \u03bd asym C O) and 1368 cm \u22121 ( \u03bd C\u2013N imide). The above procedures were followed for the synthesis of polyimides Ib \u2212 x , Ic \u2212 x expecting that the molar ratios of nonsulfonated diamine (DAPBI, BIA or MPDA) were different. The polyimide IIc \u2212 60 was synthesized from NTDA, ODADS and m -phenylenediamine (1/0.6/0.4) following the same procedure as above. 2.3 Membrane preparation and proton exchange A series of tough, ductile copolymer membranes were prepared with a controlled thickness of 30\u201350 \u03bcm. The triethylammonium salts of the copolymers were redissolved in m -cresol to form a 4\u20135% solution at 80 \u00b0C. The solutions was filtered and cast onto glass plates at 120 \u00b0C for 12 h. The as-cast membranes were soaked in ethanol for 24 h to remove the residual solvent, and then treated with 1.0 N sulfonic acid at room temperature for 4 days for proton exchange. The proton-exchanged membranes were thoroughly washed with deionized water and then dried in vacuum at 150 \u00b0C for 10 h. 2.4 Polymer characterization 2.4.1 Measurements 1 H NMR spectra were measured at 300 MHz on an AV600 spectrometer. FT-IR spectra were obtained with a Bio-Rad digilab Division FTS-80 FT-IR spectrometer. The inherent viscosities were determined on 0.5 g/dL concentration of polymer in m -cresol with an Ubbelohde capillary viscometer at 30 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b0C. The thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out in nitrogen with a Perkin\u2013Elmer TGA-2 thermogravimetric analyzer at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min. Tensile measurements were performed with a mechanical tester Instron-1211 instrument at a speed of 1 mm/min. The relative humidity was 50%\u00a0RH. 2.4.2 Water uptake and dimensional changes The membrane (30\u201340 mg per sheet) was dried at 80 \u00b0C under vacuum for 6 h until constant weight as dry material was obtained. It was immersed into deionized water at room temperature for 4 h. Then the membranes were taken out, wiped with tissue paper, and quickly weighted on a microbalance. Water uptake of the membranes was calculated from: (1) WU = ( W s \u2212 W d ) / W d where W d and W s are the weights of dry and corresponding water-swollen membranes, respectively. Dimensional changes of the copolymer membranes was investigated by immersing the round shaped samples into water at room temperature for a given time, the changes of thickness and diameter were calculated from: (2) \u0394 T c = ( T \u2212 T s ) / T s ; \u0394 L c = ( L \u2212 L s ) / L s where T s and L s are the thickness and diameter of the membrane equilibrated at 70% RH, respectively; T and L refer to those of the membrane immersed in liquid water for 5 h. 2.4.3 Oxidative stability A small piece of membrane sample with a thickness of about 40 \u03bcm was soaked in Fenton's reagent (30 ppm FeSO 4 in 30% H 2 O 2 ) at room temperature. The stability was evaluated by recording the time when membranes began to dissolve and dissolved completely. 2.4.4 Ion exchange capacity Ion exchange capacity (IEC) was determined through titration. The membranes in the H + form were immersed in a 1 N NaCl solution for 24 h to liberate the H + ions (the H + ions in the membrane were replaced by Na + ions). The H + ions in solution were then titrated with 0.01 N NaOH using phenolphthalein as an indicatior, and the membrane was kept in the solution for the titration. 2.4.5 Methanol permeability Methanol diffusion coefficients were determined using an H's test cell with a solution containing 2 N methanol in water on one side and pure water on the other side. Magnetic stirrers were used in each compartment to ensure uniformity. Methanol concentration within the water cell was monitored by SHIMADZU GC-1020A series gas chromatograph. The methanol diffusion coefficients were calculated by the following equation: (3) C B ( t ) = A V B DK L C A ( t \u2212 t 0 ) Where C A and C B are the methanol concentration of feed side and that permeated through the membrane, respectively. A , L and V B are the effective area, the thickness of membrane and the volume of permeated compartment, respectively. DK is defined as the methanol permeability and t 0 is the time lag. 2.4.6 Proton conductivity The proton conductivity ( \u03c3 , S/cm) of each membrane coupon (size: 1 cm \u00d7 4 cm) was obtained using \u03c3 = d / L s W s R ( d : distance between reference electrodes, and L s and W s are the thickness and width of the membrane, respectively). The resistance value ( R ) was measured by four-point probe alternating current (ac) impedance spectroscopy using an electrode system connected with an impedance/gain-phase analyzer (Solatron 1260) and an electrochemical interface (Solatron 1287, Farnborough Hampshire, ONR, UK) [44] . The membranes were sandwiched between two pairs of gold-plate electrodes. The membranes and the electrodes were set in a Teflon cell and the distance between the reference electrodes was 1 cm. The cell was placed in a thermo-controlled chamber in liquid water for measurement. Conductivity measurements under fully hydrated conditions were carried out with the cell immersed in liquid water. All samples were equilibrated in water for at least 24 h before the conductivity measurements. At a given temperature, the samples were equilibrated for at least 30 min before any measurements. Repeated measurements were then taken at that given temperature with 10-min interval until no more change in conductivity was observed. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Monomer synthesis The synthetic route of 4,4\u2032-binaphthyl-1,1\u2032,8,8\u2032-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA) is outlined in Scheme 1 . Dimethyl-4-chloro-1,8-naphthalenedicarboxylate ( 2 ) was synthesized with 84% yield by the reaction of 4-chloro-1,8-naphthalic anhydride ( 1 ) with phosphorus pentachloride and subsequent esterification with methanol. The Ni(0) catalytic coupling of 2 afforded tetra-ester 3 in almost quantitative yield. Hydrolysis of the tetra-ester 3 with potassium hydroxide in ethylene glycol and subsequent acidification with hydrochloric acid give tetra-acid 4 , which was cyclodehydrate at 200 \u00b0C under vacuum for 12 h to generate a 89% yield of 4,4\u2032-binaphthyl-1,1\u2032,8,8\u2032-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA). The chemical structure of the dianhydride (BTDA) was confirmed by FT-IR, 1 H NMR ( Fig.\u00a01 ). Wang has independently prepared this monomer utilizing the Ni(0) catalytic coupling of di- n -butyl-4-chloro-1,8-naphthalenedicarboxylate [45] . There was no report on the NMR data of BTDA in their paper. 2-(3\u2032,5\u2032-Diaminophenyl)benzimidazole (DAPBI) and 6,4\u2032-diamino-2-phenylbenzimidazole (BIA) were synthesized according to the reported procedures [46,47] . These monomers were pure enough for polymerization as confirmed by 1 H NMR spectra and elemental analyses. 3.2 Polymer syntheses As shown in Scheme 2 , the preparation of BTDA based SPIs were carried out by a one-step method in m -cresol in the presence of triethylamine (Et 3 N) and benzoic acid (catalyst), which has been employed for preparation of many other sulfonated polyimides in the literature [38] . ODADS was used to provide sulfonated sites along the copolymer backbone. The nonsulfonated diamines used in this study were DAPBI ( a ), BIA ( b ), and MPDA ( c ). The copolymers were denoted as Ia \u2212 x , Ib \u2212 x , and Ic \u2212 x , where x was the mole fraction of the monomer ODADS in the feed. For comparison purpose, NTDA-based SPI ( IIc \u2212 60) was also prepared. All copolyimides (in triethylammonium salt form) were completely soluble in m -cresol and DMSO, and form a flexible and tough film membrane by casting from the m -cresol solution. The obtained membranes were treated with 1.0 M sulfuric acid at room temperature for 4 days and washed with deionized water at room temperature for another 24 h. The inherent viscosity values of all copolymers were higher than 1.80 dL/g, which indicated successful copolymerization in producing high molecular weight copolymers. Fig.\u00a02 shows the FT-IR spectra of the SPI membranes. The typical absorption bands for naphthalene imido rings are found around 1705 cm \u22121 ( \u03bd sym C O), 1659 cm \u22121 ( \u03bd asym C O) and 1368 cm \u22121 ( \u03bd C\u2013N imide) for Ia \u2013c membranes, and 1710 cm \u22121 ( \u03bd sym C O), 1667 cm \u22121 ( \u03bd asym C O) and 1348 cm \u22121 ( \u03bd C\u2013N imide) for IIc \u2212 60 membrane, respectively. No peaks at 1780 cm \u22121 [corresponding to poly(amic acid)] was observed, and this suggested complete imidization of the SPI membranes. Furthermore, the bands around 1197 cm \u22121 , 1090 cm \u22121 and 1020 cm \u22121 were assigned to the stretching vibration (O S O) of sulfonic acid groups. 3.3 IEC, water uptake, and size changes Ion exchange capacity (IEC) of the copolymers synthesized was calculated from the molar ratio of sulfonated diamine to nonsulfonated diamine in feed, and also evaluated by means of titration. The method commonly used to determine IEC of sulfonated polymers involves the immersion in a 1 N NaCl solution of the membrane in the acid form. The membrane is converted to the sodium form by exchanging its H + ions with Na + from the solution. Then, the membrane is removed from solution, and the H + ions within the solution are titrated with 0.01 N NaOH solution using phenolphthalein as the indicator. The experimental IEC values of the membranes Ic and IIc fit well with the theoretical values. However, the IEC values of the copolymers containing benzimidazole groups, which were determined by the titration method, were much lower than the theoretical values. For example, soaking copolymer Ia \u2212 70 membrane in a 1 N NaCl solution, could exchange only 66.9% of the total amount of H + in its polymers. This observation implied that the acid protons of the copolymer are more difficult to exchange than for the other kind of sulfonated polyimides, probably because of the formation of an acid\u2013base complex between benzimidazole and the sulfonic acid groups of the copolymer. The same behavior was observed by Rozier and Mercier groups [48,49] . To overcome this uncompleted exchange problem, the membrane was kept\u00a0in the solution for titration. The IEC values measured from this method were in good agreement with the theoretical values. The water uptake and swelling ratio of copolymer membranes were determined by measuring the changes in the mass and size, respectively, before and after hydration. The data are reported in Table 1 . As expected, the water uptake increases with the increasing IEC. The water uptakes observed for copolymer Ia \u2212 x varied from 24\u201365% for IEC values varying from 1.26\u20132.55 meq/g, which were lower than that of Ic \u2212 x with a comparable IEC values. For example, copolymer Ia \u2212 80 (IEC = 2.26 meq/g) shows lower water uptake (55%) than Ic \u2212 70 (59%) (IEC = 2.15 meq/g), even though the IEC value of Ia \u2212 80 is higher than that of Ic \u2212 70. The difference of water uptake between Ia \u2212 80 and Ic \u2212 70 can be attributed to their difference in molecular structure. Both copolymers Ia \u2212 x and Ic \u2212 x have the same sulfonated diamine of ODADS. However, copolymers Ia \u2212 x contain pendant benzimidazole groups. The basic benzimidazole groups in the copolymers preferentially interact with sulfonic acid group and decrease the amount of free sulfonic acid group available to form hydrogen bond with water molecules. This enhanced intermolecular/intramolecular interactions in Ia \u2212 x copolymers consequently improved the dimensional stability of the membrane films. The results indicate that the basic benzimidazole is effective for retaining the dimensional stability in water especially for high IEC membranes. 3.4 Membrane stability toward water and oxidation The stability test of the copolymer membranes toward water was carried out by immersing the membranes into water at 90 \u00b0C and is justified by the loss of mechanical strength of the hydrated membranes. The criterion for the judgment of the loss of mechanical strength is that the membrane is broken after being lightly bent at 90 \u00b0C in water, or start to be broken into pieces under the test conditions. As shown in Table 2 , the copolyimide membranes based on BTDA display much better water stability than those of the copolyimides based on NTDA. The copolyimide membrane ( Ia \u2212 90), for example, did not lose mechanical properties after being soaked in hot water for 1000 h but the IIc \u2212 60 membranes became brittle at 4 h. Both Ic \u2212 x and IIc \u2212 x have the same sulfonated diamine and nonsulfonated diamine moieties but the different dianhydride units. However, Ic \u2212 x shows much better water stability than IIc \u2212 x . From this observation, it can be concluded that the enhanced hydrolytic stability of I series of copolyimides could be contributed to its unique binaphthalimide structure. Copolymer Ia \u2212 x had two carbonyl groups in the naphthyl groups whereas copolymer II \u2212 x had four carbonyl groups. Therefore, copolymer Ia \u2212 x should possess decreased positive charge density in carbonyl groups compared with copolymer IIc \u2212 60 because of the electron withdrawing characteristics of carbonyl groups. The quantum-chemical calculations also revealed that 4,4\u2032-binaphthyl-1,1\u2032,8,8\u2032-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA) has a lower affinity to the electron, i.e., 3.7790 vs 4.0102 eV, than NTDA [50] . In addition, the binaphthalimide groups are more hydrophobic than the naphthalimide groups due to the decreased density of the polar carbonyl groups in the binaphthalimide groups. The highly hydrophobic nature of the binaphthalene backbone resists the approach of water to a great extent and hence prevents the rapid attack of water; hence, increases the overall stability. In an accelerated hydrolytic stability testing, the polyimide ionomers were treated at 140 \u00b0C in water for 24 h, and the weight loss of the copolymers were determined. As listed in Table 2 , I series of polyimide ionomers showed a little weight loss whereas II series polyimide completely broke into pieces in the solution after the testing. The result further confirmed the excellent water stability of the copolyimides based on the BTDA dianhydride. The oxidative stabilities of the SPIs were investigated by measuring the elapsed times, when a membrane began to dissolve ( \u03c4 1 ), and a membrane was dissolved completely ( \u03c4 2 ) after immersion into Fenton's reagent of the 30 wt% H 2 O 2 containing 30 ppm FeSO 4 solution at room temperature. As listed in Table 2 , the SPI membranes with an IEC lower than 2.0 meq/g showed relatively good resistance to oxidation and endured without dissolving for 18 h, while membranes with higher IEC dissolved to some extent. The membranes Ia \u2212 x and Ic \u2212 x with the similar IEC values showed the similar oxidative stability. The results indicate that the oxidative degradation of these ionomers may occur on the main chains rather than the pendent benzimidazole groups. It is reasonable to consider that the oxidative attacks by HO and HOO radicals are electrophilic and occur more likely on the main chain aromatic rings bound with electron-donating ether groups [51,52] . 3.5 Thermal and mechanical properties The thermal stability of the SPIs was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig.\u00a03 , all the copolyimide membranes exhibited three-step degradation pattern. The first weight loss was observed around 100 \u00b0C. This weight loss is attributed to the loss of absorbed moisture by the hygroscopic sulfonic groups in the copolyimides. The second weight loss from 200 to 400 \u00b0C was closely associated with the thermal degradation of the sulfonic acid groups. The desulfonation temperatures increased with increase in the basic benzimidazole component. The sulfonic groups form polysalt with basic benzimidazole groups and this leads to the stabilization of the aromatic sulfonate groups, which might be the reason for increase in thermal stability in the second step. The mechanical properties of the SPI membranes are summarized in Table 3 . The stress\u2013strain data are shown in Fig.\u00a04 . The Ia \u2212 x and Ib \u2212 x membranes in the dry state had tensile stress at maximum load of 123.4\u2013150.4 MPa, Young's moduli of 0.86\u20131.67 GPa, and elongations at break of 24.7\u201350.2%. In the wet state, the samples showed excellent mechanical properties with tensile stress of 38.2\u201380.4 MPa and Young's moduli of 0.34\u20130.91 GPa. Especially, their elongations at break were up to 35.2\u201387.8%, which showed that they were very flexible materials. All SPI membranes showed the general trend of lower maximum stress for the higher IEC membranes. Comparison between the Ic \u2212 90 and Ic \u2212 60 membranes revealed that Ic \u2212 90 membrane based on BTDA is mechanically stronger than IIc \u2212 60 membrane from NTDA. It is assumed that the unique binaphthyl moieties restrict the molecular motion of the polymer chains resulting in stronger membranes. 3.6 Proton conductivity and methanol permeation properties Proton conductivities of the hydrated membranes were measured in the temperature range of 20\u201380 \u00b0C. The conductivity data are tabulated in Table 1 . Copolyimide Ia \u2212 x exhibited comparable proton conductivity with copolyimide Ib \u2212 x at a similar IEC. The proton conductivities of such benzimidazole based copolyimides were much lower than those of polyimides from NTDA, MPDA and the same sulfonated diamine of ODADS [38] . This can be attributed to the interchain interactions between the sulfonic acid groups and the benzimidazole groups. This kind of interaction decreases the amount of free sulfonic acid group available to release and transport protons. The decreased proton conductivity was also attributed to the low water uptakes of the benzimidazole based copolyimides. When Ic \u2212 90 and IIc \u2212 60 are compared, which have the same diamine moieties, but different dianhydride components, copolymer Ic \u2212 90 exhibited lower proton conductivity than copolymer IIc \u2212 60. The results indicate that the bulky binaphthalimide moieties in the copolymer interferes in the proton conductivity, probably due to its rigid and hydrophobic characters. However, the effect of the dianhydride structure on the conductivity is not pronounced between NTDA and BTDA based benzimidazole polyimides. The other factors such as morphology, interchain interaction may also affect the proton conductivity of the copolymers. Fig.\u00a05 shows the temperature dependence of the proton conductivity. All the membranes displayed increased proton conductivities with increasing temperature. BTDA\u2013ODADS/BAPBI (7/3) and BTDA\u2013ODADS/MPDA (7/3) displayed slightly lower proton conductivities than Nafion 117, whereas other copolyimide membranes showed fairly high proton conductivities, which were roughly comparable to that of Nafion 117. Table 1 lists the methanol transport behavior of the Ia \u2212 x and Ic \u2212 x membranes. The methanol permeability increased with increase in IEC values and water uptake. This indicated that methanol transport across the sulfonated polymer membranes was strongly dependent upon the water uptake content, and the methanol permeates through the membranes in complex forms such as CH 3 OH 2 + and H 3 O + [53] . The methanol permeability of the Ia \u2212 x membranes decreased with increasing DAPBI content. This can be interpreted by the formation of base\u2013acid complex between the sulfonic acid groups and benzimidazole groups. The formation of base\u2013acid complex reduces vacant space that absorbs free water molecules and induces a much denser structure to act as a methanol barrier. Moreover, the Ia \u2212 80 membrane, which has comparable proton conductivity to Nafion 117, shows nearly one order of magnitude lower methanol permeability than Nafion 117. 4 Conclusion 4,4\u2032-Binaphthyl-1,1\u2032,8,8\u2032-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA) and diamines containing benzimidazole moieties (BAPBI and BIA) were synthesized and used as comonomers to generate water stable copolymers for proton exchange membranes. The electrolyte properties of the synthesized polyimides were investigated and compared to those of polyimides based on 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTDA). The sulfonated polyimides based on BTDA exhibited much better water stability than those based on NTDA. Such improvement in the stability could be attributed to the low hydrolysis activity of the binaphthalimide moieties. The SPI membranes incorporated with basic benzimidazole groups showed the enhanced thermal and water stabilities at the expanse of some proton conductivity. Furthermore, the low methanol permeation was achieved by the introduction of the benzimidazole into the SPIs backbone.

        "abstract": "A series of sulfonated copolyimides containing pyrimidine groups (SPIs) were synthesized by random copolymerization of 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTDA), 2-(4-aminophenyl)-5-aminopyrimidine (PAPRM), and 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether-2,2'-disulfonic acid (ODADS). Proton exchange treatment in 1.0M sulfuric acid solution resulted in ionic cross-linking of the sulfonated copolymers due to the acid (sulfonic acid)-base (pyrimidine group) interactions and the membrane with more basic PAPRM moiety could absorb sulfuric acid to favor the proton transfer. The effects of the structure of the diamines on the properties of SPI membranes were evaluated by studying the membrane parameters including water uptake, proton conductivity, water stability, and methanol permeability. The basic pyrimidine groups introduced in the main chains could effectively resist membrane swelling due to the strong interchain interactions through basic pyrimidine groups and sulfonic acid groups. Compared with the corresponding uncross-linked copolyimides (NTDA/ODADS/ODA), the acid-base copolyimides displayed excellent water stability. The SPI membranes also exhibited improved mechanical properties and decreased methanol permeability. However, the cross-linked membranes showed lowered proton conductivities than the uncross-linked ones because a small part of the sulfonic acid groups had been consumed during the cross-linking process. \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd..",

Abstract This study investigates an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid that serves as the liquid electrolyte (LE) in a passive direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). The addition of an LE can reduce methanol crossover and increase the fuel utilization significantly. To improve the performance of an LE-DMFC, a mathematical model is developed to optimize the thicknesses of both the LE layer and the Nafion membrane. The maximum power density of the LE-DMFC is improved by approximately 30% compared with a conventional DMFC (C-DMFC) when each is fed by methanol solutions of the same concentration. Due to the low methanol crossover of the LE-DMFC, a highly concentrated methanol solution can be directly fed into the LE-DMFC. The discharge time and volume energy density of the LE-DMFC are two times longer and three times greater than those of the C-DMFC, respectively. In addition, fuel utilization increases by approximately 100%. Keywords Liquid electrolyte Passive direct methanol fuel cell Mathematical model Methanol crossover Highly concentrated methanol",

Stern-Volmer quenching constants and the binding constants of TH with oligo(dG-dC)-2 and oligo(dA-dT)-2 were calculated. These results suggest that TH prefers to bind with GC base sequences.

Keywords PtPd catalyst Formic acid electrooxidation Catalytic characteristics 1 Introduction The research on the electrocatalysts for formic acid electrooxidation (FAEO) is crucial for the development of direct formic acid fuel cell. In recent years, Pt based and Pd based catalysts have been extensively developed for FAEO [1\u20134] . It is accepted that FAEO on Pt catalyst proceeds through a \u201cdual path\u201d mechanism, involving the \u201cdirect path\u201d and \u201cindirect path\u201d. During the reaction, significant amounts of CO build up on the catalyst surface blocking the reaction active sites. However, on Pd catalyst, formic acid is oxidized to CO 2 via a direct path, which prevents the CO build-up on the catalyst surface. The combination of Pt and Pd, for the purpose of integrating the merits of each metal, may be a good way to increase the catalytic activity or stability for FAEO. Several preliminary works about the PtPd catalysts have been reported such as the effect of preparation methods, the bulk composition or the surface modification with single crystal Pt or Pd [2,5\u20139] . Because of the different mechanisms of Pt and Pd for FAEO, it is inferred that different surface compositions of PtPd catalysts should have different catalytic characteristics. In order to understand the catalytic characteristics of PtPd catalysts, three PtPd/C catalysts with different surface compositions were synthesized by different deposition sequences and characterized by the electrochemical and physical measurements. The catalysts were evaluated for FAEO and the catalytic behaviors were discussed by the oxidation pathway. The results are helpful in preparing of PtPd catalyst for direct formic acid fuel cell. 2 Experimental The PtPd/C catalysts with different surface compositions were prepared by conventional impregnation reduction method [10,11] . In brief, Pt + Pd catalyst was synthesized by a co-impregnation reduction method. Pt\u2013Pd and Pd\u2013Pt catalysts were synthesized by a stepwise impregnation reduction method; namely, after the Pt (Pd) was deposited on the carbon surface, the Pd (Pt) precursor was added and reduced onto the as-prepared Pt (Pd)/C surface. The nominal weight percentage of the metal (Pt and Pd) in the catalysts was 20% and the atomic ratio of Pd and Pt was close to 1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out using a Kratos XSAM-800 spectrometer with Mg K\u03b1 radiator. The electrochemical measurements were performed with an EG&G Model 273A potentiostat/galvanostat and a three-compartment electrochemical cell. A Pt plate and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. All the potentials were quoted against the Ag/AgCl electrode. The working electrode was a thin layer of Nafion impregnated catalyst on a glassy carbon disk [11] and the catalysts loading was 0.38 mg cm \u22122 . All electrochemical measurements were performed in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 solution with or without 0.5 M HCOOH deaerated by N 2 at the room temperature. The current density was normalized to the geometrical surface area of the glassy carbon disk (0.07 cm 2 ). 3 Results and discussion There were no obvious differences in the PtPd/C catalysts in the XRD patterns (not shown here) due to the similar atomic radii of Pt and Pd and the very small lattice mismatch of Pt and Pd (0.7%) [8,12] . The nanoparticle sizes of the three catalysts calculated according to the peak (220) by Debye\u2013Scherrer equation were mainly in the range of 4.8 to 5.3 nm. Fig.\u00a01 shows the XPS spectra of Pt 4f, Pd 3d and C 1s for the three PtPd/C catalysts. The peaks of the C 1s for the three PtPd catalysts were approximately 284.6 eV. The XPS spectra of Pt 4f and Pd 3d region were found to be composed of two pairs of doublets due to the present state of the metallic and oxidized forms [13,14] . For Pt + Pd catalyst, the peaks at 71.19 and 74.46 eV were ascribed to metallic Pt, whereas the peaks at 72.11 and 75.41 eV were assigned to Pt (II) species; the peaks at 335.57 and 340.83 eV were ascribed to metallic Pd, whereas the peaks at 336.10 and 341.44 eV were assigned to Pd (II) species. Similarly, for Pt\u2013Pd catalyst, the peaks at 70.70 and 74.05 eV were ascribed to metallic Pt, whereas the peaks at 71.36 and 74.68 eV were assigned to Pt (II) species; the peaks at 334.86 and 340.25 eV were ascribed to metallic Pd, whereas the peaks at 335.73 and 341.22 eV were assigned to Pd (II) species. For Pd\u2013Pt catalyst, the peaks at 70.49 and 73.69 eV were ascribed to metallic Pt, whereas the peaks at 71.02 and 74.70 eV were assigned to Pt (II) species; the peaks at 333.55 and 340.33 eV were ascribed to metallic Pd, whereas the peaks at 334.94 and 341.25 eV were assigned to Pd (II) species. It was evident that the peaks of the binding energy for Pt + Pd catalyst were shifted to higher binding energy values as compared to other two PtPd catalysts, indicating a strong interaction between the Pt and Pd [14] . The Pt was mainly in the form of Pt metal, but the Pd was mainly in the form of Pd oxide; it was due to that the Pd metal was easily oxidized to the form of Pd oxide (Pd 2+ ) at ambient conditions\u00a0 [14] . The atomic ratio of Pt:Pd was 1:1.21, 1:1.87 and 1:0.34 for Pt + Pd, Pt\u2013Pd and Pd\u2013Pt, respectively. The atomic ratio of Pt:Pd in the catalysts surface for Pt\u2013Pd and Pd\u2013Pt deviated from the nominal value of 1:1; it was due to the different deposition sequences of Pt and Pd. For the Pt\u2013Pd catalyst, the Pd was deposited onto the surface of as prepared Pt/C catalyst; For Pd\u2013Pt catalyst, the Pt was deposited onto the surface of as prepared Pd/C catalyst. This indicated that the Pt\u2013Pd catalyst or the Pd\u2013Pt catalyst would have a Pd-rich or a Pt-rich surface, respectively. The surface composition of the three PtPd/C catalysts obtained from XPS measurements was consistent with the expected PtPd surface composition. The hydrogen adsorption/desorption curves of the Pt black, Pd black and the PtPd catalysts are shown in Fig.\u00a02 . The potential value of hydrogen desorption peak for Pt black, Pd black, Pt + Pd, Pt\u2013Pd and Pd\u2013Pt catalysts was \u2212 0.148, \u22120.120, \u22120.165, \u22120.122 and \u2212 0.134 V, respectively. The hydrogen adsorption strength for Pt + Pd catalyst was obviously weakened. The reduction peak potential of the oxygen-containing species for Pt black and Pd black was 0.545 and 0.498 V, respectively; it was 0.528 V for Pt + Pd catalyst, which was between the potentials of 0.486 and 0.552 V for Pt\u2013Pd and Pd\u2013Pt catalysts. The CO ad stripping voltammograms of the catalysts are shown in Fig.\u00a03 . For Pt + Pd catalyst, the peak potential of CO ad oxidation was 0.65 V, which was negatively shifted by about 70 mV and 50 mV as compared to Pt\u2013Pd (0.72 V) and Pd\u2013Pt (0.70 V) catalysts, respectively. The electrochemical surface area of Pt + Pd catalyst estimated from CO ad stripping charge was the largest among the three catalysts. This was an indication that there was a larger synergistic effect between Pt and Pd, and it was helpful in weakening the CO adsorptive bond on the active sites. From the above discussion, it was evident that the PtPd catalysts with different surface compositions were successfully synthesized. Fig.\u00a04 shows the cyclic voltammograms for FAEO on the PtPd/C catalysts, Pt black and Pd black. For Pt black, there were three obvious oxidation peaks in the positive direction, which were attributed to the oxidation of hydrogen at \u2212 0.15 V, formic acid at 0.41 V and CO-intermediate at 0.70 V. In some research, it was proposed that the FAEO in the potential region of 0.2\u20130.6 V was via a direct path [15] . In fact, the current in that potential region was very small, and it may be due to the poisoning effect of the accumulation of CO-intermediate [16] . There was only one obvious peak on Pd black in the positive direction which was assigned to FAEO through the direct path. It was evident that Pd had much higher catalytic activity than Pt for FAEO. The peak current was an indication of the catalytic activity of the catalysts [3,4] . For Pt\u2013Pd catalyst, the peak current catalyzed by Pd was 26.7 mA cm \u22122 at 0.15 V; For Pd\u2013Pt catalyst, the peak current catalyzed by Pt was 14.4 mA cm \u22122 at 0.48 V. There were two formic acid oxidation peaks for Pt + Pd catalyst with the current of 11.3 mA cm \u22122 at 0.05 V catalyzed by Pd and 20.6 mA cm \u22122 at 0.41 V catalyzed by Pt, respectively. It was evident that the corresponding peak potential for FAEO on Pt + Pd catalyst was negatively shifted as compared with Pt\u2013Pd and Pd\u2013Pt catalysts. The catalytic characteristics of Pd\u2013Pt catalyst were similar to the Pt black in the positive scan direction. The oxidation region in the potential of 0.6\u20130.8 V was assigned to the oxidation of the CO-intermediate; the potential region of 0.2\u20130.6 V was attributed to FAEO catalyzed by Pt [17] . For Pd black and Pt\u2013Pd catalyst, a similar oxidation peak appeared in 0\u20130.3 V due to the FAEO through the direct pathway catalyzed by Pd. There was a CO-oxidation peak on the Pt\u2013Pd catalyst indicating the existence of an indirect oxidation path, but the current of FAEO catalyzed by Pt was not obvious in the potential region of 0.3\u20130.6 V. The oxidation behaviors on Pt + Pd catalyst between 0.2 and 0.6 V were similar to those of Pt black and Pd\u2013Pt catalyst; so it can be assigned to FAEO catalyzed by Pt. The oxidation region of \u2212 0.1 to 0.1 V for the Pt + Pd catalyst was much negatively shifted as compared to Pd black and Pt\u2013Pd catalyst, which was due to the FAEO catalyzed by Pd in the direct path. In the negative-scan direction, the catalytic characteristics of Pt\u2013Pd and Pd\u2013Pt were very interesting. There was a spike in the curve for the Pd\u2013Pt catalyst and the current was lower compared to other PtPd/C catalysts. The current oscillation behavior was not frequently observed for FAEO, so it was a surprise to observe the oscillation current on the Pt\u2013Pd catalyst. During the initial negative scan, the noble metals Pt and Pd in the catalyst should be in the state of metal oxide, and the metal oxides were gradually reduced with decreasing the potentials. The Pt\u2013Pd catalyst with different metal oxides or metal reduced states may possess different catalytic activities for FAEO, thereby leading to the current oscillation. According to the contributions of the different compositions in the catalyst to the catalytic activity, the potentials of 0.2 V and 0.4 V were chosen to compare the catalytic stability catalyzed by Pd and Pt, respectively. For Pt\u2013Pd catalyst, the current at 0.4 V was low, as was the Pd\u2013Pt catalyst at 0.2 V; therefore, it was insignificant to evaluate the catalytic activity at that potential. According to the similar contributions to the catalytic activity, the potential of 0.2 V was chosen to compare the catalytic stability catalyzed by Pd between Pt\u2013Pd and Pt + Pd catalysts, and 0.4 V was chosen to compare the catalytic stability catalyzed by Pt between the Pd\u2013Pt and Pt + Pd catalysts. The corresponding chronoamperometric curves of the PtPd catalysts are shown in Fig.\u00a05 . It was evident that the Pt + Pd catalyst had much higher stable current than that of the Pd\u2013Pt catalyst at 0.4 V and it was also more stable than that of the Pt\u2013Pd catalyst at 0.2 V. At 0.2 V, the contribution to current was mostly from Pd; the initial current of FAEO was high, but it was not stable even after about 1000 s. At 0.4 V, the contribution to current was mostly from Pt; a relative stable current was obtained after about 300 s. According to the above results, the FAEO at 0.4 V may mainly occur on the Pt surface via indirect path, and at 0.2 V it may mainly occur on the Pd surface through the direct path. Therefore, the introduction of Pt into Pd is helpful for the stability of FAEO. For the Pt + Pd catalyst, though the initial oxidation activity may reduce to some extent, the stability has been largely improved. 4 Conclusions Three PtPd/C catalysts with different surface compositions were successfully prepared and characterized by electrochemical experiments. Due to the large synergistic effect between Pt and Pd, the oxidation of hydrogen, CO ad and formic acid became much easier on the Pt + Pd catalyst. For the FAEO, especially in the negative scan direction, the three PtPd/C catalysts had different catalytic characteristics. The combination of Pt and Pd would cause a decrease in the initial catalytic activity, but the catalytic stability was largely increased for FAEO.

        "abstract": "A simple, environment-friendly and aqueous-route colloidal-precipitation method is successfully employed to prepare carbon supported platinum nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. In this method, (NH 4) 2WO 4 is used to react with H 2PtCl 6, which forms the (NH 4) 2PtCl 6 and H 2WO 4 simultaneously. The precipitation of (NH 4) 2PtCl 6 and the colloidal of H 2WO 4 can protect the formation of the Pt nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrates that the Pt nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution are well dispersed on the carbon support. More importantly, the size of the Pt nanoparticles can be simply controlled by tuning the concentration of (NH 4) 2WO 4 and the Pt nanoparticles prepared in the 0.5 mmol L -1 (NH 4) 2WO 4 exhibit the smallest size of ca. 3 nm. Further, cyclic voltammetric and chronoamperometric experiments show that the prepared Pt/C catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity and stability compared with the Pt/C prepared by impregnation method and the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C. For example, the peak current and the stable current at 3600 s of the Pt/C catalyst prepared with the 0.5 mmol L -1 (NH 4) 2WO 4 is about 1.24 and 1.78 times of the commercial Pt/C. Therefore, the as-proposed colloidal-precipitation method exhibits a potential application in preparing highly dispersive and electroactive Pt/C catalysts for direct methanol fuel cells. Highlights: Colloidal-precipitation method was explored to prepare Pt/C. The prepared Pt nanoparticles dispersed well and had a narrow size distribution. Particle size of the Pt can be well controlled. The Pt/C showed enhanced activity and stability for methanol electrooxidation. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Electrochemical H2S sensor with H2SO4 pre-treated Nafion membrane as solid polymer electrolyte",
        "abstract": "It is reported for the first time that the performance of the electrochemical H 2 S sensor with the Nafion membrane pre-treated with the concentrated H 2 SO 4 as the solid electrolyte is much more stable than that for the sensor with the Nafion membrane without H 2 SO 4 pre-treatment. The sensitivity of the sensor is about 2.92 \u03bcA/ppm. The response time of the sensor is about 9 s. The detection limit is about 0.1 ppm. Therefore, this kind of the electrochemical H 2 S gas sensor may be desirable for the practical application. Keywords Hydrogen sulfide Solid electrolyte Electrochemical oxidation Gas sensor 1 Introduction It is well known that H 2 S is a very toxic gas. Even at a low concentration level, it can lead to personal distress. At the high concentration, it can result in loss of consciousness, permanent brain damage and even death [1] . Although a number of techniques have been established for the determination of H 2 S, new advanced methods with high sensitivity, fast response, easy operation and at low cost are still desirable. There have been a number of reports on electrochemical H 2 S sensors [2,3] . Recently, the electrochemical H 2 S sensors with the fixed potential mode are commonly used. This kind of sensors usually uses the liquid electrolytes. Thus, they are usually rather bulky and easy to be dried. Moreover, the leakage of the electrolytes may corrode parts of the devices and, thus, impair its functions [4] . Therefore, the research toward the development of the electrochemical gas sensors with the solid-state electrolyte is in progress. At present, the most common solid polymer electrolyte investigated for the electrochemical solid-state gas sensors is the membrane of copolymer of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) and poly(sulphonylfluoride vinyl ether) manufactured by Dupont Co., USA and known under the commercial name Nafion membrane. Although Nafion membrane possesses some extraordinary properties, its ion conductivity is strongly dependent on the amount of water contained in the membrane [5] . Therefore, the response of an electrochemical solid-state gas sensor with Nafion membrane strongly depends on the relative humidity of the sample [6] , this kind of sensor is easy to be completely dried so that it loses its efficiency. In order to overcome this problem, some sensor designs employ Nafion membrane to contact with a water phase to maintain the water content constant. This method is only a partial solution to the problem because the need for a liquid electrolyte limits the range of applicability of the sensor and can complicate attempts at miniaturizing it [7] . In this paper, the electrochemical solid-state H 2 S sensor with the solid electrolyte of the Nafion membrane pre-treated with the concentrated H 2 SO 4 solution was reported for the first time. It was found that it showed a fast response, high sensitivity and good stability. 2 Experimental Nafion 117 membrane was purchased from Dupont Co., USA. The Teflon emulsion is from Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, PR China. The H 2 S gas source was provided by Guangming Co., Dalian, PR China. All other chemicals are reagent grade. Different concentrations of H 2 S gases were obtained by mixing standards hydrogen sulfide gases with pure nitrogen with the aid of mass flow controllers (Beijing, PR China). Electrochemical impedance spectra were carried out using a Solartron 1255B FRA coupled to 1287 electrochemical interface (frequency range: 10 6 to 10 \u22121 Hz). The open circuit potential was set as 0.000 V, and amplitude was 5 mV. All the solutions were prepared with the double distilled water. The electrochemical measurements were carried out with the potentiostat (CHI 602 Mode, CHI Co. USA) and the traditional three-electrode cell. The working electrode was made with sealing in soft glass a Au wire of 2 mm diameter. The auxiliary electrode is a platinum wire. The reference electrode was the saturated calomel electrode (SCE). The potentials reported in the electrochemical experiments are all referred to SCE. The cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out in the 0.5 mol/l H 2 SO 4 solution. Oxygen was removed from the solution by bubbling N 2 for 20 min. The structure of the electrochemical H 2 S gas sensors is shown in Fig. 1 . The working electrode was made from colloidal Au solution obtained with reacting HAuCl 4 with a mixture of sodium citrate and 60% PTFE emulsion. The colloidal Au solution was then sprayed on a clean porous Teflon sheet (the porosity is 60%) and dried under an infrared lamp obtaining the Au working electrode. The electrode was immersed in acetone overnight to remove the surfactant contained in PTFE emulsion. Then, it was sintered at 200 \u00b0C to improve its stability. The apparent area of the Au working electrode is 3.14 cm 2 . The Au loading of the working electrode is 5 mg/cm 2 . Both the structures of the auxiliary and the reference electrodes are almost the same as the working electrode, except that the Pt was used as the eletrocatalyst instead of Au. Both the electrodes had Pt loading of 10 mg/cm 2 . Finally, 1\u20132 \u03bcl of 2.5% Nafion solution was sprayed on the surface of the catalyst layer of the electrodes. Then the electrodes and the Nafion 117 membrane were pressed to form the Nafion-electrode assembly. When facing the air, the potential of the reference electrode is sufficiently stable for sensor operation (1.0\u00b10.01 V). The potentials of the H 2 S sensor reported below are all referred to the Pt air electrode. The solid electrolyte is the Nafion membrane pre-treated without or with H 2 SO 4 for 24 h. All the measurements were performed at 23\u00b12 \u00b0C. 3 Results and discussion Since Pt is very active for many gases, in view of the selectivity of the sensor, the Au catalyst has been selected as working electrodes. Fig. 2 shows the cyclic voltammogram obtained for hydrogen sulfide at the smooth Au electrode in the deaerated 0.5 mol/l H 2 SO 4 solution in the potential range of 0\u20131.5 V (curve a) compared with a blank that obtained without hydrogen sulfide (curve b). It can be seen in curve a that there are three oxidation peaks ( E p =0.29, 1.2 and 1.4 V). Compared with curve a, the three oxidation peaks are attributed to the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide. The possible oxidation reactions of hydrogen sulfide at the smooth Au electrode are as follows [9] : (1) H 2 S \u2192 S +2 H + +2e (2) H 2 S +2 H 2 O \u2192 SO 2 +6 H + +6e (3) H 2 S +4 H 2 O \u2192 SO 4 2\u2212 +10 H + +8e The appearance of a sulfur layer on the surface of the electrode due to reaction (1) decreases the activity of the electrode and in turn reduces the magnitude of the output signal of the sensor. Fig. 3 is the polarization curves of N 2 without (curve b) and with 91 ppm H 2 S (curve a), respectively, at the Au working electrode of the sensor with the Nafion membrane pre-treated with 50% H 2 SO 4 . It can be seen from Fig. 3 , curve a that the oxidation current of H 2 S begins to increase from 0.04 V and reaches a current plateau between 0.18 and 0.28 V. When the potential is >0.28 V, the oxidation current increases very rapidly. In the plateau potential region, the oxidation of H 2 S is controlled with the mass transfer of H 2 S through the working electrode [8] . Therefore, the limiting current produced in this region can be used to quantify the H 2 S concentration. In addition, according to the cyclic voltamogram of H 2 S at the Au electrode, the potential region of 0.18\u20130.28 V is related to the second anodic peak. When the potential is >0.28 V, Au begins to be oxidized and, thus, the oxidation current at the potential >0.28 V is due to both H 2 S and Au oxidation [9,10] . If the controlled potential is selected as low as in the potential region of the first anode peak, the oxidation product is S, which would deposit on the surface of the Au catalyst, leading the Au catalyst to be poisoned. Therefore, the potential of the working electrode in the sensor for the H 2 S measurement was selected in the potential region of 0.18\u20130.28, such as 0.2 V. Fig. 4 shows the effect of the flow rate of N 2 with 91 ppm H 2 S on the response current of the sensor with the Nafion membrane pre-treated with 50% H 2 SO 4 . The results indicated that the current increases when the flow rate is <500 ml/min. When the flow rate is >500 ml/min, the response current is kept constant. Therefore, for the H 2 S determinations, 550 ml/min flow rate was used. Figs. 5 and 6 show the typical current\u2013time response for the sensors with the Nafion membranes pre-treated with 50% H 2 SO 4 and without H 2 SO 4 pre-treatment, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that after a fairly long time (about 660 s), the response signal does not decreased for the sensor with the Nafion membrane pre-treated with 50% H 2 SO 4 . The constant current was found to be reproducible within \u00b13%. However, the response decreases with the time for the sensor with the Nafion membrane without H 2 SO 4 pre-treatment. The current decreases to 24% of the initial value after 400 s ( Fig. 6 ). The results may be attributed to that H 2 SO 4 pre-treated Nafion membrane can preserve a certain amount of water, while the Nafion membrane without H 2 SO 4 pre-treatment is easy to loss water, leading the decrease of the response current. In addition, it can seen from Fig. 5 that the residual current is as low as 0.1 \u03bcA and the response time, T 90 is about 9 s for the sensor with H 2 SO 4 pre-treated Nafion membrane. Fig. 7 shows the dependence of the response signal on the H 2 S concentration for the sensor with the Nafion membrane pre-treated with 50% H 2 SO 4 . The linear relationship was obtained between the response signal on the H 2 S concentration in the concentration range from 0.1 to 100 ppm. The sensitivity, namely, the slope of linear relationship is 2.92 \u03bcA/ppm. Its linearly dependent coefficient is 0.9956. Fig. 8 shows the relationship between the response current and temperature for the sensor with the Nafion membrane pre-treated with 50% H 2 SO 4 . It can be seen that the response decreases with increasing temperature. In theory, under the measurement conditions, the oxidation of H 2 S is controlled with the mass transfer of H 2 S through the porous working electrode. Increasing temperature will increase the diffusion coefficient of H 2 S and furthermore increase the response current. However, the response current is also related to the ion conductivity of the Nafion membrane, which is strongly dependent on the amount of water in the Nafion membrane. Because the water content fluctuates with the humidity of the surrounding medium [4] , increasing the temperature reduces the amount of water in the Nafion membrane. Therefore, the response current of the sensor may decrease with increasing temperature. However, over the range between 25 and 59 \u00b0C, the response current decreases only to 5% of the initial value. The temperature coefficient is 0.1%/\u00b0C. Fig. 9 shows the ac impedence curves of Nafion membranes which were pre-treated with 0 (curve 1), 10 (curve 2), 30 (curve 3), 50% H 2 SO 4 (curve 4) and then stored for one week at room temperature. The results show that the ion conductivity and, in turn, the water-preserving ability of these four kinds of Nafion membranes increases with increasing the concentration of H 2 SO 4 used for the pre-treatment of Nafion membrane. It can be attributed to that after Nafion membrane is pre-treated with H 2 SO 4 , the acid molecule can be contained in the membrane. In turn, the high concentration of H 2 SO 4 possesses high water-preserving ability [11] . In order to study the quantity of water retained by the membrane, an experiment was carried out as follows. Two pieces of Nafion membrane were immersed in 50% H 2 SO 4 solution and water, respectively, for 24 h. The membranes were then removed from the solution and filter paper was used to remove any excess H 2 SO 4 solution or water from its surfaces. After the membrane was placed in the air for 3 days and, weighed, it was found that the weight of the membrane pre-treated with 50% H 2 SO 4 changes little bit, while the membrane without H 2 SO 4 pre-treatment loses 17% of the initial weight only after 1 day. It indicated that the water-preserving ability of the membrane with H 2 SO 4 pre-treatment is much better than that without H 2 SO 4 pre-treatment. The selectivity is also important for the sensor. According to the literature [12] , the electrochemical oxidation of CO at the Au electrode is 100\u20131000 times slower than that at the Pt electrode at 0\u20130.5 V. The NO oxidation reaction at the Au electrode does not occur at potentials below about 0 V and reach limit current at potentials above 0.3 V. NO 2 can be electrochemical reduced at potentials about \u22120.2 V. O 2 can be reduced at potentials below \u22120.4 V. Thus, CO and O 2 can not cause any interference and NO and NO 2 cause a little interferences to the determination of H 2 S with the Au working electrode at 0.2 V. However, SO 2 can be oxidation at \u22120.1 V at the Au electrode [13] . Therefore, it is necessary to use a selective adsorbent to remove SO 2 interference. The data of the response current of the sensor with the Au working electrode and Nafion membrane pre-treated with 50% H 2 SO 4 for different gases is shown in Table 1 . Thus, the above conclusion was demonstrated with our experimental datum. Fig. 10 shows the long-term stability of the H 2 S sensor with Nafion membrane pre-treated with 50% H 2 SO 4 . The results indicated that after intermittent measurements for 50 days, the performance of the H 2 S sensor with the Nafion membrane pre-treated with 50% H 2 SO 4 decreases slightly. However, for the H 2 S sensor with the Nafion membrane without H 2 SO 4 pre-treatment, after few days, it has lost its efficiency. 4 Conclusion The above results demonstrated that the performance of the electrochemical H 2 S sensor with the Nafion membrane pre-treated with 50% H 2 SO 4 is much more stable than that for the sensor with the Nafion membrane without H 2 SO 4 pre-treatment. It is due to that after Nafion membrane is pre-treated with the concentrated H 2 SO 4 , the water-preserving ability of the membrane is increased. Therefore, the electrochemical H 2 S sensor with the Nafion membrane pre-treated with 50% H 2 SO 4 as the solid electrolyte may be desirable for the practical application.

        "abstract": "Polypyrrole (Ppy) was successfully introduced into methyl substituted sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) membranes by polymerization in SPEEK solutions to improve their methanol resistance. Uniform polypyrrole (Ppy) distributed composite membranes were formed by this method by the interaction between SPEEK and Ppy. The properties of the composite membranes were characterized in detail. The composite membranes show very good proton conductive capability (25 \u00b0C: 0.05\u20130.06 s cm \u22121 ) and good methanol resistance (25 \u00b0C: 5.3 \u00d7 10 \u22127 \u20131.1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 cm 2 s \u22121 ).The methanol diffusion coefficients of composite membranes are much lower than that of pure SPEEK membranes (1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 cm 2 s \u22121 ). The composite membranes show very good potential usage in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). Keywords SPEEK Ppy DMFC Proton exchange membranes 1 Introduction The direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) is a type of fuel cell, which is potentially suitable for applications in automobiles (cars, trucks and buses) or portable applications (cell phones and laptops) because of its simple fueling (easy storage of methanol, no reformer required), low emissions and low operating temperatures [1,2] . Some applications for DMFCs also include distributed power for both stationary and dynamic applications where they could replace batteries. Each application shares a common goal of high fuel efficiency, non-polluting by-products and economical proton exchange membranes. The proton exchange membrane material is a key component of the PEMFC for transferring protons from the anode to the cathode as well as providing a barrier to fuel crossover between the electrodes. The membranes traditionally used in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) are perfluorosulfonic polymers, such as Nafion \u00ae . Although they show superior performance in fuel cells, their high cost and high methanol crossover make them impractical for large-scale production [3,4] . Therefore, alternative membrane materials such as sulfonated poly(aryl ether ketone)s (SPAEK) [5] , sulfonated poly(aryl ether sulfone)s (SPAES) [6] and sulfonated poly(imide) (SPI) [7] , etc. are being widely studied. In our previous work, SPAEK was developed for proton exchange membranes [8\u201310] . Although it showed relatively good properties for fuel cells, the brittleness of the membranes at elevated temperatures and the relatively high methanol permeability in the membranes with high sulfonation have limited their usage. For the DMFC, a high methanol permeability rate across the proton exchange membranes poses a critical problem in reducing the practical use of a DMFC. There have been many attempts to reduce the methanol permeability through the proton exchange membranes, which are: (1) modify the membranes\u2019 surface to block methanol transport, (2) control the size of the transport channels of protons, (3) explore new types of membrane materials, etc. Recently developed acid\u2013base composite membranes were widely used to solve this problem. Especially the blend of sulfonated polymers with polymers containing amine groups was confirmed to be an efficient strategy to improve the mechanical and methanol crossover properties. In our previous work, polyaniline (PANI) was introduced into sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone ketone) (SPEEKK) membranes to solve this problem. Although the membranes showed good properties, the poor solubility of PANI has limited further research [11] . Polypyrrole (Ppy) nano-structured particles have received considerable attention as they have many potential applications in catalysis, chromatography and controlled release of drugs and in pigment applications. The Ppy/sulfonated polymers composite membranes were widely investigated due to the special interaction between the sulfonated acid groups and amine groups [12\u201316] . The interaction can lead to the following results [12,13] : (1) The interaction will lead to the compatibility of the blending polymers. This will lead toreduction of swelling, improvement of mechanical properties and a further decrease in the methanol crossover of membranes. (2) Mixing of acidic and basic molecules generally form a protonically conductive pathway. Blending with amine polymers will lead to the formation of proton transport channels from the protonated-amine groups to the sulfonated groups, when the membranes are hydrated. Nafion/Ppy membranes prepared by Xu et al. showed some prospect for DMFC use [14] . They showed that the introduction of Ppy particles into Nafion membranes could efficiently decrease methanol permeability [14] . Later Pickup and co-workers did the similar work [15] . During the preparation of the composite membranes (the Ppy was introduced into Nafion by situ polymerization in Nafion membranes), the content of Ppy in the membranes cannot be efficiently controlled, due to the limitation of the monomer (pyrrole monomer) uptake by the membranes. Although much work on the Ppy composite membranes was carried out, poor solubility of Ppy is still a great difficulty to overcome in the preparation of the composite membranes. In this paper, we will report on a new method to form uniformly distributed SPEEK/Ppy composite membranes to improve the methanol resistance of the membranes. In this method, we first make the pyrrole monomer uniformly dispersed in the SPEEK solutions by making use of the interaction between them. Further we obtain uniform Ppy distributed composite membranes by polymerization in the SPEEK solutions. This can efficiently control the Ppy content in SPEEK membranes. The purpose of introducing the Ppy particles into SPEEK membranes is to improve the methanol resistance of the SPEEK membranes with high sulfonation. The properties of the membranes is studied in detail. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and reagents SPEEK polymers were prepared by direct aromatic nucleophilic substitution step polymerization. The detailed synthesis procedure and characterization of these copolymers were reported previously [8\u201310] . The ion exchange capacity (IEC) of SPEEK used in this paper is: 1.92 meq g \u22121 . The structure of SPEEK is shown in Scheme 1 , which contains four methyl groups for each SPEEK unit. 2.2 The preparation of the composite membranes The composite membranes were prepared by the polymerization of pyrrole monomer in SPEEK solutions. Firstly, a fixed weight ratio of pyrrole monomer and SPEEK polymers were dissolved in DMF solutions, stirred about 1 h, then 30 wt.% H 2 O 2 (equal to the amount of the pyrrole monomer) was slowly added, stirred for another 4 h, the whole process was carried out at room temperature. The resulting solutions were then cast onto glass plates, dried at 80 \u00b0C for about 24 h, to obtain 50\u2013100 \u03bcm thick membranes. 2.3 The characterization of membranes TGA measurements were performed on NETZSCH STA449C under N 2 at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . FTIR and UV spectra were obtained by a Bruker Vector-22 FTIR spectrometer and a SHIMADZU-UV2501. All the measurements were carried out on the membranes. The surface morphology of the composite membranes was observed by SEM (SHIMADZU SSX-550). The membranes were gold-coated prior to SEM measurements. The water uptake ( S w ) of the membranes was calculated by setting the weight difference between the dry and swollen membranes. The dried membranes were weighed (mass dry ) and then soaked in water until the weight remained constant. Then they were wiped with blotting paper. The weight (mass wet ) of the wet membranes was quickly weighed again. The water uptake of membranes ( S w ) was calculated with formula (1) : (1) S w = mas s wet \u2212 mas s dry mas s dry \u00d7 100 % The number of water molecules per sulfonic site ( \u03bb ) can be determined by formula (2) : (2) \u03bb = mas s wet \u2212 mas s dry / M H 2 O IEC \u22c5 mas s dry The ion exchange capacity (IEC) of the membranes was determined by titration at room temperature. The membranes in the acidic forms (H + ) were converted to the sodium forms by immersing the membranes in 1 M NaCl solutions for 24 h to exchange the H + ions for Na + ions. The exchanged H + ions within the solutions were titrated with 0.01N NaOH solutions. The water desorption measurement was made by a Pyris 1TGA (Perkin-Elmer) at 80 \u00b0C and at constant pressure. The Pyris 1TGA was used to determine the weight changes of the samples with time. The methanol diffusion coefficient was determined by using a cell basically consisting of two half-cells separated by the membrane, which was fixed between two rubber rings. Methanol 1 M was placed on one side of the diffusion cell and water was placed on the other side. Magnetic stirrers were used on each compartment to ensure uniformity. The concentration of the methanol was measured by using a SHIMADU GC-8A chromatograph. Peak areas were converted into methanol concentration with a calibration curve. The methanol diffusion coefficient was calculated according to ref. [17] .The measurement of proton conductivity of the membranes was carried out by using a Philips 1260 impedance/gain-phase analyzer over a frequency range of 10 Hz\u20131 MHz. Conductivity measurement of fully hydrated membranes was carried out with the cell immersed in liquid water. The proton conductivity was determined with the test cell similar to the one employed by Zawodzinski et al. [18] . Cell performance was evaluated by using a DMFC unit cell, and the catalysts used at the anode and the cathode were Pt-Ru/C and Pt/C, respectively. The catalyst loadings at the anode and the cathode based on the catalyst weight were 2.5 mg cm \u22122 . Two molar methanol at the cathode, was supplied by a Masterflex liquid micro-pump at a rate of 0.082 L min \u22121 , while the cathode was fed with dry O 2 at a rate of 2 L min \u22121 via a flow meter. The cell temperature was kept at 70 \u00b0C. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Membrane preparation and characterization The SPEEK/Ppy composite membranes were prepared by polymerization in SPEEK solutions ( Scheme 2 ). Due to the interaction between the sulfonated acid groups in SPEEK and the amine groups in pyrrole monomers, the pyrrole monomers dispersed uniformly in the SPEEK solutions. After the oxidants were added to the solutions, Ppy was formed uniformly within the SPEEK solutions. The solutions were cast onto a glass plates to obtain the SPEEK/Ppy composite membranes. In this paper, the membranes obtained with different weight ratios of the pyrrole monomer to SPEEK (5, 10 and 15%), are named SPEEK/Ppy-1, SPEEK/Ppy-2 and SPEEK/Ppy-3, respectively. FTIR and UV spectra were performed on the composite membranes to confirm the expected structures of the composite membranes ( Fig. 1 ). The C C stretching of the benzene ring appears at 1500\u20131400 cm \u22121 . The peaks at 1270 and 1654 cm \u22121 are induced by C N and C N stretching, respectively. As shown in SPEEK, there are no related stretchings with C N and C N groups. Although the composite membranes are similar in band pattern, the intensity of the C N and C N absorption is different. With increasing content of Ppy, the intensity of the absorption increases, which confirms the trend of the weight ratio of Ppy in SPEEK membranes. The absorption bands at 1089 and 1026 cm \u22121 in the composite membranes can be assigned to asymmetric and symmetric O S O stretching vibrations of the sulfonated groups. However, the related vibrations for the sulfonated groups in SPEEK are shown at 1080 and 1014 cm \u22121 . The absorption of the sulfonated groups in the SPEEK/Ppy composite membranes showed a blue shift compared to SPEEK. The blue shift is induced by the interaction between SPEEK and Ppy. The UV\u2013vis spectra of the SPEEKK/Ppy composite membranes are shown in Fig. 2 . All the membranes show absorption peaks at 250\u2013280, 360 and 500 nm. The absorptions at 250\u2013280 and 360 nm correspond to the stretching of the benzene and pyrrole rings. The intense absorption at 500 nm may be due to the antibipolaron to bipolaron band transition of Ppy [19] . The FTIR and UV results show that we have successfully introduced the Ppy particles into SPEEK membranes. 3.2 The morphology of the composite membranes The distribution of the Ppy particles in the SPEEK membranes has a great influence on their transport properties. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to study the morphology of the composite membranes. As shown in Fig. 3 , the nano-Ppy particles were dispersed in the SPEEK membranes very uniformly. The morphology of the Ppy particles is indicated to be nano-spheres. With the weight ratio of the pyrrole monomer increasing, the intensity of the Ppy particles in the SPEEK matrix increases. When the weight ratio of the pyrrole monomer is kept at 5 and 10% the Ppy particles were well distributed in theSPEEK matrix and seldom aggregated, however, the Ppy particles partially aggregated when the ratio reached 15%. The Ppy particles prepared by us distribute more uniformly in the SPEEK membranes than the ones prepared by the normal method. The interaction between the sulfonic acid groups and amine groups plays a very important role in the dispersion of the Ppy particles in the SPEEK matrix. As reported by Lee [20,21] , this phenomenon might lead increase of the electrical conductivity and mechanical strength by inducing electrostatic interactions between Ppy and SPEEK. As shown in Fig. 3 , the SPEEK matrix may be a continuous phase and the Ppy is the dispersed phase, the network of Ppy conducting granular aggregates in the SPEEK matrix is well formed [21,22] . In addition, we expect from the spheres that are on the surface that the regions that circles marked in Fig. 3 (a 2 and b 2 ) show many Ppy spheres are embedded in the membranes. Note that all the membranes have been immersed in water for about 48 h before the SEM test, which indicates that the Ppy particles are stable in the SPEEK membranes under full hydrated conditions. 3.3 The thermal stability of membranes Fig. 4 shows the TG curves of SPEEK and its composite membranes. All the curves show very similar profiles. They all contain two weight loss steps. The first one at about 250\u2013300 \u00b0C is attributed to the splitting-off of the sulfonic acid groups of SPEEK. The second weight loss step at about 450 \u00b0C corresponds to the decomposition of the main polymer chain [5] . The membranes are all stable at about 300 \u00b0C, which is good enough for proton exchange membranes. Although the membranes show similar profiles of TG curves, the temperatures corresponding to the onset of thermal degradation and the slope of mass loss are different. Compared to the SPEEK membranes, the composite membranes have relatively high onset temperatures. In addition, SPEEK lost about 45 wt.% at 600 \u00b0C after thermal decomposition, while the SPEEK/Ppy composite membranes lost only about 30% at the same temperature. TGA results provide information about the changes in the thermal stability as a result of the incorporation of the Ppy particles into the clusters of SPEEK. The restriction of the cluster's mobility caused by the intermolecular interaction between SPEEK and Ppy seems to contribute the thermal stability of the composite membranes [17,26] . 3.4 Water uptake, water desorption and IEC of composite membranes Water uptake and IEC of SPEEK and its composite membranes are shown in Table 1 . The water uptake of SPEEK/Ppy decreases drastically after the addition of Ppy particles into SPEEK. The water uptake of SPEEK is 44%, whereas, SPEEK/Ppy composite membranes show the water uptake of 31.1, 30.8 and 30.4%, respectively, with the weight content of Ppy increasing from 5 to 15%. Moreover, the IEC of the composite membranes shows a similar trend. This can be considered as the incorporation of nano-sized polypyrrole particles into the SPEEK matrix, resulting into the restricted mobility of the ionic clusters [17] . The interaction between the SPEEK and Ppy makes the structure of membranes more compact and partially sulfonated groups cannot participate in the proton exchange process. However, the number of water molecules per sulfonic site in Table 1 increases with the Ppy content increasing in composite membranes [26] . The interaction between the SPEEK and Ppy prevents partially sulfonated groups from absorbing water molecules. Water desorption isotherms of SPEEKK and its composite membranes are shown in Fig. 5 . The relationship between the water desorption and time may follow Fick diffusion laws [23] . The desorption isotherm in Fig. 5 a shows that water in composite membranes evaporates more slowly than SPEEKK membranes, which may result from the interaction between the SPEEK and Ppy. The line between the M t / M \u221e and t 1/2 of SPEEKK is shown in Fig. 5 b. The water diffusion of SPEEK and its composite membranes calculated from the slope of the line is 5.4 \u00d7 10 \u22129 , 2.23 \u00d7 10 \u22129 , 6.7 \u00d7 10 \u221210 and 3.1 \u00d7 10 \u221210 m 2 s \u22121 , respectively. From the results, the velocity of water volatilization decreases with increasing content of Ppy particles. In another words, the water retention of the composite membranes at relative high temperatures is improved by the introduction of the Ppy particles. 3.5 Methanol permeability and proton conductivity Methanol permeability and proton conductivity are the two transport properties which determine the cell performance in a DMFC. A good performance needs high proton conductivity and low methanol permeability. The methanol permeability of SPEEK and its composite membranes is shown in Table 1 . The methanol permeability of the composite membranes decreases dramatically compared to the SPEEK membranes. With the content of Ppy increasing, the methanol permeability decreases. The pure SPEEK membrane shows the methanol diffusion coefficient of 1.57 \u00d7 10 \u22126 cm 2 s \u22121 at room temperature, whereas, the composite membranes, which contain 5, 10 and 15 wt.% of Ppy particles show the coefficient of 1.15 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 7.47 \u00d7 10 \u22127 and 5.31 \u00d7 10 \u22127 cm 2 s \u22121 , respectively. Usually the transport phenomenon through the membrane is influenced by kinetic and equilibrium factors. Porous membranes can be affected by kinetic factors rather than equilibrium factors. The transport properties of porous membranes are mainly influenced by bulk water in the pores [24] . SPEEK membranes, which are non-porous membranes, however, have different transport properties due to the compact and smooth surface without pores. In the same manner, the composite membranes also have dense structures due to the compatibility between the SPEEK matrix and Ppy. The interaction between the SPEEK and Ppy makes for more compact structures of the composite membranes, which will lead to low methanol permeability of membranes. The proton conductivity of SPEEK and its composite membranes at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 6 . The proton conductivity of all the membranes was higher than 10 \u22122 s cm \u22121 , which is the lowest value for practical interest in fuel cells. With the content of Ppy increasing, the proton conductivity of the membranes shows a contrary tendency. The decreasing of the proton conductivity is mainly influenced by the introduction of nano-sized Ppy particles into the SPEEK matrix. Traditionally proton exchange membranes usually contain two dominant regions: hydrophilic and hydrophobic ones. The hydrophobic domains formed by non-sulfonated polymer segments provide the hydrated PEMs with mechanical strength whereas the hydrophilic domains contain sulfonated groups which ensure proton conductivity. The existence of the two regions may lead to a microphase-separated structure, which will determine the proton conductivity of the membranes [4] . The introduction of Ppy particles in SPEEK membranes will lead to more dense structures of membranes due to the interaction between them [26] . Compared to SPEEK membranes, the composite membranes show a less phase-separated structure. The mobility of the ionic clusters in the composite membranes will be more restricted, which will lead to a low proton conductive ability of the composite membranes. It is interesting to find that a SPEEK/Ppy-1 membrane shows similar even higher proton conductivity when the temperature exceeds 60 \u00b0C. This phenomenon may be explained by the interaction between the SPEEK and Ppy as well. The interaction can lead to effective proton-conducting pathways and a further increase in the membrane proton conductivity under fully hydrated conditions [25] . So in this system, there are two factors that influence the proton conductivity of the composite membranes. On the one hand, the introduction of the Ppy makes for a more compact membrane which will lead to decreased results and on the other hand, the interaction between the sulfonated acid groups and amine groups can form transport channels from the protonated-amine groups to the sulfonated groups, which will result in increased proton conductivity ( Scheme 2 ). The two factors will determine the overall proton conductivity of the composite membranes. 3.6 Fuel cell performance of composite membranes Fig. 7 shows the polarization curves of the SPEEK and its composite membranes. All the membranes show very good performance in DMFC cells. The cell performance of the SPEEKK membrane was a little better than its composite membranes. Among the composite membranes SPEEK/Ppy-3 showed the best performance. However, in the case of SPEEK/Ppy-1, the methanol permeability was higher than those of other composite membranes despite the comparable proton conductivity to SPEEK. As a result of that, SPEEK/Ppy-1 had the lowest cell performance. Because the polypyrrole particles in the internal space acted as a resistance resulting in significant decrease in the proton conduction through the membrane. It is interesting to note that after the fuel cell performance experiment, SPEEK membranes show much more serious swelling than the composite membranes, despite the fact that they have a little better performance. We believe that the composite membranes will show a much longer life than SPEEK membranes. 4 Conclusion SPEEK/Ppy composite membranes were expected to decrease the methanol permeability of SPEEK membranes with a high IEC. In this paper, we first introduced the Ppy particles into SPEEK solutions, then prepared SPEEK/Ppy composite membranes by solution casting. The results show a powerful way to obtain uniformly distributed SPEEK/Ppy membranes, which can control the content of Ppy very efficiently. The composite membranes show good proton conductivity, low methanol permeability and have good thermal stability. The composite membranes have good potential for use in DMFCs.

        "title": "Sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone)/clay-SO3H hybrid proton exchange membranes for direct methanol fuel cells",
        "abstract": "A new type of sulfonated clay (clay-SO 3 H) was prepared by the ion exchange method with the sulfanilic acid as the surfactant agent. The grafted amount of sulfanilic acid in clay-SO 3 H was 51.8 mequiv. (100 g) \u22121 , which was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK)/clay-SO 3 H hybrid membranes which composed of SPEEK and different weight contents of clay-SO 3 H, were prepared by a solution casting and evaporation method. For comparison, the SPEEK/clay hybrid membranes were produced with the same method. The performances of hybrid membranes for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) in terms of mechanical and thermal properties, water uptake, water retention, methanol permeability and proton conductivity were investigated. The mechanical and thermal properties of the SPEEK membranes had been improved by introduction of clay and clay-SO 3 H, obviously. The water desorption coefficients of the SPEEK and hybrid membranes were studied at 80 \u00b0C. The results showed that the addition of the inorganic part into SPEEK membrane enhanced the water retention of the membrane. Both methanol permeability and proton conductivity of the hybrid membranes decreased in comparison to the pristine SPEEK membrane. However, it was worth noting that higher selectivity defined as ratio of proton conductivity to methanol permeability of the SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H-1 hybrid membrane with 1 wt.% clay-SO 3 H was obtained than that of the pristine SPEEK membrane. These results showed that the SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H hybrid membrane with 1 wt.% clay-SO 3 H had potential usage of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) for DMFCs. Keywords DMFCs SPEEK Hybrid membranes Clay Sulfanilic acid 1 Introduction Recently, direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) with the advantages of compactness, light weight, high power density and low temperature operation have attracted significant attention for the applications of power sources for various portable electronic devices and transportation [1] . However, for commercial feasibility, multiple difficulties of DMFCs should be overcome, such as low methanol oxidation kinetics of the anode catalyst, high methanol crossover through the electrolyte membranes, low electrode performance, etc. [2] . Proton exchange membrane (PEM) which provides ionic pathways for protons and prevents crossover of gases in fuel cells is considered as one of the most important components of DMFCs. A series of perfluorinated ionomers such as Nafion \u00ae with good performances such as excellent chemical and mechanical stabilities, as well as high proton conductivity have been used in fuel cells. However, when methanol diffuses from the anode side to the cathode side of the Nafion \u00ae membrane, cathode voltage and efficiency of DMFCs will be reduced and the excess thermal load will occur, which hinder Nafion \u00ae to be used for future DMFC developments [3] . For this, many researches have focused on developing new materials for PEMs based on sulfonated aromatic polymers. Recently, sulfonated poly(aryl ether ketone)s (SPAEK)s have been developed as alternative PEM materials [4\u20137] . However, the SPAEKs with high ion-exchange capacities (IEC) although exhibit high proton conductivity, still have relatively high methanol permeability, high swelling ratio and low mechanical properties at evaluated temperatures, which limit their available usage for DMFCs [4\u201310] . For last few years, the organic\u2013inorganic hybrid PEMs have been prepared by addition of non-conductive ceramic oxide such as silicon oxide, titanium oxide and zirconium oxide, mixed silicon\u2013titanium and silicon\u2013aluminum oxides for improving hydrolysis resistance and reducing methanol crossover of PEMs in DMFCs [11\u201315] . Among various inorganic compounds, clay (montmorillonite) with the structures of the repeating triple-layer sheets composed of an edge-shared octahedral sheet of alumina sandwiched between two tetrahedral silica sheets with a thickness of 1 nm and a length of 100 nm shows attractive hydrophilic property and good thermal stability at high temperature [16,17] . The clay is also a protonic conductor with the ionic conductivity of 1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 S cm \u22121 at room temperature [18] . Jung's groups [19] had reported the clay as the inorganic part to prepare Nafion \u00ae /clay hybrid membranes to reduce the methanol permeability through the membrane and prevent the loss of the water at high temperature. However, the conductivity of clay is so low that the proton conductivity of the hybrid membranes was markedly lower compared with the pristine Nafion \u00ae membrane. To solve this problem, Lee et al., Choi et al., Ma et al. and B\u00e9bin et al. [20\u201325] , respectively, prepared different types of sulfonated clays (clay-SO 3 Hs) to modify Nafion \u00ae membrane. The resulting hybrid membranes had obtained both lower methanol permeability and higher proton conductivity than those of the pristine Nafion \u00ae membrane. Therefore, clay-SO 3 H can improve the performances of the Nafion \u00ae membrane, such as methanol resistance, proton conductivity and selectivity. Thus, clay-SO 3 H was used to modify SPEEK membranes with high IEC values and the improvement on the performances of the SPEEK membranes by introduction of the sulfonated clay was investigated in this paper. In this study, we used ion exchange method to prepare a new type of clay-SO 3 H. Clay-SO 3 H was used for the preparation of SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H hybrid membranes in order to minimize the loss of proton conductivity while reducing the methanol permeability of the pristine SPEEK membrane. The SPEEK/clay and SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H hybrid membranes with various contents of clay and clay-SO 3 H were prepared by a solution casting and evaporation method. The performances of the hybrid membranes such as mechanical and thermal properties, water retention, methanol permeability and proton conductivity were examined and the results were discussed in detail. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials SPEEK polymers were prepared by direct aromatic nucleophilic substitution polymerization [4] . The SPEEK in acid form was obtained by heating into a 0.1-M H 2 SO 4 solution for 12 h at 100 \u00b0C, and then the SPEEK in acid form was washed with deionized water until the pH reached 6\u20137. The chemical structure of SPEEK was shown in Scheme 1 . Clay (montmorillonite with a cation exchange capacity of 100 mequiv. (100 g) \u22121 ) was supported by Zhejiang Fenghong Clay Chemicals Co., Ltd. 2.2 Preparation of clay-SO 3 H with ion exchange method Five grams of clay was added into 500 g of boiling water, mixed, and then heated for 10 min to form the clay suspension. Sulfanilic acid (Beijing Chemical Works, China) was dissolved in 500 g of water and then a given quantity of hydrochloric acid was added to protonate amine groups. After being vigorously stirred for 1 h at 80\u201390 \u00b0C, the clay suspension was repeatedly washed with deionized water until no chloride ion was detected by AgNO 3 and dried under vacuum. 2.3 Preparation of organic\u2013inorganic hybrid membranes A desired amount of clay or clay-SO 3 H were added to 10 wt.% SPEEK in acid form solution and mechanically mixed for at least 24 h at room temperature until forming high transparent solution. Subsequently, the resulting mixture was poured onto a glass plate. The hybrid membranes (50\u2013150 \u03bcm) were prepared and dried at 65 \u00b0C for 24 h. In the following sections, hybrid membranes with different weight ratios (1, 3, and 5 wt.%) of clay or clay-SO 3 H will be referred as SPEEK/clay-1, SPEEK/clay-3, SPEEK/clay-5, SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H-1, SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H-3 and SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H-5, respectively. The preparation process was shown in Scheme 2 . 2.4 The analysis of hybrid membranes 2.4.1 FTIR spectroscopy The FTIR spectroscopy was recorded on the powder samples dispersed in dry KBr in form of disks, using a BRUKER Vector 22 spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm \u22121 min \u22121 from 4000 to 400 cm \u22121 . 2.4.2 Content of grafting sulfanilic acid in clay-SO 3 H measurement To investigate the grafted amount of sulfanilic acid on the surface of the clay, the clay-SO 3 H was analyzed by Pyris TGA (PerkinElmer). The thermal analyzer was programmed to heat the samples from 80 to 600 \u00b0C at the heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 under N 2 . The content of sulfanilic acid grafting on the surface of the clay was determined using the following equation from the weight loss [26] : (1) graft \u2009\u200a\u200a amount ( mequiv . ( 100 \u2009 g ) \u2212 1 ) = 10 3 W 200 \u2212 600 ( 100 \u2212 W 200 \u2212 600 ) M \u00d7 100 where W 200\u2013600 is the weight loss between 200 and 600 \u00b0C corresponding to sulfanilic acid degradation, M (g mol \u22121 ) is the molecular weight of sulfanilic acid. 2.4.3 Mechanical property The mechanical property of the dry membrane was measured using SHIMADZU AG-I 1KN at the test speed of 2 mm min \u22121 . The size of specimen is 15 mm \u00d7 4 mm. For each test reported, at least three samples were taken and average value was calculated. 2.4.4 Thermal stability A Pyris TGA (PerkinElmer) was used to study the thermal stability of the hybrid membranes. About 5\u201310 mg samples of the hybrid membranes were heated to 150 \u00b0C and kept at this temperature for 20 min to remove any residual water or solvent under N 2 , and then cooled to 80 \u00b0C and reheated to 700 \u00b0C at the heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . 2.4.5 Water uptake (WU) The water uptake at different temperature was determined by the weight difference between the fully hydrated membrane and dried membrane. The membrane was first equilibrated in water at 25, 40, 60 and 80 \u00b0C for about 12 h, and then removed from water quickly, dry-wiped the extra water on the membrane surface and immediately weighed to determine the wet mass ( W wet ). The dried weight ( W dry ) of membrane was determined after the membrane was dried at 100 \u00b0C for 24 h. The water uptake was calculated by the following formula: (2) water \u2009\u200a\u200a uptake ( WU ) = W wet \u2212 W dry W dry \u00d7 100 % 2.4.6 Water desorption measurement The water desorption measurement was tested by Pyris 1 TGA (PerkinElmer). The temperature was remained at 80 \u00b0C and the pressure of the test cell was kept constant. Pyris 1 TGA was used to evaluate the weight changes of samples with time. The plots of M t / M \u221e versus t 1/2 initially were linear for Fickian diffusion. Water diffusion coefficient was calculated as follows [27] : (3) M t M \u221e = D t \u03c0 l 2 1 / 2 where D is the water diffusion coefficient. M t and M \u221e refer to the mass desorbed at time t and infinite time, respectively. M t / M \u221e is the water desorption, and l is the membrane thickness. 2.4.7 Methanol permeability measurement Methanol permeability of the membrane was measured using a two-chamber liquid permeability cell. This cell consisted of two reservoirs, which were separated by a vertical membrane after being immersed in 10 M methanol solution for 24 h. Ten molar concentration of methanol solution was placed in one side of the cell and water was placed in the other side. Two magnetic stirrers were used continuously during the measurement. Methanol concentrations in the water cell were periodically estimated using a GC-8A gas chromatograph (SHIMADZU, Tokyo, Japan). The methanol diffusion coefficient was calculated with equation: (4) C B ( t ) = A V B DK L C A ( t \u2212 t 0 ) where A , L and V B are the effective area, the thickness of membrane and the volume of permeated reservoirs, respectively. C A and C B are the methanol concentration in methanol chamber and water chamber, respectively. DK is the methanol diffusion coefficient. 2.4.8 Proton conductivity The proton conductivity was measured by a four-electrode ac impedance method from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz, 10 mV ac perturbation and 0.0 V dc rest voltage using a Princeton Applied Research Model 273A Potentiostat (Model 5210 frequency response detector, EG&G PARC, Princeton, NJ). The membranes were fixed in a measuring cell which was made of two outer gold wires to feed current to the sample and two inner gold wires to measure the voltage drops. During the measurement, the measuring cell with the membranes was immersed into water in order to assure the condition of 100% relative humidity at desired temperature after the membranes were full hydrated in water for 24 h.The proton conductivity was calculated using the following equation: (5) \u03c3 = L R A where \u03c3 is proton conductivity in S cm \u22121 , L is the distance between the two electrodes, R is the resistance of the membrane and A is the cross-sectional area of membrane. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Analysis of clay-SO 3 H The efficiency of the clay surface modification was confirmed by FTIR as shown in Fig. 1 . The FTIR spectrum of the pristine clay displayed typical OH stretching absorption at 3626 cm \u22121 , and broad bands at 3427 and 1642 cm \u22121 could be attributed to physisorbed water. The peaks at 1120, 1038 and 915 cm \u22121 corresponded to Si O stretching vibrations. The absorption bands between 600 and 400 cm \u22121 could be associated with Al O stretching and Si O bending [28] . For the clay-SO 3 H, the new absorption bands at 3247 and 1530 cm \u22121 (NH 3 + stretching), 1500\u20131300 cm \u22121 (aromatic C C stretching) and 691 cm \u22121 (S O stretching of sulfonic acid groups) indicated that sulfanilic acid was grafted on the surface of the clay, successfully. The absorbance peaks related to asymmetric and symmetric stretching of SO 3 \u22121 groups, which were expected at 1040 and 1100 cm \u22121 , were not evident as they superimposed onto the intense peaks of Si O Si bonds. TGA was used to determine the grafted amount of sulfanilic acid on the surface of the clay in clay-SO 3 H after extensively washing the non-grafted sulfanilic acid. Fig. 2 shows the TGA thermograms before and after organic grafting of the clay. The TGA thermogram of clay-SO 3 H exhibited three distinct decomposition regions. The first weight loss between 80 and 200 \u00b0C was mainly attributed to the thermal diffusion of water. The second weight loss between 200 and 600 \u00b0C represented the thermal decomposition of the organic molecule and was considered for quantitative determination of the sulfanilic acid. The grafted amount determined by TGA analysis was 51.8 mequiv. (100 g) \u22121 calculated by Eq. (1) . 3.2 Analysis of the hybrid membranes 3.2.1 Mechanical and thermal property Good mechanical and thermal properties are required for PEMs in DMFCs to guarantee a long lifetime of fuel cells. Mechanical properties such as tensile strength, Young's modulus and maximum elongation of the hybrid membranes should be taken into account under operation conditions of DMFCs. The typical mechanical properties of the hybrid membranes were evaluated and the results were listed in Table 1 . The Young's moduli for the membranes of SPEEK, SPEEK/clay-1, SPEEK/clay-3, SPEEK/clay-5, SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H-1, SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H-3 and SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H-5 were 0.94, 1.53, 1.20, 1.30, 1.36, 0.98 and 1.20 GPa, respectively. The Young's moduli of the hybrid membranes were all larger than the pristine SPEEK membranes. Moreover, the Young's moduli of SPEEK/clay systems were larger than those of SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H systems with the same contents of clay, which might be because that the sulfanilic acid had somehow lead to void spaces between the clay and the polymer matrix, and these void spaces limited stress transfer to the reinforcing phase of the inorganic clay particles. The tensile strengths of hybrid membranes showed the same tendency with the values from 43 to 64 MPa. The 1 wt.% clay into SPEEK/clay-1 and SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H-1 hybrid membranes had been well dispersed, even, formed the exfoliation structures into the SPEEK matrix [29] , which caused the highest mechanical properties of all hybrid membranes. It was worth noting that the increase in tensile strength and in Yong modulus was obtained by increasing the clay content from 3 to 5 wt.%, which was consistent with the results in Ref. [29] . It is well known that the inorganic particles are rigid. When the inorganic particles are well dispersed into the organic parts, the rigidity of resulted materials will be improved. The results of the mechanical properties indicated that the hybrid membranes were nice candidates for application of functional PEM materials in DMFCs. Thermal stabilities of SPEEK and the hybrid membranes were investigated by TGA as shown in Fig. 3 . For all the membranes, two distinct weight loss steps were observed. The first weight loss from 300 to 450 \u00b0C was attributed to the thermal degradation of sulfonic acid groups. The second weight loss above 450 \u00b0C represented the thermal decomposition of the main chains of SPEEK and sulfanilic acid. It was well known that the clay could enhance heat resistance to the hybrid materials, especially at high temperature region. As shown in Table 1 , the 5% weight loss temperatures ( T 5% ) of the SPEEK was 302 \u00b0C and that of the SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H-1 hybrid membranes in acid form were up to 308 \u00b0C. The results showed that the thermal stabilities had been improved with the increment of clay or clay-SO 3 H. At 440 \u00b0C, the thermal degradation of the sulfonic acid groups had been approximately complete and the weight loss obtained from TGA at this temperature represented the weight content of the sulfonic acid groups in the SPEEK and hybrid membranes. The char yields of the hybrid membranes at 440 \u00b0C were also listed at Table 1 . The results showed that the contents of sulfonic acid groups in SPEEK/clay hybrid membranes were decreased with the increasing content of clay. However, the different tendency was obtained in SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H hybrid membranes due to the introduction of sulfanilic acid on the surface of the clay. TGA studies revealed that the hybrid membranes had good thermal properties as a result of the incorporation of clay into SPEEK matrix. 3.2.2 Water uptake and water desorption Water plays an important role in PEMs and directly affects proton transport across their membranes [30] . Generally, it is believed that protons can be transported along with hydrogen-bonded ionic channels and cationic mixtures such as H 3 O + , H 5 O 2 + , and H 9 O 4 + in the water [31] . Too low water uptake reduces proton transport, while extreme water uptake causes overmuch swelling and the loss of the dimensional stability. The water uptakes of the SPEEK and hybrid membranes at different temperature were shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2 . It is well known that the monovalent ions located between the clay layers allow the absorption of polar solvent, like water. Hence, with the increasing content of the hydrophilic clay, the water uptakes of organic\u2013inorganic hybrid membranes would increase. For example, compared with the pristine SPEEK membrane, the water uptakes of the hybrid membranes increased with the addition of clay or clay-SO 3 H from 35.24 to 42.20% at 25 \u00b0C, and the water uptakes of various membranes at 80 \u00b0C also showed the similar tendency, which corresponded to results shown by B\u00e9bin et al. [22] . As the increasing of temperature, the polymer chains move and the free volume for water absorption increases. Thus, the water uptakes of all of the hybrid membranes increased with the increase of temperature. Water retention and diffusion of PEMs have significant effects on their proton conductivity, especially at high temperatures and low relative humidity [32] . To investigate loose and bond water within the hybrid membranes, water diffusion coefficients of the hybrid membranes were analyzed by the velocity of water evaporation in the hydrated membranes at 80 \u00b0C. Plots of M t / M \u221e versus t 1/2 initially were linear for Fickian diffusion laws [27] and were shown in Fig. 5 . The water diffusion coefficients of the SPEEK/clay membranes calculated from the slopes of the lines were 7.53 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , 5.47 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , and 2.13 \u00d7 10 \u22125 cm 2 s \u22121 for 1, 3, and 5 wt.% of clay, and those of SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H hybrid membranes were 4.02 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , 6.06 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , and 7.57 \u00d7 10 \u22125 cm 2 s \u22121 for 1, 3, and 5 wt.% of clay-SO 3 H, respectively, which were lower than that of the pristine SPEEK membrane (8.82 \u00d7 10 \u22125 cm 2 s \u22121 ). As shown in results, the speed of diffusion of water decreased with the addition of clay. It was considered that the anisotropic clay layers produced a tortuous path through the hybrid membrane and therefore made the loss of the bulk observation of transport of molecules through the hybrid membrane [22] . Namely, the water retention of the hybrid membranes at high temperatures was improved by the introduction of clay. 3.2.3 Methanol permeability, proton conductivity In DMFCs, the PEMs with low methanol diffusion coefficient are required because methanol diffusion from the anode to the cathode leads to lower cell voltage and fuel efficiency. The transport of methanol in membrane requires the connected channels formed by hydrophilic sulfonic acid groups providing with good connectivity [21] . The methanol diffusion coefficients of the SPEEK and hybrid membranes at room temperature were measured and the results were reported in Table 2 . The methanol diffusion coefficient of the pristine SPEEK membrane was 1.21 \u00d7 10 \u22126 cm 2 s \u22121 at room temperature, and those of the SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H hybrid membranes with 1, 3, and 5 wt.% of clay-SO 3 H were 3.80 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , 9.64 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , and 1.12 \u00d7 10 \u22126 cm 2 s \u22121 , respectively. The assumption of the destruction by the clay to the connected channels decreased the methanol diffusion coefficients of the hybrid membranes. The proton conductivities of the SPEEK and hybrid membranes at different temperatures with 100% relative humidity had been shown in Fig. 6 and the relative values were listed in Table 2 . The proton transport in membranes requires well-connected channels formed by ion clusters of hydrophilic sulfonic acid groups. Therefore, the content and the diameter of the connected channels have significant effect on the proton transport rate in membranes. When the density of sulfonic acid groups is low, the isolated ionic clusters form in the continuous hydrophobic phase [32] . Since the ionic clusters might be obstructed from the clay with low proton conductivity although the water uptakes of the hybrid membranes increased with the adding of the clay, the proton conductivities of the hybrid membranes decreased with the increment of the clay as can be seen in Fig. 6 . Addition of the sulfanilic acid into the clay resulted in an increasing trend of proton conductivities of the SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H hybrid membranes in comparison to the SPEEK/clay hybrid membranes. The proton conductivities of the hybrid membranes increased with the increase of the temperature as seen in Fig. 6 . All composite membranes showed good proton conductivity more than 10 \u22122 S cm \u22121 , which was the lowest value of practical interest for PEMs used in DMFCs. Membranes for the practical usage of PEMs in DMFCs were required to possess high proton conductivity and low methanol permeability. The selectivity means the characteristic factor for evaluating membrane performances of both proton conductivity and methanol permeability. In this case, the selectivity can be used just as a barometer to develop the best proton conductive polymer membranes with reducing methanol permeability. Fig. 7 shows the selectivity defined as the ratio of proton conductivity to methanol permeability of the SPEEK and hybrid membranes. The selectivities of the SPEEK/clay hybrid membranes were improved with the introduction of clay. However, the highest selectivity value was found from the SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H hybrid membrane with 1 wt.% clay-SO 3 H. The result suggested that the incorporation of 1 wt.% clay-SO 3 H into the SPEEK membranes had more impact on the reduction of methanol permeability than proton conductivity, and the hybrid membrane has a potential application for DMFCs. 4 Conclusions The clay-SO 3 H had been prepared from the ion exchange method of surface modification of clay with sulfanilic acid, successfully. The mechanical and thermal properties of the SPEEK membranes were dramatically improved by introduction of clay or clay-SO 3 H. The performances of the hybrid membranes for DMFCs such as water uptake, water desorption, methanol permeability, and proton conductivity were investigated. The water uptakes of the hybrid membranes were increased with the increasing content of clay or clay-SO 3 H. The water retentions at 80 \u00b0C and methanol resistances of the hybrid membranes had been obviously enhanced by adding of clay or clay-SO 3 H. The proton conductivities of SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H hybrid membranes decreased slightly compared with the pristine SPEEK membrane, however, the higher selectivity of SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H-1 hybrid membranes was shown. These results indicated that the SPEEK/clay-SO 3 H hybrid membrane which possessed good physical and chemical property was promising to be used as PEMs in DMFCs.

        "title": "Enhancement of the electrooxidation of ethanol on Pt\u2013Sn\u2013P/C catalysts prepared by chemical deposition process",
        "abstract": "In this paper, five Pt 3 Sn 1 /C catalysts have been prepared using three different methods. It was found that phosphorus deposited on the surface of carbon with Pt and Sn when sodium hypophosphite was used as reducing agent by optimization of synthetic conditions such as pH in the synthetic solution and temperature. The deposition of phosphorus should be effective on the size reduction and markedly reduces PtSn nanoparticle size, and raise electrochemical active surface (EAS) area of catalyst and improve the catalytic performance. TEM images show PtSnP nanoparticles are highly dispersed on the carbon surface with average diameters of 2 nm. The optimum composition is Pt 3 Sn 1 P 2 /C (note PtSn/C-3) catalyst in my work. With this composition, it shows very high activity for the electrooxidation of ethanol and exhibit enhanced performance compared with other two Pt 3 Sn 1 /C catalysts that prepared using ethylene glycol reduction method (note PtSn/C-EG) and borohydride reduction method (note PtSn/-B). The maximum power densities of direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) were 61 mW cm \u22122 that is 150 and 170% higher than that of the PtSn/C-EG and PtSn/C-B catalyst. Keywords Phosphorus Hypophosphite PtSnP nanoparticle Eletrooxidation Direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) 1 Introduction Direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) were attracting increasing interest as a compact power sources for portable applications, mainly due to the relatively simple handling, storage, and transportation of the fuel. Though the interests is focused on the use of methanol because of its better reaction kinetics and hence better performance in a fuel cell. However, the question of the toxicity of methanol remains crucial. Methanol is considered since a long time as a toxic product (mainly neurotoxic) [1] . It is to use other alcohols presenting negligible or very low chemical toxicity, which is essential, at least for some applications. Ethanol appears to be an interesting alternative fuel for a wide utilization. Its low toxicity added to its availability (from biomass products) is an important positive point for its use as an alternative fuel to methanol even if its reactivity is slightly lower. Hence, it is a promising liquid fuel for directly fueled DEFCs [1\u20137] . However, ethanol oxidation to CO 2 is associated with the cleavage of the C C bond, which requires higher activation energy than C H bond breaking, at least for currently known electrocatalysts [8\u201312] . To achieve this, it is necessary to modify the composition and structure of the anode catalyst [7,13\u201316] . The case of the oxidation of ethanol is more difficult than that of methanol with the necessity to break the C C bond to obtain its complete oxidation. The reaction is known to proceed via a complex multistep mechanism, involving a number of adsorbed reaction intermediates and byproducts resulting from incomplete ethanol oxidation [17] . The major adsorbed intermediates were identified as adsorbed CO and C-1 and C-2 hydrocarbon residues, whereas acetaldehyde and acetic acid have been detected as the main byproducts using differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), infrared spectroscopy, ion chromatography, and liquid chromatography [18\u201321] . Conversely to the case of methanol, Pt\u2013Ru based electrocatalysts lead to poor improvement of the ethanol electrooxidation. Pt\u2013Sn supported on high surface area carbon as the electrocatalysts of the anode for DEFCs is still considered to be the best catalysts among all those studied [1\u201316] , and the Pt 3 Sn is one of the most active systems known for CO oxidation [22] . Lamy and co-workers have found that the Pt\u2013Sn/C catalyst synthesized by impregnation\u2013reduction method possessed much higher catalytic activity for ethanol electrooxidation than pure Pt [1,2,23,24] . Xin and co-workers also found PtSn catalysts prepared by modified polyol method showed superior performance for ethanol electro-oxidation [25,26] . DEFC testing data indicate high performance when either unsupported or supported Pt\u2013Sn catalysts are used, depending on anode catalyst composition and particle size [1,2,4,7,25] . It has been reported that addition of a non-metallic element, P, drastically reduced the size of Fe single crystal in a magnetic alumite film [27] . Ultrafine amorphous alloy particles (UAAP) consisting of transition metal (M = Fe, Co, Ni) and metalloid element phosphorus have been studied extensively because of their interesting chemical and physical properties [28\u201331] . Many studies have addressed on the influences of P on the electronic state of metal elements, which obviously should have significant effects on some of the properties, e.g. magnetic and catalytic properties, of UAAP [31\u201334] . Okamoto et al. reported that a variation in 3d electron density on the nickel metal induced by phosphorus would modify the activity and selectivity of the nickel catalyst for hydrogenation [34] . Lukehart and co-workers [35] reported that they synthesized accidentally PtRuP2/C catalysts using five different Pt,Ru-bimetallic precursors as sources of metal. The results of experiment indicated that the presence of substantial amounts of PtRuP2 does not poison the catalytic performance of these catalysts and might even slightly enhance methanol electrooxidation. Daimon and Kurobe [36] studied that the addition of N, P and S reduced the size of PtRu catalyst particle deposited on carbon support and to improve the catalystic performance for methanol electrooxidation. In the previous work [37] , we have also found that the PtRuP/C catalyst synthesized by hypophosphite deposition possessed much higher catalytic activity for methanol electrooxidation. In this work, three kinds PtSnP/C catalysts and two kinds of Pt 3 Sn 1 /C electrocatalysts were prepared by different methods. It was found that deposited phosphorus can improve the dispersion of PtSn nanoparticles on carbon surface, reduce size of PtSn naoparticles and raise electrochemical active surface (EAS) area of catalyst when the sodium hypophosphite was used as reducing agent during the preparation of PtSn/C catalyst. The cyclic voltammetry and the single cell performance tests jointly show that Pt 3 Sn 1 P 2 /C (PtSnP/C-3) catalysts present the highest activity for ethanol electrooxidation among five catalysts. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Materials The chemical reagents H 2 PtCl 6 \u00b76H 2 O and SnCl 2 \u00b72H 2 O were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. The sodium hypophosphite, sodium borohydride and sodium citrate were purchased from Beijing Chemical Co. The Vulcan Carbon powder XC-72 was purchased from Cabot Corporation. Ultrapure water (18.2 M\u03a9) was used to prepare the solutions. All solvents were reagent grade and used as received unless otherwise noted. 2.1.2 Preparation of carbon supported PtSnP catalysts We synthesized the catalyst using three routes, as shown in Fig. 1 . The primary steps of this synthesis were given below: First, 165 mg H 2 PtCl 6 \u00b76H 2 O and 24 mg SnCl 2 \u00b72H 2 O (the ratios of Pt:Sn = 3:1) aqueous solutions were mixed with 300 mg Vulcan XC-72 carbon in the distilled water. Then, the above solutions were ultrasonic agitation for 30 min in air at the room temperature. The appropriate amounts solution of sodium hypophosphite (1.35 g) and sodium citrate (125 mg) was then added into the mixture with stirring. The pH value of the solution was adjusted to 9.2 using a 5 wt% sodium hydroxide solution, subsequently heated to 90 \u00b0C for 8 h, and then cooled in air. The carbon-supported PtSnP catalysts were then filtered and extensively washed with distilled water. The carbon-supported PtSnP catalysts were generally dried at room temperature in air. The following four independent reactions may take place in the system during reduction of metal chlorides with sodium hypophosphite (see Fig. 1 ). This means that while the hypophosphite was used as reducing agent for the preparation of PtSn/C alloy catalysts, the non-metallic phosphorus with platinum and tin deposited together on the surface of support. The PtSnP/C catalyst prepared by route 1, route 2 and route 3 were called as the PtSnP/C-1, PtSnP/C-2, PtSnP/C-3 catalysts, respectively. 2.1.3 Preparation of carbon supported PtSn catalysts For comparison, other two the total metal loading (Pt plus Sn) of 20 wt% PtSn/C catalysts were also synthesized by modified polyol method [25,26] and conventional reduction method. Carbon supported PtSn catalyst was synthesized by modified polyol method. 165 mg H 2 PtCl 6 \u00b76H 2 O and 24 mg SnCl 2 \u00b72H 2 O (the ratios of Pt:Sn = 3:1) were dissolved, respectively, in ethylene glycol or its mixture solution with water, in which the water volume content was 10%. Then following them, the pH of solution was modified to 12 and the temperature was increased up to 130 \u00b0C and kept constant for 2 h so that the metals were reduced adequately. Then the ultrasonically dispersed carbon slurry was added dropwise. After impregnation for 4 h, the mixture was filtered and the filter cake was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 \u00b0C for 2 h. The catalysts prepared in this way were called as PtSn/C-EG catalysts. Impregnated Carbon supported PtSn catalyst was synthesized by the conventional reduction method. A 165 mg H 2 PtCl 6 \u00b76H 2 O and 24 mg SnCl 2 \u00b72H 2 O (the ratios of Pt:Sn = 3:1) aqueous solutions were dispersed in a mixture of 250 mL deionized water. To this mixture, 300 mg Vulcan XC-72 carbon was added and the suspension was placed in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. The suspension was stirred for 30 min before the pH was adjusted to 8.0 with 0.1 M Na 2 CO 3 solution. The suspension continued stirring for complete impregnation. After that, reduction was performed by dropwise addition of 22 mL of 0.2 M L \u22121 NaBH 4. The slurry was maintained at room temperature for 3 h to allow complete reduction of Pt and Sn. The slurry was filtered and washed copiously with hot distilled water to remove chloride ions. The catalyst was dried in vacuum oven at 80 \u00b0C for 2 h. The catalysts prepared in this way were called as PtSn/C-B catalysts. The total metal loading (Pt plus Sn) was maintained at 20 wt%, for all the initial catalysts preparation in this work, and the Pt:Sn ratio of the precursor salts is 3:1. 2.2 Catalysts of physical characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the catalysts were obtained using a Rigaku-D/MAX-PC 2500 X-ray diffractometer with the Cu K\u03b1 ( \u03bb = 1.5405 \u00c5) radiation source operating at 40 kV and 200 mA. The bulk composition of the prepared catalysts and elements distribution were evaluated by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) in a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JAX-840). The measurements of transmission electron microspectroscopy (TEM) were carried out with a JEOL 2010 microscope operating at 200 kV with nominal resolution. Samples were prepared by dispersing catalyst/ethanol suspension onto a 3-mm-diam copper grid covered with holey carbon film as a substrate, then evaporating the solvent and drying them in air. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using an ESCALAB MKII photoelectron spectrometer (VG Scientific). The fast entry chamber allowed rapid sample transfer from air to UHV pressures (base pressures during XPS analysis were in the low-to-mid 10 \u221210 Torr range). The XPS experiments were performed in the spectroscopy chamber using a standard Mg anode X-ray source (and the Mg K\u03b1 X-rays at 1253.6 eV) and a 150 mm hemispherical electron energy analyzer. 2.3 Catalysts of electrochemical characterization 2.3.1 Electrochemical measurement An EG&G model 273A potentiostat/galvanostat (Princeton Applied Research) and a conventional three-electrode test cell were used for electrochemical measurements. A Pt flat was used as the counter electrode. The Ag/AgCl/Cl \u2212 electrode was used as the reference electrode. All the potentials were quoted with respect to the reference Ag/AgCl/Cl \u2212 electrode. The working electrode was a thin layer of Nafion impregnated catalyst cast on a glassy carbon disk held in a Teflon cylinder. The detailed preparation method was described in our previous work [38] . First, 5 mg of the Pt\u2013Ru/C catalyst was dispersed ultrasonically in 1 mL of the alcohol solution with 50 \u03bcL of 5% Nafion solution. Then, 10 \u03bcL of the dispersion was pipetted and spread on a mirror-finished glassy carbon electrode with 3 mm diameter. Finally, the electrode was dried at room temperature for 30 min. The glassy carbon electrode was polished with slurry of 0.5 and 0.03 \u03bcm alumina successively and sonicated in the triple distilled water before use. The apparent surface area of the glassy carbon electrode was 0.07 cm 2 . All electrolyte solutions were purged from the solution by bubbling with high purity nitrogen for 15 min prior to each electrochemical measurement. For cyclic voltammograms of ethanol were measured at the working electrode by cycling the potential between \u22120.2 and 0.9 V versus Ag/AgCl/Cl \u2212 at 10 mV s \u22121 in the 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 + 1 M CH 3 CH 2 OH solution. 2.3.2 Membrane electrode assembly (MEA) preparation and single DEFC testing The membrane electrode assemble (MEA) was prepared as follows. The catalyst inks containing the appropriate weight percent of a Nafion solution (Aldrich) was spread on the surface of the carbon paper substrates (TGPH-090, E-Tek Co.) and formed the anode and cathode catalyst layers. Then, 160 \u03bcL of 5 wt% Nafion solution was spread on the catalyst layers and dried in the room temperature. The catalyst loadings based only on metal content were 1.5 mg cm \u22122 of supported PtSn catalysts at the anode and 1.5 mg cm \u22122 of 20 wt% Pt loadings on Vulcan XC-72 (E-TEK commercial catalyst) at the cathode. The MEA is fabricated by hot-pressing the anode and cathode catalyst layer onto the pretreated Nafion117 membrane for 2 min at 50 atm and 120 \u00b0C. To fabricate the single DEFC, the MEA is placed between two graphite current collectors with a serpentine design for the fuel and air distribution. The single cell was consisting of two ribbed graphite plates, which were compressed between two gold plated end stainless steel plates. These we provided with liquid and gas-feed tubes to which were connected the electric wires for the current/voltage measurements. To measure the performance of the single DEFC with a 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm active cross-sectional catalyst area, and a fuel cell testing system (Arbin Instruments) that recorded cell potentials under constant-current conditions, A 2.0 M ethanol solution was preheated 70 \u00b0C and supplied to the anode with a 5.0 mL min \u22121 flow rate and pure oxygen was fed to cathode with 100 mL min \u22121 flow rate at 2 atm were used. 3 Results and discussion Route 1: A drop of NaBH 4 solution is added to a mixture containing appropriate amounts of H 2 PtCl 6 \u00b76H 2 O, 24 mg SnCl 2 \u00b72H 2 O and NaH 2 PO 2 \u00b7H 2 O, which has a pH value of 9\u201310 adjusted by adding a sodium hydroxide solution, after an incubation period the autocatalytic reaction takes place at room temperature. And this explains the fact that heating was often needed to induce the reaction if there were no NaBH 4 added (route 2 and route 3). Moreover, based on mechanistic studies, the overall reaction of the production of PtSnP is suggested to be composed of the following four in dependent reactions. As shown in Fig. 1 , the initial pH value of the solution was about 89\u201310. By adding a drop of NaBH 4 solution or heating the solution and after about 10 min incubation period, the pH value of the solution dropped rapidly because of the reduction of PtCl 6 2\u2212 and Sn 2+ which produced H + as shown by Eqs. (1) and (2). When the pH value dropped to about 6\u20137, the reaction of Eq. (3) might slow down the decrease of pH value of the solution, and meanwhile large amounts of H 2 evolved due to the hydrolysis of H 2 PO 2 \u2212 as depicted by Eq. (4) catalyzed by the PtSnP/C-1, PtSnP/C-2, PtSnP/C-3 ultrafine alloy nanoparticles formed. A summary of the preparation details and characterization data for each sample is provided in Table 1 . The total metal and phosphorus content of each sample ranges from 10.50 wt% for sample PtSnP/C-1 to 19.68 wt% for PtSn/C-B catalyst, depending on different reducing conditions. Experimental results revealed that the different preparation conditions significantly affected the morphologies, particle sizes, surface area, and the concentration of phosphorus bonded to the platinum and tin metal. The compositions of these catalysts as determined by EDX were PtSnP/C-1 (Pt 1.57 Sn 1.0 P 1.33 ), PtSnP/C-2 (Pt 0.86 Sn 1.0 P 1.22 ), PtSnP/C-3 (Pt 3.06 Sn 1.0 P 2.02 ), PtSn/C-EG (Pt 3.10 Sn 1.0 ), and PtSn/C-B (Pt 2.96 Sn 1.0 ) catalysts, respectively. Size distributions of the PtSn particles loaded on carbon were evaluated by TEM analysis. Fig. 2 presents the TEM images of (a) PtSnP/C-1, (b) PtSnP/C-2, (c) PtSnP/C-3, (d) PtSn/C-EG and (e) PtSn/C-B catalysts. In Fig. 2 a\u2013c, the dark spots of PtSn nanoparticles have a uniform and extremely narrow size distribution with an average diameter of 2 and 1.8 nm, respectively. For the PtSnP/C-1, as noted in Fig. 1 a, the image shows a slight increase in the size of the PtSn particles (2\u20132.2 nm). The PtSn/C-EG and PtSn/C-B catalysts not only have an increment in the size of PtSn nanoparticles (3\u20135 nm), but also have very poor distribution of the nanoparticles as seen in Fig. 2 d and e. The TEM observation demonstrates that the addition of P inhibits the aggregation of PtSn and reduced the size of PtSn nanoparticles, leading higher dispersion of the PtSn nanoparticles with the size distribution of 1.8 \u00b1 0.5 nm. It well known that the uniform distribution of the catalysts and a small particle size were key factors for the stable and efficient operation of Direct Methanol (Ethanol) Fuel cells [1\u20134,39\u201345] . Daimon et al. [36] and Xue et al. [37] synthesized 2.0 nm of well-dispersed PtRu catalyst nanoparticle supported on carbon, respectively. The about 2 nm of size of PtRu catalysts can simultaneously improve the catalytic activity and utilization efficiency of the catalyst in DMFC application. Therefore, for the fuel cell application, improvement of the catalytic activity and minimization of the Pt requirement will be essential. Fig. 3 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of (a) PtSnP/C-1, (b) PtSnP/C-2, (c) PtSnP/C-3, (d) PtSn/C-EG and (e) PtSn/C-B electrocatalysts. The first peak at 2 \u03b8 about 25\u00b0 was the XC-72 carbon support. It can be seen that both PtSn/C-EG(curve d) and PtSn/C-B (curve e) catalysts display four diffraction peaks of Pt (1 1 1), Pt (2 0 0), Pt (2 2 0) and Pt (3 1 1) at the corresponding diffraction positions, while apart from the four diffraction peaks, there appears diffraction peaks of SnO 2 (1 0 1) and SnO 2 (2 1 1) at around 34\u00b0 and 52\u00b0 (PCPDF#411445) for PtSn/C-EG(curve d) and PtSn/C-B (curve e). The XRD patterns of the PtSnP/C-1, PtSnP/C-2 and PtSnP/C-3 catalysts as shown in Fig. 3 B give two broad peak around 34\u00b0 and 52\u00b0. This is assigned to the diffractin peaks of SnO 2 (1 0 1) and SnO 2 (2 1 1). The XRD diffraction peaks do not contain any distinct peak corresponding to crystalline phase Pt (1 1 1), Pt (2 0 0), Pt (2 2 0) and Pt (3 1 1) for the PtSnP/C-1, PtSnP/C-2 and PtSnP/C-3 catalysts. Three samples all demonstrate amorphous structure, which may be attribute to the deposition of phosphorus.In electroless plating of Ni, NaH 2 PO 2 is known as a reductant, it is well known that P is incorporated into Ni and that Ni becomes amorphous by forming Ni phosphide [29,46,47] . However, two comparatively broad diffraction peaks, located near 43\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 2 \u03b8 , were also present. These peaks do not correspond to the principal diffraction peaks of tin metal. In Fig. 4 (A) , we show the Pt 4f spectrum of the PtSnP/C-3, PtSn/C-EG and PtSn/C-B catalysts. The binding energies at the 4f signal for the different 7/2 components were given in Table 2 . We find a definite positive shift in the binding energy of Pt 4f for PtSnP/C-3 catalysts in relation to those observed for PtSn/C-EG and PtSn/C-B catalysts. The 4f 7/2 binding energy shifted positively by 1.3 and 2.0 eV for PtSn/C-EG and PtSn/C-B catalysts, respectively. We attribute this effect to an electron transfer involving P, Sn and Pt atoms within the alloy in PtSnP/C-3 catalyst. Since the respective elemental electronegativity values for P,Sn and Pt were 2.52, 1.8 and 2.2, [48,49] respectively. P atoms could produce an electron withdrawing effect from the Pt and Sn atoms bringing about the polarisation of the PtSn bonds in the alloy. In Fig. 4 (B), we show the Sn 3d XPS spectrum for PtSnP/C-3, PtSn/C-EG and PtSn/C-B catalysts, The binding energies in various PtSn catalysts as obtained from their XPS spectra were given in Table 2 . From these data, we find a slight negative shift in the binding energy of Sn 3d of PtSnP/C-3 for PtSn/C-EG catalyst, while a definite positive shift was observed. The Chemmical state of P in PtSnP/C-3 catalyst was analyzed by XPS and P 2p spectrum was shown in Fig. 4 (C). The peaks at the lower and higher binding were assigned to phosphorus interacting with platinum and tin (129.5 eV) and oxidized phosphorus (133.8 eV), respectively. The lower binding energy peak at 129.5 eV shifted negatively by 0.9 eV from that for red phosphorus (130.4). It is concluded that the phosphorus species interacting with platinum and tin were negatively charged and that the phosphorus accepts electrons [29,47,48] . There is small peak attributed to pure phosphorus (130.4 eV). The composition of all samples was evaluate by EDX and provided in Table 1 . Fig. 5 shows the typical EDX spectrum of the PtSnP/C-3 catalyst with the nominal atomic composition of Pt 3.06 Sn 1.0 P 2.02 . It was found that the P and PtSn coexisted. The XPS and EDX analysis results suggested that P was enriched at the surface of PtSn catalyst nanoparticle. Because of the addition of P and change Pt (1 1 1), Pt (2 0 0) and Pt (2 2 0) plane of the structure of PtSnP catalyst, which was estimated by XRD in Fig. 3 (B).Taking these analytical results into account, it is considered that P coexisted with PtSn nanoparticle and that most of P existed in oxidized phosphorus at surface of PtSn catalyst nanoparticle and little forming interstitial compounds. Fig. 6 shows the cyclic voltammograms of the PtSnP/C-3, PtSn/C-EG and PtSn/C-B catalysts in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 electrolytes at room temperature at a scan rate of 10 mV s \u22121 between \u22120.2 and 0.8 V (versus Ag/AgCl/Cl \u2212 ). On the three catalysts that well defined hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks were found. For the PtSnP/C-3 catalyst, well-defined hydrogen adsorption\u2013desorption peaks with a much larger were observed in the potential region \u22120.2\u20130.05, demonstrating the higher surface area of the catalyst. The high surface area is owing to the presence of narrow size and uniform distribution of the PtSn nanoparticles as displayed in the TEM (see Fig. 2 c). The PtSn/C-EG catalyst exhibits a broad peak relatively with slightly higher current in the adsorption-desorption region than the PtSn/-B catalyst. This is probably due to agglomeration and poor dispersion of the PtSn nanoparticles in these catalysts (see Fig. 2 d and e). Electrochemical surface areas of PtSnP/C-3, PtSn/C-EG and PtSn/B electrocatalysts prepared by different methods were 172, 123, and 107 m 2 g \u22121 and also listed in Table 1 . These values were obtained by calculating the areas under the coulombic charge for hydrogen desorption peaks (see Fig. 6 ) after subtracting the contribution from double lager charging according to ref 51. It was found that addition P reduces the size of PtSn catalysts nanoparticles and improvement in efficiency of the catalyst caused by the increase the electrochemical surface areas of catalysts. Fig. 7 shows CO stripping voltammograms of the PtSnP/C-3, PtSn/C-EG and PtSn/C-B catalysts recorded at 10 mV s \u22121 in the 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 electrolyte at room temperature. The electrochemically active specific surface area of Pt and Sn metals in the Pt\u2013Sn/C catalysts can be calculated from the area of the oxidation peak of CO ad [50] . While electrochemically active specific surface were 157, 94.3, and 68 m 2 g \u22121 respectively (as show the Table 1 ). These data (EAS CO ) were in good agreement with those of hydrogen desorption (EAS H2 ). The higher activity of PtSnP/C-3 catalysts is attributed to the higher surface area (see Fig. 7 and Table 1 ). The results of this study further show that the incorporation of P as metalloid elements into the Pt and Sn may act to increase the total surface area. Similar results were obtained by analysis of the Ni\u2013P alloys [51,52,28] . The ethanol cyclic voltammograms results on the five catalysts were shown in Fig. 8 . From Fig. 8 , it is clear that the addition of the P element to PtSn results in the negative shift of the first ethanol electro-oxidation positive peak. The first positive oxidation peak on PtSnP/C-3 appears at the most negative potential, at about 0.674 V (versus Ag/AgCl/Cl \u2212 ), and the peak potential is about 0.038 V lower than that on PtSn/C-EG catalyst. The first electro-oxidation peak of ethanol on PtSnPC-1 and PtSnP/C-2 were 0.678 and 0.676 V (versus Ag/AgCl/Cl \u2212 ), respectively, and lower than that on PtSn/C-B (0.682 V). The PtSnP/C-3 shows the highest positive peak current density and has a lower overpotential (0.674 V versus Ag/AgCl/Cl \u2212 ). It is clear that the current density is about 1.6 and 2.0 times higher than that PtSn/C-EG and PtSn/C-B catalysts, respectively. The positive current density of ethanol electro-oxidation on PtSnP/C-1 is higher than that on PtSnP/C-2, but less than these on PtSnP/C-3, PtSn/C-EG and PtSn/C-B, respectively. It maybe that the metal content of PtSnP/C-1 and PtSnP/C-2 catalysts is 10.50 and 14.52 wt%, respectively, and lower than these of PtSnP/C-3, PtSn/C-EG and PtSn/C-B catalysts. Therefore, the PtSnP/C-1 and PtSnP/C-2 catalysts show lower activity to ethanol oxidation than other catalysts. From the CV results, it is apparent that the ternary phases of composition Pt 3.06 Sn 1.0 P 2.02 (PtSnP/C-3) exhibit higher positive peak current density, and consequently higher activity to ethanol electro-oxidation from the point of current density. The ethanol oxidation activity of the PtSn/C catalysts was measured with a unit cell. It was well know that at low temperature, the catalysts have a dominating effect on the performance of fuel cells, and comparisons of DEFC performance at relatively low temperature were the most practical and powerful ways of evaluating the activity of catalysts. Fig. 9 shows the performances of single DEFC with PtSnP/C-3, PtSn/C-EG and PtSn/C-B as the anode catalysts at room temperature. The PtSnP/C-3 catalyst shows a current density of 27.25 mA cm \u22122 , and exhibits a high maximum power density (8.33 mW cm \u22122 ) that were 78 and 110% higher than that of the PtSn/C-EG and PtSn/C-B catalysts (4.68 and 3.97 mW cm \u22122 ). As identified in the CV test, PtSnP/C-3 catalyst shows higher activity than other two catalysts in the single fuel cell tests. The open circuit voltage (OCV) of the single DEFC fuel cell with PtSnP/C-3, PtSn/C-EG and PtSn/C-B as the anode catalysts is 0.703, 0.633 and 0.574 V, respectively. Fig. 10 shows the performances of single DEFC with different anode catalysts at 70 \u00b0C.The performance of the single DEFC with PtSnP/C-1 as anode catalyst is similar to that of single DEFC with PtSn/C-B catalyst. The PtSnP/C-3 catalyst produces a higher maximum power density of 61 mW cm \u22122 at 70 \u00b0C, which is 150 and 170% higher than that of the PtSn/C-EG and PtSn/C-B catalyst, respectively. Such an improved activity indicates that the addition of P to PtSn enhances the ethanol oxidation activity, and by testing the single DEFC performances. The PtSnP/C-3 (Pt 3.06 Sn 1.0 P 2.02 /C) is evidently the more suitable anode catalyst among the five catalyst mentioned above. 4 Conclusions In this paper, the Pt 3 Sn 1 /C and Pt 3 Sn 1 P 2 /C catalysts for direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) were prepared by using three different methods. We have found that the addition of P reduced the size of PtSn catalyst particle, and to lead to a uniform and extremely narrow size distribution with an average diameter of 2 nm, and to improve the catalytic performance. In contrast to PtSn/C-EG and PtSn/C-B catalysts that prepared by modified polyol method and conventional reduction method, respectively. The electrocatalytic activity of the PtSnP/C-3 (Pt 3 Sn 1 P 2 /C) catalysts for the ethanol oxidation was better than that of the PtSn/C-EG and PtSn/C-B catalyst. From combining the results of the electrochemical cell and the practical single DEFC, we conclude that PtSnP/C-3 catalysts was an excellent catalyst for the direct ethanol fuel cell. The PtSnP/C catalyst is hopeful to have a practical application in DMFC.

        "abstract": "We first experimentally verified the real contribution of formic acid (FA) in the direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC). By comparing the cell performance of the fuel cell fueled with FA and methanol, we found that FA not only acts as fuel in the fuel cell, but is also of benefit to proton conducting and triple phase boundary (TPB) building in the anode. Considering the real contribution and the special mass transfer behavior of FA in the fuel cell, the anode was reasonably designed and optimized. Carbon cloth was selected as the optimized anode diffusion layer to achieve quick methanol transfer from fuel reservoir to anode catalyst. The decal method was proved to be the better choice for membrane electrode assembly (MEA) fabrication than the traditional hot pressing because it can result in better TPB building and lowering the FA crossover. DFAFC performed approximately 60% better after these anodic micro structure optimizations. \u00a9 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Therefore, a double-phase mathematical model was developed for the thermal investigation of DMFC stacks and to further build guidelines for their manufacture and operation. The effects of various configurational and operational parameters on the thermal distribution of the stacks were systemically studied. Current density, the number of single cells in the stack, the fuel concentration, the reactant flow rates, and some configurational parameters of the bipolar plate were optimized using the model to obtain a relatively uniform temperature distribution within the stack. The current density can strongly influence the thermal properties of large-scale DMFC stacks. As an example, extremely uniform temperature distribution was obtained for a 10-cell stack fueled with low-concentration methanol. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The PdCeO x/C catalyst was prepared and studied as anodic catalyst for formic acid electrooxidation. The morphology, composition and electrocatalytic properties were investigated by transmission electronmicroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry, respectively. The average particle size of Pd nanoparticles for PdCeO x/C catalyst was about 3.4 nm with a narrow size distribution. The electrochemical surface area (ESA) of PdCeO x/C catalyst was larger than the Pd/C catalyst. According to the Tafel plots, the presence of CeO x in the Pd/C catalyst can accelerate the rate of formic acid electrooxidation. The electrochemical measurements showed that the PdCeO x/C catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity and stability. For example, the peak current of PdCeO x/C catalyst for formic acid oxidation was about 1.67 times of the Pd/C catalyst and the stable current at 3600 s of PdCeO x/C catalyst was about 7 times of the Pd/C catalyst. The promotion effect should be attributed to the larger ESA, the electronic effect and more oxygen-containing species provided by the CeO x and this catalyst may be used as an effective catalyst for direct formic acid fuel cell. \u00a9 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Here, using a phosphomolybdic acid (PMo 12)-assisted method, a Pd-PMo 12/C catalyst with uniform Pd nanoparticles is prepared. The TEM results show that the presence of PMo 12 facilitates the formation of uniform Pd particles with an average particle size of 3.2 nm. More importantly, the Pd-PMo 12/C catalyst displays an enhanced activity and stability for formic acid electro-oxidation and a better tolerance toward CO poisoning than Pd nanocatalysts prepared with sodium citrate as a stabilizer. A combination of the composition and structure analyses show that the reasons for the improved electro-catalytic activity of the Pd-PMo 12/C catalyst involve the metal-support interaction, the richer Pd oxide/hydrous oxide content and the inherent properties of PMo 12. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "A new structure of passive direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) with two methanol reservoirs separated by a porous medium layer is designed and a corresponding mathematical model is presented. The new designed passive DMFC can be directly fed with highly concentrated methanol solution or neat methanol. The porosity ( \u025b pr ) of the porous medium layer is optimized using the proposed model. Some operation parameters are also optimized by both the numerical calculation and experimental measurement. The new designed DMFC can be continuously operated for about 4.5 times longer than a conventional passive DMFC with the optimum parameters. The methanol crossover during the same discharging is only about 50% higher.",

Its formal potential, E 0\u2032 , is \u22120.363 V in phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.8) at a scan rate of 100 mV/s and is almost independent of the scan rate in the range of 50\u2013700 mV/s.

The experimental results also demonstrated that the immobilized HRP retained its bioelectrocatalytic activity to the reduction of H 2 O 2 . Furthermore, the HRP adsorbed on the surface of the active carbon powder can be stored at 4 \u00b0C for several months without any loss of the enzyme activity. The method presented for immobilizing HRP can be easily extended to immobilize and obtain the direct electrochemistry of other enzymes.",

It was discovered that the electrooxidation of formic acid could be promoted greatly by addition of trace amount of vanadium ions. A much greater enhancement in catalytic stability (3.19 times) was observed when compared to the improvement in catalytic activity (1.57 times), indicating the effective protection of Pd from deactivation by addition of vanadium ions into the electrolyte. The improvement in the catalytic performances may be attributed to the facilitating of formic acid elelctrooxidation due to the existence of VO 2+ /V 3+ redox pair and the ensemble effect induced by the adsorption of vanadium ions onto the surface of Pd.",

        "abstract": "For the goal of practical industrial development of fuel cells, inexpensive, sustainable, and high performance electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) are highly desirable alternatives to platinum (Pt) and other rare materials. In this work, sustainable fluorine (F)-doped carbon blacks (CB-F) as metal-free, low-cost, and high-performance electrocatalysts for ORR were synthesized for the first time. The performance (electrocatalytic activity, long-term operation stability, and tolerance to poisons) of the best one (BP-18F, based on Black Pearls 2000 (BP)) is on the same level as Pt-based or other best non-Pt-based catalysts in alkaline medium. The maximum power density of alkaline direct methanol fuel cell with BP-18F as the cathode (3 mg/cm2) is \u223c15.56 mW/cm2 at 60 C, compared with a maximum of 9.44 mW/cm2 for commercial Pt/C (3 mgPt/cm 2). All these results unambiguously demonstrate that these sustainable CB-F catalysts are the most promising alternatives to Pt in an alkaline fuel cell. Since sustainable carbon blacks are 10 000 times less expensive and much more abundant than Pt or other rare materials, these CB-F electrocatalysts possess the best price/performance ratio for ORR to date. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Surface-modified Nafion \u00ae membrane was prepared by casting proton-conducting polyelectrolyte complexes on the surface of Nafion \u00ae . The casting layer is homogeneous and its thickness is about 900 nm. The proton conductivity of modified Nafion \u00ae is slightly lower than that of plain Nafion \u00ae ; however, its methanol permeability is 41% lower than that of plain Nafion \u00ae . The single cells with modified Nafion \u00ae exhibit higher open circuit voltage (OCV = 0.73 V) and maximal power density ( P max = 58 mW cm \u22122 ) than the single cells with plain Nafion \u00ae (OCV = 0.67 V, P max = 49 mW cm \u22122 ). It is a simple, efficient, cost-effective approach to modifying Nafion \u00ae by casting proton-conducting materials on the surface of Nafion \u00ae . Keywords Polyelectrolyte complexes Chitosan Phosphotungstic acid Methanol permeation Proton-conducting 1 Introduction Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) are promising candidates for portable devices or transportation applications in view of their high energy density, easy manipulation, and high efficiency [1\u20133] . Perfluorosulfonic acid membranes, such as Nafion \u00ae membranes, are the primary membranes applied in the DMFCs presently. However, commercial Nafion \u00ae membranes do not meet the requirement for low methanol permeability especially at low temperatures (<100 \u00b0C) [4] . The methanol permeation results in reducing the open-circuit potential (OCP) and poisoning the electrocatalysts at the cathode. Various attempts have been made to overcome the drawbacks of Nafion \u00ae membranes for DMFC applications. The approaches described are diverse, ranging from doping with inorganic materials such as sulfonated montmorillonite [2] , silica [5] , silica/phosphotungstic acid [6] , zeolite [7] , zirconium phosphate [8] , etc., modifying the surface of Nafion \u00ae [9\u201312] to in situ polymerization with poly(1-methylpyrrole) [13] or polyfurfuryl alcohol [14] . Most modified Nafion \u00ae membranes indeed reduce methanol permeation, but the proton conductivity of modified Nafion \u00ae membranes is often markedly lower than that of plain Nafion \u00ae membranes. Among these modified Nafion \u00ae membranes, only a few of them meet the requirements for practical DMFC applications. Generally, oppositely charged polyions (polycations or polyanions) interact electrostatically to form polyelectrolyte complexes. We have reported the polyelectrolyte complexes formed between cationic chitosan and anionic phosphotungstic acid, which exhibit relatively high proton conductivity and low methanol permeability [15] . In the present work, we report a new approach to modifying Nafion \u00ae membranes by casting proton-conducting polyelectrolyte complexes formed between chitosan and phosphotungstic acid on the surface of Nafion \u00ae membranes. The performance of modified Nafion \u00ae for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) was evaluated in terms of proton conductivity, methanol permeability, and a single cell test. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of modified Nafion \u00ae Nafion \u00ae 115 membranes (Du Pont Co.) were pretreated by boiling them in 5 wt.% peroxide solution at 80 \u00b0C, 1 M aqueous sulfuric acid solution at 80 \u00b0C, and deionized water, in that order. 1% (w/v) chitosan solution was prepared by dissolving chitosan powder (degree of deacetylation: 95%; molecular weight: 50,000 g mol \u22121 , Haidebei Ltd., China) in 2% (v/v) acetic acid solution. The pretreated Nafion \u00ae 115 were immersed in chitosan solution mentioned above for 2 h, followed by a drying step at 60 \u00b0C in drying oven for 2 h. As a result, a layer of chitosan was formed on the surface of the Nafion \u00ae membranes. Nafion \u00ae membranes coated with a layer of chitosan were immersed in 0.05 M phosphotungstic acid solution for 6 h, and then were washed with deionized water and stored in deionized water prior to the different measurements. 2.2 Scanning electron microscopy The morphology of the membranes was characterized by a LEO 1525 FE-SEM scanning electron microscope. 2.3 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy IR spectra (4000\u2013500 cm \u22121 , resolution 4 cm \u22121 ) were recorded with a Bruker Vertex 70 RTIR spectrometer. 2.4 Measurements of proton conductivity The proton conductivity of plain Nafion \u00ae and modified Nafion \u00ae membranes was measured by a four-electrode ac impedance method from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz, 10 mV ac perturbation and 0.0 V dc rest voltage. Impedance spectra were recorded using a Princeton Applied Research Model 273A Potentiostat (Model 5210 frequency response detector, EG&G PARC, Princeton, NJ). The membranes were fixed in a measuring cell made of two outer gold wires to feed current to the sample and two inner gold wires to measure the voltage drops [16] . Conductivity measurements under fully hydrated conditions were carried out with the cell immersed in liquid water. The proton conductivity ( \u03c3 ) of the membranes was calculated using the following equation: (1) \u03c3 = L R A where L , R , and A denote the distance between the two inner gold wires, the resistance of the membrane, and the cross-sectional area of the membrane, respectively. 2.5 Measurements of methanol permeability The methanol permeability of these membranes was determined and calculated by the method described in the reference [15] . The methanol concentration in the receptor chamber was measured versus time by using a gas chromatograph (Shimazu GC-14B) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. 2.6 Performance tests for a single cell The Pt\u2013Ru/C with 40 wt.% Pt + 20 wt.% Ru/C and the Pt/C catalyst with 20 wt.% Pt were used as the anodic and cathodic catalysts, respectively. Nafion \u00ae 115 and the composite membrane prepared were used as the electrolyte. The fabrication of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is the same as that in the literature [17] . The catalyst loading was 4 mg cm \u22122 for both the anode and the cathode and the effective electrode area of the single cell was 10 cm 2 . The performance of the single cell was measured at 80 \u00b0C with a Fuel Cell Test System (Arbin Co.). 2.0 M CH 3 OH solution with a flow rate of 20 mL min \u22121 and oxygen with a flow rate of 0.5 L min \u22121 at 0.05 MPa were used. Each single cell was operated for three times. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Scanning electron microscopy Parts A and B of Fig. 1 show the surface images of plain Nafion \u00ae and modified Nafion \u00ae . From the both images, it can be observed that the polyelectrolyte complexes formed on the smooth surface of Nafion \u00ae are homogeneous, and have no obvious phase separation. From the cross-sectional image of modified Nafion \u00ae membrane in Fig. 2 , it is found that the thickness of the casting layer is about 900 nm. 3.2 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy Fig. 3 presents the IR spectra of plain Nafion \u00ae , the polyelectrolyte complexes and modified Nafion \u00ae . The bands at 1202, 1147, 1057, 982, 969 cm \u22121 are ascribed to characteristic functional groups in plain Nafion \u00ae [18] . The IR spectra of the polyelectrolyte complexes have already been discussed in detail in our previous works [15] . In comparison with the IR spectra of modified Nafion \u00ae , the characteristic bands of the polyelectrolyte complexes at 1619, 1520, 1077, 892, 785 cm \u22121 are also presented in the spectra of the modified Nafion \u00ae , which indicates the existence of the polyelectrolyte complexes on the surface of Nafion \u00ae . 3.3 Proton conductivity and methanol permeability The proton conductivity and methanol permeability of plain Nafion \u00ae , modified Nafion \u00ae and washed Nafion \u00ae are given in Table 1 (all the values in Table 1 are the average of three measurements). The proton conductivity of modified Nafion \u00ae is slightly lower than that of plain Nafion \u00ae , which is easy to understand because the conductivity of the casting layer (polyelectrolyte complexes) is inferior to that of plain Nafion \u00ae membranes [15] . However, the methanol permeability of modified Nafion \u00ae is reduced by 41% compared with that of plain Nafion \u00ae . This indicates that methanol permeation can significantly be reduced by casting the polyelectrolyte complexes on the surface of Nafion \u00ae . The polymer electrolyte membranes applied in DMFCs should possess simultaneously high proton conductivity and low methanol permeability. Membrane performances can be estimated from the ratio of proton conductivity ( \u03c3 ) to methanol permeability ( P ). That is to say, the higher the value of \u03c3 / P is, the better the performance of the membrane would be [19] . Table 1 shows that the value of \u03c3 / P of modified Nafion \u00ae is much higher than that of plain Nafion \u00ae . Besides, the value of \u03c3 / P of modified Nafion \u00ae is nearly the same with that of washed Nafion \u00ae , which shows that modified Nafion \u00ae is stable and durable. 3.4 Performance tests for a single cell Fig. 4 shows the plots of cell potential versus current density and power density versus current density for MEAs with plain Nafion \u00ae and modified Nafion \u00ae . As shown in Fig. 4 , the maximum power density is 58 mW cm \u22122 for modified Nafion \u00ae and 49 mW cm \u22122 for plain Nafion \u00ae . The performance of the single cell with modified Nafion \u00ae membrane is better than that with plain Nafion \u00ae . The single cell with modified Nafion \u00ae membranes possesses a higher open circuit voltage (OCV = 0.73 V) than that with plain Nafion \u00ae (OCV = 0.67 V). It has been previously explained that higher methanol permeation leads to lower OCP [7] . 4 Conclusions In conclusion, we have successfully modified Nafion \u00ae by casting proton-conducting materials, polyelectrolyte complexes of chitosan and phosphotungstic acid, on the surface of plain Nafion \u00ae . The casting layer is homogeneous and its thickness is about 900 nm. The proton conductivity of modified Nafion \u00ae is slightly lower than that of plain Nafion \u00ae ; however, its methanol permeability is 41% lower than that of plain Nafion \u00ae . The single cells with modified Nafion \u00ae exhibit a higher open circuit voltage (OCV = 0.73 V) and maximal power density ( P max = 58 mW cm \u22122 ) than the single cells with plain Nafion \u00ae (OCV = 0.67 V, P max = 49 mW cm \u22122 ). It is a simple, efficient, cost-effective approach to modifying Nafion \u00ae by casting proton-conducting materials on the surface of Nafion \u00ae .

        "abstract": "Ternary Fe/N/C catalysts are regarded as the most promising candidates for low-cost alternatives to Pt for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). High-temperature pyrolysis of N-containing carbon precursors in the presence of Fe salts has been a common and efficient route to prepare Fe/N/C catalysts. However, simple pyrolysis usually leads to a large weight loss of N-containing precursors, which not only increases the overall cost of the catalysts, but also results in the catalysts having a low density of active sites. We show herein that this problem can be effectively overcome by dispersing a highly hydrosoluble polymer precursor, namely, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), in NaCl crystallites. The use of the hydrosoluble polymer precursor enables efficient dispersion and confinement of the precursor in NaCl crystallites in a simple solvent evaporation process. The subsequent pyrolysis process not only shows little weight loss, but also produces a mesoporous Fe/N/C ORR catalyst with a remarkably higher specific surface area (414.5 m2 g\u22121) and ORR activity (half-wave potentials, E1/2 = 0.793 V and 0.878 V vs. RHE, respectively, in acidic and alkaline media) than those of the material prepared without using NaCl confinement (72.9 m2 g\u22121, E1/2 = 0.634 V and 0.785 V, respectively, in acidic and alkaline media).",

        "abstract": "Summary   Fuel cells are promising energy conversion devices which do not require the electrical charging process in comparison with a traditional secondary battery. Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), including direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), are the key technologies in the future due to the high energy conversion efficiency, low emission, and high energy density. DMFCs are promising to be used in mobile electronic devices (power under a few hundred watts) due to the easily and safely transport feature of methanol. Platinum is regarded as the most effective catalyst for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). However, the poor performance and the high cost of Pt block the DMFC large-scale applications. The essential method to overcome this shortfall is to develop effective modified-Pt, low-Pt and non-Pt catalysts. This short review paper will focus on the solution to improve the performance of anode MOR in the past 2 years. The structure of this article displays in Figure 1.",

        "abstract": "Developing cost-effective, active, and durable electrocatalysts is one of the most important issues for the commercialization of fuel cells. Ultrathin Pt-Mo-Ni nanowires (NWs) with a diameter of ~2.5 nm and lengths of up to several micrometers were synthesized via a H2-assisted solution route (HASR). This catalyst was designed on the basis of the following three points: (i) ultrathin NWs with high numbers of surface atoms can increase the atomic efficiency of Pt and thus decrease the catalyst cost; (ii) the incorporation of Ni can isolate Pt atoms on the surface and produce surface defects, leading to high catalytic activity (the unique structure and superior activity were confirmed by spherical aberration__orrected electron microscopy measurements and ethanol oxidation tests, respectively); and (iii) the incorporation of Mo can stabilize both Ni and Pt atoms, leading to high catalytic stability, which was confirmed by experiments and density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, the developed HASR strategy can be extended to synthesize a series of Pt-Mo-M (M = Fe, Co, Mn, Ru, etc.) NWs. These multimetallic NWs would open up new opportunities for practical fuel cell applications. Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Authors,",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The search for highly active catalysts with low-Pt content to advance the commercialization of fuel cells is continuing to receive ample attention. Herein, we report that by doping a single Pt atom into Au 25  to form Pt 1 Au 24  nanoclusters, the electrocatalytic activity for the direct formic acid oxidation (FAO) to carbon dioxide is enhanced significantly. The mass activity of Pt 1 Au 24  (3.7\u202fA\u202fmg Pt+Au  \u2212  1 ) is nearly 12 and 34 times greater than that of Pt nanoclusters and the commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and potential-dependent thermodynamic analyses provide fundamental insights into the reaction mechanism illustrating that FAO proceeds through the carboxyl (COOH) intermediate on Pt 1 Au 24 . The present study not only develops a novel class of single-Pt atom doped Au nanocluster electrocatalysts for fuel cells with high utilization of Pt, but also provides insight into the mechanism of FAO on Pt-doped Au nanoclusters. Moreover, this study begins to shed light on the structure-activity relationship and helps to provide a strategy to design new catalysts by tuning their catalytic properties at the atomic level.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The development of efficient and dimensionally stable electrode plates is of a significant challenge for the oxygen evolution reaction in the industrial water electrolysis process. In this work, structurally stable electrode plates are developed based on the nanostructured Ni Fe catalysts on highly porous and dimensionally stable Co reactive deposited on Ti substrates, Ni Fe@Co/Ti. SEM analysis shows the hierarchically structured micro- and nano-porous structure of the Co electrode on Ti substrates by reactive deposition route. The surface area of the reactive deposited Co is 3 times larger than that of the conventional electrodeposited Co electrode, providing highly porous and stable base for the subsequent deposition of Ni Fe electrocatalysts. The as-prepared Ni Fe@Co/Ti electrode exhibits high catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution in alkaline solutions, achieving an onset potential of as low as 1.44\u00a0V (\u03b7\u00a0=\u00a0210\u00a0mV) and delivering a current of 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm \u22122  at an overpotential of 0.26\u00a0V. Most importantly, the electrode shows excellent stability with negligible degradation under the discharge current density at 100\u00a0mA\u00a0cm \u22122  for 100\u00a0h, demonstrating the practical applicability of the Ni Fe@Co/Ti nanostructured electrodes for industrial scale water electrolysis.",

        "title": "Preparation of a carbon supported Pt catalyst using an improved organic sol method and its electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation",
        "abstract": "The organic sol method for preparing ultrafine transition metal colloid particles reported for the first time by Bonnemann et al. [H. Bonnemann, W. Brijoux, R. Brinkmann, E. Dinjus, T. Jou\u03b2en, B. Korall, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 30 (1991) 1312] has been improved in this paper. The improved organic sol method uses SnCl 2 as the reductant and methanol as the organic solvent. Thus, this method is very simple and inexpensive. It was found that the average size of the Pt particles in the Pt/C catalysts can be controlled by adjusting the evaporating temperature of the solvent. Therefore, the Pt/C catalysts prepared by the same method are suitable for evaluating the size effect of the Pt particles on electrocatalytic performance for methanol oxidation. The results of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that when the evaporating temperatures of the solvent are 65, 60, 50, 40, and 30 \u00b0C, the average sizes of the Pt particles in the Pt/C catalysts prepared are: 2.2, 3.2, 3.8, 4.3, and 4.8 nm, respectively. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) results demonstrated that the small Pt particles are easily oxidized and the decomposition/adsorption of methanol cannot proceed on the surfaces of Pt oxides. Thus, the Pt/C catalyst with small Pt particles has a low electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation. The Pt/C catalyst with a large average size of the Pt particles also possesses a small electrochemically active surface area. Therefore, only the Pt/C catalyst with a middle average size of Pt particles, such as 3.8 nm exhibited optimal electrocatalytic performance for methanol oxidation. Because the Pt/C catalysts with the different particle sizes were prepared with the same method, the size effect on the electrocatalytic performance of the catalysts could be reliably investigated. Keywords Direct methanol fuel cell Pt/C catalyst Improved organic sol method Methanol oxidation 1 Introduction The direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) has good potential applications as the power sources for transportation and portable devices [1\u20136] . However, the DMFC still has some problems. One of them is the low electrocatalytic activity of the Pt catalyst usually used for the methanol oxidation. Thus, a study of the increase in electrocatalytic performance for the Pt catalyst is important [7] . This has involved the variation of both the catalyst preparation method and the catalyst composition [8] . Many composite catalysts, such as Pt-Sn [9] , Pt-WO 3 [10,11] , Pt-Ru-WO 3 [12] , Pt-heteropoly acids [13] , Pt-macrocycle co-catalysts [14] and Pt-Ru [15\u201319] have been investigated. Also, many catalyst preparation methods, such as the general chemical reduction method, organic sol method [8] , electrochemical deposition method [20] , vapor deposition method [21,22] , thermal decomposition method [23] , co-impregnation method [24,25] , spray pyrolysis method [26] , ionic liquid method [27] , solid phase reduction method [28] , etc., have been reported. In 1991, Bonnemann et al. [8] firstly reported the organic sol method for preparing colloidal transition metal catalysts, such as Pt, Ru, Pd, Os, Ir, Cr, Mn, and Ni catalysts using NR 4 BEt 3 H (R = octyl, hexyl, decyl) as the reductant. Thereafter, using this method, some groups prepared different carbon supported catalysts. For example, Frelink et al. [29] prepared the Pt/C catalyst with ca. 2.10 nm Pt particle size. Schmitt et al. synthesized the Pt-Ru/C [30\u201332] and Pd-Au/C [33] catalysts. The colloidal Pt-Ru, Pt-Ru-Sn, Pt-Ru-Mo, and Pt-Ru-W catalysts with 1.7 nm particle size were prepared by Gotz and Wendt [34] . However, this organic sol method has some disadvantages. Especially, the raw materials, such as NR 4 BEt 3 H (R = octyl, hexyl, decyl) are expensive and the procedure is very complicated. Therefore, this method is only suitable for the research work in the laboratory. It has been reported that the size of the Pt particles in the Pt/C catalyst could affect the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt/C catalysts for the methanol oxidation [35\u201339] . Therefore, the preparation of the Pt/C catalyst with an optimal average size of the Pt particles and a narrow size distribution of the Pt particles is important. In order to know what average size of the Pt particles is optimal for methanol oxidation, some groups [35\u201338] have studied the effects of size of the Pt particles in the Pt/C catalyst on electrocatalytic activity for the methanol oxidation. However, the results were very different. Using the Pt/C catalysts prepared with different methods, Attwood et al. [35] found that the best average size of the Pt particles in the Pt/C catalyst for methanol oxidation is about 3 nm. Frelink et al. [36] indicated that the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt/C catalysts for the methanol oxidation decreases with decreasing the Pt particles size in the range 4.5\u20131.2 nm. Takasu et al. [37] came to a similar conclusion using a Pt catalyst supported on glassy carbon electrodes with the Pt particle sizes from 7 to 2 nm. Watanabe et al. [38] reported that no Pt particle size effect was observed when the Pt/C catalysts with the different sizes of Pt particles on different carbon supporters were prepared by the same method. These contradictory results may be due to the difference in the preparation methods and supports for the Pt/C catalyst. Obviously, many factors, such as the average particle size, the relative crystallinity, the surface groups, the surface morphology and the Pt\u2013C interface of the Pt/C catalysts can affect the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt/C catalysts [40\u201344] . Therefore, when the Pt/C catalysts are prepared with the different methods or using different carbon supports, many factors can influence the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt/C catalysts, leading to the different conclusions. In this paper, the organic sol method for preparing the transition metal colloid particles, reported for the first time by Bonnemann et al. [8] , was improved. A Pt/C catalyst with a small average size of the Pt particles was prepared with the simple improved organic sol method using inexpensive SnCl 2 as the reductant in methanol. It was found that the average size of Pt particles in the Pt/C catalyst can be controlled by adjusting the evaporating temperature of the methanol. Therefore, the Pt/C catalysts prepared by this method are suitable for evaluating the size effects of the Pt particles on the electrocatalytic performance for methanol oxidation. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation and characterization of the catalysts The preparation procedure for the Pt/C catalysts is as follows. After 5.0 mL 41.2 mM SnCl 2 in methanol was added to 2.67 mL 38.6 mM H 2 PtCl 6 in methanol at the room temperature with sonication, a Pt sol was obtained. Then, 80 mg of Vulcan XC-72 carbon black (from the Cabot Co.) was mixed with the Pt sol and the mixture was dried in a N 2 atmosphere at a controlled temperature until the methanol was completely evaporated. The Pt/C catalyst obtained was washed with 6 M NaOH solution to eliminate SnCl 2 and SnCl 4 . Finally, it was washed with water until no Cl \u2212 was detected in the effluent. After drying at 90 \u00b0C in vacuum, a Pt/C catalyst with 20 wt% Pt was obtained. The measurements of the energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) and XRD indicated that there was no Sn in the Pt/C catalyst. In order to check if H 2 PtCl 6 can be completely reduced with SnCl 2 , the reaction of H 2 PtCl 6 and SnCl 2 was traced by in situ UV\u2013vis absorption spectroscopy using a Perkin-Elmer UV-2200 UV\u2013vis recording spectrophotometer. The scan range was 200\u2013500 nm and the scan rate was 0.2 nm s \u22121 . 0.240 mL 41.2 mM SnCl 2 in methanol was dropwise added into 2.47 mL of 2.0 mM H 2 PtCl 6 in methanol. The measurement of the UV\u2013vis absorption spectra of H 2 PtCl 6 was carried out after every addition of 10 \u03bcL SnCl 2 solution. XRD patterns of the catalysts were obtained with a Japanese Rigaku D/max-rC X-ray diffractometer using Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The TEM measurements were carried out with a JEM-2010 instrument with a point resolution of 0.14 nm. XPS measurements were performed with an Escalab Mark II spectrometer (VG Scientific Ltd., England) using Mg K\u03b1 radiation with a mean energy of 1253.6 eV. The binding energy was calibrated with respect to C 1s at 284.6 eV with \u00b10.2 eV accuracy. The experimental data were curve-fitted with Gaussian peaks after subtracting a linear background. The surface concentrations of the different species were estimated from the integrated area under the respective Gaussian peaks. 2.2 Electrode preparation and electrochemical measurements The Pt/C catalyst electrode was prepared using the method reported by Schmidt et al . [45] . Firstly, a glassy carbon electrode (4 mm in diameter) was successively polished with the slurry of 0.5 and 0.03 \u03bcm alumina. Then, it was sonicated and washed with triply distilled water. 6.6 mg Pt/C catalyst and 3.3 mL water were mixed ultrasonically. 8.8 \u03bcL ink of the Pt/C catalyst obtained was transferred onto the freshly polished glassy carbon electrode. After water was evaporated at 60 \u00b0C in a N 2 atmosphere, 4.4 \u03bcL 5 wt% Nafion solution (Aldrich Co.) was sprayed onto the Pt/C catalyst layer. Finally, the electrode was dried at 60 \u00b0C in a N 2 atmosphere. Pt loading was 28.0 \u03bcg cm \u22122 and Nafion film thickness was about 0.1 \u03bcm. Electrochemical measurements were performed using a CHI 600 Potentiostat/Galvanostat and a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell. The counter electrode was a Pt foil. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode and all potentials were quoted with respect to SCE. The Pt/C catalyst electrode prepared was used as the working electrode. The electrolyte solution was the 0.5 M HClO 4 or 0.5 M HClO 4 + 0.5 M CH 3 OH solution. Oxygen was purged from the solution by bubbling with N 2 for 30 min prior to each electrochemical measurement. All the electrochemical experiments were performed at 30 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of Pt/C catalysts Fig. 1 shows the UV\u2013vis absorption spectra of 2.47 mL 2.0 mM H 2 PtCl 6 in methanol measured after every addition of 10 \u03bcL 41.2 mM SnCl 2 in methanol. It can be observed from Fig. 1 that the characteristic absorption peak of H 2 PtCl 6 is located at 263 nm. The absorbance of this peak decreases on adding SnCl 2 . After all the SnCl 2 solution is added, this peak disappears. This shows that H 2 PtCl 6 can be completely reduced with SnCl 2 , forming the Pt sol. It was found that the Pt sol obtained was be stable for months at room temperature, indicating the Pt particles in the sol are small. Methanol is a very good solvent to H 2 PtCl 6 . Yang et al. prepared Pt-Cr/C [46] and Pt-Ni/C [47] in methanol as a solvent through the carbonyl route. Methanol was also used as a reducing agent for H 2 PtCl 6 reduction. Duff et al. [48] and Teranishi et al. [49] prepared a PVP-protected Pt particles using methanol as both the reductant and the solvent. However, in this system, the absorbance of the absorption peak of H 2 PtCl 6 is not decreased before adding SnCl 2 , indicating that methanol is not a reductant for the H 2 PtCl 6 reduction in this method. The XRD patterns of the Pt/C catalysts prepared at the different evaporating temperatures of methanol are shown in Fig. 2 . The characteristic diffraction peaks of the Pt [1 1 1], [2 0 0], [2 2 0], and [3 1 1] crystal faces are clearly observed at the 2 \u03b8 values of ca. 39.8\u00b0, 46.6\u00b0, 67.8\u00b0, and 81.1\u00b0, respectively, in the XRD patterns for all the Pt/C catalysts. The average size and relative crystallinity of the Pt particles in the Pt/C catalyst can be calculated with the method reported in the literature [50,51] . When the evaporating temperatures of methanol are 65, 60, 50, 40, and 30 \u00b0C, the corresponding average sizes of the Pt particles in the Pt/C catalysts are 2.10, 3.18, 3.73, 4.17, and 4.80 nm, respectively, and the relative crystallinities are 0.61, 1.56, 2.32, 2.86, and 3.30, respectively ( Fig. 3 ). It can be clearly observed from Fig. 3 that the average sizes and relative crystallinity of the Pt particles in the Pt/C catalysts gradually decrease with increasing the evaporating temperature of methanol. Fig. 4 shows the TEM images of the Pt/C catalysts and the corresponding histograms of the Pt particle size distribution. The average sizes of the Pt particles in the Pt/C catalysts obtained from TEM images in Fig. 4 are 2.2, 3.2, 3.8, 4.3, and 4.8 nm, respectively, for the evaporating temperatures of methanol of 65, 60, 50, 40, and 30 \u00b0C. This is in the good agreement with the XRD data. In addition, it can be seen from Fig. 4 that the size distribution of the Pt particles in the Pt/C catalysts is narrow. Fig. 5 shows the Pt4f XPS spectra of the Pt/C catalysts with different average sizes of the Pt particles. In each XPS spectrum, two overlapping peaks at about 71 and 75 eV can be observed and belong to the Pt4f 7/2 and Pt4f 5/2 peaks, respectively. In order to compare the contents of Pt with different valences, each Pt4f 7/2 peak should be deconvoluted into three overlapping curves at 71.2, 72.2, and 73.7 eV. They belong to Pt 0 , Pt II and Pt IV , respectively [43] . The contents of Pt with different valences in the different Pt/C catalysts are listed in Table 1 . It can be observed from Table 1 that the Pt 0 content increases and the contents of Pt II and Pt IV decrease with increasing the average size of the Pt particles, illustrating that the Pt particles with small average size are easily oxidized [52,53] . 3.2 Electrochemical measurements Fig. 6 shows the cyclic voltammograms of the Pt/C catalyst electrodes with different average sizes of the Pt particles in a 0.5 M HClO 4 solution. No well-defined hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks are observed from Fig. 5 , suggesting that the Pt particles in the Pt/C catalyst prepared are highly uniform and dispersed [46] . The coulombic charge for the hydrogen desorption obtained from Fig. 6 can be used to calculate the electrochemical active surface (EAS) of the different Pt/C catalysts [54\u201356] . The EAS of the Pt/C catalysts with 2.2, 3.2, 3.8, 4.3, and 4.8 nm average sizes of the Pt particles are 13.54, 20.83, 20.57, 16.45, and 11.49 m 2 g \u22121 Pt, respectively. Thus, the Pt/C catalyst with 3.2 and 3.8 nm average sizes of the Pt particles shows a large EAS. Usually, it is considered that the Pt/C catalyst with a small average size of the Pt particles should possess the largest EAS. However, the XPS measurements indicated that Pt is easily oxidized when the Pt particles are small. The oxidized Pt cannot adsorb hydrogen [57,58] so that EAS of the Pt/C catalyst with 2.2 nm average size of the Pt particles is not the largest among all the Pt/C catalysts. Fig. 7 shows the linear sweep voltammograms of the Pt/C catalyst electrodes with different average sizes of the Pt particles in the 0.5 M CH 3 OH + 0.5 M HClO 4 solution. It can be seen in Fig. 7 that the oxidation peaks of methanol at all the Pt/C catalyst electrodes are located at ca. 0.62 V. However, the peak current densities for methanol oxidation are: 5.11, 8.45, 10.23, 9.07, and 7.69 mA cm \u22122 for 2.2, 3.2, 3.8, 4.3, and 4.8 nm average sizes of the Pt particles, respectively. Fig. 8 shows the relationship between the mass activity of the Pt/C catalysts and the average size of the Pt particles in the Pt/C catalysts. It can be observed from Fig. 8 that the mass activity increases with decrease in the average size of the Pt particles up to 3.8 nm and then decreases with further decrease in the Pt particle size. The above results illustrate that the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt/C catalyst with a 3.8 nm average size of the Pt particles is highest among the five Pt/C catalysts. Fig. 9 shows the chronoamperometric curves for 0.5 M CH 3 OH in a 0.5 M HClO 4 solution for the Pt/C catalysts with different average sizes of Pt particles for 700 s at a fixed potential of 0.6 V. It can be observed from Fig. 9 that the current densities at the Pt/C catalyst electrodes with: 2.1, 3.2, 3.8, 4.3, and 4.8 nm average sizes of the Pt particles at 700 s are: 0.40, 0.99, 2.20, 1.54, and 0.69 mA cm \u22122 , respectively. The results demonstrate that the electrocatalytic stability of the Pt/C catalyst with a 3.8 nm average size of the Pt particles for the methanol oxidation is also the best among the Pt/C catalysts. The reason for above results can be explained as follows. Generally, it is accepted that the rate-limiting step in the methanol oxidation is the oxidation of Pt-COH ad , an adsorbed intermediate of the methanol oxidation [56,57,59,60] . H 2 O can be dissociated and adsorbed on Pt, forming Pt-OH ad . Pt-OH ad can promote the oxidation of Pt-COH ad : Pt-COH ad + Pt-OH ad \u2192 2Pt + CO 2 + 2H + + 2e \u2212 Apparently, the rate of this reaction depends on the proportion and coverage of \u2013COH ad and \u2013OH ad . There are more oxygen-containing groups on the surface of the small Pt particles because Pt is easiloy oxidized when the Pt particles are small [52,53] . The oxygen-containing groups on the surface of the Pt particles would restrain the decomposition/adsorption of methanol in the low potential region, i.e. the formation of \u2013COH ad . Thus, the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt/C catalyst with small Pt particles for methanol oxidation is low. On the contrary, total coverage of COH ad and OH ad is also small when the average size of the Pt particles is too large due to the small electrochemically active surface area as mentioned above. Thus, when the average size of the Pt particles in the Pt/C catalyst is too large, such as 4.8 nm, its electrocatalytic activity is also low. Therefore, the best electrocatalytic activity of the Pt/C catalyst for the methanol oxidation is obtained when the average size of the Pt particles in the Pt/C catalyst would be in the middle, e.g about 3.8 nm. 4 Conclusions In summary, the organic sol method for preparing utrafine transition metal colloid particles reported for the first time by Bonnemann et al. [8] , was improved. The improved organic sol method used SnCl 2 as the reductant and methanol as the organic solvent. Thus, this method is simple and inexpensive. In addition, it was found that the average size of the Pt particles in the Pt/C catalyst could be controlled by controlling the evaporation temperature of the methanol. The size effect of the Pt particles in the Pt/C catalyst on electrocatalytic activity of the Pt/C catalyst for methanol oxidation can be accurately investigated because the Pt/C catalysts with the different average size of the Pt particles were prepared using the same method. The XPS results demonstrated that the small Pt particles are easily oxidized so that the decomposition/adsorption of methanol on the surfaces of the Pt oxides could not occur. Thus, the Pt/C catalyst with small Pt particles shows low electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation. Because the Pt/C catalyst with a large average size of the Pt particles possesses a low specific surface area, the small electrochemically surface area, its electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation is also low. Therefore, only the Pt/C catalyst with a medium average size of the Pt particle sizes, such as about 3.8 nm, shows high electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation.

Starting from a carbon nanotube (CNT) inserted Co MOF, the Co-NC/CNT hybrid with a N-doped carbon nanoframe composed of hollow Co nanoparticles interlinked by CNTs is first synthesized via carbonization. This unique 3D structure is shown to have highly exposed active sites and good conductivity. Most importantly, the Co-NC/CNT hybrid can act as bifunctional catalysts on both anode and cathode for electrochemical water splitting, to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 under a cell voltage as low as 1.625 V.",

Compared to Pt/C, the PtNi icosahedra show 32-fold and 12-fold enhancement in specific and mass activity, respectively. Furthermore, robust durability was also observed in the accelerated durability test. Thus, this PtNi icosahedron is found among the best Pt-based ORR catalysts, moreover, the findings also demonstrate how to mimic active extended surfaces in nanoscale.",

However, the mostly adopted Pd based metallic catalysts are severely suffered from low catalytic efficiency and self-poisoning, owning to the FA dehydration side reaction. Here, we demonstrate firstly that the secret for developing high active and selective Pd towards FAD lies in building abundant Pd-PdO interface at the catalytic surface. Using chemical blocking technique, we identify surface Pd (0) as the active sites for FA adsorption. By combining the density functional theoretical calculations, experiments, and in situ sensitive probes, PdO is found active in fastening the dehydrogenation rate through pulling hydrogen from the reaction intermediates, as well as overcomes CO poisoning by eliminating the self-poisoning dehydration route. Moreover, tetragonal phase PdO/C with minor Pd (0) at the surface is discovered a highly efficient anti-poisoning ...",

        "abstract": "Searching for cost-efficient electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and stability for hydrogen generation by means of water electrolysis would make a great improvement on energy technologies field. Herein, we report a high performance hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts based on sulfur doped Ni5P4 nanoplate arrays grown on carbon paper (S-Ni5P4 NPA/CP). This ternary, robust, monolithic S-Ni5P4 NPA/CP exhibits remarkable performance for HER compared to nickel phosphide and nickel sulfide catalysts. The S-Ni5P4 NPA/CP with ~6% S presents the most promising behavior for water electrolysis applications. Specifically, it shows an onset potential of 6 mV, needing overpotentials (\u03b7) of 56 and 104 mV to attain current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm-2 with a Tafel slope of 43.6 mV dec-1. The turnover frequency of 6% S-Ni5P4 NPA/CP is about 0.11 s-1 at overpotential of 100 mV, which is ca. 10 and 40 times that of Ni5P4 NPA/CP and NiS2 NPA/CP, respectively. It also shows remarkable stability and durability in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Results indicate that S and P tune the electronic properties mutually and produce an active catalyst phase for hydrogen evolution reaction. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations show S-Ni5P4 NPA/CP exhibits only 0.04 eV of hydrogen adsorption free energy(\u0394GH*), which is more suitable than Pt (~ -0.09 eV). We propose that the S-doping not only restrain the surface oxidation and dissolution of S-Ni5P4 NPA/CP in acid solution, but also reduce the \u0394GH*. We believe that our work will provide a new strategy to design transition metal phosphides (TMPs) composite materials for practical applications in catalysis and energy fields.",

        "abstract": "An in situ micro-MEA technique, which could precisely measure the performance of ORR electrocatalyst using Nafion as electrolyte, was designed and compared with regular thin-film rotating-disk electrode (TFRDE) (0.1 M HClO) and normal in situ membrane electrode assembly (MEA) tests. Compared to the traditional TFRDE method, the micro-MEA technique makes the acquisition of catalysts' behavior at low potential values easily achieved without being limited by the solubility of O in water. At the same time, it successfully mimics the structure of regular MEAs and obtains similar results to a regular MEA, thus providing a new technique to simply measure the electrode activity without being bothered by complicated fabrication of regular MEA. In order to further understand the importance of in situ measurement, Fe-N-C as a typical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) free-Pt catalyst was evaluated by TFRDE and micro-MEA. The results show that the half wave potential of Fe-N-C only shifted negatively by -135 mV in comparison with state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts from TFRDE tests. However, the active site density, mass transfer of O, and the proton transfer conductivity are found to strongly influence the catalyst activity in the micro-MEA, thereby resulting in a much lower limiting current density than Pt/C (8.7 times lower). Hence, it is suggested that the micro-MEA is better in evaluating the in situ ORR performance, where the catalysts are characterized more thoroughly in terms of intrinsic activity, active site density, proton transfer, and mass transfer properties.",

To date, most research has been focused on thiol-stabilized gold and silver nanoclusters and their single crystal structures. Here the single crystal copper nanocluster species (Cu(SCHNO)) determined by X-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry is presented. The hexanuclear copper core is a distorted octahedron surrounded by six mercaptobenzoxazole ligands as protecting units through a simple bridging bonding motif. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insight into the electronic structure and show the cluster can be viewed as an open-shell nanocluster. The UV-vis spectra are analyzed using time-dependent DFT and illustrates high-intensity transitions involving primarily ligand states. Furthermore, the as-synthesized copper clusters can serve as promising nonenzymatic sensing materials for high sensitive and selective detection of HO.",

Herein, we resolve these challenges concurrently through chemically activating the molybdenum disulfide (MoS) surface basal plane by doping with a low content of atomic palladium using a spontaneous interfacial redox technique. Palladium substitution occurs at the molybdenum site, simultaneously introducing sulfur vacancy and converting the 2H into the stabilized 1T structure. Theoretical calculations demonstrate the sulfur atoms next to the palladium sites exhibit low hydrogen adsorption energy at -0.02\u2009eV. The final MoS doped with only 1wt% of palladium demonstrates exchange current density of 805\u2009\u03bcA\u2009cm and 78\u2009mV overpotential at 10\u2009mA\u2009cm, accompanied by a good stability.

However, catalysts that are active for both hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions are rare. Herein, we demonstrate that cobalt phosphide (CoP), which was synthesized via the hydrothermal route and has been shown to have hydrogen evolution activity, is highly active for oxygen evolution. A current density of 10 mA cm\u20132 was generated at an overpotential of only 320 mV in 1 M KOH for a CoP nanorod-based electrode (CoP NR/C), which was competitive with commercial IrO2. The Tafel slope for CoP NR/C was only 71 mV dec\u20131, and the catalyst maintained high stability during a 12 h test. This high activity was attributed to the formation of a thin layer of ultrafine crystalline cobalt oxide on the CoP surface.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Here we report a novel Pt catalysts support material, i.e. the resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) resin derived carbon embedded titanium dioxide (TiO 2 @RFC) with well-tuned pore structure and excellent electrical conductivity. The material is synthesized by in-situ polymerization of RF gel with porous texture at the presence of TiO 2 , followed by high temperature pyrolysis. The Pt nanoparticles (NPs) are deposited on the composites carbon material to form the methanol electrooxidation catalysts in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). The optimized Pt/TiO 2 @RFC catalyst possesses a comparably high electrochemical active surface area of 71.6\u00a0m 2 \u00a0g \u22121  (68.3\u00a0m 2 \u00a0g \u22121  for commercial Pt/C), attributed to its smaller Pt NPs size (2.62\u00a0nm) than the commercial Pt/C (2.84\u00a0nm). The maximum current densities during methanol electrooxidation reaction (MOR) for the optimized Pt/TiO 2 @RFC (822.2\u00a0mA\u00a0mg \u22121 ) is 1.4 times higher than commercial Pt/C (344.4\u00a0mA\u00a0mg \u22121 ). Remarkably, after accelerated degradation test through 2000 cyclic voltammetry, the mass activity for Pt/TiO 2 @RFC was well maintained at 689.5\u00a0mA\u00a0mg \u22121 , 3.3 times that of the commercial Pt/C (206.1\u00a0mA\u00a0mg \u22121 , decline of 40.17%). The sustainable electro-catalytic stability of Pt/TiO 2 @RFC for MOR may be ascribed to the unique structure and composition of the supported material, which provides a strong metal-support interaction and significantly suppresses the degradation processes in the long-term cyclic measurements.",

Here, we designed and synthesized a series of Fe-N-C catalysts using ZIF-8 and various iron salts (Fe(acac) 3 , FeCl 3 , Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ) as precusors. We found that the iron precursors, mainly the molecular size, hydrolysis extent, do play a major role in determining the final morphology of Fe, namely forming the Fe-N x  coordination or Fe 3 C nanoparticles, as well as the site density, therefore, significantly affecting the ORR activity. Among the three iron sources, Fe(acac) 3  is most advantageous to the preferential formation of single-atom Fe-N x  active sites and the derived catalyst demonstrated best ORR performance.",

Rechargeable Zn\u2013air battery using NiFe@NCX catalyst exhibited an unprecedented small charge\u2013discharge overpotential of 0.78 V at 50 mA cm\u20132, high reversibility, and stability, holding great promise for the pr...",

Here, we report that the core-shell structured Ni 12 P 5 /Ni 3 (PO 4 ) 2  hollow spheres (Ni 12 P 5 /Ni 3 (PO 4 ) 2 -HS) exhibits high activity and stability towards both HER and OER in strong alkaline media. A current density of 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm \u22122  is generated at an overpotential of 0.114\u00a0V and 0.318\u00a0V in 1\u00a0M KOH for HER and OER, respectively. The high activity is attributed to the hollow core-shell (Ni 12 P 5 /Ni 3 (PO 4 ) 2 ) structure that the material adopts under catalytic conditions. The Ni 12 P 5 /Ni 3 (PO 4 ) 2 -HS can serve as both cathode and anode catalysts for a real water electrolysis cell, which generates a current density of 357.6\u00a0mA\u00a0cm \u22122  at 1.8\u00a0V and stable at 300\u00a0mA\u00a0cm \u22122  for at least 100\u00a0h, the potential catalytic degradation mechanism has been systematically studied and discussed.",

        "abstract": "The hydrogen evolution reaction is a crucial step in electrochemical water splitting. The most efficient catalysts for this reaction in acidic media are Pt based, but the high cost of Pt limits its practical applications. We developed a novel matrix architecture in which a trace amount of Pt is alloyed in situ with Ru nanoparticles uniformly and partially embedded in porous carbon spheres. The synthetic procedure is simple and efficient. Surface enrichment of metallic Pt nanoclusters on PtRu alloy nanoparticles results in weak bonding with hydrogen and rapid hydrated proton dissociation. These effects significantly increase the electrocatalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution process. This robust catalyst, with a Pt loading 99.9% less than that of a commercial Pt-based catalyst, gave a high turnover frequency (4.03 H2 s\u22121), a small Tafel slope (27.2 mV dec\u22121), and comparable overpotentials (19.7 mV and 43.1 mV), as well as achieved current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm\u22122, i.e., better than those obtained with commercial Pt/C catalyst, in 0.5 M H2SO4. This structure prevents nanoparticles from dissolving, agglomerating, and detaching during long-term operation; therefore there was no obvious decrease in catalytic activity after continuous reaction.",

The results show that the CoPS/CP exhibits comparable performance to Pt towards the electrochemical HER with the same catalyst loading. Specifically, in 0.5\u00a0M H2SO4, this sea urchin-like CoPS hybrid exhibits a negligible onset overpotential of \u223c4 mV and a small Tafel slope of 42.6 mV dec\u22121, and the turnover frequency (TOF) reaches as high as 0.18 s\u22121 at an overpotential of 100 mV. Additionally, this CoPS/CP electrode shows excellent catalytic durability (100 hours) under both acidic and basic conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that CoPS exhibits the most suitable hydrogen adsorption free energy (\u22120.12 eV). This work will open an exciting new direction for the rational design and scalable fabrication of easily-prepared, cost-effective, highly active and robust non-noble metal catalysts for energy storage and conversion, and other applications.",

Through successful design and fabrication of the discontinuously covered IrO2\u2013RuO2@Ru (3\u2006:\u20061) supported structure, we are able to combine the high activity of RuO2 and the outstanding stability of IrO2. Specifically, the overpotential of the IrO2\u2013RuO2@Ru (3\u2006:\u20061) catalyst at 10 mA cm\u22122 is only 281 mV, and the turnover frequency (TOF) values of IrO2\u2013RuO2@Ru (3\u2006:\u20061), Ir3RuO2 and IrO2 catalysts are ca. 0.039, 0.023 and 0.017 s\u22121 at 1.55 V, respectively, indicating that IrO2\u2013RuO2@Ru (3\u2006:\u20061) exhibits higher intrinsic activity and the active surface sites possess greater ability to generate oxygen. The excellent durability of the IrO2\u2013RuO2@Ru (3\u2006:\u20061) catalyst is confirmed with the overpotential at 10 mA cm\u22122 positively shifting by only 16 mV after 3000 cycles through accelerated durability tests. Remarkably, the IrO2\u2013RuO2@Ru (3\u2006:\u20061) catalyst exhibits a huge advantage in reducing the use of precious metals in water electrolysis. Hence, the supported iridium\u2013ruthenium bimetallic oxides show huge potential towards an active and stable application for the oxygen evolution reaction in acidic media.",

Despite the inspiring progress made, the performance of the current metal-free carbon catalysts is still far from satisfactory for large-scale applications.

Electrochemical results indicate that the incorporation of sulfur into nitrogen-doped carbon (S-NCx) can dramatically improve the stability of the catalyst by improving the selectivity of O2 electro-reduction to H2O. Density functional theory calculations reveal that sulfur doping lowers the energy barrier of O2(ads) hydrogenation to form OOH(ads), thus leading to enhanced intrinsic activity. In particular, the correlation between ORR activity and nitrogen and sulfur species in these materials is studied in-depth, and it is found the ORR performance of S-NCx catalysts is significantly affected by pyridinic N and C\u2013S\u2013C contents.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nitrogen, iron-codoped ordered mesoporous carbon (NFe-OMC) with bimodal-pores and extremely high BET area was fabricated and investigated as non-platinum catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The catalysts show significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity for ORR in comparison to the doped commercial carbon black. A 4-electron process was shown in domination of the ORR, indicating the direct reduction of O 2  to H 2 O. Moreover, the stability of the catalyst was comparable to the state-of-the-art Pt catalyst, which renders it a promising replacement for Pt. The increase in activity was ascribed to the increase in active site density and more importantly, the increase in activity per active site, which is due to the advanced pore structure of OMCs and the possible desolvation process of O 2  in the micropores.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Herein, a novel binuclear active site structure, Co 2 N x C y , is intentionally designed and successfully fabricated to efficiently catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is achieved by precisely controlling the atomic scale structure of bimetal-organic frameworks before pyrolysis. Through discovering a two-atom site with Co-Co distance at 2.1\u20132.2\u202fA from aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), as well as a novel shortened Co-Co path (2.12\u202fA) from the X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we for the first time identified the binuclear Co 2 N X  site in the pyrolyzed catalyst. Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the structure is further confirmed as Co 2 N 5 . Excitingly, the Co 2 N 5  site performs approximately 12 times higher activity than the conventional CoN 4  site and the corresponding catalyst shows unprecedented catalytic activity in acidic electrolyte with half-wave potential of 0.79\u202fV, approaching the commercial Pt/C catalyst and presenting the best one among the Co-N-C catalysts. Theoretical density functional theory calculations reveal that the novel binuclear site exhibits considerably reduced thermodynamic barrier towards ORR, thus contributing to the much higher intrinsic activity. Our finding opens up a new path to design efficient M-N x /C catalysts, thus pushing the fuel cell industry field one step ahead.",

Pb and Te, which could facilitate the removal of adsorbed CO-like intermediates via bifunctional mechanisms and adjust the electronic structure of Pt, respectively, were introduced into the alloy NT catalyst. The as-designed alloy NT catalyst with a uniform, ultrathin, and ultralong structure was precisely prepared through the hard template method with pre-synthesized TePb nanowires used as the sacrificial template. The NT catalyst exhibits excellent performances towards methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) both in activity and durability in an acidic medium. Further characterizations reveal that the enhanced performances are attributed to the adjusted electronic and chemical structures of Pt via the interactions among Pt, Te, and Pb according to complex mechanisms, which are illustrated in detail.",

Herein, IrO2@Ir/TiN electrocatalysts employing TiN as the support have been developed and shown highly-efficient towards OER. TiN is found not only dispersing the IrO2@Ir nanoparticles effectively, but also exerting electronic modulation to Ir by downshifting its d-band center of 0.21 eV compared to pure IrO2. Excitingly, TiN remarkably enhances the catalytic performance of Ir, where the overpotential to achieve current density of 10 mA cm-2 is only 265 mV for the IrO2@Ir/TiN (60 wt%) catalyst. As a result, 71.7 wt% of Ir metal can be saved to compare with the commercial Ir-black counterpart. Moreover, TiN can inhibit the aggregation and oxidative dissolution of Ir species, thereby enhancing the operational stability. The combined advantages of TiN open a new solution to reduce the anodic catalyst cost through boosting the catalytic activity and stability.",

        "abstract": "Developing highly efficient, low-cost oxygen reduction catalysts, especially in acidic medium, is of significance toward fuel cell commercialization. Although pyrolyzed Fe-N-C catalysts have been regarded as alternatives to platinum-based catalytic materials, further improvement requires precise control of the Fe-Nx structure at the molecular level and a comprehensive understanding of catalytic site structure and the ORR mechanism on these materials. In this report, we present a microporous metal\u2013organic-framework-confined strategy toward the preferable formation of single-atom dispersed catalysts. The onset potential for Fe-N-C is 0.92 V, comparable to that of Pt/C and outperforming most noble-metal-free catalysts ever reported. A high-spin Fe3+-N4 configuration is revealed by the 57Fe Mossbauer spectrum and X-ray absorption spectroscopy for Fe L-edge, which will convert to Fe2+-N4 at low potential. The in situ reduced Fe2+-N4 moiety from high-spin Ox-Fe3+-N4 contributes to most of the ORR activity due t...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The electrochemical methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is of paramount importance for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) application, where efficient catalysts are required to facilitate the complicated multiple charge transfer process. The catalyst support not only determines the dispersion status of the catalysts particles, but also exerts great influence on the electronic structure of the catalysts, thereby altering its intrinsic activity. Herein, we demonstrated that nitrogen atoms, assisted by the pre-treatment of carbon matrix with oxidants, can be easily doped into carbon nanotubes at low temperature. The obtained nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes can effectively improve the dispersion of the supported platinum nanoparticles and facilitate the MOR by modifying the electronic structure of platinum atoms, through catalyst-support interaction.",

Here we report a very promising ORR catalyst composed of strongly coupled platinum nanotubes and nitrogen-doped graphene (Pt NTs/NG), which was synthesized by in-situ galvanic replacement reaction. The newly developed catalyst shows ultrahigh activity and durability towards ORR in acidic medium. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy together with electrochemical analyses indicated that the greatly enhanced performance is due to the strong interaction between platinum and nitrogen-doped graphene support. This hybrid catalyst system is of great potential for application in proton exchange membrane fuel cell.",

        "abstract": "Direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC) with Pd-based catalyst anode is a promising energy converter to power portable devices. However, its commercialization is entangled with insufficient activity and poor stability of existing anode catalysts. Here we initially report that a DFAFC using facilely synthesized Pd\u2013B/C with ca. 6 at. % B doping as the anode catalyst yields a maximum output power density of 316 mW cm\u20132 at 30 \u00b0C, twice that with a same DFAFC using otherwise the state-of-the-art Pd/C. More strikingly, at a constant voltage of 0.3 V, the output power of the former cell is ca. 9 times as high as that of the latter after 4.5 h of continuous operation. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy is applied to probe comparatively the interfacial behaviors at Pd\u2013B/C and Pd/C in conditions mimicking those for the DFAFC anode operation, revealing that the significantly improved cell performance correlates well with a substantially lowered CO accumulation at B-doped Pd surfaces.",

        "abstract": "PtRu/C material is one of the most well-known and efficient anode catalysts in direct methanol fuel cells. Nevertheless, new anode catalysts with even higher performance and lower cost are highly demanded for the further development of this fuel cell technology. Herein, we present a CoP-promoted Pt catalyst as a highly active, anti-poisoning and low-Pt loading catalyst for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). The in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared radiation absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) technique revealed that the presence of CoP in the Pt-based catalyst can promote the methanol oxidation to CO2. A maximum power density of 88.5 mW cm\u22122 is achieved on a fuel cell based on this novel anode catalyst, which is ca. 1.4 times as high as that based on the state-of-the-art commercial PtRu/C catalyst with the same Pt loading. The present work demonstrates that the Pt\u2013CoP/C will be a very competitive alternative to PtRu/C as the promising anode catalyst for the scale-up production of DMFCs in terms of overall performance and cost effectiveness.",

        "title": "Nanostructured PtRu/C catalyst promoted by CoP as an efficient and robust anode catalyst in direct methanol fuel cells",
        "abstract": "Nanostructured PtRu material is considered as the best catalyst for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), but the performance decay resulting from Ru loss seriously hinders the commercial application. Here we demonstrated that the performance of nanostructured PtRu catalyst for methanol oxidation could be significantly improved by CoP material; the presence of CoP could largely slow down the loss of Ru and Pt in PtRu catalyst system, thus promising a highly active and durable performance in DMFCs. Cyclic Voltammetry results showed the peak current is 2.89 times higher than that of state-of-the-art commercial PtRu/C\u2013JM (231.9 mA mg\u22121PtRu) and 3.86 times higher than that of the home-made reference (PtRu/C\u2013H) catalyst (173.6 mA mg\u22121PtRu); kinetics study probed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed a large reduced charge transfer resistance in the rate determining step. The highest maximum power density was achieved on this novel PtRu\u2013CoP/C catalyst among all the evaluated catalysts at different temperatures. Specifically, a maximum power density of 85.7 mW cm\u22122 achieved at 30 \u00b0C is much higher than that of state-of-the-art commercial PtRu/C catalyst at 70 \u00b0C (63.1 mW cm\u22122). Outstanding catalytic activity and stability observed on this novel PtRu\u2013CoP/C catalyst should be attributed to a synergistic effect between the nanostructured PtRu and CoP, in which the presence of CoP increases PtRu physical stability and anti-CO poisoning ability. The present work is a significant step that opens an avenue in the development of highly active and durable catalysts for fuel cells technology, and makes PtRu catalyst system much closer for commercial application in DMFCs.",

The synthesized electrocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy.

CL roughness and thickness increased with increasing Nafion content. Contact angle measurements determined that CL hydrophilicity also increased as a function of Nafion content. Poor bonding between the CL, microporous layer, and the proton exchange membrane was obtained when the ionomer content was too low. The electrochemical surface areas (ESAs) were found to increase with increasing Nafion content before reaching an asymptote at elevated loading levels. However, upon increasing the ionomer content above 30 wt.%, the water and oxygen mass transfer properties were difficult to control. Considering the above conditions, N30 (30 wt.% Nafion) was found to be the optimal level to effectively extend the three-phase boundaries and enhance cell performance.",

Herein, we demonstrate Fe 2 P as an efficient catalyst promoter in Pd/C catalyst system for formic acid electro-oxidation in fuel cells reactions. Adding Fe 2 P in the Pd/C catalyst system greatly increases the performances for formic acid oxidation by 3\u20134 times; the CO stripping technique displays two kinds of active sites formation in the Pd-Fe 2 P/C catalyst system coming from the interaction of Pd, Fe 2 P and Pd oxide species and both are more efficient for formic acid and CO-species electrooxidation. The smaller charge transfer resistance and Tafel slope for formic acid oxidation indicate the improvements in kinetics by Fe 2 P in the Pd-Fe 2 P/C system. The nanostructured hybrid units of Pd, Fe 2 P and carbon are evidently visible in the high resolution microscopy images and XPS technique confirmes the electronic effect in the catalyst system. The promotion effect of Fe 2 P in the catalyst system arising from the structure, composition and electronic effect changes is discussed with the help from multiple physical and electrochemical techniques. It is concluded that Fe 2 P as a significant catalyst promoter will have potential application in energy transfer related electrochemical reactions.",

Pt@RFC exhibits excellent CO-tolerance and MOR activity, and specifically, the CO electro-oxidation peak-potential is negatively shifted by \u223c150 mV and the electrocatalytic activity is 2 times that of commercial Pt/C. These enhancements are due to the endowed high Pt utilization (decreased particle size) from strong metal-support interaction and the decorated electronic properties. Moreover, the firmly anchored Pt nanoparticles are prevented from possible dissolution, agglomeration and detachment during long-term use. Remarkably, after an accelerated degradation test through a 3000 cycle cyclic voltammetry test, the mass activity for Pt@RFC is well maintained and 5.8 times that of the commercial Pt/C. Upon integration into a DMFC, Pt@RFC (58.5 mW cm\u22122) exhibits a competitive power density at 60 \u00b0C compared to a commercial PtRu/C catalyst (52.3 mW cm\u22122) with only 1/3 of the noble metal loading, as well as a slower degradation rate during discharge testing. The present findings indicate that Pt@RFC might be a viable alternative as a commercial catalyst applied in DMFCs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) are very promising power source for stationary and portable miniature electric appliances due to its high efficiency and low emissions of pollutants. As the key material, catalysts for both cathode and anode face several problems which hinder the commercialization of DMFCs. In this review, we mainly focus on anode catalysts of DMFCs. The process and mechanism of methanol electrooxidation on Pt and Pt-based catalysts in acidic medium have been introduced. The influences of size effect and morphology on electrocatalytic activity are discussed though whether there is a size effect in MOR catalyst is under debate. Besides, the non Pt catalysts are also listed to emphasize though Pt is still deemed as the indispensable element in anode catalyst of DMFCs in acidic medium. Different catalyst systems are compared to illustrate the level of research at present. Some debates need to be verified with experimental evidences.",

The fabrication of healable PEMs that exhibit satisfactory mechanical stability, enhanced proton conductivity, and suppressed methanol permeability via hydrogen-bonding complexation between Nafion and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) followed by postmodification with 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (CBA) molecules is presented. Compared with pure Nafion, the CBA/Nafion-PVA membranes exhibit enhanced mechanical properties with an ultimate tensile strength of \u224820.3 MPa and strain of \u2248380%. The CBA/Nafion-PVA membrane shows a proton conductivity of 0.11 S cm at 80 \u00b0C, which is 1.2-fold higher than that of a Nafion membrane. The incorporated PVA gives the CBA/Nafion-PVA membranes excellent proton conductivity and methanol resistance. The resulting CBA/Nafion-PVA membranes are capable of healing mechanical damage of several tens of micrometers in size and restoring their original proton conductivity and methanol resistance under the working conditions of DMFCs. The healing property originates from the reversibility of hydrogen-bonding interactions between Nafion and CBA-modified PVA and the high chain mobility of Nafion and CBA-modified PVA.",

Herein, we report the tricky Pd catalyst poisoning problem could be greatly depressed by cobalt phosphide (CoP) material during formic acid oxidation, so an extremely active and stable Pd catalyst with very low Pd loading (5 wt%) is realized. The high anti-poisoning ability was evidenced by a significantly faster kinetics study and less poisoning intermediates adsorbed on its surface compared with Pd/C catalyst. When integrated into a real fuel cells model, a power density of 150 mW cm\u22122 catalyzed by this Pd-CoP/C catalyst (5 wt%, Pd) was comparable to that of the commercial Pd/C catalyst (20 wt%, Pd) indicating a very promising application in the electrochemical energy devices. This work opens an avenue to overcome the universal catalyst poisoning issue and pushes Pd catalyst system much stronger for commercial application in fuel cells technology.",

One effective solution to this issue is to develop new types of proton conductive materials that are capable of working in a broad temperature range. A simple vacuum-assisted filtration method is employed to obtain a well-ordered new proton-conducting membrane by immobilizing nanosized bismuth oxide clusters [HBiO] (NO)\u00b76(HO) {HBiO} onto graphene oxide (GO) supports (named as {HBiO}/GO). {HBiO}/GO is stable in acidic media and has high proton conductivity over the temperature range from -40 to 80 \u00b0C. The proton conductivity of the {HBiO}/GO membrane is 0.564 S cm at 80 \u00b0C in aqueous solution (in plane), and 0.1 S cm at 80 \u00b0C and 97% RH (out of plane), respectively. Without loss of high proton conductivity, the membrane also exhibited 100-fold lower methanol permeability than a Nafion 117 membrane. Moreover, {HBiO}/GO displayed good catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and superior humidity response and recovery properties. These advantages mean that {HBiO}/GO holds great promise as a solid-state electrolyte that can potentially be applied in energy conversion devices in the future.",

The growth of NiSe nanowire film on nickel foam (NiSe/NF) in\u2005situ by hydrothermal treatment of NF using NaHSe as Se source is presented. When used as a 3D oxygen evolution electrode, the NiSe/NF exhibits high activity with an overpotential of 270\u2005mV required to achieve 20\u2005mA\u2009cm(-2) and strong durability in 1.0\u2009M KOH, and the NiOOH species formed at the NiSe surface serves as the actual catalytic site. The system is also highly efficient for catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction in basic media. This bifunctional electrode enables a high-performance alkaline water electrolyzer with 10\u2005mA\u2009cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.63\u2005V. ",

We hypothesized that lake nutrients (N and P) and taxonomy strongly affect tissue trace element (Al, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Li, Pb and Sr) composition and homeostasis of submerged macrophytes in Yangtze floodplain lakes and Yunnan plateau lakes (China). Submerged macrophytes had Co stoichiometric homeostasis in these two sets of lakes. Moreover, submerged macrophytes in Yangtze floodplain lakes had higher Cd stoichiometric homeostasis, whereas submerged macrophytes in Yunnan plateau lakes had higher Cr, Li and Pb stoichiometric homeostasis. Lake nutrients altered trace element composition of submerged macrophytes as shown by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Total nitrogen in water (WTN) positively correlated with tissue As and tissue Cd for all lake types, indicating WTN influenced the concentration and composition of tissue As and tissue Cd in submerged macrophytes. Canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) successfully discriminated among submerged macrophyte taxa, revealing there are significant differences in multielement composition of submerged macrophytes among taxonomy. Some similar relationships of taxa and trace elements between Yangtze floodplain lakes and Yunnan plateau lakes indicated that certain families of submerged macrophytes accumulate specific elements. Differences in relationships of taxa and trace elements between Yangtze floodplain lakes and Yunnan plateau lakes indicated that trace element composition of submerged macrophytes could be affected both by taxonomy and the ambient environment.",

        "abstract": "Growth rate hypothesis (GRH) and stoichiometric homeostasis of photoautotrophs have always been questioned. However, little is known about GRH and stoichiometric homeostasis of aquatic plants, especially submerged macrophytes. Therefore, we aim to test the GRH and explore stoichiometric homeostasis of four freshwater submerged macrophytes under eutrophication stress. At the single species level and the multi-species level, N:P ratios of  Potamogeton   maackianus ,  Myriophyllum spicatum ,  Vallisneria natans  and  Ceratophyllum demersum  had no consistent trends with growth rates. However, protein:RNA ratios of  P. maackianus ,  M. spicatum  and  V. natans  all correlated negatively with growth rates, demonstrating GRH can apply to freshwater submerged macrophytes, even though they are threatening by eutrophication stress. Protein:RNA ratios positively correlated with N:P ratios in culture media and tissues in submerged macrophytes except in  P. maackianus  (30d), suggesting effects of varying N:P ratios in culture media on protein:RNA ratios are basically in concert with tissue N:P ratios under short-time eutrophication stress. Stoichiometric homeostasis coefficients ( H  N:P ) indicated submerged macrophytes have weak homeostasis. Stoichiometric homeostasis of  V .  natans  was stronger than those of  P. maackianus ,  M. spicatum  and  C. demersum . The differences in GRH and homeostasis of the four submerged macrophytes may be due to species traits.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the combined effects of varying dissolved CO concentration (ambient CO, 3\u02dc17 \u03bcmol L, elevated CO, 48\u02dc81 \u03bcmol L) and light intensity (high light, c. 150 \u03bcmol photon\u2009m s, low light, c. 25 \u03bcmol photon\u2009m s) on the bioaccumulation and phytotoxicity of cadmium (Cd) in a macrophyte Potamogeton crispus, under constant Cd exposure. The data confirmed that 100 \u03bcM Cd led to adverse changes in morphology, ultrastructure and biochemistry in P. crispus. The toxic effects depended strongly on CO concentration and light intensity: elevated CO and high light both increased Cd concentrations in P. crispus, and there was a significant interaction between the two factors. Compared to high light grown plants, the photochemical efficiency and chlorophyll content of low light grown P. crispus were much less affected and the MDA content was lower, when exposed to 100 \u03bcM Cd. In addition, an antioxidative response was observed with a significant increase in SOD, POD and GST activities, indicating that low light grown P. crispus are more protected against Cd toxicity. When compared with ambient CO concentrations, chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthetic rate and starch content, as well as the activity of SOD and GST, were significantly enhanced in Cd treated P. crispus under elevated CO. This suggests that elevated CO reduced Cd toxicity in P. crispus by increasing photosynthesis and enhancing the antioxidant system. Moreover, the statistical results showed that dissolved CO and light had additive effects on Cd toxicity in P. crispus, reflected by the physiological parameters of total chlorophyll content, SOD activity and MDA content, indicating that the combination of high CO and low light produced more protection against Cd toxicity than did the factors alone. Based on the results of this study, it appears clear that referring to a specific site in aquatic ecosystem, dissolved CO concentration and light availability should be considered when assessing and managing Cd impacts on aquatic plants.",

        "abstract": "It remains an open question whether or not artificial macrophytes are good alternatives to natural macrophytes in studies of periphyton abundance and composition in lakes. Here, a mesocosm experiment was conducted in winter (when plant growth is low) to compare simultaneously the periphyton community on three submerged macrophytes (Potamogeton lucens, Vallisneria sp. and Cabomba caroliniana) with contrasting leaf structural complexities (leaf fractal dimension\u00a0=\u00a01.12, 1.17 and 1.37, respectively) and on three types of artificial macrophytes with similar morphologies as the natural plants. We also compared intertreatment differences in phytoplankton sampled from mesocosms.Both for natural and artificial macrophytes, the periphyton chlorophyll a (Chl-a) was positively associated with leaf fractal dimension. Although the morphological structure of natural and artificial plants and the physicochemical characteristics of the water were similar, the periphyton community differed between natural and artificial macrophytes, with the difference being dependent on the leaf structural complexity of the macrophytes. For leaves with a simple structural complexity, the abundance and composition of periphyton on natural and artificial plants were not statistically different. In addition, periphyton Chl-a, density and biovolume were higher on the adaxial side than on the abaxial side of natural P.\u00a0lucens leaves, but no differences were found between sides of the artificial leaves.For leaves with a medium structural complexity, the abundance of periphyton was lower on the natural than artificial plants, and the proportion of diatoms to the total community differed. For leaves with a high structural complexity, periphyton Chl-a of the artificial plants was notably higher than on the natural plants, while no significant differences were found for periphyton density, biovolume, and the proportion of diatoms and green algae.Permutational multivariate analysis of periphyton genus composition confirmed that periphyton composition on the artificial plants (medium and high leaf structural complexities) was different overall from that on the natural plants.Phytoplankton Chl-a, density, biovolume, and diversity did not show any pronounced differences among treatments.Our results suggest that artificial macrophytes cannot fully substitute for natural plants even when they are morphologically similar. Artificial macrophytes should therefore be used with caution when investigating the periphyton community on macrophytes.",

        "abstract": "Water resources have an important role in maintaining ecological fuctions and sustaining social and economic development. This is especially true in arid and semi-arid areas, where climate change has a large impact on water resources, such as in Xinjiang, China. Using a combination of precipitation and temperature bias correction methods, we analyzed projected changes in different hydrological components in nine high-alpine catchments distributed in Xinjiang using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The impacts of elevation, area and aspect of the catchments were analyzed. The results suggested an overall warming and wetting trend for all nine catchments in the near future, with the exception of summer precipitation decreasing in some catchments. The total runoff discharge, evapotranspiration and snow/ice melting will generally increase. Warming temperature plays a more important role in the changes of each hydrological component than increasing precipitation. However, northern Xinjiang was more sensitive to predicted precipitation changes than southern Xinjiang. These results also indicate that the overall increases in water resources are not sustainable, and the impacts of climate change are associated with the elevation, area and slope aspect of the catchments.",

In this research, regions around Tianchi Lake were taken as a case study to explore the relation between the urban air pollution and alpine lake water quality. Multi-scale station observed data were analyzed for the urban NO pollution by means of relevance analysis and trend analysis, the field measured data were analyzed for the lake total nitrogen (TN) pollution using multiple methods including the water quantity and quality balance, remote sensing retrieval and nutrient load assessment. The sources and occurrence conditions of atmospheric pollution and lake pollution were identified by a multi-method driving factor analysis. As a result, there is sufficient direct and indirect evidence to prove that the serious air pollution in surrounding cities is an important cause of the nitrogen pollution in Tianchi Lake.",

        "abstract": "Urea is a widespread organic pollutant, which can be a nitrogen source, playing different roles in the growth of submerged macrophytes depending on concentrations, while high cadmium (Cd) concentrations are often toxic to macrophytes. In order to evaluate the combined effect of urea and Cd on a submerged macrophyte, Cabomba caroliniana, the morphological and physiological responses of C. caroliniana in the presence of urea and Cd were studied. The results showed that high concentrations of urea (400mgL) and Cd (500\u00b5molL) had negative effects on C. caroliniana. There were strong visible symptoms of toxicity after 4 days of exposure under Cd-alone, 400mgL urea, and Cd+400mgL urea treatments. In addition, 400mgL urea and Cd had adverse effects on C. caroliniana's pigment system. Significant losses in chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic rates, as well as Rubisco activity were also observed under Cd-alone, 400mgL urea, and Cd+400mgL urea treatments. 400mgL urea markedly enhanced Cd toxicity in C. caroliniana, reflected by a sharp decrease in photosynthetic activity and more visible toxicity symptoms. The results of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) pointed to extreme oxidative stress in C. caroliniana induced under Cd or 400mgL urea exposure. Exogenous ascorbate (AsA) protected C. caroliniana from adverse damage in 400mgL urea, which further corroborated the oxidative stress claim under 400mgL urea. However, results also demonstrated that lower urea concentration (10mgL) alleviated Cd-induced phytotoxicity by stimulating chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthetic activity, as well as activating the activity of catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), which may explain the alleviating effect of urea on C. caroliniana under Cd stress.",

        "abstract": "What is the central question of this study? Renal ischaemia-reperfusion injury occurs in various clinical settings. The clinical diagnosis of ischaemia-reperfusion injury is routinely based on biochemical and haematological tests, which cannot evaluate the function of a single kidney. New magnetic resonance imaging techniques to identify the pathophysiological changes in the renal outer medulla were evaluated. What is the main finding and its importance? This study demonstrated that susceptibility-weighted imaging is a feasible non-invasive tool for imaging and evaluating physipathological changes in the renal outer medulla after ischaemia-reperfusion injury. The aim was to evaluate the feasibility of susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) as a tool to identify the changes in the renal outer medulla (OM) in a rabbit model of renal ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). New Zealand rabbits were used (control group n\u00a0=\u00a010; IRI group n\u00a0=\u00a040). The rabbits in the IRI group were subjected to left renal artery clamping for 60\u00a0min. T2-weighted (T2WI) and SWI examinations were performed at 1, 12, 24 or 48\u00a0h after reperfusion (each n\u00a0=\u00a010). After the examinations, the kidneys were submitted to histological evaluation. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for the left renal OM was measured using T2WI and SWI. The T2WI and SWI scores of the integrity of the renal OM were evaluated. There were significant differences between T2WI CNRs and SWI CNRs in the control group and the IRI 1, 12 and 48\u00a0h time points (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). No significant difference was found between T2WI and SWI CNRs at IRI 24\u00a0h (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The mean SWI scores of renal OM in the IRI 1 and 12\u00a0h subgroups were both significantly lower than that in the control group (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The only significant difference in the mean T2WI scores of renal OM was observed between the control and IRI 1\u00a0h groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Susceptibility-weighted imaging has a significant advantage in evaluation of healthy renal OM over conventional magnetic resonance imaging, and it is a feasible non-invasive tool for imaging and evaluating changes in the renal OM after IRI.",

Palomid 529 disassembled mTORC1/2, causing de-phosphorylation of mTORC1/2 substrates. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) is a primary resistant factor of Palomid 529. Palomid 529-induced 786-O cell apoptosis was sensitized by BRD4 inhibitors or BRD4 silencing, but inhibited with BRD4 over-expression. Palomid 529-induced cytotoxicity in the primary human RCC cells was negatively correlated with BRD4 expression level. In vivo, Palomid 529 i.p. administration inhibited 786-O xenograft tumor growth in SCID mice. Its anti-tumor activity was further sensitized by co-administration of the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1.

        "abstract": "To evaluate the value of combining the detection of intratumoral macroscopic fat and hemorrhage in the differentiation of the benign from malignant solid renal masses.Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), chemical shift (CS)\u2013MRI, and susceptibility-weighted imaging were performed in 152 patients with 152 solid renal masses, including 48 benign and 104 malignant masses all pathologically confirmed. The presence of macroscopic fat detected by CS-MRI and hemorrhage detected by susceptibility-weighted imaging were evaluated in all masses. The rates of macroscopic fat and hemorrhage observed between benign and malignant masses were compared by a \u03c72 test. All masses found to contain macroscopic fat with or without hemorrhage were considered to be benign. The remaining masses (without macroscopic fat) found not to contain hemorrhage were considered to be benign. Only those found to contain hemorrhage alone were considered to be malignant. The evaluation indexes for differentiating and forecasting the benign and malignant masses were calculated.Significant differences in the rate of macroscopic fat (observed in 85.42% of benign masses vs. 0% of malignant masses) and hemorrhage (observed in 4.17% of benign masses vs. 95.19% of malignant masses) were measured in the benign and malignant groups (P\u200au003c\u200a0.005, for both). The 41 masses containing macroscopic fat with or without hemorrhage and 11 masses containing neither macroscopic fat nor hemorrhage were considered to be benign. The 100 masses containing no macroscopic fat and only hemorrhage were considered to be malignant. By combining the results for the macroscopic fat and hemorrhage, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the differential diagnosis of the benign and malignant masses were 96.05%, 95.19%, and 97.92%, respectively, and the accuracy and error rate of forecasting the benign and malignant masses were 95.39% and 4.61%, respectively.Combining the detection intratumoral macroscopic fat and hemorrhage can be used to differentiate the benign from malignant solid renal masses.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the feasibility of susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) as a tool to identify the changes in the renal outer medulla (OM) in a rabbit model of renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). New Zealand rabbits were used in this study (control\u00a0=\u00a010 and IRI groups\u00a0=\u00a040). The rabbits in the IRI group were subjected to left renal artery clamping for 60\u00a0minutes. T2-weighted (T2WI) and SWI examinations were performed at 1\u00a0h, 12\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h after reperfusion (each n\u00a0=\u00a010). After the examinations, nephrectomy was performed for histologic evaluation. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for the left renal OM was measured using T2WI and SWI. The T2WI and SWI scores of the integrities of renal OM were evaluated. There were significant differences between T2WI CNRs and SWI CNRs at the control and IRI 1\u00a0h, 12\u00a0h, 48\u00a0h groups (all P\u00a0 \u00a00.05). The mean SWI scores of renal OM in the IRI 1\u00a0h and 12\u00a0h groups were both significantly lower than that in the control group (all P\u00a0u003c\u00a00.05). The only significant difference of the mean T2WI scores of renal OM was observed between the control and IRI 1\u00a0h groups (P\u00a0u003c\u00a00.05). SWI has a significant advantage in evaluating healthy renal OM over conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and it can be a feasible noninvasive tool for imaging and evaluating changes in the renal OM after IRI.This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) carries the worst prognosis and caused one of the highest cancer-related mortalities. Dendritic cell (DC) vaccination is a promising cancer immunotherapy; however, the clinical outcomes are often poor. The administration route of DC vaccine can significantly alter the anti-tumor immune response. Here we report on the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses induced by DC vaccination administered via intraperitoneal (IP) for murine PDAC, and the longitudinal assessment of tumor growth and therapeutic responses using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study, we established murine orthotopic Panc02 models of PDAC and delivered apoptotic Panc02 cell-pulsed DCs via IP injection. The migration of Panc02-pulsed DCs into spleens significantly increased from 6 h to 12 h after initiation of treatment ( = 0.002), and Panc02-pulsed DCs injected via IP induced a significantly higher level of CTL responses against Panc02 cells compared to unpulsed DCs. Tumor size and tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were measured on MR images. Tumor sizes were significantly smaller in the treated mice than in the untreated mice ( < 0.05). The reduction of tumor ADC was less in the treated mice than in the untreated mice ( < 0.05), and the changes in tumor ADC showed significant negative correlation with the changes in tumor volume ( = -0.882, 95% confidence interval, -0.967 to -0.701,  < 0.0001). These results demonstrated the efficacy of DC vaccination administered via IP injection in murine PDAC, and the feasibility of ADC measurement as an imaging biomarker for assessment of therapeutic responses in immunotherapy.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the relationships between magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) imaging biomarkers and the stages of liver fibrosis in a rabbit model of liver fibrosis, a longitudinal validation for clinical translation. Liver fibrosis was induced in 38 male New Zealand rabbits by weekly subcutaneous injections of 0.1 ml 50% carbon tetrachloride oily solution per kilogram of body weight for 4 to 10 weeks to produced varying degrees of liver fibrosis. The values for the liver stiffness (LS) MRE imaging biomarkers were measured at different stages of liver fibrosis. Masson trichrome staining of liver tissue was used to identify collagen tissue. Among the 38 rabbits, the histological studies showed liver fibrosis stage 1 (F1, n = 11), liver fibrosis stage 2 (F2, n = 8), liver fibrosis stage 3 (F3, n = 7), and liver fibrosis stage 4 (F4, liver cirrhosis, n = 12). Additional healthy rabbits served as controls (F0, n = 15). During liver fibrosis progression, the mean LS values increased during liver fibrosis progression. There were significant differences in LS values between (F0 and F1) and (F2 and F3), (F2 and F3) and (F4), and (F0 and F1) and (F4), which are three clinically relevant fibrosis groups. There was a high correlation between the LS values measured by MRE and the stages of liver fibrosis determined by histology (R = 0.67, P < 0.001). MRE imaging has the potential to serve as a noninvasive, unenhanced imaging technique for liver fibrosis diagnosis and staging.",

Core-valence correlation and scalar relativistic corrections were taken into account. The extrapolation to the complete basis set limit was done. The spectroscopic parameters and vibrational properties were obtained. The transition dipole moments were calculated. Franck-Condon factors of some transitions were evaluated. The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect on the spectroscopic parameters and vibrational properties is tiny and sometimes even can be negligible. The results determined in this paper can provide some powerful guidelines to observe these states, in particular the states which have not been studied in the experiment.",

These calculations are conducted using the valence internally contracted multireference configuration interaction and the Davidson correction approach. Core-valence correlation and scalar relativistic corrections are taken into account. The potential energies are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. The spin-orbit coupling is computed using the state interaction approach with the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian. We found that the X\u00b9\u03a3\u207a ('' = 0-23) and a\u00b3\u03a3\u207a (' = 0-2) states of SiN are stable at the computed adiabatic electron affinity value of 23,262.27 cm for SiN. Based on the calculated potential energy curves, the spectroscopic parameters and vibrational levels were determined for all stable and metastable \u039b-S and \u03a9 states. The computed adiabatic electron affinity of SiN and the spectroscopic constants of SiN (X\u00b9\u03a3\u207a) are all in agreement with the available experimental data.

Calculations of the transition dipole moment of a\u00b3\u03a3\u207a\u2081 to X\u00b9\u03a3\u207a are shown. Franck-Condon factors, Einstein coefficients, and radiative lifetimes of the transition from the a\u00b3\u03a3\u207a\u2081 (' = 0-2) to the X\u00b9\u03a3\u207a state are evaluated.",

The calculations are done using the CASSCF method, which is followed by the valence internally contracted MRCI approach. The rotationless radiative lifetimes of the vibrational levels are approximately 10-10\u202fs for the C\u03a0, D\u03a0, and E\u0394 states, 10-10\u202fs for the A\u03a3 state, and 10-10\u202fs for the B\u03a3 state. The origins of the vibronic bands and the radiative lifetimes agree well with the available experimental and other theoretical results. The Einstein coefficients of many vibronic emissions are large for the C\u03a0-X\u03a0, C\u03a0-A\u03a3, D\u03a0-X\u03a0, D\u03a0-A\u03a3, and E\u0394-X\u03a0 transitions and therefore, these transitions are strong. The emissions of the E\u0394-D\u03a0 system are so weak that it is difficult to measure them through spectroscopy. The spectral distribution of the vibronic emissions is evaluated for the transitions of 12 pairs of states. In terms of the radiative lifetimes and transition probabilities obtained here, several spectroscopic routines for observing these states via spectroscopy are proposed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This work studied the variation in spectral emissivity with growth of oxide layer at the different temperatures. For this reason, we measured the normal spectral emissivity during the growth of oxide layer on the sample surface at a wavelength of 1.5\u202f\u03bcm over a temperature range 800\u20131100\u202fK. In the experiment, the temperature was measured by the two thermocouples, which were symmetrically welded onto the front surface of specimens. The average of their readings was regarded as the true temperature. The detector should be perpendicular to the specimen surface as accurately as possible. The variation in spectral emissivity with growth of oxide layer was evaluated at a certain temperature. Altogether 11 emissivity models were evaluated. The conclusion was gained that the more the number of parameters used in the models was, the better the fitting accuracy became. On the whole, all the PEE models, the four-parameter LEE model and the five-parameter PFE, PLE and LEE models could be employed to well fit this kind of variation. The variation in spectral emissivity with temperature was determined at a certain thickness of oxide film. Almost all the models studied in this paper could be used to accurately evaluate this variation. The approximate models of spectral emissivity as a function of temperature and oxide-layer thickness were proposed. The strong oscillations of spectral emissivity were observed, which were affirmed to arise from the interference effect between the two radiations stemming from the oxide layer and from the substrate. The uncertainties in the temperature of steel 430 generated only by the surface oxidization were approximately 4.1\u201310.7\u202fK in this experiment.",

The spectroscopic parameters and vibrational levels are determined. The spin\u2013orbit coupling effect on the spectroscopic parameters and vibrational levels is evaluated. To better study the transition probabilities, the transition dipole moments are computed. The Franck\u2013Condon factors and Einstein coefficients of some emissions are calculated. The radiative lifetimes are determined for a number of vibrational levels of several states. The transitions between different \u039b\u2013S states are evaluated. Spectroscopic routines for observing these states are proposed. The spectroscopic parameters, vibrational levels, transition dipole moments, and transition probabilities reported in this paper can be considered to be very reliable and can be used as guidelines for detecting these states in an appropriate spectroscopy experiment, especially for the states that were very difficult to observe or were not detected in previous experiments.",

The transition dipole moments between them are computed. The rotationless radiative lifetimes of the vibrational levels are found to be approximately several \u00b5s for the d 1 \u03a3 +  and g 1 \u03a3 \u2212  states, on the order of several hundred ns for the e 1 \u03a0 state, and one-tenth to several \u00b5s for the deep well of the f 1 \u0394 state. These results suggest that the spontaneous emissions originated from these states occur readily. The rotationless radiative lifetimes of the vibrational levels are on the order of 10\u2013100\u00a0\u00b5s for the c 1 \u0394 state, 1000\u00a0\u00b5s for the vdW minimum of the f 1 \u0394 state, and 10\u20131000\u00a0\u00b5s for the b 1 \u03a0 state. In addition, the rotationless radiative lifetimes of these states decrease with the increasing vibrational level. This result suggests that the spontaneous emissions generated from these states at lower levels should be difficult to occur. The Einstein coefficients of spontaneous emissions from the d 1 \u03a3 + \u2013a 1 \u03a3 + , d 1 \u03a3 + \u2013b 1 \u03a0, e 1 \u03a0\u2013a 1 \u03a3 + , e 1 \u03a0\u2013b 1 \u03a0, and g 1 \u03a3 \u2212 \u2013b 1 \u03a0 systems, as well as from the f 1 \u0394 state to the b 1 \u03a0 and c 1 \u0394 states are large, indicating that the emissions of these systems can be measured readily via spectroscopy. The Einstein coefficients of the e 1 \u03a0\u2013d 1 \u03a3 +  transition are very small and the emissions originating from the vdW minimum of the f 1 \u0394 state are very weak, predicting that these transitions are very difficult to be detected in spectroscopy experiments.",

The rotationless radiative lifetimes of the vibrational levels are in the order of 10 \u22125 \u202fs for the A 3 \u03a3 \u2212  state, 10 \u22125 \u201310 \u22126 \u202fs for the B 3 \u03a3 +  state, and 10 \u22126  to 10 \u22127 \u202fs for the C 3 \u03a0 and E 3 \u03a0 states.

The spectral range of the strong emissions from the A 3 \u03a3 \u2212 \u2013X 3 \u03a0 system is in the infrared region.

        "abstract": "The spectroscopic properties of nineteen \u03a9 states generated from the eight \u039b-S bound states of SiN radicals are studied in detail using an ab initio quantum chemical method for the first time. The potential energy curves (PECs) are calculated by the complete active space self-consistent field method, which is followed by the internally contracted multireference configuration interaction approach with the Davidson modification (icMRCI+Q). The spin-orbit coupling is accounted for by the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian using the cc-pCVTZ basis set. Scalar relativistic correction calculations are made using the third-order Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian approximation at the level of a cc-pV5Z basis set. Core-valence correlation corrections are included with a cc-pCVTZ basis set. All the PECs are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. The convergent behavior is discussed with respect to the basis set and level of theory. The effect of core-electron correlations on the energy splitting is studied. Using the PECs, the spectroscopic parameters of twelve \u039b-S and nineteen \u03a9 bound states are evaluated. At the icMRCI+Q/CV+DK+56 theoretical level, the spin-orbit coupling splitting energy of the A\u2009\n                        2 \u03a0\u039b-S state is found to be 88.45 cm-1, which agrees well with the recent measurements of 89.09 cm-1. Moreover, other spectroscopic parameters are also in fair agreement with their respective measurements. The effect of SO coupling on the vibrational levels is discussed. It shows that the spectroscopic parameters of the twelve \u039b-S and nineteen \u03a9 bound states reported here can be expected to be reliably predicted ones.",

Core-valence correlation correction was included at the level of an aug-cc-pCV5Z basis set. The SOC effect was accounted for by the state interaction method with the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian and the all-electron cc-pCV5Z basis set. The PECs of all the states were extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. The spectroscopic parameters were obtained. The vibrational properties of several \u039b-S and \u03a9 states with the relatively shallow wells were evaluated. The SOC effect on the spectroscopic parameters is not obvious for almost all the states. The spectroscopic properties reported in this paper can be expected to be reliably predicted ones.",

Results showed that there are sharp increases of the enrichment factor and the ratio of anthropogenic/total of heavy metals in the sediment profiles during the 2000s, which showed that intensive human activities during city development had greatly affected heavy metals distribution since the 1960s. According to the principal component analysis, sediment textures, redox regimes, and organic matter contents accounted for 45.7, 23.6 and 16.5 % of the total variance of element concentrations, respectively. This study also showed that ecological risk of heavy metals was increased along the Wusuli River and closely related to the water quality of the rivers as their hydrological regimes likely affect wetlands.",

        "abstract": "Peatlands are widely distributed throughout northeast China and form a large carbon (C) pool. The main types include plain wetlands and alpine peatlands. Compared to the former, the historical development and C dynamics of the alpine peatlands are still not well understood. In this study, a total of nine peat cores from the Great Hinggan, Changbai and Fenghuang Mountains were collected and dated by 210Pb and 137Cs techniques. All samples were analysed for organic matter content through loss on ignition (LOI) and three core samples from Motianling peatland were further analysed for total organic carbon (TOC) by elemental analysis. A linear model between LOI and TOC was established as TOC\u00a0=\u00a00.405\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0LOI\u00a0+\u00a00.968 (R 2\u00a0=\u00a00.7828, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) which is recommended for estimating organic C content and assessing C accumulation in the peatlands of northeast China. This conversion equation could lead to a 17.8\u00a0% overestimate of RERCA compared to elemental C determination, but it is preferable to using a conversion coefficient of 0.5, which could result in a 36.3\u00a0% overestimate than elemental analysis. The recent rate of C accumulation (RERCA) in the alpine peatlands is estimated between 128.85 and 203.73\u00a0g C m\u22122 year\u22121 and the average C storage per unit area is calculated as 31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09\u00a0kg C m\u22122 over the past 200\u00a0years. These are significant additions to the plain wetlands and this knowledge is helpful in forming a complete picture of C sequestration in wetlands of this region. Within-site difference for average RERCA reflects the need for a multi-core study of C accumulation in peatlands and between-site comparison of RERCA shows that the average RERCA increases towards the higher latitude. This pattern is mainly controlled by the peatland types. Results here will be useful to evaluate the C sequestration potential in peatlands and improve our understanding the response of alpine peatland ecosystems to projected climate change.",

        "abstract": "Geochemical records from peatlands are important tools for the interpretation of environmental signals preserved in the peat and the understanding anthropogenic impacts on remote mountain regions. In this paper, six Pb-dated peat cores located at 500-1900\u00a0m above sea level (asl) in the Changbai Mountains were used to reconstruct the pollution history over the past 150\u00a0years in northeastern (NE) China. The cores physicochemical parameters and 10 key chemical elements were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Results from loss on ignition (LOI), total organic carbon (TOC), and lithogenic element (Ti, Fe, and Mn) analysis show that the peatlands (Ch, Yc1 and Jb) over 900\u00a0m asl are ombrotrophic and the lower altitude peatlands (Dng, Jc, and Ha) are minerotrophic. There is a decreasing trend of trace element distribution with the altitude, mainly due to the local source input. The content of the magnetic particles and trace elements (Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) as well as their accumulation rates document 150\u00a0years of pollution history in the Changbai Mountain region. There is a significant elevated pattern of the geochemical records after the New China, which might mark the start date of Anthropocene since the 1950s in this region. The peatlands at the lower altitude (i.e., Dng and Ha) record the earliest fingerprints of metal contamination due to the starting period of massive reclaiming and immigrating in the Changbai Mountain region. The major increase of trace elements since the 1980s probably suggests a significant deterioration of the local environment due to the fast industrial and urbanization development after the Reform and Opening up in China.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   China is one of the fastest-growing economies of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and heavy metal emissions have increased in parallel with rapid industrialization and urbanization. Over the last decade, several studies of geochemical records from peat have reconstructed changes in atmospheric metal pollution in China. We review the peat records that detail the history of atmospheric metal pollution over the last two centuries in NE China. The ecological risk (ER) of accumulated metals and their potential eco-toxicological effects, through threshold and probable effect concentrations (TEC and PEC), are also evaluated. Peat records of metals show an increase of pollution loads in the environment over the pre-industrial level during the past two centuries, with an unprecedented increase in China over the last 60\u202fyears. There is generally good agreement between geochemical peat records from NE China and others records elsewhere in China. However, some discrepancies are observed especially with Hg records from lake sediments. These discrepancies could be explained by several factors, including post-depositional processes or uncertainties arising from dating methods. The ecological risk of heavy metals is found to be relatively weak in the remote and high-altitude environment in NE China. Although, most metals are under the TEC, Pb concentrations usually surpass it and are getting close to the PEC which indicates increasing ecological risks. Some areas of improvement have been highlighted such as the need for more long-term studies on atmospheric metals and a greater number of Pb isotopes records to better capture the long history of human activity and the spatial variability in metal deposition of the region.",

Peatlands were initiated early and are widely distributed across the SJP and form a large carbon (C) pool. Consequently, there is a growing interest in understanding past, present, and future peatland dynamics. Most studies on peatland dynamics have been carried out on boreal and subarctic region; however, there are limited data about peatland dynamics on temperate region, such as SJP wetland, which is sensitive to climate change and human disturbance. Here, we presented a data synthesis of basal peat ages, peatland area, and peat C accumulation rate in the SJP to examine Holocene peatland dynamics and climate sensitivity, along with total C storage and their future fate. We show that peatland initiation in the SJP started in the early Holocene, but the most intense period of peatland initiation occurred during the late Holocene, when the climate was colder and drier than the early and mid-Holocene. And the C accumulation rate ...",

In this study, we present numerous physical and biological indices for a 4000-year core from the Honghe National Natural Reserve (HE), a dish-like depression peatland in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China. The history of vegetation change was reconstructed by combining plant macrofossils and pollen data from the core, and the water level changes were reconstructed through a multi-proxy study of plant macrofossils, charcoal, stable carbon isotopes, testate amoebae, sediment grain size, loss on ignition, humification degree and magnetic susceptibility. We found that the HE peatland featured wet condition from 4000 to 3600\u00a0cal\u00a0yr BP, which was in accordance with the extreme flooding event at 4.0 ka in northern China. Significant drier shifts were recorded at 3600 and 1200\u00a0cal\u00a0yr BP, while significant wetter shifts were recorded at 2600 and 500\u00a0cal\u00a0yr BP. Factor analysis were applied to all of the proxies to reduce the seven variables to two factors, and the biological indicators, such as plant macrofossils, charcoal and stable carbon isotopes, were found to be more sensitive than the other parameters to water level changes over the last 4000 years. Furthermore, the multi-proxy reconstruction of the wetness of the HE peatland resembles the pattern observed at other sites in Northeast China.",

In this study, nitrate-contaminated wastewater was treated effectively through simultaneous autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification based on micro-electrolysis carriers (MECs) and retinervus luffae fructus (RLF), respectively. The average nitrate and total nitrogen removal rates reached 96.3 and 94.0% in the MECs/RLF-based autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification (MRAHD) system without ammonia and nitrite accumulation. The performance of MRAHD was better than that of MEC-based autotrophic denitrification for the wastewater treatment with low carbon nitrogen (COD/N) ratio. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) revealed that the relative abundance of nirS-type denitrifiers attached to MECs (4.9%) and RLF (5.0%) was similar. Illumina sequencing suggested that the dominant genera were Thiobacillus (7.0%) and Denitratisoma (5.7%), which attached to MECs and RLF, respectively. Sulfuritalea was discovered as the dominant genus in the middle of the reactor. The synergistic interaction between autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers played a vital role in the mixotrophic substrate environment.",

The results showed that P was precipitated by Fe(III) dissolved from the galvanic cell reactions in the IRS and the reaction was suppressed by the pH and stopped when the pH exceeded 8.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09. The adsorption capacity of the IRS decreased by only 4.6% in the second round of adsorption due to Fe(0) consumption in the first round. Substrates with high Ca- and Mg-oxide contents and high Fe- and Al-oxide contents had higher P adsorption capacities at high and low pH values, respectively. Substrates containing high Fe and Al concentrations and low Ca concentrations were more resistant to decreases in the P adsorption capacity resulting from organic matter (OM) accumulation. The IRS with an iron scrap to activated carbon volume ratio of 3:2 resulted in the highest P adsorption capacity (9.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14\u00a0g\u00a0P\u00a0kg), with minimal pH change and strong adaptability to OM accumulation. The Fe(0)-rich substrate has the considerable potential for being used as a CW substrate.",

        "abstract": "Hydrogenotrophic denitrification is promising for tertiary nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater. To reveal the influence of residual organics in municipal wastewater on hydrogenotrophic denitrifiers, we adopted high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to examine microbial communities in hydrogenotrophic denitrification enrichments. Using effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant as water source, COD, nitrate and pH were controlled the same except for a gradient of biodegradable carbon (i.e., primary effluent (PE), secondary effluent (SE), or combined primary and secondary effluent (CE)). Inorganic synthetic water (IW) was used as a control. Hydrogenophaga, a major facultative autotroph, accounted for 17.1%, 5.3%, 32.7% and 12.9% of the sequences in PE, CE, SE and IW, respectively, implicating that Hydrogenophaga grew well with or without organics. Thauera, which contains likely obligate autotrophic denitrifiers, appeared to be the most dominant genera (23.6%) in IW and accounted for 2.5%, 4.6% and 8.9% in PE, CE and SE, respectively. Thermomonas, which is related to heterotrophic denitrification, accounted for 4.2% and 7.9% in PE and CE fed with a higher content of labile organics, respectively. In contrast, Thermomonas was not detected in IW and accounted for only 0.6% in SE. Our results suggest that Thermomonas are more competitive than Thauera in hydrogenotrophic denitrification with biodegradable organics. Moreover, facultative autotrophic denitrifiers, Hydrogenophaga, are accommodating to residual organic in effluent wastewater, thus we propose that hydrogenotrophic denitrification is amenable for tertiary nitrogen removal.",

        "abstract": "Combined heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification (HAD) is a sustainable and practical method for removing nitrate from organic-limited wastewater. However, the active microorganisms responsible for denitrification in wastewater treatment have not been clearly identified. In this study, a combined micro-electrolysis, heterotrophic, and autotrophic denitrification (CEHAD) process was established. DNA-based stable isotope probing was employed to identify the active denitrifiers in reactors fed either C-labeled inorganic or organic carbon source. The total nitrogen removal efficiencies reached 87.2-92.8% at a low organic carbon concentration (20 mg/L COD). Real-time PCR analysis of the nirS gene as a function of the DNA buoyant density following ultracentrifugation of the total DNA indicated marked C-labeling of active denitrifiers. High-throughput sequencing of the fractionated DNA in HCO/CHCOO-fed and HCO/CHCOO-fed reactors revealed that Thermomonas-like phylotypes were labeled by C-bicarbonate, while Thauera-like and Comamonas-like phylotypes were labeled by C-acetate. Meanwhile, Arenimonas-like and Rubellimicrobium-like phylotypes were recovered in the \"heavy\" DNA fraction from both reactors. These results suggest that nitrate removal in CEHAD is catalyzed by various active microorganisms, including autotrophs, heterotrophs, and mixotrophs. Our findings provide a better understanding of the mechanism of nitrogen removal from organic-limited water and wastewater and can be applied to further optimize such processes.",

        "abstract": "A combined process between micro-electrolysis and biological denitrification (MEBD) using iron scraps and an activated carbon-based micro-electrolysis carrier was developed for nitrogen removal under a microaerobic condition. The process provided NH4(+)-N and total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiencies of 92.6% and 95.3%, respectively, and TN removal rate of 0.373\u00b10.11kgN/(m(3)d) at corresponding DO of 1.0\u00b10.1mg/L and HRT of 3h, and the optimal pH of 7.6-8.4. High-throughput sequencing analysis verified that dominant classes belonged to \u03b2-, \u03b1-, and \u03b3-Proteobacteria, and Nitrospira. The dominant genera Hydrogenophaga and Sphaerotilus significantly increased during the operation, covering 13.2% and 6.1% in biofilms attached to the carrier in the middle of the reactor, respectively. Autotrophic denitrification contributed to >80% of the TN removal. The developed MEBD achieved efficient simultaneous nitrification and autotrophic denitrification, presenting significant potential for application in practical low organic carbon water treatment. ",

        "abstract": "Autotrophic denitrification has attracted increasing attention for wastewater with insufficient organic carbon sources. Nevertheless, in situ identification of autotrophic denitrifying communities in reactors remains challenging. Here, a process combining micro-electrolysis and autotrophic denitrification with high nitrate removal efficiency was presented. Two batch reactors were fed organic-free nitrate influent, with HCO and HCO as inorganic carbon sources. DNA-based stable-isotope probing (DNA-SIP) was used to obtain molecular evidence for autotrophic denitrifying communities. The results showed that the nirS gene was strongly labeled by HCO, demonstrating that the inorganic carbon source was assimilated by autotrophic denitrifiers. High-throughput sequencing and clone library analysis identified Thiobacillus-like bacteria as the most dominant autotrophic denitrifiers. However, 88% of nirS genes cloned from the C-labeled \"heavy\" DNA fraction showed low similarity with all culturable denitrifiers. These findings provided functional and taxonomical identification of autotrophic denitrifying communities, facilitating application of autotrophic denitrification process for wastewater treatment.",

        "title": "An integrated O/A two-stage packed-bed reactor (INT-PBR) for total nitrogen removal from low organic carbon wastewater",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Total nitrogen (TN) removal from low organic carbon wastewater is challenging. Traditional heterotrophic denitrification requires additional organics as electron donors, potentially increasing the operational challenges and costs of wastewater treatment. Especially for decentralized domestic sewage in rural areas, it is essential to develop an economical and efficient integrated reactor to satisfy high TN removal demand. This study presents an integrated O/A two-stage packed-bed reactor (INT-PBR) composed of two concentric zones, with total effective volume of 30.6\u00a0L. Influent is pumped into the inner oxic (O) zone for nitrification, then flows through the outer anoxic (A) zone for denitrification. Iron\u2013carbon micro\u2013electrolysis carriers (IC-MECs), which provide H 2 /[H] and Fe 2+  as inorganic electron donors for autotrophic denitrifiers, and luffa cylindrical sponge (LCS), which provides slow\u2013release organic carbon for heterotrophic denitrifiers, were placed into the A zone to achieve combined heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification (HAD) without requiring organic carbon in influent. Thus, the INT-PBR involves no return sludge and internal recycle. Using organic-free synthetic wastewater with 39.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.74\u00a0mg/L NH  4   + -N, approximately 98% of ammonia in influent was transferred to nitrate in the O zone, and approximately 93% of TN was removed by HAD process at 30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C in the A zone. Microbial community analysis showed that autotrophic denitrifiers (e.g.,  Thiobacillu s) and heterotrophic/mixotrophic denitrifiers (e.g.,  Hydrogenophaga ) were combined in the reactor, consistent with the performance findings. The results suggest a promising technology for total nitrogen removal from wastewater with low organic carbon.",

        "abstract": "Nitrogen pollution in ground and surface water significantly affects the environment and its organisms, thereby leading to an increasingly serious environmental problem. Such pollution is difficult to degrade because of the lack of carbon sources. Therefore, an electrochemical and biological coupling process (EBCP) was developed with a composite catalytic biological carrier (CCBC) and applied in a pilot-scale cylindrical reactor to treat wastewater with a carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio of 2. The startup process, coupling principle, and dynamic feature of the EBCP were examined along with the effects of hydraulic retention time (HRT), dissolved oxygen (DO), and initial pH on nitrogen removal. A stable coupling system was obtained after 51\u00a0days when plenty of biofilms were cultivated on the CCBC without inoculation sludge. Autotrophic denitrification, with [Fe2+] and [H] produced by iron\u2013carbon galvanic cells in CCBC as electron donors, was confirmed by equity calculation of CODCr and nitrogen removal. Nitrogen removal efficiency was significantly influenced by HRT, DO, and initial pH with optimal values of 3.5\u00a0h, 3.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121, and 7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1, respectively. The ammonia, nitrate, and total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiencies of 90.1 to 95.3\u00a0%, 90.5 to 99.0\u00a0%, and 90.3 to 96.5\u00a0% were maintained with corresponding initial concentrations of 40\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 (NH3\u2013N load of 0.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0kg NH3\u2013N\u00a0m\u22123\u00a0d\u22121), 20\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121, and 60\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 (TN load of 0.41\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02\u00a0kg TN\u00a0m\u22123\u00a0d\u22121). Based on the Eckenfelder model, the kinetics equation of the nitrogen transformation along the reactor was N  e \u2009=\u2009N  0 exp (\u22120.04368\u00a0h/L1.8438). Hence, EBCP is a viable method for advanced low C/N ratio wastewater treatment.",

Methods: The general self-efficacy scale and autonomous learning scale are used to measure the medical undergraduates. Results: (1) The scale revised of autonomic learning can be divided into two dimensions that cognitive strategy and motivated belief, the former contains two factors that organization strategy and rehearsal strategy, the later contains two factors that self-efficacy and values, (2) There is a difference in values factor score for medical undergraduates of different gender, There are significant differences in all dimensions for medical undergraduates from different regions, Under the test variable that one child or not, there are significant differences for medical undergraduates in all dimensions except for the values factor, There are differences for different school year medical undergraduates in scores of motivation beliefs, rehearsal strategies, self-efficacy and values, (3) There are significant correlations among self-efficacy and autonomous learning strategies along with its various dimensions and factors. Conclusion: Self-efficacy is associated with autonomous learning.",

        "abstract": "HuoXueJieDu (HXJD) formula exerts protective effects against diabetic retinopathy (DR) in rats, but its underlying mechanism remains unknown. In the present study, the diabetic rats were established using streptozocin. The administration of HXJD was initiated at 20 weeks after diabetes induction and continued for 12 weeks. Whole genome expression profiles in rat retinas were examined using microarray technology. Differential gene expression and pathway enrichment analysis were conducted on the microarray data, with validation through real-time PCR and immunohistochemical staining. The results showed that 170 genes and several IPA canonical pathways related to inflammation, matrix metabolism, and phototransduction were regulated by HXJD. PCR validation of selected genes, including SOCS3, STAT3, TIMP1, and A2M, confirmed the gene expression changes influenced by HXJD. In addition, the immunohistochemical staining results suggested that critical members of the SOCS3-STAT3 pathway were also affected by HXJD. Taken together, these results indicated that SOCS3-STAT3 and TIMP1-A2M pathways might mediate the alleviation of HXJD activities in rats with diabetic retinopathy.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a severe complication of diabetes, which seriously affects the life quality of patients. Because of the damage caused by DR, there is an urgent need to develop effective drugs. Folic acid, a water-soluble vitamin, is one of the vitamin B complexes. Folic acid is widely found in the meat and vegetables. In the clinic, low folic acid levels in the body may have a certain correlation with DR. However, there is no relevant basic research proving a relationship between folic acid levels and DR. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether folic acid has a protective effect on the retinal vascular endothelial cells against high glucose levels. Moreover, the molecular mechanism of action of folic acid was further explored. The results showed that folic acid significantly suppressed the cell viability, tube length, migrated cells and the percentage of BrdU\u207a cells compared with the high glucose group. Moreover, folic acid decreased the mRNA expression of TEAD1 and the protein expression of TEAD1 and YAP1. These findings indicate that folic acid can protect retinal vascular endothelial cells from high glucose-induced injury by regulating the proteins in the Hippo signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this research is to investigate the therapeutic effect of GGQL decoction on cardiac dysfunction and elucidate the pharmacological mechanisms. db/db mice were divided into DB group or GGQL group, and WT mice were used as control. All mice were accessed by echocardiography. And the total RNA of LV tissue samples was sequenced, then differential expression genes were analyzed. The RNA-seq results were validated by the results of RT-qPCR of 4 genes identified as differentially expressed. The content of pyruvate and ceramide in myocardial tissue was also measured. The results showed that GGQL decoction could significantly improve the diastolic dysfunction, increase the content of pyruvate, and had the trend to reduce the ceramide content. The results of RNA-seq showed that 2958 genes were differentially expressed when comparing the DB group with the WT group. Among them, compared with the DB group, 26 genes were differentially regulated in the GGQL group. The expression results of 4 genes were consistent with the RNA-seq results. Our study reveals that GGQL decoction has a therapeutic effect on diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricular and the effect may be related to its role in promoting myocardial glycolysis and decreasing the content of ceramide.",

Different from their crystalline counterparts, the effect of residual stress would be worse for amorphous alloys owing to their intrinsic brittleness with low fracture toughness. However, the generation of residual stress and its performance in 3D printed amorphous alloy components still remain unclear. Here, a finite element method combined with experiments and theoretical analyses was introduced to estimate the residual stress in selective laser melting of a Zr-based amorphous alloy. The results revealed that XY cross scanning strategy exhibits relatively low residual stress by comparison with X and Y strategies, and the residual stress becomes serious with increasing bar thickness. The residual stress, on the other hand, could be tuning by annealing or preheating the substrate. The above scenario is thoroughly understood according to the temperature gradient mechanism and its effect on microstructure evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Additive manufacturing is a promising technique for the production of bulk metallic glass (BMG) components without size limitations. However, the current additive manufacturing technique encounters the challenge of micro-cracking induced by huge thermal stress during the process, which significantly degrades the mechanical performance of the components. Based on systematic experiments combined with finite element simulation, we revealed that micro-cracks in inherently brittle Fe-based metallic glass during selective laser melting (SLM) are triggered by highly concentrated thermal stress around micro-pores, which is difficult to avoid during SLM even by careful process optimization. To suppress these micro-cracks, Cu and Cu-Ni alloys with high toughness as second phases were introduced to form BMG composites. The results revealed that the generation of high-density dislocations in second phases during SLM drastically reduce thermal stress by releasing strain energy and thus suppress micro-crack formation. Further investigation has shown that the introduction the second phase improves the fracture toughness of Fe-based BMGs to 47\u00a0MPa\u00a0m 1/2 , which is approximately 20 times higher than that of the Fe-based BMG (2.2\u00a0MPa\u00a0m 1/2 ). Our findings provide general guidelines for the SLM fabrication of bulk metallic glass composites with tunable mechanical performances, as well as large sizes and freeform geometries.",

Here, a map is constructed that illustrates the effect of laser energy density on structural evolution. Experiments combined with finite element method simulations reveal that high energy density leads to substantial crystallization. A mathematical model based on the phase transformation curves has been put forward to roughly predict the amorphous content in 3D-printed bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) under various process parameters. The present results provide guidance to optimize the process parameters to achieve desirable microstructures and properties of 3D-printed BMGs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, experiments combined with finite element method (FEM) were applied to investigate the origin of micro-cracking in 3D printed a Fe-based bulk metallic glass (Fe 43.7 Co 7.3 Cr 14.7 Mo 12.6 C 15.5 B 4.3 Y 1.9 ) by selective laser melting (SLM). It is revealed that thermal stress concentration around micro-pores is the main cause for the formation of micro-cracks in the 3D-printed Fe-based BMG. Both the location and size of micro-pores play important roles in the generation of micro-cracks: Thermal stress is more serious at the edge between molten pool and heat affect zone with respect to other regions, while thermal stress concentration is increased with the decrease of pore size. Based on FEM simulations and experimental results, a critical dimension of 30\u202f\u03bcm of pores was induced for the generation of micro-cracks in the present 3D printed Fe-based BMG components.",

Here, we report on the manufacturing of Zr-based BMG components with complex geometries, including cubic, hollow, and lattice structures, by using a selective laser melting (SLM) 3D-printing technique. High amorphous phase fractions between 74 and 90\u202fwt% are achieved depending on the geometries manufactured. To take advantage of complex geometries with large specific surface areas, the lattice BMG samples were selected, as an example, to be dealloyed to obtain a milli/nano hierarchical porous structure, which exhibits excellent catalytic properties towards degradation of methyl orange, showing a promising potential for functional applications.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) is a central regulator of immune response and a potential target for developing anti-inflammatory agents. Mechanistic studies suggest that compounds that directly inhibit NF-\u03baB DNA binding may block inflammation and the associated tissue damage. Thus, we attempted to discover peptides that could interfere with NF-\u03baB signaling based on a highly conserved DNA-binding domain found in all NF-\u03baB members. One such small peptide, designated as anti-inflammatory peptide-6 (AIP6), was characterized in the current study. AIP6 directly interacted with p65 and displayed an intrinsic cell-penetrating property. This peptide demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, AIP6 inhibited the DNA-binding and transcriptional activities of the p65 NF-\u03baB subunit as well as the production of inflammatory mediators in macrophages upon stimulation. Local administration of AIP6 significantly inhibited inflammation induced by zymosan in mice. Collectively, our results suggest that AIP6 is a promising lead peptide for the development of specific NF-\u03baB inhibitors as potential anti-inflammatory agents.",

        "abstract": "Drug resistance limits leukemia treatment and chaetominine, a cytotoxic alkaloid that promotes apoptosis in a K562 human leukemia cell line via the mitochondrial pathway was studied with respect to chemoresistance in a K562/Adr human resistant leukemia cell line. Cytotoxicity assays indicated that K562/Adr resistance to adriamycin (ADR) did not occur in the presence of chaetominine and that chaetominine increased chemosensitivity of K562/Adr to ADR. Data show that chaetominine enhanced ADR-induced apoptosis and intracellular ADR accumulation in K562/Adr cells. Accordingly, chaetominine induced apoptosis by upregulating ROS, pro-apoptotic Bax and downregulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. RT-PCR and western-blot confirmed that chaetominine suppressed highly expressed MRP1 at mRNA and protein levels. But little obvious alternation of another drug transporter MDR1 mRNA was observed. Furthermore, inhibition of MRP1 by chaetominine relied on inhibiting Akt phosphrylation and nuclear Nrf2. In summary, chaetominine strongly reverses drug resistance by interfering with the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling, resulting in reduction of MRP1-mediated drug efflux and induction of Bax/Bcl-2-dependent apoptosis in an ADR-resistant K562/Adr leukemia cell line.",

Schisandrin A, schisandrin B, and schisandrin C are the representative lignans of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. extract. Although anti-inflammatory effects of the lignans have been shown, their effects on acne-related inflammation caused by P. acnes have not been investigated and compared. We pretreated THP-1 human monocytic cells with 5, 10, and 20 \u03bcM schisandrin A, B, and C, and stimulated the cells with P. acnes. Schisandrin B and C inhibited the release of inflammatory cytokines at a concentration of 5 \u03bcM, while schisandrin A required a concentration of 10 \u03bcM to exert the effects. All of the schisandrins decreased the levels of toll-like receptor 2, and schisandrin B and C reduced the intracellular mRNA expression of the receptor gene. We also studied the influence of schisandrins on the MAPK signaling pathway. Schisandrin A suppressed the P. acnes-induced activation of JNK, while exerting only a weak effect on ERK and p38. Schisandrin B exerted a strong effect on p38, a lesser effect on ERK, and almost no effect on JNK. Schisandrin C inhibited the phosphorylation of all three proteins, especially ERK. Furthermore, the three lignans also prevented the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB. These results contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of the three lignans on P. acnes-induced inflammation and suggest that schisandrins might be developed as pharmacological agents for acne therapy.",

        "abstract": "Propionibacterium acnes, a common pathogen associated with acne, is also responsible for various surgical infections. Schisandrin A, schisandrin B and schisandrin C, the representative lignans of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. extract, inhibit P. acnes-induced inflammation. However, their effects on P. acnes-induced IL-1\u03b2 secretion and pyroptosis mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation remain unknown. In this study, we compared the effects of schisandrin A, B, and C (Sch A, B, and C) on IL-1\u03b2 secretion and pyroptosis in P. acnes-infected THP-1 cells. As NLRP3 plays important roles in P. acnes-mediated inflammation and pyroptosis, we also investigated the effects of Schs on P. acnes-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation by measuring the levels of NLRP3, active caspase-1, and mature IL-1\u03b2, and activity of caspase-1. Our results showed that Sch A, B, and C suppressed P. acnes-induced pyroptosis. Further, the three lignans significantly suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation, with the following potency: Sch C > Sch B > Sch A. Three lignans also inhibited the production of mitochondrial ROS and ATP release. Additionally, Sch B and C almost completely prevented the efflux of K(+.), whereas Sch A had a relatively weak effect. Collectively, our novel findings showed that Sch A, B, and C effectively suppressed IL-1\u03b2 secretion and pyroptosis by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation in P. acnes-infected THP-1 cells. Thus, Schs may be promising agents for the treatment of P. acnes-related infections.",

        "abstract": "B-cell receptor (BCR) and JAK/STAT pathways play critical roles in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Herein, we investigated the anti-lymphoma activity of cerdulatinib, a novel compound that dually targets SYK and JAK/STAT pathways. On a tissue microarray of 62 primary DLBCL tumors, 58% expressed either phosphorylated SYK or STAT3 or both. SYK and STAT3 are also phosphorylated in a panel of eleven DLBCL cell lines although ABC and GCB subtypes exhibited different JAK/STAT and BCR signaling profiles. In both ABC and GCB cell lines, cerdulatinib induced apoptosis that was associated with caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. The compound also blocked G1/S transition and caused cell cycle arrest, accompanied by inhibition of RB phosphorylation and down-regulation of cyclin E. Phosphorylation of BCR components and STAT3 was sensitive to cerdulatinib in both ABC and GCB cell lines under stimulated conditions. Importantly, JAK/STAT and BCR signaling can be blocked by cerdulatinib in primary GCB and non-GCB DLBCL tumor cells that were accompanied by cell death. Our work provides mechanistic insights into the actions of cerdulatinib, suggesting that the drug has a broad anti-tumor activity in both ABC and GCB DLBCL, at least in part by inhibiting SYK and JAK pathways.",

        "abstract": "Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is cell surface glycoprotein that regulates the cellular immune response and serves as a targetable immune checkpoint molecule. Previous studies have demonstrated consistent expression of PD-L1 by Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells, as well as nonmalignant tumor-infiltrating macrophages in classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL). Bone marrow involvement by CHL is uncommon, being present in 5% to 10% of cases, but indicates Ann Arbor stage IV disease. Given the mixed inflammatory infiltrate that characterizes CHL, detection of RS cells in small bone marrow biopsies may be difficult. We sought to investigate the diagnostic utility of PD-L1 expression in staging bone marrow biopsies from patients with newly diagnosed CHL. Forty-four staging bone marrow biopsies from patients with newly diagnosed CHL were examined for PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry. Eight bone marrow biopsies were positive for involvement by CHL (8/44, 18%) and all were positive for PD-L1 (8/8, 100%), including a case that was originally nondiagnostic. Membranous PD-L1 expression was restricted to RS cells and the adjacent nontumor inflammatory cells admixed within areas of fibrosis. Uninvolved bone marrow biopsies and normal-appearing marrow in cases positive for CHL were negative for PD-L1. In comparison, bone marrow biopsies with myelofibrosis caused by myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic disorders were negative for significant PD-L1 staining. PD-L1 expression in RS cells and surrounding inflammatory cells is a sensitive marker for bone marrow involvement by CHL. In cases where RS cells are infrequent, PD-L1 staining in regions of fibrosis may serve as a useful diagnostic clue to involvement by CHL.",

        "abstract": "Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a cell surface glycoprotein that regulates the cellular immune response and serves as a targetable immune checkpoint molecule. PD-L1 is expressed on tumor cells and the immune microenvironment of several human malignancies, including a subset of aggressive lymphomas. We sought to investigate further the clinical and pathologic features of EBV-negative diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases that express PD-L1. Immunohistochemical staining using an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody was performed on DLBCL cases from 86 patients. These patients received standard chemotherapy treatment and were followed for up to 175 months. Overall, 14 cases (16%) were considered positive for PD-L1 in tumor cells. In comparison with PD-L1 negative cases, PD-L1 positive cases had a higher rate of non-GCB type (71% vs. 30%, P=0.0060), and higher Ann Arbor stage (II-IV) (100% vs. 73%, P=0.0327). No significant differences were seen in the immunohistochemical expression of BCL2, MYC, or Ki67. Patients with tumors expressing PD-L1 demonstrated inferior overall survival (OS) upon long term follow up (P=0.0447). Both age/sex-adjusted and multivariate analyses identified PD-L1 as an independent predictor for OS (P=0.0101 and P=0.0424). There was no significant difference, however, in terms of remission rates after first treatment, relapse rates, and progression free survival between the groups. Identification of DLBCL cases that express PD-L1 may serve to select a subset of patients that could further benefit from targeted immunotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Unlike the presence of thick domes and thick layers of rock salt deposits in Europe and the USA, rock salt in China is mainly composed of thin layers (80\u2013300\u00a0m), characterized by a high content of water-insoluble impurities. Thus, the influence of these impurities on the strength of rock salt is barely known and has become an important topic for basic research in the construction of underground salt caverns for energy storage in China. In this paper, the influence of water-insoluble content on the short-term strength of bedded rock salt, based on a series of combined laboratory tests including solubility, uniaxial and triaxial compression tests, on bedded rock salt samples from three locations in China, namely the Huai\u2019an (HA) site in Jiangsu Province, the Pingdingshan (PDS) site in Henan Province and the Anning (AN) site in Yunnan Province, is presented. Samples in which the water-insoluble content was less than 50\u00a0% were defined as \u201crock salt\u201d and the remainder as \u201cimpure rocks with salt\u201d. Analysis of the experimental results for rock salt samples leads to the conclusion that the uniaxial strength, including the error in its measurement, increases with increase in the water-insoluble content in the sample. Meanwhile, the triaxial strength of rock salt will hardly vary with changes in the water-insoluble content. It can also be concluded that application of confining pressure will suppress the impact of the water-insoluble content on the short-term strength of rock salt, i.e. the inhibition will increase with increasing confining pressure. Application of Hou\u2019s strength model to bedded rock salt from the three regions yields comparable results with the measured data, nevertheless with a bearable small degree of uncertainty. The modified Hou\u2019s strength model has been proved to be more suitable for the determination of strength of bedded rock salt from the three study locations in China.",

        "abstract": "Natural gas storage caverns are usually built either in a rock salt dome or in a bedded rock salt formation. In China, the rock salt stratum has the following characteristics: thin, inter-layered, bedded and highly impure. The height of a cavern in bedded rock salt deposit in China depends largely on the thickness of the salt formation (80\u2013300\u00a0m) and is much smaller than in thick domes and thick layers of rock salt deposits in Europe and the USA, where a storage cavern is typically, cylindrically shaped. This renders the diameter of a bedded salt cavern in China to be greater than its height to obtain sufficient storage volume. The stability of horizontal salt caverns with different diameters and varied minimal internal pressures during its long-term operation was numerically analyzed in this paper regarding convergence, damage, stress to peak or dilatancy strength ratio and effective strain. The Hou/Lux constitutive model including some relevant parameters from previous laboratory investigations were used for the numerical simulations. The simulation results show that a horizontal cavern (height\u00a0\u226a\u00a0length) for underground gas storage is more efficient, profitable and suitable because of its few times larger storage capacity than the most used vertical cavern (height\u00a0\u226b\u00a0diameter) or a prolate cavern (height\u00a0\u2248\u00a0or\u00a0<\u00a0diameter) under the Chinese special geological condition of thin-bedded rock salt deposits, provided with appropriate construction and operation parameters.",

        "abstract": "Because of the ultra-low permeability and favorable rheological properties of rock salt, salt caverns are globally considered to be an ideal medium for energy storage. The prediction and control of surface\n subsidence above storage caverns are the key problems that require steady attention to ensure their long-term safety and stable operation. For salt caverns already in existence factors such as depth, shape and geological conditions cannot be changed. Therefore, the operating condition (i.e., internal pressure) becomes a key factor in influencing surface subsidence. However, cyclic pressure change during the operation phase has not been seriously considered by analytical investigation yet. In this paper, theoretical models for the volume convergence rates in spherical and cylindrical caverns have been derived, thereby developing a new concept \u201cequivalent internal pressure\u201d that of rock salt is considered",

        "abstract": "Aeromonas veronii is a conditional pathogen causing high mortality in many freshwater fish species worldwide. Bacterial ghosts are nonliving Gram-negative bacteria devoid of cytoplasmic contents, which induce protective immunity against microbial pathogens. The aims of this study were: a) to produce A. veronii ghost (AVG) constructed by PhiX174 gene E; b) to evaluate the specific, non-specific immune effects and protective immunity of AVG against A. veronii in koi. The lysis plasmid pBBR-E was constructed by cloning PhiX174 gene E into the broad-host-range vector pBBR1MCS2, and then transformed into A. veronii 7231. AVG was generated by increasing the incubation temperature up to 42\u202f\u00b0C. Lysis of A. veronii occurred 3\u202fh after temperature induction and completed in 12\u202fh. The efficiency of ghost induction was 99.9998\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0002%. Koi were immunized intraperitoneally with AVG, formalin-killed bacteria (FKC) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) respectively, and then respiratory burst (RB), myeloperoxidase (MPO), lysozyme (LZM), malondialdehyde (MDA), complement 3 (C3) and antibody activities were examined in serum. Compared with negative control of PBS, the RB, MPO, LZM activities were significantly higher in koi immunized with AVG (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Nevertheless, the MDA activities of AVG treatment were significantly lower than those of PBS treatment (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). The serum agglutination titers and IgM antibody titers in AVG group were significantly higher than those in FKC or PBS groups. After challenged with the parent strain A. veronii 7231, the average mortality of AVG group was significantly lower than that of FKC and PBS groups (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) and the relative percent survival (RPS) of AVG group (73.92%) was higher than that of FKC group (43.48%). Therefore, AVG have the potential to induce protective immunity and they may be ideal vaccine candidates against A. veronii in koi.",

Seven experimental diets were formulated as following: the control diet without carotenoids; PO diet with 4.0 g/kg paprika oleoresin, HP diet with 2.0 g/kg Haematococcus pluvialis, PR diet with 2.0 g/kg Phaffia rhodozyma, AS diet with 0.4 g/kg synthetic astaxanthin, CA diet with 1.0 g/kg \u03b2-carotene and POL diet with 2.0 g/kg paprika oleoresin + 3.0 g/kg lutein. Each experimental diet was fed to triplicate groups of fish to visual satiation twice per day for 8 weeks. The results showed that AS diet turn fish body red higher and sooner, followed by PR diet and HP diet, successively (P u003c 0.05). PO and CA had no significant effect on improving body color, but POL diet can turn fish color yellow effectively (P u003c 0.05). Astaxanthin concentration in diet is positively correlated with redness a*, but negatively with lightness L*. Diet lutein is positive linear correlation with yellowness b*. All carotenoids can significantly reduce plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and lipid peroxide (LPO) level, but increase total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC). The present results suggest that dietary inclusion of 0.4 g/kg synthetic astaxanthin can improve body color effectively and quickly, and all test carotenoid source can increase antioxidant activities of blood parrot.",

        "abstract": "Mesoporous Ni(OH)2 was synthesized using cationic surfactant as template and urea as hydroly-sis-controlling agent. Mesoporous NiO with centralized pore size distribution was obtained by calcining Ni(OH)2 at different temperatures. The BET specific surface area reaches 477.7 m2?g-1 for NiO calcined at 523 K. Structure characterizations indicate the polycrystalline pore wall of mesoporous nickel oxide. The pore-formation mechanism is also deduced to be quasi-reverse micelle mechanism. Cyclic voltammetry shows the good capacitive behavior of these NiO samples due to its unique mesoporous structure when using large amount of NiO to fabricate electrode. Compared with NiO prepared by dip-coating and cathodic pre-cipitation methods, this mesoporous NiO with controlled pore structure can be used in much larger amount to fabricate the electrode and still maintains high specific capacitance and good capacitive behavior.",

The surface morphology, pore structure and crystal structure were investi- gated by Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM), N2 adsorption technique and X-ray diffraction (XRD) re- spectively. Electrochemical properties of CMK-5 were studied by galvanostatic cycling and cyclic voltam- metry, and compared with conventional anode material graphite. Results showed that the reversible capacity of CMK-5 was 525 mAh/g at the third charge-discharge cycle and that CMK-5 was more compatible for quick charge-discharge cycling because of its special mesoporous structure. Of special interest was that the CMK-5 gave no peak on its positive sweep of the cyclic voltammetry, which was different from all the other known anode materials. Besides, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and XRD were also applied to investigate the charge-discharge characteristics of CMK-5.",

        "abstract": "Hidden blood loss is a major concern for patients undergoing hip surgery for intertrochanteric fracture. The objective of this study was to investigate whether tranexamic acid (TXA) could reduce postoperative hidden blood loss in patients undergoing hip surgery for intertrochanteric fracture.A total of 77 patients with intertrochanteric fracture were enrolled in this randomized controlled study. Patients received either 200 mL (1 g) of TXA (n = 37) or normal-saline (NS) (n = 40) i.v. before hip surgery using proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA). Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were measured preoperatively and postoperatively at day 1 and 3. Visible and hidden blood loss volumes were calculated at postoperative day 3.On postoperative day 3, the transfusion rate was significantly lower in the TXA group compared to the NS group, although mean hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the estimated hidden blood loss volume (210.09 \u00b1 202.14 mL vs. 359.35 \u00b1 290.12 mL; P < 0.05) and total blood loss volume (279.35 \u00b1 209.11 mL vs. 417.89 \u00b1 289.56 mL; P < 0.05) were significantly less in the TXA group compared to the NS group, respectively.TXA significantly reduced postoperative hidden blood loss in patients with intertrochanteric fracture who underwent PFNA.

Radiographic evaluation was performed using criteria described by Matta. Functional outcome was assessed using modified Postel Merle D'Aubign\u00e9 score.Between 2008 and 2013, 33 adult patients with mean age of 46 years and mean follow up of 37.5 months were enrolled. Anatomic reduction was obtained in 61 % of cases, imperfect reduction in 24 % of cases and poor reduction in 15 % of cases. The average modified Merle d'Aubign\u00e9 score was 15: categorized as excellent in seven, good in 18, fair in three, and poor in four. One patient died at 15 days because of pulmonary embolism. Four patients sustained temporary lateral femoral cutaneous palsy. At final follow up, two patients had severe post-traumatic arthritis; one of them underwent a total hip arthroplasty at 93 months. None of the patients had loss of reduction.A short buttress plate fixation of posterior column through single ilioinguinal approach for complex acetabular fractures is a safe and effective method.",

Patients suffering from infected nonunion of the tibia were treated by bone transport from 2012 to 2014. Follow-up was for at least 2 years after complete osseous consolidation. Standardized treatment included bacterial eradication by segmental resection, bone transport using Ilizarov apparatus, and docking maneuver. The main outcome measurements consisted of the quality of life (PCS and MCS scores) and the VAS of pain during the different stages of therapy. In addition, all complications were documented.Our series comprised 12 men and 3 women with an average age of 36.9 years (range: 20-55 years). All patients previously undergone an average of 2.9 operations (range: 1-6 operations). In all patients, bone defects were present with a mean size of 7.5\u200acm (range: 3-12\u200acm), and all patients were suffering from soft tissue defects (range: 5-17\u200acm). The mean external fixator time (EFT) was 48 weeks (range: 30-62 weeks) and the mean external fixation index was 43.1 days/cm (range: 33-62\u200adays/cm). All patients achieved bone union, and no recurrence of infection was observed. According to the Paley classification, patients suffered 15 minor and 13 major complications. The average complication rate per patient comprised of 1.0 minor and 0.9 major complications. Bone grafting was required in 6 cases at the docking site. One patient suffered from equinus deformity, and refused any further surgical procedures. We performed 28 operations in 15 patients (average 1.9 operations per patient). After the period of bone transport, PCS and MCS scores increased continuously. After completed consolidation, the average MCS score was comparable to a normal collective, and the average VAS score was 1.87 (range: 0-3).Bone transport is a safe option for the treatment of infected nonunion of the tibia despite the high complication rate. The arduous and demanding nature of this treatment subjects patient to considerable the pain, mental, and physical stress. The average VAS scores, PCS, and MCS scores significantly improve at final follow-up. It is essential to communicate this fact to the patients and their relatives before the application of the frame in order to increase their compliance with the long and emotionally draining treatment.",

        "abstract": "The goal was to evaluate the clinical outcomes, quality of reduction and complications of pelvic fractures treated by minimally invasive stabilisation of posterior pelvic ring instabilities with pedicle screws connected to a transverse rod.Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in a consecutive patient series with pelvic fractures treated by minimally invasive stabilisation of posterior pelvic ring instabilities with pedicle screws between January 2010 and January 2016. The functional outcomes evaluated by Majeed scores, and fracture reduction results were evaluated using the Tornetta and Matta standard. As well as recording the duration of the surgical procedure, intraoperative blood loss, the times of intra-operative fluoroscopy and complications.A total of 29 patients (15 men and 14 women; age range, 21-72 years; mean, 40.8 years) could be followed-up after an average of 38.2\u2009\u00b1\u200921.3 months (range, 12-84 months). According to the AO/OTA classification, there were 24 patients with B2 injury and five patients with C1 injury of the pelvic ring. For the sacral fractures, according to Denis classification, four cases were zone I fractures and 25 cases were zone II fractures. The duration of the surgical procedure, intra-operative blood loss and the times of intra-operative fluoroscopic of the posterior-ring surgical procedure was 28.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6 minutes (range, 20-38 minutes), 46.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9 ml (range, 39-56 ml), and 13.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6 seconds (range, 10-17 seconds) respectively. Posterior-ring fracture reduction was excellent in 11 patients and 15 were good, three cases were fair; the excellent and good rate was 89.7% (26/29). At the final follow-up, the function result was rated as excellent in ten cases, good in 16, fair in three, and poor in zero cases; the excellent and good rate was 89.7% (26/29). There was no incision infection, intra-operative neurovascular injury, pedicle screw loose or breakage, and non-union of the posterior arch did not occur. Two patients requested removal of the fixator: one patient with breakage of the anterior pelvic ring internal fixator, and the pedicle screw was also taken out in the same operative session; another one with moderate pain on the posterior pelvic ring.Minimally invasive stabilisation of posterior-pelvic-ring instabilities with pedicle screw connected to a transverse rod may be a good alternative to sacroiliac screw fixation because it is quick, safe and associated with a good functional outcome; thus being a useful option in patients who do not qualify for sacroiliac screw fixation.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the retailers\u2019 information acquisition behavior under horizontal competition and investigates the impact of information leakage from an evolutionary game theory perspective. When information leakage does not occur, we find that firms\u2019 acquisition behavior differ under different types of competition. Under Cournot competition, rivals prefer the competitor not to acquire information. Under Bertrand competition, however, rivals prefer the competitor to acquire information. As a result, at a moderate level of acquisition cost mixed strategies (acquire and not acquire) coexist under Cournot competition, whereas all retailers adopt the same (pure) strategy under Bertrand competition. With information leakage, two effects (collaborative forecasting and free-riding) influence firms\u2019 decision making. When the collaborative forecasting effect dominates, all retailers would choose the acquisition strategy in the equilibrium. However, if the free-riding effect is strong, no retailer would acquire information in the equilibrium. With a moderate acquisition cost, there are still retailers willing to acquire information and mixed strategies coexist, regardless of the type of competition. Interestingly, no matter information is leaked or not, we find that Cournot competition in general better accommodates information acquisition than Bertrand competition. As a result, Cournot competition can lead to a higher total welfare than Bertrand competition when the information acquisition cost is moderate and the demand uncertainty is large, in contrast to the standard result of duopoly models.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a critical, complex medical condition, and the major causative pathogens of sepsis are both Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Genome-wide studies identify differentially expressed genes for sepsis. However, the results for the identification of DEGs are inconsistent or discrepant among different studies because of heterogeneity of specimen sources, various data processing methods, or different backgrounds of the samples. To identify potential transcriptional biomarkers that are differently expressed in S. aureus- and E. coli-induced sepsis, we have analyzed four microarray datasets from GEO database and integrated results with bioinformatics tools. 42 and 54 DEGs were identified in both S. aureus and E. coli samples from any three different arrays, respectively. Hierarchical clustering revealed dramatic differences between control and sepsis samples. GO functional annotations suggested that DEGs in the S. aureus group were mainly involved in the responses of both defense and immune regulation, but DEGs in the E. coli group were mainly related to the regulation of endopeptidase activity involved in the apoptotic signaling pathway. Although KEGG showed inflammatory bowel disease in the E. coli group, the KEGG pathway analysis showed that these DEGs were mainly involved in the tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway, fructose metabolism, and mannose metabolism in both S. aureus- and E. coli-induced sepsis. Eight common genes were identified between sepsis patients with either S. aureus or E. coli infection and controls in this study. All the candidate genes were further validated to be differentially expressed by an ex-vivo human blood model, and the relative expression of these genes was performed by qPCR. The qPCR results suggest that GK and PFKFB3 might contribute to the progression of S. aureus-induced sepsis, and CEACAM1, TNFAIP6, PSTPIP2, SOCS3, and IL18RAP might be closely linked with E. coli-induced sepsis. These results provide new viewpoints for the pathogenesis of both sepsis and pathogen identification.",

        "abstract": "High sodium intake is a major risk factor for developing hypertension in diabetes. Promotion of sodium excretion reduces cardiometabolic lesions in diabetes. However, the interaction between sodium intake and glucose homeostasis remains elusive. Here, we report that high sodium intake remarkably increased natriuresis in wild-type mice, but this effect was blunted in adipose-specific PPAR\u03b4 knockout mice and diabetic mice. PPAR\u03b4 activation in perirenal fat by agonist or high sodium intake inhibited renal sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) function, which is mediated by increased production of adipose adiponectin. In addition, high salt intake-induced natriuresis was impaired in diabetic states because of renal SGLT2 dysfunction. Type 2 diabetic patients with uncontrolled hyperglycemia had less natriuresis that was correlated to their plasma adiponectin levels. Our findings provide insights into the distinctive role of the PPAR\u03b4/adiponectin/SGLT2 pathway in the regulation of sodium and glucose homeostasis.",

Little is known about the effect of TRPM8 activation by menthol on mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis and the vascular function in cold-induced hypertension.Primary vascular smooth muscle cells from wild-type or Trpm8(-/-) mice were cultured. In vitro, we confirmed that sarcoplasmic reticulum-resident TRPM8 participated in the regulation of cellular and mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis in the vascular smooth muscle cells. TRPM8 activation by menthol antagonized angiotensin II induced mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and excess reactive oxygen species generation by preserving pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, which hindered reactive oxygen species-triggered Ca(2+) influx and the activation of RhoA/Rho kinase pathway. In vivo, long-term noxious cold stimulation dramatically increased vasoconstriction and blood pressure. The activation of TRPM8 by dietary menthol inhibited vascular reactive oxygen species generation, vasoconstriction, and lowered blood pressure through attenuating excessive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species mediated the activation of RhoA/Rho kinase in a TRPM8-dependent manner. These effects of menthol were further validated in angiotensin II-induced hypertensive mice.Long-term dietary menthol treatment targeting and preserving mitochondrial function may represent a nonpharmaceutical measure for environmental noxious cold-induced hypertension.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE The study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of 320-detector row nonsubtracted and subtracted volume CT angiography (VCTA) in detecting small cerebral aneurysms (< 3 mm) compared with 3D digital subtraction angiography (3D DSA). METHODS Six hundred sixty-two patients underwent 320-detector row VCTA and 3D DSA for suspected cerebral aneurysms. Five neuroradiologists independently reviewed VCTA and 3D DSA images. The 3D DSA was considered the reference standard, and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of nonsubtracted and subtracted VCTA in depicting small aneurysms were analyzed. A p value < 0.05 was considered a significant difference. RESULTS According to 3D DSA images, 98 small cerebral aneurysms were identified in 90 of 662 patients. Nonsubtracted VCTA depicted 90 small aneurysms. Ten small aneurysms were missed, and 2 small aneurysms were misdiagnosed. The missed small aneurysms were located almost in the internal carotid artery, near bone tissue. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of nonsubtracted VCTA in depicting small aneurysms were 89.8%, 99.2%, and 96.5%, respectively, on a per-aneurysm basis. Subtracted VCTA depicted 97 small aneurysms. Three small aneurysms were missed, and 2 small aneurysms were misdiagnosed. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of subtracted VCTA in depicting small aneurysms were 96.9%, 99.2%, and 98.6%, respectively, on a per-aneurysm basis. There was no difference in accuracy between subtracted VCTA and 3D DSA (p = 1.000). However, nonsubtracted VCTA had significantly less sensitivity than 3D DSA and subtracted VCTA (p = 0.039 and 0.016, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Subtracted 320-detector row VCTA is sensitive enough to replace 3D DSA in the diagnosis of small cerebral aneurysms (< 3 mm). The accuracy rate of nonsubtracted VCTA was lower than that of subtracted VCTA and 3D DSA, especially in the assessment of small internal carotid artery aneurysms adjacent to the skull base.",

        "abstract": "Objectives  The objective of the study was to determine the clinical utility of 320-detector row volume-computed tomographic angiography (VCTA) in the management of intracranial aneurysms.  Methods  Between February 2011 and May 2015, 550 patients successfully underwent 320-detector row VCTA for suspected intracranial aneurysms. Three-dimensional (3D) digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was used as the ultimate reference standard, and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of both nonsubtracted and subtracted VCTA in identifying aneurysms were analyzed.  Results  Nonsubtracted VCTA identified 417 aneurysms (2 false-positive readings, 12 false-negative readings). The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of non-subtracted VCTA, on a per-aneurysm basis, were 97.2%, 99.0%, and 97.6%, respectively. Subtracted VCTA identified 426 aneurysms (2 false-positive readings, 3 false-negative readings). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of subtracted VCTA, on a per-aneurysm basis, were 99.3%, 99.0%, and 99.2%, respectively. No differences in diagnostic accuracy were found between subtracted VCTA and 3D DSA. Nonsubtracted VCTA, however, was observed to be significantly less sensitive than 3D DSA and subtracted VCTA. Twenty-six aneurysm cases were referred for surgical treatment based on VCTA imaging. All aneurysms were deemed completely occluded during surgical clipping. On the basis of VCTA imaging, 299 aneurysms were found suitable for endovascular coiling, of which 293 aneurysms (98%) were treated successfully.  Conclusions  The 320-detector row subtracted VCTA technique is an effective, first-line diagnostic imaging modality for surgical and endovascular treatment of aneurysms. The nonsubtracted VCTA was less accurate than the subtracted VCTA, especially for intracranial aneurysms adjoining bone tissue.",

Cost-sensitive classifiers minimizing these penalties are needed. We propose a robust minimax approach for producing classifiers that directly minimize the cost of mistakes as a convex optimization problem. This is in contrast to previous methods that minimize the empirical risk using a convex surrogate for the cost of mistakes, since minimizing the empirical risk of the actual cost-sensitive loss is generally intractable. By treating properties of the training data as uncertain, our approach avoids these computational difficulties. We develop theory and algorithms for our approach and demonstrate its benefits on cost-sensitive classification tasks.",

Convex approximations are typically optimized in their place to avoid NP-hard empirical risk minimization problems. We propose to approximate the training data instead of the loss function by posing multivariate prediction as an adversarial game between a loss-minimizing prediction player and a loss-maximizing evaluation player constrained to match specified properties of training data. This avoids the non-convexity of empirical risk minimization, but game sizes are exponential in the number of predicted variables. We overcome this intractability using the double oracle constraint generation method. We demonstrate the efficiency and predictive performance of our approach on tasks evaluated using the precision at k, the F-score and the discounted cumulative gain.",

        "abstract": "We propose a robust adversarial prediction framework for general multiclass classification. Our method seeks predictive distributions that robustly optimize non-convex and non-continuous multiclass loss metrics against the worst-case conditional label distributions (the adversarial distributions) that (approximately) match the statistics of the training data. Although the optimized loss metrics are non-convex and non-continuous, the dual formulation of the framework is a convex optimization problem that can be recast as a risk minimization model with a prescribed convex surrogate loss we call the adversarial surrogate loss. We show that the adversarial surrogate losses fill an existing gap in surrogate loss construction for general multiclass classification problems, by simultaneously aligning better with the original multiclass loss, guaranteeing Fisher consistency, enabling a way to incorporate rich feature spaces via the kernel trick, and providing competitive performance in practice.",

JP - I  can display SmA 2  phase triggered by the addition of alkali metal ions. The LC property of the doped system was well demonstrated by polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments.

Such gel which formed in ethanol showed a helical nanostructure. The XRD displayed that the  JP - I  could self-assemble into a monolayer structure which had a small tilt angle in the layers. Furthermore, the gel system could be established to remove iodine from water. Additionally,  JP - I  could recognize Fe 3+  with lower detection limit in aqueous ethanol.

In their bulk states, only one ester compound with the longest alkyl chains can self-assemble into p6mm columnar phase, all the other compounds are nonmesogens. These polycatenars can form organogels with much more ordered morphologies in polar solvents than in apolar or less polar solvents. In DMF solvent, gels with spherical flower-like morphologies are formed by ester compounds, while gels with nanosheet morphologies are formed by amide compounds. The amide polycatenars can also act as chemosensors for detecting metal ions with high selectivity.

Such polycatenars can self-assemble into different columnar liquid crystalline phases ranging from p4mm via p2mm to p6mm in their bulk states and into organogels with nanobelt or porous morphologies in different solvents. These polycatenars can exhibit highly fluorescent emission with large Stokes shifts (90\u2013118 nm) in solution and as films. Most interestingly, the photodimerization in both LC and non-LC phases led to the formation of absolutely hexagonal columnar LC phases, while photodimerization in gel states led to the formation of flowerlike or 3D porous morphologies. Either columnar phases or gels with flowerlike or ordered porous morphologies were first observed in coumarin based derivatives.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a transport traffic estimation method which leverages road network correlation and sparse traffic sampling via the compressive sensing technique. Through the investigation on a traffic data set of more than 4400 taxis from Shanghai city, China, we observe nontrivial traffic correlations among the traffic conditions of different road segments and derive a mathematical model to capture such relations. After mathematical manipulation, the models can be used to construct representation bases to sparsely represent the traffic conditions of all road segments in a road network. With the trait of sparse representation, we propose a traffic estimation approach that applies the compressive sensing technique to achieve a city-scale traffic estimation with only a small number of probe vehicles, largely reducing the system operating cost. To validate the traffic correlation model and estimation method, we do extensive trace-driven experiments with real-world traffic data. The results show that the model effectively reveals the hidden structure of traffic correlations. The proposed estimation method derives accurate traffic conditions with the average accuracy as 0.80, calculated as the ratio between the number of correct traffic state category estimations and the number of all estimation times, based on only 50 probe vehiclesu0027 intervention, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both cost and traffic estimation accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies using deep neural networks have shown remarkable success in style transfer especially for artistic and photo-realistic images. However, the approaches using global feature correlations fail to capture small, intricate textures and maintain correct texture scales of the artworks, and the approaches based on local patches are defective on global effect. In this paper, we present a novel feature pyramid fusion neural network, dubbed GLStyleNet, which sufficiently takes into consideration multi-scale and multi-level pyramid features by best aggregating layers across a VGG network, and performs style transfer hierarchically with multiple losses of different scales. Our proposed method retains high-frequency pixel information and low frequency construct information of images from two aspects: loss function constraint and feature fusion. Our approach is not only flexible to adjust the trade-off between content and style, but also controllable between global and local. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our method can transfer not just large-scale, obvious style cues but also subtle, exquisite ones, and dramatically improves the quality of style transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on portrait style transfer, artistic style transfer, photo-realistic style transfer and Chinese ancient painting style transfer tasks. Experimental results indicate that our unified approach improves image style transfer quality over previous state-of-the-art methods, while also accelerating the whole process in a certain extent.

In this paper,we demonstrate that the parameters of these neural nets can be dramatically reduced without affecting their performance. We describe a method to reduce the parameters required by RBM which is the basic building block for deep architectures. Further we propose an unsupervised sparse deep architectures selection algorithm to form sparse deep neural networks.Experimental results show that there is virtually no loss in either generative or discriminative performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   An experimental heat transfer study using triethylamine (TEA)-water solution as a coolant in a Piranha Pin Fin (PPF) structure is reported here. The triethylamine-water solution undergoes phase separation when heated to a temperature over 18.2\u202f\u00b0C at a TEA mass fraction of 32.1% (i.e., critical composition). This separation process was proven to enhance heat transfer in the plain channel geometry. With the aid of the PPF structure, the TEA-water solution was able to dissipate a heat flux of up to 500\u202fW/cm 2  at a mass flux of 600\u202fkg/m 2 s and to keep the surface temperature below 80\u202f\u00b0C. The phase separation of a TEA-water mixture in the PPF structure yields about 1.8 times greater heat transfer coefficient compared to a corresponding homogeneous mixture flow. Flow boiling was achieved during experiments when the heat flux exceeded 600\u202fW/cm 2 . The effects of different configurations of PPF were also studied, and it is shown that the PPF configuration with fewer and smaller fins provides the best performance enhancement over water flow at the same mass flux. Two flow conditions, channel flow and extraction flow, were examined. The TEA-rich phase was extracted during the extraction flow experiment and the remaining water-rich phase results in favorable thermal transport performance. A string-shaped flow pattern is observed due to both shear force and the flow disturbance provided by the PPFs. The system exhibits reduced pressure drop as the fluid viscosities decrease after phase separation.",

        "abstract": "Achieving effective cooling within limited space is one of the key challenges for miniaturized product design. State-of-the-art micro-scale cooling enhancement techniques incorporate flow disturbances and boiling to reach high performance. However, these methods face the inherent issues of extra pressure drop, flow instability and dry-out that limits heat flux. Here we demonstrate that substantial cooling capability enhancement, up to 2.5 times, is realized by introducing the phase separation of a triethylamine (TEA)/water mixture at the micro-scale. Our experiments show that the enhancement behavior is closely related to the system's initial composition, temperature, and flow conditions. Moreover, the mixture system exhibits reduced pressure drop after separation, which makes it more promising in serving practical applications. The results reveal new possibilities for liquid coolant selection and provide the experimental foundation for further research in this area.",

The mixture, 32.1% mass fraction of TEA, was introduced into a 22\u00a0mm long, 2\u00a0mm wide, and 0.4\u00a0mm deep microchannel. When heated above the critical temperature, the mixture separated into distinct immiscible liquid phases. Through flow visualization, the two-phase flow patterns were determined to be predominantly mist flow, elongated droplet flow, and annular flow. Increased heat transfer coefficients of up to about 250% and reduced pressure drop were observed between cases of phase separation flow and single phase mixture flow, demonstrating the potential for applying this type of solvent mixture to miniature heat sinks. A first-order computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) model was used to reveal the mechanisms controlling the hydrodynamics and thermodynamics processes. It was determined that the latent heat of mixing associated with the phase separation process contributed to the enhanced heat transfer. The self-propelled motion of components driven by chemical potential gradient further boosted the heat transport. Reduced viscosities of both phases led to the reduced pressure drop.",

        "abstract": "Silver-impregnated zeolite (AgIZ) has been used for removing radioiodine from contaminated groundwater and nuclear waste streams and the worldwide inventory of such secondary waste is rapidly increasing. The objective of this study was to 1) quantify the effectiveness of two grout waste forms for disposing of the used AgIZ, and 2) determine the I speciation leached from AgIZ encapsulated in grout. A 60-day kinetics batch experiment demonstrated that AgIZ encapsulated in slag-free grout was extremely effective at immobilizing I and Ag, a potential non-radioactive carcinogen. However, AgIZ encapsulated in slag-containing grout, the most common type of grout used for low-level radioactive waste disposal, was entirely ineffective at immobilizing I. While the slag-free grout with AgIZ released only 3.3\u202f\u03bcg/L I into the contact solution, the slag-containing grout released 19,269\u202f\u03bcg/L I. Based on thermodynamic calculations, the strongly reducing conditions of the slag-containing system (Eh was -392\u202fmV) promoted the reductive dissolution of the AgI, forming Ag and releasing iodide (I) into the aqueous phase. The slag-free grout system was maintained under more oxidizing conditions (Eh was 439\u202fmV) and a minimal amount of I was released from the grout. In both grout systems, the aqueous I, originally added to the AgZ as iodide, was composed primarily of iodide and org-I, and essentially no iodate was detected. More organo-I was detected in the slag-free than the slag-containing grout system because the high redox potential of the former system was more conducive to the formation of oxidized I species, such as I, which may be intermediates in the covalent bonding of I with organic C in grout. Iodine K-edge XANES analysis indicated that I existed exclusively as silver iodide in both AgIZ-grout samples. Together, these results indicate that subsurface grout disposal of AgIZ waste should be done under oxidizing conditions and that radioiodide released from AgIZ can undergo speciation transformations that have important implications on subsequent mobility and estimated risk.",

Nagasaki sediments containing bomb-derived Pu that was deposited in 1945 provided a unique opportunity to explore the long-term geochemical behavior of Pu. Through a combination of selective extractions and molecular characterization via electrospray ionization Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICRMS), we determined that 55\u202f\u00b1\u202f3% of the bomb-derived Pu was preferentially associated with more persistent organic matter compounds in Nagasaki sediments, particularly those natural organic matter (NOM) stabilized by Fe oxides (NOM). Other organic matter compounds served as a secondary sink of these bomb-derived Pu (31\u202f\u00b1\u202f2% on average), and <20% of the Pu was immobilized by inorganic mineral particles. In a narrow, Pu-enriched layer of only 9-cm depth (total core depth was 600\u202fcm), N-containing carboxyl aliphatic and/or alicyclic molecules (CCAM) in NOM and other NOM fractions immobilized the majority of Pu. Among the cluster of N-containing CCAM moieties, hydroxamate siderophores, the strongest known Pu chelators in nature, were further detected in these \"aged\" Nagasaki bomb residue-containing sediments. While present long-term disposal and environmental remediation modeling assume that solubility limits and sorption to mineral surfaces control Pu subsurface mobility, our observations suggest that NOM, which is present in essentially all subsurface systems, undoubtedly plays an important role in sequestrering Pu. Ignoring the role of NOM in controlling Pu fate and transport is not justified in most environmental systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Iodine-129 is a key risk driver in most low-level waste cementitious waste repositories. Objectives of this study were to determine iodine speciation in cementitious materials with slag (Grout +slag ) and without slag (Grout \u2013slag ) and its impact on iodine immobilization. Irrespective of which iodine species was amended to the aqueous phase, there were no significant differences in uptake-K d  values (\u223c3\u202fL/kg). However, when the various iodine species were hydrated with the grout, the release-K d  values (6.1\u2013121.8\u202fL/kg) were significantly greater than the uptake-K d  values, and the amended iodine speciation (I \u2212 \u202f\u226a\u202forg-I\u202f\u2264\u202fIO 3  \u2212 ) and grout formulation (Grout \u2013slag  +slag ) had a significant impact on release-K d  values. In grout samples amended with I \u2212  and IO 3  \u2212 , org-I was formed and comprised a majority of the iodine in the leachate after 28 days of equilibration. The formed org-I originated from organic carbon (C) in the grout material (\u223c1200\u202fmg/kg C). For the first time, these studies demonstrate that multiple iodine species can co-exist simultaneously in grout porewater, the iodine species initially added to the grout can greatly affect iodine immobilization, and the addition of slag to the grout formulation increased iodine immobilization. These results may have important implications on radioiodine waste disposal.",

        "abstract": "Silver (Ag)-based technologies are amongst the most common approaches to removing radioiodine from aqueous waste streams. As a result, a large worldwide inventory of radioactive AgI waste presently exits, which must be stabilized for final disposition. In this work, the efficacy of silver-impregnated granular activated carbon (Ag-GAC) to remove iodide (I), iodate (IO) and organo-iodine (org-I) from cementitious leachate was examined. In addition, cementitious materials containing I, IO, or org-I loaded Ag-GAC were characterized by iodine K-edge XANES and EXAFS to provide insight into iodine stability and speciation in these waste forms. The Ag-GAC was very effective at removing I and org-I, but ineffective at removing IO from slag-free grout leachate under oxic conditions. I or org-I removal was due to the formation of insoluble AgI or Ag-org-I on the Ag-GAC. When I-loaded Ag-GAC material was cured with slag-free and slag grouts, I was released from AgI to form a hydrated I species. Conversely, when org-I loaded Ag-GAC material was cured in the two grout formulations, no change was observed in the iodine speciation, indicating the org-I species remained bound to the Ag. Because little IO was bound to the Ag-GAC, it was not detectable in the grout. Thus, grout formulation and I speciation in the waste stream can significantly influence the effectiveness of the long-term disposal of radioiodine associated with Ag-GAC in grout waste forms.",

        "abstract": "Large amounts of oil containing mucous-like marine snow formed in surface waters adjacent to the Deepwater Horizon spill that was implicated in oil delivery to the seafloor. However, whether chemical dispersants that were used increased or decreased the oil incorporation and sedimentation efficiency, and how exopolymeric substances (EPS) are involved in this process remains unresolved. To investigate the microbial responses to oil and dispersants in different oceanic settings, indicated by EPS production, petro- and non-petro carbon sedimentation, four mesocosm (M) experiments were conducted: 1) nearshore seawater with a natural microbial consortia (M2); 2) offshore seawater with f/20 nutrients (M3); 3) coastal seawater with f/20 nutrients (M4); 4) nearshore seawater with a natural microbial consortia for a longer duration (M5). Four treatments were conducted in M2, M3 and M4 whereas only three in M5: 1) a water accommodated fraction of oil (WAF), 2) a chemically-enhanced WAF prepared with Corexit (CEWAF, not in M5), 3) a 10-fold diluted CEWAF (DCEWAF); and 4) controls. Overall, oil and dispersants input, nutrient and microbial biomass addition enhanced EPS production. Dispersant addition tended to induce the production of EPS with higher protein/carbohydrate (P/C) ratios, irrespective of oceanic regions. EPS produced in M4 was generally more hydrophobic than that produced in M3. The P/C ratio of EPS in both the aggregate and the colloidal fraction was a key factor that regulated oil contribution to sinking aggregates, based on the close correlation with %petro-carbon in these fractions. In the short term (4-5\u202fdays), both the petro and non-petro carbon sedimentation efficiencies showed decreasing trends when oil/dispersants were present. In comparison, in the longer-term (16\u202fdays), petro-carbon sedimentation efficiency was less influenced by dispersants, possibly due to biological and physicochemical changes of the components of the oil-EPS-mineral phase system, which cooperatively controlled the sinking velocities of the aggregates.",

In HA-groundwater slurry, Pb, Be, Fe and Pa bound strongly to particulate HA (>0.45\u2009\u00b5m), supporting their application as tracers of soil erosion. Th bound strongly to the colloidal HA (3\u2009kDa-0.45\u2009\u00b5m) and as such, would not be a good candidate as a tracer for monitoring soil erosion. HAs likely reduced the oxidized neptunyl form (Np(V)O) to Np(IV) based on its enhanced particle-reactivity and Np uptake by particulate HAs, partially retarding the movement of anthropogenic Np in field polluted environments. Particulate/colloidal carbonyl/O-aryl (likely through hydroquinone/quinone) functionalities in the HA correlated to Np and Pa uptake, but only particulate O-aryl functionalities was responsible for Fe uptake. The carboxylate- and carbonyl/O-aryl-containing organic functionalities in the HA correlated strongly with Th uptake. In contrast, no significant correlations between organic parameters and Pb or Be uptake implied their predominance of uniform surface adsorption onto particles. This study provides novel insight into the binding of six radionuclides with different organic functionalities of three size fractions, as well as its possible impact on their application in the soil-tracing research.",

Through setting forth the concepts of collocation advanced from different perspectives,we find that these concepts fail to incorporate the features of L2 collocation acquisition,causing the limitation in the depth of research. Hence,following the comparative analysis of L2 and L1 collocation acquisition,this paper summarizes the fundamental features of L2 collocation acquisition as follows: (1) occurring in non-formulaic pattern of L2 input; (2) susceptible to L1thinking; (3) strong intention for semantic analysis during L2 collocation processing. According to these features,it puts forward cognitive psychology-based notion of L2 collocation. This notion deepens our understanding of the L2 collocation concept,and objectively reveals inner factors involved in L2 collocation acquisition,with a view to the dynamic mental reality in which L2 collocation is acquired as knowledge. This notion adapts to the fundamental features of collocation acquisition,enables us to examine cognitive factors concerning L2 collocation processing,especially L1 influence.

        "abstract": "CD133 is widely used as a marker for stem/progenitor cells in many organ systems. Previous studies using in vitro stem cell assays have suggested that the CD133-expressing prostate basal cells may serve as the putative prostate stem cells. However, the precise localization of the CD133-expressing cells and their contributions to adult murine prostate homeostasis in vivo remain undetermined. We show that loss of function of CD133 does not impair murine prostate morphogenesis, homeostasis and regeneration, implying a dispensable role for CD133 in prostate stem cell function. Using a CD133-CreER(T2) model in conjunction with a fluorescent report line, we show that CD133 is not only expressed in a fraction of prostate basal cells, but also in some luminal cells and stromal cells. CD133(+) basal cells possess higher in vitro sphere-forming activities than CD133(-) basal cells. However, the in vivo lineage tracing study reveals that the two cell populations possess the same regenerative capacity and contribute equally to the maintenance of the basal cell lineage. Similarly, CD133(+) and CD133(-) luminal cells are functionally equivalent in maintaining the luminal cell lineage. Collectively, our study demonstrates that CD133 does not enrich for the stem cell activity in vivo in adult murine prostate. This study does not contradict previous reports showing CD133(+) cells as prostate stem cells in vitro. Instead, it highlights a substantial impact of biological contexts on cellular behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Patients with epilepsy (PWE) are more likely to suffer from migraine attack, and aberrant white matter (WM) organization may be the mechanism underlying this phenomenon. This study aimed to use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique to quantify WM structural differences in PWE with interictal migraine.Diffusion tensor imaging data were acquired in 13 PWE with migraine and 12 PWE without migraine. Diffusion metrics were analyzed using tract-atlas-based spatial statistics analysis. Atlas-based and tract-based spatial statistical analyses were conducted for robustness analysis. Correlation was explored between altered DTI metrics and clinical parameters.The main results are as follows: (i) Axonal damage plays a key role in PWE with interictal migraine. (ii) Significant diffusing alterations included higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in the fornix, higher mean diffusivity (MD) in the middle cerebellar peduncle (CP), left superior CP, and right uncinate fasciculus, and higher axial diffusivity (AD) in the middle CP and right medial lemniscus. (iii) Diffusion tensor imaging metrics has the tendency of correlation with seizure/migraine type and duration.Results indicate that characteristic structural impairments exist in PWE with interictal migraine. Epilepsy may contribute to migraine by altering WMs in the brain stem. White matter tracts in the fornix and right uncinate fasciculus also mediate migraine after epilepsy. This finding may improve our understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying migraine attack after epilepsy.",

We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes between children and adults with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and to assess the probable risk factors. In this observational study, patients who tested positive for anti-NMDAR antibody in the cerebrospinal fluid were enrolled. The patients were divided into children and adults group on the basis of age (whether <16 or not). Clinical outcomes were assessed at onset, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the patients received treatment and were scored based on whether they required hospitalization and intensive care. A total of 15 children and 14 adults were examined. The adults more likely manifested status epilepticus, central hypoventilation, and pneumonia but less likely exhibited movement disorder than the children did. All of the patients were subjected to corticosteroid treatment, 11 children and 9 adults were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, and only the adults received plasma exchange or cyclophosphamide. The children recovered faster than the adults, especially in the first 6 months. Risk factors included age, status epilepticus, changes in consciousness, central hypoventilation, and pneumonia. Adults exhibit worse outcomes than children mostly because of status epilepticus.",

In order to address the issues that data is decentralised, growing and continually being updated, and the content living or archiving on different information sources partially overlaps creating redundancies as well as contradictions and inconsistencies, we develop a data network model and technology for constructing and managing big cancer data. To support our data network approach for data process and analysis, we employ a semantic content network approach and adopt the CELAR cloud platform. The prototype implementation shows that the CELAR cloud can satisfy the on-demanding needs of various data resources for management and process of big cancer data.",

        "title": "A self-organizing algorithm for community structure analysis in complex networks.",
        "abstract": "Community structure analysis is a critical task for complex network analysis. It helps us to understand the properties of the system that a complex network represents, and has significance to a wide range of real applications. The Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) is currently the most popular community structure analysis algorithm due to its near linear time complexity. However, the performance of the LPA has proven to be unstable and the correctness of community assignment of nodes is unsatisfactory. In this paper a Self-Organizing Community Detection and Analytic Algorithm (SOCDA2) based on swarm intelligence is proposed. In the algorithm, a network is modeled as a swarm intelligence system, while each node within the network acts iteratively to join or leave communities based on a set of pre-defined node action rules, in order to improve the quality of the communities. When there is not a node changing its belonging community anymore, an optimal community structure will emerge as a result. A variety of experiments conducted on both synthesized and real-world networks have shown results which indicate that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect community structures and the performance is better than that of the LPA. In addition, the algorithm can be extended for overlapping community detection and be parallelized for large-scale network analysis.",

        "abstract": "Proceedings: AACR 107th Annual Meeting 2016; April 16-20, 2016; New Orleans, LABackgroundHypoxia occurs within the majority of solid tumors. It has multiple impacts on tumor biology including angiogenesis, suppression of immune reactivity, enhanced receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, down regulation of DNA repair pathways, promotion of pro-survival phenotypes and increased proclivity for invasion and metastasis. Levels of hypoxia vary between and within tumors, correlate with patient outcomes, and can lead to differences in response to therapy. Despite considerable advances, our understanding of the regulatory processes that control these diverse and heterogeneous changes in cancer phenotype remain incomplete. A better understanding of how they are mediated will inform strategies for personalized medicine and promise to substantially advance our understanding of tumor heterogeneity.MethodsUntil recently, techniques for RNA-expression profiling have lacked the resolution necessary to detect genome wide changes in splicing. We exploited the increased precision offered by deep sequencing to investigate genome-wide remodelling of transcript architectures in both cell line and tumor samples. Using novel computational strategies we generated sample-specific gene models from RNA sequencing data generated over a timecourse of HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells following a switch to 1% oxygenation and used these data to identify widespread changes in splicing. We applied similar strategies to raw RNA-sequencing data derived from TCGA.ResultsWe detected the expression of thousands of novel isoforms and a systematic, pathway-dependent switch to the expression of noncoding transcripts at multiple genes, including many constituents of the Fanconi Anemia, nucleotide excision- and double strand break repair pathways. Of particular note were HDAC6 and 53BP1: critical regulators of DNA damage response. Both loci exhibited a hypoxia-dependent expression of retained-intron transcripts and a concomitant decline in protein levels, thus providing a novel and unanticipated mechanism by which hypoxia can drive genetic instability. Predictions made using our cell line model were recapitulated in a large cohort of 458 colorectal carcinomas derived from TCGA. Validation of the cell line data revealed, for the first time, a strong signature of isoform switching in which a widespread transition to noncoding expression is associated with poor patient outcome. These data were derived from independent patient biopsies sequenced by others, thus demonstrating the robustness of our findings.ConclusionsThese data therefore have clear, substantial, and immediate implications both for our understanding of the basic aetiology of solid tumors and for the development of RNA-based signatures and biomarkers in diagnostics and personalized medicine.Citation Format: Crispin Miller, Danish Memon, Keren Dawson, Christopher Smowton, Wei Xing, Caroline Dive.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the benefits of automatically determining the degree of parallelism used to perform genetic mutation calling in a hybrid cloud environment. We propose algorithms to automatically control both the hiring of hybrid cloud resources and the selection of the degree of parallelism employed in analysis tasks executed against that cloud. Using the Broad Institute's Genome Analysis Toolkit as a case study, we then conduct profile-driven simulation studies to characterise the circumstances in which our algorithms are beneficial or deleterious compared to simple, conventional baseline algorithms. We find that there are a wide range of cloud workload scenarios where our algorithms outperform the baselines, and thereby argue that automatic control of cloud scaling and task parallelism, using techniques like those proposed, are likely to be beneficially applicable to real-world biocomputing.",
