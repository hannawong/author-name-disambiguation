        "abstract": "A critical current density J c and an irreversibility field B i were measured for the low temperature growth (LTG) processed Sm 1+ x Ba 2− x Cu 3 O y films with and without Sm-rich123 nano-particles. The reduction of the resistivity and the small enhancement of B i due to the c -axis correlated pinning were observed for both LTG-Sm123 films with and without nano-particles. These results suggest that the c -axis correlated pinning affects similarly the resistivity and the B i properties regardless of the nano-particle addition. In the J c properties of the nano-particles added sample, three peaks in the angular dependence of J c at 77.3 K appear in addition to the intrinsic anisotropy described by the effective mass model. Those are a broad peak for B ∥ c , a sharp peak at B ∥ ab and a shoulder at about 20° off ab -plane. The broad peak at B ∥ c , which is related with the c -axis correlated pinning, decreases in low fields up to 3 T but increases again in a high field region with increasing a magnetic field. These behaviors may be connected to the enhancement of the B i , which was obtained by the resistivity measurements. The global pinning force is scaled well in a low field region, but shifts to the low field direction in a high field region, with decreasing temperature.

This study examined the relationships between subjective sleep quality assessment and heart rate variability (HRV) indices, particularly those derived from a new sleep index (Hsi) that we have recently developed to detect non-REM sleep. We studied 18 sets of nighttime ECGs and the responses to sleep inventory questionnaires obtained from 5 male workers. We observed that subjective quality was associated with sleep latency estimated by Hsi and with the length of time in bed excluding the period of non-REM sleep in these subjects.",

        "abstract": "Using vascular smooth muscle, we describe the actions of three pharmacological tools, cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), thapsigargin (TG) and 2,5-di-( tert -butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone (tBHQ), which are presumed to act as selective inhibitors of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPases (SERCAs). In porcine aortic smooth muscle microsomes two Ca 2+ -ATPase activities have been described, one vanadate-sensitive and one vanadate-resistant, representing the Ca 2+ -ATPase activities of the plasma membrane and SERCAs, respectively. In agreement, CPA, TG and tBHQ, in the concentration range 0.1 μM to 0.1 mM, dose-dependently inhibit the Ca 2+ -ATPase activity only in the vanadate-resistant microsomes. However, 0.1 mM tBHQ also significantly inhibited the Ca 2+ -ATPase activity of vanadate-sensitive microsomes. In rabbit aortic rings, all three SERCA inhibitors produced a dose-dependant inhibition of contractions evoked by 20 mM caffeine or 1 μM phenylephrine (PE) in a Ca 2+ -free physiological solution. However, in PE-contracted rings, tBHQ (≥30 μM) also significantly inhibited the ability of cromakalim to induce relaxation. In conclusion, the data suggest that CPA, TG and tBHQ can all act as selective SERCA inhibitors in both porcine and rabbit aortic smooth muscle. However, in contrast to CPA and TG, high concentrations of tBHQ can exhibit some nonspecific effects, which include inhibition of the plasma membrane Ca 2+ -ATPase and possibly K + channels regulated by cromakalim.",

According to previous studies, it is assumed that the temperature dependence of J c of REBa2Cu3O7 (REBCO, RE = Y, Gd, Sm, etc) films without artificial pinning centers (APCs) is δl type, but it is unidentified when APCs are introduced into the films. In this paper, GdBCO thin films doped with BaHfO3 (BHO) deposited on LaAlO3 substrates by pulsed laser deposition were studied. A target exchange method was used to alternately ablate two targets of pure GdBCO and BHO for introducing nanorods as APCs into GdBCO films. Since the insulative BHO acts as a strong pinning center, the δT c pinning mechanism is expected for the temperature dependence of J c of these thin films. However, the experimental results showed that the J c of the films with BHO nanorods was determined by the δl pinning mechanism over a wide temperature range. In order to explain these unexpected results, we examined the pinning mechanism by nanorods based on a resultant pinning force model.",

        "abstract": "Little is known about the organizational and functional connectivity of the corticospinal (CS) circuits that are essential for voluntary movement. Here, we map the connectivity between CS neurons in the forelimb motor and sensory cortices and various spinal interneurons, demonstrating that distinct CS-interneuron circuits control specific aspects of skilled movements. CS fibers originating in the mouse motor cortex directly synapse onto premotor interneurons, including those expressing Chx10. Lesions of the motor cortex or silencing of spinal Chx10 interneurons produces deficits in skilled reaching. In contrast, CS neurons in the sensory cortex do not synapse directly onto premotor interneurons, and they preferentially connect to Vglut3 spinal interneurons. Lesions to the sensory cortex or inhibition of Vglut3 interneurons cause deficits in food pellet release movements in goal-oriented tasks. These findings reveal that CS neurons in the motor and sensory cortices differentially control skilled movements through distinct CS-spinal interneuron circuits.",

        "abstract": "Flux pinning properties of a BaHfO (BHO)-doped SmBaCuO (SmBCO) film, which was fabricated by pulsed laser deposition method adopting a seed layer technique, have been investigated. Nano-rods of the film were small in a diameter of 5.4 nm and had high number density (high-) of 4,775/μm. The flux pinning properties of the film were compared with a SmBCO film including BHO nano-rods with a larger diameter and a lower number density (low-). At 65 K, the flux pinning force density of the high- sample (105.0 GN/m) showed much higher than that of the low- sample (70.6 GN/m).",

        "abstract": "To identify genetic alterations associated with acquisition of metastatic ability in colorectal carcinoma, 31 liver metastases and 40 primary tumors of colorectal carcinoma from 55 patients were analyzed for loss of chromosomal heterozygosity using 46 polymorphic DNA markers covering 15 chromosomes. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and/or rearrangement at the TP53 and DCC loci were detected in all liver metastases (10 of 10 at TP53 and 19 of 19 at DCC), and were observed in 59% (10 of 17) at TP53 and 75% (18 of 24) at DCC respectively in the primary tumors. Furthermore, the incidence of LOH on chromosomes 13q and 14q was higher than that on other chromosomes in liver metastasis, and it was higher in liver metastases than in primary tumors (20/30 vs. 18/39, p = 0.072 on chromosome 13q and 21/31 vs. 16/40, p = 0.018 on chromosome 14q). In 4 cases, LOH or rearrangement at loci on chromosomes 13q, 14q and 18q not detected in primary tumors was observed in liver metastases from the same patients. These results suggest that concordant p53 and DCC alterations and inactivation of several other tumor-suppressor genes, especially those on chromosomes 13q and 14q, play important roles in the acquisition of metastatic potential of colorectal carcinoma.",

We performed psychomotor vigilance tests before and after 30-min wearing of blue, green, orange, pink, and clear glasses on different days in 20 normal subjects. The level of vigilance measured as reaction time improved after wearing blue glasses, while no significant effect was observed with the other colored or clear glasses. This study indicates that 30-min wearing of blue glasses improves psychomotor vigilance after that and suggests that rather than the absolute intensity of the blue wavelength light, the relative content is the determinant for increasing arousal level.",

The lowest J C was obtained from pure ErBa2Cu3O7-delta films on SrTiO3 substrates because of low dislocation densities, c-axis correlated pinning properties are obtained from pure ErBa2Cu3O7-delta films on BaSnO3 buffered MgO substrates indicating there exist dislocations along the c-axis of the films. The highest J C was obtained from BaSnO3 doped ErBa2Cu3O7-delta films on SrTiO3 substrates. Almost the same J C was obtained from BaSnO3 doped ErBa2Cu3O7-delta films on BaSnO3 buffered MgO substrates. 2 wt% BaSnO3 doping into ErBa2Cu3O7-delta films on BaSnO3 buffered MgO substrates are very effective to enhance J C S of the films at a high magnetic field.",

        "abstract": "A 240-kDa protein isolated from porcine aortic smooth muscle as a substrate for cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGMP kinase) whose phosphorylation was in a close association with stimulation of partially purified plasma membrane Ca2+-pump ATPase by the kinase was later shown to represent splicing variants of type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor. To further clarify the role played by this protein in the stimulation of Ca2+-pump ATPase, it was attempted in the present study to specifically remove the protein by immunoprecipitation with an antibody specific to type 1 IP3 receptor. Contrary to expectation, stimulation of the ATPase by cGMP kinase was still observed after removal of the IP3 receptor. Furthermore, cGMP kinase stimulated a highly purified preparation of Ca2+-pump ATPase deprived of IP3 receptor when the concentrations of the ATPase were low enough (10-20 nM) to make it retain a monomeric form, while it did not produce stimulation when the concentration of the enzyme was increased to 40 nM at which the enzyme is known to take an oligomeric, fully activated form insensitive to activation by calmodulin. Heat-inactivated cGMP kinase and cGMP kinase without cGMP failed to stimulate the highly purified Ca2+-pump ATPase. In addition, type Iα but not type Iβ cGMP kinase was found to stimulate the ATPase. The stimulation of Ca2+-pump ATPase by cGMP kinase occurs without any detectable phosphorylation of the ATPase. In conclusion, cGMP kinase can stimulate the plasma membrane Ca2+-pump ATPase when it is in a monomeric form without phosphorylating the Ca2+-pump ATPase and that of the two cGMP kinase isozymes found in the vascular smooth muscle, only type Iα cGMP kinase participates in the stimulation.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the effect of the BaHfO 3 (BHO) nanorodsu0027 configuration on transport properties at artificial grain boundaries (GBs) in SmBa 2 Cu 3 O y (SmBCO) superconducting films. To control the nanorodsu0027 configuration at the GBs, we deposited 3.0 vol.% BHO-doped SmBCO films on 5° [001]-tilt bicrystal (LaAlO 3  0.3 (SrAl 0.5 Ta 0.5 O 3  0.7 substrates at relatively low growth temperature of 750 °C via the pulsed laser deposition method adopting a seed layer technique. According to the transport results, the critical current density (J c ) at the GBs was improved in the films with the nanorods at low magnetic fields. In addition, field angular dependence of Jc was also improved for a wide range of field directions with a broad peak for B//c. We estimated that the BHO nanorods in the GBs pinned the Abrikosov-Josephson (AJ) vortices with various directions in the GBs. AJ vortex pinning can be controlled by configuration of a pinning center at GB.",

After normal culture (10% FBS), medium exchange itself evoked marked increases in IP 3 levels in A10 cells that masked the net change in IP 3 in response to vasopressin (100 nM). 2. Low-serum (0.3% FBS) culture for 10 days abolished the increase in IP 3 by medium exchange, and increased expression of cGMP kinase. 3. Stimulation of cells with vasopressin (100 nM) by a pipetting procedure, increased IP 3 levels irrespective of culture conditions. 4. This cell line therefore could be used in a contractile form (after low-serum culture) with pipetting procedure to observe IP 3 response, especially with regard to interactions with the cGMP signaling system.",

To clarify the self-organization mechanism, we developed a three-dimensional Monte Carlo (3D-MC) simulation code using a simple model and simulated nanorod growth under various growth conditions. As a result, the self-organization of nanorods was reproduced by 3D-MC simulations and we clarified the nanorod growth mechanism as follows. The growth mode of MCO particles was 3D island growth due to the instability of the interface of the MCO and the substrate. On the other hand, that of REBCO particles was 2D island growth. There were diverse nanostructures, which were strongly affected by substrate temperature (T s) and deposition rate (v dep). We constructed a contour plot of the nanorod number density and a phase diagram of the nanostructures depending on T s and v dep.",

In this study, we describe the control orientation of the films. The films were prepared on SrTiO 3 (100) single crystalline substrate using liquid state sources in order to discuss such issues as the a-axis growth mechanism. At the temperature between 650 and 700°C the films deposited on SrTiO 3 were strongly a-axis oriented even without photo-assistance. The TEM image of the film deposited at 700°C showed that the structure is c-axis oriented grains in the region less than about 200Åfrom the substrate, whereas the main structure is a-axis oriented grains. Thus liquid sources enable us to control the crystalline orientation in MOCVD, that has never been attained.",

        "abstract": "We fabricated Sm 1 + x Ba 2 − x Cu 3 O y (SmBCO) films on a c -axis oriented thin SmBCO seed layer by low temperature growth technique. The orientation of the film without seed layer changed from c -axis to a -axis as decrease of substrate temperature ( T s ), whereas the SmBCO film with seed layer showed the complete c -axis orientation at low- T s . This orientation mechanism was explained in view of adatom surface migration. In addition, the J c value of the film on seed layer increased with decreasing T s . From XRD φ -scan measurement, it is found that in-plane alignment of SmBCO film was improved by decreasing T s . We considered that this behavior in high J c SmBCO films was ascribed to improved in-plane alignment. PACS 74.76.−w Keywords Sm 1 + x Ba 2 − x Cu 3 O y film Seed layer Low temperature growth technique Pulsed laser deposition 1 Introduction Great efforts have been made for last few years to develop coated conductors based on REBa 2 Cu 3 O y (REBCO) superconductors with high critical current density ( J c ). The superconducting Sm 1 + x Ba 2 − x Cu 3 O y (SmBCO) material is interesting for its potential applications under high magnetic fields, compared with Y 1 Ba 2 Cu 3 O y (YBCO) material. Recently, high-quality SmBCO films for the application of coated conductor were fabricated on MgO [1] , SrTiO 3 [2] , BaZrO 3 /MgO [3] using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). Some of these SmBCO films show higher superconducting transport-properties compared with those of YBCO films. We have fabricated high-quality c -axis oriented SmBCO films on MgO(1 0 0) substrates by PLD. The critical temperature ( T c ) and J c of these films showed over 90 K and 8 MA/cm 2 (77 K, self-field), respectively. It was, however, difficult to fabricate SmBCO films with high superconducting properties because of formation of solid-solution phase in the material due to substitution of RE 3+ into Ba 2+ site [4–6] . Furthermore, the SmBCO films have a narrow processing window such as the requirements for the substrate temperature for c -axis oriented films, which is approximately 100 °C higher than that of YBCO films [7] . A high deposition temperature results in the interdiffusion between the substrate and the films, so that low temperature processes are preferable for many applications. In this paper, we discussed the orientation mechanism and superconducting properties of SmBCO films deposited at lower deposition temperatures on the c -axis oriented seed layer. 2 Experimental SmBCO targets were sintered by a standard solid-state reaction method, starting from the mixture of Sm 2 O 3 , BaO 2 and CuO powders. Appropriate amount was accurately weighed and thoroughly mixed. The mixed powder was first fired at 700 °C. The reacted product was reground and pressed into pellets. Sintering was carried out at 850, 900 and 920 °C, respectively, for 24 h each time with repeated regrinding and repressing processes. In this work, Sm/Ba substitution quantity x in target was adjusted to 0.08. SmBCO thin films were deposited on MgO(1 0 0) substrates by PLD using an ArF excimer laser. The substrate was placed 50 mm above the laser target. Excimer laser was operated at a repetition rate of 10 Hz and the beam was focused on the targets to keep approximately 1 J/cm 2 fluence. During the deposition, oxygen partial pressure ( p O 2 ) was kept at 400 mTorr for both the seed and upper SmBCO layers. A SmBCO seed layer with a thickness of 50 nm was deposited at 830 °C. An upper SmBCO layer with a thickness of 500–600 nm was deposited at 700–800 °C. After the deposition, the oxygen gas was introduced up to 20 Torr, and then the samples were immediately cooled to room temperature. The crystal structure and in-plane alignment of the SmBCO films were examined by X-ray θ –2 θ diffraction and φ -scan using CuKα radiation, respectively. The film thickness of SmBCO thin films was evaluated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Transport currents were measured at 77 K and self magnetic fields. Samples were patterned to form a microbridge of ∼100 μm width. The T c and J c of the films were evaluated by dc four-probe resistance measurements. Before T c and J c measurements, the SmBCO films were annealed at 350 °C for 1–2 h in oxygen flow. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the difference of a , c -orientation ratio of the films with and without seed layer as a function of substrate temperature ( T s ). The values of the vertical axis in the figure were calculated from the ratio of XRD peak intensity of (2 0 0) and (0 0 5). In the figures, open circles denote data of the films without seed layer and closed circles denote data of those with seed layer. In the case of the film without the seed layer, orientations of the film change from c -axis to a -axis as the decrease of T s which is similar to the results observed for YBCO films [8] . In this case, the deposition at higher T s above 800 °C is required for complete c -axis oriented SmBCO film on MgO substrate. On the other hand, the film with seed layer showed the complete c -axis orientation in the range of T s =700–800 °C. Fig. 2 shows T s dependence of the FWHM determined from XRD- φ scan ( δφ ). All samples, including the film with and without seed layer, have grains mainly oriented cube-on-cube texture on the MgO substrate. The δφ of the film without seed layer was about 1.8°. On the other hand, in the case of with seed layer, the δφ decreased to the minimum value of about 1.3° as decreasing T s to 760 °C. Fig. 3 shows a cross-sectional TEM image of the SmBCO film with seed layer deposited at 760 °C. It is found that Cu–O chains of the upper layer were parallel to the substrate plane. In addition, the interface between upper SmBCO layer and seed SmBCO layer was not clear, that is, the upper SmBCO layer could grow epitaxially on the seed SmBCO layer. From these results, it is found that c -axis oriented SmBCO films could be fabricated using the seed layer at T s lower by 100 °C than that of the films without seed layer. In addition, in-plane alignment of the films with the seed layer was improved as decreasing T s . Fig. 4 shows a T s dependence of J c values for SmBCO films with and without seed layer. The J c values were measured at 77 K and zero magnetic field. In the case of the film without the seed layer, the SmBCO film showed the J c value of about 2 MA/cm 2 . On the other hand, in the case of with seed layer, the J c value increased with decreasing T s to 760 °C and reached a high value of about 5 MA/cm 2 . However, in the region below 760 °C, the J c value decreased as T s decreased. From these results, we can assume that the J c value increased with decreasing T s due to improved in-plane alignment and decreased in the region of T s below 760 °C due to deterioration of in-plane alignment. In order to discuss the orientation mechanism by which c -axis SmBCO film can grow at low- T s using seed layer, we observed surface morphologies of SmBCO films with and without seed layer by AFM. Fig. 5 shows the surface images of the films (a) with and (b) without seed layer deposited at 700 and 710 °C, respectively. It is found that the grain size of the film with seed layer was lager than that of the film without seed layer, and average grain size of these films were about 200 and 100 nm, respectively. These results indicate that diffusion length of SmBCO particles on seed layer was larger than that on MgO. Izumi et al. proposed a model of a , c orientation mechanism from a viewpoint of surface migration [9] . According to this model, c -axis oriented YBCO film needs large diffusion length of adatom. In addition, Mukaida et al. indicated that migration length of YBCO perticles on YBCO films were longer than those on MgO substrates [10] . From these results, we can assume that the surface diffusion length of adatom on the seed layer was longer than that on MgO substrate, so that SmBCO films with the seed layer showed a complete c -axis orientation at low- T s . 4 Conclusion We fabricated c -axis oriented SmBCO films by the low temperature growth technique on a c -axis oriented thin SmBCO seed layer. From the XRD measurements, the film with seed layer showed the complete c -axis orientation at low- T s . We assume that the adatom surface diffusion length on seed layer was longer than that on the MgO substrate, so that SmBCO film with seed layer showed a complete c -axis orientation at low- T s . Moreover, the J c value of the film with seed layer increased with decreasing T s to 760 °C and reached a high value of about 5 MA/cm 2 . From XRD φ -scan measurements, it was found that in-plane alignment of SmBCO film was improved by decreasing T s . We considered that the higher J c at low- T s was due to improved in-plane alignment. References [1] Y. Sudoh Y. Ichino M. Itoh Y. Yoshida Y. Takai I. Hirabayashi Jpn. J. Appl.

The degassing pipes are continuously releasing highly concentrated ferrous iron water to the surface of the lake. The lake surface, which once used to be a deep blue, has now changed into reddish brown, due to the formation of colloidal ferric iron. From December 2001 to January 2011, one degassing pipe transported 560 tons of iron as colloidal ferric iron per year, and after late 2011, three pipes have been transporting about 1100 tons per year. The degassing fountain contains highly concentrated calcium and magnesium other than iron resulting in enrichment of those substances. Although the colloidal ferric iron might have adverse effect on fish and/or other aqueous biota, the lake water remained safe for domestic water use.",

This result suggests that the protein fractionation method is more suitable for shotgun analysis while peptide fractionation suits well quantitative peptide analysis [isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) or tandem mass tags (TMT)].

        "abstract": "We report superconducting properties and microstructures of a ErBa 2 Cu 3 O 7− δ (ErBCO) film with 1.5 wt% BaNb 2 O 6 (BNO) grown by pulse laser deposition (PLD) on a SrTiO 3 (STO) substrate. The BNO was introduced into the ErBCO film as an artificial pinning center. Nano-rods originated in the BNO-doping and some particulate defects were clearly observed in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the ErBCO film. The ErBCO film with BNO-doping (BNO + ErBCO) had almost the same critical temperature ( T C ) as that of a pure ErBCO film. On the other hand, the BNO + ErBCO film showed less critical current density ( J C ) than that of the pure ErBCO film. The angular peaks for H ∥ c -axis on J C – B – θ curves were not confirmed under all the measured external magnetic fields. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated the high orientation to the both c -axis and in-plane for the obtained film. However, the low surface flatness was confirmed by the TEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM) observation. PACS 74.72.Jt 74.78.Bz Keywords ErBa 2 Cu 3 O 7− δ (ErBCO) film BaNb 2 O 6 (BNO)-doping 1 Introduction Recently, an improvement of superconducting properties has been proceeded by introducing pinning centers into REBa 2 Cu 3 O 7− δ (REBCO, RE: rare earth elements) superconducting materials. We have been focusing on ErBCO since it has higher T C value than that of YBCO [1] . In addition, it has not been reported the substitution problems between RE and Ba atoms in ErBCO. Furthermore, oxygen contents in the ErBCO can be easily controlled comparing with other REBCO. Improvements of J C performance were demonstrated at 77 K in various external magnetic fields by introduction of pinning centers into the ErBCO. BaZrO 3 (BZO)-doped ErBCO films grown on STO substrates were reported to have c -axis-correlated pinning centers [2,3] . In these papers, it is recognized that the dispersed BZO regions (which is called as nano-rod [2] ) in ErBCO film was effective as pinning centers. However, when the amount of BZO-doping into the ErBCO films increases, T C s of the films are degraded. Introduction of pinning centers in the ErBCO film without any T C degradation is important for realizing the high J C in external magnetic fields. It was found that high T C value was maintained in the bulk ErBCO with BNO which has a different crystal structure from a cubic perovskite one such as BZO [4] . T C on and T C zero for bulk ErBCO with 1.5 wt% BNO, respectively, were reported to be 95 and 93 K [5] . In this study, we investigate the superconducting properties and microstructures of the BNO + ErBCO films grown on STO substrates. 2 Experimental 2.1 Growth of ErBCO film We grew a BNO + ErBCO film on a (1 0 0)-oriented STO substrate (10 mm × 10 mm) by a PLD technique. A Lambda Physik Ar-F excimer laser (wave length = 193 nm) was used for laser ablation. A sintered ErBCO ceramic bulk was used as a target for the laser, which contains 1.5 wt% BNO. The target diameter and thickness are 40 and 5 mm, respectively. The target was ablated by the high-energy laser, then the film consisted of the objective composition was deposited on the confronted substrate to the target. During the film growth, both the target and the substrate were rotated to obtain the uniform composition and thickness of the film. The substrate was fixed with silver paste to a metal-substrate holder, which was heated by a lamp heater. The substrate temperatures at the BNO + ErBCO film growth was 760 °C. The substrate temperature was monitored by a thermocouple and calibrated by an optical pyrometer. The laser frequency was 1 Hz and the laser energy was 560 mJ. The typical growth times of BNO + ErBCO film were 30 min. During the BNO + ErBCO film growth, the O 2 background pressure was fixed at 400 mTorr. Ex situ post-annealing was performed at 450 °C for 15 min in flowing oxygen after the film growth. After the O 2 annealing, the film was cooled rapidly to room temperature to preserve the oxygen contents of the BNO + ErBCO film at the annealed temperatures. 2.2 Evaluation of grown film Preferred orientation of the BNO + ErBCO film grown in this study was determined by X-ray θ /2 θ diffraction with Cu Kα radiation. In-plane orientation of the BNO + ErBCO film was evaluated by X-ray φ -scan by using an (1 0 2) plane of ErBCO. The resistivity–temperature ( ρ – T ) curves of the grown BNO + ErBCO film and the angular dependence of J C ( J C – B – θ ) were characterized by a conventional four-probe method in magnetic fields. The lattice images and grain azimuth of the film was observed by TEM. The surface morphologies were observed by AFM. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Crystallinity of BNO + ErBCO film Fig. 1 a shows a typical X-ray θ /2 θ diffraction pattern of the film. 0 0 l peaks of ErBCO were detected, then the film was c -axis oriented. The c -axis lattice length of the grown film was calculated to be 11.70 Å from the X-ray θ /2 θ diffraction pattern using an N–R function [6] . This length was longer than 11.68 Å of the pure ErBCO film. Fig. 1 b shows a typical X-ray φ -scan diffraction pattern of the film. Each four peaks were clearly detected in an interval of 90°; this indicates that the film has a four-hold symmetry on the STO substrate. 3.2 Cross-sectional observation of BNO + ErBCO film Cross-sectional TEM images of the 1.5 wt% BNO + ErBCO film were observed in order to investigate microstructures in the film by TEM. Nano-rods originated in the BNO-doping into ErBCO were clearly confirmed in the film as shown in Fig. 2 a. The some nano-rods are shown by arrows in Fig. 2 a. It was recognized that the BNO-doping induced defects into ErBCO film. Then it was thought that the nano-rod structures expanded the film to the c -axis direction of the film. The boundaries between nano-rods and the epitaxially grown ErBCO parts could be considered to be effective pinning centers. The nano-rods were confirmed to be Nb rich and Cu poor by energy dispersive spectroscopy. Besides the presence of the nano-rods, some particulates with various sizes were often observed in the film as shown in Fig. 2 b. Those are shown by arrows in Fig. 2 b. The composition of those defects could not be identified because it was confirmed that diffracted spots for the observed area arranged irregularity by selected area electron diffraction pattern. The film thickness is about 300 nm. As for the regions where those defect are confirmed, the film becomes thin. It is estimated that the surface morphologies are also rough by AFM. 3.3 ρ – T properties of BNO + ErBCO film We observed the ρ – T curves of the 1.5 wt% BNO + ErBCO film in order to investigate the influence of the BNO-doping on the T C of ErBCO. Fig. 3 shows the temperature dependence of the normalized in-plane resistivity [ ρ ( T )/ ρ (95 K)] for the annealed film under various external magnetic fields from 0 to 9 T for H ∥ c -axis condition. The T C zero value of the film in self-field was confirmed to be 90.3 K. From the comparison with T C zero value of a pure ErBCO film (=90.2 K) [1] , the BNO doped film showed no T C degradation. The T irr values determined from Fig. 3 were in good agreement with those of the pure ErBCO film [1] . Consequently, high T C ErBCO film was obtained with nano-rod structures originated from the BNO doping. 3.4 Critical current properties of BNO + ErBCO film The J C value of the 1.5 wt% BNO + ErBCO film in self-field was 0.2 MA/cm 2 . On the other hand, the J C value of pure ErBCO film was in self-field was 0.5 MA/cm 2 . Then, we observed J C – B – θ curves of the 1.5 wt% BNO + ErBCO film to investigate the pinning effect of BNO-doping on the J C anisotropy of ErBCO. Fig. 4 shows angular dependence of the in-plane J C for the film at 77 K under various external magnetic fields from 0.5 to 5 T. The film was rotated maintaining J C ⊥ H in order to obtain anisotropic flux pinning properties systematically, as shown in inset of Fig. 4 . The angular peaks for H ∥ c -axis were not confirmed under all the measured external magnetic fields. However, it was confirmed that the J C anisotropy were controlled lower than those of pure ErBCO in low magnetic fields. 3.5 Surface morphologies of BNO + ErBCO film We observed surface morphologies of the 1.5 wt% BNO + ErBCO film. As shown in Fig. 5 , the surface morphologies of the film were rough over the whole scanned area. In the scaned area of 25 μm × 25 μm, the peak to valley distance ( P – V ) for the film reached to almost 150 nm. On the other hand, The P – V value for pure ErBCO film was about 30 nm. As a result, The surface of the 1.5 wt% BNO + ErBCO film was estimated to be rough, over the whole scaned area. 3.6 Discussion The 1.5 wt% BNO + ErBCO film was confirmed to be c -axis oriented and to have a four-hold symmetry on the STO substrate by X-ray diffraction patterns. Nano-rods originated from the BNO-doping into ErBCO were observed clearly in the TEM images. The growth of these nano-rods will raise the possibility of BNO as a new pinning center material. The BNO + ErBCO film has almost the same T C as that of a pure ErBCO film. It is considered that 1.5 wt% BNO-doping into the ErBCO film may be effective as pinning center because the film in spite of doping maintains high T C of the ErBCO. The following two points were found about the critical current property. (1) The J C value of the 1.5 wt% BNO + ErBCO film in self-field was lower than that of the pure ErBCO film. Here, we emphasize surface morphologies of the BNO + ErBCO film. The surface was estimated to be rough, over the whole scaned area by AFM observation. The current paths of the film are probably narrower. Although the mechanism on the J C enhancement for surface morphologies is still unclear, we deduce that the critical current property will increase by growing a film with uniform thickness. It is necessary for the film to improve surface condition from optimization of growth conditions. (2) A peak for H ∥ c -axis was not confirmed in the J C – B – θ curves against our expectation. This result is different from those of BZO-doped ErBCO films with c -axis-correlated pinning centers. We deduce that the film condition prevented pinning effect with nano-rods in the film. For elucidation of that mechanism, remeasurement of J C – B – θ for this film or further investigations in order to compare with BZO nano-rods, such as composition and crystal structure for the nano-rods observed in the BNO + ErBCO film are required. Furthermore, we are analyzing also nano-rod size, distribution density and form depending on the various amount of BNO or BZO-doping into ErBCO films. Then, it is necessary to investigate the fluctuation of T C to the amount of BNO-doping simultaneously. 4 Conclusions We grew the 1.5 wt% BNO + ErBCO film on the STO substrate by PLD and investigated the superconducting properties and the microstructures of the film. The film was confirmed to be c -axis oriented and to have a four-hold symmetry on the STO substrate by X-ray diffraction patterns. The nano-rods originated in the BNO-doping into ErBCO and some particulates were observed clearly in the TEM images. The BNO + ErBCO film has almost the same T C as that of a pure ErBCO film. However, a peak for H ∥ c -axis was not confirmed in the J C – B – θ curves against our expectation. The surface morphologies of the film were estimated to be rough over the whole scan area by AFM observation. As for nano-rods observed in the TEM image, it is necessary to investigate the cause why those does not have effect as c -axis-correlated pinning centers. Moreover, composition and crystal structure analysis is required comparing with BZO nano-rods. The film condition was probably related with decreasing the critical current properties. Now, we are analyzing the optimization of growth conditions for the BNO + ErBCO film. References [1] S. Horii M. Mukaida K. Matsumoto T. Ohazama A. Ichinose Y. Yoshida J. Shimoyama K.

        "abstract": "We compared angiographic and clinical outcomes after successful revascularization of chronic total coronary arterial occlusion with the placement of the Palmaz-Schatz stent (43 patients) and conventional balloon angioplasty (53 patients). After the procedure, the coronary stent led to a greater minimal lumen diameter than conventional balloon angioplasty (2.6 vs 1.7 mm, p < 0.001), resulting in a smaller residual stenosis (6.5% vs 36.7%, p < 0.001). At 6-month follow-up, there was no significant difference in late loss between the groups, resulting in a larger minimal lumen diameter at follow-up in the stent group (1.8 vs 1.1 mm, p < 0.001). The incidence of restenosis was lower in the stent group (27.9% vs 56.6%, p < 0.005). The frequency of the combination of myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass graft surgery tended to be less in the stent group (2.3% vs 11.3%, P = 0.09). Placement of the Palmaz-Schatz stent improved left ventricular ejection fraction by 26% in patients who had reduced left ventricular function (p < 0.05), but conventional balloon angioplasty did not. Thus, placement of the Palmaz-Schatz stent provided a wider lumen than did conventional balloon angioplasty and, therefore, reduced the incidence of restenosis in chronic total coronary arterial occlusion. The lower restenosis rate of coronary stenting would be beneficial for long-term clinical outcome in patients with chronic total occlusion.",

This system consists of an ovomucoid protein chiral stationary phase coupled to an achiral reversed-phase column via a dilution tube and a trapping column. The reversed-phase column was used to separate and quantitate VA, its metabolites, and internal standard, without interference from plasma components. Then each of the eluates containing VA and its metabolites was selectively switched into a sampling loop, and the samples were transferred successively to the trapping column after dilution with a new mobile phase. After concentration on the trapping column, each sample was passed to the ovomucoid column, where the enantiomers were resolved and quantitated. The mobile phases for both HPLC columns were independently optimized and the diffusion of the sample during column switching was minimized. This method was shown to be efficient and reliable.",

        "abstract": "The effects of oxygen free radicals on coronary vasoreactivity remain unknown.To examine whether oxygen free radicals increase coronary arterial tone and sensitivity to vasoconstrictor stimulation in closed-chest dogs.Oxygen radicals were generated by the reaction of xanthine plus xanthine oxidase (XXO) and effects of these substances on the left coronary artery (the percentage diameter change) and on the constrictor effect of ergonovine were examined in vivo in 19 anesthetized, closed-chest dogs by selective coronary angiography. The effects of XXO solution and ergonovine were assessed in a cumulative fashion using 100, 200, and 300 ml XXO and 50, 100, 150, and 200 micrograms ergonovine, in 5 (group I) and 6 dogs (group II), respectively. The effects of XXO on the constrictor responses elicited by 50 micrograms ergonovine were examined in eight dogs (group III). Changes in the vascular endothelium were examined by postmortem electron microscopic examination.Oxidative injury alone produced slight constriction of the coronary artery, but the change was not significant. However, ergonovine-induced vasoconstriction was enhanced after administration of 100 and 200 ml (cumulative amount) XXO solution (P < 0.05, group II versus group III). The enhancement was no longer observed after administration of 300 ml (cumulative amount) XXO solution. Scanning and transmission electron microscopies revealed the formation of blebs and ulceration in the coronary endothelium after administration of XXO solution.These results suggest that oxygen radicals can enhance the ergonovine-induced coronary vasoconstriction in a concentration-dependent manner. There seems to be a critical level of oxygen radicals for the production of the effect.",

To examine the relationship between bile acids and colorectal neoplasia, bile acids in colon residual liquid or fecal material were analyzed in 18 patients with colorectal adenoma, 12 patients with colorectal cancer, and 18 healthy control subjects. High-performance liquid chromatography combined with immobilized 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in column form showed a significant elevation in the proportion of deoxycholic acid (P < 0.05), lithocholic acid (P < 0.05), secondary bile acids (deoxycholic acid plus lithocholic acid) (P < 0.02), and the chenodeoxycholic acid-lithocholic acid family (chenodeoxycholic acid plus lithocholic acid) (P < 0.05) in the colon residual liquid or fecal material of the patients with colorectal adenoma compared with proportions in the control subjects. A similar trend was noted in the patients with colorectal cancer compared to the control subjects. These findings suggested that an increase in the proportion of secondary bile acids, in particular, of lithocholic acid, was closely related to the pathogenesis of colorectal neoplasia.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the flux pinning properties of nano-rods comprised of BaZrO 3 and BaSnO 3 in REBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (REBCO, RE: rare earth elements) thin films. The doping amounts of BaZrO 3 in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ thin films and BaSnO 3 in ErBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ thin films were varied with 0–3.5 wt% and 2.0–4.0 wt%, respectively. The in-field critical current density of 1.5 wt%-BaZrO 3 -doped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ film was higher than those of any other samples measured in this study. The α values in the relation of J c – B −α are 0.2–0.3 for the BaZrO 3 - and BaSnO 3 -doped films. This fact shows the introduction of nano-rods is effective for the less magnetic field dependence of J c . As one of the important results, it was found that the introduction of nano-rods caused the peak or kink in the magnetic field dependence of the pinning parameter m which was derived from the scaling of current–voltage characteristics. This phenomenon is the sign of the flux pinning due to the one-dimensional pinning centers. The peak fields of the BaSnO 3 -doped films were slightly lower than those of the BaZrO 3 -doped films, though the dope levels of the BaSnO 3 -doped films were higher. This suggests that the diameter of BaSnO 3 nano-rods is larger than that of BaZrO 3 ones.",

        "abstract": "We have investigated the dependence of the crystallinity and the superconducting characteristics in the EuBa 2 Cu 3 O 7− δ (EuBCO) thin films on oxygen content. The EuBCO films were grown using a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) under an oxygen and an ozone atmosphere on (1 0 0) SrTiO 3 substrates. The c -axis length of as-grown EuBCO films under the oxygen atmosphere was longer than that of the bulk. The c -axis length of in situ annealed EuBCO films was shortened as compared with the as-grown EuBCO films. Additionally, the surface resistance ( R s ) of the in situ 3 and 6 h annealed EuBCO films was lower than that of as-grown EuBCO films. However, the surface resistance of in situ annealed more than 24 h EuBCO films was not lower than that of in situ 6 h EuBCO films. The c -axis length of the as-grown EuBCO films grown under an ozone atmosphere showed 1.170 nm. It must be noted that the lowest surface resistance of EuBCO films was obtained by EuBCO films grown under the ozone atmosphere without any in situ annealing. We found that the growth of EuBCO films under the ozone atmosphere was good to dope oxygen in the films. PACS 74.72.Jt 74.76.Bz Keywords EuBa 2 Cu 3 O 7− δ EuBCO Ozone Surface resistance 1 Introduction Since the discovery of high- T C superconductivity (HTS) in copper oxide materials, YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7− δ is one of the most widely investigated materials in the high- T C superconducting films. Recently, REBa 2 Cu 3 O 7− δ have attracted attentions because these RE123 materials exhibit some properties that Y123 dose not exhibit [1,2] . Nd, Sm and Eu have ionic radii similar to Ba, and this can lead to a site disorder in the system. For example, the substitution of Nd 3+ for Ba 2+ in Nd123 can depress the transition temperature when the substitution level is too high, but it can also act as a pinning center to enhance the critical current density when the level is in the appropriate range [3] . The substitution of Eu of Ba is not too high in comparison with that of Nd of Ba. Therefore, we focus on the EuBCO films. In HTS films, oxygen content in films is very important. It is known that superconducting characteristics in films are improved by optimization of oxygen content. The oxygen annealing effects have been reported in the EuBCO films [4] . Therefore, we believe that surface resistance of EuBCO films could be also reduced by optimization of oxygen content. There are several controlling methods to optimize oxygen content of the films. One is annealing after the growth and the other is the usage of ozone during the growth. There are no detail reports on the growth of HTS films by pulsed laser deposition under the atmosphere including ozone (the ozone atmosphere). In this paper, we report the crystallinity and the superconducting characteristics against oxygen content. Especially, we discuss EuBCO films under the ozone atmosphere. 2 Experiments 2.1 Fabrication of EuBCO thin films The EuBCO films were grown by ArF excimer pulsed laser deposition (PLD). We used an (1 0 0) SrTiO 3 substrate as a lattice matched substrate. The lattice mismatch between EuBCO and SrTiO 3 is 0.2% for the a -axis direction, and 1.7% for the c -axis direction. In the film growth, the laser power was kept around 300 mJ/pulse. The pulse frequency of the laser was fixed at 1 Hz. The growth time was 20 min. The substrate temperature during growth was 800 °C. In this study we fabricated the as-grown EuBCO thin films by two different gases; oxygen and ozone. The oxygen atmosphere is O 2 100% and the ozone atmosphere is O 3 7% and O 2 93%. The gas pressure of the both atmosphere was kept at 1 Torr during the growth. As-grown EuBCO films grown under the oxygen atmosphere were in situ annealed at 500 °C. After the growth, the oxygen pressure was increased until 720 Torr in the chamber by filling the oxygen quickly with decreasing the substrate temperature. At the annealing temperature of 500 °C, the films are annealed for 0–110 h. On the contrary, EuBCO films grown under the ozone atmosphere were not annealed. 2.2 Evaluation of EuBCO films Preferred orientation of EuBCO films was determined by measuring the θ –2 θ scanning of the films by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu-Kα radiation. The c -axis length of the films was estimated by using a Nelson–Riley function. In-plane orientation of EuBCO films was evaluated by X-ray ϕ -scanning using the (1 0 2) plane of EuBCO. The full-width at the half-maximum of rocking curve (δ ω ) was measured to evaluate the crystallinity of the films by using (0 0 5) plane of EuBCO. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) observations were performed to evaluate surface morphology. The surface resistance ( R s ) was measured by a dielectric resonator method at 38 GHz. Critical temperature ( T C ) was determined from the ρ – T curve using a conventional four-probe method. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows a typical X-ray diffraction pattern of the EuBCO films grown under the ozone atmosphere. Only the 00 l reflections from the EuBCO films were observed, indicating that the EuBCO films were c -axis orientation. The as-grown EuBCO films grown under the oxygen atmosphere and the annealed EuBCO films showed the same X-ray diffraction patterns. We evaluated in-plane orientation by X-ray ϕ -scanning patterns of the EuBCO films. We observed four sharp peaks, indicating that the EuBCO films on the SrTiO 3 substrate were fully in-plane aligned. According to the angle of the in-plane rotation, the [1 0 0] axis of the EuBCO film was parallel to the [1 0 0] axis of the SrTiO 3 substrate. Then the EuBCO films grew epitaxially on the SrTiO 3 substrates. All of the EuBCO films grown under the oxygen atmosphere with and without annealing and under the ozone atmosphere showed the similar X-ray ϕ -scanning pattern. Fig. 2 shows the in situ annealing time dependence of the c -axis length and the value of δ ω for EuBCO films grown under the oxygen atmosphere. It was clearly observed that the c -axis length of EuBCO films annealed for 3 h was shortened, respect to that of as-grown EuBCO films. This result indicated that oxygen was doped into the EuBCO films by annealing. However, the c -axis length was independent of the annealing time more than 3 h. On the other hand, the δ ω decreases with increasing the annealing time, indicating that the crystallinity was improved by annealing. We guess that it is difficult to dope oxygen into the high crystalline quality EuBCO films. It must be noted the shortest c -axis length of 1.170 nm was obtained in EuBCO films grown under the ozone atmosphere. This result indicated that the EuBCO film grown under the ozone atmosphere was mostly oxygen doped. However, the δ ω of EuBCO films grown under the ozone atmosphere was larger than that of others. The crystallinity of EuBCO films grown under the ozone atmosphere was poor. It is thought that the poor crystallinity reflects on the surface morphology of EuBCO films. Then we observed surface morphologies by AFM. Figs. 3 and 4 show an AFM image of EuBCO films grown under the ozone atmosphere and oxygen atmosphere, respectively. The scan area is 10 μm × 10 μm. The surface roughness of EuBCO films grown under the ozone atmosphere and the oxygen atmosphere was 24 nm and 21 nm, respectively. Thus there were few differences in surface morphologies. Then it is thought that the inner crystallinity of the EuBCO films under the ozone atmosphere is poor. In order to investigate the relation between the superconducting characteristics and the oxygen content in EuBCO films, we measured the surface resistance of the EuBCO films. Fig. 5 shows the relation between the c -axis length dependence and the surface resistance of several films at 20 K. From Fig. 5 , the longer the c -axis length became the higher the surface resistance at 20 K. In the case of EuBCO films with the shortest c -axis length, which was grown under the ozone atmosphere, the surface resistance was as low as 1.2 mΩ for the oxygen doped EuBCO films at 20 K as shown in Fig. 5 . Fig. 6 shows a typical temperature dependence of the surface resistance of the EuBCO film grown under the ozone atmosphere. The R s of an YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7− δ film on a CeO 2 buffered r -cut Al 2 O 3 substrate prepared by THEVA is also shown as a reference. It is interesting that the surface resistance of the EuBCO film grown under the ozone was as low as that of the YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7− δ film. From the result, it is thought that oxygen is doped in EuBCO films grown under the ozone atmosphere. Fig. 7 shows a ρ – T curve of the EuBCO film grown under the ozone atmosphere. The zero resistance temperature ( T C ) is 88 K. Above the transition temperature, the film showed electrically a metallic behavior and the resistance curve was virtually linear to the origin. By growing films under the ozone atmosphere, the T C became high without any annealing. 4 Conclusion We measured the surface resistance of the EuBCO films. The R s of the in situ 3 and 6 h annealed EuBCO films was lower than that of as-grown EuBCO films. However, surface resistance of in situ more than 24 h annealed EuBCO films was not lower than that of in situ 6 h EuBCO films. The lowest surface resistance was obtained by EuBCO films grown under the ozone atmosphere. The EuBCO films grown under the ozone atmosphere were thought to be the most oxygen doped. Thus the usage of the ozone atmosphere during the film growth is very effective to dope oxygen. References [1] B. Staublepumpin V.C. Matijasevic B. Ilge J.E. Mooij W. Peterse P. Scholte F.

Subjects were 8 healthy men belonging to the mature futsal team (age: 35±3 years) and Futsal was held from 5:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. on Sunday. Pulse waves during sleeping were measured at home on exercise day and on control day. The mean pulse interval (MPI), standard deviation pulse interval (SDPI), low frequency component (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz), high frequency component (HF, 0.15-0.45 Hz) and the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF) were calculated from pulse interval time series every 30 min. As a result, MPI, SDPI, LF, HF of exercise day were significantly lower than control day (<0.0001). LF/HF of exercise day was significantly higher than control day (<0.05). Regarding change of HRV for every 30 min, MPI (<0.05), SDPI (=0.0003), LF (=0.0038), HF (<0.05) were observed significant changes. MPI and HF before wake-up did not reach the level of control day. It is thought that strenuous exercise in the evening promotes sympathetic nervous activity during night sleep and suggesting that pulse rate and HRV have not recovered by the wake-up time.",

        "abstract": "We have reported high-Jc Sm1+x,Ba2-x,Cu3Oy (SmBCO) films on single crystal MgO prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). In this study, we fabricate SmBCO films on metallic substrates using low temperature growth (LTG) technique, to investigate the availability of the LTG technique for coated conductors. The LTG-SmBCO films are deposited on PLD - CeO2/IBAD - YSZ/Hastelloy tapes. The critical current density (Jc) is 4.7 MA/cm2 (77 K, B//c, B = OT) and 0.23 MA/cm2 (77 K, B//c, B = 5 T). Furthermore, at 65 K and B = 17 T, the Jc of LTG-SmBCO film (B//c) reaches 0.03 MA /cm . These values are higher than those of conventional PLD-YBCO and PLD-SmBCO films. From these results, we suggest that the LTG is an effective technique for improving the magnetic field dependence of Jc of coated conductors.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) responses and circulatory responses to exercise in eight patients (five male and three female) with complete atrioventricular block (CAVB) treated with atrioventricular (AV) synchronous pacing, a symptom-limited, multistaged treadmill stress test was performed, and plasma norepinephrine (NE) and circulatory parameters were measured at rest, at peak exercise, and in the recovery period. The eight patients were tested using the fixed AV interval (150 or 156 msec). Their exercise tolerance was generally poor. In all measured points, plasma NE levels were significantly higher in the eight study patients than those in the 12 normal subjects (eight male and four female). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) of CAVB patients elevated significantly after exercise compared to that at peak exercise. Heart rate (HR) responses of CAVB patients were characterized by their poor increase at peak exercise. These results suggest that some latent cardiac dysfunction continues in the CAVB patients however satisfactorily the AV synchronous pacing might perform. AV synchronous pacing with three different kinds of auto-atrioventricular delay (auto-AVD) was applied to three of the eight patients. In each AVD mode, a treadmill stress test was performed repeatedly according to the same protocol. Plasma NE concentrations under the condition with fixed AVD at peak exercise increased compared to those under the other two conditions with auto-AVD. These findings suggest that AV synchronous pacing with auto-AVD was better than that with fixed AVD during exercise. Plasma NE response to exercise seems to be a useful indicator for evaluating the condition of patients treated with DDD pacemakers and their adaptation for cardiac function.",

Using the LTG technique, we can obtain a purely c-axis oriented SmBCO film even at low growth temperatures. The LTG technique also greatly increases the number density of BHO nanorods. The size and matching field of the BHO nanorods in the films were 5.4 nm and 9.9 T. Transport measurements were carried out, and a high irreversibility field (B irr) and strong flux pinning force density (F p) were obtained. The B irr was 15.1 T at 77 K for B//c. The maximum F p of 407 GN m−3 in 10 T at 40 K and 770 GN m−3 from 9 to 17 T at 20 K have been measured. We believe that the LTG technique can be considered as important for improving of flux pinning performance in BaMO3 (BMO: M = Zr, Sn and Hf)-doped SmBCO coated conductors.",

        "abstract": "The Sm 2 Fe 17 N x (1.2< x <2.1) of intermediate nitrogen contents prepared by a new method of nitrogenation were investigated about the hyperfine fields (HFs) at each Fe sites. The Mössbauer spectra of the samples could be analyzed as the superposition of spectra of the Sm 2 Fe 17 , the Sm 2 Fe 17 N 3 and a small component with the HF of 5 T. The fractions of the phases depend on the nitrogen contents and the annealing durations. No intermediate HF was detected in the samples of x =1.1–2.1 regardless of the annealing duration. With the crystal structural consideration of the Th 2 Zn 17 structure, the intermediate nitrogen content regions that could be detected by the X-ray diffraction and the magnetization measurements, should be magnetically composed of the mixtures of Fe–N and/or Fe–Fe–N hybridizations whose numbers are smaller than the case of Sm 2 Fe 17 N 3 . The chemical bonds formation in the system should be an important factor for the enhancement of the magnetic properties with nitrogen uptake, contrary to the facts expected and understood in the previous studies.",

        "abstract": "One hundred and seventy-two patients (110 were greater than or equal to 65 years and 62 were less than 65 years) with congestive heart failure (CHF) were prospectively evaluated to determine various pathophysiologic mechanisms of CHF. The incidence of CHF with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function was higher in elderly (30% vs 12%, p less than 0.05). Of the 110 elderly patients, LV systolic function was impaired in 77. Fifty-five patients had LV dilatation without increased wall thickness, and the clinical diagnosis was \"dilated cardiomyopathy in the elderly\". Twenty-two patients had hypertrophied LV and a high incidence of hypertension, and they were diagnosed as \"hypertensive heart failure\" due to contractile dysfunction. On the contrary, the remaining 33 patients did not have impaired LV contractile function. Thirteen patients lacking LV hypertrophy had enlarged atria. CHF was induced by reduced chamber compliance called \"the stiff heart syndrome\". Twenty patients had hypertrophied LV and a high incidence of hypertension. They were diagnosed as having \"hypertensive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy of the elderly\" and abnormalities of diastolic function accounted for the CHF. Since echocardiography can easily and accurately diagnose the pathophysiologic mechanism of CHF, an increased awareness of its occurrence in the elderly and use of echocardiography would reduce diagnostic and therapeutic errors.",

Chiral resolution of racemic azelastine, an antiallergic drug, was achieved on a conalbumin-conjugated silica gel column. The effects of the pH, the concentration of organic solvents and salts in the mobile phase, and the temperature on the capacity factor and resolution of racemic azelastine were examined. This column shows good stability and can separate optical isomers with an aqueous mobile phase. It should be very useful in studies on pharmacokinetics and in clinical chemistry.",

Patients with pure red cell aplasia, multiple myeloma or aplastic anemia had colorectal cancer at a significantly higher rate compared to those with leukemia (P< 0.005, P< 0.02, P< 0.01, respectively).It is possible that a relatively large number of patients with pure red cell aplasia, multiple myeloma or aplastic anemia will develop a colorectal cancer.",

        "abstract": "Early postnatal mammals, including human babies, can perform only basic motor tasks. The acquisition of skilled behaviors occurs later, requiring anatomical changes in neural circuitry to support the development of coordinated activation or suppression of functionally related muscle groups. How this circuit reorganization occurs during postnatal development remains poorly understood. Here we explore the connectivity between corticospinal (CS) neurons in the motor cortex and muscles in mice. Using trans-synaptic viral and electrophysiological assays, we identify the early postnatal reorganization of CS circuitry for antagonistic muscle pairs. We further show that this synaptic rearrangement requires the activity-dependent, non-apoptotic Bax/Bak-caspase signaling cascade. Adult Bax/Bak mutant mice exhibit aberrant co-activation of antagonistic muscle pairs and skilled grasping deficits but normal reaching and retrieval behaviors. Our findings reveal key cellular and molecular mechanisms driving postnatal motor circuit reorganization and the resulting impacts on muscle activation patterns and the execution of skilled movements.",

        "abstract": "Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) phosphorylated, in vitro, the large (MYPT1) and small (M20) regulatory subunits of myosin phosphatase (MP) with maximum stoichiometries of 1.8 and 0.6 mol of phosphate/mol subunit, respectively. The phosphorylation of these subunits by PKG did not affect the phosphatase activity towards the 20 kDa myosin light chain. However, phosphorylation of the MP holoenzyme decreased the binding of MP to phospholipid. The phosphorylation of the serine residue of the C-terminal part of MYPT1 was crucial for these interactions. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of MP by PKG is not a direct mechanism in activating MP activity, and that other indirect mechanisms, including the interaction between MP and phospholipids, might be candidates for Ca2+ desensitization via cGMP in smooth muscle.",

Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of red blood cells has been reported to be increased in these conditions. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between MCV and risk of colorectal adenoma.The subjects were 497 middle-aged (45-65 yr old) men who underwent both barium enema examination and total colonoscopy. The subjects answered a questionnaire regarding their alcohol consumption history, and their blood samples were analyzed. The subjects were divided into four groups three times: with or without alcoholism, and with or without adenoma according to alcohol intake, and according to the MCV value. Various variables were compared among the groups, and the odds ratios of adenoma were calculated.The MCV was higher in the alcoholic group than in the nonalcoholic group (p < 0.01) and in patients with adenoma than in those without adenoma (p < 0.0001). When the subjects were stratified by alcohol intake, the MCV value had a higher significant difference than alcohol intake, between patients with adenoma and those without adenoma. As for the MCV value, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of adenoma was 1.00 (referent); (<92), 1.20 (0.71-1.69); (> or =92 but <95), 2.61 (2.07-3.15); (> or =95 but <98); and 3.62 (2.99-4.25); (> or =98).A high MCV value may be used as a simple index of the risk of colorectal adenomas, regardless of alcohol consumption.",

Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) represents a dominant second messenger subserving the release of Ca2+ from intracellular store sites. The protein on the surface of which the IP3 receptor is located comprises an IP3-gated Ca2+ channel, and binding of IP3 to this receptor triggers the release of Ca2+ through this channel. The receptor for IP3 displays a close resemblance to the ryanodine receptor, another intracellular Ca2+ channel, in many molecular and physiological properties. Many lines of evidence strongly suggest the central role that the IP3 receptor plays in the conversion of numerous external stimuli to intracellular Ca2+ signals characterized by complex spatiotemporal patterns such as Ca2+ waves and oscillations. In this review, we shall summarize our current knowledge of the structure and function of the IP3 receptor in order to understand the way how the activity of this important receptor is regulated to accomodate itself to the generation of diverse intracellular Ca2+ signals.",

J  c  in the REBCO film is suppressed under magnetic fields and by grain boundaries. Our group has reported that artificial pinning centers (APC) enhance the  J  c  at the grain boundaries in the REBCO films at the liquid nitrogen temperature of 77 K. In this study, we have extended our previous work to a lower temperature since the usage of the REBCO tapes at a lower temperature and a high magnetic field is a recent development trend. Transport characteristics at grain boundaries in the REBCO films with and without APC are investigated at temperatures down to 4.2 K and at magnetic fields up to 9 T. The results show that the introduction of the APCs is effective to enhance the  J  c  at the grain boundaries at low temperatures and at the magnetic fields, especially around the matching field where the density of the APC is equal to that of vortices.",

The SrVO 3 and CaVO3 compounds are paramagnetic metals with a nominal occupation of 3d 1 (V 4+ ). The differences in the ionic radii cause a decrease in the V-O- V angle from 180 - in SrVO3 to 160 - in CaVO3. This change affect the V 3d dispersion and consequently the effective V 3d one-electron bandwidth. The LaVO3 and YVO3 materi- als are antiferromagnetic insulators with a nominal valence of 3d 2 (V 3+ ). The larger band-filling inhibits the coherent charge fluctuations and induces a metal-insulator transition. The V- O-V angle decreases from 158 - in LaVO3 to 144 - in YVO3 affecting again the one-electron bandwidth. The electronic structure of these compounds is studied here using a higher energy (1840 eV) photoemission. The mean probing depth at this energy, about 25 , is larger than in most previous studies, around 5-20 . The different features in the experimental spectra are analyzed in terms of cluster model calculations. The calculation reproduces not only the coherent and incoherent structures in the V 3d band, but also the main features in the O 2p band. The valence band photoemission results show very interesting trends across the Mott-Hubbard series. Some of the changes in the spectra are unexpected and cannot be explained by the current Mott-Hubbard theories. In addition, the same model explains the charge transfer satellites observed in the V 2p core level spectra. EXPERIMENT The SrVO3, CaVO3, LaVO3, and YVO3 samples were sin- gle crystals grown by the floating zone method. The samples presented a single phase structure as confirmed by using pow- der X-ray diffraction (XRD). The photoemission spectra were measured at room temperature at the SXS beamline in the LNLS (Brazil). The beamline has a double-crystal monochro- mator equipped with a pair of InSb(111) single crystals. The electron energy analyzer was a Perkin-Elmer and the base pressure was in the 1-2 10 ¡9 mbar range. The photon en- ergy was set to 1840 eV and the combined energy resolution was approximately 0.4 eV. The spectra were normalized to the maximum and the Fermi level was determined using a clean gold foil. The samples were repeatedly scrapped with a diamond file to remove the surface contamination. The sur- face quality of the samples was confirmed by the absence of a shoulder in the O 1s core level spectra. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The valence band spectra of SrVO3, CaVO3, LaVO3, and YVO3 are formed by the O 2p band, from 9.0 to 3.0 eV, and the V 3d band, from 3.0 to 0.0 eV. The O 2p band presents a prominent feature around 6.7 eV for SrVO3, which shifts to 6.9 eV for CaVO3, 7.0 eV for LaVO3 and 7.5 eV for YVO3. The V 3d band of metallic SrVO3 and CaVO3, presents two distinct components: the coherent structure around 0.5 eV and the incoherent feature about 1.7 eV. The coherent structure of insulating LaVO3 and YVO3 is substituted by a new fea- ture emerging about 5.1 eV. The disappearance of the coher- ent structure opens the band gap, whereas the remaining inco- herent feature shifts slightly to 1.8 eV. The absence of spuri- ous features around 8-10 eV in the spectra confirms again the quality of the surface. This description of the spectra was motivated and guided by the results of cluster model calculations. For the metallic SrVO3 and CaVO3 systems, the calculated V 3d band repro- duces both the coherent and incoherent peaks. The coherent peak is mainly given by the well-screened final state 3d 1 C configuration (with 25-30",

Here we show that Tob, a member of the emerging family of antiproliferative proteins, is a negative regulator of BMP/Smad signaling in osteoblasts. Mice carrying a targeted deletion of the tob gene have a greater bone mass resulting from increased numbers of osteoblasts. Orthotopic bone formation in response to BMP2 is elevated in tob-deficient mice. Overproduction of Tob represses BMP2-induced, Smad-mediated transcriptional activation. Finally, Tob associates with receptor-regulated Smads (Smad1, 5, and 8) and colocalizes with these Smads in the nuclear bodies upon BMP2 stimulation. The results indicate that Tob negatively regulates osteoblast proliferation and differentiation by suppressing the activity of the receptor-regulated Smad proteins.",

        "abstract": "Rupture of the fibrous cap of an atherosclerotic plaque is a key event that predisposes to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may contribute to weakening of the cap, which favors rupture. Stromelysin, a member of MMP family, is identified extensively in human coronary atherosclerotic lesions. It can degrade most of the constituents of extracellular matrix as well as activating other MMPs, which suggests that it may play an important role in plaque rupture. Recently, a common variant (5A/6A) in the promoter of the stromelysin gene has been identified. The 5A/6A polymorphism could regulate the transcription of the stromelysin gene in an allele-specific manner.To investigate the relation between the 5A/6A polymorphism in the promoter of the stromelysin gene and AMI, we conducted a case-control study of 330 AMI patients and 330 control subjects. The prevalence of the 5A/6A+5A/5A genotype was significantly more frequent in the patients with AMI than in control subjects (48.8% vs 32.7%, P<0.0001). In logistic regression models, the odds ratio of the 5A/6A+5A/5A was 2.25 (95% CI, 1.51 to 3.35). The association of 5A/6A polymorphism with AMI was statistically significant and independent of other risk factors.The 5A/6A polymorphism in the promoter of the stromelysin gene is a novel pathogenetic risk factor for AMI.",

The peak strain of I c  for the BHO-doped GdBCO CCs shifted toward the compressive strain when compared to the pure-GdBCO CC, and the strain sensitivity of I c  in the BHO-doped GdBCO CCs decreased with increasing BHO doping level. To clarify the difference between the strain sensitivity of I c  and the peak strain of I c  among the CCs, we measured the in-plane lattice parameters of GdBCO layers under tensile loading and estimated the internal lattice strain and the residual strain. As a result, the applied strain dependencies with the internal lattice strain and residual strain were almost the same, in spite of the different BHO doping level. This suggests that the change of the peak strain and the strain sensitivity were not related to the internal lattice strain.",

        "abstract": "The effect of hybrid (columnar and spherical together) artificial pinning centers (APCs) on the vortex pinning properties of YBa2Cu3O7−δ (YBCO) thin films is investigated in detail on the basis of variation of critical current density (J C ) with applied magnetic field and also with the orientation of the applied magnetic field at 65 K and 77 K. Premixed YBCO + BaSnO3 composite targets are used for the deposition of the YBCO films which consist of self-assembled BaSnO3 nanocolumns (1D APCs); on the other hand, for the deposition of the YBCO films with hybrid APCs (BaSnO3 nanocolumns together with Y2O3 nanoparticles), the surface of the premixed YBCO + BaSnO3 composite targets are modified by putting a thin Y2O3 sectored piece on the premixed YBCO + BaSnO3 composite targets by means of silver paste. F pmax value increases systematically with incorporation of 1D and 1D and 3D APCs and it also shifts towards higher applied magnetic fields. Films with 1D APCs exhibit a strong J C peak at Θ = 0° (H//c-axis) whereas films consisting of hybrid APCs exhibit enhanced J C at all the investigated angular regimes. A possible mechanism of vortex pinning in samples with hybrid APCs is also discussed suggesting the role of 1D and 3D APCs.",

        "abstract": "A c-axis oriented epitaxial REBa2Cu3Oy (RE123) thin film performs excellent superconducting properties in magnetic field. Recently, we reported that a critical current density (Jc) in the RE123 thin film was improved by a deliberate composition control. A Sm1+xBa2-xCu3Oy (Sm123) thin film with a small amount of Sm/Ba substitution x showed the great Jc∼0.17 MA/cm2 in 5 T at 77.3 K, while the Jc in (Yb1-zNdz)Ba2Cu3Oy (Yb/Nd123) thin films depended on an amount of mixed crystal ratio z. In this report, we studied Jc as a function of magnetic field and field orientation with respect to ab-planes. In low magnetic field, the Jc of Sm123 thin film was almost independent of the applied angle of the field. In the case of Yb/Nd123 thin film, extremely high Jc were observed when the magnetic field was aligned parallel or perpendicular to the surface of the film. Because compositional fluctuations in RE123 thin films were observed by transmission electron microscopy, we found that the pinning centers in RE123 thin films are strongly affected by the composition in the thin films.",

In this study, in order to control the growth of BZO nanorods in REBCO films, we fabricated the Sm1+xBa2-xCu3Oy (SmBCO) films containing BZO by conventional pulsed laser deposition (PLD-Sm+BZO) and vapor-liquid-solid technique (VLS-Sm+BZO). The self field Jcu0027s of PLD- and VLS-Sm+BZO films showed 1.3 MA/cm2 and 1.2 MA/cm2, respectively. However, magnetic field dependence of the Jc for the VLS-Sm+BZO film was twice as high as that of the PLD-Sm+BZO film at 77 K, B = 5 T. From a microstructure analysis, we found the BZO nanorods in VLS-Sm+BZO film grew nearly straight along the c-axis of the SmBCO.",

        "abstract": "For adapting to a new environment or situation, the biological systems explore the most convenient state while moving between attractors by the force of random fluctuation. From this concept, the random component in physiological signals is assumed to increase during developmental and degenerative stages of life. To examine this hypothesis, we measured the age-dependent changes in the random component of heart rate variability (HRV) in 24-h electrocardiography (ECG) big data and in patients with developmental disorder (DD).&#13; Methods. We measured separately regulated and random components of HRV with autoregressive (AR) model fitting, by which the ratio of random component as the fractional variance of AR residual time series. From the ALLSTAR database of about 304,000 ambulatory 24-h ECG, we randomly extracted data of 1930 men and 1987 women uniformly for all ages from 0 to 100 yr old (100 cases per 5-yr strata for each sex). Data were also obtained from male pediatric patients with DD (age, 10-15 yr). &#13; Results. While the variance of regulated component of HRV increased from 0 to 20 yr, decreased with age until 40 yr, and reached a plateau in both sexes, the ratio of random component was high at birth, decreased with age until 35 yr in men and 30 yr in women, and increased again after 75 yr in men and 85 yr in women (P &lt;0.0001 for all). In patients with DD, the ratio of random component was significantly lower than that in age-and-sex matched subjects in the database.&#13; Conclusion. We found that the ratio of random component of HRV is increased during developmental and degenerative stages of life and it may be reduced in DD patients during their development.&#13.",

        "abstract": "Transport measurements revealed flux pinning properties and vortex phases in SmBa2Cu3O7−δ (Sm123) superconducting films with BaHfO3 nano-rods on LaAlO3 substrates. The films have large matching fields BΦ up to 9.9 T, nano-rod diameters of ∼6 nm, and a slight Tc degradation with Tc ∼ 91.8 K by using the low temperature growth technique. According to the transport results, a small critical exponent ∼4 indicates the presence of a Bose-glass phase in the films. Double peaks of the flux pinning force density are unexpectedly observed at high temperatures over 80 K, which is accompanied by steep drops of the crossover magnetic fields between the single vortex pinning and the collective pinning states. The drops are explained by the delocalization of the vortex where the vortex is pinned by many nano-rods in the single vortex pinning state. From the viewpoint of the vortex delocalization, we conclude that BΦ should be less than 11 T for applications at liquid nitrogen temperature.",

        "abstract": "Human cDNAs encoding a novel member of Tob/BTG1 anti-proliferative family proteins were cloned. The putative protein product termed Tob2 consisted of 344 amino acids with high similarity to the Tob protein. The tob2 mRNA was 4.1 kb long and was ubiquitously expressed in human adult tissues, as was revealed by Northern blot hybridization. However, further in situ hybridization analysis showed a characteristic expression of the tob2 mRNA in oocytes, suggesting a unique role of Tob2 in oogenesis. Like the Tob protein, Tob2 inhibited cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 to S phases. Intriguingly, the amino-terminal half of Tob2 as well as that of Tob was associated with a human homologue of yeast Caf1, a component of the CCR4 transcription factor complex. Moreover, Caf1 was associated with cyclin dependent kinases. These data suggested that both Tob and Tob2 were involved in cell cycle regulation through their interaction with Caf1. Finally, the tob2 gene was mapped to human chromosome 22q13.1-q13.31.",

        "abstract": "As a physiological big-data project named ALLSTAR, we have developed a 24-hr ambulatory electrocardiogram database of 81,615 males and 103,038 females (≥20 yr) from all over Japan. With this database, we examined if regional differences in heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV) are associated with the inter-prefecture rankings of healthy life expectancy (HALE) and of average life expectancy (ALE) in Japan. According to reports by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (2013), subjects in each sex were grouped into short, middle, and long HALE and ALE tertiles by their living prefectures. Standard deviation of 24-h normal-to-normal R-R intervals (SDNN) increased progressively with increasing HALE tertiles in both sexes (Ps u003c 0.001), while it showed no consistent associations with ALE. Conversely, HR decreased progressively with increasing ALE tertiles in females (P u003c 0.001), while it showed no consistent association with HALE. These suggest HRV may reflect a biological property relating to long HALE.",

        "abstract": "Superior manual dexterity in higher primates emerged together with the appearance of cortico-motoneuronal (CM) connections during the evolution of the mammalian corticospinal (CS) system. Previously thought to be specific to higher primates, we identified transient CM connections in early postnatal mice, which are eventually eliminated by Sema6D-PlexA1 signaling. PlexA1 mutant mice maintain CM connections into adulthood and exhibit superior manual dexterity as compared with that of controls. Last, differing PlexA1 expression in layer 5 of the motor cortex, which is strong in wild-type mice but weak in humans, may be explained by FEZF2-mediated cis-regulatory elements that are found only in higher primates. Thus, species-dependent regulation of PlexA1 expression may have been crucial in the evolution of mammalian CS systems that improved fine motor control in higher primates.",

Structural analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has revealed that not only copper phosphide (Cu 3 P) but also copper phosphates of Cu 2 P 2 O 7 , Cu 3 (PO 4 ) 2  and Cu 2 PO 4  distributed mainly at the P-concentrated region of the metallic part, where Cu 3 P distributed before sintering. In addition, the ordered superstructures which have a period based on the specific lattice spacing of Cu 3 P {002} were newly discovered. From structural analysis, we estimated the mechanisms comprised of the decomposition of Cu 3 P accompanied by a lack of Cu and P, then formation of metastable phases involving structural vacancies, and eventual transition to the copper phosphates. We also discussed another manner of forming the copper phosphates by the thermo-dynamical approach. Our results may provide a way to reduce the electrical resistivity of Cu-P alloy electrodes by controlling the structures including the deoxidized Cu.",

Various genetic disorders lead to impaired spermatogenesis, defective sperm function and male infertility. Here we show that Cnot7(-/-) males are sterile owing to oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia, suggesting that Cnot7, a CCR4-associated transcriptional cofactor, is essential for spermatogenesis. Maturation of spermatids is unsynchronized and impaired in seminiferous tubules of Cnot7(-/-) mice. Transplantation of spermatogonial stem cells from male Cnot7(-/-) mice to seminiferous tubules of Kit mutant mice (Kit(W/W-v)) restores spermatogenesis, suggesting that the function of testicular somatic cells is damaged in the Cnot7(-/-) condition. The testicular phenotypes of Cnot7(-/-) mice are similar to those of mice deficient in retinoid X receptor beta (Rxrb). We further show that Cnot7 binds the AF-1 domain of Rxrb and that Rxrb malfunctions in the absence of Cnot7. Therefore, Cnot7 seems to function as a coregulator of Rxrb in testicular somatic cells and is thus involved in spermatogenesis.",

        "abstract": "In order to investigate the usefulness of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) on subsequent left ventricular (LV) function in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), regional ejection fraction (REF) was calculated from the left ventriculogram and compared in the acute and chronic phases (4 weeks after infarction) in 19 successful cases of PTCA (group A). In addition, 15 successful cases of intracoronary thrombolysis (PTCR) (group R) and 14 unsuccessful cases (group U) were also analyzed in this study. From the results, the following points were elucidated. (1) REF of group A in the chronic phase showed a significant increase compared to that in the acute phase (10 +/- 18% vs 20 +/- 19%, p less than 0.01), and this was similar to that observed in group R (9 +/- 19% vs 21 +/- 16%, p less than 0.01). (2) All cases in group A showed a significant increase in REF (p less than 0.02), if recanalization occurred within 3 hours after the onset of AMI. Some cases in the 3-6 hour recanalization group showed a decrease in REF. (3) In group A, only patients with subtotal occlusion on the initial coronary angiogram showed a significant increase in REF 4 weeks later (p less than 0.01), whereas patients with total occlusion on the initial coronary angiogram showed no significant increase in REF. (4) In group A, only patients recanalized between 3 and 6 hours showed a severe degree of prolonged contrast staining immediately after successful recanalization following PTCA. Thus, chronic phase regional wall motion was markedly improved by PTCA in those cases with residual flow. In contrast, abrupt recanalization after PTCA might causally decrease regional wall motion due to hemorrhagic infarction, if it is performed in cases with total occlusion.",

To interpret the meaning of these HR data, the reference point of HR in individual subject is required. Although resting HR has been used for this purpose, the definition of resting HR has not been established and particularly, the effects of time of the day (circadian rhythm) on resting HR have not been considered. One of the other candidates for the reference point may be basal HR, i.e., the lowest HR in the day. In the present study, we therefore investigated the characteristics of basal HR by examining the effects of age and sex on basal HR and the occurrence time of basal HR during 24 h in 113,341 males and 140,332 females extracted from a 24-h Holter ECG database of the Allostatic State Mapping by Ambulatory ECG Repository (ALLSTAR). Although basal HR decreases with age until 20 yr old in both sexes, it increases slightly with advancing age thereafter. Although the clock time to reach basal HR appears between 02 and 05 h on average, it shows progress or delay depending on the time of life. The difference between 24-h mean and basal HR decrease linearly with age, suggesting that age-dependent decline in the increases in HR with daily activities can be detected by using basal HR as the reference point.",

Overexpression of Tob2 in stromal cells repressed vitamin D(3)-induced osteoclasts formation. Furthermore, expression of RANKL mRNA in stromal cells was increased in the absence of Tob2 and decreased in the presence of Tob2. Tob2 interacted with vitamin D(3) receptor (VDR), which suggests its involvement in vitamin D(3) receptor-mediated regulation of transcription. Because VDR regulates RANKL expression, our data suggest that Tob2 negatively regulates formation of osteoclasts by suppressing RANKL expression through its interaction with VDR.",

The mean value of serum iron levels in patients with advanced colorectal cancer was significantly decreased compared with values in patients with early colorectal cancer and controls, 50.5 +/- 38.6 micrograms/dl vs 93.0 +/- 32.1 micrograms/dl and 107.1 +/- 32.9 micrograms/dl, respectively (p < 0.001). The mean value of serum ferritin levels in patients with early and advanced colorectal cancer was also significantly decreased compared with controls, 80.5 +/- 35.0 ng/ml (p < 0.01) and 48.8 +/- 72.8 ng/ml (p < 0.001), respectively, vs 117.1 +/- 46.8 ng/ml. However, there was no significant difference between mean serum iron levels in patients with early colorectal cancer and controls. Eighteen (78.3%) of the 23 patients with advanced colorectal cancer and 3 (16.7%) of the 18 patients with early colorectal cancer had serum iron levels below 85 micrograms/dl and serum ferritin levels below 60 ng/ml. Levels of both serum iron and ferritin, without clinically evident anemia, are useful indicators of advanced colorectal cancer.",

The magnitude (a few meV) and direction of the kink shift are as expected due to the measured isotopic shift of phonon frequency, and are also in agreement with theoretical expectations. This demonstrates the participation of the phonons as dominant players, as well as pinpointing the most relevant of the phonon branches.",

The Mössbauer spectra of 57Fe in Si are well fitted with a curve consisting of two singlet lines, one being assigned as the interstitial Fe atoms and the other as substitutional ones. The relative intensities of the two lines infer that 60% of 57Fe ( ←57Mn) atoms land at the interstitial sites and 40% at the substitutional sites at temperatures between 30 K and 296 K. The result for the KMnO4 sample suggests a presence of an exotic chemical species corresponding to a higher valence state than Fe6 +.",

In healthy subjects, ECG was recorded continuously during watching movies, during which they pressed a button according to the type of emotion. Power concentration of high-frequency (HF, 0.15–0.45 Hz) component (Hsi) that reflects regularity of respiration, the standard deviation of the amplitude of HF component, and the amplitude of low-frequency (LF, 0.04–0.15 Hz) were extracted as the useful discriminator for the type of emotion. Canonical discriminant model with these variables revealed that periods with joy, worry, sorrow, surprise, and aversion are expanded separately on a plane consisting of two canonical variables reflecting the levels of valence and arousal, respectively.",

        "abstract": "There have been only a few endoscopic studies with respect to lower intestinal lesions of leukaemia and malignant lymphoma, although there have been many autopsy studies of these lesions. The aim of this study was to clarify these lesions using endoscopy. Colonoscopy was performed on 11 of 341 patients with leukaemia and on 32 of 105 patients with malignant lymphoma for frequent diarrhoea, anal bleeding or abnormal findings on barium enema examination, between April 1984 and September 1994. In eight of the 11 patients with leukaemia on whom endoscopy was performed, nine lesions were found; aphthoid ulcers, small ulcers or large tumours due to leukaemic infiltration were found in five, and colorectal adenoma was found in only one patient. Antibiotic-associated haemorrhagic colitis or pseudomembranous colitis was found in one patient each. In 10 of the 32 patients with malignant lymphoma, 11 lesions were found. The following were found in one patient each: large lymphomatous tumours, a large lymphomatous ulcer, multiple small polypoid lesions, multiple lymphomatous polyposis; and colorectal cancer or adenoma in six patients. However, the autopsy findings in patients with both diseases were mostly pseudomembrane formation or ulcers due to fungal and/or bacterial infection. It is concluded that accurate endoscopic diagnosis of lower intestinal lesions in patients with leukaemia or malignant lymphoma is essential for staging and treatment of these diseases and for determining their prognosis. Most lesions in leukaemia are aphthoid and small ulcers are due to leukaemic infiltration or antibiotics; most lesions in malignant lymphoma are elevated lesions such as cancer, adenoma or lymphomatous lesions as determined by endoscopy. This is in contrast to pseudomembrane formation or ulcers due to fungal and/or bacterial infection which are detected at autopsy.",

        "abstract": "Although chewing gum improves cognitive functions including attention, memory, alertness, and executive functions, recent studies reported that chewing gum during a cognitive task can differently affect the components of cognitive functions. We examined the effects of taste-and-flavor-free chewing gum on behavioral alertness assessed by psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) in 13 healthy adults. They performed 5-min PVT for three times; before, during the last 5 min of 8-min gum chewing, and 3 min after ceasing it. Sustained attention evaluated as the number of lapses (>1000 ms) improved both during and after chewing gum (P = 0.01). Although marginally significant shortening of overall reaction time to stimuli (RT) was observed both during and after chewing gum (P = 0.05), the fastest 10th percentile RT (RT without the influence of lapses) lengthened only during chewing gum. Our observations suggest that chewing gum may improve sustained attention but elongate reaction time.",

Yoshida, Y. Ito, I. Hirabayashi, H. Nagai, Y. Takai, Appl. Phys. Lett. 69 (1996) 845; Y. Ito, Y. Yoshida, Y. Mizushima, I. Hirabayashi, H. Nagai, Y. Takai, Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 35 (1996) L825.]. In this paper, we describe the CVD process for the ultra-flat YBCO films block-by-block deposition using liquid sources. The high stability and good controllability of the sources enable us to study the early stage of epitaxial growth by depositing c -axis-oriented films with different number of sequence and different kind of substrates. Investigating the films deposited at 800°C, we confirmed that the initial growth of YBCO films on MgO is multinuclear growth, and in the early stage ( t ≤200 Å), spiral growth appears, whereas that on SrTiO 3 is two-dimensional growth and spiral growth appears after coalescence of initially grown crystallites having a flat-faceted surface.",

This method makes it possible to inject a large volume of deproteinized plasma and obtain resolution of drug enantiomers with high sensitivity. The optimum mobile phase, including a non-volatile buffer such as phosphate buffer, for separation of drugs from a large amount of endogenous compounds can be used, because of inclusion of a trapping column with a desalting function. This method is very simple and rapid, and should be very powerful in studies requiring high-sensitivity analysis with chiral separation of drugs from biological samples such as plasma.",

Felodipine (0.3-10 micrograms/kg, i.v.) and nicardipine (0.3-10 micrograms/kg, i.v.) produced a dose-related decrease in mean blood pressure with almost equal potencies. However, at a dose of 3 micrograms/kg, felodipine produced a more prominent increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) than nicardipine. Decreases in cerebral vascular resistance were significantly greater in the felodipine group at doses of 0.3 and 3 micrograms/kg, when compared with the nicardipine group. Cerebral oxygen consumption calculated by multiplying the arterio-venous difference of oxygen content by CBF was increased by these two drugs, but the changes were minimal. These data suggest that the increase in CBF produced by felodipine and nicardipine was primarily due to the direct dilatation of the cerebral blood vessels.",

In addition to substitutional Fe s  0  and interstitial Fe i  0  components, the Mossbauer spectrum of mc-Si contains a new component assigned to “Fe i -defect associations”. All three components appear to distribute inhomogeneously, and to correlate with the defect distributions. These results are clearly different from that of the single crystalline Si wafer.",

A mapping image of a silicon solar cell is shown as an\n example obtained by the latter system.

PACS 74.72.Dn 74.72.Jt Keywords BaZrO 3 CaZrO 3 SrZrO 3 BaWO 4 SrWO 4 CaWO 4 Artificial pinning center Er123 1 Introduction Enhancement in J c is essential for the application of REBa 2 Cu 3 O y (RE123) superconductors to high magnetic field engineering and to high-current carrying wires. Introduction of artificial pinning centers (APC) into the RE123 superconducting matrix is very effective for the improvement of the critical current density. Significant improvement in the critical current density was reported for the melt-textured RE123 with fine particles of normal phases such as RE211 in the matrix [1,2] , and for REBCO thin films with columnar defects induced by ion irradiation [3,4] . Besides RE211 materials, several APC materials such as BaZrO 3 [5,6] , ZrO 2 [7] , Y 2 Ba 4 CuMO y [8] have been studied. It has been reported recently that the introduction of nanometre sized RE211 and BaZrO 3 particles into Y123 thin films results in the enhancement of J c in high magnetic fields [9,10] . The result suggests that further improvement of J c is also possible for the RE123 films, which are at least one or two order of magnitude higher than that in single crystals and melt-textured bulk, by introducing fine normal phases. We have investigated suitable materials for the APC in order to fabricate RE123 thin films with APC by a pulsed-laser ablation technique using RE123 targets with APC materials. It is necessary for APC materials to be chemically stable in the RE123 matrix phase. The present study describes the reactivity of AZrO 3 (A = Ba, Sr and Ca, AZO) and AWO 4 (A = Ba, Sr and Ca, AWO) with Er123, and the influence of their addition on the superconducting properties with a view to exploit the new APC materials for high J c thin films. 2 Experimental Er123 samples were prepared from Er 2 O 3 (99.9%), BaCO 3 (99.95%), and CuO (99.99%) using a standard solid-phase reaction technique. Appropriate amounts of the reagents were thoroughly ground and calcined at 1173 K for two periods of 12 h in air, with intermediate regrinding. The resultant powder was pressed into pellets and then sintered at 1233 K in air for two periods of 12 h, with intermediate regrinding. High purity commercial AZO and AWO powders were then added to the Er123 powders in concentrations of 0.5–4.0 wt.%. The AZO and AWO mixed Er123 powders were thoroughly ground, pressed into pellets and then sintered at 1233 K in air for 12 h. All samples were subsequently annealed in flowing oxygen at 1183 K for 12 h, cooled to 773 K with a 12 h stay, and then cooled to room temperature in a furnace. The electrical resistivity of the samples was measured by a standard four-probe technique to determine the T c values. X-ray diffractometry (XRD) was employed to identify the phases present in the samples. The surface of the samples was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The chemical composition of the samples was examined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns for the AZO-added Er123 samples. BaZrO 3 (BZO) has a cubic structure with a lattice constant of 0.4192 nm. CaZrO 3 (CZO) and SrZrO 3 (SZO) have orthorhombic structure with lattice constants of a = 0.5587, b = 0.8008, c =0.5578, and a =0.5792, b = 0.5189, c = 0.5818, respectively. No diffraction peaks except BZO and Er123 was observed for the BZO-added samples. This result indicates that BZO was stable in the Er123 matrix. The SZO- and CZO-added Er123 samples also show diffraction peaks of BZO and Er123. Diffraction peaks of SZO and CZO were not observed for the SZO- and CZO-added Er123 samples. This probably indicates that BZO was formed by the reaction between AZO (A = Sr, Ca) and Er123. These results indicate that BZO was most stable in the Er123 matrix among the AZO materials. Fig. 2 shows the onset temperature of superconducting transition T c (onset) and the zero-resistivity temperature T c (zero) of the AZO-added Er123 samples as a function of the amount of AZO addition. Compared with the T c (zero) value of the additive-free samples, the T c (zero) values of the BZO- and SZO-added samples showed no decrease up to 0.5 wt.% addition, decreasing by 1 and 3 K at the additional amount of 1.0 wt.%, respectively. The T c (zero) values of the CZO-added samples decreased by 4 K at 0.5 wt.%. However, T c (onset) was constant for all the added samples, although the T c (zero) of the added samples decreased with AZO addition. The constant T c (onset) indicates that no substitution of Zr for Cu in Er123 was occurred by the addition. The degradation of T c (zero) seems to be attributed to that the superconducting coupling between the Er123 grains was weaken by the AZO particles and the products formed by the decomposition of AZO. Fig. 3 shows the results of the EDX mapping analysis for the Er123 samples with 2.0 wt.% AZO addition along with SEM images. The grain size of the BZO-added sample was smaller than that of the additive-free sample ( Fig. 3 (a)). This is probably due to that the grain growth of Er123 was inhibited by the addition of BZO. Uniformly distributed fine particles with an average grain size of about 0.5 μm were observed for the BZO-added sample surface besides Er123 grains ( Fig. 3 (c), (e) and (g)). The fine particles probably correspond to BZO, since the size of the fine particles agree with that of the initial BZO powder ( Fig. 3 (b)). This result also indicates that BZO was stable in the Er123 matrix. The Zr concentration mapping for the BZO-added sample shows a uniform distribution of Zr. On the other hand, the SZO- and CZO-added samples showed segregation of Zr besides the fine particles ( Fig. 3 (d), (f) and (h)). We also investigated on AWO 4 (A = Ba, Sr and Ca) as a candidate for APC materials. Fig. 4 shows the onset temperature of superconducting transition T c (onset) and the zero-resistivity temperature T c (zero) of the AWO-added Er123 samples as a function of the amount of AWO addition. Compared with the T c (zero) value of the additive-free samples, the T c (zero) values of the BaWO 4 (BWO)- and SrWO 4 (SWO)-added samples remained unchanged up to 1.0 wt.% addition, decreasing by 1 and 3 K at the additional amount of 2.0 wt.%, respectively. The T c (zero) values of the CaWO 4 (CWO)-added samples decreased by 3 K at 1.0 wt.%. These results indicate that BWO was most stable in the Er123 matrix among the AWO materials. Fig. 5 shows the result of the EDX mapping analysis for the Er123 samples with 2.0 wt.% BWO addition along with SEM images. The surface of the BWO-added sample shows agglomerated fine particles with a diameter of about 0.5 μm. The fine particles correspond to the initial mixed BWO particles from the W concentration mapping for the sample. These results indicate that BWO can be a candidate for the APC materials into Er123. 4 Conclusions The stability of AZO and AWO in the Er123 matrix phase, and the superconducting properties of the added Er123 samples was investigated. It was found that BZO and BWO were most stable in the Er123 matrix among AZO and AWO materials. No degradation of T c (zero) was observed for the Er123 samples with BZO and SZO addition up to 0.5 wt.%, and with BWO and SWO addition up to 1.0 wt.%. On the other hand, T c (onset) was constant for all the added samples. The BZO-added samples showed uniform distribution of BZO fine particles. BZO and BWO were found to be useful materials for APC into Er123. Acknowledgements We thank to Mr. K. Naito of TEP Corporation for fabricating BaZrO 3 materials. References [1] S. Nariki M. Matsui N.

        "abstract": "The intracellular cation contents were determined in isolated perfused rat heart using cobaltic EDTA as a marker of the extracellular space. In hearts in which Na+ accumulation was induced with monensin, a Na+ ionophore, during 20 min-ischemia which otherwise did not result in accumulation of Na+, the levels of Na+ and Ca2+ were significantly higher after reperfusion with a significant decrease in K+. While the recovery of the cardiac mechanical function (CMF) was complete after reperfusion in control hearts, the recovery was incomplete in monensin-hearts. Dichlorobenzamil (DCB), the most specific inhibitor of Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger, infused for 10 min before induction of ischemia in a dose of 10(-5) M, which produced a definite suppression of CMF (over 80%), inhibited the accumulation of Ca2+ and Na+ and the loss of K+ and ATP after 40 min-ischemia and reperfusion. The same dose of DCB given for 3 min before induction of ischemia and after reperfusion, which produced a less than 20% inhibition of CMF, failed to prevent the Ca2+ accumulation after 40 min-ischemia and reperfusion. These findings are at variance with the idea that the accumulation of Na+ during ischemia and the consequent augmented operation of Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange is responsible for accumulation of Ca2+ after reperfusion.",

        "abstract": "BaSnO 3 (BSO) nanocolumns and Y  2 BaCuO 5  (Y211) nanoparticles have been successfully incorporated into YBCO thin films by premixed and surface-modified target approach. The effect of these artificially incorporated nanostructures on the vortex pinning properties of YBCO films is investigated based on the variation of critical current density (J C ) with applied magnetic field and its variation with respect to the orientation of the applied magnetic field at two different temperatures: 77 and 65 K. The incorporation of Y211 nanoparticles into both YBCO and YBCO + BSO2% films results in improved J C -H characteristics, which is reflected in the enhanced pinning force density (F p ) values. The angular dependent J C  measurement reveals that the YBCO film containing BSO nanocolumns exhibits J C  peak along the c-axis, whereas the film containing Y211 nanoparticles exhibits isotropic enhancement in the J C  values along the entire investigated angular regime. The YBCO film consisting of both kinds of nanostructures (BSO nanocolumns together with Y211 nanoparticles), on the other hand, exhibits mixed characteristics of different kinds of pinning: strong c-axis J C  peak together with isotropically enhanced J C  in the intermediate angular regime. A possible vortex pinning mechanism due to different kinds of artificially incorporated nanostructures is also discussed.",

Particular attention has been given to the novel synthesis of the optically active spiro carbon center by a stereospecific rearrangement of optically active benzofuzed-trans-epoxy acylates leading to spirocyclopentane-1,1'-indane systems. This method is quite useful for the construction of an optically active spiro compound and was applied to the synthesis of the optically pure CDEF-ring unit of 1. Cycloaddition of the optically pure CDEF-ring unit to AB-ring units prepared via benzyne afforded two natural and unnatural-type hexacyclic compounds, which were converted to natural and unnatural enantiomers of synthetic 1, and the absolute configuration of natural 1 was determined as S.",

The corresponding minimum J c value of the films at 40 K under an applied 3 T field was 5.2 MA cm−2, which is over ten times higher than that of a fully optimized Nb–Ti wire at 4.2 K. At 4.2 K, under a 17.5 T field, a flux pinning force density of 1.4 TN m−3 for B//c was realized; this value is among the highest values reported for REBCO films to date. More importantly, the F p for B//c corresponds to the minimum value for various applied magnetic field directions. We investigated the dominant flux pinning centers of films at 4.2 K using the anisotropic scaling approach based on the effective mass model. The dominant flux pinning centers are random pinning centers at 4.2 K, i.e., a high pinning performance was achieved by the high number density of random pins in the matrix of the BHO-doped SmBCO films.",

        "abstract": "We have developed SmBa 2 Cu 3 O y (SmBCO) superconducting films with BaHfO 3 (BHO) inclusions on singlecrystalline substrates via a pulsed laser deposition method. We have controlled the morphology of the BHO nanorods within the SmBCO matrix by varying growth temperature during the depositions. In this paper, we fabricated 1.5 vol.% BHO-doped SmBCO films on metallic substrates  750 °C [low-temperature growth (LTG) film] and 840 °C [high-temperature growth (HTG) film]. The LTG film showed lower flux pinning performance  a relatively high measurement temperature ranging from 65 K to 77 K than the HTG film. However,  a low measurement temperature of 20 K under high magnetic fields, the LTG film exhibited higher flux pinning performance in comparison with the HTG film. The maximum flux pinning force density was more than 520 GN/m 3 at 20 K under 9 T. Even on the metallic substrates, LTG is also helpful in achieving an improved flux pinning performance of SmBCO films  low measurement temperatures under high magnetic fields.",

        "abstract": "Using a polymerase chain reaction-mediated cloning procedure, we have identified a novel member, termed ANA (from Abundant in Neuroepithelium Area), of Tob/BTG1 family of antiproliferative genes. Molecular cloning and analysis of cDNAs revealed that the human and mouse ANA encoded a protein of 252 amino acids. The amino-terminal half of ANA was homologous to the previously characterized antiproliferative gene products, BTG1, PC3/TIS21/BTG2, and Tob. The human ANA gene was localized at chromosome 21q11.2-q21.1. ANA was expressed in a variety of tissues and cell lines, its expression being high in the ovary, testis, prostate, thymus, and lung. Further analysis revealed that ANA expression was high in the ventricular zone of the developing central nervous system. Finally, overexpression of ANA impaired serum-induced cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 to S phase. In conclusion, ANA is a fourth member of the Tob/BTG1 family that might play roles in neurogenesis in the central nervous system.",

Comparing with the spectrum of p-type multi-crystalline-Si, the broad spectra of the solar cell under operation can be analyzed as a superposition of interstitial and substitutional Fe components with different charge states. The charge states of Fe impurities are created by the excess carrier injection followed by a directional carrier flow in the p-n junction. The present results provide us a possibility to clarify the carrier trapping process at the Fe impurities in Si-solar cells.",

        "abstract": "G(0) (215-250 kD) and G(1) (120-140 kD), the unidentified major phosphoproteins in the cGMP-mediated protein phosphorylation system of vascular smooth muscle membranes, were compared for biochemical and immunological properties with the type 1 inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R, 240 kD) and the myosin-binding subunit (MBS, 138 kD) of myosin phosphatase, both of them substrates for cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Two microsomal proteins that were immunoreactive with antibodies to InsP(3)R and MBS were detected, and comigrated with G(0) and G(1), respectively, on SDS-PAGE. When thiophosphorylated G(0) and G(1) were subjected to immunoprecipitation, MBS antibody induced the precipitation of a 138-kD phosphoprotein, but did not significantly affect the amount of G(1) remaining in the supernatant, while InsP(3)R antibody precipitated G(0) almost completely. Unexpectedly, InsP(3)R antibody coprecipitated a large portion of G(1), which did not cross-react with either antibody to MBS or InsP(3)R. Just like InsP(3)R, G(0) bound to the calmodulin column in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, and, again, a large portion of G(1) was copurified with G(0). These results suggest that G(0) is identical to InsP(3)R, while G(1) consists of several phosphoproteins, including the 138-kD protein associated with InsP(3)R as a major component. MBS is not G(1) or may represent only a minor component of it.",

        "title": "Superconducting properties of ErBCO films with BaMO3 nanorods (M=Zr and Sn) by pulsed laser deposition",
        "abstract": "Ba complex oxides such as BaMO 3 (BMO, M = Zr and Sn) were incorporated into ErBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (ErBCO) films on SrTiO 3 (STO) substrates for realizing higher critical current densities ( J c ) in magnetic fields. Nanorods of BMO were formed in the ErBCO films with the rod diameter of about 10–20 nm. Crystal grain alignment of both ErBCO films with BZO and BSO were found to be worse with increasing the doping concentration of BMO into the films, resulting in critical temperature ( T c ) degradation for the ErBCO films. J c of the ErBCO films were enhanced by the corporation of these BMO nanorods in the magnetic fields ( B ) applied particularly parallel to the c -axis ( B // c ). Additionally, it was observed that the J c values of the ErBCO films with BSO were higher than those of ErBCO films with BZO in the all measured magnetic fields ( B // c ), which indicated that the BSO nanorods acted as more effective pinning centers in ErBCO films. Extremely high J c of 0.41 MA/cm 2 was performed for the ErBCO film with BSO of 4.9 mol% in the magnetic field ( B // c ) of 3 T. We concluded that not only the decision of pinning materials, but also optimization of the three factors of crystallinity of the superconducting film, T c of the superconducting film, and doping concentration of the pinning materials into the superconducting film were important to realize higher J c in a magnetic field. PACS 74.62.Dh 74.78.Bz Keywords ErBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ films Artificial pinning center BaZrO 3 BaSnO 3 Nanorods Critical current density Transmission electron microscopy 1 Introduction REBa 2 Cu 3 O 7-δ (REBCO, RE: rare earth elements) superconductors have been expected to use in many electric power applications since they have high critical current densities ( J c ) at a liquid nitrogen temperature (77.3 K) under self-field. However, J c of REBCO at 77.3 K is relatively lower than that of metal-system superconductors such as Nb 3 Sn at 4.2 K in magnetic fields. In order to apply REBCO for electric power applications, J c should be enhanced in a magnetic field ( B ) applied particularly parallel to the c -axis ( B // c ) [1,2] . Recently, researches of J c enhancement for REBCO films have been proceeded by introducing artificial pinning centers (APCs) into the films [3–8] . It has been studied that J c properties in magnetic fields were well improved for REBCO films with APC such as BaZrO 3 (BZO). High BZO concentration in REBCO films is suggested to be acted as strong pinning centers [9–12] . On the other hand, it has been reported that high concentration of BZO into the film causes a degradation of critical temperature ( T c ) of the REBCO film. Then, it is important to introduce large concentration of APC to REBCO films with maintaining T c value for realizing high J c properties in magnetic fields [13–16] . Recently, the pinning properties for YBCO film with BaSnO 3 (BSO) as an APC has been reported. In this report, high J c was obtained by introducing nanoparticles of BSO into the YBCO film [17] . However, influences of BSO incorporation into YBCO films on T c property are not discussed enough in this report. In this paper, we grow ErBCO films with BMO (M = Zr and Sn) incorporations and report the effects on the crystal grains alignment, superconducting properties such as T c and J c and microstructures of the films. ErBCO is one of the REBCO superconductors, which shows a higher T c of about 93 K than that of YBCO in the bulk [18] . The c -axis correlated defects with nanorods of each BZO and BSO were incorporated to the ErBCO film, the J c properties especially in the field ( B // c ) were discussed. 2 Experimental Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) using an ArF excimer laser ( λ = 193 nm) was applied to grow ErBCO films. Each high-density sintered ErBCO ceramics with BZO and BSO of 0–20 mol% were used as the targets for growing ErBCO films with various BZO and BSO-contents. In the previous report, as concerning YBCO film with BSO-doping, Varanasi et al. used a target which consists of two parts; one is YBCO and the other is BSO in a shape of sector for the YBCO with BSO nanoparticles. On the other hand, BSO dispersed ErBCO targets were applied to incorporate the c -axis correlated defects into the ErBCO film in this report. (1 0 0)-Oriented SrTiO 3 substrates were utilized for the ErBCO deposition. All ErBCO films were deposited for 60 min under a pulse frequency of 1 Hz and a substrate temperature of 740 °C which was monitored by an optical pyrometer. During deposition, oxygen pressure was fixed at 400 mTorr with a gas flow rate of 200 cm 3 /min. After deposition, the films were cooled down rapidly to room temperature in an atmospheric oxygen pressure. The preferred orientation, crystal grain alignment of out of plane and in-plane for the grown ErBCO films were analyzed by an X-ray θ –2 θ diffraction (XRD θ − 2 θ ), a ω -scan (XRD ω -scan) using the 0 0 5 peak of the ErBCO and a φ -scan (XRD φ -scan) using the (1 0 2) plane of ErBCO, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation was performed to investigate microstructures and lattice images of the films. A resistivity ( ρ )-temperature ( T ) curves were measured to obtain critical temperature ( T c ) by a conventional four-probe method. The J c values of the ErBCO films were also evaluated by a four-probe measurement. 3 Results and discussion Effects of BMO incorporation into the ErBCO film on crystal grain alignments of the ErBCO films were investigated. Fig. 1 shows an X-ray θ − 2 θ diffraction pattern of ErBCO film with BSO 4.8 mol% doping. The 0 0 l peaks of ErBCO and no impurity phases were observed, indicating that the grown ErBCO film is c -axis oriented. Additionally, a peak corresponded to BaSnO 3 2 0 0 was observed near 2 θ of 43.90° as seen in Fig. 1 . The diffraction peaks come from other orientation for BaSnO 3 were not observed in Fig. 1 . These results suggested that BaSnO 3 in the ErBCO target was inserted in the ErBCO films as the crystal structure of BaSnO 3 . The BMO intensity ratios in the ErBCO films grown by using the various BMO-concentration target were shown in Fig. 2 . The BMO intensity ratio was calculated by the peak intensities of BMO002 and ErBCO005 using the following equation: BMO ratio = BMO002 BMO002 + ErBCO005 × 100 ( % ) It was suggested that the volume ratio of both BZO and BSO increased with increasing the BMO concentration in the target. This result shows that the BMO grows with maintaining an orientation of BMO 2 0 0 in the ErBCO films. Fig. 3 shows the dependences of out of plane crystal grain alignments (Δ ω ) for the ErBCO films on the BMO-concentration in the targets. In the both ErBCO films with BZO and BSO, Δ ω values increased with increasing the BMO-concentration in the target, it’s indicating that the c -axis crystal grain alignments of ErBCO films were getting worse with increasing the concentration of BMO doping into ErBCO films. The lattice mismatches are calculated to be about 9.5% between BZO and ErBCO ( a -axis) and about 7.8% between BSO and ErBCO ( a -axis), respectively. Also, the lattice mismatches between BZO and ErBCO( c -axis) and between BSO and ErBCO ( c -axis) are calculated to be about 7.5% and 5.8%, respectively. Consequently, we consider that one of the reasons of the lower crystal grain alignment of the ErBCO with BZO-incorporation than that with BSO-incorporation is the difference of lattice matching between ErBCO and doping materials.Influence of BMO incorporation on the lattice parameter was investigated. Fig. 4 shows BMO-concentration dependences of c -axis length of the grown ErBCO films with BMO-incorporation. The values of c -axis length were calculated by the Nelson–Riley function using the results of XRD θ − 2θ diffractions for each ErBCO film with BZO and BSO [19] . In the both ErBCO films with BZO and BSO, c -axis length increased with increasing the BMO-concentration in the target, indicating that lattice of ErBCO crystal was also strained by the BMO incorporation in to the ErBCO film. Longer c -axis length was observed for ErBCO films with BZO than those with BSO. The reason for the increases of c -axis length may possibly be M-element diffusion in to the ErBCO matrix which results in M substitutions between copper. The atomic radius of Zr is larger than that of Sn, and then the structure is largely distorted by Zr substitution. From these results of XRD analysis, it can be concluded that not only the crystal grains alignment of the ErBCO film, but also lattice of ErBCO were distorted by the incorporation of BMO into the ErBCO films. Then, the influence of mentioned above crystal structure distortions by the incorporation of BMO into the ErBCO films on the superconducting properties of ErBCO film were studied. Fig. 5 shows the T c s of the ErBCO films as a function of the nominal concentration of BZO and BSO in the targets. As seen in Fig. 6 , T c s of the both ErBCO films with BZO and BSO were found to be reduced with increasing the BMO-concentration in the film. Particularly, T c s in the ErBCO films with BZO were decreased drastically with only small addition of BZO to the ErBCO film. On the other hand, higher T c values were maintained for the ErBCO films with BSO than those with BZO. High T c value of 90 K was maintained in ErBCO film with 4.8 mol% BSO. As mentioned above, the larger T c degradation of the ErBCO films with BZO is likely due to larger strain in the ErBCO film than the ErBCO film with BSO as seen in Figs. 3 and 4 . J c properties in the magnetic fields were then investigated for the ErBCO films with similar BMO concentration of BSO and BZO. Fig. 6 shows the magnetic field dependences of J c for the ErBCO film with BSO of 4.8 mol%, ErBCO film with BZO 4.1 mol% and pure ErBCO at 77.3 K in the magnetic field applied parallel to the c -axis ( B // c ). J c values for the ErBCO film with BSO of 4.8 mol%, ErBCO film with BZO 4.1 mol% and pure ErBCO at 77.3 K in self-field were 1.3, 0.54 and 1.0 MA/cm 2 , respectively. As seen in Fig. 6 , higher J c values were obtained for the ErBCO films with BSO and BZO than that for pure ErBCO film particularly at high-magnetic fields, indicating that these incorporated BMO acted as effective pinning centers in ErBCO films. Additionally, the ErBCO films with BSO showed higher J c values than ErBCO films with BZO. Large enhancements of J c were observed for the ErBCO film with BSO of 4.8 mol% in all magnetic fields. As a result, extremely high J c value of 0.41 MA/cm 2 was obtained in a magnetic field of 3 T ( B // c ), indicating the strong correlated pinning along the c -axis. In order to discuss origins of the J c enhancements in a magnetic field applied parallel to the c -axis as seen in Fig. 6 , microstructures of the both ErBCO films with BSO and BZO were observed by TEM. Fig. 7 a and b show the cross-sectional bright-field images for the ErBCO film with BSO of 4.8 mol% and ErBCO film with BZO of 4.1 mol%, respectively. As seen in Fig. 7 , columnar defects were comprised of nanorods along the c -axis of the both ErBCO films. Nanorods of these BMO were formed with the rod diameter of about 10–20 nm. It can be understood that these nanorods played as the effective c -axis correlated pinning centers for the J c enhancements as seen in Fig. 6 . On the other hand, it can be seen that there are differences of the number density of the nanorods in ErBCO film with BSO and with BZO. Both films were thinned to be about 100 nm in thick for the TEM observation. Therefore, it is suggested that the number density of the BSO nanorods is larger than that of BZO nanorods, resulting in the stronger pinning force and higher J c performance in the magnetic fields as seen in Fig. 6 . A similar result that a difference of number density of nanorods results in a difference of the pinning force has been reported in the YBCO-BZO films [12] . However, this significant difference in number density of nanorods as suggested in Fig. 7 a and b should be analyzed in detail, for example by the observation of larger area and/or plane view observation for the both film, which are under developing now. In addition, fringe patterns appeared in the nanorods in both Fig. 7 a and b. These fringe patterns were caused by the interaction between the ErBCO and the nanorod crystal. Studies of the structures for nanorods in the ErBCO film will be reported separately [20] . 4 Conclusions We grew ErBCO films with BMO (M = Zr and Sn) incorporations and the effects on the crystal grains alignment, superconducting properties such as T c and J c and microstructures of the films were discussed. From the results of XRD analysis, it can be concluded that lattice of ErBCO was distorted by the incorporation of BMO into the ErBCO films in addition to the crystal grains alignment of the ErBCO film. T c s of the both ErBCO films with BZO and BSO were found to be reduced with increasing the BMO-concentration in the film. Particularly, T c s in the ErBCO films with BZO were decreased drastically with only small addition of BZO to the ErBCO film. High T c value of 90 K was maintained in ErBCO film with 4.8 mol% BSO. As a result, extremely high J c value of 0.41 MA/cm 2 was obtained for the ErBCO film with 4.8 mol% BSO in a magnetic field of 3 T ( B // c ), indicating the strong correlated pinning along the c -axis. From the cross-sectional TEM observation, it was suggested that the number density of the BSO nanorods was larger than that of BZO nanorods. We concluded that not only the decision of pinning materials, but also optimization of the three factors of crystallinity of the superconducting film, critical temperature ( T c ) of the superconducting film, and doping concentration of the pinning materials into the superconducting film were important to realize higher J c in a magnetic field.

        "abstract": "The irreversibility temperatures were measured for a-axis oriented and c-axis in-plane aligned Y123/Pr123 multilayer films in various magnetic fields. Pr123 layers act as two-dimensional (planer) c-axis correlated artificial pinning centers (APCs) in the multilayer films. In the irreversibility field-temperature (B irr - T) curves, the crossover was observed near matching field B phi for the multilayer films, when the magnetic fields were applied parallel to the c -axis of the film (B//c). It is suggested the vortex state in Y123 films with two-dimensional APCs is Bose glass below the crossover field. The B irr - T curves under B // a shifted toward lower temperature and magnetic field regions.",

It was observed that the { n 00} texturing of the Y 2 O 3 layer became predominant at 650–680°C. The YBCO film on that layer was c -axis oriented and showed good in-plane alignment. From TEM images, we confirmed that the YBCO film grew on top of the MgO substrate, even if the Y 2 O 3 buffer layer was fabricated before the YBCO deposition. Furthermore, the YBCO film did not involve grain boundaries. It was considered that the Y 2 O 3 was incorporated into YBCO film during deposition and the lattice mismatch between YBCO and MgO was improved by depositing the Y 2 O 3 buffer layer. The T c(zero) of YBCO film was found to be 90 K.",

As seen in endochondral bone formation, skeletogenesis is closely related to angiogenesis during development. PlexinD1 is a member of plexin family, is expressed in central nervous system and endothelium, and plays a role in blood vessel patterning and endothelium positioning during embryonic development. Here, we examined the effects of PlexinD1 deficiency on skeletogenesis. Three-dimensional micro CT examination revealed that PlexinD1 deficiency resulted in axial skeletal patterning defects including malformation in vertebral body and rib bone shape. Histological examination of the vertebral bodies and long bones showed that PlexinD1 deficiency altered the development of cartilage. PlexinD1 deficiency did not affect the levels of von Willebrand factor staining in relatively large vessels not attached but close to the vertebral body of mice. However, PlexinD1 deficiency reduced the von Willebrand factor (vWf) staining in most of the microvasculatures attached to the vertebral bone. PlexinD1 was expressed in osteoblastic cells and bone tissues of newborn and adult mice. As most of the homozygous knockout mice did not survive, we examined the role of PlexinD1 in bone formation in heterozygous adult mice subjected to bone marrow ablation.

At a spacing of 5,871 nm, ten nanodot (ND) arrays were formed at intervals of 533 nm by nanosecond pulsed laser. The results show that the formation of the PNSA was affected by the resonance of scattered light. We conclude that ND arrays were formed with a spacing of Λ = nλ. And we have designed PNSA comprising two ND arrays on the substrate. The PNSA with dimensions of 1,600 nm × 1,600 nm was prepared using GLs.",

By improving the reactor shape and gas flow of the source materials, we succeeded in fabricating the double-sided YBCO films and the YBCO-coated conductor on oxide fiber. The YBCO films on both sides of the LaAlO 3 (100) substrate showed almost the same superconducting properties. The films deposited on the facet of the single crystalline SrTiO 3 fiber showed the biaxial alignment in the ab -plane, that is suitable as a seed crystalline layer for successive liquid phase epitaxial (LPE) growth.",

        "abstract": "Nocturnal heart rate variability (HRV) is thought to reflect healthy recovery function of the autonomic nervous system. Although exercise is recommended for health promotion, exercise itself decreases HRV. We studied acute effect of daytime exercise on nocturnal HRV in 5 healthy adults (age, 22-40 years; 2 female subjects) without regular exercise habit. Using a treadmill, they performed 30-min walking at 4 km/hr and 30-min running at 9 km/hr from 11 a.m. on different days at an interval of 2 weeks. On these days and a day without exercise (control), Holter electrocardiograms were recorded from 9 a.m. for 24 hr. The amplitudes of low-frequency (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF, 0.15-0.45 Hz) components of HRV were measured continuously by complex demodulation and were averaged over periods of 11:00-11:30 a.m., 3 hr after going to bed, and time in bed at night. Exercise intensities of the walking and running were at 10% to 44% and 55% to 67% of heart rate reserve, respectively. During exercise, heart rate increased and LF and HF amplitudes decreased with exercise intensity. Nocturnal heart rate and LF and HF amplitude, however, showed no consistent changes with exercise intensity and their averages on the days of walking and running did not differ significantly from those of the control day. In conclusion, 30-min walking and running exercises performed in the morning had no significant acute effects on nocturnal heart rate or HRV.",

We examined if heart rate variability (HRV) particularly those related to sleep apnea can be a maker of depression after AMI. According to the prognosis of depression, 707 post-AMI patients were divided into 349 never, 138 remitting, 25 newly onset, and 195 persistent depression. Regardless of future prognosis, currently depressed patients had higher heart rate, lower HRV, and blunted cyclic variation of heart rate to sleep apnea during the night.",

        "abstract": "Tob (transducer of erbB2) is a member of antiproliferative family proteins and acts as a bone morphogenic protein inhibitor as well as a suppressor of proliferation in T cells, which have been implicated in postmenopausal bone loss. To determine the effect of Tob deficiency on estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss, we analyzed bone metabolism after ovariectomy or sham operation in Tob-deficient mice. Ovariectomy in WT mice decreased trabecular bone volume and bone mineral density (BMD) as expected. In Tob-deficient mice, ovariectomy reduced bone volume and BMD. However, even after ovariectomy, both trabecular bone volume and BMD levels in Tob-deficient bone were comparable to those in sham-operated WT bones. Bone formation parameters (mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate) in the ovariectomized Tob-deficient mice were significantly higher than those in the ovariectomized WT mice. In contrast, the ovariectomy-induced increase in the bone resorption parameters, osteoclast surface, and osteoclast number was similar between Tob-deficient mice and WT mice. Furthermore, in ex vivo nodule formation assay, ovariectomy-induced enhancement of nodule formation was significantly higher in the bone marrow cells from Tob-deficient mice than in the bone marrow cells from ovariectomized WT mice. Both Tob and estrogen signalings converge at bone morphogenic protein activation of alkaline phosphatase and GCCG-reporter gene expression in osteoblasts, revealing interaction between the two signals. These data indicate that Tob deficiency prevents ovariectomy-induced bone loss through the superenhancement of osteoblastic activities in bone and that this results in further augmentation in the bone formation rate and the mineral apposition rate after ovariectomy in vivo.",

        "abstract": "The effect of strain in REBa2Cu3O y (REBCO: RE = Y, Gd, Sm, Eu) coated conductors (CCs) on the critical current (I c) is one of the most fundamental factors for superconducting coil applications because CCs experience a variety of stresses. In this study, we carried out bending tests and measured the peak strain and the strain sensitivity of I c (a-value) for GdBCO CCs at 77 K under self-field. These values were evaluated for pure GdBCO CCs and BaHfO3 BHO-doped GdBCO CCs, which had oxide buffer layers with varying in-plane grain alignments of the CeO2 top layer. As a result, the peak strains and a-values for the BHO-doped GdBCO CCs depended on the FWHM of the CeO2 220 reflection in the -scan profile (Δ), and decreased monotonically with decreasing Δ. On the other hand, the peak strain and a-value were nearly independent of Δ in the pure-GdBCO CCs. The change in peak strains for the BHO-doped GdBCO CCs are discussed on the basis of the relative contribution of intra-grain I c and inter-grain I c to the macroscopic strain effect of I c in the CCs.",

The dlameter of the LCX remained essentially\n unchanged after administration of X + XO. However, EM-induced constriction was greater in the LCX than in the LAD. The difference\n of serotonin (S) concentrations in the CS and in the ostium of the LCA [(S in CS) - (S in LCA)] gradually increased after\n administration of X + XO. Electron microscopy of endothelial surface revealed marked changes in the LCX, but such changes\n were not observed in the LAD. These results suggest that the enhancement of the EM-induced vasoconstriction of coronary artery\n by oxygen free radicals may probably be due to the morphological change and the rise in the S produced by oxidative injury.\n ",

We measured blood flow and blood volume with an endoscopic laser-Doppler flowmeter in the lesions and the normal mucosa near the lesions of 79 tubular adenomas with mild dysplasia and 38 adenocarcinomas. Blood velocity was defined as blood flow per blood volume. The ratio of each value in the lesions to that in the neighboring normal mucosa was defined as the relative value, and the mean relative values in the two groups were compared. The relative blood flow was 1.89 +/- 0.64 in the tubular adenomas and 1.49 +/- 0.66 in the adenocarcinomas (P < 0.005), and the relative blood volume was 1.10 +/- 0.14 and 0.90 +/- 0.13, respectively (P < 0.001). The relative blood velocity was approximately 1.7 in both groups (NS). This study demonstrated that the superficial blood flow in adenocarcinomas is increased due to increased blood velocity, despite blood volume being decreased.",

The system incorporates a mobile phase conversion stage (LC-2), which has a dilution tube and a trapping column, between the achiral chromatography stage (LC-1) and the chiral chromatography stage (LC-3). KPF in plasma was separated from plasma components and was determined with the aid of an internal standard in LC-1. The eluate containing KPF was selectively transferred to LC-2, where the eluate was adequately diluted with a new mobile phase by using the dilution tube to reduce the influence of the mobile phase from LC-1, and KPF was reconcentrated on the trapping column. Then the KPF enantiomers were resolved in LC-3 after column-switching. This system is accurate and rapid compared with conventional HPLC. Very high sensitivity could be achieved with our system when a microbore ovomucoid column was employed in LC-3. Incorporation of LC-2 allows the most favourable mobile phases for LC-1 and LC-3 to be used independently. This method is greatly superior to usual column-switching HPLC.",

        "abstract": "In accordance with the results of our previous research, a low-temperature growth (LTG) technique is effective for expanding the lower growth temperature region of c-axis-orientated SmBa2Cu3O y (SmBCO) thin films. However, BaHfO3 (BHO)-doped LTG films show a marked decrease in J c at low magnetic fields compared with conventional PLD films. In this study, we aimed to clarify the mechanism of J c decrease and investigated the thickness dependence of the seed layer on the (LaAlO3)0.3(Sr2AlTaO6)0.7 (LSAT) (100) single crystal. The obtained results indicate that J c decreased at low magnetic fields as the thickness of the seed layer increased. It is suggested that flux line kinks produced by flux motion in the seed layer would lead to the depinning of flux lines from BHO nanorods in the upper layer. Thus, we added Y2O3 into the seed layer to trap flux lines in the seed layer. Consequently, we improved J c in the low magnetic field region even in the films prepared by using the LTG technique.",

We found that the timing of BHR shifts slightly, but significantly with the time of sleep (P < 0.0001); it occurs at 03:18 in nighttime sleepers on average, while it occurs at 02:35 in evening sleepers and 01:30 in daytime sleepers. The level of BHR, however, did not differ with the time of sleep (52–54 bpm for all).",

The compound also inhibited bovine heart type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP-kinase), but with a Ki of 25 microM. Thus, it is a selective inhibitor of cGMP-kinase. In alpha-toxin-skinned smooth muscle preparations from rat mesenteric artery, 8-Br-cGMP (10(-7) M) and 8-Br-cAMP (10(-6) M) produced a rightward shift of the concentration-contraction curves for Ca2+, denoting a decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile elements. The shift by 8-Br-cAMP as well as by 8-Br-cGMP was completely reversed by Rp-8-Br-cGMPS, while a selective inhibitor of activation of cAMP-kinase, (Rp)-adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate (Rp-cAMPS), was without effects on the shift produced by these two compounds. These findings indicate the pivotal role that the activation of cGMP-kinase plays in the production of a decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity of contractile elements.",

PTMC resulted in an increase in mitral valve area from 1.1 +/- 0.3 to 1.7 +/- 0.4 cm2 (p < 0.0001), a decrease in mean left atrial pressure from 16 +/- 7 to 13 +/- 5 mmHg (p < 0.0001), and an increase in exercise time from 4.6 +/- 2.1 to 6.3 +/- 2.3 min (p < 0.0001). At 6 months follow-up, mitral valve area was unchanged (1.7 +/- 0.4 cm2). Of 52 patients, 33 showed clinical improvement and 19 had no clinical improvement after PTMC. Univariate analysis showed (1) younger age, (2) echocardiographic score of 8 or less, (3) existence of mitral regurgitation of less than grade 2 after PTMC, and (4) amelioration in left atrial dimension, mean pulmonary artery pressure and exercise time after PTMC as correlative factors for clinical improvement. In conclusion, PTMC was an effective procedure for mitral stenosis, especially in younger patients with an echocardiographic score of 8 or less. Change in left atrial dimension was a good indicator of the effectiveness of PTMC.",

During the active phase of the disease, the NO3 excretion was significantly higher in the patients than in healthy controls (n = 6, p < 0.05), although it varied considerably among the patients. During the healing phase, the NO3 excretion decreased concurrently with improvement of symptoms and colorectal ulceration, but the NO2 excretion increased. During the inactive phase of the disease, the NO3 and NO2 excretions were significantly lower than during the active phase, and the NO2/NO3 ratio resembled that in the healthy controls. In contrast, a patient who failed to respond to treatment showed continuously high NO3 and NO2 excretion rates. These results indicate that urinary NO3 and NO2 excretions vary with the disease state in ulcerative colitis.",

Surface modified target approach is employed to incorporate nanoscale Y211 inclusions into the superconducting YBCO matrix. The efficiency of Y211 nanoinclusions in reducing the angular anisotropy of critical current density is found to be significant. The observed angular dependence of the critical current density is discussed on the basis of mutually occupied volume by a vortex and spherical and/or planar defect. A dip in JC near the ab-plane is also observed which has been analyzed on the basis of variation of pinning potential corresponding to a spherical (3-D) or planar (2-D) pinning center and has been attributed to a reduced int...",

The Mössbauer spectra of 57Fe in Si are well fitted with a curve consisting of two singlet lines, one being assigned as the interstitial Fe atoms and the other as substitutional ones. The relative intensities of the two lines infer that 60% of 57Fe ( ←57Mn) atoms land at the interstitial sites and 40% at the substitutional sites at temperatures between 30 K and 296 K. The result for the KMnO4 sample suggests a presence of an exotic chemical species corresponding to a higher valence state than Fe6 +.",

        "abstract": "The abundant in neuroepithelium area (ana) gene was originally identified as a member of the tob/btg family of antiproliferative genes. Like the other family members, Ana inhibits growth of NIH3T3 cells when overexpressed. However, whether or not Ana is involved in tumor progression has been elusive. Here, we show that expression of ana is relatively high in the lung, the expression being restricted in type II alveolar epithelial cells. We further show that ana expression is reduced in 97% of the human lung cancer cell lines examined (61/63) and 86% of clinical samples from lung adenocarcinoma patients (36/42). Long-term observation of ana-deficient (ana−/–) mice reveals that 8% of them develop lung tumors (5/66) by 21 months after birth, while 0% of wild-type mice (0/35) develop the same type of tumors. We also show that exogenously expressed ana gene product suppresses the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression in lung cancer cells. Taken together, we propose that ana functions as a tumor suppressor and that its product inhibits tumor progression as well by suppressing angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.",

        "abstract": "We evaluated the relation of atrial rhythm to a clinical course of treatment in 147 patients diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Thirty-six of the patients (24%) had either transient (9 patients) or persistent (27 patients) atrial fibrillation (AF). Compared with DCM patients with sinus rhythm (SR), the AF patients did not differ in age, left ventricular (LV) dimension, fractional shortening, or hemodynamic parameters, but the AF patients had slightly larger left atria. After a mean follow-up of 3.8 +/- 2.9 years, the NYHA functional classifications in the AF patients improved in 20 of the 36 (56%), whereas those of the SR patients improved in only 30 (27%) (p < 0.01). The actuarial 5-year survival rate was significantly better for AF patients than for SR patients (93% versus 68%, p < 0.05). LV function remained unchanged in SR patients but improved significantly in AF patients, particularly in patients with transient AF and with \"rate-controlled\" AF (those with a mean heart rate of less than 90 beats/min). This study suggests that atrial fibrillation may result in significant LV dysfunction, which is reversible in some cases once the arrhythmia is controlled. Aggressive antiarrhythmic therapy should be considered for patients initially diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation.",

The measuring system both for electrons and γ-rays combined with a new Mössbauer driver, i.e., “a moving coil actuator with a liner encoder” enables us to measure the mapping images simultaneously corresponding to different spectral components. The system has a controlling system based on a LabVIEW program and a LIST mode data acquisition system (NIKI-GLASS/A3100). To investigate a correlation between the microstructure of a sample and 57Fe atoms, a scanning electron microscope (APCO/Mini-EOC) is also installed to this system.",
