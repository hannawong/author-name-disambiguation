        "abstract": "Objective To study the gastric emptying of solids in children with chronic gastritis. Methods From Jan.2008 to Jan.2012 in Capital Institute of Pediatrics , the children aged 6 to 17 years with recurrent upper abdominal ( or cullen ) pain , upper abdominal discomfort associated with bloating , belching , nausea , vomiting , early satiety lasting for 2 months or more , and the onset more than once per week were asked to undergo electric endoscopy ; 65 chronic gastri tis patients were enrolled. The gastric emptying was measured by a radioscopic technique 5 h after a solid meal with radi opaque markers. Results HP positive patients accounted for 27.7%. There were no significant differences between HP positive patients and HP negative patients ( 11.1% and 21.3% , respectively ,P > 0.05 ) . Moderate and severe gastritis pa tients accounted for 66.7% in HP positive patients. For the postprandial 5 h emptying , 18.5% children with chronic gas tritis had less than 50% gastric emptying of solids , and 23.1% of them had less than 75% gastric emptying of solids. There were not any side effects of radiopaque markers in 24h in children with chronic gastritis. Conclusion Some of the children with chronic gastritis have gastro-obstraction , the clinical symptom hardly reflects the gastric emptying of solids. Radiopaque markers are safe and comply with its natural physiological state for children aged from 6 to 17. The in cidence of moderate and severe gastritis is higher in HP positive patients than in mild gastritis.",

        "abstract": "Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I (CN-I) is the most severe type of hereditary unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. It is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations of the UDP-glycuronosyltransferase gene (UGT1A1) on chromosome 2q37. Two patients clinically diagnosed with CN-I were examined in this paper. We sequenced five exons and their flanking sequences, specifically the promoter region of UGT1A1, of the two patients and their parents. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to determine the UGT1A1 gene copy number of one patient. In patient A, two mutations, c.239_245delCTGTGCC (p.Pro80HisfsX6; had not been reported previously) and c.1156G>T (p.Val386Phe), were identified. In patient B, we found that this patient had lost heterozygosity of the UGT1A1 gene by inheriting a deletion of one allele, and had a novel mutation c.1253delT (p.Met418ArgfsX5) in the other allele. In summary, we detected three UGT1A1 mutations in two CN-I patients: c.239_245delCTGTGCC (p.Pro80HisfsX6), c.1253delT (p.Met418ArgfsX5), and c.1156G>T (p.Val386Phe). The former two mutations are pathogenic; however, the pathogenic mechanism of c.1156G>T (p.Val386Phe) is unknown.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate whether the variation of the pathogenicity of enterovirus71(EV71) was related to the variation of the nucleotide sequencing of the virus of the full length genomes of EV71 strains isolated from pediatric patients with hand,foot and mouth disease (HFMD) presenting different symptoms in Beijing from 2008 to 2009.Methods Five EV71 strains in 2008 and 4 EV71 strains in 2009 isolated from Laboratory of Virology of Capital Institute of Pediatrics were chosen,of which 4 EV71 strains were isolated from severe HFMD children with high fever,continuous convulsion and loss of consciousness. Five EV71 strains were isolated from mild HFMD children.The full length genomes from 9 EV71 strains isolated from children with various clinical presentations were sequenced by amplification with RT-PCR and sequencing of 10 overlapped gene fragments covering full length of the genomes. Their nucleotide and amino acid sequences were aligned and phylogenetic relations of the sequences were analyzed by using DNAStar and MEGA software (version 4.1).Results The full length of 9 EV71 strains isolated from children in Beijing from 2008 to 2009 was 7 405 bp or 7 406 bp (Poly A tail not included) with a deletion in the 5'UTR for 6 out of these 9 strains. The overall nucleotide sequence identities of these 9 EV71 isolates were in the range of 96.3%-99.4%,while amino acid sequence identities were 98.2%-99.6%. The homology of the nucleotide sequences of VP1 of these 9 EV71 isolates was 96.9%-99.9%,while the homology of the amino acid sequences was 98.3%-100.0%. The majority of nucleotide changes were located at the third codon positions which caused silent mutations,thus the deduced amino acid sequence changes among those 9 EV71 isolates were scanty. The residue 144 in the VP2 protein and the residues 140 and 263 in the 3D polymerase (3Dpol) which were T,R and I were substituted by S,K and V,respectively in 3 out of 4 neurovirulent strains. Two bases,G and A at the nucleotides 208 and 254 in the 5'UTR were substituted respectively by A and G in the same 3 of those 4 neurovirulent strains. The nucleotide sequences of 9 EV71 isolates in the 5'UTR,P1,P2,P3 and 3'UTR regions exhibited the highest homology to the sub-genotype C4 of EV71. However,when compared with CV-A16 prototype strain G10,the nucleotide identities within the 3D and 3'UTR regions were higher than those of known genotypes A,B,C1-C3 and C5 of EV71. These 9 EV71 isolates formed a branch with other EV71 isolates circulating in mainland China and Taiwan previously identified as genotype C4 on the two phylogenetic trees.Conclusions The data from this study suggests that mutations at the residue 144 in the VP2 protein (T\u2192S),the residues 140 and 263 in the 3Dpol (R\u2192K and I\u2192V) and the nucleotide 254 in the 5'UTR (A\u2192G) may be associated with the severity of clinical presentations. Based on the entire VP1 gene sequences,the EV71 viruses circulating in Beijing from 2008 to 2009 should be classified as the sub-genotype C4. The non-structural protein encoding genomic regions may play a role in the evolution of EV71.",

To discuss the laboratory methods used to diagnosis measles in the early stage. Methods The throat swabs and urine samples of children and infants with clinical diagnosis or suspected measles and viral exanthema were collected from January to December in 2003. Measles N gene fragment was detected by using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serum specific IgM antibody against measles virus was also tested by ELISA. At the same time, we reviewed the clinical data of these patients. Results The majorty of patients with measles were children of low income people from area outside of Beijing. The highest morbidity were patients under 1 year of age. Mild and atypical cases were increased, and the cases with severe disease and death were decreased. In early clinical stage, positive rate of MV N gene fragment detected with RT-PCR in the throat swabs and urine samples was 87.5%(28/32), and the specific IgM antibody tested by ELISA was 67.9%(19/28). No significant difference was found between them. Conclusions Measles of children and infant cases have new clinical characteristics in recent years. The throat swabs and urine samples used for MV N gene fragment detection by using RT-PCR are easy to collect and single clinical sample can be tested. So identify gene material at early clinical stage of measles and in atypical measles is useful for clarifying the diagnosis and differential diagnosis.",

Registration form was designed for clinical data collection for each patient from whom specimen was collected. Poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) were used to detect rotavirus and Human norovirus, respectively.Among 779 stool specimens tested for rotavirus, 263 were positive (33.8%), and norovirus positive specimens were 79 out of 318 (24.8%) specimens tested. Most of the clinical manifestations of gastroenteritis caused by these two viruses were quite similar with no significant difference, except for fever. The seasonal distribution of these two viruses were different with the peak of rotavirus infection was in cold weather between October and January, as indicated by the peak of the positive rates of the virus detection. The infection of norovirus seemed no obvious peak in the year.Rotavirus is the most important pathogen for acute diarrhea among infants and young children while. Norovirus is also an important pathogen for acute gastroenteritis in infants and young children.

[Methods] Twenty 3-week-old male weanling SD rats,were selected and were randomly divided into two groups: dexamethasone group and control group. The rats in dexamethasone group received dexamethasone (200 \u03bcg /100g body weight,) for 10 days. The rats in the control group received matching volume sodium chloride solution. All rats were determined by measuring the length of tibiae and the length of the tip of the nose to the end of the tail. The proximal tibiae were excised, fixed and decalcified, then paraffin embedded. Sections, 5 \u03bcm thick were cut. Masson trichrome staining( light green counterstain). Morphometric analysis was used by leica QWin. Total height of growth plate, height of proliferative zone and height of hypertrophic zone were determined. [Results] The length of tibiae and the length of the tip of the nose to the end of the tail in dexamethasone group were less than the control group. Total height of growth plate, height of proliferative zone and height of hypertrophic zone in dexamethasone group were less than the control group. [Conclusion] Dexamethasone directly inhibits the longitudinal growth of bone in rats.",

        "abstract": "The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are known as both synaptic receptors and taste receptors. This feature is highly similar to the Property and Flavor theory of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which has the pharmacological effect and flavor. In this study, six ligand based pharmacophore (LBP) models, seven homology modeling models, and fourteen molecular docking models of mGluRs were built based on orthosteric and allosteric sites to screening potential compounds from Traditional Chinese Medicine Database (TCMD). Based on the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China, TCMs of compounds and their flavors were traced and listed. According to the tracing result, we found that the TCMs of the compounds which bound to orthosteric sites of mGluRs are highly correlated to a sweet flavor, while the allosteric site corresponds to a bitter flavor. Meanwhile, the pharmacological effects of TCMs with highly frequent flavors were further analyzed. We found that those TCMs play a neuroprotective role through the efficiencies of detumescence, promoting blood circulation, analgesic effect, and so on. This study provides a guide for developing new neuroprotective drugs from TCMs which target mGluRs. Moreover, it is the first study to present a novel approach to discuss the association relationship between flavor and the neuroprotective mechanism of TCM based on mGluRs.",

        "abstract": "Squalene synthase (SQS), a key downstream enzyme involved in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, plays an important role in treating hyperlipidemia. Compared to statins, SQS inhibitors have shown a very significant lipid-lowering effect and do not cause myotoxicity. Thus, the paper aims to discover potential SQS inhibitors from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) by the combination of molecular modeling methods and biological assays. In this study, cynarin was selected as a potential SQS inhibitor candidate compound based on its pharmacophoric properties, molecular docking studies and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Cynarin could form hydrophobic interactions with PHE54, LEU211, LEU183 and PRO292, which are regarded as important interactions for the SQS inhibitors. In addition, the lipid-lowering effect of cynarin was tested in sodium oleate-induced HepG2 cells by decreasing the lipidemic parameter triglyceride (TG) level by 22.50%. Finally. cynarin was reversely screened against other anti-hyperlipidemia targets which existed in HepG2 cells and cynarin was unable to map with the pharmacophore of these targets, which indicated that the lipid-lowering effects of cynarin might be due to the inhibition of SQS. This study discovered cynarin is a potential SQS inhibitor from TCM, which could be further clinically explored for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.",

        "abstract": "Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor to atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease II. The abnormal rise of cholesterol in plasma is the main symptom. Cholesterol synthesis pathway is an important pathway of the origin of cholesterol, which is an essential pathway for the therapy of hypercholesterolemia. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), squalene synthase (SQS), and sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) are closely connected with the synthesis of cholesterol. The inhibition of these targets can reduce the cholesterol in plasma. This study aimed to build a component formula including three Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCM) components with the inhibition activity of these targets by using virtual screening and biological network. Structure-based pharmacophore models of HMG-CoA reductase and SQS and ligand-based pharmacophore model of SREBP-2 were constructed to screen the Traditional Chinese Medicine Database (TCMD). Molecular docking was used for further screening of components of HMG-CoA reductase and SQS. Then, metabolic network was constructed to elucidate the comprehensive interaction of three targets for lipid metabolism. Finally, three potential active compounds were obtained, which are poncimarin, hexahydrocurcumin, and forsythoside C. The source plants of the compounds were also taken into account, which should have known action of lowering hyperlipidemia. The lipid-lowering effect of hexahydrocurcumin was verified by experiment in vitro. The components that originated from TCMs with lipid-lowering efficacy made up a formula with a synergistic effect through the computer aid drug design methods. The research provides a fast and efficient method to build TCM component formula and it may inspire the study of the explanation of TCM formula mechanism.",

The main purpose of this study was to obtain potent anti-hypertensive peptides from  glutelin. The  glutelin hydrolysates (CGH) were prepared by pepsin catalysis and further separated by an ultrafitration (UF) system, gel filtration chromatography (GFC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). As a result, the sub-fraction F5-3 had the highest ACE-inhibitory activity. Six ACE inhibitory peptides were identifiedusing nano-liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The most potent peptide GAAGGAF (IC = 14.19 \u03bcmol\u00b7L) was finally obtained by further molecular simulation screening and a series of division and optimization. Single oral administration of synthesized GAAGGAF at 15 mg/kg body weight (BW) in spontaneously hypertensively rats (SHR) could reduce the systolic blood pressure (SBP) around 27.50 mmHg and blood pressure-lowering effect lasted for at least 8 h. The study demonstrated for the first time that the ACE inhibitory peptide GAAGGAF from  glutelin has a significant antihypertensive effect, and it could be a good natural ingredient for pharmaceuticals against hypertension and the related diseases.",

        "abstract": "Aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) is a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of aldosterone, which plays a significant role for the regulation of blood pressure. Excess aldosterone can cause the dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and lead to hypertension. Therefore, research and development of CYP11B2 inhibitor are regarded as a novel approach for the treatment of hypertension. In this study, the pharmacophore models of CYP11B2 inhibitors were generated and the optimal model was used to identify potential CYP11B2 inhibitors from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Database (TCMD, Version 2009). The hits were further refined by molecular docking and the interactions between compounds and CYP11B2 were analyzed. Compounds with high Fitvalue, high docking score, and expected interactions with key residues were selected as potential CYP11B2 inhibitors. Two most promising compounds, ethyl caffeate and labiatenic acid, with high Fitvalue and docking score were reserved for molecular dynamics (MD) study. All of them have stability of ligand binding which suggested that they might perform the inhibitory effect on CYP11B2. This study provided candidates for novel drug-like CYP11B2 inhibitors by molecular simulation methods for the hypertension treatment.",

        "abstract": "Adlay ( L.) was the commonly used Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with high content of seed storage protein. The hydrolyzed bioactive oligopeptides of adlay have been proven to be anti-hypertensive effective components. However, the structures and anti-hypertensive mechanism of bioactive oligopeptides from adlay were not clear. To discover the definite anti-hypertensive oligopeptides from adlay, in silico proteolysis and virtual screening were implemented to obtain potential oligopeptides, which were further identified by biochemistry assay and molecular dynamics simulation. In this paper, ten sequences of adlay prolamins were collected and in silico hydrolyzed to construct the oligopeptide library with 134 oligopeptides. This library was reverse screened by anti-hypertensive pharmacophore database, which was constructed by our research team and contained ten anti-hypertensive targets. Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) was identified as the main potential target for the anti-hypertensive activity of adlay oligopeptides. Three crystal structures of ACE were utilized for docking studies and 19 oligopeptides were finally identified with potential ACE inhibitory activity. According to mapping features and evaluation indexes of pharmacophore and docking, three oligopeptides were selected for biochemistry assay. An oligopeptide sequence, NPATY (IC = 61.88 \u00b1 2.77 \u00b5M), was identified as the ACE inhibitor by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) assay. Molecular dynamics simulation of NPATY was further utilized to analyze interactive bonds and key residues. ALA354 was identified as a key residue of ACE inhibitors. Hydrophobic effect of VAL518 and electrostatic effects of HIS383, HIS387, HIS513 and Zn were also regarded as playing a key role in inhibiting ACE activities. This study provides a research strategy to explore the pharmacological mechanism of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) proteins based on in silico proteolysis and virtual screening, which could be beneficial to reveal the pharmacological action of TCM proteins and provide new lead compounds for peptides-based drug design.",

LBP can be utilized to identify active compounds usual with lower accuracy, and SBP is able to use for distinguishing active compounds from inactive compounds with frequently higher missing rates. Merged pharmacophore (MP) is presented to integrate advantages and avoid shortcomings of LBP and SBP. In this work, LBP and SBP models were constructed for the study of peroxisome proliferator receptor-alpha (PPAR \u03b1 ) agonists. According to the comparison of the two types of pharmacophore models, mainly and secondarily pharmacological features were identified. The weight and tolerance values of these pharmacological features were adjusted to construct MP models by single-factor explorations and orthogonal experimental design based on SBP model. Then, the reliability and screening efficiency of the best MP model were validated by three databases. The best MP model was utilized to compute PPAR \u03b1  activity of compounds from traditional Chinese medicine. The screening efficiency of MP model outperformed individual LBP or SBP model for PPAR \u03b1  agonists, and was similar to combinatorial screening of LBP and SBP. However, MP model might have an advantage over the combination of LBP and SBP in evaluating the activity of compounds and avoiding the inconsistent prediction of LBP and SBP, which would be beneficial to guide drug design and optimization.",

It contained abundant glutelin, thus the purpose of this study was to obtain potent antihypertensive peptides from vinegar soaked black soybean. Black soybean was soaked with vinegar and then glutelin was first catalyzed by alcalase. Ultrafitration, ion exchange chromatography and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography were sequentially applied to separate and purify the angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from glutelin hydrolysates. As a result, the fraction L1-4 with the highest ACE inhibitory activity (83.41%) at the final concentration of 0.01\u2009mg/mL was obtained and five peptides were then identified. These peptides were further optimized by virtual screening combining with in silico proteolysis. Finally a novel tetrapeptide FGSF was obtained. FGSF exhibited high in vitro ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 = 117.11\u2009\u03bcM) and in vivo hypotensive effect which maximally reduced systolic blood pressure of 21.95\u2009mmHg at 20\u2009mg/kg body weight in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Our study demonstrated that FGSF derived from vinegar soaked black soybean might be used as a promising ingredient for pharmaceuticals against hypertension and its related diseases.",

        "abstract": ", known as Danshen, has attracted worldwide interest for its substantial effects on coronary heart disease (CHD). Danshensu (DSS) is one of the main active ingredients of Danshen on CHD. Although it has been proven to have a good clinical effect on CHD, the action mechanisms remain elusive. In the current study, a coexpression network-based approach was used to illustrate the beneficial properties of DSS in the context of CHD. By integrating the gene expression profile data and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) data, two coexpression protein interaction networks (CePIN) in a CHD state (CHD CePIN) and a non-CHD state (non-CHD CePIN) were generated. Then, shared nodes and unique nodes in CHD CePIN were attained by conducting a comparison between CHD CePIN and non-CHD CePIN. By calculating the topological parameters of each shared node and unique node in the networks, and comparing the differentially expressed genes, target proteins involved in disease regulation were attained. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment was utilized to identify biological processes associated to target proteins. Consequently, it turned out that the treatment of CHD with DSS may be partly attributed to the regulation of immunization and blood circulation. Also, it indicated that sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (SLC9A3), Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (PTGS2), Oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (OLR1), and fibrinogen gamma chain (FGG) may be potential therapeutic targets for CHD. In summary, this study provided a novel coexpression protein interaction network approach to provide an explanation of the mechanisms of DSS on CHD and identify key proteins which maybe the potential therapeutic targets for CHD.",

        "abstract": "High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) provides a powerful tool for the rapid analysis and identification of compounds in herbs. However, the diversity and large differences in the content of the chemical constituents in herbal medicines, especially isomerisms, are a great challenge for mass spectrometry-based structural identification. In the current study, a new strategy for the structural characterization of potential new phthalide compounds was proposed by isomer structure predictions combined with a quantitative structure-retention relationship (QSRR) analysis using phthalide compounds in Chuanxiong as an example. This strategy consists of three steps. First, the structures of phthalide compounds were reasonably predicted on the basis of the structure features and MS/MS fragmentation patterns: (1) the collected raw HRMS data were preliminarily screened by an in-house database; (2) the MS/MS fragmentation patterns of the analogous compounds were summarized; (3) the reported phthalide compounds were identified, and the structures of the isomers were reasonably predicted. Second, the QSRR model was established and verified using representative phthalide compound standards. Finally, the retention times of the predicted isomers were calculated by the QSRR model, and the structures of these peaks were rationally characterized by matching retention times of the detected chromatographic peaks and the predicted isomers. A multiple linear regression QSRR model in which 6 physicochemical variables were screened was built using 23 phthalide standards. The retention times of the phthalide isomers in Chuanxiong were well predicted by the QSRR model combined with reasonable structure predictions (R\u202f=\u202f0.955). A total of 81 peaks were detected from Chuanxiong and assigned to reasonable structures, and 26 potential new phthalide compounds were structurally characterized. This strategy can improve the identification efficiency and reliability of homologues in complex materials.",

Herein, we developed a strategy using virtual screening and affinity-screening based on a fabricated biosensor combined with UPLC-MS analysis to screen TAS2R14 agonists from Platycodon grandiflorum. By ligand-based virtual screening, 16 best-fit candidates were yielded. A novel TAS2R14-functionalized HEMT sensor was applied to detect and fish out the potential TAS2R14 agonists from P. grandiflorum extracts. Those components captured by the immobilized TAS2R14 were eluted and characterized on UPLC-QTOF MS. As results, six potential TAS2R14 agonists were screened out and identified. Among them, platycodin L was confirmed to be a special agonist of TAS2R14 for the first time and had an EC of 15.03 \u00b1 1.15 \u03bcM via intracellular calcium mobilization assay (n=6). The results indicated that the proposed strategy was efficient to discover TAS2R14 agonists from herb directly.",

        "abstract": "Aurantio-obtusin, an anthraquinone compound, isolated from dried seeds of  L. (syn. ; Fabaceae) and  L. (syn. ). Although the biological activities of  have been reported, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of aurantio-obtusin, its main compound, on RAW264.7 cells, remained unknown. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of aurantio-obtusin on lipopolysaccharide- (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells in vitro and elucidated the possible underlying molecular mechanisms. Nitric oxide production (NO) and prostaglandin E\u2082 (PGE\u2082) were measured by the Griess colorimetric method and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Protein expression levels of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) were monitored by cell-based ELISA. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) synthesis were analyzed using ELISA. The mRNA expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), COX-2, and the critical pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. Aurantio-obtusin significantly decreased the production of NO, PGE\u2082, and inhibited the protein expression of COX-2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, which were similar to those gene expression of iNOS, COX-2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 ( < 0.01). Consistent with the pro-inflammatory gene expression, the Aurantio-obtusin efficiently reduced the LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB in RAW264.7 cells. These results suggested that aurantio-obtusin may function as a therapeutic agent and can be considered in the further development of treatments for a variety of inflammatory diseases. Further studies may provide scientific evidence for the use of aurantio-obstusin as a new therapeutic agent for inflammation-related diseases.",

        "abstract": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) autocrine and paracrine signaling modulate cell proliferation of tumor cells by activating its receptors, endothelin A receptor (ETAR) and endothelin B receptor (ETBR). Dysregulation of ETAR activation promotes tumor development and progression. The potential of ETAR antagonists and the dual-ETAR and ETBR antagonists as therapeutic approaches are under preclinical and clinical studies. Salvianolic acid A (Sal A) is a hydrophilic polyphenolic derivative isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen), which has been reported as an anti-cancer and cardio-protective herbal medicine. In this study, we demonstrate that Sal A inhibits ETAR activation induced by ET-1 in both recombinant and endogenous ETAR expression cell lines. The IC50 values were determined as 5.7 \u00b5M in the HEK293/ETAR cell line and 3.14 \u00b5M in HeLa cells, respectively. Furthermore, our results showed that Sal A suppressed cell proliferation and extended the doubling times of multiple cancer cells, including HeLa, DU145, H1975, and A549 cell lines. In addition, Sal A inhibited proliferation of DU145 cell lines stimulated by exogenous ET-1 treatment. Moreover, the cytotoxicity and cardio-toxicity of Sal A were assessed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs), which proved that Sal A demonstrates no cytotoxicity or cardiotoxicity. Collectively, our findings indicate that Sal A is a novel anti-cancer candidate through targeting ETAR. ",

        "abstract": "Improper usage of unprocessed Radix bupleuri root (chaihu) may cause cardiotoxicity and liver injury. Baking herb with vinegar is believed to attenuate the adverse responses. However, the chemical and molecular basis involved remained unclear. To this end, we investigated the in vitro toxicity of saikosaponin a, c, d, and their hydrolysates saikosaponin b1 and b2. Results showed that SSa and SSd possessed higher affinity with sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) by molecular docking, and exhibited stronger toxic responses on cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes than the other three saikosaponins in equivalent concentrations. Further, SSa and SSd induced LC3 puncta formation in U2OS-mCherry-EGFP-LC3 cells. Blockage of autophagy by 3-methyladenine did not abrogate the cytotoxicities induced by SSa and SSd. In parallel, none of SSc, SSb1, or SSb2 caused cell injury. Our study reveals how changes in chemical ingredients are connected to the toxicity of Chaihu during vinegar baking process and also provides a guidance for structure optimization to reduce drug induced toxicity.",

        "title": "Traditional Chinese Bitter Flavor theory: Is there any relation with taste type II receptors?",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Introduction  As a guiding principle, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theories study the formation, mechanism and the regularity of application of Chinese herbs. This is limited by the understanding of the natural properties of the herbs at the cognitive level. As an important part of TCM theories the  Five Flavor  theory describes the function of drugs with five tasting adjectives: bitter, sweet, pungent, sour and salty.    Methods  In this study, we present the hypotheses that  Bitter Flavor  theory has instructive significance on account of its relationship with bitter taste receptors (taste receptors, type 2, also known as T2Rs). Due to the lack of crystallized structure of T2Rs,  in silico  modeling method allows us to visualize the relationship between compounds from TCM showing  Bitter Flavor  property and T2Rs. In this study, pharmacophore models of T2R1, T2R10, T2R14 and T2R46 have been generated to screen agonists from TCM showing  Bitter Flavor  properties.    Results  According to the simulation results, 71.84% agonists of T2Rs were derived from medicinal herbs showing  Bitter Flavor  properties and the experimental evidence of the hits through virtual screening was validated via literature mining.    Conclusion  The methods used in this research on bitter taste receptors supports the assumptions underpinning the traditional Chinese  Bitter Flavor  theory and provides a way to explore the potential science behind the Five Flavors theory of TCM which could be extended to explore other similar problems in TCM theory.",

        "abstract": "Studies of human genetics have implicated the role of SIRT1 in regulating obesity, insulin resistance, and longevity. These researches motivated the identification of novel SIRT1 activators. The current study aimed to investigate the potential efficacy of agrimol B, a polyphenol derived from Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb., on mediating SIRT1 activity and fat metabolism. Results showed that agrimol B significantly induced cytoplasm-to-nucleus shuttle of SIRT1. Furthermore, we confirmed that agrimol B dramatically inhibited 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation by reducing PPAR\u03b3, C/EBP\u03b1, FAS, UCP-1, and apoE expression. Consequently, adipogenesis was blocked by treatment of agrimol B at the early stage of differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, the IC50 value was determined as 3.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32\u00a0\u03bcM. Taken together, our data suggest a therapeutic potential of agrimol B on alleviating obesity, through modulation of SIRT1-PPAR\u03b3 signal pathway.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Objective  Lipid droplet (LD) deposition in adipose tissue is a critical factor leading to metabolic dysfunction. Various herbal medicines in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are used to treat hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and other diseases. The objective of this study was to identify potential anti-adipogenic agents from TCM herbal compounds.    Methods  One hundred and twenty compounds were evaluated in terms of their effect on adipocyte differentiation through image-based high content screening. Anti-adipogenic effects of identified hits were further confirmed at various concentrations. In addition, drug-induced liver injury assay was performed with HepG2 cells to test the hepatotoxicity of hit compounds.    Results  Berbamine (BBM), a chemical isolated from barberry, and a derivative of BBM, berbamine dihydrochloride (BBMD), reduced LDs formation by more than 50%. Dose-dependent effects were observed and the IC 50  values of the two hits, BBM and BBMD, were determined as 1.88\u00a0\u03bcM and 0.95\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. Moreover, BBM induced mild HepG2 cell injury, while its dihydrochloride\u2014BBMD did not exhibit hepatotoxicity within 40\u00a0\u03bcM.    Conclusion  This study demonstrates that BBMD may be a potential therapeutic candidate for disorders associated with elevated LDs accumulation.",

Differences in prescription compatibility result in varying emphases of DQAF in clinical application.    Methods and results  Based on network analysis in this study, common and distinct mechanisms of DQAF actions on cardiovascular disease were analyzed at a systemic level. Components\u2013targets\u2013pathways models were developed by Cytoscape ( http://www.cytoscape.org/ ); whereby, target information for active compounds was obtained based on the PharmMapper database ( http://59.78.96.61/pharmmapper/ ), which was further used to search pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database ( http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ ). Based on target and network analyses, we discovered RBP4 is a potential common target of DQAF, while mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) and glutathione S-transferase P were potential targets of FFDS and QSYQ, respectively. Furthermore, the potential of DQAF to treat cardiovascular disease occurs through effects on the endocrine, immune, and digestive systems, in addition to lipid, sugar and amino acid metabolic pathways. Whereas FFDS exhibits effects on Toll-like receptor, transforming growth factor beta and MAPK signaling pathways; QSYQ exerts effects on cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling, as well as metabolism of glutathione and arachidonic acid.    Conclusion  This study not only reflects the formulas-effect modality of multiple compounds, targets and pathways, but also provides clues to better understand physiological mechanisms of DQAF.",

In this study, we investigated the relationship between transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) and pungent flavor using three-dimensional pharmacophores based on virtual screening methods.    Methods  Firstly, an inhouse database was established to identify the related pharmacological action according to the traditional Chinese herbs expressing an action of promoting blood circulation. Then, several therapeutic targets, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) and platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR), were selected to screen traditional Chinese herbs, and the common virtual screening hits with various hit scores providing data to reveal the correlation among TRPM8 and therapeutic targets.    Results  According to the screening results, TRPM8 agonists were able to identify the effective components of pungent herbs and TRPM8, which shares the common virtual screening hits with the therapeutic targets, was considered to be related to the action of pungent taste.

        "abstract": "Aurantio-obtusin, an anthraquinone compound, isolated from dried seeds of Cassia obtusifolia L. (syn. Senna obtusifolia; Fabaceae) and Cassia tora L. (syn. Senna tora). Although the biological activities of Semen Cassiae have been reported, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of aurantio-obtusin, its main compound, on RAW264.7 cells, remained unknown. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of aurantio-obtusin on lipopolysaccharide- (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells in vitro and elucidated the possible underlying molecular mechanisms. Nitric oxide production (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were measured by the Griess colorimetric method and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Protein expression levels of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) were monitored by cell-based ELISA. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) synthesis were analyzed using ELISA. The mRNA expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), COX-2, and the critical pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. Aurantio-obtusin significantly decreased the production of NO, PGE2, and inhibited the protein expression of COX-2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, which were similar to those gene expression of iNOS, COX-2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 (p u003c 0.01). Consistent with the pro-inflammatory gene expression, the Aurantio-obtusin efficiently reduced the LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB in RAW264.7 cells. These results suggested that aurantio-obtusin may function as a therapeutic agent and can be considered in the further development of treatments for a variety of inflammatory diseases. Further studies may provide scientific evidence for the use of aurantio-obstusin as a new therapeutic agent for inflammation-related diseases.",

Using evaluation indicators, the best hypothesis model, Hypo1, was selected and utilised to screen the Traditional Chinese Medicine Database, which resulted in a hit list of 58 drug-like compounds. A homology model of MTP was built by MODELLER and was minimised by CHARMm force field. It was then validated by Ramachandran plot and Verify-3D so as to obtain a stable structure, which was further used to refine the 58 hits using molecular docking studies. Then, five compounds with higher docking scores which satisfied the docking requirements were discovered. Among them, Ginkgetin and Dauricine were most likely to be candidates that exhibition inhibiting effect on MTP.

The reported identification methods only consider the interaction between the components and the target proteins, which is not sufficient to explain the influence of TCM on the gene expression. Here, we propose the Initial Transcription Process-based Identification (ITPI) method for the discovery of bioactive components that influence transcription factors (TFs). In this method, genome-wide chip detection technology was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The TFs of DEGs were derived from GeneCards. The components influencing the TFs were derived from STITCH. The bioactive components in the formula were identified by evaluating the molecular similarity between the components in formula and the components that influence the TF of DEGs. Using the formula of Tian-Zhu-San (TZS) as an example, the reliability and limitation of ITPI were examined and 16 bioactive components that influence TFs were identified. ",

        "abstract": "The identification of bioactive components in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is an important part of the TCM material foundation research. Recently, molecular docking technology has been extensively used for the identification of TCM bioactive components. However, target proteins that are used in molecular docking may not be the actual TCM target. For this reason, the bioactive components would likely be omitted or incorrect. To address this problem, this study proposed the GEPSI method that identified the target proteins of TCM based on the similarity of gene expression profiles. The similarity of the gene expression profiles affected by TCM and small molecular drugs was calculated. The pharmacological action of TCM may be similar to that of small molecule drugs that have a high similarity score. Indeed, the target proteins of the small molecule drugs could be considered TCM targets. Thus, we identified the bioactive components of a TCM by molecular docking and verified the reliability of this method by a literature investigation. Using the target proteins that TCM actually affected as targets, the identification of the bioactive components was more accurate. This study provides a fast and effective method for the identification of TCM bioactive components.",

Distinguishing the interacting network from learning network provides a chance to study indirect reciprocity in networks. Unlike previous research, we propose a coevolution model of cooperation and complex networks via indirect reciprocity, where an individual can interact globally but update strategy locally. Based on this model, we describe the simulation results of coevolution, including the effects of rewiring mechanism on the evolution of cooperation, and how the evolution of cooperation affects networks restructure. Results show that rewiring mechanism favors the evolution of cooperation and the evolution of cooperation can restructure social networks. To understand and explain the results in detail, we graphically depict the snapshots of coevolution process.

        "abstract": "Most previous models about the public goods game usually assume two possible strategies,  i.e. , investing all or nothing. The real-life situation is rarely all or nothing. In this paper, we consider that multiple strategies are adopted in a well-mixed population, and each strategy represents an investment to produce the public goods. Past efforts have found that randomness matters in the evolution of fairness in the ultimatum game. In the framework involving no other mechanisms, we study how diversity and randomness influence the average investment of the population defined by the mean value of all individualsu0027 strategies. The level of diversity is increased by increasing the strategy number, and the level of randomness is increased by increasing the mutation probability, or decreasing the population size or the selection intensity. We find that a higher level of diversity and a higher level of randomness lead to larger average investment and favor more the evolution of cooperation. Under weak selection, the average investment changes very little with the strategy number, the population size, and the mutation probability. Under strong selection, the average investment changes very little with the strategy number and the population size, but changes a lot with the mutation probability. Under intermediate selection, the average investment increases significantly with the strategy number and the mutation probability, and decreases significantly with the population size. These findings are meaningful to study how to maintain the public resource.",

Indirect reciprocity means that players cooperate with other unfamiliar players whose reputation is good. In the previous studies, authors ignore that the process of establishing the reputation system requires some effort from observers. Here, by computer simulation, we find that indirect reciprocity dose not work in the presence of the cost of reputation building. However, in this paper, considering the cost of reputation building, we propose a model of indirect reciprocity in which introducing a punishment mechanism for observers and the section of exchanging the information of observers. we find that most of players are willing to spread the reputation of donors in this situation. Finally, reputation system can be established. Natural selection favors indirect reciprocal cooperation. Nevertheless, with the increase of the cost of reputation building, the frequency of cooperation decreases. So, in future research, our work will be dedicated to finding a better mechanism to overcome it.",

In this paper, we consider the form of gossiping image score to study multi-valued gossip computational methods. Specifically, during the gossip session, two gossipers first gossip to each other their private image scores to everyone, then private image score matrix are updated together in accordance with the average, maximum and minimum of private image scores between two gossipers. Individual-based simulation and analytical results indicated that the three gossip computational methods will lead to the promotion of cooperation compared to the traditional image score model. Among them, when gossip times are greater than a certain threshold, the promotion of cooperation under the minimum method is highest, followed by the maximum method, the average method is worst, and we introduce the index of average image score, intuitively explained the conclusion. Thus, we can conclude that current results further enrich the form of gossip and explores the impact of different multi - valued gossip computational methods for promoting cooperation.",

        "abstract": "Direct reciprocity is a mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. Iterated games provide a game theoretic framework for studying the evolution of cooperation through direct reciprocity. Here, we study the iterated two-player continuous public goods game in finite populations by adaptive dynamics. We consider that cooperative investments are determined by the initial investment and the reciprocation rate which describes the relation between a playeru0027s current investment and its opponentu0027s last investment. Many previous models neglect the interaction between the initial investment and the reciprocation rate and investigate them separately. Thus, it is still unclear how the coevolution of these two traits influences the game dynamics. Here, we study their coevolution. Mean strategies and generous ones are proposed. Players who adopt the former (latter) always invest no more (less) than what their opponents did in the last round. We find that the evolutionary fate of a mean population is entirely determined by the reciprocation rate: if it exceeds a threshold, the population evolves to full cooperation; otherwise, it evolves to full defection. For a generous population, full cooperation is always achieved.",

        "abstract": "Cooperative is essential for the maintenance of public resource, however, individualu0027s selfish behavior will reduce cooperation level and public resource. Here, we investigate the two-person public goods game in finite populations with multiple strategies. Under weak selection, theoretical results are found to be in excellent agreement with simulation results. Two representative update rules are used in our model and their results are compared: under weak selection, the cooperative level is higher in the Moran process than that in the Wright Fisher process, which is up to the payoff function and the strategyu0027s update frequency. Besides, we also investigate how mutation rate or enhancement factor influences the amount of public resource. Under strong selection, public resource is more insensitive to mutation rate, and raising enhancement factor alone is in vain until its value gets large enough. However, under weak selection, even at a very low mutation rate, there is a better linear relation existing between public resource and enhancement factor. These findings not only have practical significance, but also provide a guidance to improve the cooperation level.",

        "abstract": "In iterated continuous games, the cooperative investment in a given round is determined by the initial investment and the reciprocation rate, which describe the investment in the first round and the dependence of current investment on the partner's last move, respectively. These two traits usually intertwine during evolution. However, their coevolution is not fully explored. In this paper, we thereby study their coevolution in the iterated continuous public goods games. We find that the reciprocation rate plays a dominant role during the coevolution in both finite and infinite populations. If it exceeds a threshold, a stingy population where individuals invest no more than their partner's last investment evolves to full cooperation, and a generous population where individuals invest more than their partner's last investment decreases to a moderate cooperative state, investing a portion in the first round and then escalating investment in the following rounds. Otherwise, the stingy population evolves to full defection, and the generous one rises to another moderate cooperative state.",

        "abstract": "In order to effectively enhance the efficiency of dephosphorization, the distribution ratios of phosphorus between CaO-FeO-SiO2-Al2O3/Na2O/TiO2 slags and carbon-saturated iron (( L_{text{P}}^{text{Fe-C}} )) were examined through laboratory experiments in this study, along with the effects of different influencing factors such as the temperature and concentrations of the various slag components. Thermodynamic simulations showed that, with the addition of Na2O and Al2O3, the liquid areas of the CaO-FeO-SiO2 slag are enlarged significantly, with Al2O3 and Na2O acting as fluxes when added to the slag in the appropriate concentrations. The experimental data suggested that ( L_{text{P}}^{text{Fe-C}} ) increases with an increase in the binary basicity of the slag, with the basicity having a greater effect than the temperature and FeO content; ( L_{text{P}}^{text{Fe-C}} ) increases with an increase in the Na2O content and decrease in the Al2O3 content. In contrast to the case for the dephosphorization of molten steel, for the hot-metal dephosphorization process investigated in this study, the FeO content of the slag had a smaller effect on ( L_{text{P}}^{text{Fe-C}} ) than did the other factors such as the temperature and slag basicity. Based on the experimental data, by using regression analysis, ( log L_{text{P}}^{text{Fe-C}} ) could be expressed as a function of the temperature and the slag component concentrations as follows:  begin{aligned} log L_{text{P}}^{text{Fe-C}} u0026 = 0.059({text{pct}};{text{CaO}}) + 1.583log ({text{TFe}}) - 0.052left( {{text{pct}};{text{SiO}}_{2} } right) - 0.014left( {{text{pct}};{text{Al}}_{2} {text{O}}_{3} } right)  , u0026 quad + 0.142left( {{text{pct}};{text{Na}}_{2} {text{O}}} right) - 0.003left( {{text{pct}};{text{TiO}}_{2} } right) + 0.049left( {{text{pct}};{text{P}}_{2} {text{O}}_{5} } right) + frac{13{,}527}{T} - 9.87.  end{aligned} $$",

The degree of sphericity of the particles was introduced as a parameter for characterizing the effect of the particle shape on the apparent viscosity of liquid\u2013solid systems. The results indicated that with an increase in the degree of sphericity of the particles, the apparent viscosity decreased. However, the presented well-known prediction models, such as Krieger-Doughertyu0027s model and Batcheloru0027s model only consider the effect of the particle fraction on the apparent viscosity of liquid\u2013solid suspensions, whereas the effect of the particle shape is neglected. Based on the experimental data, the particle shape was introduced to modify Krieger-Doughertyu0027s and Batcheloru0027s models. The apparent viscosity can be successfully predicted using the modified model.",

Herein, the effect of Cr 2 O 3  on the microstructure and crystallization behavior of synthetic diopside, as well as the solubility of Cr 2 O 3  in diopside is discussed. Samples were prepared by the melting method and characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results show that the maximum achievable solubility of Cr 2 O 3  in diopside is between 1% and 3% by weight, and that the magnesiachrome spinel formed by Cr 2 O 3  can act as a nucleating agent for the diopside phase. Glass ceramics was prepared by synthesis slag which simulates the chromium-containing waste. The activation energy of crystallization is 274 KJ/mol and Avrami parameter is 3.23. The leaching behavior of glass ceramics was studied. Additionally, the effect of Cr 2 O 3  on the mechanisms of phase change were discussed. The study provides a theoretical basis for the preparation of chromium containing waste-based silicate materials with diopside as the main crystalline phase.",

        "abstract": "Lithium carbonate (LiCO), one of the most important lithium compounds, is usually prepared from lithium-containing solution. The lithium recovery rate and the purity of LiCO are highly dependent on the lithium concentration. In order to get a high lithium recovery rate, high concentrated lithium-containing solution is required, while the purity of LiCO can be low remaining a significant amount of impurities. Usually, it is not possible to obtain high purity LiCO by single-step precipitation with a relatively high lithium recovery rate especially from a low concentrated lithium-containing solution. In this research, ultrasound is introduced to increase lithium recovery rate and prepare industrial grade LiCO. The research found that ultrasound can significantly reduce the polymerization of LiCO crystal particles and promote dissociation of impurity ions. At the same time, ultrasound accelerates the nucleation process of LiCO and boosts lithium recovery rate because of cavitation. The different parameters during the LiCO precipitation process were systematically discussed. Under the optimized conditions, the lithium recovery rate can be increased by 12% with a global lithium recovery rate of 97.4%. LiCO with a purity higher than industrial grade can be obtained by one-step precipitation. It demonstrates a potential pathway for effective lithium recovery from low concentrated lithium-containing solution and preparation of industrial grade LiCO.",

        "title": "Application of Bayer Red Mud-Based Flux in the Steelmaking Process",
        "abstract": "Bayer red mud is characterized by its highly oxidizing nature (high Fe2O3 content) and high alkalinity (high Na2O content). It can work as an ideal flux and dephosphorizer in the steelmaking process. In this study, laboratory experiments on the use of Bayer red mud-based flux in hot metal dephosphorization and simulated steelmaking processes have been carried out. In hot metal dephosphorization, good slag fluidity and a much better separation between the slag and the melt phases are obtained while using Bayer red mud. This result is attributed to the fact that Al2O3 and Na2O present in Bayer red mud act as a flux and serve to decrease the melting point of the CaO\u2013FeO\u2013SiO2-based slag. For a mass ratio of Bayer red mud:CaO between 1:1 and 2:1, high hot metal dephosphorization ratios (more than 80%) and low final [P] (lower than 0.018%) are obtained. The experimental results obtained while using Bayer red mud-based flux in simulated steelmaking processes show that good slag fluidity is observed during the entire process. The dephosphorization ratio can be more than 85%, and the final [P] can be lowered to less than 0.005%. No rephosphorization phenomenon is observed in the whole experiment.",

        "abstract": "The present study experimentally investigates the effect of Cr2O3 on the viscosity of molten slags. The viscosities of CaO-SiO2-10 pct Al2O3-Cr2O3 quaternary slags with two different binary basicities (R, basic slag with R = 1.2 and acidic slag with R = 0.8) were measured by the rotating cylindrical method from 1813 K to 1953 K (1540 \u00b0C to 1680 \u00b0C). The results showed that the viscosity of both types of slag decreased as the Cr2O3 content increased, but the viscosity of acidic slags exhibited a greater decrease. The slags showed good Newtonian behavior at such high temperatures. Cr2O3 could act as a network modifier to simplify the Si-O-Si tetrahedral structure, as verified by the Raman spectral analysis, which was consistent with the decreasing trend of viscosity. The activation energy of viscous flow decreased slightly with increasing Cr2O3, but increasing the basicity seemed to be more effective in decreasing the viscosity than adding Cr2O3.",

        "abstract": "To explore the influence of Al2O3/TiO2/Na2O on the mineralogical structure and phosphorus enrichment of converter slag, phosphorus enrichment and distribution in the CaO\u2013SiO2\u2013Fe2O3\u2013MgO\u2013Al2O3/TiO2/Na2O slag system were experimentally examined. The results show that phosphorus mainly exists in an n2CaO\u00b7SiO2\u20133CaO\u00b7P2O5 (nC2S\u2013C3P) solid solution. Al2O3/TiO2/Na2O is beneficial for phosphorus enrichment in the CaO\u2013SiO2\u2013Fe2O3\u2013MgO slag system to various degrees. This allows screening and separation of the enriched phase in the slag. When Al2O3 content was increased from 0 to 15%, the P2O5 content in the P-rich phase increased from 13.88 to 21.32%, and the area of the P-rich phase decreased from 57.50 to 37.87%. When the TiO2 content was increased from 0 to 10%, the content of P2O5 in the P-rich phase increased from 13.88 to 22.90%, and the area of the P-rich phase decreased from 57.50 to 39.20%. When the contents of Al2O3 and TiO2 were increased, the previously formed nC2S\u2013C3P solid solution transformed into n\u2032C2S\u2013C3P (n u003c n\u2032) with higher phosphorus content. Na2O had no significant effect on phosphorus enrichment, but exerted significant influence on the area of the P-rich phase. When the Na2O content was increased from 0 to 8%, the previously formed nC2S\u2013C3P solid solution gradually became Na2Ca4(PO4)2SiO4, and the area of the P-rich phase increased from 57.50 to 68.50%. With increasing the content of ATN (a mixture with a mass ratio of Al2O3/TiO2/Na2O = 15:4:3) from 0 to 30%, the content of P2O5 increased from 13.88 to 42.10% and the area of the P-rich phase decreased from 54.92 to 18.40%.",

        "abstract": "In this study, the effects of different Cr2O3 contents and optical basicity (denoted by \u039b) on the viscosity and structure of the Cr2O3-bearing CaO-SiO2-MgO-Al2O3 slag were investigated. The viscosities of Cr2O3-bearing CaO-SiO2-MgO-Al2O3 slags in the liquid phase below 1823 K (1550 \u00b0C) were measured by rotating-cylinder method, and the structures of the slags were examined via Raman spectroscopy. Three different parameters were used to characterize the structures of the slags. The results showed that the viscosity of the slags increased as the Cr2O3 content increased, but decreased as \u039b increased. The Cr3+ ions acted as network formers and increased the degree of polymerization (DOP), and thus, the addition of Cr2O3 to the slag increased the number of bridging oxygen atoms in the silicate structural units. Generally, the viscosity increased by increasing DOP. In addition, there was a linear inverse relationship between the viscous activation energy (E \u03bc ) and \u039b. Furthermore, as the Cr2O3 content increased, the gradients of the plots of E \u03bc vs \u039b decreased. This indicates that for a slag with a high Cr2O3 content, trying to improve the fluidity of the slag by increasing \u039b has a limited effect.",

Chromium element exists mainly in two parts in the glass ceramics: chromium-containing spinel and soluble chromium in glass matrix. Herein, effect of soluble chromium on the CaO-MgO-SiO 2 -(Na 2 O) glass system is researched. Glass and glass ceramics were characterized by Raman spectrum, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry. It is found that the addition of Cr 2 O 3  increased the Q 2 si structure unit in glass networks, especially in glass systems with high MgO content. The crystallization temperatures of the systems were increased with the addition of Cr 2 O 3 . Soluble chromium reduced the crystallization activation energy of the glass system slightly, but did not alter its crystallization behavior (surface crystallization). With the increase of MgO content, the mineral phases of the glass ceramics gradually changed from wollastonite to diopside. Cr 2 O 3  reduced the lattice parameters of the mineral phases. The addition of Cr 2 O 3  has a significant effect on grain refinement and structural compactness of the glass ceramics system with high MgO content.",

The authors hypothesized that overexpression of (P)RR would be associated with activation of the relevant signal pathway which could lead to organ injury. The aim of the present study was to test the role of cardiac (P)RR and its potential signaling pathway components including phospholipase\u00a0C\u00a0(PLC), protein kinase\u00a0C\u00a0(PKC), extracellular signal\u2011regulated kinase\u00a0(ERK)1/2 and Raf\u20111 proto\u2011oncogene, serine/threonine kinase\u00a0(Raf\u20111). Hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy were induced by partial abdominal aortic ligation in Sprague\u2011Dawley rats. The expression levels of cardiac (P)RR, PLC\u2011\u03b23, PKC, ERK1/2 and Raf\u20111 were measured following administration of the handle region peptide (HRP) and PLC\u2011\u03b23 inhibitor U73122. The expression of (P)RR and PLC\u2011\u03b23 significantly increased in the left ventricle (P<0.05). Levels of PKC\u2011\u03b1, ERK1/2 and Raf\u20111 in the heart rose significantly (P<0.05). HRP and U73122 significantly decreased the levels of cardiac (P)RR and PLC\u2011\u03b23. Furthermore, levels of PKC\u2011\u03b1, ERK1/2 and Raf\u20111 were also decreased (P<0.05). Cardiac parameters, blood pressure and plasma Angiotensin\u00a0(Ang)\u00a0I and Ang\u00a0II levels were altered significantly (P<0.05). The results demonstrated that hypertension induced by aortic restriction activated the (P)RR in the heart. This action led to hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy via the (P)RR\u2011PLC\u2011\u03b23\u2011PKC\u2011ERK1/2\u2011Raf\u20111 signaling pathway. These results provide a mechanism by which elevated (P)RR levels in hypertension may contribute to the development of cardiac remodeling.",

        "abstract": "Objective:  Hydronephrosis is characterized by substantial loss of tubules and affects renin secretion in the kidney. However, whether alterations of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), ACE2 and Mas receptor in the heart are observed in hydronephrosis is unknown. Thus, we assessed these components in hydronephrotic mice treated with AT1 receptor blockade and ACE inhibitor.  Design and Method:  Hydronephrosis was induced by left ureteral ligation in Balb/C mice except sham-operated animals. The levels of cardiac ACE, ACE2 and Mas receptor were measured after treatment of losartan or enalapril.  Results:  Hydronephrosis led to an increase of ACE level and a decreased of ACE2 and Mas receptor in the heart. Losartan decreased cardiac ACE level, but ACE2 and Mas receptor levels significantly increased in hydronephrotic mice (P\u200a  Conclusions:  Hydronephrosis increased cardiac ACE, suppressed ACE2 and Mas receptor levels. AT1 blockade caused sustained activation of cardiac ACE2 and Mas receptor, but ACE inhibitor had the limitation of such activation of Mas receptor in hydronephrotic animals.",

        "abstract": "Inhibiting both type 1 and 2 sodium\u2013glucose linked cotransporter (SGLT1/2) offers the potential to not only increase glucosuria beyond that seen with selective SGLT2 inhibition alone but to reduce glucose absorption from the gut and to thereby also stimulate glucagon-like peptide 1 secretion. However, beyond the kidney and gut, SGLT1 is expressed in a range of other organs particularly the heart where it potentially assists GLUT-mediated glucose transport. Since cardiac myocytes become more reliant on glucose as a fuel source in the setting of stress, the present study sought to compare the effects of dual SGLT1/2 inhibition with selective SGLT2 inhibition in the normal and diseased heart.",

        "abstract": "The NAD-dependent lysine deacetylase, Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), plays a central role in metabolic regulation. With type 1 diabetes a disease that is characterised by metabolic dysregulation, we sought to assess the impact of SIRT1 activation in experimental, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. CD1 mice with and without STZ-induced diabetes were randomized to receive the SIRT1 activating compound, SRT3025, or vehicle over 20 weeks. Vehicle treated STZ-CD1 mice developed severe hyperglycaemia with near-absent circulating insulin and widespread beta cell loss in association with hyperglucagonaemia and expanded islet alpha cell mass. Without affecting \u00df-cell mass or circulating insulin, diabetic mice that received SRT3025 had substantially improved glycaemic control with greatly reduced islet \u03b1 cell mass and lower plasma glucagon concentrations. Consistent with reduced glucagon abundance, the diabetes-associated overexpression of key gluconeogenic enzymes, glucose-6-phosphatase and PEPCK were also lowered by SRT3025. Incubating cultured \u03b1 cells with SRT3025 diminished their glucagon secretion and proliferative activity in association with a reduction in the \u03b1 cell associated transcription factor, Aristaless Related Homeobox (Arx). By reducing the paradoxical increase in glucagon, SIRT1 activation may offer a new, \u03b1-cell centric approach to the treatment of type 1 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "The excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix material in the kidney is a histopathological hallmark of diabetic kidney disease that correlates closely with declining function. Although considerable research has focused on the role of profibrotic factors, comparatively little attention has been paid to the possibility that a diminution in endogenous anti-fibrotic factors may also contribute. Among the latter, the ELR CXC chemokines, CXCL9, 10, and 11, have been shown to provide a 'stop' signal to prevent excessive fibrosis. Although the plasma concentrations of CXCL9 and 11 were similar, those of CXCL10 were markedly lower in diabetic db/db mice when compared with control db/m mice. In cell culture, CXCL10 inhibited kidney fibroblast collagen production in response to high glucose and the prosclerotic growth factor, transforming growth factor-\u00df. In vivo, rmCXCL10 reduced mesangial and peritubular matrix expansion, albuminuria, and glomerular hypertrophy in db/db mice. In bone marrow, a major source of circulating chemokines, the concentration of CXCL10 was lower in cells derived from diabetic mice compared with their non-diabetic counterparts. Silencing of CXCR3, the cognate receptor for CXCL10, abrogated the anti-fibrotic effects of bone marrow-derived secretions. In conclusion, experimental diabetes is a state of CXCL10 deficiency and that restoration of CXCL10 abundance prevented fibrosis and the development of diabetic kidney disease in mice.",

        "abstract": "Most forms of chronic, progressive kidney disease are characterized by fibrosis whereby the prototypical prosclerotic growth factor, transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), is thought to play a pivotal role. With the recent understanding that TGF-\u03b2's canonical signaling pathway may be modified by acetylation as well as phosphorylation, we explored the role of the NAD-dependent lysine deacetylase, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in fibrogenesis in the cell culture, animal model, and human settings. In\u00a0vitro, the increase in collagen production that results from TGF-\u03b21 stimulation was ameliorated by the allosteric modifier of Sirt1 deacetylase, SRT3025, in association with a reduction in Smad3 reporter activity. In the remnant kidney model (subtotally or 5/6 nephrectomized rats) that develops progressive kidney disease in association with TGF-\u03b2 overexpression, administration of SRT3025 attenuated glomerular filtration rate decline and proteinuria without affecting blood pressure. Glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis were similarly reduced with Sirt1 activation as were cardiac structure and function in this rodent model of primary kidney and secondary cardiac disease. Relating these findings to the human setting, we noted a reduction in SIRT1 mRNA in kidney biopsies obtained from individuals with focal glomerulosclerosis. Together these studies highlight the potential of SIRT1 activation as a therapeutic strategy in progressive, fibrotic kidney disease.",

        "abstract": "The regenerative capacity of the embryonic callus, a complex quantitative trait, is one of the main limiting factors for maize transformation. This trait was decomposed into five traits, namely, green callus rate (GCR), callus differentiating rate (CDR), callus plantlet number (CPN), callus rooting rate (CRR), and callus browning rate (CBR). To dissect the genetic foundation of maize transformation, in this study multi-locus genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for the five traits were performed in a population of 144 inbred lines genotyped with 43,427 SNPs. Using the phenotypic values in three environments and best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) values, as a result, a total of 127, 56, 160, and 130 significant quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) were identified by mrMLM, FASTmrEMMA, ISIS EM-BLASSO, and pLARmEB, respectively. Of these QTNs, 63 QTNs were commonly detected, including 15 across multiple environments and 58 across multiple methods. Allele distribution analysis showed that the proportion of superior alleles for 36 QTNs was <50% in 31 elite inbred lines. Meanwhile, these superior alleles had obviously additive effect on the regenerative capacity. This indicates that the regenerative capacity-related traits can be improved by proper integration of the superior alleles using marker-assisted selection. Moreover, a total of 40 candidate genes were found based on these common QTNs. Some annotated genes were previously reported to relate with auxin transport, cell fate, seed germination, or embryo development, especially, GRMZM2G108933 () was found to promote maize transgenic embryonic callus regeneration. These identified candidate genes will contribute to a further understanding of the genetic foundation of maize embryonic callus regeneration.",

        "abstract": "Stalk lodging resistance, which is mainly measured by stem diameter (SD), stalk bending strength (SBS), and rind penetrometer resistance (RPR) in maize, seriously affects the yield and quality of maize ( L.). To dissect its genetic architecture, in this study multi-locus genome-wide association studies for stalk lodging resistance-related traits were conducted in a population of 257 inbred lines, with tropical, subtropical, and temperate backgrounds, genotyped with 48,193 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms. The analyses of phenotypic variations for the above traits in three environments showed high broad-sense heritability (0.679, 0.720, and 0.854, respectively). In total, 423 significant Quantitative Trait Nucleotides (QTNs) were identified by mrMLM, FASTmrEMMA, ISIS EM-BLASSO, and pLARmEB methods to be associated with the above traits. Among these QTNs, 29, 34, and 48 were commonly detected by multiple methods or across multiple environments to be related to SD, SBS, and RPR, respectively. The superior allele analyses in 30 elite lines showed that only eight lines contained more than 50% of the superior alleles, indicating that stalk lodging resistance can be improved by the integration of more superior alleles. Among sixty-three candidate genes of the consistently expressed QTNs, GRMZM5G856734 and GRMZM2G116885, encoding membrane steroid-binding protein 1 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1, respectively, possibly inhibit cell elongation and division, which regulates lodging resistance. Our results provide the further understanding of the genetic foundation of maize lodging resistance.",

        "abstract": "The low ratio of embryonic callus (EC) induction has inhibited the rapid development of maize genetic engineering. Still, little is known to explain the genotype-dependence of EC induction. Here, we performed a large-scale, quantitative analysis of the maize EC metabolome and proteome at three typical induction stages in two inbred lines with a range of EC induction capabilities. Comparison of the metabolomes and proteomes suggests that the differential molecular responses begin at an early stage of development and continue throughout the process of EC formation. The two inbred lines show different responses under various conditions, such as metal ion binding, cell enlargement, stem cell formation, meristematic activity maintenance, somatic embryogenesis, cell wall synthesis, and hormone signal transduction. Furthermore, the differences in hormone (auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, brassinosteroid and ethylene) synthesis and transduction ability could partially explain the higher EC induction ratio in the inbred line 18-599R. During EC formation, repression of the \u201chistone deacetylase 2 and ERF transcription factors\u201d complex in 18-599R activated the expression of downstream genes, which further promoted EC induction. Together, our data provide new insights into the molecular regulatory mechanism responsible for efficient EC induction in maize.",

        "abstract": "Stalk lodging severely limits the grain yield of maize (Zea mays L.). Mechanical stalk strength can be reflected by the traits of stalk diameter (SD), stalk bending strength (SBS), and lodging rind penetrometer resistance (RPR). To determine the genetic basis of maize stalk lodging, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were mapped for these three traits using the IBM Syn10 DH population in three environments. The results indicated that there were strong genetic correlations among the three traits, and the analyses of phenotypic variations for SD, SBS, and RPR across the three environments showed high broad-sense heritability (0.6843, 0.5175, and 0.7379, respectively). In total, 44 significant QTLs were identified control the above traits across the 3 environments. A total of 14, 14, and 16 QTLs were identified for SD, SBS, and RPR across single-environment mapping, respectively. Notably, ten QTLs were stably expressed across multiple-environments, including two QTLs for SD, three for SBS, and five for RPR. Three major QTLs each accounting for over 10% of the phenotypic variation were qSD6-2 (10.03%), qSD8-2 (13.73%), and qSBS1-2 (11.89%). Comprehensive analysis of all QTLs in this study revealed that 5 QTL clusters including 12 QTLs were located on chromosomes 1, 3, 7, and 8, respectively. Among these 44 QTLs, 9 harbored 13 stalk lodging-associated SNPs that were detected by our recently published work, with 1 SNP successfully validated in the IBM Syn10 DH population. These chromosomal regions will be useful for marker-assisted selection and fine mapping of stalk lodging-related traits in maize.",

        "abstract": "Kernel size-related traits are the most direct traits correlating with grain yield. The genetic basis of three kernel traits of maize, kernel length (KL), kernel width (KW), and kernel thickness (KT) were investigated in an association panel and a bi-parental population. A total of 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected to be most significantly (P < 2.25 \u00d7 10 ) associated with these three traits in the association panel under four environments. Furthermore, 50 quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling these traits were detected in seven environments in the intermated B73 \u00d7 Mo17 (IBM) Syn10 doubled haploid (DH) population, of which eight were repetitively identified in at least three environments. Combining the two mapping populations revealed that 56 SNPs (P < 1 \u00d7 10 ) fell within 18 of the QTL confidence intervals. According to the top-significance SNPs, stable-effect SNPs, and the co-localized SNPs by association analysis and linkage mapping, a total of 73 candidate genes were identified regulating seed development. Additionally, seven miRNAs were found to situate within the linkage disequilibrium (LD) regions of the co-localized SNPs, of which zma-miR164e was demonstrated to cleave the mRNAs of Arabidopsis CUC1, CUC2, and NAC6 in vitro. Overexpression of zma-miR164e resulted in the downregulation of these genes above and the failure of seed formation in Arabidopsis pods, with the increased branch number. These findings provide insights into the mechanism of seed development and the improvement of molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) for high-yield breeding in maize.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Ultrafine-grained Ti\u20136Al\u20134V alloy with high mechanical properties in both strength and elongation was prepared by equal channel angular pressing and following pulsed electric current treatment. The mechanical properties of Ti\u20136Al\u20134V alloy were investigated by tensile tests at room temperature. Elongation of the samples treated by pulsed electric current and annealing was considerably increased by 66.5% and 20.8%, respectively. The plasticity of ECAP deformed Ti\u20136Al\u20134V alloy was significantly improved by pulsed electric current while the strength still remained relatively high. Comparing with conventional equal channel angular pressing and following annealing process, uniform fully recrystallization microstructure with fine grains, increasing proportion of beta phase and decreasing dislocation density was obtained at a relatively low temperature during a short time with the help of pulsed electric current. This study proves that the pulsed electric current provoked a fast recrystallization and phase transformation process of a titanium alloy produced by equal channel angular pressing.",

In this work, Shearing tests of Ti-6Al-4V alloy were conducted using hat-shaped specimens under pulsed current (electroplastic shearing) and constant temperature (isothermal shearing). The actual deformation in shear zone of electroplastic shearing was larger than that of isothermal shearing. The shear load is also decreased by the pulsed current. Microstructure variation in the shear zone was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. An evident straight shear band was observed in the electroplastic shearing specimens. The deformation model of shear zone was established. Intracrystalline deformation was markedly easier for the grains with the pulsed current and induced larger deformation of the grains along the shear direction. Microcracks were observed in the shear zone of isothermal shearing, but none were found in the shear zone of electroplastic shearing. Evident crack healing was found in the crack tip of the shear zone of electroplastic shearing.",

Isothermal compression at equivalent temperatures was also performed on a universal testing machine with furnace, with the same strain rate. Results show that the deformability of Ti\u20136Al\u20134V alloy can be significantly improved by high-energy electro-pulses, and the deformation resistance and yield stress were also decreased. Moreover, the effect of high-energy electropulses on compression mechanical properties of Ti\u20136Al\u20134V alloy increased with increasing discharge voltage. However, elongation and deformation resistance of compressions with high-energy electro-pulses were higher than isothermal compressions at equivalent temperatures. This result proved that the deformability improvement of Ti\u20136Al\u20134V alloy by high-energy electro-pulses results from the joint effects of temperature and electro-plasticity. Fracture modes in different experimental conditions were analyzed by observing the fracture morphologies of specimens by using a scanning electron microscope. Under high-energy electro-pulses, the micro morphology of compression fracture changes from elongated oval to equiaxed dimples, and the fracture modes transfer from intergranular to transgranular fracture.",

The electroplastic compression (EC) of Ti-6Al-4V alloy was performed with discharge voltages of 50 and 70\u00a0V and strain rates of 0.01 and 0.03\u00a0s\u22121, respectively. The results show that the mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V alloy greatly change under the influence of the high-energy pulse current. Metallographic examination and x-ray diffraction are performed to observe the microstructural evolution of the alloy. An obvious dynamic globularization occurs at the later stage of the EC process even though the temperature of the samples is relatively low. An \u03b1\u2013\u03b2 phase change also occurs during the EC process. The microstructural evolution of Ti-6Al-4V alloy during the EC process is mainly attributed to the thermal and athermal effects of electropulsing, which promotes the dislocation motion and nucleation rate of dynamic globularization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Through electroless plating, the Al 0.3 CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloys were successfully coated with the Ni-P amorphous film with a thickness of 1.2\u202f\u03bcm. For studying the surface change of samples after chemical plating, the surface morphologies of the as-cast HEA substrate and HEA with the Ni-P film were contrasted by atomic-force microscopy. The tensile properties of the samples with and without the Ni-P film, and the deformational behavior of thin Ni-P film were researched, respectively. In addition, the effect of the Ni-P amorphous film on corrosion resistance of the coated HEAs was also investigated. The experimental results show that in contrast to the uncoated samples with a yielding strength of 275\u202fMPa, the yielding strength of the coated samples exhibits 400\u202fMPa, with a 45% improvement, which can be attributed to the very high yield strength of the Ni-P amorphous film. A tensile strain up to 10% was achieved in the Ni-P film since the propagation of one primary shear band was inhibited, and the stress/strain concentration was retarded by the plastic substrate. The corrosion resistance of the HEA with the Ni-P film is superior to that of the bare HEA in the 3.5\u202fwt percent NaCl solutions due to the chemical homogeneity and the absence of microscopic defects in the Ni-P amorphous film. The current results indicate that the surface coating is an effective means for optimizing the properties of HEAs, and the thin Ni-P coating can remarkably improve the strength of the present HEAs.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the therapeutic effect of conversion therapy and its correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in unresectable rectal cancer with liver metastasis. A total of 116 cases of unresectable rectal cancer patients with liver metastasis were randomly divided into control and observation group, 58 cases in each group, all of these patients were treated by conversion therapy, patients in control were treated by FOLFOXIRI treatment program, and in observation group were treated by FOLFOXIRI program treatment and bevacizumab. Efficacy and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups, the levels of VEGF in portal vein and the expression of VEGF in cancer tissue were compared, after 5 years of follow-up, the prognosis of the two groups were observed. Objective efficiency and conversion rate of observation was significantly higher than the control group, survival rate of postoperative observation was significantly higher than that of control group (P>0.05). There was no significant difference in adverse reactions between the two groups (P>0.05). The positive rate of VEGF in portal vein blood and the expression of VEGF in the observation was significantly lower than that in the control group (P<0.05). The 5-year survival rate of VEGF high expression was significantly lower than that of VEGF low expression group (P<0.05). FOLFOXIRI combined with bevacizumab in patients with unresectable hepatic metastasis of rectal cancer can provide higher conversion rate and hepatectomy opportunities, and reduce VEGF expression in patients with unresectable rectal cancer, which is closely related to VEGF expression, therefore it is beneficial to better local control and to improve long-term survival.",

        "abstract": "We synthesized a pH-responsive conjugate of 10-hydroxycamptothecin-thiosemicarbazide-linear polyethylene glycol 2000 (PEG2000). The conjugate was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry, H NMR, and C NMR. The water solubility of the prodrug was increased by over 3,000 times; much longer body circulation time, higher tumor-targeting ability, and reduced toxicity were observed, compared with commercial 10-HCPT injection. The linker contains a pH-sensitive hydrazone bond, which breaks under low pH conditions in the tumor microenvironment. The conjugates showed good stability in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and rat plasma. This amphiphilic conjugate could self-assemble into nanosized micelles of 80-100 nm. Cytotoxicity assay results indicate significantly higher efficacy of the conjugate (IC [half maximal inhibitory concentration] =0.117 \u00b5M on SW180 cells) than 10-HCPT solution (IC =0.241 \u00b5M on SW480 cells). Cellular uptake analysis suggested its rapid internalization and nuclear transport. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the conjugates demonstrated that the conjugate circulated for a longer time in the blood circulation system ( =10.516\u00b11.158 h) than did 10-HCPT solution ( =1.859\u00b11.385 h), and that it also enhanced the targeting and mean residence time (MRT =39.873\u00b14.549 h) in the tumor site, compared with 10-HCPT (MRT =9.247\u00b11.026 h). Finally, the conjugate demonstrated an increased tumor growth inhibition effect (TIR =82.66%\u00b17.175%) in vivo and lower side effects than 10-HCPT (TIR =63.85%\u00b15.233%). This prodrug holds great promise in improving therapeutic efficacy and overcoming multidrug resistance.",

        "abstract": "Tumor hypoxia is a significant factor leading to the resistance of tumors to treatments, especially for photodynamic therapy and radiotherapy where oxygen is needed to kill cancer cells. Oxygen delivery agents such as oxygen-saturated perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions or lipid oxygen microbubbles have been employed to supply oxygen to the hypoxic tumors with the ultrasound activation. Such oxygen delivery systems are still associated with several drawbacks including premature oxygen release and the dependence of external stimuli. To address these limitations, we developed oxygen nanobubbles that were enclosed by the acetalated dextran polymer shells for spontaneous oxygeneration in response to a minor pH drop in the tumor microenvironment. The acetalated dextran polymer shell serves as a robust barrier against gas dissolution in the blood circulation to retain the majority of oxygen payload, and its pH-responsive property enables abrupt burst release of oxygen in the mild acidic tumor microenvironment. The acetalated dextran oxygen nanobubbles exhibited excellent stability and biocompatibility. In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to investigate the pH-responsive oxygen release. The external stimuli-free supply of oxygen by the acetalated dextran oxygen nanobubbles was evaluated on CNE2 tumor-bearing mice and the intratumoral oxygen level increased by six folds after the administration of the oxygen nanobubbles, manifesting that our pH-responsive oxygen nanobubbles hold great potential as a potent oxygen delivery agent to overcome the hypoxia-induced resistance.",

        "abstract": "Canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels are widely expressed throughout the nervous system whereas their functions remain largely unclear. Here we investigated the effects of TRPC1 deletion on spatial memory ability of mice and the potential intervention by environmental enrichment (EE). Significant spatial memory impairment assessed by conditional fearing test, Y maze test and step-down test in TRPC1 knockout mice was revealed. The behavioral abnormality were attenuated by the treatment of EE. Proteomic analysis by two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS) revealed that TRPC1 deletion caused differential expression of a total of 10 proteins (8 up-regulated and 2 down-regulated) in hippocampus. EE treatment resulted in differential expression of a total of 22 proteins (2 up-regulated and 20 down-regulated) in hippocampus of TRPC1 knockout mice. Among these differentially expressed proteins, the expression of \u03b1-internexin and glia maturation factor \u03b2 (GMF-\u03b2), two proteins shown to impair memory, were significantly down-regulated in hippocampus of TRPC1 knockout mice by EE treatment. Taken together, these data suggested that TRPC1 regulated directly or indirectly the expression of multiple proteins, which may be crucial for the maintenance of memory ability, and that EE treatment modulated spatial memory impairment caused by TRPC1 depletion and the mechanisms may involve the modulation of EE on the expression of those dys-regulated proteins such as \u03b1-internexin and GMF-\u03b2 in hippocampus.

        "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain largely unclear. In the present study, we were aimed to identify the potential key molecules involved in spatial memory impairment in a triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mouse model of AD. By employing two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with mass spectrometry, we revealed a total of 24 differentially expressed proteins in hippocampus of 9-month-old 3xTg-AD mice with significant spatial memory impairment in comparison to the age-matched controls. These differentially expressed proteins can be categorized into several functional classifications that are related to synaptic/memory-, energy metabolism-, intracellular transport-, cell cycle-, cellular defense and structure, and stress response. To further verify the target proteins that may underlie the memory deficits, we pre-treated the 3xTg-AD mice for 3\u00a0months with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) (800\u00a0mg/kg body weight/day), a powerful endogenous antioxidant that has been shown to be able to prevent memory deficits in several AD mouse models. We found that administration of CoQ10 altered the expression levels of nine proteins in hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice with simultaneous improvement of spatial memory. Interestingly, complexin-1/2, two molecules which were shown to alter LTP, were modulated (i.e., the levels were reduced in 3xTg-AD mice and CoQ10 restored the levels) in response to CoQ10 treatment among these nine proteins. Furthermore, we found that adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV-9)-mediated overexpression of complexin-1/2 prevented memory impairment in the AD mouse model. Taken together, this study has identified a number of differentially expressed proteins in hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice and the control in presence or absence of CoQ10. The modulation of complexin-1/2 expression by CoQ10 may contribute to the amelioration of memory impairment in the AD transgenic mice.",

        "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is a highly common cancer among men but lacks robust diagnostics that can predict disease recurrence after initial treatment, for example, with radical prostatectomy. Recent advances in genomics and next-generation sequencing heralded the discovery of biomarkers such as the androgen receptor gene () splice events, the  gene fusion, long noncoding RNA  and  for PCa prognosis. Still, the question of why some patients experience recurrence, whereas others do not introduce marked uncertainty for both patients and physicians. We report here the whole exome sequencing of 30 recurrent and 44 nonrecurrent PCa patients. We identified 72 and 34 specific somatic single nucleotide variations in the recurrent and the nonrecurrent group, respectively, and developed a classification model to forecast PCa recurrence using a random forest model. The model displayed a sensitivity and specificity of 87.8% and 94.4%, respectively, for identifying the patients with recurrent PCa. These observations warrant further research in independent and larger clinical samples so as to inform future diagnostics innovation for PCa prognosis and recurrence.",

        "abstract": "Prostate cancer predisposition has been extensively investigated in European populations, but there have been few studies of other ethnic groups. To investigate prostate cancer susceptibility in the under-investigated Chinese population, we performed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis on a cohort of Chinese cases and controls and then meta-analysis with data from the existing Chinese prostate cancer genome-wide association study (GWAS). Genotyping 211,155 SNPs in 495 cases and 640 controls of Chinese ancestry identified several new suggestive Chinese prostate cancer predisposition loci. However, none of them reached genome-wide significance level either by meta-analysis or replication study. The meta-analysis with the Chinese GWAS data revealed that four 8q24 loci are the main contributors to Chinese prostate cancer risk and the risk alleles from three of them exist at much higher frequencies in Chinese than European populations. We also found that several predisposition loci reported in Western populations have different effect on Chinese men. Therefore, this first extensive single-nucleotide polymorphism study of Chinese prostate cancer in comparison with European population indicates that four loci on 8q24 contribute to a great risk of prostate cancer in a considerable large proportion of Chinese men. Based on those four loci, the top 10% of the population have six- or two-fold prostate cancer risk compared with men of the bottom 10% or median risk respectively, which may facilitate the design of prostate cancer genetic risk screening and prevention in Chinese men. These findings also provide additional insights into the etiology and pathogenesis of prostate cancer.",

Overexpression of VEGFR-2 increases the growth of nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC). Apatinib (YN968D1) is a highly-selective inhibitor of VEGFR-2, but its effects on NPC have not been hitherto investigated. In the present study, CNE-2 NPC cells were xenografted into 132 nude mice, which were treated with one of 6 drug regimens of apatinib administered alone or in combination with cisplatin (DDP). The impact of treatment regimens on the growth, microvascularization, apoptosis, and metabolic response of tumors, as well as mouse survival was determined by histopathology, immunohistochemistry (VEGFR-2 and CD31), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL), micro 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging and survival curves. Administration of apatinib alone inhibited tumor growth, reduced microvascular density, and facilitated the apoptosis of tumors. Tumors treated simultaneously with apatinib and cisplatin exhibited significantly-increased inhibition of tumor growth, prolonged survival time, decreased expression of VEGFR-2, reduced microvascular density, and frequency of apoptosis over standalone and sequential administration therapy. Tumors treated simultaneously with apatinib and cisplatin had the lowest uptake of FDG. Taken together, the simultaneous administration of apatinib and cisplatin improves the therapeutic efficacy over standalone treatments, which also led to improved efficacy over sequential administration regimens. VEGFR-2 is an important predictive marker for efficacy of apatinib treatment of NPC.",

Mitochondria can be damaged due to stress, for example by reactive oxygen species (ROS). TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) serves a role in suppressing ROS damage and may protect mitochondria integrity. In the present study, the localization of TIGAR on mitochondria in 5-8F cells was demonstrated. Furthermore, it was indicated that the knockdown of TIGAR using lentivirus-short hairpin RNA induces the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c leakage. However, these damaged mitochondria were not degraded in cells, but exhibited an abnormal appearance as indicated by mitochondrial swelling, crista collapse and vacuolization, with physiological dysfunction marked by reduced ATP production. Therefore, TIGAR maybe an indispensable protein for mitochondrial protection and degradation following cellular damage.",

        "title": "Targeting the cMET pathway augments radiation response without adverse effect on hearing in NF2 schwannoma models.",
        "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) is a disease that needs new solutions. Vestibular schwannoma (VS) growth causes progressive hearing loss, and the standard treatment, including surgery and radiotherapy, can further damage the nerve. There is an urgent need to identify an adjunct therapy that, by enhancing the efficacy of radiation, can help lower the radiation dose and preserve hearing. The mechanisms underlying deafness in NF2 are still unclear. One of the major limitations in studying tumor-induced hearing loss is the lack of mouse models that allow hearing testing. Here, we developed a cerebellopontine angle (CPA) schwannoma model that faithfully recapitulates the tumor-induced hearing loss. Using this model, we discovered that cMET blockade by crizotinib (CRZ) enhanced schwannoma radiosensitivity by enhancing DNA damage, and CRZ treatment combined with low-dose radiation was as effective as high-dose radiation. CRZ treatment had no adverse effect on hearing; however, it did not affect tumor-induced hearing loss, presumably because cMET blockade did not change tumor hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) levels. This cMET gene knockdown study independently confirmed the role of the cMET pathway in mediating the effect of CRZ. Furthermore, we evaluated the translational potential of cMET blockade in human schwannomas. We found that human NF2-associated and sporadic VSs showed significantly elevated HGF expression and cMET activation compared with normal nerves, which correlated with tumor growth and cyst formation. Using organoid brain slice culture, cMET blockade inhibited the growth of patient-derived schwannomas. Our findings provide the rationale and necessary data for the clinical translation of combined cMET blockade with radiation therapy in patients with NF2.",

We sought to enhance drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy by remodeling the dense extracellular matrix in two orthotopic human ovarian carcinoma xenograft models.

We report here four translatable findings: () losartan treatment enhances the efficacy of paclitaxel-a drug used for ovarian cancer treatment-via normalizing the tumor microenvironment, resulting in improved vessel perfusion and drug delivery; () losartan depletes matrix via inducing antifibrotic miRNAs that should be tested as candidate biomarkers of response or resistance to chemotherapy; () although losartan therapy alone does not reduce tumor burden, it reduces both the incidence and the amount of ascites formed; and () our retrospective analysis revealed that patients receiving angiotensin system inhibitors concurrently with standard treatment for ovarian cancer exhibited 30 mo longer overall survival compared with patients on other antihypertensives.

        "abstract": "Intrauterine adhesion (IUA) is characterized by endometrial fibrosis, which ultimately leads to menstrual abnormalities, infertility and recurrent miscarriages. The Shh/Gli2 pathway plays a critical role in tissue fibrogenesis and regeneration; Gli2 activation induces profibrogenic effects in various tissues, such as the liver and kidney. However, the role of Gli2 in endometrial fibrosis remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that activated Gli2 promotes endometrial fibrosis. Endometrial samples from moderate and severe IUA patients exhibited significantly enhanced expression of Gli2 compared with normal endometrial samples and mild IUA samples. Transfection with overactive Gli2 plasmids induced higher fibrosis-related protein expression, while blocking Gli2 signaling with cyclopamine caused the opposite effect in ESCs, including inducing cell-cycle arrest. Menstrual-derived stem cell conditioned medium (MenSCs-CM) reduced endometrial fibrosis by reducing Gli2 protein levels and causing cell-cycle arrest in ESCs through G-CSF. The effect was weakened after neutralization with a G-CSF antibody. Gli2 overexpression reduced the effects of MenSC-CM and G-CSF on fibrosis and cell-cycle progression in vitro. The antifibrotic effect of G-CSF was also observed in murine model. These findings demonstrate that Gli2 signaling promotes endometrial fibrosis, and the inhibition of Gli2 through MenSCs-secreted G-CSF may be of therapeutic value for managing endometrial fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "Intrauterine adhesions are common acquired endometrial syndromes secondary to endometrial injury, with limited effective therapies. Recently, several studies have reported that bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) could repair injured endometrium in animal experiments. However, the role of stem cells in endometrial injury repair and its therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we established mouse endometrial injury model and examined the benefit of human endometrial mesenchymal stem cells derived from menstrual blood (MenSCs) in restoration of injured endometrium. Injured endometrium exhibited significantly accelerated restoration at Day 7 after MenSCs transplantation, with increased endometrial thickness and microvessel density. Moreover, the fertility of mice with injured endometrium was improved, with higher conception rate (53.57% vs 14.29%, P\u2009=\u20090.014) and larger embryo number (3.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 vs 0.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7, P\u2009=\u20090.030) in MenSCs group than control group, while no difference was found in undamaged horns between two groups. Conditioned medium from MenSCs (MenSCs-CM) could decrease H2O2-induced apoptosis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and promote proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. Angiogenesis effect of MenSCs-CM was also confirmed in Matrigel plug assay in mice. Furthermore, we discovered that MenSCs-CM could activate AKT and ERK pathways and induce the overexpression of eNOS, VEGFA, VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and TIE2 in HUVECs, which are critical in MenSCs-CM-induced angiogenesis. Angiogenesis induced by MenSCs-CM could be reversed by inhibitors of AKT and/or ERK. Taken together, we concluded that MenSCs could restore injured endometrium and improve the fertility of the endometrial injury mice, which was partially attributed to angiogenesis induced by MenSCs.",

        "abstract": "In women of reproductive age, severe injuries to the endometrium are often accompanied by endometrial scar formation or intrauterine adhesions (IUAs), which can result in infertility or miscarriage. Although many approaches have been used to treat severe IUAs, high recurrence rates and endometrial thinning have limited therapeutic efficiency. In this study, a collagen scaffold (CS) loaded with human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) was fabricated and applied for endometrial regeneration. The CS/UC-MSCs promoted human endometrial stromal cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in vitro through paracrine effects. In a model of endometrial damage, transplantation with the CS/UC-MSCs maintained normal luminal structure, promoted endometrial regeneration and collagen remodeling, induced intrinsic endometrial cell proliferation and epithelium recovery, and enhanced the expression of estrogen receptor \u03b1 and progesterone receptor. An improved ability of the regenerated endometrium to receive embryos was confirmed. Together, our results indicate that the CS/UC-MSCs promoted endometrial structural reconstruction and functional recovery. Topical administration of the CS/UC-MSCs after trans-cervical resection of adhesions might prevent re-adhesion, promote endometrium regeneration and improve pregnancy outcomes for patients with severe IUAs. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Intrauterine adhesions due to severe endometrium injuries happen frequently in clinic and become one of the crucial reasons for women's infertility or miscarriage. Therefore, how to regenerate the damaged endometrium is a big challenge. In this study, a collagen scaffold (CS) loaded with human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) was fabricated and applied for endometrium regeneration. Herein, UC-MSCs, known for low immunogenicity and high proliferative potential, exhibit promising potential for endometrium regeneration; and collagen scaffolds provide suitable physical support. It was proved that transplantation with CS/UC-MSCs promoted endometrial regeneration and fertility restoration. It suggested that topical administration of CS/UC-MSCs in uterus could be a promising strategy for patients suffering severe intrauterine adhesion and infertility.",

Furthermore, we constructed a mutant adeno-associated viral vector AAV8 (Y733F) that produced stable and high efficient Ang-(1-7) expression in a xenograft tumor model. The results show that AAV8-mediated Ang-(1-7) over-expression can remarkably suppress tumor growth in vivo by down-regulating Cdc6 and anti-angiogenesis.

        "abstract": " Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] has been identified to inhibit the growth of many types of tumor cells both  and . However, the rapid degradation of Ang-(1-7)  limits its clinical application. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype-8 is a remarkable vector for long-term  gene delivery.  This study was designed to investigate the effects of AAV-mediated Ang-(1-7) overexpression on hepatocellular carcinoma. We first generated three different tyrosine (Y) to phenylalanine (F) mutants of AAV8 (Y447F, Y703F, Y708F) and evaluated their  transduction efficiencies.  The data indicated that the Y703F mutant elicited a significant enhancement of liver gene delivery when compared with wild-type AAV8 (wtAAV8). The anti-tumor effect of Ang-(1-7) mediated by this optimized vector was evaluated in H22 hepatoma-bearing mice. Our results demonstrated that AAV-Ang-(1-7) persistently inhibited the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by significantly downregulating angiogenesis. This was confirmed by observed decreases in the levels of the proangiogenic factors VEGF and PIGF.  Collectively, these data suggest that Ang-(1-7) overexpression mediated by the optimized vector may be an effective alternative for hepatocellular carcinoma therapy due to its long-term and significant anti-tumor activity.",

In this study, novel antibacterial N-halamine-containing polymer fibers were synthesized via an one-step electrospinning of N-halamine-containing polymers without any additives. By adjusting the concentration of precursor and the molecular weight of polymers, the morphology and size of the as-spun N-halamine-containing fibers can be regulated. The as-spun fibers showed antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. After an antibacterial assessment using different biochemical techniques, a combined mechanism of contact/release co-determined killing action was evidenced for the as-spun N-halamine-containing fibers. With the aid of contact action and/or release action, this combined mechanism can allow N-halamines to attack bacteria, making the as-spun fibers wide in the application of antibacterial fields, whatever it is in dry or wet environment. Also, a recycle antibacterial test demonstrated that the as-spun fibers can still offer antibacterial property after five recycle experiments.",

Optimizing the process conditions, e.g., comonomer molar ratio, concentration of electrospinning solution, chlorination order, and chlorination period, resulted in the formation of N-halamine fibers with controllable morphology. N-Halamine polymers were tested against two common bacterial pathogens, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, and were found to be extremely potent against both bacteria, suggesting that they possess powerful sterilizing properties.

When the surfactant was used, the leaching efficiency was improved, the leaching amount of vanadium increased from 390 to 540\u00a0ppm at 303\u00a0K. The surface physical chemical properties of the leaching solution, such as the conductivity, the surface tension, contact angle, and zeta potential were studied before and after the surfactant is added. The zeta potential increased from \u201320 to 40\u00a0mV, when the surfactant was used from 0 to 700\u00a0mg/L, and the surface tension and contact angle decreased significantly first, then remained constant; the interface energy increased. All the change of physical chemical properties enhanced wetting capability and combination adhesion. And this improved the leaching efficiency.",

Graphene was used as the appropriate carrier to load CoO/Co 3 O 4  nanoparticles because of its high surface area. The CoO/Co 3 O 4 /graphene nanocomposites were then tested as anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Results showed that the nanocomposites led to high capacity, delivering initial discharge\u2013charge capacities of 1093.4 and 825.3\u00a0mAh\u00b7g \u22121 , with an initial coulombic efficiency of 75.5%. The nanocomposite electrode showed excellent rate capability and impressive cyclability, as well as a high reversible capacity of 695.4\u00a0mAh\u00b7g \u22121  after 70 cycles at a discharge\u2013charge current density of 0.5\u00a0C (1\u00a0C\u00a0=\u00a0890\u00a0mA\u00a0g \u22121 ). The excellent electrochemical performance was ascribed to the CoO nanoparticles and graphene. By contrast, pristine Co 3 O 4  can maintain only 339.7\u00a0mAh\u00b7g \u22121  after 70 cycles, indicating very poor cycling performance because of the huge volume change during cycling. These results revealed that the nanocomposites were excellent anode material for LIBs.",

The composites were composed of amorphous carbon and nanocrystalline NiO. The structure of the NiO crystals was determined with X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and the content of carbon was calculated from the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) results. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed a relatively narrow distribution of particle size for both the neat NiO and NiO/C nanoparticles. Electrochemical performance measurements demonstrated that, after 50 cycles, NiO/C nanocomposites maintained a high reversible capacity of 585.9\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121 , much higher than that of 356.1\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  of the neat NiO nanoparticles without carbon. The NiO/C nanoparticles also exhibited a remarkable discharge capacity, a high charge/discharge rate and an excellent cycle stability. The improvements can be attributed to the even carbon coating on the NiO particles, which significantly enhances the conductivity and improves the structural stability of the electrode.",

However, current researches just care about the feature extraction and classifier design, and do not consider the instance selection. Former research by authors showed that the instance selection can lead to improvement on classification accuracy. However, no attention is paid on the relationship between speech sample and feature until now. Therefore, a new diagnosis algorithm of PD is proposed in this paper by simultaneously selecting speech sample and feature based on relevant feature weighting algorithm and multiple kernel method, so as to find their synergy effects, thereby improving classification accuracy. Experimental results showed that this proposed algorithm obtained apparent improvement on classification accuracy. It can obtain mean classification accuracy of 82.5%, which was 30.5% higher than the relevant algorithm. Besides, the proposed algorithm detected the synergy effects of speech sample and feature, which is valuable for speech marker extraction.",

        "abstract": "The in vitro skin penetration of pharmaceutical or cosmetic ingredients is usually assessed in human or animal tissue. However, there are ethical and practical difficulties associated with sourcing these materials; variability between donors may also be problematic when interpreting experimental data. Hence, there has been much interest in identifying a robust and high throughput model to study skin permeation that would generate more reproducible results. Here we investigate the permeability of a model active, niacinamide (NIA), in (i) conventional vertical Franz diffusion cells with excised human skin or porcine skin and (ii) a recently developed Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeation Assay (PAMPA) model. Both finite and infinite dose conditions were evaluated in both models using a series of simple NIA solutions and one commercial preparation. The Franz diffusion cell studies were run over 24 h while PAMPA experiments were conducted for 2.5 h. A linear correlation between both models was observed for the cumulative amount of NIA permeated in tested models under finite dose conditions. The corresponding correlation coefficients (r) were 0.88 for porcine skin and 0.71 for human skin. These results confirm the potential of the PAMPA model as a useful screening tool for topical formulations. Future studies will build on these findings and expand further the range of actives investigated.",

The identification and comparison of fertilizer properties were demonstrated. Experimental results showed that the effect of temperature on the solubility of metallic nutrients was more significant than that of non-metallic nutrients. Coarse calculation showed that there is a great potential in balancing nutrients for farmland via recycling ash from corn-stover pellets burnt at low temperature. The method and the result provide a reference for applications of ash as fertilizer.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Returning of biomass ash as fertilizer to field plays great role in sustainable utilization of biomass as energy. In the fertilizer application, release rate of nutrients from ash should be controlled to avoid nutrients shock to plants. Making ash into briquettes (granulated ash, pellet, tablet) is a good choice to slow down the release rate of nutrients and prevent dust formation. However, experimental or theoretical analysis of the release behavior of nutrient from ash briquette is scarce. In this paper, different sizes (from \u04246 mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0mm to \u042415\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0mm) of tablets of biomass ash were made and their nutrient release behavior was investigated experimentally. Results showed that the release rate of potassium in tablet ash was about 1/20-1/60 of that in the powder ash. And that changing tablet size in the normal size range could not decrease the nutrient release rate to the value required by the norm for slow-release fertilizer. Based on the experiments, the mathematical description of the nutrients release process was established and a Matlab code was written for modelling. The theoretical model was validated and parameters required to make slow release fertilizer from the ash were predicted. It showed that, in order to produce slow release potassic fertilizer, much bigger tablet size (from \u042415\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0mm to \u0424210\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a070\u00a0mm), much lower saturated concentration (from 0.17 to 0.17/14 2 \u00a0kg/kg water for potassium), or much smaller effective diffusion coefficient (from 3.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u221210  to 1.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u221212 ) are necessary. The theoretical model can be generalized to describe the release behavior of any nutrient and can be used in the parameters optimization for producing slow/control-release fertilizer.",

The combustion processes of the solid phase were calculated using a self-written MATLAB code, and the processes of the extra-pellet fluid environment were calculated using the commercial CFD code. The two codes were coupled together by exchanging the data of source terms and boundary conditions in real-time. Experiments on combustion of a single corn-stover pellet in a tube furnace were implemented to validate the calculation method and acceptable agreements were obtained, and the main errors are within 10%. The heterogeneous-dimension discretization method made the updating and debugging of the physical and chemical mechanism of the solid phase very easy. Compared with constant environment conditions, the average error of coupling calculation method is decreased by about 5%. The calculation method can be extended to deal with many other problems.",

        "abstract": "Tumor radiotherapy induces hematopoietic organ damage and reduces thrombocyte counts. Thrombocytopenia is a common disease. Some studies have shown that tRNA synthetase plays not only catalytic tRNA aminoacylation roles, but also functions similarly to cytokines. Recombinant human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase with a mutated Y341A (rhTyrRS (Y341A)) promotes megakaryocyte migrate from bone marrow to peripheral blood. It would promote megakaryocytes in the lungs adhering to vascular endothelial cells and resulting in the platelet production. The purpose of this research was to investigate the efficacy of rhTyrRS (Y341A) as a therapy for thrombocytopenia and to explore its mechanism of action. We found platelet number was effectively increased by rhTyrRS (Y341A) via platelet count and reticulated platelets (RPs) flow cytometry. We also demonstrated radiation-induced thrombocytopenia could be prevented by rhTyrRS (Y341A). The results of immunohistochemistry and H&E staining showed the number of pulmonary mature megakaryocytes was significantly increased in rhTyrRS (Y341A) treated groups. In transgenic zebrafish larvae, confocal microscopy results showed rhTyrRS (Y341A) promoted the migration and adhesion of megakaryocytes. These results suggested that rhTyrRS (Y341A) promote megakaryocytes in bone marrow migrating to lungs through blood circulation. rhTyrRS (Y341A) may be an effective medicine which could be used to treat patients suffering from thrombocytopenia.",

        "abstract": "Currently, anticoagulants would be used to prevent thrombosis. Thrombin is an effector enzyme for haemostasis and thrombosis. We designed a direct thrombin inhibitor peptide (DTIP) using molecular simulation and homology modelling and demonstrated that the C-terminus of DTIP interacts with exosite I, and N-terminus with the activity site of thrombin, respectively. DTIP interfered with thrombin-mediated coagulation in human, rat and mouse plasma (n=10 per group) and blocked clotting in human whole blood in vitro. When administered subcutaneously, DTIP showed potent and dose-dependent extension of aPTT, PT, TT and CT in rats (n=10 per group). The antithrombotic dose of DTIP induced significantly less bleeding than bivalirudin determined by transecting distal tail assay in rats. Furthermore, DTIP reached peak blood concentration in 0.5-1 hour and did not cause increased bleeding after five days of dosing compared to dabigatran etexilate. The antithrombotic effect of DTIP was evaluated in mice using lethal pulmonary thromboembolism model and FeCl-induced mesenteric arteriole thrombus model. DTIP (1.0 mg/kg, sc) prevented deep venous thrombosis and increased the survival rate associated with pulmonary thromboembolism from 30\u2009% to 80\u2009%. Intravital microscopy showed that DTIP (1.0 mg/kg, sc) decelerated mesenteric arteriole thrombosis caused by FeCl injury. These data establish that DTIP is a novel antithrombotic agent that could be used to prevent thrombosis without conferring an increased bleeding risk.",

We present a simple, small, flexible three-armed core structure that can be conjugated to targeting, imaging, and therapeutic moieties. The targeting molecule can be a peptide, protein, or chemical compound. The diagnostic reporter can be optical and/or nuclear in nature, and can be replaced by chemo- and/or radiotherapeutic compounds for treatment using a single targeting molecule. Imaging components can be used to detect disease biomarkers, monitor treatment response, and guide surgery in real-time to create a tumor-free margin. Isotope impurity can be exploited to visualize whole-body distribution of therapeutic agents. The one-to-one ratio of targeting component to therapeutic agents facilitates dose calculation. The simple synthesis and flexible, modular nature of the agent facilitate high-purity, large-scale production. The core capacity to \"seek, treat, and see\" may advance precision medicine in the future. ",

This paper proposes an effective and convenient scheme in which a K-inverter is inserted between an approximately    $0~Omega $    output impedance voltage source and a transmitting resonator in order to isolate the receivers from each other, where the voltage and power distributed to each load are independent of other loads. The load-isolation principle is illustrated in detail. The indirect cross coupling aggravating the cross interferences is also investigated, and some practical criterions are derived to eliminate them. A three-receiver WPT experimental platform was established and tested to verify the theory; measured results were in close agreement with the theoretical values.",

        "abstract": "Normal estimation is a crucial first step for numerous light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data-processing algorithms, from building reconstruction, road extraction, and ground-cover classification to scene rendering. For LiDAR point clouds in urban environments, this paper presents a robust method to estimate normals by constructing an octree-based hierarchical representation for the data and detecting a group of large enough consistent neighborhoods at multiscales. Consistent neighborhoods are mainly determined based on the observation that an urban environment is typically comprised of regular objects, e.g., buildings, roads, and the ground surface, and irregular objects, e.g., trees and shrubs; the surfaces of most regular objects can be approximatively represented by a group of local planes. Even in the frequent presence of heavy noise and anisotropic point samplings in LiDAR data, our method is capable of estimating robust normals for kinds of objects in urban environments, and the estimated normals are beneficial to more accurately segment and identify the objects, as well as preserving their sharp features and complete outlines. The proposed method was experimentally validated both on synthetic and real urban LiDAR datasets, and was compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

An automatic segmentation of the LiDAR data is important for understanding and reconstructing the outdoor scenes. However, it is still a challenging task due to complex and various objects in the outdoor scenes and some scanning drawbacks in the LiDAR data. Observing that most of the objects, such as the ground, road, roof, and facade, can be locally described with a group of geometric shapes, e.g. plane, sphere, and cylinder, we propose an automatic method to segment raw LiDAR data by robustly extracting the shapes in this paper. Firstly, our method divides the raw LiDAR data into a number of supervoxels considering the geometric and spectral consistencies of LiDAR data. Secondly, we robustly extract shapes from each supervoxels using a random sample consensus (RANSAC)-based method and evaluates and optimises the extracted shapes with a density lo...",

Furthermore, a total of four wild-type cucurbitadienol synthase protein variants (50R573L, 50C573L, 50R573Q, and 50C573Q) based on two missense mutation single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites were discovered. An in vitro enzyme reaction analysis indicated that 50R573L had the highest activity, with a specific activity of 10.24 nmol min\u22121 mg\u22121. In addition, a site-directed mutant, namely, 50K573L, showed a 33% enhancement of catalytic efficiency compared to wild-type 50R573L. Our findings identify a novel cucurbitadienol synthase allele correlates with high catalytic efficiency. These results are valuable for the molecular breeding of luohanguo.",

It is defined as the toxic influence of chemicals released from one plant species on the germination and growth of individuals of the same species. Here, in order to exam the autotoxicity of tobacco root exudates, root exudates were collected from tobacco plants grown both in cultural solution and on natural soil. Using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry, main autotoxic chemical substances in the root exudates were identified. The autotoxic effects of suspected autotoxins on seed germination (including germination rate, germination potential, germination index, and vigor index) and seedling growth were analyzed. Dibutyl phthalate (or diisobutyl phthalate), dioctyl phthalate, and diisooctyl phthalate were identified in tobacco root exudates. It was observed that high concentrations (greater than 0.5 mmol L \u22121 ) of each identified phthalate ester caused significant ( P",

We performed comprehensive genomic profiling using an analytically validated clinical next-generation sequencing assay to identify genomic alterations in 450 cancer-related genes in a cohort of 88 Chinese HGSOC patients. Overall, we detected 547 genomic alterations with an average of 6.2 alterations per tumor. Most of these HGSOC tumors had low tumor mutation burden and were microsatellite stable. Consistent with earlier studies, TP53 mutations were present in the majority (96.6%) of the tumors studied, and mutations in BRCA1/2 that affect DNA repair were also detected frequently in 20.5% of the tumors. However, we observed a 10.2% of mutated genes in the Ras/Raf pathway, all co-occurring with TP53 mutations in the same tumor, which was unrecognized previously. Our results show that in HGSOC patients, there may be an unrecognized co-occurrence of TP53 mutations with mutations in Ras/Raf pathway.",

Serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), lipids, ET-1, interleukin (IL)-6, NO, circulating endothelial progenitor cell (cEPC) count, adhesion, migration and proliferation were measured in pretreatment and post-treatment. After respective treatment, the atorvastatin group had significantly decreased levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, hs-CRP, ET-1 and IL-6 and increased NO compared to the control group. The atorvastatin group had a more significant improvement of CTFC, effective rate, cEPC number, EPC adhesion, migration and proliferation compared to the control group.

        "abstract": "Effects of early enteral nutrition (EEN) or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) support on nutritional status and blood glucose in patients with gastric cancer complicated with diabetes mellitus after radical gastrectomy were investigated. One hundred and twenty-nine patients with gastric cancer complicated with diabetes mellitus type 2 admitted to the First People's Hospital of Jinan (Jinan, China), from June 2012 to June 2016 were selected into the study. According to different nutrition support pathways, these patients were randomly divided into the EEN group and the TPN group. The improvement of nutritional indexes, postoperative complications, gastrointestinal function recovery and perioperative blood glucose fluctuation were compared between the two groups. On the 4th day after operation, the improvement levels of total bilirubin (TBL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), total protein (TP), prealbumin (PAB), hemoglobin (HGB) and weight (Wt) in the EEN group were significantly higher than those in the conventional group (P<0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups on the 8th day after operation (P>0.05). No patients had complications in the EEN group, while a total of 29 patients in the TPN group suffered adverse reactions, indicating that the incidence rate of complications in the EEN group was significantly lower than that in the TPN group (P<0.05). The postoperative evacuation time was earlier, hospitalization time was shorter and cost of postoperative hospitalization was less in the EEN group than those in the TPN group, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). The blood glucose fluctuation values at fasting and 2 h after a meal in the TPN group were higher than those in the EEN group within 8 days after operation, and the differences were statistically significant (\u03c7=13.219, P=0.002; \u03c7=20.527, P<0.001). EEN support provides nutrition for patients with gastric cancer complicated with diabetes mellitus after radical gastrectomy, which is worthy of clinical promotion as it maintains good nutritional status, produces few postoperative complications and keeps the blood glucose level stable, by which the postoperative evacuation time is early, the hospitalization time is short and the cost is low.",

The abilities of proliferation and invasion of human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells were significantly enhanced when indirectly cocultured with human omental adipose-derived MSCs (O-ADSCs) in vitro. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, EOC cells were cultured with conditioned medium (CM) from O-ADSCs (O-ADSC), and the effect of O-ADSC CM on the proteomic profile of EOC cells was assessed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), followed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. The 2-DE assays revealed a global increase in protein expression in the EOC cells treated with CM. Nine proteins were identified from 11 selected protein spots with differential expression after treatment with CM from O-ADSCs. All the nine proteins have been linked to carcinoma and apoptosis, and the migration ability of tumor cells can be regulated by these proteins. Moreover, the upregulation of prohibitin and serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 in EOC cells treated with CM was further confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. These results suggest that O-ADSCs affect the proteomic profile of EOC cells via paracrine mechanism in favor of EOC progression.",

        "title": "Biocompatibility of polypropylene mesh scaffold with adipose-derived stem cells.",
        "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the rejection of the synthetic patch and human tissues in the host. We observed the growth of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) cultured with polypropylene mesh . The results of flow cytometry showed that the expression of CD44, CD73, CD90, CD45, CD14 and CD34 was 98.54, 95.32, 98.49, 1.21, 3.01 and 2.14%, respectively. ADSCs were isolated from rabbit subcutaneous adipose tissue after collagenase digestion, filtration and centrifugation. The ADSCs of passage 3 were seeded onto the polypropylene mesh scaffolds. New Zealand White female breeder rabbits were implanted with polypropylene mesh, ADSC-fixed polypropylene mesh in the abdomen. After 4 weeks, adhesion was performed and the erosion of the mesh was evaluated. It was found that polypropylene mesh, ADSC-fixed polypropylene mesh all had different degrees of corrosion, and adhesion, but polypropylene mesh was more corroded. ADSC-fixed polypropylene mesh induced a milder chronic inflammation response compared with polypropylene, had significantly lower scores for inflammation (t=11.083), and had significantly higher scores for neovascularization (t=14.362) and fibroblastic proliferation (t=15.979). The relative amount of VEGF mRNA was significantly lower for ADSC-fixed polypropylene compared with the other polypropylene meshes (t=94.6). In conclusion, polypropylene mesh scaffold with ADSCs exhibit excellent cellular compatibility and are promising in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": " We aimed to investigate the expression dynamics of Aquaporin 1 () in cervical cancer and evaluate correlations among  levels and the clinicopathological features of patients with cervical cancer.   mRNA and protein levels in cervical cancer and adjacent normal tissues were evaluated by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for  was performed with a tissue microarray of cervical cancer (containing 63 cases of squamous cell cervical cancers and 10 normal cervical tissues) to investigate clinicopathological outcomes. Cut-off scores for positive expression of  were determined by receiver operating characteristic analysis. The   test was used to analyze correlations among  expression and clinicopathological features of cervical cancer.  The expression of  was decreased in the majority of cervical cancer tissues by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. Positive expression of  was observed in 100% (10/10) of normal cervical tissues and in 42.86% (27/63) of cervical cancer tissues by IHC analysis. The cut-off score for positive expression of  was determined to be 45% of cancer cells. Decreased expression of  was correlated with clinicopathological features including; poor pathological grade (=0.000), late International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage (=0.008), and positive lymph nodes (=0.002).  These data suggest that decreased expression of  correlated with progressive features in patients with cervical cancer.  levels may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of cervical cancer.",
