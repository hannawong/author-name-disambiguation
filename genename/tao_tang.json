        "abstract": "An investigation was made from July 2005 to June 2006 to understand the spatial distribution of macroinvertebrates in Xiangxi River, the largest tributary in Hubei portion of Three Gorges Reservoir. The results showed that Ephemeroptera baetis spp., Ephemeroptera epeorus spp., and Plecoptera nemoura spp. were the dominant taxa. There existed greater differences in the habitat characters and in the community structure of macroinvertebrates among the major tributaries of Xiangxi River, and the relative abundance of functional feeding groups could reflect the characters of different habitats. A comparison of the diversity of dominant taxa and their tolerance towards pollution among the major tributaries showed that Jiuchong River had the best habitat, followed by the main stream of Xiangxi River, and Gaolan River and Gufu River. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that the NH4 +-N concentration in the main stream of Xiangxi River, the pH, turbidity, water depth, SiO2, conductance, and alkalinity in Jiuchong River, the turbidity in Gaolan River, and the NH4 +-N and NO3 --N concentrations in Gufu River had significant impact on the community structure of macroinvertebrates.",

        "abstract": "In May 2009,an investigation was conducted to understand the macrobenthos community structure and its relationships with water environmental factors in Erhai Lake and in three small lakes(Haixihai,Cibihu and Xihu) in Erhai watershed.In Erhai Lake,the mean density of macrobenthos was 1556 ind\u00b7m-2,and the biomass was 8.9 g\u00b7m-2.The macrobenthos community was dominated by Chironomus sp.,Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri,and Radix sp.,with the relative abundance being 43.5%,39.5%,and 8.6% respectively.The biomass was mainly contributed by Corbicula largillierti,Radix sp.,and Chironomus sp.The spatial distribution of macrobenthos community based on GIS interpolation showed that the density was the highest in the north region of Erhai Lake,the biomass was the highest in the littoral zone of the middle region,both the density and the biomass were relatively low in the south region,and the Shannon diversity index was higher in the littoral zone.In the three small lakes,the main taxa were Nematoda,Chironomidae,Tubificidae and Chaoboridae.Both the density and the biomass had the maximum values(260.8 ind\u00b7m-2 and 1.14 g\u00b7m-2,respectively) in Cibihu Lake.CCA analysis showed that the total phosphorous and Ca2+ concentrations in water body had significant effects on the macrobenthos community,with the contribution rate being 34% and 27%,respectively.The Xihu Lake nearest to Erhai had the similar macrobenthos community type as Erhai Lake,mainly because of the relatively high total nitrogen concentration in the water.Compared with historical data,the proportions of Oligochaete and Chironomid in Erhai Lake continued to increase,which implied that the organic pollution in the Lake was further intensified.",

        "abstract": "Based on the water quality survey of the Erhai basin in 2009, covering 62 sampling points, cluster analysis was done of the data for characterization of the spatial and temporal variation of water quality of the Erhai basin. Spatially, the sampling points were divided into 4 groups, that are, Group A 1, source streams in the interference-free Cangshan forest; Group A 2, upper and middle reaches of the streams and lakes in the farming areas and towns that are subjected to some extent of human interference; Group A 3, lower reaches of the streams running through the farming areas and towns that are subjected to severe human interference; and Group A 4, offshore of the Erhai Lake that is most seriously interfered by mankind. Discriminatory analysis (DA) was used to identify significant indexes, and to reflect results of the spatial cluster analysis, and the results of the analysis show that the clustering reached 95.2% in accuracy. By means of principal component analysis (PCA), four groups of principal components were identified. Principal Component Group 1 included alkalinity, Ca 2+, Mg 2+ and hardness; Group 2, TP; Group 3, TN and NO 3 --N; and Group 4, DOC and TOC. Spatial differences were significant between these groups. On a time scale, Alk was higher in the wet season than in the dry season and Ca 2+ the other way round. TP did not vary much, while TN in Group A1 and Group A 3 was higher in the wet season than in the dry season.",

        "title": "The essential issues in aquatic ecological function regionalization",
        "abstract": "Research on the first and second levels of aquatic ecological function regionalization ( AEFR) ,a new regionalization framework,is now being conducted in several representative river/lakes watersheds in China. How to regionalize the target watersheds scientifically and logically is an important and urgent question. In this paper,we proposed understandings for regionalization objectives,guidelines and methods,through discussing the relationships between AEFR and aquatic ecological regionalization,the roles of aquatic organisms and selections of quantitative methods. Based on summarizing the general characters of ecological regionalization schemes from various government departments,countries and regions,we firstly gave the definition and objectives of AEFR: developing and improving from existing ecological regionalization theories,it is a task that divides the target watershed into several independent and intact units by distinguishing the spatial heterogeneity of aquatic ecosystems in terms of patterns and functions,and discriminating the coupling relationship between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Regionalization units provide basic management element for watershed pollution control,water quality,the benchmark and standard of ecological health and ecological capacity. By implementing regionalized, hierarchical, classified and sequential management strategies in various regionalization units,it is possible to ensure watershed health and aquatic ecological functions,so that to achieve the objectives of water quality safety and ecological integrity within target watershed. By comparing the existing regionalization methods,we suggested to combine the up-bottom deductive method and bottom-up induction method in AEFR research. Namely,environmental driving factors,including climate,hydrology, geomorphology,soil,vegetation and land use/land cover indices,etc. ,should be used to divide the watershed into several units. Whereafter,habitat based variables such as biological community compositions,functional groups,biodiversity indices,physicochemical factors,etc. can be used to verify and validate the regionalization results. The above two steps are both essential and indispensable. Considering the different responses of diverse aquatic organisms to environmental stress, aquatic invertebrates and algal assemblages,which are normally used as bio-indicators,we highly recommend using as testing organisms in Chinese waters.Being a subjective task,after all,it is impossible to accomplish AEFR using quantitative methods completely. To achieve more objective results,we proposed to integrate expert judgments with quantitative results. The procedure will be as followings: correlation analysis or dimensionality reducing techniques such as principal component analysis ( PCA) should be used firstly to find independent factors that contribute mostly to spatial heterogeneity of aquatic ecosystems. And then, such small collection of independent factors will be used to differentiate spatial patches of the watershed,with the assistance of expert judgments. Thirdly,at the stage of regionalization verification,classification and ordination methods such as clustering ( unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean ( UPGMA) ,Ward's method,k-means clustering,etc. ) , two-way indicator species analysis ( TWINSPAN) ,detrended correspondence analysis ( DCA) ,canonical correspondence analysis ( CCA) ,redundancy analysis ( RDA) ,and artificial neutral network ( ANN) etc. can be used to analysis spatial patterns of aquatic organisms and other habitat variables. The results,in turn,will be used to verify or modify regionalization results,assisted with expert judgments,again. However,special attention should be given to applicability of each quantitative method. Besides,it is necessary to use and unify quantitative methods in regionalization as possible,so that to get comparable results and lay solid foundation for national regionalization work in the future.",

        "abstract": "An investigation was carried out on the benthic algal communities at 22 sites in the Jinping reach of Yalong River and its main tributaries in May and November 2004, aimed to study the relationships between benthic algal distribution and environmental variables. A total of 150 taxa (mostly to species level) in 37 genera were observed, which belonged to Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta. Diatoms comprised 96. 5% of the total taxa. Achnanthes linearis and Achnanthes deflexa were the most abundant species, and the relative abundances were 35. 3% and 11. 0% of the total abundance, respectively. In May and November, Nitzschia dissipata and Gomphonema parvulum were the dominant species in Jinping reach of Yalong River, while Achnanthes linearis, Cocconeis placentula and Achnanthes deflexa dominated in its tributaries. Based on the species composition and their relative abundance, detrended correspondence analysis ( DC A) showed that sites belonging to Yalong River and its tributaries were well separated on DCA axis 1. This may be explained by the special habitats of Yalong River like high velocity, wide channel width. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) on the relationships between benthic algal community structure and environmental variables indicated that in May, TP was the main environmental variable affecting the benthic algal disturbing, while in November, NH4-N and elevation were the main onesSR.",

In order to evaluate the potential impact of acid mine drainage on the benthic algal communities in Gaolan River,which is one of the three main tributaries of Xiangxi River,we chose three sites in pyrite mining area as impaired group (I),four uninfluenced sites were taken as control group (C) and five sites as recovery group (R). The results showed that benthic algal density,chlorophyll a concentration,ash free dry mass (AFDM) and autotrophic index (AI) were significantly affected by acid mine drainage from pyrite in the upstream of Gaolan River,while dry season affected seriously than flood season. Correlation analysis showed autotrophic index was positively correlated with metals and negatively correlated with pH,so AI could be a better indicator in the case where a pollutant such as acid mine drainages.",

To compare the difference of purification capability by various life form macro- phytes, Oenanthe javanica, Equisetum fluviatile, Elodea Canadensis Michx. and Myriophyllum verticillatum L. were chosen to bulit a hydrophyte complex pond to purify sewage from Daqinghe, one main inflow river of Dianchi lake. The results showed that all the four macrophytes had abilities to resist hydraulic impact loading, and were adapted to the dynamic instability of quality and quantity of inflow water. All the plants could decontaminate CODCr, NH3-N, NO3-N, TN and TP in the sewage with different efficiency, in which Oenanthe javanica and Myriophyllum verticillatum L. had the best comprehensive purification ability. As an integrated system, the pond had the best removal efficiency on CODCr with the efficiency of 41.4%, while the efficiency on NO3-N was the lowest (only 5.7%). Our research gave a successful demonstration of ecological treatment to other inflow rivers of Dianchi Lake and other similar polluted waters in China.",

A total of 218 taxa were identified, including 183 species of Bacillariophyta, 24 species of Chlorophyta, 10 species of Cyanophyta, and one species of Xanthophyta. The diatom Achnanthes linearis was the most predominant species. The richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices varied significantly (or almost significantly) over time and space, and the total average values were 32 and 1.54, respectively. The total averages of annual epilithic algal density and chlorophyll a concentration were 8.75 x 10(9) cells x m(-2) and 14.62 mg x m(-2), respectively. There were significant differences in the algal density and chlorophyll a concentration among different sampling sites, and the maximum values were observed in Gufu River tributary, which were one order of magnitude higher than the minimum ones in Jiuchong River tributary. The algal density and chlorophyll a concentration tended to be higher in winter and spring than in summer and autumn, but no significant differences were observed in various seasons. Epilithic algal density and chlorophyll a concentration were significantly negatively correlated with elevation and water current, but positively correlated with the total nitrogen concentration in water.",

Every FFGs distribution was significantly different among seasons and tributaries in Xiangxi River. By analyzing the spatio-temporal distribution of some indices based on FFGs, the results showed that material cycling capability, lateral input capability, CPOM input/ FPOM input in Jiuchong River were much better than the other rivers, and they were much better in winter than in other seasons. Longitudinal transport capability was best in Gaolan River; and it was also better in winter. Stepwise regression analysis showed that material cycling could be mirrored by water velocity, conductivity, turbidity, total nitrogen, SiO2; Longitudinal transport could be mirrored by SiO2 and chemical oxygen demand ( COD) ; Lateral input capability could be mirrored by water temperature, water depth, SiO2, total phosphorus; and CPOM input/FPOM input was maily mirrored by water temperature and SiO2.",

During sampling period, no significant differences were observed in the main physicochemical variables between GF04 and GL03, but the hydrodynamics differed significantly. GL03 was basically at a status of slow flow; while GF04, owing to the discharging from the reservoir, was at a riffle status during more than 60% of the sampling period. Such a difference in hydrodynamics induced significant differences in the community similarity of benthic algae and the relative abundance of unattached diatoms, erect diatoms, and stalked diatoms between GF04 and GL03, which could better reflect the impacts of irregular draw-off by large hydropower station on river eco-system.",

        "abstract": "The Ecosystem Health Index (EHI) and Trophic State Index (TSI) were used to assess the ecosystem health and eutrophic status of Erhai Lake and three small lakes (Haixihai, Cibihu and Xihu) in Erhai watershed. According to the field survey carried out in May 2009, all lakes in Erhai watershed were in an eutrophic status (averaged TSI =53.9) and in a worse ecosystems health status (averaged EHI =38.3). Further analysis found that the EHI has a high spatial variability among and between the lakes in Erhai watershed. Haixihai lake (EHI=42.7) and Cibihu lake (EHI = 42.1) had a median score of EHI; however, Xihu lake (EHI=33.5) and Erhai lake (EHI=37.9) had a lower score of EHI. Among Erhai lake, the north and central region had a higher score of EHI than the other regions. A comparison between EHI and TSI in assessing lake ecosystem's status revealed that lakes in Erhai watershed belong to the response ecosystem that basically shows a positive correlation between nutrient and biomass, and the EHI is a good index in assessing ecosystem health of lakes in Erhai watershed. In addition, the EHI was used to assess the ecosystem health of Erhai lake in the past 20 years. The result indicated that ecosystem health of Erhai lake is degrading. The worst ecosystem state was observed in 1997, with a EHI value of 36.7.",

        "abstract": "This essay had investigated the fish resources at 21 sites in the Erhai Lake in August and November 2009. The nets were put into water in every sampling site of the lake at around 5 pm and pulled them back at 5 am the next day. The sampling was conducted for 3 times in each site, and the species and amounts of fishes, sampling time, latitude and longitude of sampling sites, types of nets and other information were recorded. The fishes were identified and classified by referencing to 'The Fishes of Yunnan'. The results showed that there were 23 species, belonging to 6 orders and 9 families. The most abundant family was Cyprinidae which contained 14 species and accounted for 60.9% of total number of species. And the fish fauna of Erhai Lake was similar to that of the lower-middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The population of Ctenogobius giurinus and Ctenogobius cliffordpopei was larger, accounting for 96.1% of total amount; next was Neosalanx taihuensis, which accounted for 2.9%. The small-size fishes (i.e. Ctenogobius giurinus, Ctenogobius cliffordpopei and Pseudorasbora parva) were predominant not only in the number of species but also in the yield; the yields of original commercial Carassius auratus and Cyprinus carpi\u00f3 were lower; the artificial stocking fishes, such as Neosalanx taihuensis, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Aristichthys nobilis, became the main species in fishery of Erhai Lake. The main fishery model in Erhai Lake was extensive farming model, and the main stocking species were Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Aristichthys nobilis, Megalobrama amblycephala, Cyprinus carpi\u00f3, and Carassius auratus. The annual fish production of Erhai Lake has continued to rise since 1999. And up to now, there was no very effective solution in control of the wild trash fishes with small size and proliferation of the rare indigenous fish species. The data of water quality from 2004 to 2009 in Erhai Lake were analyzed by the standard index. The water quality of Erhai Lake was at level III, which was in the middle level of eutrophication. The 2 developmental patterns of fishery were put with different focuses: proliferation of the stocking economic fish species, control of the small size and low value fish species, and restoration of the rare and indigenous fish species; proliferation of the stocking economic fish species, and introduction of new improved varieties.",

        "abstract": "The river health comprehensive assessment index (RHCAI) has been developed to evaluate the environmental and biological conditions of small, middle and large rivers in the lowland, agricultural and urban areas in northen Liaoning, China. The RHCAI provides scores for 5 components: River hydrology, physical morphology, riverside zone, water quality parameters and aquatic organisms. Compared with the physical and chemical factors widely used for river health assessment in China, This study pays greater attention to the importance of aquatic organisms. The RHCAI was applied to study the river health in northern Liaoning and 28 rivers and tributaries were evaluated. The results showed that the overall river health in this region was \"normal\" or \"subhealth\". Among the evaluated rivers, the rivers flowing to Wolong Lake were the best, close to \"health\", while the Beisha River, Pu River, Liu river and Dongmalian River had bad health states. As rivers are important carrier of fresh water resources, the assessment of river health state will enrich the theories and methodology of river ecology, watershed ecology and restoration ecology in China, and the results can be considered the basis of management and decision-making for ecological, economic and social sustainable development of this region. The RHCAI is now available to be used more widely for assessing the health conditions of river. Fig 2, Tab 7, Ref 30.",

        "abstract": "The influence of small hydropower plants (SHPs) on the spatial distribution of macroinvertebrate assemblages was investigated in 5 cascade SHPs along the Xiangxi River in October 2005. 5 sites were sampled at each SHP. A total of 4656 macroinvertebrates belonging to 69 genera were collected. The characteristics of macroinvertebrate community structures were analyzed by using richness, abundance, dominant species and functional feeding groups. The results suggested that construction of SHPs had no significant impact on water chemistry, but on physical variables (such as current velocity and water depth) which varied significantly among the 5 sites. All the characteristics of the macroinvertebrate community were more or less affected by the construction, especially by the abundance, filter-collector percentage, predator percentage, and the stations. The results also suggested that the sites beneath the dam had the most different community structures, indicating that diverting the water current completely is harmful to the protection of macroinvertebrate diversity of the river.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on aquatic ecosystems of streams in high mountain areas,benthic macroinvertebrates were collected from the Gangqu Stream in Shangrila Gorge,China,and their response to anthropogenic disturbances was discussed using multiple statistical analysis and ordination analysis.The results show that the contamination of heavy metals was not seriously high at the sampling sites.Meanwhile,anthropogenic disturbances including farming,grazing,villages and town developments lightly affected the physio-chemical factors of the stream water;the water quality of sampling sites generally belonged to Grade \u2160 or Grade \u2161 Chinese Surface Water Standard(GB3838-2002).By applying cluster analysis,the sampling sites were clustered into four clusters according to the similarity of community composition.The north branch Wengshui stream(cluster \u2160) and south branch Gezan stream(cluster \u2161) had low level of human activities.The sampling sites of cluster \u2162 were mainly affected by mining and farming.The sampling sites of cluster \u2163 were heavily polluted by heavy metals.According to non-metric multi-dimensional scaling analysis(NMS),the four clusters were separated at the different areas at the ordination axes.The differences of spatial distribution were reflected between clusters \u2160 and \u2161, whereas the differences of anthropogenic disturbances and contamination of heavy metals were discriminated from cluster \u2162 to cluster \u2163.The variation of community compositions of macroinverterbates from the upstream to downstream areas were identified with water depth,stream width,water temperature,turbidity and altitude.The contamination of copper and lead and the enrichment of the nitrate dominated the separation of clusters \u2162 and \u2163.Indicator value analyses were conducted to identify the indicator species for different clusters.Erpobdellidae sp.and Pericome sp.were the indicator species of cluster \u2160,and several sensitive species,including Nemoura sp.,Amphinemura sp.etc.,were the indicator species of cluster \u2161.Moderately tolerant species and tolerant species,including Brachycentrus sp.,Ephemera sp.and Oligochaeta sp.dominated the species composition of cluster \u2162,and Dugesia sp.dominated the disturbed sampling sites of cluster \u2163.Thus, Dugesia sp.also reflected its characteristic of higher metal tolerance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Research on multi-scale temporal dynamics of lotic algal assemblages remains scarce. In this study, we analyzed epilithic algae sampled monthly from a Chinese subtropical mountain river network from 2004 to 2007, by using a multivariate time series modeling approach. We hypothesized that (1) multi-scale temporal dynamics exist within algal communities; (2) physical and chemical conditions drive algal temporal dynamics; and (3) tributary sites differ in algal temporal changes. This study revealed 2\u20134 site-specific algal temporal dynamics, contributed by 23\u201345% component taxa. Among the time-related taxa, percentages of high profile guild taxa were higher than both the low profile and the motile guild taxa. Several algal temporal dynamics were found to be driven by water temperature, conductivity, or current velocity, within which influences of conductivity at two sites resulted in directional changes in algal communities. Furthermore, tributary sites differed in algal temporal changes when compared to the two mainstream sites. Our findings imply that natural fluctuations and agricultural disturbance together shaped algal temporal dynamics in the studied river network. In conclusion, for accurately tracking algal temporal dynamics, we recommend that long-term and high-frequency biomonitoring protocols are developed. Moreover, both the mainstream and tributary sites should be monitored simultaneously.",

        "abstract": "Benthic algae were collected from central and northern Chinese rivers to test the hypothesis that geographic location has significant contributions in shaping algal assemblages. We used Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM) to model spatial components and variation partitioning to quantify the influences of spatial and environmental variables on regional patterns of algal richness and community composition, respectively. We found that variation in algal richness was attributed to MEM component 2, 8, and 9 and the quadratic term of N-NO3. Regarding abundance data, latitude, longitude, and MEM component 1, 2, and 7 were important spatial variables. Although P-PO4, pH, and annual mean temperature were significant environmental variables influencing algal community composition, they were all spatially structured. Among the total explained variance in both algal metrics, spatial proportions were higher than that of environmental variables. We also found that abundant species of Achnanthidium minutissimum, Cocconeis placentula, Cymbella delicatula, Cymbella affinis, Cymbella turgidula, and Synedra ulna displayed clear spatially related patterns. In conclusion, the contributions of spatial and environmental variables to regional variation of algal assemblages are scale-dependent. As for our study scale (~1,000 km), spatial control may be more important. Since spatial effects could obscure local environmental impacts on algal communities, appropriate study scale and statistical methods should be taken into account in algal bioassessment. We recommend inclusion of both algal richness and community composition in study of algal biogeography, due to their different relationships with spatial and environmental variables. \u00a9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Limited knowledge was known about the stability of newly formed large reservoirs for laking long-time datasets. We used a decade-long monitoring dataset to examine the stability of macroinvertebrate community in the Three Gorges Reservoir and the impacts of water level fluctuations caused by recurrent impoundment events. We found that the macroinvertebrate community experienced a weak directional change over the ten years. More specifically, the directional change only happened during the initial impoundment stages and the community became relatively stable since the third impoundment stage. The communities were significantly different among the three impoundment stages when the annual water level fluctuation increased consecutively. The temporal variation of the community in the former phase was on account of the increasing water level fluctuation and the intrinsic succession process. The species richness, evenness and production all showed slight increase trends since the third impoundment stage, which implied the stabilization of the community. Nevertheless, influenced by the huge annual water level fluctuations (30\u00a0m) and vagaries seasonal floods, the community experienced high stochastic year-to-year variation. Our study suggests that the macroinvertebrate community in the Three Gorges Reservoir has become relatively stable and will keep the stability with high stochastic variation for a long time.",

        "abstract": "To study the relationships between in-stream total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) loads and responses of epilithic algal metrics, nonparametric change-point analysis (nCPA) and thresholds indicator taxa analysis (TITAN) were used to detect possible TN and TP thresholds for algal chlorophyll a, diatom richness, Shannon diversity index, and diatom community composition for tributary rivers of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). We found that nCPA simulated similar TP thresholds for all the four algal metrics (-0.03 mg\u00b7L), with similar TN thresholds (-0.8 mg\u00b7L) for all metrics but community composition. In contrast, TITAN provided specific nutrient thresholds for both sensitive and tolerant taxa within the whole community, and the threshold ranges covered thresholds for the other metrics. Additionally, nine (one sensitive and eight tolerant taxa) and ten indicator taxa (five sensitive and five tolerant taxa) for TN and TP were detected by TITAN, respectively. Therefore, we used the results of TITAN to define nutrient thresholds for the study rivers. That is, when in-stream TN concentration exceeded 0.382 mg\u00b7L or TP concentration exceeded 0.016 mg\u00b7L(i.e. negative response threshold), sensitive taxa within river epilithic diatom assemblages would respond with decrease in density. When TN exceeded 1.298 mg\u00b7L or TP exceeded 0.065 mg\u00b7L(i.e. positive response threshold), even tolerant taxa would be influenced and the whole assemblage would be changed significantly. Based on such criteria, we found that 87% sites had TN concentrations higher than the negative response threshold, with 22% sites being higher than the TN positive response threshold. As for TP, 94% and 14% sites exceeded the negative and positive response threshold, respectively. Our findings suggest that although most of the inflow tributaries of Three Gorges Reservoir were disturbed by human disturbance, yet the disturbance was not so extensive. Our findings provided significant information for managing river ecosystems of the TGR region.",

(2013) used the surface sediment diatom data from the 2007 National Lake Assessment to develop national scale site specific models for MMIs to account for natural variation in condition among sites. Liu and Stevenson (2017) also used the 2007 lakes data to evaluate performance of MMIs by grouping sites by ecoregions or typologies (naturally similar types of lakes defined by similarity in diatom species composition) with site specific metric models (SSMMs) that adjust metrics for natural variability among sites. Tang et al. (2016) used benthic diatom data from the 2008\u20132009 National River and Stream Assessment to develop SSMMs and MMIs by ecoregion and typology. All three studies showed that SSMMs improved performance of diatom MMIs by accounting for natural variation among sites. None of the studies provided consistent evidence that grouping sites by typologies produced better MMI performance than grouping sites by ecoregions.  Liu and Cao (2018) criticized the Tang et al. (2016) paper for using means and standard errors to evaluate relative performance of MMI calculation methods at the site group scale, however, their criticism is incorrect. Actually, Tang et al. (2016) only used means to summarize and report relative performance of MMI calculation methods in the body of the paper. Tang et al. (2016) appropriately used non-parametric rank sum approaches to evaluate the probability that the multiple MMI calculations for separate site groups were the same for ecoregion (n\u202f=\u202f9) and typology (n\u202f=\u202f7) site groups. Liu and Stevenson (2017) used this same non-parametric approach for tests of lake diatom MMIs. Liu and Caou0027s (2018) concerns can be addressed by distinguishing between the goals and methods used for testing and evaluation of MMI calculation methods at the national and site-group scales. Tang et al. (2016) did not aggregate data across site groups to test MMI performance at the national scale because they were following standard EPA methods that develop separate MMIs for each site group. In conclusion, Liu and Cao (2018) misunderstood the MMI evaluation in Tang et al. (2016) and added no new information to this body of work, because all the concerns they raised were discussed in Liu and Stevenson (2017).",

        "abstract": "Delineation of regional boundary is an important procedure in ecological regionalization, but at present, this delineation for aquatic eco-regionalization is mostly dependent on qualitative analysis and expert judgment. In this paper, a two-level eco-region framework was established to delineate the aquatic eco-regions in Erhai Lake Basin. In this framework, sub-basin was taken as the basic unit based on GIS technique, and the indices for the two-level regionalization were quantitatively screened by correlation analysis. Altitude, slope, and normalized difference vegetation index were identified as the indices for level I, and farmland and urban area percentages were the indices for level II. The index maps were overlaid and re-classified, and the sub-basins were further merged into several regions. Five level-I eco-regions and nine level- II eco-regions were delineated finally. The examination through the comparison of the distribution of algal communities in different eco-regions showed that the regionalization result was reasonable. It was suggested that applying quantitative analysis and sub-basin boundaries in aquatic eco-regionalization could make the delineation of regional boundary more scientific and the actual management more operational. This study provided a new method for the study of aquatic eco-regionalization, and the basic units for the aquatic ecological management of Erhai Lake Basin.",

        "abstract": "A preconcentration technique known as cloud point extraction was developed for the determination of trace levels of triazole fungicides tricyclazole, triadimefon, tebuconazole and diniconazole in environmental waters. The triazole fungicides were extracted and preconcentrated using polyethylene glycol 600 monooleate (PEG600MO) as a low toxic and environmentally benign nonionic surfactant, and determined by high performance liquid chromatography/ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). The extraction conditions were optimized for the four triazole fungicides as follows: 2.0 wt% PEG600MO, 2.5 wt% Na(2)SO(4), equilibration at 45\u00b0C for 10 min, and centrifugation at 2000 rpm (533 \u00d7 g) for 5 min. The triazole fungicides were well separated on a reversed-phase kromasil ODS C(18) column (250 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm) with gradient elution at ambient temperature and detected at 225 nm. The calibration range was 0.05-20 \u03bcg L(-1) for tricyclazole and 0.5-20 \u03bcg L(-1) for the other three classes of analytes with the correlation coefficients over 0.9992. Preconcentration factors were higher than 60-fold for the four selected fungicides. The limits of detection were 6.8-34.5 ng L(-1) (S/N=3) and the recoveries were 82.0-96.0% with the relative standard deviations of 2.8-7.8%.",

It uses a Kromasil ODS C(18) column and acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid (85 : 15, v/v) mobile phase at ambient temperature. The plasma sample was prepared by hexane-isoamyl alcohol extraction (90 : 10, v/v). The flow rate and detection wavelength were 1.0 mL/min and 230 nm. The correlation coefficients were greater than 0.9995 within 0.08-50 microg/mL for levonorgestrel and 0.12-50 microg/mL for quinestrol, and the limits of detection were 0.02 and 0.05 microg/mL for levonorgestrel and quinestrol, respectively. Average recovery ranged from 92.5 to 96.3% and inter-day RSDs were less than 7.56%. This method can be applied to the further pharmacokinetic study of levonorgestrel and quinestrol in rat plasma.",

        "abstract": "A pre-column derivatization high-performance liquid chromatographic method for glyphosate analysis has been developed. Derivatization of glyphosate was performed with 4-chloro-3,5-dinitrobenzotrifluoride (CNBF). In pH 9.5 H(3)BO(3)-Na(2)B(4)O(7) media, the reaction of glyphosate with CNBF completed at 60 degrees C for 30min. The labeled glyphosate was separated on a Kromasil C18 column (250mmx4.6mm, 5microm) at room temperature and UV detection was applied at 360nm. The separation of labeled glyphosate was achieved within 15min by gradient elution mode. Compared to other pre-column derivatization, this derivatization was performed more mildly, the derivative was more stable, and the detection limits of a few reagents were higher than CNBF, except 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC-Cl) using fluorescence and mass spectrometry, however, this reagent avoid to be removed after derivatization like FMOC-Cl. The detection limit of glyphosate was 0.009mgL(-1) (S/N=3) without preconcentration and reach MRL, which is set at the level of 0.1mgL(-1) in China. The method linearity correlation coefficient was 0.9999, in concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 48.5mgL(-1).

The affecting factors were studied including concentration of hydrogen peroxide, different water types, and the initial concentrations of quinestrol. Concurrently, the transformation products and presumed pathways of quinestrol in distilled water by UV irradiation were identified and proposed. The results showed that the degradation of quinestrol in both irradiation conditions followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics. More rapid degradation was observed by UV irradiation (k=0.018 min(-1)) than solar irradiation (k=0.004 h(-1)), and the photodegradation rate of quinestrol depended on the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, the initial concentration of quinestrol and water types. The transformation products of quinestrol in distilled water were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. When exposed to UV irradiation, quinestrol in aqueous solution was rapidly degraded, giving at least ten photodegradation products. The chemical structures of ten degradation products were identified on the basis of mass spectrum interpretation and literature data.",

The purpose of this study was to develop an HPLC method with SPE and pre-column derivatization for monitoring the content of biogenic amine in sufu and to understand the differences in the contents of biogenic amines with different processing technologies. Biogenic amines in sufu were extracted with 6% trichloroacetic acid, derivatized with 4-chloro-3,5-dinitrobenzotrifluoride, purified with Waters Oasis MCX cartridge, separated by HPLC using gradient elution, and detected by spectrophotometric UV at 254\u00a0nm. The method linearity, calculated for each biogenic amine, has a correlation coefficient higher than 0.9915. Detection limits of the biogenic amines were ranged from 0.016\u00a0mg/kg for putrescine to 0.067\u00a0mg/kg for spermine. Spiking experiments showed that the overall recoveries ranged between 83.6% and 103.5% with relative standard deviations of 1.26\u20135.24%. Of the seven biogenic amines under study, at least four biogenic amines were detectable in different kinds of sufu. Tryptamine, putrescine, histamine, and tyramine were the most prevailing biogenic amines in all sufu samples. The mean values of histamine, tryptamine, phenylethylamine, tyramine, putrescine, spermidine and spermine determined in samples were found to be 18.2\u00a0mg/kg, 39.0\u00a0mg/kg, 1.1\u00a0mg/kg, 21.7\u00a0mg/kg, 34.6\u00a0mg/kg, 11.1\u00a0mg/kg, and 8.7\u00a0mg/kg, respectively. The total contents of biogenic amines in bacteria fermented sufu samples (129.0\u00a0mg/kg) were slightly lower than those in enzymatically ripened sufu samples (137.7\u00a0mg/kg). The concentrations of biogenic amines detected in sufu samples were below the maximum permissible limits.",

        "abstract": "A new method for glyphosate residue determination in apple has been developed. A SPE cartridge was used to clean up the samples before derivatization. Glyphosate was derivatized with 4-chloro-3,5-dinitrobenzotrifluoride (CNBF) and quantified by reverse ion-pair liquid chromatography using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as ion-pair reagent. In pH 9.5 H(3)BO(3)-Na(2)B(4)O(7) medium, the reaction of glyphosate with CNBF was complete after 30 min at 60 degrees C. The stability of the derivative on exposure to light at room temperature in methanol-water was demonstrated. The labeled glyphosate was separated on a Kromasil C(18) column (250 x 4.6 mm, 5 microm) at room temperature and UV detection was applied at 360 nm. Separation was achieved within 15 min in gradient elution mode. The correlation coefficient for the method was 0.9998 at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50 microg/g. The calculated recoveries for glyphosate in apple were from 86.00 to 99.55%, and the relative standard deviations (n = 6) were from 1.43 to 6.32.

The method involves pre-column derivatization of the amines with 4-chloro-3,5-dinitrobenzotrifluoride (CNBF) and subsequent analysis by RP-HPLC (reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography) with diode array detection. The labeled biogenic amines were separated on a Kromasil C18 column (250mmx4.6mm, 5microm) at room temperature and UV detection was applied at 254nm.

Detection limits of biogenic amines were 0.056-0.87micromolL(-1), at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The proposed method has been applied to the quantitative determination of spermine, phenethylamine, spermidine, histamine, tyramine, tryptamine and putrescine in beer with recoveries of 91.9-103.1% and R.S.D. of 2.86-5.63%. Quantitation is relative to external standards. The results showed that each kind of beer examined contained at least three biogenic amines. Putrescine, histamine and tyramine were detected in all samples. Spermidine was detected in 89% of the beers. Spermine, tryptamine and phenylethylamine occurred in 78%, 61% and 44% of the beers examined, respectively.

The precolumn derivatization conditions, including the CNBF concentration, reaction pH, temperature and reaction time were investigated for method optimization. In pH 9.0 borate buffer, the reaction of amino acids with CNBF was carried out at 60 degrees C for 30min, the optimized concentration of CNBF was 70mmol L(-1) and the molar ratio of amino acids to CNBF was 1:5.25. The chromatographic separation of 19 amino acids derivatives was performed on a Kromasil ODS C(18) column (250mm x 4.6mm, 5microm) with good reproducibility, and ultraviolet detection was applied at 260 nm. The mobile phase was a mixture of phase A (acetonitrile) and phase B (acetate buffer, acetonitrile, triethylamine; 82.8:17:0.2, pH 4.9), and the flow rate was 0.4mL min(-1). The separation of all the labeled amino acids was achieved within 45min at room temperature by gradient elution mode. The method linearity, calculated for each amino acid, had a correlation coefficient higher than 0.9979, in concentrations ranging from 9.60 to 3330.00 micromol L(-1).

        "abstract": "Microbiological degradation of the racemic mixture, the enantiopure R- and S-fipronil was examined under both aerobic and flooded conditions in three Chinese paddy soils. The degradation kinectics and enantiomer fraction (EF) were determined by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with chiral Chiralcel OD-H column, while desulfinyl, sulfone and sulfide derivatives were monitored by reversed phase HPLC with diode array detection (DAD). The degradation/transformation of enantiomers of fipronil in the three live soils under aerobic and flooded conditions generally complied with the first-order kinetics (R2 > or = 0.94). The calculated t1/2 values of the enantiomers of fipronil ranged between 21 and 34 days for aerobic incubation experiments and between 8 and 19 days under flooded conditions incubation, respectively. The calculated EF values of fipronil during the incubation time were all close to 0.5, indicating that the degradation/transformation of fipronil was almost nonenantioselective. The main metabolites of fipronil formed in the incubation experiments were sulfone and sulfide derivatives by oxidative and reductive processes, respectively. The oxidative pathway seemed more active. Under flooded conditions, S-fipronil was preferentially degraded in the three soil samples used. The main metabolite was determined as fipronil sulfide. In control experiments, almost no removal of enantiomers of fipronil was observed indicating that the degradation of fipronil in the paddy soil used was attributed to microbial mediated processes under both aerobic and flooded conditions. In addition, no enantiomerization of fipronil was observed in the soil samples examined under both aerobic and flooded conditions. These results for major differences in the degradation of the enantiomers as well as the formation of toxic metabolites may have some implications for better environmental and ecological risks assessment for chiral pesticides.",

The clinicopathological data were analyzed in 13 cases of anorectal primary malignant melanoma. HE and immunohistochemical stain (SP method) were used in all cases. In this group, 4 were males and 9 were females. Their average age was 56.5 years. The main presenting symptoms were changed defecation habit, bloody stool and visible or palpable mass in the anus, straining and pain around the anus. The rate of clinical misdiagnosis was 100%. There was 1\uff5e4 cm distance from tumor to anus region. Grossly, the tumors appeared nodular, polypoid, cauliflower-like, ulcerated or flat in shape. Histological studies revealed that the tumors were pleomorphic but mainly epithelial or spindle cells. However, melanin granules were observed within the tumor cells in 11 cases. Conclusion Anorectal malignant melanoma is a rare and highly malignant tumor. It is easily misdiagnosed in clinical practice and it is difficult to classify the tumor based mainly on biopsy. The neoplastic cells are positive for S-100 protein and HMB-45, which is significant for pathological diagnosis, especially in the cases without melanin granules.",

Methods One case of bladder plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma was studied. Routine paraffin sections with HE staining and immunohistochemistry of ABC method were observed under light microscope. Pathological and clinical data were analyzed by comparision with early reported cases in the literature. Results There were two tumors in the bladder. Partial vesicoectomy were performed. The tumor on the right lateral wall of the bladder was a plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma. The tumor cells exhibited typical plasmacytoid profiles. They were round or oval with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentric hyperchromatic nuclei. A signet ring-like morphology was occasionally seen. A feature of this tumor was deeply-invasion into the lamina propria and muscularis propria. Tumor embolus were seen in some blood vessel. There was a common type of urothelial papillary carcinoma on the trigone of bladder. This tumor cells just invaded into the lamina propria of bladder,without involvement of the muscularis propria. Immunohistochemically,plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma cells were positive for CK7,CEA,CD138,and \u03b2-hCG,but negative for LCA,Kappa,Lambda,Syn,NSE and E-cadherin. The patient was treated by immunotherapy and intravesical epirubicin infusion after partial vesicoectomy and was free symptom at 5 months. Conclusion Plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is rare but has typically pathological,immunohistochemical and clinical features. Foci of common type urothelial carcinoma or carcinoma in situ could be seen. This type of the tumor should be differentiated from other tumors with plasmacytoid profiles. Immunohistochemistry may be helpful in the differential diagnosis.",

The civil capacity rating scale for mentally disabled patients was established and the manual was created according to the logistic sequence of the assessment. The rating scale was used during the civil assessment in four institutes.There were 14 items in civil capacity rating scale for mentally disabled patients. Two hundred and two subjects were recruited and divided into three groups according to the experts' opinion on their civil capacities: full civil capacity, partial civil capacity and no civil capacity. The mean score of the three groups were 2.32 +/- 2.45, 11.62 +/- 4.01 and 25.02 +/- 3.90, respectively, and there was statistical differences among the groups. The Cronbach alpha of the rating scale was 0.9724, and during the split-reliability test, the two-splited part of the rating scale were highly correlated (r = 0.9729, P = 0.000). The Spearman correlative coefficient between each item and the score of the rating scale was from 0.643 to 0.882 (P = 0.000). There was good correlation between the conclusion according to the rating scale and the experts' opinion (kappa = 0.841, P = 0.000). When the discriminate analysis was used, 7 items were included into the discrimination equation, and 92.6% subjects were identified as the correct groups using the equation.There is satisfied reliability and validity on civil capacity rating scale for mentally disabled patients. The rating scale can be used as effective tools to grade their civil capacity during the forensic expertise.",

        "abstract": "In China, the criminal responsibility of the mentally disordered offenders is divided into three levels, there are the whole responsibility, diminished responsibility and irresponsibility. According to the Criminal Law, \"If a mental disordered patient causes harmful consequences at a time when he is unable to recognize or control his own conduct, upon verification and confirmation through legal procedure, he shall not bear criminal responsibility.\" That means there are two standards of assessing criminal responsibility, namely volitional and cognitive capacity. It is as equal as the Mc'Naughton Rule and the Irresistible Impulse Test. But for a long time, the criminal responsibility was assessed mainly by experience because of lacking of standardized assessment instrument. Recently, we have developed \"the rating scale of criminal responsibility for mentally disordered offenders (RSCRs)\". The scale includes eighteen items, namely criminal motivation, aura before offense, inducement of crime, time and place and object and tool selectivity of crime, emotion during the crime, shirking responsibility after offense, concealing the truth during inquest, camouflage, understanding the nature of the offense, estimating the consequence of the offense, impairment of life ability, impairment of learning or work, impairment of insight, impairment of reality testing, and impairment of self-control. This scale can be applicable for all cases and easy to use. This scale had been tried out in several forensic psychiatry institutes, the Cronbach \u03b1 of the scale is 0.93, and all items have high correlation with the total score of the scale (r=0.50-0.89). Two factors were extracted by the factorial analysis, and the cumulative squared loading was 68.62%. The scores of the three levels were 9.66 \u00b1 5.11, 26.54 \u00b1 5.21 and 40.08 \u00b1 7.90 respectively and highly significant differences were observed among groups. By establishing discrimination analysis among three levels, classification results suggested that 88.90% of the original grouped cases were correctly classified, and the discriminant value had high conformity with the experts' opinions. The data showed that the scale would be the best validated instrument for the criminal responsibility in China.",

The patients' brain imaging, electroencephalogram (EEG) and detailed medical history were collected. Then to interview the patients' family members and to assess the patients' mental conditions with Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), Social Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS), and Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADL). Diagnosis and disability assessments were based on all of the above information.ADL and SDSS had good distinction between different levels of disability and different time. The overall sample demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference between patients' ADL and SDSS averages in 9 and 12 months. For mild disability, there was no statistically significant difference between ADL and SDSS averages in 6, 9 and 12 months. For moderate disability, there was no statistically significant difference between ADL and SDSS in 9 and 12 months. And there was no statistically significant difference between ADL and SDSS averages in 6, 9 and 12 months for severe disability.For mild disability, it is recommended to assess the mental disability 6 months after the injury, for moderate disability, it is 9 months. The statistics data recommended that the best assessment time for severe disability is 6 months after injury. However, our comprehensive analysis concludes that the suitable time is 9 months after injury.",

Goodfellow case as a basis to make the standard criteria including: the understanding of the nature of a will and codicil, the knowledge of the general extent of one's assets, the knowledge of the natural object of one's bounty, the understanding of the impact of the distribution of the assets of the estate, and the absence of a delusion specifically affecting the distribution of the estate. The impact factors of the testamentary capacity, including dementia, mood disorder, schizophrenia, alcohol, drug, and undue influence, etc., are summarized. Lastly, the related assessment tools such as the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Clock-Drawing Test, and the Testament Definition Scale are introduced briefly.",

        "abstract": "Angiopoietin (Ang) is one of the major effectors of angiogenesis, playing a critical role in neurovascular remodeling after stroke. Acupuncture has been widely used for treating stroke in China for a long time. Recently, we have demonstrated that electroacupuncture (EA) can accelerate intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)-induced angiogenesis in rats. In the present study, we investigated the effect of EA on the expression of Ang-1 and Ang-2 in the brain after ICH.ICH was induced by stereotactic injection of collagenase type VII into the right globus pallidus. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into the following four groups: sham-operation (SHAM), stroke-no electroacupuncture (SNE), stroke-EA at the Zusanli acupoint (SEZ), and stroke-EA at a nonacupoint (SEN). EA was applied to the bilateral Zusanli (ST36) acupoint in the SEZ group and a nonacupoint in the SEN group. The expression of Ang-1 and Ang-2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).Some Ang-1 and Ang-2 immunoreactive microvessels with a dilated outline were detected in the perihematomal tissues after ICH, and the vessels extended into the clot from the surrounding area since day 7. The expression of Ang-1 increased notably as long as 2 weeks after ICH, while Ang-2 immunoreactivity declined at about 7 days following a striking upregulation at 3 days. EA at the Zusanli (ST36) acupoint upregulated the expression of Ang-1 and Ang-2 at both the protein and mRNA levels. However, EA at a nonacupoint had little effect on the expression of Ang-1 and Ang-2.Our data suggest that EA at the Zusanli (ST36) acupoint exerts neuroprotective effects on hemorrhagic stroke by upregulation of Ang-1 and Ang-2.",

Methods: The experiment was completed, in Institute of Combined Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between March and November in 2005. Totally 15 healthy SD rats randomly divided into 3 groups: 0.002 5 MTX external application group (n =5), 0.005 flexible nanonipsomes of MTX for external application group (n =5) and the 0.002 5 flexible nanonipsomes of MTX for external application group (n =5). Rat keratoderma was evenly coated with 1.5 g of flexible nanonipsomes of MTX for external application (the quality fraction was 0.002 5), 0.75 g of flexible nanonipsomes of MTX for external application (the quality fraction was 0.005) and 1.5 g of MTX for external application (the quality fraction was 0.002 5) respectively by using Franz diffusion cell (MTX were all 3.75 mg.). 0.45-um micropore film was used for filtering on the 2nd, 4th, 8th, 10th and 12th hours. The filtrate was attenuated to 10 ml with normal saline, and the absorbance on 306 nm was determined. Subtracting the absorbance of the physiologic saline, we used the absorbance in standard curve to compute the accumulated transmit dose and the accumulated transmissivity of 12 hours. Differences among 3 kinds of preparations were compared. Results: The accumulated transmit dose and the accumulated transmissivity of 12 hours of the flexible nanonipsomes of MTX for external application, 0.002 5 and 0.005 flexible nanonipsomes of MTX for external application were higher than those of MTX for external application, and the differences were significant [The accumulated transmissivity of 12 hours respectively were (67.51\u00b10.37)%, (72.79\u00b10.03)%, (24.50\u00b10.08)%,t = 325.71,247.24,P < 0.01]. While there was no remarkable difference in accumulated transmit dose and the accumulated transmissivity of 12 hours between 0.002 5 and 0.005 flexible nanonipsomes of MTX for external application groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Flexible nanonipsomes of MTX for external application can penetrate through the skin more effectively than the common formulation.",

        "abstract": "Aim. To investigate effects of the traditional Chinese medicine complex Naoyi' an granule (NYA) on the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in astrocytes of intracerebral hemorrhagic (ICH) rats. Methods. One hundred SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation group (n = 25) and operation group (n = 75). The rats of operation group underwent ollagenase VII injection into the pallidum to construct the ICH models and then subdivided into three groups of 25 rats: model group (normal saline was infused into the stomach), herb group (Naoyi' an in the form of extract was infused) and AG group (aminoguanidine, specific iNOS inhibitor, was injected intraperitoneally). The rats were killed 12, 24 hours, 2, 4, and 7 days after the beginning of experiment and their brains were taken. Double-label immunofluorescence method and Western blotting were conducted to observe the iNOS expression in the brains. Results. The expression of iNOS was mainly located at the tissues around the hematoma in basal gangion. Western blotting showed that in the model group the expression of iNOS began to be increased 12 hours after the operation (t = 15.3, P <0.01), peaked 4 days after (t = 36.4, P < 0.01), and began to be decreased 7 days after (t = 27.73, P < 0.01). However these values of iNOS expression at different tome points in the model group were higher than those in the NYA group and AG group respectively. Conclusion. The expression of iNOS increases in astrocytes of basal ganglion following ICH, and inhibition of astrocytic iNOS expression may be one of the brain-protecting mechanisms of NYA.",

        "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and activation of the apoptotic cascade. In the study, we investigated the effects of salvianolic acid B (Sal B) on 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-treated SH-SY5Y cells, a classic in vitro model for PD. We found Sal B inhibited the loss of cell viability by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The underlying mechanisms of Sal B action were further studied. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with MPP+ caused a loss of cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential, condensation of nuclei, elevation in the level of reactive oxygen species (which was associated with cytochrome c release), an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA ratio, and activation of caspase-3. Sal B ameliorated the MPP+ -altered phenotypes. These results indicate that the Sal B protected SH-SY5Y cells against MPP+ -induced apoptosis by relieving oxidative stress and modulating the apoptotic process. Our findings suggest that salvianolic acid B may be a promising agent to prevent PD. \u00a9 2010 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",

Angiogenesis, an orchestrated balance between proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors, is a fundamental process to brain development and repair by new blood vessel formation from preexisting ones and can be induced by ICH. Thrombospondin (TSP)\u20131 and TSP-2 are naturally occurring antiangiogenic factors. The aim of this study was to observe their expression in rat brains with ICH.Intracerebral hemorrhage was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by stereotactic injection of collagenase VII or autologous blood into the right globus pallidus. The expression of TSP-1 and -2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction analysis.After the induction of ICH, some TSP1- or TSP2-immunoreactive microvessels resided around the hematoma for ~ 7 days and extended into a clot thereafter. Cerebral endothelial cells expressed the TSPs. The expression of TSP-1 and TSP-2 mRNA peaked at 4 and 14 days after collagenase-induced ICH, respectively.Findings in this study suggest that ICH can alter the expression of TSP-1 and TSP-2, which may be involved in modulating angiogenesis in brains following ICH.",

        "abstract": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a fatal subtype of stroke that lacks effective treatments. Angiogenesis following ICH is an important response mediating brain recovery and repair. Phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (pVEGFR2) via PI3K/Akt signaling plays a key role in mediating cellular processes involved in repair, such as mitogenesis, angiogenesis, and vascular permeability. This study aimed to investigate the potential effects of Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD), a traditional Chinese medicine formula, on angiogenesis by VEGFR2 activation through the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway in a mouse model of ICH.Adult male Kunming mice (n\u2009=\u200950) were randomly assigned into sham and ICH-operated groups and treated with one of the followings SU5416 (VEGFR2 inhibitor), BYHWT and BYHWT\u2009+\u2009SU5416. ICH was induced in mice by injecting collagenase (type VII) into the right globus pallidus of the mouse brain. BYHWD (4.36 g/kg) was administrated in mice by intragastric infusion. Neurological function was evaluated in mice by a modified Neurological Severity Scores (mNSS) as well as corner turn and foot-fault tests. Angiogenesis was examined by intraperitoneal injection of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in mice to quantify new brain vessel growth. SU5416 treatment and assessment of VEGFR2 phosphorylation as well as alterations in PI3K/Akt signaling were performed to determine whether the effect of BYHWD on angiogenesis was partly mediated by phosphorylation of VEGFR2 via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.We show that BYHWD treated mice exhibited (i) significantly better recovery from neurological dysfunction, (ii) increased BrdU(+) nuclei in vWF(+) dilated brain vessels and (iii) higher VEGFR2 phosphorylation immunoreactivity in brain microvessels (P <0.05), (iv) higher expression of PI3K and pAkt at the protein level (P <0.05) when compared to untreated ICH mice. These beneficial effects were reversed by SU5416 (P <0.05).BYHWD promoted neurological recovery and angiogenesis after ICH in mice by enhancing VEGFR2 phosphorylation through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "Although Buyang-Huanwu-Decoction (BYHWD), a famous traditional Chinese medicine, has been utilized to promote the recovery of neurological function in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) for centuries, its therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. tRNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA) is a novel class of short non-coding RNA, possessing potential regulating functions. In the current study, we explored the novel therapeutic targets of BYHWD by tsRNA-sequencing. Rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham, ICH, and BYHWD-treated groups. The modified neurological severity score, corner turn test, foot-fault test, and weight change were used to assess neurological injury. After BYHWD treatment, these behavioral tests were obviously meliorated compared with ICH group in the recovery phase. In the rat brain tissues surrounding the hemorrhagic region, a total of 350 tsRNAs for exact match were identified. 12 of tRNAs (fold change >1.3 and -value <0.05) were significantly changed in ICH group compared to sham group. Among them, 3 of tRNAs (rno-tRFi-Ser-25a, rno-tRF5-Ala-16a and rno-tRF5-Glu-29a) were markedly regulated by BYHWD treatment and validated with quantitative real-time PCR. Additionally, target prediction and bioinformatics analyses revealed that these tsRNAs could play therapeutic roles through FoxO signaling pathway, positive regulation of long term synaptic depression, autophagy - animal, IL-17 signaling pathway and regulation of cytoskeleton and transforming growth factor beta. In conclusion, tsRNAs are the potential therapeutic targets of BYHWD on ICH treatment. The present study provides novel insights for future investigations to explore the mechanisms, by which BYHWD promotes neurological function recovery after ICH.",

Methods The ICH model was made with injecting \u2166type collagenase stereotaxically into the globas pallidus of rats. The expression of activated Caspase-3 was examined with Immunohistochemical methods, and the degree of the hematoma was measured at different time. Results The peak value of positive cells around the hematoma was the most at 1st day, then descended at 2nd days and descended distinctly at 7th days compared with the fake group, which was different evidently(P<0.01). The number of positive cells of the BHO group was obviously smaller than that of the model group at 4th d?7th d (P<0.05), the hematoma was the biggest at 1st d, smaller at 2nd d and the smallest at 7th d. The hematoma in treatment group became smaller obviously than that did in model group at 4th d and 7th d(P<0.05). Conclusion The expression of activated Caspase-3 increased obviously in the neuron around the hematoma after ICH, but BHD can markedly decrease the expression of activated Caspase-3, prohibit neuronal apoptosis, and promote the absorption of the hematoma.",

        "abstract": "Aim: To study the changes in serum interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) in rats with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after externally administrated with methotrexate (MTX) made by flexible nanonipsomes. Methods: The experiment was conducted in the Institute of Combined Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine, Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between March and November 2005. Totally 80 healthy SD rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: Normal control group (n=10), while other 70 rats were made into RA models by subcutaneous injection of type II collagen and complete Freund Adjuvant, and then randomly divided into model group (n=10), 0.5% MTX group (n=20), 0.25% flexible nanonipsomes MTX group (n=20) and 0.5% flexible nanonipsomes MTX group (n=20). Rats in the normal control group drank water freely; rats in the model group were perfused with 1.5 mL of distilled water once a day. Rats in other groups were administered at 7 days after primary immunization, and then were externally painted with 0.5% MTX, 0.25% flexible nanonipsomes MTX and 0.5% flexible nanonipsomes MTX on the right postpedes respectively with 2.0 g to 4.0 g for each rat (according to the size of the articles) once a week. Articular symptoms were evaluated with the integral of arthritis index, and the higher the index was, the severer the arthritis was. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was adopted to detect the level of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 in the serum of rats on the 45th day after administration. Results: Totally 80 enrolled rats all entered the final analysis. 1 There was no significant difference in the integral of arthritis index at 14 days before administration among all groups, while with the time prolonging, the integral of arthritis index in the model group increased and peaked in the 0.5% MTX group, 0.25% flexible nanonipsomes MTX group and 0.5% flexible nanonipsomes MTX group, but they were still lower than that in the model group (which were 1.51\u00b10.99, 0.98\u00b10.57, 0.88\u00b10.49, 1.68\u00b11.24, t =2.956, 5.461, 5.244, P < 0.01 respectively). 2 Forty-five days after administration, the level of IFN-\u03b3 in the model group, 0.5% MTX group, 0.25% flexible nanonipsomes MTX group and 0.5% flexible nanonipsomes MTX group were obviously higher than that in the normal control group, whereas the level of IL-4 was obviously lower than that in the normal control group [IFN-\u03b3: (120.75\u00b11.43), (104.41\u00b11.71), (88.75\u00b11.58), (83.60\u00b11.86), (56.15\u00b12.07)ng/L, t =-64.016, -67.970, -36.928, -48.092, P < 0.01; IL-4: (23.28\u00b10.13), (36.45\u00b10.15), (46.46\u00b10.16), (48.47\u00b10.12), (61.23\u00b10.27)ng/L, t = 398.098, 328.973, 179.924, 186.796, P < 0.01]. The level of IFN-\u03b3 in 0.5% MTX group, 0.25% flexible nanonipsomes MTX group and 0.5% flexible nanonipsomes MTX group were obviously lower than that in the model group (t =21.387, 46.365, 43.639, P < 0.01), and the level of IL-4 was significantly higher than that in the model group (t =-238.74, -514.575, -385.096, P < 0.01). The level of IFN-\u03b3 in 0.25% flexible nanonipsomes MTX group and the 0.5% flexible nanonipsomes MTX group were obviously lower than that in 0.5% MTX group (t =36.581, 30.124, P < 0.01), while the level of IL-4 were remarkably higher (t =-282.406, -203.685, P < 0.01). The levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 in 0.25% flexible nanonipsomes MTX group were not significantly different from those in 0.5% flexible nanonipsomes MTX group (P > 0.05). Conclusion: External using of flexible nanonipsomes MTX can down-regulate IFN-\u03b3 and up-regulate the level of IL-4 through its intelligent controlled releasing, and the effect is obviously better than normal external application of MTX.",

        "abstract": "Aim: To study the effect of naoyian on the expression of activated cysteinyl aspartate specific protease-3(activated Caspase-3) of neural stem cells (NSCs) infuced by anoxia and apoptosis and to explore its mechanism on brain protection. Methods: NSCs taken from rats and cultured in solution were used to establish anoxia model. Normal rat serum and rat serum containing naoyian were used to intervene NSCs after anoxia. The expression of activated Capase-3 in anoxic NSCs and normal NSCs were detected while the apoptosis was examined with terminal(TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling(TUNEL). Results: TUNEL positive cells expressed more in the normal serum group with NSCs after anoxia and the serum-free group with NSCs after anoxia, while less in NYA serum group with NSCs after anoxia and none in the NSCs without anoxia. The TUNEL positive cells expressed less in naoyian serum group with NSCs after anoxia than those in the normal serum group with NSCs after anoxia and the serum-free group with NSCs after anoxia, and the differences were significant(t = 6.582 6, 6.624 5, P < 0.05). The absorbance of the activited Caspase-3 in NYA serum group was lower than that in the normal serum group and serum-free group separately. The differences were significant(t = 4.265 3, 5.013 1, P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the serum-free group and the normal serum group with NSCs after anoxia(t = 0.519 0, 0.265 7, P > 0.05). Conclusion: Serum containing naoyian can intervene NSC injured by anoxia, decrease the activity of Caspase-3 and decrease the apoptosis of NSCs after anoxia, and therefore protect brain.",

        "title": "Cerebral angiogenesis after collagenase-induced intracerebral hemorrhage in rats.",
        "abstract": "Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most devastating subtypes of stroke. Since angiogenesis is a fundamental process to brain development and repair by new blood vessel formation from pre-existing ones, mediated by numerous angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the goal of the present work is to establish whether there is cerebral angiogenesis in rat brains with collagenase-induced ICH. Investigations were also performed to evaluate whether ICH alters expression of VEGF and its receptors Flt-1 and Flk-1. ICH was induced on adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by stereotactic injection of collagenase type VII into right globus pallidus. Angiogenesis was identified by hematoxylin-eosin stain and double immunolabeling method, and expression of VEGF and the receptors was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. New vessels appeared around the hematoma and extended into it from 7 days, and 5-Bromo-2-Deoxyuridine-labeled nuclei in cerebral endothelial cells resided around the hematoma and the labeling peaked from 7 to 14 days. Expression of VEGF, Flt-1 and Flk-1 was observed in cerebral endothelial cells at the hemorrhagic basal ganglion, and increases of their mRNA persisted to 28 days. These findings suggest that ICH can induce cerebral angiogenesis and upregulation of VEGF, Flt-1 and Flk-1 and that modulation of angiogenesis via altering expression of VEGF and its receptors may be a potential strategy for promoting ICH repair.",

        "abstract": "Many researchers suggest that adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is incapable of completing self-repair or regeneration. And there are accumulating lines of evidence which suggest that endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) are activated in many pathological conditions, including stroke in the past decades, which might partly account for rehabilitation afterwards. In this study, we investigated whether there was endogenous neural stem cell activation in intracerebral hemorrhagic (ICH) rat brains.After ICH induction by stereotactical injection of collagenase type VII into globus pallidus, 5-Bromo-2 Deoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered intraperitoneally to label newborn cells. Immunohistochemical method was used to detect Nestin, a marker for neural stem cells, and BrdU.Nestin-positive or BrdU-Labeled cells were predominantly located at 2 sites: basal ganglion around hemotoma, ependyma and nearby subventricular zone (SVZ). No positive cells for the 2 markers were found in the 2 sites of normal control group and sham group, as well as in non-leisioned parenchyma, both hippocampi and olfactory bulbs in the 4 groups. Nestin+ cells presented 4 types of morphology, and BrdU+ nucleus were polymorphologic. Positive cell counting around hemotoma showed that at day 2, Nestin+ cells were seen around hemotoma in model group, the number of which increased at day 4, day 7 (P <0.01), peaked at day 14 (P <0.05), and reduced significantly by day 28 (P <0.01).Endogenous neural stem cells were activated in experimental intracerebral hemorrhagic rat brains.",

        "abstract": "Aim: To investigate the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of the nanoliposomes loaded with diclofenac sodium to the rats with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and evaluate the local drug absorption improved by nanoliposomes as a new skin administration carrier. Methods: The experiment was completed in the Institute of Combined Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from March through November in 2005. Totally 80 SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: normal control group, voltaren group, and other two treatment groups containing 5% and 10% of nanoliposomes load with diclofenac sodium, respectively. Each group consisted of 20 rats, including 10 rats for analgesic test and 10 for anti-inflammatory test. 1 Analgesic tests: Hot-plate test was conducted by painting corresponding drugs on double behind feet, 0.5 g each foot in 6-minute interval for 5 times continuously. At 5, 10, 15, 25 minutes after the last treatment, the times of licking foot were examined. Writhing test was conducted by painting corresponding drugs on abdominal skin, 20 minutes later, intraperitoneal injection of 0.6% acetic acid solution was given 0.01 mL/g. At 1, 2, 4, 6 hours after the treatment, the times of writhing was recorded within 20 minutes and the inhibition ratio of writhing was calculated according to [(writhing times of normal control group-writhing times of treatment group)/writhing times of normal control group]\u00d7l00%. Formalin-induced licking test was conducted by painting corresponding drugs on right behind feet, once 10 minutes, which was followed by subcutaneous injection of 2.5% formalin, 30 \u03bcL. Then the times of licking foot was recorded within 10 minutes. 2 Anti-inflammatory test: RA model was established by collagen II and complete Freund's adjuvant in three treatment groups, while no management was given for the normal control group. Rats in each group were painted with corresponding drugs in the right behind feet, about 0.5-1.0 g (according to the size of the articles, clinical dose was defined as 100-150 mg/d), three times daily. The perimeter of the ankle joint of the model rats' right behind feet was measured in the 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, 35th days. Results: All of 80 rats were enrolled in the final analysis. Compared with normal group, other 3 treatment groups investigated had relatively good analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Among them, better analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects were found in the groups containing the drug-loaded nanoliposomes, in particular in the group containing 10% of the drug-loaded nanoliposomes. Conclusion: The use of the nanoliposomes as the carrier for diclofenac sodium improves the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects.",

Sixty-five panel reactive antibody (PRA) positive SD rats were selected by lymphocytotoxicity methods. The PRA positive rats were made into intracerebral hemorrhagic model and divided into three groups: cerebral hemorrhage group (n=15), NSCs transplanted group (n=25) and XHBSD group (n=25). XHBSD was orally administered after 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-marked NSCs were transplanted in brains of rats with intracerebral hemorrhage in the XHBSD group. Rats in the other two groups were administered distilled water. The expressions of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) mRNAs were measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); the numbers of BrdU and 200 kD neurofilament (NF200) positive cells were detected by double-labeling immunofluorescence method.The expression of IFN-gamma mRNA was down-regulated significantly in the XHBSD group, but the expression of IL-4 mRNA was up-regulated significantly (P<0.05). The numbers of BrdU and NF200 positive cells were also increased remarkably in the XHBSD group.XHBSD can promote the survival and differentiation of transplanted NSCs, which may be related to inducing the expression of IL-4 mRNA and inhibiting the expression of IFN-gamma mRNA.",

        "abstract": "Neurogenesis and angiogenesis can improve the neurologic function after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) plays an important role in neurogenesis and angiogenesis. In this study, a rat model of autologous blood-induced ICH was used to evaluate the effect of LIF on the neurogenesis and angiogenesis following ICH. After ICH, LIF-positive neurons and dilated vessels were detected in the peri-hematomal region. It was found that LIF levels increased significantly and peaked 14 days after ICH induction. Double immunofluorescence confirmed that LIF was expressed in neurons and endothelial cells. ICH also led to increases of doublecortin (DCX)- and von Willebrand factor (vWF)-positive cells as well as proliferation of cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)+/DCX+ and PCNA+/vWF+ nuclei. All these ICH-induced increases were significantly attenuated by exogenous LIF infusion. These data suggested that LIF was a negative regulator of neurogenesis and angiogenesis after ICH.",

        "abstract": "Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most severe types of stroke. Thrombin has been reported to participate in brain repair following ICH and play an important role in angiogenesis. Our previous studies have shown that ICH induces angiogenesis in damaged rat brain, accompanied by upregulation of expression of thrombospondin (TSP)-1 and TSP-2. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the expression of TSP-1 and TSP-2 was regulated by thrombin in rat brain following ICH. A rat model of ICH was induced by injection of autologous blood into the right globus pallidus (GP). Hirudin, a thrombin specific inhibitor, or thrombin was injected into the GP. Immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot assays were applied. Results showed that ICH induced an increase in the expression of TSP-1 mRNA and TSP-2 mRNA after ICH, whereas hirudin significantly inhibited the expression of TSPs mRNA after ICH (P<0.05). In contrast, sole thrombin treatment in normal rats induced strong expression of TSP-1 or TSP-2 in the blood vessels around the damaged brain region when compared with those without thrombin treatment. Western blot analysis data confirmed that the protein levels of TSPs were significantly increased when compared with those in the sham control group (P<0.01). These findings support that thrombin positively regulates the expression of TSP-1 and TSP-2 after ICH, which may be involved in modulating angiogenesis in injured brains following ICH.",

Bcl-2 and Bax expressions in the rat brain after ICH were detected by immunohistochemistry method.Bax expressed in the hemorrhagic core, and the immunoreactive neurons were seriously injuried and the shape varied. Bcl-2 expressed in the penumbra with the normal shape of the immunoreactive neurons. Both Bax and Bcl-2 expressed simultaneously in the marginal region of the cerebral hemorrhagic core. Bcl-2 expression in the rat brain reached the peak at the 2nd day and maintained at a relatively high level until the 7th day, and NYA could increase it. Bax expression peaked at the 1st day, and NYA could down-regulate it.The expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax after the cerebral hemorrhage are related to the degree of injury, the time, and the location of the brain tissues. NYA can up-regulate the Bcl-2 expression and down-regulate the Bax expression, which may be one of its neuroprotective mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To observe the effects of hyperbaric oxygen(HBO) on the behavioral changes and the mechanism of angiogenesis in the intracerebral hemorrhage rats in order to further explain the pathological and physiological bases of HBO on cerebral hemorrhage.Methods: Eighty SD rat intracerebral hemorrhage models were randomly assigned to model group(n=40) and HBO group(n=40).The rats in HBO group were subjected to HBO treatment with the pressure of 0.20 MPa,once every day,60 min.On the postoperative day 4,7,14,21 and 28 day,8 rats in each group were randomly chosen respectively for observation and scoring of the behavioral changes.Three animals were randomly selected and killed by decapitation.The expression of HIF-1\u03b1 around the hematoma region after intracerebral hemorrhage was detected by immunohistochemistry.Results: The intracerebral hemorrhage rats showed abnormal behavioral changes to varying degrees in both groups after operation.On the postoperative day 4,7 and 14,there was no significant difference in three assessments(the score of Langa,the score of Berderson and the balance beam walking test) between two groups.On the postoperative day 21 and 28,scores of three assessments in HBO group were significantly lower than in model group(P<0.05).In HBO group the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 around the hematoma region after intracerebral hemorrhage was higher than in model group at the same time point.The expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in model group reached the peak at the 4th day,then showed a decreased tendency,and that in HBO group showed an increased tendency at the 4th day,then reduced at the 28th day.Conclusion: The expression of HIF-1\u03b1 around the hematoma region after intracerebral hemorrhage was increased.HBO could increase the expression of HIF-1\u03b1,subsequently promoting the expression of VEGF,advancing the absorption of hematoma and angiogenesis,and improving the recovery of neurologica function of intracerebral hemorrhage rats.",

The present study aimed to clarify whether thrombin is involved in triggering ICH-related angiogenesis.In the first part of the experiment, autologous blood (with or without hirudin) was injected to induce ICH. In the second part, rats received either 1 U (50 \u03bcl) thrombin or 50 \u03bcl 0.9% sterile saline. In both parts, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered intraperitoneally.

The expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and Ang-2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.After ICH, the number of BrdU-/vWF-positive nuclei increased until Day 14, and vessels positive for HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF, Ang-1, and Ang-2 were observed around the clot. Quantitative analysis showed that ICH upregulated expression of HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF, Ang-1, and Ang-2 notably compared with that in sham controls (p < 0.05). However, hirudin significantly inhibited these effects. After thrombin treatment, many BrdU-positive/vWF-positive nuclei and HIF-1\u03b1-, VEGF-, Ang-1- and Ang-2-positive vessels could be detected around the affected region.Thrombin can induce angiogenesis in rat brains and may be an important trigger for ICH-related angiogenesis.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the mechanisms of Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD) by observing its effects on expressions of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and the endothelial-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (Tie-2) mRNA in damaged region of rats' brain after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).One hundred and sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups, 10 in the normal control group, 60 in the sham-operative group, 60 in the ICH model group, and 30 in the BYHWD-treated group. The ICH model was established by injecting collagenase type VII 0.5 U stereotaxically into right globus pallidus. Animals in the BYHWD-treated group were administered orally with BYHWD, while animals in the sham-operative group and the ICH model group were administered orally with equal volume distilled water, and those in the normal control group drank water freely. The positional variations of the expression of Ang-1 and Tie-2 in the sham-operative group and the model group were assayed by immunohistochemistry on dayl, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after modeling, in the meantime, the dynamic changes of Ang-1 and Tie-2 mRNA expressions in all groups were assayed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).No significant expression of Ang-1 and Tie-2 in brain of rats in the normal or the sham-operative group was found during the experiment. In the model group, the Ang-1 and Tie-2 positive micrangio-segments appeared at the edge of clot on day 1 to day 4, they gradually penetrated to hematoma area from day 7; with Ang-1 and Tie-2 mRNA expressed from day 1, but very weak until day 4, showing no significant difference to that on day 1; thereafter, they increased gradually, and reached the peak on day 28 (P <0.05). While the two expressions in the BYHWD treated group reached the peak on day 21, and from day 7 to day 28, they were all significantly higher than those in ICH model group at the corresponding time points (P <0.01).BYHWD can promote the up-regulation of Ang-1 and Tie-2mRNA expressions in brain of intracerebral hemorrhagic rats, which might accelerate the angiogenesis in the reconstruction of microvascular network in the damaged zone, and thus facilitating the repairing of damaged tissue.",

Methods: NSCs were dissociated from the hippocampus of neonatal rats (3 days old) and divided into blank group(treated with basic culture medium of NSCs), experimental group(treated with 50 mL/L naoyian serum added into basic NSCs) and control group(treated with 50 mL/L normal serum added into basic NSCs) according to different culture ways. Then they were cultured in the medium containing 50 mL/L naoyian serum. Variations of Nestin, NF-200, glial fibrillery acidic protein(GFAP), 04 immunity positive cells were analyzed with immunocytochemical method at the second and seventh day of cultivation. Results: At the second day of cultivation, in the blank group, the number of Nestin positive cells was the most(96.17% of all cells), which was 8-11 times more than that of the experimental group and control group; The secondary was the number of GFAP and 04 cells; The number of NF-200 cells were the least(3. 83% of all cells). In the experimental group, the number of NF-200 cells was the most (42.83% of all cells), which was 11.3 times and 1.2 times more than that of the blank group and the control group respectively; The secondary was the number of GFAP cells, which was less than that of the control group. At the seventh day of cultivation, in the blank group, the number of Nestin positive cells was still the most, while the number of the other three kinds of cells had no significant difference as compared with that at the second day. In the experimental group, the number of NF-200 cells was still the most (43.85% of all cells); The secondary was the number of GFAP and 04 cells; The number of Nestin was the least. After 7-day cultivation, the death rate of cells in the experimental group(4.85%) was significantly different from that of the control group (15.32%) (\u03c72 = 6.04, P < 0.05). Conclusion: Naoyian can induce NSCs to differentiate into neurons and promote the survival of nerve cells.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To investigate the mechanismsof Zusanli(ST36) in intracerebral hemorrhage.Methods:96 rats were randomly divided into the sham operation group,the sham acupuncture group,the intracerebral hemorrhage group and the acupuncture group with 24 in each group. The intracerebral hemorrhage model was established by injected 0. 5U collagenase type \u2166 stereotaxically into globus pallidus in rats. The acupuncture group was needled Zusanli(ST36) . The sham acupuncture group was stimulated non-acupoints skins. The positional variations of the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) and the VEGF mRNA were observed at the 3th,7th and 14th day after model establishment. Results:There were no obvious VEGF expressions in different time points of the sham operation group. In the 3th day,a plenty of the microvessel with positive VEGF around the hematoma area were observed in the intracerebral hemorrhage group,the sham operation group and the acupuncture group. In the 7th day,these microvessels with positive VEGF were digging into the hematoma area. And then,they were appeared in this area. After detected by the RT-PCR,there were no obvious expressions of VEGF mRNA in the sham operation group. Its expression was more remarkable in the 3 days after intracerebral hemorrhage. This condition was lasted to the 14th day. In every time point,the VEGF mRNA expressions of the acupuncture group were significantly higher than those of the intracerebral hemorrhage group. Nevertheless,this expression in the sham acupuncture group was approximate to the intracerebral hemorrhage group. Conclusion:Needing Zusanli(ST36) do not promote the VEGF expression in the intracerebral hemorrhage rats,but also repair the injury of the microvessel of the hemorrhage damage area. This could be realized by the reconstruction of the vessel system.",

        "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and activation of the apoptotic cascade. In the study, we investigated the effects of salvianolic acid B (Sal B) on 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-treated SH-SY5Y cells, a classic in vitro model for PD. We found Sal B inhibited the loss of cell viability by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The underlying mechanisms of Sal B action were further studied. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with MPP(+) caused a loss of cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential, condensation of nuclei, elevation in the level of reactive oxygen species (which was associated with cytochrome c release), an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA ratio, and activation of caspase-3. Sal B ameliorated the MPP(+)-altered phenotypes. These results indicate that the Sal B protected SH-SY5Y cells against MPP(+)-induced apoptosis by relieving oxidative stress and modulating the apoptotic process. Our findings suggest that salvianolic acid B may be a promising agent to prevent PD.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the mechanisms of Yi-Qi Huo-Xue therapy (YQHX) by observing its effects on angiogenesis and hematoma absorption of brains in rats with intracerebral hemorrhage. Methods: ICH model was induced by injecting collagenase type \u2166. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 6 groups, including normal control group, sham group, ICH model group, Yiqi-treated group, HuoXue-treated group and YQHX-treated group. Animals were randomly chosen to be perfused with paraformaldehyde at the postoperative day 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. Angiogenesis was observed by argentation. Image pro plus 5.0 software was used to measure the areas of hematomas. Results: Argentation revealed during 14-28 days, YQHX-treated group had more new vessels surrounding and inside hematomas; New vessels began to regression in all groups at 28th day. The areas of hematoma were largest in model group and HuoXue-treated group at first day. The hematoma in YQHX-treated group was observed more quickly than in other groups during 7-35 days (P<0.01) and disappeared in some slices at 35th day. Conclusion: The YQHX therapy could accelerate the absorption of hematoma and promote cerebral repair of ICH rats, which might be related with the increased phagotrophic function of macrophages and enhanced angiogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effects of electro-acupuncture on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)-induced angiogenesis and hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) expression in rats. Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups of 24 rats each. ICH was induced in 3 groups by stereotactic injection of collagenase type VII into the right globus pallidus; of these, one group was not further treated, the second group underwent Zusanli (ST36)-acupuncture, and the third group underwent non-acupoint acupuncture. The fourth group underwent sham operations. Acupuncture was performed by stimulation with electrical needles at frequencies of 2-20 Hz for 30 min per day. Angiogenesis on days 3, 7 and 14 was assessed by double immunolabeling, and expression of HIF-1\u03b1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, quantitative real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Results: 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled nuclei in cerebral endothelial cells (ECs) resided around the hematoma and the labeling peaked from 7 to 14 days (P<0.01). HIF-1\u03b1 positive microvessels with a dilated outline were detected in perihematomal tissues after ICH, with the vessels extending into the clot from the surrounding area beginning on day 7. Following ICH, HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels increased (P<0.05), but HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels did not change. Electro-acupuncture at the Zusanli (ST36) acupoint increased BrdU-labeled nuclei in cerebral ECs (P<0.05) and up-regulated the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 protein (P<0.05), but had little effect on the spatial distribution of HIF-1\u03b1 or on HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels. Conclusions: Electro-acupuncture treatment at the Zusanli (ST36) acupoint may accelerate ICH-induced angiogenesis by up-regulating HIF-1\u03b1 protein, and may enhance recovery following hemorrhagic cerebral injury. \u00a9 2013 Chinese Association of the Integration of Traditional and Western Medicine and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

        "abstract": "Damage of blood-brain barrier is a common result of traumatic brain injury. This damage can open the blood-brain barrier and allow drug passage. An ultraperformance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method was established to determine the concentration of rhein in the biofluids (plasma and cerebrospinal fluid) of patients with a compromised blood-brain barrier following traumatic brain injury after rhubarb administration. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic profiles were analyzed. A triple-quadruple tandem mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization was used for rhein detection. The mass transition followed was m/z 283.06\u2192239.0. The calibration curve was linear in the concentration range of 10-8000 ng/mL for the biofluids. The intra- and interday precisions were less than 10%. The relative standard deviation of recovery was less than 15% in biological matrices. The pharmacokinetic data showed that rhein was rapidly transported into biofluids, and exhibited a peak concentration 1 h after rhubarb administration. The elimination rate of rhein was slow. The AUCcerebrospinal fluid /AUCplasma (AUC is area under curve) of rhein was approximately 17%, indicating that portions of rhein could pass the impaired blood-brain barrier. The method was successfully applied to quantify rhein in the biofluids of all patients. The data presented can help to guide clinical applications of rhubarb for treating traumatic brain injury.",

Methods Volunteers were divided into an experiment group ( n = 38) and a control group ( n - 3 3 ) by random sampling and double blind method. The experiment group received intensive insulin therapy and the control group received traditional therapy. The arterial blood gas samples of all the patients at different time points after the operation were harvested in the intensive care unit for blood gas analysis. The related data were collected and analyzed. Results The serum glucose level in the 2 groups decreased firstly, then increased, and recovered finally.The serum lactic acid level in the 2 groups increased firstly, decreased later, then reincreased, and recovered finally. The highest level of the serum lactic acid was found 2 hours after the operation. There were significant differences in serum glucose and lactic acid levels at 2, 12, and 24 h after the operation in the two groups ( P < 0. 01 ) . The other data were not significant ( P > 0. 05 ) .

Fifteen rats underwent sham operation. MSCs were isolated from several Wistar rats by density gradient centrifugation, purified, and transfected with pcDNA3.1-hVEGF165 or blank plasmid pcDNA3.1 respectively using the liposome mediated method. ELISA, Western blotting, and RT-PCR were used to detect the protein and mRNA expression of hVEG in these MSCs Forty-eight surviving rats that underwent ligation were randomly divided into 4 equal groups: combination group (Combo group) to be injected into the heart infarct zone with suspension of hVEGF165-transfected MSCs 2 weeks after the establishment of the model, cell group to be injected with suspension of MSCs not transfected with VEGF, gene group to be injected with suspension of DNA-liposome containing pcDNA3.1-VEGF165 and control group to be injected with cold culture fluid only. Twelve surviving rats that underwent sham operation were used as normal non-ischemic group. Four weeks after the injection the surviving rats underwent examination of heart functions by the Buxco system. The rats were killed and their hearts were taken out to undergo immunohistochemistry with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (Brdu) and troponin T and factor VIII to measure the area of cardiac infarction and the capillary density. RT-PCR was used to examine the mRNA expression of VEGF. The heart infarcted size was calculated by Evan's blue staining.(1) MSCs can be successfully isolated and cultured by density gradient centrifugation followed by adherence-separation. The expression of hVEGF165 in the transfected MSCs was demonstrated with ELISA, RT-PCR and Western Blot Assay. (2) Four weeks after the cells were transplanted, among all groups but the nonischemic group, the heart infarcted size of the Combo group was 27.8% +/- 3. 0% ,significantly less than those of the cell group (37.0% +/- 10. 1% ) and gene group (37.1% +/- 5.2%, both P <0.05). The heart function of the Combo group was better than those of other groups. (3) The capillary density of the Combo group was 40. 2 +/- 5.5/visual field, significantly greater than those of both the cell group (27.2 +/- 6. 3/visual field, P <0. 01) and that of the control group (18.5 +/- 5.8/visual field, P <0. 01) , and greater to some degree than that of the gene group (35. 8 +/-7.7/visual field, P =0. 189). (4)The heart infarcted size, heart function and capillary density of the cell and gene groups were similar and were smaller, better and greater than those of the control group. (5) Brdu and troponin T double staining detected a varied increase in the number of surviving cardiomyocytes at the heart infarcted area, some of which were double stain positive. RT-PCR showed mRNA expression of hVEGF165 in the Combo and gene groups, that in the Combo group being higher than that in the gene group.Eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1-hVEGF165 can effectively be expressed in MSCs. Transplantation of VEGF gene by means of transfected MSCs brings better improvement in myocardial perfusion and in restoration of heart function than either cellular or gene therapy alone.",

        "title": "Evaluation of myocardial transplantation in cardiac functional restoration of myocardial ischemic rats after vascular endothelial growth factor genes transfected into mesenchymal stem cells",
        "abstract": "AIM: To observe the effect of myocardial transplantation on cardiac function of ischemic heart disease after vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) genes transfected into mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs), and compare the difference of curative effect of therapeutic alliance with gene therapy and cell therapy. METHODS: The experiment was conducted at the laboratory of Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery and central laboratory, Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between July 2003 and August 2004. Inbred line Wistar rats were used to establish myocardial ischemia models. Forty-eight rats with successful model were selected and randomly assigned into 4 groups: alliance group, cell group, gene group and control group with 12 rats in each group. After VEGF-MSCs, the transplantation was conducted at myocardial infarction region 2 weeks after the establishment of myocardial infarction models in the alliance group. The same volume of MSCs was removed in the cell group. Liposomes -pcDNA3.1-hVEGF165 DNA compound was injected in the gene group. The same volume of medium was injected in the control group. The chests of the 12 rats in sham operation group were opened without transfixion and injection. Cardiac function was measured by Buxco system 4 weeks after the injection. Size of myocardial infarcted area was calculated. Living and differentiation were assessed with Brdu and troponin T immunohistochemical double stain. RESULTS: Two rats in the control group died at the 2nd and 3rd weeks after transplantation. Twelve rats in the alliance group, 12 rats in the cell group, 12 rats in the gene group, 10 rats in the control group and 12 rats in the sham operation group were involved in the result analysis. \u2460Four weeks after transplantation the size of the myocardial infarction area in the alliance was (27.8\u00b13.0)%, which was lower than that in the cell group (37.0\u00b110.1)% (P=0.035) and the gene group (37.1\u00b15.2)% (P=0.033). \u2461Buxco examination showed that the maximal elevation rate of left ventricular systolic pressure and indoor pressure of isovolumic contraction period of left ventricular was higher than that in the cell group and the gene group \ue650left ventricular systolic pressure: (104.5\u00b19.1), (93.9\u00b111.9), (93.6\u00b113.9) mm Hg, (P=0.026, 0.022); the maximal elevation rate of indoor pressure of isovolumic contraction period of left ventricular: (4 971.1\u00b1371.3), (4 420.6\u00b1424.9), (4 361.8\u00b1617.6) mm Hg/s, (P=0.030, 0.017)\ue651. The maximal decrease rate of indoor pressure of isovolumic contraction period of left ventricular was lower than that in the cell group and the gene group \ue650(4 210.3\u00b1449.5), (3 751.3\u00b1431.2), (3 587.5\u00b1763.5) mm Hg/s,(P=0.036, 0.005)\ue651. The diastolic pressure of left ventricle decreased gradually as compared with the cell group and the gene group \ue650(3.1\u00b13.5),(6.5\u00b14.9),(6.1\u00b15.8) mm Hg, (P=0.155, 0.202)\ue651. \u2462Brdu and Troponin-T double stain showed that the quantity of cardiac myocytes in the myocardial infarction region in every treatment group was more than that in the control group to some extent, and parts of them were double stain positive cells. CONCLUSION: Transplantation of MSCs transfected with VEGF gene can be used for ischemic heart disease. Its comprehensive curative effect is better than that of gene therapy or single cellular therapy.",

Methods: From March 2009 to December 2011, 32 patients having anterior mitral valve prolapse received mitral annuloplasty with artificial chord and mitral annuloplasty ring in our department, among which 27 simple anterior mitral valve plasty and 5 combine anterior-posterior mitral valve plasty were completed. Results: All patients survived. Postopeative echocardiography showed no or trivial mitral regurgitation in 28 patients and mild mitral regurgitation in the other 4 patients. The diameter of the left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) obviously decreased after the operation. During the follow up of 3 months to 3 years, the cardiac function of the patients improved at different degrees. Conclusion: Reparation of anterior mitral valve prolapse with artificial chord and mitral annuloplasty ring is simple, reliable and effective, and its early to midterm result after the operation proves good.",

Methods Fifty two patients, aged 13 - 73(52.4 \u00b1 14. 0) years, underwent cardiac valve replacement with biovalves from June 2002 to June 2006 in our hospital. Fifty three tissue valve replacements combined with 8 mechanical valve replacements were performed. Other procedures were also carried out if appropriate, including bidirectional Glenn shunt in 1 patient with double outlet of right ventricle and pulmonary artery stenosis; interruption of accessory pathway in 1 patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome; coronary artery bypass graft in 5 with severe coronary artery disease; and atrial or ventricular repair in 4 with congenital septum defects. Results One patient died in hospital due to multiple organ failure. The hospital mortality rate was 1.9%. The mean follow-up was 25 months. Two patients lost follow-up and the follow-up rate was 96%. Forty one patients returned to NYHA class I, 9 to class II, and 1 to class III. Echocardiography showed the implanted bioprosthesis functioned well without stenosis or regurgitation. There was no structural deterioration with freedom from thromboembolism and anticoagulant hemorrhage in all patients. Conclusion The efficacy of biovalves in heart valve replacement is satisfactory.",

Modified St. Thomas cardioplegic solution and modified LPD solution were used to preserve the donor heart and lung. After removing the heart and lung of the recipient and thorough hemostasis in thoracic cavity and mediastinal septum, the donor heart and lung was implanted, and trachea, superior/inferior vena cava and aortic artery were anastomosed gradually. Intensive care against infection, rejection and other complications were performed after operation.The operations were successful. Tracheal anastomotic stenosis happened in one case seven months after HLT and was cured by sleeve resection of the stenosed trachea segment. Acute rejection happened in one case 10 days after HLT and was cured by stoss therapy. Both patients recovered to normal life and work.The success of HLT is related to perfect organ preservation, precise surgical performance and proper peri-operative treatment.",

Methods: From January 2010 to November 2010,38 patients of DeBakey Type \u2160 aortic dissection were treated surgically in the Sencond Xiangya Hospital of Central South University,in which 16 operations used triple-branched aortic arch covered stent grafts(stent graft group,SG group),22 operations used traditional 4 sides branches aortic arch grafts(arch graft group,AG group). Results: Compared with AG group,the cardiopulmonary bypass time[(138.1\u00b1 56.42) vs(179.21\u00b1 67.64) min],the clamp time [(98.56\u00b128.08) vs(134.36\u00b146.46) min] and the selective cerebral perfusion time[(27.3\u00b114.76) vs(48.74\u00b118.22) min] in SG group were obviously shortened(P<0.05).The volume of drainage 24 hours after operation in SG group also reduced[(608.93\u00b1308.15) vs(899.04\u00b1437.79) mL](P<0.05).The SG group had a lower rate of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury(6.25% vs 27.3%) and duration of hospitalization[(16.15\u00b16.68) vs(21.18\u00b112.69) d](P<0.05).During a following-up period of 14 to 24 months,reexamination of aortic CT angiography showed that the triple-branched aortic arch covered stent graft expanded well,and attached to the wall satisfactorily,while the corresponding false lumen of the aortic artery disappeared and the distal false lumen was filled with thrombus.The life quality of patients were good. Conclusion: The new triple-branched aortic arch covered stent graft is appropriated for most patients with DeBakey Type \u2160 aortic dissection.Its use can simplify the aortic arch procedure,decrease the operation risk and has satisfactory results in early and middle stage after operation.",

        "abstract": "Lactate accumulation has been observed in the brain with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, the outcome of lactate accumulation has not been well characterized. Here, we report that lactate accumulation contributes to angiogenesis and neurogenesis in ICH. In the first set of the experiment,\u00a0 a\u00a0rat model of ICH was induced by injecting collagenase into the brain. The effects of lactate accumulation on the neurological function, apoptosis, and numbers of newborn endothelial cells and neurons, as well as the proliferation-associated signaling pathway, were evaluated in the rat brain. \u00a0In the second set, exogenous L-lactate was infused into intact rat brains so that its effects could be further\u00a0assessed. Following ICH, lactate accumulated around the hematoma; the numbers of PCNA/vWF nuclei and PCNA/DCX cells were significantly increased compared with the numbers in the Sham group. Moreover, ICH induced translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) p65 into the nucleus, resulting in a notable upregulation of VEGF and bFGF mRNAs and proteins compared with the levels in the Sham controls. Administration of a lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor dramatically inhibited these effects, decreased the vascular density, and aggravated neurological severity scores and apoptosis after ICH. After exogenous L-lactate infusion, the numbers of PCNA/vWF nuclei and PCNA/DCX cells were strikingly increased compared with the numbers in the Sham controls. In addition, lactate facilitated NF-\u03baB translocation to induce increased transcription of VEGF and bFGF. Co-infusion with an NF-\u03baB inhibitor significantly inhibited these effects. These data suggest that lactate potentiates angiogenesis and neurogenesis by activating the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway following ICH.",

This study established rat models of traumatic brain injury by controlled cortical impact. Rat models were intragastrically administered 9 and 18 g/kg Xuefu Zhuyu decoction once a day for 14 or 21 days. Changes in neurological function were assessed by modified neurological severity scores and the Morris water maze. Immunohistochemistry, western blot assay, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze synapsin protein and mRNA expression at the injury site of rats. Our results showed that Xuefu Zhuyu decoction visibly improved neurological function of rats with traumatic brain injury. These changes were accompanied by increased expression of synaptophysin, synapsin I, and postsynaptic density protein-95 protein and mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. These findings indicate that Xuefu Zhuyu decoction increases synapsin expression and improves neurological deficits after traumatic brain injury.",

        "title": "iTRAQ-Based Proteomics Analysis Reveals the Effect of Rhubarb in Rats with Ischemic Stroke.",
        "abstract": " Rhubarb, a traditional Chinese medicine, promotes viscera and remove blood stasis. Rhubarb is skilled in smoothening meridians, improving blood circulation which exhibits better efficacy on cerebral ischemic stroke. In this study, we aimed to analyze the underlying mechanisms of rhubarb which treated rats of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model according to an iTRAQ-based proteomics and bioinformatics analysis. 30 rats were randomly allocated into three groups including sham group (SG), model group (MG), and rhubarb group (RG). Rhubarb group was given a gavage of rhubarb decoction at dose of 3 g/kg and the remaining groups were prepared with normal saline by gavage. Rats from MG and RG were induced into MCAO model. The effects of rhubarb were estimated by Modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) and cerebral infarct volume. The brain tissues were measured via the quantitative proteomic approach of iTRAQ coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Furthermore, the bioinformatics analysis of overlapping differentially expression proteins (DEPs) was conducted by DAVID, KEGG, and Cytoscape. Specific selective DEPs were validated by Western blotting. Rats treated with rhubarb after MCAO showed a significant reduction on mNSS and cerebral infarct volume compared with MG. In MG versus SG and RG versus MG, we identified a total of 4578 proteins, of which 287 were DEPs. There were 76 overlapping DEPs between MG versus SG and RG versus MG. Through bioinformatics analysis, 14 associated pathways were searched including cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, tuberculosis, synaptic vesicle cycle, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, long-term potentiation, and so on. 76 overlapping DEPs mainly involved synaptic vesicle cycling biological processes based on GO annotation. Further, the selective overlapping DEPs were verified at the protein level by using Western blotting. Our present study reveals that rhubarb highlights promising neuroprotective effect. Rhubarb exerts novel therapeutic action via modulating multiple proteins, targets, and pathways.",

        "abstract": "Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption is a key pathophysiological factor of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The level of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) has been closely associated with the degree of BBB damage, and is an indicator of BBB destruction. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of rhubarb on BBB function in a rat model of ICH. ICH was induced in rats by treatment with type VII collagenase. Sham-operated rats were administered with an equal volume of saline. Following the administration of rhubarb decoction (20 g/kg), neurobehavioral function evaluation and Evans blue extravasation assays were performed at days 1, 3 and 5 after ICH. ZO-1 expression in the brain of ICH-induced rats were analyzed via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analyses. The results suggested that rhubarb significantly ameliorated neurological symptoms and attenuated BBB permeability. The results of immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR studies indicated that the expression of ZO-1 expression was robust in the sham-operated group and was weak in the vehicle-treated group at day 3. The present data indicated that rhubarb effectively attenuated ICH-induced BBB damage in rats, raising the possibility that rhubarb or its active components may be considered useful as neuroprotective drugs for ICH. The protective mechanisms appeared to involve the preservation of BBB integrity and elevation of ZO-1 protein expression levels.",

        "abstract": "Depression is a major mental disorder, and is currently recognized as the second-leading cause of disability worldwide. However, the therapeutic effect of antidepressants remains unsatisfactory. For centuries, Chinese herbal formulas (CHFs) have been widely used in the treatment of depression, achieving better therapeutic effects than placebo and having fewer side effects than conventional antidepressants. Here, we review the ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, and pharmacology studies of nine common CHFs: \"banxia houpo\" decoction, \"chaihu shugansan\", \"ganmaidazao\" decoction, \"kaixinsan\", \"shuganjieyu\" capsules, \"sinisan\", \"wuling\" capsules, \"xiaoyaosan\", and \"yueju\". Eight clinical trials and seven meta-analyses have supported the theory that CHFs are effective treatments for depression, decreasing Hamilton Depression Scale scores and showing few adverse effects. Evidence from 75 preclinical studies has also elucidated the multitarget and multipathway mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effect of the nine CHFs. Decoctions, capsules, and pills all showed antidepressant effects, ranked in descending order of efficacy. According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, these CHFs have flexible compatibility and mainly act by soothing the liver and relieving depression. This review highlights the effective treatment choices and candidate compounds for patients, practitioners, and researchers in the field of traditional Chinese medicine. In summary, the current evidence supports the efficacy of CHFs in the treatment of depression, but additional large-scale randomized controlled clinical trials and sophisticated pharmacology studies should be performed.",

        "abstract": "Pericyte coverage on the endothelial tubes leads to the formation of a mature and stable microvessel system, which is critical for brain repair after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We report herein that thrombin promotes pericyte coverage by activating Tie2 and the downstream signaling pathway PI3K/Akt in a rat model of ICH. ICH was induced by injection of autologous blood with or without thrombin inhibitor hirudin. Rats were treated with thrombin alone or in combination with a Tie2 inhibitor. The expression of total- and phospho-Tie2, PI3K and phospho-Akt, blood perfusion, pericyte coverage, IgG extravasation, neuron survival and neurological deficits were evaluated by western blot, fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate-dextran staining, immunohistochemistry, Nissl staining and modified neurological severity scores respectively. Induction of ICH resulted in increased phosphorylation of Tie2 on endothelial cells and pericyte coverage, better formation of integral and functional microvessels, more surviving neurons and accelerated motor function recovery, all of which were significantly attenuated by hirudin at 7 and 14 days after ICH induction. Furthermore, thrombin increased phosphorylation of Tie2 and Akt, expression of PI3K, and pericyte coverage, which were however reversed by pharmacological inhibition of Tie2. Our results demonstrated that thrombin promotes pericyte coverage on microvessels following ICH by enhancing activation of Tie2, in which the downstream PI3K/Akt signaling pathway might be involved.",

        "abstract": "Osteomyelitis is a well-known bone infection in humans. The primary symptoms are fever, pain, weakness, and redness of the bone. l-Homocarnosine is a bioactive peptide abundant in brain and skeletal muscles. The present study evaluated the synergistic effect of vancomycin and l-homocarnosine against osteomyelitis in the Staphylococcus aureus-induced rat model of osteomyelitis. Animals were classified into the following groups: sham (group I), osteomyelitis (group II, control), vancomycin (25\u2009mg/kg body weight, group III), l-homobrassinolide (25\u2009mg/kg body weight, group IV), and vancomycin (25\u2009mg/kg body weight)\u2009+\u2009l-homobrassinolide (25\u2009mg/kg body weight) (group V). Lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), catalase, reduced glutathione (GSH), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined. Assessments of bacterial growth and histopathological analyses were carried out. Lipid peroxidation, GSH, SOD, catalase, and Gpx levels recovered to near normal levels with the combined treatment of vancomycin and l-homocarnosine. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels were reduced to near normal levels. Combined supplementation of vancomycin and l-homocarnosine reduced bacterial growth in bone and wire. Furthermore, bone infections and histopathological scores were also reduced. In summary, we showed that combined treatment of vancomycin and l-homocarnosine was more effective against bacterial growth and bone infection compared to monotherapy with vancomycin or l-homocarnosine.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the action mechanism of yiqi huoxue (YQHX) therapy by observing the expressions of membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), MMP-2 And MMP-9 in intracerebral hemorrhagic (ICH) rat brains from the microvessel network reconstruction aspect. METHODS: The experiment was done in the laboratory of Institute of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University from March to October in 2006. Experiment materials: Buyang Huanwu Decoction (milkvetch root, Chinese Angelica, red peony root, Carthamus tinctorius, Szechwan Lovage Rhizome, Pheretima asiatica, peach seed at the ratio of 20\u22363\u22363\u22363\u22362\u22363\u22363), Yi-qi composition of Buyang Huanwu Decoction (milkvetch root at the same ratio), Huo-xue composition of Buyang Huanwu Decoction (Chinese Angelica, red peony root, Carthamus tinctorius, Szechwan Lovage Rhizome, Pheretima asiatica, peach seed at the ratio of 3\u22363\u22363\u22362\u22363\u22363). All the herbs were decocted twice with distilled water into 1.54,0.81 and 0.73 g/mL. Experiment groups: 155 SD rats were randomly divided into six groups: normal control group (n =5), sham group (n =30), ICH group (n =30), YQHX-treated group (n =30), YQ-treated group (n =30), HX-treated group (n =30). Animals were observed at 2, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28 days postoperation, 5 rats at each time point. Experiment intervention: ICH model was induced by injecting collagenase type \u2166 stereotaxically into right globus pallidus, while sham group was injected with 2 \u03bcL saline. Normal group was routinely fed. The sham group and ICH group were intragastrically administrated with distilled water, 2 \u03bcL once, twice daily. The animals of YQHX-treated group, YQ-treated group, and HX-treated group were respectively intragastrically administrated with Buyang Huanwu Decoction, the Yi-qi composition of Buyang Huanwu Decoction and the Huo-xue composition of Buyang Huanwu Decoction at the dosage of three times of the 70 kg adult according to body surface area calculation (30.80,16.20,14.60 g/kg daily, 2 mL once, twice daily). Then, the animals of every group were anesthetized through intragastric injection at 2, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28 days postoperation and the brain tissue of the animals were used to prepare frozen sections. Normal group was anesthetized to death at 28 days postoperation. Experiment evaluation: The expressions of MT1-MMP, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: All the 155 rats were involved in the result analysis.\u2460Expressions of MT1-MMP, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were observed in the cortex of normal group and sham group occasionally.\u2461In ICH group, the expressions of MT1-MMP and MMP-2 peaked at 4 days, then gradually decreased but peaked at 14-21 days again.\u2462In YQHX-treated group, the expressions of MT1-MMP and MMP-2 were lower than those in ICH group (P < 0.01) and other therapy-treated groups at 4 days (P < 0.05). Later the expression of MT1-MMP in YQHX-treated group peaked at 7-14 days, which was earlier than that in ICH group. In all therapy-treated groups, the expression of MT1-MMP was obviously lower compared with ICH group after 21 days (P < 0.01). In YQHX-treated group, the expression of MMP-2 was higher than those in the other groups after 7 days (P < 0.05), then began to depress at 28 days.\u2463In ICH group, the expression of MMP-9 peaked at 4 days (P < 0.01) and decreased gradually, then could not be observed after two weeks, but in YQHX-treated group, the expression of MMP-9 peaked at 7 days (P < 0.05), which delayed compared with in ICH group, then decreased gradually. CONCLUSION: YQHX therapy can regulate the expressions of MT1-MMP, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in ICH rat brains, which may improve the microenvironment of the damaged brain tissue, promote the reconstruction of microvessel network, and facilitate the tissue repair after ICH.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effects and mechanism of qi-tonifying and stasis-eliminating (QTSE) therapy on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors Flt-1 and Flk-1 in the brains of intracerebral hemorrhagic (model) rats.One hundred and eighty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups: the normal group (n=5), the sham-operative (SO) group (n=35), the model group (n=35), the QTSE group (n=35), the QT group (n=35) and the SE group (n=35). All the rats except those in the normal group and SO group were established into an intracerebral hemorrhage(ICH) model by intracerebral injection of collagenase type VII and the latter three were orally administered with Buyang Huanwu Decoction (a classical recipe for QTSE) or with some of its components for qi-tonification and for stasis-elimination, respectively. To the other three groups, normal saline solutions were given instead. Behavioral tests were carried out in the animals randomly chosen from each group on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after modeling. The expressions of VEGF, Flk-1 and Flt-1 were determined by immunohistochemistry and the number of vascular segments with positive expression in the injured brain area of the rats was calculated.From day 7 onwards, the asymmetric forelimb use rate in the QTSE group recovered more significantly than that in the other model groups. In the model group, the expressions of VEGF, Flk-1 and Flt-1 appeared on day 1 and reached a peak on day 21, then weakened gradually. In the QTSE group, as compared with the other model groups, a higher level of VEGF expression was shown from day 7 (P<0.01) and a higher level of Flt-1 expression was shown from the 7th day to the 21st day (P<0.01).QTSE therapy can up-regulate the expressions of VEGF and its receptors (Flk-1 and Flt-1) and improve the recovery of kinetic function in the ICH rats, which may be correlated with its action in modulating vascular regeneration to promote the reconstruction of microvascular networks in the damaged areas.",

Method: ICH rats were induced with Collagenase VII and the changes of brain were observed by HE staining and expression of Ang-1 and the receptor Tie-2 were assayed by immunohistochemistry on the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th d after the onset, then positive microvessels were counted. Result: No obvious pathology change appeared in brains of normal control and sham or sham group during the experiment, but for model group, microvessels appeared around hematoma on the 4th d, which got denser gradually and extended into hematoma on the 21st d. Immunohistochemistry revealed no change of expression of Ang-1 and Tie-2 in brains of normal control and sham or sham group during the experiment, and in ICH group, the expression of Ang-1 and Tie-2 were observed on the 2nd d, which increased gradually and peaked on the 21st d, then depressed on day 28. Conclusion: Expressions of Ang-1 and its receptor Tie-2 are up-regulated follwing ICH, which may play an important role in the course of microvascular networks reconstruction by promoting angiogenesis.",

The Ang-/Tie-2 system may contribute to angiogenesis and vascular remodeling by mediating interactions of endothelial cells with smooth muscle cells and pericytes. The spatial distribution and temporal expression of Ang-1 and Tie-2 in the rat brain were studied following collagenase-induced intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain (RT-PCR) analysis, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that some Ang-1 or Tie-2-positive dilated vessels resided around the hematoma and extended into the clot. RT-PCR analysis showed that Ang-1 and Tie-2 mRNA signal was detected at 2 days and persisted for 28 days after ICH. These findings suggest that ICH could lead to upregulation of Ang-1 and the receptor Tie-2 mRNA.",

        "abstract": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a major public health burden. Endothelial-dependent coronary artery vasoreactivity is a significant indicator of vascular function. Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and predicts late cardiovascular events. Astragaloside IV (AGIV) is the main active component of the herb Astragalus membranaceus. Although it shows a significant protective effect against vascular endothelial dysfunction, the mechanisms of AGIV promoting the vascular dilation have not been elucidated. This study investigated the vasodilator effect of AGIV on rat aortic rings and the underlying effect of AGIV via the PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling pathway. We measured the relaxation of isolated RARs after different concentrations of AGIV treatment. Rat aorta endothelial cells were cultured with different doses of AGIV, dimethylsulfoxide, and NG-nitro L-arginine methyl ester. The expression of phosphorylated (p)-Akt and -endothelial nitric oxide synthase (p-eNOS) were tested by Western blot analysis. The messenger (m)RNA expression of eNOS was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. AGIV exerted a vasodilator effect on the aortic rings and increased the NO content in a concentration-dependent manner. The vasorelaxation was suppressed by an eNOS inhibitor. AGIV regulated the PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling pathway via phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and dephosphorylation of eNOS at Thr495. The mRNA expression of eNOS was remarkably upregulated by AGIV. AGIV significantly induced the dilation of the aortic rings, leading to the vasodilator response by enhancing the eNOS release via the PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling pathway.",

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a critical regulator of reactive astrogliosis. The present study tested whether endogenous LIF acted on ICH-induced reactive astrogliosis via the STAT3 signaling pathway. Rats were divided into three experimental groups: 1) Rats received either an ICH or a needle insertion (sham), 2) Rats received 100\u2009ng LIF or an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by direct infusion into the lateral ventricle (LV) after ICH, and 3) AG490 (0.25\u2009mg/kg) was injected into the LV to block STAT3 signaling. Brains were perfused to identify proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)+/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+nuclei.

However, HBO for treatment of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) remains controversial, in either animal or clinical studies. Therefore, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis on studies describing the efficacy of HBO in animal models of ICH.Methods: Studies were identified by searching mainstream databases through November 2015. The efficacy of HBO in animal models of ICH was assessed by changes in the brain water content (BWC), neurobehavioural outcome (NO) or both. Subgroup analyses were performed according to different design characteristics.Results: In total 15 studies met our inclusion criteria. HBO can reduce the BWC (\u22120.982, 95% CI, \u22121.148 to \u22120.817; P u003c 0.01; 57 comparisons), and improve NO (\u22120.767, 95% CI, \u22121.376 to \u22120.159; P u003c 0.01; eight comparisons).

        "abstract": "Background: Fructus Aurantii (FA) is widely used in clinic as an expectorant and digestant herb in traditional Chinese medicine and proven to have a variety of pharmacological functions. FA is close to grapefruit either by botanical taxonomy or by their same components (flavonoids, etc.) and grapefruit has been proven to cause drug-drug interaction when co-administrated with CYP3A4 substrates. Besides, FA contains many compounds, such as flavonoids, which have been reported to impact the expressions of CYP450. However, the effect of FA on CYP450, whose change may affect drug safety and clinical efficacy attributed to drug-drug interaction, still remains unknown. Material and method: The protein, mRNA expression and enzyme activity of CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 in rat were determined by Western Blotting, RT-PCR method, the cocktail method, respectively, after orally administration of FA in succession for 7 days. CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 mRNA expression were investigated in HepG2 cells following FA-medicated serum incubation for 24h. Result: In rat, compared to the control group, CYP1A2, CYP3A4 protein and mRNA expression were significantly induced consistent with the corresponding CYP activities; the protein expression of CYP2E1 was significantly up-regulated, while the corresponding mRNA expression and enzyme activity showed no significant change. In HepG2 cells, compared to the control group, the mRNA expression of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 was up-regulated statistically while CYP2E1 mRNA expression was not significantly induced or inhibited. Conclusion: FA may be a potential slight inducer of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 and is unlikely to impact CYP2E1 until clinical researches are conducted.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effect of luteolin on the activation and proliferation of mouse T cells stimulated by the combination of PMA plus Ion in vitro. Methods: T cells from mouse were stimulated by PMA plus Ion and incubated with different concentrations of luteolin, followed by the cell proliferation assay by MTT and detection of IL-2mRNA and INF\u03b3mRNA in T cell by RT-PCR. Results: After the stimulation by PMA plus Ion for 6h, T cell proliferated markedly when compared with control group (p<0. 01); luteolin (10, 20, 30\u03bcM) degraded the proliferation of T cells significantly when induced by PMA plus Ion (p<0.01); the cytoline expression of IL-2mRNA, INF\u03b3mRNA of T cells were inhibited notably by various concentrations (10, 20, 30\u03bcM) of luteolin when compared with control group (p<0.01). Conclusions: Luteolin can prevent the activation and proliferation of mouse T cells, which is probably achieved by inhibiting the expression of IL-2mRNA and INF\u03b3mRNA.",

        "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in the USA. Effective therapeutic strategies for TBI are needed, and increasing attention is turning toward traditional herbal medicine. Rhizoma drynariae is a traditional Chinese medicine that has immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Here, using the controlled cortical impact model of TBI in rats, we examined whether oral administration of R. drynariae can reduce TBI-induced brain injury in rats. We also identified the likely active compound among its four major phytochemicals in decoction. We found that post-treatment with R. drynariae decreased brain lesion volume, improved neurologic and cognitive function, and reduced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. These changes were accompanied by reduced blood levels of IL-6 and increased IL-10. R. drynariae treatment also reversed the TBI-induced decrease in blood monocyte numbers and percentage of blood CD3 and CD4 T lymphocytes while inhibiting microglial/macrophage activation. Furthermore, by using ultra performance liquid chromatography and comparing retention times with authentic standards, we identified eriodictyol as the putative active compound of R. drynariae extract in the blood of rats with TBI. These novel findings indicate that the traditional Chinese herbal medicine R. drynariae protects brain against TBI-induced brain injury, possibly via immune-promoting, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. Eriodictyol could be its active compound. ",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Sun's procedure is a surgical technique widely used in type A aortic dissection. The purpose of this study was to analyze clinical outcomes and morphologic changes in true and false lumen by computed tomography (CT) angiography after Sun's procedure. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 51 patients who underwent Sun's procedure for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection extending down to iliac bifurcation between January 2013 and December 2014. The images of preoperative, one-month, three-month, and six-month follow-up were analyzed by CT angiography to measure the area and diameter of true and false lumen. RESULTS Four patients died before surgical intervention and postoperative deaths occurred in five patients (in-hospital mortality rate 10.6%). Only 42 patients (36 male, 6 female; mean age, 45.9\u00b19.8 years; range, 24-65 years) with acute type A aortic dissection were involved in our study. Thirty-five patients (83.3%) suffered from chest or abdominal pain and only one patient (2.4%) was asymptomatic. Thirty-seven patients (88.1%) had hypertension as the most common comorbidity. In the ascending aorta, false lumen was eliminated and the change of true lumen was not significant (p>0.05). In the descending aorta, complete and partial thrombosis of false lumen were observed in eight patients (19.0%) and 33 patients (78.6%) by one-month follow-up CT scan, respectively. After the six-month follow-up, the rate of complete thrombosis increased to 36.1% and partial thrombosis decreased to 61.9%. The area and maximal diameter of true lumen were increased significantly (p<0.05), whereas significant decreases were found in the area and maximal diameter of false lumen (p<0.05). In the abdominal aorta, thrombosis was found in 52.4% patients at one-month follow-up CT. Furthermore, there were no significant changes in both true and false lumen within three months (p>0.05). Nevertheless, the false luminal area and maximal diameter decreased significantly (p<0.05) after six months, while these changes of true lumen were not significant (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS After Sun's procedure, aortic remodeling was a continuous process and occurred in a predictable model, and the extent of aortic remodeling varied at different levels. Remodeling in descending thoracic aorta was earlier than it was in abdominal aorta.",

        "abstract": " (FA) is widely used in clinic as an expectorant and digestant herb in traditional Chinese medicine and proven to have a variety of pharmacological functions. FA is close to grapefruit either by botanical taxonomy or by their same components (flavonoids, etc.) and grapefruit has been proven to cause drug-drug interaction when co-administrated with CYP3A4 substrates. Besides, FA contains many compounds, such as flavonoids, which have been reported to impact the expressions of CYP450. However, the effect of FA on CYP450, whose change may affect drug safety and clinical efficacy attributed to drug-drug interaction, still remains unknown.  The protein, mRNA expression and enzyme activity of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2E1 in rat were determined by Western Blotting, RT-PCR method, the cocktail method, respectively, after orally administration of FA in succession for 7 days. CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2E1 mRNA expression were investigated in HepG2 cells following FA-medicated serum incubation for 24 h.  In rat, compared to the control group, CYP1A2, CYP3A4 protein, and mRNA expression were significantly induced consistent with the corresponding CYP activities; the protein expression of CYP2E1 was significantly upregulated, while the corresponding mRNA expression and enzyme activity showed no significant change. In HepG2 cells, compared to the control group, the mRNA expression of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 was up-regulated statistically while CYP2E1 mRNA expression was not significantly induced or inhibited.  FA may be a potential slight inducer of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 and is unlikely to impact CYP2E1 until clinical researches are conducted.",

        "abstract": "According to previous research studies, warfarin can be detected in human bile after oral administration. Ferulic acid (FA) is the main bioactive component of many Chinese herbs for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. To elucidate the effects of FA on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in rats after biliary drainage is necessary. Twenty rats were randomly divided into four groups: Group 1 (WN): healthy rats after the administration of warfarin sodium, Group 2 (WO): a rat model of biliary drainage after the administration of warfarin sodium, Group 3 (WFN): healthy rats after the administration of warfarin sodium and FA, and Group 4 (WFO): a rat model of biliary drainage after the administration of warfarin sodium and FA. Blood samples were collected at different time points after administration. The concentrations of blood samples were determined by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Comparisons between groups were performed according to the main pharmacokinetic parameters calculated by the DAS 2.1.1 software. The pharmacokinetic parameters showed a significant difference between the WN and WO groups, the WO group showed a decrease of 51% and 41.6% in area under the curve from 0 to time (AUC0- t ) and peak plasma concentration (C max), respectively, whereas time to C max (T max) was delayed 3.27 folds. There were significant differences between the WFO and WFN groups, the WFO group showed a decrease of 63.8% and 70% in AUC0- t and C max, respectively; the delay in T max between the WN and WFN groups (mean, from 132-432 minutes) was significantly different; the mean retention time from 0 to time (MRT0- t ) between the WO and WFO groups (mean, from 718.31-606.13 minutes) also showed a significant difference. Enterohepatic circulation markedly influences the disposition of warfarin in rats, and FA significantly affected the warfarin disposition in rat plasma. ",

We investigated prestroke global and regional changes in brain volume in a carotid plaque population of cognitively healthy individuals and the association between carotid plaque characteristics and these changes.A total of 76 participants were divided into healthy control (HC, n\u200a=\u200a28), vulnerable plaque (n\u200a=\u200a27) and stable plaque groups (n\u200a=\u200a21). All subjects underwent carotid ultrasound and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to examine differences in regional gray matter volumes (rGMVs) among the different groups.The plaque group had a significantly lower mean total cerebral brain volume (TCBV) than the HC group (P\u200a=\u200a.03). Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) was negatively correlated with TCBV (r\u200a=\u200a-0.311, P\u200a=\u200a.006) and rGMV in the right thalamus (r\u200a=\u200a-0.589, P\u200a=\u200a.001). The rGMVs of the right middle occipital gyrus and bilateral lingual gyrus were significantly different between the unstable and stable groups. The gray-scale median (GSM) of the plaque and the total plaque risk score (TPRS) were correlated with the volume of the right middle occipital gyrus (r=-0.478, P\u200a=\u200a.001; r\u200a=\u200a0.541, P\u200a=\u200a.001) and bilateral lingual gyrus (r\u200a=\u200a-0.419, P\u200a=\u200a.003; r\u200a=\u200a0.288, P\u200a=\u200a.04).Carotid plaque is related to the volume of the brain parenchyma and right thalamus.

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the mechanisms of method of supplementing Qi and activating blood circulation on the expression of type \u2163 collagen in brains of intracerebral hemorrhage(ICH) rats.Methods ICH model was induced by injecting collagenase type\u2166 stereotaxically into right globus pallidus.One hundred and fifty SD rats were randomly divided into shame operation,ICH model,supplementing Qi,activating blood circulation,supplementing Qi and activating blood circulation groups,each group had 30 cases.The last 3 treated groups were administered orally with the classic methods of supplementing Qi and activating blood circulation prescription of Buyang Huanwu decoction.The expressions of type \u2163 collagen were assayed by immunohistochemistry on 3,7,14,21 and 28 days after the onset,then the average optical density of the positive microvessels were counted.Results No hematoma and obvious local pathological changes were appeared in brain tissues of sham operation group at different time points during the experiment.Microvascular angiogenesis of supplementing Qi and activating blood circulation group was more than that of supplementing Qi,activating blood circulation and model groups.Immunohistochemical researches showed that at different time points,the expression of type \u2163 collagen had no significant changes in sham operation group.The expressions of type \u2163 collagen in model and three medically treated groups were observed on 3 day,the expressions were increased gradually,peaked on 21 day in supplementing Qi and model groups,and then started to decrease.The peak time of activating blood group and supplementing Qi and activating blood circulation group were advanced on 14 day,and the expressions sustained high levels to 28 day.Conclusions The method of supplementing Qi and activating blood circulation can up-regulate the expressions of type \u2163 collagen after ICH to participate in the tissue repair.",

        "abstract": "Impaired fracture healing in aged females is still a challenge in clinics. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in fracture healing. This study aims to identify the miRNAs that potentially contribute to the impaired fracture healing in aged females. Transverse femoral shaft fractures were created in adult and aged female mice. At post-fracture 0-, 2- and 4-week, the fracture sites were scanned by micro computed tomography to confirm that the fracture healing was impaired in aged female mice and the fracture calluses were collected for miRNA microarray analysis. A total of 53 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs and 5438 miRNA-target gene interactions involved in bone fracture healing were identified. A novel scoring system was designed to analyze the miRNA contribution to impaired fracture healing (RCIFH). Using this method, 11 novel miRNAs were identified to impair fracture healing at 2- or 4-week post-fracture. Thereafter, function analysis of target genes was performed for miRNAs with high RCIFH values. The results showed that high RCIFH miRNAs in aged female mice might impair fracture healing not only by down-regulating angiogenesis-, chondrogenesis-, and osteogenesis-related pathways, but also by up-regulating osteoclastogenesis-related pathway, which implied the essential roles of these high RCIFH miRNAs in impaired fracture healing in aged females, and might promote the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies.

        "abstract": "The fast steering mirror is a significant element of the photoelectric precision tracking system and is mainly used for attenuating the tracking error of the main axis and rejecting the line-of-sight jitter caused by various disturbances. A control loop model is constructed and object parameters have been identified according to this model in this paper. Low sampling frequency introduce great delay into the imaging tracking system, which may restrict greatly the closed-loop bandwidth, reduce tracking precision of the system and even make the system unsteady. Various elements which limit tracking loop bandwidth are presented and analyzed. Three tracking systems with different sampling frequency are simulated and analyzed. From the simulation result the conclusion can be drawn that it is difficult to increase the closedloop bandwidth in the presence of great delay by means of the general control method. Accordingly feedback control or feed forward control may be tried to improve the error attenuation of the system. The micro-mechanical gyro can be used for measuring the angular velocity of fast steering mirror, so output of velocity gyro as velocity loop feedback may improve the system performance. Furthermore, the velocity loop feedback can enhance the rigidity and the output stability of the tracking system. Finally, the velocity feedback can increase the type of the open loop system; consequently it will improve the error attenuation of the system. The simulation result shows that the tracking precision of the system with velocity feedback is 10 times better than the system without velocity feedback. \u00a9 2009 SPIE.",

The tracking precision and control bandwidth are greatly improved by the compound axis servomechanism. In high tracking control system, the compound axis servomechanism is an effective way to obtain the tracking precision of the microradian, even the submicroradian. In this paper, the basic theory and primarily technical problems of the compound axis servomechanism were introduced. In the control system of the compound axis servomechanism, the control bandwidth matching of main and subsystem tracking control was a prerequisite of compound axis servomechanism, and the control performance precision of compound axis servomechanism depended on the closed loop control performance of fast steering mirror. The recent development and technical improvement was analyzed, such as multiple compound axis servomechanism, pseud compound axis servomechanism, adaptive optics, feed forward control and so on in the compound axis servomechanism.",

        "abstract": "Direct drive systems produce mechanical resonances and anti-resonance because mismatch between load and DC force motor is too much, and the connect shaft seems to have low stiffness. The resonance and anti-resonance are varied because of some uncertainties about backlash and friction, so it is difficult to compensate using notch filter or some other methods. A well known lumped-parameter model is utilized to simulate tracking control system. The bandwidths of velocity loop and high gain controller are restricted by resonances, resulting in deteriorating tracking precision. A novel controller based on load acceleration feedback control is proposed to reduce mechanical resonance, which is used for inner loop of velocity loop. We propose three design regulations for the controller. The experiments verify the algorithm availably. Results with load acceleration feedback control show that compared with only velocity feedback, bandwidth of rate loop is enhanced 5Hz and resonance peak reduces 15dB. Acceleration feedback control improves the robustness and stability of the system.",

There were two sets of information that could be used to evaluate the converted measurement error statistics, i.e., measurements of the target and a priori state estimate of the filter. Firstly, the proposed procedure in this work derived the means and covariance of the filter's a priori spherical state estimation errors. Secondly, a more accurate evaluation of the converted measurement error statistics was obtained according to the a priori spherical state estimate of the filter instead of measurements. Finally, the improved evaluation method for converted measurement error statistics was utilized to implement the CMKF algorithm for a target tracking scenario. The simulation results show that the proposed method can provide superior performance in terms of convergence and estimation accuracy, especially in the case of significant measurement noises.",

After investigating the closed-loop bandwidth, we rebuild the structure of ADRC to ensure a wider bandwidth. An extended state observer (ESO) is designed to observe disturbances and compensate them. Restrictions on robust stability of ESO are analyzed. Compared with the PI controller, ADRC show better tracking and disturbance-rejection capabilities in experimental results. Particularly, the steady-state tracking error for step-input signal is less than half of that of PI, and the disturbance-rejection ratio is improved by 6 db around 2 Hz.",

Methods The gradient SDS-PAGE was adopted to compare the delipidation effect of mixture of acetone and methanol,mixture of acetone,methanol and TBP,acetone and non-ionic degreasant (CleanasciteTM HC100); the desalting effect of dialysis or ultrafiltration; the sensitivity of colloid Comassie brilliant blue staining. And then 2D-GIGE was applied to compare efficiency of our established method and 2-D Clean-up kit in dealing with bile sample. Results It was revealed that acetone had the best effect,while non-ionic degreasant has the equal degreasing effect but higher rate of protein recovery compared to acetone(52.6% vs 43.7%). Bile desalting was realized by dialysis or ultrafiltration device,while the latter one is less time consuming and can complete protein concentration. The highest sensitivity of colloid Comassie brilliant blue staining is 10 ng. There are 854 and 615 protein spots being separated in the two-dimensional electrophoresis map by dealing with the same sample using our established method or 2-D Clean-up kit respectively. Conclusions Our research established a reliable and efficient preparation method for purification of bile sample,thus the treated bile sample can satisfy the requirement of biliary two-dimensional electrophoresis.",

Methods Human cholangiocarcinoma xenografts was established in nude mice with the QBC939 cell line. The nude mice were randomly divided into 6 groups, including high dose TM5-FUNC treatment group (250 mg/kg), middle dose TM5-FUNC treatment group (200 mg/kg), low dose TM5-FUNC treatment group (150 mg/kg) and their control groups. TM5-FUNC was administrated via tail vein injection 20 days after tumor cells implantation. Tumor volume, inhibition ratio of tumor, and tumor growth curve were evaluated in each group. Micro-structure of xenografts in each group was also observed by electro-microscopy. Results Compared with those in the control groups, high dose and middle dose treatment groups demonstrated higher therapeutic effect (P<0.05). The inhibition ratio in high, middle and low dose treatment groups were 39.6%, 14.6% and 7.9%, respectively. The tumor growth curve of high, middle and low dose groups were declined accordingly. Apoptosis cells could be detected in high and middle dosage treatment groups. Conclusion The inhibitory effect of TM5-FUNC on human cholangiocarcinoma xenograft growth in the nude mice is clearly demonstrated.",

The peripheral blood samples were collected from 29 healthy controls (normal control group) and 78 patients with asthma which included 30 patients in exacerbation group, 25 patients in persistent group, and 23 patients in remission group. By using flow cytometry and RT-PCR, the CD4+CD25+ Treg ratio and Foxp3 mRNA in PBMCs were detected. The CD4+CD25+ Treg ratio and Foxp3 mRNA in PBMCs of exacerbation and persistent groups were lower than that of remission and normal control group (P<0.05). Although the CD4+CD25+ Treg ratio and Foxp3 mRNA of remission group also lower than that of normal control group, there was no significant difference between them (P>0.05). As compared with persistent group, exacerbation group had lower CD4 +CD25+ Treg ratio and Foxp3 mRNA (P<0.05). It was indicated that the decrease of CD4+CD25+ Treg ratio and its function in PBMCs may be responsible for pathogenesis of asthma. \u00a9 Huazhong University of Science and Technology 2007.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the effects of siRNA eukaryotic expression vectors targeting PEG10 on HepG2 cell cycle and cell-cycle regulatory proteins. Methods The psiRNA-PEG10 plasmid was transiently transfected into HepG2 cell with Lipofectamine 2000. The expression of PEG10 in HepG2 was detected by RT-PCR. The effect of PEG10 on the cell cycle was observed by flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein expression of Cyclin D1and p27 were detected by RT-PCR and Western Blotting respectively. Results There was a depressed expression of PEG10 in the cells transfected with psiRNA-PEG10. Upon flow cytometry, there were more cells in G0/G1 phase and fewer cells in G2/M phase in psiRNA-PEG10-transfected cells. The mRNA and protein expression of Cyclin D1 decreased in the psiRNA-PEG10-transfected cells, while p27 expression increased (P<0.01). Conclusion The result indicated that PEG10 might play an important role in the pathogenesis of HCC by inhibiting the cell cycle, which was related to the decreased Cyclin D1 and increased p27 expression. SiRNA eukaryotic expression vector targeting PEG10 may become a promising-treatment strategy of HCC.",

[Methods] Immunohistochemistry was used to detect KAI1/CD82 and MRP-1/CD9 protein expression in 52 TCCB specimens. Correlations of the expression of KAI1/CD82 and MRP-1/CD9 to clinicopathological factors were statistically analyzed. [Results] The positive rates of KAI1/CD82 and MRP-1/CD9 in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder were 50% and 61.5%, respectively. MRP-1/CD9 and KAI1/CD82 expression was significantly associated with the pathological grade of TCCB (P <0.05), but no correlation was found between MRP-1/CD9 or KAI1/CD82 expression and clinical stage of TCCB(P >0.05). Furthermore, MRP-1/CD9 and KAI1/CD82 were expressed at lower level in recurrent TCCB samples than that of non-recurrent samples(P <0.05). Meanwhile, the correlation between KAI1/CD82 expression and MRP-1/CD9 expression was statistically significant(r=0.316, P <0.05).

LDL cholesterol in the circulatory system can undergo oxidative modification to oxidized LDL (oxLDL), leading to the development of CAD. We tested whether indium oxide (In 2 O 3 ) nanowires network- and carbon nanotube network-based field effect transistors (FETs) were able to differentiate the LDL cholesterol between the reduced (native LDL) and the oxidized state (oxLDL). LDL samples isolated from human plasma were exposed to In 2 O 3 FETs, and conductivities and gating characteristics were obtained as current versus drain-source voltage ( I D \u2013 V DS ), and current versus gate-source voltage ( I D \u2013 V GS ). A higher conductivity was observed in the LDL sample containing 15.1% oxLDL relative to the sample containing 4.4% oxLDL. The results were validated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Next, carbon nanotube network-based FETs conjugated with anti-copper oxLDL antibody were exposed to the LDL samples. Distinct conductivities between nLDL and oxLDL were also observed from the I D versus time domain curve in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA), demonstrating nano-scale sensors as potential lab-on-a-chip devices for detection of oxLDL cholesterol.",

Key to our success is the growth of vertically aligned single-crystalline MgO nanowires, which worked as excellent templates for epitaxial deposition of the desired transition metal oxides and led to high-quality core-shell nanowires. Transport studies on La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 nanowires have revealed the remarkable persistence of metal-insulator transition and magnetoresistance down to nanometer scale. Our technique will enable various in-depth studies such as phase transition in nanoscale oxides and may pave the way for novel applications of these fascinating materials.",

Besides the selectivity to different light wavelengths, extremely short response and recovery time have also been obtained, as well as the great reversibility of the nanowire between the high and low conductivity states. In addition, a polarization anisotropy effect was demonstrated and studied for GaN nanowires working as polarized UV detectors. The nanowire conductance varied periodically with the polarization angle of the incident light ( \u03b8 ), which can be well fitted into a function of cos 2 \u03b8 .",

Chemical sensors based on these In2O3 nanowire FETs have been demonstrated. Upon exposure to gaseous molecules such as NO2 and NH3, the electrical conductance of the In2O3 nanowire FETs is found to be dramatically modified, accompanied by substantial shifts in the threshold gate voltage. Our In2O3 nanowire sensors exhibit significantly improved sensitivity to NO2 gas, as well as shortened response times compared to most existing solid-state gas sensors. In addition, NH3 gas sensing properties of In2O3 nanowires have also been carefully studied. Change of conductance in opposite directions was observed with different nanowire sensors. We suggest that this differential response is caused by various doping concentrations in the semiconducting In2O3 nanowires.",

        "abstract": "We present two effective routes to tune the electronic properties of single-crystalline In 2O 3 nanowires by controlling the doping. The first method involves using different O 2 concentrations during the synthesis. Lightly (heavily) doped nanowires were produced by using high (low) O 2 concentrations, respectively, as revealed by the conductances and threshold voltages of nanowire-based field-effect transistors. Our second method exploits post-synthesis baking, as baking heavily doped nanowires in ambient air led to suppressed conduction and a positive shift of the threshold voltage, whereas baking lightly doped nanowires in vacuum displayed the opposite behavior. Our approaches offer viable ways to tune the electronic properties of many nonstoichiometric metal oxide systems such as In 2O 3, SnO 2, and ZnO nanowires for various applications.",

The second issue is concerned with the solution interpolation which is used to interpolates the numerical solution from the old mesh to the updated mesh. This is done by using a scheme that mimics the DG method for linear conservation laws.

With the involvement of the level set function and the curvature of the interface, some subtle issues in the moving mesh scheme, in particular the solution interpolation from the old mesh to the new mesh and the choice of monitor functions, require careful considerations. In this work, a simple monitor function is proposed that involves both the level set function and its curvature. The purpose for designing the coupled moving mesh and level set method is to achieve higher resolution for the free surface by using a minimum amount of additional expense. Numerical experiments for air bubbles and water drops are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

To construct mappings between the physical domain and the logical domain, it has been demonstrated that harmonic mapping approaches are useful for a general class of solution domains. However, it is known that the curvature of the sphere is positive, which makes the harmonic mapping on a sphere not unique. To fix the uniqueness issue, we follow Sacks and Uhlenbeck [Ann. of Math.

The moving mesh scheme based on the perturbed harmonic mapping is then applied to the moving steep front problem and the Fokker-Planck equations with high potential intensities on a sphere. The numerical experiments show that with a moderate number of grid points our proposed moving mesh algorithm can accurately resolve detailed features of singular problems on a sphere.",

A mesh is found as the solution of an optimization problem that automatically includes the boundary conditions and is solved using a multi-grid approach. The governing equations are discretized in space by linear finite elements and a split time-level scheme is used to numerically integrate in time. One novel aspect of the method is the choice of a regularized monitor function. The moving grid method enables us to obtain accurate numerical solutions with much less degree of freedoms.

        "abstract": "An adaptive mesh method is presented for numerical simulation of shock-induced combustion. The method is composed of two independent ingredients: a flow solver and a mesh redistribution algorithm. The flow solver is a finite-volume based second-order upwind TVD scheme, together with a lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel relaxation scheme for solving the multispecies Navier-Stokes equations with finite rate chemistry. The adaptive mesh is determined by a grid generation method based on solving Poisson equations, with the monitor function carefully designed to resolve both sharp fronts and the induction zone between them. Numerically it is found that the resolution of the induction zone is particularly critical to the combustion problems, and an under-resolved numerical method may cause excessive energy release and spurious runaway reactions. The monitor function proposed in this paper, which is based on the relative rate of change of mass fraction, covered this issue satisfactorily. Numerical simulations of supersonic flows past an axisymmetric projectile in a premixed hydrogen/oxygen (or air) mixture are carried out. The results show that the spurious runaway chemical reactions appearing on coarse grids can be eliminated by using adaptive meshes without invoking any ad hoc treatment for reaction rates. The adaptive mesh approach is more effective than the fixed mesh one in obtaining grid-independent results. Finally, discrepancies between the numerical and benchmark experimental results and difficulties in simulating the detonation waves are delineated which appeal for further investigation.",

        "title": "Moving mesh methods in multiple dimensions based on harmonic maps",
        "abstract": "In practice, there are three types of adaptive methods using the finite element approach, namely the h-method , p-method , and r-method . In the h -method, the overall method contains two parts, a solution algorithm and a mesh selection algorithm. These two parts are independent of each other in the sense that the change of the PDEs will affect the first part only. However, in some of the existing versions of the r -method (also known as the moving mesh method ), these two parts are strongly associated with each other and as a result any change of the PDEs will result in the rewriting of the whole code. In this work, we will propose a moving mesh method which also contains two parts, a solution algorithm and a mesh-redistribution algorithm. Our efforts are to keep the advantages of the r -method (e.g., keep the number of nodes unchanged) and of the h -method (e.g., the two parts in the code are independent). A framework for adaptive meshes based on the Hamilton\u2013Schoen\u2013Yau theory was proposed by Dvinsky. In this work, we will extend Dvinsky's method to provide an efficient solver for the mesh-redistribution algorithm. The key idea is to construct the harmonic map between the physical space and a parameter space by an iteration procedure. Each iteration step is to move the mesh closer to the harmonic map. This procedure is simple and easy to program and also enables us to keep the map harmonic even after long times of numerical integration. The numerical schemes are applied to a number of test problems in two dimensions. It is observed that the mesh-redistribution strategy based on the harmonic maps adapts the mesh extremely well to the solution without producing skew elements for multi-dimensional computations.",

The first-kind equations are reduced to second kind, and by obtaining an appropriate integral inequality, existence and uniqueness are demonstrated. The equivalent discrete integral inequality then permits convergence of discretization methods; and this is illustrated for the Euler method. Finally, a class of nonlinear telegraph equations is shown to be equivalent to (two-dimensional) Volterra integral equations, thereby providing existence and uniqueness results for this class of equations. Furthermore, the telegraph equation may be solved by the numerical method for two-dimensional VIEs, and a simple numerical example is given.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an adaptive moving mesh algorithm for meshes of unstructured polyhedra in three space dimensions. The algorithm automatically adjusts the size of the elements with time and position in the physical domain to re- solve the relevant scales in multiscale physical systems while minimizing computa- tional costs. The algorithm is a generalization of the moving mesh methods based on harmonic mappings developed by Li et al. (J. Comput. Phys., 170 (2001), pp. 562- 588, and 177 (2002), pp. 365-393). To make 3D moving mesh simulations possible, the key is to develop an efficient mesh redistribution procedure so that this part will cost as little as possible comparing with the solution evolution part. Since the mesh redistribution procedure normally requires to solve large size matrix equations, we will describe a procedure to decouple the matrix equation to a much simpler block- tridiagonal type which can be efficiently solved by a particularly designed multi-grid method. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed 3D moving mesh strategy, the algorithm is implemented in finite element simulations of fluid-fluid interface in- teractions in multiphase flows. To demonstrate the main ideas, we consider the for- mation of drops by using an energetic variational phase field model which describes the motion of mixtures of two incompressible fluids. Numerical results on two- and three-dimensional simulations will be presented. AMS subject classifications: 65M20, 65M50, 65M60",

We use some func- tion transformation and variable transformations to change the equation into a new Volterra integral equation defined on the standard interval (\u22121,1), so that the solution of the new equation possesses better regularity and the Jacobi orthogonal polynomial theory can be applied conveniently. In order to obtain high order accuracy for the approximation, the integral term in the resulting equation is approximated by using Jacobi spectral quadrature rules. The convergence analysis of this novel method is based on the Lebesgue constants corresponding to the Lagrange interpolation polyno- mials, polynomials approximation theory for orthogonal polynomials and the operator theory. The spectral rate of convergence for the proposed method is established in the L1-norm and weighted L2-norm. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

More precisely, we can use spectral methods to postprocess numerical solutions of initial value differ- ential equations. After a few number of iterations (say 3 to 4), the errors can decrease to a few orders of magnitude less. The iteration uses the Gauss-Seidel type strategy, which gives an explicit way of postprocessing. Numerical examples for ODEs, Hamil- tonian system and integral equations are provided. They all indicate that the spectral processing technique can be a very useful way in improving the accuracy of the nu- merical solutions. In particular, for a Hamiltonian system accuracy is only one of the issues; some other conservative properties are even more important for large time sim- ulations. The spectral postprocessing with the coarse-meshsymplectic initial guess can not only produce high accurate approximations but can also save a significant amount of computational time over the standard symplectic schemes.",

This method avoids truncating the problem to a finite interval and produces very accurate numerical solutions with a fairly small number of computational points.

        "abstract": "For two-dimensional boundary integral equations of the first kind with logarithmic kernels, the use of the conventional boundary element methods gives linear systems with dense matrix. In a recent work [J. Comput. Math., 22 (2004), pp. 287-298], it is demonstrated that the dense matrix can be replaced by a sparse one if appropriate graded meshes are used in the quadrature rules. The numerical experiments also indicate that the proposed numerical methods require less computational time than the conventional ones while the formal rate of convergence can be preserved. The purpose of this work is to establish a stability and convergence theory for this fast numerical method. The stability analysis depends on a decomposition of the coefficient matrix for the collocation equation. The formal orders of convergence observed in the numerical experiments are proved rigorously.",

The parallel in time approach follows the spirit of the domain decomposition that consists of breaking the domain of computation into subdomains and solving iteratively the subproblems in a parallel way. To obtain a high order of accuracy, a spectral collocation accuracy enhancement in subdomains will be employed. Our main contributions in this work are twofold: (i) A time parareal method is designed for the integral equations, which to our knowledge is the first of its kind. The new method is an iterative process combining a coarse prediction in the whole domain with fine corrections in subdomains by using spectral approximation, leading to an algorithm of very high accuracy. (ii) A rigorous convergence analysis of the overall method is provided. The numerical experiment confirms that the overall computational cost is considerably reduced while the desired spectral rate of convergence can be obtained. \u00a9 2013 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.",

The main difficulty in developing this moving mesh scheme is how to keep it divergence-free for the velocity field at each time level. The proposed numerical scheme extends a recent moving grid method based on harmonic mapping [R. Li, T. Tang, and P. W. Zhang, J. Comput. Phys., 170 (2001), pp. 562--588], which decouples the PDE solver and the mesh-moving algorithm. This approach requires interpolating the solution on the newly generated mesh. Designing a divergence-free-preserving interpolation algorithm is the first goal of this work. Selecting suitable monitor functions is important and is found challenging for the incompressible flow simulations, which is the second goal of this study. The performance of the moving mesh scheme is tested on the standard periodic double shear layer problem. No spurious vorticity patterns appear when even fairly coarse grids are used.",

Phys., 3 (2008), pp. 505-518] employed the generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) method and demonstrated that when uncertainty causes the change of characteristic directions, the resulting deterministic system of equations is a symmetric hyperbolic system with both positive and negative eigen-values. Consequently, a consistent method of imposing the boundary conditions is proposed and its convergence is established under the assumption that the expansion coefficients decay fast asymptotically. In this work, we investigate stochastic collocation methods for the same type of scalar wave equation with random wave speed. It will be demonstrated that the rate of convergence depends on the regularity of the solutions; and the regularity is determined by the random wave speed and the initial and boundary data. Numerical examples are presented to support the analysis and also to show the sharpness of the assumptions on the relationship between the random wave speed and the initial and boundary data. An accuracy enhancement technique is investigated following the multi-element collocation method proposed by Foo, Wan and Karniadakis [J. Comput. Phys., 227 (2008), pp. 9572-9595].",

The finite-element scheme can easily accommodates complex flow geometry and the moving mesh strategy can cluster more grid points near the thin interfacial areas where the solutions have large gradients.

There have been some recent interests in using high-order Runge-Kutta methods in the prediction and correction steps in the SDC methods, and higher order rate of convergence is obtained provided that the quadrature nodes are uniform. The assumption of the use of uniform mesh has a serious practical drawback as the well-known Runge phenomenon may prevent the use of reasonably large number of quadrature nodes. In this work, we propose a modified SDC methods with high-order integrators which can yield higher convergence rates on both uniform and non-uniform quadrature nodes.

In obtaining the variational mesh, we will solve an optimization problem with some appropriate constraints, which is in contrast to the traditional method of solving the Euler\u2013Lagrange equation directly. The key idea of this approach is to update the interior and boundary grids simultaneously, rather than considering them separately.

Convergence rate for the derivative of the approximate solutions is established under the assumption that a weak pointwise-error estimate is given. In other words, we are able to convert weak pointwise-error estimates to optimal error bounds in a weighted W1,1 space.For convex conservation laws, the assumption of a weak pointwise-error estimate is verified by Tadmor [ SIAM J.

Furthermore, the $\\cO(\\en)$-pointwise-error estimates of Tadmor and Tang [ SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 36 (1999), pp. 1739--1758] are recovered by the use of the W1,1-convergence result.",

When the solution domain is unbounded, the diffusion operator no longer has a compact resolvent, which makes the Hermite spectral methods unstable. To overcome this difficulty, a time-dependent scaling factor is employed in the Hermite expansions, which yields a positive bilinear form. As a consequence, stability and spectral convergence can be established for this approach. The present method plays a similar role in the stability of the {similarity transformation} technique proposed by Funaro and Kavian [Math. Comp., 57 (1991), pp. 597--619]. However, since coordinate transformations are not required, the present approach is more efficient and is easier to implement. In fact, with the time-dependent scaling the resulting discretization system is of the same form as that associated with the classical (straightforward but unstable) Hermite spectral method. Numerical experiments are carried out to support the theoretical stability and convergence results.",

An error analysis for the proposed spectral method is presented. Two transformation functions are considered in detail. In solving singularly perturbed problems with conventional spectral methods, spectral accuracy can only be obtained when N = O(\u03b5\u2212\u03b3 ) ,w here \u03b5 is the singular perturbation parameter and \u03b3 is a positive constant. Our main effort is to make this \u03b3 smaller, say from 1 2 to 1 4 or less for Helmholtz type equations, by using appropriate coordinate stretching. Similar results are also obtained for advection-diffusion equations. Two important features of the proposed method are as follows: (a) the coordinate transformation does not involve the singular perturbation parameter \u03b5; (b) machine accuracy can be achieved with N of the order of several hundreds, even when \u03b5 is very small.

The algorithms are formed by two independent parts: PDE evolution and mesh-redistribution. The first part can be any appropriate high-resolution scheme, and the second part is based on an iterative procedure. In each iteration, meshes are first redistributed by an equidistribution principle, and then on the resulting new grids the underlying numerical solutions are updated by a conservative-interpolation formula proposed in this work. The iteration for the mesh-redistribution at a given time step is complete when the meshes governed by a nonlinear equation reach the equilibrium state. The main idea of the proposed method is to keep the mass-conservation of the underlying numerical solution at each redistribution step. In one dimension, we can show that the underlying numerical approximation obtained in the mesh-redistribution part satisfies the desired TVD property, which guarantees that the numerical solution at any time level is TVD, provided that the PDE solver in the first part satisfies such a property. Several test problems in one and two dimensions are computed using the proposed moving mesh algorithm. The computations demonstrate that our methods are efficient for solving problems with shock discontinuities, obtaining the same resolution with a much smaller number of grid points than the uniform mesh approach.",

Particular attention is given to functions with random Gaussian or gamma parameters. We first demonstrate that the traditional Hermite (Laguerre) polynomials chaos expansion suffers from the instability in the sense that an unfeasible number of points, which is relevant to the dimension of the approximation space, is needed to guarantee the stability in the least-squares framework. We then propose to use the Hermite/Laguerre functions (rather than polynomials) as bases in the expansion. The corresponding design points are obtained by mapping the uniformly distributed random points in bounded intervals to the unbounded domain, which involved a mapping parameter L. By using the Hermite/Laguerre functions and a proper mapping parameter, the stability can be significantly improved even if the number of design points scales linearly (up to a logarithmic factor) with the dimension of the approximation space. Apart from the stability, another important issue is the rate of convergence. To speed up the convergence, an effective scaling factor is introduced, and a principle for choosing quasi-optimal scaling factor is discussed. Applications to parametric uncertainty quantification are illustrated by considering a random ODE model together with an elliptic problem with lognormal random input.",

        "abstract": "A robust high-order algorithm is proposed to solve steady Euler equations on unstructured grids. The main ingredients of the algorithm include a standard Newton method as the outer iterative scheme and a linear multigrid method as the inner iterative scheme with the block lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LU-SGS) iteration as its smoother. The Jacobian matrix of the Newton-iteration is regularized by the local residual, instead of using the commonly adopted time-stepping relaxation technique based on the local CFL number. The local Jacobian matrix of the numerical fluxes are computed using the numerical differentiation, which can significantly simplify the implementations by comparing with the manually derived approximate derivatives. The approximate polynomial of solution on each cell is reconstructed by using the values on centroid of the cell, and limited by the WENO hierarchical limiting strategy proposed by Xu et al. [Z.L. Xu, Y.J. Liu, C.W. Shu, Hierarchical reconstruction for discontinuous galerkin methods on unstructured grids with a WENO-type linear reconstruction and partial neighboring cells, Journal of Computational Physics 228 (2009) 2194-2212]. It is found that the proposed algorithm is insensitive to the parameters used. More precisely, in our computations, only one set of the parameters (namely, the proportional constant @a for the local residual, the relaxation parameter @t in the Newton-iteration, the weight @m in the WENO scheme and the number of smoothing steps in the multigrid solver) is employed for various geometrical configurations and free-stream configurations. The high-order and robustness of our algorithm are illustrated by considering two-dimensional airfoil problems with different geometrical configurations and different free-stream configurations.",

Current stream programming languages expose the management of SRF to the programmer, incurring heavy burden on the programmer and bringing difficulties to inheriting the legacy codes. SF95 is the language developed for FT64 which is the first 64-bit stream processor designed for scientific applications. SF95 conceals SRF from the programmer and leaves the management of SRF to its compiler. In this paper, we present a compiler approach named SRF Coloring to manage SRF automatically. The novelties of this paper are: first, it is the first time to use the graph coloring-based algorithm for the SRF management; second, an algorithm framework for SRF Coloring that is well suited to the FT64 architecture is proposed -- this framework is based on a well-understood graph coloring algorithm for register allocation, together with some modifications to deal with the unusual aspects of SRF problem; third, the SRF Coloring algorithm is implemented in SF95 Compiler, a compiler designed for FT64 and SF95. The experimental results show that our approach represents a practical and promising solution to SRF allocation.",

        "abstract": "GPUs render higher computing unit density than contemporary CPUs and thus exhibit much higher power consumption despite its higher power efficiency. The power consumption has become an important issue that impacts GPU's applications, thereby necessitating the low power optimization technology for GPUs. Software prefetching is an efficient way to alleviate the memory wall problem which overlaps the computing and memory access latencies. However, software prefetching will cause some power overhead because it increases the number and density of the instructions. Thus, we should consider the balance between the performance income and the power overhead when applying the optimization. To address this problem, in this paper we first analyze the multi-thread execution model of GPU and validate the potential space of software prefetching optimization. Then we give the software prefetching method for GPU programs to improve the performance. Aiming at two different objects: energy optimization under performance constraint and performance optimization under power constraint, we discuss the optimization methods based on software prefetching and dynamic voltage scaling technologies. The experimental results show that our method can efficiently optimize the energy consumption(performance) under the performance(power) constraint.",

        "abstract": "With the continues development of hardware and software, GPU has been used in general purpose computation field, accelerating applications for CPU. To achieve high computing performance, GPU typically includes hundreds of computing units. The high density of computing resource on chip brings in high power consumption as well as high performance. The power consumption problem has become one of the most important problems for the development of GPU. The DVFS technique is widely used to optimize power consumption for processors. However, applying the DVFS technique to GPU depends on the analysis of program execution on GPU, so that optimization strategy can be chosen according to the program feature. Besides, GPU is comprised of a processor chip and an off-chip DRAM system. Some previous researches point out that the power consumption optimization for such a system should involve both the processor and the DRAM, to achieve better optimization effect. Based on an existing GPU analytical model, this paper proposes a GPU power optimization model under performance restriction, involving both the processor and the DRAM on GPU. For a given program, the model gives the DVFS strategies for the processor and the DRAM respectively with an appointed performance restriction. The authors choose nine test cases to evaluate the model on three simulated GPU platforms. The experimental results show that the model can achieve optimal energy consumption while the performance deviation from the restriction is less than 10%.",

But the powerful computing capacity could not be fully utilized for memory-intensive applications, which are limited by off-chip memory bandwidth and latency. Stencil computation has abundant parallelism and low computational intensity which make it a useful architectural evaluation benchmark. In this paper, we propose some memory optimizations for a stencil based application mgrid from SPEC 2 K benchmarks. Through exploiting data locality in 3-level memory hierarchies and tuning the thread granularity, we reduce the pressure on the off-chip memory bandwidth. To hide the long off-chip memory access latency, we further prefetch data during computation through double-buffer. In order to fully exploit the CPU-GPU heterogeneous system, we redistribute the computation between these two computing resource. Through all these optimizations, we gain 24.2 x speedup compared to the simple mapping version, and get as high as 34.3 x speedup when compared with a CPU implementation.",

Compared with the traditional parallel systems, heterogeneous systems integerating stream-based multi-threaded GPUs provide higher parallel computing capabilities with lower cost. However, porting traditional applications to the heterogeneous systems makes new demand of application optimization on GPU. Based on the AMD's Brook+ platform, we explored application optimization features on AMD GPU by optimizing and implementing the benchmark LBM from SPEC2006. To improve the program locality, we optimized the original data layout of LBM. Using the short vector data types mechanism provided by Brook+, we also optimized the GPU's bandwidth utilization and its thread processors' efficiency. Through the branch elimination technique, we reduced the performance lose caused by branch divergences in the kernel, which is due to the GPU's SIMD executing mode. The experiment results show that data layout, memory bandwidth, branch paths and other factors have a close effect on the performance of program execution on the GPU. Through all the optimizations, we finally got a speedup of 22x (single-precision) and 19x (double-precision) over the original serial benchmark code on a Quad-core CPU, and a speedup of 4x (single-precision) and 8.7x (double-precision) over the original OMP benchmark code on a 8-core CPU.",

        "abstract": "With fast development of GPU hardware and software, using GPUs to accelerate non-graphics CPU applications is becoming inevitable trend. GPUs are good at performing ALU-intensive computation and feature high peak performance; however, how to harness GPUs' powerful computing capacity to accelerate the applications in the field of scientific computing still remains a big challenge. In this paper, we implement the whole application Mgrid taken from Spec2000 benchmarks on an AMD GPU and propose several optimization strategies for stencil computations in the naive GPU code. We first improve thread utilization through using vector types and multiple output streams mechanism provided by the Brook+ programming language. By tuning thread granularity, we try to hit the right balance between locality within each thread and parallelism among threads. Then, we reorganize the stream layout by transforming the 3D data stream into the 2D stream in the block manner. Through stream reorganization, more data locality in the cache is exploited. Further, we propose branch elimination to convert control dependence to data dependence, catering to GPUs' powerful ALU-intensive processing capability. Finally, we redistribute computations between CPU and GPU to make more advisable computing resources usage considering different problem sizes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed optimization strategies on an AMD Radeon HD4870 GPU using the Brook+ programming language. Using a double-precision floating-point implementation, the experimental results show that the optimized GPU version of Mgrid gains 2.38x speedup compared to the naive GPU code and obtains as high as 15.06x speedup versus the CPU implementation run on an Intel Xeon E5405 CPU.",

        "abstract": "In light of its powerful computing capacity and high energy efficiency, GPU (graphics processing unit) has become a focus in the research field of HPC (High Performance Computing). CPU-GPU heterogeneous parallel systems have become a new development trend of super-computer. However, the inherent unreliability of the GPU hardware deteriorates the reliability of super-computer. We have researched on the fault-tolerance(FT) technique for CPU-GPU heterogeneous parallel systems, and introduced a new checkpointing mechanism, i.e., the hierarchical application-level checkpointing, for such systems. The basic idea of this new checkpointing mechanism is checkpointing at two independent levels, i.e., CPU level and GPU level, to tolerate CPU and GPU faults respectively. Based on the idea, we have also designed and implemented a hierarchical application-level checkpointing tool \"HiAL-Ckpt\". Using this tool, programmers can insert two kinds of directives, i.e., CPU directives and GPU directives into a program, and the compiler will transform the directives into CPU or GPU checkpointing codes according to their nature. From the case study of SWIM, a test bench from spec2000 benchmark suite, we have demonstrated the validity of the hierarchical application-level checkpointing technique. The experimental results show that the falut-tolerance temporal cost of HiAL-Ckpt for SWIM is only 2.25%, compared with the executing time of SWIM without any FT work. \u00a92010 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), with many light-weight data-parallel cores, can provide substantial parallel computing power to accelerate several general purpose applications. Both the AMD and NVIDIA corps provide their specific high performance GPUs and software platforms. As the floating-point computing capacity increases continually, the problem of ``memory-wall'' becomes more serious, especially for array-intensive applications. In this paper, we optimize and implement two SPEC2k benchmarks mgrid and swim on multithreaded GPU using CUDA and Brook+. In order to reduce the pressure on off-chip memory, we make use of data locality in multi-level memory hierarchies and hide long memory access latency via double-buffers. To balance inter-thread parallelism and intra-thread locality, we further tune thread granularity for each kernel and empirically study the best equilibrium point for this problem. Flow control instruction can significantly impact the effective instruction throughput. Oriented to this problem, we introduce a diverge elimination technology to convert condition expression into computing operation. Through all the optimizations, we gain the speedup of 10\u00c3\u0097-34\u00c3\u0097 to the CPU implementation on the GPUs of AMD and NVIDIA respectively. Finally, we summarize and compares the GPUs from AMD and NVIDIA in hardware and software.",

Firstly, the paper builds a prefetching and reusing optimizations guided parameter model that characterizes the effect of strip size on program behavios. Secondly, based on the model analysis, this paper explores the optimal strip size selection approaches to the computation intensive programs and memory intensive programs respectively.

Generally, OpenMP is used to develop fine-grained parallelism through a multi-thread model. Stream programming model is a new kind of parallel programming model for stream architectures. OpenMP bears a resemblance to the stream programming model at some level. The transformation between the two models has attracted much attention from the research community, since it is the foundation of porting programs between the two architectures. Most related researches focus on the efficiency of porting existing parallel programs to the new architectures such as GPUs. Very few of these studies, however, focus on the portative problem systematically, namely, what kind of parallel programs can be or should be transplanted into stream programs and mapped to run on the stream processors. In this paper, we study the mapping relationship of parallel mechanism in OpenMP to the stream programming model, and point out those parallel mechanisms in OpenMP that are infeasible or undesirable for stream programs. By analyzing two typical benchmarks, we draw the conclusion that a majority of scientific applications are suitable to be mapped to the stream programming model. Our conclusion effectively validates the idea of accelerating scientific applications with the stream processors.",

To address this problem, this paper presents a novel architecture-based optimization for the key techniques of mapping scientific applications to Imagine. Our specific contributions include that we achieve fine kernel granularity and choose necessary arrays to organize appropriate streams. Specially, we develop a new stream program generation algorithm based on the architecture-based optimization. We implement our algorithm to some representative scientific applications on ISIM simulation of Imagine, compared the corresponding FORTRAN programs running on Itanium 2. The experimental results show that the optimizing stream programs can efficiently improve computational intensiveness, enhance locality of LRF and SRF, avoid index stream overhead and enable parallelism to utilize ALUs. It is certain that Imagine is efficient for many scientific applications.",

        "abstract": "Existing scratchpad memory (SPM) allocation algorithms for arrays, whether they rely on well-crafted heuristics or resort to integer linear programming (ILP) techniques, typically assume that every array is small enough to fit directly into the SPM. As a result, some arrays have to be spilled entirely to the off-chip memory in order to make room for other arrays to stay in the SPM, resulting in sometimes poor SPM utilization. In this paper, we introduce a new comparability graph coloring allocator that integrates for the first time data tiling and SPM allocation for arrays by tiling arrays on-demand to improve utilization of the SPM. The novelty lies in repeatedly identifying the heaviest path in an array interference graph and then reducing its weight by tiling certain arrays on the path appropriately with respect to the size of the SPM. The effectiveness of our allocator, which is presently restricted to tiling 1-D arrays, is validated by using a number of selected benchmarks for which existing allocators are ineffective.",

        "abstract": "High power consumption has become one of the top considerations in high performance computing field. Recently, there are many studies focused on optimizing the system performance within a given power budget. However, most existing solutions are explored for homogeneous system without considering the differences in power consumption and processing speed between heterogeneous processors, and therefore could not be adapted for accelerator-based heterogeneous parallel system effectively. This paper first summarizes the execution model of modern accelerator-based parallel system, and then introduces the power control framework consisting of two power management hierarchies, i.e. system-level power controller and heterogeneous processing engine power controller from top to bottom. In the lower level controller, targeted for OpenMP-like parallel loop, the paper first theoretically analyzes the conditions for the maximum performance given a power budget for heterogeneous processors. Based on this result, the paper provides a power-constrained parallel loop scheduling algorithm which coordinates parallel loop partition and voltage/frequency scaling for heterogeneous processers to achieve the optimal performance given a system power budget. In the upper level controller, the paper establishes the evaluation metrics for heterogeneous processing engine to allocate power budget, in order to keep fairness between concurrent applications and improve the whole system efficiency. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed method in a typical CPU-GPU system. \u00a9 2013 ISCAS.",

        "abstract": "Using the graphics processing unit (GPU) to accelerate the general purpose computation has attracted much attention from both the academia and industry due to GPU's powerful computing capacity. Thus optimization of GPU programs has become a popular research direction. In order to support the general purpose computing more efficiently, GPU has integrated the general data cache to replace the existing software-managed on-chip memory. Consequently, improving the usage of the data cache becomes of vital importance to improve the performance of the GPU programs. The foundation of cache locality optimizations is efficient analysis and prediction of the cache behavior. Unfortunately, existing cache miss analysis models are based on sequential programs and thus cannot be used to analyze the GPU programs directly. In this paper, based on the deep analysis of GPU's execution model, we propose, for the first time, a cache miss analysis model for the GPU programs. We divide the problem into two subproblems: stack distance profile analysis of single thread block and cache contention analysis of multiple thread blocks. The experimental results from nine typical application kernels in the scientific computing field illustrate that our method is efficient and can be used to guide the cache locality optimizations for the GPU programs.",

X-ray structural analyses of 2 \u2013 4 were performed. 2 and 3 belong to the high symmetrical space group ( Cmcm ) with the same structures, they are THF-solvated 9-coordinate monomeric in the solid state, while 4 is an unsolvated 9-coordinate monomer with a trans arrangement of both the sidearms and indenyl rings in the solid state. Additionally, 2 and 3 show moderate polymerization activities for \u03b5-caprolactone (CL). Keywords 3-(2-Pyridylmethyl) indenyl Divalent lanthanides Crystal structure \u03b5-Caprolactone 1 Introduction Recently, considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring the organometallic chemistry of metallocenes with donor-functionalized side chains [1] , because the donor-functionalized side chains can increase the stability of highly reactive organolanthanide complexes by forming intramolecular chelating coordination with the central metal. Most of the ligands used are those with ether- or amino-substituted cyclopentadienyl groups. Although divalent lanthanides with \u03b7 5 -bonded aromatic carbocyclic ligands are regarded as the prospective catalysts for the polymerization of both polar and non-polar monomers [2] , investigations on divalent indenyllanthanides are still limited. So far, only few amino-substituted indenyl ligands of divalent lanthanocenes were reported, such as [Me 2 Si(Me 2 NCH 2 CH 2 C 9 H 5 )( t -BuNH)] 2 Yb [3] , (Me 2 NCH 2 CH 2 C 9 H 5 SiMe 3 ) 2 Yb [3] , (Me 2 NCH 2 CH 2 C 9 H 6 ) 2 Yb [3,4] and (C 4 H 8 NMe 2 SiCH 2 C 9 H 5 Me) 2 Eu [5] , but no samarium(II) complexes were X-ray characterized. Since no pyridyl-functionalized indenyl ligands have been used in lanthanides, we prepared 3-(2-pyridylmethyl) indenyl ligand in order to study its coordination behavior in divalent lanthanides and trivalent lanthanide chlorides. Here, we report the synthesis and crystal structures of bis(3-(2-pyridylmethyl)indenyl) divalent lanthanide complexes (C 5 H 4 NCH 2 C 9 H 6 ) 2 Ln II (THF) (Ln = Sm ( 2 ), Yb ( 3 )), and bis(3-(2-pyridylmethyl)indenyl) trivalent lanthanide chlorides (C 5 H 4 NCH 2 C 9 H 6 ) 2 Ln III Cl (Ln = Nd ( 4 ), Sm ( 5 )). The polymerization activities of 2 and 3 for \u03b5-caprolactone were investigated. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Synthesis The reaction of 3-(2-pyridylmethyl) indenyl lithium ( 1 ) with LnI 2 (THF) 2 (Ln = Sm, Yb) in THF generates the divalent organolanthanides (C 5 H 4 NCH 2 C 9 H 6 ) 2 Sm II (THF) ( 2 ) and (C 5 H 4 NCH 2 C 9 H 6 ) 2 Yb II (THF) ( 3 ) in high yields ( Scheme 1 ). The complexes are dissolved in a donor solvent such as THF and diglyme, only soluble on heating in aromatic solvents such as toluene, and insoluble in hexane. Complexes 2 and 3 in solution are air and moisture sensitive, but their crystals can be kept in air for several minutes without decomposition. Complex 3 was obtained as an unexpected product in the attempted synthesis of (C 5 H 4 NCH 2 C 9 H 6 ) 2 Yb III Cl by the reaction of YbCl 3 with 3-(2-pyridylmethyl) indenyl lithium ( 1 ) ( Scheme 2 ). It is possible that the alkyllithium of the ligand acts as a reductant. Other alkali salts [6] were reported to reduce the Yb(III) to Yb(II) complexes, such as KC 7 H 11 , Na 2 [(C 9 H 6 ) 2 C(CH 3 ) 2 ] and n -BuLi. The reaction between anhydrous lanthanide chlorides (Ln = Nd, Sm) and two equivalents of 3-(2-pyridylmethyl) indenyl lithium ( 1 ) in THF afforded (C 5 H 4 NCH 2 C 9 H 6 ) 2 Nd III Cl ( 4 ) and (C 5 H 4 NCH 2 C 9 H 6 ) 2 Sm III Cl ( 5 ). These complexes are soluble in THF and dissolved in toluene only on heating. All complexes in solution are air and moisture sensitive, but their crystals can be kept for long time (about 1 h) in air. All the complexes were characterized by spectroscopic and elemental analyses. IR spectroscopic analyses showed obvious characteristic absorption of pyridyl group at about 1591 cm \u22121 , and indenyl group at about 3060, 3030, 1475, 1435 and 770 cm \u22121 . In EI-mass spectrum, the fragments of the ligand, such as [C 5 H 4 N] + and [C 5 H 4 CH 2 C 9 H 6 ] + , show high intensity, while the intensities of other fragments, such as [M] + and [M\u2013L] + are weak. 3 Molecular structures of 2 and 3 Crystals of complexes 2 and 3 suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained by recrystallization from THF and diglyme, respectively. Details of crystal data collections and the structure refinements are listed in Table 1 , and selected bond lengths and angles are given in Table 2 . Complexes 2 and 3 belong to the same crystal system (orthorhombic) and space group ( Cmcm ) with similar crystal data. So, they are isostructural and the molecular structure of 3 is presented in Fig. 1 . In complex 3 , the whole molecule shows one C 2 symmetry about the Yb\u2013O(1) axis and two symmetrical planes, perpendicular each other. It means that five atoms of THF and Yb are on the same plane. This is almost certainly an artifact of crystallographic disorder. Therefore, complexes 2 and 3 show very high symmetry, which is most unusual in low valent orgnaolanthanide complexes. This molecule can also be described as the overlapping of two enantiomorphic molecules (part a and part b, as shown in Fig. 2 ) in the same position in the unit cell, and their space occupation ratio is 50:50. While most of the coordination number of divalent lanthanocenes is 8, only several complexes are 9-coordinate, such as (C 9 H 7 ) 2 Sm II (THF) 3 [7] and (MeOCH 2 CH 2 C 5 H 2 ) 2 Yb II (THF) [8] . As shown in Fig. 2 , complex 3 is THF-solvated 9-coordinate monomeric in the solid state. The central ytterbium atom is coordinated by two indenyls, two nitrogen atoms of pyridyls and one oxygen atom of THF to form a distorted trigonal bipyramid. The two nitrogen atoms lie at both apices, and the oxygen atom, the central metal atom and the two centroids of cyclopentadienyl rings of indenes form the equatorial plane. The general structural features of complex 2 are similar to those already discussed for complex 3 . The samarium center is bound to the indenyl ring in an \u03b7 5 -manner; the samarium\u2013carbon bond lengths range from 2.809(4) to 2.911(5) \u00c5 with an average 2.851 \u00c5 as compared to a range of 2.81(1)\u20132.91(1) \u00c5 and an average of 2.86(3) \u00c5 in (C 5 Me 5 ) 2 Sm II (THF) 2 [9] . The Sm\u2013Cent distance of 2.580 \u00c5 is also comparable to a related value of 2.631 \u00c5 reported for (C 13 H 9 ) 2 Sm II (THF) 2 [7] , 2.583 \u00c5 for [C 5 Me 4 SiMe 2 ( i Pr-tacn)]Sm II I [10] and 2.534 \u00c5 for [(C 5 Me 5 )Sm II (\u03bc-I)(THF) 2 ] 2 [9] . The samarium\u2013nitrogen bond length is 2.691(5) \u00c5, which is typical for distances between samarium and bulky amine donors, and is similar to the bond lengths observed in (1,4,7-triazacyclononoane-1,4,7-triltris(2-(ethylimino)-propionato))samarium (2.669(4)\u20132.690(4) \u00c5) [11] . The samarium\u2013oxygen bond length of 2.584(4) \u00c5 is longer than the corresponding bonds observed in (C 13 H 9 ) 2 Sm II (THF) 2 (2.560(6)\u20132.540(6) \u00c5) [7] , but shorted than that reported for (C 5 Me 5 ) 2 Sm II (THF) 2 (2.62(1)\u20132.66(1) \u00c5) [9] . In complex 2 , the Cent\u2013Sm\u2013Cent\u2032 angle of 122.5\u00b0 is significantly smaller than the 136.8\u00b0 in (C 5 Me 5 ) 2 Sm II (THF) 2 [9] . From the dihedral angles of four planes, it is concluded that two pyridyl rings are almost perpendicular (P(2)\u22efP(4) = 87.1\u00b0), while one indenyl ring is nearly parallel to the pyridyl ring connected with the another indenyl ring (P(1)\u22efP(4) = 14.7\u00b0). The smaller ionic radius of ytterbium versus samarium results in smaller Ln\u2013O (2.449(5) vs 2.584(4) \u00c5), Ln\u2013N (2.691(5) vs 2.587(7) \u00c5), and Ln\u2013C(2.782(av) vs 2.851(av) \u00c5) bond lengths in complex 3 . A comparison of selected geometric parameters in some ytterbium(II) complexes bearing pendent N-donors is listed in Table 3 . It should be noted that the geometry of other Yb(II) complexes is a distorted tetrahedron, different from 3 . It is found that the N\u2013Yb\u2013N angle (159\u00b0) in 3 is the largest in all these Yb(II) complexes. The average value of the Yb\u2013C distance 2.782(8) \u00c5 in 3 is shorter than the corresponding value of 2.806(12) \u00c5 in [Me 2 Si(Me 2 NCH 2 CH 2 C 9 H 5 )( t -BuNH)] 2 Yb [3] , but is longer than the related values in other Yb(II) complexes. The average Yb\u2013N distance 2.587(7) \u00c5 in 3 is shorter than the value of 2.673(11) \u00c5 in [Me 2 Si(Me 2 NCH 2 CH 2 C 9 H 5 )( t -BuNH)] 2 Yb [3] and 2.650(12) \u00c5 in (Me 2 NCH 2 CH 2 C 9 H 5 SiMe 3 ) 2 Yb [3] , similar to the value of 2.588(7) \u00c5 in (Me 2 NCH 2 CH 2 C 9 H 6 ) 2 Yb [3,4] and 2.603(4) \u00c5 in [Me 2 NCH(Me)CH 2 C 5 H 4 ] 2 Yb [12] , but significantly larger than 2.48(1) \u00c5 in Yb(Cp py ) 2 [13] and Yb(Cp py(s) ) 2 [13] . All these results depend on the steric effects and geometry. It is interesting to note that the bond lengths of Yb\u2013C(2) and Yb\u2013C(7) in 3 are significantly longer than those of Ln\u2013C(1), Ln\u2013C(8) and Ln\u2013C(9), indicating that the coordination mode of the metal atom with indenyl ligands is beginning to partially slipped toward \u03b7 3 - from \u03b7 5 -mode. 4 Molecular structures of 4 Crystals of complex 4 suitable for X-ray diffraction were grown by cooling the concentrated solution to \u221230 \u00b0C. The molecular structure of 4 is presented in Fig. 3 , and selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 4 . Although complex 4 crystallizes from the THF solutions, it remains to be unsolvated 9-coordinate monomeric in solid state. The central Nd atom is coordinated by two indenyls, two nitrogen atoms of pyridyls and one chlorine atom to form a distorted trigonal bipyramid. The two nitrogen atoms lie at both apices, and the chlorine atom, the central metal atom and the two centroids of cyclopentadienyl rings of indenes form the equatorial plane. The Nd center is bound to the indenyl ring in a \u03b7 5 -manner. The Nd\u2013C bond lengths range from 2.707(7) to 2.836(8) \u00c5 with an average 2.766 \u00c5, resulting in a Nd\u2013Cent(av) distance of 2.491 \u00c5. This compares with a related value of 2.513 \u00c5 reported for (C 4 H 7 OCH 2 C 9 H 6 ) 2 NdCl [14] . The Nd\u2013Cl bond length of 2.682(2) \u00c5 is longer than the corresponding value of 2.678(3) \u00c5 in (C 4 H 7 OCH 2 C 9 H 6 ) 2 NdCl [13] , 2.672(2) \u00c5 in (CH 3 OCH 2 CH 2 C 9 H 6 ) 2 NdCl [15] and 2.668(2) \u00c5 in [O(CH 2 CH 2 C 9 H 6 ) 2 ]NdCl [16] , but shorter than 2.6989(7) \u00c5 in (Me 2 NCH 2 CH 2 C 5 H 4 ) 2 NdCl. The Nd\u2013N bond lengths of (2.652(6), 2.642(6) \u00c5) is shorter than those observed in (Me 2 NCH 2 CH 2 C 5 H 4 ) 3 Nd (2.73(1), 2.70(1) \u00c5) [17] and (Me 2 NCH 2 CH 2 C 5 H 4 ) 2 NdCl (2.804(2), 2.772(2) \u00c5) [18] . The N(1)\u2013Nd\u2013N(2) angle of 164.48\u00b0 is similar to the corresponding value of 161.9(2)\u00b0 in (Me 2 NCH 2 CH 2 C 5 H 4 ) 2 NdCl. The RA angle of 157.9\u00b0, which means the conformation of two indenyl rings is staggering, is similar to 157.7\u00b0 in (C 4 H 7 OCH 2 C 9 H 6 ) 2 NdCl [14] . From the dihedral angles of four planes, it is concluded that two pyridyl rings are almost perpendicular (P(2)\u22efP(4) = 82.6\u00b0), while one indenyl ring is nearly parallel to the pyridyl ring connected with the other indenyl ring (P(2)\u22efP(3) = 23.8\u00b0, P(1)\u22efP(4) = 9.7\u00b0). 5 Polymerization of \u03b5-caprolactone The activities of complexes 2 and 3 as single-component catalysts in \u03b5-caprolactone polymerization were investigated. The results are summarized in Table 5 . It was found that 2 shows higher activity than 3 , consist with their different electrode potentials ( E 0 ) between the trivalent and divalent oxidation states. With the increase in molar ratio of [CL]/[Cat], the molecular weight of the polymers increases, while PDI begins to broaden, which can be explained by partial chain termination caused by deactivation of the catalysts by a trace amount of impurities or living chain transfer in the reaction. Compared with other high active catalysts for CL, such as (C 13 H 9 ) 2 Sm(THF) 2 [19] , Sm(ArO) 2 (THF) 3 [20] , and [(C 5 Me 5 )Sm(\u03bc-OAr)] 2 [20] , which were reported that polymers with millions of molecular weights can be got in several minutes with high conversion, 2 and 3 show low activities. These can be explained by the fact that the introduction of intramolecular coordination can increase the stability of the complexes and decrease their catalyst activities at the same time. The existence of coordinated THF in the molecule can be the other reason. The catalytic activities of complexes 2 and 3 for the polymerization for other monomers, such as MMA, lactide, are disappointed, only lower molecular weights of polymers were got. 6 Conclusion We have synthesized a series of complexes of divalent and trivalent lanthanides with pyridyl-functionalized indenyl ligand by metathesis reaction of Ln(II) iodides or Ln(III) chlorides with the alkyllithium of the ligand. The intramolecular coordination of the pyridyl groups with the central atom was confirmed by X-ray structure determiniation for complexes 2 \u2013 4 . Molecular structures of 2 and 3 show high symmetry, significantly different from previous reports on divalent bis-indenyl lanthanides. 4 is unsolvated 9-coordinate monomeric complex with a trans arrangement of both the pyridyl and indenyl rings in the solid state. 7 Experimental 7.1 Materials and methods All manipulations involving orgnaometallics were carried out under an inert atmosphere of argon using standard Schlenk techniques. After drying over 4A molecular sieves, tetrahydrofuran (THF), diglyme ([MeOCH 2 CH 2 ] 2 O), toluene, and hexane were distilled under argon from sodium/potassium alloy with benzophenone ketyl prior to use. C 5 H 4 NCH 2 C 9 H 7 [21] , NdCl 3 [22] , YbCl 3 [22] , SmCl 3 [22] , SmI 2 (THF) 2 [23] , YbI 2 (THF) 2 [23] were prepared according to published procedures; n -butyllithium and \u03b5-caprolactone (CL) were purchased from Aldrich, the latter being distilled over CaH 2 before use. Analyses of rare earth metals and chlorine were accomplished using direct complexometric titration with disodium EDTA and the Volhard method, respectively. Carbon and hydrogen analysis were carried out by combustion method. IR spectra were recorded on Bio-Rad FTS135 spectrometer in the form of KBr pellets. Mass spectra were recorded on a LGQ spectrometer. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis of polymer samples were carried at 35 \u00b0C using THF as eluent on Water410 instrument and calibrated using monodispersed polystyrene standards at a flow rate of 1.0 ml \u00b7 min \u22121 . 7.2 Preparation of 3-(2-pyridylmethyl) indenyl lithium ( 1 ) [24] To a solution of n -butyllithium (1.6 M in hexane, 30 ml) in 30 ml hexane was added dropwise C 5 H 4 NCH 2 C 9 H 7 (9.3 g, 0.045 mol in 50 ml hexane) with rigorous stirring at 0 \u00b0C, the resultant mixture was stirred for 1 h, then warmed to r.t. and stirred overnight. After centrifugation, the pale yellow precipitation was washed with hexane (2 \u00d7 30 ml), then 80 ml THF was added, and a clear orange yellow solution was obtained. Pale yellow crystals were obtained upon standing the solution at 0 \u00b0C for several days (10.77 g, 67%). 7.3 Preparation of (C 5 H 4 NCH 2 C 9 H 6 ) 2 Sm II (THF) ( 2 ) A THF solution of 3-(2-pyridylmethyl) indenyl lithium ( 1 ) (0.0072 mol, excess) was added to a solution of SmI 2 (THF) 2 (0.0035 mol) in THF (50 ml) at 0 \u00b0C. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm up to r.t. and stirred for 24 h. After centrifugation, the resulting dark solution was slowly concentrated in vacuum at r.t. until crystallization started. The concentrate was then cooled to \u221210 \u00b0C and kept for several days. The mother liquor was decanted from the black crystals of 2 , which were washed with cold THF and dried in vacuum (2.11 g, 95% yield). X-ray-quality crystals were grown from THF at 0 \u00b0C for several weeks. Anal. Calc. (%) for C 34 H 32 N 2 OSm: Sm, 23.78; C, 64.25; H, 5.04; N, 4.41.

The procedure followed was similar to that for complex 2 . This ytterbium complex was prepared from the reaction of 1 (0.0072 mol) with YbI 2 (THF) 2 (0.0035 mol) in THF as a dark red solid (2.07 g, 90% yield).

(b) From YbCl 3 . A THF solution of 1 (0.006 mmol) was added slowly to a suspension of YbCl 3 (0.8386 g, 0.003 mol in 20 ml THF) at low temperature (\u221260 to \u221278 \u00b0C). The reaction mixture was allowed to warm up to r.t. and stirred for 24 h. After centrifugation the solvent was evaporated in vacuo. The compound was extracted with 30 ml toluene/THF (10:1) and kept at \u221230 \u00b0C. Dark red crystals were obtained in 35% yield [25] . 7.5 Preparation of (C 5 H 4 NCH 2 C 9 H 6 ) 2 Nd III Cl ( 4 ) A THF solution of 1 (0.006 mol) was added dropwise to a stirred suspension of NdCl 3 (0.7522 g, 0.003 mol in 20 ml THF) at at low temperature (\u221260 to \u221278 \u00b0C). The mixture was allowed to warm up to r.t. and stirred to give a green solution. After centrifugation, the resulting solution was concentrated to about 10 ml. The complex (C 5 H 4 NCH 2 C 9 H 6 ) 2 Nd III Cl was isolated as green crystals (0.85 g, 48% yield) by cooling the solution to \u221230 \u00b0C for several days. Anal. Calc.

Data was collected on a Rigaku Rapid Diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo K\u03b1 ( \u03bb = 0.071073 \u00c5) radiation using the \u03c9 \u20132 \u03b8 technique at 293 K. The crystal structures were solved by direct methods and refined on F 2 by full-matrix least-squares methods, expanded using Fourier techniques [26] . All the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. In complex 4 , all the hydrogen atoms were added according to theoretical models with isotropic thermal parameters related to those of the supporting carbon atoms, but were not included in the refinement. The hydrogen atoms were not added in complexes 2 and 3 because of their special structures. All calculations were performed using the shelxs -97 crystallographic software package [27] . 9 Polymerization of \u03b5-caprolactone All polymerization reactions were carried out under argon. In a typical procedure, \u03b5-caprolactone was added to the solution of the initiator at the desired temperature. After a certain time, the polymerization was quenched with acidified methanol, and the polymer was precipitated. The resulting polymer was washed with methanol and dried in a vacuum at 35 \u00b0C to a constant weight. 10 Supplementary material Crystallographic data for the structures reported in this paper ( 1 \u2013 4 ) have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center as supplementary publication numbers CCDC 235620\u2013235623.

XRD results showed that the average periodic mesopore sizes of OMSs in the presence of urea were larger than those in the absence of urea. It was also found that the pore sizes of the products in the presence of urea distributed more narrowly than those in the absence of urea, and the contents of organosiloxane incorporated into OMSs, the pore wall thicknesses, the pore volumes and the surface areas of the products all increased with the use of urea.

        "abstract": "Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to study the miscibility of blends of a graft copolymer of poly(methyl methacrylate) on linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE-g-PMMA, G-3) with poly(vinylidene fluoride)b (PVF2) and the compatibilization of blends of LLDPE/PVF2. The specific interaction between PMMA side chains and PVF2 in G3/PVF2 binary blends is weaker than that between the homopolymers PMMA and PVF2. There are two states of PVF2 in the melt of a G-3/PVF2 (60/40, w/w) blend, one as pure PVF2 and the other interacting with PMMA side chains. The miscibility between PMMA side chains and PVF2 affects the crystallization of PVF2. LLDPE-g-PMMA was demonstrated to be a good compatibilizer in LLDPE/PVF2 blends, improving the interfacial adhesion and dispersion in the latter. Diffusion of PMMA side chains into PVF2 in the interfacial region reduces the crystallization rate and lowers the melting point (Tm) and the crystallization temperature (Tc) of PVF2 in the blends. ? 1996, H\ufffd\ufffdthig & Wepf Verlag.",

        "abstract": "The effects of both organically modified montmorillonite (OMMT) and Ni(2)O(3) on the carbonization of polypropylene (PP) during pyrolysis were investigated. The results from TEM and Raman spectroscopy showed that the carbonized products of PP were mainly multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). Surprisingly, a combination of OMMT and Ni(2)O(3) led to high-yield formation of MWNTs. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and GC-MS were used to investigate the mechanism of this combination for the high-yield formation of MWNTs from PP. Br\u00f8nsted acid sites were created in degraded OMMT layers by thermal decomposition of the modifiers. The resultant carbenium ions play an important role in the carbonization of PP and the formation of MWNTs. The degradation of PP was induced by the presence of carbenium ions to form predominantly products with lower carbon numbers that could be easily catalyzed by the nickel catalyst for the growth of MWNTs. Furthermore, carbenium ions are active intermediates that promote the growth of MWNTs from the degradation products with higher carbon numbers through hydride-transfer reactions. The XRD measurements showed that Ni(2)O(3) was reduced into metallic nickel (Ni) in situ to afford the active sites for the growth of MWNTs.",

In PP/ maleated polypropylene (PP-MA)/PA12=65/10/25 blend, simultaneous phase (PA12) is smaller than 0.5 \u03bcm, PP crystallizes first and its crystals induce the crystallization of PA12. When some of the PA12 particles are larger than 0.5 \u03bcm, this part of PA12 crystallizes first. Then this part of the PA12 crystals induces the crystallization of PP, and PP crystals induced the crystallization of PA12 fine droplets in turn.",

To prepare macromolecular brushes, two linear random copolymers of 2-(trimethylsilyloxy) ethyl methacrylate (HEMA-TMS) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) (poly(MMA-co-HEMA- TMS)) were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization and were subsequently derivated to azide-containing polymers. Novel alkyne-terminated RAFT chain transfer agent (CTA) was grafted to polymer backbones by copper-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (azide-alkyne click chemistry), and macro-RAFT CTAs were obtained. PNIPAM side chains were prepared by RAFT polymerization. The macromolecular brushes have well-defined structures, controlled molecular weights, and molecular weight distributions (M w/M n \u2266 1.23). The RAFT polymerization of NIPAM exhibited pseudo-first-order kinetics and a linear molecular weight dependence on monomer conversion, and no detectable termination was observed in the polymerization. The macromolecular brushes can self-assemble into micelles in aqueous solution. \u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Several factors affecting monomer conversion and molecular weight of polymer, such as polymerization time, temperature, monomer/catalyst ratio, and solvent, were examined. The results indicated that polymerization was rapid, with monomer conversions reaching 100% within 1 h, and the conformation of L-LA was retained. The structure of the block copolymer of CL/L-LA was characterized by NMR and differential scanning calorimetry. The morphological changes during crystallization of poly(caprolactone) (PCL)-b-P(L-LA) copolymer were monitored with real-time hot-stage atomic force microscopy (AFM). The effect of temperature on the morphological change and crystallization behavior of PCL-b-P(L-LA) copolymer was demonstrated through AFM observation.",

SEM results show that the domains of the dispersed phase in the blend become finer. DSC experiments reveal that the difference between the two T g 's corresponding to the phases in the blends becomes larger on addition of P(S- b -4VPy), mainly resulting from dissolving of the poly(4-vinylpyridine (P4VPy) block in the Zn-SPS phase. FTIR analysis shows that compatibility of P4VPy and Zn-SPS arises from the stoichiometric coordination of the zinc ions of Zn-SPS and pyridine nitrogens of P4VPy. SAXS analysis indicates the effect of the P(S- b -4VPy) content on the structure of the compatibilized blends. When the content of the block copolymer is lower than 4.1 wt%, the number of ion pairs in an aggregate in the Zn-SPS becomes smaller, and aggregates in ionomer in the blend become less organized with increasing P(S- b -4VPy). When the P(S- b -4VPy) content in the blend is up to 7.4 wt%, a fraction of P(S- b -4VPy) form a separate domain in the blend. Keywords Polymer blends Compatibilization Block copolymer",

The results from SAXS, SEM and TEM indicated the morphology and structure of organic/inorganic hybrid materials, and the size of inorganic particle in hybrid was nanoscale. The results from IR and XPS showed that there were two possible cationic active species in the hybrid-supported catalyst, the polymerization results of styrene proved this possibility.",

The diblock copolymer was synthesized by sequential anionic copolymerization and was melt-blended with sPS and TPU. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the added block copolymer reduced the domain size of the dispersed phase in the blends. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) revealed that the extent of compatibility between sPS and TPU affected the crystallization of the sPS in the blends. Tensile strength and elongation at break increased, while the dynamic modulus and complex viscosity decreased with the amount of P(S-b-4VPy) in the blend. The compatibilizing effect of the diblock copolymer is the result of its location at the interface between the sPS and the TPU phases and penetration of the blocks into the corresponding phases, i.e. the polystyrene block enters the noncrystalline regions of the sPS, and the poly(4-vinylpyridine) block interacts with TPU through intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

        "abstract": "A new class of organic\u2013inorganic hybrid porous clay heterostructures (HPCHs) have been prepared through the surfactant-directed assembly of organosilica in the galleries of montmorillonite. The reaction involved hydrolysis and condensation of phenyltriethoxysilane and tetraethoxysilane in the presence of intragallery surfactant templates (dodecylame and cetyltrimethylammonium ion). The surfactant templates were removed from the pores by solvent-extraction. The products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N 2 adsorption, solid-state 29 Si and 13 C NMR, and FTIR. XRD patterns indicated a regular interstratification of the clay layers for HPCHs. Depending on loading of phenyl groups, HPCHs had BET surface areas of 390\u2013771 m 2 g \u22121 , pore volumes of 0.3\u20130.59 cm 3 g \u22121 , and the framework pore sizes in the supermicropore to small mesopore range (1.2\u20132.6 nm). HPCHs were hydrophobic and acidic. Keywords Clay Hybrid Hydrophobic Mesoporous Acidity",

        "abstract": "Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and an image analyser are used to study morphologies of the fractured surface, etched by hot phenol, of polypropylene/maleated polypropylene/polyamide 12 (PP/PP-MA/PA12)=65/10/25 blend and PP-MA/PA12=75/25 blend. The particle dimension and its distribution of PA12 dispersed phase in these blends are much lower and narrower than that of the PP/PA12 blends. Especially, most of the particles in the PP-MA/PA12 = 75/25 blend are smaller than 0.1 \u03bcm. The effect of the morphology of PP/PA12 blends on their crystallization behaviour is studied using differential scanning calorimetry and SEM. PA12 dispersed phase coarsens during annealing in the PP/PP-MA/PA12 = 65/10/25 blend. The mechanism of coarsening of the PA12 dispersed phase is a coalescence process. The intense mixing between the PP component and the PA12 component through reaction of PP-MA and PA12 leads to a change of dynamic mechanical behaviour of the components. A separation method is used to separate the polyolefin parts (precipitated from hot phenol), from PA12 parts (hot phenol filtrate). Of PP/PP-MA/PA12 = 65/10/25 blend, infra-red measurements and elementary analysis show that the precipitate has a lower PA12 content than the feed, whereas the filtrate has a higher PA12 content. From PP-MA/PA12 = 75/25 blend, PA12 contents in the precipitate and the filtrate are the same as in the feed. This implies that all PA12 has reacted with all PP-MA in the latter case while not in the former case. Using the method of interface exposure, interfacial reaction of PP-MA with PA12 is studied by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (X.p.s.).",

There are two kinds of effects of interface on tensile strength, when the adhesion strength of interface is smaller than critical value, the effect of interface reduces the tensile strength of blends; when the adhesion strength of interface is larger than critical value, the effect of interface increases the tensile strength of blends. The following conditions are very important for synergism of the tensile strength of blends: 91) there must be crosslinking net in each component; (2) the adhesion strength of interface must be larger than critical value.",

        "abstract": "The compatibilization effect of poly(styrene- b -2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) diblock copolymer, P(S- b -EOx), on immiscible blends of poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (PPO) and poly(ethylene- co -acrylic acid) (EAA) is examined in terms of phase structure and thermal, rheological and mechanical properties, and its compatibilizing mechanism is investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The block copolymer, synthesized by a mechanism transformation copolymerization, is used in solution blending of PPO/EAA. Scanning electron micrographs show that the blends exhibit a more regular and finer dispersion on addition of a small amount of P(S- b -EOx). Thermal analysis indicates that the glass transition of PPO and the lower endothermic peak of EAA components become closer on adding P(S- b -EOx), and the added diblock copolymer is mainly located at the interface between the PPO and EAA phases. The interfacial tension estimated by rheological measurement is significantly reduced on addition of a small amount of P(S- b -EOx). The tensile strength and elongation at break increase with the addition of the diblock copolymer for PPO-rich blends, whereas the tensile strength increases but the elongation at break decreases for EAA-rich blends. This effect is interpreted in terms of interfacial activity and the reinforcing effect of the diblock copolymer, and it is concluded that the diblock copolymer plays a role as an effective compatibilizer for PPO/EAA blends. The specific interaction between EAA and polar parts of P(S- b -EOx) is mainly hydrogen bonding.",

At 10 wt% block copolymer content, block copolymer chains exist as spherical micelles and cylindrical micelles in LLDPE matrix. At 50 wt% block copolymer content, block copolymer chains mainly form cylindrical micelles. The core and corona of micelles consist of PMMA and PHB blocks, respectively.

        "abstract": "Blends of polyamide-6 (PA6) with syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS) were prepared using a series of styrene/glycidyl methacrylate (SG) copolymers as compatibilizers. These copolymers are miscible with sPS, and the epoxide units in SG are capable of reacting with PA6 end groups. These copolymers thus have the potential to form SG-g-PA6 graft copolymers at the PA6/sPS interface during melt processing. This study focuses on the effects of functionality and concentration of the compatibilizer on the morphological, mechanical and crystallization behaviors of the blends. In general, SG copolymers are effective in reducing the sPS domain size and improving the interfacial adhesion. About 5 wt% glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) is the optimum content in SG copolymer that produces the best compatibilization. Both the strength and modulus of the blend have been improved on addition of the SG copolymers, accompanying a loss in toughness when higher concentration copolymer is added. Incorporation of SG compatibilizers to PA6/sPS blend has little influence on the crystallization behavior of PA6 component but resulted in a steady reduction in intensity of crystallinity peak of sPS and simultaneous crystallization of sPS with PA6 is observed.",

        "abstract": "A novel approach to the preparation of polyethylene (PE) nanocomposites, with montmorillonite/silica hybrid (MT-Si) supported catalyst, was developed. MT-Si was prepared by depositing silica nanoparticles between galleries of the MT. A common zirconocene catalyst [bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride/methylaluminoxane] was fixed on the MT-Si surface by a simple method. After ethylene polymerization, two classes of nanofillers (clay layers and silica nanoparticles) were dispersed concurrently in the PE matrix and PE/clay-silica nanocomposites were obtained. Exfoliation of the clay layers and dispersion of the silica nanoparticles were examined with transmission electron microscopy. Physical properties of the nanocomposites were characterized by tensile tests, dynamic mechanical analysis, and DSC. The nanocomposites with a low nanofiller loading (<10 wt %) exhibited good mechanical properties. The nanocomposite powder produced with the supported catalyst had a granular morphology and a high bulk density, typical of a heterogeneous catalyst system. \u00a9 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Transparent poly(ethyl acrylate) (PEA)/bentonite nanocomposites containing intercalated-exfoliated combinatory structures of clay were synthesized by in situ emulsion polymerizations in aqueous dispersions containing bentonite. The samples for characterization were prepared through direct-forming films of the resulting emulsions without coagulation and separation. An examination with X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy showed that intercalated and exfoliated structures of clay coexisted in the PEA/bentonite nanocomposites. The measurements of mechanical properties showed that PEA properties were greatly improved, with the tensile strength and modulus increasing from 0.65 and 0.24 to 11.16 and 88.41 MPa, respectively. Dynamic mechanical analysis revealed a very marked improvement of the storage modulus above the glass-transition temperature. In addition, because of the uniform dispersion of silicate layers in the PEA matrix, the barrier properties of the materials were dramatically improved. The permeability coefficient of water vapor decreased from 30.8 \u00d7 10 -6 to 8.3 \u00d7 10 -6 g cm/cm 2 s cmHg. \u00a9 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci. Part A: Polym. Chem.",

The diblock copolymer was synthesized by sequential anionic copolymerization and was melt-blended with sPS and TPU. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the added block copolymer reduced the domain size of the dispersed phase in the blends. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) revealed that the extent of compatibility between sPS and TPU affected the crystallization of the sPS in the blends. Tensile strength and elongation at break increased, while the dynamic modulus and complex viscosity decreased with the amount of P(S- b -4VPy) in the blend. The compatibilizing effect of the diblock copolymer is the result of its location at the interface between the sPS and the TPU phases and penetration of the blocks into the corresponding phases, i.e. the polystyrene block enters the noncrystalline regions of the sPS, and the poly(4-vinylpyridine) block interacts with TPU through intermolecular hydrogen bonding.",

In order to have an insight into the mechanism of exfoliation, the degree of dispersion and exfoliation of 30B was characterized by wide angle X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The layers of 30B were exfoliated via a slippage process, which was also observed in polyamide 12 nanocomposites recently. Shear played a dominating role in the process of exfoliation. The effect of morphology on rheological and mechanical properties was investigated, thus improving our understanding of TPU nanocomposites processing and optimization.",

The size of the nanoparticles can be tuned via application of different Pd precursors. The hydrogen storage properties of Pd supported in HCS under room temperature were examined at partial pressures. We observed significant difference between the storage capacities of two samples containing Pd nanoparticles with different diameter distributions. The results showed that the sample with suitable diameters of Pd nanoparticles was more favorable for the H2 storage, even lower mass of Pd was used. The maximum hydrogen storage of 0.36 wt % exhibited the sample with Pd nanoparticles with the diameter of 11 nm (measured at 298 K and 24 bar) and it was enhanced by the factor of two in respect to the pristine HCS. The enhanced storage capacity is due to cumulative hydrogen adsorption by HCS and Pd nanoparticles. We also propose the mechanism of hydrogen storage in our material. \u00a9 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights.",

The materials which have a uniform size distribution, good structural stability and large surface area show superior cycling performance and are suitable for high-power anodes. Core/shell structured SnO 2@MHCS takes advantage of the virtues of SnO 2 and porous carbon in lithium-ion battery. This structure provides a rapid lithium transport pathway and boasts a highly reversible capacity. When the SnO 2/C ratio is 78.6/21.4 (w/w), the surface area of SnO 2@MHCS is 183 m 2 g -1 and specific capacity value is 450 mAh g -1 at 1/5 C after 50 cycles.

        "abstract": "A new type of multifunctional ammonium modifier with carbonyl group and vinyl group was synthesized to prepare multifunctional montmorillonites (F-MMTs), which were used as multifunctional catalyst supports for in situ ethylene polymerization. High loading of metallocene catalyst in the galleries of F-MMT had been achieved due to the presence of carbonyl group in the multifunctional modifier. XRD profiles and TEM images showed that polyethylene/montmorillonite (PE/F-MMT) nanocomposites with exfoliated structure could be synthesized using the intercalated catalyst described above, even when the content of MMT was very high (more than 15.1 wt%). The as-produced PE/F-MMTs nanocomposites were composed of flower-like particles with a diameter of about 5 \u03bcm. A thermal stable monoclinic phase was observed in PE/F-MMT nanocomposites. Comparatively, the resultant PE/F-MMT nanocomposites showed low gas permeability. Interfacial interaction between PE matrix and F-MMT was enhanced due to the chemical linking between the two components via copolymerization of ethylene with vinyl group of F-MMT. Thus the resultant PE/F-MMT nanocomposites showed good structural stability. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

High melt strength polypropylene (HMSPP) was synthesized by in situ heat induction melt reaction, in which pure propylene/1-butene copolymer powders without any additives were used as a basic resin and trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) as a crosslinking agent. The structure and properties of the resultant HMSPP were characterized by means of various measurements. The content of TMPTA strongly influenced the melt strength and melt flow rate (MFR) of HMSPP. With increasing the content of TMPTA, the melt strength of HMSPP increased, and the MFR reduced. In addition, owing to the existence of crosslinking structure, thermal stability and tensile strength of HMSPP were improved compared with pristine propylene/1-butene copolymer. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Chlorinated carbon nanotubes (CNT-Cl) and its combination with Ni 2O3 were used to prepare polypropylene (PP) composites via melt mixing. The cone calorimetry and TGA results showed that both the flame retardancy and the thermal stability of the composites containing CNT-Cl were better than the samples containing unchlorinated CNTs. NMR measurements confirmed that CNT-Cl could react with the double bond of degradation products at high temperature. Furthermore, the role of CNT-Cl in the combination between CNT-Cl and Ni2O3 was investigated by carbonization experiments and rheology measurements. The results demonstrated that CNT-Cl could significantly promote the carbonization of degradation products of PP catalyzed by nickel catalyst during combustion. In contrast, the combination between unchlorinated CNTs and Ni2O3 could not promote the carbonization of degradation products of PP compared to the case containing Ni2O3 alone. This was attributed to Cl radicals releasing from CNT-Cl, which worked as a catalyst to accelerate dehydrogenation- aromatization of degradation products of PP and promoted the carbonization of degradation products catalyzed by nickel catalyst. \u00a9 2010 American Chemical Society.",

The investigation was focused on the effects of annealing temperature on the structural changes and protective layer formation. The decomposition of OMMT and degradation of PP/OMMT nanocomposites were characterized by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The structural evolution and composition change in the surface region of PP/OMMT nanocomposites during heating were monitored by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ATR-FTIR and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The results showed that the formation of the carbonaceous silicate barrier in the surface region of PP/OMMT nanocomposites resulted from the following three processes: (1) The formation of strong acid sites on the MMT sheets, which could promote the degradation of PP and the carbonization of its degradation products; (2) The gases and gas bubbles formed by decomposition of the surfactant and degradation of PP, which pushed the molten sample to the surface; (3) The degradation of PP and the carbonization of the degradation products, which led to accumulation of MMT sheets tightly linked by the char in the surface region. \u00a9 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.",

        "abstract": "Three polypropylene-g-polystyrene (PP-g-PS) graft copolymers with the same branch density but different branch lengths were evaluated as compatibilizing agents for PP/PS blends. The morphological and rheological results revealed that the addition of PP-g-PS graft copolymers significantly reduced the PS particle size and enhanced the interfacial adhesion between PP and PS phases. Furthermore, it is verified that the branch length of PP-g-PS graft copolymer had opposite effects on its compatibilizing effect: on one hand, increasing the branch length could improve the compatibilizing effect of graft copolymer on PP/PS blends, demonstrated by the reduction of PS particle size and the enhancement of interfacial adhesion; on the other hand, increasing the branch length would increase the melt viscosity of PP-g-PS graft copolymer, which prevented it from migrating effectively to the interface of blend components. Additionally, the crystallization and melting behaviors of PP and PP/PS blends were compared. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Among which the scandium complexes, in spite of ligand type, exhibited medium to high catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization (10(5) g mol(Sc)(-1) h(-1) atm(-1)), but all were almost inert to norbornene polymerization. Remarkably, higher activity was found for the copolymerization of ethylene and norbornene when using Sc based catalytic systems, which reached up to 5 x 10(6) g mol(Sc)(-1) h(-1) atm(-1) with 2a. The composition of the isolated copolymer was varying from random to alternating according to the feed ratio of the two monomers (r(E) = 4.1, r(NB) = 0.013). The molecular structure of complex 1d was characterized by X-ray analysis. The influences of structural factors of complexes and polymerization conditions on both the catalytic activity and the norbornene content in the copolymer were discussed.",

        "abstract": "Effects of organically modified montmorillonites (OMMTs) with different type and amount of modifiers on flame retardancy of polystyrene (PS) have been studied. The results from morphology analysis, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and cone calorimeter have showed different mechanisms for the flame retardancy of PS/OMMTs composites, depending on surface property of OMMTs. One is the catalysis of acid sites formed on the surface of octadecylammonium modified MMT (c-MMT) via Hoffman decomposition on the carbonization of degradation products, which promotes the formation of clay-enriched char barrier. The other is related to chemical effect of inherent properties of MMT sheets on reactive intermediates during combustion, which work in PS/Na-MMT and PS/sodium dodecylsulfonate modified MMT (a-MMT) composites. Furthermore, the effect of the aggregate states of a-MMT on the flame retardancy of PS/a-MMT composites was studied. In the case of a-MMTs from spraying drying, a good protective layer with foam-like aggregate state of MMT sheet was formed in the residue, which results in low peak value of heat release rate of PS/a-MMT composites. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Wide angle X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis were used to investigate the microstructure of TPU nanocomposites. Three factors (including introducing sequence, the kind and the content of MAPP) showed important effects on the dispersion degree of OMMT-C18 in TPU matrix. The results confirmed that the pre-intercalation of MAPP was necessary for the exfoliation of OMMT-C18; however, the role of MAPP in TPU nanocomposites was different from that in polypropylene nanocomposites. In addition, the investigation on the morphology evolution of TPU nanocomposites showed that shear force played a key role in the formation of exfoliated TPU nanocomposites. TPU nanocomposites with exfoliated structure showed better properties compared with TPU and its nanocomposites with intercalated structure. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Complexes 1-6 are THF-solvated mono(alkyl)s stabilized by O,N,N,O-tetradentate ligands. Complexes 1-3 and 5 adopt twisted octahedral geometry, whereas 4 contains a tetragonal bipyramidal core. Bearing a monoanionic moiety L6 (L7), complex 7 (8) is a THF-free bis(alkyl). In complex 7, the O,N,N-tridentate ligand combined with two alkyl species forms a tetrahedral coordination core. Complexes 1, 2, and 3 displayed modest activity but high stereoselectivity for the polymerization of rac-lactide to give heterotactic polylactide with the racemic enchainment of monomer units Pr ranging from 0.95 to 0.99, the highest value reached to date. Complex 5 exhibited almost the same level of activity albeit with relatively low selectivity. In contrast, dramatic decreases in activity and stereoselectivity were found for complex 4. The Salan yttrium alkyl complex 6 was active but nonselective. Bis(alkyl) complexes 7 and 8 were more active than 1-3 toward polymerization of rac-LA, however, to afford atactic polylactides due to di-active sites. The ligand framework, especially the \"bridge\" between the two nitrogen atoms, played a significant role in governing the selectivity of the corresponding complexes via changing the geometry of the metal center. The NMR spectrum of the active species of the rac-lactide oligomer attached to complex 1 demonstrated a coordination-insertion mechanism. In addition it also confirmed that the geometry of the metal center of complex 1 in the solid state was retained in solution (THF) during the polymerization, which contributed significantly to the high selectivity of the complex. \u00a9 2007 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Deformation behavior of polyethylene/modified montmorillonites with polymerizable surfactant (PE/P-MMT) nanocomposite with strong interfacial interaction was studied by means of morphology observation and X-ray scattering measurements. The orientation of PE chains was accompanied by the orientation of well-dispersed MMT platelets due to the presence of strong interfacial interaction, and both of the orientations were parallel to the deformation direction. The high degree of orientation of MMT platelets and PE chains resulted from the synergistic movement of PE matrix and MMTs, which originated from the presence of a network-like structure. Meanwhile, the existence of MMT platelets with good mobility during deformation and strong interfacial interaction with PE matrix could further improve the break energy of material by restraining the initiation and growth of cavities during deformation. In contrast, PE/MMT nanocomposite with no strong interfacial interaction and poor dispersed state of MMT sheets showed the weaker orientation of both PE chains and MMT platelets, and a strong cavitation during deformation.",

        "abstract": "A one-pot approach to prepare Cu-Ni/C heterogeneous composites by carbonization of polypropylene (PP) using combined catalysts of Ni 2O 3 and CuCl was proposed. TEM, SEM, TGA and Raman measurements were performed to investigate the effects of Cl/Ni molar ratios on the yield and morphology of the resultant carbon materials. The yield of carbon materials in Cu-Ni/C first increased and then decreased as the Cl/Ni molar ratio increased, and the maximum yield was achieved at Cl/Ni molar ratio of 0.125. Longer and thinner carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were obtained at low Cl/Ni ratios while shorter carbon fibers were formed at high Cl/Ni ratios. The effect of Cl/Ni molar ratio on the active sites for the growth of carbon materials and degraded products of PP were investigated by XRD, GC and GC-MS. Interestingly, the resultant Cu-Ni/C showed the catalysis to \" Click\" reaction. As a result, the initial catalytic substances (Ni 2O 3 and CuCl) could be effectively used twice as catalysts in the carbonization of PP and in the later application of the resultant Cu-Ni/C composites. More importantly, this approach is a new potential method to transform waste polymer materials into valuable metal/carbon heterogeneous composites. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "The crystalline structure and phase morphology of linear, branched polyethylenes and their blends during crystallization and subsequent melting were investigated, using a combination of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). A linear polyethylene (PE1) with weight-average molecular weight (M w) of 114 000g/mol, and two branched polyethylene copolymers, containing 4.8 mol% (PE4) and 15.3 mol% (PE10) hexane, with molecular weights of 93000g/mol and 46000g/mol were used as pure samples. Two blends, PE1-4 and PE1-10, each with a weight ratio of 50/50, were prepared by solution blending. Our results indicate that in PE4 a phase separation within the branched component itself occurred, forming a broad distribution of lamellar thicknesses during the crystallization process. PE10 on the other hand did hardly crystallize because of the high degree of branching. Co-crystallization of both components took place in blend PE1-4 and liquid-liquid phase separation occurred in the melt of PE1-10. Morphological parameters were determined by using Bragg's law and the correlation function, respectively. The detected semicrystalline morphology can be well described by the lamellar insertion mode where thin lamellae develop between thicker primary lamellae. During subsequent heating, lamellae melted in the reversed sequence of their formation. The evolution of the structural parameters as a function of temperature revealed that surface melting began at first, and then the complete melting of stacks occurred until the final melting temperature was reached.

        "abstract": "The effectiveness of dithiocarbamates in mediating melt radical reaction during preparing long chain branched polypropylene (LCB-PP) was studied. 1H NMR, FTIR, GPC-TALLS and rheological measurements were used to characterize the structure of the resultant LCB-PP. The results showed that adding dithiocarbamates could help forming more long chain branches on PP, and furthermore the chemical structure of the leaving group (R) of dithiocarbamates played a key role in adjusting melt reaction of PP in the presence of peroxide and multifunctional monomer. When the R formed a stable radical (compared to PP macroradicals) after leaving from the dithiocarbamate, such as allyl or benzyl radicals, the presence of dithiocarbamates could reduce the chain scission of PP due to the formation of dormant state species. In this case, the polymerization degree of grafted monomer was also reduced comparing with conventional radical polymerization under the same conditions. Thus more multifunctional monomer could react with PP macroradical to form more branching points and then more uniformly distributed LCB structure on the PP backbone. The reaction mechanism was investigated through model reactions. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Morphology observation showed that phase size of the dispersed sPS particles was significantly reduced on addition of all the four copolymers and the interfacial adhesion between the two phases was dramatically enhanced. Tensile strength of the blends increased at lower copolymer content but decreased with increasing copolymer content. The elongation at break of the blends improved and sharply increased with increments of the copolymers. Drop in modulus of the blend was observed on addition of the rubbery copolymers. The mechanical performance of the modified blends is strikingly dependent not only on the interfacial activity of the copolymers but also on the mechanical properties of the copolymers, particularly at the high copolymer concentration. Addition of compatibilizers to HDPE/sPS blend resulted in a significant reduction in crystallinity of both HDPE and sPS. Measurements of Vicat softening temperature of the HDPE/sPS blends show that heat resistance of HDPE is greatly improved upon incorporation of 20 wt% sPS.",

Different adsorption levels of the modifier in the OMMTs provide different environments for diffusion of polymer chains and different attractions between MMT layers. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and gas permeability were used to characterize morphologies of the nanocomposites. Both OMMTs can be exfoliated in the PA12 matrix with higher molecular weight, but only OMMT with lower adsorption level can be exfoliated in the PA12 matrix with lower molecular weight. It was attributed to the differences in the levels of shear stress and molecular diffusion in the nanocomposites. The exfoliation of OMMT platelets results from a combination of molecular diffusion and shear. After intercalation of PA12 into interlayer of OMMT in the initial period of mixing, further dispersion of OMMTs in PA12 matrices is controlled by a slippage process of MMT layers during fabricating PA12 nanocomposites with exfoliated structure.",

Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) was used to synthesize graft copolymers with thermo-responsive transformation from graft copolymers to linear polymers with bimodal or wide MWD. The NMR measurements indicated that the Diels-Alder reaction and retro-Diels-Alder reaction occurred, depending on the change of the temperature, meaning that the side chains could be cleaved and reformed according to the variation of the temperature. GPC measurements demonstrated that the molecular weights of the polymers were thermoresponsive. Furthermore, three graft copolymers with various branching chains (PBF-g-PBA, PBF-g-P(BMA-co-MA) and PBF-g-PBMA) were compared to study the influence of compatibility between the backbone and the branching chain on the efficiency of Diels-Alder reaction after the cleavage of the DA linkage. The results showed that the ability of the side chains to come back to the main chain was strongly affected by the compatibility between the backbone and the side chains and the flexibility of the polymer chains.",

The structure and rheological properties of the modified PPs were characterized. The results showed that CDD could efficiently control two side reactions, i.e. degradation of PP backbone and homopolymerization of multifunctional monomer (trimethylol propane triacrylate (TMPTA)) in the presence of peroxide. Meanwhile the addition of CDD also increased the efficiency of forming LCB structure. The reaction between CDD and active free radicals (carbon centered and alkoxy species) led to forming in situ dithiocarbamate radicals, which cannot attack PP backbone and are weaker initiator for TMPTA. The resultant dithiocarbamate radicals could react with the PP macroradicals and the acrylic radicals reversibly, which prolong the life time of PP macroradical and increase the reaction probability between macroradicals. The obtained LCB-PP showed high melt strength. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Catalyzing the carbonization of a polymer itself to form a protective carbonaceous layer has attracted tremendous interest in the flame retardancy of polymers, but the efficiency of this strategy was largely limited to polymers containing heteroatoms within their backbone. In this study, a novel type of combined catalyst, consisting of nanosized carbon black (CB) and Ni 2O 3, was found to efficiently catalyze the carbonization of poly(l-lactide) (PLA) for the first time. The combined catalyst was more efficient than CB or Ni 2O 3 alone to enhance the char yield of PLA and improve its char layer structure, which greatly improved the flame retardancy of PLA. The catalytic pyrolysis for PLA composites and model carbonization experiments for their degradation products were carried out to investigate the carbonization process of PLA during combustion. The results indicated that the carbonization mechanism was attributed to the combined effect of the combined catalysts: CB catalyzed the degradation of PLA to selectively produce more aldehydes and ketones with lower carbon numbers, then these carbonyl compounds were dehydrogenated (and/or dehydrated) and transferred into carbon products catalyzed by the combination of CB and Ni catalysts. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

This catalyst system has a high thermal stability and show fairly good activity. The obtained polystyrene (PS) was isotactic-rich atactic polymer by 13C NMR analysis, and its molecular weight distribution was rather narrow (M w/Mn \u2248 1.6, by GPC analysis). ESR revealed that Ni(II)TPP \u03c0 cation radicals were formed in the polymerization and could remain in the resulting PS stably.

        "abstract": "Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/polyethylene (PE) nanocomposites were prepared via in situ polymerization with MWCNTs supported Bis- (cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride (Cp2ZrCl2) catalyst. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) results implied that Cp2ZrCl2 catalyst was immobilized in the surface of the MWCNTs supports via a bridge of methylaluminoxane (MAO). The efficient dispersion of MWCNTs in PE matrix and the strong compressive forces associated with PE on the MWCNTs were demonstrated by means of transmission electron microscope (TEM), FESEM and Raman spectra. With introducing 0.2 wt% MWCNTs, both the tensile strength and elongation of MWCNTs/PE nanocomposite were improved by factors of 1.6 (from 29 to 45 MPa) and 1.5 (from 909% to 1360%) comparing with the pure PE, respectively. Morphology observation of fractured surface revealed that the PE firmly adhered to the nanotubes, which was responsible for the significant improvement of the mechanical properties of nanocomposites. Thermal stabilities of the nanocomposites were significantly improved. In addition, the MWCNTs/PE nanocomposites showed very high ultraviolet (UV) shielding property, which could increase photooxidative stability of the PE. POLYM.

Thus the flame retardancy of nanocomposites was improved, especially for the heat release rate and total smoke production. Furthermore, the combination of CNT-PR with melamine dramatically promoted the LOI value and the level of UL-94 rating. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

A lack of knowledge about natural drug gels limits there current application. Here, we report on rhein, a herbal natural product, which is directly self-assembled into hydrogels through noncovalent interactions. This hydrogel shows excellent stability, sustained release and reversible stimuli-responses. The hydrogel consists of a three-dimensional nanofiber network that prevents premature degradation. Moreover, it easily enters cells and binds to toll-like receptor 4. This enables rhein hydrogels to significantly dephosphorylate I\u03baB\u03b1, inhibiting the nuclear translocation of p65 at the NF\u03baB signalling pathway in lipopolysaccharide-induced BV2 microglia. Subsequently, rhein hydrogels alleviate neuroinflammation with a long-lasting effect and little cytotoxicity compared to the equivalent free-drug in vitro. This study highlights a direct self-assembly hydrogel from natural small molecule as a promising neuroinflammatory therapy.",

        "abstract": "Core-shell-structured mesoporous silica spheres were prepared by using n-octadecyltrimethoxysilane (C18TMS) as the surfactant. Hollow mesoporous carbon spheres with controllable diameters were fabricated from core-shell-structured mesoporous silica sphere templates by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). By controlling the thickness of the silica shell, hollow carbon spheres (HCSs) with different diameters can be obtained. The use of ethylene as the carbon precursor in the CVD process produces the materials in a single step without the need to remove the surfactant. The mechanism of formation and the role played by the surfactant, C18TMS, are investigated. The materials have large potential in double-layer supercapacitors, and their electrochemical properties were determined. HCSs with thicker mesoporous shells possess a larger surface area, which in turn increases their electrochemical capacitance. The samples prepared at a lower temperature also exhibit increased capacitance as a result of the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) area and larger pore size.",

        "abstract": "Effects of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and Ni2O 3 on the flame retardancy of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) have been studied. A combination of MWCNTs and Ni2O3 showed a synergistic effect in improving the flame retardancy of LLDPE compared with LLDPE composites containing MWCNTs or Ni2O3 alone. As a result, the peak value of heat release rate measured by cone calorimeter was obviously decreased in the LLDPE/MWCNTs/Ni2O3 composites. According to the results from rheological tests, carbonization experiments, and structural characterization of residual char, the improved flame retardancy was partially attributed to the formation of a networklike structure due to the good dispersion of MWCNTs in LLDPE matrix, and partially to the carbonization of degradation products of LLDPE catalyzed by Ni catalyst originated from Ni 2O3. More importantly, both viscoelastic characteristics and catalytic carbonization behavior of LLDPE/MWCNTs/Ni2O3 composites acted in concert to result in a synergistic effect in improving the flame retardancy. Although both MWCNTs and Ni2O3 were not organically modified, LLDPE composites incorporating both the fillers showed higher mechanical properties compared with those of pure LLDPE. \u00a9 2009 American Chemical Society.",

Effects of the modifiers on degradation and fire retardancy of PA12/OMMT nanocomposites were investigated. Acid sites formed in cationic surfactant modified MMT via Hoffman decomposition could accelerate degradation of PA12 at high temperature. However, catalytic effect of the acid sites on carbonization of the degradation products promoted char barrier formation, which reduced heat release rate (HRR). Higher content of cationic surfactant in OMMT is beneficial to fire retardancy of PA12 nanocomposites and the dispersion states of OMMT have assistant effects. In contrast, Na + -montmorillonite (Na-MMT) and anionic surfactant modified MMT (a-MMT) could not form acid sites on the MMT layers; in this case, fire retardancy of PA12/Na-MMT appears to have no improvement and PA12/a-MMT appears to have limited improvement.",

        "abstract": "A one-pot approach was used to convert polyethylene (PE) with different chain structures into carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) under the combined catalysis of CuBr and NiO at 700. \ufffd\ufffdC, including linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE) and high density polyethylene (HDPE). The effect of chain structure of PE on the yield, morphology, microstructure, phase structure and thermal stability of CNMs, including cup-stacked carbon nanotubes (CS-CNTs) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs), were investigated by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope (TEM), high-resolution TEM, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and thermal gravimetric analysis. In addition, the degradation products from different chain structures of PE under the catalysis of CuBr were analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. It was demonstrated that the branched structure played an important effect in the degradation products of PE. The dehydrogenation and aromatization of LLDPE were remarkably promoted by Br radicals from the decomposition of CuBr to form a large amount of light hydrocarbons and a relatively small amount of aromatics, favoring the formation of long and straight CS-CNTs. However, the degradation of LDPE was not obviously influenced by Br radicals due to its high extent of branched structure, while the random cleavage of HDPE was accelerated with the formation of a lot of olefins with long chains, resulting in the formation of short and winding CNFs. This work will contribute to the conversion of mixed waste polyolefin into high value-added CNMs. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Controlled chain-scission of polybutadiene (PB), polyisoprene, and poly(styrene-co-butadiene), induced by bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium hydrochloride (Cp(2)ZrHCl), was revealed at room temperature. The chain-scission reaction of linear PB was studied by means of GPC, NMR spectroscopy, and MALDI-TOF-MS. It was confirmed that the molecular weights of degraded products were quasi-quantitatively controlled by Cp(2)ZrHCl loading, irrespective of the starting PB, whereas the microstructure of PB chains was crucial to the scission reaction. The hydrozirconation of model molecules indicated that the existence of an internal double bond in compounds with multiple double bonds was essential for chain cleavage. The chain-cleavage mechanism was proposed to involve hydrozirconation of internal double bonds in PB chains and \u03b2-alkyl elimination. Furthermore, metallocene-catalyzed chain-scission by a chain-transfer reaction was developed. It is believed that the reported chain scission offers a promising pathway for end-group functionalization by chain cleavage and presents a new application of Schwartz's reagent.",

Morphology observation shows that both the medium MW and the lower MW SEBS are more effective than the higher MW SEBS in compatibilizing the blends. Tensile tests revels both the medium and low MW compatibilizer lead to a significant improvement in tensile strength, while the higher MW compatibilizer is efficient in increasing the elongation at break of the blends. The localization of compatibilizers in the blends is observed by mean of SEM and the correlation between the distribution of the compatibilizers and mechanical properties of the blends is evaluated. The mechanical properties of the iPP/sPS blends depend on not only the interfacial activity of the compatibilizers but also the distribution of the compatibilizer in the blend. Addition of the compatibilizers to the blend causes a remarkable decrease in the magnitude of the crystallization peak of sPS at its usual T c. Vicat softening points demonstrate that the heat resistance of iPP/sPS blend is much higher than that of the pure iPP.",

The flammability of these composites was evaluated by cone calorimetry. COM enhanced the flame retardancy of ABS/COM composite due to the catalysis by acidic sites originating from COM. Interestingly, AOM presented a similar flame retardancy to ABS/AOM composite, although AOM did not form the acidic sites. The morphology observation showed that the dispersion degree of AOM in ABS resin was\u00a0lower than that of COM, which was also confirmed by the rheological properties of ABS composites. The investigations on the surface of the residue after cone calorimeter tests showed that the better flame retardancy of ABS/AOM composite was mainly due to the special structure of AOM.",

        "abstract": "The influence of the topological structure of polylactide (PLA) chains on the microstructure of PLA-organically modified clay (OMC) nanocomposites was studied. Here, an OMC with a hydroxyl group-containing modifier (I.34TCN) was used as the nanofiller. According to the results from the XRD and TEM measurements, the change in the dispersed states of the OMC with star-shaped PLA (PLA3-x) was totally different from that with linear PLA (PLA1-1) during annealing at high temperature. A transition from the intercalated to the exfoliated structure appeared in the simple PLA3-x/OMC mixture during the annealing process, but the intercalated structure was retained in the PLA1-1/OMC system. The enhanced exfoliation of the OMC in the PLA3-x matrix was attributed to the spatial limitation of the star-shaped PLA3-x, which made the intercalated interlayer swell. As a result, the concentration of PLA3-x chains within the layers of the OMC was lower than that of the outside bulk, and so, more PLA3-x chains diffused into the interlayers of the clay until the clay sheets separated (exfoliation state). Furthermore, the exfoliation extent of the OMC in the star-shaped PLA3-x/OMC composites strongly influenced the glass transition temperature (Tg) of star-shaped PLA3-x.

        "abstract": "The effect of combination between a trace of halogenated compounds (such as ferric chloride and ammonium bromide) and Ni2O3 particles on the carbonization of polypropylene (PP) was investigated during combustion. The results showed a synergistic catalysis of combined halogenated compounds with Ni2O3 in promoting the formation of the residual char during combustion. The investigation on the promotion mechanism showed that halide radical releasing from halogen-containing additives worked as a catalyst to accelerate dehydrogenation-aromatization of degradation products of PP, which promote the degradation products to form the residual char catalyzed by nickel catalyst. The results of GC and GC/MS confirmed that halogenated compounds could accelerate dehydrogenization and aromatization of degradation products of PP. The morphological observation showed that longer fiber-like structure was formed in the residual char of PP/halogenated compound/Ni2O3 composites comparing with PP/Ni2O3 composite. As a result, the presence of a trace amount of halogenated compounds could significantly improve the flame retardancy of PP/Ni2O3 composites, which is proved by cone calorimeter tests. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",

The yield of MWCNTs was affected by the composition of PP mixtures with OMMT and nickel compounds and the combustion temperature. The proton acidic sites from the degraded OMMT layers due to the Hoffman reaction of the modifiers at high temperature played an important role in the catalytic degradation of PP to supply carbon sources that are easy to be catalyzed by nickel catalyst for the growth of MWCNTs. The XRD measurements demonstrated that the nickel compounds were in situ reduced into the Ni(0) state with the aid of hydrogen gas and/or hydrocarbons in the degradation products of PP, and the Ni(0) was really the active site for the growth of MWCNTs. The combination of nickel compounds with OMMT was a key factor to efficiently synthesize MWCNTs via catalytic combustion of PP. 1 Introduction An enormous research interest has been focused on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) since the discovery of carbon nanostructures [1,2] . This is due to the prediction of unique properties and potential applications of CNTs. Many applications, such as vehicles for large hydrogen storage [3] , chemical sensors [4] and nanoscale electronic devices [5] , have been investigated. With increase of application fields, some simple and inexpensive fabrication routes for synthesis of CNTs must be established. In various methods [6\u201311] , the catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons under inert conditions is a promising way for the production of CNTs on large scale [12,13] . The presence of transition metal particles is essential for the formation of CNTs by pyrolysis process and the diameter of the CNTs is determined by the size of the metal particles [14] . Normally the catalysts are prepared via reduction of metal oxide located on support by hydrogen gas. Recently some reports demonstrated that metal oxides were used directly as catalysts for synthesis of CNTs [15\u201317] . The real active sites for formation of CNTs were metallic state. In situ reduction occurred through hydrogen from decomposition of hydrocarbons and/or oxidation\u2013reduction reaction between hydrocarbons and metal oxides. Therefore a previous reduction seems to be unnecessary for synthesis of CNTs catalyzed by transition metal oxides. Carbon sources for producing CNTs by catalytic reaction can be numerous, such as CH 4 , C 2 H 2 , C 6 H 6 and even polymeric materials. Polymeric materials could be good carbon sources for producing CNTs here, because of their flexibility to process. Synthesis of CNTs using polyethylene (PE) in the presence of catalysts has been reported [18\u201320] . The carbon feedstock from PE can be its original polymeric from [18] , intermediates hydrocarbon gases [19] and solid pyrolysis of products [20] . Other polymeric materials such as polypropylene [21] , polyvinyl alcohol [19] , polytetraflouoroethyene [22] and polycarbosilane [23] have also been used to produce CNTs by the catalytic pyrolysis. Recently, a process of obtaining carbon nanotubes by the pyrolysis of PP in a bubbling fluidized bed was reported [24] . There are two obvious benefits from polymers as carbon precursors for synthesis of CNTs, one of them is to transform polymers into highly valuable CNTs, and the other is to provide a novel potential way to efficiently reuse waste plastics. In view of energy, reutilization of used polyolefins as carbon reservoir for CNTs seems to be a better choice than direct consumption of C 2 H 4 , C 3 H 6 and other compounds from petroleum source. This is also beneficial to the effective recycle of the used polyolefins, as properties of recycled materials are usually inferior to those of the parent materials. In recent years, a simpler and easier scale-up method for synthesizing CNTs has been demonstrated, i.e. flame synthesis [25\u201328] . This method can be energy-efficient where a portion of the employed small organic molecules is burnt to produce the elevated temperature while the remainder serves as carbon precursor for the growth of CNTs. One alternative is to introduce polymers as carbon precursors in a modified flame synthesis [29] , in which a commercial supported nickel catalyst (S\u2013Ni(0)) was used as pyrolyzed catalyst to synthesize multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in the presence of an organic-modified montmorillonite (OMMT). However, the yield of MWCNTs from PP/S\u2013Ni(0) mixture was low in the absence of OMMT. The essence for this phenomenon needed to be further investigated. Generally, the temperature for pyrolysis of carbon containing feedstock to synthesize CNTs is over 600 \u00b0C that is higher than that of thermal degradation of polyolefins. In the case of polyolefins as carbon sources for synthesizing CNTs, two-step reactions, i.e. degradation reaction of polyolefins and carbonization of the degradation products, should occur. Especially, the thermal degradation of polyolefins and the catalytic degradation of polyolefins will result in different degradation products [30\u201334] , which may play a key role for formation of CNTs, as matching of catalyst and carbon sources is an important factor for the yield of CNTs [35] . Based on our previous work [29] , in this study, we report in detail the influence of experimental conditions on the yield of MWCNTs from mixture of polypropylene (PP)/maleated polypropylene (PPMA)/OMMT/nickel catalyst via combustion. Here the nickel catalysts include Ni 2 O 3 , NiO, Ni(OH) 2 and NiCO 3 \u00b7 2Ni(OH) 2 . The effects of catalysts, composition of PP mixtures and combustion temperature were studied, and a possible mechanism for highly yielded formation of MWCNTs was proposed based on these observations. 2 Experimental Polypropylene (PP, melt flow index of 0.8 g/min) was mixed with inorganic solids and/or nickel compounds (including commercial Ni 2 O 3 , NiO, NiO (40 nm), Ni(OH) 2 and NiCO 3 \u00b7 2Ni(OH) 2 \u00b7 4H 2 O (dry for 6 h at 120 \u00b0C before using)) in a Brabender mixer at 100 rpm and 190 \u00b0C for 10 min. Inorganic solids include Na + -montmorillonite (Na-MMT, which is composed of units made of two silica tetrahedral sheets with alumina octahedral sheet in between, with CEC of 119 meq/100 g from Kunimine Co.), organic-modified montmorillonite (OMMT, Closite 15A from Southern Clay, organic modifier: dimethyl-dihydrogenated tallow quarternary ammonium; modifier concentration: 125 meq/100 g clay), NH 4 + Cl - -modified montmorillonite (NH 4 -MMT, prepared via ion-exchange in this laboratory), commercial H-form ZSM-5 (H-ZSM-5, a kind of commercial zeolite, 50 \u03bcm), NaOH modified H-ZSM-5 (Na-ZSM-5, prepared in this laboratory) and NH 4 + Cl - modified H-ZSM-5 (NH 4 -ZSM-5, prepared via ion-exchange in this laboratory). An amount of maleated polypropylene (PPMA, acid value 26 mg KOH/g) was added into the above mixture as a compatibilizer. CNTs were synthesized by catalytic combustion of PP/Ni 2 O 3 /OMMT in a 30 ml crucible above an oxygen-gas flame. The equipment with diffusion flame was illustrated in Fig. 1 . To obtain a steady temperature in crucible (defined as combustion temperature), gas and oxygen could be controlled and measured by flow meters (LZB-6, China), and the distance from the top of gas lamp to the bottom of crucible was fixed (150 mm). The combustion temperature was detected by a thermometer with the Pt\u2013Rh thermocouple. The thermocouple junction was placed below the crucible which was filled by asbestos. Different combustion temperatures were obtained by adjusting the flow numbers of gas and oxygen. The samples balanced on analytical balance were rapidly put into the crucible at a determined temperature and the crucible was lid quickly. The crucible was taken from the flame when the yellow flame disappeared (about 5\u20137 min) and was cooled to room temperature. The lid was taken away, and then the charred residue was balanced. Subsequently, the charred residue was purified with hydrofluoric acid (HF) and nitric acid (HNO 3 ) to eliminate MMT or ZSM-5, amorphous carbon and most of nickel catalyst. The yield of the purified char ( y ) was calculated by amount of the purified char ( m 1 ) divided by amount of the organic compositions ( m p ) in the used sample, i.e., y = ( m 1 / m p ) \u00d7 100%. All of the samples were weighed by analytical balance. The purity and the phase structure of the charred products were obtained by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D/MAX-IIB powder X-ray diffractometer with CuK\u03b1 radiation. The morphologies of the as-prepared products were examined with the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, XL303SEM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010, operated at 200 kV voltage) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, JEM-3010, operated at 300 kV voltage) were used to identify and characterize the morphology and microstructure of the purified products. Raman spectra (T6400, excitation beam wavelength: 514.5 nm) was used to characterize the vibrational properties of the obtained MWCNTs. Gas chromatography (GC, SHIMADZU GC-14C) and Gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS, AGILENT 5975 MSD) were used to measure composition of the degradation products. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Relationship of MWCNTs yield with composition of PP mixture and combustion temperature The observation of FE-SEM for microstructure of the charred residue from combustion of PP/PPMA/OMMT/Ni 2 O 3 (80/5/10/5, by weight) mixture at 830 \u00b0C showed that the raw char possessed fiber-like structure containing clay layers ( Fig. 2 ). After purification, a large quantity of tube-like nanostructures in the purified charred residue could be seen. There are a wide range of the diameters, and the main diameters are about 50\u201360 nm. There are also a wide range of the lengths of CNTs, and the longest CNT is over 5 \u03bcm. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) were used to observe the microstructure of the purified char. Fig. 3 a clearly shows that the purified charred residue is comprised of MWCNTs with central hollow inside. Although there are many unusual structures (such as dislocation and slope) and amorphous (outside walls) structures, the graphitic character can be observed in the walls of MWCNTs from the image of HRTEM ( Fig. 3 b). Raman spectroscopy was used to further characterize graphitization of the MWCNTs from the sample ( Fig. 4 ). The peak at 1589 cm \u22121 (G-band) corresponds to an E 2g mode of hexagonal graphite and is related to the vibration of sp 2 -bonded carbon atoms in a graphite layer. Normally, the D-band at about 1348 cm \u22121 is associated with vibration of carbon atoms with dangling bonds in the plane terminations of disordered graphite or glassy carbons [36] . In this case, owing to existence of the structural defect and the amorphous structure in the walls of MWCNTs, the strong D-band at 1348 cm \u22121 in the Raman spectrum should also reflects these structures. In the PP/PPMA/OMMT/Ni 2 O 3 mixture, the yield of MWCNTs from PP increased with the content of Ni 2 O 3 and changed a little after the content of Ni 2 O 3 reached 3.5% by weight ( Fig. 5 ). When the content of Ni 2 O 3 is 3.5 wt%, the yield of MWCNTs is 50 wt% based on amount of the organic components in the sample. Other nickel compounds, including NiO, Ni(OH) 2 and NiCO 3 \u00b7 2Ni(OH) 2 , were also used as the catalysts for synthesizing MWCNTs during combustion at 830 \u00b0C. Table 1 shows the yields of MWCNTs in the different cases. The kinds of nickel compounds led to various yields of MWCNTs under the same condition. The catalytic efficiency of NiO for synthesizing MWCNTs is low, even in the case of nanosized NiO. The yields of MWCNTs in the cases of Ni(OH) 2 and NiCO 3 \u00b7 2Ni(OH) 2 are in the range of 49\u201355 wt% that is similar to the case of Ni 2 O 3 . Fig. 6 presents FE-SEM images of the microstructure of the raw MWCNTs from PP mixture containing these nickel compounds. According to the measurements of Raman spectrum of the purified MWCNTs from PP/PPMA/OMMT/Ni(OH) 2 with 5 wt% of Ni(OH) 2 , the microstructures of the obtained MWCNTs are similar to the case of Ni 2 O 3 ( Fig. 7 ). Effects of combustion temperature on the yield of MWCNTs depend on OMMT content in the PP mixture ( Table 2 ). When the content of OMMT is 10 wt%, the yield of MWCNTs decreased with decrease of combustion temperature from 830 \u00b0C to 630 \u00b0C. However, in the cases of PP mixture containing 5 wt% of OMMT, the yield of MWCNTs almost kept constant when NiO was used as nickel catalyst in spite of change of combustion temperature from 830 \u00b0C to 630 \u00b0C. Furthermore, it was found that the content of OMMT in the PP mixtures is another important factor influencing the yield of MWCNTs. The yield of MWCNTs is very low in the samples without OMMT. It can be seen that the carbonization of PP catalyzed by Ni 2 O 3 or other nickel compounds mentioned-above alone could not give high yield of MWCNTs ( Table 1 ). In contrast, in the presence of both OMMT and nickel compounds, the yield of MWCNTs increased obviously. With the increase of OMMT content, the yield of MWCNTs increased ( Tables 1 and 2 ). These results showed that the carbonization of PP became easy in the presence of both OMMT and nickel compounds. However, the combination between Na-MMT and nickel compound (such as Ni 2 O 3 ) in the same PP matrix afforded only 15.6 wt% of the yield of MWCNTs under the same conditions. 3.2 Possible catalysis of OMMT during formation of MWCNTs by combustion of PP mixture There are two possible factors that lead to different yields of MWCNTs in the PP matrix containing OMMT and Na-MMT. The first one is organic modifier on the OMMT that may affect chemical reaction of PP transformed into MWCNTs, and the second one is dispersion degree that may provide different physical environments for carbonization of PP. In order to clarify which one really works in the formation of MWCNTs, Na + -montmorillonite (Na-MMT) was modified by NH 4 + Cl - via ion-exchange (NH 4 -MMT) and combined with Ni 2 O 3 in the PP matrix. Strikingly, this combination of PP/PPMA/NH 4 -MMT/Ni 2 O 3 = 80/5/10/5 (by weight) gave 58.0 wt% of the yield of MWCNTs under the same conditions. As the dispersion degree of NH 4 -MMT is similar to that of Na-MMT and not as good as that of OMMT, we speculated that it was the ammonium groups within OMMT and NH 4 -MMT playing a crucial role in the formation of MWCNTs from PP. It is known that the thermal decomposition of (alkyl)ammonium in the OMMT or NH 4 -MMT will leave hydrogen proton to form proton acidic sites on the degraded OMMT layers [37] , which can form a strong catalyst for degradation of PP via cationic mechanism. Gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) was used to compare difference of the degradation products from PP/PPMA mixture (thermal degradation) and PP/PPMA/OMMT mixture (catalytic degradation). Gaseous fractions and liquid fractions of the degradation products from the above systems were collected at 700 \u00b0C. There were hydrogen gas, CH 4 , C 2 H 2 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 and C 3 H 6 in the gaseous fractions of both PP/PPMA mixture and PP/PPMA/OMMT mixture. The quantity of gaseous fraction from the latter case is higher than that from the former case. More importantly, the composition distribution in the liquid fraction of the degradation products from the PP/PPMA mixture was very wide. There are the degradation products in the elution time of 40 min in GC\u2013MS profile ( Fig. 8 a). However, there is almost no any of the degradation products in the case of catalytic degradation when the elution time is over 8 min ( Fig. 8 b). The above results demonstrated that the liquid products obtained from the degradation of PP/PPMA/OMMT mixture were much lighter than those of the corresponding PP/PPMA mixture, which is similar to the results of the reference [38] . This suggests that proton acid site on the degraded OMMTs is a key factor to the highly yielded formation of MWCNTs. The effect of proton acidic sites on the degraded OMMT on the yield of MWCNTs was further confirmed via comparing combination of commercial H-ZSM-5, NH 4 + Cl - modified H-ZSM-5 (NH 4 -ZSM-5) and NaOH modified H-ZSM-5 (Na-ZSM-5) with Ni 2 O 3 respectively as model catalytic systems for degradation of PP and then formation of MWCNTs. For the mixture of PP/PPMA/NH 4 -ZSM-5/Ni 2 O 3 = 80/5/10/5 (by weight), NH 3 was released to create proton acidic sites on ZSM-5 during heating, which obviously resulted in increase of the yield of MWCNTs during combustion compared with that of PP/PPMA/Na-ZSM-5/Ni 2 O 3 with the same composition (53 wt% for NH 4 -ZSM-5 vs. 10.9 wt% for Na-ZSM-5). Similarly, the yield of MWCNTs from the mixture of PP/PPMA/H-ZSM-5/Ni 2 O 3 = 80/5/10/5 (by weight) was 45.0 wt% under the same conditions. It should be noted that the above ZSM-5s are poor in barrier effect for the degraded products of PP. Thus, the highly yielded formation of the MWCNTs from PP should be attributed to tandem catalysis of proton acidic sites on the MMT layers for catalytic degradation of PP and nickel catalysts for carbonization of the degradation products. 3.3 Real active catalytic site for the growth of MWCNTs It is necessary to clear whether nickel compound is a real active site for understanding the above mechanism of MWCNTs growth. To identify the role of nickel compounds during the growth of MWCNTs, XRD was used to monitor states of nickel catalysts before and after the growth of MWCNTs ( Fig. 9 ). In XRD profiles of the PP/PPMA/OMMT/Ni 2 O 3 = 80/5/10/5 (by weight) mixture ( Fig. 9 , \u201ca\u201d), there are the diffraction peaks of PP, OMMT and Ni 2 O 3 . After the PP mixture was burned at 830 \u00b0C, the diffraction peaks of PP and OMMT disappeared completely in the charred residue, and those of Ni 2 O 3 became very weak ( Fig. 9 , \u201cb\u201d). Meanwhile three new diffraction peaks appeared, one ascribed to the charred materials with graphitic structure and the other to the metallic state of nickel (Ni(0)). This showed that most of Ni 2 O 3 was in situ reduced into Ni(0) during combustion. Similar phenomena were observed in the charred residue from the samples with the other nickel compounds by means of XRD measurements ( Fig. 9 , \u201cc\u201d\u2013\u201ce\u201d). There are two possibilities to reduce Ni 2 O 3 and other nickel compounds into Ni(0), one from hydrogen gas and the other from the degraded hydrocarbon products of PP. The degradation of PP can provide an amount of hydrogen gas and various hydrocarbon products according to measurement of GC and GC\u2013MS for the gaseous fraction and liquid fraction of the degradation products. In order to confirm that the reduction of nickel compounds occurs before formation of MWCNTs, the following experiment was carried out (Ni 2 O 3 as an example): after only a little of propylene passed through Ni 2 O 3 at 830 \u00b0C or Ni 2 O 3 mixture with a little of PP was heated for 2 min at 830 \u00b0C in the pyrolyzer under the argon atmosphere, a little of water was immediately produced, which means occurrence of Ni 2 O 3 reduction; and the diffraction peaks of Ni 2 O 3 in the XRD profiles almost disappeared and those of Ni(0) appeared. The above results demonstrated that the Ni(0) was the real active catalytic site for the growth of MWCNTs, which is the same as the references showed [15,16] . 3.4 Catalytic combustion process and possible reaction mechanism In general, the combustion of pure polymers includes two chemical reactions, i.e. degradation of polymers and combustion of degradation products. The former is a solid-phase reaction, and the latter is gas-phase reaction. When the temperature is high enough, the exterior polymer will stand oxidative degradation due to existence of oxygen and the inside polymer will thermally degrade via radical mechanism due to absence of oxygen. However, thermal degradation of the inside polymers may be changed, for example, catalytic degradation of polymers may occur in the presence of acid catalyst (such as solid acids). In order to further understand formation process of MWCNTs in the catalytic combustion, the temperature change at the core and the surface location of a typical spherical sample of PP mixture (PP/PPMA/OMMT/Ni 2 O 3 = 80/5/10/5) with diameter of 2 cm in the 730 \u00b0C crucible were monitored ( Fig. 10 ). There was a temperature gradient in the positions of the core and the surface of the sample during catalytic combustion. Because of endothermic character during degradation of PP, the surface temperature of PP mixture was lower than the temperature of the crucible. Morphologies of the same sample undergoing different combustion times at 730 \u00b0C were observed to investigate the actual process producing MWCNTs ( Fig. 11 ). A charred surface had already been formed for combustion of 1 min, and the sample would swell with the increase of combustion time as the char layer thickened. The detail of the loose outside char layer of the sample combusted for 2.5 min was showed in the image A1 in Fig. 11 . It is sure that a mixture consisting of a large amount of MWCNTs and MMT layers derived from degradation of OMMT was formed in this area, but the layer adjoining the stiff sample surface (PP mixture) (A3 in Fig. 11 ) almost consisted of MMT layers and Ni catalyst particles (A2 in Fig. 11 ). If the combustion time lasted for 5 min, an ashen core consisting of a large number of the degraded OMMT layers and Ni catalyst particles (B2 in Fig. 11 ) was covered by a thick mixing layer of MWCNTs and MMT layers (B1 in Fig. 11 ). The above results implied that heat was gradually diffused from the surface to the core in solid-phase catalytic combustion, while the degradation products of PP volatilized from the inside to the outside of the sample leaving behind the MMT layers and nickel catalyst when the temperature was higher than degradation temperature of PP (such as 350 \u00b0C). Generally, the temperature ( T 1 ) for the degradation of PP is lower than that ( T 2 ) for formation of MWCNTs catalyzed by nickel. When the temperature is in the range between T 1 and T 2 , the degradation of the located PP occurs firstly and the degradation products will diffuse into the outside of the sample, where the temperature is high enough to make a part of the degradation products catalyzed to form MWCNTs. Other of the degradation products will possibly continue to diffuse into flame area. Fig. 12 presents a possible reaction mechanism during synthesizing MWCNTs via solid-phase catalytic combustion. There are five (in the cases of Ni 2 O 3 and NiO) or six (in the cases of Ni(OH) 2 and NiCO 3 \u00b7 2Ni(OH) 2 ) possible reactions during synthesizing MWCNTs from PP. When the mixture is heated in crucible, proton acidic sites on the degraded OMMT layers (LS \u2212 H + ) via thermal decomposition of the modifier are formed at first (Reaction R1). The proton acidic sites will attack molecular chains of PP to form cationic active sites (Reaction R2), which results in catalytic degradation of PP (Reaction R3). The degradation products will diffuse toward the sample outside and the nickel compounds and the degraded OMMT will be left. Then a part of the degradation products of PP will in situ reduce nickel compounds into Ni(0) (Reaction R4). Because the heat is supplied continuously, the inside polymer (A3 in Fig. 11 ) will degrade subsequently. When the degradation products pass through the area containing Ni catalyst and the degraded OMMT, the most of them will be catalyzed to form MWCNTs (A1 in Fig. 11 ) and hydrogen by nickel (R5) via a possible dissociation\u2013diffusion\u2013precipitation process [8] , where elemental carbon may be formed on the surface of Ni(0) particle followed by diffusion and precipitation in the form of cylindrical graphite. However, more investigation is needed to clarify the formation mechanism of MWCNTs during catalytic combustion of PP mixture. The process for degradation of PP and formation of MWCNTs could be extended from the outside to the inside. As a result, the inside polymer will decrease, while the layer of MWCNTs containing the degraded OMMT layers will thicken, until all of PP is pyrolyzed completely (that is, there is no flame around the cover). The degraded OMMT and nickel catalyst are left in core (B2 in Fig. 11 ) as there are no carbon sources to form MWCNTs. In the cases of Ni(OH) 2 and NiCO 3 \u00b7 2Ni(OH) 2 , the decomposition reaction of Ni(OH) 2 and NiCO 3 \u00b7 2Ni(OH) 2 into NiO will takes place before R4 and R5 because they have low decomposition temperatures. In the above all cases, the formation of proton acidic sites on the degraded OMMT layers is a key stage. The other key stage is in situ reduction of nickel compounds into Ni(0). Tandem catalysis takes place during synthesis of MWCNTs from PP. One of them is that the proton acidic sites make PP degraded via cationic mechanism, which result in more light compounds in gas fractions and liquid fractions of the degradation products compared to those of thermal degradation of PP; the other of them is that the catalytic degradation products of PP were in situ catalyzed by Ni(0) to form the MWCNTs. A higher content of OMMT or a higher temperature will lead to more degradation products that are easy to be catalyzed to form MWCNTs. 4 Conclusion PP/OMMT/nickel compound mixtures were combusted to synthesize MWCNTs. Ni 2 O 3 , NiO, Ni(OH) 2 and NiCO 3 \u00b7 2Ni(OH) 2 were found to catalyze high-yield formation of MWCNTs from PP during combustion in the presence of OMMT. The combustion temperature and the contents of the nickel catalysts and OMMT had effects on the yield of MWCNTs. In this method, the heat gradually diffused from the surface to the core of the samples, meanwhile the degradation products of PP diffused in a reverse direction of heat diffusion and a part of them were catalyzed to form MWCNTs and hydrogen due to the presence of the degraded OMMT and Ni catalyst. This process for degradation of PP and formation of MWCNTs could extend from the outside to the inside with heat diffusion. During the synthesis process, proton acidic sites on the degraded OMMT layers due to the Hoffman reaction of alkyl ammonium (as modifiers) changed the mechanism of degradation reaction of PP from thermal degradation to catalytic degradation, which led to more degradation products easily catalyzed by nickel catalysts and promoted the yield of MWCNTs. The mechanism of catalyzing the degradation products of PP for synthesis of MWCNTs by nickel compounds is that the nickel compounds are firstly in situ reduced into Ni(0) by hydrogen gas and/or the degradation products, then the Ni(0) catalyzes the degradation products to form MWCNTs. Combination of nickel compounds with OMMT, including Ni 2 O 3 /OMMT, NiO/OMMT, Ni(OH) 2 /OMMT and NiCO 3 \u00b7 2Ni(OH) 2 /OMMT, plays tandem catalysis, which is a key factor to efficiently synthesize MWCNTs from PP.

        "abstract": "Reactions of neutral amino phosphine compounds HL 1\u20133 with rare earth metal tris(alkyl)s, Ln(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 3 (THF) 2 , afforded a new family of organolanthanide complexes, the molecular structures of which are strongly dependent on the ligand framework. Alkane elimination reactions between 2-(CH 3 NH)-C 6 H 4 P(Ph) 2 (HL 1 ) and Lu(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 3 (THF) 2 at room temperature for 3 h generated mono(alkyl) complex (L 1 ) 2 Lu(CH 2 SiMe 3 )(THF) ( 1 ). Similarly, treatment of 2-(C 6 H 5 CH 2 NH)-C 6 H 4 P(Ph) 2 (HL 2 ) with Lu(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 3 (THF) 2 afforded (L 2 ) 2 Lu(CH 2 SiMe 3 )(THF) ( 2 ), selectively, which gradually deproportionated to a homoleptic complex (L 2 ) 3 Lu ( 3 ) at room temperature within a week. Strikingly, under the same condition, 2-(2,6-Me 2 C 6 H 3 NH)-C 6 H 4 P(Ph) 2 (HL 3 ) swiftly reacted with Ln(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 3 (THF) 2 at room temperature for 3 h to yield the corresponding lanthanide bis(alkyl) complexes L 3 Ln(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 2 (THF) n ( 4a : Ln = Y, n = 2; 4b : Ln = Sc, n = 1; 4c : Ln = Lu, n = 1; 4d : Ln = Yb, n = 1; 4e : Ln = Tm, n = 1) in high yields. All complexes have been well defined and the molecular structures of complexes 1 , 2 , 3 and 4b \u2013 e were confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The scandium bis(alkyl) complex activated by AlEt 3 and [Ph 3 C][B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ], was able to catalyze the polymerization of ethylene to afford linear polyethylene. Keywords Lanthanide Alkyl complex Ethylene Polymerization Phosphine 1 Introduction Rare earth metal alkyl complexes have gathered upsurge in research interest in the past decade, because they are highly active single component catalysts or crucial precursors of the cationic counterparts under the activation of MAO or borate toward olefin polymerizations [1] and highly regio- or stereoselective polymerizations of conjugated monomers [2] and polar monomers [3] . The ancillary ligands being attempted to stabilize rare earth metal alkyl species, up to date, have been dominated by cyclopentadienyl environment and their derivatives [4] . Heteroatom compounds have attracted more and more attention recently due to their strong metal\u2013ligand bonds and exceptional and tunable steric and electronic features required for compensating coordinative unsaturation of metal centers and catalytic activity toward polymerization. The majority of the proceeding studies involves chelating ligands such as bidentate amidinates [5] , guanidinates [6] , \u03b2-diketiminates [7] , salicylaldiminates [8] , etc. Whereas, formation of solvent or salt adduct, dimerization or ligand redistribution hinder the isolation of rare earth metal alkyl complexes especially bis(alkyl) complexes supported by such heteroatom compounds. Until recently, some N,N-bidentate ligands with exclusively \u201chard\u201d donors, have been successfully introduced by Hessen\u2019s and Piers\u2019 groups, respectively, to stabilize bis(alkyl) complexes based on \u201chard\u201d Lewis acidic rare earth metal centers [9] . The auxiliaries containing sterically demanding and \u201csoft\u201d phosphine electron donors, preferred to stabilize more acidic metal center, have been applied in transition metal chemistry. Fryzuk and co-workers have shown that zirconium complexes supported by multidentate amido phosphine ligands that contain \u2013CH 2 SiMe 2 \u2013 back-bone are capable of nitrogen activation [10] . The o -phenylene-derivatives of amido-phosphine ligands reported by Liang [11] have been proved to be more robust in palladium complexes that are highly active to Heck reaction and Suzuki coupling, which was also introduced to support alkali metal complexes by Izod [12] . However, organolanthanide complexes bearing \u201csoft\u201d electronic donor of phosphine have remained less explored, as rare earth metal ions favor to coordinate to hard donors. Recently, rare earth metal halide or amido complexes supported by flexible bis(phosphineimino)methanids have been investigated by Roesky group [13] . Izod reported a rare earth metal iodide complex supported by donor-functionalized phosphide ligand, whereas, the sequential alkylation of metal iodide arouses deprotonation [14] . Up to date successfully isolated lanthanide dialkyl complexes are stabilized by P,N-multidentate ligands [15] . Our group also demonstrated that P,N-bidentate phosphino aldiminates are good candidates to stabilize bis(alkyl) species with six-membered-metallocycle coordination, and the isolated complexes are efficient initiators for the ring-opening polymerization of lactide [16] . Here we wish to report the synthesis of a series of lanthanide mono- or bis(alkyl) complexes bearing N -arylated or N -alkylated amino-phosphine auxiliaries, which combined with metal ion to generate rigid five-membered-metallocycle coordination. The polymerization of ethylene initiated by the scandium bis(alkyl) species in the presences of aluminum tris(alkyl)s and organoborate was also presented. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Syntheses and characterization of complexes 2.1.1 Synthesis and characterization of complexes 1 \u2013 3 The reaction of Lu(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 3 (THF) 2 and an equivalent of neutral N -alkylated amino phosphine, (2-diphenylphosphinophenyl)- N -(methyl)aniline (HL 1 ) was carried out in toluene at room temperature and kept stirring for 3 h. Removal of volatiles gave pale yellow residue, which was dissolved by a mixture of toluene and hexane. Pale yellow solid was isolated from the above mixture after cooled at \u221230 \u00b0C for 24 h. However, it was not the expected bis(alkyl) product but a mono(alkyl) complex, [2-(CH 3 N)-C 6 H 4 P(Ph) 2 ] 2 LuCH 2 SiMe 3 (THF) ( 1 ). The 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectra were indicative for the formation of complex 1 according to the loss of the signal for amino proton of the ligand around \u03b4 4.98 and the appearance of resonances of methylene protons of LuCH 2 Si(CH 3 ) 3 that shifted downfield compared to that in Lu(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 3 (THF) 2 ( Scheme 1 ). Switching to the bulky ligand HL 2 , the major product isolated from the reaction was also mono(alkyl), [2-(C 6 H 5 CH 2 N)-C 6 H 4 P(Ph) 2 ] 2 LuCH 2 SiMe 3 (THF) ( 2 ). X-ray diffraction analysis defined that complex 2 was a monomer, adopting twisted tetragonal bipyramidal geometry with the alkyl carbon and phosphorous atoms axial and the THF oxygen and two nitrogen and a phosphorous atoms equatorial ( Table 1 , Fig. 1 ). The ligand coordinated to the lutetium ion in a bidentate mode. Complex 2 was unstable in solution at room temperature and slowly transferred to a homoleptic complex [2-(C 6 H 5 CH 2 N)-C 6 H 4 P(Ph) 2 ] 3 Lu ( 3 ) within a week due to ligand redistribution. In complex 3 , all three ligands bonded to the metal ion with the chelated P and N atoms in bidentate modes and located around the central metal uniformly to generate trigonal bipyramidal geometry with the metal atom being the apex. No solvated THF was observed in the molecule ( Fig. 2 ). The bond lengths of Lu\u2013P (av. 2.953(4) \u00c5 for 2 , av. 2.922(3) \u00c5 for 3 ), Lu\u2013N (av. 2.230(14) \u00c5 for 2 , av. 2.236(8) \u00c5 for 3 ) and Lu\u2013C (2.326(18) \u00c5) were comparable to those literature data [15,16] , which did not need to discuss further ( Tables 2 and 3 ). 2.1.2 Synthesis and characterization of complexes 4a \u2013 e We noted that the N -alkylated amino phosphines HL 1 and HL 2 could not support the highly unsaturated rare earth metal bis(alkyl) species because of their flexibility and deficit in spacial sterics. Thus, the rigid N -arylated compound 2-(2,6-Me 2 C 6 H 3 NH)-C 6 H 4 P(Ph) 2 (HL 3 ) [11h] was chosen to react with 1 equiv of yttrium tris(alkyl)s, Y(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 3 (THF) 2 , anticipated to generate the corresponding bis(alkyl) complex. The reaction performed smoothly at room temperature in toluene, leading to the isolation of the expected L 3 Y(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 2 (THF) 2 ( 4a ). It was evident from the 1 H NMR spectrum that 4a was a monomer of bis(alkyl)s stabilized by mono-anionic L 3 fragment combined with two THF moieties. The resonances at \u03b4 \u22120.21 were assignable to the methylene protons of the 2 equiv metal alkyl species YCH 2 SiMe 3 , whilst those at \u03b4 1.37 and \u03b4 3.72 were arising from the coordinated two THF molecules. Whereas, the repeated attempt to isolate single crystals of 4a was failed. Monitoring the reaction by using NMR technique found that 4a was unstable at room temperature. The signal of the methylene protons disappeared completely within 6 h, suggesting that 4a transferred to unknown products. Fortunately, employing Sc(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 3 (THF) 2 , the similar reaction with HL 3 afforded the anticipated phosphide scandium bis(alkyl)s, L 3 Sc(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 2 (THF) ( 4b ), quantitatively. The yellow crystals of 4b grew from a mixture of toluene/hexane at \u221230 \u00b0C in 24 h. In addition, treatments of the corresponding lutetium, ytterbium and thulium tris(alkyl)s with HL 3 , respectively, afforded the analogous complexes L 3 Ln(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 2 (THF) ( 4c : Ln = Lu; 4d : Ln = Yb; 4e : Ln = Tm) ( Scheme 2 ). The 1 H NMR spectra of 4b and 4c had similar pattern to that of 4a . The methylene protons of LuCH 2 SiMe 3 species displaying a signal at \u03b4 \u22120.30 downfield shifted compared to \u03b4 \u22120.60 in Lu(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 3 (THF) 2 . The resonance for methylene protons of ScCH 2 SiMe 3 unit showed at much lower field \u03b4 0.31, which overlapped with silylmethyl (SiMe 3 ) protons. It was noteworthy that 4b or 4c was bonded by one THF molecule different from 4a with two THF coordination. Both 4b and 4c were stable without ligand redistribution in solution, which was probably attributed to the smaller ionic radii of Sc and Lu ions compared to that of Y ion. All complexes 4a \u2013 c were C s symmetric in solution as the metal alkyl protons were equivalent. Complexes 4d and 4e did not give informative 1 H NMR spectra due to their paramagnetic nature. X\u2013ray diffraction analysis solved the overall molecular structures of complexes 4b \u2013 e to be isomeric monomers. Each metal ion was chelated by N,P atoms of the phosphide ligand in bidentate mode, and a solvated THF molecule and two alkyl species locating in cis -positions, to generate distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry around the metal center. The phosphorus donor and the THF molecule were axial (av. P\u2013Lu\u2013O = 168.77\u00b0, Table 4 ) and the two alkyl carbon atoms and nitrogen atom of the ligand occupied the equatorial positions ( Fig. 3 , complex 4b ) [17] . The central metal ion sit out of the CCN plane with a distance of 0.207 \u00c5 for 4b , 0.248 \u00c5 for 4c , 0.251 \u00c5 for 4d and 0.261 \u00c5 for 4e , respectively, which were in contrast to complexes 2 and 3 where the Lu atom deviated from the CCN plane with much longer distance of 0.8387 \u00c5 for 2 and 0.9367 \u00c5 for 3 , which might be attributed to the crowded environment of metal centers. Interestingly, the rigid five-membered ring PC 2 NLn was planar and almost perpendicular to the CCN plane with a dihedral angle 90.8\u00b0 for 4b , 91.6\u00b0 for 4c , 90.6\u00b0 for 4d and 91.6\u00b0 for 4e , respectively. Whereas in a closely related phosphine aldiminato complex [ o -(PPh 2 )C 6 H 4 CH 2 NC 6 H 3 Me 2 -2,6]Lu(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 2 (THF) [16] , the six-membered metallacycle NC(9)C 2 PLn is much twisted due to the flexible feature of the ligand. The binding angle of amido phosphine ligand (P\u2013Ln\u2013N) was close to each other in complexes 4c \u2013 e averaging 68.81\u00b0, but a larger angle was found in 4b (72.12(7)\u00b0). This angle was comparable to those in complexes containing such rigid five-membered metallacycle, such as 67.46(3)\u00b0 in complex 2 , 67.4(2)\u00b0 in 3 and 65.83(7)\u00b0 in (PNP Ph )Lu(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 2 (THF) [15b] , but smaller than 77.8(1)\u00b0 in Sc(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 2 [N(SiMe 2 CH 2 PPri 2 ) 2 ] bearing flexible five-membered metallacycle [15a] and 78.53(7)\u00b0 in L 2-Me Lu(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 2 (THF) containing six-membered metallacycle [16] . The C\u2013Ln\u2013C bond angles averaging 111.8\u00b0 in complexes 4b \u2013 e were slightly larger than 103.50(12)\u00b0 [15b] found in the above mentioned complexes, which were comparable to those of C\u2013Sc\u2013C (113.5(2)\u00b0) [15a] and C\u2013Y\u2013C (119.5(2)\u00b0) in THF solvated amidinato yttrium bis(alkyl) complex [18] , indicating the similar steric environment of the ligands. However, these bond angles were larger than those of C\u2013Ln\u2013C in the rare earth metal bis(alkyl) complexes supported by triazacyclononane (99.41(8)\u00b0) [19] , triamino-amide (101.96(6)\u00b0) [20] and \u03b2-diketiminate (108.90(13)\u00b0) [21] . 2.2 Catalysis on ethylene polymerization Designing rare earth metal complexes possessing catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization has been an goal of organolanthanide chemists. Ansa -lanthanocene alkyls, linked and non-linked half-sandwich lanthanide hydrocarbyls [1,2g,h,k,9c,d] , and the recent amidinato (non-metallocene) rare earth metal bis(alkyl)s [18,22] have been explored to exhibit high reactivity toward olefin polymerization. Thus, these amido phosphine ligated rare earth metal bis(alkyl) complexes were investigated whether to have such performance. Complexes 4c \u2013 e were inert even at the presences of both activators [Ph 3 C][B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ] and AlEt 3 ( Table 5 , entries 1\u20133). Whereas strikingly, complex 4b based on more Lewis acidic scandium ion was active at 20 \u00b0C and 1 bar of ethylene. The influences of the reaction conditions on the polymerization were investigated. At 40 \u00b0C, the catalytic activity of 4b reached to 49 000 g/(mol Ln bar h), which was more than double of that (22 000 g/(mol Ln bar h)) at 20 \u00b0C. Meanwhile the molecular weight of the resultant polyethylene (PE) was also increased and the molecular weight distribution did not change obviously. Whereas, increasing the temperature to 50 \u00b0C, the molecular weight of PE lowered significantly and the molecular weight distribution became wider, although the activity dropped slightly. If the polymerization was performed at much higher temperature (60 \u00b0C), both catalytic activity and molecular weight of PE decreased greatly, which could be attributed to the decomposition of the complex and the rapid chain transfer reaction at high temperature ( Table 5 , entries 5\u20138). It was reasonable that prolonged reaction time would arouse high yield of PE. Almost no polymer could be isolated if the reaction time was shorter than 10 min, however, the catalytic activity decreased if polymerization carried out longer than 30 min ( Table 5 , entries 9\u201311). Varying the ethylene pressure from 1 to 5 bar increased the yield of PE obviously whereas which seemed to have less influence on the activity ( Table 5 , entries 7 and 13). In contrast, AlEt 3 -to-borate ratio affected the performance of 4b . When the value was decreased from 5:1 to 2.5:1, the catalytic activity halved ( Table 5 , entries 6 and 14). To our surprise, an increase of the activation time of complex 4b by AlEt 3 led to obvious drop in activity of 4b and significantly broadened the molecular weight distribution ( Table 5 , entries 7\u201312). This suggested that at long activation time some unknown less active species were formed. It was also noteworthy when the reaction medium contained minimum amount of THF, the catalytic system 4b /AlEt 3 /[Ph 3 C][B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ] lost its activity for ethylene polymerization completely. This might be explained that the strong electron donor THF intended to occupy the blank space of the cationic central metal ion to prohibit the coordination of non-polar ethylene monomer [18] . Based on the polymerization results, the mechanism of polymerization and the roles of the three components could be described as follow. When 4b was treated with [Ph 3 C][B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ], cationic species L 3 Sc + (CH 2 SiMe 3 )(THF) were generated as shown in the 1 H NMR spectrum according to the release of Ph 3 CCH 2 SiMe 3 [2h,k] , which were the initiation species. However, the cationic units showed no activity at the absence of AlEt 3 in contrast to the previous reported systems [2h,k,22d] . This could be attributed to the coordination of THF molecule and too electron negative nature of the ligand, which inhibited the coordination and insertion of non-polar ethylene monomer. Thus, the addition of AlEt 3 activated the cationic units, which could be explained that AlEt 3 extruded the impurities in the system, abstracted the coordinated THF molecule and stabilized the cationic metal center [9c,d,23] . According to Mandelken\u2019s protocol and the reported result [24] , all of the corresponding carbon resonances in high-temperature 13 C NMR spectrum were assigned unambiguously, in which there were no signals for the branches, indicating linear microstructure of the isolated polyethylene. 3 Conclusion A series of amido phosphine supported organolanthanide complexes have been prepared by treatment of rare earth metal tris(alkyl)s with the neutral amido phosphine compounds via alkane elimination. The N -alkylated amido phosphine ligand bonded to the central metal to generate a twisted flexible five-membered metallocycle to stabilize rare earth metal mono(alkyl) species. Whereas, the N -arylated amido phosphine ligand formed a rigid five-membered metallocyclic coordination, which was able to support rare earth metal bis(alkyl) units. Moreover, the resultant bis(alkyl) complex based on more Lewis acidic scandium ion, upon activation with equimolar [Ph 3 C][B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ] in the presence of 5 equiv aluminum triethyls, was active toward ethylene polymerization with modest activity at room temperature under normal pressure to give linear polyethylene. 4 Experimental 4.1 General methods All reactions were carried out under a dry and oxygen-free argon atmosphere by using Schlenk techniques or under a nitrogen atmosphere in an MBRAUN glovebox. All solvents were purified from MBRAUN SPS system. Organometallic samples for NMR spectroscopic measurements were prepared in the glovebox by use of NMR tubes sealed by paraffin film. 1 H, 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV400 or AV600 (FT, 400 MHz for 1 H; 100 MHz for 13 C or FT, 600 MHz for 1 H; 150 MHz for 13 C) spectrometer. NMR assignments were confirmed by the 1 H\u2013 1 H COSY and 1 H\u2013 13 C HMQC experiments when necessary. The NMR spectra of the polyethylene were recorded on a Varian Unity 400 MHz spectrometer with o -dichlorobenzene as the solvent at 120 \u00b0C. IR spectra were recorded on VERTEX 70 FT-IR or IFS66V/S FTIR. The molecular weight and the polydispersitiy of the polymer samples were determined at 150 \u00b0C by a PLGPC 220 type high-temperature chromatograph equipped with three PLgel 10 \u03bcm Mixed-B LS type columns. 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene (TCB) was employed as the solvent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The calibration was made by polystyrene standard EasiCal PS-1 (PL Ltd). Elemental analyses were performed at National Analytical Research Centre of Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry (CIAC). (2-Diphenylphosphino) aniline and (2-diphenylphosphinophenyl)- N -(methyl) aniline (HL 1 ) were prepared according to the literature [25] . N -(2-Diphenylphosphinophenyl)-2,6-dimethylaniline was prepared according to the literature [11h] . 4.2 X-ray crystallographic studies Crystals for X-ray analysis were obtained as described in the preparations. The crystals were manipulated in a glovebox. Data collections were performed at \u221286 \u00b0C on a Bruker SMART APEX diffractometer with a CCDC area detector, using graphite monochromated Mo K radiation ( \u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5). The determination of crystal class and unit cell parameters was carried out by the smart program package. The raw frame data were processed using saint and sadabs to yield the reflection data file. The structures were solved by using shelxtl program. Refinement was performed on F 2 anisotropically for all non-hydrogen atoms by the full-matrix least-squares method. The hydrogen atoms were placed at the calculated positions and were included in the structure calculation without further refinement of the parameters. 4.3 Syntheses of complexes 4.3.1 Syntheses of (2-diphenylphosphinophenyl)- N -(benzyl) aniline (HL 2 ) At \u221278 \u00b0C under stirring, a THF solution (40 mL) of the compound (2-diphenylphosphino)aniline (2.77 g, 10.00 mmol) was added n BuLi dropwise (6.56 mL, 10.00 mmol) and reacted for 1h, then, benzyl chloride (1.21 mL, 10.00 mmol) was syringed into the system. After maintained for 2 h at \u221278 \u00b0C, the reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature gradually and kept stirring overnight. Volatiles were removed off under reduced pressure and degassed water (10 mL) was added. The resultant mixture was extracted with deoxygenated dichloromethane (20 \u00d7 3 mL). The organic phase was separated, dried over degassed MgSO 4 , and filtered. Removal of dichloromethane afforded residue, which was recrystallized from CH 2 Cl 2 /CH 3 CH 2 OH at \u221230 \u00b0C for several days to give white solid of HL 2 (3.32 g, 90%). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO- d 6 , 25 \u00b0C): \u03b4 4.35 (d, J H\u2013H = 6 Hz, 2H, CH 2 ), 5.74 (m, 1H, NH), 6.51\u20136.54 (m, 2H, o -PC 6 H 4 N, p -NC 6 H 4 P), 6.62\u20136.65 (m, 1H, o -NC 6 H 4 P), 7.01\u20137.19 (m, 4H, o , p -CH 2 C 6 H 5 , p -PC 6 H 4 N), 7.21\u20137.28 (m, 6H, m -CH 2 C 6 H 5 , o -P(C 6 H 5 ) 2 ), 7.40\u20137.42 (m, 6H, m , p -P(C 6 H 5 ) 2 ). 13 C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO- d 6 , 25 \u00b0C): \u03b4 46.46 (s, 1C, CH 2 ), 110.53 (s, 1C, p -NC 6 H 4 P), 116.59 (s, 1C, p -NC 6 H 4 P), 118.25 (d, 1C, 1 J C\u2013P = 9 Hz, ipso -PC 6 H 4 N), 126.55 (s, 1C, p -CH 2 C 6 H 5 ), 126.68 (s, 2C, o -CH 2 C 6 H 5 ), 128.19 (s, 2C, m -CH 2 C 6 H 5 ), 128.66 (d, 3 J C\u2013P = 6 Hz, 4C, m -P(C 6 H 5 ) 2 ), 128.85 (s, 2C, p -P(C 6 H 5 ) 2 ), 130.34 (s, 1C, p -PC 6 H 4 N), 133.24 (d, 2 J C\u2013P = 19 Hz, 4C, o -P(C 6 H 5 ) 2 ), 133.65 (s, 1C, o -PC 6 H 4 N), 135.32 (d, 1 J C\u2013P = 9 Hz, 2C,), 139.66 (s, 1C, ipso -CH 2 C 6 H 5 ), 150.42 (d, 1C, ipso -NC 6 H 4 P).

The flask was taken outside of the glove box and set in a water bath, and connected to a well-purged Schlenk ethylene line with a mercury-sealed stopper by use of a three-way cock. Ethylene (1 atm) was introduced into the system and was saturated in the solution by stirring for 2 min. A hexane solution (0.25 M) of AlEt 3 and a toluene solution of [Ph 3 C][B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ] was then added through a syringe under vigorous stirring. The polymerization was quenched by addition of ethanol (100 mL). The polymer product was collected by filtration, washed with ethanol, and then dried in vacuo at 60 \u00b0C to a constant weight.

        "abstract": "The performances of a novel char forming agent containing spiro and caged bicyclic phosphate (SBCPO) and its mixture with ammonium polyphosphate (APP) were investigated. The flame retardancy of the polypropylene (PP)/SBCPO/APP system was evaluated by the limiting oxygen index (LOI), the UL-94 test, and the cone calorimeter test. The maximum LOI value of PP/intumescent flame retardant (IFR) could reach 30.5 and passed the UL-94 V-0 rating. An obvious synergistic effect could be observed between SBCPO and APP by TGA, DSC, and synergistic effectivity studies, which remarkably improved the flame retardant properties of PP. FTIR analysis indicated that APP could accelerate the decomposition of SBCPO due to the interaction between them. The thermal degradation kinetics results of the PP/IFR system by the Kissinger method and the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa method showed that the apparent activation energy (Ea) increased with the increase of content for flame retardants. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "A series of rare-earth metal complexes attached by an amino-functionalized cyclopentadienyl ligand (C(5)Me(4)H-C(6)H(4)-o-NMe(2)) (1) was prepared. The metathesis reaction of the ligand lithium salt [C(5)Me(4)-C(6)H(4)-o-NMe(2)]Li with LnCl(3)(THF)(n) afforded the dichlorido complexes [(C(5)Me(4)-C(6)H(4)-o-NMe(2))(2)Ln(2)Cl(4)][LiCl(THF)(2)] (Ln = Y (2a), Lu (2b)), which are trinuclear connected by mu(3)-Cl and mu(2)-Cl multiple bridges. The straightforward metathesis reaction of Ln(BH(4))(3)(THF)(n) with equimolar [C(5)Me(4)-C(6)H(4)-o-NMe(2)]Li in THF medium yielded the first linked half sandwich ligand stabilized THF-free rare-earth metal bis(borohydrido) complexes (C(5)Me(4)-C(6)H(4)-o-NMe(2))Ln(BH(4))(2) (Ln = Sc (3a), Sm (3b)), respectively. The single component borohydrido complex 3a showed high activity towards the bulk polymerization of methyl methacrylate without specific control, which showed high iso-selectivity (mm = 80%) when the polymerization was performed in benzene medium, and switched to syndio-selectivity (rr = 74% at -20 degrees C) in polar THF medium, whilst the metal chlorido species was inert. The binary catalyst system of 3a/Mg(n)Bu(2) had similar catalytic performances when compared with 3a in THF medium, but provided enriched syndio-control in benzene solution that was in contrast to the iso-control of 3a. Surprisingly, 3a upon activation with (n)BuLi displayed an extremely high activity (1.1 x 10(6) g mol(Sc)(-1) h(-1)) and afforded syndiotactic PMMA (rr = 75%) at low polymerization temperature (-20 degrees C) in THF.",

Results from FTIR, 1 H NMR spectroscopy and TEM observations showed that the functionalization was successful. The modified nanotubes can dissolve in most of the nonpolar organic solvents and no precipitate was observed in the solution of the nanotubes even after 2\u00a0months. The functionalized nanotubes showed photo-electronic properties, which is due to the attachment of the function groups to them as proved by steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy. Both h-CNTs and o-CNTs showed good thermal stability below 300\u00a0\u00b0C and might be used as functional materials.",

The obtained nanocomposites displayed not only dramatically enhanced thermal stability both under nitrogen and in air, but also improved flame retardancy to some extent. Moreover, the higher the loading level of CB, the better was the improved effect. This enhanced mechanism was attributed mainly to trapping of peroxy radicals by CB nanoparticles at elevated temperature to form a gelled-ball crosslinked network, which act as a barrier to both heat and mass transfer. The thermal-oxidation cross-linking reaction was supported by the results of rheological properties, gel measurements and FTIR analysis. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The morphology, microstructure, textural property, phase structure, surface element composition and thermal stability of P-CSCNT were investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope (TEM), high-resolution TEM, N2 sorption, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermal gravimetric analysis. A part of oblique graphitic layers were etched by KOH, and many holes with a diameter of several to a doze of nanometers connecting inner tube with outside were formed, which endowed P-CSCNT with high specific surface area (558.7 m(2)/g), large pore volume (1.993 cm(3)/g) and abundant surface functional groups. Subsequently, P-CSCNT was used for adsorption of methylene blue (MB) from wastewater. Langmuir model closely fitted the adsorption results, and the maximum adsorption capacity of P-CSCNT was as high as 319.1mg/g. This was ascribed to multiple adsorption mechanisms including pore filling, hydrogen bonding, \u03c0-\u03c0 and electrostatic interactions. Pseudo second-order kinetic model was more valid to describe the adsorption behavior. Besides, P-CSCNT showed good recyclablity and reusability. These results demonstrated that P-CSCNT had potential application in wastewater treatment.",

        "abstract": "The catalytic carbonization of polyolefin materials to synthesize carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is a promising strategy for the processing and recycling of plastic wastes, but this approach is generally limited due to the selectivity of catalysts and the difficulties in separating the polyolefin mixture. In this study, the influence of nanosized carbon black (CB) and Ni2O3 as a novel combined catalyst system on catalyzing carbonization of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS) and their blends was investigated. We showed that this combination was efficient to promote the carbonization of these polymers to produce CNTs with high yields and of good quality. Catalytic pyrolysis and model carbonization experiments indicated that the carbonization mechanism was attributed to the synergistic effect of the combined catalysts rendered by CB and Ni2O3: CB catalyzed the degradation of PP, PE, and PS to selectively produce more aromatic compounds, which were subsequently dehydrogenated and reassembled into CNTs via the catalytic action of CB together with Ni particles. Moreover, the performance of the synthesized CNTs as the electrode of supercapacitor was investigated. The supercapacitor displayed a high specific capacitance as compared to supercapacitors using commercial CNTs and CB. This difference was attributed to the relatively larger specific surface areas of our synthetic CNTs and their more oxygen-containing groups.",

        "abstract": "Polypropylene (PP)/fullerene C60 nanocomposites, in which the interfacial reaction between two components was in situ mediated by peroxide, were prepared by a melt mixing method. Structural characterization showed that the interfacial reaction strongly affected the microstructures of PP/C 60 nanocomposites at different scales, such as improving the dispersion state of C60 nanoparticles and forming long chain branched structures in which C60 acts as a branching point. This was ascribed to the ability of C60 (as a reactive nanoparticle) for preferentially trapping carbon-centred macroradicals of PP to in situ form long chain branched structures of PP on the surface of C60 during melt mixing. As a result, the shear-responsive sensitivity of the nanocomposite melts in low shear frequency regions was dramatically enhanced compared to parent PP and the nanocomposites without interfacial reaction. The nanocomposites also showed high melt strength. In addition, the transition from the melt state to solid state (crystallization process) occurred at higher temperature after the interfacial reaction between PP and C60 took place. \u00a9 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

It was found that the relaxation time of PP/C 60 nanocomposites containing peroxide increased due to the reaction between C 60 and PP macroradicals and the formation of long chain branched or crosslinking structure. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results showed that the thermal stability of PP/C 60 nanocomposites was enhanced. The initial decomposition temperatures and activation energy of PP/C 60 nancomposites were strongly influenced by the content of unreacted C 60. Because of the improved interfacial interaction, PP/C 60 nanocomposites containing peroxide showed obvious increase in tensile strength, Young' modulus, flexural strength, flexural modulus, and impact strength, compared to PP/C 60 nanocomposites (without peroxide) containing the same content of C 60.

        "abstract": "An original and simple method for promoting mobility sensitivity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to an external stress field in polypropylene (PP) matrix was developed. In particular, an interfacial melt reaction initiated by free radicals were used as a tool to prepare PP/CNTs nanocomposites. The presence of tetrakis(phenylmethyl)thioperoxydi(carbothioamide) (TBzTD) increased the interfacial reaction between the PP chains and the CNTs. In addition, the grafted TBzTD to PP backbone could form a physical interaction with CNTs via a \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction. In this case, the CNTs were not only well dispersed in the PP matrix during melt-mixing, but also the mobility of dispersed CNTs showed a strong responsive ability to the external stress field in the resultant nanocomposites. As a result, the orientation of CNTs was easily induced in the PP matrix under a weak stress field, such as mold pressing or injection molding. Further research showed that the strong mobility sensitivity of CNTs to an external stress field resulted from a synergistic effect of the physical interaction and chemical linking between CNTs and PP chains. As expected, the toughness of the PP/CNT nanocomposites was dramatically improved when compared with neat PP according to a notched Izod impact test, due to the strong sensitivity of the CNT mobility to an external stress field. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

The results showed that both the branching density and branch chain length of PSVS-g-PE copolymers strongly affected linear rheological behavior of the copolymers, resulting from the formation of different microphase separation structure in the melt state. PSVS-g-PE copolymers with low branching density (2.3\u20133.5 branch chains per 100 repeating units of the backbone) showed a microphase-separated structure at the melt state, and a typical rheological characteristic for network-like structure was observed. Furthermore, the type of microphase-separated structure at the melt state strongly influences the applicability of the time\u2013temperature superposition (TTS) principle. As a result, the TTS failure was observed in the modulus curves for PSVS52.7-3.5-...",

Hydrozirconation of vinyl-containing polystyrene (copolymer of styrene and 4-(vinylphenyl)-1-butene (PSVS)) was found to be an efficient way for immobilization of zirconocene pre-initiator onto polymer backbone by carbon-zirconium (C-Zr) sigma (\u03c3) bond. By activation with MAO, the resultant hydrozirconated PSVS could act as a macroinitiator with multiple-initiating sites (Zr \u03b4+ -C \u03b4- ) for ethylene insertion and propagation in \u201cgraft from\u201d fashion. The hydrozirconation and the following ethylene polymerization were monitored by NMR and GPC, revealing the successful synthesis of PS- g -PE and the following formation of free PE chains due to chain transfer characteristic of metallocene catalyst. Thus we could prepare PE/PS-g-PE alloy through in situ ethylene polymerization by this method. The presence of PS-g-PE in the resultant alloy endowed some special functionalization, for example, acting as compatibilizer in PE/PS blends.",

Because of the extremely short backbone, long side chains and high branching density in these comb-like copolymers, the topological structure of PVSt- g -(PS/PE) was similar to asymmetrical star copolymers. By adjusting the molar ratio of PS and PE side chains, the total PS (PVSt backbone\u00a0+\u00a0side chain PS) volume fraction in the graft copolymers could be adjusted. PVSt- g -(PS/PE) showed a microphase-separated structure at the melt state, depending on the composition of the copolymers. When the volume fraction of PS changed from 42.7% to 76.9%, the microphase-separated structures changed from lamellar phase structure to cylindrical morphology. Furthermore, all the PVSt- g -(PS/PE) samples with the microphase-separated structure showed a typical rheological behavior of cross-linked network-like structure, but the change trend of melt elasticity of the copolymer with increasing temperature depended on the microphase-separated structure.",

Under the same saturation pressure and time (CO 2  pressure: 13.3\u202fMPa; saturation time: 5.5\u202fh), the state of the samples changed with the foaming temperature (50\u2013110\u202f\u00b0C) from solid state to semi-solid state and finally melt state, resulting in different foaming behavior. When the foaming temperature was lower than 50\u202f\u00b0C, all the samples (solid state) did not form foamed or porous structures. At above 60\u202f\u00b0C, the foaming behavior of the samples strongly depended on the foaming temperature. Very surprisingly, at 60\u202f\u00b0C, PS- g -(PS/PE) copolymers with lamellar microphase structure easily formed bimodal nanoporous structure (open-cell) composed of nanofibers, while PS- g -(PS/PE) copolymers with cylindric microphase structure also formed bimodal porous structure with larger size, but the open degree of cell wall was decreased, in which the nanofibers almost disappeared and a lot of nanosized domains appeared. When the foaming temperature was higher than 70\u202f\u00b0C, the cell size increased and the cell density decreased with increasing foaming temperature. Furthermore, the cell structure changed from opened (porous) structure to closed structure when the foaming temperature rose, which was different from the results in the previous reports. The influence of foaming temperature on the foaming behavior of PS- g -(PS/PE) copolymers was discussed.",

        "abstract": "A2A\u2032-type asymmetric stars and A2B-type miktoarm star polymers were prepared by the combination of atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) using the designed initiator. The first step involved the preparation of linear polystyrene with a hydroxyl group (LPSOH) by ATRP using the synthesized initiator 4,4\u2032-di(bromomethyl)benzhydrol. Styrene was polymerized in bulk at 110 \u00b0C in the presence of Cu(I)Br and 2,2\u2032-bipyridyl (Bipy) as a catalytic system. Next, the hydroxyl group in the resulting LPSOH chains was esterified to obtain LPS containing thiocarbonylthio (LPSCS2) chains. The last step consisted of growing the third PS chain or poly-(n-butyl acrylate) chain by RAFT. This methodology enabled us to synthesize A2A\u2032 triarm PS stars with asymmetry in the molar mass of their branches and A2B stars with chemically different PS and PBA arms. It also provided us a facile way to synthesize Y-shaped polymers. The effects of the length of the backbone and branched chain on the thermal properties and the rheology of the synthesized asymmetric polystyrene were studied. This method provided a way to obtain well-defined polymers with fixed backbone but different branch length. On using this method grams of sample can be obtained for melt behavior study.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Comb-like block copolymers PVSt- g -(PS- b -PE) (PVSt: poly(4-(vinylpheneyl)-1-butene)) with high grafting density were successfully synthesized based on \u201cGraft onto\u201d strategy. The grafting density of PVSt- g -(PS- b -PE) was 35\u201339% (branch chain number per 100 repeating units of the backbone). By introducing PS block in the side chains, the total PS volume fraction in the copolymers could be adjusted to explore the influence of the volume fraction of total PS component (PVSt backbone\u00a0+\u00a0PS block) on morphology (at melt state) and linear rheological response of the copolymers. Compared to PSVS- g -PE copolymers with similar grafting density in the previous work ( Macromolecules , 2015,  48 , 7640), PVSt- g -(PS- b -PE) copolymers showed a microphase-separated structure at the melt state. The volume fraction of total PS in the comb-like block copolymers determined the type of morphology. When the volume fraction of PS changed from 11% to 55%, the microphase-separated structure changed from poor-order spherical structure to poor-order lamellar morphology, and all the samples of PVSt- g -(PS- b -PE) showed a typical rheological behavior of network-like structure. At the same time, the  G\u2032  curve and  G \u2033 curve were more away from each other at intermediate frequency with the increasing of PS content. The reason resulted from the formation of different microphase-separated structure types in the PVSt- g -(PS- b -PE).",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Controlled chain scissions of diene-based polymers, including  cis -1,4-polybutadiene ( c PB),  cis -1,4-polyisoprene ( c PIP),  trans -1,4-polyisoprene ( t PIP), 1,4-polychloroprene (PCP) and polycyclooctene (PCOE), were carried out under mild conditions via the hydrozirconation between C=C bonds and bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium hydrochloride (Cp 2 ZrHCl). The molecular weights ( M  n ) of the chain-scission products mainly depended on the loadings of Cp 2 ZrHCl and reaction time regardless of reaction media and temperature; however,  cis/trans  configuration ratio of C=C bonds in chain-scission products was influenced by reaction media, temperature and time. By means of NMR spectroscopy, chain-scission mechanism was confirmed to be  \u03b2 -alkyl elimination reaction. Deuterium ( 2 H) tracing experiments showed that the hydrogenation of C=C bonds was a detrimental competing reaction to  \u03b2 -alkyl elimination. Furthermore, the hydrogenation was strongly influenced by steric and electronic effects around C=C bonds. However, chemical environments around C=C bonds did not affect chain-end functionalization of products, as chain-end alkylzirconium complexes generated from \u03b2-alkyl elimination were facilely quenched by electrophiles to obtain chain-end functionalized products. More importantly, under the assistance of hydrogen (H 2 ), highly-efficient catalytic chain scission was achieved. Even more, cross-linked rubbers (such as cross-linked  c PIP) could be also cleaved catalytically into soluble oligomers.",

The reaction mechanism for cleaving C C bonds in PCP was studied in detail. It was found that the cleavage pathway was chlorine self-assisted \u03b2-alkyl elimination reaction, namely, \u03b2-alkyl elimination was promoted while chlorine in PCP was eliminated by releasing Cp 2 ZrCl 2 . The molecular weights of chain-scission products were controlled ranging from starting molecular weights of PCP to 0.2\u202fkg\u202fmol \u22121 ; at the same time, microstructures of chain-scission products were similar to chain structures of original PCP. In addition, chain-scission products could be chain-end functionalized by electrophiles quenching chain scission reaction. More importantly, efficient catalytic chain cleavage was achieved under the synergistic effect of [Cp 2 ZrClH] n  with both LiH and H 2 .",

The flame retardancy of polypropylene (PP) containing the novel intumescent flame retardant (IFR) based on the combination between SBCPO and melamine (MA) was studied by limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL-94 test and cone calorimeter test. Results indicated that this combination showed the excellent flame retardancy for PP at appropriate proportions (with the total loading of 30 wt. % and SBCPO: MA=4:1). The value of LOI was as high as 31.6, and the rating in UL94 reached to V-0. Moreover, the HRR and THR of IFR/PP decreased significantly in comparison with that of neat PP. The scanning electron microscopy results indicated that the incorporation of SBCPO could induce the formation of intumescent char layer, which retarded the degradation and combustion process of PP. The thermal oxidative degradation of the PP samples at different temperature was analyzed by FTIR. The thermal stabilities of the composites were further investigated by thermogravimetric analysis. It was found that the amount of residues was increased greatly with the addition of SBCPO that remained in the form of polyaromatic stacks and phosphoric or polyphosphoric acid at the residual chars. \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Their flammability properties were investigated by limiting oxygen index, UL-94, and cone calorimeter tests, which suggested that the medium-sized Mg(OH)2-5\u2009\u00b5m displayed the best flame retardancy. The residual char structure were analyzed and indicated that Mg(OH)2-5\u2009\u00b5m could form a better protective layer than other sized particles, leading to the better flame retardancy to PBS. \u00a9 2016 The Authors.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Recycled carbon fibre (RCF) reinforced poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) composites with high mechanical properties have been prepared through melt compounding. Here three epoxy resins (EP) with different molecular weights and epoxy values were used as in-situ coupling agent to improve the interfacial adhesion between RCF and PBT. The morphologies of impact fractured surfaces were studied to compare the effects of three kinds of EP on the interfacial adhesion between RCF and PBT. The optimal strengthening effect was achieved in the case containing EP with the highest molecular weight. The strengthening mechanism of EP on the mechanical properties of PBT/RCF composites was studied. The results showed that the improved mechanical properties of PBT/RCF composites resulted from the improvement for the interfacial adhesion between PBT and RCF and the in-situ extended chain reaction of PBT matrix with EP.",

        "abstract": "The fabrication of polymer nanocomposites with improved physical and chemical properties is a hot topic in the fields of materials and chemistry. In this work, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are functionalized through flame retardant wrapping and maleic anhydride polypropylene (PPMA) covalently attaching to achieve a compact char layer and strong interfacial adhesion. The resultant polypropylene (PP)/functionalized CNT (FCNT) composites show remarkably improved flame retardancy and mechanical properties. For example, with the incorporation of FCNTs, the mechanical properties of PP are largely improved, meanwhile the ductility is maintained. This is thanks to the strong interfacial adhesion between FCNTs and the PP matrix. In contrast, the elongation at break of the PP/CNT composites decreases seriously. More importantly, the flame retardancy of the PP/FCNT composites is much better than that of PP and the PP/CNT composites. The improved flame retardancy results from the fact that the flame retardant wrapping forms a char layer on the surface of the CNTs, which protects the CNTs from being destroyed during combustion. As a result, the quality of the residual char is improved. The flammability of the PP composites is strongly dependent on the residual char of the CNTs. The compact and continuous residual char of the FCNTs not only acts as the shield for heat transfer, but also hinders the migration of volatile decomposition products out of PP and the diffusion of oxygen into PP.",

        "abstract": "A crosslinked silicone-containing macromolecular charring agent (CSi-MCA) was synthesized via \u201cone-pot\u201d process, and it was combined with ammonium polyphosphate (APP) to synergistically improve the flame retardancy of poly(l-lactic acid) (PLA). The chemical structure of synthesized CSi-MCA was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance. The thermal gravimetric analyzer indicated that the CSi-MCA displayed good thermal stability and high residue via the catalytic crosslinking. Furthermore, the flame retardant effect of CSi-MCA and APP as intumescent flame retardants in PLA system was investigated by limited oxygen index, UL94, and cone calorimeter test. When the content of CSi-MCA was 5\u00a0wt% and APP was 10\u00a0wt% (CSi-MCA/APP\u00a0=\u00a01/2), the limited oxygen index value of composites was 33.6 and UL94 classed a V-0 rating. The peak heat release rate and total heat release of PLA composites containing both APP and CSi-MCA decreased significantly in comparison with those with APP or CSi-MCA alone. The flame retardancy mechanism was investigated via analyzing residual chars by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as well as the possible chemical reaction between APP and CSi-MCA by thermal gravimetric analyzer and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that the enhanced flame retardancy was attributed mainly to synergistic effect of CSi-MCA and APP, which could form a compact, continuous, and protective layer during combustion.

        "abstract": "Three-arm and four-arm star-like polybutadienes (PBds) were synthesized  the combination of living anionic polymerization and the click coupling method. Kinetic study showed that the click reaction between the azido group terminated PBd-t-N and the alkyne-containing multifunctional linking reagent was fast and highly efficient. All coupling reactions were fully accomplished within 40 min at 50 \u00b0C in toluene in the presence of the reducing agent Cu(0), proven by H-NMR, FTIR and GPC measurements. For the coupling reactions between the PBd-t-N polymer and dialkyne-containing compound, the final conversion of the coupled PBd-PBd polymer was  97.0%. When a PBd-t-N polymer was reacted with trialkyne-containing or tetraalkyne-containing compound, the conversion of three-arm or four-arm PBd was around 95.5% or 87.0%, respectively. Several factors influencing the coupling efficiency were studied, including the molecular weight of the initial PBd-t-N, arm numbers and the molar ratio of the azido group to the alkynyl group. The results indicated that the conversion of the target products would be promoted when the molecular weight of the PBd-t-N was low and the molar ratio of the azido to alkynyl groups was close to 1.",

        "abstract": "Auxetic materials are a class of materials possessing negative Poisson's ratio. Here we establish a novel method for preparing auxetic foam from closed-cell polymer foam based on steam penetration and condensation (SPC) process. Using polyethylene (PE) closed-cell foam as an example, the resultant foams treated by SPC process present negative Poisson's ratio during stretching and compression testing. The effect of steam-treated temperature and time on the conversion efficiency of negative Poisson's ratio foam is investigated, and the mechanism of SPC method for forming re-entrant structure is discussed. The results indicate that the presence of enough steam within the cells is a critical factor for the negative Poisson's ratio conversion in the SPC process. The pressure difference caused by steam condensation is the driving force for the conversion from conventional closed-cell foam to the negative Poisson's ratio foam. Furthermore, the applicability of SPC process for fabricating auxetic foam is studied by replacing PE foam by polyvinyl chloride (PVC) foam with closed-cell structure or replacing water steam by ethanol steam. The results verify the universality of SPC process for fabricating auxetic foams from conventional foams with closed-cell structure. In addition, we explored potential application of the obtained auxetic foams by SPC process in the fabrication of shape memory polymer materials.",

The morphology observation showed that the addition of nanofillers resulted in the increased dispersion degree of both LLDPE and PS components and even the transformation of phase structure from cocontinuous structure to sea-island structure, when enough amounts of nanoparticles were added. Meanwhile the introduction of enough amounts of OA-Fe 3 O 4  nanoparticles effectively enhanced the foaming ability of LLDPE/PS blend at semi-solid state during scCO 2  batch foaming. The mechanism analysis for the change of foaming behavior showed that the improved foaming capacity resulted from the change of the phase structure of LLDPE/PS blends and heterogeneous nucleation of OA-Fe 3 O 4  nanofillers. Sorption and desorption measurements showed that the addition of OA-Fe 3 O 4  nanoparticles in the LLDPE/PS blend increased the solubility of CO 2 , and the presence of enough amount of OA-Fe 3 O 4  decreased the desorption rate of CO 2  in the initial period of depressurization process, which are beneficial to cell nucleation and growth. Furthermore, it was found that the melt behavior and crystalline properties of LLDPE/PS blends were not the key factors to improved foaming behavior of the blends in the presence of OA-Fe 3 O 4  nanoparticles.",

        "abstract": "Auxetic materials are a class of materials possessing a negative Poisson\u2019s ratio. Here, we established a novel method for preparing auxetic foam from closed-cell polymer foam based on the steam penetration and condensation (SPC) process. Using polyethylene (PE) closed-cell foam as an example, the foams treated by the SPC process presented a negative Poisson\u2019s ratio during stretching and compression testing. The effect of steam-treated temperature and time on the conversion efficiency of negative-Poisson\u2019s ratio foam was investigated, and the mechanism of the SPC method for forming a reentrant structure was discussed. The results indicated that the presence of enough steam within the cells was a critical factor for the negative Poisson\u2019s ratio conversion in the SPC process. The pressure difference caused by steam condensation was the driving force for the conversion from conventional closed-cell foam to the negative-Poisson\u2019s ratio foam. Furthermore, the applicability of the SPC process for fabricating aux...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The fixation stage of cellular structure during polymer foaming process is difficult to control due to difficult removing of internal heat, especially for crystalline polymers such as polypropylene (PP). In order to control cellular structure in the fixation stage, we established an universal method by introducing water as an in-situ internal cooling agent during the foaming process of PP. Particularly, hydrophilic fillers were added into the high melt flow index polypropylene (HMI-PP) with poor foaming ability to study the effect of adsorbed water on the foaming process of PP/filler composites during sc-CO 2  batch foaming process. Compared to pure HMI-PP, HMI-PP/hydrophilic filler composites showed increased adsorption amount for water and melt viscosity. The water within the composites played a key role in the foaming process, which not only served as a physical foaming agent to increase the volume expansion ratio of PP composite foam, but also showed the function of rapid cooling foam proved by thermal imaging technology. As a result, the presence of some hydrophilic fillers within HMI-PP matrix significantly improved the foaming properties of HMI-PP, including preventing internal bubble collapse and significantly increasing the volume expansion ratio of the foam. The applicability of this method was validated using other PP materials besides HMI-PP, including high molecular weight PP (HMW-PP), high melt strength PP (HMS-PP).",

The morphologies and cellular structures of LLDPE/PS blends and LLDPE/PS/CB nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results indicated that the introduction of CB nanoparticles could effectively improve foaming ability of LLDPE/PS=50/50 blends, when enough amount of CB nanofillers was added. This was ascribed to the morphology transformation from cocontinuous structure to sea-island structure due to the presence of CB nanofillers. Furthermore the critical amount of CB for dramatically improving the foaming capacity depended on the foaming temperature. In contrast, the addition of CB in the LLDPE/PS blends with spherical dispersed phase (such as 80/20 or 20/80, by weight) did not dramatically change the foaming behavior of the blends.",

This work reports the preparation of porous carbon sheets on magnesium oxide from mixed thermoplastics including polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, and polyethylene terephthalate in a closed autoclave at 500 \u00b0C. The influence of the weight ratio of magnesium oxide to mixed plastics on the yield and textural properties of the carbon was examined. The morphology and structure of the porous carbon were also characterized. The maximum BET surface area was 713 m2 g\u22121 at a weight ratio of MgO/polymer of 4 and the maximum pore volume was 5.27 cm3 g\u22121 at a weight ratio of MgO/polymer of 6. The reaction mechanism was explored by analyzing the product distribution and composition of gas and liquid at different reaction times. Aromatics were the main source for the growth of carbon. Model experiments of carbonization of different aromatics were conducted to evaluate the carbonization reactivity of aromatics. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, especially acenes, produced more carbon.",

The influence of aromatic precursors on the yield, morphology, structure, surface composition, and textural properties of the carbons was investigated. The side-chain and number of the benzene ring promoted the yield of carbon. Acenes produced more carbon among the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The highest yield of carbon was 52.9\u202fwt% using pyrrole as precursor on a commercial sheet MgO. The size of micropores and macropores as well as nitrogen content was also dependent on the aromatics. Three types of MgO were compared using pyrrole as precursor. Morphology of MgO played a key role on the yield of porous carbon. The yield of carbon reached 50.5\u202fwt% and the surface area of carbon was 671\u202fm 2 \u202fg \u22121  on a home-made MgO. After KOH activation, the surface area of the porous carbon increased dramatically to 2788\u202fm 2 \u202fg \u22121  and exhibited a high adsorption capacity up to 980.4\u202fmg\u202fg \u22121  for methylene blue.",

Through controlling the amount of iron species stored in HCS, different samples were selectively prepared. Pristine HCS and the samples with different Fe 3 O 4  loading (HCS-Fe 3 O 4 -1, HCS-Fe 3 O 4 -2 and HCS-Fe 3 O 4 -3) were characterized by TEM, XRD, TGA and N 2  adsorption/desorption isotherms in detail, respectively. As electrode materials of supercapacitor, their capacitive performances have been investigated by CV, galvanostatic charge/discharge and EIS measurements in two-electrode system using different kinds of electrolytes. Owing to the optimal pore size and partially filled cavity structure, electrolyte ions exhibit easy and reversible transport through HCS-Fe 3 O 4 -2. So that HCS-Fe 3 O 4 -2 presents the highest specific capacitance of 193\u00a0F\u00a0g \u22121  at a scan rate of 1\u00a0mV\u00a0s \u22121  and retains 94.75% up to 10,000 cycles. The capacitance performance of this material tested by symmetric system showed even higher value than the results by three-electrode system from some other researches, indicating the potential applications of HCS-Fe 3 O 4 -2 in industrial and energy field.",

Graphene encapsulation of porous Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 nanorods is directly carried out from FeOOH@GO colloids by taking advantage of an electrostatic self-assembly method, owing to the positively-charged surface of FeOOH and the negatively-charged surface of GO. The combination of graphene and porous iron oxide brings about multifunctional features of the electrode materials as follows: (1) enhanced electrical conductivity makes the electrodes the current collectors; (2) reinforced softness of the electrodes accommodates the large volume changes during charge\u2013discharge cycles; (3) improved high specific surface area of the electrodes increases the accessibility of the active electrode materials to electrolyte; (4) the pores formed by graphene and iron oxide particles facilitate ion transportation; (5) iron oxide particles separate graphene and prevent their restacking or agglomeration, and vice versa, thus improving the immersion and splitting of electrolyte into and out of the electroactive material. Consequently, the porous iron oxide/graphene hybrid nanocomposites deliver a good performance in the electrochemical energy storage for lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The accessible surface area, conductivity, and pore size determine the capacitive properties of carbon-based materials. In this work, hierarchical nanoporous carbon (NPC) materials with a large specific surface area, high conductivity, and suitable pore size are prepared from nanoscaled Al-based metal-organic complex (Al-MOC) by annealing. The annealing temperature has a profound influence on the morphology of the NPC materials which in turn impact the electrochemical performance. Compared to annealing at a low temperature, an interconnected structure is formed at an annealing temperature exceeding 950\u202f\u00b0C to produce a larger accessible surface area. Owing to the interconnected structure and high conductivity, sample NPC-950 with the two-electrode configuration has the highest specific capacitance and the best stability. The specific capacitances are 298 Fg -1  at a scanning rate of 1\u202fmVs -1  in symmetrical supercapacitor device. These values are the largest values reported from ultrapure carbon-based EDLCs in an aqueous electrolyte so far. Furthermore, 96.73% of the capacity is retained after 5000 cycles in 1\u202fM\u202fH 2 SO 4  electrolyte. In an organic electrolyte, the supercapacitor cells composed of NPC produce an energy density of 43\u202fWh kg \u22121 . The NPC materials with large specific capacity and excellent stability produced by the simple and cost effective technique have large potential in supercapacitors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Catalyzing carbonization of polymer itself to form a protective carbonaceous layer has been proven to be an effective way to improve polymeru0027s flame retardancy, but there is still a great challenge to achieve synchronous enhancement in traditional test standards (such as LOI and UL-94 testing). In this study, a stiffener skeleton strategy combined with catalyzing carbonization was proposed to improve the flame retardancy of polycarbonate (PC). The synergistic effect of nanosized carbon black (CB)/Ni 2 O 3  on carbon yield and combustion properties of PC were investigated. An improvement with 31.4% in LOI, V0 in UL-94, and 50% reduction for PHRR in cone calorimeter test was achieved. According to char morphology and structure analysis, the flame retardancy mechanism was attributed to the enhanced barrier effect of carbon layer with interconnected structure and self-supporting capacity, which was promoted by the formation of carbon skeleton framework from PC and the catalytic carbonization from combined catalysts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This work reports a selective chemical activation method for the controllable synthesis of porous carbons with pore sizes ranging from micropores to hierarchical micro/mesopores from date sheets. Through selectively controllable carbonization and combined activation processes, the as-prepared carbon materials exhibit a high specific surface area (3337\u202fm 2 /g) mainly derived from ultra-micropores in the range of 0.7\u20130.9\u202fnm, which majorly contributes to CO 2  storage at a low pressure. Among the activated carbon materials prepared, ACDS-800-4 exhibits the highest CO 2  adsorption capacity (that is, 4.36\u202fmmol/g at 25\u202f\u00b0C and 1\u202fbar, and 6.4\u202fmmol/g at 0\u202f\u00b0C and 1\u202fbar), a good recyclability and selectivity. ACDS-800-6 exhibits a higher CO 2  adsorption capacity of 22\u202fmmol/g at 25\u202f\u00b0C and a high pressure of 40\u202fbar. This work demonstrates that the pore size is key to the CO 2  storage at lower pressures while specific surface area plays an important role under high pressure adsorption process. Since these efficient microporous carbons are synthesized from biomass, this work provides a potential way to develop cost-effective adsorbents for removing CO 2  at both low and high pressures and various temperatures.",

Three-dimensional (3D) carbon materials derived from sustainable biomass have been widely investigated but also suffer from the moderate volumetric performance. In this work, using biomass (jujube) as carbon precursor, robust 3D porous carbon with a high particle density of 1.06     g    c    m    \u2212  3       is synthesized through high-temperature carbonization and subsequent activation. In three-electrode system, the electrode exhibits an ultrahigh volumetric capacitance of 476       F    c    m    \u2212  3       in 6\u202fM KOH electrolyte, which is much higher than previously reported results. The symmetrical two-electrode supercapacitor delivers excellent rate capability (75% capacitance retention at 20     A      g    \u2212  1      ) as well as superior cycle stability (91% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles) in 1\u202fM\u202fH 2 SO 4  electrolyte. Furthermore, an energy density as high as 13     W  h      L    \u2212  1       at a power density of 477     W      L    \u2212  1       is demonstrated in 1\u202fM Li 2 SO 4  electrolyte. The high volumetric performance of our biomass-derived porous carbon meets the requirements of portable devices and the fabrication process can be scaled up easily to industrial levels.",

        "abstract": "Recently, sustainable development and serious energy crisis called for appropriate managements for the large number of municipal and industrial waste plastics as well as the development of low-cost, advanced materials for energy storage. However, the complexity of waste plastics significantly hampers the application of ever used methods, and little attention is paid to the utilization of waste plastics-derived carbon in energy storage. Herein, porous carbon nanosheets (PCNSs) was produced by catalytic carbonization of \"real-world\" mixed waste plastics on organically-modified montmorillonite (OMMT) and the subsequent KOH activation. PCNSs was featured on hierarchically micro-/mesoporous structures with the pore size distribution centered on 0.57, 1.42 and 3.63\u202fnm and partially exfoliated graphitic layers, and showed a high specific surface area of 2198\u202fm\u202fg and a large pore volume of 3.026\u202fcm\u202fg. Benefiting from these extraordinary properties, PCNSs displayed a superior performance for supercapacitors with high specific capacitances approaching 207 and 120\u202fF\u202fg at a current density of 0.2\u202fA\u202fg in aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively. Importantly, when the current density increased to 10\u202fA\u202fg, the specific capacitances remained at 150\u202fF\u202fg (72.5%) and 95\u202fF\u202fg (79.2%) in aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively. The outstanding rate capability of PCNSs was in sharp contrast to the performance of traditional activated carbons. This work not only provides a potential way to recycle mixed waste plastics, but also puts forward a facile sustainable approach for the large-scale production of PCNSs as a promising candidate for supercapacitors.",

In order to study the effect of particle shape on the structure and rheological properties of suspensions, the content of surface oxygen-containing functional groups of carbon-based particles is controlled to be similar. Original spherical-like CB (fractal filler), rod-like MWNT and sheet-like graphene form large agglomerates in PDMS, while spherical HCS particles disperse relatively well in PDMS. The dispersion state of carbon-based particles affects the critical concentration of forming a rheological percolation network. Under weak shear, negative normal stress differences (\u0394) are observed in CB, MWNT and graphene suspensions, while \u0394 is nearly zero for HCS suspensions. It is concluded that the vorticity alignment of CB, MWNT and graphene agglomerates under shear results in the negative \u0394. However, no obvious structural change is observed in HCS suspension under weak shear, and accordingly, the \u0394 is almost zero.",

The Avrami equation was used to analyze the isothermal crystallization process, while the analysis of nonisothermal crystallization process was based on the Jeziorny-modified Avrami model and Mo model. The kinetics results of isothermal and nonisothermal crystallization verified the peculiar effects of branches on the crystallization process of PP backbones in PP--PS and PP--PBA graft copolymers: on one hand, the interaction between branches (\u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between PS branches, or dipole-dipole interaction between PBA branches) restrained the mobility and reptation ability of the PP backbones, which hindered the crystallization process; on the other hand, the heterogeneous nucleation effect resulting from the branched structure and fluctuation-assisted nucleation mechanism (caused by microphase separation between the PS or PBA rich phase and the PP rich phase) became more pronounced with increasing branch length, which facilitated the crystallization process.",

The as-synthesized SEPS-g-PEO copolymers were characterized by SEC, 1H-NMR, FTIR, SAXS, AFM and DSC. When the branch length is relatively small, increase of PEO fraction leads to the increase of the correlation length between neighboring hard domains, but the degree of correlation reduces. When the branch length is relatively large, the phase-separated structures become random both in terms of size and spatial correlation, and macro-phase separated structures appear. The crystallization behavior of the PEO branches can be effectively inhibited in SEPS-g-PEO, so no significant crystallization takes place until the fraction of PEO branches is 20.1 wt%, which greatly promotes the rapid delivery of hydrophilic drugs in the hot-melting pressuresensitive adhesives (HMPSAs) based on SEPS-g-PEO. Their cumulative release amount of a model drug could achieve 80%, more than twice the value in the HMPSAs based on linear PEO-containing styrenic block copolymers.",

        "abstract": "A \u201cgraft onto\u201d method was combined with an epoxidation reaction and living anionic polymerization to successfully synthesize a series of SIS-g-PB copolymers with defined branch numbers and branch lengths. These copolymers were utilized to formulate various hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesives (HMPSAs). Their molecular structure and bulk properties were characterized by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and rheometry. The adhesion performances were characterized in terms of holding power and 180\u00b0 peel strength. The epoxidation reaction alone would negatively influence the rheological properties of the parent SIS copolymers, particularly for low-temperature applications. Controlled addition of the low-Tg PB blocks can significantly improve the low-temperature properties of the SIS copolymers. Both \u03b7* and G\u2032 increased in the lower shear frequency regime ( 101 rad s\u22121) with branch number and branch length, in which branch length had a greater effect than the branch number. As a result, the 180\u00b0 peel strength of the SIS-g-PB based HMPSAs displayed reached 0.23 kN m\u22121, which is more than twice the value for SIS-based HMPSAs.",

Herein, we report the temporally and stereocontrolled 3,4-polymerization of isoprene through allosterically regulating the active metal center by alternating addition of Lewis basic pyridine to \u201cpoison\u201d the Lewis acidic active metal species through acid\u2013base interactions and Lewis acidic AliBu3 to release the original active species through pyridine abstraction. This process is quick, quantitative, and can be repeated multiple times while maintaining high 3,4-selectivity. Moreover, this strategy is also effective for the switch copolymerization of isoprene and styrene with dual 3,4- and syndiotactic selectivity. Tuning the switch cycles and intervals enables the isolation of various copolymers with different distributions of 3,4-polyisoprene and syndiotactic polystyrene sequences.",

The covalent linkage between polyethylene and multi-walled carbon nanotubes is demonstrated. The MWCNTs are chemically oxidized first by a strong oxidizing agent and then functionalized with chlorocarbonyl groups(MW\u2015COCl) via reacting with thionyl chloride. The MW\u2015CH=CH2 are obtained by esterification of \u03c9-undecylenyl alcohol with MW \u2015 COCl. The MW\u2015 CH = CH2 may serve as olefin-type comonomers to further synthesize core-shell structured copolymers with a multi-walled carbon nanotubes core grafted with side chains of polyethylene via rac-(en)(THInd)2ZrCl2 copolymerization catalyst. The core-shell structured nanocomposites were characterized by means of 1H-NMR, SEM, FTIR and TGA.

        "abstract": "A series of the copolymers of ethylene with 1-hexene (M1-M9) synthesized by metallocene catalyst Et[Ind]ZrCl/MAO was studied by differential scanning calorimetry and successive self-nucleation and annealing (SSA) thermal fractionation. The distribution of methylene sequence length (MSL) in the different copolymers was determined using the SSA method. The comonomer contents of samples M4 and M5 are 2.04 mol% and 2.78 mol%, respectively. Both M4 and M5 have low comonomer content and their MSL distribution profiles exhibit a monotonous increase trend with their MSL. The longest MSL of M5 is 167, and its corresponding molar percent is 43.95%, which is higher than that of M4. Moreover, the melting temperature ( ) of M5 is also higher than that of M4. The comonomer contents of samples M7, M8, and M9 are 8.73 mol%, 14.18 mol% and 15.05 mol%, respectively. M7, M8, and M9 have high comonomer contents, and their MSL distribution profiles display unimodality. M7 has a lower peak value of 33 and a narrow MSL distribution, resulting in a   lower than that of M8 and M9. The MSL and its distribution are also key points that influence the melting behavior of copolymers. Sometimes, MSL and its distribution of copolymers have a greater impact on it than the total comonomer contents, which is different from traditional views.",

The electronic band structure of BTO was calculated based on density functional theory (DFT) and the La-doped BaSnO 3  (BLTO) thin films were deposited by the magnetron sputtering technique on the 7059 glass at high temperature. The structural, electronic and optical properties of BLTO have been investigated. The experimental results show that BLTO thin film has a preferred orientation (0 1 1). The structure and band gap of the BLTO thin film can be tuned by increasing temperature. The Hall measurements indicated that BLTO films are n-type conductors and the carrier concentration and mobility of BLTO thin film deposited at 730\u00b0C are about 1.3\u00d710 18  cm \u20133  and 8.2 cm 2 V \u20131 s \u20131 , respectively.

The obtained copolymers exhibited excellent thermal stability and thermomechanical properties. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of BAPh/P-a 5:5 system at different curing procedure proved the curing reaction mechanism. In addition, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves showed that the curing reaction of the BAPh was induced by the active hydroxyl produced by the ring-opening polymerization of P-a; compared to the neat monomers, the curing temperature of the copolymer decreased and the curing speed improved. The evolution of thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) curves revealed that the poly(BAPh/P-a)-5:5 displayed highest  T   5%  ,  T   10%  , and char yield. The dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) proved that the glass transition temperature and storage modulus of copolymers with the BAPh monomer as the matrix increased with the content of P-a increase, while copolymers with P-a as the matrix obtained nearly same results. The poly(BAPh/P-a) -5:5 exhibited best thermal and thermomechanical properties among different composition copolymers.",

The curing behavior of the blends of the prepared PN monomers with 10\u202fwt% of 4-(4-aminophenoxy)-phthalonitrile (4-APN) as curing agent was evaluated by FTIR and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), while rheometer was used to analyze the processability of the blends.

Electrodes with combined optical transparency and softness are highly desirable, and sometimes indispensable for many ocular electrophysiology measurements. Here we report the fabrication of soft graphene contact lens electrodes (GRACEs) with broad-spectrum optical transparency, and their application in conformal, full-cornea recording of electroretinography (ERG) from cynomolgus monkeys. The GRACEs give higher signal amplitude than conventional ERG electrodes in recordings of various full-field ERG responses. High-quality topographic mapping of multifocal ERG under simultaneous fundus monitoring is realized. A conformal and tight interface between the GRACEs and cornea is revealed. Neither corneal irritation nor abnormal behavior of the animals is observed after ERG measurements with GRACEs. Furthermore, spatially resolved ERG recordings on rabbits with graphene multi-electrode array reveal a stronger signal at the central cornea than the periphery. These results demonstrate the unique capabilities of the graphene-based electrodes for in vivo visual electrophysiology studies.",

        "abstract": "An electronic \"smart\" contact lens device with high gas permeability and optical transparency, as well as mechanical compliance and robustness, offers daily wear capability in eye interfacing and can have broad applications ranging from ocular diagnosis to augmented reality. Most existing contact lens electronics utilize gas-impermeable substrates, electronic components, and interfacial adhesion layers, which impedes them from applications requiring continuous daily wear. Here we report on the design and fabrication of an eye interfacing device with a commercial ocular contact lens as the substrate, metal-coated nanofiber mesh as the conductor, and in situ electrochemically deposited poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) /poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) as the adhesion material. This hydrogel contact lens device shows high gas permeability, wettability, and level of hydration, in addition to excellent optical transparency, mechanical compliance, and robustness. Using a rabbit model, we found that the animals wearing these hydrogel contact lens devices continuously for 12 hours showed a level of corneal fluorescein staining comparable to those wearing pure hydrogel contact lenses for same period of time, with no obvious corneal abrasion or irritation, indicating their high level of safety for continuous daily wear. Finally, full-field electroretinogram (ERG) recordings on rabbits were carried out to demonstrate the functionality of this device. We believe that the strategy of integrating nanofiber mesh-based electronic components demonstrated here can offer a general platform for hydrogel electronics with the advantages of preserving the physiological and mechanical properties of the hydrogel, thus enabling seamless integration with biological tissues and providing various wearable or implantable sensors with improved biocompatibility for health monitoring or medical treatment.",

        "abstract": "A simple, rapid and low-cost determination method of benzo()pyrene in fried and baked foods was proposed by high performance liquid chromatography combined with vesicular coacervative supramolecular solvent (SUPRAS) extraction. The vesicular coacervate was composed of 1-octanol and tetrabutylammonium bromide. 200\u00a0mg of dried samples with 600\u00a0\u03bcL SUPRAS could be mixed to extract benzo()pyrene. Neither evaporation nor further clean-up steps for the extracts were needed. The overall sample treatment took approximately 30\u00a0min, and several samples could be simultaneously treated using conventional lab equipment. Then, benzo()pyrene was analyzed via liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection. Parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were investigated and optimized. The results showed good linearity of benzo()pyrene with the coefficients of determination ( ) of more than 0.9999 in the range of 0.1-50.0\u00a0\u00b5g/kg. The limit of detection of the method was 0.11\u00a0\u00b5g/kg. Recoveries for spiked samples in the range of 1-10\u00a0\u00b5g/kg were between 89.86 and 100.01%, with relative standard deviations from 1.20 to 3.20%. Benzo()pyrene was present in food samples (including instant noodles, biscuits, rice crust and fried bread stick) at concentrations in the range of 0.08-0.39\u00a0\u00b5g/kg according to the proposed method. The proposed pretreatment method significantly reduces the analysis time. Furthermore, the solventless approach is in accordance with the green chemistry development trend and has significant application prospects.",

        "abstract": "A simple and effective sample enrichment method of frozen zone melting liquid-liquid extraction was optimized and validated for the analysis of trace N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in beer samples. The method was based on high pressure liquid-liquid extraction with a low temperature frozen step. The 90 mL beer was placed in a container with 10 mL dichloromethane. After agitation, the sample was kept in a freezer for 16 h at -19 degrees C. The organic extract was analyzed by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The accuracy, precision, detection and quantification limits and linearity of the method were evaluated. The results showed that the calibration curve of NDMA was linear in the range of 5-200 mg/L with a good correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.999 6. The recoveries at the spiked levels of 5, 10 and 20 mg/L were 84.94%, 83.24%, 85.14% with the relative standard deviations (n = 7) of 3.06%, 3.19%, 2.63%, respectively. The ordinary extraction method of N-nitrosodimethylamine in beer includes the four steps of low-temperature distillation, liquid-liquid extraction, rotary evaporation and nitrogen blowing concentration. With the extremely low volume of solvent used, the proposed extraction method proved to be easy and simple, and adequate for high-throughput analysis at low cost.",

Two effective approaches used to achieve the best signal to noise ratio (S/N) are increasing the confocal precision and minimizing the background noise. A novel three-dimensional adjustable confocal LIFD was developed, using a new three-dimensional adjustable supporter of reflector and modularized optical system. A detection limit (S/N = 3) of 1 x 10 -12 mol/L and a linear dynamic range of 3 orders of magnitude were obtained using, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) standard as the test sample. The noise level and drift levels were 8. 0 x 10 -3 mV and 1. 4 x 10 -3 mV/h, respectively; which were almost 10 times lower than before. And the stability of the LIFD was evaluated by five replicate injections of 5 x 10 -9 mol/L FITC, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) of peak height and peak area were 0.38% and 0.41%; respectively. Further more three biogenic amines, which were derivatized by FITC, were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and then detected by the novel LIFD. And the detection limits (S/N = 3) ranged 0. 01 to 0. 02 nmol/L, which were better than other methods. Therefore' the LIFD is highly sensitive, as well as shows a real low noise level and good reproducibility.",

A commercial C18 column was also tested under the same chromatographic conditions for comparison. The results indicated that the ligand was successfully bonded to the surface of the silica and the maximum relative deviations of element contents were within 5% for carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen by three times. Furthermore, in the separation of five basic anilines and four basic pyridines, the excellent selectivity and symmetrical peak shapes provided a reference for advancing the commercialization of the new stationary phase.",

        "abstract": "A comprehensive orthogonal two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) based on the modification of mobile phases was developed with a sample loop-valve interface. To improve the compatibility of mobile phases and analysis speed, some special solvents were chosen as the mobile phases, and the column temperature was elevated to decrease the viscosity of mobile phases of reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). Based on this principle, the first dimension was normal-phase liquid chromatography (NPLC) with a SiO2 column, and the second dimension was reversed-phase liquid chromatography containing two tandem C18 columns. 1,4-Dioxane was used in the NPLC mobile phase, and isopropyl alcohol was employed in the RPLC mobile phase. Moreover, the elevated column temperature enabled the reduction of the backpressure and using tandem C18 columns to improve the resolving power in RPLC. The new comprehensive 2D-LC system and applied strategy offered a novel idea for construction of 2D-LC system. A traditional Chinese medicine, Zhengtian pill, was used as the test sample to evaluate the constructed 2D-LC system. 876 peaks were detected, and the peak capacity reached 1740.",

Using a self-designed and assembled diode array detector (DAD), a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system was constructed. The illegal additive auramine O in six kinds of herbal slices and the active ingredient schisandrin in Jujube kernel Tianma capsules were separated and qualitative analyzed using the HPLC-DAD system. The results showed that there were similar peaks in the chromatograms of pollen typhae and Jujube kernel Tianma capsules when comparing the target analytes. However, the probabilities of the targets were excluded by comparing the absorption spectra. The application results indicated that, based on the double qualitative principle of retention time/absorption spectrum, the interference of impurities in the samples could be well eliminated and the false positives could be avoided. This provides a reference method for the study of traditional Chinese medicine components.",

        "abstract": "The optical absorption detector is one of the most commonly used detectors for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). As a core part of this kind of detector, the designs of flow cells, where light passes through samples for acquiring samples information, will affect the performance of a detector. In order to enhance the signal to noise ratio of detectors and reduce the bands broadening that come from flow cells, it is necessary to design a flow cell with a longer optical path length and a less cell volume while maintaining the luminous flux. However the limitations of the machining capacity make it difficult to increase the optical path length, reduce the cell volume and keep or increase the luminous flux simultaneously. It is a challenge to optimize the designing and machining of flow cells so as to improve the performance of detectors. This review discusses the development of designing flow cells based on the detection principle in some aspects of increasing the optical path length, reducing the cell volume, taking the advantages of total reflection and so on. At the same time, some of the designs are illustrated in detail. These various ideas and structures are significant references for designing flow cells and developing optical absorption detectors.",

Under the optimized reaction conditions, the stationary phase with a mole ratio of 3:7 between C 18  and sulfonic group was obtained. The morphology and feature of the stationary phase were characterized by scanning electronic microscopy, elemental analysis and infrared spectra. The chromatographic properties of the prepared stationary phase were systematically investigated in different separation modes. Five alkyl benzenes and three nucleosides were separated successfully by reversed phase chromatography and hydrophilic interaction chromatography, respectively. The bovine serum albumin digest was also well separated on the stationary phase. The results indicated that the prepared mixed-mode stationary phase could provide multiple separation mechanism and had potential advantages in separating complex samples and adjusting the selectivity.",

Being one of the key components in the system, the nano flow rate pump directly affected the accuracy and repeatability of the analysis. Based on two high precision direct-driven motors and a ten-port switch valve, a single stroke direct-driven ultrahigh pressure nano pump was developed. The results show that the accuracy of the flow rate and stability were better than 1% and 0.7%, respectively, at 500 nL/min. The maximum operating pressure was more than 100 MPa, and the gradient deviation was lower than 1%. The nano pump was used to construct a nano liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system. A bovine serum albumin (BSA) digest (1 \u03bcg) was analyzed by the system, and a sequence coverage of 45% was achieved. Furthermore, 2809 proteins were identified from a 1.25 \u03bcg Hela cell digest. All these results demonstrated that the single stroke direct-driven ultrahigh pressure nano pump could be a useful tool in the biochemical analyses, especially for proteome research.",

        "abstract": "Ensuring safety in railway signalling system is always considered as significant as a guarantee of the safe and efficient operation of the whole railway. In fact, safety analysis of the signalling system with distributed computer technique is becoming extraordinarily difficult because of the frequent and complex interaction between components and the various backup modes. The dominant approaches are subjective, difficult to be reused, not well structured, thus leaving the safety analysis process time-consuming and error-prone. This paper develops a hierarchical methodology for safety analysis based on the failure propagation model and state-transition model. Unlike traditional safety analyses, the proposed approach demonstrates more accurate representation of practical failure behaviour in computer-based signalling system. Dynamic properties, system structure and failures in component level are separately modelled in different layers, and connected with synthesis laws. The analysis can be easily refined as the system design progresses and automatically produces safety-related information to help engineer in making design decisions. The preliminary design of Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) system for Yizhuang Line in Beijing is used to demonstrate the approach.",

        "abstract": "With the method which integrated UML with symbolic model checking, the formal verification of CTCS-3 level system requirement specification was carried out. The UML model of requirement specification was extended and abstracted using event and visible-variable abstraction methods. According to the transformation rules, the NuSMV model of requirement specification was established. Verification for domain independent and domain dependent properties of NuSMV model was elaborated. Additionally, the approach of the counterexample was proposed for tracking, locating and correcting errors. Taking the mode switch in the requirement specification for example, the proposed formal verification method was adopted for the verification of mode switch. The result of verification shows that mode switch can satisfy the requirements of liveness, transition, non-deadlock, determinacy and safety. The process of verification shows that the method which integrates UML with symbolic model checking is suitable for the verification of CTCS-3 level system requirement specification.",

To decrease the memory space and enhance the real-time property of train positioning, it is necessary to find an effective data reduction algorithm for huge GPS data. Modeling and analysis indicate that the problem of railway GPS data reduction is a NP problem and it is hard to get the optimal solution. A heuristic algorithm was put forward and 6 performance indexes were defined in this paper. The surveyed GPS data of two railway sections were used to analyze the performance index of the algorithm. The computational results show that the algorithm is effective and the running speed of the algorithm is very high. The algorithm can reduce the huge GPS data in a very low reduction rate under certain error requirement. When the error requirement is 1 m, the reduction rate is less than 2%; when the error requirement is 2 m, the reduction rate is about 1%. With the increase of the camber of railway, the reduction rate increases.",

In this paper an automated method to generate a complete set of test cases and test sequences was put forward. Definitions relating to the CPN model and test sequences of the system were given. The all paths covered optimization algorithm (APCO) and the sequence priority selected algorithm (SPS) were presented to automatically generate the XML test sequences. Taking radio blocking center (RBC) handover of the Chinese Train Control System Level 3(CTCS-3)as an example, test cases and test sequences were generated automatically and verified on the RBC test platform. The results indicate that the test generation achieves the goal of automation, and the repeatability rate of the test sequences generated in the scenario of RBC handover is reduced by 75% compared with the available depth-first search algorithm (DFS), thus covering all the related criterions specified in the CTCS-3 Function Requirements Specifications (FRS).",

        "abstract": "Recent developments in the modern control systems show a clear trend for increasing integration of a number of safety-related electronic systems - such as railway signalling system and x-by-wire systems - that are replacing traditional mechanical controls. These applications promise improved performance and safety through continuous high-capacity realtime data exchanges and reconfiguration in abnormal situations. However, safety analysis of networked systems is becoming extraordinarily difficult because of the complexity of interactions between components and the number of possible backup modes. The traditional analysis techniques are subjective and do not facilitate reuse, thus, making the safety analysis process time-consuming and error-prone. This paper extends the failure propagation model with a set of temporal operators, in order to demonstrate more accurate representation of practical failure behaviors of networked control systems. Computation laws of temporal operators and combinatorial operators are abstracted to transform complex temporal expressions into a standard form. In this way, the models can be solved automatically. The preliminary design of Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) system for Yizhuang Line in Beijing is used to demonstrate the approach.",

It is important to guarantee the safety of train control system. Safety testing is an effective method to detect the safety holes and bugs in the system. However, because of the special characters of train control system like diversification, structural complexity and multiplicity of interfaces, most safety testing for train control system are manually executed based on specialistic experience, which leads to a huge testing workload. Besides, manual generation will easily cause the problem of missing test cases. In this paper, a model-based safety test method is introduced. We select a core function of onboard system as the representative to study the method. This function was analyzed by Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) to get the bottom events, which are used to turn to fault models being injected into the whole system model, affected system safety, and a set of timed automata network model of the core function is built using the tools of UPPAAL. Then COVER, the real-time test case generation tool, is used to generate the safety test cases from the system model (included fault models) automatically, and states transition criteria is customized based on preferences to achieve user-defined test, the test accuracy and efficiency is improved. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The data communication system is one of the important factors affecting the control-proficiency, transportation ability, reliability and safety of the CBTC system. Based on the communication requirements of CBTC system, a formalized hierarchy model of trackside DCS with the hierarchy-timed coloured Petri Nets (CPN) was established. Meanwhile, a kind of time-stamp was introduced to analyze the timeliness of message transfer. Lots of simulations were conducted to analyze the real-time quality of the network. Performance evaluation shows that Ethernet is capable of meeting the requirements of CBTC system, and proves that the value and stability of transfer delay may have little to do with the number of the train, but has much more to do with the message length.",

For the reason that the carrier observation equation is affected by clock bias error, ionosphere delay, Troposphere delay and multi-path etc, it has limitations for one observation equation to detect cycle slips by using Calman filter. The method of multi-observation fusion is proposed to gain corresponding results and covariance through adaptive kalman filter. Optimal cycle slips is calculated from the results by least square fusion. The proposed method can meet the demand of distinguishing Beidou cycle slips and receiver clock jumps through measured data, and it can detect cycle slips accurately even with errors and particular combinations.",

Function testing method which is mainly focus on the conformance relation between the specification and the SUT has been widely used in testing the Onboard system in the past few years. However, most of the test cases are manually generated which can't be reused and leads to repeat works when the specification is changed. To improve the testing efficiency and quality, Model-based testing method is introduced. We use a tool chain to generate test case automatically based on Timed Automata theory and apply in function testing of the Onboard system. EBD-TR timed automata network model is established using tool Uppaal. And based on the EBD-TR model, two kinds of coverage criteria (all-location coverage, and all-edge coverage) are used in tool of CoVer to generate test case automatically. Different test suits of the Onboard system are acquired and a complete model transition function test suit is derived which is proven very useful for testing the Onboard system.",

So, verification of the qualities of DCS with simulation methods is of great significance to development and improvement of the CBTC system. The technique of modeling the security communication protocol developed by ourselves and the setup of a research platform for analyzing the performance of DCS using OPNET are introduced. The Finite State Machine (FSM) of the security communication protocol and the Configurable Generic Node Model (CGNM) of communication subsystems are proposed. The platform is used for studying the overall performance of the network with this security communication protocol. The examples of using the node model to construct the DCS network as well as the network performance simulation results are also introduced. Experimental results indicate that the imperfect synchronization of communication cycles can decrease the packet delay, and the maximum delay raises by about 34% when changing the root node of the spanning tree upon occurring of network faults.",

        "abstract": "ETCS Level 2 (European Train Control System Level 2, ETCS-2) has drawn particularly attention from researchers and industries. A new CPN model-based formal approach for test cases and sequences generation is proposed in this paper to increase the test automation degree of the ETCS-2 system and subsystems. In this paper, a set of modelling rules is presented firstly to make the Coloured Petri Net (CPN) model more suitable for test generation. Then, an automated test approach is described in detail, which includes an automatic test case generating algorithm and a type of automatic test sequence searching algorithm. The generated set of test cases satisfies specified coverage. The test sequence searching algorithm guarantees the results satisfying the minimum number of test sequences covering all test cases. The output of this approach is a set of well-formed XML (Extensible Markup Language) file to increase the automation degree of the test executing process. Finally, a partial model of ETCS-2 On-Board subsystem is built and analysed using the CPN Tools as a case study. The model-based formal approach is implemented on this model and the test cases and test sequences are all generated in a form of XML. The conclusion show that the CPN-model based testing approach can be used to improve the automation of the testing procedure and the generated test cases can meet the relative requirement. \u00a9 2010 WIT Press.",

        "abstract": "By utilizing the UML-supported low-level extensibility mechanisms, the UML was extended to cater to the compositeness of the train control systems. Semi-formalized modelling of the CTCS-3 System was carried out with the extended UML and the fault event mechanism was adopted to describe the faults of the system. The rule of transforming the UML model to the PHAVer model and the method of establishing the fault monitor model were presented. The content of functional verification of the system model and acquisition of the minimal cut set were elaborated. Taking RBC handover for example, the method of UML merging with calculation of reachable sets was applied in modeling and analyzing. The result shows that the UML and reachable sets combined method is suitable for function safety analysis of the CTCS-3 System.",

The safety communication protocol controls the establishment of safety connection between train and trackside. Because of its graphical user interface and modeling flexibility upon the changes in the system conditions, this paper proposes a composition Colored Petri Net (CPN) representation for both the logic and the timed model. The logic of the protocol is proved to be safe by means of state space analysis: the dead markings are correct; there are no dead transitions; being fair. Further analysis results have been obtained using formal and simulation-based verification approach. The timed models for the open transmit system and the application process are created for the purpose of performance analysis of the safety communication protocol. The models describe the procedure of data transmission and processing, and also provide relevant timed and stochastic factors, as well as time delay and lost packet, which may influence the time for establishment of safety connection of the protocol. Time for establishment of safety connection of the protocol in normal state is verified by formal verification, and then time for establishment of safety connection with different probability of lost packet is simulated. After verification it is found that the time for establishment of safety connection of the safety communication protocol satisfies the safety requirements. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Separate solutions to the reliability and usability of these two different net structures are given. Making use of the relative probabilities of the Markov chain, the reliability of different configurations of the GSM-R network and the applicability of different configurations of the GSM-R network in train operation at different velocities are calculated. The results show as follows: The reliability and usability of the co-site network is far higher than that of the intercross network; the main reason is that the system of the co-site network will not fail in case of interruption of one. Base Transceiver Station (BTS) at one level however, in the intercross network, when one BTS at one level fails, the whole system will not fail only when both the two adjacent BTSs at another parallel level do not fail; in addition, the rate of handover is lower in the co-site network, which can efficiently reduce the impact of handover on the reliability and usability of the co-site network.",

Through the analysis, the advisory speed and optimized speed profile are given. By the use of advisory speed, train can avoid conflicts at platform and reduce the running time for entering station. The energy consumptions, power demand and delay reduction during the entering station process are also estimated through simulations.

The design and implementation of the UDP-based security communication protocol are introduced. The module of the protocol is built using OPNET, the multi-task schedule of the VxWorks real time operating system is simulated, and the communication performance research platform is set up on the basis of the switched Ethernet. The communication process is simulated basing on the real running situation of ZC, then the influence of the send window on the maximum delay of packets is analyzed. Simulation results show that the appropriate number of send windows is able to improve the precision of communication time and the efficiency of data transmission at the same time.",

As an emerging technology, the communication based heavy haul train control (CBHHTC) system is becoming a better alternative for administrative department to provide the greater transport capacity. In order to put the latest automatic control methods into the practice, this paper investigates the robust optimal control problem of heavy haul train under CBHHTC. By formulating the CBHHTC based real-time control procedure as a networked control system (NCS) model, the possible data loss phenomenon in the wireless communications is considered, and its impact on the stability and performances of the controller design is elaborated. On the basis of Lyapunov stability theory and model predictive control (MPC) approach, a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is given as sufficient conditions to ensure the velocity tracking ability, energy-efficiency and operational safety with a prescribed H disturbance attenuation level under the control constraints. Case studies are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.",

For a fully automatic operation system, it provides a flexible way to coordinate trains. The coordination of trains can improve some system performances, such as the efficient use of regenerative energy. The efficient use of energy regenerated by other trains which are during braking phase can contribute to reducing energy consumption. In general, the approaches of coordinated train control for using regenerative energy can be divided into two types: train dwell time control and train running time control. This paper proposes an approach for coordinating trains in fully automatic operation system by modifying running time between adjacent stations. Simulation studies are performed and the usage of regenerative energy and average passenger waiting time is analysed by using the proposed method. It is shown that improvements in the usage of regenerative energy can be achieved by using the proposed method. \u00a9 2012 WIT Press.",

        "abstract": "Based on the braking characteristics of train station parking in urban rail transit, two simplifications about the train dynamics equation were made: one was neglecting the influence caused by the air resistance and the gradient, the other was assuming that there was a braking delay and a constant deceleration or the deceleration was a linear function of the initial speed. Then, two simplified models were developed to estimate the train station parking error. Furthermore, the linear relationships between the parameters of the two models were induced and the online learning algorithm for updating the models' parameters was developed to overcome the influence by the nonlinear factors in parking to increase the parking accuracy. According to the statistics principle, five evaluation indices were adopted to evaluate the performance of the models and the parking error estimation was adopted to judge whether the parking error could meet the requirements of parking reliability. The field train parking data were used to validate and compare the performance of the models and the online learning algorithm. The results show that the proposed simplified models and the online learning algorithms are effective in reducing the parking error and correct the bias of the error distribution. When the parking error is greater than 99.5%, it can meet the 30 cm reliability requirements for the parking accuracy. Model 1 achieves better performance than model 2.",

        "abstract": "Ensuring safety in railway signalling systems is always considered as significant as a guarantee of the safe and efficient operation of the whole railway. In fact, safety analysis of the signalling system with distributed computer technique is becoming extraordinarily difficult, because of the frequent and complex interaction between components and the various backup modes. The dominant approaches are subjective, difficult to reuse and not well structured, thus leaving the safety analysis process time-consuming and error-prone. This paper develops a hierarchical methodology for safety analysis based on the failure propagation model and state-transition model. Unlike traditional safety analyses, the proposed approach demonstrates more accurate representation of practical failure behaviour in a computer-based signalling system. Dynamic properties, system structure and failures at the component level are separately modelled in different layers, and connected with synthesis laws. The analysis can be easily refined as the system design progresses and automatically produces safety-related information to help the engineer in making design decisions. The preliminary design of the Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) system for the Yizhuang Line in Beijing is used to demonstrate this approach. \u00a9 2010 WIT Press.",

The development and verification of interlocking tables is entirely manual process currently, which is inefficient and error-prone due to the complexity of the CBI and the human interferences. In order to tackle these problems, we introduce a toolset based on Domain Specific Language for Computer Based Interlocking Systems (DSL-CBI) to automatically generate and verify the interlocking table. In this paper, we address how to use the algorithm to automatically generate the interlocking table by inputting the XML file of the railway station designed by DSL-CBI, and how to use model checking to verify whether there are any conflicting settings in it. We also discuss the advantages of the toolset and the significant contribution in developing CBI based on the proposed toolset. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.",

The extension of the temporal logic can not meet all needs of describing the properties of the distributed real-time system. The scenarios of the train control system are often described in terms of the deadline, time-out and wait until and so on. Insufficiency exists in the above formal descriptions and also in verification along with intensification of the complexity of the system. In this paper, the modeling and verification methods suitable for the scenarios of the train control system are introduced. Firstly, HCSP is used to model the distributed real-time system. Secondly, the HCSP models are transformed to the TA models according to transition rules. Finally, automatic verification is accomplished with the checking tool UPPAAL. The effectiveness of the proposed modeling and verification methods are proved through simulation and analysis of RBC handover scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Locating is the basement of train control and onboard detecting. Train position is commonly expressed, as distance relative to a reference start point. For convenience of workers to find the position, the longitude and latitude gotten by GPS receiver should be translated into relative distance. Map matching method is used to do this. The best matching route and segment selection are keys of train locating by map matching method. Traditional methods are ergodic searching and bisearch. But they both have their limitation. This paper proposes a quick map matching algorithm for train location. It partitions the map into grids, builds database of stamp points and grids. The candidate routes and segments are searched in the limited area of adjacent grids around anchor point. The best matching route are determined with the least direction difference. At last, train relative location is calculated by interpolation within two stamp points. Experiment result indicates that the algorithm greatly reduce calculation load, which has nothing to do with complexity of route network. Especially, the algorithm can greatly enhance searching speed in lager database. Copyright ASCE 2007.",

When a train runs on railway lines at high speed, the GSM-R handover will happen frequently. If the data transmission collides with the GSM-R handover, communication will be interrupted shortly and part of data will be lost and retransmitted. In this paper the model of data transmission colliding with the GSM-R handover was designed. The model can be used to assess the effects of collision probability factors, verify the collision probability formula and research the collision time distribution. The model simulation results show as follows: The longer the application layer data length, the higher the train speed; the shorter the data transmission period, the higher the collision probability between data transmission and GSM-R handover; the collision probability abtained from model simulation is basically consistent with the collision probability calculated with the proposed formula. So the correctness of the model and formula are proved. Finally, the collision time distribution is researched with the collision model, and some qualitative conclusions are drawn.",

Modeling is carried through on the RBC handover protocol in ETCS-2 train control system specification from the point of hybrid system based on differential dynamic logic. The established model of RBC handover protocol consists of train submodel, handover submodel and takeover submodel. According to model characteristics, differential invariants are structured and proved by KeYmaera to validate the safety and liveness of the model. Combining with the domain knowledge, the key constraints are analyzed and fed back to the initial model in order to refine the model. During model validation process, the constraints for handover safety and efficiency parameters are found. It's known from parameter constraints that RBC handover efficiency is influenced by both the discrete control time of RBC and the running state of the train.",

A new predictive maintenance strategy that integrates dynamic evolution model and risk assessment is proposed which can be used to calculate the optimal maintenance time with minimal cost and safety constraints. The dynamic evolution model provides qualified risks by using probabilistic inference with bucket elimination and gives the prospective degradation trend of a complex system. Based on the degradation trend, an optimal maintenance time can be determined by minimizing the expected maintenance cost per time unit. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated and demonstrated by a collision accident of high-speed trains with obstacles in the presence of safety and cost constrains. \u00a9 2013 Tianhua Xu et al.",

Although some formal methods like HUML, HA and DL have already been used in modeling and verification train control systems, they are not good at describing communication behaviors which are in the interactive process of subsystems. To overcome this problem, we introduce a formal modeling and verification method for hybrid systems. First, we use HCSP to model the behavior of the system. Second, we transit the HCSP models to HA models by introducing some transition rules. Finally we input these HA models to PHAVer which is a tool for verifying safety properties of hybrid systems to automatic verification. Based on the simulation and analysis of a Movement Authority scenario in high speed train control system specifications, the method is proven to be validated. \u00a9 2012 WIT Press.",

        "abstract": "Along with development of the Beidou satellite navigation system in China, Beidou has gradually possessed the ability to be applied in train positioning. Train positioning requires track occupancy recognition, however, it is hard for Beidou to accurately position and recognize occupation of parallel tracks by civil pseudo-range positioning. Carrier phase positioning of Beidou has higher positioning accuracy, but its extensive and real-time application is limited because of the needs for differential signals from near reference stations and phase ambiguity resolution. In this paper, combining the advantages of non-ambiguity pseudo-range and high precision of carrier phase, the train positioning method was proposed on the basis of carrier phase smoothing pseudo-range. The algorithm of combinatorial phase and pseudo-range was employed to detect and repair cycle slips. The repaired carrier phase data were utilized to smooth pseudo-range. The principle of carrier phase smoothing pseudo-range was interpreted. The characteristics of different smoothing methods and corresponding noise testing equations were analyzed. The results of the two smoothing methods calculated with measured data indicate that the proposed train positioning method can detect and repair cycle slips effectively and quickly and achieve the Beidou pseudo-range accuracy better than 0.2 m, thus satisfying the requirements for accuracy of train positioning.",

        "abstract": "Train localization system is a vital part of train control system. A novel independent train localization method based on multi-sensor fusion is proposed in this paper. In conventional train localization system, the position determination is dependent on the reference information source controlled by rail operator, such as track circuit and so on. In some new train localization systems on test[1][2][3][4], the localization methods based on Satellite Navigation are very popular, so that the system's reliability and safety are put outside of the rail operators' control actually. The localization method proposed in this paper uses inertial sensor gyrometer and conventional odometer, which is mounted on the locomotive's driven axle. Gyrometer is used to measure train's heading angular rate. And odometer is used to measure train's velocity. Usually, the dead reckoning method independent of outside reference information is selected for these two sensors' fusion. But an obvious disadvantage of this method is the position error is increasing linearly according to time, so that this method can not work independently. Therefore Satellite Navigation system is often used to restrict the increasing error to an acceptable range. The method proposed in this paper overcomes the disadvantage of dead reckoning. Because the rail route or train's moving track is fixed, the route's curvature-mile curve can be obtained. According to this curve it is obvious, in the area where route is straight, the curvature value is zero; in the area existing a turning, the value is not zero. DGPS equipment is mounted on the test train to get and record the position data on the test route. Then the curvature-mile curve can be calculated from these data. We use Hurst coefficient to get the characters of train track such as turning from the gyrometer and odometer's data. By matching these characters and the known route's curvature-mile curve, the train's real-time position can be calculated. If the dual-direction communication channel such as GSM-R is available, virtual block or moving automatic block in train control system could be achieved. Details of this process are presented in this paper with some results to illustrate the effectiveness of the methods. Copyright \u00a9 2005 by ASME.",

Assume-guarantee (AG) reasoning is a promising compositional verification approach to deal with complexity. Proper decomposition and assumption design is vital in AG reasoning. We are motivated by the fact that a good insight into the target system can help the formal verification. So, instead of trying to automate the AG reasoning process, an accident model called STAMP is adopted to help us get a better understanding of the safety control system to be verified and a strategy for decomposition and designing assumptions accordingly. This conceptual approach is exemplified by verifying a simplified train control system.",

        "abstract": "The coordination between the on-board equipment of Chinese Train Control System Level 3 (CTCS-3)and the Radio Block Center(RBC)is realized by the collision avoidance protocol(CAP).According to the safety requirement for train collision avoidance,the model of CAP is represented by safety use case diagram and safety class diagram in the safety UML to implement the following safety functions:the train speed can never exceed the desired speed in any interval and the train position is never beyond the end of Movement Authority (MA).The safety function of CAP is implemented by the formal refinement of the continuous and discrete collision avoidance strategies.The former gives the static structure,the dynamic interaction and the continuous control strategy of CAP in the case that the speed and the position of the train are continuous variables.Otherwise,the latter has achieved the discretization for the continuous collision avoidance strategy by discrete logic.The CAP real-time program code is generated through the further refinement of the discrete collision avoidance strategy.The correctness and the safety of the refinement for the continuous and discrete collision avoidance strategies as well as the final code generation have been guaranteed by the rigorous reasoning based on the formal logic-Weakly monotonic time extension of iterative Duration Calculus(WDC*).",

        "abstract": "With recent advances in wireless networks, communication-based train control (CBTC) has become a popular approach to ensure the safe and efficient operation of railway trains. The requirements for train---ground communication in CBTC systems are stringent. Most existing works about train---ground communication systems consider the infrastructure mode without train---train direct communications. Due to unreliable wireless communications and frequent handovers, existing CBTC systems can severely affect train control efficiency and performance, as well as the utility of railway. In this paper, with recent advances in cooperative and cognitive wireless networks, we propose a CBTC system to enable train---train direct communications. In addition, the proposed cooperative and cognitive CBTC system is optimized with the cognitive control method. Unlike the exiting works on cooperative and cognitive wireless networks, in this paper, train control performance in CBTC systems is explicitly used as the performance measure in the design. Reinforcement learning is applied to obtain the optimal handover decision and adaption policy of communication parameters. Simulation result shows that the performance of train control can be improved significantly in our proposed cooperative and cognitive CBTC system.",

Thus the computer aided FTA method is important for related analysis. Existing computer aided FTA analysis methods invariably confront combinatorial problems which are computationally expensive and often with exponential increase of complexity, especially when it comes to large scale fault trees. In this paper, we propose a method based on the Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) with new conversion rules which are derived from the Component Connection Method. Besides, the Depth First Search (DFS) is applied to generate MCSs (Minimal Cut Sets). In the end, the Zone Controller of the CBTC (Communication Based Train Control) system is analyzed in case study. The result proves that the application of our new algorithm, of linear complexity, is more efficient than the algorithm of verifying all possible basic event combinations, both in computation speed and memory usage.",

The model checkers of Cad SMV, NuSMV, NuBMC and SPIN have been used to generate test sequence, but the high abstracted model of these tools can not keep all the detail informations to construct the test sequence. Colored Petri Net (CPN) models can reserve all the key details used to generate the test sequence directly. To the best of our knowledge, CPN have not been used in this area, one main reason is that the latest version of the CPN model checking tool can only determine the correctness of temporal logic formulas, and not counterexample is available. In this study, how to generate test sequence for train control system using CPN Tools is introduced. The environment models were used to close the model by the means of reading its script file and getting the input messages set of System Under Test (SUT). Radio Block Center (RBC) is chosen as the SUT and the scenario of Start of Mission is chosen as the example scenario. The result shows that the state space size is related with the environment script files when the SUT CPN model is fixed.",

        "abstract": "The interoperability of train control systems is an essential feature for high-speed railways. It must be proven that the on-board system of the train control system has the ability to allow the safe and uninterrupted movement of each line, which accomplishes the specified performance. A third-party interoperability test bench should be built for the customer to test the interoperability of the on-board systems, which are manufactured by different appliers. In this paper, a formal model was applied on the design and the verification of the test bench. The design errors can be detected using this formal model, thus the correctness of the test bench functionality was ensured. A structured Colored Petri Nets model was proposed to describe the test bench in the aspects of system, modules and processes. The model includes three sub-models: test bench, interface and onboard system. Colored Petri Nets was used for system modeling and CPN-TOOLS was used to support the simulation and the formal analysis. The hierarchical modeling method not only reduces the complexity, but also enhances the reliability and reusability. On the basis of these models, the architecture, the information flow and the algorithms of the test bench can be verified during the system design and development. The simulation results showed that the design errors can be found and some algorithms can be verified and corrected in the modeling and simulation process. \u00a9 2010 WIT Press.",

Fixed-point iteration equation is adopted to solve frame loss probability of redundancy and non-redundancy decomposed DCS model. The influence of different configuration and train velocity on the fame loss probability of DCS is analyzed. Analysis and calculation results show that the frame loss probability of the redundancy configuration DCS is far lower than that of the non-redundancy one. The main reason is that the redundancy configuration DCS does not fail due to single AP failure, which can efficiently eliminate the impact of handover on the frame loss probability of DCS on frame loss probability.",

After static sampling the longitude and latitude information of the track, a database with the relation between kilometer marks and their longitude/latitude of the track is built up. By searching in the database, the real-time longitude/latitude information acquired by GPS receiver is translated into the integer kilometer marks, and the next integer kilometer mark ahead can be found. Between two adjacent integer kilometer marks, the location information of GPS is projected to the actual track stored in the database to get more accurate position estimation of the train. On the curve section of the track, another method, named the same tangent direction algorithm, is also proposed. It adopted not only direction information of GPS but also the tangent heading information taken from the database to get actual train position on curve segment. Field experiment shows that this method improved the train positioning accuracy and the expected effect is reached.",

Based on the requirements of reliability and safety for vehicle navigation, the characteristics of navigation sensors are analyzed, the structure of integrated navigation system is designed with three data channels, and a fault detection and isolation algorithm is proposed based on principal component analysis for integrated vehicle navigation. In this method, considering the correlation of the navigation data, statistical principal component analysis (PCA) models are developed with historical navigation data under normal conditions, the fault detection is realized by verifying the deviation of new navigation data from the PCA models with control limits of certain statistics. The detection results of different data channels can be used for the dynamical adjusting of efficiency factor in navigation subsystem by prior strategies, and then fault can be isolated efficiently. The simulations results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can realize the fault detection and isolation efficiently with simple implementation. \u00a92009 by Science Press.",

An accurate position is the basis of precise detection. A research on the autonomous train location method is of great theoretical and practical significance for the positioning of comprehensive monitoring train and enhancing the infrastructure detecting level of the existing line. Comprehensive train monitoring synchronizes all diagnosis parameters by sharing time and position. However, it cannot correct the odometer's accumulative error with the track circuit's insulator in high-speed railways. This paper presents a novel position correction method with a single image. It analyses the three dimensional (3D) camera projection model and its disadvantage. A simplification from the 3D to the one dimensional (1D) model is proposed. The actual distance between the landmark and the camera optical center is calculated with image coordinates of the landmark acquired by the camera fixed on top of the train. Then, the actual position of the train can be calculated with the pre-stored landmark position and the calculated distance. Both academic and experimental errors indicate that the position correction method with a single image can satisfy the train positioning requirement. \u00a9 2010 WIT Press.",

Based on the passenger demand in urban rail transit systems, the optimal departure times, running times, and dwell times are obtained by solving the scheduling problem. Three solution approaches are proposed to solve the real-time scheduling problem for trains: a pattern search method, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) approach, and a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach. The performance of these three approaches is compared via a case study based on the data of the Beijing Yizhuang line.

        "abstract": "Safety is a constant priority for the railway industry and there are numerous hazards in and around the rail system which may result in damage to train and environment, human injury and fatalities. Low levels of human and organisational performance have been shown to be a prime cause of railway accidents and a number of accident models and methods have been developed in order to probe deeper into the role played by organisational factors in accident causation. The Systems-Theoretical Accident Modelling and Processes (STAMP) method for example, represents a promising systematic and systemic way of examining sociotechnical systems such as the railway. Another method, the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS), based upon Reason's model of human error in an organisational context, has also proved popular as a human factors accident analysis framework. However, human factors elements are still somewhat limited and under-specified and these managerial and social issues within an organisation are simply regarded as sources of failure in the control constraints of STAMP. HFACS likewise, categorises accident data rather than analysing it in more depth. In this context, a hybrid human and organisational analysis method based on HFACS-STAMP (HFACS-STAMP method for railway accidents, HS-RAs) is proposed to identify and analyse human and organisational factors involved in railway accidents. Using the categories of human errors derived from HFACS and the structured systematic analysis process of STAMP, the HS-RAs method provides a mechanism by which active failures can promulgate across organisations and give a systemic analysis of human error in accidents. Combined with human information processing, the HS-RAs method gives a detailed causal analysis of human errors from receiving information to implement control actions. At last, the HS-RAs method is demonstrated using a case study of the 2011 Yong-Wen railway collision. A number of prominent accident causes of human factors are revealed and necessary countermeasures are proposed to avoid the recurrence of similar accidents. The HFACS-STAMP hybrid method has several advantages and can contribute to railway safety by providing a detailed analysis of the role of human error in railway accidents.",

To huge GPS measurements, the multi-points weighted distance discrimination and Kalman estimation are applied to reject incorrect data; with improvement of Douglas-Peucker method, in which the original data are divided as the track curve feature and the limited error is adjusted dynamically, certain feature points are selected to describe the real track under low scale; based on the feature point set, interpolation points are generated by inverse calculation of cubic B-spline curve and equidistance interpolation as certain distance resolution, which could refine the track description under high scale. With the replenishment of mileage information, the generation of track map data could be realized completely. Calculation results with measurement data from Qinghai-Tibet railway show that, the method could meet various requirements of train positioning and control, with simple calculation and engineering realization.",

The heading angle and train velocities measured by the gyrometer and odometer are used to calculate the derivatives of the course angles to kilometrages. The derivatives represent curvatures of railway lines. With regard to one railway line, the derivative may be considered as fixed and be used to complete real-time matching with the preprocessed railway database to obtain the train kilometer. Firstly, according to the predefined threshold, judge whether a train enters a curve section. If a curve is detected, the time-domain correlation matching process is started. Then, calculate the correlation coefficients between the derivatives and the data from the railway database. The kilometrage of maximum coefficient is the result of matching, which is used to adjust the kilometrages calculated simply by means of odometer. To evaluate the method presented, an onboard data collection experiment was carried out; through offline calculation, the matching process was performed; train locating was finalized. The effectiveness and practicability of the method are proved. Error of displacement is limited within a certain range.",

In view of the repetitive characteristics of subway trains in stopping the iterative learning control scheme was implemented to adjust the initial state of the trains to eliminate repetitive uncertainty of stop. By solving the differential dynamic train braking model, the system gradient information was obtained and the iterative learning parameters satisfying convergence conditions were found. The multi-object optimization function was defined in consideration of the multiple objectives involved in train stopping. The method was extensively applied in adjustment of multiple various and multiple objectives, which fulfilled the requirements of stopping accuracy, riding comfort and energy saving. The simulation results verified the effectiveness of the method. Finally, future research direction of ATO train stopping was pointed out.",

A heuristic algorithm based on continual split and non-linear optimization is brought forward to realize the information fusion of multiple GPS track data with fixed endpoints. The results of the experiments show that the algorithm can learn the high-accuracy GPS data from the multiple low-accuracy GPS data.

In the GNSS based train positioning scheme, although with the aid of inertial sensors (e.g. the odometer, gyro, accelerator and Doppler radar) some systematic and random errors could be reduced or limited by an appropriate measuring method and data fusion filtering, it is significant to improve and guarantee the positioning precision and integrity performance by using the map matching (MM) technique in a cost effective way. In this paper, the structure of an electrical track map database is designed according to the requirements of precision and efficiency, the architecture of a GNSS based train positioning system integrating INS sensors is introduced, and a novel hybrid map matching algorithm is proposed, in which the determined train position is the integration of the position solution from multi-sensor fusion, the identification of the similarity or matching probability, and heading validation, with different track map levels. As the \"point-to-curve\" and \"point-to-point\" matching strategy are adopted with the provided feature of track map data, the adaptive performance and completeness of the map matching algorithm is guaranteed and improved. A field test in the Qinghai-Tibet line demonstrates that the proposed algorithm earns high position decision accuracy and integrity with simple implementation, which is of great practical value to precise train control and railway signalling. \u00a9 2010 WIT Press.",

        "abstract": "In subway systems, the energy put into accelerating trains can be reconverted into electric energy by using the motors as generators during the braking phase. In general, except for a small part that is used for onboard purposes, most of the recovery energy is transmitted backward along the conversion chain and fed back into the overhead contact line. To improve the utilization of recovery energy, this paper proposes a cooperative scheduling approach to optimize the timetable so that the recovery energy that is generated by the braking train can directly be used by the accelerating train. The recovery that is generated by the braking train is less than the required energy for the accelerating train; therefore, only the synchronization between successive trains is considered. First, we propose the cooperative scheduling rules and define the overlapping time between the accelerating and braking trains for a peak-hours scenario and an off-peak-hours scenario, respectively. Second, we formulate an integer programming model to maximize the overlapping time with the headway time and dwell time control. Furthermore, we design a genetic algorithm with binary encoding to solve the optimal timetable. Last, we present six numerical examples based on the operation data from the Beijing Yizhuang subway line in China. The results illustrate that the proposed model can significantly improve the overlapping time by 22.06% at peak hours and 15.19% at off-peak hours.",

In this paper, we study the charging policies in smart microgrids with EVs and renewable energy sources. Based on the renewable energy sources states, battery states, and the number of charging EVs, an optimal charging policy is obtained to maximize the energy utilization with service availability constraints.

During the train' s running process, the resistance force is changing with some factors, such as, speed and track geometry, and these factors play an important role in tracking accuracy. Most existing methods assume the resistance force is available for feedback control or consider constant resistance coefficients. Contrasted to these methods, a neuroadaptive variable structure controller for automatic train speed and position tracking under varying operation conditions is proposed in this paper. We consider the case that the basic resistance forces and additional resistance forces are both time-varying and unknown. This method is proposed to achieve high precision position and speed tracking. The fundamental principle of this method is to design the control using combination of neural network and adaptive variable structure technique.",

Neural networks are utilised to online approximating the unknown system dynamics, adaptive parameter identification is designed to estimate the unknown parameter, and DSC technique circumvents the problem of `explosion of complexity' in the traditional backstepping methodology. The major feature of the non-linear mapping-based feedback technique lies in that the merits of high-gain and low-gain control are synthesised by virtue of a novel non-linear continuous differentiable mapping feedback function, and a novel non-quadratic Lyapunov function is used to analyse the closed-loop system stability caused by the compound function of non-linear feedback. Finally, unprejudiced comparative results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control scheme.",

        "abstract": "Communication-based train control (CBTC) uses wireless networks, such as wireless local area networks (WLANs), to transmit trains status and control commands. CBTC systems have stringent requirements for train-ground communications, as the train control system depends on the accurate, timely and reliable data over the communication links. However, since WLANs are not originally designed for high mobility environment, random packet delay and losses are inevitable in WLAN-based CBTC systems, which could result in unnecessary traction, brake or even emergency brake of trains, losses of line capacity and passenger satisfaction. In this paper, we study the impacts of random packet delay on the performance of CBTC systems, and propose a novel scheme to improve the CBTC performance by mitigating the impacts of random packet delay. Unlike the existing works that only consider a single train, we consider a group of trains in CBTC systems to improve the CBTC performance. Extensive field test and simulation results are presented. We show that the current adopted control scheme in CBTC systems needs to keep stability and performance under transmission delays through increasing the distance between trains in steady state which means cost of line capacity. By contrast, our proposed scheme can significantly improve the CBTC performance.",

        "abstract": "In the moving block signalling (MBS) system where the tracking target point of the following train is moving forward with its leading train, overload of the substations occurs when a dense queue of trains starts (or restarts) in very close distance interval. This is the peak power demand problem. Several methods have been attempted in the literature to deal with this problem through changing train's operation strategies. However, most existing approaches reduce the service quality. In this paper, two novel approaches - \"Service Headway Braking\" (SHB) and \"Extending Stopping Distance Interval\" (ESDI) - are proposed according to available and unavailable extra station dwell times, respectively. In these two methods, the restarting times of the trains are staggered and traction periods are reduced, which lead to the reduction of peak power demand and energy consumption. Energy efficient control switching points are seen as the decision parameters. Nonlinear programming method is used to model the process. Simulation results indicate that, compared with ARL, peak power demands are reduced by 40% and 20% by applying SHB and ESDI without any arrival time delay, respectively. At the same time, energy consumptions are also reduced by 77% and 50% by applying SHB and ESDI, respectively. \u00a9 2013 Qing Gu et al.",

As a result, a small delay to one train can cause long knock-on delays to following trains because of the limit margin time and recovery time in the nominal timetable in bottleneck sections. This paper proposes a cooperative strategy framework for train rescheduling of portal junctions leading into bottleneck sections to decrease the overall delay and recovery from the unpredictable event of disturbances. The strategy is mainly based on an improved Differential Evolution algorithm for the Junction Rescheduling Model (DE-JRM), which is proved to be suitable for solving train rescheduling problems for both individual fly-over junctions and flat junctions. \u00a9 2010 WIT Press.",

Regenerative energy, generated by the braking train, is considered to store into its individual on-board energy storage devices and provided for the follow-up traction operations. Some parameters, including the comfort criterion and increased train mass due to the installation of energy storage devices, are all taken into account in the energy consumption calculation. In the optimization process, the total running time is only required to be adjusted in a predetermined range to guarantee transportation capacity and meet passenger travel demands. A dynamic programming based heuristic is designed with operational experiences and a series of numerical experiments are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness, corresponding to Beijing metro Yizhuang line.",

Based on the measurements of leaky waveguide, a model of CBTC radio channel with leaky waveguide is proposed in this letter. Our model shows that the large-scale fading is linear, and the path-loss exponent can be approximated by the transmission loss of leaky waveguide. The small-scale fading follows Log-normal distribution. In addition, the corresponding parameters of Log-normal distribution are also determined from the measurement results.",

The calculation of a reference trajectory seems more important, since it could improve the performance of ATO. The operation demands for MRT trains are different from freight trains, such as energy saving demand and the characteristic of traction. In this paper, based on the characteristic of traction and some results got by the former researchers, a new energy efficient strategy model is proposed by using nonlinear programming method. It is the first time to combine the analytical and numerical method together in this area. By applying the new method, it is unnecessary to pre-given any key value. Moreover, since it is easy to solve, it could be used in real-time operation adjustment. The feasibility and effectiveness are verified through simulation. Compared the simulation results with the actual operating data, our new method are efficient on energy saving with the guarantee of punctuality. \u00a9 2012 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Given rising energy prices and environmental concerns, train energy-efficient operation techniques are paid more attention as one of the effective methods to reduce operation costs and energy consumption. Generally speaking, the energy-efficient operation technique includes two levels, which optimize the timetable and the speed profiles among successive stations, respectively. To achieve better performance, this paper proposes to optimize the integrated timetable, which includes both the timetable and the speed profiles. First, we provide an analytical formulation to calculate the optimal speed profile with fixed trip time for each section. Second, we design a numerical algorithm to distribute the total trip time among different sections and prove the optimality of the distribution algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the algorithm to generate the integrated timetable. Finally, we present some numerical examples based on the operation data from the Beijing Yizhuang subway line. The simulation results show that energy reduction for the entire route is 14.5%. The computation time for finding the optimal solution is 0.15 s, which implies that the algorithm is fast enough to be used in the automatic train operation (ATO) system for real-time control.",

However, in rail transit systems, frequent train handoffs can cause severe communication latency. In this paper, we propose a handoff scheme in CBTC systems based on WLANs with multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) technologies to improve the handoff latency performance. Particularly, we consider channel estimation errors and the tradeoff between MIMO multiplexing gain and diversity gain in making handoff decisions. The handoff problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and the optimal handoff policy can be derived to minimize the handoff latency. Simulations results based on real field channel measurements are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "Energy-efficient train operation represents an important issue for daily operational urban rail transit. Most energy-efficient train operation strategies are normally planned according to a timetable, which is designed by offline traffic information. In this paper, a new energy-efficient train operation model based on real-time traffic information is proposed from the geometric and topographic points of view through a nonlinear programming method, leading to an energy-efficient driving strategy with real-time interstation running time monitored by the automatic train supervision system. The novelty of this work lies not only in the establishment of a new model for energy-efficient train operation but also in the utilization of combining analytical and numerical methods for deriving energy-efficient train operation strategies. More specifically, the energy-efficient operation model is built based on trajectory analysis when the energy-efficient optimal controls are applied, from which an energy-efficient reference trajectory is obtained under the running time and distance constraints, in which the nonlinear programming method is utilized. In contrast to most existing methods, the proposed model turns out to be a small-scale problem, and the difficulties of solving partial differential equations or the process of predetermining and reiteratively calculating some key factors as traditionally involved are avoided. Thus, it is more feasible to implement the strategy and easier to make real-time adjustment if needed. The comparative analysis and the simulation verification with the actual operating data confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. With the proposed method, some delayed trains are able to maintain punctuality at the next station and sometimes even reducing energy consumption.",

        "abstract": "Communication-based train control (CBTC) is an automated control system for railways using data communications. CBTC systems have stringent communication latency requirements. For rail transit systems, wireless local area network (WLAN)-based CBTC is a popular approach due to the wide availability of commercial-off-the-shelf WLAN equipment. However, WLANs were not originally designed for high-speed environments with frequent handoffs, which may result in communication interrupt and long latency. In this paper, we propose a handoff scheme in CBTC systems based on WLANs with multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) technologies to improve the handoff latency performance. In particular, we consider channel estimation errors and the tradeoff between MIMO multiplexing gain and diversity gain in making handoff decisions. The handoff problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and the optimal handoff policy can be derived to minimize the handoff latency. Simulations results based on real field channel measurements are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "Energy efficiency is paid more and more attention in railway systems for reducing the cost of operation companies and emissions to the environment. In subway systems, the optimizations on timetable and driving strategy are two important and closely dependent parts of energy-efficient operations. The former regulates the fleet size and the trip time at interstations, and the latter determines the control sequences of traction and braking force during the trip. Most conventional research optimized the timetable and the driving strategy separately such that global optimality cannot be achieved. In this paper, we analyze the hierarchy of energy-efficient train operation and then propose an integrated algorithm to generate the globally optimal operation schedule, which can get better energy-saving performance. Within the criteria of meeting the passenger demand, the integrated energy-efficient algorithm can simultaneously obtain the optimal timetable and driving strategy for trains, which realizes the combination of the high-level transportation management and the low-level train operation control. The simulation results based on the Beijing Yizhuang Subway Line illustrate that the integrated algorithm can achieve a 24.0% energy reduction for one day, on average. In addition, the computation time is within 2 s, which is short enough to be applied for real-time control system.",

Therefore, it is meaningful to recognize these critical stations and put more human and material resources take care of them. Based on the real-world smart-card data, we propose an analysis method including four indicators to find the critical stations in the urban rail networks. A multi-agent based simulation and min-max normalization are developed to obtain the final importance degree for each station.

        "abstract": "Communication-based train control (CBTC) is gradually adopted in urban rail transit systems, as it can significantly enhance railway network efficiency, safety and capacity. Since CBTC systems are mostly deployed in underground tunnels and trains move in high speed, building a train-ground wireless communication system for CBTC is a challenging task. Modeling the tunnel channels is very important to design and evaluate the performance of CBTC systems. Most of existing works on channel modeling do not consider the unique characteristics in CBTC systems, such as high mobility speed, deterministic moving direction, and accurate train location information. In this paper, we develop a finite state Markov channel (FSMC) model for tunnel channels in CBTC systems. The proposed FSMC model is based on real field CBTC channel measurements obtained from a business operating subway line. Unlike most existing channel models, which are not related to specific locations, the proposed FSMC channel model takes train locations into account to have a more accurate channel model. The distance between the transmitter and the receiver is divided into intervals, and an FSMC model is applied in each interval. The accuracy of the proposed FSMC model is illustrated by the simulation results generated from the model and the real field measurement results. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "A communication-based train control (CBTC) system is an automated train control system that uses bidirectional train-ground communications to ensure the safe operation of rail vehicles. CBTC systems have stringent requirements for communication availability and latency. Due to unreliable wireless communications and frequent handoffs, existing CBTC systems can severely affect train control performance, train operation efficiency, and the utility of railways. In this paper, we use recent advances in coordinated multipoint transmission and reception (CoMP) to enhance the train control performance of CBTC systems. With CoMP, a train can communicate with a cluster of base stations (BSs) simultaneously, which is different from the current CBTC systems, where a train can only communicate with a single BS at any given time. In addition, unlike the existing works on CoMP, in this paper, the linear quadratic cost for the train control performance in CBTC systems is considered the performance measure. We jointly consider the BS cluster selection and handoff decision issues in CBTC systems. Moreover, in order to mitigate the impacts of communication latency on train control performance, we propose an optimal guidance trajectory calculation scheme in the train control procedure that takes full consideration of the tracking error caused by handoff latency. Simulation results show that train control performance can be substantially improved in our proposed CBTC system with CoMP.",

In this paper, we study the transmission delays in CBTC systems, analyze their impacts on the performances of CBTC systems, and propose a novel scheme to improve the performances of trains' control system in CBTC by mitigating the impacts. Unlike the existing works that only consider a single train, we consider a group of trains in CBTC systems to improve the CBTC performances. Extensive simulation results are presented. We show that the current adopted control scheme experiences obvious performance losses under transmission delays. By contrast, our proposed scheme is tolerant of transmission delays, and can significantly improve the CBTC performances. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

Since CBTC systems have high requirements for the train ground communications, modeling the leaky waveguide channels is very important to design the wireless networks and evaluate the performance of CBTC systems. In the letter, we develop a finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) model for leaky waveguide channels in CBTC systems based on real field channel measurements obtained from a business operating subway line. The proposed FSMC channel model takes train locations into account to have a more accurate channel model. The overall leaky waveguide is divided into intervals, and an FSMC model is applied in each interval. The accuracy of the proposed FSMC model is illustrated by the simulation results generated from the model and the real field measurement results.",

ETCS (European Train Control System), supported by the European Union and the European Industrials, has been finalized as the technical standard of train control systems in Europe after more than ten years effort. There is more than 71,500 kilometers of railway operation line in China, which includes conventional lines with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour, a dedicated passenger line with a speed of 250 kilometers per hour and the speed-raising lines with a speed of 160 kilometers per hour. A high speed line from Beijing to Shanghai with a speed of more than 300 kilometers per hour will be constructed in the next few years. Due to historical and technical reasons, there exist more than six kinds of railway signal systems for Chinese Railways. At present, there is no technical standard for Chinese train control systems. In order to ensure the safety and efficiency of train operation and to meet the requirements of modern technical development in railways, the concept of CTCS (Chinese Train Control System) was put forward in 2002 as the technical standard of Chinese train control systems by the Chinese Railway Ministry. In the paper, CTCS is introduced. Based on the present situation of Chinese train control systems and their development requirements, both in technical and management aspects, the frame of CTCS is described. The comparison between ETCS and CTCS is also made.",

        "abstract": "A communication-based train control (CBTC) system is an automated train control system using bidirectional train-ground communications to ensure the safe operation of rail vehicles. CBTC systems have stringent requirements for communication availability and latency. Most existing CBTC train-ground communication systems work in the infrastructure mode without train-train communications. Due to unreliable wireless communications and frequent handoffs, existing CBTC systems can severely affect train control performance, train operation efficiency, and the utility of the railway. In this paper, we use recent advances in cooperative relaying to enable train-train communications and, consequently, enhance the train control performance of CBTC systems. Trains act not only as end communication points but as relays for other trains as well. Unlike existing works on cooperative relaying, in this paper, linear quadratic cost for the train control performance in CBTC systems is considered as the performance measure. We jointly consider cooperative relaying and handoff decision issues in CBTC systems. Moreover, to mitigate the impacts of handoff latency on the train control performance, we propose an optimal guidance trajectory calculation scheme in the train control procedure that takes full consideration of the tracking error caused by handoff latency. Simulation results show that the train control performance can be substantially improved in our proposed CBTC system with cooperative relaying.",

In this paper, a multiple point mass with a single-coordinate dynamic model that reflects resistive and transient impacts is derived, and based on this, computationally inexpensive robust adaptive control designs with optimal task distribution for speed and position tracking are proposed under traction/braking nonlinearities and saturation limitations. It is shown that the proposed method is not only robust to external disturbances, aerodynamic resistance, mechanical resistance, and transient impacts but adaptive to unknown system parameters as well.

Most of previous works use traditional design criteria, such as network capacity and communication latency, in handoff designs. However, these designs do not necessarily benefit the train control performance. In this paper, we take an integrated design approach to jointly optimize handoff decisions and physical layer parameters to improve the train control performance in CBTC systems.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a framework of parallel control and management for high-speed railway systems (HRSs). First, based on multiagent modeling, an artificial HRS that is consistent with realistic operations of the actual HRS is constructed. Then, different kinds of computational experiments are performed on the artificial HRS, followed by analysis and synthesis with a case. Finally, through an interactive and parallel operation between the actual and artificial HRSs, a set of practical control and management strategies can be achieved for the actual HRS. With the primary objective of ensuring reliability and safety of HRSs, this study could enhance the quality of services and the integrated transportability with other existing modes of transportation systems to provide appropriate recommendations and strategies for forming an overall effective comprehensive transportation system.",

Most existing CBTC train-ground communication systems work in the infrastructure mode without train-train communications. Due to unreliable wireless communications and frequent handoff, existing CBTC systems can severely affect train control performance. In this paper, we use recent advances in cooperative relaying to enable train-train communications, and consequently enhance the train control performance of CBTC systems. Linear quadratic cost for the train control performance in CBTC systems is considered as the performance measure. We jointly consider cooperative relaying and handoff decision issues in CBTC systems. Moreover, in order to mitigate the impacts of handoff latency on the train control performance, we propose an optimal guidance trajectory calculation scheme that takes full consideration of the tracking error caused by handoff latency. Simulation result shows that the train control performance can be improved substantially in our proposed CBTC system.",

Random transmission delays and packet drops are inevitable in train-ground communication, which could result in unnecessary traction, brake or even emergency brake of trains, loss of line capacity and passenger satisfaction. In this paper, we study the random packet drops in CBTC systems, analyze their impact on the performances of CBTC systems, and propose a control scheme to improve CBTC performances. We model the system to control a group of trains as a networked control system with packet drops in transmissions. Extensive simulation results are presented.

        "abstract": "In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), some distinct characteristics, such as high node mobility, introduce new non-trivial challenges to quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning. Although some excellent works have been done on QoS issues in VANETs, security issues are largely ignored in these works. However, it is know that security always comes at a price in terms of QoS performance degradation. In this article, we consider security and QoS issues jointly for VANETs with cooperative communications. We take an integrated approach of optimizing both security and QoS parameters, and study the tradeoffs between them in VANETs. Specifically, we use recent advances in cooperative communication to enhance the QoS performance of VANETs. In addition, we present a prevention-based security technique that provides both hop-by-hop and end-to-end authentication and integrity protection. We derive the closed-form effective secure throughput considering both security and QoS provisioning in VANETs with cooperative communications. The system is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process. Simulation results are presented to show that security schemes have significant impacts on the throughput QoS of VANETs, and our proposed scheme can substantially improve the effective secure throughput of VANETs with cooperative communications. \u00a9 2013 Zhu et al.",

        "abstract": "The impact of resistance forces on train operation performance becomes increasingly significant as the train speed increases, thus should be explicitly addressed in developing control schemes for high speed train systems. This paper presents a smooth VSC approach for automatic train speed and position tracking control under varying operation conditions. In contrast to most existing methods that either assume the availability of resistance forces for feedback control design, or consider constant resistance coefficients, we consider the case that the basic resistance forces and additional resistance forces are both time-varying and unknown. A smooth VSC method is proposed to achieve high precision position and velocity tracking. The fundamental idea behind this method is to directly design the control rate, instead of the control action itself, thus the chattering problem in most existing VSC methods is removed because the integration of the control rate smoothens the control action.",

In this scheme, integrity assurance strategies are combined with a three-stage hierarchical\n architecture, considering the coupling effects among sensor collection, sensor fusion and matching decision level in train\n integrated positioning. In sensor collecting stage, the AIMA scheme deals with sensor faults and failures with a PCA-based\n fault detection, diagnosis and isolation approach. In multi-sensor fusion stage, a novel cubature point H\u221e filter is presented to enhance the fault tolerance capability, and a hybrid approach is applied to indicating and monitoring\n the protection level of position estimation, concerning both the estimating covariance and measurement slopes. In map matching\n stage, hypothesis testing with specific test statistic is carried out to determine effectiveness of positioning results. Position\n calculation will be invalid with an alarm triggered if the specific integrity criterion is not satisfied in any stage. Since\n independent solutions are applied in AIMA, integrity assurance is closely coupled with information processing in train integrated\n positioning. Numerical results of the three cases correspond to the hierarchical architecture with field data and simulations\n are presented to illustrate features and applicability of the proposed AIMA scheme and specific solutions.",

        "abstract": "For urban metro systems with platform screen doors, train automatic stop control (TASC) has recently attracted significant attention from both industry and academia. Existing solutions to TASC are challenged by uncertain stopping errors and the fast decrease in service life of braking systems. In this paper, we try to solve the TASC problem using a new machine learning technique and propose a novel online learning control strategy with the help of the precise location data of balises installed at stations. By modeling and analysis, we find that the learning-based TASC is a challenging problem, having characteristics of small sample sizes and online learning. We then propose three algorithms for TASC by referring to heuristics, gradient descent, and reinforcement learning (RL), which are called heuristic online learning algorithm (HOA), gradient-descent-based online learning algorithm (GOA), and RL-based online learning algorithm (RLA), respectively. We also perform an extensive comparison study on a real-world data set collected in the Beijing subway. Our experimental results show that our approaches control all stopping errors in the range of $\\\\pm$0.30 m under various disturbances. In addition, our approaches can greatly increase the service life of braking systems by only changing the deceleration rate a few times, which is similar to experienced drivers. Among the three algorithms, RLA achieves the best results, and GOA is a little better than HOA. As online learning algorithms can dynamically reduce stopping errors by using the precise location data from balises, it is a promising technique in solving real-world problems.",

A real-time headway control model is proposed to maintain headway regularity at bottlenecks in railway network by adjusting the travel time on each segment for each train. The adjustment of travel time is based on a consensus algorithm. In the proposed consensus algorithm, the control law is obtained by solving Ricatti equation. The minimum running time on segment is also considered. The computation time of the proposed method is analyzed and the analysis result shows that it can satisfy the requirement on real-time. The proposed model is tested and the consensus trend of headways can be observed through simulation. The simulation results also demonstrate that energy consumption canbe reduced by 0.1% at most and the delay time is reduced by 6.5% at least after using the proposed method.",

Traditional studies show that the optimal speed profile consists of four phases including maximum acceleration, cruising, coasting and maximum braking. Based on the assumption that the resistance coefficients are random variables as the disturbances arising from the weather and locomotive conditions, this paper proposes a stochastic train energy-efficient operation model, and proves that the coasting phase should be replaced by a quasicoasting phase for the optimal speed profile. An efficient iterative algorithm is designed to solve the optimal switching strategy among different phases, and a numerical example is illustrated to show that the stochastic optimization approach can further save energy by 3:68% compared with the traditional studies. \u00a9 2013 ICIC International.",

        "abstract": "As there are huge amounts of Global Positioning System (GPS) data points measured in the Qinghai-Tibet Railway (QTR) with a length of 1142km, it was inevitable that some measuring errors existed due to various situations in measurement. It is very important to develop a method to automatically detect the possible errors in all data points so as to modify them or measure them again to improve the reliability of GPS data. Four error patterns, including redundant measurement, sparse measurement, back-and-forth measurement, and big angle change, were obtained based on expert knowledge. Based on the four error patterns, four algorithms were developed to detect the corresponding possible errors in data points. To delete the repetitive errors by different algorithms and effectively display the possible errors, an integrated error-detecting method was developed by reasonably assembling the four algorithms. After four performance indices were given to evaluate the performance of the error-detecting method, six GPS track data sets between seven railway stations in the QTR were used to validate the method. Thirty-eight segments of some sequential points that are possibly wrong were found by the method and fourteen of them were confirmed by measurement experts. The detecting rate of the method was 100% and the duration time of the detecting process was less than half an hour compared with the 94h manual workload. The validation results show that the method is effective not only in decreasing workload, but also in ensuring correctness by integrating the domain expert knowledge to make the final decision.",

        "abstract": "Communication-based train control (CBTC) network is an automated control network for railways that ensures the safe operation of rail vehicles using data communications. CBTC networks have stringent requirements for communication availability and latency. Wireless local area network (WLAN) is a popular choice in CBTC networks due to the available commercial-off-the-shelf WLAN equipments. However, handoffs in WLANs may result in communication interruption and long latency in WLANs-based CBTC networks. In this article, we propose a handoff management scheme for CBTC networks using stream control transmission protocol (SCTP) and IEEE 802.11p WLANs to provide high communication availability and low latency in CBTC networks. We formulate the handoff decision problem as a stochastic Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) with the objectives of minimizing the handoff latency and maximizing the SCTP throughput. Simulation results are presented to show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the handoff performance in CBTC networks.",

Due to unreliable wireless communications and frequent handoff, existing CBTC systems can severely affect train control performance. In this paper, we use recent advances in Coordinated Multi-Point transmission and reception (CoMP) to enhance the train control performance of CBTC systems. In addition, unlike the exiting works on CoMP, linear quadratic cost for the train control performance in CBTC systems is considered as the performance measure. Moreover, we propose an optimal guidance trajectory calculation scheme in the train control procedure that takes full consideration of the tracking error caused by handoff latency.

In the MBS system, a dense queue of trains starting (or re-starting) in very close succession would cause an overload of the substations. The time delay and acceleration rate limit are introduced in the traditional approaches to solve this problem. However, such approaches increase the travel time between the successive stations, and the service quality decreases. In this paper, a novel approach 'Service Headway Braking' is proposed based on some knowable extra station dwell time. It can efficiently avoid the peak electrical demand problem without increasing the time delay. The simulation result shows that, with flexible adjustment of the start (or restart) time and velocity, the passenger waiting time can be shortened while considering energy saving. \u00a9 2010 WIT Press.",

In CBTC systems, less service availability could cause train derailment, collision or even catastrophic loss of lives or assets. Therefore, the availability of data communication should be carefully considered in designing CBTC systems. In this paper, we propose two WLAN-based data communication systems with redundancy in CBTC systems. The availability is analyzed using continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) model. We also model the WLAN-based data communication system behavior with Deterministic and Stochastic Petri Net (DSPN). The DSPN solution is used to show the soundness of our proposed CTMC model.

Handoff design has significant impacts on the train control performance in CBTC systems based on multi-input and multi-output (MIMO)-enabled WLANs. Most of previous works use traditional design criteria, such as network capacity and communication latency, in handoff designs. However, these designs do not necessarily benefit the train control performance. In this paper, we take an integrated design approach to jointly optimize handoff decisions and physical layer parameters to improve the train control performance in CBTC systems. We use linear quadratic cost for the train controller as the performance measure. The handoff decision and physical layer parameters adaptation problem is formulated as a stochastic control process.

Most of the independent train ground communication system are using IEEE 802.11 based WLAN technologies, which has many drawbacks when used in urban rail transit system, such as high speed performance degradation, open free frequency, etc. In this paper, we design a train ground communication system for Integrated Service in urban rail transit/metro system using LTE technology (LTE-M). Dedicated frequency spectrum is used in the LTE-M based system. The real LTE-M based system is built on the ring rail line in Beijing to perform the field test. The performance of the integrated services including the CBTC, PIS, IMS and TOSM (Train Operation State Monitoring) are tested. Extensive test results show the advantages of LTE-M. The test results analysis also illustrates the disadvantages of using LTE-M in urban rail, and gives some advises for LTE-M based system design in engineering.",

        "abstract": "In existing urban rail transit systems, the train-ground communication system for different subsystems is deployed independently. Investing and constructing the communication infrastructures repeatedly not only wastes substantial social resources, but it also is difficult to maintain all these infrastructures. In this paper, we propose an integrated train-ground communication system based on wireless network virtualization for urban rail transit systems. In order to improve the communication-based train control (CBTC) subsystem performance during handoff, we propose a novel handoff scheme to support handoff between virtual networks. The application-layer quality-of-service (QoS) parameters of the CBTC, passenger information system, and closed circuit television subsystems are used as the performance measures in the handoff design. We then formulate the QoS optimization problem in the proposed integrated train-ground communication system as an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) problem. The extensive simulation results show that the proposed integrated train-ground communication system QoS can be improved substantially with our ADP-based optimization model.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing passenger demand, urban rail transit systems are operated with high frequency train services. Due to the uneven distribution of the passenger flows, only operating full-length train services from the origin station to the destination station is not sufficient, especially for the central business district (CBD) areas during peak hours, where the load factors of train services could reach 100% or even 120%. Meanwhile, only operating full-length train services could result in the lack of rolling stocks because of the long cycling time. The short turning strategy can be adopted to enhance the passengersu0027 satisfaction and reducing their waiting time. In this paper, we proposed a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to obtain train schedules with full-length and short turning train services to satisfy the service frequencies obtained by the passenger demand analysis. The MILP problems can be efficiently solved by existing solvers, e.g. CPLEX. A case study is carried out based on the data of the Beijing Yizhuang line to assess the performance of the train schedule with short turning strategy.",

The real data on train operation are used for training and testing the predictive algorithms. The feasibility of these algorithms is validated. A comparison between these algorithms is given.

The time-variant quantities are adopted to represent the dynamic passenger demands, with which passenger boarding, alighting and transferring process are taken into consideration for calculating total travel time and variation of in-service train mass. To effectively measure the total energy consumption, three parts of energy consumption are specified, including traction energy consumption, auxiliary energy consumption and usage of regenerative energy. In particular, the regenerative energy is allowable to simultaneously reuse by traction trains on the same line or in supply regions of different lines nearby the same transfer station. A compromise for service quality and energy consumption from the viewpoint of system optimization is especially proposed through adjusting headways in different lines. To effectively solve the proposed model, a tabu search algorithm is designed to obtain near-optimal timetables of the whole transit network. With the practical data of Line 5, Line 10 and Yizhuang Line in Beijing rail transit network, the effectiveness of this model and solution method is demonstrated by a series of numerical experiments.",

        "abstract": "In urban rail transit systems, train scheduling plays an important role in improving the transport capacity to alleviate the urban traffic pressure of huge passenger demand and reducing the operation costs for operators. This paper considers the train scheduling with short turning strategy for an urban rail transit line with multiple depots. In addition, the utilization of trains is also taken into consideration. First, we develop a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for the train scheduling, where short turning train services and full-length train services are optimized based on the predefined headway obtained by the passenger demand analysis. The MINLP model is then transformed into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model according to several transformation properties. The resulting MILP problem can be solved efficiently by existing solvers, e.g., CPLEX. Two case studies with different scales are constructed to assess the performance of train schedules with the short turning strategy based on the data of Beijing Subway line 4. The simulation results show that the reduction of the utilization of trains is about 20.69%.",

        "abstract": "Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) is currently used in the train-ground communication for the urban rail transit systems. Due to the high speed and limited frequency band, WLAN cannot satisfy the demands of city and intercity rail transit in the future. Time Division-Long Term Evolution (TD-LTE) technology allows to construct a flexible service environment compared with current WLAN based system. But with the development of the urban rail transit, the requirements of train-ground communication are increasing rapidly. So, if there are more than two trains running in the same RRU coverage area at the same time, the throughput capability is hard to satisfy the total requirements of the trains. In this paper, we first calculate the real throughput which includes no overhead. Then, a novel dual-association model based on TD-LTE is given. The novel model takes advantage of the fact that users can be associated with more than one RRU at the same time. The coverage diameter of single RRU, the overlap area of two neighbor RRUs and the headway distance are also considered in the novel model synthetically. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the novel dual-association which can decrease the stress of the serving RRU obviously.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   We study the integration of train scheduling and rolling stock circulation planning under time-varying passenger demand for an urban rail transit line, where the practical train operation constraints, e.g., the capacity of trains, the number of available rolling stocks, and the entering/exiting depot operations, are considered. Three solution approaches are proposed to solve the resulting multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to deliver both an irregular train schedule (i.e., departure and arrival times of all train services) and a rolling stock circulation plan (including entering/exiting depot operations of rolling stocks and connections between train services) simultaneously. We first present an iterative nonlinear programming (INP) approach, where the solutions of the original MINLP problem are obtained by solving a nonlinear programming problem and a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem iteratively. Moreover, an equivalent MILP formulation of the original MINLP model is developed and an approximated MILP approach is proposed to reduce the number of constraints introduced by passenger demand. A case study is conducted based on the practical data of the Beijing Yizhuang line, where the three proposed approaches are compared with a state-of-the-art approach and a practical method used by the traffic planners. This comparison shows the effectiveness and efficiency of the three proposed approaches.",

The transmission loss and train length are taken into account when calculating voltage of contact line and resistance force with equivalent slope. Considering the influence of voltage and slope variation on control performance, we propose original model original control with fixed voltage (OMOC-FV) and original model original control with slope (OMOC-S) to compare with the most commonly used PI control method, i.e., modified model original control (MMOC). Moreover, focusing on variable parameters and complex dynamics of induction motor, a fuzzy predictive control method, called modified model modified control (MMMC), is proposed to track the target speed profile accurately and to achieve the voltage stability. The effectiveness of elaborate model and the performance of MMMC are evaluated based on the data of Beijing Yizhuang line.",

The highlight of the error-driven nonlinear feedback technique is that the feedback gain self-regulates versus different levels of output and virtual tracking errors, this reflects the classical control design criterions commendably: relatively high feedback gains can be implemented to guarantee disturbances and uncertainties attenuation and so on to improve the control performance when small tracking errors are measured, and relatively small feedback gains can be implemented to circumvent the problems of actuator and states saturations when large tracking errors are measured. The complexity problem of the traditional backstepping design is circumvented owe to the peculiarity of DSC method. Caused by the compound error functions of nonlinear feedback dynamics, a nonquadratic Lyapunov function is used to deduce the conditions of closed-loop stability. Fuzzy logic systems and error transformation-based method are used in the online learning of completely unknown dynamics and the prescribed performance tracking, respectively. Comparative results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and preponderance of the proposed control scheme with comparison to existing ones.",

        "abstract": "Although the high-speed railways in China have been greatly advanced in the past decades with respect to expanding networks and increasing speed, a fixed block system, which separates the trains with several stationary track block sections, is utilized to guarantee the safe operation of multiple trains. A moving block system, which enables the moving authority of a high-speed train to be the real-time positioning point of its preceding one (plus some necessary safe redundant distance, of course), is under development to further make full use of the high-speed railway lines and improve the automation level by automatic train operation for high-speed trains. The aim of this paper is to design a distributed cooperative control for high-speed trains under a moving block system by giving a cooperative model with a back-fence communication topology. A nonlinear mapping-based feedback control method together with a rigorous mathematic proof for the global stability and ultimate bound of the closed-loop control systems is proposed. Comparative results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Due to rising energy prices and environmental concerns, the energy efficiency of urban rail transit has attracted much attention from both researchers and practitioners in recent years. Timetable optimization and energy-efficient driving, as two mainly used train operation methods in relation to the tractive energy saving, make major contributions in reducing the energy consumption that has been studied for a long time. Generally speaking, timetable optimization synchronizes the accelerating and braking actions of trains to maximize the utilization of regenerative energy, and energy-efficient driving optimizes the speed profile at each section to minimize the tractive energy consumption. In this paper, we present a fully comprehensive survey on energy-efficient train operation for urban rail transit. First, a general energy consumption distribution of urban rail trains is described. Second, the current literature on timetable optimization and energy-efficient driving is reviewed. Finally, according to the review work, it is concluded that the integrated optimization method jointly optimizing the timetable and speed profile has become a new tendency and ought to be paid more attention in future research.",

        "abstract": "This paper formulates a two-objective model to optimize the timetables of urban rail transit systems based on energy-saving strategies and service quality levels. With time-dependent passenger demands, the calculation process of passenger travel time simulates boarding and alighting activities with some constraints to guarantee traffic capacity and meet passenger requirements, particularly in the oversaturated conditions. Traction and auxiliary energy consumption are considered in the operational energy consumption calculation. The regenerative energy, which is generated from braking trains and simultaneously used by traction trains, is also taken into account in the calculation with transmission loss. Through adjusting the headway, this model makes a tradeoff between passenger travel time and operational energy consumption with guaranteed traffic capability. Furthermore, a genetic algorithm with the binary encoding method is designed to obtain high-quality timetables. Based on the operational data of the Beijing Yizhuang subway line, we implement some numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.",

In this paper, with recent advances in wireless network virtualization, we design an integrated train-ground communication system for different urban rail transit applications, including communication-based train control systems, passenger information systems, and closed-circuit television systems. A prevention-based security scheme is used in the integrated train-ground communication system. With the objective to optimize the system quality of service (QoS) and improve the system security performance, we formulate the QoS and security problem as a Q-Learning problem. Extensive simulation results show that the system QoS and security performance can be improved substantially in the proposed integrated train-ground communication system.",

In the steep downhill section, the speed will continue to rise when the trains do not apply traction due to the ramp force. In order to make better use of the steep downhill section and reduce the energy consumption of the train, this paper presents an approach for studying the energy-efficient driving strategy of trains running in the steep downhill section. For a given line condition, the steep downhill section in the line is identified firstly, and a method of calculating the driving strategy of this section is proposed without changing the running time of this section. Furthermore, the gradient descent method is integrated to solve the optimal cruising speed corresponding to the minimum traction energy consumption of the train. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by comparing the energy-saving effect with the classical energy-efficient driving strategy of \u201cMaximum traction-Cruising-Coasting-Maximum braking\u201d.",

Traction energy between train stations is determined by the driving strategy of the train, therefore, studying energy-efficient train driving strategy to reduce traction energy consumption has a great significance to achieve an environmentally friendly transport system. This paper designs a simulation software of energy-efficient train driving strategy based on the numerical algorithm to optimize energy-efficient train driving strategy with energy allocation.

Headway irregularity will decrease the rail traffic systems performances (e.g., line capacity, passengers waiting time, et al), which result from external disturbances (e.g., weather condition, passengers reasons). This paper proposes a real-time dynamical headway adjustment algorithm. By using artificial potential function, trains with different position can gain various potential fields. In this field, each train is attracted or repelled by other trains. Train speed and headway can converge to expected target point under the potential function.

To enhance the safety integrity level of safety computer platform, safety-related logics have to be verified before integrating them into practical systems.

In actual operation, several balises are mounted on the track to enhance the parking accuracy by providing exact positioning data for the train. Currently, the number and positions of the balises are determined by experience and iterative experiments that may greatly increase the costs. Combining expert knowledge and train dynamics, this paper formulates a balise arrangement optimization (BAO) model to study the relationship between the number u0026 locations of balises and parking errors. The resistances, nonlinearity and time delay in train braking system and variable initial speeds that a train enters the parking area are considered in the formulation of BAO model. Moreover, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the BAO model and present numerical experiments based on field data collected from Beijing Subway Yizhuang Line. The results indicate that the BAO model can enhance the parking accuracy to about 0.10\u2009m via changing the positions of the balises. Furthermore, we found that: (1) more balises lead to better performance of train parking accuracy; (2) four or five balises are appropriate for balancing the device cost and parking errors.",

Therefore, the optimization of recommended speed profile and the tracking strategy are regarded as two important means to achieve energy-efficient train operation between the successive stations. With considering the ATO tracking strategy, an optimization method of the recommended speed profile is proposed in this paper. Base on the approximate calculation, a discrete combination optimization model is formulated and a new MAX-MIN ant system (MMAS) is taken as the core algorithm. With the fixed speed tracking strategy, this method achieves the recommended speed profile with optimized energy consumption and a perfect running punctuality along the actual tracked trajectory. The switching times of operation during the cruising phase is reduced by integrating the driversu0027 experience, which also reduces the energy consumption of train running between stations.

The insights into the potential correlation between safety and system variation are crucial for safe and effective operation management in the automatic metro. Thus, this paper propose a system dynamics (SD)-based model to construct the operational feedback mechanisms of the automatic metro through investigation, interview, and empirical analysis of the Beijing and Shanghai metro systems, covering the aspects of organization resource assignment, organizational experience and avoidance of driver error. From the model, the variation trend of the dynamic processes can be used to analyse the key elements or variables over time. Three key factors (the safety policy, delay time for organizational experience, and resource assignment coefficient), are identified to evaluate the crucial linkage between safety and variation over time. The changing trend of system risk influenced by the combination of these three factors is further analysed to demonstrate how the functionalities of organization should be synchronized with the transformation of different grades of automation. The paper specifies an explicit framework that recognizes the relationships among the automation degree, organization policy and system risk at the macro level and comprehensively reveals the adaptation process of organization corresponding to the revolution process of the automation degree of the metro.",

        "abstract": "With the enhancement of informatization and automation, the capacity and efficiency of CBTC systems are increasing. However, the wide application of information technologies brings serious security threats on CBTC systems. Due to inherent characteristics of railway services, obtaining the security situation of CBTC systems is necessary. The methodlogy in this paper to evaluate the vulnerability of systems adopts attack tree modelling based on the functional architecture of CBTC systems. Assessments cover the current security states, port auditing, password policies and communication protocols of systems with the advantages of simplicity and operability. Based on the attack tree, leaf vulnerability, scenario vulnerability and system vulnerability are defined. During this assessment process, a typical scan tool, Nessus, and a vulnerability scoring system, CVSS, are used to achieve the port auditing. Moreover, a method to calculate the password strength and a piecewise linear function to normalize password strength are proposed. In the end, this approach is applied to a CBTC test-bed, and the assessment results show the difference of the vulnerability between the system with or without the improved countermeasures.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTDue to the increasing energy prices and environmental issues, energy conservation for metro trains has become an important research topic in recent years. The static timetable optimization approach can reduce the trains\u2019 energy consumption to a certain degree by scheduling multiple trains\u2019 movements. However, this optimization approach is prone to fail when one or some trains are delayed at stations. This paper develops an energy-efficient rescheduling approach under delay perturbations for metro trains, which aims to minimize the net energy consumption under the premise of reducing or eliminating the delay altogether. Firstly, we provide an illustrative example to describe the rescheduling problem. Furthermore, we formulate an integer programming model and design an allocation algorithm to obtain the optimal schedule. Finally, a numerical example based on the Beijing Metro Yizhuang Line shows that the developed approach can reduce the net energy consumption by 8.19% in comparison with the traditi...",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the robust automatic train regulation problem in high-frequency metro lines with fuzzy passenger arrival rate. Due to the uncertainty of passenger demand, the passenger arrival rate is assumed to be represented by fuzzy variables. A nonlinear state-space model is formulated to describe the characteristic of metro train operation. To satisfy the real-time requirement of train regulation, a fuzzy constrained predictive control approach is designed to optimize a cost function at each decision epoch subject to safety constraints on the control input. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory and model predictive control method, sufficient conditions for the existence of corresponding state feedback control law are given in a set of linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, for reducing delays caused by the uncertain disturbance, the robust train regulation strategy is designed to guarantee that the practical train timetable tracks the nominal one with respect to certain disturbance attenuation level. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by a number of experiments under real running circumstances of Beijing Metro Yizhuang Line of China.",

However, there is no available method for dispatcher group in Operating Control Center (OCC) to evaluate the decision under emergency situation. It was found that the emergency decision making in UTO metro system is relative with the preferences and the importance of multi-dispatcher in emergency. Regarding these factors, this paper presents a hybrid method to determinate the priority weights of emergency alternatives, which aggregates the preference matrix by constructing the emergency response task model based on the Weighted Ordered Weighted Averaging (WOWA) operator. This calculation approach derives the importance weights depending on the dispatcher emergency tasks and integrates it into the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator weights based on a fuzzy membership relation. A case from train fire is given to demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed methods for Group Multi-Criteria Decision Making (GMCDM) in emergency management of UTO metro system. The innovation of this research is paving the way for a systematic emergency decision-making solution which connects the automatic metro emergency response system with the GMCDM theory.",

As technology advances in railway systems, one theoretically challenging and practically significant problem is how to use the ATO system to make the current railway network more efficient with higher carrying capacity, lower cost and improved quality of service by optimized railway traffic management and train operation. In this review, we focus on this emerging technology of automatic train operation (ATO) for its theoretical development and practical implementations. Specifically, this study first presents the background of ATO technology in railways, which involves the detailed description of its development and implementation in urban metro systems, fundamental features and basic structure of a typical ATO system. Then, we present a comprehensive literature review in this area, in which the current studies are generally classified into three main aspects, i.e., train operation modeling techniques, train trajectory optimization and train speed control methods. Finally, the emerging requirements for current ATO systems and the most promising research directions in this area in the future are discussed explicitly, including (i) the practical implementation of ATO in main line and high-speed railways, (ii) the cooperative train operation methods for energy-saving issues and (iii) the integration of railway traffic control with advanced ATO technology.",

Finally, an adaptive controller is designed by using the iterative learning method. The speed curve tracking control is carried out during the train running, and the parking start position can be determined according to the current speed and displacement, so as to obtain more accurate parking results.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method to measure the capacity of single-track railway corridors subject to a given degree of balance between the two directional traffic loads and a permitted overall delay level. We introduce the concepts of \u03b4-balance degree and \u03bb-tolerance level to reflect the subjective measures of the railway administrator for capacity evaluation. A train balance scheduling problem with initial departure time choice of trains is embedded into the measure of railway capacity. The combined scheduling and capacity evaluation method is formulated as a 0-1 mixed integer programming model, and solved using a simple dichotomization-based heuristic method. A highly efficient heuristic procedure based on the concept of compaction pattern is developed to solve the train balance scheduling problem, and the numerical results demonstrate that the method yields high-quality solutions close to the optimal ones using the CPLEX solver. The two-way traffic loading capacity of a single-track railway corridor is analyzed in detail under different tolerance levels and balance degrees. The transition regions of traffic loading capacity are identified, and provide a useful decision support tool for the railway administrators in dealing with train rescheduling requests under disturbance or disruption scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Traditionally, accident or incident analysis are focusing on the cause-consequence chain methods, like Fault Tree or Event Tree, which are hard to find root cause of accidents. To solve this problem, some system safety analysis methods come out, like Accimap, FRAM and CAST based on STAMP. However, they are good at solving safety management issues, functional failure analysis or causal scenarios analysis, and can be used to capture safety requirements and help system designers to deep understand safety requirements. But the true logic of accident or incident do not analyzed, which is related to human or equipment cannot conceive the right status of train operational status on time. If so, it's easy to ensure safety by train stop. The objective of this paper is to present the mismatch or inconsistency among human cognition, equipment execution and train operation of railway train control system. Also, railway accident is a kind of expression of operational scenario conflict. Singapore metro accident is analyzed as case study.",

The aim is to evaluate the carrying capacity of the three-line rail traffic by studying the rail traffic flow when the passenger flow is unsymmetrical. The simulation results demonstrate that under the unsymmetrical condition, the three-line rail traffic system has almost the same carrying capacity as that of a four-line rail traffic system. Compared with the four-line rail traffic system, the three-line rail traffic system has better utilization of rail line. As a result, building the three-line rail traffic system is a more economical and rational selection.",

        "abstract": "Train control systems like most digital controllers are, by definition, hybrid systems as they interact with or try to control some aspects of the physical world. Detailed behavior modeling with constraints specification and formal verification, required for reliability prediction, is a great challenge for hybrid system designers. Train control systems further intensify this challenge with extensive interaction between computing units and their physical environment and their mutual dependence on each other. In this paper, we investigate behavior modeling and formal verification of Chinese Train Control System Level 3 (CTCS-3) using Architectural Analysis & Design Language (AADL) to cope with this challenge. AADL is an architecture description language for embedded systems and is based on model-based engineering paradigm. Along with structural modeling of embedded systems using the core language constructs, AADL also provides support for language extension through annex sublanguages. In system requirements specification document, the behavior of the CTCS-3 is specified as a set of basic operation scenarios that cooperate with each other to achieve safe and secure functionality of trains. Movement Authority (MA) scenario, explored in this paper, is considered as a basic and most crucial scenario to prevent trains from colliding with each other. The detailed discrete behavior of control system is modeled and verified using the Behavior Language for Embedded Systems with Software (BLESS) annex sublanguage of AADL, and the continuous behavior of train with the cyber\u2013physical interaction (communication between train and control system) is modeled using the Hybrid annex sublanguage. The behavior of the MA scenario at system level is verified using the Hybrid Hoare Logic theorem prover. Behavior constraints are specified as assertions using first-order logic formulas augmented with a simple temporal operator.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Railway turnout systems are one of the most critical elements in railway infrastructure. They are also one of the most vulnerable assets that are likely to be affected by the adverse weather. Therefore, effective methods for modeling weather-related failure of turnouts enable railway administrations to make optimal maintenance decisions. This paper presents a failure prediction model based on Bayesian network to evaluate the effect of weather on railway turnouts. Different failure causes related to weather are extracted as model variables. An Entropy Minimization based method is presented to discretize model variables for the purpose of reducing the input type and capturing better performance. By taking advantage of the independence of causal interactions, a causal noisy MAX model is applied to boost the efficiency of specifying the conditional probability table from small data sets. Prediction accuracy of the proposed method is compared to other advanced methods in order to evaluate the model\u2019s performance. Our experiments by using the data from a railway corporation demonstrate that the proposed method has high prediction accuracy.",

        "abstract": "A vast amount of text data is recorded in the forms of repair verbatim in railway maintenance sectors. Efficient text mining of such maintenance data plays an important role in detecting anomalies and improving fault diagnosis efficiency. However, unstructured verbatim, high-dimensional data, and imbalanced fault class distribution pose challenges for feature selections and fault diagnosis. We propose a bilevel feature extraction-based text mining that integrates features extracted at both syntax and semantic levels with the aim to improve the fault classification performance. We first perform an improved $\\\\chi^{2}$ statistics-based feature selection at the syntax level to overcome the learning difficulty caused by an imbalanced data set. Then, we perform a prior latent Dirichlet allocation-based feature selection at the semantic level to reduce the data set into a low-dimensional topic space. Finally, we fuse fault features derived from both syntax and semantic levels via serial fusion. The proposed method uses fault features at different levels and enhances the precision of fault diagnosis for all fault classes, particularly minority ones. Its performance has been validated by using a railway maintenance data set collected from 2008 to 2014 by a railway corporation. It outperforms traditional approaches.",

The railway operator in Beijing, the Beijing Subway, is no exception. In order to improve the train operation to meet the capacity demand, the Beijing Subway is interested in understanding how the communication delay of the train-ground wireless communication system affects the headway. Appropriate evaluation methods are needed for this purpose. Therefore, in this paper, we firstly analyzed the impact of the wireless communication delay on train safety envelope. Then, the constraint relationship between the communication delay and the train speed is deduced according to the wireless communication theory and the IEEE 802.11 protocol, Rayleigh distribution is introduced to the relationship to describe the stochastic characteristics of communication delay. In addition, based on moving block headway calculation method, an analytical model combining the headway evaluation and the communication delay is derived subject to the train safety envelope. Simulation results show the difference of the headway between ideal situation and communication delay situation and the relationship between the headway and the train maximum speed under the condition of different communication delays, the conclusions can be used for the train headway optimization, the train safety operation and the transportation efficiency improvement in the similar environments.",

CBTC is the direction of future train control systems. Complex channel condition and frequent handoff can severely affect urban rail CBTC train-ground communication performance, and consequently affect CBTC operation efficiency. Current research regarding CBTC does not consider the impact of train-ground communications on train control performance. This paper studies the joint optimization of communication and control in CBTC systems. With the objective to minimize the optimal operation profile tracking error and energy consumption, linear quadratic cost is defined as the control performance measure. In order to ensure train operation safety, the optimization model puts constraints on train control actions related to safety. Moreover, based on the stochastic channel characteristics and the real-time train position information, handoff decision and train control policy are jointly optimized using deep reinforcement learning. Extensive simulation results based on real-field channel measurements illustrate that the proposed optimization method can significantly improve the train control performance in CBTC systems, and CBTC systems need to sacrifice part of performance to ensure system safety.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Compared with high speed trains and metro subways, heavy haul train operations are more challenging for their complex dynamic characteristics and complicated running environments. When running on a continuous and steep descent, the air brake operation strategy has become the most important issue for the safety and efficiency of heavy haul train transportation. Due to the difficulty in modeling the train\u2019s dynamics and pneumatic brake system precisely, this paper addresses the intelligent driving problem for heavy haul train based on the fusion of expert knowledge and machine learning methodologies. By considering the characteristics of manual driving on steep descent, the pneumatic brake operation problem is formulated as a multi-class classification model. To overcome the negative influences of data imbalances, EasyEnsemble for the multi-class with a KNN based Denoising (EMKD) algorithm is introduced to determine the feasible Air Pressure Reduction (APR) and the exact time for exerting and releasing the air brake. This approach utilizes the EasyEnsemble.M algorithm to moderate the class imbalanced datasets and takes advantage of the AdaBoost.M1 algorithm to ensemble weak classifiers. Specifically, the K-nearest neighbor based Denoising (KD) algorithm is elaborated to remove the possible noise data from the minority dataset. Additionally, expert knowledge is obtained by abstracting the experience of sophisticated drivers and technical specifications, which are employed as operating constraints to regulate the output of the EMKD algorithm. The operational safety in terms of the in-train forces and punctuality of the proposed algorithm are validated by a number of experiments under the real running circumstances of Shuohuang heavy haul railway.",

The concept of resilience is introduced to reflect the change of system capacity in case of failure and defined as the ability of system to maintain capacity in degraded mode and recover from disruptions.

By comparison, the train tracking interval is selected as the performance index. With the index, resilience in different disruption scenarios are measured, the results show system resilience is closely related to fault types.

Runtime verification is able to provide on-going protection during the operational phase. Unfortunately, as being a variantrich system, it is hard to build monitors for CBI with standard runtime verification frameworks. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose parametric timed automata (PTA) to build feature models for the system. We prove that the language of PTA has more expressive power than timed automata. Based on PTA, we build monitors for a concrete CBI used in Beijing Metro Line 7. The experiment results show that complicated variant-rich CBI systems can be specified with a unique PTA feature model, and monitors can be quickly derived from the model by assign values to parameters. Therefore, this approach is feasible for monitoring CBI systems.",

High intelligence and efficiency are the goals of its development. Aiming at reducing the complexity of the system, this paper proposes a novel train-centric CBTC (TcCBTC) solution. Firstly, to find out the existing problems of traditional CBTC system, the structural complexity and functional complexity are quantitatively analyzed by using information entropy method.

        "abstract": "In a heavily congested metro line, unexpected disturbances often occur to cause the delay of the traveling passengers, infeasibility of the current timetable and reduction of the operational efficiency. Due to the uncertain and dynamic characteristics of passenger demands, the commonly used method to recover from disturbances in practice is to change the timetable and rolling stock manually based on the experiences and professional judgements. In this paper, we develop a stochastic programming model for metro train rescheduling problem in order to jointly reduce the time delay of affected passengers, their total traveling time and operational costs of trains. To capture the complexity of passenger traveling characteristics, the arriving ratio of passengers at each station is modeled as a non-homogeneous poisson distribution, in which the intensity function is treated as time-varying origin-to-destination passenger demand matrices. By considering the number of on-board passengers, the total energy usage is modeled as the difference between the tractive energy consumption and the regenerative energy. Then, we design an approximate dynamic programming based algorithm to solve the proposed model, which can obtain a high-quality solution in a short time. Finally, numerical examples with real-world data sets are implemented to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approaches.",

        "abstract": "The integrated timetable and speed profile optimization model has recently attracted more attention because of its good achievements on energy conservation in metro systems. However, most previous studies often ignore the spatial and temporal uncertainties of train mass, and the variabilities of tractive force, braking force and basic running resistance on energy consumption in order to simplify the model formulation and solution algorithm. In this paper, we develop an integrated metro timetable and speed profile optimization model to minimize the total tractive energy consumption, where these real-world operating conditions are explicitly considered in the model formulation and solution algorithm. Firstly, we formulate a two-phase stochastic programming model to determine the timetable and speed profile. Given the speed profile, the first phase determines the timetable by scheduling the arrival and departure times for each station, and the second phase determines the speed profile for each inter-station with the scheduled arrival and departure times. Secondly, we design a simulation-based genetic algorithm procedure incorporated with the optimal train control algorithm to find the optimal solution. Finally, we present a simple example and a real-world example based on the operation data from the Beijing Metro Yizhuang Line in Beijing, China. The results of the real-world example show that, during peak hours, off-peak hours and night hours, the total tractive energy consumptions can be reduced by: (1) 10.66%, 9.94% and 9.13% in comparison with the current timetable and speed profile; and (2) 3.35%, 3.12% and 3.04% in comparison with the deterministic model.",

        "abstract": "In the daily operation of metro systems, the train scheduling problem aims to find a set of space-time paths for multiple trains that determine their departure and arrival times at metro stations, while train operations are in charge of selecting the best operational speed to satisfy the punctuality and operation costs. Different from the most existing researches that treat these two problems separately, this paper proposes an integrated approach for the train scheduling problem on a bi-direction urban metro line in order to minimize the operational costs (i.e., energy consumption) and passenger waiting time. More specifically, we simultaneously consider (1) the train operational velocity choices that correspond to the energy consumption of trains on each travelling arc, and (2) the dynamic passenger demands at each station for the calculation of total passenger waiting time in the planning horizon. By employing a space-time network representation in the formulations, this complex train scheduling and control problem with dynamic passenger demands is rigorously formulated into two optimization models with linear forms. The first model is an integer programming model that jointly minimizes train traction energy consumption and passenger waiting time. The second model, which is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model, further considers the utilization of regenerative braking energy on the basis of the first model. Due to the computational complexity of these two models, especially for large-scale real-world instances, we develop a Lagrangian relaxation (LR)-based heuristic algorithm that decomposes the primal problem into two sets of subproblems and thus enables to find a good solution in short computational time. Finally, two sets of numerical experiments, involving a relatively small-scale case and a real-world instance based on the operation data of Beijing metro are implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.",

Specifically, the first stage model determines the optimal allocation plan of backup trains in the storage lines, which aims to achieve a trade-off between investment cost of using backup trains and the expected total travel time of delayed passengers across different stochastic scenarios. The second stage optimizes the timetable of delayed trains on the tracks and backup trains at the storage line in order to minimize the passenger travel time under each stochastic scenario. In particular, the second-stage model is formulated as a multi-commodity network flow model, by which the train capacity can be handled by setting appropriate arc capacity constraints.

        "abstract": "We investigate the problem of fuzzy constrained predictive optimal control of high speed train considering the effect of actuator dynamics. The dynamics feature of the high speed train is modeled as a cascade of cars connected by flexible couplers, and the formulation is mathematically transformed into a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model. The goal of this study is to design a state feedback control law at each decision step to enhance safety, comfort, and energy efficiency of high speed train subject to safety constraints on the control input. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, the problem of optimizing an upper bound on the cruise control cost function subject to input constraints is reduced to a convex optimization problem involving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Furthermore, we analyze the influences of second-order actuator dynamics on the fuzzy constrained predictive controller, which shows risk of potentially deteriorating the overall system. Employing backstepping method, an actuator compensator is proposed to accommodate for the influence of the actuator dynamics. The experimental results show that with the proposed approach high speed train can track the desired speed, the relative coupler displacement between the neighbouring cars is stable at the equilibrium state, and the influence of actuator dynamics is reduced, which demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.",

        "abstract": "Railway point system (RPS) is an important connecting element in railway industry. Faults in RPS increase railway costs of operation and maintenance, and cause delays and even train accidents. Prognostic and health management (PHM) technique can reduce the risks of equipment due to its powerful ability of remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. However, RUL prediction for RPS is a challenging task due to the difficulty of identifying the state for each operating phase related with specific failure modes (FMs) and constructing a comprehensive degradation state from the selected features. To cope with this challenge, this study presents a novel framework for the RUL prediction of RPS. Specifically, a segmentation approach of the power signals is first proposed by constructing an optimization model, in order to identify the FM-related operating phases. Then, a construction method of the health index (HI) is put forward to obtain the comprehensive degradation information by fusing the selected features, which indicate the partial information of the degradation state, and are extracted with popular approaches of feature extraction. Next, the RUL prediction model is developed based on the constructed HIs. Final, this framework is evaluated using the monitoring data of RPS collected from China Railway Guangzhou Group. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RUL prediction framework is very effective for RPS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The advanced train-to-train and train-to-ground communication technologies equipped in high-speed railways have the potential to allow trains to follow each with a steady headway and improve the safety and performance of the railway systems. A key enabler is a train control system that is able to respond to unforeseen disturbances in the system (e.g., incidents, train delays), and to adjust and coordinate the train headways and speeds. This paper proposes a multi-train cooperative control model based on the dynamic features during train longitude movement to adjust train following headway. In particular, our model simultaneously considers several practical constraints, e.g., train controller output constraints, safe train following distance, as well as communication delays and resources. Then, this control problem is solved through a rolling horizon approach by calculating the Riccati equation with Lagrangian multipliers. Due to the practical communication resource constraints and riding comfort requirement, we also improved the rolling horizon approach into a novel self-triggered model predictive control scheme to overcome these issues. Finally, two case studies are given through simulation experiments. The simulation results are analyzed which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Classical research has studied the energy-efficient operational strategy and the energy-efficient system design separately to reduce the traction energy consumption. This paper aims to combine the operational strategies and the system design by analyzing how the infrastructure and vehicle parameters of metro systems influence the operational traction energy consumption. Firstly, a solution approach to the optimal train control model is introduced, which is used to design the Optimal Train Control Simulator(OTCS). Then, based on the OTCS, the performance of some important energy-efficient system design strategies is investigated to reduce the trains\u2019 traction energy consumption, including reduction of the train mass, improvement of the kinematic resistance, the design of the energy-saving gradient, increasing the maximum traction and braking forces, introducing regenerative braking and timetable optimization. As for these energy-efficient strategies, the performances are finally evaluated using the OTCS with the practical operational data of the Beijing Yizhuang metro line. The proposed approach gives an example to quantitatively analyze the energy reduction of different strategies in the system design procedure, which may help the decision makers to have an overview of the energy-efficient performances and then to make decisions by balancing the costs and the benefits.",

        "abstract": "The majority of existing studies in subway train operations focus on timetable optimization and vehicle tracking methods, which may be infeasible with disturbances in actual operations. To deal with uncertain passenger demands and realize real-time train operations (RTOs) satisfying multiobjectives, including overspeed protection, punctuality, riding comfort, and energy consumption, this paper proposes two RTO algorithms via expert knowledge and an online learning approach. The first RTO algorithm is developed by a knowledge-based system to ensure the multiple objectives with a constant timetable. Then, by considering uncertain passenger demand at each station and random running time errors, we convert the train operation problem into a Markov decision process with nondeterministic state transition probabilities in which the aim is to minimize the reward for both the total time delay and energy consumption in a subway line. After designing policy, reward, and transition probability, we develop an integrated train operation (ITO) algorithm based on Q-learning to realize RTOs with online adjusting the timetable. Finally, we present some numerical examples to test the proposed algorithms with real detected data in the Yizhuang Line of Beijing Subway. The results indicate that, taking the multiple objectives into account, the RTO algorithm outperforms both manual driving and automatic train operations. In addition, the ITO algorithm is capable of dealing with uncertain disturbances, keeping the total time delay within 2 s and reducing the energy consumption.",

        "abstract": "Optimal alternative selection to address the emergency situation is critical for dispatcher group in Unattended Train Operation (UTO) to guide emergency process. It is difficult to provide the precise decision value under one criterion and to evaluate the emergency alternatives among multiple dispatchers. This paper presents a hybrid emergency decision-making method integrating fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) described by linguistic terms with enhanced weighted ordered weighted averaging (WOWA) operator. The enhanced WOWA operator aggregates the preference matrices of multidispatcher through the constructed emergency response task model of dispatcher group in OCC. This calculation approach takes into consideration the relations of emergency tasks to derive the importance weights of dispatchers and integrates them into the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator weights based on a fuzzy membership relation. A case study of applying the method in an emergency of a train fire is given to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of the methods associated with the group multicriteria decision-making (GMCDM) theory in emergency management of UTO metro system.",

The dynamic equation of the high-speed train is modeled as a cascade of cars connected by spring-like couplers and then represented by Takagi\u2013Sugeno fuzzy model. Based on model predictive control approach, an effort is made on the design of fuzzy predictive controller such that each car tracks the target speed, and every coupler is stabilized to the equilibrium state as well as optimizing the performance function value at every time instant with regard to accelerating and braking constraints. Sufficient conditions for the existence of corresponding controller optimization problem are given in a set of linear matrix inequalities.

        "abstract": "This paper studies the energy-efficient operation problem of two trains operating along the same line consecutively in urban trail transit (URT). In URT, a moving block signaling (MBS) system is utilized in which the following train's tracking target point is moving forward continuously with the leading train's running. In this case, the following train may be influenced by the leading train's exceptional situations, leading to energy wasting and arrival time delay. In order to reduce energy consumption and arrival delay for the following train, a multiple-optimization-model-based energy-efficient operation method is proposed and verified in this paper. The novelty of this paper lies on the establishment of a novel multiple-model-based switching optimization framework to reduce energy consumption while guaranteeing the punctuality during train tracking operation. More specifically, the operation status of the leading train is combined into the operation optimization for the following train, based on which eight energy-efficient tracking scenarios are discovered and classified into four optimization problems. Then, a general form of running phase sequence is designed to describe the energy-efficient train tracking operation strategy, and a new energy consumption function is proposed. Based on these, the four optimization problems are built into small-scale nonlinear programming models, which are computationally inexpensive and easy for online implementation. During the tracking process, the following train can obtain the energy-efficient strategies through switching among these four optimization models. In this framework, the following train is able to arrive at the next station by the fastest arrival time with lower energy consumption even when the arrival time is delayed by the leading train. Simulation results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the new method.",

With the operation data, the reward of each segment for the train operation can be evaluated. Then, the monte carlo reinforcement learning method is applied to select the optimal solution for the train control decision.

Besides, the complexity and volume of the verification results tend to make users feel extremely non-understandable. In order to tackle these problems, we introduce a toolset based on Domain Specific Language for Computer Based Interlocking Systems (DSL-CBI) to automatically generate and verify the interlocking table, and then mark the conflicting routes in the railway station.

A 3-valued executable semantics for finite trace LTL is formally defined, and an algorithm based on this new semantics is proposed and implemented in Maude, which is a high performance rewriting system. To improve the efficiency of our algorithm, we introduce a novel approximation technique, which reduces rewriting steps by sacrificing some abilities of detecting the satisfactions of LTL properties. Moreover, this technique provides a quick procedure for distinguishing non-monitor able properties from those can be monitored. Finally, experiments are conducted to show the strength and weakness of the presented method.",

        "abstract": "As a safety-critical system, the Chinese Train Control System Level 3 (CTCS-3) have complex fault modes. To generate test suite, which can cover all known faults, is very difficult. In this paper, we proposed a methodology of generating test suite for CTCS-3 train control system based on timed automata with input and output (TAIO) and mutation testing theory. Firstly, according to the characteristics of the fault modes in CTCS-3, mutation operators that contain all known faults of mode transition function (\u201cchange action\u201d, \u201cchange target\u201d, \u201cchange source\u201d, etc) are designed. Secondly, the TAIO model of mode transition (TAIO A) in CTCS-3 is established. With each mutation operator, mutants of mode transition timed automata model (TAIO M) are built. Test suites are generated based on the conformance relation of TAIO A and TAIO M using the k-Bounded model checking technique. Finally, the coverage of the test suites have been analyzed by the conformance relation score (CRS), average conformance relation score (ACRS) and weighted conformance relation score (WCRS). Three fault modes of \u201cchange action\u201d, \u201cchange invariant\u201d and \u201csink location\u201d could be covered effectively and completely detected, wherever, two fault modes coverage of \u201cnegate guard\u201d and \u201cinvert reset\u201d are not high enough, which need additional observation to detect.",

In this paper, a method of generating complete test suite for the CTCS-3 Target Speed Monitor (TSM) has been presented, based on Input Equivalence Class Partitioning (IECP) test theory. Firstly, according to the system requirement specification (SRS) of CTCS-3, the finite state machine models of TSM are built, which satisfy the different brake control modes of driver with high Priority and Automatic Train Protection (ATP) with high Priority. Secondly, the Input/Output (I/O) equivalence and the equivalence class partition theory are applied to obtain two kinds of IECPs with different braking control modes. Finally, the fault models and fault domain of system under test (SUT) are introduced. Two complete test suites of TSM are generated, which can detect any faults in its given fault domain. Different brake control modes in TSM have been compared, in which the ATP with high Priority control mode has a higher test cases number, but more time and memory consumption.",

In this paper, we study the performance optimization issues in communication-based train control (CBTC) systems with both packet delay and loss introduced by random transmission errors and frequent handoffs in train-wayside communications. A networked control system (NCS) model is formulated for multitrain CBTC systems with packet delay and loss. Then, we propose a novel train control scheme to enhance the quality of service (QoS) of CBTC systems. In the proposed scheme, medium-access control layer retry limit adaption is used to minimize the energy consumption, and guidance trajectory update is used to mitigate the trip time tracking errors. Extensive simulation results show that the QoS of CBTC systems can be substantially improved in the proposed scheme. The energy consumption and trip time error can be reduced in both static and time-varying wireless environments.",

        "abstract": "Communication-based train control (CBTC) systems use wireless local area networks for information transmission between trains and wayside equipment. Since inevitable packet delay and drop are introduced in train\u2013wayside communications, information uncertainties in trains' states will lead to unplanned traction/braking demands, as well as waste in electrical energy. Moreover, with the introduction of regenerative braking technology, power grids in CBTC systems are evolving to smart grids, and cost-aware power management should be employed to reduce the total financial cost of consumed electrical energy. In this paper, a cognitive control method for CBTC systems with smart grids is presented to enhance both train operation performance and cost efficiency. We formulate a cognitive control system model for CBTC systems. The information gap in cognitive control is calculated to analyze how the train\u2013wayside communications affect the operation of trains. The Q-learning algorithm is used in the proposed cognitive control method, and a joint objective function composed of the information gap and the total financial cost is applied to generate optimal policy. The medium-access control layer retry-limit adaption and traction strategy selection are adopted as cognitive actions. Extensive simulation results show that the cost efficiency and train operation performance of CBTC systems are substantially improved using our proposed cognitive control method.",

Moreover, with the development of power grid technology, smart grid can be applied in CBTC systems to reduce the electricity cost. In this paper, we introduce a cognitive control method to improve performance of CBTC systems in smart grid environment. A cognitive control system is presented and the performance optimization problem in smart grid environment is formulated as Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP), where Medium Access Control (MAC)-layer parameters adaption and feedback gain adaption are applied to minimize both electricity cost and information uncertainty of CBTC systems. Simulation results show that the proposed cognitive control scheme can improve the cost-efficiency of CBTC systems.",

        "abstract": "The convergence of pedestrian flow in a unidirectional corridor is studied based on the two-time-scale hybrid traffic models for pedestrian crowds. In the two-time-scale framework, the corridor is divided into a set of virtual lanes. The width of each lane is equal to the diameter of a pedestrian which is modeled as a disk. Being situated in a corridor, the pedestrians can either walk in a lane following each other or change to the adequate lanes. The in-lane movements of pedestrians are viewed as a one-line multi-agent dynamic system in continuous time. The lane changing behavior of pedestrians is modeled as a Markov decision process. Pedestrians will change lanes according to the transition probabilities which are functions depending on pedestrian velocities in the related lanes. Furthermore, the quantized consensus state of pedestrian flow is defined. We show that when pedestrians wish to change to faster lanes, the numbers of pedestrians in each lane converge to a balanced distribution (quantized consensus state) as shown typically in pedestrian flows. Numerical simulations and theoretical analysis are used to demonstrate the convergence properties of this method. Simulation results show that the model can capture the main features of unidirectional pedestrian flows.",

In this paper, we introduce communication strategies for communication-based train control (CBTC) systems using long-term evolution for metro (LTE-M) to improve the reliability and latency. To be specific, the FlashLinQ-based Train-to-Train (T2T) communication schemes are introduced considering both the transmission delay and the packet drop. The quantified resilience is also introduced as a system metric to evaluate the preservation and recovery performance of CBTC systems. First, a novel urban rail transit wireless communication model is established using FlashLinQ-based T2T communications. Then, we introduce a novel cognitive control scheme based on LTE-M with T2T communication to enhance the quality of service and the resilience of multi-train CBTC systems. In the introduced scheme, Q-learning is used to generate optimal control strategies considering both wireless communication parameters adaption and train control parameters. Extensive simulations are conducted and the results show that the resilience of CBTC systems can be enhanced using the introduced scheme. Furthermore, using the introduced scheme, not only the gaps in optimal velocity versus distance curve are smaller, but also the unplanned traction and breaking are reduced as well.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Pedestrian simulation approach has been widely used to reveal the human behavior and evaluate the performance of crowd evacuation. In the existing pedestrian simulation models, the social force model is capable of predicting many collective phenomena. Detour behavior occurs in many cases, and the important behavior is a dominate factor of the crowd evacuation efficiency. However, limited attention has been attracted for analyzing and modeling the characteristics of detour behavior. In this paper, a modified social force model integrated by Voronoi diagram is proposed to calculate the detour direction and preferred velocity. Besides, with the consideration of locations and velocities of neighbor pedestrians, a Logit-based choice model is built to describe the detour direction choice. The proposed model is applied to analyze pedestrian dynamics in a corridor scenario with either unidirectional or bidirectional flow, and a building scenario in real-world. Simulation results show that the modified social force model including detour behavior could reduce the frequency of collision and deadlock, increase the average speed of the crowd, and predict more practical crowd dynamics with detour behavior. This model can also be potentially applied to understand the pedestrian dynamics and design emergent management strategies for crowd evacuations.",

Besides circumventing the problem of complexity explosion, the nonlinear gain feedback technique brings a self-regulation ability into the pioneering DSC method to improve the dynamic performance of the resulted closed-loop system. Neural networks are used to online approximating the uncertainties, the over-fitting problem occurs with small probability since the signals obtained by NNs are also handled using nonlinear gain function. It is proved rigorously by Lyapunov stability theorem that all the closed-loop signals are kept semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded, the output tracking error and the optimal neural weight vector estimation error can all be adjusted to arbitrarily small around zero characterized by design parameters in an explicit way. Furthermore, the method proposed can be extended to the control of multiple-input-multiple-output system trivially.

Efficient text mining of such maintenance data plays an important role in discovering the best-practice repair knowledge from millions of repair verbatims, which help to conduct accurate fault diagnosis and predication. This paper presents a text case-based reasoning framework by cloud computing, which uses the diagnosis ontology for annotating fault features recorded in the repair verbatim. The extracted fault features are further reduced by rough set theory. Finally, the case retrieval is employed to search the best-practice repair actions for fixing faulty parts. By cloud computing, rough set-based attribute reduction and case retrieval are able to scale up the Big Data records and improve the efficiency of fault diagnosis and predication. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through a fault diagnosis of train onboard equipment.",

        "abstract": "The traditional hazard analysis approaches applied to the socio-technical system cannot cover the complex organization structures, the interactions between systems and human behaviors, the interrelated factors among sub-systems and the safety culture of specific societies. This paper presents an integrated hazard identification approach named System-Theoretic Process Analysis Based on Formalization Model (BFM-STPA), which can solve the above issues. Firstly, the hierarchical control structure models of the socio-technical system are established through Colored Petri Nets (CPN) due to its strong description ability and executable ability, which may also be regarded as the graphical system specification. Secondly, the hazards can be identified according to the CPN models following a series of guide conditions. Thirdly, the comprehensive contributing factors to the hazards will be found out by tracing the former states within the reachability graph generated from CPN model. Finally, an integrated hazard log can be derived for further hazard analysis and safety-guided design. In this paper, the above method was applied in the Chinese Train Control System level 3 (CTCS-3). And the process of hazard identification for the scenario of Temporary Speed Restriction issued was elaborated in detail. Compared with the hazard log generated by Hazard and Operability (HAZOP), the hazard log generated by BFM-STPA covered not only the subsystem failures, but also the deviation of interactions among subsystems from design intent, human errors and socio-technical drawbacks related to the TSR Issued scenario of CTCS-3.

        "abstract": "The stream programming model has been widely studied in recent years,and it is proved to be a good candidate for the stream architecture based on software-managed streaming memory such as stream register file.However,some researches point out that the stream programming model is also beneficial to the hardware-managed coherent cache-based architectures.Besides,general data cache has been integrated into the GPGPU recently,which is the most important scenario where the stream programming model is used.Thus,exploiting the cache locality becomes very critical to improve the performance of the stream programs on these architectures.Due to the particular execution model,the way that the reuse carried by the stream programs is transformed into locality differs from that of serial programs.The traditional locality analysis method cannot be used to analyze the stream programs directly.Based on the detailed analysis of transformation from reuse to locality,we propose the concept of \"iteration sequence\" to capture the difference between the execution model of stream and serial programs.Then we extend the traditional locality analysis method and propose a general locality analysis method based on the iteration sequence.Further,we propose two locality optimization techniques derived from the locality analysis model.The experimental results obtained on the GPGPUSim simulator illustrate that our quantitative analysis about the locality of stream program is efficient and the locality optimization techniques can evidently improve the locality and the performance.",

As a high performance and power efficiency accelerator,GPU(graphics processing unit) has been extensively used in HPC(high performance computing) area. However,the inherent unreliability of the GPU hardware deteriorates the reliability of supercomputer. Presently,most research of FT(fault-tolerance) techniques for CPU-GPU heterogeneous system isolates the GPU from the system,and does FT work for it at the granularity of a single GPU invocation. This paper proposes a new Lazy FT method for CPU-GPU heterogeneous system,introduces a FT framework and its constraints based on directives,and demonstrates the validity of the Lazy FT method. The experimental results show that,compared with existing FT methods,the cost of LazyFT is very cheap.",

        "abstract": "Peta-scale high-performance computing systems are increasingly built with heterogeneous CPU and GPU nodes to achieve higher power efficiency and computation throughput. While providing unprecedented capabilities to conduct computational experiments of historic significance, these systems are presently difficult to program. The users, who are domain experts rather than computer experts, prefer to use programming models closer to their domains (e.g., physics and biology) rather than MPI and OpenMP. This has led the development of domain-specific programming that provides domain-specific programming interfaces but abstracts away some performance-critical architecture details. Based on experience in designing large-scale computing systems, a hybrid programming framework for scientific computing on heterogeneous architectures is proposed in this work. Its design philosophy is to provide a collaborative mechanism for domain experts and computer experts so that both domain-specific knowledge and performance-critical architecture details can be adequately exploited. Two real-world scientific applications have been evaluated on TH-1A, a peta-scale CPU-GPU heterogeneous system that is currently the 5th fastest supercomputer in the world. The experimental results show that the proposed framework is well suited for developing large-scale scientific computing applications on peta-scale heterogeneous CPU/GPU systems. \u00a9 2013 Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

We then systematically evaluate the performance benefits of using multiple streams. The evaluation work is performed at two levels: the microbenchmarking level and the real-world application level. Our experimental results at the microbenchmark level show that data transfers and kernel execution can be overlapped on Phi, while data transfers in both directions are performed in a serial manner. At the real-world application level, we show that both overlappable and non-overlappable applications can benefit from using multiple streams (with an performance improvement of up to 24%). We also quantify how task granularity and resource granularity impact the overall performance. Finally, we present a set of heuristics to reduce the search space when determining a proper task granularity and resource granularity. To conclude, our evaluation work provides lots of insights for runtime and architecture designers when using multiple streams on Phi.",

        "abstract": "Graph coloring has been broadly used to discover concurrency in parallel computing, where vertices with the same color represent subtasks that can be processed simultaneously. To speedup graph coloring for large scaledatasets, parallel algorithms have been proposed to leverage the massive hardware resources on modern multicore CPUs or GPGPUs. Existing GPU implementations either have limited performance or yield unsatisfactory coloring quality (too many colors assigned). We present a high performance parallel graph coloring implementation on GPGPUs with good coloring quality. Our approach employs the speculative greedy algorithm which usually yields better quality than the method based on maximal independent set. In order to achieve high performance on GPGPUs, we adapt the algorithm to improve work efficiency and reduce overhead, and incorporate several optimization techniques which reduce memory access latency and atomic operation overhead. Our method is evaluated with both synthetic and real-world graphs on the NVIDIA GPU. Experimental results show that our proposed implementations outperform the sequential implementation (3.0\u00d7 speedup) and the existing GPU implementation from the NVIDIA CUSPARSE library (1.5\u00d7 speedup), while yielding good coloring quality close to the sequential implementation.",

Among the heterogeneous codes, we identify two types of non-streamable codes and three types of streamable codes, for which a streaming approach has been proposed.

        "abstract": "Energy consumption is increasingly becoming a critical issue in HPC. There is a broad consensus that future exascale-computing will be strongly constrained by energy consumption. Heterogeneous systems usually feature higher energy efficiency than homogeneous ones since the former employ coprocessors that provide higher GFlops/Watt than CPUs. Thus, it is of great importance to better utilize the coprocessors from an energy-efficiency standpoint. Dense LU factorization (LU) is a critical kernel that is widely used to solve dense linear algebra problems. However, existingheterogeneous implementations are typically designed to be CPU-centered, which rely highly on CPUs and thus suffer from large data transfer overheads via PCIe, hurting the energy efficiency of the entire computer system. We present a coprocessor-resident implementation of LU for a heterogeneous platform to improve energy efficiency without impeding performance by relieving the CPUs from performing unnecessary computations and reducing excessive data transfers via PCIe. In addition, several optimizations are judiciously employed to overlap the computation and communication between the CPUs and coprocessors. Validation on the Tianhe-2 supercomputer shows that our LU implementation gains higher performance, achieves higher energy efficiency, and features a better scalability than Intel MKL.",

        "abstract": "Detecting strongly connected components (SCC) has been broadly used in many real-world applications. To speedup SCC detection for large-scale graphs, parallel algorithms have been proposed to leverage modern GPUs. Existing GPU implementations are able to get speedup on synthetic graph instances, but show limited performance when applied to large-scale real-world datasets. In this paper, we present a parallel SCC detection implementation on GPUs that achieves high performance on both synthetic and real-world graphs. We use a hybrid method that divides the algorithm into two phases. Our method is able to dynamically change parallelism strategies to maximize performance for each algorithm phase. We then orchestrates the graph traversal kernel with customized strategy for each phase, and employ algorithm extensions to handle the serialization problem caused by irregular graph properties. Our design is carefully implemented to take advantage of the GPU hardware. Evaluation with diverse graphs on the NVIDIA K20c GPU shows that our proposed implementation achieves an average speedup of 5.0x over the serial Tarjan's algorithm. It also outperforms the existing OpenMP implementation with a speedup of 1.4x.",

Hybrid LU algorithms have been well designed to exploit the full capacity of heterogeneous systems. However, existing heterogeneous implementations are typically CPU-centric, which rely highly on CPU cores and suffer from a large amount of data transfers via the PCIe bus, and thus reduce the overall energy efficiency of the entire computer system. In this paper, we provide a coprocessor-resident implementation of LU for a heterogeneous platform to improve energy efficiency by relieving the CPUs from performing heavy load computations and avoiding excessive data transfers via PCIe. To maintain the performance, we conduct optimizations to pipeline the CPU computation, coprocessor computation, MPI communication, and PCIe transfer between the CPUs and coprocessors. The experiments on the Tianhe-2 supercomputer show that our LU implementation can compete with the highly optimized Intel MKL implementation in performance and overcome the limitations of energy efficiency.",

In this paper, we provide an OpenCL implementation on an ARMv8 multi-core CPU, which efficiently maps the generic OpenCL platform model to the ARMv8 multi-core architecture. With this implementation, we first characterize the maximum achieved arithmetic throughput and memory accessing bandwidth on the architecture, and measure the OpenCL-related overheads. Our results demonstrate that there exists an optimization room for improving OpenCL kernel performance. Then, we compare the performance of OpenCL against serial codes and OpenMP codes with 11 benchmarks. The experimental results show that (1) the OpenCL implementation can achieve an average speedup of 6X compared to its OpenMP counterpart, and (2) the GPU-specified OpenCL codes are often unsuitable for this ARMv8 multi-core CPU.",

        "abstract": "Heterogeneous systems with both Central Processing Units (CPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are frequently used to accelerate short-ranged Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The most time-consuming task in short-ranged MD simulations is the computation of particle-to-particle interactions. Beyond a certain distance, these interactions decrease to zero. To minimize the operations to investigate distance, previous works have tiled interactions by employing the spatial attribute, which increases the memory access and GPU computations, hence decreasing performance. Other studies ignore the spatial attribute and construct an all-versus-all interaction matrix, which has poor scalability. This paper presents an improved algorithm. The algorithm first bins particles into voxels according to the spatial attributes, and then tiles the all-versus-all matrix into voxel-versus-voxel sub-matrixes. Only the sub-matrixes between neighboring voxels are computed on the GPU. Therefore, the algorithm reduces the distance examine operations and limits additional memory access and GPU computations. This paper also adopts a multi-level programming model to implement the algorithm on multi-nodes of Tianhe-lA. By employing (1) a patch design to exploit parallelism across the simulation domain, (2) a communication overlapping method to overlap the communications between CPUs and GPUs, and (3) a dynamic workload balancing method to adjust the workloads among compute nodes, the implementation achieves a speedup of 4.16x on one NVIDIA Tesla M2050 GPU compared to a 2.93 GHz six-core Intel Xeon X5670 CPU. In addition, it runs 2.41x faster on 256 compute nodes of Tianhe-lA (with two CPUs and one GPU inside a node) than on 256 GPU-excluded nodes.",

        "abstract": "A novel slow-wave structure, i.e., an open-style dielectric-lined azimuthally periodic circular waveguide (open-style DLAP-CW) which can be applied to millimeter wave traveling-wave tube, is proposed. The hot dispersion characteristics are derived by the selfconsistent relativistic field theory. And the electron beam interaction in the novel slow-wave structure (SWS) is analyzed in a linear frame. The linear gain characteristics of the DLAP-CW is studied analytically for dimensions of the improved SWS and the parameters of the electron beam. The results illustrate that selecting the appropriate dimensions of the metal rods can improve the small-signal gain. Finally, a comparison of the small-signal gain of this structure with a close-style DLAP-CW is made, and the results validate that the novel SWS has an advantage over the close-style DLAP-CW in gain with little influence on the bandwidth, which can potentially improve electron efficiency in the beam wave interaction. The research in this paper will also be a foundation of the theory for open-style dielectric-lined azimuthally periodic circular waveguide traveling-wave tube. \u00a9 2012 Chinese Physical Society.",

The interaction circuit employs the double staggered ladder line coupled-cavity slow-wave structure. Combined with the design of well-matched high frequency coupling system, a 3-D circuit model based on CPI's Ka-band CCTWT was constructed. The particle-in-cell simulation results show that the tube can produce saturated average output power over 550 watts with greater than 600 MHz instantaneous bandwidth ranging from 28.3 GHz to 30 GHz when we adopt the similar parameters as CPI's Ka-band CCTWT, such as beam voltage, beam current and the slow-wave structure dispersion characteristics. The corresponding saturated gain and beam efficiency can reach over 33 dB and 8.39%, respectively. These results are in good agreement with the experimentally measured ones of the CPI's Ka-band CCTWT, which suggest that our design scheme is feasible and the CST PIC solver can accurately predict the performance of the CCTWT.",

The transition structure and the output coupler can effectively reduce the attenuation and reflection of such type of straight-waveguide device. Compared to conventional pencil beam device, the oscillator can provide much higher output power. The dynamic process between the electron beam and the electromagnetic wave was simulated by three dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) code. The simulation results demonstrate that the BWO can provide a stable output power in the order of a few watts in the frequency range from 92 GHz to 98 GHz by adjusting the operation voltage, assuming a constant operation current of 12 mA. The output signal shows good monochromaticity, with the central frequency quite close to the design.",

        "abstract": "Target identification fusion based on multi-source remote sensing images can make full use of the redundancy and complementary information from all sensors,acquiring more accurate result of target recognition.One of the pre-condition of identification fusion is target association,which is to determine if the information from two or more images are related to the same target and should be fused together.Due to different performance of sensor and diverse target distribution,the extracted information of targets generally has some uncertainty,which results in the difficulty in judging whether the information from two images is originated from the same target.Therefore,how to utilize the information of remote sensing images to distinguish multi-target association has become an urgen problem.There are two kinds of methods concerning target association when using image data: one is Kalman filtering based data association and tracking,which utilizes accumulated kinematic information of multi-frame images to estimate and track.Typical methods are Nearest Neighbor(NN),Joint Probabilistic Data Association(JPDA),Multiple-Hypothesis Tracking(MHT) and so on.These methods need dense sampling of observed data,and the target motion model should be simple.The other one uses image match in computer vision for reference.Typical methods are cross correlation matching,feature matching and so on.These methods usually work on condition that only single target is concerned.For remote sensing images,there are two problems when associating multiple targets in them.Firstly,it is incapable to acquire a series of multi-temporal remote sensing images on the same region at present,so the kinematic state of a target cannot be estimated accurately with low temporal resolution data and the classical Kalman filtering association algorithms are no more applicable.We must seek for other time-independent information as the associating measurement,which can be image invariant feature.Secondly,there are two uncertainties lying in image feature extraction of a target.One uncertainty lies in determining invariant features due to various image distortions such as rotation,scaling and so on.The other lies in establishing feature correspondences between any two consecutive images.So,it is difficult to discriminate the ambiguity of multiple targets' correspondences when using image matching-based association method.In order to solve above problems,a novel multiple targets association method based on image invariant feature matching and Association Cost Matrix(ACM) global optimization is proposed.At first,the Multi-scale Autoconvolution(MSA) transform of a target is computed based on affine invariant theory and is used as association measurement,which can overcome the negative influence of changes in target's pose,imaging viewpoint and so on.Secondly,the association cost matrix is constructed based on the dissimilarities of MSA feature matching of any two target pairs from two images respectively,representing the correspondence illegibility of two targets.Finally,the minimal energy of ACM is found using simulated annealing(SA) algorithm,and the global optimal association result is achieved.From the simulation experiments,some conclusions can be drawn as follows:(1) Using image invariant features to perform target association is a validate way,overcoming the bottleneck that the time-dependent kinematic feature cannot be estimated from sparse remote sensing image series.(2) Compared with the NN local algorithm,the optimization of association cost matrix is a global optimal algorithm and has excellent performance in dense targets circumstance.(3)The approximate algorithms such as SA can greatly improve the search of optimal association cost matrix,and then make complex association method practicable.",

In this paper, a new similarity measure for uncertain SAR images based on intensity increment code is proposed after analyzing the characteristics of existing methods. Firstly, the code image is obtained by averaging the difference of brightness in adjacent pixels in SAR images. Then, the similarity measure for uncertain SAR images is got by evaluating the concordance of code images. The proposed method is proved to be robust to speckle noise, partially occlusion and fuzzification through theoretical analysis in this paper and the SAR image matching at confidence level using the proposed method is discussed. The theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed similarity measure is robust to the speckle noise, partially occlusion and fuzzification in SAR images and is valid for uncertain SAR image matching.",

The transmission characteristics of the novel SWS are studied by simulation. The results indicate that the novel SWS have good transmission characteristics at the operating frequencies. On this basis, the beam-wave interaction is studied by particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to verify the reversed Cherenkov radiation (RCR). The results show that the novel SWS interacting with the sheet beam can generate output power of \u223c 4 MW at the beam entrance. The proposed novel SWS can be developed into novel vacuum devices.",

This kind of structure has the characteristics of higher interaction impedance and wider frequency band. It is suitable for traveling wave tube operating in high current and high voltage. The electromagnetic characteristics and the beam-wave interaction of this kind of structure are investigated. The calculation results reveal that it can produce saturated output power over 1000Wfrom 93 GHz to 99GHz when the cathode voltage and beam current are set to 22 kV and 500 mA respectively.",

Two dielectric rods are placed on both sides of metallic meander line to support it, instead of the dielectric substrate in the conventional microstrip meander line. Furthermore, it can not only solve the problem of the electron charge accumulation on microstrip but also leads to a bigger interaction impedance. According to particle-in-cell simulation results, a dual-sheet-beam planar dielectric-rod-support uniform metallic meander line TWT can get an output power of 330.2\u2009W at 38\u2009GHz under the case of 10.6\u2009kV beam voltage and 0.2\u2009A beam current. The corresponding maximum gain and electron efficiency are 23.4\u2009dB and 15.5%, respectively, where the length of whole SWS is only 20\u2009mm.",

Due to the design idea owing the combination of folded groove waveguide and log-periodic form, this new SWS possess several advantages from them. Low operation voltage and weak dispersion of electromagnetic wave are merits of them. In addition, a modified equation to calculate the phase velocity in radial direction was proposed. In the end, one angular log-periodic folded groove waveguide was designed which owing 38.8W output power at 198GHz, the gain is 18.8dB when operation voltage is set to 8080V.",

However, the precision of processing and assembling of the magnetic system is getting higher as magnetic blocks become thinner. Here, a uniform permanent magnetic field with hemi-ladder structure for sheet electron beam focusing is designed in this paper. The simulation result shows that a uniform magnetic field with 0.7 T can be obtained among a length of 65mm. Based on these, the designed magnetic field is applied to the focusing of a 0.3*0.08mm sheet beam with electron current of 44 mA and voltage of 22.1 kV produced by a 340GHz sheet beam electron gun, and the beam transmission efficiency measured by current is 94.34% in a 0.35*0.W*65mm drift tube. This structure has the convenience of design and realization compared with PPM system.",

This device is configured as a multiplier\u2013amplifier with Q-band input signals and its third harmonic, i.e., D-band output power. The tested result demonstrates that 280 mW at 133.5 GHz is obtained as a result of 200 mW at 44.5-GHz input signal. The simulation and experiment validate that the high-harmonic radiation can be generated and amplified in the HHTWT. The approach described in this paper could find application in exploring high power, wideband tunable terahertz source. This paper is expanded from a conference paper on IVEC 2017. The detail design produce and tested result are added in this paper. The explanation of the simulation and tested results is also presented.",

        "abstract": "The charge couple device (CCD) tracking loop of a fast steering mirror (FSM) is usually used to stabilize line of sight (LOS). High closed-loop bandwidth facilitates good performance. However, low-rate sample and time delay of the CCD greatly limit the high control bandwidth. This paper proposes an error-based observer (EBO) to improve the low-frequency performance of the CCD tracking system. The basic idea is by combining LOS error from the CCD and the controller output to produce the high-gain observer, forwarding into the originally closed-loop control system. This proposed EBO can improve the system both in target tracking and disturbance suppression due to LOS error from the CCD's sensing of the two signals. From a practical engineering view, the closed-loop stability and robustness of the EBO system are investigated on the condition of gain margin and phase margin of the open-loop transfer function. Two simulations of CCD experiments are provided to verify the benefits of the proposed algorithm.",

Two identical motors are mounted on each side of a U-type frame to drive the telescope elevation axis instead of a single motor drive, which is usually used in a classical design. This new configuration and mechanism can reduce the motor to half the size used in the former design, and it also provides some other advantages. A master-slave current control mode is employed to synchronize the two motors. Acceleration feedback control is utilized to further enhance the servo performance. Extensive experiments are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm in synchronization, disturbance attenuation and low-velocity tracking.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a modified disturbance observer (DOB) for fast steering mirror (FSM) optical system based on a charge-coupled device (CCD) and inertial sensors is proposed. Combining a DOB with the classical cascaded multiloop feedback control, including position loop, velocity loop, and acceleration loop, that the disturbance suppression performance of line-of-sight in an FSM system can be significant improved. However, due to the quadratic differential in the FSM acceleration open-loop response, in fact, it is very difficult to realize an integral algorithm to compensate a quadratic differential in practical application. Thus, the conventional DOB controller has to be simplified further to make a concession, which eventuates in still insufficient disturbance compensation, particularly at low frequency. To solve this problem, an enhanced DOB control structure, which changes the compensation plant to be the acceleration open-loop and avoids the saturation of double integration skillfully, is proposed. The recommended method optimizes the controller design, which is conducive to controller fulfillment in practical systems. A series of comparative experimental results demonstrate that the disturbance suppression performance of the FSM control system can be effectively improved by the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Structural vibrations usually feature tip-tilt modes and affect the closed-loop performance of the tip-tilt mirror control system in astronomical telescopes. Long integration time of the image sensor always restricts the closed-loop control bandwidth, resulting in difficulties in rejecting structural vibrations. An error-based plug-in controller to mitigate multimodal structural vibrations is proposed. Only position error is used in this proposed controller, which can be plugged into existing feedback loops to create high gain at the frequencies of multimodal disturbances, and thereby the closed-loop performance can be optimized by designing an appropriate Q-filter. When the centered frequencies of energetic disturbances are determined, a band-pass filter is suggested to mitigate multimodal vibrations. This improved band-pass filter can avoid big amplifications at other frequencies. Due to not being restricted by an accurate model, the plug-in controller does not lead to a compromise between vibration rejection and control stability. Both simulation and experiment validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the tip-tilt mirror control system under the condition of vibrations.

        "abstract": "High control bandwidth is usually restricted in a finite sampling rate of a charge-coupled device (CCD)-based tracking loop, which hinders a good closed-loop performance. Conventionally, a rate feedforward controller is usually used to improve the control performance; however, it is restricted by the line-of-sight (LOS) rate, which is required to be estimated due to only the LOS error available in the CCD-based tracking control system. Besides that, it is also affected by the inverse of the control model. A new error-based feedforward (EBF) control mode is proposed to overcome these difficulties. Due to being plugged into an existing feedback control loop, the closed-loop performance of the CCD-based control system can be minimized by optimizing a Q-filter. The closed-loop stability and robustness with this EBF control system are investigated on the condition of the gain margin and the phase margin of the open-loop transfer function. Furthermore, this paper proposes a new criterion to enhance the robustness of the EBF control system and reveals the sensitivity function property. Because of not being restricted by an accurate model, this new feedforward controller cannot lead to a compromise between error attenuation and noise propagation in the control loop. Simulations and experiments are both used to testify the effectiveness of the improved control mode.",

This paper presents a mode-free disturbance observer (DOB) based on sensor-fusion to reduce some errors related disturbances for a gear-driven gimbal. This DOB uses the rate deviation to detect disturbances for implementation of a high-gain compensator. In comparison with the angular position signal the rate deviation between load and motor can exhibits the disturbances exiting in the gear-driven gimbal quickly. Due to high bandwidth of the motor rate closed loop, the inverse model of the plant is not necessary to implement DOB. Besides, this DOB requires neither complex modeling of plant nor the use of additive sensors. Without rate sensors providing angular rate, the rate deviation is easily detected by encoders mounted on the side of motor and load, respectively. Extensive experiments are provided to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "In the ground-based astronomical telescope, the imaging quality is usually affected by tip-tilt vibrations induced by the telescope structure. Long exposure time of the image sensor is usually required for a good signal-to-noise ratio, which brings the amount of time delays into the control loop of the tip-tilt mirror. Thus, a low control bandwidth is insufficient to compensate telescope vibrations. In this paper, an improved disturbance observer (DOB) control based on only the image sensor is proposed to reject structural vibrations. This new DOB controller is added into the original loop in the tip-tilt mirror control system, so the closed-loop performance can be optimized by designing an appropriate Q-filter. An improved Q-filter is presented to reject large-magnitude vibrations and also to reduce amplifications induced by this controller at nondisturbance frequencies. This proposed controller can achieve a satisfying result in vibration mitigations when vibration frequencies are provided to design the Q-filter. Furthermore, in the tilt\u2013tilt mirror control system, this improved DOB is not restricted by an accurate model such that noise in the loop cannot provide serious influence on vibration mitigation. Both simulations and extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the DOB can earn an extra improvement on the control performance in comparisons with the conventional feedback controller.",

Besides, the robustness performances of double speed loops and single speed loop are analyzed in theory, respectively.

Furthermore, to further reduce the turning error and enhance the precision of system, the article puts forward applying double proportional\u2013integral controllers with double extended state observers in the two speed loops. Extended state observers can transform the nonlinear models into an approximate linear model and eliminate the nonlinear frictions in the system.

It is still a technical challenge to enhance the tolerance of microalgae to flue gas if CO is fixed from flue gas directly. A new strain, Chlorella sp. Cv was obtained through adaptive evolution (46\u202fcycles) against simulated flue gas (10% CO, 200\u202fppm NO and 100\u202fppm SO). It was confirmed that Chlorella sp. Cv could tolerate simulated flue gas conditions and the maximum CO fixation rate was 1.2\u202fg\u202fL\u202fd. In a two-stage process, the biomass concentration was 2.7\u202fg\u202fL and the carbohydrate content was 68.4%. Comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed for Chlorella sp. Cv under simulated flue gas and control conditions (10% CO). These responses against simulated flue gas uncovered the significant difference between the evolved strain and the original strain. The metabolic responses to flue gas were explored with focus on various specific genes. Upregulation of several genes related to photosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, CO fixation, sulfur metabolism and nitrogen metabolism was beneficial for the evolved strain to tolerate the simulated flue gas. The upregulation of genes related to extracellular sulfur transport and nitrate reductase was essential to utilize the sulfate and nitrate from dissolved SO and NO. The results in this study are helpful to establish a new process for CO capture directly from industrial flue gas.",

In general, several strains of cyanobacteria were involved in the biofertilizers. The co-cultivation of cyanobacteria were characterized on growth profile, production of polysaccharides and extracellular proteins, nitrogenase activity, and photosynthetic activity for three selected N-fixing cyanobacteria, Anabaena cylindrica (B1611 and F243) and Nostoc sp. (F280). After eight-day culture, the highest dry weights were obtained in F280 pure culture and co-cultivation of B1611 and F280. Higher production of extracellular proteins and cell-bonding polysaccharides (CPS) were observed in co-cultivations compared with pure culture. The highest released polysaccharides (RPS) contents were obtained in pure culture of F280 and co-cultivation of F280 and F243. Galactose and glucose were major components of CPS and RPS in all samples. Trehalose was a specific component of RPS in F280 pure culture. Based on the monosaccharide contents of CPS and RPS, F280 was the dominant species in the related treatments of co-cultivation. The nitrogenase activities in all treatments exhibited a sharp rise at the late stage while a significant decrease existed when three cyanobacteria strains were mixed. Photosynthetic activities for all treatments were determined with rapid light curve, and the related parameters were estimated.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Co-culture of microalgae and bacteria is a promising method for wastewater treatment. The suitable selection of the bacteria in co-cultures with microalgae is critical for wastewater treatment. Three bacteria,  Exiguobacterium aurantiacum ,  Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila , and  Chryseobacterium scophthalmus , were the dominant bacterial species in fermentation wastewater treated by microalgae and activated sludge. Pure cultures and co-cultures of microalgae ( Chlorella sorokiniana  L3) and these bacteria were evaluated for the treatment of fermentation wastewater, which contains high concentrations of acetate acid, butyric acid, ethanol and butanol. The performance of the co-cultures was better than that of pure cultures of microalgae or bacteria for the removal of four organic compounds, and the removal efficiency of volatile fatty acids and alcohols in the best co-culture case was increased by 22.70% compared to that of pure cultures. Butanol and butyric acid were much more difficult for microalgae and bacteria to remove than were acetic acid and ethanol. The co-cultures of  Chlorella sorokiniana  L3 with  Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila  or  Chryseobacterium scophthalmus  had the highest removal efficiencies for the four organic compounds in all treatments. The co-cultures of  Chlorella sorokiniana  L3 with  Exiguobacterium aurantiacum ,  Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila  or  Chryseobacterium scophthalmus  promoted not only chlorophyll a\u202f+\u202fb production but also biomass accumulation of  Chlorella sorokiniana  L3 during the 3\u202fdays of cultivation compared with those in pure cultures. More than 77.8% of NH 4  + -N, 45.6% of total PO 4  3\u2212 -P and 63.7% of COD (chemical oxygen demand) were removed in all co-cultures. These three bacteria are potential candidates for wastewater treatment through co-culture with microalgae.",

In general, microbubbles could improve mass transfer and photo bio-reaction. For microalgae cultures with large particle sizes or high biomass concentration, the mixing ability of microbubbles was weakened, and therefore, the culture efficiency decreased. However, this can be improved by using millimeter bubbles with the strong turbulent characteristic. Therefore, a multiscale bubble combination intake method was proposed. This method can significantly strengthen both the multiphase mixture and mass transfer processes and was beneficial to improving the growth efficiency of Chlorella.",

The purpose of this paper is to find out the correlation between advisors\u2019 academic characteristics and advisees\u2019 academic performance in Computer Science. Employing both quantitative and qualitative analysis, we find that with the increase of advisors\u2019 academic age, advisees\u2019 performance experiences an initial growth, follows a sustaining stage, and finally ends up with a declining trend. We also discover the phenomenon that accomplished advisors can bring up skilled advisees. We explore the conclusion from two aspects: (1) Advisees mentored by advisors with high academic level have better academic performance than the rest; (2) Advisors with high academic level can raise their advisees\u2019 h-index ranking. This work provides new insights on promoting our understanding of the relationship between advisors\u2019 academic characteristics and advisees\u2019 performance, as well as on advisor choosing.",

        "title": "VISOS: A Visual Interactive System for Spatial-Temporal Exploring Station Importance Based on Subway Data.",
        "abstract": "In urban cities, multiple intelligent transportation systems generate a large amount of traffic data. Researchers can make well use of these data to provide solutions for solving numerous existing traffic problems, such as traffic congestions and urban transportation resource allocating. Thus, it is meaningful and feasible for traffic researchers to collect these data and analyze the concealed human mobility based on them. In this paper, we propose a visual interactive subway system (VISOS). The system incorporates subway data visualization module, spatial\u2013temporal exploration module, and station clustering module. VISOS utilizes    $k$   -means clustering algorithm to explore the subway data interactively, analyze human mobility pattern responsively, and identify functional characteristics of subway stations precisely. In addition, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive spatial\u2013temporal exploration based on the real Shanghai subway data to analyze the importance level of subway stations.",

        "title": "Shared Subway Shuttle Bus Route Planning Based on Transport Data Analytics.",
        "abstract": "The development requirements of shared buses are extremely urgent to alleviate urban traffic congestions by improving road resource utilization and to provide a neotype transportation mode with good user experiences. The key to shared bus implementation lies in accurately predicting travel requirements and planning dynamic routes. However, the sparseness and the high volatility of shared bus data bring a great resistance to accurate prediction of travel requirements. Based on the consideration of user experiences, optimization objectives of shared bus route planning are significantly different from traditional public transportation and shared bus route planning is far more challenging than online car-hailing services due to the relatively high number of passengers. In this paper, we put forward a two-stage approach (SubBus), which is composed of travel requirement prediction and dynamic routes planning, based on various crowdsourced shared bus data to generate dynamic routes for shared buses in the \u201clast mile\u201d scene. First, we analyze the resident travel behaviors to obtain five predictive features, such as flow, time, week, location, and bus, and utilize them to predict travel requirements accurately based on a machine learning model. Second, we design a dynamic programming algorithm to generate dynamic, optimal routes with fixed destinations for multiple operating buses utilizing prediction results based on operating characteristics of shared buses. Extensive experiments are performed on real crowdsourced shared subway shuttle bus data and demonstrate that SubBus outperforms other methods on dynamic route planning for the \u201clast mile\u201d scene.  Note to Practitioners \u2014This paper is inspired by the problem of shared subway shuttle bus dynamic route planning for the \u201clast mile\u201d scene, and it is also applicable to other scenes, including commuting scenes, urban transportation hub scenes, and destination scenes of the tourist market. Shared bus operation routes at such scenes are usually aimed at trips with fixed destinations. Existing approaches to planning routes are generally designed for traditional transportation, such as traditional buses and taxis. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage dynamic route planning approach (SubBus) based on the operation characteristics of shared subway shuttle buses. We perform a resident travel behavior analysis to improve the accuracy of travel requirement prediction. After that, we combine the prediction results and station properties to gain shared bus optimal routes. We then display how to apply SubBus to optimize shared bus operation status based on crowdsourced shared subway shuttle bus data generated by Panda Bus Company. We keep a continuous collaboration with the company to optimize the approach details and experimental effects, which demonstrate that our approach can generate effective routes for shared subway shuttle buses to optimize operation status on the \u201clast mile\u201d issue.",

Theoretical studies predicted that introduction of a kind of sp(3)-type defects formed by OH groups is an effective pathway to achieve this goal [Boukhvalov, D. W. &Katsnelson, M. I. ACS Nano 5, 2440-2446 (2011)]. Here we demonstrate that OH groups can efficiently induce robust magnetic moments on the basal plane of the graphene sheet. We show that the inducing efficiency can reach as high as 217 \u03bcB per 1000 OH groups. More interestingly, the magnetic moments are robust and can survive even at 900\u00b0C. Our findings highlight the importance of OH group as an effective sp(3)-type candidate for inducing robust magnetic moments on the basal plane of the graphene sheet.",

        "abstract": "Inducing magnetic moments in graphene is very important for its potential application in spintronics. Introducing sp\u00b3-defects on the graphene basal plane is deemed as the most promising approach to produce magnetic graphene. However, its universal validity has not been very well verified experimentally. By functionalization of approximately pure amino groups on graphene basal plane, a spin-generalization efficiency of ~1 &mu;/100 NH\u2082 was obtained for the first time, thus providing substantial evidence for the validity of inducing magnetic moments by sp\u00b3-defects. As well, amino groups provide another potential sp\u00b3-type candidate to prepare magnetic graphene.",

The S doping introduce more functional groups on the C sp skeleton of S-3 sample and result in the appearance of the strong absorption band in the UV region. In comparison with other reported S-GQDs, the S-GQDs exhibit overwhelming high fluorescence quantum yield (57%) and excitation-independent emission, resulting from the outcome of the doped sulfur atoms. Moreover, the PL intensity of GQDs can be increased by doping it with S and the increasing efficiency depends on the thiophene sulfur content.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nitrogen-enriched graphene was fabricated via a facile strategy. Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets and graphene oxide quantum dots (GQDs) were used as a structure-directing agent and in situ activating agent, respectively, after photoreduction under NH 3  atmosphere. The combination of photoreduction and NH 3  not only reduced GO and GQD composites (GO/GQDs) within a shorter duration but also doped a high level of nitrogen on the composites (NrGO/GQDs). The nitrogen content of NrGO/GQDs reached as high as 18.86 at% within 5\u00a0min of irradiation. Benefiting from the nitrogen-enriched GO/GQDs hybrid structure, GQDs effectively prevent the agglomeration of GO sheets and increased the numbers of ion channels in the material. Meanwhile, the high levels of nitrogen improved electrical conductivity and strengthened the binding energy between GQD and GO sheets. Compared with reduced GO and low nitrogen-doped reduced GO, NrGO/GQD electrodes exhibited better electrochemical characteristics with a high specific capacitance of 344\u00a0F\u00a0g \u22121  at a current density of 0.25\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121 . Moreover, the NrGO/GQD electrodes exhibited 82% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles at a current density of 0.8\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121  in 6\u00a0M KOH electrolyte. More importantly, the NrGO/GQD electrodes deliver a high energy density of 43\u00a0Wh\u00a0kg \u22121  at a power density of 417\u00a0W\u00a0kg \u22121  in 1\u00a0M Li 2 SO 4  electrolyte. The nitrogen-doped graphene and corresponding supercapacitor presented in this study are novel materials with potential applications in advanced energy storage systems.",

Photocatalytic activity of the obtained S-GQD/TiO 2  nanocomposite reaches 70% in 8\u00a0min; this activity is significantly enhanced compared with those of GQDs/TiO 2  and pure TiO 2 . Improved UV light absorption and effective transfer of photogenerated electrons can be attributed to integration of S-GQDs with TiO 2  in a cladding manner.

The as-prepared N-HCNTs/rGO are directly employed as binder-free supercapacitor electrodes, and exhibit a highly conductive 3D-interconnected structure (5.85\u202fS\u202fcm \u22121 ), large surface area (528.9\u202fm 2 \u202fg \u22121 ), low internal resistance (0.5\u202f\u03a9), and good wettability. As a result, N-HCNTs/rGO show high specific capacitance (368\u202fF\u202fg \u22121 ), high energy density (12.8\u202fWh kg \u22121 ), and cycling stability (90.7% retention at 1\u202fA\u202fg \u22121  for 5000 cycles) in two-electrode systems. Moreover, the 3D N-HCNTs/rGO hybrid networks exhibit enhanced electrochemical performance in supercapacitors, which combine the synergistic effects of the two carbon nanostructures, enhanced wettability, low internal resistance, and improved ion-diffusion ability, together with the large surface areas of 3D hybrid networks and high-level N-doping.

It is notable that the reduction and nitrogen doping of graphene are simultaneously achieved by irradiation, and the nitrogen content of NGO could reach as high as 12.34\u00a0at.% within only 5\u00a0min. With further prolonging the irradiation time to 120\u00a0min, it could reach a very high value of 17.21\u00a0at.%. The electrical properties of NGO thin films were investigated. The results showed that, compared to irradiation of GO films in Ar atmosphere, irradiation in NH3 atmosphere is much more effective to improve the electrical conductivity. It may attribute to the nitrogen doping and oxygen reduction, both of which can effectively enhance the electrical conductivity.",

In this work, we shall address this open issue. More precisely, we prove for the first time that the time-fractional phase field models indeed admit an energy dissipation law of an integral type. In the discrete level, we propose a class of finite difference schemes that can inherit the theoretical energy stability. Our discussion covers the time-fractional gradient systems, including the time-fractional Allen-Cahn equation, the time-fractional Cahn-Hilliard equation, and the time-fractional molecular beam epitaxy models. Numerical examples are presented to confirm the theoretical results. Moreover, a numerical study of the coarsening rate of random initial states depending on the fractional parameter $alpha$ reveals that there are several coarsening stages for both time-fractional Cahn-Hilliard equation and time-fractional molecular beam epitaxy model, while there exists a $-alpha/3$ power law coarsening stage.",

The\nsystem describes a cap-like hot zone of fluid rising from the bottom, while the\nedges of the cap lag behind, forming eye-like vortices. The hot liquid is\ndriven by the buoyancy and meanwhile attracted by the vortices, which leads to\nthe singularity-forming mechanism in our simulation. In the previous 2D\nBoussinesq simulations, the symmetricial initial data is used. However, it is\nobserved that the adoption of symmetry leads to coordinate singularity.\nMoreover, as demonstrated in this work that the locations of peak values for\nthe vorticity and the temperature gradient becomes far apart as $t$ approaches\nthe predicted blow-up time. This suggests that the symmetry assumption may be\nunreasonable for searching solution blow-ups. One of the main contributions of\nthis work is to propose an appropriate asymmetric initial condition, which\navoids coordinate singularity and also makes the blow-up to occur much earlier\nthan that given by the previously simulations. The shorter simulation time\nsuppresses the development of the round-off error. On the numerical side, the\npseudo-spectral method with filtering technique is adopted. The resolutions\nadopted in this study vary from $1024^2$, $2048^2$, $4096^2$ to $6144^2$. With\nour proposed asymmetric initial condition, it is shown that the $4096^2$ and\n$6144^2$ runs yield convergent results when $t$ is fairly close to the\npredicted blow-up time. Moreover, as expected the locations of peak values for\nthe vorticity and the temperature gradient are very close to each other as $t$\napproaches the predicted blow-up time.",

For any given point, we give a sufficient and necessary condition such that the solutions are Ck smooth in some neighborhood of this point. We also study the characteristics of the equations which play important roles in our analysis. It is shown that there are only two kinds of characteristics, one never touches the singularity point, but the other one touches the singularity point in a finite time. Based on these results, we study the global structure of the set of singularity points for the solutions. It is shown that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the path connected components of the set of singularity points and path connected component of the set {(Dg(y),H(Dg(y)))| y \u2208 \u211dn}\\ {(Dg(y), conv H(Dg(y)))| y \u2208 \u211dn}, where conv, H is the convex hull of H.

        "abstract": "We consider numerical methods for solving the fractional-in-space Allen\u2013Cahn equation which contains small perturbation parameters and strong nonlinearity. A standard fully discretized scheme for this equation is considered, namely, using the conventional second-order Crank\u2013Nicolson scheme in time and the second-order central difference approach in space. For the resulting nonlinear scheme, we propose a nonlinear iteration algorithm, whose unique solvability and convergence can be proved. The nonlinear iteration can avoid inverting a dense matrix with only (mathcal {O}(Nlog N)) computation complexity. One major contribution of this work is to show that the numerical solutions satisfy discrete maximum principle under reasonable time step constraint. Based on the maximum stability, the nonlinear energy stability for the fully discrete scheme is established, and the corresponding error estimates are investigated. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the theoretical results.",

However, in practical use, the assumption of complex Wishart distribution is often not respected, particularly in heterogeneous urban areas. In addition, as a simple smoothing filter, the rectangle-shaped window is often shown to be easy to incur false edge pixels near true edges. Therefore, its performance is limited. To overcome this restriction, we propose a new edge detector for PolSAR images, which utilizes the spherically invariant random vector product model to estimate the normalized covariance matrix for each pixel, and then replace the rectangle-shaped filter with a Gauss-shaped filter. The performance of our proposed methodology is presented and analyzed on two real PolSAR data sets, and the results show that the new edge detector attains better performance than the classic one, particularly for urban areas.",

        "abstract": "Multiple-component model-based decompositions (MCSMs) of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data often exhibit overestimation of volume scattering power, which makes the oriented built-up areas show volume scattering rather than double-bounce scattering. Deorientation processing has been incorporated into the three- and four-component decomposition algorithms to overcome this limitation, where the coherency matrix is rotated to minimise the cross-polarised term. However, even with the deorientation, some urban areas with large orientation angles are still misjudged as vegetation. In this study, the performance of deorientation processing on the MCSM is discussed and then an improved polarimetric model-based decomposition method for PolSAR urban areas is proposed, which is inspired by Sato's decomposition method. Since the cross-polarised HV scattering component is caused not only by vegetation but also by oriented buildings, the volume scattering model of original multiple-component decomposition is extended to describe the HV scattering from these two different land covers. A general volume scattering model is adopted to describe the HV scattering from vegetated areas while the orientation angle of built-up areas is adaptively considered for modelling the HV scattering from oriented buildings. Experiments with the phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar data demonstrate that the authors' proposed method can get better decomposition results over urban areas than other methods.",

Nonstationarity in azimuth direction is already utilized to separate man-made and natural targets in urban areas. However, there are still some drawbacks. Some small man-made targets and roads cannot be effectively detected. In addition, nonstationarity can also occur in some other natural surfaces, such as cropland with Bragg resonance. Therefore, to resolve these problems, we incorporate reflection asymmetry into the azimuth nonstationarity extraction method to improve the man-made target detection accuracy, i.e., removing the natural areas and detecting the small targets. Airborne ESAR data and spaceborne PALSAR data are used to validate the performance of the proposed method. The result obtained by our proposed method shows a 20% higher accuracy than the result based on original nonstationarity extraction method. Natural areas with Bragg resonance are removed. Moreover, most of the buildings and some metallic fences along the road can also be accurately detected.",

This paper proposes a new urban extraction method for PolSAR data. First, a multiple-component model-based decomposition method, which was previously proposed by us, is applied to detect the urban areas using the scattering powers. Second, with the sub-aperture decomposition, a new average polarimetric coherence coefficient ratio is proposed to discriminate the urban and natural areas. Finally, these two preliminary detection results are fused on the decision level to improve the overall detection accuracy. We validate our method using one dataset acquired with the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) system. Experimental results demonstrate that the decomposed scattering powers and the proposed polarimetric coherence coefficient ratio are both capable of distinguishing urban areas from natural areas with accuracy about 83.1% and 80.1%, respectively. The overall detection accuracy can further increase to 86.9% with the fusion of two detection results.",

With Bayes theory, the ratio of the probability density functions (PDFs) in the target and background areas contributes to the saliency. Local and global background areas lead to different saliency measures, i.e., local saliency and global saliency, which are combined to make a final saliency measure. To measure the saliency of targets of different sizes, multiscale saliency enhancement is conducted with different region sizes of target and background areas. After collecting all of the salient regions in the image, the result is refined by considering the image\u2019s immediate context. The saliency of regions that are far away from the focus of attention is suppressed. Experimental results with two single-polarization and two multi-polarization SAR images demonstrate that the proposed method has better speckle noise robustness, higher accuracy, and more stability in saliency map generation both with and without the complex background than state-of-the-art methods. The saliency map accuracy can achieve above 95% with four datasets, which is about 5\u201320% higher than other methods.",

        "abstract": "The effects of ball milling on the hydrogen sorption kinetics and microstructure of ZrTiCo have been systematically studied. Kinetic measurements show that the hydrogenation rate and amount of ZrTiCo decrease with increasing the ball milling time. However, the dehydrogenation rate accelerates as the ball milling time increases. Meanwhile, the disproportionation of ZrTiCo speeds up after ball milling and the disproportionation kinetics is clearly inclined to be linear with time at 500\u00b0C. It is found from X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) results that the lattice parameter of ZrTiCo gradually decreases from 3.164\u2009\u00c5 to 3.153\u2009\u00c5 when the ball milling time extends from 0\u2009h to 8\u2009h, which is mainly responsible for the hydrogen absorption/desorption behaviors. In addition, scanning electron microscope (SEM) images demonstrate that the morphology of ZrTiCo has obviously changed after ball milling, which is closely related to the hydrogen absorption kinetics. Besides, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images show that a large number of disordered microstructures including amorphous regions and defects exist after ball milling, which also play an important role in hydrogen sorption performances. This work will provide some insights into the principles of how to further improve the hydrogen sorption kinetics and disproportionation property of ZrTiCo.",

It was found that the conversion of LiH\u00a0+\u00a0MgB 2  into LiBH 4 \u00a0+\u00a0MgH 2  was rapidly completed in \u223c15\u00a0min under 7\u00a0MPa H 2  at 673\u00a0K. Meanwhile, LiBH 4  was successfully separated from MgH 2  using MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) as solvent. Kinetics analysis results not only suggested that the rate limiting step during formation process of LiBH 4  from LiH\u00a0+\u00a0MgB 2  is nucleation/growth controlled but also indicated that the formation process of LiBH 4  is probably controlled by heterogeneous nucleation and one-direction growth. Our kinetics analysis result provides a plausible explanation for the significantly kinetic enhancement of transition metal halides or oxides in the Li-Mg-B-H hydrogen storage system.",

SMSI in Pt/CeO 2 , Pt/Ce 0.7 Zr 0.3 O 2  and single atom S-Pt/Ce 0.7 Zr 0.3 O 2  catalysts were studied by in situ Raman spectroscopy and H 2  Temperature-Programmed Reduction. Evidence of SMSI in Pt/CeO 2  and Pt/Ce 0.7 Zr 0.3 O 2  that improve the reduction properties of supports other than H 2  dissociation and spillover is obtained. It was also found that Pt-O and Pt-O-Ce bonding in the said catalysts play an important role in SMSI. The Pt bonding could be ascribed to Pt oxides species (Pt 1\u00a0+  and Pt 2\u00a0+ ) with different Pt adsorption sites on CeO 2  surface and which act as intermediates in reduction process. This gives a new insight into the SMSI and explains the observed Pt/CeO 2  reduction characteristics.",

The phase transition from ZrCo 2 \u2013ZrH 2  to ZrCo for reproportionation was clearly observed without vacuum pumping. It was shown that the reproportionation could take place even under hydrogen pressure of 0.65\u00a0bar at 640\u00a0\u00b0C. In addition, the reproportionation behaviors under different initial hydrogen pressures were investigated and the onset boundary for reproportionation was successfully established. The original insight into the unusual reproportionation phenomenon reveals that there is a stable region for ZrCo under hydrogen atmosphere at high temperature. On the basis of this work, it is hopeful that the application of ZrCo at high temperature will be substantially broadened.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The thermodynamically and kinetically stable regions of the temperature\u2013H 2  pressure phase boundaries for the ZrCo H system were established using the Temperature-Concentration-Isobar (TCI) method. Based on this, the enthalpy change and entropy change values of dehydrogenation and disproportionation reactions were successfully obtained. The average enthalpy change (\u0394H) and entropy change (\u0394S) estimated from the phase boundaries for dehydrogenation of ZrCoH 3  to ZrCo are respectively 103.07\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol \u22121 H 2  and 148.85\u00a0J\u00a0mol \u22121  H 2  K \u22121 , which are well agreement with the data reported in literature. The average \u0394H and \u0394S were estimated to be \u2212120.91\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol \u22121 H 2  and -149.32\u00a0J\u00a0mol \u22121  H 2  K \u22121  for the disproportionation of ZrCoH 3 , whereas the \u0394H and \u0394S were calculated to be \u221284.6\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol \u22121 H 2  and -92.29\u00a0J\u00a0mol \u22121  H 2  K \u22121  for disproportionation of ZrCo. In addition, it was found from the established phase boundaries that the anti-disproportionation property of ZrCo alloy can be enhanced if the phase boundaries of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation are far away from the phase boundaries of disproportionation by adjusting the thermodynamics. Meanwhile, it is possible to keep ZrCo away from disproportionation even at high temperature of 650\u00a0\u00b0C under hydrogen atmosphere, if the temperature-H 2  pressure trajectory is carefully controlled without crossing the phase boundaries of disproportionation. Therefore, the established phase boundaries can be used as a guide to the eye avoiding disproportionation and improving the anti-disproportionation property of ZrCo alloy.",

The separations were conducted by the FDC procedure with characteristics of the feed gas one-time flushing though the column and then reasonable separation performance had been obtained. The results indicate that the FDC process could be applied to deal with the desorbed gas mixtures from TES and/or further to extract and thereafter enrich the breeding tritium in ITER or CFETR, which would take the advantages of system compactness and efficiency over the present route of TES. Comparing to other related displacement chromatography procedures, the FDC process could be applied in tritium pre-enrichment for the mixtures of low tritium concentrations, which is highlighted by the outstanding merit of operation simplicity.",

        "abstract": "The effects of ball milling on the hydrogen sorption kinetics and microstructure of Zr0.8Ti0.2Co have been systematically studied. Kinetic measurements show that the hydrogenation rate and amount of Zr0.8Ti0.2Co decrease with increasing the ball milling time. However, the dehydrogenation rate accelerates as the ball milling time increases. Meanwhile, the disproportionation of Zr0.8Ti0.2Co speeds up after ball milling and the disproportionation kinetics is clearly inclined to be linear with time at 500\u00b0C. It is found from X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) results that the lattice parameter of Zr0.8Ti0.2Co gradually decreases from 3.164\u2009A to 3.153\u2009A when the ball milling time extends from 0\u2009h to 8\u2009h, which is mainly responsible for the hydrogen absorption/desorption behaviors. In addition, scanning electron microscope (SEM) images demonstrate that the morphology of Zr0.8Ti0.2Co has obviously changed after ball milling, which is closely related to the hydrogen absorption kinetics. Besides, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images show that a large number of disordered microstructures including amorphous regions and defects exist after ball milling, which also play an important role in hydrogen sorption performances. This work will provide some insights into the principles of how to further improve the hydrogen sorption kinetics and disproportionation property of Zr0.8Ti0.2Co.",

Experimental measurements show that the hydrogen absorption rate and hydrogenation amount decrease for ZrCo by increasing the ball milling time, while the hydrogen desorption rate increases. After ball milling, the disproportionation rate of ZrCo is enhanced, whereas the disproportionation extent is reduced. It is found from X-ray powder diffraction results that the lattice parameter of ZrCo gradually decreases from 3.197\u2009A to 3.188\u2009A when the ball milling time extends from 0 h to 8\u2009h, which is mainly responsible for the disproportionation behavior. Meanwhile, scanning electron microscope and Focused Ion Beam images demonstrate that the morphology of ZrCo obviously changes after ball milling, which is closely related to the hydrogen sorption kinetics. Furthermore, the energy dispersive spectroscopy results reveal that the composition of ZrCo and distribution of Zr and Co elements play an important role in the disproportionation rate as well as the kinetic mechanism. Kinetic model analysis suggests that the disproportionation of ZrCo should be nucleation and growth process. However, the detailed rate limiting modes for nucleation and growth processes may vary according to different ball milling time. This study can provide valuable considerations for further improving the hydrogen storage properties of ZrCo on the basis of disclosed relationship between the kinetic performances and the characteristics of microstructure for ZrCo after ball milling.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Accurate tritium transport properties of prospective tritium permeation barriers (TPBs) are essential to tritium systems in fusion reactors. By passing a temperature and rate-controlled sweeping gas over specimen surfaces to carry the permeated tritium to an ion chamber, the gas-driven permeation of tritium has been performed on 321 type stainless steel containers with Al 2 O 3 /FeAl barriers, to determine the T-permeation resistant performance and mechanism of the barrier. The tritium permeability of the Al 2 O 3 /FeAl coated container was reduced by 3 orders of magnitude at 500\u2013700\u00a0\u00b0C by contrast with that of the bare one, which meets the requirement of the tritium permeation reduction factor (PRF) of TPBs for tritium operating components in the CN-HCCB TBM. The Al 2 O 3 /FeAl barrier resists the tritium permeation by the diffusion in the bulk substrate at a limited number of defect sites with an effective area and thickness, suggesting that the TPB quality is a very important factor for efficient T-permeation resistance.",

        "abstract": "Little is known about hydrogen-vacancy interactions and their contributions to hydrogen embrittlement (HE) in iron aluminides. H-induced vacancy formation, stability and clusterization of hydrogen-vacancy complexes (VFeHn) in B2-FeAl were studied via density functional theory (DFT) and thermodynamic formalism. The presence of an interstitial H atom in FeAl forms superabundant Fe-vacancies. The H atoms are more likely to be trapped around the Fe-vacancies than diffuse from one octahedral interstitial site to another. One Fe-vacancy can trap at most six H atoms to form VFeHn complexes with H atoms occupying the six first-nearest-neighbor (1NN) Oct2Fe\u20134Al sites of VFe one by one; the H\u2013H distances are 1.920\u20132.785 A. The VFeH6 complex is the major complex under ambient conditions and prefers to grow larger by clusterization of V2FeH12 units along \u3008100\u3009 and {100} with internal H2 molecules closely associated with the crack along the {100} planes. Thus we propose a mechanism of isotropic hydrogenated vacancy-cluster induced HE: hydrogen addition-induced isotropic V2FeH12\u3008100\u3009 clusters of line and planar shapes are embryos for the formation of cracks and H2 bubbles. This grows ever bigger as a function of H concentration and eventually leads to the macroscopic failure observed experimentally.",

Specifically, depending on the O-condition, the possible defect types, the dominant defects and the defect formation energies will be altered in \u03b1-Al2O3 after Cr doping. Generally speaking, Cr is favorable for the formation of Schottky defects, Frenkel defects and antisite pairs, giving a different insight to the defect process in \u03b1-Al2O3.",

        "abstract": "To probe the interaction of H and He, produced by tritium decay, with vacancy-type defects of \u03b1-Al2O3 as a tritium permeation barrier (TPB) in fusion reactors, \u03b1-Al2O3 single crystals were treated in pure Ar gas, D2 gas and T2 gas with subsequent tritium aging, respectively, and then their positron annihilation lifetimes and the type of defects that may contribute to the observed positron lifetime components were studied, in combination with DFT results. More monovacancies and vacancy clusters were formed in the thermally hydrogenated samples when compared to the fresh and Ar-annealed samples, indicating the stabilizing effect of hydrogen; this was consistent with the Fermi level position of \u03b1-Al2O3 moving towards the conduction band minimum (CBM) in the presence of hydrogen impurities, resulting in VAl3\u2212 and [VAl3\u2212\u2013H+]2\u2212 becoming more stable, as observed by DFT calculations. The monovacancies were slightly eliminated when the samples were thermally annealed and then aged in T2 gas at room temperature, indicating that He filled the vacancies. This was consistent with it being favourable for He atoms to occupy Al vacancies, with HeAl3\u2212 forming most readily, whilst more vacancy clusters were continuously induced, suggesting that Al\u2013O bonds weakened and thus nano-hardness decreased with an external load. This study provides the first evidence that Al vacancies can be stabilized by H and filled with He, which will provide further novel TPB design opportunities.",

When the areal density (the number of H atoms per the cross-sectional area of the SF) of the trapped H is as high as 5.9 \u00d7 1015 atoms per cm2, hydrogen recombines into molecules. With further increasing trapped H atoms, H bubbles grow gradually, yielding a hydrogen pressure of 3.4 GPa and strikingly elongating Al\u2013Al bonds near the SF by 70% which implies the initiation of a crack, and eventually leads to a macroscopic fracture and crack of {100} type observed experimentally with the build-up of high pressures of hydrogen gases.

The results reveal that the evolution of the Ti addition in doped NaAlH 4  is Ti 3+ \u00a0\u2192\u00a0amorphous Ti 0 \u00a0\u2192\u00a0Al Ti species\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Al 3 Ti intermetallic. TEM results show that the average particle size of the Al Ti species and Al 3 Ti intermetallic is about 30\u00a0nm, and Ti element is uniformly distributed in Al matrix. In further, we discussed the catalytic mechanism and role of active species in Ti doped NaAlH 4  system according to experimental and theoretical calculation. The rehydrogenation process of Ti doped NaAlH 4  system can be divided into three steps: (1) H 2  dissociation, (2) H atom spillover and alanes (Al x H y ) formation and (3) complex hydrides formation. The addition of Ti can catalyze the process of H 2  dissociation, H atom spillover and formation of alanes. More importantly, the current work may provide a general approach to investigate the catalytic mechanism of other doped complex hydrides for hydrogen storage system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Thermodynamics, kinetics and selectivity of H 2  and D 2  on zeolite 5A have been investigated by isotherm adsorption/desorption and thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) at temperatures below 77\u202fK. The experimental adsorption isotherms show an increasing amount of gas adsorbed with decreasing temperature from 77\u202fK to 30\u202fK, and D 2 /H 2  adsorption ratio is slightly larger than 1. In addition, the enthalpy of D 2  ( \u0394H ) adsorption obtained from adsorption isotherms is for different uptakes always larger than for H 2  indicating a stronger D 2  adsorption. The kinetics of H 2  adsorption/desorption is faster than of D 2  at different temperatures (30\u201350\u202fK), pressures (10-400\u202fmbar) and gas composition due to the faster H 2  self-diffusion in zeolite 5A at low temperature. Furthermore, D 2 /H 2  selectivity increases gradually and reaches a constant value with increasing loading time and pressure, and it is 8.83, 6.42, 4.98, 3.96 and 4.04\u202fat 30, 35, 40, 50 and 60\u202fK at 50\u202fmbar, respectively. The D 2 /H 2  separation in zeolite 5A is controlled by the thermodynamic equilibrium of adsorption under the experimental conditions applied here. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the hydrogen isotope selectivity of zeolite 5A at temperatures below 77\u202fK.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To evaluate the alloy Ti 0.3 V 0.4 Cr 0.3  as a candidate material for hydrogen isotope separation, the separation factor ( \u03b1  H\u2212D ), which is usually used to characterize the hydrogen isotope effects in metal-hydrogen systems, was investigated. We focused on the dependence of  \u03b1  H\u2212D  on pressure, deuterium concentration, and temperature. The results indicated that the dependence of  \u03b1  H\u2212D  on pressure was insensitive. However,  \u03b1  H\u2212D  decreased with deuterium concentration, and the dependence was characterized quantitatively. The dependence of  \u03b1  H\u2212D  on temperature was complicated. The experimental results agree well with the harmonic oscillator model (HOM) in 213\u00a0K\u00a0 T  T  \u03b1  H\u2212D  was 2.31\u00a0at 213\u00a0K. Thus, the alloy Ti 0.3 V 0.4 Cr 0.3  may be a hopeful candidate, or a potential substitute of Pd, for hydrogen isotope separation.",

The results show that hydrogen isotope desorption/absorption kinetics of NaAlH x D 4\u2212x  is enhanced with increasing the hydrogen concentration. In addition, NaAlH x D 4\u2212x  exhibits kinetics isotope effect during both hydrogen isotope desorption and absorption processes, and the isotope effect keeps stable during cycling. Our study may enable NaAlH 4  to be used as hydrogen isotope separation material in future based on its kinetics isotope effect.",

In the current study, hydrophobic carbon-supported platinum catalysts (Pt/C/PTFE) with high efficiency as reported previously for LPCE were prepared and comprehensive performance evaluation method is applied to evaluate the separation behaviors of LPCE systematically. Experimental results indicate that the optimum reaction temperature of 60\u201380\u202f\u00b0C and the molar feed ratio  G / L  of 1.5\u20132.5 would lead to higher separation efficiencies. As to the packing method, a random packing mode with a packing ratio of hydrophobic catalysts 0.25 is recommended. In addition, thermodynamic analysis corresponds well with experimental results under lower temperature and  G / L , while the suppression of kinetic factors should not be neglected when  T \u202fu003e\u202f80\u202f\u00b0C and  G / L \u202fu003e\u202f1.5.",

        "abstract": "Little is known about hydrogen interaction with helium, an extrinsic defect, present in \u03b1-Al2O3 TPBs due to tritium decay and (n, a) reaction. Using density functional theory (DFT), the stability, structure and diffusion of He-related complexes at the different positions (VAl(3-), V, Oi(2-) and octahedral interstitial sites (OISs)) in \u03b1-Al2O3, as well as the interactions with H, are determined under H2-rich conditions. A He atom favors occupation of Al vacancies, the centers of OISs or forms a dumbbell around Al vacancies, forming Hei, HeAl(3-), Hei-HeAl(3-), [V-Hei](0) and [Oi(2-)-He](2-) complexes, among of which HeAl(3-) forms most readily. VAl(3-) can attract He to form small stable He-HeAl(3-) clusters, whereas only a He atom is trapped by an OIS, V and Oi(2-). Hei is more likely to diffuse into VAl(3-) and V than diffuse along the c-axis from one OIS to another. Hi(+) trapping into HeAl(3-) and [V-Hei](0) is thermodynamically and kinetically feasible, whereas dissociation of [Hei-H(+)](+) is more feasible. Forms of H-He complex defects in \u03b1-Al2O3 are Hei, Hi(+), [Hei-H(+)](+), [HeAl(3-)-H(+)](2-) and [HO(+)-Hei](+). HeAl(3-) and [V-Hei](0) present will increase the activation energy of H migration in \u03b1-Al2O3, which is favored for low H transport of TPBs.",

From the total energy calculation, the lowest-energy crystal structure of PuOH is predicted to have space group     F    4  \u00af    3  m     (No. 216). Within the LDA+U framework, the calculated lattice parameter of     F    4  \u00af    3  m    -PuOH is in good agreement with the experimental value and the corresponding ground state is predicted to be an antiferromagnetic charge-transfer insulator. Furthermore, we investigate the bonding character of PuOH by analyzing the electron structure and find that there are a stronger Pu-O bond and a weaker Pu-H bond. The mechanical properties including the elastic constants, elastic moduli and Debyeu0027s temperature, and the optical properties including the reflectivity and absorption coefficient are also calculated. We then compute the phonon spectrum which verified the dynamical stability of     F    4  \u00af    3  m    -PuOH. Some thermodynamic quantities such as the specific heat are evaluated. Finally we calculate the formation energy of PuOH, and the reaction energies for the oxidation of PuOH and PuOH-coated Pu, which are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values.",

The optimized crystal structure of -U was found to have the space group Pbnm, which was proposed in the earlier Landau-type theory and is isostructural with the \u03b1-Np structure. In particular, the changes in the lattice parameters of Pbnm-U with respect to \u03b1-U are consistent with the experimental observations. In addition, the energetic stability of Pbnm-U with respect to \u03b1-U was confirmed by enthalpy calculations, and the value of the critical pressure in the pressure-induced quantum transition from Pbnm-U to \u03b1-U is in good agreement with the experimental result. Moreover, the phonon calculation verified the dynamical instability of \u03b1-U and the stability of Pbnm-U. Finally, the calculated electronic structures exhibit features of the CDW state.",

In particular, the finite-size effects and the accuracy of various kinetic energy density functionals are examined. It is demonstrated that as the supercell size increases, the finite-size errors asymptotically decrease as . Notably, the formation energies of self-interstitials converge much more slowly than that of vacancies. With carefully chosen kinetic energy density functionals, the calculated results agree quite well with the available experimental data and those obtained through Kohn\u2013Sham density functional theory, which has an exact kinetic term.",

The strategy was simple, mild, green and efficient. The prepared nanoparticles exhibited a mutually connected, fused irregular nanoparticles in TEM. The as-synthesized Pd PdO-CoO x  (1:4) nanoparticles displayed prominent catalytic activity (5.82 A     m   g   Pd    \u2212  1       for ethylene glycol and 5.16 A     m   g   Pd    \u2212  1       for glycerol) for ethylene glycol and glycerol oxidation reactions in alkaline solution compared to the commercial Pt/C (1.64 A     m   g   Pt    \u2212  1       for ethylene glycol and 1.48 A     m   g   Pt    \u2212  1       for glycerol) catalyst. The improved electrocatalytic activity of Pd PdO-CoO x  catalyst mainly ascribes to the producing Strong Metal-Support Interactions (SMSI) between PdO-CoO x  and Pd nanoparticles, the synergistic effect between PdO and CoO x  and the presence of CoO x  promoved hydroxyl adsorption at lower potentials. Combined with the simple synthetic method, lower cost and good performance, Pd PdO-CoO x  is a promising catalyst for direct fuel cells.",

The key step therefore towards application of BP is the preparation of few-layer or multilayer BP materials. However, because of the high chemical reactivity of BP, the preparation process must be handled with special care to avoid oxidation-induced degradation. Here we introduced a facile and scalable electrochemical method to generate BP nanosheets where BP served as the cathode. Subsequently, the product was characterized by TEM, Raman, UV\u2013Vis, AFM, XPS and FTIR techniques. The relevant characterization data indicated that the thickness of the obtained BP nanosheets was mainly in the range of 2\u20137\u202fnm. Furthermore, oxidation can be completely avoided during this electrochemical cathode exfoliation process, which provided high-quality BP nanosheets.",

Herein, a highly active multifunctional catalyst heterostructure PdO-doped Co 3 O 4  (PdCo-300) nanoparticles with closely mutually connected interfaces were synthesized by a convenient strategy. The prepared PdCo-300 nanoparticles displayed high catalytic activities for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. The results show that the considerable electrocatalytic activities and stabilities are associated with the formation of MHNPs with intimate connected boundary between PdO and Co 3 O 4 . At the interface, the decrease of Pd electron density (downshift of the  d -band center) and the formation of large amount of oxygen vacancies in Co 3 O 4  promoted the electrocatalytic performance. Theoretical calculations show that the synergy of Pd ions and Co ions at the interface can enhance the interaction between active oxygen species and the catalyst surface, resulting in the decrease of energy barrier for ORR.",

The experimental results showed that the isotopic abundance of H in the D-T mixture dropped from 2.7% to an acceptable level of 0.88%. The simulation results showed that a lower porosity ( \u03b8 ) of the filling material made a higher separation factor, but a lower separation efficiency. The velocity of the product gas at the outlet of the separation column approximately had a linear relationship with  \u03b8  5/3 /(1- \u03b8 ) 2 , which partly indicated the pore diffusion resistance. The mixed gas could contact the filling materials more sufficiently under a lower flow rate resulting in a lower protium concentration in the product gas. The separation column with a thin and long shape had a better separation performance and a lower product gas loss.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Accidents at TMI, USA and Fukushima, Japan have emphasized the need for hydrogen mitigation during nuclear plant accidental conditions, especially during severe accidents which will be no power, massive hydrogen, high temperature, long-term operation, and poisoning environment. Passive autocatalytic recombiners with catalyst sheets are the promising way to deal with the situation in severe accidents. Here we report a new kind of catalyst sheets based on stainless steel supported Pd nanoclusters prepared by electroless deposition route. The catalyst sheets were characterised for morphology and composition of surface by SEM and EDS. The catalytic activity of the catalyst sheets has been evaluated under the conditions of higher temperature, long-term operation and poisoning environments. The catalyst sheets showed high activity and good stability either operating above 500\u00a0\u00b0C for 24 h or continuous operating for 25\u00a0days. For the obtained catalyst sheets after exposed to methanal, iodine vapor and BaSO 4  aerosol respectively with corresponding concentrations higher than SA conditions, the start-up time for H 2 -O 2  recombination reaction was less than 1 min and the catalytic efficiency was more than 90%. These results indicate the potential application of this type of catalyst sheets for hydrogen mitigation in severe accidents.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of warfarin on senkyunolide I in a rat model of biliary drainage after oral administration Chuanxiong extract based on pharmacokinetics. Thirty-two rats were randomly divided into four groups: CN, healthy rats after a single administration of Chuanxiong; CO, rats with biliary drainage after a single administration of Chuanxiong; WCN, healthy rats after the administration of Chuanxiong and warfarin; WCO, rats with biliary drainage after the administration of Chuanxiong and warfarin. A series of blood samples were collected at different time points before and after oral administration. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for quantification of the main components of Chuanxiong and methyclothiazide (internal standard) have been established. The validated method was successfully applied to a comparative pharmacokinetics study. After calculated by the DAS 2.1.1 software, the pharmacokinetics parameters of senkyunolide I showed a significant difference between the CN and CO groups, the AUC, and C of CO group increased by 5.45, 4.02 folds, respectively. There was a significant difference between the WCO and WCN groups, the T of WCO group prolonged 67%; compared to the CN group, the AUC, and C of WCN group raised 4.84, 3.49 folds, respectively; the T and C between the CO and WCO groups also showed a significant difference. The drug warfarin significantly affected the senkyunolide I disposition, which partly due to its enterohepatic circulation process in rat plasma after oral administration of Chuanxiong. The present study highlights an urgent evidence for drug-herb interactions.",

The purpose of this study was to identify potential biomarkers in the progression of CRC. MATERIAL AND METHODS Gene and isoform expression datasets of CRC was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). EBSeq of R was used for the normalization of gene and isoform expression, as well as the identification of differential expression genes (DEGs) and isoforms (DEIs) of CRC samples compared with normal samples. The enriched functions of DEGs and DEIs were obtained based on the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). An independent dataset, GSE38832, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for survival analysis of genes with sustained decreased/increased expression values at both gene and isoform levels with the development of CRC. RESULTS A total of 2301 genes and 4241 isoforms were found to be significantly differentially expressed in stage I-IV CRC samples. They are closely associated with muscle or cell system activity. Sixteen genes were screened out with sustained decreased/increased expression values at both gene and isoform levels with the development of CRC. Aberrant CBX8 and CD96 expressions were found to be significantly associated with CRC survival. CONCLUSIONS Through combined analysis of gene and isoform expression profiles, we identified several potential biomarkers that may play an important role in the development of CRC and could be helpful in its early diagnosis and treatment.",

The presented antenna is fabricated on a very thin (only 0.5mm) and low-cost PET substrate (\u03b5r = 3:8, tan \u03b4 = 0:02). The proposed design consists of tow coplanar patches radiation unities which are electrically connected to the metallic ground through two symmetrical shorting walls placed at both edge sides of the patches. Double symmetrical U-shaped slots are etched out to improve the antenna bandwidth. A perfect matching between antenna and tag chip can be easily obtained by varying the geometry parameters of the slots. The simulated bandwidth is about 97 MHz, which covers the Europe and North America UHF RFID frequency range. The measured maximum reading range of the proposed antenna can be up to 5m when the tag is mounted on a metal plate whose size is 150 \u00d7 150 \u00d7 8mm3.",

        "abstract": "As important metabolic enzymes, the function of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) has been demonstrated repeatedly through various means, including heterologous expression systems. Unfortunately, most model systems typically lack expression of a conspecific NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), which is the electron transfer partner of CYPs. As a result, the activities of heterologously expressed insect CYPs may not accurately reflect detoxification activities in vivo. Previously, CYP6B7 from Helicoverpa armigera (H\u00fcbner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) (HaCYP6B7) has been expressed in the Pichia pastoris GS115 strain and shown to detoxify bifenthrin, fenvalerate and chlorpyrifos. However, it remains to be determined if co-expression of HaCYP6B7 with HaCPR will enhance the detoxification ability of the expression system. In the present study, HaCYP6B7 and HaCPR genes were co-expressed in P. pastoris using a reconstituted expression vector, pPICZA-HaCYP6B7-HaCPR. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blot, and the detoxification activities of microsomal fractions to p-nitroanisole O-demethylation (PNOD), 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation (ECOD), fenvalerate and chlorpyrifos were measured. Co-expression of HaCYP6B7 with HaCPR resulted in PNOD and ECOD activities of 1.90 nmol/min/mg\u00b7protein and 12.39 pmol/min/mg\u00b7protein, which were 1.6- and 1.5-fold of that catalyzed by HaCYP6B7 expressed alone, respectively. Furthermore, microsomes of pPICZA-HaCYP6B7-HaCPR-GS115 had higher detoxification activity than that of pPICZA-HaCYP6B7-GS115 to fenvalerate, but not chlorpyrifos. The results indicated that co-expression of HaCYP6B7 with conspecific CPR could enhance the detoxification activities to some substrates comparing with expression of HaCYP6B7 alone.",

The purpose of the present study was to investigate how factors (food availability, temperature and larval development stage) affect cannibalistic tendency in H. armigera under laboratory conditions. The results showed that cannibalism frequency of third instars reared on artificial diets was remarkably lower than that without artificial diets. The mortality was 90.00, 41.67, 38.33, 28.33 and 35.00%, as the amount of 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 0.10\u00a0g/larva of artificial diets at 56\u00a0h of post-treatment, respectively. No significant difference in mortality was observed between treatment of 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00\u00a0g/larva of artificial diets. Cannibalistic behaviour was obviously observed when third instars in groups were housed at four different temperatures including 22, 25, 28 and 31\u00a0\u00b0C.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we describe the formatting guidelines for ACM SIG Proceedings. In order to assure safety of Chinese Train Control System (CTCS), it is necessary to ensure the operational risk is acceptable throughout its life-cycle, which requires a pragmatic risk assessment required for effective risk control. Many risk assessment techniques currently used in railway domain are qualitative, and rely on the experience of experts, which unavoidably brings in subjective judgements. This paper presents a method that combines fuzzy reasoning and analytic hierarchy process approach to quantify the experiences of experts to get the scores of risk parameters. Fuzzy reasoning is used to obtain the risk of system hazard, analytic hierarchy process approach is used to determine the risk level (RL) and its membership of the system. This method helps safety analyst to calculate overall collective risk level of system. A case study of risk assessment of CTCS system is used to demonstrate this method can give quantitative result of collective risks without much information from experts, but can support the risk assessment with risk level and its membership, which are more valuable to guide the further risk management.",

        "abstract": "The study aimed to investigate the correlations of CACNA1C genetic polymorphisms and protein expression with the pathogenesis of schizophrenia in a Chinese population. This research included 139 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (case group) and 141 healthy volunteers (control group). Case and control samples were genotyped using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). Haplotypes of rs10848683, rs2238032, and rs2299661 were analyzed using the Shesis software. A mouse model of schizophrenia was established and assigned to test and blank groups. Western blotting was used to detect CACNA1C protein expression. The genotype and allele distribution of rs2238032 and rs2299661 differed between the case and control groups. TT genotype of rs2238032 and G allele of rs2299661 could potentially reduce the risk of schizophrenia. The distribution of rs2238032 genotype has a close connection with cognitive disturbance and the results of the general psychopathology classification exam. The distribution of rs2299661 genotypes was closely related to sensory and perceptual disorders, negative symptom subscales, and the results of the general psychopathology classification exam. CTC haplotype increased and CTG decreased the risk of schizophrenia in healthy people. In the brain tissues of mice with schizophrenia, the CACNA1C protein expression was higher in the test group than in the blank group. Our study demonstrated that CACNA1C gene polymorphisms and CACNA1C protein expression were associated with schizophrenia and its clinical phenotypes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Using regional homogeneity (ReHo) blood oxygen level-dependent functional MR (BOLD-fMRI), we investigated the structural and functional alterations of brain regions among patients with methamphetamine-associated psychosis (MAP). MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study included 17 MAP patients, 16 schizophrenia (SCZ) patients, and 18 healthy controls. Informed consent was obtained from all patients before the clinical assessment, the severity of clinical symptoms was evaluated prior to the fMRI scanning, and then images were acquired and preprocessed after each participant received 6-min fRMI scanning. The participants all underwent BOLD-fMRI scanning. Voxel-based morphometry was used to measure gray matter density (GMD). Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) was conducted to analyze functional MR, ReHo, and functional connectivity (FC). RESULTS GMD analysis results suggest that MAP patients, SCZ patients, and healthy volunteers show different GMDs within different brain regions. Similarly, the ReHo analysis results suggest that MAP patients, SCZ patients, and healthy volunteers have different GMDs within different brain regions. Negative correlations were found between ReHo- and the PANSS-positive scores within the left orbital interior frontal gyrus (L-orb-IFG) of MAP patients. ReHo- and PANSS-negative scores of R-SFG were negatively correlated among SCZ patients. The abnormal FC of R-MFG showed a negative correlation with the PANSS score among MAP patients. CONCLUSIONS The abnormalities in brain structure and FC were associated with the development of MAP.",

IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 expression levels were detected, and correlations among these factors in different culture groups were analyzed. Pleural fluid mononuclear cells (PFMCs) from tuberculous pleural effusions, but not peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors, spontaneously expressed IFN-\u03b2, IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3. Moreover, exogenous IFN-\u03b2 significantly inhibited the expression of IL-17 in PFMCs. By contrast, IFN-\u03b2 simultaneously enhanced the levels of IFN-\u03b3. To further investigate the regulation of IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 by endogenous IFN-\u03b2, an IFN-\u03b2 neutralizing antibody was simultaneously added to BCG-stimulated PFMCs. IL-17 expression was significantly increased, but IFN-\u03b3 production was markedly decreased in the experimental group supplemented with the IFN-\u03b2 neutralizing antibody. Simultaneously, IL-17 production was remarkably increased in the experimental group supplemented with the IFN-\u03b3 neutralizing antibody. Taken together, in our study, we first found that freshly isolated PFMCs, but not PBMCs from healthy donors, spontaneously expressed IFN-\u03b2, IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 in vivo. Moreover, IFN-\u03b2 suppressed IL-17 expression and increased IFN-\u03b3 production. Furthermore, both IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 downregulated IL-17 expression. These observations suggest that caution is required when basing anti-TB treatment on the inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 signaling.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Colorectal cancer (CRC) arises from accumulated genetic and epigenetic alterations, which provide the possibility to identify tumor-specific biomarkers by analyzing fecal DNA. Methylation status in human genes from tumor tissue is highlighted as promising biomarker in the early detection of CRC. A number of studies have documented altered methylation levels in DNA extracted from stool samples, but generated heterogeneous results. We performed a systematic review and quantitative assessment of existing studies to compare levels of DNA methylation in most frequently studied genes and their diagnostic value in CRC and its precursor, colorectal adenoma, with their counterparts in healthy subjects. Robust searches of the literature were performed in our study with explicit strategies and definite inclusion/exclusion criteria. Pooled data revealed that methylation levels of  SFRP2 ,  SFRP1 ,  TFPI2 ,  BMP3 ,  NDRG4 ,  SPG20 , and  BMP3  plus  NDRG4  genes exceeded a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 80% for CRC detection. The DOR of the seven candidate biomarkers ranged from 19.80 to 334.33, indicating a good diagnostic power in discriminating cancer from normal tissues. The AUC range was from 0.88 to 0.95, indicating a good or very good discriminatory performance. When test results for  BMP3  and  NDRG4  were combined, the DOR of CRC detection was 98.36, which was higher than that for  BMP3  and  NDRG4  separately. As for adenoma detection, the DOR of methylated  NDRG4  is higher than that for CRC (CRC vs. adenoma: 54.86 vs. 57.22). Both the sensitivity and specificity of  NDRG4  for adenoma detection exceeded 70%. These findings demonstrate the eligibility and feasibility of DNA methylation as a minimally invasive biomarker in feces in the diagnosis of CRC and adenoma. The use of DNA from human stools has the potential to be readily applicable to detect aberrant DNA methylation levels among many subjects for CRC early screening.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Objective  The value of additional use of cetuximab with the classical cisplatin, docetaxel and 5-fluorouracil regimen in larynx preservation remains unknown. This study was designed to resolve this issue and appraise its toxicity.    Materials and methods  Thirteen untreated patients with stage III\u2013IV larynx or hypopharynx squamous cell carcinoma were recruited and received two cycles of C\u00a0+\u00a0TPF regimen (cetuximab plus docetaxel, cisplatinand and 5-fluorouracil), followed by one more cycle of C\u00a0+\u00a0TPF and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (70\u00a0Gy). Primary endpoint was larynx preservation (LP) rate at 3\u00a0months. Secondary endpoints were larynx function preservation (LFP) and overall survival (OS) at 12, 36 and 60\u00a0months.    Results  With a two-cycle induction treatment of C\u00a0+\u00a0TPF protocol, four (31%) and nine (69%) patients achieved complete and partial response, respectively. The top three toxicities were dermatitis (9 cases), nausea/vomiting (6 cases), and anemia (4 cases). After the full-course treatment, 12 out of 13 patients (92.3%) obtained LP at 3\u00a0months. This strategy demonstrated relatively high LFP rates of 92.3%, 69.2% and 54.5% and satisfactory OS rates of 100%, 84.6% and 54.5% at 12, 36 and 60\u00a0months, respectively.    Conclusions  These preliminary results suggest induction treatment with C\u00a0+\u00a0TPF regimens, followed by intensity-modulated radiotherapy is well-tolerated, which warrants further evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Highly conductive, acid doped polymers such as PEDOT/PSS and polyaniline (PANI) have attracted much attention due to their potential applications in flexible electronics. However, the understanding of the mechanism behind the doping process is still lacking. In this paper, we conduct a systematic and detailed investigation on the acid doping behaviors of four model compounds which were synthesized by combining different protonatable units such as pyridal[2,1,3]thiadiazole (PT), benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (BT), cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT), and azulene. DFT simulation and UV-vis-NIR spectral studies show that while the site of first protonation was mainly determined by proton affinity, the subsequent site of protonation and doping density were determined by the nature of the first protonation and influenced by the following two factors: (1) electrostatic charge repulsion and (2) the possible delocalization of protonated charge in the conjugated structure. If the first protonation occurs at heteroatoms and results in a coplanar structure, the subsequent sites of protonation are mainly determined by the distance from the positive charge center to lower the effect of static repulsion and charge delocalization. On the other hand, if the first protonation occurs on the main chain carbon atoms which induce a large torsional angle (non-coplanar) as the carbon hybridization changes from sp(2) to sp(3), the conformation and the possible charge delocalization in the protonated molecules will play an important role in determining the subsequent protonation. Our study provides new insight into the acid-doping mechanism of conductive polymers, which could be used as a guide to design new acid doped highly conductive polymers. ",

        "abstract": "Highly conductive, acid doped polymers such as PEDOT/PSS and polyaniline (PANI) have attracted much attention due to their potential applications in flexible electronics. However, the understanding of the mechanism behind the doping process is still lacking. In this paper, we conduct a systematic and detailed investigation on the acid doping behaviors of four model compounds which were synthesized by combining different protonatable units such as pyridal[2,1,3]thiadiazole (PT), benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (BT), cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT), and azulene. DFT simulation and UV-vis-NIR spectral studies show that while the site of first protonation was mainly determined by proton affinity, the subsequent site of protonation and doping density were determined by the nature of the first protonation and influenced by the following two factors: (1) electrostatic charge repulsion and (2) the possible delocalization of protonated charge in the conjugated structure. If the first protonation occurs at heteroatoms and results in a coplanar structure, the subsequent sites of protonation are mainly determined by the distance from the positive charge center to lower the effect of static repulsion and charge delocalization. On the other hand, if the first protonation occurs on the main chain carbon atoms which induce a large torsional angle (non-coplanar) as the carbon hybridization changes from sp(2) to sp(3), the conformation and the possible charge delocalization in the protonated molecules will play an important role in determining the subsequent protonation. Our study provides new insight into the acid-doping mechanism of conductive polymers, which could be used as a guide to design new acid doped highly conductive polymers. ",

        "abstract": "We report the unique optical and protonation characteristics of azulene compounds with different molecular configurations and demonstrate their potential application as acid sensor materials. The unique characteristic of azulene compounds is its large dipole moment. Azulene derivatives with conjugation either along or orthogonal to the dipole direction of azulene were synthesized, and their electronic and optical properties were studied. Our results show that azulene with conjugation orthogonal to the dipole direction exhibits significant change in optical properties upon protonation due to strong intermolecular charge transfer. The low band gap absorption can reach up to mid-IR range, albeit at high acid doping concentration. On the other hand, conjugated azulenes along the dipole direction could be easily protonated even at very low acid concentration (ppm level), which is attributed to the formation of co-planar structures upon protonation and to their high proton affinity. Mechanisms behind the discrepancy between the two configurations are elucidated and further supported by computer simulation. The application of azulene chromophores as a chemical sensor with sensitivity at ppm level was also demonstrated in this work.",

        "abstract": "The increasing occurrence of resistance to chemical insecticides in insect pest populations is a serious threat to the integrity of current pest management strategies, and exploring new alternative chemistries is one important way to overcome this obstacle. Fluralaner, as a novel isoxazoline insecticide, has broad spectrum activity against a variety of insect pests, but little data is available about its effect on Lepidopterans. The effects of fluralaner on Spodoptera litura Fabricius, a widespread and polyphagous pest, were evaluated in the present study. Our results showed younger larvae were more susceptible to fluralaner treatment, but feeding and topical applications were similarly effective in 3rd instar larvae. Synergism assays indicated that piperonyl butoxide (PBO) could increase the toxicity of fluralaner to S. litura to a certain degree and P450 may be involved in the detoxification of fluralaner in vivo. Sublethal developmental effects included reduced larval body weight, decreased pupation and emergence, and notched wings in adults, accompanied by changes in the transcript levels of chitinase 5 (CHT5) and juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase (Jhamt), genes vital for insect development. Above results manifested that fluralaner is highly toxic to S. litura larvae via either topical or oral application and provide an indication of how this insecticide is metabolized in vivo. Further, our results provided a foundation for further development of fluralaner as a new tool in insect pest management.",

        "abstract": "The ionotropic GABA receptor (GABAR) is the main fast inhibitory post-synaptic receptor and is also an important insecticidal target. Effect of insecticides on fish has attracted intensive attention. However, no systematic study on heteromeric zebrafish GABAR expressed in oocytes has been reported to date. In this study, the \u03b11 subunit, the \u03b22S subunit lacking 47 amino acid residues compared with the \u03b22L subunit, and the \u03b32 subunit having five transmembrane domains were isolated from zebrafish Danio rerio. The responses of homomeric and heteromeric (\u03b11, \u03b22S and \u03b32) channels to agonists and GABAR-targeted compounds were detected with two-electrode voltage clamp. Dose-dependent responses were observed in heteromeric \u03b11\u03b22S, \u03b22S\u03b32, and \u03b11\u03b22S\u03b32 GABAR channels with EC values at 21.75, 6291, and 33.69\u2009\u03bcM for GABA-induced current and 3.28, 155.5, and 3.79\u2009mM for \u03b2-alanine-induced current, respectively. However, no response was induced by benzamidine in all GABAR channels. Abamectin, dieldrin, fluralaner and fipronil could strongly inhibited GABA-induced inward current \u226550% at 10\u2009M, while \u03b1-endosulfan, flufiprole and ethiprole only inhibited GABA-induced current <50%. This study has clarified the interaction of insecticides with the heteromeric GABAR channel, which could help us further explore the potential function and toxicological importance of GABARs from D. rerio.",

        "abstract": "Ionotropic \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (GABARs) mediate rapid inhibitory neurotransmission in both vertebrates and invertebrates, and are important molecular targets of insecticides. However, components of insect GABARs remain elusive. In addition to CsRDL1 and CsRDL2, the complementary DNAs (cDNAs) of another two GABA receptor-like subunits, CsLCCH3 and Cs8916, were identified from the rice striped stem borer, Chilo suppressalis Walker in the present study. Both CsLCCH3 and Cs8916 subunits shared common structural features, such as a highly-conserved Cys-loop structure, six distinct regions involved in ligand binding (loops A-F), and four transmembrane domains (TM 1-4). Transcript analysis demonstrated that the relative mRNA expression levels of both CsLCCH3 and Cs8916 subunits were the highest in the ventral nerve cord. Regarding developmental stage, transcript levels of both subunits were highest in eggs. Injections of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), including dsRDL1, dsRDL2, dsLCCH3, or ds8916, significantly reduced mRNA abundance after 24 and 48\u202fh. However, no observable effects on the development of C. suppressalis were observed. Injection of dsRDL1 or dsRDL2 did significantly reduce the mortality of C. suppressalis treated with fluralaner. Our results indicated that CsRDLs mediated the susceptibility of C. suppressalis to fluralaner, whereas CsLCCH3 and CsL8916 did not. The current investigation enhances our knowledge of Lepidopteran GABARs and offers a molecular basis for the development of novel insecticides to control C. suppressalis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study aims to analyze the thermal regime and stability of wide embankment in permafrost regions to facilitate the future construction of Qinghai-Tibet Expressway. Based on finite element method, thermo-hydro-mechanical coupling model was built to investigate the thermal stability and thawing settlement of embankments. The validity was verified by field observed data from Qinghai-Tibet Highway. Based on numerical analysis, the temperature field, thawing depth and thawing settlement of embankments with different width were investigated. The influences on the thermal stability of embankments by different protective measures such as raising height of embankment, setting crushed stone layer in embankment, setting Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) layer in embankment and setting the combination of crushed stone layer and EPS layer in embankment were evaluated. It was found that embankment construction has serious disturbance on the thermal stability of ground permafrost. Meanwhile, larger embankment width leads to worse thermal stability of ground permafrost and more serious thawing settlement of embankment. Increasing the embankment height can improve the thermal regime of embankment, however, the thawing settlement and differential thawing settlement of embankment get worse with bigger embankment height. Setting crush rock layer or EPS layer can improve the thermal stability of embankment, however, the improvement is limited for wide embankment with width exceeding 26\u00a0m. The combination of crush rock layer and EPS layer has the best protective effects on the thermal stability of wide embankment, however, the differential thawing settlement under pavement still needs to be paid attentions to.",

According to specific embankment section of Qinghai\u2212Tibet highway, computational region for numerical analysis was defined. And numerical model was developed through FEM software named as ABAQUS and was verified by field observed data. The effects by width and height of embankment on the thermal regime of computational region were analyzed based on FEM modeling. Numerical analysis showed that embankment construction has serious disturbance on the thermal stability of ground permafrost showing as annual average ground temperature and the maximum thawing depth keeps increasing with service time increasing. And larger embankment width leads to poorer thermal stability and more serious uneven temperature field of embankment. Raising embankment height can improve the thermal stability; however, the improvement is restricted for wide embankment and it cannot change the degradation trend of thermal stability with service life increasing. Thus, to construct expressway with wide embankment in permafrost regions of Qinghai\u2212Tibet Plateau, effective measures need to be considered to improve the thermal stability of underlying permafrost.",

Based on a designed SMA13 asphalt mixture, vermiculite powder was used to replace part of the fine aggregates to get an asphalt mixture with lower thermal conductivity. The Marshall test, wheel tracking test, low temperature bending beam test, and freeze-thaw splitting test were conducted to obtain a full evaluation of asphalt mixtures with different contents of vermiculite powder. A Mathis TCI thermal analyzer was used to test the thermal conductivity of asphalt mixtures, and the T-monitor temperature measuring system was used to compare the inside temperature of asphalt mixtures with and without vermiculite powder. It was found that with 10% vermiculite powder in the asphalt mixture, all of the road performances were satisfied, while thermal conductivity was lowered by 40%, and the inside temperature of the asphalt mixture was lowered by up to 2\u2103. The findings in this paper proved the feasibility of using vermiculite powder to reduce the thermal conductivity of asphalt mixtures.",

Based on numerical analysis, the temperature fields and thawing depths of embankments with different widths were analyzed. The influences of different protective measures on the thermal stability of embankments were evaluated. The findings indicate that, after embankment construction, the annual ground temperature and maximum thawing depth increase with time. Thus, the embankment construction causes serious disturbance of the thermal stability of permafrost. An embankment with a larger width has a lower thermal stability. The results also show that raising the embankment height, setting a crushed stone layer, or setting an expanded polystyrene (EPS) layer can improve the thermal stability of an embankment. However, the improving effect of a single protective measure is not obvious for wide embankments with widths larger than 26\u00a0m. A combination of a crushed stone layer and an EPS layer provides the best protective effect on the thermal stability of a wide embankment.

        "abstract": "In order to improve the thermal stability of wide embankment for the Qinghai-Tibet Expressway (QTE) to be constructed in permafrost zones on Qinghai-Tibet plateau, a new kind of reflective-resistant-ventilated coupling structure (RRVCS) was proposed and designed. A numerical model was then developed through ABAQUS to investigate the influences of RRVCS on the thermal regime of wide embankment. The temperature field and thawing depth of normal wide embankment without protective measures, wide embankment with crushed stone layer, and wide embankment with RRVCS were compared to verify the cooling effectiveness of RRVCS based on numerical analysis. Vermiculite powder has great influences on the thermal property of asphalt mixture, and it can be reduced by 22.8%, 29.5%, 37.3%, and 50.6% after the addition of 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10% vermiculite powder, respectively. Under the same condition, the temperature of RRVCS embankment is the lowest and its thermal stability is the best. Setting crushed stone layer can improve the thermal stability of embankment. However, the improvement is limited for wide embankment with width exceeding 26\u2009m. RRVCS has the best protective effects on the thermal stability of wide embankment and is recommended as a protective measure for wide embankment of expressway in permafrost regions of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",

        "abstract": "The unsteady flow past a rotating circular cylinder approaches a steady state after a large enough time for low Reynolds numbers. However the most recent time-dependent calculations performed by Badr et al. ( Comput. Fluids 17, 579; 1989) indicated that the flow does not tend to a steady state for higher Reynolds numbers, e.g. Re = 60 and 100 . In this work steady solutions have been obtained by solving the time-independent Navier-Stokes equations for Re = 60 and 100 and the rotational parameter, \u03b1, in the range of 0 \u2a7d \u03b1 \u2a7d 1 . The objective is to extend the Reynolds number range for reliable data on the steady flow, particularly with regard to the lift and drag coefficients. A numerical scheme which avoids the difficulties in satisfying the boundary conditions at large distances from the cylinder is employed. Further, series expansion solutions are obtained which are valid at small values of \u03b1, but the results are found to be applicable over a wide range of values of \u03b1. The flow pattern, the surface vorticity and pressure coefficient are also presented.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Oral malignant melanoma (OMM) is an aggressive tumor with very low survival rate and easy to metastasize. Pleural metastatic melanoma via primary OMM is rare. Case presentation In this report, we presented a case of metastatic malignant melanoma of the pleura originated from OMM. A 54-year-old man without primary skin lesion was diagnosed multiple nodular shadows, pleural invasion, and pleural effusion by chest computed tomography (CT). One cyst-form tumor on the tongue base was observed by bronchoscopy, which was diagnosed as OMM by pathological examination and then was resected. After getting the tumor tissues from the pleura by pleural biopsy surgery, the diagnosis of pathological examination was pleural metastatic melanoma. Furthermore, tumor cells displayed a positive immunoreaction for melanocytic markers S100 and HMB-45 combining with positive vimentin and cytokeratin AE1/AE3. The patient was therefore diagnosed with metastatic melanoma of the left pleura and the primary melanoma was OMM. Conclusions According to this case, we could draw the conclusion that pleural metastasis from OMM was very rare and thoracoscopy preceded under local anesthesia is an important method for its accurate diagnosis.",

The hip and spine bone mineral densities of the volunteers were measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry. The apparent integrated backscatter and spectral centroid shift were calculated. A new diagnostic parameter, i.e., the linear combination of apparent integrated backscatter and spectral centroid shift, was introduced and its correlation to bone mineral density was analyzed.The results show that the combination of apparent integrated backscatter and spectral centroid shift is significantly correlated to bone mineral density (R = 0.73-0.84, n = 1262, p < 0.05), and that this correlation is more significant than the correlation between the apparent integrated backscatter and bone mineral density or the correlation between spectral centroid shift and bone mineral density (R = 0.48-0.69, p < 0.05).The combination of apparent integrated backscatter and spectral centroid shift can provide the complementary information of attenuation of the two parameters and predict more information about cancellous bone, and may be employed to assess cancellous bone status.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the electromagnetic scattering from a rectangular large open cavity embedded in an infinite ground plane is studied. By introducing a nonlocal artificial boundary condition, the scattering problem from the open cavity is reduced to a bounded domain problem. A compact fourth order finite difference scheme is then proposed to discrete the cavity scattering model in the rectangular domain, and a special treatment is enforced to approximate the boundary condition, which makes truncation errors reach \u039f(h4) in the whole computational domain. A fast algorithm, exploiting the discrete Fourier transformation in the horizontal and a Gaussian elimination in the vertical direction, is employed, which reduces the discrete system to a much smaller interface system. An effective preconditioner is presented for the BICGstab iterative solver to solve this interface system. Numerical results demonstrate the remarkable accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. In particular, it can be used to solve the cavity model for the large wave number up to 600\u03c0.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we propose an efficient numerical method for computing the electrostatic interaction between two like-charged spherical particles which is governed by the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The nonlinear problem is solved by a monotone iterative method which leads to a sequence of linearized equations. A modified central finite difference scheme is developed to solve the linearized equations on an exterior irregular domain using a uniform Cartesian grid. With uniform grids, the method is simple, and as a consequence, multigrid solvers can be employed to speed up the convergence. Numerical experiments on cases with two isolated spheres and two spheres confined in a charged cylindrical pore are carried out using the proposed method. Our numerical schemes are found efficient and the numerical results are found in good agreement with the previous published results.",

        "abstract": "Pancreatic carcinoma is a highly lethal malignancy with an extremely poor prognosis. Recent genome-wide studies have implicated axon guidance pathways, including the SLIT/ROBO pathway, in pancreatic tumor development and progression. Here we showed that ROBO3 expression is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer tissue samples and cell lines. Over-expression of ROBO3 promotes pancreatic cancer cell growth, invasion and metastasis in vitro and in mouse xenograft tumor models. We identified miR-383 as a suppressor of ROBO3, and revealed its expression to be inversely correlated with ROBO3. Over-expression of ROBO3 activates Wnt pathway components, \u03b2-catenin and GSK-3, and the expression of markers indicating an EMT. By means of immunoprecipitation, we revealed an interaction between Wnt inhibitor SFRP and ROBO3 in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Our work suggests that ROBO3 may contribute to the progression of pancreatic cancer by sequestering Wnt inhibitor SFRP, which in turn leads to increased Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway activity. We also confirmed that ROBO3 increases with clinical grade and miR-383 expression is inversely correlated to that of ROBO3.",

It is envisioned as a lower cost, smaller footprint, and higher reliability alternative to the present, bouncer-topology, baseline design. The application requires 120 kV (+/-0.5%), 140 A, 1.6 ms pulses at a rate of 5 Hz. The Marx constructs the high voltage pulse by combining, in series, a number of lower voltage cells. The Marx employs solid state elements; IGBTs and diodes, to control the charge, discharge and isolation of the cells. Active compensation of the output is used to achieve the voltage regulation while minimizing the stored energy. The P1-Marx has been integrated into a test stand with a 10 MW L-band klystron, where each is undergoing life testing. A review of the P1-Marx design and its operational history in the L band test stand are presented.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the 90Sr/90Y coating effects on scattering width (SW) of cylindrical conductor targets are investigated. The electron density distribution of plasma around cylindrical targets of different radiuses is simulated under different radioactivities in normal or oblique incidence. In normal incidence, the SWs are examined as functions of frequency and scattering angle; while in oblique incidence, the SW is inspected as a function of incident angle at the frequency of 1.5 GHz. The results obtained are compared with those from an ideal perfect electric conductor (PEC) cylinder. It is demonstrated that the SW decreases over a wide frequency range in the back scattering region by coating a 90Sr/90Y layer on the cylindrical target. Moreover, the reduction in bi-static SW amplitude can reach 3\u201320 dB, when the incident angle is smaller than 30\u00b0 at 1.5 GHz. It is a significant improvement in the stealth effect.",

It contains the EG and the nanoparticles of the magnetic Ni\u2013Fe alloy for the electromagnetic shielding. Its morphology, phase structure, magnetic properties, and electromagnetic shielding effectiveness (SE) are investigated in our experiment. It shows that the morphology, the phase structure, and the magnetic property of the composite can be modified by altering the Ni content in the alloy nanoparticles. Interestingly, the SE can be enhanced to 54\u201370 dB at low frequencies (300 kHz\u201310 MHz) by dispersing the magnetic nanoparticles onto EG.",

The maximum electron density ionized by 5.45-MeV \u03b1-particles is ~1.8 \u00d7 1011 per cubic centimeter when the radioactivity is 10 Ci/cm2. The decrease of the reflectivity at altitude is much better than at ground and the decreasing amplitudes could reach 1-20 dB in the frequency range from 300 MHz to 40 GHz at an altitude of 10000 m. In addition, the same RNL would significantly reduce the back scattering bistatic radar cross section (RCS) of the platform. The decrease of RCS along the direction of the originally strongest reflection wave is nearly 25.5 dB when the incident angle is 60\u00b0.",

        "abstract": "Accumulating experimental evidence has shown that the aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is involved in the development and progression of human cervical cancer. Previously, we identified miR-182 as an oncomiRNA in cervical cancer. However, the mechanism by which miR-182 is regulated and the interaction between human papillomavirus (HPV) and miR-182 in cervical cancer development remains unknown. In the present study, we explored the link between HPV E7 and miR-182 and verified that high-risk HPV E7 upregulated miR-182 expression through TGF-\u03b2/Smad4 signaling pathway in cervical cancer. By contrast, low-risk HPV E7 did not affect the expression of TGF-\u03b2 and miR-182. Mechanistically, as high-risk HPV E7 bound to pRb, E2F was released from the complex and bound to the TGF-\u03b2 promoter region, resulting in TGF-\u03b2 overexpression. Furthermore, the Smad4 signaling pathway was activated upon TGF-\u03b2 overexpression, which led to an interaction between Smad4 and the miR-182 promoter region, subsequently inducing the upregulation of miR-182 in both cervical cancer cells and the surrounding normal cells. In conclusion, this newly identified high-risk HPV E7/TGF-\u03b2/miR-182 regulatory network might inform the development of specific therapeutic strategies for cervical cancer.",

        "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which serve as important and powerful regulators of various biological activities, have gained widespread attention in recent years. Emerging evidence has shown that some lncRNAs play important regulatory roles in osteoblast differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for bone fracture. As a recently identified lncRNA, linc-ROR was reported to mediate the reprogramming ability of differentiated cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) self-renewal. However, other functions of linc-ROR remain elusive. In this study, linc-ROR was found to be upregulated during osteogenesis of human bone-marrow-derived MSCs. Ectopic expression of linc-ROR significantly accelerated, whereas knockdown of linc-ROR suppressed, osteoblast differentiation. Using bioinformatic prediction and luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrated that linc-ROR functioned as a microRNA (miRNA) sponge for miR-138 and miR-145, both of which were negative regulators of osteogenesis. Further investigations revealed that linc-ROR antagonized the functions of these two miRNAs and led to the de-repression of\u00a0their shared target ZEB2, which eventually activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and hence potentiated osteogenesis. Taken together, linc-ROR modulated osteoblast differentiation by acting as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), which may shed light on the functional characterization of lncRNAs in coordinating osteogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Actin filament-associated protein-120kD (AFAP-120) is an alternatively spliced isoform of actin filament-associated protein-110kD (AFAP-110) and contains an additional neuronal insert (NINS) fragment in addition to identical domains to the AFAP-110. Unlike AFAP-110 widely expressed in tissues, AFAP-120 is specifically expressed in the nervous system and plays a role in organizing dynamic actin structures during neuronal differentiation. However, anti-AFAP-120 antibody is still commercially unavailable, and this may hinder the function research for AFAP-120. In this study, we simultaneously used the ABCpred online server and the BepiPred 1.0 server to predict B-cell epitopes in the exclusive NINS sequence of human AFAP-120 protein, and found that a 16aa-peptide sequence was the consensus epitope predicted by both tools. This peptide was chemically synthesized and used as an immunogen to develop polyclonal antibody against AFAP-120 (anti-AFAP-120). The sensitivity and specificity of anti-AFAP-120 were analyzed with immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence assays. Our results indicated that anti-AFAP-120 could react with over-expressed and endogenous human AFAP-120 protein under denatured condition, but not with human AFAP-110 protein. Moreover, native human AFAP-120 protein could also be recognized by the anti-AFAP-120 antibody. These results suggested that the prepared anit-AFAP-120 antibody would be a useful tool for studying the biochemical and biological functions of AFAP-120. ",

Different from traditional isothermal extrusion (ITE) with the same billet and mold temperature, the billet temperature for the DTE is remarkably higher than the mold temperature. The finer grains and less long period stacking ordered (LPSO) structure in the DTE sample resulted from its higher cooling speed after deformation. Meanwhile, the stronger precipitation strengthening effect was caused by the higher billet preheat temperature which reserved the precipitation ability before extrusion. As a result, the finer grains and stronger precipitation strengthening led to the strong tensile yield strength (380\u00a0MPa) and ultimate tensile strength (461\u00a0MPa) of the aged DTE sample, while those of the aged ITE sample are only 338\u00a0MPa and 420\u00a0MPa, respectively. The higher strengths indicate the DTE is a better extrusion process for producing high-strength Mg alloys than the traditional ITE.",

A parametric flow line model is established to characterize the material flow corresponding to different strain paths in the extrusion chamber. The polycrystal plasticity method coupled with a phenomenological dynamic recrystallization model is employed to analyze the evolution of texture and microstructure accompanying the deformation. The texture of material deformed near the central extrusion area shows the typical ring fiber texture in the (0001) pole figure, while the basal poles of the material deformed in the side areas tend to rotate backward to the extrusion direction, resulting from an increase of the activities of twinning and slip systems. The more refined microstructure is obtained in the side areas due to the higher strain rate. The difference of mechanical properties between center and side areas of the extruded bar are numerically investigated by simulating tension and compression by using different extrusion textures. Side material shows more isotropic mechanical property than central material, and then less twinning is operative in compression.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Hot forming often has to be resorted when processing metals with limited room-temperature formability, such as aluminum, magnesium, etc. The temperature rise induced by plastic work, especially under high strain rates, can exert significant effect on mechanical response as well as dynamic recrystallization of deformed metals. In the present work, a polycrystal plasticity based thermo-mechanical-dynamic recrystallization (DRX) coupled approach is established by implementing thermo-mechanical effect in a VPSC-DRX model where a grain nucleation and growth model is implemented into the VPSC framework. The modeling parameters associated with various slip modes, temperatures and strain rates are calibrated by isothermal compression experiments, and then evolution functions of hardening and DRX related parameters with respect to temperature and strain rate are established. The integrated computation of plastic deformation, texture, grain size and temperature update in hot deformation of metals can be achieved. The proposed method is verified and then applied to simulate hot extrusion processes of magnesium alloy bars at three different ram speeds. The influences of ram speed on development of deformation texture and grain size are analyzed. The temperature rise due to plastic work enhances stress softening and stimulates grain growth, makes the macro/micro responses of materials no longer monotonically varied with strain rate.",

Different from clustering research issues, in classification research issues, evolutionary clustering algorithms (EAs) were only used to improve the performance of classifiers either by optimizing the parameters or structure of the classifiers, or by pre-processing the inputs of the classifiers. Lots of evolutionary algorithms are employed to solve unsupervised classification, i.e., clustering. In this article, we will create a new mathematical model for supervised classification problem and use brain storm optimization algorithm (BSO) to search the global optimal solution, which resolved the problem of supervised classification with new ideas. The main objective is to find a better method. By using a new classification algorithm based on BSO, we are looking forward to optimizing the result.",

        "abstract": "Feedforward neural network (FNN) is one of the most widely used and fastest-developed artificial neural networks. Much evolutionary computation (EC) methods have been used to optimize the weights of FNN. However, as the dimension of datasets increases, the number of weights also increases dramatically. On high-dimensional datasets, if EC methods are used directly to optimize the weights of FNN, it is impossible to obtain the optimal weights of the FNN by EC methods in an acceptable time. Feature selection is a method that can effectively reduce the computational complexity of FNN by reducing irrelevant and redundant features. It may be practical to optimize the FNN by EC methods if we first employ the feature selection for the large-scale datasets. In this paper, we present a self-adaptive parameter and strategy-based particle swarm optimization (SPS-PSO) algorithm to optimize FNN with feature selection. First, we propose an optimization model for FNN by transforming the designing of FNN into a weights optimization problem. Simultaneously, we present a feature selection optimization model. Second, we present an SPS-PSO algorithm. In this algorithm, we use the parameter and strategy self-adaptive mechanism. In addition, five candidate solution generating strategies (CSGS) are used. The experiments are divided into two groups. In the first group, SPS-PSO and three other EC methods are used to directly optimize the weights of FNN on eight datasets without any modification. In the second group, we first employ SPS-PSO-based feature selection on the original datasets and obtain eight relatively smaller datasets with the    ${k}$   -nearest neighbor (KNN) which is used as the evaluation function for saving time. Then, we use the new datasets as the inputs for FNN. We optimize the weights of FNN again by SPS-PSO and three other EC methods to investigate whether we can get similar or even better classification accuracy by comparing the results with that of the first group. The experimental results show that SPS-PSO has the advantage in optimizing the weights of FNN compared with the other EC methods. Meanwhile, the SPS-PSO-based feature selection can reduce the solution size and computational complexity while ensuring the classification accuracy when it is used to preprocess the datasets for FNN. In this method, a solution with an originally higher than 700 000 dimensions can be even reduced to hundreds of dimensions.",

A novel AFE architecture that combines time division multiplexing (TDM) and chopping stabilization (CS) to improve the system common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and the input-referred noise is proposed. With TDM, the reference electrode is connected to single channel input during its time slot to avoid the CMRR degradation caused by input impedance imbalance. Furthermore, the 2 nd  stage programmable gain amplifier (PGA) is shared among multiple channels, leading to significant reduction in both power consumption and chip area. In addition, input impedance boosting loop and DC servo-loop are included to boost the input impedance and cancel the input DC offset. Implemented in a 0.18-pm CMOS process, the proposed AFE shows 0.63 pVrms input-referred noise integrated from 0.5 Hz to 100 Hz and 560 \u039c\u03a9 input impedance at 50 Hz. The measured AFE intrinsic CMRR is 89 dB and the system CMRR is 82 dB, which is a 40 dB improvement compared to the conventional architecture.

The fatigue lives, failure modes for the solder joints and the typical locations of the failed solder joints for single-variable loading and combined loading conditions are compared and analyzed. The results show much earlier solder joint failure for combined loading than that for either temperature cycling or pure vibration loading at room temperature. The primary failure mode is cracking within the bulk solder under temperature cycling, whereas the crack propagation path is along the intermetallic compound (IMC) layer for vibration loading. The solder joints subjected to combined loading exhibit both types of failure modes observed for temperature cycling and vibration loading; in addition, cracking through the IMC and the bulk solder is observed in the combined test. For temperature cycling and vibration loading, the components in the central region of the printed circuit board (PCB) have more failed solder joints than other components, whereas for combined loading, the number of failed solder joints in the components in different locations of the PCB is approximately the same.",

As for transient faults after arc extinction, low-frequency oscillation is observed in both curves of current inner products which have 90\u00b0 phase differences; and two curves will have points of intersection. According to this phenomenon, the intersection of two current inner product curves is used to identify fault nature and detect the arc extinction.

        "abstract": "The identification of faulty feeder for single-phase high impedance faults (HIFs), especially in resonant grounding distribution system (RGDS), has always been a challenge, and existing faulty feeder identification techniques for HIFs suffer from some drawbacks. For this problem, the fault transient characteristic of single-phase HIF is analyzed and a faulty feeder identification method for HIF is proposed. The analysis shows that the transient zero-sequence current of each feeder is seen as a linear relationship between bus transient zero-sequence voltage and bus transient zero-sequence voltage derivative, and the coefficients are the reciprocal of transition resistance and feeder own capacitance, respectively, in both the over-damping state and the under-damping state. In order to estimate transition resistance and capacitance of each feeder, a least squares algorithm is utilized. The estimated transition resistance of a healthy feeder is infinite theoretically, and is a huge value practically. However, the estimated transition resistance of faulty feeder is approximately equal to actual fault resistance value, and it is far less than the set threshold. According to the above significant difference, the faulty feeder can be identified. The efficiency of the proposed method for the single-phase HIF in RGDS is verified by simulation results and experimental results that are based on RTDS.",

Variable predictive model class discrimination (VPMCD) is a conventional pattern recognition method; however, in practice, when the fault diagnosis method is applied to small samples or in multi-correlative feature space, the stability of the VPM constructed based on the least squares (LS) method is not sufficient. Based on affinity propagation (AP) clustering, RReliefF, and sequential forward search, the ARSFS is proposed to select the significant subset of original feature set and to reduce the dimension and multiple correlations of the feature space. Further, this paper uses two kinds of Gaussian Neural Network, namely the Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF) and the Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), instead of the LS method to construct predictive models of VPMCD, called AOR-VPMCD. Compared with the conventional VPMCD and its improvements, based on sufficient experiments, the entire process presented in this paper can effectively identify the fault of the rolling bearing.",

        "title": "Interactive repression of MYRF self-cleavage and activity in oligodendrocyte differentiation by TMEM98 protein.",
        "abstract": "Myelin sheath formed by oligodendrocytes (OLs) is essential for the rapid propagation of action potentials in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS). Myelin regulatory factor (MYRF) is one of the critical factors that control OL differentiation and myelin maintenance. Previous studies showed that MYRF is a membrane-bound transcription factor associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Upon self-cleavage, the N-fragment of MYRF is released from ER and translocated into nucleus where it functions as a transcription factor to activate myelin gene expression. At present, it remains unknown whether MYRF self-cleavage and functional activation can be regulated during OL differentiation. Here, we report that TMEM98, an ER-associated transmembrane protein, is capable of binding to the C-terminal of MYRF and inhibiting its self-cleavage and N-fragment nuclear translocation. In the developing CNS, TMEM98 is selectively expressed in early maturing OLs in mouse pups of either sex. Forced expression of TMEM98 in embryonic chicken spinal cord of either sex suppresses endogenous OL differentiation and MYRF-induced ectopic expression of myelin genes. These results suggest that TMEM98, through inhibiting the self-cleavage of MYRF, functions as a negative feedback regulator of MYRF in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination.MYRF protein is initially synthesized as an ER-associated membrane protein that undergoes auto-proteolytic cleavage to release the N-fragment which is then transported into the nucleus and activates the transcription of myelin genes. To date, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the self-cleavage and function of MYRF in regulating oligodendrocyte differentiation have remained unknown. In this study, we present the molecular and functional evidence that TMEM98 membrane protein physically interacts with MYRF in ER, and subsequently blocks its self-cleavage, N-terminal nuclear translocation and functional activation of myelin gene expression. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the regulation of MYRF self-proteolytic activity and function by an interacting protein, providing new insights into the molecular regulation of OL differentiation and myelinogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are sequentially specified into neurons and glia during the development of central nervous system. WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling is known to regulate the balance between the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs during neurogenesis. However, the function of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling during gliogenesis remains poorly defined. Here, we report that activation of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling disrupts astrogliogenesis in the developing spinal cord. Conversely, inhibition of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling leads to precocious astrogliogenesis. Further analysis reveals that activation of WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway results in a dramatic increase of neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) expression in transgenic mice, and knockdown of Ngn2 expression in neural precursor cells can reverse the inhibitory effect of WNT/\u03b2-catenin on astrocytic differentiation. Moreover, Ngn2 can directly bind to the promoters of several astrocyte specific genes and suppress their expression independent of STATs activity. Together, our studies provide the first in vivo evidence that WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling inhibits early astrogliogenesis via an Ngn2-dependent transcriptional repression mechanism.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method to detect the lanes from the aerial videos, which is composed of two parts: image pre-processing and the lane detection. The first part, image pre-processing, mainly includes down-sampling, image binarizing and lane edge getting, and then a low resolution binary image will be gotten. The second part consists of the line parameter getting based on Hough Transform, false lane parameters removing, lane parameters correcting based on Kalman algorithm and ROI (region of interest) getting. After taking some characteristics of the freeway into consideration, this paper proposes a binaryzation algorithm which can convert color images into binary images directly. Furthermore, the white blocks in the binary image can be removed after lane edge getting. This paper adopts the Progressive Probabilistic Hough Transform to increase the accuracy and efficiency. Whatu0027s more, in this paper, we put forward two principles to remove false line parameters based on the distribution characteristics of the lanes: the dominance of the lane angles and the similarity of the slope difference and the distance between the adjacent lane markings. Finally, in this paper, the Kalman filter is used to correct and predict the parameters. Above all, this method can detect all the lanes correctly from the aerial video, with good accuracy and robustness, even if many vehicles are on the road and pipes and poles are beside the road, and even if the freeway locates at the corner of the image or has a big dip angle.",

Firstly, the segmentation method is based on the characteristics of lane, such as color, width and shape. In the aspect of clustering of lane feature points, spectral clustering algorithm is used to accomplish the clustering of effective feature points, and the similarity matrix is constructed according to the line spacing. In terms of lane model selection and parameter estimation, we fulfill them with the following three procedures: 1) cubic B-spline curve is used in this paper to express the lane more accurately and to indicate the distance farther. 2) we evaluated the model parameters by taking advantage of the improved RANSAC algorithm. 3) we chose the Kalman filter to correct and predict lane parameters. The results of experiment demonstrate that the proposed method can detect the model parameters of every lane from the video of aerial photography freeway with high stability and high detection accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Imperatorin is a chemical compound belonging to the linear furanocoumarins. Imperatorin is attracting considerable attention because of its antitumor, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticoagulant activities, inhibition of myocardial hypertrophy, and other pharmacological efficacies. However, imperatorin has limited water solubility and has better lipid solubility; thus, we decided to design and synthesize imperatorin lipid microspheres to optimize the preparation conditions. The aim was to develop and formulate imperatorin lipid microspheres through nanoemulsion technology and apply the response surface\u207bcentral composite design to optimize the imperatorin lipid microsphere formulation. The influence of the amounts of egg lecithin, poloxamer 188, and soybean oil for injection on the total percentage of the oil phase was investigated. The integrated effect of dependent variables, including particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potentials, drug loading, and encapsulation efficiency, was investigated. Data of overall desirabilities were fitted to a second-order polynomial equation, through which three-dimensional response surface graphs were described. Optimum experimental conditions were calculated by Design-Expert 8.06. Results indicated that the optimum preparation conditions were as follows: 1.39 g of egg lecithin, 0.21 g of poloxamer 188, and 10.57% soybean oil for injection. Preparation of imperatorin lipid microspheres according to the optimum experimental conditions resulted in an overall desirability of 0.7286, with the particle size of 168 \u00b1 0.54 nm, polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.138 \u00b1 0.02, zeta potentials of -43.5 \u00b1 0.5 mV, drug loading of 0.833 \u00b1 0.27 mg\u00b7mL, and encapsulation efficiency of 90 \u00b1 1.27%. The difference between the observed and predicted values of the overall desirability of the optimum formulation was in the range from 2.4% to 4.3%. Subsequently, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the micromorphology of the imperatorin lipid microspheres, showing round globules of relatively uniform shape and sizes within 200 nm. The effect of imperatorin lipid microspheres on MDA-MB-231 proliferation was investigated by the MTT method. Furthermore, pharmacokinetics in Sprague-Dawley rats was evaluated using orbital bleeding. A sensitive and reliable liquid chromatography with the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was established and validated for the quantification of imperatorin in rat plasma samples. The data were calculated by DAS (drug and statistics) Pharmacokinetic Software version 3.3.0 (Version 3.3.0, Shanghai, China). Results demonstrated that imperatorin lipid microspheres can significantly enhance the bioavailability of imperatorin and can significantly inhibit MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation. In conclusion, our results suggested that the response surface\u207bcentral composite design is suitable for achieving an optimized lipid microsphere formulation. Imperatorin lipid microspheres can improve the bioavailability of imperatorin and better inhibit the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to imperatorin alone.",

Our previous study demonstrated that imperatorin increased the intestinal absorption of puerarin and vincristine by inhibiting P-gp-mediated drug efflux. However; the underlying mechanism was not known. The present study investigated the mechanism by which imperatorin promotes P-gp-mediated drug transport. We used molecular docking to predict the binding force between imperatorin and P-gp and the effect of imperatorin on P-gp activity. P-gp efflux activity and P-gp ATPase activity were measured using a rhodamine 123 (Rh-123) accumulation assay and a Pgp-Glo\u2122 assay; respectively. The fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) was used to assess cellular membrane fluidity in MDCK-MDR1 cells. Western blotting was used to analyze the effect of imperatorin on P-gp expression; and P-gp mRNA levels were assessed by qRT-PCR. Molecular docking results demonstrated that the binding force between imperatorin and P-gp was much weaker than the force between P-gp and verapamil (a P-gp substrate). Imperatorin activated P-gp ATPase activity; which had a role in the inhibition of P-gp activity. Imperatorin promoted Rh-123 accumulation in MDCK-MDR1 cells and decreased cellular membrane fluidity. Western blotting demonstrated that imperatorin inhibited P-gp expression; and qRT-PCR revealed that imperatorin down-regulated P-gp (MDR1) gene expression. Imperatorin decreased P-gp-mediated drug efflux by inhibiting P-gp activity and the expression of P-gp mRNA and protein. Our results suggest that imperatorin could down-regulate P-gp expression to overcome multidrug resistance in tumors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Objectives  To investigate the effects of bergapten of  Angelicae Dahuricae Radix  on the transport of vincristine and its possible mechanism.    Methods  The apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) for the transport of vincristine through the membrane of MDCK-MDR1 cells was used as an indicator of the effect of bergapten on vincristine transport. Molecular docking was employed to predict the binding force between bergapten and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The effects of bergapten on P-gp function and P-gp ATPase activity were determined by rhodamine 123 (Rho123) accumulation and activity analysis, respectively. 1,6-Diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) was used to study the effects of bergapten on membrane fluidity, and Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR assays were performed to analyze the effect of bergapten on the protein and mRNA expression of P-gp, respectively. These experiments clarified the effects of bergapten on the transport of vincristine and allowed exploration of the possible mechanism underlying the effects of bergapten.    Results  The results showed that bergapten could inhibit the transport of vincristine in MDCK-MDR1 cells, and the binding force between bergapten and P-gp was weaker. Bergapten could reduce the accumulation of Rh123 in MDCK-MDR1 cells, increase the membrane fluidity, and upregulate P-gp protein and mRNA expression but it had no effect on P-gp ATPase activity.    Conclusions  Overall, we concluded that the possible mechanism through which bergapten inhibits vincristine transport was related to the bergapten-mediated upregulation of P-gp protein and mRNA expression, membrane fluidity or P-gp enzyme activity.",

        "abstract": "Several methods such as the addition of a polar solvent, an acid as well as various post-treatments have been used to improve the thermoelectric performance of conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) films. This paper reports a method using a superacid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, in methanol to treat PEDO:PSS films to improve their thermoelectric performance. Treatment of PEDOT:PSS films with this superacid in methanol leads to a significant increase in electrical conductivity from 0.7 to 2980 S cm\u22121 together with a moderate increase in Seebeck coefficient from 17.6 to 21.9 \u03bcV K\u22121, giving a power factor of 142 \u03bcW m\u22121 K\u22122, one of the highest values reported in the literature for conductive polymers. The figure of merit (ZT) value is estimated to be 0.19 under optimized conditions. The enhancement of thermoelectric performance, particularly the increase in both electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, is due to the removal of the insulating component and polymer chain realignment giving in turn a denser packing of the conductive PEDOT polymer chains. This post-treatment method would offer an alternative way to improve the thermoelectric performance.",

We characterized the DNA-damaging properties of these drugs in different experimental systems. No evidence for induction of gene mutations was detected in bacterial (Salmonella/microsome) tests, but clear dose-dependent effects were found in in vitro single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assays with human lymphocytes and with buccal- and lung-derived human cell lines (TR-146 and A-549). These experiments are based on the determination of DNA migration in an electric field and enable the detection of single- and double-strand breaks and apurinic sites. Furthermore, we found that both drugs induce micronuclei which are formed as a consequence of chromosomal aberrations. The lack of effects in SCGE experiments with lesion-specific enzymes (FPG, Endo III) shows that the DNA damage is not caused by formation of oxidatively damaged bases; experiments with liver enzyme homogenates and bovine serum albumin indicate that the drugs are not converted enzymatically to DNA-reactive intermediates. Furthermore, results with buccal- and lung-derived human cells show that gaseous treatment of the cells under conditions which reflect the exposure situation in drug users may cause damage of the genetic material in epithelia of the respiratory tract. Since DNA instability is involved in the etiology of cancer, these findings can be taken as an indication that consumption of the SCs may cause tumors in the respiratory tract of consumers.",

        "title": "Pomegranate (Punica granatum) Seed Oil for Treating Menopausal Symptoms: An Individually Controlled Cohort Study.",
        "abstract": "Context \u2022 In the folk medicine of Mediterranean countries and in ancient Ayurveda, Punica granatum seeds (ie, pomegranate seeds) have been used for treatment of various disorders, including those that nowadays are classified as menopausal symptoms (MSs). Pomegranate seed oil (PSO) from those seeds mainly contains unsaturated fatty acids such as \u03b3-linoleic acid and linolenic acid, but it also includes phytoestrogens. It is, therefore, regarded as a promising option for treating MSs today. Objectives \u2022 The study intended to investigate the safety and effectiveness of PSO as a defined P granatum seed oil for patients with MSs. Design \u2022 The research team designed an individually controlled, investigator-initiated cohort study. Setting \u2022 The treatments were performed at 2 institutions: (1) the Center for Complementary Medicine at the University Medical Center Freiburg (Freiburg, Germany); and (2) in the medical practice of H. Fischer (Freiburg, Germany). Participants \u2022 Seventy-eight patients, who had a mean duration of MSs of 46 mo, participated in the study. Intervention \u2022 After 4 wk without treatment, which functioned as a period providing an individual control, each participant took 1000 mg of PSO daily in 2 capsules for 8 wk. Outcome Measures \u2022 The symptom severity was scored on the German version of the menopausal rating scale (MRS) at baseline, after 4 wk without treatment, after 4 wk of treatment, and postintervention, with 0 = absence of symptoms and 4 = very strong symptoms. The efficacy and tolerability were estimated on scales from 0-4. Each participant's 17\u00df estradiol was determined at baseline and after postintervention using the patient's sera. The content of the \u03b2-sitosterol was determined in the PSO preparations by gas chromatography. Results \u2022 The content of \u03b2-sitosterol in the PSO used in the study was 6.3 mg/1000 mg. In the intention to treat analysis, most MRS symptoms were significantly and relevantly reduced (eg, hot flushes changed from 2.32 \u00b1 1.04 to 1.41 \u00b1 1.07, P < .001). Remarkably, urogenital tract symptoms (ie, a dry vagina) also significantly improved, moving from 1.32 \u00b1 1.43 to 0.85 \u00b1 1.19, P < .001. Few patients reported gastrointestinal symptoms. The tolerability was excellent at 3.69 \u00b1 0.71 after 4 wk of treatment and 3.71 \u00b1 0.65 after 8 wk of treatment. The 17\u00df estradiol was unchanged. Conclusions \u2022 Participants showed significant improvements in all domains of the MRS, remarkably including the difficult-to-treat urogenital symptoms. No changes occurred in the 17\u00df-estradiol in patients' sera after the PSO treatment. The results are promising and encourage the investigation of PSO rich in \u03b2-sitosterol for treatment of MSs in placebo-controlled studies.",

A persistence\u2010dependent trading trigger is introduced accordingly. Applied to STOXX Europe 600\u2013traded equities, our strategy exploits price leadership for portfolio replication purposes and delivers Sharpe ratios that outperform the benchmark rules used in the literature.

        "title": "Mediterranean Precipitation Response to Greenhouse Gases andAerosols",
        "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosols and greenhouse gases affect cloud properties, radiative balance and thus, the hydrological cycle. Observations show that precipitation has decreased in the Mediterranean since the 20th century, and many studies have investigated possible mechanisms. So far, however, the effects of aerosol forcing on Mediterranean precipitation remain largely unknown. Here we compare Mediterranean precipitation responses to individual forcing agents in a set of state-of-the-art global climate models (GCMs). Our analyses show that both greenhouse gases and aerosols can cause drying in the Mediterranean, and that precipitation is more sensitive to black carbon (BC) forcing than to well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs) or sulfate aerosol. In addition to local heating, BC appears to reduce precipitation by causing an enhanced positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)/Arctic Oscillation (AO)-like sea level pressure (SLP) pattern, characterized by higher SLP at mid-latitudes and lower SLP at high-latitudes. WMGHGs cause a similar SLP change, and both are associated with a northward diversion of the jet stream and storm tracks, reducing precipitation in the Mediterranean while increasing precipitation in Northern Europe. Though the applied forcings were much larger, if forcings are scaled to those of the historical period of 1901\u20132010, roughly one-third (31\u2009\u00b1\u200917\u2009%) of the precipitation decrease would be attributable to global BC forcing with the remainder largely attributable to WMGHGs whereas global scattering sulfate aerosols have negligible impacts. The results from this study suggest that future BC emissions may significantly affect regional water resources, agricultural practices, ecosystems, and the economy in the Mediterranean region.",

        "abstract": "A resistant strain of Nilaparvata lugens has been continuously selected in the presence of nitenpyram for 27 generations under laboratory conditions in order to study the fitness cost of nitenpyram resistance. The resistance to nitenpyram in N. lugens was at a high level (resistance ratio\u2009=\u2009144.7-fold). Life-tables of the nitenpyram-resistant strain and the susceptible strain (SS) of N. lugens were studied by using the age-stage, two-sex life-table approach. Compared to the SS, the relative fitness of the resistant strain of N. lugens was 0.55, with a lower intrinsic rate of increase (r) and net reproductive rate (R0). Changes in some life-history traits of the resistant strain were also observed. The duration of the egg stage, the development times of the first-, third- and fourth-instar nymphs, the adult preoviposition period and the total preoviposition period of the resistant strain were significantly increased, whereas the longevity, egg survival rate and fecundity (eggs/female) (absolute fitness) were significantly decreased in the resistant strain of N. lugens. The lower intrinsic rate of increase (r) and net reproductive rate (R0) seemed to be largely due to number of eggs laid, developmental time and egg survival rate. These results showed that the development of nitenpyram resistance may lead to significant fitness costs in resistant populations of N. lugens. This study provided valuable information for facilitating the development of nitenpyram-resistance management strategies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Previous studies have demonstrated that gut symbionts are involved in the detoxification metabolism of insect hosts, but the relationship between gut symbionts and host detoxification metabolism of the brown planthopper ( Nilaparvata lugens , BPH) remains unclear. In the present study, an indoor population (NlIP) and a field population (NlFP) of the BPH were used to characterize the functional profiling of the gut microbiome based on 16S rDNA sequencing. The results show that the NlIP and NlFP strains of  N. lugens  had different symbiont compositions, and Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes were the dominate phyla, accounting for u003e75% of the total symbiont compositions. Additionally, the NlIP strain had more  Pantoea  and  Stenotrophomonas , while the NlFP strain showed a higher  Wolbachia ,  Actinobacteria , and  Herbaspirillum  relative abundance. Furthermore, functional content of the metagenome predicted by PICRUSt demonstrated no significant difference in metagenomic function between the NlIP and NlFP strains in the principal component analysis (PCA), and only three types of genes, namely, genes involved with metabolic diseases, poorly characterized genes, and genes involved in circulatory systems, were different between the strains based on KEGG pathway analysis, which also speculated that gut symbionts are not directly involved in the detoxification metabolism for insecticides in the BPH. These results will be helpful for further research into the mechanisms of gut symbionts involved in detoxification metabolism in the BPH.",

        "abstract": "As the main component of a ballasted railway system, railway ballast is frequently used by the railway industry to enhance constructability and practicality. Numerous studies into train\u2013track interactions focused on ballast modelling and idealisation in completely dry environments, but recent studies have found that, in extreme weather such as floods, water can clog natural ballast beds and change the initial state of their properties. Ballast models used in multi-body simulations have been mostly developed based on the instrumented impact hammering method considering the ballast as a spring/dashpot. The single degree of freedom (SDOF) idealization for ballast enables a non-destructive field testing technique for monitoring of railway components in practice. In this study, the suitability of the idealization of ballast for dynamic characteristics has been evaluated. A series of experiments have been performed with a variety of ballast conditions in flooding levels from 0 to 40 cm, with a frequency range of 0\u2013500 Hz. The results clearly show that the increase in the flood level will result in increasing dynamic damping of more than 50% of dry natural ballast whilst reducing its stiffness and natural frequency. The novel insights are of great significance for exploring the non-linear dynamic traits of ballast in extreme environments, which can be integrated into the coupled train\u2013track analysis that can better express more realistically the dynamic train\u2013track interaction and load transfer mechanism of flooded railway tracks.",

        "abstract": "The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (St\u00e5l) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), is a serious pest of rice. At present, the application of chemical insecticides is the main control option for this pest. BPH has evolved resistance to various classes of insecticides. Cycloxaprid, a new oxabridged cis-configuration neonicotinoid insecticide, is a (nitromethylene) imidazole analog of imidacloprid. This study focused on the baseline susceptibility to cycloxaprid of 18 field samples of N. lugens collected from nine geographical locations in China, as well as possible cross-resistances between cycloxaprid and other important neonicotinoids in one laboratory-selected resistant strain of N. lugens to imidacloprid. The median lethal concentration (LC50) of cycloxaprid for the 18 samples ranged from 1.26 to 14.90 mg/liter. Furthermore, the cross-resistance studies showed that the imidacloprid-resistant strain exhibited a 27.63-fold resistance to imidacloprid and lower levels of cross-resistance to acetamiprid (16.64-fold), thiacloprid (12.64-fold), and nitenpyram (16.90-fold); however, there was no cross-resistance to cycloxaprid (1.92-fold). These results indicate that cycloxaprid could be an effective alternative insecticide for the management of N. lugens, which is urgently needed to prevent or delay further increases in insecticide resistance in N. lugens.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Rice thrips ( Chloethrips oryzae  Williams) is one of the key pests of rice ( Oryza sativa  L.), and is usually controlled by labor-intensive foliar sprays of agrochemicals under field conditions. To reduce labor intensity and increase the utilization of agrochemicals, thiamethoxam seed treatment was studied as a simple and accurate control technology for  C .  oryzae . Field plot experiments were conducted to investigate the control efficacy of three methods of thiamethoxam seed treatment for  C .  oryzae , and their effects on growth and yield of rice in 2014\u20132016. Excellent control of  C .  oryzae  was achieved using thiamethoxam 350 FS (flowable concentrate for seed treatment) seed treatment at a rate of 70\u00a0g ai/100\u00a0kg of seeds, at 17\u201328 days after sowing. Better control of leaf-tip rolling was observed when for seed treatment application rice seeds were soaked firstly in water for 8\u201310\u00a0h and then dried at room temperature, then coated with thiamethoxam 350 FS solution, soaked again in water and germinated (method A) or when rice seeds were coated firstly with thiamethoxam 350 FS solution, soaked in water and germinated (method C) than when rice seeds were soaked firstly in water for 8\u201310\u00a0h and then plus thiamethoxam 350 FS solution, then soaked again in water and germinated (method B). Field observations indicated that thiamethoxam seed treatment at this rate had no negative effects on the timing or percentage of seedling emergence, establishment, and key seedling characteristics including plant height, root length, and fresh above-ground and underground weight. However, rice yields of thiamethoxam seed treatment were increased significantly compared to untreated control. These results suggested that treatment of rice seeds by thiamethoxam using the method A or C was more effective against  C .  oryzae  than using the method B for up to 28 days after sowing under field conditions. Use of thiamethoxam seed treatment was not phytotoxic to rice and represents an important alternative for  C .  oryzae  management in the crop.",

It will be shown that superconvergence properties may be obtained by using appropriate collocation parameters and graded meshes. The grading exponents of graded meshes used are not greater thanm (the polynomial degree) which is independent of \u00bf. This is in contrast to the theories of spline collocation methods for Volterra (or Fredholm) integral equation of the second kind. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the importance of considering contact angle hysteresis (CAH) during the process of stretching and breaking a liquid bridge between two solid surfaces is addressed. We clearly show that due to the pinning of contact line at the end of the stretching stage, the contact angle between liquid bridge and surfaces cannot be simply assumed to have a constant value (e.g. receding contact angle, \u03b8 r ). Simulation results for stretching a liquid bridge with and without CAH, showed that the contact line pinning can lead to breakage at a larger surface separation and smaller value of pull-off force (F  p ). A systematic study about the effect of CAH and contact line pinning on the value of F  p  is provided. It is found that when one of the surfaces has a \u03b8 r  larger than 90\u2218, F  p  decreases with the increase of \u03b8 r  on either surface delimiting the bridge. For the cases where \u03b8 r  of both surfaces are smaller than 90\u2218, significantly smaller F  p  is seen when contact line pinning occurs on both surfaces, as compared to F  p  when contact line pinning occurs only on one surface. This smaller F  p  is caused by more curved profile and later breakage of liquid bridge.",

Particular attention is given to nding CFL-like conditions under which the schemes are positivity-preserving (i.e. density and internal energy remain nonnegative). The rst-order BGK schemes are linear combinations of collisionless (i.e. kinetic flux-splitting scheme) and collisional approach. We show that the collisionless approach preserves the positivity of density and in- ternal energy under the standard CFL condition. Although the collisionless approach has the positivity-preserving property, it introduces large intrinsic dissipation and heat conductions since the corresponding scheme is based on two half Maxwellians. In order to reduce the viscous error, one obvious method is to use an exact Maxwellian, which leads to the collisional Boltzmann scheme. An CFL-like condition is also found for the collisional approach, which works well for the test problems available in literature. However, by considering a counterexample we nd that the collisional approach is not always positivity-preserving. The BGK type schemes are formed by taking the advantages of both approaches, i.e. the less dissipative scheme (collisional) and the more dissipative but positivity-preserving scheme (collisionless).",

        "abstract": "Little is known about the environmental behavior of fenhexamid (FEN) in aquatic ecosystems such as degradation and bioaccumulation, in spite of the fact that it is critical for a comprehensive assessment of its ecological risks. This study investigated for the first time the degradation of FEN in water-sediment systems under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and also bioaccumulation by zebrafish (Danio rerio). Water and sediments from different natural waters including river HR and lake HL were applied to build up water-sediment microcosms in the laboratory. When FEN was introduced into the aqueous phase, it would partition from water to sediment gradually and be decomposed in sediment compartment. The dissipation half-lives of FEN in water were 43.8, 75.9, 31.3, and 37.2 days for HR-aerobic, HR-anaerobic, HL-aerobic, and HL-anaerobic microcosms, respectively. Moreover, FEN degradation rate constants of whole systems varied from 0.0045 to 0.0088 per day and the half-lives were from 78.4 to 155 days. The aerobic circumstances were demonstrated to be favor of FEN degradation. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) was 2.6\u20133.1 obtained from zebrafish exposure experiments at environmentally relevant concentrations. Clearly, our results indicated that FEN could be accumulated in the deeper layer of sediment owing to the anaerobic condition against FEN degradation, but FEN showed a low potential for bioaccumulation. These may aid in comprehensive understanding the fate and risk of FEN in aquatic environment.",

        "abstract": "Levonorgestrel (LNG) and quinestrol (QUN) are typical endocrine disruptors that enter the soil via sewage irrigation and sludge return. However, the fates of both compounds in soil are not well understood. Laboratory microcosm studies were conducted to fill the gap of understanding LNG and QUN behavior in soils. High values of goodness-of-fit indices (GFIs) were obtained using the double-first-order in parallel (DFOP) model and the single first-order (SFO) model to fit the degradation kinetics of LNG and QUN in soils, respectively. The end-points (DT50 and DT90) of LNG and QUN were positive correlated with soil TOC. Soil water content and temperature were observed to be critical factors in degradation of LNG and QUN. The degradation rates of LNG and QUN were very slow under sterile and flooded conditions, indicating the aerobic microbial degradation was dominant in the degradation of LNG and QUN. Moreover, major transformation products were identified and biodegradation pathways of LNG and QUN were proposed. The present study is expected to provide basic information for ecological risk assessment of LNG and QUN in soil compartment.",

        "abstract": "Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO-NPs) are widely distributed in the environment. It has been demonstrated that TiO-NPs could modify the environmental fate and bioavailability of organic pollutants, which affects ecological risks of TiO-NPs and organic pollutants. In this study, the uptake, translocation and accumulation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) in pumpkin plants was investigated in the presence of TiO-NPs. We reported for the first time the negligible effects of TiO-NPs at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.05-5\u202fmg/L) on the uptake and accumulation of PFOA and PFOS in hydroponically grown pumpkin seedlings regardless of root, stem and leaf. This phenomenon was independent of the initial concentrations of PFOA/PFOS and TiO-NPs in the exposure solution. Also, seedling mass and contents of chlorophyll and anthocyanin were not affected by the co-exposure. Adsorption tests demonstrated the negligible adsorption of PFOA/PFOS on TiO-NPs in the exposure solution. Moreover, uptake of PFOA/PFOS was insensitive to aquaporin inhibitor AgNO but significantly inhibited by niflumic acid (anion channel blocker) and 2,4-dinitrophenol (metabolic inhibitor) whereas Ti concentration in root was not affected by niflumic acid and 2,4-dinitrophenol but significantly decreased by AgNO, indicating that transport of PFOA/PFOS and TiO-NPs were via different routes into the pumpkin seedling. It was proposed that different pathways by which TiO-NPs and PFOA/PFOS transported into the pumpkin seedling and negligible adsorption of PFOA/PFOS on TiO-NPs contributed to the negligible effects of TiO-NPs on the uptake, translocation and accumulation of PFOA/PFOS in pumpkin seedlings. In total, this work would improve our understanding of the ecological risks of TiO-NPs in the environment.",

        "abstract": "Water glasses with different modulus (molar ratio of SiO 2  to Na 2 O) were applied as a raw material to prepare five solid base catalysts for synthesizing glycerol carbonate (GC) by the transesterification reaction between glycerol and dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The structure and properties of the five water glass derived catalysts were investigated by XRD, FT-IR, FESEM, BET, and acid-base titration methods. The catalysts with relatively low modulus, including 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0, presented good catalytic abilities, among which the catalyst derived from water glass with 2.0 modulus (WG-2.0) was chosen as the optimal catalyst in the synthesis of GC. This was because WG-2.0 showed the highest BET surface area, relatively high total basicity, and less amount of NaOH needed during the preparation process. In the optimization experiments, this catalyst exhibited good catalytic ability with the glycerol conversion of 96.3\u00a0% and GC yield of 94.1 % under the condition of glycerol to DMC molar ratio of 1:4, WG-2.0 amount of 4 wt. %, reaction temperature of 348 K and reaction time of 90 mins. Furthermore, reusability experiment of WG-2.0 was also conducted and the results indicated that WG-2.0 could be reused five times without significant reduction in its catalytic ability.",

However, the low-order harmonics in stator currents, heavy computation burden and the utilization improvement of dc-link voltage are the key issues of FCS-MPCC schemes for multiphase machine drives. Thus, this paper proposes a FCS-MPCC scheme with the optimized duty ratio (MPCC-ODR) for five-phase machine drives.
