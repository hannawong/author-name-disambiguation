        "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of CHG regimen (low-dose cytarabine, homoharringtonine with G-CSF priming) as an induction chemotherapy for elderly patients with high-risk MDS or acute myeloid leukemia transformed from MDS (MDS-AML).Thirty-three untreated patients (21 high-risk MDS and 12 MDS-AML) were enrolled in this study. Each patient was administered with the CHG regimen comprised of low-dose cytarabine (25 mg/day, days 1-14) and homoharringtonine (1 mg/day, days 1-14) by intravenous continuous infusion in combination with G-CSF (300 μg/day) by subcutaneous injection from day 0 until neutrophil count recovery to 2.0 × 10(9)/L.The overall response rate (OR) was 66.7% after one course of the CHG regimen with 19 patients reaching CR (57.6%) and 3 patients reaching partial remission (PR) (9.1%). The median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months. Patients with normal serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) appeared longer median OS when compared to patients with high LDH level (18 months vs. 5 months, P = 0.011). Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 28% of patients, neutropenia in 34%. No treatment-related deaths occurred during the induction therapy.These data suggest that the CHG priming regimen is effective and safe as a novel induction therapy for elderly patients with high-risk MDS and MDS-AML. The results need to be conformed in further study involving a larger cohort of patients.",

        "abstract": "The pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) has not been completely understood, and insufficiency of the hematopoietic microenvironment can be an important factor. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and osteoblasts are key components of the hematopoietic microenvironment. Here, we measured the expression of multiple osteogenic genes in 58 MSCs from MDS patients with different disease stages and subtypes by real-time PCR and compared the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs from 20 MDS patients with those of MSCs from eight normal controls quantitatively and dynamically. The mRNA level of Osterix and RUNX2, two key factors involved in the early differentiation process toward osteoblasts, was significantly reduced in undifferentiated MSCs from lower-risk MDS. After osteogenic induction, lower-risk MDS showed lower alkaline phosphatase activity, less intense alizarin red S staining, and lower gene expression of osteogenic differentiation markers; however, higher-risk MDS was normal. Finally, in bone marrow biopsy, the number of osteoblasts was significantly decreased in lower-risk MDS. These results indicate that MSCs from lower-risk MDS have impaired osteogenic differentiation functions, suggesting their insufficient stromal support in MDS.",

Upon UV irradiation, the adjacent interfaces of the multilayer reacted to form a covalently crosslinking structure which greatly improved the stability of the films as confirmed by solvent etching experiments. These changes were confirmed by UV-Vis and FTIR spectroscopy. The thickness of the covalently attached films were characterized with small angle X-ray diffraction (SAXD) and a value of 30.0 Å per bilayer was obtained. This type of film was further characterized by cyclic voltammetry which showed that the electroactive property of PAPSAH was still kept in the films after photoreaction.",

In this paper, a novel method is proposed for designing maximally flat IIR filters with flat group delay responses in the passband. First, a system of linear equations are derived from the flatness conditions of IIR filters given in the passband and stopband, respectively. Then, a set of filter coefficients can be easily obtained by simply solving this system of linear equations. In the proposed design method, the flatness of the frequency response can be specified arbitrarily. The design of lowpass filters are described in detail, and bandpass and bandstop filters are given also. Moreover, the causality and stability of the proposed maximally flat IIR filters are examined by designing various IIR filters with different group delays. It is shown from the experimental results that the obtained maximally flat IIR filters are causal stable if the group delay is set to be larger than a specific value. Finally, some design examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed maximally flat IIR filters.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Water dissolves salt into ions and then hydrates the ions to form an aqueous solution. Hydration of ions deforms the hydrogen bonding network and triggers the solution with what the pure water never shows such as conductivity, molecular diffusivity, thermal stability, surface stress, solubility, and viscosity, having enormous impact to many branches in biochemistry, chemistry, physics, and energy and environmental industry sectors. However, regulations for the solute-solute-solvent interactions are still open for exploration. From the perspective of the screened ionic polarization and O:H–O bond relaxation, this treatise features the recent progress and a perspective in understanding the hydration dynamics of Hofmeister ions in the typical YI, NaX, ZX 2 , and NaT salt solutions (Y = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; X = F, Cl, Br, I; Z = Mg, Ca, Ba, Sr; T = ClO 4 , NO 3 , HSO 4 , SCN). Phonon spectrometric analysis turned out the  f (C) number fraction of bonds transition from the mode of deionized water to the hydrating. The linear  f ( C ) ∝  C  form features the invariant hydration volume of small cations that are fully-screened by their hydration H 2 O dipoles. The nonlinear  f ( C ) ∝ 1 - exp.(- C/C  0 ) form describes that the number insufficiency of the ordered hydrating H 2 O dipoles partially screens the anions. Molecular anions show stronger yet shorter electric field of dipoles. The screened ionic polarization, inter-solute interaction, and O:H–O bond transition unify the solution conductivity, surface stress, viscosity, and critical energies for phase transition.",

We clarified the following: (1) atomic under-coordination shortens and stiffens the P-P bond, which raises the B-2g and A(g)(2) phonon frequency and widens the bandgap, (2) bond thermal elongation and weakening soften all phononmodes, and (3) bond mechanical compression has the opposite effect of heating on phonon frequency relaxation. The phonon and photon energy depends on the bond length and energy, which determines the relevant elasticity and thermal stability of layered structure. More broadly, the approaches and findings of this work provide both insight into and efficient tools for further exploration of unusual behaviors of other two-dimensional substance.

Fundus photography was used to confirm and document the diagnosis. The diagnosis of both forms of AMD was made according to the criteria of the Sub-society of Fundus Disease, Chinese Ophthalmological Society.15.5% of the included population had AMD and 19 of them were exudative AMD. The prevalences of AMD in the age groups of 50-59, 60-69, 70-79 and more than 80 were identified as 5.7%, 13.5%, 20.2% and 23.5%, respectively (chi(2) = 27.97, P < 0.01). No statistical differences were found concerning atrophic and exudative AMD related to gender, education, daily focus time, smoking, alcohol consumption and systematic diseases. In the AMD patients, 5.1% and 36.2% of the eyes were identified as blind or with low vision. In exudative AMD patients, 23.3% and 63.3% of the eyes were identified as blind or with low vision. The visual acuity of eyes with exudative AMD was significantly lower than the visual acuity of atrophic AMD eyes. (chi(2) = 15.4, P < 0.01).The prevalence of AMD is high, and increasing with aging.

The ARROW-WTCP enables feasible deployment of ARROW-TCP from\n wired to wireless networks by providing a joint design of source and router algorithms. The protocol obtains the actual capacity\n of the wireless channel by calculating the queue variation in base station (BS) and adjusts the congestion window by using\n the feedback from its bottleneck link. The simulation results show that the ARROW-WTCP achieves strong stability, max-min\n fairness in dynamic networks, fast convergence to efficiency without introducing much excess traffic, and almost full link\n utilization in the steady state. It outperforms the XCP-B (eXplicit Control Protocol Blind), the wireless version of XCP,\n in terms of stability, fairness, convergence and utilization in wireless networks.",

In this work, GN-embedded carbon (GNEC) films were deposited by the electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) sputtering technique. Under a reverse diode bias which lifts the Dirac point of GNs to a higher value, the GNEC film/n-Si device achieved a high photocurrent responsivity of 0.35 A/W. The bias-modulated position of the Dirac point resulted in a tunable ON/OFF ratio and a variable spectral response peak. Moreover, due to the standing structured GNs keeping the transport channels, a response time of 2.2 μs was achieved. This work sheds light on the bias-control wavelength-sensitive photodetector applications.",

The results showed that all cells were cultured with Dexter system. By day 9-14 (at a median of 11.2 days), adherent cell colonies formed and reached their maximum at 15-22 days (mean 19.6 days), by day 28, all adherent cells spread over the bottom of Petri dish. By means of light microscopy, these cells were found to differentiate into three kinds of cells in culture of 28 days: fibroblast-liked cell, macrophage liked cell and small-round cells. The ratio of these three kinds of cells was 56.8%, 38%, 5.5% respectively. Cytochemistry assay revealed that the positive rate reached 100% in NSE stain and PAS stain; the adherent cell by ALP stain were shown 35% positive, but in POX stain the result was negative. Immunohistochemistry stain revealed that the positive rate of cord adherent cells for CD106, CD29, CD44, CD45, CD50, Fn, Ln, collagen IV etc reached 96%, 93%, 98%, 68%, 72%, 92%, 74%, 83% respectively.

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the histopathological changes of Weiss ring (prepapillary glial annulation) in patients with retinal detachment associated with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Methods: Three specimens of prepapillary glial tissue from eyes with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment were obtained during routine vitreoretinal surgery. All these specimens were prepared for immuno-electron staining for type I and III collagen and Fibronetin and light immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, S-100, Neuron-specific egolase (NSE) and CD68. Results: The specimens contained a moderate number of cells and an abundant extracellular matrix. Two morphologic distinguishable cell types were readily detected in these sections based on ultrastructure: epithelial-like cells with pigment and spindle-shaped or kidney-shaped cells with masses of intermediate filaments. These cells were separately arranged and surrounded by collagen fibers of type I and III with a stronger immunostaining for vimentin and GFAP and weaker staining for cytokeratin and furthermore exhibited rare positive staining for S-100, NSE and CD68. Conclusion: Astrocytes are not sole component in Weiss ring following retinal detachment. Fibroblast-like, retinal pigment epithelial cells and glial cells are also involved in the histopathological alteration of Weiss ring after retinal detachment associated with PVR.",

The separation efficiently of traditional precipitation-soxhlet extraction method was investigated, and a new centrifugal separation-combined with soxhlet extraction method was proposed. The chemical structures of HLS-Ca and the graft polymer (HLS-AA) were characterized by FT-IR, UV and 1H-NMR. The results showed that compared with traditional method, the new separation method is more effective to separate the graft polymer from homopolymer and unreacted HLS-Ca. The band at 1727 cm-1 in FT-IR spectrum is assigned to carbonyl absorption; the stronger absorbed band at 210 nm in the UV spectrum can be observed in HLS-AA and the signals between 10 and 14, assigned to the absorption for carboxyl hydrogen, also can be observed in the 1H-NMR spectrum of HLS-AA.",

The RCI of the larvae treated with soy for 12,24,36 and 48 hr was 13.78,10.94,1.00 and 0.The RCI decreased along with the vinegar or soy treatment time(P<0.05).Conclusion Trichinella spiralis muscle larvae lost the infectivity completely after treating with vinegar for 6 hr or with soy for 48 hr.",

        "abstract": "Cet article présente une méthode nouvelle pour la conception de bancs de filtres d'ondelettes IIR orthonormaux bi-bande à l'aide de filtres passetout. II est bien connu ques les bases orthonormales d'ondelettes peuvent être générées par des bancs de filtres para-unitaires. De ce fait, la synthèse de bases d'ondelettes orthonormales peut être réduite à la conception de bancs de filtres para-unitaires. Dans cet article, des bancs de filtres d'ondelettes IIR orthonormales bi-bande utilisant la connexion parallèle de deux filtres passe-tout réels ou un filtre passe-tout complexe sont examinés. Du fait de la régularité des ondelettes une condition additionnelle de platitude imposée aux bancs de filtres est requise. Le problème de la conception de bancs de filtres d'ondelettes IIR orthonormales avec une condition de platitude donnée est donc discuté. A l'aide de la condition de platitude et de l'algorithme d’échange de Remez, ce problème de conception peut être formulé sous la forme d'un problème de valeurs propres. De ce fait, un ensemble de coefficients de filtre peut être facilement obtenu par résolution du problème de calcul de la valeur propre minimale en valeur absolue, et la solution optimale présentant un taux d'ondulation constant en réponse peut être obtenue après application d'une procédure itérative. La méthode proposée est efficiente du point de vue calculatoire puisque l'algorithme d’échange de Remez est employé, et que la condition de platitude peut être spécifiée arbitrairement. Quelques exemples de conception sont présentés pour illustrer l'effectivité de la méthode proposée.",

        "title": "QoS-Aware Power Allocations for Maximizing Effective Capacity Over Virtual-MIMO Wireless Networks",
        "abstract": "To enable multiple mobile users to transmit their signals simultaneously over the same sub-channels, the virtual multiple-input multiple-output (V-MIMO) techniques can exploit the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) spectrum efficiency gain. Traditional V-MIMO transmission schemes mainly focus on maximizing the throughput of grouped mobile users without taking into account the quality-of-service (QoS) provisionings. In this paper, we propose the optimal power allocation schemes with statistical QoS provisionings to maximize the effective capacity of non-collaborative/collaborative V-MIMO wireless networks, respectively. For non-collaborative V-MIMO wireless networks, the mobile users in one V-MIMO group transmit signals independently over the same sub-channels. In the view point of existing mobile users, they solely occupy the sub-channels. Thus, the existing mobile users employ the QoS-driven single-user power allocation scheme to maximize their effective capacity. By converting the non-collaborative V-MIMO transmission optimization problem into a strictly convex optimization problem, we derive the QoS-driven power allocation scheme for the newly added mobile users to maximize their effective capacity. For collaborative V-MIMO wireless networks where the mobile users in one group can collaboratively transmit their signals, we derive the QoS-driven collaborative power allocation schemes for both the existing and the newly added mobile users. Also conducted is a set of simulation evaluations, showing that our proposed power allocation schemes for V-MIMO wireless networks outperform the other existing schemes.",

        "abstract": "The optimal therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) who relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains unclear. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of sorafenib combined with other therapeutic strategies as salvage therapy for these patients. A total of 83 AML with FLT3-ITD relapsing after allo-HSCT were enrolled in this study. Fifty-three patients received salvage therapy containing sorafenib, and 30 patients did not. Salvage therapy containing sorafenib was superior to that without sorafenib with respect to complete remission rates, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) (66.0% vs 30.0%, 46.8% vs 20.0%, 44.9% vs 16.7%; P=0.002, P=0.003, P=0.001). Further subgroup analysis revealed that the OS and PFS of patients who received sorafenib combined with chemotherapy followed by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) were superior to those receiving other therapeutic regimens, including sorafenib combined with chemotherapy, chemotherapy followed by DLI, and monochemotherapy (P=0.003, P<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that salvage therapy including sorafenib was the only protective factor for longer OS (P=0.035, hazard ratio (HR)=0.526); salvage therapy including sorafenib and DLI were the protective factors for longer PFS (P=0.011, HR=0.423; P=0.019, HR=0.508). Our data suggest that sorafenib therapy is associated with improved outcomes for FLT3-ITD AML relapsing after allo-HSCT, and whether sorafenib combined with chemotherapy followed by DLI reveals an optimal efficacy merits further study.",

        "abstract": "To determine the progression rate and risk factors for diabetic retinopathy (DR) in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients who have reached the target hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level recommended by the American Diabetes Association.This was a 5-year community-based prospective study. The study population consisted of patients with type 2 diabetes with HbA1c less than 7.0%. Demographic information, systemic examination results and ophthalmological test results for each participant were collected. The outcome of this study was the progression of DR, which was defined as an increase in DR grade in one or both eyes at the final visit in comparison to the baseline status. The association between each potential risk factor and DR progression was studied.A total of 453 patients with HbA1c less than 7.0% were included in the study group. In 146 patients (32.22%), DR developed or progressed during the five-year follow-up. Baseline HbA1c level was the only independent risk factor for DR progression (p<0.01, OR = 2.84, 95%CI: 2.11~3.82). The logistic regression function suggested that the possibility of DR progression increased fastest when baseline HbA1c increased from 5.2% to 6.4%. The 5-year DR progression rate in patients with baseline HbA1c less than 5.2%, between 5.2% and 6.4%, and over 6.4% were 19.62%, 24.41%, and 76.83%, respectively.To slow the progression of DR in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes, more intensive glucose control is recommended.",

        "abstract": "We have explored the effects of atoms under-coordination on surface structure relaxation, binding energy shift of W stepped surfaces and valence charge polarization by the method of incorporating bond order-length-strength (BOLS) correlation mechanism into high-resolution X-ray photoluminescence spectra (XPS) measurements as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Results show that the 4f7/2 energy levels of bulk, surface skin and step edge W atoms shift deeper from 2.17 to 2.69 eV with respect to that of the isolated W (28.91±0.01 eV) atoms, while the valence charge energy shift upper from inner to outer layer and from bulk to stepped edge. The surface bond contraction occurs around under-coordinated atoms after geometry relaxation calculation. Consistency among BOLS calculations, DFT calculation and experimental measurements clarifies that the surface bond contraction and consolidation due to the effects of under-coordination atoms induce potential trap depression, which provides perturbation to the Hamiltonian and hence contributes to the surface core level shift deeper, and that the surface valence charge are polarized by the densely trapped core-level electrons to upper energy. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "In this article we propose a cross-layer design model for multimedia multicast/broadcast services to efficiently support the diverse quality of service requirements over mobile wireless networks. Specifically, we aim at achieving high system throughput for multimedia multicast/broadcast while satisfying QoS requirements from different protocol layers. First, at the physical layer, we propose a dynamic rate adaptation scheme to optimize the average throughput subject to the loss rate QoS constraint specified from the upper-layer protocol users. We investigate scenarios with either independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) or non-i.i.d. fading channels connecting to different multicast receivers. Then, applying the effective capacity theory at the data link layer, we study the impact of the delay QoS requirement (i.e., QoS exponent) on the multimedia data rate of mobile multicast/broadcast that our proposed scheme can support. Also presented are simulation results which show the trade-off among different QoS metrics and the performance superiority of our proposed scheme as compared to the other existing schemes.",

        "abstract": "Fetal liver tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplications (ITDs) has been used as a powerful adverse prognostic indicator for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in any age group. Evidence is mixed regarding the effects of allogeneic transplantation (allo-HSCT) in first complete remission (CR) for patients with FLT3/ITD AML. To fill this gap, this study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of patients with FLT3/ITD AML receiving HSCT. A search of PubMed, Embase, and OVID yielded 1706 abstracts, two researchers screening the trials based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and assessed the methodology quality independently. Meta-analysis showed that compared with chemotherapy, both allo-HSCT and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) can reduce the relapse rate (p < 0.01) and improve both the OS (p < 0.01) and DFS (p < 0.01). But when compared allo-HSCT with auto-HSCT, the OS (p = 0.27) and DFS (p = 0.19) have no statistical significance, and only the relapse indicator has statistical significance, p < 0.01. Based on the results, we can conclude that allo-HSCT is an efficient therapy approach for patients with FLT3/ITD AML. Chemotherapy cannot change the poor prognosis. Auto-HSCT can improve OS and DFS, but it cannot reduce the relapse rate.",

Considering the thin nature of Walloon coals, the fracture growth across the stiffer beds becomes a key issue in assessing the fracture treatment efficiency and in determining the impacts of fracture stimulation on groundwater resources. A hydraulic fracture model considering the elastic property difference across layers is developed to obtain the fracture growth behaviours in a multiple layer formation. A case study was performed where the in situ stress across beds is of similar magnitudes to highlight the effect of property difference. The fracture initiates at the targeted lower coal seam and the complex footprints generated by fracture growth are obtained. In contrast to the assumed constant fracture height and the large fracture height to length ratio obtained by other layer models, the vertical fracture growth is limited in the propagation speed by the alternating stiff and compliant rocks. The alternating growth in lateral and vertical directions results in an oscillating pressure, which is an indicative for fracture height growth.",

        "abstract": "Mth-band filters have been found numerous applications in multirate signal processing systems, filter banks and wavelets. In this paper, a new closed-form expression is pre- sented for the impulse response of the maxflat R-regular FIR Mth-band filters with arbitrary group delay. The filter coef- ficients are directly obtained by solving a linear system of Vandermonde equations that are derived from the regular- ity conditions via waveform moments. Moreover, the group delay of the proposed FIR Mth-band filters can be arbitrar- ily specified. Finally, some design examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed maxflat R- regular FIR Mth-band filters. Mth-band filters are an important class of digital filters and are often used in multirate digital signal processing systems, filter banks and wavelets, and so on. Its impulse response is required to be exactly zero-crossing except for one point. FIR Mth-band filters with exact linear phase have been stud- ied exhaustively in (1)»(6). Among these methods, a closed- form solution is given for the maxflat R-regular FIR Mth- band filters with exact linear phase in (4) and (5), while the minimax solution can be found in (1) and (3). However, a larger delay results when higher order FIR linear phase filters are needed. This is because the group delay is equal to half the filter order for the exact linear phase FIR filters. In some applications of real-time signal processing, a lower delay is generally needed. For this reason, FIR Mth-band filters with arbitrary group delay need to be considered. For the design of FIR Mth-band filters with arbitrary group delay, a closed- form solution is given only for a specific class of the maxflat R-regular FIR Mth-band filters in (2), while the optimal so- lution with equiripple response in stopband can be found in (8). The design of a general class of the maxflat R-regular FIR Mth-band filters with arbitrary group delay is still open. In this paper, we will consider the design of a general class of the maxflat R-regular FIR Mth-band filters with ar- bitrary group delay. A new closed-form expression for its impulse response is presented. In the proposed method, we derive a linear system of Vandermonde equations from the regularity conditions of the Mth-band filters via the block- wise waveform moments defined in (7), and then can get a set of filter coefficients by applying the Cramer's formula and Vandermonde's determinant. Moreover, the group delay of the proposed FIR Mth-band filters can be arbitrarily spec- ified. Finally, some examples are designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed maxflat R-regular FIR Mth- band filters with arbitrary group delay.",

        "abstract": "\n The Chinese burgeoning Internet population will soon have an array of 3D virtual worlds in which to work and play. Second\n Life, a particularly well-known 3D virtual world, is also present in the Chinese market. However, Second Life faces some dilemmas\n in Mainland China; especially since its western model has not been widely accepted by Chinese users. It also faces a challenge\n from the Chinese local virtual world, HiPiHi. The many stories about the demise of foreign companies are a warning that the\n western Internet business may not succeed in China, although some local competitors may survive, such as \n Taobao\n \n in e-commerce and QQ in the instant message field. Which virtual worlds will succeed in China in the long run This chapter\n compares the different strategies between Second Life and HiPiHi, and explores how these different strategies impact on user\n acceptance in the Chinese environment. Finally, we discuss how the emerging 3D virtual worlds are likely to develop in China.\n \n ",

        "abstract": "Biochar amendment has been recommended as a potential strategy to mitigate nitrous oxide (NO) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions for wheat production, but its mechanism and effective duration are not well understood. The 1-octyne and 2-pheny l-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO) in combination with potassium chlorate were used to evaluate the relative contribution of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) to potential ammonia oxidation (PAO) and NO and NO production as affected by biochar. Acidic and alkaline soils were collected during wheat-growing season, and four treatments were installed in each soil type: CK, urea alone; BE, biochar-enriched soil for 2-6 years; FB, fresh biochar added to CK; and AB, aged biochar added to CK. The results showed that octyne and PTIO efficiently assessed AOB and AOA activities in soil incubation. The AOB-driven PAO in acidic soil was largely enhanced by increased soil pH in BE and FB treatments, whereas AOA-driven PAO was not. And the contribution of AOB to PAO exceeded 80% in alkaline soil. The NO and NO production were positively correlated with PAO in both soils. BE treatment decreased the direct NO and NO production in alkaline soil, while both BE and FB treatments decreased the NO and NO yields in acidic soil, indicating that biochar mitigated soil NO and NO emissions for wheat production. The lack of differences between AB and CK treatments indicated that aged biochar lost its initial effects on PAO, while the biochar-enriched soil amended with biochar years earlier still functioned similarly as fresh biochar.",

Cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), a bulky hydrophilic head, was utilized to encapsulate the two end groups of the PDI derivative  host-guest interactions, thus hindering its aggregation and suppressing the dimerization and quenching of PDI radical anions in aqueous solution. Due to the increased concentration of radical anions and their absorption above 800 nm, the efficiency of NIR photothermal conversion was significantly improved. Compared with free radicals fabricated by covalent chemistry, the supramolecular free radicals established here could provide a facile approach for the promoted formation of aromatic free radicals, thus opening up a new strategy for the design of NIR photothermal materials with enhanced photothermal conversion.",

This polymer was composed of hydrophilic ethylene diamine epichlorohydrin slightly crosslinked microgel and hydrophobic stearic chains, noted as ES-1. The introduction of Cd2+ ions in subphase had a marked effect on the process of the organization of the amphiphilic polymer at the air/water interface due to the association of Cd2+ ions with the hydrophilic network, which could be indicated by the pressure-area isotherms and Brewster Angle Microscopy. Ordered ES-1/Cd2+ LB multilayers were fabricated. After the multilayers reacted with H2S gas, CdS clusters were synthesized within the film, which was characterized by X-ray diffraction and UV-visible spectroscopy. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.",

        "abstract": "Objective To perform a cost-utility analysis of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) surgery. Methods Data of 117 patients who underwent RRD surgeries were collected in Shanghai First People's Hospital, Affiliated Shanghai Jiaotong University, and were followed up for at least one year. Costs associated with surgery were recorded. Utility values of RRD surgery were obtained by using time trade-off (TTO) method, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using the patients’ life expectancy at 3% discounted rate. Incremental cost-utility analysis was performed (as compared to no treatment) by calculating incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which means the mean incremental cost for each QALY. Bootstrap method was used to make statistical analysis , and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed to test robustness of the results. Results Mean incremental cost of RRD surgery was RMB 8 471 yuan [95% confidence interval (CI) 7 716～9 227 yuan], mean additional QALY gained was 1.24 (95%CI 0.73～1.76), and the incremental cost for each additional QALY was RMB 6 819 yuan (95%CI 4 711～ 11 816 yuan), among which, for scleral buckling surgery, the incremental cost for each additional QALY was RMB 4 892 yuan (95%CI 3 366～8 971 yuan), and for vitreous surgery, the incremental cost for each additional QALY was RMB 17 134 yuan (95%CI 8 824～73 110 yuan). Conclusion For RRD patients, the surgery does help them obtain more quality-adjusted life years, and the incremental costs for each QALY gained are 6 819 yuan.",

        "abstract": "The features of cytogenetic response have been not well described in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients receiving low-dose decitabine treatment. In this study, we observed and analyzed the response characteristics based on the revised IPSS (IPSS-R) cytogenetic risk stratification in eighty-seven MDS patients who received low-dose decitabine treatment (15-20 mg/M(2)/d×5/per course). Twenty-seven of 44 patients (61.3%) with abnormal karyotypes achieved a cytogenetic response, including 18 cases with complete cytogenetic response (cCR). The patients carrying poor or very poor karyotypes achieved better clinical and cytogenetic response than those with intermediate or good karyotypes. Among the patients with poor or very poor karyotypes, those carrying chromosome 7 aberrance showed a better treatment response than the other patients. Four patients (22.2%) of the patients who achieved clinical CR presented with a cytogenetic PR (partial response) or NR (no response). Over 5% of the clonal cells determined by FISH analysis were in the two patients who presented cytogenetic CR. Longer median OS (24 months) were observed in the patients who achieved a cytogenetic response than in those who did not (12 months) (P=0.007). The patients with poor or very poor karyotypes could achieve survival comparable to that of the patients with good or very good karyotypes after decitabine treatment (18 vs. 20 months, P=0.365). IPSS-R cytogenetic risk stratification could be used to predict the clinical and cytogenetic response to decitabine treatment in MDS patients, and the predicting effect may be related to chromosome 7 involvement. Analysis with FISH and G-banding should be available in determining the minimal residual disease in MDS patients after treatment.",

        "abstract": "HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) may be an option for severe aplastic anemia (SAA) patients. However, to date, no large-sample studies have been performed to determine which types of SAA patients are suitable for HLA-haploidentical HSCT. We retrospectively studied 189 consecutive patients with SAA who underwent HLA-identical or HLA-haploidentical HSCT at seven transplant centers in China. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied in this study to reduce the influence of potential confounders. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 72.0% in the HLA-haploidentical group and 76.5% in the HLA-identical group. The median time to achieve engraftment and the incidence of acute GVHD/chronic GVHD were not significantly different between the two groups. In the subgroup analysis, the outcome of patients older than 40 years in the HLA-haploidentical group was significantly poorer than that of patients younger than 40 years in the same group and that of patients older than 40 years in the HLA-identical group. Based on the above results, we suggest that HLA-haploidentical relative HSCT should be considered as a valid alternative option for patients younger than 40 years with SAA for whom no matched sibling donor is available.",

In this study, the TsGST gene was cloned, and recombinant TsGST (rTsGST) was produced. Anti-rTsGST serum recognized the native TsGST by Western blotting in crude antigens of ML, adult worm (AW) and newborn larvae (NBL) of T. spiralis, but not in ML excretory-secretory (ES) antigens. Expression of TsGST was observed in all different developmental stages (IIL, AW, NBL and ML). An immunolocalization analysis identified TsGST in the cuticle, stichosome and genital primordium of the parasite. The rTsGST had GST enzymatic activity. After a challenge infection with T. spiralis larvae, mice immunized with rTsGST displayed a 35.71% reduction in adult worms and a 38.55% reduction in muscle larvae. The vaccination of mice with rTsGST induced the Th1/Th2-mixed type of immune response with Th2 predominant (high levels of IgG1) and partial protective immunity against T. spiralis infection.",

However, due to the effect of product inhibition, supramolecular catalysts are usually added in stoichiometric amounts. Herein, we report a supramolecular catalysis system in which 1% of the supramolecular catalyst, cucurbit[8]uril, is able to significantly accelerate the photodimerization of Brooker's merocyanine. This catalytic process is realized in a cyclic manner because the photodimerized product can be spontaneously replaced by monomeric reactants  competitive host-guest complexation. Thus, a catalytic amount of cucurbit[8]uril is sufficient to accomplish photodimerization within 10 min. This line of research will enrich the field of supramolecular catalysis and allow the development of more efficient catalytic systems.",

Trends consistency between calculations and experimental observations confirmed our predictions [Chem. Rev. 2015, 115, 6746] that the shorter-and-stronger bonds between undercoordinated atoms induce the local densification and quantum entrapment of the core electrons, which in turn polarize the valence electrons dominating the catalytic and magnetic performance of the clusters. The excessive charge states has an important impact to the magnetization of M-N. Specifically, even excessive charge states addition induces magnetization of all the M-N clusters while odd excessive charge addition affects only Pt and Rh clusters. Observations provide insight on the relationship between excessive charge and the intrinsic effect of the atomic undercoordination on the catalytic and magnetic properties of M-N nanoclusters.",

The data was first analyzed using KPCA, i.e., through a nonlinear mapping function, the data was projected from the input space to feature space and calculated Hotelling'sT2 and Q statistics of the samples. If statistics value exceeded confidence limits of T2 and Q plots, it calculated nonlinear PC scores of fault data and then the nonlinear PC scores were fed into the well training multiple PSVMS to diagnose fault category. The proposed process monitoring and fault detection method could effectively capture the nonlinear relationship in process variables. Its performance significantly outperforms method based on PCA-PSVM. Simulating of the turbo generator fault data set proves that the method is effective.",

        "abstract": "We reported that the irradiation to a novel amphiphilic rhenium (I) complex resulted to the photoisomerization of ligand 4′-nitrostilbazole that coordinated to the complex in solution and at air/water interface. π–a isotherms and FT-IR spectra demonstrated that the photoisomerization of the complex would lead to small change of area per molecule and stacking of molecules became more orderly than those without photoisomerization. The electronic spectra proved that the photoisomerization had influence to the metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition of the complex, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement showed the aggregate formation on the surface after irradiation to the complex.",

        "abstract": "With the explosive development of the next era for mobile wireless networks, there has been a lot of studies in the promising techniques for multimedia services - the statistical quality-of-service (QoS) technique, which has been proved to be effective in statistically guaranteeing delay-bounded video transmissions over the time-varying wireless channels. On the other hand, as the 5G-promising techniques, multiple input multiple output-orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (MIMO-OFDMA) based cognitive radio schemes are proposed to significantly improve the system capacity while mitigate the interference for future dynamic spectrum access networks. However, due to the heterogeneity caused by different links of simultaneous traffics over the wireless relay, supporting diverse delay-bounded QoS guarantees for MIMO-OFDMA based cognitive radio networks (CRNs) imposes many new challenges not encountered before. To effectively overcome the aforementioned problems, in this paper we propose the heterogeneous QoS- driven resource allocation scheme by applying the MIMO-OFDMA based relaying scheme over CRNs. In particular, under the Nakagami-m fading model, we establish the MIMO-OFDMA based system model. Then, given the heterogeneous statistical QoS constraints, we derive and analyze the effective capacity under our developed optimal power-allocation policies for the MIMO- OFDMA based CRNs. Also conducted is a set of simulations which show that our proposed scheme outperforms the other existing schemes in terms of effective capacity to efficiently implement the heterogeneous statistical QoS over MIMO-OFDMA based CRNs.",

        "abstract": "Mobile cloud-computing is a wireless network environment that focuses on sharing the publicly available wireless resources. Wireless network virtualization provides an efficient technique to implement the mobile cloud-computing by enabling multiple virtual wireless networks to be mapped onto one physical substrate wireless network. One of the most important challenges of this technique lies in how to efficiently allocate the wireless resources of physical wireless networks to the multiple virtual wireless network users. To overcome these difficulties, in this paper we propose the Bayesian-game based schemes to resolve the wireless resources allocation problem in terms of transmit power and wireless spectrum. We formulate this wireless resources allocation problem as the gaming process where each mobile user bids for the limited wireless resources from physical substrate wireless networks, and competes with the other mobile-user players bidding for the same resources. Since the bidding strategies for other mobile-user players are incomplete information, we propose the Bayesian-game based schemes to dictate the virtual users to request wireless resources based on the probabilities of these incomplete information. Our proposed game is guaranteed to converge to the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, where each virtual user optimizes their resources request actions with the consideration to actions of the other mobile-user players. The extensive simulation results obtained validate and evaluate our proposed schemes.",

The Pure. max, Pure.closure.max and urethral functional length of pregnant women in static urethral pressure profile were respectively higher than those of control group. However, Abrams-Griffiths number (AG) and urethral resistance factor (URA) of pregnant women showed that no one locate in obstructed area, and the significant differences in AG and URA between pregnant women and control group were no found. There were no significant differences in Qmax,max cystometric capacity(MCC),bladder compliance(BC), Pdet before voiding ,Pdet at Qmax and Pdet.max among two groups. There was contraction after voiding in twenty-nine pregnant women and it was significantly higher than that of control group.Detrusor instability were found in eight pregnant women.Conclusion:It is suggested that bladders of women in the pregnant women are sensitive and static urethral pressure parameters increased, but the ability of emptying bladder is still normal.",

It was performed to describe the prevalence of iERM and possible demographic, systemic, and ocular factors associated with iERM. Each participant underwent a standardized interview and comprehensive ophthalmic examination. iERM was identified and graded from retinal photographs. Then, a case-control study comparing the participants with vs. without iERM was performed to further study the associations between iERM and blood biochemical test results (including fasting plasma glucose, serum creatinine, total cholesterol, and triglyceride), ocular biological parameters (including the axial length, corneal curvature, refractive diopter, intraocular press, and anterior chamber depth), and the data of optical coherence tomography.The prevalence of iERM was 1.02%. iERM was significantly associated with diabetes (OR: 2.457; 95% CI: 1.137, 5.309) and a higher level of education (OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.123, 1.952). Blood biochemical test results and ocular biological parameters showed no significant differences between the iERM and control groups, whereas the incidence of posterior vitreous detachment in the iERM group was much higher than in the control group (26.5% vs. 8.8%), but this difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, the eyes with iERM had poorer visual acuity than the eyes without iERM (P<0.05).In Beixinjing Blocks, Shanghai, iERM was relatively rare, was associated with diabetes and a higher level of education, and caused a substantial decrease in visual acuity.",

        "abstract": "To identify the correlation between serum-based differentially expressed proteins and pathological myopia.It was a case-control study. The serum of 30 pathological myopia patients and 30 age- and gender-matched normal controls were collected from Shanghai First People's Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University. These patients were divided into 4 groups including macular-off retinal detachment (8 cases), retinal geographic atrophy (5 cases), macular hole (11 cases) and choroidal neovascular (6 cases). The serum specimens of normal controls were used as immunogen to immune rabbits in order to prepare polyclonal antibodies. Purified by Protein A cartridge, these mixed antibodies were then combined with CNBr-activated Sepharose so as to synthesize affinity medium which was finally used to treat the serum specimens. According to the theory of antigen and antibody, common background proteins would be deleted. The remaining non-binding proteins were analyzed by capillary high-performance liquid chromatography and LTQ-MASS. Nonparametric statistical analysis was used to detect the correlation each differentially expressed protein.The result of HPLC and LTQ-MASS in 30 specimens of patients revealed 4 peaks of differentially expressed proteins including JTR (positive in 18 specimens, 60%), HP( positive in 11 specimens, 36.7%), HPX (positive in 10 specimens, 33.3%), APO (positive in 8 specimens, 26.7%). There were positive correlations between these 4 proteins (the correlation between TTR and HP, HPX, APO is r = 0.480, 0.577, 0.492; the correlation between HP and TTR, HPX, APO is r = 0.480, 0.783, 0.636; the correlation between HPX and TTR, HP, APO is r = 0.577, 0.783, 0.853; the correlation between APO and TTR, HP, HPX is r = 0.492, 0.636, 0.853; P < 0.05). In group of macular hole, TTR was positive expressed in 7 specimens while other differential proteins were low expression. In group of choroidal neovascular, TTR and HP were positive expressed in 6 specimens while HPX was significantly high in 5 specimens. In other two groups, the expression of 4 differential proteins was rather low.Screening molecular biomarkers by serum-based proteomics can efficiently exclude common proteins and find differential proteins correlated with pathological myopia. These differential proteins may become molecular biomarkers of pathological myopia in the future.",

        "title": "Reconstruction of hematopoietic inductive microenvironment after transplantation of VCAM-1-modified human umbilical cord blood stromal cells.",
        "abstract": "The hematopoietic inductive microenvironment (HIM) is where hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells grow and develop. Hematopoietic stromal cells were the key components of the HIM. In our previous study, we had successfully cultured and isolated human cord blood-derived stromal cells (HUCBSCs) and demonstrated that they could secret hemopoietic growth factors such as GM-CSF, TPO, and SCF. However, it is still controversial whether HUCBSCs can be used for reconstruction of HIM. In this study, we first established a co-culture system of HUCBSCs and cord blood CD34(+) cells and then determined that using HUCBSCs as the adherent layer had significantly more newly formed colonies of each hematopoietic lineage than the control group, indicating that HUCBSCs had the ability to promote the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells/progenitor cells. Furthermore, the number of colonies was significantly higher in vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)-modified HUCBSCs, suggesting that the ability of HUCBSCs in promoting the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells/progenitor cells was further enhanced after having been modified with VCAM-1. Next, HUCBSCs were infused into a radiation-damaged animal model, in which the recovery of hematopoiesis was observed. The results demonstrate that the transplanted HUCBSCs were \"homed in\" to bone marrow and played roles in promoting the recovery of irradiation-induced hematopoietic damage and repairing HIM. Compared with the control group, the HUCBSC group had significantly superior effectiveness in terms of the recovery time for hemogram and myelogram, CFU-F, CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-Meg. Such differences were even more significant in VCAM-1-modified HUCBSCs group. We suggest that HUCBSCs are able to restore the functions of HIM and promote the recovery of radiation-induced hematopoietic damage. VCAM-1 plays an important role in supporting the repair of HIM damage.",

Manipulating Cx43 expression could be a potential therapeutic strategy for leukemia. Here, we investigate the effect of Cx43 expressed by BMSCs (human Umbilical Cord Stem Cells over-expressed CX43, Cx43-hUCSC) on leukemia cells. When co-cultured with Cx43-hUCSC, leukemia cells show significant lower growth rate with increasing apoptosis activity, and more leukemia cells enter S phase. Functional assays of fluorescence recovery after photo bleaching (FRAP) showed improved gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) on leukemia cells when co-cultured with Cx43-hUCSC (p < 0.01). In a mouse minimal disease model, the mean survival time and mortality rate were significantly improved in mice transplanted with Cx43-hUCSC. Our results indicate that Cx43 expressed by BMSC induces apoptosis on leukemia cells. Small molecules or other pharmaceutical approaches for modulating Cx43 expression in BMSCs could be used for delaying relapse of leukemia.",

Methods Immunohistochemical S-P method was used to examine the proteins in 55 case with primary colorectal carcinoma. Results The expression of cyclinD1 in colorectal carcinoma tissue was revealed in 24/55 samples(43.64%), that of p16 was in 26/55 samples(47.27%) and that of Rb was in 42/55 samples(76.36%) . There was a remarkable difference (P<0.01) in the expression of the cyclinD1,Rb and p16 between the death group and the survival group.The abnormal expression of Rb and p16 was accompanied by the carcinogenesis of colorectal carcinoma. The absence of p16 expression was related to metastasis of lymph node in colorectal carcinoma.Conclusion In the development of colorectal carcinoma, the expressions of cyclinD1,P16 and Rb are abnormal. The excessive expression of the cyclinD1,p16 and Rb is correlated closely with the occurrence and the prognosis of the carcinoma. It is significant for evaluating the prognosis of the carcinoma.",

        "abstract": "Titanium (Ti) implants have been commonly used in oral medicine. However, despite their widespread clinical application, these implants are susceptible to failure induced by microbial infection due to bacterial biofilm formation. Immobilization of chimeric peptides with antibacterial properties on the Ti surface may be a promising antimicrobial approach to inhibit biofilm formation. Here, chimeric peptides were designed by connecting three sequences (hBD-3-1/2/3) derived from human β-defensin-3 (hBD-3) with Ti-binding peptide-l (TBP-l: RKLPDAGPMHTW) via a triple glycine (G) linker to modify Ti surfaces. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the properties of individual domains of the chimeric peptides were evaluated for their binding activity toward the Ti surface. The antimicrobial and anti-biofilm efficacy of the peptides against initial settlers, Streptococcus oralis (S. oralis), Streptococcus gordonii (S. gordonii) and Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis), was evaluated with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to study cell membrane changes and the underlying antimicrobial mechanism. Compared with the other two peptides, TBP-1-GGG-hBD3-3 presented stronger antibacterial activity and remained stable in saliva and serum. Therefore, it was chosen as the best candidate to modify Ti surfaces in this study. This peptide inhibited the growth of initial streptococci and biofilm formation on Ti surfaces with no cytotoxicity to MC3T3-E1 cells. Disruption of the integrity of bacterial membranes and decreased expression of adhesion protein genes from S. gordonii revealed aspects of the antibacterial mechanism of TBP-1-GGG-hBD3-3. We conclude that engineered chimeric peptides with antimicrobial activity provide a potential solution for inhibiting biofilm formation on Ti surfaces to reduce or prevent the occurrence of peri-implant diseases.",

The percentages of enhanced EMG activities of chin and lower limb during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage were calculated. At the same time, the abnormal extremity movements during REM sleep stage were recorded. Results: In 3 cases, the percentage of REM sleep stage to total sleep duration was increased (29.37%-33.17%). The percentages of enhanced EMG activites of chin and lower limb accounted for 7.19%-14.76% and 0.11%-6.36% of REM sleep stage, respectively. Two patients presented increasing of abnormal extremity movements during REM sleep stage. Conclusion: AD patients may associate with RBD, which may be related to the injury of neural pathway engaged in REM regulation.",

In this study, we found MOFs could be used as signal probe. And this new class of signal probe differs from traditional probe. The signal of the copper ions (Cu2+) from MOFs could be directly detected without acid dissolution and preconcentration, which would greatly simplify the detection steps and reduce the detection time. Moreover, MOFs contain large amounts of Cu2+ ions, providing high electrochemical signals. Our report represents the first example of using MOFs themselves as electrochemical signal probe for biosensors. Platinum nanoparticle modified covalent organic frameworks (Pt-COFs) with high electronic conductivity was employed as the substrate, which is the first time demonstrating the use of Pt-COFs for electrochemical immunoassay. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the proposed sensing strategy provides a linear dynamic ranging from 1 to 400 ...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To accurately measure in situ stresses using overcore techniques, the key is to find the relationship between the stresses and measured strains on the wellbore wall and on the core at two stages, i.e. before and after overcoring. For gas shales, where there exist large pressure and temperature changes, we developed an analytical model for the stage before overcoring to study the evolution of all field variables, i.e. temperature, pressure, stress, strain and displacement (TPSSD), when an inclined wellbore is drilled in an infinite and homogenous thermo-poro-elastic media (THM) subjected to three far-field principal stresses, whose axes may not coincide with the horizontal and vertical planes. In that paper we investigated the thermal and poro-elastic effects on the strain changes around and especially at the wellbore wall. As an extension of the previous work. In this paper, we describe an analytical model to give the mechanical responses of the wellbore and core for the stage after overcoring. Strain changes at the wellbore wall are examined in detail because these are measured by the overcore method. By using the analytical solutions presented at a specific time and the strains before overcoring as an initial state, the transient solutions for the evolution of temperature, pressure, stress, strain and displacement (TPSSD) are obtained so that for the two critical stages before and after overcoring a reasonable estimate of the in situ stresses can be obtained. As well as the strain changes, the temperature and pressure at the wellbore wall, which vary with time, are also required to find in situ stresses in the inverse model. Fortunately, their effects become progressively less important with time due to the small size of overcored sample. The critical time is calculated when the thermal and porous effects can be ignored. Two cases, i.e. constant and exponentially time-varying temperature boundary conditions, are investigated.",

        "abstract": "In order to research how does hypomethylating agents ameliorate iron metabolism in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), we performed methylation-specific, polymerase chain reaction (MSP), bisulfate genomic sequencing polymerase chain reaction (BSP), quantitative real-time PCR and western blot of hemojuvelin (HJV) and ELISA assay for hepcidin before and after demethylating therapy (decitabine) to determine whether the change of HJV methylation status would have an influence on hepcidin expression. Eleven of 22 MDS patients achieved CR or PR according to IWG criteria (50%). HJV mRNA was induced in decitabine responders (p = .006 comparing pre/post decitabine treatment) but not in non-responders (p = .121). Similarly, hepcidin serum expression increased from 320.77 ± 34.8 μg/L to 366.77 ± 21.90 μg/L (p = .012) in responders but did not significantly change in non-responders (p = .058), while no difference of adjusted serum ferritin (ASF) was found. In conclusion, hypermethylation of HJV promoter region could silence the gene expression and demethylating therapy might ameliorate iron-overload through HJV demethylation.",

        "abstract": "Among numerous reasons for software project failure, coordination failure is considered as especially salient. Prior studies on coordination in software development are confined to team internal coordination and do not explicitly differentiate team internal and external coordination processes. This study proposes a research model to explain the antecedents of coordination effectiveness of software developer dyads from interacting teams. We explore the antecedents by integrating inter-personal coordination and technology-based coordination. Data were collected from 59 software developer dyads from different interacting teams as well as software developers' managers. The results reveal that implicit knowledge sharing has a significant positive impact on coordination effectiveness. Social capital (mutual trust and project commitment) has a significant impact on knowledge sharing with mutual trust directly affecting both implicit and explicit knowledge sharing. Project commitment also has a direct impact on explicit knowledge sharing and mutual trust, but it does not directly affect implicit knowledge sharing.",

Those rats were divided into NGF experimental group, placebo group, normal control groups and pathologic control group. NGF 1 g/L/eye was injected into vitreous every 4 days in NGF experimental group and 5 micro l of PBS intravitreal injection was used as control after RD. On postoperative time 1/2 d, 1 d, 2 d, 4 d, 8 d, 16 d, 32 d, rats were sacrificed and eyes were enucleated. The effect of NGF on retina was assessed by electron, light microscopy and cell counters.Histology studies showed markedly changes in photoreceptor cells, bipolar cells and ganglion cells after RD, included depletion and shorten of inner and outer segments, disturbance and thinness of inner and outer nuclear layer and swelling of ganglion cells in NGF treated group and control. Changes in the microscopic examination in NGF group showed significantly less than that in control groups, especially in inner and outer segments of photoreceptor cells. In reattached retina, the tissue structure and cell morphology showed more close to normal in NGF group than that in RD control groups. Cell counters showed the cell numbers decreased both in NGF groups and RD control groups. When retina reattached, the cell number in experimental groups showed significantly lower than that in normal control group (P < 0.05). Nuclear number of outernuclear layer and ganglion cell layer in NGF groups was greater than that in RD control groups (P < 0.05).Intravitreal injection exogenous NGF partly protects retinal cells from degeneration in experimental RD and help recovery of retinal cells after retina reattached.",

        "abstract": "Modified PVA films were prepared by casting method using urea/ethanolamine as a mixed plasticizer. The interactions between urea/ethanolamine and PVA molecules were investigated by FTIR spectra. The crystallinity of plasticized PVA film was measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) method. T m of modified PVA films was studied by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ). The mechanical properties of modified PVA films were studied by tensile testing. It was found that ethanolamine could prevent urea separating out from PVA and urea/ethanolamine mixture was a good plasticizer for PVA. FTIR spectra show that no significant structure difference between PVA and modified PVA, indicating that no chemical reaction happened between PVA and urea/ethanolamine. The shift of wavenumber shows that urea/ethanolamine can decrease the extent of inter- or intramolecular hydrogen bonds in PVA molecules. The XRD investigations show that the crystalline fraction significantly reduces with the addition of urea/ethanolamine. DSC shows that addition of urea/ethanolamine can reduce the T m of PVA film. T m of PVA film with 30 phr urea/ethanolamine can reduce to 199. 3°C. Modified PVA films show lower degree of swelling but higher solubility than that of pure PVA film. Urea/ethanolamine mixture can soften the PVA film, resulting in lower tensile strength and higher elongation at break. The tensile strength and elongation at break for PVA film modified with 30 phr urea/ethanolamine were 23. 89 MPa and 542. 88%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, hydroxyapatite nanotubes (HANTs) were explored as a novel environment-friendly additive for the fabrication of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes. Hydrophilic modification was conducted to the prepared HANTs, which includes the polydopamine (PDA) coating and the following grafting of taurine (TA), a kind of amino acid with -SO 3 H group. Subsequently, the modified HANTs (HANTs-DA-TA) were mixed with polyethersulfone (PES) to fabricate nanocomposite UF membranes. The prepared membranes were fully characterized, including the porosity, hydrophilicity, membrane morphology, and practical UF capability. The fabricated PES/HANTs-DA-TA membranes exhibited remarkably elevated water flux (up to 439 L m −2  h −1 ), which was ~2.6 times that of PES membrane (169 L m −2  h −1 ), whereas the rejection of PES/HANTs-DA-TA membranes was still kept at a high state. The improved flux mainly benefited from the more porous membrane structure, declined skin layer thickness, and the enhanced hydrophilicity. Meanwhile, the PES/HANTs-DA-TA membranes exhibited increased antifouling capability and the highest flux recovery ratio (FRR) reached 77.9% due to the improved surface hydrophilicity. Furthermore, the short rod-like nano hydroxyapatite (HA) was prepared and functionalized the same way as the HANTs-DA-TA. It was found that compared to rod-like HA, the tubular nano HA was more efficient in facilitating the membrane permeation due to the superiority of nanotubular structure. This work reveals that as a novel green additive, the HANTs have great application potential in fabricating water treatment membranes and can be employed for further studies.",

Then, depending on the supporting degree of data, under constraint of GPS or regional leveling observation displacement, and according to division of active massif of \"973\" project as geological basis, the inversion computation of aseismic negative dislocation model is carried out. The relation between deformation state of active massif and boundary fault structure reflected by numerical simulation results and seismicity is studied. Based on this, the anomaly characteristics and possible mechanism of regional horizontal and vertical tectonic deformation are qualitatively and horizontal and vertical tectonic deformation are qualitatively and quantitive studied. Some criteria of regional tectonic deformation anomalies before strong earthquakes are preliminary summarized on the basis of regional leveling, GPS observation and numerical simulation.",

        "abstract": "Airborne mobile wireless networks (AMWNs), which use spacecrafts and aircrafts such as satellites, airships, airplanes, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other high/medium/low-altitude platforms (HAPs/MAPs/LAPs) can efficiently support high dynamic network topologies and weakly connected communication links. Due to the dramatic dynamics of the AMWNs, it is very difficult to provide the deterministic delay-bounded quality of service (QoS) provisioning for time-sensitive real-time traffics (such as video and audio) over the AMWNs. Alternatively, the statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning provides an efficient way for guaranteeing delay-bounded QoS requirements for real-time traffics over the AMWNs. On the other hand, because of the diversity of real-time traffics, it is highly demanded to consider the heterogeneity of delay-bounded QoS requirements for distinct real-time services under different HAPs/MAPs/LAPs in the AMWNs. In this paper, we establish the heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning framework to support the diverse real-time services over the AMWNs. In particular, we formulate the optimization problem to maximize the aggregate effective capacity subject to heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS requirements for both downlink and uplink transmissions-based AMWNs groups (AMWNGs) in the AMWNs. We solve the aggregate effective capacity maximization problems and derive the optimal heterogeneous statistical QoS-driven power allocation schemes for the AMWNs. The numerical analyses we obtained verify that our developed optimal heterogeneous statistical QoS-driven power allocation schemes can significantly increase the aggregate effective capacity for the AMWNs than the other existing schemes.",

In addition, its antibacterial efficiency could be greatly enhanced by introducing metal ions. When Pd(II) was introduced into porphyrin, its antibacterial efficiency was enhanced from 40 to 100%. It should be noted that these small molecules showed little to no cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells even at concentrations higher than those under the antibacterial condition studied. This line of research will provide a strategy for germicides consisting of quaternary ammonium groups to fight against bacterial accumulation in the long term and holds huge potential for application in the real world.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper presents a new pseudo-3D (P3D) model for a hydraulic fracture growing in a layered rock with contrasts in both material properties and in situ stresses. In the model, the vertically planar fracture is divided along the lateral direction into cells. Within each cell, the cross-sectional deformation is plane strain, and the fluid pressure is allowed to vary vertically. The cells are discretized by displacement discontinuity elements that are formulated to include the elastic layered effect. The fluid flow in the cell is in two directions. Along the central part, which is of uniform pressure, the fluid flow is lateral, corresponding to the main component of fluid transport. Near the vertical fracture edge of a cell, the flow can be vertical and is generated by the vertical pressure gradient. This part of the cell is called the filling part. When the pressure in the filling part reaches the level equal to that in the central part, the flow direction switches from vertical to lateral. The filling and central parts both contribute to fracture height growth. The proposed P3D problem is solved in a coupled manner that accounts for the two-directional flow and cross-sectional deformation through a two-loop iterative method. In the outer loop, the fluid storage of the central part is updated by satisfying mass conservation in the lateral direction, and in the inner loop, the cross-sectional elastic deformation and the influxes to the filling parts are found by satisfying energy minimization subject to an equality constraint on the central-part volume of a cell. The results of pressure ad fracture width at a given elapsed time are thus obtained. After that, fracture growth in both lateral and vertical directions is controlled by the fracture toughness criterion based on linear elasticity. In describing the P3D model, the governing equations are provided and their dimensionless forms are derived. The numerical algorithm used for solving the P3D problem is also described. Numerical examples are presented, including a constant-height fracture, a radial one and asymmetric fractures in three-layered rocks. Comparisons of our results are made with other published results and good agreements between them are found.",

From the studies of the kinetic process of dendron thiol self-assembling on gold, it is shown that the dendron thiol assembling proceeds with different adsorption rates depending on the assembly time. In contrast to normal alkanethiols forming highly molecular structures on metal surfaces, the SAMs of polyether dendron form patterned surfaces with nanometer-sized features and in long-range order. It is found that the patterned stripes are closely related to the size of the dendron, and the patterned stripes can be improved by thermal annealing.",

        "abstract": "With the explosive developments of underwater acoustic communications, underwater acoustic communications have played a critically important role in many critical applications, such as oceanographic data collection, pollution monitoring, offshore exploration, disaster prevention, and tactical surveillance. Due to hash underwater environment, underwater acoustic communications impose new challenges to wireless communications research. Therefore, to guarantee the system performance with minimum resource consumption for underwater acoustic channel, we propose the novel statistical QoS-driven power adaptation over MIMO generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) [1] based underwater wireless networks. The objective of underwater acoustic communications is to transmit large-volume data information at a high-data rate with quality of service (QoS) provisioning. The statistical QoS guarantees [2], in terms of effective capacity and queue-length-bound/delay-bound violation probabilities, have been proposed and demonstrated as the powerful way to characterize delay QoS requirements for wireless traffics. On the other hand, to support the underwater acoustic wireless networks, for the last several years researchers have made a great deal of efforts in investigating various advanced wireless techniques, such as the MIMO-OFDM scheme [3]. However, the complicated application scenarios present new challenges making the OFDM less efficient in various underwater wireless networks. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, in this paper we propose the novel GFDM based scheme over underwater wireless networks.",

Methods:Urodynamics were measured on 29 volunteers after abdominal delivery (AD group) and 19 volunteers after vaginal delivery (VD group) 3~5 days after labor. Fourteen got women married but have not born and undergoing upper urinary tract diseases but with normal lower urinary tract function were the control. Results: Compared with those of the control group, Functional bladder volume (FBV) and normal desire cystometric capacity (NDCC) of AD group and VD group were lower(P<0.05), while the Pure.max, Pure.closure.max and the DI incidence were higher(P<0.05). The Pure.max, Pure.closure.max of AD group were higher than those of VD group(P<0.05). There were no significant differences in Qmax, max cystometric capacity, bladder compliance, Pdet before voiding, Pdet at Qmax and Pdet. Max. void among the three groups(P>0.05). Abrams-Griffiths number (AG) and urethral resistance factor (URA) also showed no obstruction locating at the bladder of AD group and VD group.Conclusion: It is suggested that bladders of women after labor are sensitive and static urethral pressure parameters increased, but the ability of emptying bladder is still normal during the short-term. The urinary tract function in women after vaginal delivery is lower than that of women after abdominal delivery.The effect of the two patterns of delivery on bladder function have no difference.",

Our protocol combines the advantages of the two radios operating in different frequency bands to result in highly energy-efficient operation. The design effectively addresses the two dominant sources of energy consumption in sensor network communication, namely the idle listening and the ephemeral burst data traffic. This paper presents the design rationale and extensive empirical performance evaluation of the protocol in terms of power consumption and latency under various traffic loads and duty cycles. Experimental performance comparison with B-MAC show high gains of our approach. We derive analytical expression for the optimum transmit power level ratio of the two radios giving minimum energy consumption. We also model the mathematical relationship for the optimal duty cycle of the nodes to a given network traffic load and validate it through the prototype implementation on commercially available sensor nodes.",

        "abstract": "Regardless of the salvage therapy used, primary induction failure in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (refractory ALL) and relapse after a complete remission (CR) are associated with dismal outcomes. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) may be the best treatment option for relapsed/refractory ALL. However, the outcome of allo-HSCT is very poor when a patient is not in CR. Quiescent leukemia cells protect them from the commonly used cell cycle-specific chemotherapeutic agents. Interleukin-2 (IL-2), a very well characterized T cell growth factor, is responsible for the progression of T lymphocytes from the G0 to the S phase of the cell cycle. IL-2 receptors are present on malignant T cells. Interaction of IL-2 with the IL-2 receptor triggers T cell proliferation, but T cells must change from a resting to an activated state, which leads to the de novo synthesis of IL-2 and expression of the IL-2 receptor. Thus, exogenous IL-2 administration is pivotal for the activation of T cells. Based on the findings above mentioned, we hypothesized that IL-2 priming chemotherapy improves the remission of refractory/relapsed T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

        "abstract": "By enabling two mobile devices, which are far away from the base station (BS) and very close to each other, to establish a direct link, device-to-device (D2D) communications can significantly increase the system throughput for wireless cellular networks. Traditional D2D schemes are mainly based on the half-duplex transmission mode. However, the short distance between the two D2D mobile devices can not only increase the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) but also increase the signal-to-self-interference-plus-noise ratio (SSINR), which motivates us to apply the wireless full-duplex transmission based D2D communications into wireless cellular networks. To further increase the ergodic capacity of the wireless cellular networks, in the paper we propose the full-duplex D2D communications framework for wireless cellular networks. In particular, we formulate the ergodic capacity optimization problem for full-duplex D2D communications based wireless cellular networks. To solve this optimization problem, we develop the optimal full-duplex power allocation schemes to maximize the ergodic capacity of the wireless cellular networks. Also conducted is a set of numerical and simulation results to evaluate the ergodic capacity gain of our proposed full-duplex power allocation schemes as compared with the traditional half-duplex transmission based D2D communications.",

        "title": "Sirolimus Is Effective in Refractory Immune Thrombocytopenia: Results of an Open-Label Prospective Multicenter Trial in China",
        "abstract": "Background: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease mainly due to increased destruction of platelets and decreased platelet production. Prednisone 1 mg/kg/d for 2 to 4 weeks has been the standard first-line treatment for many years. Splenectomy, rituximab and cyclosporine were commonly used second-line therapies. About 20-30% ITP patients have no response to both first-line and second-line therapies or cannot maintain the response and are diagnosed with refractory ITP. There is limited evidence for the treatment of refractory ITP. The international guideline for management of ITP suggested combined therapies but about half of the patients still fail to respond. In addition, thrombopoietin-receptor agonists are not available in China. Therefore, we investigated in alternative therapeutic options for the management refractory ITP in China.  Sirolimus (rapamycin) is an immunosuppressive compound that targets the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and has been shown to induce apoptosis of both normal and abnormal lymphocytes. Recently, it has been demonstrated that treatment with sirolimus could induce complete responses (CR) in patients with corticosteroid refractory autoimmune cytopenias, including four refractory ITP patients. Based on those studies, we initiated an open-label prospective multi-institutional clinical trial (ChiCTR-ONC-17012126) using sirolimus for patients with refractory ITP in Southwest China.  Methods: Refractory ITP was defined as platelet count  9 /L without other complications that may cause thrombocytopenia and patient has failed prednisone therapy and at least one 2 nd -line therapy (prednisone + cyclosporine / splenectomy / rituximab). Sirolimus was given at a dose of 2 mg per day orally (maximum initial dose of 4 mg/day) and target a trough level of 4-15 ng/ml in circulation. The anticipated length of treatment with sirolimus was 3 months, and then taped down 0.5mg per two weeks. Patients were followed up every week for 1 year. Platelet count was measured once a week. Complete response is defined as platelet count u003e 100×10 9 /L and partial response (PR) is defined as platelet count u003e 100×10 9 /L or increased more than two times. Side effects were evaluated during every visit.  Results: Between 01/2016 and 06/2016, 73 patients were included in the trial and 66 patients completed the trial and follow-up. In 66 patients, the median age was 47 (16-68) years; 77.3% were female; 48.5% ITP patients treated with prednisone + cyclosporine, 30.3% treated with prednisone + rituximab, 13.6% treated with prednisone + splenectomy, and 7.65% treated with prednisone + two of the four second-line treatments .  Fourty-six of 66 patients responded to the therapy (30 CR and 16 PR) within 3 months of sirolimus therapy. So the response rate and CR rate are 69.7% and 45.5% respectively. In patients with CR, the median duration of platelet recovery to 100×10 9 /L was 4 weeks (Figure 1). Risk factor analysis involving age, sex, previous treatment and platelet count before sirolimus treatment were undertaken to identify whether any factor might have an effect on the outcome of sirolimus treatment. As a result, platelet count prior to treatment was the only factor that affects the efficacy of sirolimus. During sirolimus treatment and reduction, 6 patients developed oral ulcers, 8 patients with hypertriglyceridemia, 6 patients with diarrhea and 2 patients with interstitial pneumonia. All side effects were grade 1-2 according to CTCAE 4.0.   Conclusion:  In summary, in our current study, more than half of the patients with refractory ITP responded to sirolimus. While the response rate is promising, there is limited evidence of side effects and long-term follow-up. Despite of this, it may worthwhile further investigations for larger scale randomized clinical trials for the evaluation of sirolimus in refractory ITP.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of bisphosphonate combined with chemotherapy on bone mineral density (BMD) of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and analyse its value of BMD detection in clinic of these patients. 53 MM cases were enrolled in this study, including 33 newly diagnosed, 10 refractory/relapsed and 10 stable cases. They were divided randomly into two groups, 33 MM cases were treated with bisphosphonates combined with chemotherapy and 20 MM cases were treated with chemotherapy alone. The chemotherapy schedules for all patients were same. BMD was tested using the dual energy X-ray absorptiometry at 2 time points, i.e. pretreatment (basal level) and 12 months after treatment with chemotherapy and bisphosphonates. Comparisons was performed with t tests using SPSS 11.0 software. The results indicated that there was minor difference between 2 groups for BMD scores of whole body and lumbar vertebra (L1-L4), but no difference for scores of the near-end of left femur. After treatment for 12 months, all BMD scores (whole body, lumbar vertebra and the near-end of left femur) increased significantly in the bisphosphonate combined with chemotherapy group (P < 0.05). In contrast, only minor changes were seen in chemotherapy alone group. It is concluded that the bisphosphonate combined with chemotherapy has displayed promotive effect on BMD of MM patients, the detection of BMD is sensitive and special method for monitoring therapeutic effect of bisphosphonate in MM patients, thus has useful value in clinic of these patients.",

        "abstract": "We developed phase-switch microfluidic devices for molecular profiling of a large number of single cells. Whole genome microarrays and RNA-sequencing are commonly used to determine the expression levels of genes in cell lysates (a physical mix of millions of cells) for inferring gene functions. However, cellular heterogeneity becomes an inherent noise in the measurement of gene expression. The unique molecular characteristics of individual cells, as well as the temporal and quantitative information of gene expression in cells, are lost when averaged among all cells in cell lysates. Our single-cell technology overcomes this limitation and enables us to obtain a large number of single-cell transcriptomes from a population of cells. A collection of single-cell molecular profiles allows us to study carcinogenesis from an evolutionary perspective by treating cancer as a diverse population of cells with abnormal molecular characteristics. Because a cancer cell population contains cells at various stages of development toward drug resistance, clustering similar single-cell molecular profiles could reveal how drug-resistant sub-clones evolve during cancer treatment. Here, we discuss how single-cell transcriptome analysis technology could enable the study of carcinogenesis from an evolutionary perspective and the development of drug-resistance in leukemia. The single-cell transcriptome analysis reported here could have a direct and significant impact on current cancer treatments and future personalized cancer therapies.",

        "abstract": "In order to cope with the increasing complexity of wireless networks, dynamic spectrum access, and varying application needs, fast and flexible reconfiguration of protocol stack is desired. Since Medium Access Control (MAC) layer plays a pivotal role in providing efficient spectrum sharing and utilization, rapid on-the-fly reconfigurability of MAC protocols is highly important. We have designed and implemented TRUMP: a Toolchain for RUntiMe Protocol realization. Based on the component-oriented design approach, TRUMP allows runtime realization, reconfiguration, and optimization of MAC layer according to the varying application requirements, spectral environmental, and network conditions. TRUMP, with a platform-independent MAC meta-language, also enables rapid MAC prototyping. In this article, we carry out a detailed performance evaluation of MAC schemes realized through TRUMP on WARP SDR platform. Our results indicate that TRUMP allows reconfiguration of MAC schemes in the order of a few microseconds, thus meeting the strict timeliness requirements of MAC processing. We also present application examples to highlight capabilities of TRUMP.",

Compared to BuCy regimen, reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) with FIBA was associated with a lower incidence of severe acute GVHD, lower NRM and a similar relapse rate. There was no significant difference in the 3 year overall survival (OS), but this is possibly due to the limited number of patients. The FIBA regimen is promising to replace BuCy regimen because of better security and similar relapse rate.",

        "abstract": "Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can support multiple myeloma (MM) disease progression and resistance to chemotherapy. The proliferation of MM cells may be suppressed by modifying the hematopoietic microenvironment (HME). We have previously isolated human umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells (hUCBDSCs) and observed that hUCBDSCs suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in KM3 cells. To examine the mechanism by which hUCBDSCs drive the inhibition of MM, KM3 cells were co-cultured with hUCBDSCs.Interleukin (IL)-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) expression levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression levels of membrane IL-6 receptor (mIL-6R), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), and Bcl-XL as well as the location of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) were assessed by laser confocal microscopy. The expression profiles of mIL-6R and ICAM-1 were also more precisely examined by flow cytometry, and Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and inhibitor kappa B expression levels were analyzed by western blot. The mRNA expression levels of IL-6R, ICAM-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. NF-κB DNA-binding activity was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay.The protein expression levels of both sIL-6R and mIL-6R were reduced in culture conditions when KM3 cells were co-cultured with hUCBDSCs; moreover, the mRNA expression levels of IL-6R were also reduced. Nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit was inhibited in KM3 cells by co-culture with hUCBDSCs. Moreover, hUCBDSCs inhibited NF-κB DNA-binding activity, thereby resulting in the downregulation of NF-κB-regulated proteins.hUCBDSCs can suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis in KM3 cells by both downregulating IL-6R expression and inhibiting NF-κB activity.",

All patients had received preoperative and 6-, 12-, and 24-month postoperative MRI scans of the lumbar spine with acquisition of both routine and diffusion-weighted images (DWI). The upper-segment discs of the fusion were subjected to Pfirrmann grading, and the lumbar intervertebral discs in the DWI sagittal plane were manually drawn; the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value was measured.ADC values in the ISOBAR TTL dynamic fixation group measured at the 6-, 12-, and 24-month postoperative MRI studies were increased compared to the preoperative ADC values. The ADC values in the ISOBAR TTL dynamic fixation group at 24 months postoperatively were significantly different from the preoperative values (P < 0.05). At 24 months, the postoperative ADC values were significantly different between the rigid fixation group and the ISOBAR TTL dynamic fixation group (P < 0.05).MRI imaging findings indicated that the posterior approach lumbar ISOBAR TTL internal fixation system can prevent or delay the degeneration of intervertebral discs.",

Such networks are more vulnerable to security attacks than conventional wired networks, and hence cryptographic schemes are usually used to ensure security for them. It is worth noting that the nodes in MANETs are with low computational power and communicate over relatively bandwidth constrained wireless links, and thus the deployed cryptographic schemes should usually be highly efficient in term of both computational cost and communication overhead. To ensure the data confidentiality for MANETs, in this paper, we present a new hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) scheme, which enjoys the advantages of low computational cost and light communication overhead. We further propose a new hierarchical identity-based key encapsulation mechanism (HIBKEM) based on our HIBE scheme. The proposed HIBKEM scheme is fully secure against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack, and has a tight security reduction in the standard model.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of dietary energy and protein levels on energy metabolism of muscle tissue in Wujin pigs.One hundred and eight Wujin pigs were randomly allotted into six groups fed diet containing different energy or protein levels.There were eighteen pigs in each group with three replicates which contained six pigs for each replicate.The dietary energy and protein levels were high energy(HE,14.22 MJ/kg),medium energy(ME,12.89 MJ/kg) and low energy(LE,11.74 MJ/kg),high protein(HP,18%,16% and 14%),medium protein(MP,16%,14% and 12%),low protein(LP,14%,12% and 10%) respectively.At the body weight of 30,60 and 100 kg,Wujin pigs were slaughtered and blood,liver and muscular tissues were taken for analyzing contents of blood sugar,hepatic glycogen,muscle glycogen,lactic acid,and activity of lactate dehydrogenase,Na+K+-ATPase and Ca2+Mg2+-ATPase.The results showed that contents of blood sugar,hepatic glycogen,muscle glycogen and lactic acid and the activity of Na+K+-ATPase,Ca2+Mg2+-ATPase and lactate dehydrogenase increased as Wujin pigs fed dietary of energy or protein level increased.The higher dietary energy or protein level could increase the contents of blood sugar,hepatic glycogen,muscle glycogen and lactic acid and the activity of Na+K+-ATPase,Ca2+Mg2+-ATPas,and lactate dehydrogenase at 60kg body weight(P<0.05).At the body weight of 100 kg,the higher dietary energy or protein level could increase contents of blood sugar,hepatic glycogen and muscle glycogen and the activity of Na+K+-ATPase and Ca2+Mg2+-ATPase.The results indicated that higher energy(HE,14.22 MJ/kg)or protein(HP,18%)level of dietary could promote synthesis of hepatic glycogen and muscle glycogen,increase the action of glycolytic pathway,and therefore advanced the energy metabolism of muscle tissue in Wujin pigs.",

        "abstract": "The plasticized starch/poly(vinyl alcohol)(PVA) film was prepared by casting method using magnesium nitrate hexahydrate [Mg(NO3)2·6H2O] as the plasticizer.The micro morphologies of pure starch/PVA and Mg(NO3)2·6H2O plasticized starch/PVA film were observed by scanning electron microscope(SEM).The interaction between Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and starch/PVA molecule was investigated by Fourier transform infrared(FTIR).The crystallinity and thermal properties were measured by X-ray diffraction measurement(XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis(TGA).The mechanical properties were measured by tensile testing and dynamic mechanical analysis(DMA).It was found that Mg(NO3)2·6H2O could form some interaction with starch and PVA molecules.The addition of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O could improve the miscibility of starch and PVA.The XRD results showed that Mg(NO3)2·6H2O could destroy the crystals of starch and PVA.The TGA results showed that the thermal stability of starch/PVA decreased with the addition of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O.Tensile testing showed that Mg(NO3)2·6H2O was highly effective in modifying the mechanical properties of starch/PVA film,making the elongation at break of starch/PVA film largely increased from 8% of pure starch/PVA film to 514% with 60%Mg(NO3)2·6H2O.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Chinese Southwestern Tianshan high- to ultra-high pressure low temperature (HP–UHP/LT) metamorphic belt exhibits well-preserved mafic layers, tectonic blocks/slices and boudins of different sizes and lithology embedded within dominant meta-volcanosedimentary rocks. Despite a wealth of previous studies on UHP relicts, P–T path estimates and age constraints for metamorphism, controversies still exist on P–T–t assessments and regional exhumation patterns (i.e., tectonic melange versus internally coherent “sub-belt” model). This study focuses on a group of coesite-bearing eclogite samples from a thick (~ 5 m) layered metabasalt outcrop in order to unravel its detailed tectono-metamorphic evolution through space and time (both prograde, peak and exhumation). Using SIMS zircon U–Pb and oxygen isotope analyses, TIMS Sm–Nd multi-point isochron dating, in situ laser-ICP-MS trace-element analyses, classical thermobarometry and thermodynamic modeling, we link the multistage zircon growth to garnet growth and reconstruct a detailed P–T–time-isotopic evolution history for this UHP tectonic slice: from UHP peak burial ~ 2.95 ± 0.2 GPa, 510 ± 20 °C around 318.0 ± 2.3 Ma to HP peak metamorphism ~ 2.45 ± 0.2 GPa, 540 ± 20 °C at 316.8 ± 0.8 Ma, then, with eclogite-facies deformation ~ 2.0 ± 0.15 GPa, 525 ± 25 °C at 312 ± 2.5 Ma, exhumed to near surface within ca. 303 to ca. 280 Ma. Our P–T-time-isotopic results combined with the compilation of regional radiometric data and P–T estimates notably point to the existence of a short-lived period of rock detachment and exhumation (",

        "abstract": "Gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) among bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) most frequently occurs through a channel composed of connexin43 (Cx43). Dysregulation of connexin expression is believed to have a role in carcinogenesis. In earlier work, we found that in acute leukemia BMSCs, expression of Cx43 and functioning GJIC declined. However, there has been no evaluation of whether GJIC in BMSCs in complete remission (CR) post-chemotherapy is different from GJIC pre-chemotherapy. We studied Cx43 expression and tested GJIC function in human bone marrow cultures under different physiological and pathological conditions. To assay Cx43 expression we used immunocytochemistry, laser scan confocal microscopy (LSCM), flow cytometry and RT-PCR. The results showed that the expression level of Cx43 and its mRNA in acute leukemia BMSCs post-chemotherapy was significantly higher and similar to normal levels than in primary acute leukemia BMSCs (p<0.01). Functional tests in cultures using dye transfer and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assays showed that the function of GJIC in acute leukemia BMSCs was significantly improved following effective chemotherapy. Our findings suggest Cx43 and GJIC might be involved in the courses of occurrence, development and termination of acute leukemia, and effective chemotherapy could improve Cx43 expression and GJIC function that were dysfunctional prior to treatment.",

        "abstract": "p57kip2 is considered as a candidate tumor suppressor gene involvement in cell cycle control. In this study, we explored the expression of p57kip2 in various myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subsets by real-time quantitative PCR, as well as the relationship between p57kip2 and CXC receptor 4 (CXCR4). We also searched the role of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXCR4 signal in p57kip2 expression in vitro. The expression of p57kip2 decreased in MDS cases (low grade MDS, P<0.001, n = 46; high grade MDS, P<0.001, n = 21), compared with that in control group. Patients with poor karyotype (according to IPSS) had lower p57kip2 than that in the normal group (P<0.05). p57kip2 expression increased after treatment with decitabine in the cases that had achieved response (P = 0.009, n = 7). Additionally, a positive correlation between p57kip2 and CXCR4 was investigated (r = 0.652, P<0.001, n = 67). p57kip2 expression in bone marrow mononuclear cells of normal controls increased significantly when co-cultured with SDF-1 in vitro, which could be blocked by AMD3100, whereas SDF-1 only induced a mild increase in p57kip2 in MDS. In conclusion, low expression of p57kip2 is common in MDS, which may play an important role in MDS pathogenesis. Reduced response to SDF-1 contributed to low expression of p57kip2 in MDS cases.",

        "abstract": "We introduce basic principles and implementation of Hilbert-Huang Transform method and analyze applicability and stability of this method in signal simulation processing.Studying the impact of step,jump and random noise on HHT analysis of analog signal,the results show that the method has high time-frequency resolution,reflect to the typical abnormal in the precursor data such as steps or jumps significantly,and has good stability,and is able to separate the signal which is higher than the 2 times standard deviation of the noise effectively.Finally,we verify the applicability of the method in the analysis of precursor data by using two cases and find that the HHT method can identify the tidal from the real observational data effectively,and have some reference meaning for disturbing rejection and extracting exception.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To compare the similarities and differences of structure, ultrastructure and immunoreactivity between amnion (AM) and conjunctiva. Methods: Fresh AM, glycerin cryopreserved AM and normal conjunctiva were studied by HE staining under the transmission electron microscope (TEM). Conjunctiva tissue from six eyes was studied by the whole mount. 1% alcian blue was used to observe the goblet cells, and Weigert and Van Gieson fluid were used for the staining of collagenous fiber and elastic fiber. Human AM and conjunctiva slices embedded in paraffin were double stained for Collagen IV (C IV) and laminin (LN). Results: Under light microscope, AM consisted of three layers including the inner layer with a single layer of columnar cells fixing firmly to an underlying layer of basement membrane, the loose outer layer without vascular and a multilayer conjunctiva epithelium. Lots of microvilli could be seen on the apical surface of AM cells, and at the base, cell pedicels extended into the basement membrane in podocyte fashion. Cap junction and desmosome between adjacent cells, abundant collagen could been seen under the basement membrane under TEM. In whole mount, the numbers of goblet cells in lower-nasal quadrant was the highest among four quadrants. There were abundant collagen and elastic fiber in the Tenon's fasia, and in the basement membrane of AM and conjunctiva, consecutive granule palm staining was evident. The staining of AM was obviously deeper than that of conjunctiva. Conclusion: Human AM and conjunctiva have the same ultrastructure of the basement membrane. The basement membrane of AM and conjunctiva shares the same component of LN and CIV. AM might be useful as a replacement for the conjunctival basement membrane.",

This study contributes to the literature by examining how interaction effect of EI and instrumentality (INS) depends on the task environment variable, i.e., task visibility (TV). The results show that TV×EI×INS had a significant interaction in the prediction of employee's knowledge sharing behaviours in the organization. Specially, in the work environment of high task visibility, the positive relationship between INS and KS is stronger when the employee's EI is higher. In the environment of low task visibility, INS is unrelated to KS regardless of the level of individuals' EI. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in the final section.",

The clinical data, surgical management and follow-up records were analyzed.The total successful rate of the surgery was 83.0%, lower than that of general RRD. In the eyes with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) A-B, the rate was 89.6%, in the eyes with C(1)-C(3) PVR, the rate was 84.1%, in D(1)-D(3), 69.0%. In eyes with severe PVR the successful rate of vitrectomy was higher than that of scleral buckling alone. Administration of steroids before surgery resulted in high successful rate, but the length of time of the steroid treatment had no effect on the successful rate. In the eyes using scleral buckling alone, the drainage or without the drainage of subretinal fluid had no effect on the successful rate.RRD associated with ChD has worse prognosis than general RRD. The administration of steroids before surgery is necessary, and the timing of surgery is also important. In eyes with light PVR and ChD, scleral buckling without drainage of subretinal fluid is the first choice, but in eyes with severe PVR and ChD, vitrectomy is a better choice.",

        "abstract": "A novel aptasensor for ultrasensitive and rapid detection of ochratoxin A (OTA) was developed using a metal–organic framework (MOF) as the signal unit. In this work, a MOF was utilized as the signal probe. The signal probe differs from traditional probes; the signal of the cadmium ions (Cd2+) from the MOF can be directly detected without acid dissolution and preconcentration, greatly simplifying the detection steps and reducing the detection time. Moreover, the MOF contains large amounts of Cd2+ ions, which could provide high electrochemical signals. Our report is the first time using an MOF as the electrochemical signal probe for an aptasensor application. A gold nanoparticle (Au NP)-doped molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanocomposite was employed as an immobilized matrix for the sensor because of its high electronic conductivity. Under the optimized experimental conditions, an ultrasensitive aptasensor for the detection of OTA exhibited a wide linear range of 0.05–100 ng mL−1 with a low detection limit (LOD) of 10 pg mL−1 OTA (at 3σ). With these merits, this stable, simple, low-cost, sensitive and selective electrochemical aptasensor shows promise for applications in environmental monitoring.",

In the force curves of PAA, the monotonically rising forces with the elongation of the polymer chain are observed.

The target gene vcam-1 was cloned into the shuttle plasmid with the report gene GFP. The recombinant shuttle plasmid was transformed into BJ5183 bacteria to recombine with backbone vector pAdeasy-l, and the recombinant adenoviral vector ad-vcam-1-gfp was confirmed after transfection with CBDSCs. The results indicated that two fragments of about 9 kb and 2 kb were obtained after digestion of recombinant plasmid pAdTrack-vcam-1 with NotIand XhoI, and single fragment of 600 bp was obtained after amplification with PCR; two fragments of about 31 kb and 4 kb were obtained after digestion of recombinant plasmid pad-vcam-1-gfp with PacI, which suggested a successful homologous recombination. The expression of vcam-1 gene in ad-vcam-1-gfp transfected CBDSCs could be detected by immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR and fluorescent microscopy. It is concluded that the recombinant adenoviral vector ad-vcam-1-gfp has been constructed successfully, and the expression of vcam-1 is up-regulated in CBDSCs transfected by gene ad-vcam-1-gfp.",

To control the effects of anatomical variation, the diffusion images of all participants were registered to standard anatomical space. Voxel-by-voxel comparisons showed significant regional reductions in white matter regions of fractional anisotropy (FA) in the participants with aMCI as compared with the controls.Significantly decreased FA value measurements (P < 0.001) were observed in the right frontal white matter in participants with aMCI. Moreover, there was a statistically significant difference between the patients with aMCI and controls in considering the small regions of bilateral superior frontal gyrus white matter (P < 0.001).White matter damage of frontal lobe may play an important role in histopathologic changes associated with amnestic mild cognitive impairment.",

        "abstract": "This study was aimed to investigate the effects of peripheral blood Th17 cells and their secreting IL-17, IL-21 in the occurrence and development of multiple myeloma (MM). A total of 55 patients with MM were divided into non-remission group (group A , n = 30), remission group (group B, n = 25); healthy volunteers were used as control group (group C , n = 30). The concentration of IL-17, IL-21 and IL-6 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC) culture supernatant were determined with ELISA. The ratio of Th7 cells in PBMNC was determined by flow cytometry. The results showed that IL-17, IL-21 levels and ratio of Th17 cells in group A were much higher than those in group B and C (P < 0.05), IL-17, IL-21 and the ratio of Th17 cells between group B and group C were not significantly different (P > 0.05); IL-17 level in non-remission MM group positively correlated with IL-6 level (r = 0.782, P < 0.05), IL-21 level in non-remission MM group positively correlated with IL-6 level (r = 0.778, P < 0.05). It is concluded that Th17 cells as a initiating factor may be involved in the immune pathogenesis of MM patients, promoting the progress of the disease.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel method is proposed for designing two-channel biorthogonal perfect reconstruction filter banks with exact linear phase using noncausal IIR filters. Since the structurally perfect reconstruction implementation is adopted, the proposed filter banks are guaranteed to be a perfect reconstruction even when all filter coeƒcients are quantized. From the view point of wavelets, design of biorthogonal IIR linear phase filter banks with an additional flatness constraint is considered. The proposed design method is based on the formulation of a generalized eigenvalue problem by using Remez exchange algorithm. Hence, the filter coeƒcients can be obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem to compute the positive minimum eigenvalue, and the optimal solution in the Chebyshev sense is easily obtained through a few iterations. The proposed procedure is computationally eƒcient, and the flatness constraint can be arbitrarily specified. Some design examples are presented to demonstrate the e⁄ectiveness of the proposed method.

        "abstract": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine that is multifunctional, with multifaceted effects. IL-6 signaling plays a vital role in the control of the differentiation and activation of T lymphocytes by inducing different pathways. In particular, IL-6 controls the balance between Th17 cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells. An imbalance between Treg and Th17 cells is thought to play a pathological role in various immune-mediated diseases. Deregulated IL-6 production and signaling are associated with immune tolerance. Therefore, methods of inhibiting IL-6 production, receptors, and signaling pathways are strategies that are currently being widely pursued to develop novel therapies that induce immune tolerance. This survey aims to provide an updated account of why IL-6 inhibitors are becoming a vital class of drugs that are potentially useful for inducing immune tolerance as a treatment for autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection. In addition, we discuss the effect of targeting IL-6 in recent experimental and clinical studies on autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Solvation of acid, base, and salt is ubiquitously important to all subject areas in chemistry, health care and life science. However, fine resolution of the solvation dynamics, solute-solvent molecular interactions, and solute capability of transforming the hydrogen bond (O:H O, or HB) and surface stress remain great challenge. Incorporating the notion of O:H O bond cooperativity with a strategy of differential phonon spectroscopy (DPS) has enabled resolution on the fraction and stiffness of the solvent HB from the mode of water to the hydration shells upon NaOH, NaI and HI solvation. Results show that Na +  and I +  ionic polarization shortens the H O bond and stiffens its phonon from 3200 to 3500 cm − 1  in the hydration shells. The H +  in the HI solution forms a H ↔ H anti-HB that disrupts the solution network and surface stress. The excessive electron lone pairs of OH –  form the O : ⇔ : O super-HB that compresses the network, sharing the same effect of mechanical compression shifting the H O phonon from above 3100 cm − 1  to its below; the solute H O bond performs the same to the H O dangling bond at surface featured at 3610 cm − 1 . The fraction coefficients or phonon abundance transition, f H  = 0, f HO  ∝ C, and f x  ∝ 1-exp(− C/C 0 ) (x = Na +  and I −  and C the solute concentration) towards saturation, feature the solute capability of HB transformation. Practice not only confirms the essentiality of the H ↔ H anti-HB point fragilization, the O : ⇔ : O super-HB point compression, and the ionic polarization to the performance of the respective HI, NaOH, and NaI solutions, but also demonstrate the power of the DPS that enables fine-resolution of solvation dynamics and solute capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Objective To researchthe value of bone marrow experimental diagnosis system which combination of detecting techniques for bone marrow infiltration of non-hodgkin's lymphoma. Methods Bone marrow smear and biopsy, flow cytometry, fluorescence in situ hybridization technique and karyotype analysis technology was the foundation to establish the bone marrow experimental diagnosis system. System includes experimental process and result evaluation system. The process of test in proper order include:(1) The bone marrow smear, bone marrow section;(2) FCM analysis and chromosome culture analysis;(3) FISH probe detection. Diagnosis evaluation system had many groups including bone marrow smear(BMA) and pathological section(BMB) as qualitative diagnosis index, specific FCM or immunohistochemistry(IHC) for immune phenotype, and FISH probe gene phenotype as a typing basis, CAA results as a diagnostic and prognostic indicators. The detecting technology of experiments was performed on routine. Results The total number of cases was 115 cases. The patients were checked respectively with BMA(115 cases), BMB(115 cases), FCM(74 cases), FISH(85 cases) and CAA(23 cases).NHL-BMI detection rate was 72.17% by BMA, 89.96 % by BMB, 90.54% by FCM, 54.12 % by FISH respectively and 100% by bone marrow experimental diagnosis system. BMB and FCM positive detection rate was obviously higher than that of the BMA and FISH by Single comparison and statistics was significant difference. 75 patients were diagnosed with NHL by lymph node pathology. The conclusion of diagnosis was compared on the three level of qualitation, immune typing and pathological typing by both of bone marrow experimental diagnosis and lymph node pathological diagnosis results. The ratio of coincidence was 98.67%, 91.94%, 72.00%.The comparative analysis indicates above 2 methods also has the disparity on the accurate pathological typing level. Conclusion Each single technology testing bone marrow for diagnosis of NHL-BMI has its clinical value and also has deficiencies and limitations. Bone marrow smear and bone marrow biopsy is the basic method and can make qualitative diagnosis. Further FCM or IHC can make the immune typing, with addition of FISH and CAA can get fine pathology typing diagnosis. The BM experimental diagnosis system including many technology methods can improve the diagnostic accuracy and the positive rate of NHL-BMI.",

        "abstract": "In cognitive radio networks, previous works almost assume that the primary (licensed) traffic is time-slotted. In time-slotted cognitive radio networks, the secondary (unlicensed) users only need to spend a short time to sense the spectrum because the primary users' states (active or not active) are not changed during the whole secondary frame. However, in realistic cases, the primary traffic is non-time-slotted, which means the primary users can become to be active or not active at any time during the whole secondary frame. Obviously, using the traditional half duplex spectrum sensing scheme, it is impossible for the secondary users to detect the state change in their transmission periods. In this paper, we derive the probability of detection and the probability of false alarm for non-time-slotted cognitive radio networks. We propose the continuous-time Markov chain model to analyze the achievable throughput of primary users and secondary users. To achieve the required primary users' throughput, we develop the full duplex spectrum sensing scheme for non-time-slotted cognitive radio networks. Analyses and numerical results show that using our proposed full duplex spectrum sensing scheme, the primary users can achieve their required throughput and the secondary users' achievable throughput can be increased compared with that of using the half duplex spectrum sensing scheme in non-time-slotted cognitive radio networks. © 2011 IEEE.",

The results showed that viability of HL-60 cells gradually decreased along with the increase of IDA dose and prolongation of culture time. Amount of HL-60 cells co-cultured with leukemia bone marrow stramal cells was significantly increased as compared with that of the control (P < 0.05). Bone marrow stromal cells or stromal cell conditioned medium reduced the effect of IDA on HL-60 cells in culture. In conclusion, leukemia bone marrow stromal cells contribute to increasing resistance of HL-60 cells to chemotherapeutic agents, and play some role in developing minimal residual disease.",

The cross-fault data reliability are analyzed base on the stability of reference datum and observation points, thereby facilitating plotting of the representative value curves after removing interference. The spatial and temporal characteristics of fault deformation abnormalities before the 2016 Menyuan  M s6.4 earthquake, as well as the fault-movement characteristics reflected by representative value, are summarized. The results show that many site trends had changed 1–3 years before the Menyuan  M s6.4 earthquake in the Qilian Fault, reflecting certain background abnormalities. The short-term abnormalities centrally had appeared in the 6 months to 1 year period before the earthquake near and in the neighborhood of the source region, demonstrating a significantly increased number of short-term abnormalities. Many sites near and in the neighborhood of the source region had strengthened inverse activities or had changed from positive to inverse activities in the most recent 2–3 years, which reflect stress-field enhancements or adjustment features.",

        "abstract": "The mechanical properties of single poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) molecules under different solvent conditions were investigated using a new atomic force microscope (AFM) based technique - single-molecule force spectroscopy. The single-molecule force spectrum of PVA shows a kink at around 200 pN, deviating from the entropic elasticity of a random coil predicted from the WLC model. Since the single-molecule force spectra of PVAc and PVA in 8 M urea indicate that both behave like ideal entropic springs, the hydrogen bonding of hydroxyl groups in PVA must govern the elastic behaviors of PVA in water. Because of hydrogen bonding, PVA assumes a multiple stranded suprastructure in water. Upon stretching, the suprastructure undergoes a conformational transition to an overstretched state. This conformational change is fully reversible and is thus in thermodynamic equilibrium. This study demonstrates the unique utility of AFM in exploiting of suprastructures and conformational changes of synthetic polymers.",

        "abstract": "Deep geothermal from the hot crystalline basement has remained an unsolved frontier for the geothermal industry for the past 30 years. This poses the challenge for developing a new unconventional geomechanics approach to stimulate such reservoirs. While a number of new unconventional brittle techniques are still available to improve stimulation on short time scales, the astonishing richness of failure modes of longer time scales in hot rocks has so far been overlooked. These failure modes represent a series of microscopic processes: brittle microfracturing prevails at low temperatures and fairly high deviatoric stresses, while upon increasing temperature and decreasing applied stress or longer time scales, the failure modes switch to transgranular and intergranular creep fractures. Accordingly, fluids play an active role and create their own pathways through facilitating shear localization by a process of time-dependent dissolution and precipitation creep, rather than being a passive constituent by simply following brittle fractures that are generated inside a shear zone caused by other localization mechanisms. We lay out a new theoretical approach for the design of new strategies to utilize, enhance and maintain the natural permeability in the deeper and hotter domain of geothermal reservoirs. The advantage of the approach is that, rather than engineering an entirely new EGS reservoir, we acknowledge a suite of creep-assisted geological processes that are driven by the current tectonic stress field. Such processes are particularly supported by higher temperatures potentially allowing in the future to target commercially viable combinations of temperatures and flow rates.",

        "abstract": "Background and object As a heterogeneous tumor, the prognosis information may be different in different region of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), thus, it's essential to obtain the subregions and evaluate the prognosis of GBM using the high-risk subregions. Based on multi-parametric MR imaging, clearing the purpose of this paper is obtaining the high-risk subregions in GBM and evaluating the GBM prognosis using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL).\n\nMethods A total of 104 GBM patients (57 in long-term and 47 in short-term survival group, separated by overall survival of 12 months) were selected from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), who underwent the T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1W-CE), T1-weighted (T1W), T2-weighted (T2W) and FLAIR sequences. In this paper, a region segmentation pattern was presented to characterize the tumor heterogeneity based on machine learning. Combined with four imaging parameters, the GBM region is segmented into multiple subregions by K-means clustering. Extracting the features of co-occurrence matrix, run-length matrix, size zone, and histogram matrix about subregion for building multi-instance bag. A prognostic prediction model was proposed in virtue of the MIL method, using instances to establish a classifier of predicting the high-risk subregions and realizing the prognosis prediction. Finally, the performance of prognosis prediction using instance-based MIL in GBM is presented and the clinical significance is evaluated.\n\nResult Training the classifier using discovery cohorts (71 patients including 200 instances) and testing the validation cohorts (33 patients including 94 instances), with the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 81.82%, 76.92%, and 85.00%, respectively. This is superior to our previous results about prognosis prediction with the whole tumor region.\n\nConclusion The prognosis prediction result of our GBM heterogeneity analysis pattern proving the feasibility of the intratumor segmentation using K-means clustering and the effectiveness of Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) method. It is of benefit to the analysis of GBM high-risk factor, with research value and clinical significance.\n\nThe intratumor segmentation of the tumor region and the identification of high-risk subregions is benefit to prognosis prediction of GBM, which may be also suitable for other heterogenous tumor.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Knowledge about the impacts of fresh and field-aged biochar amendments on greenhouse gas (CH, NO) emissions is limited. A field experiment was initiated in 2012 to study the effects of fresh and field-aged biochar additions on CH and NO emissions and the associated microbial activity during the entire rice-growing season in typical rice-wheat rotation system in Southeast China. CH and NO fluxes were monitored, and the abundance of methanogen (mcrA), methanotrophy (pmoA), ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), nitrite reductase (nirS, nirK), NO reductase (nosZ), and potential soil enzyme activities related to CH and NO were simultaneously measured throughout different rice developmental stages. There were three treatments: control (urea without biochar), fresh BC (urea with fresh biochar added in 2015), and aged BC (urea with 3-year field-aged biochar added in 2012). Results showed that field-aged biochar significantly decreased seasonal CH emissions by 16.8% in relation to the fresh biochar, though no significant differences were detected between biochars and control treatment. The structural equation model indicated that soil pH, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), pmoA, and mcrA were the main factors directly influenced by fresh and aged biochar amendments; aged biochar showed a negative effect while fresh biochar showed positive effects on CH fluxes. Both fresh and field-aged biochar obviously increased AOA and AOB abundances and reduced the (nirS+nirK)/nosZ ratio during the entire rice-growing season, although no significant effects were observed on seasonal NO emissions. Therefore, biochar amendment produced long-term effects on total CH and NO emissions through observed influences of soil pH and functional gene abundance. The figure shows how fresh and field-aged biochar differentially affected CH4 production and oxidation and N2O production and reduction through related functional gene abundances. Blue arrows indicate suppressing while pink arrows indicate promoting effect.",

        "abstract": "Spectrum and power efficiencies are both crucial to design efficient wireless networks. In past two decades, spectrum and power efficiencies of wireless networks are optimized separately. However, to increase the spectrum efficiency while reducing the energy consumption, it is necessary to jointly optimize spectrum and power efficiencies of wireless networks. Supporting the statistical quality of service (QoS) provisionings for real-time traffic is crucial, but imposes new challenges, in the next generation wireless networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework to jointly optimize effective spectrum efficiency (ESE) and effective power efficiency (EPE) under different statistical QoS guarantees constraints to support the real-time traffic over wireless networks. In particular, we derive the relationship between ESE and EPE under statistical QoS provisioning constraint. Based on this relationship, we obtain the mutually beneficial (MB) region and the contention-based (CB) region. In the MB region, we propose a novel strategy to achieve the joint effective spectrum and power efficiencies optimization using the average transmit power control. In the CB region, we propose the wireless-relay-based strategy to jointly optimize the effective capacity and power efficiency. In both MB and CB regions, we develop the dynamic transmit-power control strategy and the MIMO-based strategy to jointly maximize the effective spectrum and power efficiencies. Also conducted is a set of numerical evaluations showing that our proposed strategies can achieve superior joint spectrum and power efficiencies optimization for the diverse statistical QoS provisionings.",

        "abstract": "False data filtering is an important issue in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we consider a new type of false data injection attacks called collaborative false data injection, and propose two schemes to defend such attacks. In collaborative false data injection attacks, multiple compromised nodes collaboratively forge a fake report and inject the report into the network. This type of attacks is hard to defend with existing approaches, because they only verify a fixed number of message authentication codes (MACs) carried in the data report but the adversary can easily obtain enough compromised nodes from different geographical areas of the network to break their security. Our novel solution is to bind the keys of sensor nodes to their geographical locations, and verify the legitimacy of a data report by checking whether the locations of the sensors endorsing the report are logical (e.g., the sensors should be close enough to each other to sense the same event). We propose two filtering schemes: The geographical information based false data filtering scheme (GFFS) which utilizes the absolute positions of sensors in the verification, and the neighbor information based false data filtering scheme (NFFS) which utilizes relative positions of sensors when absolute positions cannot be obtained. We theoretically analyze the filtering probability of the two proposed schemes, and evaluate their performance through extensive simulations. Simulation results show that, when there are totally ten nodes compromised in a 400 nodes network, the detection probability of collaborative false data injection attacks is higher than 97% in GFFS and NFFS, but is less than 7% in traditional false data filtering approaches such as SEF.",

        "abstract": "The device-to-device (D2D) communication is an efficient mobile-data offloading technique to significantly improve the cellular base station (BS) spectrum efficiency in the fifth generation (5G) wireless networks by enabling mobile users to directly receive the multimedia data from a nearby mobile users through D2D communication. On the other hand, D2D multimedia-data offloading imposes the new modeling challenges in characterizing the statistical delay-bounded quality of service (QoS) provisioning over two-hop tandem wireless links when a mobile user receives its requested data from the cellular BS and relays it to the next mobile user which is requesting the same data via D2D communications. Thus, one of the most important challenges of the D2D multimedia-data offloading architecture lies in how to satisfy the statistical delay-bounded QoS requirements over the two-hop wireless links which consists of two tandem single-hop links. To tackle these challenges, we propose the overall two-hop wireless link QoS provisioning schemes based on its two individual single-hop statistical QoS requirements. We derive the overall effective capacity’s expression of the two-hop tandem wireless links as a function of the single-hop’s effective capacities and prove that the overall equivalent effective capacity of the two-hop wireless link is upper bounded by the single-hop effective capacity with the smaller QoS exponent. Moreover, we derive the upper-bound and lower-bound of the equivalent QoS exponent for the overall two-hop wireless links and also show its monotonicity with respect to single-hop QoS exponents. To show the network performance’s improvement after integrating the cellular networks and D2D offloading, we compare the scalability of the BS-based cellular wireless networks with and without D2D offloading. We also evaluate and validate our proposed two-hop wireless link statistical delay bounded QoS provisioning schemes over multimedia D2D offloading architecture through numerical analyses.",

        "abstract": "As multi-standard devices and high speed communication standards are emerging, timeliness requirements and flexibility for both baseband modem and medium access schemes are becoming essential. Software Defined Radios (SDRs), in this context, aim at offering the desired flexibility while satisfying the real-time constraints. An SDR architecture consisting of many-core homogeneous computing elements provides easy protocol implementation, a high level of portability and extension possibilities. It does not require architecture specific program code which is needed by the popular heterogeneous SDR architectures. Therefore, in this paper, we explore how a homogeneous SDR architecture is used for efficient realization and execution of Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols. In particular, we investigate the performance of two broad classes of MAC schemes on the Platform 2012 (P2012) many-core programmable computing fabric. We provide a toolchain which utilizes the characteristics of P2012 for MAC parallelization, runtime scheduling, and execution. Our results indicate that by using the supporting toolchain, reconfigurable MAC implementations are able to exploit the computational power offered by the platform and adhere to the timeliness constraints. Computationally intensive algorithms for MAC layer parameter optimization show an improvement of up to 85% in the convergence time as compared to using a single-core architecture.",

An investigation of the impact of different spectrometer detector angles measured from the laser incident axis on the plasma properties was conducted on the self-built two-phase particle flow experiment bench. Coal particle flow was used as the experimental sample. An analysis of the variation in the emission intensity and relative standard deviation (RSD) was carried out. The atomic spectral lines of C, Si and Al which are representative elements in coal were chosen as the analytical lines. Then the influence of the spectra acquired with different collection angles was discussed. The results demonstrated that the strong and stable intensity signal can be acquired in the collection angle range from 30° to 45°.",

        "abstract": "Visible-light photoinduced electron transfer (Vis-PET) is highly important for optoelectronic devices and photoredox catalysis. Herein, we propose a supramolecular strategy to promote the Vis-PET process by charge transfer (CT) interactions. As a proof of concept, a molecular system containing 1,5-alkoxy-substituted naphthalene and viologen moieties was designed to form a CT complex in water. The HOMO/LUMO energy gap was lowered by CT interaction, which turned on the Vis-PET process to generate viologen radical cations. Moreover, when CT interaction was enhanced by cucurbit[8]uril, the efficiency of the Vis-PET process was further promoted and the required irradiation wavelength could be further red-shifted by 100 nm. The Vis-PET system exhibited an improved activity of photocatalysis, as supported by the fast photoreduction of Cytochrome c. This study represents a facile supramolecular way to fabricate radicals with maintained activity under mild conditions, which holds potential to enrich the scope of visible-light photoredox catalysis by the rational utilization of CT systems.",

ResultsThe ratio of apoptosis index/proliferation index(AI/PI) of JEC cells increased with the concentration of antibacterial proteins.The PI and apoptosis rate of 2.5% antibacterial proteins group and 12.5% antibacterial proteins group significantly increased,and G0/G1 significantly decreased.For A375 cells,there were significant differences in G2/M, S,G0/G1,G2/M,AI/PI and PI between 12.5% antibacterial proteins group and control group(P<0.01). ConclusionThe antibacterial proteins of Musca domestica larvae may inhibite the growth of JEC cells by inducing the cell apoptosis.The inhibition effects on A375 cells may be realized by blocking cell cycles and inducing cell apoptosis.",

        "title": "The effect mechanism of pharmacological vitreolysis with plasmin and hyaluronidase",
        "abstract": "Background: Many ophthalmologists have proved that the intravitreal injection of plasmin can safely induce posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), but if it can generate the complete PVD need further to seek confirmation. Researches showed that the safe dose and toxicity dose of dispase are very near, so its application is limited. Whether hyaluronidase can induce PVD is still in controversy. Objective: This study is to clarity the mechanism of pharmacological vitreolysis with plasmin and hyaluronidase. Methods: Plasmin 4 μmol/L,2 μmol/L, and 1 μmol/L, plasmin 1 μm/L + hyaluronidase 20 μm/L, hyaluronidase alone were intravitreally injected in lateral eye of 4 clean New Zealand white rabbits respectively, and 0. 1 mL BSS was injected as control group. Electron-immunocytochemical technique was used to detect the laminin and fibronectin of interface between vitreous and retina in 7 days after intravitreal injection. Other 14 eyes of 7 clean New Zealand white rabbits were used in this study. Plasmin 1 μm/L + hyaluronidase 20 μm/L was intravitreally injected in the lateral eyes, and only plasmin 1 μm/L was injected in the fellow eyes. Plasmin activity in vitreous was evaluated in 15 and 30 minutes, 1 hour,2,3,6, 12 hours after intravitreal injection. The use of animals followed the Regulations for the Administration of Affair Concerning Experimental Animals by State Science and Technology Commission. Results: The amounts of laminin and fibronectin in the vitreoretinal interface were decreased in 4 μm/L plasmin group,2 μmol/L plasmin group, 1 μmol/L plasmin group, 1 μmol/L plasmin + 20 μmol/L hyaluronidase group compared with control group ( P < 0. 01 ). No significant difference was seen in the density of gold particles of anti-FN between 20 μmol/L hyaluronidase group and control group (P > 0. 05 ). The change of amounts of fibronectin in the vitreoretinal interface was similar to that of laminin. Plasmin activity remained the highest level 1 hour after injection and thereafter gradually decreased and extincted in 12 hours and presented the same trend between plasmin 1 μmol/L + hyaluronidase 20 μmol/L group and only plasmin 1 μmol/L group. Conclusion: The mechanism of pharmacological vitreolysis is to dissolve laminin and fibronectin in the interface between vitreous and retina and therefore induce PVD. Combination of plasmin with hyaluronidase can increase the efficiency of pharmacological vitreolysis. The optimum selection of drug in inducing PVD should consider not only its role of lysis laminin and fibronectin but also the role of liquefying the vitreous.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The distinct submarine volcanic-hosted iron ore deposits in the Awulale Iron Metallogenic Belt are the most important sources for iron in the Chinese Western Tianshan metallogenetic province, although, the exact tectonic setting for their formation remains poorly constrained. A compilation of published and new geochronological and geochemical data suggests a protracted magmatism from ca. 450 to 290 Ma was in close spatial and temporal proximity to the iron deposits. The different magmatic rocks have broadly similar arc-like geochemical signatures such as LREE and LILE enrichments, HREE and HFSE depletions, Nb–Ta–Ti negative anomalies and flat HREE patterns, all of which are attributed to magmatic differentiation and/or partial melting in relatively thin crust due to long-term extension. The contrasting whole-rock Nd isotopic patterns of the igneous rocks and the well-defined peak metamorphism (ca. 320–310 Ma) of the subduction-zone high-pressure rocks indicate that ca. 450–321 Ma magmatic rocks with an increasingly positive e Nd (t) shift were formed during the northward subduction of the South Tianshan Ocean, where slab rollback resulted in an extensional setting in the southern Yili-Central Tianshan Block. In contrast, the synchronicity of the ca. 320–310 Ma subduction-zone peak metamorphism and magmatic flare-up with uniformly positive e Nd (t) values is interpreted as the consequence of slab break-off subsequent to the oceanic subduction and the continental collision. By inference, the late-stage (ca. 309–290 Ma) magmatism was likely constructed in a post-collisional setting. The submarine volcanic-hosted iron mineralization exclusively occurred coeval with the peak metamorphism and intensive magmatism, probably suggesting slab break-off as the exact tectonic setting for iron mineralization. Consequently, the western extension of the Awulale Iron Metallogenic Belt occurring roughly parallel to the South Tianshan Orogen may have significant potential for prospecting the submarine volcanic-hosted iron ore deposits.",

        "abstract": "Aim To explore immunological properties of human umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells (hUCBDSC) and their efect on xenogeneic immune cells in vitro. Methods Immunological phenotype of freshly isolated and cryopreserved hUCBDSCs was evaluated by flow cytometry. Xenogeneic splenic T-cells were stimulated by phytohemaglutinin A (PHA) or dendritic cells in the absence or presence of hUCBDSCs. T-cell proliferation was measured by cell counting kit-8 after 7-day incubation. The proportion of apoptotic cells and CD4 +CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs) was determined in T-cells activated by PHA in the absence or presence of hUCBDSCs by flow cytometry. Phenotype of dendritic cells, cultured alone or with hUCBDSCs, was analyzed by flow cytometry. Results Levels of immune molecule expression on freshly isolated hUCBDSCs were as follows: human leukocyte antigen-I (HLA-I) (84.1 ± 2.9%), HLA-II (1.6 ± 0.3%), CD80 (0.8 ± 0.1%), CD86 (0.8 ± 0.1%), CD40 (0.6 ± 0.1%), and CD40L (0.5 ± 0.1%), which was not influenced by cryopreservation. T-cell proliferation in the presence of hUCBDSCs was significantly lower than that of positive control. The coculture led to a 10-fold increase (from 1.2 ± 0.3% to 12.1 ± 1.4%, P < 0.001) in the proportion of CD4+CD25 +Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and a reversion of mature dendritic cells, as indicated by the down-regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II molecule (49.3% vs 25.9%, P = 0.001), CD80 (47.2% vs 23.3%, P = 0.001), and CD86 (40.6% vs 25.1%, P = 0.002). When subjected to annexin V binding and propidium iodide uptake assay, the hUCBDSCs did not show the ability to induce apoptosis of xenogeneic T-cells. Conclusion These results demonstrate low immunogenicity and immunomodulation efect of the hUCBDSCs. Reversion of mature dendritic cells and increase in Treg proportion, but not cell apoptosis, can possibly contribute to the suppression of xenogeneic T-cell proliferation by the hUCBDSCs.",

        "abstract": "Sparganosis caused by invasion of the plerocercoid larvae (spargana) of Spirometra erinaceieuropaei have increased in recent years in China. However, the population genetic structure regarding this parasite is still unclear. In this study, we used the sequences of two mitochondrial genes cytochrome b (cytb) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) to analyze genetic variation and phylogeographic structure of the S. erinaceieuropaei populations.A total of 88 S. erinaceieuropaei isolates were collected from naturally infected frogs in 14 geographical locations of China. The complete cytb and cox1 genes of each sample was amplified and sequenced. Total 61 haplotypes were found in these 88 concatenated sequences. Each sampled population and the total population have high haplotype diversity (Hd), accompanied by very low nucleotide diversity (Pi). Phylogenetic analyses of haplotypes revealed two distinct clades (HeN+HuN+GZ-AS clade and GX+HN+GZ-GY clade) corresponding two sub-networks yielded by the median-joining network. Pairwise FST values supported great genetic differentiation between S. erinaceieuropaei populations. Both negative Fu's FS value of neutrality tests and unimodal curve of mismatch distribution analyses supported demographic population expansion in the HeN+HuN+GZ-AS clade. The BEAST analysis showed that the divergence time between the two clades took place in the early Pleistocene (1.16 Myr), and by Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) an expansion occurred after about 0.3 Myr ago.S. erinaceieuropaei from central and southern China has significant phylogeographic structure, and climatic oscillations during glacial periods in the Quaternary may affect the demography and diversification of this species.",

By integrating information theory with the principle of effective capacity, our proposed scheme aims at maximizing the system throughput subject to a given delay-QoS constraint. Over the block fading channel, we derive the optimal power allocation scheme to maximize the effective capacity. The analyses and numerical results show that our optimal power allocation scheme converges to the despicking water-filling scheme when the QoS constraint becomes very loose. On the other hand, our optimal power allocation scheme reduces to the dispicking channel inversion scheme when the QoS constraint gets very stringent. Two non-optimal power allocation schemes are described for comparison purposes. We also propose and evaluate the independent optimization for the multicarrier system.",

Then, the kinetics of supramolecular polymerization of the two monomers was easily controlled through the modulation of pH.

The distribution scope of fault deformation anomaly before the earthquake is wide, the anomaly shape is complicated and the pattern anomalous zone of fault deformation (strain) information index is obvious. The shape and amplitude of fault deformation anomaly in different regions differ significantly, which is closely related to the tectonic location of anomaly. The fault deformation anomaly of α,β and γ phases along the western segment of Haiyuan fault zone shows the process from the quasi-linearity to non-linearity of fault movement in the near-source region, matches the high-value anomalous area of fault deformation (strain) information index, and reflects the high strain accumulation in the seismogenic region. However, the anomaly of abrupt jump and cusp with a large amplitude occurred in the areas far from the earthquake, such as Liupanshan fault zone which is the tectonic convergent section does not reflect the strain accumulation of its location, maybe it is a sign that the regional tectonic stress field is strengthened in the seismogenic process. Based on the above-mentioned facts and combined with the preliminary summary of experiences and lessons in the medium and short-term prediction of Jingtai Ms5. 9 earthquake, we study and explore the application of fault deformation anomaly to earthquake judgement.",

        "abstract": "The cognitive access techniques were originally developed for radio communication networks, and are recently extended to the research area for underwater acoustic networks. One of the important problems for developing the underwater cognitive acoustic networks lies in the optimal spectrum sensing strategy to maximize the exploitation of spectrum holes, which are the idle channels due to the absence of the primary acoustic user. To overcome this challenge, we propose the media access control (MAC)-layer spectrum sensing scheme to find the spectrum hole with minimum channel switching delay while obtaining the maximum signal-to-noise ratio. Using our proposed MAC-layer spectrum sensing scheme, the secondary underwater acoustic users efficiently reduce the channel switching delay.",

Herein, we demonstrated the use of supramolecular radical dimer, fabricated by N,N'-dimethylated dipyridinium thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole radical cation (MPT •+ ) and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]), to achieve strong absorption at NIR-II biowindow. The supramolecular radical dimer (2MPT •+ -CB[8]) showed highly efficient photothermal conversion and improved stability, thus contributing to the strong inhibition on HegG2 cancer cell under 1064 nm irradiation even penetrating through chicken breast tissue. This work provides a novel approach to construct NIR-II chromophore by tailor-made assembly of organic radicals. It is anticipated that this study provides a new strategy to achieve NIR-II photothermal therapy and holds promises in luminescence material, optoelectronic material and biosensing as well.",

        "abstract": "In order to investigate the effect of stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXCR4 on the proliferation of megakaryocytic line-HEL cells co-cultured with human umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells (hUCBSCs) and to further elucidate the mechanism of SDF-1/CXCR4-mediated functions, the HEL cells were co-cultured with hUCBSCs or human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs), the suspended HEL was used as control. The concentrations of SDF-1 in supernatant of hUCBSCs and hBMSCs were detected by ELISA assay. The expression of CXCR4 membrane-bound protein of HEL cells was detected by laser confocal scanning microscopy and flow cytometry, and the expression of CXCR4 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. The result showed that the concentrations of SDF-1 in different groups were the same at the early stage of culturing. But at 6 days after seeding, the concentrations of SDF-1 increased significantly in the hUCBSCs group, even though the passage was done. By means of laser confocal microscopy, the expression of CXCR4 protein and also red dots of fluorescence could be detected in cytoplasm of HEL cells co-cultured with hUCBSCs. However, there was no significant differences of the CXCR4 mRNA level between different groups (p > 0.05). It is concluded that hUCBSCs may play important roles in secreting high level of SDF-1 and regulating megakaryocyte expression of CXCR4.",

MAC protocols are generally viewed as sequential extended state-machines and therefore MAC parallelization has not yet been widely considered. In this paper, we show that MAC execution efficiency can be substantially increased by exploiting parallelism and by providing the necessary hardware-software support. In particular, we enable dual-processor interrupt-driven hardware architecture and support a customized real-time operating system kernel on the widely used WARP SDR platform. Moreover, we integrate it with our framework for composing MAC protocols based on their elementary functionalities. We describe the architectural details of the system and discuss strategies for efficient scheduling of different MAC processes. We evaluate our system in realistic application test-cases. Our empirical results show that by exploiting parallelism, our system achieves significant improvements in MAC execution speed compared to the contemporary sequential implementation approach.",

It is also a tectonic zone where the wide active margin in the southern Siberia finally amalgamated with the passive margin of the northern Tarim. On the basis of recent research advances, we subdivide the Western Tianshan into following tectonic units: the North Tianshan Arc Accretionary Wedge, the Northern Active Continental Margin of the Yili block, the Yili block, the Southern Active Continental Margin of the Yili block, the Central Tianshan Composite Arc Terrane, the Western Tianshan (high-pressure) Accretionary Wedge and the Northern margin of the Tarim block. The new chronological data of ophiolites, high-pressure metamorphic rocks and granitoids have also been summed up in order to discuss the accretionary orogenic process of the western Tianshan. This orogenic process is related to the evolution of three paleo-oceanic basins, namely, the early Paleozoic 'Terskey Ocean', the latest early Paleozoic-late Paleozoic 'South Tianshan Ocean' and the late Paleozoic 'North Tianshan Ocean'. The accretionary orogenesis terminated at the end Early Carboniferous. Subsequendy, the Western Tianshan and the whole Central Asia may have evolved into a post-collisional stage in Permian. The data obtained up to now has demonstrated that the Western Tianshan Oro-gen is a late Paleozoic accretionary orogenic belt, instead of a Triassic collisional one.",

        "abstract": "Dysfunction of the hematopoietic microenvironment is the main obstacle encountered during hematopoiesis reconstruction in patients with acute hematopoietic radiation syndrome. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) play a crucial supporting role in hematopoiesis by maintaining the balance between adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. In this study, we found that irradiation decreased the colony-forming efficiency of BM-MSCs and impaired the balance between adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. Following irradiation, BM-MCSs became strongly predisposed to adipogenesis, as evidenced by increased oil red O staining and elevated mRNA and protein levels of the adipogenic markers and transcription factors PPARγ and AP2. Overexpression of the essential adipogenesis regulator Crif1 in BM-MSCs promoted adipogenesis after irradiation exposure by upregulating adipogenesis-related genes, including C/EBPβ, PPARγ, and AP2. We found that Crif1 promoted the phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) through direct interaction with protein kinase A (PKA)-α. Phosphorylation of CREB was inhibited in Crif1-knockdown BM-MSCs even in the presence of a PKA agonist (db-cAMP) and could be suppressed in Crif1-overexpressing BM-MSCs by a PKAα inhibitor (H-89). These results suggest that Crif1 is an indispensable regulator of PKAα cat that modulates the PKA/CREB signaling pathway to promote adipogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs after irradiation.

We explored the role of p21 in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).In this study, we analyzed p21 expression and p73 methylation in 88 patients with de novo MDS.We found decreased expression of the p21 gene in higher-risk MDS compared with lower-risk groups or healthy controls (P < .05). Patients with p73 methylation had lower p21 than those in the unmethylated group (P < .001). Moreover, there was a significantly positive correlation between p73 and p21 expression in MDS (r = 0.436, P < .001). In vitro assays further confirm the role of p73 methylation in p21 expression. Compared with patients with normal expression levels of p21, patients with lower p21 expression levels experienced much higher rates of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia and lower overall survival both in univariate as well as multivariate analyses.Our results suggest p21 expression may serve as a new biomarker to predict clinical outcome in patients with MDS.",

        "abstract": "The Spirometra mansoni antigenic polypeptide (SmAP) gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and its characteristics and value as an antigen for the serodiagnosis of sparganosis were investigated. The recombinant SmAP protein (rSmAP) has the molecular weight of 28.7 kDa. On Western blotting analysis, the rSmAP strongly reacted with the sera of mice infected with spargana, but not with normal sera; the anti-rSmAP serum obviously recognized the 28.7-kDa band in the crude antigens and excretory-secretory (ES) antigens of spargana. The immunofluorescence test (IFT) results showed that the positive staining was observed at different stages of spargana from the infected frogs and mice, but not adult worm of S. mansoni. An immunolocalization analysis identified SmAP in the teguments and parenchymal tissues of spargana. ELISA with rSmAP antigen or sparganum ES antigens were evaluated for the serodiagnosis of sparganosis. The results showed that the sensitivity of rSmAP-ELISA and ES-ELISA was 83.3% (25/30) and 100% (30/30), respectively, for the detection of anti-sparganum IgG antibodies in sera of the experimentally infected mice (P > 0.05), the specificities of both ELISA were 100% (67/67). It is suggested that the rSmAP might be a potential candidate antigen for serodiagnosis of sparganosis.",

        "abstract": "On the basis of Part I of this paper (Zhang X, Liu, H-Y, Mai Y-W, Diaox X. On steady-state fibre pull-out Part I: stress field. Composites Science and Technology, 1999;59:2179–89) we present an extended analysis for the single-fibre pull-out process. The solutions of fibre axial stress, fibre displacement, and applied pull-out stress versus fibre displacement are obtained for the whole pull-out process. As distinct from previous work (Gao Y-C, Mai Y-W, Cottrell B. Fracture of fibre-reinforced materials. ZAMP 1988;39:550–72; Hutchinson JW, Jensen HN. Model of fibre debonding and pull-out in brittle composites with friction. Mechanics of Materials 1990;9:139–63; Hsueh C-H. Interfacial debonding and fibre pull-out stresses of fibre-reinforced composites. Materials Science and Engineering 1990;A123:1–11), a local shear strain criterion, in which the critical shear strain depends on the pull-out rate, is adopted as a more realistic interface debonding criterion. Load/displacement curves of the fibre pull-out process, which includes elastic deformation with a fully bonded interface, elastic deformation with a partially debonded interface and elastic deformation plus frictional sliding with a fully debonded interface, are obtained by computer simulations. The effects of fibre pull-out rate, thermal residual stress, friction coefficient and fibre volume fraction are also discussed.",

In order to solve this problem, a novel performance monitoring and fault diagnosis method based on kernel generalized discriminant analysis (kernel GDA, KGDA) was proposed. Through KGDA, the data were mapped from the original space to the high-dimensional feature space. Then the statistic distance between normal data and test data was constructed to detect whether a fault was occurring. If a fault had occurred, similar analysis was used to identify the type of faults. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated by simulation results of vibration signal fault dataset in the rotating machinery, which was scalable to different rotating machinery.",

Fourteen women with upper urinary tract diseases but having normal lower urinary tract function, who had not experienced parturation were included as controls.Functional bladder volume (FBV) of primipara and bipara after delivery and normal desire cytometric capacity (NDCC) were respectively lower than those of control group (437 +/- 193) ml and (338 +/- 120) ml, however FBV and NDCC between primipara and bipara (310 +/- 154), (215 +/- 90) ml vs (243 +/- 141), (225 +/- 115) ml were not significantly different. The static Pure. max and Pure. clos. max of primipara and bipara were respectively higher than those of control group (87 +/- 7) cm H2O (1 cm H2O = 0.098 kPa) and (78 +/- 8) cm H2O (P < 0.05), but there were no significant differences in Pure. max and Pure. closure. max between primipara and bipara (116 +/- 28) cm H2O and (97 +/- 25) cm H2O vs (120 +/- 31) cm H2O and (106 +/- 37) cm H2O. There were significant differences in functional urethral length between primipara (31 +/- 6) mm and bipara (27 +/- 5) mm. Abrams-Griffiths number (AG) and urethral resistance factor (URA) of primipara and bipara also showed no significant differences from control group (11 +/- 3) cm H2O. Each group had one case with leakage on valsalva action, and valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP) was respectively 50 cm H2O and 67 cm H2O.It is suggested that bladders of primipara and bipara shortly after delivery are sensitive and static urethral pressure parameters are increased, but voiding ability is still normal. There are no significant differences in urodynamic parameters between primipara and bipara.",

In order to investigate the role of well placement, this paper presents a semi-analytical model in which fluid circulates in a single, horizontally planar geothermal reservoir with a constant hydraulic aperture via dipole wells in the presence of a 2D areal or regional flow field. By using a new coordinate system based on the velocity potential and the streamline function, analytical solutions in the Laplace space for the temperature field are found, which are then numerically inverted to obtain time-domain results. The effects of some factors such as well separation, areal flow direction, flow rate, and the velocity of the areal flow on heat recovery are investigated. It is found that the dimensionless areal flow velocity, U 0  =  v   0   ωπL/Q , and the angle of the areal flow,  β , play an important role when changing other parameter to maximize the output temperature and the lifetime of the dipole well system. When U 0  ≤ 0.5, the angle for minimizing interflow between wells should be  β  = 0; when 0.5  0  β  = arccos(0.5U 0 ); when U 0  u003e 0.7854, the injection well should be placed downstream from the production well.",

        "abstract": "We have previously reported that human umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells (hUCBDSCs) are able to enhance the expansion of CFU-Meg in vitro, particularly promote the megakaryocytic lineage recovery, and effectively protect the survival of irradiated mice. In this study, we demonstrated that hUCBDSCs secreted SDF-1 to stimulate PECAM-1 expression in HEL cells (MK cell line), and consequently promoted the proliferation and migration of HEL cells. On the other hand, SDF-1 knock down in hUCBDSCs or PECAM-1 knock down in HEL cells diminished or abrogated the above effect. In addition, SDF-1/PECAM-1 probably activated PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK1/2 pathways. This report for the first time defines a SDF-1/PECAM-1 signaling pathway in the proliferation and migration of MKs, which provides supportive evidence for the clinical applications of hUCBDSCs in the treatment of megakaryocytic injury.",

        "title": "An Adaptive Probability Broadcast-Based Data Preservation Protocol in Wireless Sensor Networks",
        "abstract": "In some harsh environment, wireless sensor networks without the sink are often deployed. In the network, the nodes just have limited energy and are easy to fail. In order to prevent the data loss due to the failure of nodes, each node disseminates its data to be stored at a subset of nodes in the network for preservation. However, each node just knows the information of its neighbors, and just has limited storage space. Therefore, it is a challenge to manage the processes of data dissemination and storage effectively. In this paper, an adaptive probability broadcast-based protocol, named APBDP (Adaptive Probability Broadcast-based Data Preservation), is proposed to tackle the challenge. In APBDP, each node disseminates its data to the network by an adaptive probability broadcast mechanism. The mechanism can not only enable all nodes receive the data packet, but also reduce the redundance of data transmission to conserve the energy of nodes. Moreover, each node stores the data received by using LT (Luby Transform) codes, which are the first rateless erasure codes that are very efficient as the amount of data grows. After above processes are finished, a collector (e.g., a motor vehicle) can recover all data by visiting a small subset of nodes. To the best of our knowledge, APBDP is the first scheme that uses adaptive probability broadcast to achieve the efficient data preservation. Theoretical analyses and simulations show that APBDP can achieve higher performance of data preservation and energy efficiency than existing protocols.",

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. AD clinically manifests as gradually progressive cognitive decline with behavioral disorders. Prior to full dementia, AD patients typically experience a transient state, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Amnestic MCI individuals, but not all MCI individuals, frequently convert to AD dementia. To specify whether and how the functional relationships between the MrD and other brain regions change during AD, functional connectivity was assessed using resting-state functional MRI data and associated neuropsychological tests in AD and MCI patients (amnestic-type). Compared with normal controls, a different decreased functional connectivity pattern was observed between the MrD and caudate, the amygdala/parahippocampal region, the inferior frontal gyrus, the superior temporal gyrus, and the cerebellum for AD/MCI patients. Moreover, the functional connectivity between the MrD and the identified regions was significantly correlated with the neuropsychological scores among the MCI and AD subjects. Our results suggest that the MrD functional network is disrupted during AD.",

        "abstract": "Since the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) were designed without taking the energy-saving into account, the unexpected excessive energy consumption of the fourth-generation (4G) and pre-4G wireless networks causes serious carbon dioxide emissions. To achieve green wireless networks, the fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks are expected to significantly increase the network energy efficiency while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) for time-sensitive multimedia wireless traffics. In this paper, we develop the statistical delay-bounded QoS driven green power allocation schemes to maximize the effective power efficiency (EPE), which is defined as the statistical-QoS-guaranteed throughput (effective capacity) per unit power, over single-input single-output (SISO) and multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO)-channels based 5G mobile wireless networks. For the SISO-channel based 5G wireless networks, our developed QoS-driven green power allocation scheme converges to the despicking water-filling scheme (despicking channel inversion scheme) when the QoS constraint becomes very loose (stringent). We further develop and analyze the statistical-QoS-driven green power allocation scheme to maximize the EPE over the multiplexing-MIMO based 5G mobile wireless networks. The obtained numerical results show that our developed statistical QoS-driven green power allocation schemes can optimize the EPE over 5G mobile wireless networks, thus enabling the effective implementation of green 5G wireless networks.",

In this work, carbon films were deposited at different irradiation electron energies and fluxes monitored using a retarding field energy analyzer, while the deposition temperature was measured using an infrared thermometer. We found that the size and concentration of graphene nanocrystallites strongly depend on the irradiation electron energy and the electron flux but not the temperature, which indicates that the electron excitation effect of the covalent bonds dominates the formation process of these nanocrystallites. This finding shed light on the new fabrication method of 2D materials.",

        "abstract": "This study was aimed to investigate the influence of timing using G-CSF after chemotherapy on graft yield of mobilized peripheral blood stem cells for autoPBSCT. 39 patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma (MM) received the same chemotherapy mobilization regimen, including CTX 400 mg/m² d1; VLB 2 mg/m(2) d1; Ara-C 60 mg/m ²× d1-5; VP-16 60 mg/m² × d1-5; and prednisone 40 mg/m² × d1-5. The historical control group (12 cases) received G-CSF subcutaneously (filgrastim) at the first restoration after the initial nadir of the peripheral WBC count. The experimental group (27 cases) received G-CSF during the steady rise of the WBC count (end of fluctuating after initial nadir). G-CSF was given in a single daily subcutaneous dose of 5 µg/kg until the final PBSC apheresis. When the peripheral WBC and mononuclear cell (MNC) counts reached 10 × 10⁹/L and 1.0 × 10⁹/L respectively, leukapheresis was carried out using the COBE Spectra blood cell separator. The results indicated that despite there was comparable treatment with alkylating agents between 2 groups, a significantly increased yield of CD34 positive cells was observed in the experimental group (26.4 × 10⁶/kg), as compared to the historical control group (3.1 × 10⁶/kg) (p = 0.0031). It is concluded that the appropriate timing for the use G-CSF mobilization after chemotherapy is important to increase the CD34(+) cell yield in auto-graft.",

        "abstract": "Despite improvements in transplant immunology and clinical and supportive care, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) remains a clinical challenge and a major cause of morbidity and mortality for patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Many ways have been used to prevent and treat aGVHD, however, long-term survival remains poor. The key to improve aGVHD outcomes may, in fact, rest upon successful initial therapy. The HLA-matched HSCT was limited by the shortage of suitable donors. Unmanipulated haploidentical/mismatched related transplantation with combined granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells and G-CSF-mobilized bone marrow as a stronger aGVHD inhibition and graft-versus-leukemia effect, has been developed as an alternative transplantation strategy for patients with hematologic malignancies for the advantage of immediate donor availability, ability to select the best of many relatives, controlled graft composition and immediate access to donor-derived cellular therapies if required after transplantation. G-CSF is a potent hematopoietic cytokine, which is produced by fibroblasts, monocytes, and endothelial cells. G-CSF regulates production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation, maturation and is also involved in mobilization of granulocytes, stem and progenitor cells, which has an important role in this transplantation. In this article, we review the possible mechanism for this combined G-CSF-mobilized HSCT in the prevention of aGVHD. Monocytes, T cells, Tregs cells, DC, adhesive molecule, NK cell/KIR ligand mismatching and mesenchymal stem cells may be involved in this transplantation.",

        "title": "A model for hydraulic fracture growth across multiple elastic layers",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Typical stress conditions in gas reservoirs consisting of multiple thin coal seams interlayed with shales, tuffs and sandstones, often lead to generation of a planar vertical hydraulic fracture. A pseudo-3D model, in which the growth of the planar hydraulic fracture occurs through multiple horizontal layers with different elastic properties, is developed to account for the effects of modulus contrasts on fracture shapes. In this model, plane strain deformation is assumed for pseudo-3D cells that have uniform cross-sectional pressure distribution, and the horizontal fluid flow is simplified to be one dimensional. The vertical and horizontal fracture growth are controlled in the model by two failure criteria, respectively. Viscous fluid friction effects are included for vertical growth and a correction factor is applied to the horizontal failure criterion to adjust the propagation speeds. The numerical results for different values of the correction factor are presented for a vertically planar fracture propagating in a homogeneous rock subject to stress contrasts. Fitting the pseudo-3D results to fully-3D results provides a means to determine the correlation factor that is found to be a function of material constants and cell length. The correlation factor obtained is then extended to hydraulic fracture propagation in a layered rock mass. There are two options in choosing material constants for the correlation factor and their results are examined. Both choices demonstrate the same varying trends for fracture height and propagation speed. The existence of softer coal seams retards upward fracture growth, with a stepwise injection pressure associated with the discontinuous upward growth.",

        "abstract": "Due to the ability to preserve semantic similarity in Hamming space, supervised hashing has been extensively studied recently. Most existing approaches encourage two dissimilar samples to have maximum Hamming distance. This may lead to an unexpected consequence that two unnecessarily similar samples would have the same code if they are both dissimilar with another sample. Besides, in existing methods, all labeled pairs are treated with equal importance without considering the semantic gap, which is not conducive to thoroughly leverage the supervised information. We present a general framework for supervised hashing to address the above two limitations. We do not toughly require a dissimilar pair to have maximum Hamming distance. Instead, a soft constraint which can be viewed as a regularization to avoid over-fitting is utilized. Moreover, we impose different weights to different training pairs, and these weights can be automatically adjusted in the learning process. Experiments on two benchmarks show that the proposed method can easily outperform other state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Objective To study the killing effect of alcohol on Trichinella spiralis infective larvae. Methods The muscle larvae were obtained from the Kunming mice experimentally infected with T. spiralis. The viability of the muscle larvae was observed by Methylene blue-eosin-borax (M.E.B.) staining after treating with the different concentration of alcohol for different time in the condition of mimic gastric environment. The mice were orally inoculated with the larvae treated by the different concentration of alcohol. The development of the larvae in intestine and its reproductive capacity were observed in mice. Results The survival time of muscle larvae in alcohol was shorted with the increase of alcohol concentration, the mortality rate of larvae in 45° alcohol for 30 min and in 65° alcohol for 10 min were 100% (96/96) and 100% (90/90). Although the M.E.B. staining results showed the survival rate of larvae in 30°, 25°, 20°alcohol for 2h, 4h and 4h were 57.6% (76/132), 98.6% (70/71) and 100% (136/136),respectively, neither adult worms in intestine nor larvae in muscle were observed in the mice inoculated with larvae treated by alcohol. No worms were not recovered from intestine and muscle of mice inoculated with the infected muscles treated in 35°, 30°, 25° alcohol for 0.5h, 2h and 4h, respectively. Conclusion The alcohol above 20° has the strong killing effect on Trichinella muscle larvae. Although the muscle larvae treated in alcohol are still viable, they have lost their infectivity. The results suggest that drinking of alcohol at the time of raw or undercooked meat consumption have some party in prevention of Trichinella infection.",

        "abstract": "The past decades have seen an explosive growth in the application of density functional theory (DFT) methods to molecular systems that are of interest in a variety of scientific fields. Owing to its balanced accuracy and efficiency, DFT plays particularly useful roles in the theoretical investigation of large molecules. Even for biological molecules such as proteins, DFT finds application in the form of, e.g., hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM), in which DFT may be used as a QM method to describe a higher prioritized region in the system, while a MM force field may be used to describe remaining atoms. Iron-containing molecules are particularly important targets of DFT calculations. From the viewpoint of chemistry, this is mainly because iron is abundant on earth, iron plays powerful (and often enigmatic) roles in enzyme catalysis, and iron thus has the great potential for biomimetic catalysis of chemically difficult transformations. In this paper, we present a brief overview of several recent applications of DFT to iron-containing non-heme synthetic complexes, heme-type cytochrome P450 enzymes, and non-heme iron enzymes, all of which are of particular interest in the field of bioinorganic chemistry. Emphasis will be placed on our own work.",

Furthermore,in the lymphoblastic leukemic cell lines,P-gp and chemokine receptor CXCR4 were highly expressed.The results show that the protein microarray could find the diversity of drug resistance-related proteins in different leukemic cell lines.Combined detection of more than one drug resistance-related proteins is helpful to study the drug resistance mechanism of leukemia.",

        "abstract": "This work is aimed at providing a supramolecular strategy for tuning the cytotoxicity in chemotherapy. To this end, as a proof of concept, we employed dynamic cucurbit[7]uril(CB[7])-mediated host-guest interaction to control the loading and releasing of dimethyl viologen (MV) as a model antitumor agent. MV has high cytotoxicity to both normal cells and tumor cells without specificity. By encapsulating MV into the hydrophobic cavity of CB[7], the cytotoxicity of MV to normal cells can be significantly decreased. When the host-guest complex of MV-CB[7] is added into tumor cells with overexpressed spermine, the antitumor activity of MV can be recovered in tumor cell environment. There are two reasons behind this effect: on the one hand, spermine has a high affinity to CB[7], leading to releasing of MV from MV-CB[7]; on the other hand, CB[7] can soak up spermine, which is essential for tumor cell growth, therefore decreasing the cell viability furthermore. Then, it is highly anticipated that this kind of supramolecular strategy could apply to clinical antitumor agents and provide a new approach for decreasing the cytotoxicity and increasing the antitumor activity, thus opening horizons of supramolecular chemotherapy.

According to the onset time, preeclampsia group were divided into two groups:early-onset preeclampsia group (<34 weeks, 20 patients) and later-onset preeclampsia group (≥34 weeks, 20 patients). The expression of Survivin and Caspase-3 in placenta in both groups were determined by immunohistochemistry. Statistic analysis was done by image analysis system.Results The level of Survivin in placental villus trophoblast cytoplasm of pre-eclampsia group was significantly lower than that of control group (P<0.05).The level of Caspase-3 in the placental villus trophoblast and cytoplasm membrane of pre-eclampsia group was significantly higher than that of control group(P<0.05).Compared with the later- onset, early-onset group had lower Survivin expression and higher Caspase-3 expression.

        "abstract": "As a critical technique to support the multimedia services - the major traffic in cooperative cognitive radio networks (CRNs), the statistical quality-of-service (QoS) technique has been proved to be effective in statistically guaranteeing delay-bounded video transmissions over the time- varying wireless channels. On the other hand, in modern cooperative CRNs, the full-duplex spectrum sensing (FD-SS) scheme is designed to be a promising candidate technique for fully utilizing the channel spectrum while significantly enhancing the performance. However, how to efficiently integrate the FD-SS technique in supporting statistical QoS over cooperative CRNs imposes many new challenges not met before. To effectively overcome the above-mentioned difficulties, we propose the QoS-driven resource allocation scheme to implement FD-SS based multimedia services in cooperative CRNs. In particular, under the Nakagami-m channel model, we establish the cooperative spectrum sharing system model. We develop the FD-SS scheme and derive the probabilities of miss detection and false alarm for the proposed FD-SS scheme over cooperative CRNs. Given the statistical QoS constraints, we analyze the effective capacity and our proposed optimal resource allocation policy using the proposed FD-SS architecture over cooperative CRNs. Also conducted is a set of simulations which evaluate the system performance and show that our proposed resource allocation policy can achieve the optimality under the statistical delay-bounded QoS constraints over cooperative CRNs.",

        "abstract": "Common deployment schemes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are built upon the assumption that the boundary effects can be ignored in the sensing field, which result in additional repair work to detect boundaries and redeem coverage holes along them. This repair not only breaks the uniformity of the deployed network, but also causes extra manual and material costs in practice. According to the geometry characteristics of a target area, we propose an innovative deployment scheme GRLD (Growth Rings Like Deployment), which can achieve coverage as well as connectivity without boundary effects. We also prove the full coverage and connectivity of this scheme and compare its efficiency with some popular regular deployment patterns, such as the square grid and the hexagon grid. Our work is the first to apply biological principles to the study and design of deployment schemes in WSNs, which avoids boundary effects efficiently and provides more adaptability.",

Methods We firstly transfected hUCBDCs with Cx43, then co-cultured with SUP-B15 cells(a ph+ALL cell line). The ability of cell proliferation was detected by cell counting kit-8 after 72 hours of co-culture. The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry after 72 hours of co-culture. Results The hUCBDCs inhibited the proliferation of SUP-B15. The hUCBDCs transfected with Cx43 appeared to be more effective to inhibit the proliferation of SUP-B15 compare to the hUCBDCs untransfected with Cx43(P<0.05). The rate of apoptosis was at(5.51±0.51)% in the group of hUCBDCs transfected with Cx43, which is higher than in the group of hUCBDCs untransfected with Cx43 [(2.26±1.41)%] and negative control group[(2.97±1.58)%](P<0.05). Conclusion Cx43 modified hUCBDCs can inhibit the proliferation of SUP-B15, as well as improve the rate of apoptosis of SUP-B15.",

To this end, a water-soluble bifunctional monomer bearing two naphthalene moieties and a phenylbenzene moiety, as well as a small molecule with antibacterial activity were synthesized. The side-chain antibacterial supramolecular polymer was fabricated through self-sorting of the bifunctional monomer, the small-molecule antibacterial agent, and cucurbit[8]uril. It displayed enhanced antibacterial efficacy against ampicillin-resistant E. coli owing to the local enrichment effect. The controlled degradation of the antibacterial supramolecular polymer could well regulate its antibacterial performance from high to low activity. It is anticipated that this line of research may lead to novel antibacterial supramolecular materials for building degradable antibiotics with enhanced antibacterial efficacy to fight against drug-resistant bacteria.",

The Cx43 expression levels of ABMSCs and NBMSCs were detected by using immunohistochemistry and computer gray scale assay, and the difference of gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) was examined through dry transfer technique. The results showed that expression level of Cx43 in ABMSCs was lower than that in NBMSCs and its function of GJIC in ABMSCs was also weaker than that in NBMSCs. It is concluded that cell-cell communication function is lowered in ABMSCs.",

The continuous dynamic monitoring is conducted by means of embedded earth pressure piezometers and pore piezometers around the tunnel. The response frequency and stress amplitude of the saturated soft clay are studied with the distance from the tunnel due to the subway vibration loading. A formula is proposed for the attenuation of the dynamic pressure response in the soil. Then, based on the continuous field monitored data, and using the laboratory GDS (Global Digital System) test apparatus, the developing law of the pore water pressure of the saturated soft clay around tunnel is explored with the distance. By the GDS test, the model of the increasing pore water pressure of the saturated soft clay is put forward under the vibration loading. It is also amended by field monitored data. Finally the model is obtained. The result offers a valuable reference to the design, construction and the safe operation of the subway tunnel.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge sharing visibility KSV is a critical environmental factor which can reduce social loafing in knowledge sharing KS. This is especially true in ICT-based KS in learning organisations. As such, it is imperative that we better understand how to design technology enabled knowledge management systems KMS to support high KSV. This article examines the impact of knowledge management technology functions e.g. tracking, knowledge storing on KSV through qualitative analysis of 16 semi-structured interviews with participants in a Chinese company. Impact and implications of use for their existing KMS are examined. This article also examined the effects of department characteristics i.e. group size and task characteristics and individual roles i.e. employee positions on the IT–KSV relationship. Results encourage applied statistical, tracking, knowledge distribution and knowledge storing functions for monitoring explicit KS, and suggest integration of visualised knowledge maps with communication tools e.g. Instant Messenger IM to support visibility for implicit KS. Findings also suggest that KM technologies are more salient on improving KSV in large department with routine tasks, and that low-level employees may have more positive attitude on accepting communication tools on sharing knowledge. Extension to use of Web 2.0 technologies e.g. weblogs in KMS is also explored.",

        "abstract": "Abnormal immunophenotypes of hematopoietic cells can be detected by flow cytometry (FCM) to assist the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We previously established a FCM scoring system for the diagnosis of low-grade MDS. In this study, additional valuable antigens were involved in an updated FCM scoring system (u-FCMSS) for all MDS subtypes. The u-FCMSS showed better sensitivity and specificity (89.4% and 96.5%) in distinguishing MDS from non-clonal cytopenia diseases. Validation analysis of u-FCMSS exhibited comparable sensitivity and specificity (86.7% and 93.3%) and high agreement rate (88.9%) of FCM diagnosis with morphological diagnosis at optimal cut-off (score 3). The distribution of FCM scores in different disease stages was also analyzed. The results suggested that early scoring from abnormal expression of mature myeloid/lymphoid antigens and advanced scoring from abnormal expression of stem/progenitor antigens expression constituted the majority of FCM scores of low-grade and high-grade MDS, respectively. High early scoring was generally accompanied by low IPSS-R score and superior survival, whereas high advanced scoring was accompanied by high IPSS-R score and inferior survival. In addition, the low-risk MDS patients with high early scoring and low advanced scoring were revealed as candidates for immunosuppressive therapy, whereas those with high advanced scoring and low early scoring may be more suitable for decitabine treatment. In conclusion, the u-FCMSS is a useful tool for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment selection in MDS. Differences in classes of antigens expressed and in distribution of FCM scores may reflect distinctive stage characteristics of MDS during disease progression.",

Recently emerged advanced self-interference cancellation and suppression techniques have shown the possibility of avoiding the overwhelmed self-interference of the wireless full-duplex transmission. However, to achieve the double system throughput in wireless full-duplex networks, not only the efficient self-interference cancellation and suppression techniques in the physical-layer is necessary, but also the practical full-duplex medium access control (MAC) protocol is highly demanded in the datalink layer. In this paper, we propose a novel request to send (RTS)/full-duplex clear to send (FCTS) based MAC protocol which can support both bidirectional and unidirectionallinks in wireless full-duplex networks. Then, we develop the analytical model to characterize the performance of our proposed full-duplex MAC protocol in wireless full-duplex networks. Also conducted is a set of numerical evaluations showing that our proposed full-duplex MAC protocol can achieve superior system throughput as compared with that of the conventional half-duplex MAC protocol for wireless networks.",

        "abstract": "The fifth-generation (5G) communications and wireless networks, which are expected as the next new era of wireless networks, have received much research attention in recent years. The academic and industrial researchers have developed a great deal of 5G candidate techniques to improve the performance of 5G wireless networks, where the most important two metrics are the spectrum efficiency and the quality-of-service (QoS). Jointly using full-duplex (FD) wireless communications and device- to-device (D2D) communications, forming the FD-D2D communications, can significantly increase the spectrum efficiency of 5G wireless networks in frequency/time/space-domains. On the other hand, not only increasing the spectrum efficiency, but also supporting QoS guarantees is very important for 5G wireless networks. However, supporting QoS guarantees for FD-D2D communications imposes the new challenges that we need to provide heterogeneous QoS guarantees for different types of traffics over the same link simultaneously. To overcome the aforementioned problems, in this paper we propose the heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning framework for FD-D2D communications over 5G wireless networks. In particular, we formulate the optimization problems to maximize the system throughput subject to heterogeneous statistical delay-bound QoS requirements. Then, we convert the resulted non- convex optimization problem into an equivalent convex optimization problem, solving which we can derive the optimal heterogeneous-QoS-driven power allocation scheme to maximize the system throughput while guaranteeing the heterogeneous statistical delay-bound QoS requirements. The extensive simulation results obtained show that our proposed heterogeneous-QoS-driven power allocation scheme can significantly increase the system throughput while guaranteeing heterogeneous statistical delay-bound QoS requirements.",

        "abstract": "Mixed-lineage acute leukemia (MAL) is characterized as acute leukemia involving acute myeloid cells and lymphoid cells at the same time. It is easily misdiagnosed because of the dual characteristics involving both lymphoid and myeloid cells and has a poor prognosis. We retrospectively analyzed the features and treatment effectiveness in a single center in 40 patients with MAL. The morphology was consistent with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (47.5%) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (20%) or was inconclusive (32.5%). Twenty-two patients were characterized as B/myeloid, and 18 patients as T/myeloid. Cytogenetics showed t(9;22)/(Ph(+)) (12.5%) and 11q23/MLL rearrangements (6.25%). The rate of first complete remission for patients undergoing chemotherapy based on the features of both ALL and AML and of either ALL or AML was 71.4 and 42.9%, respectively. The 1-year overall survival rates were 37.5 and 60.0% for chemotherapy and chemotherapy followed by haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), respectively. The 1-year disease-free survival rates were 25.0 and 50.0% for chemotherapy and chemotherapy followed by HSCT, respectively. These results showed that MAL is confirmed to be a poor-risk disease. The chemotherapy for remission induction should be based on both myeloid cells and lymphoid cells. Transplantation should be performed after the first remission.",

Prophylactic preventing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was adopted with cyclosporine A (CsA)/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)/methotrexate (MTX) and additional ATG for unrelated-donor PBSCT.Results:All patients obtained hematopoieteic reconstitution. The incidence rate of Acute GVHD was 23.1%,and chronic GVHD was 21.2% (limited 15.4%). Nine patients died of GVHD,infection,disease relapse or development,and thirty-five patients were disease-free survival (DFS) from 3 to 46 months. Of patients,9 was ALL-CR1(first time CR):5 in DFS,2 in live with disease(LWD),2 in death; 2 was ALL-NR:2 in death; 8 was AML-CR1:6 in DFS,2 in LWD; 4 was AML-CR2 (second time CR):2 in DFS,1 in LWD,1 in death; 22 was CML(chronic phase):19 in DFS,2 in LWD,1 in death; 4 was CML (accelerated phase):2 in DFS,1 in LWD,1 in death; 3 was CML (acute transformation phase):1 in DFS,2 in death.Conclusion:Allo-PBSCT is an only effective approach for the cure of patients with acute/chronic leukemia. It is strongly recommended that CML (chronic phase) and AL-CR1 adopt Allo-PBSCT therapy as soon as possible.",

Methods Heidelberg retina flowmeter was employed to measure the volume,flow and velocity in retinal vessels of the impaired eyes in 47 patients with unilateral rhegmatogenous retinal detachments 1 day before and 1 week,1 month and 3 months after scleral buckling procedure.The contralateral eyes were served as controls. ResultsThere were significant differences in the volume,flow and velocity of retinal vessels between the impared eyes and controls preoperation and postoperation(P<0.01).The refractive factor was the main factor which affected the preoperative hemodynamic parameters.The degree of tightness of the encircling band was the main surgical factor which induced the hemodynamic changes 1 week postoperation.No ischemic syndrome was observed postoperation and expected visual improvement was achieved Conclusion The retinal blood flow decreases after retinal detachment.Scleral buckling procedure further decreases blood flow in retina for a short time after surgery,with no great harm to the anatomic and functional repair.Heidelberg retina flowmeter is a useful tool in the detection of retinal hemodynamic changes.",

In this study, an observational, retrospective and multi-center analysis was performed to explore the decitabine schedule for the treatment of MDS. A total of 79 patients received reduced dosage decitabine treatment (15 mg/M2/day intravenously for five consecutive days every four weeks). Fifty-three out of the 79 patients were defined as intermediate-2/high risk by international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) risk category. 67.1% of MDS patients achieved treatment response including complete response (CR) (n = 23), Partial response (n = 1), marrow CR (mCR) with hematological improvement (HI) (n = 11), mCR without HI (n = 11) and HI alone (n = 7) with a median of 4 courses (range 1-11). The median overall survival (OS) was 18.0 months. The median OS was 22.0, 17.0 and 12.0 months in the patients with CR, those with other response, and those without response, respectively. In addition, this regimen contributed to zero therapy-related death and punctual course delivery, although III or IV grade of cytopenia was frequently observed. In conclusion, the 15 mg/M2/d×5 day decitabine regimen was effective and safe for Chinese MDS patients with IPSS score of 0.5 or higher.",

The tele-screening system was based on non-mydriatic digital eye fundus camara photography and computer network technology. 109 type 2 diabetes mellitus residents were randomly selected for system evaluation, which included: (1) The consistency of the far visual acuity examined by an ophthalmologist and a trained inspector, evaluated by paired t-sample test; the consistency of diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy by tele-screening system and traditional screening method by ophthalmoscope, slit-lamp bimicroscope combined with non-contact lens after pupil dilation, evaluated by kappa value and intraclass coefficient correlation. (2) The proper compression ratio of the fundus photographs transferring through the internet, evaluated by intraclass coefficient correlation. (3) The working time for the tele-screening on the residents, comparing with the traditional screening method.The visual acuities of the 218 eyes in 109 residents examined by an ophthalmologist were < 0.05 in 13 eyes, between 0.05 and 0.3 in 61 eyes, > or = 0.3 in 144 eyes. No significant difference was found between the vision acuity given by different examiner (t = -0.572, P = 0.568). 52 eyes were diagnosed as DR by traditional screening method, while 51 eyes were diagnosed as DR by the tele-screening method, so in DR diagnosis, high consistency were found with kappa value as 0.885, 95%CI 0.807 to 0.963, and in DR degree diagnosis with ICC value as 0.91, 95%CI 0.85 to 0.94. The most compression ratio of fundus photographs was as low as 15% (526 x 350). It took 5 to 7 minutes for the tele-screening system to examining and giving diagnosis of a diabetes mellitus resident, a little bit sooner than traditional screening method.This community-based tele-screening system can meet the requirements of mass screening for diabetic retinopathy.",

        "abstract": "Wireless network virtualization provides an efficient technique to reduce the cost of overall networks by allowing multiple wireless virtual networks to be mapped onto one physical substrate wireless network. One of its important challenges of this technology is how to efficiently allocate the wireless resources of physical wireless networks to multiple virtual network users. To overcome these challenges, we develop the game- theory based schemes to resolve the resources allocation problem on both buffer/storage space and transmission-rate. Mapping the virtual networks onto the physical wireless network is formulated as the process of bidding for the limited wireless resources from a physical substrate wireless network, and competing with the other mobile-user players, which bid for the same wireless resources of a physical substrate wireless network. Our proposed game- theory schemes work as follows. First, virtual network announces its value function to the physical substrate wireless network, to claim for their required resources (buffer/storage space and transmission bandwidth). Then, the physical substrate wireless network allocates the two types of wireless resources to each virtual wireless network and charges for the provided resources according to the claimed value functions for all virtual users and its current network conditions. Finally our proposed schemes feed back conjectural prices for virtual networksu0027 next-time bid. By accepting the conjectural prices, the game of virtual networks converges the Nash Equilibrium where their long term payoffs are optimized. The simulation results obtained validate and evaluate our proposed schemes through numerical solutions and the simulations.",

Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), as the main component of HIM, have been well studied. However, the highly invasive procedure of bone marrow (BM) collection limits the clinical application of BMSCs. Human umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells (hUCBDSCs) isolated and cultured in our laboratory have attracted much attention for their ease collection and low probability of pathophoresis. Previous research demonstrated that hUCBDSCs have numerous functions that are identical to those of BMSCs, for example, hUCBDSCs can support the growth of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, especially during the expansion of megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Mk), promote engraftment after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), exert immunosuppressive effects on xenogenic T cells in vitro and suppress acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in vivo. Although hUCBDSCs, as new stromal cells, have not been used in clinical practice, they have great practical significance because of their superiority in hematopoiesis and the regulation of immunity.",

        "abstract": "Gold nanoparticles have been widely used as nanocarriers in gene delivery. However, the binding mechanism between gold nanoparticles and DNA bases remains a puzzle. We performed density functional theory calculations with and without dispersion correction on Au(N)( (N = 13, 55, or 147) nanoparticles in high-symmetry cuboctahedral structures to understand the mechanism of their binding with guanine at the under-coordinated sites. Our study verified that: (i) negative charges transfer from the inner area to the surface of a nanoparticle as a result of the surface quantum trapping effect; and (ii) the valence states shift up toward the Fermi level, and thereby participate more actively in the binding to guanine. These effects are more prominent in a smaller nanoparticle, which has a larger surface-to-volume ratio. Additional fragment orbital analysis revealed that: (i) electron donation from the lone-pair orbital of N to the unoccupied orbital of the Au cluster occurs in all complexes; (ii) π back-donation occurs from the polarized Au d(yz) orbital to the N p(y)-π* orbital when there is no Au···H-N hydrogen bond, and, (iii) depending on the configuration, Au···H-N hydrogen bonding can also exist, to which the Au occupied orbital and the H-N unoccupied orbital contribute.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of bone development and regeneration. The aim of the present study was to determine whether miR-203a-3p.1 is involved in osteogenic differentiation of multiple myeloma (MM)-mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the potential underlying mechanism. MSCs were isolated from patients with MM and normal subjects and confirmed by flow cytometry using specific surface markers. The osteogenic differentiation capacity of MM-MSCs was identified by Alizarin Red S calcium deposition staining and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) of typical osteoblast differentiation markers. The role of miR-203a-3p.1 in the osteoblast differentiation of MM-MSCs was determined by gain or loss of function experiments. The target of miR-203a-3p.1 was identified using bioinformatics (including the miRNA target prediction database TargetScan, miRDB, DIANA TOOLS and venny 2.1.0), luciferase reporter assay, RT-qPCR and western blotting. The expression levels of proteins involved in the Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling pathway were detected by western blot analysis. The results revealed that the osteogenic differentiation capacity of MM-MSCs was reduced when compared with normal (N)-MSCs, as demonstrated by a decrease in calcium deposition and mRNA expression of typical osteoblast differentiation markers, including ALP, OPN and OC. In addition, miR-203a-3p.1 was downregulated in N-MSCs following osteoblast induction, whereas no changes were observed in MM-MSCs. The downregulation of miR-203a-3p.1 resulted in increased osteogenic potential, as indicated by the increase in the mRNA expression levels of the typical osteoblast differentiation markers, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OC). Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assay analysis indicated that mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 9 (Smad9) may be a direct target of miR-203a-3p.1 in N-MSCs. The RT-qPCR and western blot assays revealed that overexpression of smad9 significantly enhanced the effect of miR-203a-3p.1 inhibitors on osteoblast markers, which indicated that miR-203a-3p.1 inhibitors may regulate the osteogenic differentiation of MM-MSCs by upregulating Smad9. In addition, the Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling pathway was activated following miR-203a-3p.1 inhibition. These results suggest that miR-203a-3p.1 may serve an important role in the osteogenic differentiation of MM-MSCs by regulating Smad9 expression.",

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the expression and function of HIF-1α in human leukemia bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and to identify the downstream targets of HIF-1α. HIF-1α expression was detected at both the RNA and protein levels using real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) were detected in stromal cells by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HIF-1α was blocked by constructing the lentiviral RNAi vector system and infecting the BMSCs. The Jurkat cell/BMSC co-cultured system was constructed by putting the two cells into the same suitable cultured media and conditions. Cell adhesion and secretion functions of stromal cells were evaluated after transfection with the lentiviral RNAi vector of HIF-1α. Increased HIF-1α mRNA and protein was detected in the nucleus of the acute myeloblastic and acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared with normal BMSCs. The lentiviral RANi vector for HIF-1α was successfully constructed and was applied to block the expression of HIF-1α. When HIF-1α of BMSCs was blocked, the expression of VEGF and SDF-1 secreted by stromal cells were decreased. When HIF-1α was blocked, the co-cultured Jurkat cell's adhesion and migration functions were also decreased. Taken together, these results suggest that HIF-1α acts as an important transcription factor and can significantly affect the secretion and adhesion functions of leukemia BMSCs.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the influence of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) surgery on elderly patients in terms of visual acuity, vision-related quality of life and its cost-effectiveness.Elderly patients over 70 years old, who were diagnosed and underwent RRD surgery at Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, from January 1, 2009, through January 1, 2013. The participants received scleral buckling surgery and vitreous surgery with or without scleral buckling under retrobulbar anesthesia. We followed the patients for 1 year and collected best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), vision-related quality of life, and direct medical costs data. Utility values elicited by time-trade-off were analyzed to determine the quality of life. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained in life expectancy were calculated and discounted at 3% annually. Costs per QALY gained were reported using the bootstrap method. Further analyses were made for two age groups, age 70-79 and age over 80 years. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test stability of the results.98 patients were included in the study. The BCVA significantly improved by 0.53±0.44 (Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (logMAR)) at the 1-year postoperative time point (p<0.001). Utility values increased from 0.77 to 0.84 (p<0.001), and an average of 0.4 QALYs were gained in the life expectancy. Costs per QALY gained from the RRD surgery were 33,186 Chinese Yuan (CNY) (5,276 US dollars (USD))/QALY; 24,535 CNY (3,901 USD)/QALY for the age group of 70-79 years and 71,240 CNY (11,326 USD)/QALY for the age group over 80 years.RRD surgery improved the visual acuity and quality of life in the elderly patients over 70 years old. According to the World Health Organization's recommendation, at a threshold of willingness to pay of 115,062 CNY (18,293 USD)/QALY, RRD surgery is cost effective in the elderly patients.",

From the perspective of solvent hydrogen bond (O:H O or HB with “:” being the electron lone pair of oxygen) transition from the mode of the ordinary water to the hydrating states, we examined the solvation bonding dynamics and the solute capabilities of O:H O bond and surface stress transition using differential Raman spectroscopy and contact angle detection. Results suggest that besides the short-range O:H van der Waals (vdW) bond, the H ↔ H and O: ⇔ :O repulsive intermolecular interactions, and the molecular dipolar polarization play important roles in disrupting the solution network and surface stress. Observations may infer the manner of DNA fragmentation by aldehyde and formic acid disruption.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   An electrochemical immunosensor was developed for ultrasensitive detection of microcystin-LR in water. MIL-101, a porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) material based on trivalent chromium skeleton were synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis method, and loaded with Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) to prepare Au NPs@MIL-101 composite materials which were used as a marker to label anti microcystin-LR (Anti-MC-LR). The composite materials have strong catalytic properties to the oxidation of ascorbic acid. Anti-MC-LR was immobilized on glassy carbon electrode surface using electrodeposition graphene oxide (GO) as an immobilization matrix to construct a competitive microcystin-LR immunosensor. The electrochemical immunosensor display linear relationship in the range of 0.05 ng/mL−75 μg/mL with linear correlation coefficient of 0.9951 and detection limit of 0.02 ng/mL (S/N = 3). This sensor was used to detect microcystin-LR in the water sample. The recovery was 102.43%, which is satisfied. The good testing results indicate the sensor has a great prospect in practical application.",

Molybdenum disulfide–polyaniline–gold nanoparticles (MoS2–PANI–GNPs) with high conductivity were employed as the substrate to assist the electron transfer. Compared with a bare electrode, an about 10-fold increase in the peak current could be detected for MoS2–PANI–GNPs. Moreover, MoS2–PANI–GNPs which have abundant adsorbing sites and a large surface area could greatly increase loading amounts of antibodies and thus, significantly improve the performance of biosensing. Under optimized experimental conditions, the proposed sensing strategy provides a linear dynamic range from 0.2 to 80 ng mL−1 and a detection limit of 40 pg mL−1. The proposed immunosensor has also been used to determine CRP in human serum with satisfactory results. This possibly makes it an attractive platform in bioanalysis of proteins and other molecules.",

The structure of dendrimer complexes was confirmed by 1 H NMR and element analysis. The stoichiometry rate between the dendritic quaternary bromide and porphyrin core was 4:1. Solvatochromism studies of the dendritic complexes showed that the (G-3) 4 P dendritic complex is more stable than the (G-2) 4 P dendritic complex. It is inferred that hydrophobic interactions play an important role in stabilizing these dendrimer complexes in addition to coulombic interactions.",

        "abstract": "A total of 32 patients (25 with advanced MDS and 7 with t-AML) were enrolled in this study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the low-dose cytarabine and homoharringtonine in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (CHG protocol) in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or MDS-transformed acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML). All the patients were administered the CHG regimen comprising low-dose cytarabine (25 mg/day, intravenous continuous infusion, days 1-14), homoharringtonine (1 mg/day, intravenous continuous infusion, days 1-14), and G-CSF (300 microg/day, subcutaneous injection, days 0-14, interrupted when the peripheral white blood cell count reached >20 x 10(9)/L). The overall response rate was 71.9% after the administration of one course of the CHG regimen. Of the 32 patients, 15 (46.9%) achieved complete remission (CR) and 8 (25%) achieved partial remission (PR). This regimen was followed by a post-remission therapy that included conventional chemotherapy, when CR was achieved. Of the patients with CR who just received post-remission regimens as homoharringtonine and cytarabine (HA) and daunorubicin and cytarabine (DA) 6 relapsed rapidly and just had a mean 6.1 months of CR. Otherwise, the other 8 out of 14 patients with CR alternatively received subsequent chemotherapy, which combined mitoxantrone, idarubicin, pirarubicin, or aclarubicin with cytarabine. The mean CR duration of the 8 patients had reached 10.6 months, and 5 of the 8 still kept a continuous CR. The median overall survival (OS) was 18.2 months. There were no statistically significant differences for CR, PR, and OS when the patients were grouped by age, blasts in bone marrow, and karyotypes, respectively. No treatment-related deaths were observed. Myelosuppression was mild to moderate, and no severe non-hematological toxicity was observed. Thus, a CHG priming regimen as an induction therapy was well tolerated and effective in patients with advanced MDS or t-AML. Stronger and alternative subsequent chemotherapy is necessary for patients with CR to maintain longer CR and better OS.",

Their common clinical manifestations were cyanosis in labia oris and nail, and associated with chest distress, tachypnea and hypodynamia after slight physical activity, as well as some apparently related signs and symptoms of right heart disfunction. Ultrasonic cardiography (UCG) showed that right atrium and ventricle dilated, ASD. And color doppler flow imaging (CDFI) indicated that left-to-right and (or) right-to-left shunt at the atrial level both in systole and diastole, regurgitation in pulmonary valve was mild, and in tricuspid valve was moderate-severe. Cardiac catheterization confirmed that pulmonary hypertension was only mild to moderate.

        "abstract": "We consider the full-duplex transmission over bidirectional channels with imperfect self-interference cancelation in wireless networks. In particular, together using propagation-domain interference suppression, analog-domain interference cancellation, and digital-domain interference cancellation, we develop the optimal dynamic power allocation schemes for the wireless full-duplex sum-rate optimization problem which aims at maximizing the sum-rate of wireless full-duplex bidirectional transmissions. In the high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) region, the full-duplex sum-rate maximization problem is a convex optimization problem. For interference-dominated wireless full-duplex transmission in the high SINR region, we derive the closed-form expression for the optimal dynamic power allocation scheme. For non-interference-dominated wireless full-duplex transmission in the high SINR region, we obtain the optimal dynamic power allocation scheme by numerically solving the corresponding Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. While the full-duplex sum-rate maximization problem is usually not a convex optimization problem, by developing the tightest lower-bound function and using the logarithmic change of variables technique, we convert the full-duplex sum-rate maximization problem to a convex optimization problem. Then, using our proposed iteration algorithm, we can numerically derive the optimal dynamic power allocation scheme for the more generic scenario. Also presented are the numerical results which validate our developed optimal dynamic power allocation schemes.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive MAC protocols are designed to efficiently utilize the scarce spectral resources without affecting the performance characteristics of primary users. The use of spectrum opportunities can often require stochastic approaches due to difficulty in predicting their appearance. Infrastructure based coordinated access techniques are not viable for many applications and spectrum bands, especially in the case of wireless local area and sensor networks. In this article, we describe CogMAC, a decentralized cognitive MAC protocol, which is based on the multichannel preamble reservation scheme. The protocol dynamically selects an available communication channel using a distributed channel selection scheme and allows nodes to be completely asynchronous to each other. CogMAC does not require a common control channel or a cooperative infrastructure. The MAC design addresses practical issues such as network dynamics and traffic awareness. We have carried out the performance evaluation of our CogMAC protocol on Wireless Open Access Research Platform (WARP) SDR testbed. Experimental results indicate that our protocol is able to achieve reliable data communication by opportunistically utilizing the available spectrum holes even in harshly interfering environments.",

Consistency between the density-function theory calculations and the BOLS-TB prediction affirmed that: (i) the  E  g  expansion originates from the Hamiltonian correction due to the size-dependent undercoordination effect; (ii) both the contraction of the ribbon up to 11% and the edge quantum trapping of charge of 0.05e determine the width dependent Eg change; and, (iii) Under-coordination induced quantum entrapment in the armchair SbNRs is stronger than that of zigzag SbNRs, resulting in larger  E  g  (∼0.3–0.6eV higher). Hence, the physical origin for the modulation of  E  g  (1.2–3.1 eV) by edge quantum entrapment or by other under-coordinated sites will benefit the  E  g  engineering of antimonene for wide electro-optical applications.",

        "abstract": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) cache techniques for information-centric networks (ICN) provide the local data resources services for mobile users by storing the popular data contents in their peer mobile usersu0027 cache stations, so that a mobile user can obtain these data contents directly from its peer mobile users instead of the remote service provider. Retrieving the requested data content from the nearby storage locations (i.e., cache stations), the P2P caching technique improves the network performance by reducing the duplicate data transmission traffic. To overcome the difficulties of minimizing the data transmission delay for the P2P caching system, we divide all mobile users in a wireless cell as several P2P caching groups, where a mobile user can obtain its requested data content from a peer mobile user in the same group, or from a peer mobile user in another group. We propose the Markov decision process (MDP) based stochastic optimization scheme in this cache system with dynamic number of peers to derive the optimal lifespan for cached data contents in cache stations. The objective of our proposed stochastic optimization framework is to efficiently minimize the cost function, which jointly measures the cache size/cost and the data content transmission delay, over all P2P caching groups in the wireless cell. To achieve this goal, we apply the finite-state Markov chain to characterize the number of mobile users in each caching group and dynamically adapt the cached data lifespan in cache stations. We also develop an efficient iteration algorithm to implement our proposed MDP scheme. Finally, we validate and evaluate the performance of our proposed schemes through the numerical analyses, which show that our proposed schemes converge to a unit optimal solution.",

For its efficiency, the lifting implemantation has been also adopted in the international standard JPEG2000. It is known that the orthogonality of wavelets is an important property for many applications. This paper presents how to implement two band IIR orthogonal wavelet filter banks according to the lifting scheme. It is shown that a class of IIR orthogonal wavelet filter banks can be realized by using allpass filters in the lifting steps.

Chromosomal aberrations in both HCs and MSCs were identified using G-banding. We then performed DNA content analysis of the HCs and MSCs.Cytogenetic aberrations were detected in HCs from 13 of the 22 MDS patients (59%). Chromosomal aberrations in MSCs were detected in 15 of the 22 MDS patients (68%). No chromosomal abnormalities were identified in MSCs of the 7 healthy volunteers. We demonstrate herein that MSCs have distinct genetic abnormalities compared to HCs from the same individual. We observed a random loss of chromosomal material in significant proportions of MSCs. A high proportion of random loss may be a marker of chromosomal instability of MDS-MSCs. However, two case results showed that HCs and MSCs have different altered structural changes.Our results suggest enhanced genetic susceptibility of these cells in MDS patients. Our data indicates that the genetic alterations in MSCs may constitute a particular biological mechanism of MDS pathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "The multimedia transmission represents a typical big data application in the fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks. However, supporting multimedia big data transmission over 5G wireless networks imposes many new and open challenges because multimedia big data services are both time-sensitive and bandwidth-intensive over time-varying wireless channels with constrained wireless resources. To overcome these difficulties, in this paper we propose the information-centric virtualization architectures for software-defined statistical delay-bounded quality of service (QoS) provisioning over 5G multimedia big data wireless networks. In particular, our proposed schemes integrate the three 5G-promising candidate techniques to guarantee the statistical delay-bounded QoS for multimedia big data transmissions: 1) information-centric network (ICN), to derive the optimal in-network caching locations for multimedia big data; 2) network functions virtualization (NFV), to abstract the PHY-layer infrastructures into several virtualized networks to derive the optimal multimedia data contents delivery paths; and 3) software-defined networks (SDNs), to dynamically reconfigure wireless resources allocation architectures through the SDN-control plane. Under our proposed architectures, to jointly optimize the implementations of NFV and SDN techniques under ICN architectures, we develop the three virtual network selection and transmit-power allocation schemes to: 1) maximize single user’s effective capacity; 2) jointly optimize the aggregate effective capacity and allocation fairness over all users; and 3) coordinate non-cooperative gaming among all users, respectively. By simulations and numerical analyses, we show that our proposed architectures and schemes significantly outperform the other existing schemes in supporting the statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning over the 5G multimedia big data wireless networks.",

        "abstract": "Stromal cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), 2 important cell populations within the hematopoietic microenvironment, may play an important role in the development of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. We have successfully cultured human umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells (hUCBDSCs). It has been demonstrated that MSCs also exist in hUCB. However, we have not found any reports on the distinct characteristics of hUCBDSCs and human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCBDMSCs). In this study, hUCBDSCs and hUCBDMSCs were isolated from the cord blood of full-term infants using the same density gradient centrifugation and cultured in the appropriate medium. Some biological characteristics and hematopoietic supportive functions were compared in vitro. hUCBDSCs were distinct from hUCBDMSCs in morphology, proliferation, cell cycle, passage, immunophenotype, and the capacity for classical tri-lineage differentiation. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) gene expression was higher in hUCBDSCs than that in hUCBDMSCs. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that the secretion of G-CSF, thrombopoietin (TPO), and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by hUCBDSCs was higher than that by hUCBDMSCs. After coculture, the granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) of hematopoietic cells from the hUCBDSC feeder layer was more than that from the hUCBDMSC feeder layer. Flow cytometry was used to detect CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell committed differentiation during 14 days of coculture; the results demonstrated that CD14 and CD33 expression in hUCBDSCs was significantly higher than their expression in hUCBDMSCs. This observation was also true for the granulocyte lineage marker, CD15. This marker was expressed beginning at day 7 in hUCBDSCs. It was expressed earlier and at a higher level in hUCBDSCs compared with hUCBDMSCs. In conclusion, hUCBDSCs are different from hUCBDMSCs. hUCBDSCs are superior to hUCBDMSCs in supporting hematopoiesis stem/progenitor cells differentiation into myeloid lineage cells at an early stage in vitro.",

The influences of reaction conditions on grafting parameters i.e. product yield (Y%), AA conversion (C%), grafting ratio (G%) and grafting efficiency (GE%) were carefully studied. The effects of the phenolic hydroxyl (Ph-OH) group on the polymerization of AA and grafting reaction were researched. Graft copolymers were identified by the new absorption at 1,727 cm(-1), more homogenized morphology and higher decomposition temperature after grafted with AA, as illustrated in FTIR, SEM and TG spectra. The optimum synthesis conditions are as follows: H2O2=25.2 mol/L, FeCl2=63.0 mol/L, T=50°C and t=2h and the optimum percentages of Y, C, G and GE are 97.61%, 95.23%, 71.29% and 78.85%, respectively. The Ph-OH group of HLS-Ca cannot inhibit the polymerization of AA and is involved in the grafting reaction as an active center.",

The interaction between laser and sample stream, as well as the effects of different focal depth on the plasma excitation characteristics was analyzed. On the self-built two-phase flow experimental bench, the coal particles flow was ablated with laser in the atmospheric environment, under 1, 0.5, 0, -0.5 and -1 mm depth of focus, and the spectrometer was used to collect the plasma signal. Under certain conditions of laser energy and angle of received light, the changes of the plasma temperature, the electron density and the spectra of C, Si and Al with laser focal depth were studied. The results show that the laser focal depth has obvious impacts on the plasma temperature, electron density and elemental spectral intensity. The overall variation of the three parameters are consistency, and the most optimum point is at 0 mm, followed by 1.0, 0.5, -0.5 mm and the worst point is at -1 mm.",

With only a very few assumptions, solutions for the stress distribution can be obtained which satisfy all equilibrium equations, boundary conditions and continuity at the fibre/matrix. In the debonded region, a new friction law, in which the friction coefficient depends on the pull-out rate, is used to determine the interfacial shear stress. Numerical results for the stress distribution in both fully bonded and debonded regions are given for a typical carbon/epoxy composite system with different fibre pull-out rates, thermal residual stresses, material properties and the relative sizes of the fibre and matrix.",

Growth indexes of RD cells at different stages were observed dynamically, appropriate cell concentration was selected to test HEV71 infectivity and to determine the HEV71 neutralizing antibody titer in serum. The traditional microplate test was used as methodology comparison and results validation at the same time. Cell impedance was transformed to cell index (CI) value and visual dynamic curve through software, and the result showed that the observation of HEV71 infectivity was more than 5d when the RD cells concentration was 1. 5 X 10(4) hole on the 96 electronic orifice plate. Compared with the traditional cytopathic effect (CPE) through microscope observation method, the end point judgment results were consistent between these two methods at 132h (about 5. 5d) post virus inoculation. In the neutralization tests, three CI values of neutralizing antibody titers against HEV71 in human serum were correspond to those obtained from traditional 96 microplate microscopy. RTCA also suggested that the presentation time of CPE induced by the i virus could be different even the end point judgment was the same with the same neutralization antibody titer. Compared with the traditional microplate monitoring method, RTCA can save labor and eliminate the hands-on error in the monitoring HEV71 infectivity and antibody titer detection in serum. RTCA can be served as one of the supplementary methods of traditional detection method, with the advantages of dynamically observing the occurrence and development of cell pathological changes, and the variation of virus infectivity and serum neutralizing antibodies.",

        "abstract": "HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) is an effective and immediate treatment for high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (HR-AML) patients lacking matched donors. Relapse remains the leading cause of death for HR-AML patients after haplo-HSCT. Accordingly, the prevention of relapse remains a challenge in the treatment of HR-AML. In a multicenter randomized controlled trial in southwestern China, 178 HR-AML patients received haplo-HSCT with conditioning regimens involving recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) or non-rhG-CSF. The cumulative incidences of relapse and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. HR-AML patients who underwent the priming conditioning regimen with rhG-CSF had a lower relapse rate than those who were treated with non-rhG-CSF (38.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 28.1% to 48.3% versus 60.7%, 95% CI, 50.5% to 70.8%; P &amp;lt; .01). The cumulative incidences of acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, transplantation-related toxicity, and infectious complications appeared to be equivalent. In total, 53 patients in the rhG-CSF-priming group and 31 patients in the non-rhG-CSF-priming group were still alive at the median follow-up time of 42 months (range, 24 to 80 months). The 2-year probabilities of LFS and OS in the rhG-CSF-priming and non-rhG-CSF-priming groups were 55.1% (95% CI, 44.7% to 65.4%) versus 32.6% (95% CI, 22.8% to 42.3%) (P &amp;lt; .01) and 59.6% (95% CI, 49.4% to 69.7%) versus 34.8% (95% CI, 24.9% to 44.7%) (P &amp;lt; .01), respectively. Multivariate analyses indicated that the 2-year probability of LFS of patients who achieved complete remission (CR) before transplantation was better than that of patients who did not achieve CR. The 2-year probability of LFS of patients with no M4/M5/M6 subtype was better than that of patients with the M4/M5/M6 subtype in the G-CSF-priming group (67.4%; 95% CI, 53.8% to 80.9% versus 41.9%; 95% CI, 27.1% to 56.6%; P &amp;lt; .05). This study suggests that the rhG-CSF-priming conditioning regimen is an acceptable choice for HR-AML patients, especially for the patients with no M4/M5/M6 subtype who achieved CR before transplantation.",

        "abstract": "Objective To summarize the clinical outcomes of maze procedure using bipolar radiofrequency ablation accompanied with valve replacement for the surgical treatment of permanent atrial fibrillation(AF) and rheumatic valve diseases.Methods A total of 124 patients with permanent AF and rheumatic valves diseases undergoing surgical treatment from March 2006 to October 2010 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University were randomly divided into ablation group and control group using coin method with 62 patients in each group.The mean atrial fibrillation duration was(56.1±47.1) months in ablation group,and patients in this group underwent maze procedure using bipolar radiofrequency ablation and valve replacement.The mean atrial fibrillation duration was(43.8±25.6) months in control group,and patients in this group underwent only valve replacement.Demographic characteristics, cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB) time,aortic cross-clamping(ACC) time,mechanical ventilation time,intensive care unit(ICU) length of stay,postoperative complications and follow-up outcomes were compared between the two groups. Results The demographic characteristics of the two groups were not statistically different(P>0.05).The CPB time and ACC time between the two groups were not statistically different(P>0.05).The postoperative hospital stay of ablation group was significantly longer than that of control group(15.8±6.1 d vs.12.9±3.1 d,P=0.001).No patient needed permanent pacemaker implantation in either group.Postoperative ejection fraction of ablation group was significantly higher than that of control group(59.6%±9.2% vs.55.5%±5.4%,P<0.01).The rate of sinus rhythm maintenance at 6 months,12 months,18 months,24 months during follow-up in ablation group were 88.5%,87.5%,87.1% and 82.4% respectively,3.3%,2.2%,0.0%,and 0.0% in control group respectively,which was statistically different between the two groups(P<0.05).Conclusion Maze procedure using bipolar radiofrequency ablation is an effective surgical procedure for the treatment of permanent atrial fibrillation.",

        "abstract": "The Fc fragment DNA sequence of the immune gamma globulins (IgG1) was amplified from the human peripheral blood lymphocyte by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that this 699 bp DNA fragment possessed the complete hinge area, CH2 and CH3 structural region, and showed 100% identity to the Fc fragment DNA sequence of human IgG1 heavy chain which had been deposited in the GenBank database. Subsequently this Fc fragment DNA was inserted into pPICZαA vector of Pichia pastoris to construct the pPIgG1 plasmid. Next, scFv antibody gene of Pichia pastoris whose protein product was against the 40 000 adipocyte-specific plasma membrane protein was inserted into the pPIgG1 plasmid and constructed the pPIgG1-scFv Pichia pastoris expression vector. Validation analysis showed that ligation direction of the scFv gene of Pichia pastoris and the Fc fragment DNA was correct and was in agreement with the correct reading frame of scFv-Fc. These results suggested that the scFv-Fc Pichia pastoris expression vector had been successfully constructed and this established the primary foundation to the express a great quantity of scFv-Fc fusion antibody protein which had the similar structure to IgG and also possessed the desirable affinity and bioactivity through this vector.",

The sensitivity of rSeCP-ELISA and ES-ELISA was 96.67 % (29/30) and 100 % (30/30) respectively, for the detection of anti-sparganum IgG antibodies in sera of the experimentally infected mice (P > 0.05), and the specificities of both ELISA were 100 % (77/77). In heavily, moderately, and lightly infected mice (five, three, and one larvae per mouse), anti-sparganum antibodies were firstly detected by rSeCP-ELISA at 10-12 days post-infection (dpi), respectively, and then continued to increase with a detection rate of 100 % at 14-22 dpi. In three groups of infected mice, the anti-sparganum antibody levels at different times after infection were statistically different (P < 0.05). The results showed that the rSeCP might be a potential candidate antigen for early and specific serodiagnosis of sparganosis. But, it needs to be further evaluated with sera of the patients with sparganosis and other helminthiasis.",

        "abstract": "To describe the phenotype and molecular characteristics of Vibrio (V.) cholerae strains isolated in Shanghai, from 1962 to 2011.K-B test was used to investigate the antibiotic resistance of V. cholerae strains. PCR was applied to detect seven virulence-related genes including cholera toxin (ctxA), zonula occludens toxin (zot), accessory cholera enterotoxin (ace), hemolysin (hlyA), toxin-coregulated pilus (tcpA) outer membrane protein (ompU) and the regulatory protein genes (toxR). Genetic relation was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and the patterns were clustered by BioNumerics software.V. cholerae strains isolated from 1962 to 1996 were sensitive to most of the antibiotics. However, the strains isolated from 2005 to 2011 were resistant to many antibiotics. V. cholerae O139 group showed higher prevalence of resistance to several antibiotics compared with O1 group, and the resistance rate of the O139 toxigenic isolates was higher than that of the non-toxigenic isolates. Most of the O1 strains isolated from 2005 to 2011 were non-toxigenic while O139 strains isolated from 2005 to 2011 were almost toxigenic. There were no strains of ctxA+ detected from the rivers from 2005 to 2011. Main gene type of the O1 strains detected from the aquatic products was hlyA+ toxR+ ompU+, while that of the O139 strains was hlyA+ toxR+ ompU+ ctxA+ ace+ zot+ tcpA+. Using PFGE, 222 V. cholerae strains were subtyped into 121 molecular types. O139 strains were divided to three clusters and O1 strains to five clusters.The characteristics of V. cholerae strains isolated in Shanghai from 1962 to 2011 showed great changes, suggesting that more attention should be paid to the multiplication on antibiotic resistance of V. cholerae strains.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimeru0027s disease (AD) patients and those with high-risk mild cognitive impairment are increasingly considered to have dysfunction syndromes. Large-scale network studies based on neuroimaging techniques may provide additional insight into AD pathophysiology. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impaired network functional connectivity with the disease progression. For this purpose, we explored altered functional connectivities based on previously well-defined brain areas that comprise the five key functional systems [the default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), control network (CON), salience network (SAL), sensorimotor network (SMN)] in 35 with AD and 27 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, compared with 27 normal cognitive subjects. Based on three levels of analysis, we found that intra-and inter-network connectivity were impaired in AD. Importantly, the interaction between the sensorimotor and attention functions was first attacked at the MCI stage and then extended to the key functional systems in the AD individuals. Lower cognitive ability (lower MMSE scores) was significantly associated with greater reductions in intra-and inter-network connectivity across all patient groups. These profiles indicate that aberrant intra-and inter-network dysfunctions might be potential biomarkers or predictors of AD progression and provide new insight into AD pathophysiology.",

Local diabetic residents meeting inclusion criteria were enrolled into the BCDRT system beginning in 2009. Participants recommended for further in-person examination with ophthalmologists were followed, and the consistencies in diagnoses between BCDRT and ophthalmologists for DR or macular edema were calculated.A total of 471 diabetic residents participated in BCDRT screening in 2009. The proportions of total DR, proliferative DR, and diabetic macular edema were 24.42% (115 patients), 2.12% (10 patients) and 6.47% (24 patients), respectively: 56 patients consulted ophthalmologists for further in-person retinal examination with funduscopy after pupil dilation. High rates of consistency between BCDRT screening and ophthalmologists were observed for macular edema (Kappa = 0.81), moderate or severe non-proliferative DR grade (Kappa = 0.92), and other DR grades (Kappa = 1). A total of 456 (96.82%) patients were willing to participate in the next BCDRT screening.BCDRT was a reliable and valid system for DR screening, and offers the potential to increase DR annual screening rates in local residents.",

        "abstract": "Development of numerical methods for hydraulic fracture simulation has accelerated in the past two decades. Recent advances in hydraulic fracture modeling and simulation are driven by increased industry and research activity in oil and gas, a drive toward consideration of more complex behaviors associated with layered and naturally-fractured rock formations, and a deepening understanding of the underlying mathematical model and its intrinsic challenges. Here we review the basic approaches being employed. Some of these comprise enhancements of classical methods, while others are imported from other fields of mechanics but are completely new in their application to hydraulic fracturing. After a description of the intrinsic challenges associated with the mechanics of fluid-driven fractures, we discuss both continuum and meso-scales numerical methods as well as engineering models which typically make use of additional assumptions to reduce computational cost. We pay particular attention to the verification and validation of numerical models, which is increasingly enabled by an ever-expanding library of laboratory experiments and analytical solutions for simple geometries in a number of different propagation regimes. A number of challenges remain and are amplified with a drive toward fully-coupled, three-dimensional hydraulic fracture modeling that accounts for host-rock heterogeneity. In the context of such a drive to complex models, we argue that the importance of best-practice development that includes careful verification and validation is vital to ensure progress is constrained by the appropriate underlying physics and mathematics with a constant attention to identifying conditions under which simpler models suffice for the intended modeling purposes.",

        "abstract": "To support the emerging next era of mobile wireless networks, researchers have made a great deal of efforts in promising techniques in multimedia services - the statistical quality-of-service (QoS) technique, which has been proved to be effective in statistically guaranteeing delay-bounded video transmissions over the time-varying wireless channels. On the other hand, as one of the 5G-promising techniques, the offloading technique has been demonstrated as the powerful approach to address the data explosion problem, alleviating the congestion in macrocells. Consequently, challenges have been imposed in applying the WiFi offloading scheme for maximizing the effective capacity under QoS constraints. To effectively overcome the above-mentioned challenges, we propose the statistical QoS-driven power allocation scheme through applying the WiFi offloading system over heterogeneous wireless networks. In particular, under the Nakagami-m fading channel model, we establish the communication model for WiFi offloading over heterogeneous wireless networks. Then, we propose the WiFi offloading methods. Given the statistical QoS constraints, we derive and analyze the effective capacity under our developed optimal power-allocation policies for the WiFi offloading scheme over heterogeneous wireless networks. Also conducted is a set of simulations which analyze the performance and the benefits of our proposed WiFi offloading scheme, compared to the schemes without WiFi offloading in terms of effective capacity under statistical QoS constraints over heterogeneous wireless networks.",

        "abstract": "Evidence suggests that biochar is among ideal strategies for climate change mitigation and sustainable agriculture. However, the effects of soil aging on the physicochemical characteristics of biochar and nitrous oxide (NO) production remain elusive. We set up a microcosm experiment with two greenhouse vegetable production (GVP) (alkaline and acid) soils by using the N tracing technique and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to investigate the mechanisms of NO production as affected by fresh (FB) and aged biochar (AB) amendment. The results showed that AB increased the specific surface area, organic C, ammonium sorption capacity and cation exchange capacity, whereas decreased the pore size and pH relative to the FB. Results also demonstrated that FB effectively decreased NO emissions from both soils while it enhanced the abundance of nirK and nosZI genes in alkaline soil and reduced the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) amoA and increased nirK and nosZII genes in acid soil. In contrast, AB significantly stimulated nitrification and denitrification in both soils and thus significantly increased the NO emissions by 43-78%. Furthermore, AB induced increases in ammonia-oxidizing archaeal (AOA) amoA and nirK gene abundances in alkaline soil and fungal nirK gene abundances in acid soil. These results suggest that AB may not be suitable for the mitigation of soil NO emissions in GVP soils thus improving our understanding of the potential mechanism of biochar in NO emissions.",

Polyacrylic acid was adsorbed onto the glass substrate, then picked up at one point of the chain with an AFM tip and stretched. The elongation of individual molecules was recorded as a function of the applied load. In the force curves of PAA, the monotonically rising forces with the elongation of the polymer chain is observed. After normalization according to their contour lengths, all of the force curves can be superimposed together, no difference can be found, indicating that the mechanical properties of polyacrylic acid scale linearly with their lengths. The force-extension curve can be modeled by a modified Langevin Function. It is found that all of the poly(acrylic acid) chains have the same Kuhn length (0.64 ± 0.05 nm) and same segment elasticiy (13000 ± 2000 pN/nm). Both the experimental results and fit results clearly indicate that single polyacrylic acid chain is stretched and nanomechanical properties of single poly (acrylic acid) chain is measured.",

        "abstract": "Regelation, i.e., ice melts under compression and freezes again when the pressure is relieved, remains puzzling since its discovery in 1850's by Faraday. Here we show that hydrogen bond (O:H-O) cooperativity and its extraordinary recoverability resolve this anomaly. The H-O bond and the O:H nonbond possesses each a specific heat eta(x)(T/Theta(Dx)) whose Debye temperature Theta(Dx) is proportional to its characteristic phonon frequency omega(x) according to Einstein's relationship. A superposition of the eta(x)(T/Theta(Dx)) curves for the H-O bond (x = H, omega(H) similar to 3200 cm(-1)) and the O:H nonbond (x = L, omega(L) similar to 200 cm(-1), Theta(DL) = 198 K) yields two intersecting temperatures that define the liquid/quasisolid/solid phase boundaries. Compression shortens the O:H nonbond and stiffens its phonon but does the opposite to the H-O bond through O-O Coulomb repulsion, which closes up the intersection temperatures and hence depress the melting temperature of quasisolid ice. Reproduction of the T-m(P) profile clarifies that the H-O bond energy E-H determines the T-m with derivative of E-H = 3.97 eV for bulk water and ice. Oxygen atom always finds bonding partners to retain its sp3-orbital hybridization once the O:H breaks, which ensures O:H-O bond recoverability to its original state once the pressure is relieved.",

Methods: A retrospective sampling study was given in the local diabetic residents (n = 623), who were enrolled according to the resident health registration archives. NIDEK NU-1000 Non-mydriatic Retinal Camera was used to confirm the diagnosis of DR. Presenting and pinhole visual acuity of both eyes were recorded. Visual impairment was defined by the criteria of WHO. Results: Totally 535 cases were examined with the participating rate of 90.68%, and 146 of them were diagnosed to have DR. There were 17.57% of the diabetic cases had visual acuity < 0.3, which was 25.82% in the DR patients. Twelve eyes (52.2%) were identified as low vision and 14 eyes(60.9%) were identified as blindness in the proliferative stage DR eyes. The vision of proliferative stage DR eyes was lower than that of backgroud stage DR eyes. Conclusion: DR leads to severe vision impairment among the diabetic residents. Diabetic residents should be closely monitored so as to control the prevalence of DR.",

        "abstract": "Objective To assess excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and to examine the main cause of EDS. Methods 96 consecutive PD patients and 98 age-matched healthy controls participated in the study. The severity of the disease was evaluated by Hoehn and Yahr stage (H&Y) and Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale-Ⅲ (UPDRS-Ⅲ), and information of anti-PD medications was collected. The correlations among EDS and age, severity of PD, PQSI score, duration of illness and medications were analyzed. Results The mean ESS score was 6.05 (S.D.3.83) in PD patients and 4.24 (S.D.3.21) in controls (P<0.01). Eighteen patients with PD (18.8%) had an ESS score of 7-9, whereas only six of controls (6.1%) scored 7-9 on ESS(P<0.05). Twenty-two patients with PD were found to have a score ≥10 (21.9%), but only eight in controls (8.2%)(P<0.05). ESS score was correlated with duration of illness(P<0.01), H&Y stage (P<0.01), UPDRS-Ⅲ score (P<0.01), PQSI and levodopa dose (P<0.01). Conclusion EDS was more common in PD patients as compared to controls, it is mainly because of neuropathological changes in the disease itself, sleep disorders during night-time, and anti-parkinsonian drugs.",

Mobilization chemotherapy regimen was COAEP:cyclophosphamide 400 mg/m~2,vindesine 2 mg/m~2,cytosine arabinoside 60 mg/m~2×5 d,etoposide 60 mg/m~2×5 d,and prednisone 30 mg/m~2×5 d.Patients were randomly assigned into experimental group and control group according to the time point of giving G-CSF.In experimental group,G-CSF 300μg/d was given when the number of WBC began to increase stably(second rebound)after rebounding.G-CSF 300μg/d was given in control group when the WBC started to rebound after reaching the nadir.The routine blood cell count was checked daily after giving G-CSF,and CD34+ blood cell was collected by apheresis when peripheral WBC≮10.0×10~9/L,MNC>1.0×10~9/L and immature cells emerged in peripheral WBC.Leukapheresis was performed with COBE blood cell separator using separate MNC process.Results By using the COAEP regimen,an average of 17.25×10~6/kg CD34+ cell was collected. The experimental group used G-CSF for 4.67 days and had 11.73×10~6/kg(geomean)CD34+ cell collected in 1-2 collections;the control group used G-CSF for 5.92 days and had 1.79×10~6/kg(geomean)CD34+ cell collected in 1-2 collections.The difference between the two groups was statistically significant(P<0.0028).Conclusions COAEP was effective as a mobilizing regimen for stem cell collection.Giving G-CSF when WBC began to increase stably(second rebound)could elevate the CD34+ cell yield significantly.Determining the time of harvesting stem cells by the account of peripheral blood WBC and MNC is feasible and could be used in practice.",

        "abstract": "We study the dynamic evolution features of the tectonic deformation of main active faults in the northeastern margin of Qinghai-Tibet Block,the difference between fault segments,and their relationship with the development and occurrence of strong earthquakes,using the strain intensity ratio values calculated from mobile cross-fault short-leveling observational data from the late 1980s to the end of 2007.The results are as follows:① Nearly all strain intensity ratio-time curves of faults or segments reflect the process as\"obviously rising-rising to peak above average line-dropping\" in several months to about one year before the earthquakes with M≥5.8 on the fault (segment) or nearby.The distinct difference of strain intensity ratio between faults or segments has certain prediction significance for the strong earthquakes in the meeting region of faults (segments) or nearby.② The northeastern margin of Qinghai-Tibet Block,especially the Qilianshan-Haiyuan fault zone and the northern margin fault of the West Qinling mountains,shows a new round of energy accumulation through the adjustment of tectonic stress field after the West Kunlun,Yumen,and Minle earthquakes.",

However, the role of TPO/c-MPL signaling in AML (acute myelogenous leukemia) chemotherapy resistance hasn't been fully understood. The c-MPL and TPO levels in different AML samples were measured by flow cytometry and ELISA. We also assessed the TPO levels in the osteoblasts derived from bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The survival rate of an AML cell line that had been co-cultured with different BMSC-derived osteoblasts was measured to determine the IC50 of an AML chemotherapy drug daunorubicin (DNR). The levels of TPO/c-MPL in the initial and relapse AML patients were significantly higher than that in the control (P < 0.05). The osteoblasts derived from AML patients' BMSCs secreted more TPO than the osteoblasts derived from normal control BMSCs (P < 0.05). A strong positive correlation between the TPO level and c-MPL expression was found in the bone marrow mononuclear cells of the relapse AML patients. More importantly, the IC50 of DNR in the HEL + AML-derived osteoblasts was the highest among all co-culture systems. High level of TPO/c-MPL signaling may protect LSCs from chemotherapy in AML. The effects of inhibition of the TPO/c-MPL pathway on enhancing the chemotherapy sensitivity of AML cells, and on their downstream effector molecules that direct the interactions between patient-derived blasts and leukemia repopulating cells need to be further studied.",

The level of mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF-R₂) and integrin αV was detected by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The BALB/c mice were immuned with DC loading bEnd.3 antigen 4 times in 4 weeks (bEnd.3-DC group), while the mice only were immuned with DC or injected with phosphate buffer saline (PBS group) as control group. One week after last vaccination, U14 cervical cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into the mice. The tumor size, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response of spleen lymphocytes in vitro, the percentage of CD₃+CD₈+ surface markers of spleen lymphocytes, and the titer of serum antibody were detected. The specific immunity was examined by immunocytochemistry and western blot.The expression of VEGF-R₂ and integrin αV gene in bEnd.3 cells were expressed highly. After the vaccine was injected, the tumors of mice in PBS group grew faster than those in other groups, while the tumors in bEnd.3-DC group grew slowly and disappeared after 2 weeks. The volume of tumors in DC group grew slower than those in PBS group [(0.11 ± 0.13) cm³ versus (3.38 ± 0.34) cm³]. The CTL response of spleen lymphocytes in vitro showed that bEnd.3-DC cells could kill bEnd.3 cells, the special lysis rate was more than 60%. The percentage of CD₃+CD₈+ spleen lymphocytes in bEnd.3-DC group [(38.6 ± 0.7)%] was higher than those in other groups (P < 0.05). The titer of serum antibody of bEnd.3-DC group was 1:3200, while it was 1:800 in DC group and there were not any in PBS group. Immunocytochemistry analysis indicated there were specific antigen-antibody reaction to bEnd.3 cell in bEnd.3-DC group. Western blot analysis revealed that there were specific bands at 220,000 (VEGF-R₂).bEnd.3-DC vaccine can inhibit the tumor growth of U14 cervical cancer cell of mice, which indicates that the special cellular and humoral immunity are induced by bEnd.3-DC antigen which maybe have some antigens in bEnd.3 cells that reacts with endothelial cell proliferation-related antigens.",

        "abstract": "Corticosteroid therapy followed by splenectomy for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is the standard practice. Rituximab is mostly used in patients with chronic refractory ITP who have failed multiple previous treatments, including splenectomy.We explored the potential role of rituximab as an early therapeutic option for patients with corticosteroid-resistant ITP who preferred to avoid splenectomy in favor of other treatment.Twenty-five patients with corticosteroid-resistant ITP were treated with rituximab between May 1, 2009, and June 30, 2012, at a single center. Rituximab was administered at 100 mg/m(2) on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. The response to rituximab therapy and adverse effects were observed.Complete remission was achieved in 19 patients (76%), partial remission in 3 patients (12%), and minimal response in none of the patients; 1 patient was considered a treatment failure (4%). Two patients (8%) were lost to follow-up. Twenty-two patients (88%) achieved a platelet count >50 × 10(9)/L. The median time from administration of the first rituximab dose to partial remission was 2 months (range, 0.7-3 months) for all the patients. Response classified as sustained was achieved in 21 patients (84%). No serious adverse effects were observed during rituximab therapy.Rituximab therapy is effective and safe for patients with corticosteroid-resistant ITP before splenectomy, resulting in high complete remission and overall response rates. A multicenter study with a larger sample should be performed to further explore the role of rituximab therapy.",

These MAC protocols should be able to adapt to varying application requirements and deployment conditions. In this paper, we present a component based scheme for enabling fast prototyping of MAC protocols using a lightweight tool chain. Our tool chain allows run-time MAC protocol reconfiguration by controlling the data path and the execution flow of the constituent components. Our approach of composing protocols based on common MAC components aims at reducing the protocol prototyping efforts. Moreover, our toolchain implemented for various sensor nodes provides a platform independent MAC meta-language which simplifies the protocol designing, testing and debugging processes. Empirical tests conducted on commercially available sensor nodes show that our approach enables run-time reconfiguration for MAC protocols with affordable memory consumption and execution overhead.",

        "title": "Engineered chimeric peptides with antimicrobial and titanium-binding functions to inhibit biofilm formation on Ti implants.",
        "abstract": "Titanium (Ti) implants have been commonly used in oral medicine. However, despite their widespread clinical application, these implants are susceptible to failure induced by microbial infection due to bacterial biofilm formation. Immobilization of chimeric peptides with antibacterial properties on the Ti surface may be a promising antimicrobial approach to inhibit biofilm formation. Here, chimeric peptides were designed by connecting three sequences (hBD-3-1/2/3) derived from human β-defensin-3 (hBD-3) with Ti-binding peptide-l (TBP-l: RKLPDAGPMHTW) via a triple glycine (G) linker to modify Ti surfaces. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the properties of individual domains of the chimeric peptides were evaluated for their binding activity toward the Ti surface. The antimicrobial and anti-biofilm efficacy of the peptides against initial settlers, Streptococcus oralis (S. oralis), Streptococcus gordonii (S. gordonii) and Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis), was evaluated with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to study cell membrane changes and the underlying antimicrobial mechanism. Compared with the other two peptides, TBP-1-GGG-hBD3-3 presented stronger antibacterial activity and remained stable in saliva and serum. Therefore, it was chosen as the best candidate to modify Ti surfaces in this study. This peptide inhibited the growth of initial streptococci and biofilm formation on Ti surfaces with no cytotoxicity to MC3T3-E1 cells. Disruption of the integrity of bacterial membranes and decreased expression of adhesion protein genes from S. gordonii revealed aspects of the antibacterial mechanism of TBP-1-GGG-hBD3-3. We conclude that engineered chimeric peptides with antimicrobial activity provide a potential solution for inhibiting biofilm formation on Ti surfaces to reduce or prevent the occurrence of peri-implant diseases.",

The investigation results show this acid system has good properties in shear stability, corrosion inhibition, and retarded reaction. The viscosity of the system will decrease with the temperature. The viscosity of the viscous acid (4%FL4-22+2% FL4-22A+20%HCl+2% corrosion inhibitor FL4-22B) is up to 25 mPa·s at 90℃, the viscosity will increase then decrease when reacting with formation rocks. So the residual acid with low viscosity can be flowed back very easily. This new acid system can be applied in acidizing treatment of carbonate formations.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the therapeutic effect of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT) in combination with rituximab in treatment of CD20+ B cellulous non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL). Methods Sixty patients with CD20+ aggressive or refractory and recurrent B-NHL and treated with APBSCT in our department from Jan. 2005 to Jan. 2011 were admitted. All the subjects were divided into 2 groups according to their own choice: 25 patients received rituximab treatment (treatment group) and 35 patients were treated without rituximab treatment (control group). All patients underwent chemotherapy and APBSCT. For patients in treatment group, rituximab was used with CHOP before collecting the stem cells and after the transplantation. After transplantation, rituximab and IL-2 were used in treatment group every 3-6 months as maintenance treatment. Results No side effect was observed during the use of rituximab either before or after transplantation. The mononuclear cell count in treatment and control group was (8.2±2.9)×108/kg and (8.4±3.9)×108/kg (P=0.822), respectively; CD34+ cell count was (12.3±12.7)×106/kg and (13.2±13.9)×106/kg (P=0.799), respectively. Haemopoiesis reconstruction was successfully achieved in the patients of treatment group, while 3 patients in control group failed to have haemopoiesis reconstruction. No significant difference was found between two groups on the recovery time of neutrophilic granulocytes and platelets. All patients achieved complete remission. The average follow-up time was 22 months. The disease relapsed in two patients in treatment group and six in control group. The 3-year overall survival rate in treatment group (91.6%) was a little higher than that in control group (69.5%, P=0.060). Conclusion To patients of CD20+ B lymphoma, the use of rituximab shows no side effect before or after collection of stem cell and hemopoiesis reconstruction, and the overall survival rate may be improved.",

        "abstract": "Time-slotted, which means that primary users only change their status (active or not active) at the start of each secondary frame, has been considered as a common assumption in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). However, in realistic cases, primary users are non-time-slotted, which means primary users can be active or not active at any time during the whole secondary frame duration. In not-time-slotted CRNs, it is difficult to obtain good performance by using the traditional half duplex spectrum sensing scheme. In this paper, we propose a novel full duplex spectrum sensing scheme for non-time-slotted CRNs. We derive the probability of detection and the probability of false alarm with random arrival/departure of primary users' traffic and develop a continuous time Markov chain model for non-time-slotted CRNs. We analyze the effect of bandwidth, antennas placement error, and transmit signal amplitude difference on the performance of non-time-slotted CRNs. Numerical results show that the bandwidth, which is the most unavoidable imperfect factor, has little impact on performance of non-time-slotted CRNs. Therefore, the full duplex spectrum sensing scheme can be effectively used in wideband CRNs.",

        "abstract": "Myeloma bone disease (MBD) is one of the clinical features of multiple myeloma, which contributes to the attenuation of osteoblast function. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells exhibit a high potential for differentiation into osteoblasts. A number of studies have reported that microRNAs (miRs) serve a vital role in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) osteogenesis; however, the role of miR-221-5p in the osteogenic differentiation of MBD-MSCs remains unclear. The present study revealed that the osteogenic differentiation capacity of MBD-MSCs was reduced compared with that of normal (N)-MSCs. Further experiments demonstrated that miR-221-5p expression was downregulated in N-MSCs following osteoblast induction while no obvious alterations in expression levels were observed in MBD-MSCs. The inhibition of miR-221-5p promoted the osteogenic differentiation of MBD-MSCs. Bioinformatics, luciferase reporter assays, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting assays indicated that smad family member 3 (smad3) was a direct target of miR-221-5p in MBD-MSCs. A negative association was identified between the expression levels of smad3 and miR-221-5p. Investigations of the molecular mechanism indicated that suppressed miR-221-5p could regulate the osteogenic differentiation of MBD-MSCs by upregulating smad3 expression. It was also identified that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was activated following miR-221-5p inhibition, and this increased the osteogenic differentiation capacity of MBD-MSCs. The present study may improve the understanding regarding the role of miR-221-5p in the regulation of osteogenic differentiation, and may contribute to the development of a novel therapy for MBD.",

        "abstract": "Two ophiolitic m��lange belts, the South Central Tianshan Ophiolite Belt (SCTOB) and the South Tianshan Ophiolite Belt (STOB), extend almost parallel to the Chinese South Tianshan Orogen - the southernmost part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). The SCTOB occurs interlayered in the South Central Tianshan Suture Zone, the STOB as exotic blocks in Palaeozoic sedimentary strata. However, their tectonic settings and ages, which are crucial for understanding the formation of the CAOB, are still controversially discussed. In order to better understand these geological problems, geological, geochemical and geochronological investigations were conducted on the Guluogou (SCTOB) as well as on the Serikeyayilake and Aertengkesi ophiolitic m��langes (STOB). The ophiolitic suites are composed of basalts, gabbros and mantle peridotites. Laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) U-Pb zircon ages of 334. ��. 5. Ma and 332. ��. 7. Ma were obtained for the Guluogou gabbros, while SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages of 423. ��. 10. Ma and 423. ��. 4. Ma were determined for the Serikeyayilake and Aertengkesi gabbros. The mineral composition of the mantle peridotites and the geochemical characteristics of the basalts suggest a mid-ocean ridge (MOR) type affinity for the Guluogou ophiolite and a SSZ type affinity for the Serikeyayilake and Aertengkesi ophiolites. The present data, combined with previously published results, indicate that the STOB may have been derived from a forearc rifting setting that existed during the early Silurian to the early Carboniferous (ca. 439-356. Ma), whereas the SCTOB may represent fragments of a normal wide ocean that lasted to the early Carboniferous (ca. 332. Ma). ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Multiple hydraulic fractures have been proposed for improving the performance of an enhanced geothermal system (EGS) by providing conductive flow pathways and increased contact area between flowing fluid and surrounding rock formation. Use of more fractures incurs a higher drilling and hydraulic fracturing cost, but the additional cost can be offset by improved operation performance of an EGS. In this paper, a model is presented for efficiently predicting the output temperature so as to optimize the number of fractures and fracture spacing to maximize the EGS lifetime under a constant circulation rate. This optimal spacing is shown to arise due to the interplay among number of fractures, fracture spacing, well depth, and the pre-existing geothermal gradient. Specifically, under a typical geothermal gradient associated with EGS for a 5km total vertical depth of the well, the number of fractures N and the equal fracture spacing d have optimal values: 6⩽N⩽13 and 30m⩽d⩽90m. In addition, the semi-analytical solution method presented is effective and efficient in computation and, for this reason, is useful for optimizing the design of a geothermal reservoir with multiple layers at equal or non-equal spacing.",

The associations between each potential risk factor and the outcomes were studied.In total, 778 participants were enrolled. There were 322 patients without DR at baseline, of which 151 participants developed DR during follow-up (DR incidence rate = 46.89%). Baseline hyperglycemia and high blood pressure were two independent risk factors associated with DR incidence. Among the 456 participants with existing DR at entry, 110 fully recovered after 5 years (DR regression rate = 24.12%). Low baseline glucose and low serum triglyceride were two independent factors associated with DR regression.DR incidence occurred more frequently in patients with hyperglycemia and high blood pressure.

        "abstract": "By enabling two adjacent mobile devices to establish a direct link, device-to-device (D2D) communication can increase the system throughput over underlaying wireless networks, where D2D and cellular communications coexist to share the same radio resource. Traditional D2D schemes mainly focus on maximizing the system throughput without taking into account the quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning. To overcome this problem, we develop a framework to investigate the impact of delay-QoS requirement on the performance of D2D and cellular communications in underlaying wireless networks. Then, we propose the optimal power allocation schemes with statistical QoS provisioning for the following two channel modes: 1). co-channel mode based underlaying wireless networks where D2D devices and cellular devices share the same frequency-time resource; 2). orthogonal-channel mode based underlaying wireless networks where the frequency-time resource is partitioned into two parts for D2D devices and cellular devices, respectively. Applying our proposed optimal power allocations into D2D based underlaying wireless networks, we obtain the maximum network throughput subject to a given delay-QoS constraint for above-mentioned two underlaying wireless network modes, respectively. Also conducted is a set of numerical and simulation results to evaluate our proposed QoS-driven power allocation schemes under different delay-QoS requirements.",

        "abstract": "To save the precious wireless resources in wireless networks, we investigate cross-layer optimization schemes to reduce wireless resource consumption (WRC) for reliable mobile multicast. We characterize WRC by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per information bit and by power-delay product for scenarios without and with delay quality of service (QoS) constraints, respectively. Aiming at decreasing WRC, we develop a cross-layer parameter-selection (CLPS) algorithm, which dynamically adjusts the parameters of the physical layer and the medium access control (MAC) layer according to the variations of multicast group size, transport-layer error-control parameters, and delay QoS constraints. In particular, we first derive the optimal physical-layer parameters, including constellation size and transmit SNR, to minimize WRC for Threshold-0 multicast policy, where the sender transmits data regardless of channel qualities. Then, we develop a suboptimal approach for the selection of MAC-layer multicast threshold to achieve low power-delay product. In addition, we study the effects of pure automatic repeat request (ARQ) and hybrid ARQ-forward error correction (FEC) based error-control schemes on the CLPS algorithm. Also conducted is a set of numerical analyses to show the performance gain achieved through the cross-layer design and the impacts of various system parameters on the WRC optimization",

Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra demonstrated that monolayer Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film could be directly obtained at surface pressure 5 mN m −1 by depositing the complex with one of its hexadecoic acid molecules lost due to decomposition of hydrogen bond. For the self-assembled monolayer, SERS spectra indicated that during self-assembling process, only one part of the complex was adsorbed on silver substrate, just similar to that occurring at air/water interface due to the same reason. Increasing the molar ratio of the hexadecoic acid to the mole of 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene in the complex solution up to 16-fold, we successfully prepared a monolayer of the complex without decomposition. Under this condition the 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)-ethylene was inferred to adopt the adsorption flat on the substrate.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in residents aged ≥60 years in Beixinjing Community of Shanghai. Methods: The prevalence and related factors of AMD in residents aged ≥60 years in Beixinjing Community of Shanghai were investigated between November 2007 and April 2008 with cluster sampling. An interview concerning general data, history of diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases, daily living visual acuity and corrected visual acuity was carried out. Basic eye examination was performed, and 2 photographs covering 45° of posterior eye fundus area were acquired in each eye with fundus camera. The diagnosis of AMD was made by two or more ophthalmologists, and the classification of AMD was based on the criteria from Chinese Eye Fundus Diseases Group. Results: A total of 4 153 residents were included, and 3571 finished examinations, with the examination rate of 85.99%. Four hundred and seventy-seven patients (778 eyes) were diagnosed as AMD, accounting for 13.36% of the residents finishing examinations. Sixty-four patients (85 eyes) were diagnosed as exudative AMD, occupying 1.79% of the residents finishing examinations. The prevalences of AMD in the age groups of 60-69, 70-79 and no less than 80 were 6.23%, 14.98%, and29.91%, respectively, with significant differences (χ 2=169.40, P<0.01). The prevalences of AMD in the education groups of illiterate, primary school, middle school, and higher than middle school were 15.2%, 18.75%, 9.36% and 8. 22%, respectively, with significant differences (χ 2=59.56, P<0.01). There was no significant difference in the prevalences of AMD between males and females (χ 2=0.03, P>0.05). In eyes of AMD, 3.08% and 18.51 % were identified as blind or low vision. In eyes of exudative AMD, 15.29% and 32.95% were identified as blind or low vision, which were higher than those in eyes of atrophic AMD (1.59% and 16.73%). Conclusion: The prevalence of AMD increases with age, and decreases with education level. AMD may lead to severe visual acuity impairment.",

        "abstract": "Multivalency is important in molecular self-assembly, although it remains a challenge to correlate the single-molecule results with the multivalent interaction. As the first example, we have combined a well-defined self-assembling system with AFM-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) to investigate the intermolecular interactions and multivalency between C(60) and porphyrin derivatives. Compared with the interaction between C(60) and a single porphyrin (29 pN), SMFS has revealed that porphyrin tweezers can provide an enhanced binding interaction with C(60), resulting in a more than 2-fold higher unbinding force (75 pN, at the same loading rate). In addition, a much lower dissociation rate and a shorter effective distance between the bound state and transition state of the interaction are indicated by dynamic force spectroscopy. These results provide new quantitative information on the divalency effect in the unbinding process of C(60) and porphyrin tweezers at the single-molecule level, which is of significance in understanding the strength of the multivalency in the molecular assembly.",

Ultrathin organic films were prepared by successively amidation of the amino terminated surface with dimethyl terephthalate to give an ester terminated surface, amidation of the obtained ester terminated surface with ethylenediamine to give an amino terminated surface, Michael addition of methyl acrylate to the amino terminated surface to produce an ester terminated surface, and then amidation of the obtained ester terminated surface with ethylenediamine to produce an amino terminated surface again. The dendritic multilayer film was obtained by repeating the above processes. The introduction of phenyl rings make it possible for monitoring the film growth with UV-Vis spectra.

Results When the Jurkat cells were cocultured with BMSCs for 24 h, the Jurkat cells adhered to the matrix cell layer by parapodium and some of Jurkat cells had niched the mesh formed by the confluence of BMSCs; at 48 h, some Jurkat cells had migrated to underlayer of BMSCs and were packaged, and Jurkat cells like nest niched the mesh of BMSCs. The accumulation and distribution of DNR in Jurkat cells were not affected in the model, but the apoptosis induced by DNR and the reaction of Jurkat cells to DNR were significantly inhibited. Conclusion The model of CAM-DR was successfully built, laying the foundation for further study on the mechanism of drug resistance of leukemia from a new viewpoint.",

Although several prior studies explained this relationship from economic perspectives, recent empirical studies find inconsistent results with different behavioural perspectives. One important reason is that most studies examine this relationship in one special organisational environment. This study used cross-sectional data with almost 100 respondents from more than ten organisations in different fields. In this study, we examined the impact of individual value and organisational context on reward-knowledge sharing relationship. The findings support the hypotheses that with cross-sectional data, personal perception of knowledge sharing visibility is the critical factor by contributing the most R square change.",

Methods A total of 92 patients with monocular RRD were asked to complete the Chinese-version low vision quality of life questionnaire (CLVQOL) preoperatively and at the end of the follow-up time. Results The Cronbach α coefficient of the questionnaire was more than 0.7. The lowest scores were at the item of \"adjustive ability\" before the surgery, and the scores of the questionnaires were significantly higher at the end of the follow-up time. The item whose score changed most caused by the surgery was \"adjustive ability\". The visual acuity in RRD eyes before the operation and the changes of the visual acuity was the chief independent risk factor of the questionnaire score before surgery and the changes of scores due to surgery, respectively. Conclusions CLVQOL can be used to assess the VRQoL of patients with monocular RRD after surgery. The qualities of life of patients with monocular RRD decrease sharply. VRQoL, especially the adjustive ability, improves obviously after operation, but the patient would be inconvenient for doing some precision work or daily house work. Improving the visual acuity of the RRD eye, giving early surgery and avoiding complications help to improve the VRQoL of the patients with monocular RRD.",

The results showed that pore making agent(CHCl_3) can increase the porosity of the resin.The most effective synthetic conditions for the resin with the highest oil absorption capacity were:m(MMA): m(BMA)=1:1,w(DVB)=0.5%,w(BPO)=1.0%,w(CHCl_3)=50%.The absorption capacity of the resin in CHCl_3 was 13.9 g/g.The pervasion of CHCl_3 into the oil absorption resin was Non-Fickian diffusion,and the swelling dynamic equation of the oil absorption resin could be expressed as (W_t=1)/13.5=0.081 8t~(0.924).",

        "abstract": "As the fourth-generation (4G) standards have been successfully deployed in all 4G-based wireless communication industries and mobile devices, research attention and the efforts of academia and industry have already moved onto fifth-generation (5G) technologies. While the frequency-division duplexing (FDD) and timedivision duplexing (TDD) are widely used in 4G mobile wireless networks, they have their inherent deficiencies of low spectrum efficiency because FDD and TDD are both based on the half-duplex transmission mode. To overcome these problems existing in 4G systems, in this article we propose novel wireless full-duplex transmission schemes in both the PHY and MAC layers for 5G mobile wireless networks to significantly increase the spectrum efficiency. In particular, we first develop the wireless fullduplex model for both bidirectional transmission and unidirectional transmission, respectively, taking into account self-interference mitigation. Then we analyze the traditional half-duplex FDD and TDD modes and show the superiority of the wireless full-duplex mode over the halfduplex FDD and TDD modes, respectively. Using our developed wireless full-duplex model, we develop and evaluate the efficient full-duplex power allocation scheme at the PHY layer. Corresponding to full-duplex transmission at the PHY layer, we also develop and analyze the fullduplex MAC protocol at the MAC layer to implement full-duplex transmission over the entire 5G mobile wireless network architecture. Through simulation experiments we show that our proposed schemes can significantly enhance spectrum efficiency for 5G mobile wireless networks.",

Firstly we divide the main fault area into certain deformation units; then derive the geometric deformation and relative dislocation parameters of each unit; and finally quantitatively estimate the slip and strain rates in each segment of the rupture zone. Furthermore, by comparing the consistency of deformation in all segments of the whole rupture zone, we can determine the possible a-nomalous segments as well as their properties and amplitudes. In analyzing the east boundaries of Sichuan-Yunnan block with reference to the GPS velocity data in the period of 1991-2001, we have discovered that the Mianning-Ningnan-Dongchuan segment on the Zemuhe-Xiaojiang fault zone is relatively locked and the left-lateral shear strain rate here is higher.",

        "abstract": "Making full use of crustal deformation data obtained from GPS,regional leveling and cross-fault means,aided by the inversion of negative dislocation,and combined with seismic activities,the authors studied the influence of the Ms8.1 Kunlun Mountains Great Earthquake of November 14,2001 on the crustal movement and strain accumulation in the northeastern margin of Qinghai-Xizang block.The result shows that it was the adjustment action of disturbance stress field caused by this enormous seismic energy releasing inside Qinghai-Xizang block in the northeastward compressional background field that led to the variation of the crustal difference movement and the stress-strain state in the block boundary.To some extent and for a period of time,the action mainly found expression in the reduction of strain accumulation in the eastern segment of the Altyn Tagh fault and the western segment of the Qilian Mountain fracture zone,and in the promotion of strain accumulation in the middle-eastern segments of the Qilian Mountain fracture zone.Presently the regional stress field of the study area reflects the recovering state after the Kunlun Mountains,Yumen and Minle earthquakes.Moreover,based on limited data obtained from GPS,short-leveling and cross-fault means after the Wenchuan Earthquake of May 12,2008,the authors consider that the Wenchuan Earthquake promoted the strain accumulation in the eastern segment of the Gansu-Sichuan boundary as well as along the Gansu-Sichuan-Shaanxi boundary.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the power allocation problems for non-orthogonal multiple access with coordinated direct and relay transmission (CDRT-NOMA), where a base station (BS) communicates with its nearby user directly, while communicating with its far user only through a dedicated relay node (RN). The RN is assumed to operate in either half-duplex relaying (HDR) mode or full-duplex relaying (FDR) mode. Based on instantaneous channel state information (CSI), the dynamic power allocation problems under HDR and FDR schemes are formulated respectively, with the objective of maximizing the minimum user achievable rate. After demonstrating the quasi-concavity of the considered problems, we derive the optimal closed-form power allocation policies under the HDR scheme and the FDR scheme. Then, a hybrid relaying scheme dynamically switching between HDR and FDR schemes is further designed. Moreover, we also study the fixed power allocation problems for the considered CDRT-NOMA systems based on statistical CSI so as to optimize the long-term system performance. The simulations show that our proposed power allocation policies can significantly enhance the performance of CDRT-NOMA systems.",

        "abstract": "Superlubricity means non-sticky and frictionless when two bodies are set contacting motion. Although this occurrence has been extensively investigated since 1859 when Faraday firstly proposed a quasiliquid skin on ice, the mechanism behind the superlubricity remains uncertain. This report features a consistent understanding of the superlubricity pertaining to the slipperiness of ice, self-lubrication of dry solids, and aqueous lubricancy from the perspective of skin bond-electron-phonon adaptive relaxation. The presence of nonbonding electron polarization, atomic or molecular undercoordination, and solute ionic electrification of the hydrogen bond as an addition, ensures the superlubricity. Nonbond vibration creates soft phonons of high magnitude and low frequency with extraordinary adaptivity and recoverability of deformation. Molecular undercoordination shortens the covalent bond with local charge densification, which in turn polarizes the nonbonding electrons making them localized dipoles. The locally pinned dipoles provide force opposing contact, mimicking magnetic levitation and hovercraft. O: H-O bond electrification by aqueous ions has the same effect of molecular undercoordination but it is throughout the entire body of the lubricant. Such a Coulomb repulsivity due to the negatively charged skins and elastic adaptivity due to soft nonbonding phonons of one of the contacting objects not only lowers the effective contacting force but also prevents charge from being transited between the counterparts of the contact. Consistency between theory predictions and observations evidences the validity of the proposal of interface elastic Coulomb repulsion that serves as the rule for the superlubricity of ice, wet and dry frictions, which also reconciles the superhydrophobicity, superlubricity, and supersolidity at contacts.",

They have been shown previously not only to be non-immunogenic but also to exert immunosuppressive effects on xenogenic T cells in vitro. This study investigated the role of hUCBDSC in immunomodulation in an acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) mouse model after haplo-identical stem cell transplantation.Acute GvHD was induced in recipient (B6 × BALB/c)F(1) mice by irradiation (750 cGy) followed by infusion of bone marrow cells and splenocytes from donor C57BL/6 mice. hUCBDSC were co-transplanted in the experimental group. The survival time, body weight and clinical and histopathologic scores were recorded after transplantation. The expression of surface markers [major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I, MHC II, CD80 and CD86] on CD11c(+) dendritic cells (DC), and the percentage of CD4(+) regulatory T cells (Treg), in the spleens of recipient mice were examined by flow cytometry.The survival time was significantly prolonged, and the clinical and histopathologic scores were reduced in mice co-transplanted with hUCBDSC. The expression levels of the surface markers on DC were significantly lower in mice transplanted with hUCBDSC compared with those without. The proportion of CD4(+) Treg in the spleen was also increased in mice transplanted with hUCBDSC.These results from a GvHD mouse model are in agreement with previous in vitro findings, suggesting that hUCBDSC possess immunosuppressive properties and may act via influencing DC and CD4(+) Treg.",

        "abstract": "Spirometra erinaceieuropaei cysteine protease (SeCP) in sparganum ES proteins recognized by early infection sera was identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. The aim of this study was to predict the structures and functions of SeCP protein by using the full length cDNA sequence of SeCP gene with online sites and software programs. The SeCP gene sequence was of 1 053 bp length with a 1011 bp biggest ORF encoding 336-amino acid protein with a complete cathepsin propeptide inhibitor domain and a peptidase C1A conserved domain. The predicted molecular weight and isoelectric point of SeCP were 37.87 kDa and 6.47, respectively. The SeCP has a signal peptide site and no transmembrane domain, located outside the membrane. The secondary structure of SeCP contained 8 α-helixes, 7 β-strands, and 20 coils. The SeCP had 15 potential antigenic epitopes and 19 HLA-I restricted epitopes. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of SeCP, S. erinaceieuropaei has the closest evolutionary status with S. mansonoides. SeCP was a kind of proteolytic enzyme with a variety of biological functions and its antigenic epitopes could provide important insights on the diagnostic antigens and target molecular of antisparganum drugs. © 2013 Li Na Liu et al.",

The graft polymers were confirmed by the absorption of carbonyl groups in the FTIR spectra. The decreasing phenolic group's content (Ph-OH) is not only due to its participation as grafting site but also to the negative effect of initiator. In the initial period (0-60 min), HLS and SLS both accelerate the polymerization of AA. Additionally, Ph-OH group's content is proportional to product yield (Y%), monomer conversion (C%) and grafting efficiency (GE%), strongly indicating that it acts as active center. Nevertheless, compared with HLS, Y% and C% in SLS grafting system are lower though it has higher Ph-OH group's content, which is due to the quinonoid structure formed by the self-conjugated of phenoxy radical in Guaiacyl unit. Finally, the lignosulfonate grafting mechanism was proposed.",

Consistency between density functional theory calculations and electron cyclotron resonance experiments verified that: (1) Multi-layer armchair nanoribbons are stable with proper amounts of excess electrons which can provide net spin; (2) Since under-coordination induces lattice relaxation and potential well modulation, electrons tend to be trapped at edges; and (3) Neither large amount of excess electrons nor positive charges can induce magnetism.

        "abstract": "In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), deterministic placement of sensors can achieve low cost, high quality in coverage and connectivity. Most existing works assume that the monitoring area is infinite or large enough so that the boundary effect can be ignored, which in practice leads to coverage holes. In order to detect and eliminate the boundary effect, extra deployment work is required which leads to high cost in human resources, materials and time. In this paper, we propose a growth rings like deployment (GRLD) scheme to achieve both coverage and connectivity without boundary effects. GRLD is designed to be suitable for different relationships of the communication radius and sensing radius of sensors. We prove that GRLD can guarantee full coverage of the area and connectivity of the network. Sensor density of GRLD is derived in theory to assess its efficiency and the accuracy is verified by simulation results. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate GRLD's performance compared with existing popular deployment patterns, in terms of sensor density, efficiency on eliminating boundary effects and flexibility to different relationships of the communication radius and sensing radius of sensors. ©2013 Old City Publishing, Inc.",

Most of the reported cases were caused by , occurring in the old world, particularly in Asian and European countries.  and  have rarely been reported infecting humans in North America.  has long been called the oriental eye worm, referring to its traditional distribution across eastern and southeastern Asia (i.e., China, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, and India) where infection is endemic in animals and humans, usually in poorer rural areas and mainly among children and the elderly. The identification of the parasite was mainly based on the characteristics of oral and genital organs. In Asia and Europe, vectors for this nematode are male  and  drosophilids respectively, which feed on ocular secretions of hosts and transmit infective stage larvae to domestic and wild carnivores, lagomorphs, and humans. China probably has the largest number of cases with thelaziasis in the world, and lots of cases have been existed in other Asian countries such as Japan and Korea. Although a few of human cases have been reported, there were high infection rates of wild animals and domesticated dogs and cats in most of European countries. Based on the 1 gene, a total of 21 haplotypes were identified in the samples from worldwide, in which, one circulated only in European countries (h1), while the other 20 haplotypes were distributed in Korea, Japan and China. In general, the Chinese clinical isolates of  expressed high genetic diversity. The population differences between Europe and Asian countries were greater than those among China, Korea and Japan. The  populations from Europe and Asia should be divided into two separate sub-populations. These two groups started to diverge during the middle Pleistocene.",

        "abstract": "We chose hepcidin and its related factors as evaluating indicators to determine the degrees of iron overload in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients. A total of 73 patients and 28 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. We performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure both bone marrow and peripheral blood serum hepcidin. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the gene expression of growth differentiation factor 15 and twisted gastrulation 1. Serum ferritin (SF), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythropoietin were measured by routine standard laboratory assays. CD4(+) and CD19(+) lymphocytes and Th polarization were detected by flow cytometry. Twenty-four MDS patients were measured their cardiac and liver iron deposition levels through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2* examination. No significant difference was found between the bone marrow hepcidin levels and peripheral blood hepcidin levels (P = 0.134). Stratified according to different World Health Organization subtypes, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts patients had the lowest hepcidin levels (105.40 ± 5.13 ng/ml), while refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 had the highest levels (335.71 ± 25.16 ng/ml). Stratified according to International Prognostic Scoring System and WHO Classification-based Prognostic Scoring System, there was a significant difference of hepcidin levels between low-risk group and high-risk group in two systems, respectively (P = 0.033 and 0.009). The hepcidin levels of CD4(+) high-expression group were demonstrated higher than the normal expression groups (P = 0.02), but the CD19(+) high-expression group did not show the same result (P = 0.206). Meanwhile, patients with a Th1 polarization trend had a high level of hepcidin versus normal group (P < 0.001). Liver iron concentration (LIC) measured by MRI T2* had a closer correlation (r = 0.582, P < 0.001) to hepcidin than serum ferritin, by stepwise regression. C-reactive protein and LIC seemed to be the key determinants of hepcidin, by multivariate regression. Inflammation plays an important role in the regulation of hepcidin expression. T-lymphocyte activation and Th polarization trend might participate in the regulatory mechanism partly. The capability of organ iron load assessment of MRI T2* seems better than that of SF. It seems that hepcidin with CRP and LIC measured by MRI T2* are potential indicators of iron overload in MDS patients.",

        "abstract": "A ca. 600m-long, 0.5-20m-wide NW-SE trending granite dike crosscuts the high pressure-low temperature (HP-LT) Tianshan metamorphic belt, the foliation of which is parallel to the main ENE regional trend in the Chinese South Tianshan Orogen. It is mainly composed of plagioclase, K-feldspar, quartz, muscovite, biotite and secondary chlorite, while fluorite, zircon and xenotime occur as accessories. The immediate country rock is a quartz-biotite-plagioclase schist, which grades several tens of meters away from the granite dike into a chlorite-mica-albite schist. The latter schist is intimately intercalated with blueschist layers and boudins. The A/CNK value of the granite dike samples varies from 1.15 to 1.27 indicating a strongly peraluminous composition. CaO/Na2O ranges from 0.06 to 0.17 and Al2O3/TiO2 from 240 to 525, similar to the ratios of strongly peraluminous (SP) granites exposed in 'high-pressure' collision zones such as the Himalayas. A zircon U-Pb age of 285Ma was obtained for the granite dike, thus constraining the upper limit for the age of HP-LT metamorphism. The petrological and geochemical data suggest that the SP leucogranite dike intruded during the exhumation of overthickened crust in the post-collisional setting between the Yili (-Central Tianshan) and Tarim blocks. The dataset presented here in conjunction with previously published data corroborate that the HP-LT metamorphism must have occurred earlier than the Permian in the Tianshan Orogen. Therefore, the collision between the Yili (-Central Tianshan) and Tarim blocks and the final amalgamation of the Southwestern Altaids must have been terminated in Late Paleozoic and not in Triassic times as previously suggested. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "The effects of interfacial debonding and sliding on fracture characterisation of unidirectional fibre-reinforced composites are studied numerically under plane strain and small-scale bridging conditions. To account for the importance of fiber architecture, the fracture process zone (FPZ) characterised by discrete embedded reinforcement and cracking matrix, is of discontinuous bridging stresses. A bi-linear bridging law is incorporated in the finite element (FE) model to assess the effect of interfacial debonding and sliding. A linearly decreasing traction–separation law describes matrix cracking in brittle matrix. Transversely isotropic, orthotropic elastic constitutive relation is used for the effective properties of bulk brittle-matrix composites outside the FPZ. A boundary-layer formulation is imposed on the remote boundary based on the elastic solutions for mode I crack problems. Crack advance and fibre breakage are direct consequences of the constitutive modelling without any ad hoc crack growth criteria. The proposed FE model can eliminates unreal singular stresses ahead of the matrix crack. Fracture resistance ( R ) curves are obtained for a range of interfacial properties, as well as stress and bridging stress distributions. It is found that the toughness can be enhanced by modification of interfacial properties. Numerical results also show that fibre fracture results in a significant reduction of the steady-state toughness and relief of high stress concentration. However, strongly bonded interface implies a high interfacial strength, but a low toughness due to a low fibre strength.",

        "abstract": "Finite element analysis (FEA) is carried out for Mode I dynamic crack propagation in fibre reinforced brittle matrix composites under the conditions of small-scale bridging and high loading rate. The fracture process involves two distinct mechanisms: fibre bridging and matrix cracking. A rate-dependent bridging law based on micromechanical analysis is used to simulate the degradation of crack-bridging, and a softening cohesive law characterises matrix separation. An embedded reinforcement and cohesive zone model represents the fracture process zone (FPZ) of bridged-cracks. Outside the FPZ, the bulk material is transversely isotropic and orthotropic elastic. Numerical results show an accelerated regime in the crack-resistance curves, in contrast to the abrupt rise for brittle materials. There is a competition between the rate-weakening effect on bridging stress and the inertia effect influencing the energy flux to the crack-tip. The fracture resistance depends on both loading rates and rate-sensitivity factors of the bridging law. Fibres break randomly at higher loading rates and rate sensitivity factors, while successive fibre breaks occur at lower rates and rate sensitivities. Thus, the crack-bridging zone has a zigzag opening profile and the non-singular fibre stresses experience oscillations with time at higher rate-sensitivity factors and loading rates.",

        "abstract": "To explore the influence of different thinning intensities on the DBH, height and yield of young bamboo in Bambusa pervariabilis×Dendrocalamopsis daii forest, 3 thinning intensities were adopted in the experimental study in Xishui City of Guizhou Province, i.e., no thinning (Treatment A), moderate thinning (Treatment B) and intensive thinning (Treatment C). The results showed that the DBH of young bamboo under Treatment C was less than Treatment A and Treatment B; the young bamboos under Treatment A and Treatment B had higher height than those under Treatment C. B. pervariabilis×D. daii forest under Treatment B had the highest yield up to 18.15 t/hm2, followed by the forest under Treatment A and C (15.62 t/hm2 and 10.91 t/hm2). With the research, it was found that moderate thinning treatment was beneficial to the growth and yield of young bamboo.",

        "abstract": "This study was aimed to investigate the efficacy of moderate intensity regimen, CHG (homoharringtonine, cytarabine and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)) on the patients with high-risk MDS or MDS-transformed acute myeloid leukemia. 30 newly diagnosed adult patients with high-risk MDS or MDS-transformed AML were enrolled in this clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of sequential low-dose homoharringtonine/cytarabine chemotherapy combined with G-CSF priming. Homoharringtonine and Ara-C were injected intravenously at doses of 1 mg and 25 mg daily for 14 consecutive days respectively, G-CSF was injected subcutaneously once daily at a dose of 300 microg on 12 hours prior to chemotherapy and continued given until the end of chemotherapy or when the peripheral WBC count reached > 20 x 10(9)/L. This regimen was given only for one course, and followed by conventional chemotherapy as maintenance or consolidation therapy when CR achieved. 33 patients with high- risk MDS and MDS-transformed AML were injected aclarubicin/Ara-C intravenously at doses of 10 mg and 25 mg for 8 and 14 consecutive days respectively, G-CSF was used at the same dose and the same way as the CHG regimen. 33 patients with high-risk MDS and MDS-transformed AML were treated with HHT/Ara-C intravenously at doses of 2 - 3 mg and 100 - 150 mg daily for 7 consecutive days respectively, G-CSF was injected when WBC count was below 4 x 10(9)/L, and it was stopped to be used when WBC count was > 4 x 10(9)/L. The results showed that (1) 14 patients achieved complete remission (CR) (46.67 %) and 7 patients achieved partial remission (PR) (23.33 %) with one course of CHG regimen, total effective rate was 70%; 14 patient achieved CR (42.4%) and 9 patients achieved PR (27.3%) with one course of CAG regimen, total effective rate was 69.7%; 7 patient achieved CR (33.3%) and 3 patients achieved PR (9.1%) with one course of HA regimen, total effective rate was 42.4%. There was no statistical difference between the effective rate of CHG and CAG, but difference was significant between CHG and HA. (2) Agranulocytosis (neutrophil < 0.5 x 10(9)/L) occurred in 12 cases (40%) of CHG-treated patients with a mean 8 days of agranulocytic period, so the infectious complications were less serious and tolerable without treatment-related death. (3) Among 14 out of 30 patients with CR, 9 relapsed, the mean duration from CR to replace was 8.2 months. All relapsed patients reusing CHG regimen did not achieved CR again. (4) Among 13 cases with CR, 6 patients just received HA or DA regimens as consolidatory and intensive chemotherapy after CR have relapsed, the mean CR time was only 6.1 months. Otherwise, the mean CR time of 7 CR patients received alternative succeeded chemotherapy containing mitoxantrone/idarubicin/THP/homoharringtonine/daunorubicin/aclarubicin after CR was 10.6 months; and among them 4 are still in continuous CR. It is concluded that the CHG chemotherapy regimen has a similar effect with CAG but better than HA, and in a saft chemotherapy regimen with slight myelosuppression in clinical application, strong and alternative succeeded chemotherapy is necessary for CR patients to keep longer CR and survival.",

        "abstract": "A kind of amphiphilic polymer, ES-1, is transferred onto solid substrates as so-called \"reversed duckweed\" polymeric Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. Their orientations, structures, and phase-transition behaviors were studied in detail by infrared (IR) transmission and reflection-absorption (RA) spectroscopy. The IR studies have revealed that the alkyl chains are nearly perpendicular to the film surface and assume highly ordered conformation. The first monolayer has a different orientation and arrangement from other layers in a multilayer ES-1 LB film deposited on a Au-evaporated glass slide because of the interaction between the gold surface and hydrophilic headgroup of ES-1. IR-RA spectra of an ES-1 LB film on a Au-evaporated glass slide at evaporated temperatures have shown that the order-disorder phase transition of the LB film takes place at about 60°C after the clear pretransitional alterations. The packing density of alkyl chains decreases gradually with temperature after the order-disorder transitions in the LB films. The alkyl chains in ES-1 casting films on a CaF2 plate and a Au-evaporated glass slide are tilted considerably. The studies on the phase-transition behavior have revealed that the two casting films give rise to the order-disorder transition at about 75°C after undergoing the pretransitional changes. For the casting film of ES-1 on the Au-evaporated glass slide, there is a phenomenon of reorientation that the alkyl chains change from more tilted orientation at room temperature to more perpendicular orientation at higher temperature before the order-disorder transition takes place and turn tilted again above the transition temperature.",

        "abstract": "This study was purposed to explore the expression of p57kip2 in the bone marrow of patients with de novo myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and its role in MDS pathogenesis, as well as the relationship between the expression of p57kip2 and SDF-1/CXCR4 signal. The expression of p57kip2 and CXCR4 in 67 de novo MDS patients was measured by real-time quantitative PCR. The percentage of CD34(+) cells in the bone marrow from MDS patients was measured by flow cytometry. 18 healthy volunteers were recruited for control. The effect of SDF-1 on p57kip2 expression in bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMMNC) from MDS or normal controls was investigated in vitro, and difference between them was compared. The results showed that low-risk MDS and high-risk MDS displayed a significant reduction of p57kip2 mRNA expression in BMMNC compared with that in control group (P < 0.001) and there was a negative correlation between p57kip2 expression and percentage of CD34(+) (r = -0.458, P < 0.001); the patients with abnormal karyotype showed lower expression of p57kip2 gene, compared to patients with normal karyotype (P = 0.045). Although the expression of CXCR4 had no difference between MDS patients and normal controls, a positive correlation between p57kip2 and CXCR4 in MDS patients was still found (r = 0.609, P < 0.001). Moreover, SDF-1 increased p57kip2 expression in normal BMMNC in dose-dependent manner, but BMMNC from MDS patients showed no response to SDF-1. SDF-1-induced p57 expression was blocked by AMD3100. It is concluded that the low expression of p57 gene in MDS may play a role in the pathogenesis of MDS. Furthermore, SDF-1-induced p57kip2 expression in BMMNC, and the decreasing response of BMMNC to SDF-1 may contribute to the low expression of p57kip2 in MDS patients.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the role of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the evaluation of intravitreal injection of Bevacizumab for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Methods: Twenty-three patients (24 eyes) were diagnosed with CNV, among whom 19 (20 eyes) were age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and the other 4 (4 eyes) were pathologic myopia (PM). Each patient received intravitreal injection of Bevacizumab (2.5 mg/month) for three months. Before and after treatment, visual acuity was measured, OCT was employed for the observation of retinal morphology of macular region, and macular retinal thickness was determined. All the cases were followed up for 1 to 7 months. Results: Twenty-four eyes received 75 times of intravitreal injection in all, with 3.1 times for each eye. No adverse events occured. After treatment, visual acuity of 17 eyes (70.8%) was improved by 8 letters of Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Chart, while that of the other 7 eyes was stable. It was revealed by OCT that the neuroepithelial layer thickness of macular fovea was decreased from (355.83 ± 113.21) μm (before treatment) to (258.46 ± 74.55) μm (after treatment) (P < 0.01). Macular retinal edema (24 eyes), macular cystoid edema (4 eyes), subretinal fluid (7 eyes) and retinal pigment epithelium detachment (3 eyes) were improved after treatment. Conclusion: Intravitreal injection of Bevacizumab for the treatment of CNV secondary to AMD and PM may lead to a favourable outcome. OCT can objectively, accurately and effectively evaluate the efficacy of anti-VEGF-A therapy.",

        "title": "Adaptive Power Control for Maximizing Channel Capacity over Full-Duplex D2D Q-OFDMA Ad Hoc Networks.",
        "abstract": "To support the emerging next generation wireless networks, researchers have made a great deal of efforts in investigating various promising techniques, such as full-duplex (FD) multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) technique and device-to-device (D2D) communications. FD MIMO technique can practically achieve the theoretical doubling of throughput if the self-interference can be efficiently cancelled. And D2D communication is designed and implemented to significantly enhance the FD communication performance by effectively reducing the overall interference and lowering transmit power over ad hoc networks. However, how to efficiently cancel the selfinterference induced by the FD MIMO transmissions under D2D communications has imposed many new challenges. To overcome the above-mentioned problems, we propose the adaptive power control policy for maximizing channel capacity over FD D2D QOFDMA ad hoc networks. In particular, under the Nakagami-m channel model, we establish the system model for the spatial multiplexing oriented Q-OFDMA system, and apply the selfinterference suppression techniques for FD model. We derive and analyze the energy efficiency for FD system over ad hoc networks. Then, we develop the adaptive power control policy for maximizing the MIMO channel capacity under our proposed spatial multiplexing based Q-OFDMA system over ad hoc networks.

        "abstract": "To support the emerging next era of mobile wireless networks, researchers have made a great deal of efforts in promising techniques in multimedia services — the statistical quality of service (QoS) technique, which has been proved to be effective in statistically guaranteeing delay-bounded video transmissions over the time-varying wireless channels. On the other hand, as the 5G-promising techniques, the device-to-device (D2D) assisted mobile traffic offloading and caching techniques have also been proposed to significantly improve the overall system capacity as well as mitigate the traffic congestion at the base stations for the real-time traffic over 5G wireless networks. However, how to efficiently integrate these advanced techniques in supporting the statistical QoS requirements have imposed many new challenges not met before. To effectively overcome the aforementioned problems, in this paper we propose the statistical QoS-driven power adaptation scheme for the distributed caching assisted mobile offloading scheme over 5G wireless networks. In particular, under the Nakagami-m fading model, we establish the system models for the D2D assisted caching and the partial in-network transcoding. Given the statistical QoS constraints, we derive and analyze the effective capacity under our developed optimal adaptation policies for cache-enabled D2D assisted mobile offloading system under 5G wireless networks. Also conducted is a set of simulations which show that our proposed scheme outperforms the other existing schemes to efficiently implement the statistical QoS requirements over cache-enabled 5G wireless networks.",

        "abstract": "A universal aptameric system based on the taking advantage of double-stranded DNA/perylene diimide (dsDNA/PDI) as the signal probe was developed for multiplexed detection of small molecules. Aptamers are single-stranded DNA or RNA oligonucleotides which are selected in vitro by a process known as systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment. In this work, we synthesized a new kind of PDI and reported this aggregated PDI could quench the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-labeled fluorophores with a high quenching efficiency. The quenching efficiencies on the fluorescence of FAM, TAMRA and Cy5 could reach to 98.3%±0.9%, 97.2%±0.6% and 98.1%±1.1%, respectively. This broad-spectrum quencher was then adopted to construct a multicolor biosensor via a label-free approach. A structure-switching-triggered enzymatic recycling amplification was employed for signal amplification. High quenching efficiency combined with autocatalytic target recycling amplification afforded the biosensor with high sensitivity towards small analytes. For other targets, changing the corresponding aptamer can achieve the goal. The quencher did not interfere with the catalytic activity of nuclease. The biosensor could be manipulated with similar sensitivity no matter in pre-addition or post-addition manner. Moreover, simultaneous and multiplexed analysis of several small molecules in homogeneous solution was achieved, demonstrating its potential application in the rapid screening of multiple biotargets.",

We show phonon spectrometrically that molecular undercoordination induced hydrogen bond (O:H-O) relaxation and nonbonding electron polarization furnished the skin with the supersolid nature - less dense, elastic, thermally more stable than the bulk. Heating from 5 to 95 degrees C stiffens the skin H-O phonon (or bond stiffness) from 3443 cm(-1) by 0.38%, and the bulk phonon from 3239 cm(-1) by 1.48%, but softens the H-O dangling bonds from 3604 cm(-1) by -0.40%. Heating also changes the respective molecular structural order and phonon abundance by -8.4/-19.7%, 4.9/-2.6%, and 13.0/137.0%. Observations also evidenced that both heating and molecular undercoordination have the same effect on O:H-O bond relaxation but opposite on polarization, which improves our understanding of the anomalous skin of liquid water.

        "abstract": "p73, a tumor suppressor gene with significant homology to p53, is hypermethylated in a high percentage of NK-cell lymphoma and B-cell lymphomas patients. Given these data, we sought to study the role of p73 methylation in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In this study, the methylation status of the p73 gene promoter was analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) in bone marrow (BM) samples from 135 adult patients with de novo MDS. The results of MS-PCR were confirmed by bisulfite sequencing. We found that p73 methylation was present in 37% (n = 50) of these cases and methylaiton was correlated significantly with World Health Organization (WHO) subtypes. Patients with advanced stages of WHO subtypes (30 vs. 59%, P = 0.002) exhibited a significantly higher frequency of p73 methylation. Moreover, a decrease in transcription of p73 was accompanied by methylation (P = 0.032) and the decitabine treatment restored the expression of p73. The median survival of patients with p73 methylation was shorter than that for patients without p73 methylation (15 vs. >33 months, P = 0.002). A multivariate analysis also indicated that the p73 methylation status was the independent factor that impacted overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS). However, we failed to find any significant association between p73 methylation and clinical responses to decitabine, a hypomethylating agent that was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with MDS. In conclusion, p73 methylation is common in patients with MDS and indicate poor prognosis. p73 may be a therapeutic target in MDS.",

        "abstract": "Cooperative communication is an efficient technique for mobile wireless networks supporting information transmission through relay nodes, which forward the signal received from a source node to its destination. Applying the cooperative communication in wireless networks can significantly improve the network performance. One of the most important challenges is how to efficiently allocate the access opportunity of a relay node to multiple mobile-users while taking into account the delay-bounded quality of service (QoS) for the time-sensitive multimedia data transmissions. To overcome these difficulties, in this paper we propose a novel game-theory based scheme to resolve the relay node allocation problem by measuring the maximum throughput for time-sensitive multimedia data transmission under a QoS requirement as the effective capacity gain. We formulate this one relay allocation problem as a single-relay-auction such that all mobile-user players can decide whether to patriciate in this relay auction, and the mobile-user player who places the highest bid obtains the relay allocation. The mobile-user players who lose or stay out of the auction can only directly transmit information to their destinations. Then, we derive the optimal strategies for the single-relay-auction, maximizing the payoff (effective capacity gain minus costs) in each bid round.The extensive simulation results obtained validate and evaluate our proposed schemes.",

With the assist of ultrasonication, hollow nanospheres can be controllably prepared by thiol-maleimide reaction of two monomers at the emulsion interface, which exhibit good stability and dynamic property. In addition, the encapsulated guest molecules could be controllably released from the supramolecular polymeric nanospheres, owing to their stimuli-responsiveness.

Results show that both oxygen atoms in the O:H-O bond shift initially outwardly with respect to the coordination origin (H), lengthening the O-O distance by 0.0136 nm from 0.2597 to 0.2733 nm by Coulomb repulsion between electron pairs on adjacent oxygen atoms. Both oxygen atoms then move toward right along the O:H-O bond by different amounts upon being compressed, approaching identical length of 0.11 nm. The van der Waals potential VL(r) for the O:H noncovalent bond reaches a valley at -0.25 eV, and the lowest exchange VH(r) for the H-O polar-covalent bond is valued at -3.97 eV.",

Legionella strains isolated from the 16 cooling towers were confirmed by serological and latex agglutination. PFGE was applied for the fingerprinting of the isolates, while the cluster results of PFGE were analyzed by BioNumerics software.131 strains of Legionella were isolated, including L. pneumophila, L. bozemanae, L. micdadei and L. anisa. 52 distinguishable PFGE patterns were differentiated among the 16 cooling towers, with 37 patterns were owned by just one cooling tower, which was not shared with other cooling towers, while 15 patterns were shared by more than 2 cooling towers. All the cooling towers had ≥ 2 PFGE patterns, while in 13 cooling towers the same PFGE patterns were recovered during the six months. From June to October of 2007, 18 strains of Legionella belonging to the PFGE pattern of LPAs.SH0078 were isolated continuously from 6 cooling towers.This study demonstrated great genotypic diversity and complexity of Legionella in cooling towers. Persistence of the PFGE patterns was observed in 81.25% of the cooling towers. The PFGE pattern of LPAs. SH0078 was distributed widely, suggesting it might be the dominate strain in Shanghai.",

Preference Elicitation, as a commonly used approach to address the problem, solicits preference of cold user by interviewing them with some elaborately selected items. How to select minimum items to reflect user preference as much as possible is the essential goal of preference elicitation. In this paper, we propose a novel Structured Sparse Representative Selection(SSRS) model to select a sparse set of items based on their ability of representation. Moreover, a &ell;2,1-norm is utilized on both loss function and regularization to make the model insensitive to outliers and avoid selecting redundant queries respectively. Empirical results on benchmark movie rating datasets Movielens and Flixster verify the promising performance of our proposed preference elicitation method for cold start recommendation.",

The paper is designed to study the value of clinical application of uNTX and sBAP in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), as well as the action of bisphosphonates for osteolytic bone lesion.Thirty-three MM cases were treated with bisphosphonates (hereinafter called clodronate therapy group) and 20 MM cases were treated with simple chemotherapy (hereinafter called control group). uNTX and sBAP were tested during the courses of treatment three times (pretreatment, 3 months, and 6 months). uNTX was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. sBAP was tested by chemiluminescence analysis. All the results were analyzed with t-test by using SPSS 11.0.There were no significant differences between therapy and control groups: in uNTX (173.74 ± 14.55) and (129.79 ± 12.13) μg/l before treatment (P > 0.05). After 6 months there were significant differences between them: (85.71 ± 8.23) and (121.59 ± 12.43) μg/l (P < 0.05). And also there were significant differences among the courses in the therapy group. There were no significant differences between therapy and control groups in sBAP concentration: (4.78 ± 0.55) and (8.42 ± 1.32) μg/l before treatment (P > 0.05). After 6 months there were significant differences between them: (16.01 ± 0.52) and (9.62 ± 1.29) μg/l (P < 0.001). And also there were significant differences among the courses in the therapy group.uNTX and sBAP were important to measure the situation of the osteolytic bone lesion in MM. Bisphosphonates can significantly reduce bone degradation and metabolism, improve the synthesis, which is valuable for the treatment of MM cases.",

        "abstract": "The present paper aims to compare the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of a seasonal influenza A(H1N1) virus isolated in 2011 with the gene from reported seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses. The HA fragment and full-genome of A/Shanghai/1167/2011(H1N1) were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Molecular biology software was used to analyze the sequences and draw the phylogenetic tree. The anti-virus antibody level in healthy people was detected by hemagglutination inhibition test. The results showed that the HA gene of A/Shanghai/1167/2011(H1N1) was similar to the HA genes from previous reported seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses, with homology of 99.2% to the 2008-2009 seasonal influenza A(H1N1) vaccine strain A/Brisbane/59/2007(H1N1), and 72.4% to the A/California/07/2009 vaccine strain respectively. The HA cleavage site was PSIQSR↓GLF, and highly pathogenic molecular characteristics had not appeared yet. HA fragment, encoding 557 amino acids, has nine potential glycosylation sites. Its amino acid sequence was compared with the World Health Organization (WHO) vaccine strains of influenza A/NewCaledonia/20/1999(H1N1), A/SolomonIslands/3/2006(H1N1), and A/Brisbane/59/2007(H1N1) respectively. The identified amino acid differences were 15, 12 and 4 respectively, and part of these differences (5/15, 5/12 and 2/5) were located inside the critical epitope clusters (Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2 and Cb). Our results indicated that in 2011, 34.33% of healthy people carried antibodies against the isolated strain in their sera, and the geometric mean titer (GMT) was 10.38. A/Shanghai/1167/2011(H1N1) is a seasonal influenza A(H1N1) strain isolated in Shanghai in 2011. Although no significant differences were identified when comparing it to seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses, its detection after A(H1N1)pdm09 was identified as the predominant strain should arouse people’s attention. Its antibody level in population is low, and can easily cause a pandemic. The monitoring of such strains in influenza-like population should be improved.",

To deliver a variety of services to subscriber stations, a large volume of traffic is exchanged via mesh routers in the mesh backbone network. One of the critical problems in service-oriented wireless mesh networks is to improve the network throughput. Wireless network coding is a key technology to improve network throughput in multihop wireless networks since it can exploit not only the broadcast nature of the wireless channel, but also the native physical-layer coding ability by mixing simultaneously arriving radio waves at relay nodes. We first analyze the throughput improvement obtained by wireless network coding schemes in wireless mesh networks. Then we develop a heuristic joint link scheduling, channel assignment, and routing algorithm that can improve the network throughput for service-oriented wireless mesh networks. Our extensive simulations show that wireless network coding schemes can improve network throughput by 34 percent.",

The expression of hepcidin can be influenced by the body signals (such as serum ferritin and erythropoietin levels) as well as inflammation, hypoxia and other disease states. These stimulus activate the signaling pathway of BMP-the SMAD, the JAK-STAT and HIF1 through the liver parenchymal cell surface type I transmembrane glycoprotein of HFE, transferrin receptor 1, 2, hepcidin regulatory proteins, thereby changing the hepcidin gene transcription, regulating the expression levels of hepcidin. However, the molecular mechanism that regulate hepcidin expression is unclear. From the signal factors that affect hepcidin expression and signaling pathways involved in its expression, the latest research progress on regulatory mechanism of hepcidin are summarized.",

The results of MSP were confirmed by bisulfite sequencing. The expression of p73 mRNA was detected by real-time quantitative PCR. Primary bone marrow cells from MDS patients were treated with decitabine, the changes of p73 methylation status and p73 mRNA expression were measured. The role of p73 methylation in the prognosis of MDS and the correlated clinical data were explored.p73 hypermethylation was present in 37.04% of MDS cases and patients with high risk MDS (RAEB-1 and RAEB-2) exhibited a significantly higher frequency of p73 methylation than that of low risk MDS (58.8% vs 29.7%, P = 0.002). The expression of p73 mRNA in the methylated group was decreased compared to that of the unmethylated group (P = 0.032). Decitabine treatment decreased the level of p73 methylation and increased the level of p73 transcripts. Patients with p73 methylation progressed rapidly to AML (P < 0.001) and had shorter survival (P = 0.002) than those who did not have p73 methylation. In the multivariate Cox regression model, BM blast and p73 methylation status emerged as independent prognostic factor for overall survival and leukemia free survival.p73 gene methylation is common in patients with MDS and may indicate poor prognosis. p73 may be a therapeutic target in MDS.",

R. China. Rhegmatogenous RD patients came from inpatient, outpatient service data and the local health net databank composed of health data of 97.5% of all local residents. A contrast group was set up. The previous population data can be used to estimate the whole and specific incidence of rhegmatogenous RD. Some factors relevant to rhegmatogenous RD incidence were found by comparing the patient group and the contrast group.In Dec 1996 to Dec 1999, 61 cases with rhegmatogenous RD newly happened. The patients were 29 males and 32 females. The annual incidences of rhegmatogenous RD in these 4 years were 11.3/10(5), 14.1/10(5), 14.1/10(5) and 17.6/10(5) respectively, and the average annual incidence was 14.4/10(5) (95% confidence interval 10.0 - 18.6). There was a high incidence of rhegmatogenous RD in persons older than 40 years, especially between 40 and 59. When compared with the contrast group, the proportion of high myopia (more than -6.00 D) was significantly higher in rhegmatogenous RD patients group (P < 0.001).The annual incidence of rhegmatogenous RD of local Chinese population in these 4 years is increasing. It is strongly associated with high myopia and age, but not with gender.",

        "abstract": "With the electromagnetic environments of war-field being so intricate and complex,the high false alarm rate,big missed detection rate and long warning time are big problems faced by the RWR/ ESM(Radar Warning Receiver/ Electronic Support Measure) receiver.The basic reason is the pulse loss caused by measurement system that leads to the reduce of the intercept of threaten signal.In combination with measurement system this paper analyzes the pulse loss caused by time division,and infers computational formula of the pulse loss probability.On this base,an improved method based on pluse density is proposed to distribute system resource.The pulses loss caused by the two methods are compared according to simulations.The research in this paper provides theoretical reference for developing new RWR/ ESM in the future.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of 2μm continuous-wave thulium laser for the treatment of non-muscle-invasive bladder tumor (NMIBT) by comparing the results of transurethral resection (TURBt). Methods:We reviewed 85 patients with NMIBT who treated in our hospital, 33 cases were treated by TURBt, and 52 patients were treated by 2μm continuous-wave thulium laser. Of 56 cases whose bladder tumor were first been detected, 24 cases were multiple tumor. Of 22 cases the tumor diameter was greater 2. 5 cm. After surgery ,every patient accepted regular intravesical chemical drug instillation, and repeated cystoscope examination every 3 months. The recurrence-free survival rate of two groupsoperative time, postoperative hospital stay, complications and recurrence rate were also been compared. Results:The average operation time of overall patients was 26. 59±11. 63 min (5-75) min, with 24. 33±10. 10 min in 2μm thulium laser group and 30. 15±13. 08 min in TURBt group respectively (P=0. 034). No intraoperative complication was reported in 2μm thulium laser group while vesical perforation in 1 patient was found in TURBt group. Postoperative complications in 2 patients were found in 2μm thulium laser group while 3 occurred in TURBt group. The overall complication rate between two groups was no statistics difference (P = 0. 126). The postoperative hospitalization time of each group was 3. 19±0. 93 days in 2μm thulium laser group and 3. 83±1. 82 days in TURBt group (P=0. 067). 21 patients' tumor recurred during 15. 45±8. 08 months followup (range 3-39 months). In 2μm thulium laser group, 0,4,5,1 recurrence cases were found in 3,6,9,12 moths, one year recurrence rate was 19. 23% postoperatively, while in TURBt group, 1,2,4,2 recurrence cases were detected respectively, recurrence rate was 27. 27%. No statistics difference was found by comparing with the recurrence-free rate of two groups (P = 0. 341). Conclusions:Comparing with traditional TURBt, treating NMIBT with 2μm thulium laser could greatly increased operation safety and operation tolerant ability of patients. Shorter operation time and postoperative hospitalization time could be achieved, but no better clinical efficacy found by using 2μm thulium laser to treat NMIBT, there are still some limitations.",

        "title": "Multi-radio medium access control protocol for wireless sensor networks",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new dual radio medium access control (MAC) protocol for wireless sensor networks. Our MAC protocol design combines the advantages of low and high frequency bands in different modes of MAC operations in order to result in energy efficiency. Our prototype also supports spectrum agility, which is becoming important due to ever crowding wireless spectrum. We present the detailed design rationale and individual micro-level experimental performance evaluation of the MAC protocol on our prototype sensor node platform. We also make comprehensive empirical performance comparisons with the widely used B-MAC protocol and show the performance gains that our MAC protocol is able to achieve under various traffic loads and duty cycles. I. INTRODUCTION Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are widely used in many application areas such as environmental and habitat monitoring, health-care applications, home automation, traffic control, etc. Sensor nodes are generally battery operated and keeping the network alive over extended periods of time just by changing batteries is either highly cumbersome or impractical. Since radio communication consumes most of the available energy resource, power-aware networking in general and especially the MAC protocols bear a peculiar importance in this context. Owing to the severe energy constraints, we designed a MAC protocol that combines the advantages of high and low frequency radios to yield an energy efficient operation. The use of low frequency band for carrier sensing and high frequency band for burst data transmission results in an overall power optimal operation (1). Multi-radio MAC (MR-MAC) protocol is a p-persistent carrier sense multiple access protocol with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). It is designed for sensor node platforms supporting dual frequency bands. It aims at providing an energy efficient solution for the varying traffic requirements of WSN applications and at the same time intelligently utilizing the ever crowding frequency spectrum. We have developed a prototype sensor node platform, which is capable of operating in two different frequency bands simultaneously. The basic idea behind this approach is to achieve energy consumption gains as compared to many other contemporary solutions by exploiting the benefits of the two frequency bands. This is achieved by using appropriate radios in different modes of MAC operations as we will describe in this article. Our hardware platform also provides support for spectrum agility, which we believe will be an important feature in the future wireless systems. Because of the low transmission power, sensor nodes suffer the most in competing with other less power-constrained wireless networks operating in the same frequency band. We have developed an algorithm for determining the degree of interference in high frequency band so that our multi-radio MAC protocol is able to decide which data transmission channel should be used. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: we give a state- of-the-art overview of the existing WSN MAC solutions in Section II. Section III describes the design and implementation details of MR-MAC on our prototype sensor node platform. In Section IV, a detailed experimental performance evaluation of the MR-MAC is presented and empirical performance compar- ison with B-MAC (2) is carried out. Finally, in Section V, the article is concluded and future work directions are outlined.",

        "abstract": "The newly imposed heterogeneous statistical delay- bounded quality of service (QoS) provisioning, which refers to the different/variable delay-bounded QoS guarantees among different wireless links, for the fifth-generation (5G) mobile multimedia wireless networks has received much research attention recently. The heterogeneous statistical delay- bounded QoS provisioning can be classified into two categories: centralized and decentralized heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning where the delay-bounded QoS requirements are centralized at the base station (BS) and distributed at different mobile user equipments (UEs), respectively. The decentralized heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning is more challenging than the centralized heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning. In this paper, we build up the system model for decentralized heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning in terms of aggregate effective capacity and heterogeneous QoS exponents. Based on this model, we develop the optimal joint bandwidth and power allocations scheme to maximize the aggregate effective capacity of uplink transmissions supporting the heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS provisionings over 5G mobile multimedia wireless networks. The BS allocates the bandwidth based on the QoS exponents of all uplinks while the mobile UEs dynamically allocate the power based on the corresponding instantaneous channel state information (CSI), the corresponding QoS exponent, and the bandwidth allocated by the BS. We conduct the extensive simulations to validate and evaluate our developed optimal joint bandwidth and power allocations schemes, showing that our proposed heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning scheme can significantly increase the aggregate effective capacity as compared with the homogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning schemes.",

        "abstract": "The larval plerocercoid of Spirometra erinaceieuropaei can parasitize humans, causing a serious food borne parasitic zoonosis known as sparganosis. Sparganosis have increased in China in recent years. In this study, the prevalence of sparganum infection in wild frogs in 9 geographical areas in southwest China was firstly investigated. Of 276 caught frogs, 55 frogs were found to be infected with sparganum. Then, the population genetic structure of these sparganum isolates was explored based on four molecular markers (cytb, cox1, rrnS and 28S rDNA D1). Highly genetic diversity and the genetic differentiation among sparganum isolates from different sites were revealed in the DNA polymorphism analyses. Both the phylogenetic inference and the analysis of the median-joining network supported two clades in the southwest S. erinaceieuropaei population. However, none demographic population expansion of the southwest S. erinaceieuropaei population was observed in the neutrality test, mismatch distribution analysis and Bayesian skyline plot analysis. Finally, the phylogenetic diversity of S. erinaceieuropaei from eastern, central, southern and southwest China was analyzed, the result suggested that Chinese S. erinaceieuropaei population should be divided into two groups (Group I and Group II), and they started to divergence in the middle Pliocene.",

        "abstract": "Relaxation of the hydrogen bond (O:H-O) between oxygen ions of undercoordinated molecules fascinates the behavior of water nanodroplets and nanobubbles. However, probing such potentials remains yet far from reality. Here we show that the Lagrangian solution (Huang et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2013, 117, 13639) transforms the observed H-O bond (x = H) and O:H nonbond (x = L) lengths and their characteristic phonon frequencies (d(x), omega(x)) (Sun et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2013, 4, 2565) into their respective force constants and cohesive energies (k(x), E-x), which results in mapping of the potential paths for the O:H-O bond relaxing with (H2O)(N) cluster size. Results show that molecular undercoordination not only reduces its size (H-O length d(H)) with enhanced HO energy from the bulk value of 3.97 to 5.10 eV for a H2O monomer but also enlarges their separation (O:H distance dL) with O:H energy reduction from 95 to 35 meV for a dimer. The H-O energy gain raises the melting point of water skin from the bulk value 273 to 310 K, and the O:H energy loss lowers the freezing temperature of a 1.4 nm sized droplet from the bulk value 258 to 202 K, which indicates droplet size induced dispersion of the quasisolid phase boundaries.",

        "abstract": "High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) is a promising approach for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Higher cell doses have been associated with a faster blood count recovery and a reduction in transfusion requirements, infection rates, and hospitalization times. Mobilization failure constitutes one of the main reasons for avoiding auto-HSCT. The role of high-dose methotrexate (MTX) as mobilization regimen is still unclear.The effect of high-dose MTX as a mobilization regimen for 67 adult patients with NHL who received auto-HSCT was studied between January 2001 and October 2012. The stem cells were mobilized using combination chemotherapy including MTX plus granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in 33 patients (Group A), and the stem cells of the other 34 patients were mobilized using the same combination chemotherapy plus G-CSF without MTX (Group B).All of the patients were successfully mobilized in Group A; however, two patients failed in Group B. The median numbers of CD34+ cells collected were 14.36 × 10(6) and 5.3 × 10(6) cells/kg for Groups A and B, respectively (p < 0.05). All of the patients experienced a stable neutrophil and platelet (PLT) engraftment. The times to white blood cell engraftment were 8.0 days in Group A and 11.0 days in Group B, and the times to PLT engraftment were 12.0 days in Group A and 13.0 days in Group B (p < 0.05 for both variables).High-dose MTX is a powerful regimen component for stem cell mobilization in adult patients with NHL.",

Ten compounds were simultaneously identified by electrospray ion mass spectrometry (ESI/MS) and comparison with reference standards and literature data. All of them were quantified by UPLC method. Baseline separation was achieved on an ODS-140HTP C(18) column (2.3mum, 100mmx2.1mm I.D.) with linear gradient elution of acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid. This developed method provides good linearity (r(2)>0.9996), repeatability (RSD<3.63%), intra- and inter-day precisions (RSD<0.86%) with accuracies (97.88-101.56%) and recovery (98.88-101.92%) of 10 major constituents, namely baicalin, baicalein, wogonoside, wogonin, glycyrrhizic acid, liquiritin, rhein, emodin, chrysophanol and physcion. In addition, the principal component analysis (PCA) coupled with the UPLC fingerprint was applied to classify the NHJDP samples according to their manufacture corporation. This proposed method with high sensitivity and selectivity was successfully utilized to analyze 10 major bioactive compounds in 30 batches of NHJDPs, and the results demonstrate that this analytical method is simple and suitable for the original discrimination and quality control of this TCM.",

Making best use of the DSRC multichannel architecture, we propose a cluster-based multichannel communications scheme, which integrates the clustering with contention-free/contention-based MAC protocols. In our proposed scheme, the elected cluster-head (CH) vehicle functions as the coordinator (like WLAN's basestation) to collect/deliver the real-time safety messages within its own cluster and forward the consolidated safety messages to the neighboring CHs. Also, the CH vehicle controls channel-assignments for cluster-member vehicles transmitting/receiving the non-real-time traffics, which makes the wireless channels more efficiently utilized for the non-real-time data transmissions. Our scheme uses the contention-free MAC (TDMA/broadcast) within a cluster and the IEEE 802.11 MAC among CH vehicles such that the real-time delivery of safety messages can be guaranteed. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the throughputs of vehicle data communications while guaranteeing the real-time delivery of safety messages",

        "abstract": "AIM:To explore the mechanism of myocardium protection after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by preconditioning with ischemia in human. METHODS:Thirty-six patients underwent valve replacement were divided into ischemic preconditioning group (IP group,20 cases) and non-ischemic preconditioning group (control group,16 cases) according to whether they were given single cycle reperfusion before cardioplegia or not. Serum levels of interleukin-8 and 10 were measured with ELISA. Expressions of myocardial Bcl-2 and caspase-3 were analyzed. RESULTS:The inflammatory factors IL-8 and IL-10 increased to the highest level in serum at 6 h after declamping and recovered to normal level on 5 d after declamping. On 6 h,1 d and 2 d after declamping,serum level of IL-8 was significantly lower in IP group than that in control group (P<0.05),but serum level of IL-10 was higher in IP group (P<0.05). Expression of myocardial Bcl-2 and caspase-3 increased in both groups after reperfusion,and Bcl-2 was lower in the control group than that in IP group while the level of caspase-3 was higher (P<0.05). Expression of myocardial Bcl-2 had positive correlation with IL-10 and negative correlation with IL-8. CONCLUSION:Ischemic preconditioning has the effect of protection of human myocardial cells after ischemia/reperfusion injury through decreasing systemic inflammatory response following ischemia reperfusion injury.",

        "abstract": "Background:  The chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells have showed strong anti-leukemia role, which can treat or prevent relapse by targeting minimal residual disease for patients undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The infusion of allogeneic CAR-T cells may cause the graft-versus-host disease, which could limit its use during and after allo-HSCT. It is still unclear whether CAR-T cells can be used during and after allo-HSCT. In this study, the use of CAR-T cells in these situation was explored.   Methods:  Two patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) received allo-HSCT, the CAR-T cells was used as a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen. Another three patients with high-risk ALL received preventive infusion of CAR-T cells on days +60 after allo-HSCT.   Results:  For patients undergone allo-HSCT, the time of peak CAR-T cell proliferation was detected after the first infusion of CAR-T cells on day 7. The engraftment and full donor cell engraftment were established. The disease was in complete remission with negative minimal residual disease, which was undetectable by flow cytometry. No graft-versus-host disease and serious cytokine release syndrome was found. For patients received preventive infusion of CAR-T cells, the CAR-T cells continually survival. No graft-versus-host disease and serious cytokine release syndrome was found. The disease is complete remission for 1-6 months.   Conclusion:  It is safety and effective for CAR-T cells used in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  Disclosures  No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",

[Method] The antenna's design method of electronic tag and reader antenna were expounded and different antennas were used for testing communication test of RFID system. [Result] When the parameter setup such as data transportation ratio was same,the communication distance of external antenna was farther than RCB antenna; compare with three external antennas,the communication distance of coaxial antenna and wall-hanged antenna were farther. In 500 kbps transfer rate,communication distance was within 28 meters,and in 250 kbps transfer rate,communication distance was within 40 meters. Considered the cost of hardware,the price of wall-hanged antenna was higher than coaxial antenna,so in the same communication distance request,system selected coaxial antenna. [Conclusion] During the pig breeding stage,by dint of electronic tag and reader designed by the research could improve the safety of the pork and fully realize the track of source of food and provide technology support for the transparent management of food safety.",

        "abstract": "Human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) may contribute to the growth of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, there are certain differences in biology between CML and Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph ALL). Little is known about the role and mechanism of hBMSCs on the growth of TKI-resistant Ph ALL. The current study co-cultured hBMSCs with the TKI-resistant SUP-B15. Next, the proliferation of SUP-B15 was detected using a Cell Counting Kit-8. Additionally, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry were used to detect the expression of the associated genes and proteins. The present study explores the role and mechanism of hBMSCs on the growth of TKI-resistant Ph ALL. The current study showed that hBMSCs promoted the proliferation of TKI-resistant Ph ALL. This was shown by the increase in cells in the S+G2-M phase of the cell cycle. It was also found that the expression of cyclins A, C, D1 and E was increased. Apoptosis was inhibited through upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes [B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) and BCL-extra large] and downregulation of apoptotic genes (BCL-XS, BCL-2-associated X protein, and caspases 3, 7 and 9). Expression of the breakpoint cluster region (BCR)-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL) gene, Wnt5a, and Wnt signaling pathway-associated genes (glycogen synthase kinase-3β, β-catenin, E-cadherin and phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and transcription factors (c-myc, ephrin type-B2, fibroblast growth factor 20 and matrix metalloproteinase 7) was also increased. Furthermore, the expression of drug resistance genes (low-density lipoprotein receptor, multidrug resistance-associated protein and multi-drug resistance gene) was increased and the expression of anti-oncogenes (death-associated protein kinase and interferon regulatory factor-1) was decreased. It was concluded that hBMSCs promote the growth of TKI-resistant Ph ALL by these aforementioned mechanisms. Therefore, targeting hBMSCs may be a promising approach for preventing the growth of TKI-resistant Ph ALL.",

        "abstract": "The Western Tianshan Orogen in northwestern China is part of the southwestern margin of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), which represents the largest tectonic assembly of accretionary complexes and the most significant area of Phanerozoic continental growth in the world. Granitoid rocks have a widespread occurrence and occupy about 30% of the whole exposure of the orogen. Ages obtained for the granitoids vary from 896Ma to 247Ma, while initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios vary from 0.70329 to 0.72070 and εNd values from -14.1 to +7.3. The occurrence of Neoproterozoic granitic gneisses implies the presence of Precambrian basement in this area. During oceanic subduction, continental growth occurred as a result of several combined processes, i.e. by addition of oceanic crustal melts (adakites), the intrusion of basaltic magmas derived by partial melting of the metasomatized depleted mantle wedge and the upwelling of granitic magma derived from a mixed source of basaltic magmas and old continental basement. However, during the post-collisional period, vertical accretion of underplated juvenile mantle material may have been accomplished during 'slab breakoff' delamination. This study suggests a two stage model of continental growth of 'syn-subduction lateral accretion of arc complexes' and 'post-collisional vertical accretion of underplated mantle material', which may also be relevant for the western segment of the CAOB in the Phanerozoic. The reworking and involvement of old crust are more obvious in the Western Tianshan Orogen compared to other parts of the CAOB comprising the Western Junggar, Eastern Junggar, Alataw and Altay terranes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

The main features of our proposed scheme include: the low-complexity and dynamic adaptation to the variations of packet-loss levels and QoS-requirements. The low complexity is achieved by using the graph-code with linear time-complexity. To support diverse QoS-requirements and improve the error-control efficiency, we develop the two-dimensional adaptive error-control scheme, which dynamically adjusts not only the error-control redundancy, but also the code-mapping structure. By deriving and identifying the closed-form non-linear expressions for the optimal check-node degree and the required error-control redundancy in each adaptation step as the functions of the packet-loss level, we propose the non-uniformed two-dimensional adaptive coding scheme. Using this scheme, we develop an efficient hybrid ARQ-FEC protocol for mobile multicast services with diverse QoS requirements. Also conducted is a set of numerical and simulation results which analyze and compare our proposed adaptive scheme with those using the non-adaptive graph codes, Reed-Solomon erasure codes, and pure ARQ-based approach. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme can efficiently support QoS-driven mobile multicast services and achieve well-balanced error-control redundancy while imposing low error-control complexity and overhead for mobile multicast services over wireless networks",

        "abstract": "SUMMARY This paper presents a new class of complex- valued compact-supported orthonormal symmlets. Firstly, some properties of complex-valued compact-supported orthonormal symmlets are investigated, and then it is shown that complex- valued symmlets can be generated by real-valued half-band fil- ters. Therefore, the construction of complex-valued symmlets can be reduced to the design of real-valued half-band filters. Next, a design method of real-valued half-band FIR filters with some flatness requirements is proposed. For the maximally flat half- band filters, a closed-form solution is given. For the filter design with a given degree of flatness, the design problem is formulated in the form of linear system by using the Remez exchange algo- rithm and considering the given flatness condition. Therefore, a set of filter coefficients can be easily computed by solving a set of linear equations, and the optimal solution is obtained through a few iterations. Finally, some design examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Fractional delay (FD) filters are an important class of digital filters and are useful in various signal processing applications. This paper discusses a design problem of FD infinite-impulse-response (IIR) filters with the maxflat frequency response in frequency domain. First, a flatness condition of FD filters at an arbitrarily specified frequency point is described, and then a system of linear equations is derived from the flatness condition. Therefore, a set of filter coefficients can be easily obtained by solving this system of linear equations. For a special case in which the frequency response is required to be maxflat at omega = 0 or pi , a closed-form expression for its filter coefficients is derived by solving a linear system of Vandermonde equations. It is also shown that the existing maxflat FD finite-impulse-response (FIR) and IIR filters are special cases of the FD IIR filters proposed in this paper. Finally, some examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed filters.",

The case study of the Lijiang site indicates that the FCR of Lijiang site distributed more widely and discretely before the M7.0 Lijiang earthquake than after it, which reflected strain accumulation and caused poor movement coordination during the seismogenic period. After the earthquake the fault is in a free activity state, and the accumulated strain energy is released, and 3-component movements are consistent to each other. At present, FCR dispersion of Lijiang is low and fault strain accumulation is also at a low level.",

        "abstract": "Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has received increasing interest from the optimization community due to its simplicity in implementation and its inexpensive computational overhead. However, PSO has premature convergence, especially in complex multimodal functions. Extremal optimization (EO) is a recently developed local-search heuristic method and has been successfully applied to a wide variety of hard optimization problems. To overcome the limitation of PSO, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm, called hybrid PSO-EO algorithm, through introducing EO to PSO. The hybrid approach elegantly combines the exploration ability of PSO with the exploitation ability of EO. We testify the performance of the proposed approach on a suite of unimodal/multimodal benchmark functions and provide comparisons with other meta-heuristics. The proposed approach is shown to have superior performance and great capability of preventing premature convergence across it comparing favorably with the other algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate whether single cycle ischemic preconditioning (IP) improves the myocardial preservation in patients undergoing cardiac valve replacement. Methods From August 2002 to April 2006, 85 patients who had chronic heart valve disease and required cardiac valve replacement were randomly divided into two groups. IP group, 47 allocated to receive IP and arrested with 4℃ St.Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution during cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB), preconditioning was accomplished by using single cycle of 2 minutes occlusion of aorta followed by 3 minutes of reperfusion before cross-clamping. Control group, 38 allocated to receive 4℃ St.Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution alone. Myocardial protective effects were assessed by determinations of creatinine kinase-MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin I(cTnI), ST-T changes, ventricular arrhythmias and other clinical data in ICU. Results Serum CK-MB and cTnI concentrations were increased postoperatively in two groups. At 24, 48 and 72h after operation, values of CK-MB in IP group was significantly lower than that in control group (P<0.05), cTnI at 24 and 48h after operation also less in IP group (P<0.05). The duration for patients needed for antiarrhythmic drugs in IP group was lower than that in control group (P<0.05). Compared with control group, fewer inotropic drugs were used in IP group. As a result, ICU stay time in IP group was shorter than that in control group (P<0.05). Conclusion IP enhances the myocardial protective effect when it was used with hypothermic hyper kalemic cardioplegic solution in patients undergoing cardiac valve replacement, IP significantly reduces the postoperative increase of CK-MB, cTnI and plessens the severity of postoperative ventricular arrhythmias.",

Preference elicitation has been proposed as an efficient strategy for eliciting new users preference through an initial interview where new users are queried by elaborately selected items. In this paper, we propose a novel community discovering guided discriminative selection (CDDS) model for constructing query set. We exploit the community as an effective information which is not fully used in existing approaches. By integrating item selection and community discovery into one framework, our model selects most discriminative items for preference elicitation, with guidance of unsupervised community discovering process. To perform community discovering process, the model utilizes rating similarity graph and social network as a graph regular-ization. Experimental results on real-world datasets Flixster and Douban demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional preference elicitation methods for cold-start recommendation.",

        "abstract": "The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment plays an important role in regulating hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which constitute approximately 0.01-0.0001% of the nucleated cells in the adult human BM, are an important component of the BM stroma that supports hematopoiesis. The BM stroma system is often damaged in patients who have undergone high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment. Thus, the BM stroma should be reconstructed during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a potent hematopoietic cytokine that regulates neutrophil generation within the BM by modulating the mobility, proliferation and maturation of neutrophil progenitor cells. The results from our study here show that G-CSF markedly increased the number of donor-derived MSCs in the BM and the peripheral blood. Engraftment was faster in HSCTs with bone marrow that was treated with G-CSF (G-BM) or with G-BM- and G-CSF-treated peripheral blood stem cells compared to stead-state bone marrow (SS-BM). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that G-CSF-mobilized treatment of MSCs may accelerate engraftment in HSCT.",

The supramolecular microgels not only showed temperature-responsive properties as expected from conventional PNIPAm-based microgels but also exhibited stimuli-responsive and degradable properties benefiting from the dynamic nature of supramonomers. In addition, it was found that the degradation kinetics of the supramolecular microgels was related greatly to the structure of the microgels, providing a way to tune the degradation kinetics of the supramolecular microgels.

        "abstract": "Traditionally, Collaborative Filtering assumes that similar users have similar responses to similar items. However, human activities exhibit heterogenous features across multiple domains such that users own similar tastes in one domain may behave quite differently in other domains. Moreover, highly sparse data presents crucial challenge in preference prediction. Intuitively, if users' interested domains are captured first, the recommender system is more likely to provide the enjoyed items while filter out those uninterested ones. Therefore, it is necessary to learn preference profiles from the correlated domains instead of the entire user-item matrix. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, TopRec, which detects topical communities to construct interpretable domains for domain-specific collaborative filtering. In order to mine communities as well as the corresponding topics, a semi-supervised probabilistic topic model is utilized by integrating user guidance with social network. Experimental results on real-world data from Epinions and Ciao demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

An abnormal haematopoietic niche with high adhesion and proliferation might be the root cause of resistance and relapse. Most leukaemia cells are stored in the endosteal niche and recess in the G0 phase, and they are not sensitive to varieties of radiotherapies and chemotherapies. G-CSF and AMD3100 are increasingly used in priming chemotherapy. G-CSF can promote leukaemia cells to the cell cycle, which improves the complete remission rate of leukaemia patients. AMD3100, the novel CXCR4 antagonist, could also potentially promote leukaemia cells to cell cycle and improve the susceptibility of leukaemia cells to chemotherapeutic agents.

        "abstract": "In order to study the influence of different gelatin concentrations, and lymphocyte isolation liquid on primary culture of umbilical cord blood-derived adhesive cells (hCBACs), the red blood cells of umbilical cord blood was separated by 3% and 6 % gelatin for detecting the effectiveness of sedimentation, then the adhesion rate at 48 hours, the day of initial expansion and the rate of culture success were detected for hCBACs cultured with CD34(+) cells after the mononuclear cells were separated by 6% gelatin followed by Ficoll and Percoll, and the morphological characteristics and growth status were observed by invert microscopy. Cytochemistry stain for nonspecific esterase stain (NSE), peroxidase (POX), periodic acid Schiff reaction (PAS) and alkali phosphatase (ALP) and immunocytochemistry labeling for CD31, CD45, CD68 and fibronectin (Fn) were detected. The results showed that 6 % gelatin was better than that 3% gelatin for red blood sedimentation. The Percoll was predominant over Ficoll in adhesion rate at 48 hours, the day of initial expansion, the time of initial formation of adhesive cell colony units, the time of maximal numbers of adhesive cell colony units, the the cell fusion time and ratio of culture success. 60% fibroblast-liked cells, 36% macrophage liked cells and 4% small-round cells were observed in cells isolated by both isolated methods. The cytochemistry stain for NSE, POX, PAS and ALP was similar in two groups, the difference was not statistically significant between these two groups. The immunocytochemistry labeling for CD31, CD45, CD68 and Fn was also similar in both groups and the difference was also not statistically significant between these two groups. It is concluded that the combination of 6% gelatin with Percoll is an ideal separation method for primary culture of hCBACs, which provides basic information for clinical application.",

        "abstract": "The rapid detection of pollutants with high sensitivity and selectivity is of considerable significance for security screening, environmental safety, and human health. In this study, we prepared persistent luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) and constructed a label-free sensor for sensitive and selective detection of pollutants in real samples and test papers. Following excitation, PLNPs could store absorbed light energy and release it in the form of luminescence. Compared with a fluorescence-based technique, a PLNPs-based measurement could effectively avoid background interference. Under optimal conditions, the limit of detection for TNP was found to be 10 nM, while for an antibiotic it was 5 nM. The nanoprobe was successfully applied for the detection of pollutants in real samples including milk and Dianchi Lake water samples. Due to the long-lasting afterglow nature of PLNPs, the signal-to-noise ratio could be greatly increased in complex real samples. By hand-writing with TNP solution as ink on filter paper, the photoluminescence (PL) of the part stained with TNP was immediately quenched. Moreover, after direct exposure under a UV lamp for 10 min and without further excitation, the luminescence of the test paper was investigated to avoid interferents. This PLNP material could be potentially employed as a multi-responsive luminescent sensor. In addition, these easy-to-use visual techniques could provide a powerful tool for a convenient POC assay of organic pollutants.",

Crystalline dimethyl melamine hydrochloride was utilized as the core, while melamine derivatives with different functional groups, such as pyrene, thiophene and naphthalene diimide, served as additives to regulate the core morphology and were adsorbed as the shell. The length and width of these one-dimensional structures can be tuned by varying the molar ratio of core and shell molecules as well as their total concentration. Through X-ray diffraction, the detailed molecular arrangements within the core of the microrods were revealed, and the selective effect of additives on specific crystal faces was evaluated.

The success of SVW services depends heavily on customers' continuance usage, a topic not yet adequately investigated in information systems research. It is unclear to what extent, and how, the existing theories can be extended to explain the continuance usage of such services. In consideration of the distinctive features of these services, this study adapts the dedication-constraint framework of commitment and develops a model of SVW continuance, which is assessed empirically using data collected from 438 experienced users of Second Life, a typical SVW service. Results indicate that SVW customers' continuance intention is jointly determined by two mechanisms: affective commitment being attracted to and calculative commitment being locked in, with the former playing a more central role. Perceived utilitarian value, hedonic value, and relational capital promote affective commitment directly and indirectly through satisfaction, while service-specific investments in personalization and relational capital increase calculative commitment. Theoretical and practical implications and future research directions are subsequently discussed.",

        "abstract": "Unmanipulated HLA-haploidentical/mismatch related transplantation with combined granulocyte-colony stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (G-PBSCs) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor-mobilized bone marrow (G-BM) has been used as an alternative transplantation strategy for patients without an HLA-matched donor. In this transplantation setting, factors associated with hematopoietic recovery have not been defined completely. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors influencing the engraftment in this transplantation setting for patients with leukemia. The study group comprised 104 patients with leukemia who underwent transplantation at a single institution between 2005 and 2008. Factors correlating with neutrophil and platelet engraftment post-transplantation were analyzed retrospectively. All patients achieved an absolute neutrophil count of 500/μL with a mean time of 13.6days (range 8-20days) and a platelet count over 20×10(9)/L with a mean time of 20.2days (range 16-26days). In univariate analysis, donor and age were associated with increased risk of neutrophil engraftment, but their significance was lost upon multivariate analysis. The sex, age, donor, CD34(+) cell dose, conditioning regimen, mismatched locus, ABO mismatched and diagnosis have no effect on platelet engraftment. Our results suggest that it is an ideal approach to treat patients with leukemia with HLA-haploidentical/mismatched related transplantation with combined G-PBSCs and G-BM for a high level of stem cells without delayed engraftment.",

        "abstract": "T-cell lymphomas (TCLs) are a malignancy characterized by tumor aggression and resistance to traditional chemotherapy. Disruption of the extrinsic cell death pathway is essential for resistance to chemotherapy. PIM1 serves as a crucial modulator in cancers. However, the role of PIM1 in TCLs remains unclear. In this study, we studied the roles of PIM1 in established T-lymphoma cell lines Jurkat and HUT-78. CCK-8 assay was conducted to evaluate cell survival and flow cytometry was performed to evaluate cell death of TCL cells. siRNAs were used to knockdown the expression of PIM1 and c-myc. qRT-PCR was used to evaluate the mRNA expression levels of c-myc and PIM1. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the protein expression levels of PIM1, c-myc, STAT3, and phospho-STAT3. Doxorubicin was used to determine the effect of PIM1 on apoptosis. Our results showed that PIM1 expression was markedly enhanced and induced c-myc expression in TCL cells. Doxorubicin inhibited the expressions of c-myc and PIM1, and triggered the extrinsic cell death of TCLs by suppressing the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway. Moreover, PIM1 silencing via siRNA suppressed c-myc expression, promoted the cell death of TCLs, and increased doxorubicin sensitivity. Conversely, PIM1 overexpression in TCL cells induced c-myc expression, suppressed TCL cell death, and promoted doxorubicin resistance. Collectively, our results demonstrate that PIM1 overexpression in TCLs participates in cancer cell protection from apoptosis and leads to doxorubicin resistance by inducing c-myc expression, indicating that PIM1 may be a promising target in TCL treatment.",

The continuous dynamic monitoring is conducted by means of embedded earth pressure piezometers and pore piezometers around the tunnel at different locations and different depths. The response frequency and stress amplitude of the saturated soft clay are studied with the distance from the tunnel due to the subway vibration loading. A formula is proposed for the attenuation of the dynamic response of the soil. The distance of influence and the amplitude of the dynamic response are calculated and the influence on the surrounding buildings under the subway vibration load is predicted, which offers valuable references for the design, the construction and the safe operation of the subway. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group.",

AlCl3·6H2O was retained in the CS/ST film acting as the plasticizer and glycerol were added to form the complex plasticizer with AlCl3·6H2O. The effect of the complex plasticizer of AlCl3·6H2O and glycerol on the crystalline, thermal stability, and mechanical properties of CS/ST films was studied by X-ray diffraction, thermal gravity analysis, and tensile testing, respectively. The results showed that AlCl3·6H2O aqueous solution was a better solvent for CS than acetic acid aqueous solution which is the most commonly used solvent of CS. With AlCl3·6H2O aqueous solution as the solvent, the thermal degradation of CS and ST in the dissolving process was weakened. Glycerol could form the synergism plasticizing effect with AlCl3·6H2O. With the complex of AlCl3·6H2O and glycerol as the plasticizer, the CS/ST film with the good mechanical properties could be obtained.",

The WHO classification recognizes three distinct disorders of LGLs: T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukaemia (T-LGL), chronic lymphoproliferative disorders of NK-cells (CLPD-NK) and aggressive NK-cell leukaemia. Despite the different origin of cells, there is considerable overlap between T-LGL and CLPD-NK in terms of clinical presentation and treatment. Majority of these patients are asymptomatic and may not need treatment. When significant cytopenias occur, the application of immunosuppressive therapy often should be considered. In contrast, aggressive NK cell leukemia and the rare CD56(+) aggressive T-LGL leukemia have a fulminant clinical course and an earlier age of onset, therefore, more intensive combination chemotherapy is required, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, these diseases are relatively rare, there are few clinical trials to guide management. In this review, the pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of this leukemia are summarized and discussed.",

Result Most patients had the history of smoking and drinking, accompanied with hyperlipidemia, hypertension and diabetes. All cases had previous myocardial infarction, and more than half patients had left ventricular hypertrophy and left main coronary artery stenosis. The perioperative mortality and morbidity were 10.7% and 35.7%, respectively. Concomitant operations and longer CPB time and aortic cross-clamping time is culprit of mortality. Conclusion Emergency/urgent CABG is an effective procedure for the patients with acute coronary syndrome. Decreasing the CPB time and aortic cross-clamping time might reduce the perioperative morbidity. Administration of aprotinin is an effective mean to improve the surgical outcome.",

Because vascular function plays an important role in maintaining the circulation post-cardiac surgery and some patients are difficult to stabilize, we hypothesized that a deleterious vascular effect of HDL may contribute to vascular dysfunction in VHD patients following surgery. HDL was isolated from age-match 28 healthy subjects and 84 patients with VHD and during cardiac surgery. HDL pro-inflammation index was measured and the effects of HDL on vasodilation, protein interaction, generation of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide were determined. Patients with VHD received either simvastatin (20mg/d) or routine medications, and endothelial effects of HDL were characterized. HDL inflammation index significantly increased in VHD patients and post-cardiac surgery. HDL from VHD patients and post-cardiac surgery significantly impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, inhibited both Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation at S1177, eNOS associated with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), NO production and increased eNOS phosphorylation at T495 and superoxide generation. Simvastatin therapy partially reduced HDL inflammation index, improved the capacity of HDL to stimulate eNOS and Akt phosphorylation at S1177, eNOS associated with HSP90, NO production, reduced eNOS phosphorylation at T495 and superoxide generation, and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Our data demonstrated that HDL from VHD patients and cardiac surgery contributed to endothelial dysfunction through uncoupling of eNOS. This deleterious effect can be reversed by simvastatin, which improves the vasoprotective effects of HDL. Targeting HDL may be a therapeutic strategy for maintaining vascular function and improving the outcomes post-cardiac surgery.",

For the MDEC-07114 cell under Methomyl, the percentage of G0/ G1was increased while the percentage of S+G2/ M and the cell proliferation index were obviously reduced at the all concentration-groups. From the 1mg / mL groups of Methomyl, the expression of cyclin-D1 was reduced with the increase of the concentration.Therefore, the growth of MDEC-07114 may be inhibited by reducing expression of cyclin-D1 to block cell cycle.",

The potentiometric response is independent on pH of the solution between pH 1 and 5, while it is dependent on the nature of the medium. The electrode has a linear dynamic range between 1 × 10 −5 and 0.1 mol 1 −1 with a Nernstian slope of 29 mV/decade concentration and a detection limit of 7 × 10 −6 mol 1 −1 in acetate buffer (0.2 mol 1 −1 , pH 4.5). Except for Fe 2+ , Fe 3+ and Co 2+ , other common inorganic cations do not interfere in the determination of copper(II). The electrode has the advantages of low resistance, short conditioning time and fast response.",

The levels of IL-6 and IL-8 and the number of leucocytes and neutrocytes were measured. 【Results】 The levels of IL-6 and IL-8 increased significantly 5 min after the declamping of aorta in both groups. However, they were significantly lower in IPC group on the 1st day after operation (P < 0.05). IL-8 in IPC group returned to the preoperative level but was lower than that in the control group on the 3rd day after operation (P < 0.05). The total leukocyte count between the 1st and 3rd day (P < 0.05) and the number of neutrocytes on the 1st day (P < 0.05) of post operation in IPC group were low compared with that in control group. 【Conclusion】 IPC does not decrease the release of cytokine IL-6 and IL-8 during the operation but between the 1st and 3rd day of post operation. The delayed protective effect of IPC may be related to the reduced release of inflammatory cytokines.",

        "abstract": "A combination of the differential Raman spectrometrics and contact-angle measurements has enabled resolution of the hydrogen bond (HB, O:H-O) relaxation and molecular dynamics in the NaX hydration shells. Observations suggest that the aqueous ions create each an electric field to form the hydration shells through O:H-O bond elongation and polarization. The ionic polarization shares the same, and even stronger, effect of molecular undercoordination that shortens the H-O bond and stiffen its phonon, and meanwhile, the O-O Coulomb repulsivity lengthen and soften the O:H nonbond with an association of polarization. O:H-O bond electrification raises not only the structure order of molecules and the viscosity in the hydration shells but also the skin stress and thermal stability of the solution. Exercises not only deepen our insight into the salt solute-solvent interaction involved in the Hofmeister series in terms of O:H-O bond electrification but also provide a powerful means quantifying the dynamic, local, molecular-site-resolved information regarding the O:H-O bond cooperativity in aqueous solutions.

        "abstract": "In edge computing wireless networks, popular data contents can be stored in mobile devices to provide the local data resources services, so that a mobile user can obtain these data contents directly from its nearby mobile devices instead of the remote service provider. Even though each mobile deviceu0027s caching memory can be limited, caching in mobile devices offers the great potential of caching capability because of the massive mobile devices. In this paper, we focus on a single cellular network where mobile usersu0027 requested data contents are cached in nearby peer mobile devices and are served by device-to-device (D2D) communications. We propose the caching in mobile devices schemes through deriving the minimum distance between two actively offloaded mobile user receivers to optimize the D2D throughput while guaranteeing the D2D channel quality. We also quantify the improvements of this offloading supported cellular network in terms of (1) the upper and lower bound of offloading probability, (2) average throughput of offloaded traffic, (3) average content downloading delay, and (4) variance of total number of potential D2D links, which result in more superior network performances than pure cellular networks. Finally, we evaluate and validate the network improvements using our proposed mobile devices caching framework through numerical analyses.",

        "title": "Hydrogen-bond relaxation dynamics: Resolving mysteries of water ice",
        "abstract": "We present recent progress in understanding the anomalous behavior of water ice under mechanical compression, thermal excitation, and molecular undercoordination (with fewer than four nearest neighbors in the bulk) from the perspective of hydrogen (O:H-O) bond cooperative relaxation. We modestly claim the resolution of upwards of ten best known puzzles. Extending the Ice Rule suggests a tetrahedral block that contains two H2O molecules and four O:H-O bonds. This block unifies the density-geometry-size-separation of molecules packing in water ice. This extension also clarifies the flexible and polarizable O:H-O bond that performs like a pair of asymmetric, coupled, H-bridged oscillators with short-range interactions and memory as well as extreme recoverability. Coulomb repulsion between electron pairs on adjacent oxygen atoms and the disparity between the O:H and the H-O segmental interactions relax the O:H-O bond length and energy cooperatively under stimulation. A Lagrangian solution has enabled mapping of the potential paths for the O:H-O bond at relaxation. The H-O bond relaxation shifts the melting point, O 1s binding energy, and high-frequency phonon frequency whereas the O:H relaxation dominates polarization, viscoelasticity, and the O:H dissociation energy. The developed strategies have enabled clarification of origins of the following observations: (i) pressure-induced proton centralization, phase transition-temperature depression and ice regelation; (ii) thermally induced four-region oscillation of the mass density and the phonon frequency over the full temperature range; and (iii) molecular-undercoordination-induced supersolidity that is elastic, hydrophobic, thermally stable, with ultra-low density. The supersolid skin is responsible for the slipperiness of ice, the hydrophobicity and toughness of water skin, and the bi-phase structure of nanodroplets and nanobubbles. Molecular undercoordination mediates the O:H and H-O bond Debye temperatures and disperses the quasi-solid phase boundary, resulting in freezing point depression and melting point elevation. O:H-O bond memory and water-skin supersolidity ensures a solution to the Mpemba paradox hot water freezes faster than its cold. These understandings will pave the way toward unveiling anomalous behavior of H2O interacting with other species such as salts, acids and proteins, and excitation of H2O by other stimuli such as electrical and magnetic fields.

        "abstract": "The hotspot mutation H1047R in the oncogenic PIK3CA gene is frequently detected in breast cancer and enhances the enzymatic activity of PI3K to activate AKT/mTOR signaling cascade. Aberrant elevated PI3K activation has been reported to promote the tumorigenesis of breast cancer, but the mechanisms underlying are still needed to be elucidated. Here, we found that continuously activating PIK3CA conferred human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells to cellular senescence upon serum-starvation. Similarly, breast cancer T47D and HCC1954 cells harboring H1047R mutation were senescent when cells were deprived of serum. PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis but not p53 or RB might be required for the induction of senescence. Notably, membrane metallo-endopeptidase (MME) was identified as a downstream effector of PI3K to mediate the induction of senescence, which might be associated with its glycosylation. Senescent cells elicited a distinct secretome dependent on PI3K and MME. Specifically, IL-6 promoted the proliferation of normal cells and CCL2 induced the M2-like polarization of macrophages, which might create an immunosuppressive microenvironment during the initiation and/or development of breast cancer. This study shed new light on the tumorigenesis induced by hyper-activated PI3K and might provide new clues for the prevention and therapy of breast cancer. This article is protected by copyright.

We can classify these problems into 3 types: 1) Free-riding situation, 2) Non-use situation, 3) Dormant situation. Organizations applied many strategies (e.g. rewards) to encourage people to share knowledge, but there has been no conclusive evidence of the role of them. This paper describes a research-in-progress that aims to 1) explain why and how the different knowledge sharing problems occur in KMS, 2) promote a better understanding of the effect of rewards. By applying game-theoretical models to analyze interactions between participants and doing case studies in KM projects of real organization, this research is expected to contribute with new insights into managing knowledge sharing activities successfully.",

The aim of this study was to identify a Tibet Trichinella isolate at a species level by PCR-based methods. Multiplex PCR revealed amplicon of the expected size (173 bp) for Trichinella spiralis in assays containing larval DNA from Tibet Trichinella isolate from a naturally infected pig. The Tibet Trichinella isolate was also identified by PCR amplification of the 5S ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer region (5S ISR) and mitochondrial large-subunit ribosomal RNA (mt-lsrDNA) gene sequences. The results showed that 2 DNA fragments (749 bp and 445 bp) of the Tibet Trichinella isolate were identical to that of the reference isolates of T. spiralis. The Tibet Trichinella isolate might be classifiable to T. spiralis. This is the first report on T. spiralis in southwestern China. © 2011, Korean Society for Parasitology.",

        "abstract": "Although some strategies of virtual worlds (e.g. Second Life) have been proven to be successful for attracting user acceptance in the western world, the effects of these strategies are questionable in the Chinese environment. When western model based virtual worlds plan business operations in China, they may face challenges such as government policy, law and cultural barriers. From the institutional-based view, this study provides a theoretical framework to explain 3D virtual world strategies in Mainland China, and employs the case study method to explore how the four strategies of virtual worlds (i.e. technology solution, business model, game model and virtual world culture) impact on determinants of user acceptance behavior in the Chinese environment. Two 3D virtual worlds, Second Life (western model based virtual world) and HiPiHi (Chinese local virtual world), are chosen as the cases in this study.",

However, how to make the expanded features more effective and discriminative is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a Sequential Augmented features Learning method (SAL) to implement semantic attribute augmentation. In our SAL method, the augmented non-semantic features are learned one by one under a sequential error-correcting scheme so that we can obtain more discriminating power with very compact expanded features. Extensive experiments are conducted on a public dataset and the results show that our approach achieves encouraging performance.",

        "abstract": "Human umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells (hUCBDSCs), a novel population isolated from CD34(+) cells by our laboratory, exerted an immunosuppressive effect on xenogenic T cells. This study aimed to investigate whether hUCBDSCs play a critical role in the suppression of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). The hUCBDSCs were co-cultured with splenocytes (SPCs) of donor C57BL/6 mice. The aGVHD in the recipient (B6×BALB/c) F1 mice was induced by the infusion of bone marrow cells and SPCs from donor mice following sublethal irradiation. The shift in vivo for hUCBDSCs was detected. The proliferation and cell cycle of SPCs were tested by cell counting kit-8 and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression of CD49b natural killer (NK) cells and CD3 T cells was detected by flow cytometry in co-culture and post-transplantation. IL-4, and IFN-γ were detected by ELISA in the serum of co-culture and post-transplantation. The survival time, body weight, clinical score, and histopathological score were recorded for mice post-transplantation. The hUCBDSCs promoted the proliferation of SPCs and significantly increased the ratio of the S and G(2)/M phase (p < 0.05). The hUCBDSCs significantly increased the expression of CD49b NK cells and IL-4 protein and decreased the expression of CD3 T cells and IFN-γ protein both in vitro and in vivo. The survival time of mice with co-transplantation of hUCBDSCs was significantly prolonged, and decreased clinical and histopathological scores were also observed. The hUCBDSCs were continually detected in the target organs of GVHD. These results suggest that hUCBDSCs possess the capability of suppressing aGVHD, possibly via their influence on CD3 T cells, NK cells, and cytokines.",

Studies using normal bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and an established stromal cell line, have shown that the leukemic cell cycle can be arrested in the G0/G1 phase in BMSCs, although the mechanism is still unclear. We performed this study to determine the effect of primary cultured leukemic BMSCs on the cell cycle distribution of Jurkat cells. Normal and leukemic BMSCs were isolated for culture to create a hematopoietic microenvironment simulating bone marrow in vitro. The normal and leukemic BMSCs induced cell cycle arrest of Jurkat cells in the G0/G1 phase. Suppression subtractive hybridization revealed differential gene expression after the co-culture of cells with normal and leukemic BMSCs. Jurkat cells showed upregulated expression of genes involved in cell cycle control CR6 interacting factor 1 (CRIF1). Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results also showed increased CRIF1 mRNA levels in Jurkat cells co-cultured with either normal BMSCs or leukemic BMSCs compared with a suspension culture group: 5.16 ± 0.75, 6.13 ± 0.63 versus 3.02 ± 0.32, respectively (P < .05). These results indicated cell cycle arrest of Jurkat cells in the G0/G1 phase to be induced by primary cultured leukemic BMSCs associated with increased expression of CRIF1 by leukemic cells.",

The micro morphology of pure starch/PVA film and CaCl(2) plasticized starch/PVA film was observed by scanning electron microscope. The interaction between CaCl(2) and starch/PVA molecules was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The influence of CaCl(2) on the crystalline, thermal and mechanical properties of starch/PVA films was studied by X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and tensile testing, respectively. The results indicated that CaCl(2) could interact with starch and PVA molecules and then effectively destroy the crystals of starch and PVA. Starch/PVA films plasticized with CaCl(2) became soft and ductile, with lower tensile strength and higher elongation at break compared with pure starch/PVA film. The water content of starch/PVA film would increase with the addition of CaCl(2). This is an important cause of the plasticization of CaCl(2) on starch/PVA film.",

        "abstract": "Burkitt lymphoma is a highly aggressive B-cell neoplasm. New therapeutic methods are needed to overcome the adverse effect of intensive chemotherapy regimens. Valproic acid and (-)-gossypol are two kinds of chemical compounds used as new anti-tumor drugs in recent years. To investigate the anti-tumor effect of valproic acid and (-)-gossypol, Burkitt lymphoma Namalwa cells were cultured and treated with valproic acid and (-)-gossypol at different concentrations. The proliferation of Namalwa cells was dramatically suppressed after the combination treatment with 2 mmol/L valproic acid and 5 μmol/L (-)-gossypol. The combined treatment also enhanced intrinsic apoptosis by down-regulating anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Moreover, the autophagy flux significantly increased in Namalwa cells after combined treatment. However, the enhanced autophagy showed little effect on cell survival with present regimen. The results confirmed that combination of valproic acid and (-)-gossypol had synergistic anti-tumor effect to Burkitt lymphoma Namalwa cells. The related mechanisms might include the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and avianized pro-survival role of autophagy.",

A recent study on the ultra-high pressure (UHP) eclogite revealed a short timescale of exhumation (≤10 Ma, ~315 ± 5 Ma). However, controversies still exist on some key questions: (1) the reasonable interpretation of spatially close-outcropped high pressure (HP) and UHP slices with respect to regional geodynamics, and (2) if the previous regional scatter Ar–Ar ages proved the existence of internally coherent sub-belts or troubled by dating on samples with notable 40Ar retention. This study focusses on detailed P–T–time (phengite Ar closure) recovery of samples from a HP eclogite lens and its host rock, the UHP thick-layered eclogite.

        "abstract": "Objective To assess the effect of Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA, Chinese version) in diagnosing and observing the cognitive changes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods The MoCA and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) were taken to all subjects (28 patients with MCI and 29 normal controls) to assess the effect and to compare the sensitivity and specificity of MMSE and MoCA in diagnosing MCI, and to compare the cognitive changes of the MCI patients at the beginning of study and 12 months later. Results The MoCA and MMSE are useful for differential diagnosis between normal control and MCI patients. MoCA was significant for the assessment of visuospacial/constructive abilities ( t = 2.151, P = 0.036), memory ( t = 4.704, P = 0.000), abstraction ( t = 2.787, P = 0.009) and orientation ( t = 3.162, P = 0.003) in comparison among groups. When the cut off point was 26, the sensitivity of MoCA and MMSE to diagnose MCI was 89.29% and 10.71% respectively, while the specificity was 82.76% and 100% respectively. The diagnostic sensitivity of MoCA was significantly higher than MMSE. In MCI patients, the score of MMSE and MoCA after 12 months were lower than baseline, the difference was significant in the MoCA total score ( t = 6.454, P = 0.000), visuospacial/constructive abilities ( t = 5.610, P = 0.000) and language ( t = 4.954, P = 0.000). Conclusion Comparing with MMSE, the sensitivity of MoCA is higher. The decline of the score of MoCA and visuospacial/constructive abilities and language may be a predictor in the conversion of MCI to dementia.",

Pilot study of treatment with oral arsenic named the Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula (RIF) plus ATRA without chemotherapy has shown high efficacy, convenient and economical. This randomized, multicenter, phase 3 noninferiority trial was designed to test the efficacy and safety of an oral RIF and ATRA compared with intravenous ATO for newly diagnosed non high-risk APL patients.   Methods   We conducted a phase 3, multicenter trial comparing RIF plus ATRA with ATO plus ATRA in patients with non high-risk APL (white-cell count, ≤10×109 per liter) between 2014 and 2017. In all, 109 patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to oral RIF (60 mg/kg) plus ATRA (25 mg/m2) or ATO (0.16mg/kg) plus ATRA (25 mg/m2) as induction therapy until complete hematologic remission. Postremission therapy included RIF or ATO on a schedule of 4 weeks on and 4 weeks off and ATRA on a schedule of 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off for 7 months.  The study was designed as a noninferiority trial to show that the difference between the rates of event-free survival (EFS) at 2 years in the two groups was not greater than 10%.   Results   Complete remission was achieved in all 69 patients in the RIF-ATRA group who could be evaluated (3 withdraw during the induction) and in 34 of 36 patients in the ATO-ATRA group (2 died and another one withdraw during the induction) (100% vs. 94.4%,  p = 0.12).  The median follow-up was 32 months. Two-year EFS rates were 97.1% in the RIF-ATRA group (n=69) and 94.4% in the ATO-ATRA group (n=36). The EFS rate difference was 2.7% (95% CI,-5.8% to11.1%). The lower limit of the 95%CI for EFS rate difference was greater than-10% noninferiority margin, confirming noninferiority (noninferiority P=0.0017). There is no difference about relapse rate and overall survival between two groups (all p u003e0.05).   Conclusions   RIF plus ATRA is not inferior to ATO plus ATRA in the treatment of patients with non high-risk APL (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry number, ChiCTR-TRC-13004054).

Flow cytometry-based clonality assessment with immuno-phenotyping encourages and enables the most stringent method of diagnosis and follow-up. The objective of this review is to summarize the recent information of the malignant plasma cell phenotypic profile of MM. The most comprehensive antigens, such as CD19, CD27, CD28, CD45, CD56 and CD117, play a significant role in the characterization of normal and malignant plasma cells. This review also focuses on the association of malignant phenotypic markers with chromosomal aberrations that identify the specific prognostic factors in MM.",

        "abstract": "In the non-time-slotted cognitive radio networks (CRNs), the synchronization between PUs and secondary users (SUs) cannot be guaranteed, resulting in two challenging problems: the reactivation-failure of PUs and the frequently unexpected hand-offs among SUs. The reactivation-failure of PUs is the incident that the SUs cannot detect the PUsu0027 reactivation when the SUs are occupying the channels to transmit their data in non-time-slotted CRNs. The frequently unexpected handoffs among SUs are the events that the SU cannot distinguish between the PUsu0027 reactivation and the other SUsu0027 contention, thus causing many unexpected hand-offs among SUs, which severely degrade the achieved throughput of SUs in non-time-slotted CRNs. Employing the energy-detection based wireless full-duplex spectrum sensing schemes, the PUsu0027 reactivation-failure problem can be efficiently solved, thus guaranteeing the required throughput of PUs. However, the key of CRNs is not only the throughput-guarantees for PUs, but also the throughput-boosts for SUs. To optimize the throughput of SUs in multichannel non-time-slotted CRNs, in this paper we develop the pilot-based full-duplex spectrum sensing (PF-SS) scheme and the pilot-based medium access control (P-MAC) protocol to not only guarantee the required throughput of PUs, but also significantly increase the throughput of SUs in multichannel non-time-slotted CRNs. Using the PF-SS scheme, the SUs can identify whether the PUsu0027 signal or the SUsu0027 signal, thus significantly reducing the frequently unexpected hand-offs among SUs. Then, based on the PF-SS scheme, the P-MAC protocol can significantly increase the throughput of SUs. We conduct extensive numerical analyses to show that our developed PF-SS scheme and P-MAC protocol can significantly increase the throughput of SUs while guaranteeing the required throughput for PUs in multichannel non-time-slotted CRNs.",

Methods: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT GA PCR) was used to detect the expression of HO-1 mRNA and HO-2 mRNA, and protein expression was analyzed semi-quantitatively using immunohistochemistry in placenta tissue of normal pregnancy (control group, n=30) and PIH (PIH group, n=30).Results: RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the relative mRNA levels of HO-1 and HO-2 in placental samples of PIH group were (0.34±0.18) and (0.88±0.57) which had no significant difference compared with those in control group (0.46±0.30) and (0.87±0.28),P>0.05.The expression of HO-1 mRNA was lower than HO-2 mRNA in both groups. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the staining of HO-1 in cell of trophoblast and capillaries were (8.1±2.6) and (1.9±0.5) in PIH group, which had no significant difference compared with those in control group (9.3±2.0) and (2.4±0.3) ,P>0.05; the staining of HO-2 protein in capillaries were (4.5±2.6) in PIH group, which was obviously lower compared with that in control group (6.9±3.7),P<0.05; there was no significant difference between the staining of HO-2 protein in trophoblast in both groups.Conclusion: The decreased expression of HO-2 protein may play a role in the pathophysiology of poor placental perfusion and tissue damage of PIH.",

        "abstract": "Based on 5-year from 2001 to 2005 located observation in different types of forests in karst mountainous area in center of Guizhou Province, China, the annual surface runoff was from 1.765 to 22.934 mm in different forest types and from 10.553 to 11.699 mm in different observed years, with an average of 11.108 mm. The forest surface runoff changed in the order of young forest returned farmland (22.934 mm)> coniferous forest(17.236 mm)>needle and broad-leaved mixed forest (10.770 mm)>evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forest (8.876 mm), which is similar to forests in the same or another bio-climate zones. And it is the common character of karst and nonkarst mountainous forests. The karst shrub forest was different from nonkarst in surface runoff due to mother rock properties. Surface runoff of the types was Summer>Spring>Autumn>Winter, coincided with seasonal distribution of precipitation. Seasonal changing rule of surface runoff coefficients in young forest returned farmland was as same as seasonal distribution of surface runoff, and the rule in coniferous forest and needle and broad-leaved mixed forest was Summer>Spring>Winter>Autumn, and the rule in shrub forest and evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forest was Spring>Summer>Winter>Autumn, and this difference was made by species composition and precipitation distribution. There existed remarkable correlation, accorded to line, between surface runoff in ten days and hydrological factors include precipitation,evaporation and relative humidity, and temperature factors include Max. and Min. and average temperature in air and surface and soil deepth in 5 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm and 20 cm. Results of contribution ratio to surface runoff from multi-variances regression analyses was that temperature is higher than hydrology, and this indicated temperature affected flow of air mass near surface, and influenced further precipitation and forested surface runoff. Influence of layer characteristics in different forest types on annual surface runoff had mutual beneficent and repellency based on community component, structure and development. Annual surface runoff was affected complexly by micro-habitat and surface soil characteristics of plots, and increased by slope of plots rising, and decreased by altitude of plots rising, there had remarkable negative correlation between annual surface runoff and total porosity and capillary pore, and contribution ratio of volume weight to annual surface runoff was-96.54%, based on multi-variances regression analyses.",

        "abstract": "The edge computing techniques have been developed to support the exponentially increasing service demands in the fifth generation (5G) networks by bringing the data contents and their corresponding computations/communications near to mobile users. As a promising and efficient solution to implement edge computing techniques, mobile data offloading complements the traditional cellular transmission through either WiFi networks or device-to-device (D2D) communication/relay to mitigate the overloaded wireless traffics for cellular networks. However, the mobile data offloading in edge computing wireless networks imposes many new quality of service (QoS) guarantee problems which still remain opening research areas. To overcome these challenges, in this paper we propose the statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning schemes using the effective capacity theory for two types of mobile data offloading: WiFi offloading and D2D offloading, where we formulate the WiFi offloading and D2D offloading as the single-hop and two-hop wireless-link statistical QoS provisioning problems, respectively. We also derive the optimal probability of using each type of offloading which maximizes the average effective capacity for all mobile users under the following two scenarios: (1) all mobile users have the same probability of requesting the popular multimedia data contents and have the same probability to become a relay in D2D offloading; and (2) each mobile user has the distinct probability of requesting the popular multimedia data contents and the distinct probability to become a relay in D2D offloading. Finally, we evaluate and validate our proposed statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning schemes over multimedia data offloading architecture through numerical analyses.",

The novel organic/inorganic composite can form stable Langmuir monolayers, but it is significantly distorted when spread onto an air/water interface although the general core-shell structure seems to remain. Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of SEC-1 are readily prepared by transferring the monolayers onto substrates with a transfer ratio near 1. It has been proposed that there exist well-orientated alkyl chains and highly defined layer structure in LB films. Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy at different temperatures indicates that two obvious phase transitions appear near 34 and 47 °C for multilayer LB films of SEC-1. The polyoxoanion can be organized to some extent within LB films with its long axis parallel to the substrate by comparing the IR transmission spectrum with the reflection-absorption spectrum. The one-monolayer LB film of SEC-1 possesses a homogeneous and flat surface morphology, and a water contact angle of 104 ± 3° for odd-layer LB films shows a highly hydrophobic surface.",

It has been shown that a sequence generated by an ICG has a low discrepancy even if the length of the sequence is far shorter than its period. In this paper, we formulate fractional linear congruential generators (FCG), a generalized concept of the inversive linear congruential generators. It is shown that the sequence generated by an FCG is a geometrical shift of a sequence from an ICG and satisfies the same upper bounds of discrepancy. As an application of the general formulation, we show that un- der certain condition, \"Leap-Frog technique,\" a way of splitting a random number sequence to parallel sequences, can be applied",

We found that: (i) the DFPs with a high-spin density at a zigzag-GNR edge and at an atomic vacancy result from the isolation and polarization of the dangling σ - bond electrons of √3 d ( d is the C–C bond length) distance along the edge by the locally and densely entrapped bonding electrons; (ii) along an armchair-GNR edge and a reconstructed-zigzag-GNR edge, however, the formation of quasi-triple-bond between the nearest edge atoms of d distance prevents the DFPs from generation; and (iii) hydrogenation reduces the spin density substantially and turns the asymmetric dumb-bell-like density into the spherical-like p z density. A further C 1s photoelectron spectroscopic purification has confirmed that the generation of the DFPs is associated with two extra peaks of energy states located at the bottom and the top edge of the C 1s band.",

        "abstract": "Recently, both academia and industry are moving their research attention to the fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks - the next new era of wireless networks. The wireless full-duplex transmission, as one of promising candidate techniques for 5G, can significantly boost the spectrum efficiency of the wireless networks, thus providing a powerful thrust to optimize the quality-of-service (QoS) performances for the wireless networks. However, due to the heterogeneity caused by different types of simultaneous traffics over the wireless full-duplex link, supporting QoS guarantees for wireless full-duplex networks imposes the new challenges that we need to provide heterogeneous QoS guarantees for different types of traffics over the same link simultaneously. To overcome the aforementioned problems, in this paper we propose the heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning framework for bidirectional transmission based wireless full-duplex networks. In particular, we formulate the optimization problems to maximize the system throughput subject to heterogeneous statistical delay-bound QoS requirements. Then, we convert the resulted non-convex optimization problem into an equivalent convex optimization problem, solving which we can derive the optimal QoS-driven power allocation scheme to maximize the system throughput while guaranteeing the heterogeneous statistical delay-bound QoS requirements. The extensive simulation results obtained show that our proposed QoS-driven power allocation scheme for heterogeneous statistical delay-bound QoS requirements can achieve larger aggregate system throughput than the scheme for the homogeneous statistical delay-bound QoS requirement over 5G mobile wireless full-duplex networks.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the expression of tribbles homologue 3 (TRB3) and its regulation on endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-induced photoreceptor apoptosis after retinal detachment (RD) using a rat model.RD animal model was created in Wistar rats by subretinal injection of 1% sodium hyaluronate. At various time points after RD, expression of TRB3 was detected by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. TRB3 protein distribution in retina was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RNA interference was used to inhibit TRB3 expression and subretinal injection of lentivirus TRB3 shRNA (LV-TRB3-sh) was performed. The rats were then randomly divided into four groups: normal control group, RD group, vehicle + RD group and LV-TRB3-sh + RD group. The mRNA and protein level of TRB3 as well as Caspase-12 were detected. TdT-mediated fluorescein-16-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used to detect the apoptosis of retinal cells. Retinal outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness was measured to assess retina damage in each group.TRB3 expression and TRB3-positive cell count were significantly increased after RD and peaked at day 3 after RD. The ratio of TUNEL-positive photoreceptors and expression of ERS-induced apoptosis marker Caspase-12 in LV-TRB3-sh + RD group were significantly reduced. The ONL thickness in LV-TRB3-sh + RD group was thicker than that both in RD group and vehicle + RD group.TRB3 expression is up-regulated in retinas after RD and knockdown of TRB3 protects photoreceptors against ERS-induced apoptosis. TRB3 may be a crucial molecule in photoreceptor apoptosis induced by ERS after RD.",

SDF-1/CXCR4 axis has been shown to play critical roles in stem cell mobilization, migration and homing, and in immunoregulation, inflammatory disease, autoimmune disorder, embryonic development, and tumor cell proliferation, migration and location. AMD3100 has been confined effective for the mobilization of HSC and MSC, inhibition of carcinoma growth and metastasis, suppression of some inflammatory and autoimmune disorder. Therefore, further research on AMD3100 will be helpful to understand the effects of bone marrow microenvironment on the pathogenesis of neoplasm, and to restore the traumatic tissues by mobilizing HSC effectively, that might provide a new idea and measure for the treatment of certain neoplasms.

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is thought to be a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is clinically characterised by a decline of memory and other cognitive functions. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered to be the prodromal stage of AD. However, the relationship between AD and MCI and the development process remains unclear. The amygdala is one of the most vulnerable structures in the early stages of AD. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the alteration of the functional connectivity of the amygdala in AD and MCI subjects. We hypothesised that the amygdala-cortical loop is impaired in AD and that these alterations relate to the disease severity. In our study, we used resting-state functional MRIs to investigate the altered amygdala connectivity patterns in 35 AD patients, 27 MCI patients and 27 age- and gender-matched normal controls (NC). Compared with the NC, the decreased functional connectivity found in the AD patients was mainly located between the amygdala and the regions that are included in the default mode, context conditioning and extinction networks. Importantly, the decreased functional connectivity between the amygdala and some of the identified regions was positively correlated with MMSE, which indicated that the cognitive function impairment is related to an altered functional connectivity pattern.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the effects of thrombopoietin (TPO) on the proliferation of megakaryocytic line-HEL cells co-cultured with human umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells (hUCBDSCs), which is supposed to further elucidate the mechanism of TPO-mediated functions. Methods HEL cells were co-cultured with hUCBDSCs, and with human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs), and suspended HEL was used as control. HEL The concentration of TPO in supernatant of hUCBDSCs and hBMSCs was detected by ELISA assay. The expression of c-Mpl membrane-bound protein of HEL cells was detected by laser scanning confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, and the expression of c-Mpl mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. Results It was revealed by ELISA assay that the concentration of TPO secreted by hUCBDSCs was higher than that by hBMSCs, even though the passage was done. The secretion peak in hUCBDSCs group appeared at the 8th day of culturing, somewhat delayed to that in hBMSCs group which the peak appeared at the 6th day. The expression of C-mpl protein displayed uniform green fluorescence on the surface of HEL cell line as determined by laser confocal microscopy, and mean fluorescence intensity detected by flow cytometry was 22.19±2.15, 29.65±0.82 and 37.43±1.69 in HEL suspended culture group, HEL/hBMSCs co-culture group and HEL/ hUCBDSCs co-culture group, respectively. The expression of C-mpl protein in HEL/ hUCBDSCs co-culture group was higher than that in the two other groups (P<0.05). No significant differences of the C-mpl mRNA level existed between different groups (P>0.05). Conclusion TPO-pathway might be the important intermediate process for hUCBDSCs to promote megakaryocyte proliferation. The promotion as such may be realized by up-regulating the c-Mpl expression in translation or post-translational modification phase.",

Very late activation antigen-4 (VLA-4) has been associated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This study aimed to investigate the possible mechanism by in vitro co-cultured splenocytes of donor mice with hUCBDSCs and in haploidentical stem cell transplantation in mice with acute GVHD. Both hUCBDSCs and human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) elicited decreased lymphocyte expression of VLA-4, but this decrease was stronger with hUCBDSCs than with hBMSCs (p<0.05). Cotransplantation of bone marrow with hUCBDSCs significantly decreased the expression of VLA-4 compared with control mice (p<0.05). A significant reduction of VLA-4 labeling in the target organs of GVHD was evident in haploidentical mice cotransplanted with hUCBDSCs. Our study shows that hUCBDSCs may protect mouse recipients of haploidentical stem cell transplantation from aGVHD via downregulating the expression of VLA-4.",

        "abstract": "This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of cholesterol on growth and cholesterol metabolism of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fed diets with cottonseed meal (CSM) or rapeseed meal (RSM). Four experimental diets were formulated to contain 550 g kg(-1) CSM or 450 g kg(-1) RSM with or without 9 g kg(-1) supplemental cholesterol. Growth rate and feed utilization efficiency of fish fed diets with 450 g kg(-1) RSM were inferior to fish fed diets with 550 g kg(-1) CSM regardless of cholesterol level. Dietary cholesterol supplementation increased the growth rate of fish fed diets with RSM, and growth rate and feed utilization efficiency of fish fed diets with CSM. Similarly, dietary cholesterol supplementation increased the plasma total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triiodothyronine levels, but decreased the plasma triglycerides and cortisol levels of fish fed diets with RSM or CSM. In addition, supplemental cholesterol increased the free cholesterol and TC levels in intestinal contents, but decreased the hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase activity of fish fed diets with RSM or CSM. These results indicate that 9 g kg(-1) cholesterol supplementation seems to improve the growth of rainbow trout fed diets with CSM or RSM, and the growth-promoting action may be related to the alleviation of the negative effects caused by antinutritional factors and/or make up for the deficiency of endogenous cholesterol in rainbow trout.",

The IC50 of DNR on Jurkat cell was examen by MTT and the concentration and distribution of DNR in the cell was detected by flow cytometry.When the Jurkat cells were cultured with BMSC for 24 h, we found that Jurkat cells had adhesioned the bone marrow stromal cell layer by parapodium and some of them had nichd the mesh consisted by the confluence of BMSC. At the point of 48 h, some Jurkat cells had migrated to underlayer of BMSC, and Jurkat cells were nichd the mesh of BMSC like nidi. The accumulation and distribution of DNR in the Jurkat cells were not affected in the model, but the reaction of Jurkat cells to DNR were significantly inhibited.The model of CAM-DR based on Acute lymphocyte leukemia bone marrow stromal cells was successfully built.",

        "abstract": "We present an update of our results regarding related HLA-haploidentical and HLA-identical sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients with leukemia. We compared the outcomes of 107 patients with leukemia undergoing HLA-identical sibling (n=51) or related HLA-haploidentical (n=56) HSCT performed during the same time period. Patients received BU-CY/CY-TBI in HLA-identical sibling HSCT or TBI+Ara-C+CY+ATG/CCNU+Ara-C+Bu+CY+ATG in haploidentical HSCT as conditioning regimens, followed by unmanipulated marrow and/or peripheral blood (PB) transplantation. All patients achieved full engraftment. The cumulative incidence of grades II through IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) in the matched and haploidentical cohorts was 13.7% and 26.8% (P<0.05), respectively. The risk of developing cGvHD was not different between HLA-matched and haploidentical patients (P>0.05). The two-year incidence of treatment-related mortality for matched and haploidentical patients was 7.8% and 12.5%, respectively, with P>0.05, and the incidence of relapse was 17% and 22%, respectively, with P>0.05. The two-year adjusted leukemia-free survival for matched versus haploidentical patients was 76% and 68%, respectively, with P>0.05, and the overall survival for matched versus haploidentical patients was 80% and 70%, respectively, with P>0.05. Multivariate analyses showed that only advanced disease stage and a diagnosis of acute leukemia were related to increased risk of relapse, treatment failure, and overall mortality. In summary, HSCT performed with related HLA-haploidentical donors is a feasible approach with acceptable outcomes.",

At the physical layer, we take the MIMO diversity schemes as well its AMC into account. At the data-link layer, our focus is on how this physical-layer infrastructure influences the real-time multimedia QoS provisioning performance such as delay-bound violation and buffer-overflow probabilities. To achieve this goal, we first model the physical-layer service process as a finite state Markov chain. Based on this FSMC model, we then characterize the QoS performance at the data-link layer using the effective capacity approach, which turns out to be critically important for the statistical QoS guarantees in mobile wireless networks. The numerical and simulation results obtained demonstrate that the proposed cross-layer model can efficiently characterize the interaction between the physical layer infrastructure and upper layer protocols' QoS provisioning performance.",

        "title": "Influence of fire on a Pinus massoniana soil in a karst mountain area at the center of Guizhou Province,China",
        "abstract": "The worst drought in 100 years in southwest China occurred in the winter-spring period in the year of 2009—2010,causing forest fires as a secondary disaster.The effect of fire on the physicochemical properties of soil in a artificial secondary forest of Pinus massoniana in the center of Guizhou Province,China was investigated.The trees had an average diameter at breast height(DBH) of 5.6 to 19.4 cm,an average height of 4.11 to 18.60 m,and average density of 500 to 2400 clumps/hm2,and were studied using a comparison of burnt and unburnt plots in a karst mountain area covered by a Quaternary clay.In the surface soil(depth determined by the influence of the fire) of the burnt plots,capillary porosity and total porosity increased,and the soil bulk density and non-capillary porosity decreased,becoming 104.0,102.2,96.0 and 79.9% of their previous values,respectively.The water content of the soil quality and soil volume,and the maximum and minimum values of the soil′s water holding capacity were 92.5,86.9,110.0,and 111.4% respectively.Also,the relative amount of organic matter,total nitrogen,total phosphorus,and total potassium and the pH increased to 130.8,138.0,148.7,108.3,and 101.6% of their previous values,respectively,while the cation exchange capacity was reduced to 74.2%.In contrast,the relative amount of hydrophilic dissolved organic nitrogen,effective phosphorus,available potassium and exchangeable bases were increased,being 185.7,301.7,201.3 and 109.7%,respectively.As a result of the forest fire,the organic matter carbonized,soil biota was reduced,the soil aggregates collapsed and the soil water stability was reduced with changes in the osmotic potential;hence,the texture was degraded in the surface soil.Because of the carbonization of the organic matter of the different litter layers of the burnt forest,a considerable amount of ash,small carbon particles and organic debris covered the surface soil,and infiltrated into the soil through the action of gravity and rain,and as a result the fertility of the surface soil increased.There were two changing trends for soil physicochemical properties: one of them was the influencing factors of the surface soil(IFS) which were much greater than those for the profile soil(IFP),and included variables such as soil bulk density,capillary porosity,total porosity,water contents of soil quality or soil volume,the maximum or minimum water holding capacities,the amount of soil organic matter,total phosphorus,total potassium,hydrophilic dissolved organic nitrogen,available potassium and pH value;the other was when soil properties representing IFS were less than the IFP,such as non-capillary porosity,the amount of total nitrogen,and effective phosphorus,cation exchange capacity and exchangeable bases in the burnt amd non-burnt forest soil.Physicochemical indices of the burnt and non-burnt forest soil rose or fell in the soil profile,and trends simulated either the power or logarithmic curve well.The changes in the physicochemical indices between the burnt and unburnt forest in the surface soil reflected mainly the impact of the fire,and mirrored chiefly the difference of the natural soil properties and the effect of the biological community on the regolith.The coefficients for the relationships between the plant dead ratio of tree layer and the surface soil bulk density(R=-0.8250*,r0.05=0.7545,the same was as follows),the maximum and minimum water holding capacity,(R=0.7615* and R=0.7689*,respectively),the amount of organic matter,(R=0.9035**,r0.01=0.8745,the same was as follows) and total nitrogen(R=0.7558*) were remarkable.The dependence coefficients of the plant dead ratio of shrub layer to the surface soil bulk density(R=0.8547*),capillary porosity(R=-0.7597*),total porosity(R=-0.7629*),water content of soil quality(R=-0.7593*),maximum and minimum water holding capacities(R=-0.9573** and R=-0.9124**,respectively),the amount of organic matter(R=-0.9436**),total nitrogen(R=-0.8335*),total phosphorus(R=-0.7599*),and available potassium(R=-0.7995*) were also notable.The correlation coefficients for the shrub biomass loss ratio to surface soil bulk density,amount of organic matter and available potassium were R=0.7684*,R=0.7763* and R=-0.7600*,respectively.Coefficients for the litter biomass loss to the pH value of surface soil indicated a very strong relationship existed between these two variables(R=0.7550*).In addition,the correlation coefficients for the average DBH of the burnt forest to the surface soil bulk density,capillary porosity,total porosity,water content of soil quality,maximum and minimum water holding capacities,amount of organic matter,were notable,being R=0.8085*,R=-0.8162*,R=-0.8077* and R=-0.9556**,R=-0.9153** and R=-0.9049** and R=-0.8120*,respectively.",

Compared with previous FCL,it has a great improvement on its series compensation. It is composed of a fixed capacitor and several banks of advanced thyristor switched capacitors which are parallel with a bypass reactor controlled by IGCT. The compensation is controlled by the capacitors’ switching on and off in steps,while the current limitation is achieved by inserting a reactor circuit in transmission line. The good performance of this device is proved by the digital simulation using Matlab. The bus voltage sags can also be well improved during the fault due to the fast action of the FCL.",

        "abstract": "Monosomic karyotype (MK) has recently been associated with poor prognosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The objective of the current study was to investigate the prevalence and spectrum of autosomal monosomies in an unselected cohort of patients with known or suspected MDS by using retrospective analysis. The results showed that bone marrow cytogenetic studies (1532 cases) were performed between 2004 and 2012, and an abnormal karyotype was found in 538 cases (35.1%). In the 538 cases, 202 (37.5%) cases had autosomal monosomies including sole (n = 47, 23.3%), part of two (n = 33, 21.3%) or more (n = 122, 78.7%) anomalies. Almost all 22 autosomes were involved, but monosomy 7 was by far the most frequent, constituting 66.1% of all isolated monosomies and the highest fraction of those with two or more abnormalities. Other recurrent sole monosomies included chromosomes 20 (15.0%) and 13 (8.5%). Monosomy 13 (12.5%), 18 (8.3%), 20 (6.3%), 17 (7.3%), 21 (5.2%), 5 (5.2%) and 12 (5.2%) were also recurrent in the setting of 3 abnormalities. Bone marrow histology and clinical information were reviewed in all cases with isolated monosomy; associated clinical phenotypes were found in RCMD (n = 20, 13 were -7), RAEB (n = 12, 11 were -7), RA (n = 9, 3 were -7) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML, n = 6, 4 were -7) cases. Sole monosomy 20 (n = 7, RA 3 case and RCMD 4 cases) was not detected in RAEB or CMML cases. It is concluded that the presence of at least 1 autosomal monosomy was documented in approximately 37.5% of all abnormal cases, which has potential impact on a more than trivial fraction of patients with MDS. The preponderance of monosomy 7 implicates a pathogenetic role for haploinsufficiency of genes associated with chromosome 7. The rarity of sole monosomy involving other chromosomes other than 7, 20, and 13 suggests that haploinsufficiency involving entire chromosomes is detrimental to cell survival, unless their effect is overcome by the presence of other genetic changes that are often associated with additional chromosomal abnormalities. The observation is consistent with the usually favorable prognostic profile associated with sole monosomy 20.",

        "abstract": "Autologous peripheral blood stem cells transplantation (Auto-PBSCT) is a therapeutic option which can be used in various hematological neoplastic disorders; and it can prolong disease-free survival and total survival. Many factors could influence the mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells for patients of Auto-PBSCT. In this study, we investigated the variables influencing the mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells in 240 patients with hematological malignancies who had undergone Auto-PBSCT between 2001 and March 2007 in our center, retrospectively. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia had the most collected mononuclear cells (MNCs) and patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia had the most collected CD34(+) cells than did other patients. However, patients with multiple myeloma had the least collected MNCs and CD34(+) cells. Patients mobilized with chemotherapy with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) plus recombinant human interleukin-11(rhIL-11) had the most collected MNCs and CD34(+) cells. The difference is statistical signification between chemotherapy with G-CSF and chemotherapy with G-CSF plus rhIL-11 for collected MNCs (P<0.05). Adults had the most collected MNCs and CD34(+) cells and the difference is statistical signification between children/adolescent and older, children/adolescent and adult for CD34(+) cells (P<0.05). Male patients had the more collected MNCs and CD34(+) cells and the difference is statistical signification for CD34(+) cells (P<0.05). The adverse events were not serious during mobilization. In conclusion, many factors could influence the mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells, and our findings emphasize the need to optimize harvesting technique to enhance safety and minimize morbidity and costs of this valuable procedure.",

        "abstract": "Big data transmission on a wireless network environment focuses on sharing the large volume information data with the effective capacity guaranteed. Wireless network virtualization provides an efficient technique to implement the big data transmission by enabling multiple virtual wireless networks (VWNs) to be mapped onto one physical substrate wireless network (SWN), downloading the information data from SWN. One of the most important challenges of this technique lies in how to efficiently allocate the wireless resources of physical wireless networks to the multiple virtual wireless network users, considering the quality of service for the data transmission. To overcome these difficulties, in this paper we propose a novel auction based scheme to resolve the wireless resources allocation problem in terms of transmit power and wireless spectrum. We formulate this wireless resources allocation problem as an auction process where each mobile user bids for the limited wireless resources from physical substrate wireless networks, and competes with the other mobile-user players bidding for the same resources. First, the mobile users derive their bids for transmit powers, which indicate their willingness to pay for the transmit powers, aiming at maximizing their payoffs (performance-gain minus cost) on each subchannel. Then, according to the derived available transmit power on each subchannel, mobile users derive their bids for the number of subchannels, aiming at maximizing their overall payoffs. The SWN assigns these two types of wireless resources to each mobile user according to the bids for all virtual users. Finally, as the mobile usersu0027 bidding processes proceed iteratively, our proposed games are guaranteed to converge to the Nash Equilibrium, where the benefits of SWN and mobile users are both optimized, thus maximizing the aggregate effective capacities for our resources-virtualized big data transmission wireless networks. The extensive simulation results obtained validate and evaluate our proposed schemes.",

        "abstract": "Existing recommender systems place emphasis on personalization to achieve promising accuracy. However, in the context of multiple domain, users are likely to seek the same behaviors as domain authorities. This conformity effect provides a wealth of prior knowledge when it comes to multi-domain recommendation, but has not been fully exploited. In particular, users whose behaviors are significant similar with the public tastes can be viewed as domain authorities. To detect these users meanwhile embed conformity into recommendation, a domain-specific similarity matrix is intuitively employed. Therefore, a collective similarity is obtained to leverage the conformity with personalization. In this paper, we establish a Collective Structure Sparse Representation(CSSR) method for multi-domain recommendation. Based on adaptive $k$-Nearest-Neighbor framework, we impose the lasso and group lasso penalties as well as least square loss to jointly optimize the collective similarity.

        "abstract": "In sensor networks, the adversaries can inject false data reports from compromising nodes. Previous approaches for filtering false reports share keys between the source node and its upstream nodes on the path to sink, and rely on intermediate nodes to verify the reports generated by downstream nodes in a probabilistic manner. As a result, false reports have to travel several hops before detected. Worse still, these schemes haven't balanced the overheads of all nodes in the process of keys distributing. In response to these, this paper proposes a cluster-based filtering scheme, in which nodes are grouped into clusters once deployed by employing some strong nodes act as cluster heads. We then proposed a distributed method of keys assignment by constructing a sink-rooted tree which comprises of all the cluster heads, guarantees that the keys of a source cluster are stored by several forwarding clusters close to it and thus to filter false reports generated by the source cluster during several hops during forwarding, further, the number of authentication keys held by the forwarding clusters getting smaller with the distance increase from the source cluster and thus to balance the keys stored by each forwarding cluster. Analysis and simulation results show that our scheme outperforms existing schemes in terms of overhead balance and filtering efficiency.",

Blood was collected from the ophthalmic venous plexus respectively on 7 d, 21 d, 35 d and 49 d after infection and IL-12 in the serum was detected by ELISA. The level of IL-12 in serum decreased in groups of 7 d, 21 d, and 35 d, with a significant difference to the control (P<0.01). However, there was no significant difference between 49d group and control (P>0.05), suggesting that the serum IL-12 of the Trichinella spiralis-infected mice significantly decreased at the earlier stage but approached to normal at a later stage.",

        "abstract": "New prognostic factors are needed to establish indications for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in first complete remission (CR1) for T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) patients. We used microarray to compare T-LBL tissue samples (n = 75) and fetal thymus tissues (n = 20), and identified 35 differentially expressed miRNAs. Using 107 subjects as the training group, we developed a five-miRNA-based classifier to predict patient survival with LASSO Cox regression: lower risk was associated with better prognosis (disease-free survival (DFS): hazard ratio (HR) 4.548, 95% CI 2.433-8.499, p < 0.001; overall survival (OS): HR 5.030, 95% CI 2.407-10.513, p < 0.001). This classifier displayed good performance in the internal testing set (n = 106) and the independent external set (n = 304). High risk was associated with more favorable response to HSCT (DFS: HR 1.675, 95% CI 1.127-2.488, p = 0.011; OS: HR 1.602, 95% CI 1.055-2.433, p = 0.027). When combined with ECOG-PS and/or NOTCH1/FBXW7 status, this classifier had even better prognostic performance in patients receiving HSCT (DFS: HR 2.088, 95% CI 1.290-3.379, p = 0.003; OS: HR 1.996, 95% CI 1.203-3.311, p = 0.007). The five-miRNA classifier may be a useful prognostic biomarker for T-LBL adults, and could identify subjects who could benefit from HSCT.",

Methods Suspension quantitative test was used to observe the resistance of E.coliphage F2 to 7 common chemical disinfectants and to compare parallelly with poliovirus. Results The inactivation logarithm values of E.coliphage F2 and poliovirus exposed to the disinfection solution containing available chlorine 250 mg/L for 10 min were 3.65 and 4.33 respectively.Their inactivation logarithm values were >5.0 and 4.84 respectively after exposure to 2000 mg/L peracetic acid for 5 min,3.79 and 4.33 respectively after exposure to 200 mg/L chlorine dioxide for 10 min,3.52 and >4.0 respectively after exposure to 5000 mg/L glutaraldehyde for 5 min.The inactivation logarithm value of E.coliphage F2 exposed to iodophor containing available iodine 1000 mg/L for 5 min or medical alcohol containing 75%(v/v) ethanol for 3 min was >5. Conclusion The resistance of E.coliphage F2 to chemical disinfectants such as chlorine-containing disinfectant,chlorine dioxide,peracetic acid and glutaraldehyde is slightly higher than that of poliovirus.Indophor and ethanol at conventional dosage can effectively inactivate E.coliphage F2, while bromogeramine and chlorhexidine acetate at conventional dosage can not completely inactivate E.coliphage F2.",

Design Retrospective, observational case series. Participants 70 patients (70 eyes) diagnosed as primary retinal detachment accompanied with cataract. Methods According to the operation mode, patients were divided into group A and group B. Group A included 50 patients (50 eyes) performed with combined surgery of phacoemulsification and vitrectomy. 20 patients (20 eyes) in group B underwent sequential two-step procedures, cataract extraction was performed before vitrectomy, the interval between the two operations was 6 to 11 (mean 8.0±1.9) days. Following-up period was 6 to 40 (mean 14.5±10.2) months. Main Outcome Measures Visual acuity and the postoperative complications. Results The postoperative vision improved or similar to the preoperative vision in the two group patients. In group A, the postoperative best corrective visual acuity (BCVA)in 22 eyes (44%) reached to 0.05 or better, 19 eyes (38%) reached to 0.1 or better, 4 eyes (8%) reached to 0.3 or better. Visual acuity improved from 1 to 7 lines in Snellen lines chart. In group B, the postoperative BCVA in 9 eyes (45%) reached to 0.05 or better, 6 eyes (30%) reached to 0.1 or better, 1 eye (5%) reached to 0.3 or better. Visual acuity improved from 1 to 6 lines in Snellen lines chart. There was no significant difference in the improved visual acuity between the two groups. With 3 years follow-up, IOL implantation or not showed no significantly different in BCVA (P>0.05). Postoperative cataract incidence was higher in the patients without IOL implantation than that in the patients with IOL implantation. Postoperative cataract appeared 6 months after operation in the patients without IOL implantation, while it appeared 14 months after operation in the patients with IOL implantation. There was no significant difference in the postoperative complications between group A and group B. Conclusions Combined surgery is effective and safe for the selected patients of primary retinal detachment accompanied with cataract.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of video delivery among mobile users, the problem of explosive traffic growth becomes more and more serious for the mobile wireless networks. To deal with this problem, in this paper we propose to exploit opportunistic transmission and the idea of crowdsourcing to offload mobile video traffic. Based on this idea, a Quality of VIDEO (QoV) oriented pricing incentive scheme, namely Vbargain, is proposed to stimulate mobile users to deliver video data collaboratively. More specifically, in our scheme, the network is regarded as a Virtual Market, and the video packets are treated as commodities, which are dynamically priced according to their expected marginal gains on the quality of reconstructed video; the process of video delivery is regarded as a sequence of packet transactions which are modeled as two-person cooperative games. Driven by the profit-hunting nature of mobile users, the video data is delivered from the source to its destination. In order to gain deep insight into our scheme, we also analyze the overhead and the influence of start-up capital on the performance of video delivered theoretically, and give its lower bound and upper bound. Our simulation results, based on both the synthetic and real-life traces of mobile users, verify the efficiency of our scheme and analysis.",

        "abstract": "Although the results of surgical treatment in cardiac valve disease continue to improve, the postoperative mortality rate and the rate of complications in patients with advanced valvular heart disease (AVHD) are still very high. We did this retrospective study to summarize the surgical experience of heart valve replacement for patients with AVHD and discuss effective ways to improve the surgical outcome.From January 1994 to October 2003, surgical procedures of heart valve replacement were performed on 227 (136 men and 91 women) patients with AVHD in our Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery. The clinical data of all patients were collected and analysed. Patients' age ranged from 10 years to 77 years. In preoperative cardiac function grading, 157 cases were NYHA III and 70 cases NYHA IV. Fifty-one patients had had cardiac operations. The ultrasonic cardiac graphs showed that 145 patients suffered from moderate or severe pulmonary hypertension and 73 had combined giant left ventricle. Mitral valve replacement was performed in 32 cases, aortic valve replacement in 90, tricuspid valve replacement in 1, combined mitral and aortic replacement in 103 and combined mitral and tricuspid replacement in 1. Nineteen patients also received surgical corrections for other minor abnormalities during the operations. A logistic model was established to evaluate the influence of perioperative factors on the mortality rate.The operative mortality rate was 13.2% (30/227). The main causes of death included multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), low cardiac output syndrome and ventricular fibrillation. From the results of the binary noncounterpart multivariate logistic regression, the following statistically significant factors were found to influence the operative mortality rate: redo operation, age >/= 55 years, preoperative NYHA cardiac function grading, extracorporeal circulation time >/= 120 minutes and postoperative usage of GIK (glucose, insulin and potassium) solution. All factors were risk ones except postoperative application of GIK. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit coefficient of this model was 0.976.The risk factors associated with postoperative mortality rate in the patients with AVHD were redo operation, age >/= 55 years, preoperative NYHA cardiac function grading and extracorporeal circulation time >/= 120 minutes. Postoperative usage of GIK acted as a kind of metabolic therapy and will improve the recovery for patients with AVHD. Active perioperative management and care will play a very important role in reducing the operative risk and improving the short term outcome of surgical treatment for the patients with AVHD.",

        "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks are characterized by stringent battery resource. Owing to a wide range of applications, sensor networks are expected to support variable amounts of traffic loads. The resulting peak loads may drive the network into congestion, leading to high latency whereas low traffic loads cause energy wastage in idle-listening. This paper presents a preamble sampling based Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for wireless sensor networks, which is highly optimized to traffic types and traffic loads in the network. Our MAC protocol exercises various optimization techniques on the preamble length based on traffic requirements. We present an analytical modeling of the protocol and derive the optimum performance parameters, which are validated using real implementation on a COTS sensor node platform. We also present in-depth simulation results for performance metrics such as power consumption, latency and delivery rates. These results adhere to our real hardware implementation results. A comparative analysis of our protocol against other state-of-the-art sensor network MAC protocols is presented in the paper to show the gains of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   With the aid of differential phonon spectrometrics (DPS) and surface stress detection, we show that HI and NaI solvation transforms different fractions of the H O stretching phonons from the mode of ordinary water centred at ∼3200 to the mode of hydration shell at ∼3500 cm −1 . Observations suggest that an addition of the H ↔ H anti-hydrogen-bond to the Zundel notion, [H(H 2 O) 2 ] + , would be necessary as the H O bond due H 3 O +  has a 4.0 eV energy, and the H ↔ H fragilization disrupts the solution network and the surface stress. The I −  and Na +  ions form each a charge centre that aligns, stretches, and polarize the O:H O bond, resulting in shortening the H O bond and its phonon blue shift in the hydration shell or at the solute-solvent interface. The solute capabilities of bond-number-fraction transition follow: f H  = 0, f Na  ∝ C, and f I  ∝ 1 − exp(−C/C 0 ) toward saturation, with C being the solute molar concentration and C 0  the decay constant. The f H  = 0 evidences the non-polarizability of the H +  because of the H ↔ H formation. The linear f Na (C) suggests the invariance of the Na +  hydration shell size because of the fully-screened cationic potential by the H 2 O dipoles in the hydration shell but the nonlinear f I (C) fingerprints the I −  ↔ I −  interactions at higher concentrations. Concentration trend consistency between Jones–Dole’s viscosity and the f NaI (C) coefficient may evidence the same polarization origin of the solution viscosity and surface stress.",

        "abstract": "The grafting method is widely adopted for developing lignin-based polymer materials with high properties. Aimed at studying various initiators (Fenton, K2S2O8, H2O2-CaCl2) effects on calcium lignosulfonate from eucalyptus (HLS-Ca) in graft copolymerization, HLS-Ca was treated by the above initiators, respectively. Changes in the functional composition of HLS-Ca were investigated by using Difference UV, FTIR, UV spectroscopy and intrinsic viscosity ([η]) methods. The results show that the changes in the structure and reactivity of HLS-Ca were observed due to some certain reactions between it and initiators. Under our experimental conditions, the benzene ring stable against the oxidation of Fenton and K2S2O8 initiators; the content of phenolic hydroxyl (Ph-OH) group decreases under the incubation of Fenton and K2S2O8 initiators though it’s not oxidized to the structure like quinone; the content of aryl-ether, [η] and viscosity-average molecular weight (Wη) increase. Under the treatment of H2O2-CaCl2 initiator, the content of Ph-OH group decreases dramatically and it could be transformed to carbonyl structure. The destruction of benzene ring results in the decrease in the [η] and Wη for HLS-Ca.",

        "title": "The Central Tianshan Block: A microcontinent with a Neoarchean-Paleoproterozoic basement in the southwestern Central Asian Orogenic Belt",
        "abstract": "Abstract   The Central Tianshan Block (CTB) is one of the major continental constituents of the western Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). Its nature and origin is essential for understanding the accretionary processes and the reconstruction of the architectural framework of the CAOB. The Wuwamen Metamorphic Complex (WMC), which is believed to represent the basement of the CTB, was incorporated into the Wuwamen ophiolitic melange during the Paleozoic evolution of the South Tianshan Ocean. The WMC is mainly composed of amphibolite-facies volcano-sedimentary rocks, including migmatites, orthogneisses, amphibolites, schists and locally marbles. Zircon U–Pb geochronology suggests that the protoliths of the interlayered biotite-two feldspar and biotite-plagioclase-hornblende gneisses in the Yangjuan area were formed between 2529 and 2513 Ma and overprinted by amphibolite-facies metamorphism between 1815 and 1809 Ma. Subsequently, the gneisses were intruded by ∼1724 Ma meta-mafic dykes and ∼787 Ma leucogranite dykes/veins. Geochemical data reveal that the biotite-two feldspar gneisses have high-silica adakite affinities with high SiO 2  and Na 2 O contents as well as high Sr/Y ratios (61–117) and slightly evolved zircon Hf isotopic compositions. Consequently, they are interpreted to be the products of partial melting of relatively old subducted oceanic crust. In contrast, the interlayered biotite-plagioclase-hornblende gneisses have high MgO, Cr, Co and Ni contents and prominent negative Nb–Ta–Ti anomalies, indicating derivation from partial melting of an ancient sub-continental lithospheric mantle in a continental arc setting. The ∼1.72 Ga meta-mafic dykes have geochemical similarities of typical Fe-Ti basalts and are characterized by incompatible element enrichments and primitive Sr–Nd–Hf isotopic signatures (( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i  = 0.703446 − 0.703535); ɛ Nd (t) = +6.49 to +6.90; zircon ɛ Hf (t) = +0.57 to +10.6), which is consistent with partial melting of a relatively fertile, isotopically depleted asthenospheric mantle in a post-collisional extensional setting. In addition, the ∼787 Ma leucogranites are trondhjemitic in composition and display extremely low total REE contents and highly evolved Nd–Hf isotopic signatures (ɛ Nd (t) = −4.71 to −4.53; zircon ɛ Hf (t) = −19.4 to −13.0). They are thought to have no petrogenetic relationship with the host orthogneisses and to be products of a foreign melt injection. Our new data provide robust evidence for a Neoarchean–Paleoproterozoic basement of the CTB. Comparison of the tectono-thermal-magmatic events reveals that the CTB and the Tarim Craton have a partly overlapping Precambrian crustal evolution, and thus the CTB could have originated from the Tarim Craton. However, a major difference between both is the presence of juvenile Mesoproterozoic magmatism in the CTB and its absence in the Tarim Craton and, therefore, further geological and geochronological research is required to determine the precise origin of the CTB and its tectonic affinity with adjacent terranes in the western CAOB.",

It was usually misdiagnosed as the co-existence of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) and CML. In the present study, we report a patient with CML, who developed extramedullary T-lymphoblastic blast crisis and was successfully treated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched stem cell transplantation. The patient was a 44-year-old man who presented with lymphadenectasis and leucocytosis prior to diagnosis. The bone marrow smear, biopsy and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of Breakpoint Cluster Region/ Abelson murine leukaemia (BCR/ABL) supported the diagnosis of CML in the chronic phase, while the immunohistochemistry of lymph nodes supported the diagnosis of T-LBL. The FISH test for BCR/ABL in lymph node blast cells was performed and the result was positive; therefore, the patient was diagnosed with extramedullary T-lymphoblastic blast crisis of CML. After several courses of combined chemotherapy, the patient was treated with HLA-mismatched stem cell transplantation and obtained continuous remission for 51 months until the present (September 2013).",

        "abstract": "Despite the improvements in transplant immunology and clinical and supportive care, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is still among the most common causes of overall mortality and morbidity after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. The development and severity of GVHD are strongly related with post-transplant outcomes. New strategies should be explored to overcome GVHD. Regulatory T cells (Treg cells), as dedicated suppressors of diverse immune responses and inflammation and important gatekeepers of immune homeostasis, contribute to the prevention of graft rejection and induce transplantation tolerance. Foxp3, a transcription factor, is predominantly expressed in Treg cells and is a master regulator of the development and function of Treg cells. Foxp3 mutations and Foxp3 deficiency lead to lethal autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease, which results from a defect in Treg cells. TGF-β1 is required to maintain Foxp3 expression in Treg cells. We isolated a novel population from among CD34(+) cells in our laboratory, referred to as human umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells (hUCBDSCs), which exert an immunosuppressive effect and can notably increase Foxp3 expression in Treg cells. Our previous study also revealed that hUCBDSCs constantly secrete TGF-β1. Based on the literature searchings and our experimental findings, we hypothesize that hUCBDSCs, which secrete a high level of TGF-β1, modulate the Foxp3 expression of Treg cells through the TGF-β1/Smad3 pathway to regulate GVHD.",

        "abstract": "The software defined network (SDN) has emerged as an efficient network technology capable of supporting the dynamic nature of network functions while lowering the operating costs through simplified hardware, software, and management. The SDN is an efficient implementing technique for network function virtualization, because SDN maximizes network utilization by decoupling the wireless network infrastructure from the service that it provide, so that differentiated services can share the same infrastructure. One the other hand, information-centric network technique can reduce duplicate transmissions for popular contents by adopting caching strategy and enabling mobile-users to access popular contents from caches of nearby network gateways. One of the main challenges of implementing SDN is how to transmit the time-sensitive multimedia data with the delay-bounded quality of service (QoS) guaranteed in SDN environments. To overcome these difficulties, we propose an information-centric wireless network virtualization technique, which integrates the wireless network virtualization with information-centric networking. We formulate this data transmission problem over virtualized information-centric wireless network as follows. The mobile-user requests the data-source from the network controller. Network controller finds this data-source (located at the end host or a cache), and sets up a data delivery path for the mobile-user. We apply the effective capacity theory to measure the delay-bounded QoS for time-sensitive multimedia data transmission. The data delivery path is established based on a flexible network architecture, which can maximize the effective capacity, for the delivered data. In the delivery process, the data can be copied and stored in a network node as the cache for other mobile-users requests, aiming at minimizing the average transmit power consumption over all mobile-users.",

In this article, we realized the fabrication of cross-linked supramolecular polymers through photo-initiated thiol-ene click reaction of quadruple hydrogen bonded supramonomers. It is found that the cross-linked supramolecular polymer has a higher critical polymerization concentration than the linear supramolecular polymer, because the orientation of the trifunctional monomer leads to cyclize at low concentrations. It is anticipated that this research can enrich the methodology of fabricating cross-linked supramolecular polymers and provide a new phenomenon to understand the self-assembling behavior of cross-linked supramolecular polymers.",

        "abstract": "The information-centric network techniques enable the in-network caching mechanism to cache the popular data contents in the mobile devices. Even though each mobile deviceu0027s caching memory can be limited, caching in mobile devices offers the great potential of caching capability because of the massive mobile devices. Using caching in mobile devices, a mobile user can obtain its requested files from other mobile users through device-to-device (D2D) communication instead of the remote data-source provider, which significantly reduces the duplicate data traffics in the core network and through base stations. In this paper, we use the distributed mobile devices caching, where we randomly distribute and store the popular data contents in mobile devices of a cellular network. To avoid the interference among D2D communications, we partition the entire wireless cell into several squarelets and only activate the D2D connections within each squarelet. Then, we derive the expected number of mobile users in a squarelet and develop a primal-dual adaptive algorithm to maximize the overall spectrum efficiency for these mobile users with unknown wireless channel conditions. To evaluate the performance of our proposed adaptive algorithm, we compare our obtained spectrum efficiency with the spectrum efficiency under the optimal situation where all wireless channel conditions are given. Our proposed algorithm can guarantee the smallest ratio for the obtained spectrum efficiency under these two situations, showing the performance lower bound of our proposed adaptive algorithm.",

Therefore, this paper investigated the effects of three main operable factors, irradiance, integration delay time and the rate of flow per unit area on the measurement of pulverized coal flow by LIBS based on orthogonal experiments. Pulverized coal was chosen for the experimental sample and the statistic analysis and variance analysis were performed. Experiment indicates that the irradiance and integration delay time are two remarkable factors for the effective excitation rate and the following is the rate of flow per unit area. The optimum parameters of control from the experiment are the irradiance of 9.4×1011 W/cm2, the integration delay time of 1500 ns, and the rate of flow is selected reasonably based on economy principles. The results obtained demonstrate that the method can direct the practical measurement of pulverized coal flows in real time.",

We performed a retrospective multicentre study on patients with SOS after allo-HSCT in China. The incidence, risk factors, and outcomes were compared between HID HSCT and matched related donor (MRD) HSCT. SOS developed in 0.4% of patients (HIDs: 0.4%, MRDs: 0.5%, p = 0.952) at a median time of 21.50 days (range, 1-55) after allo-HSCT (HIDs: 24 days, MRDs: 20 days, p = 0.316). For patients diagnosed with SOS, the 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 22.7% and 22.4% in patients receiving HID and MRD transplantation, respectively (p = 0.584). Overall survival (OS) at 2 year was 10.4% and 38.5% in the two groups (p = 0.113). The transplant-related mortality (TRM) at 100 days was 60.9% in the HID group and 38.5% in the MRD group (p = 0.178). According to the multivariate analyses, significant independent risk factors for the occurrence of SOS were delayed platelet engraftment (p = 0.007) and advanced disease status at the time of HSCT (p = 0.009). The outcomes of SOS after HID HSCT are similar to those after MRD HSCT.",

        "abstract": "The lifting scheme is well-known to be an efficient tool for constructing second generation wavelets, and is often used to design a class of biorthogonal wavelet filter banks. For its efficiency, the lifting implemantation has been also adopted in the international standard JPEG2000. It is known that the orthogonality of wavelets is an important property for many applications. This paper presents how to implement two band IIR orthogonal wavelet filter banks according to the lifting scheme. It is shown that a class of IIR orthogonal wavelet filter banks can be realized by using allpass filters in the lifting steps. Thus, the proposed filter banks have ap- proximate linear phase responses. Finally, the proposed IIR orthogonal wavelet filter banks are applied to image lossless compression, and the coding performance is investigated.",

        "abstract": "We show phonon spectrometrically that the unprecedented H2O: <-> :O:H- compression resolves the performance of the base solution networks with \":\" being the electron lone pair of oxygen. At hydration, LiOH, NaOH, KOH molecules dissolve each into a :O:H- hydroxide and cations of Li+, Na+, and K+, respectively. The cations serve as charge centers to polarize the neighboring water molecules and raise the solution skin stress (or surface tension). The tetrahedron adds, however, three lone pairs and one bonded H+ proton to the solution matrix, turning the initially 2N lone pairs into 2N + 3 and the 2N bonded H+ into 2N + 1 with an additional O2- anion. This hydration process breaks the conservation of the 2N lone pairs and protons with two extra lone pairs that only can form a H2O: <-> :O:H- super hydrogen bond (super-HB) with strong repulsivity. In addition to the H-O bond of the :O:H- featured at 3610 cm(-1), the internal H2O: <-> :O:H- compression has an identical effect of mechanical compression, shortening the O:H nonbonds and stiffening their phonons from below 200 cm(-1) to the above. Meanwhile, compression lengthens the network H-O bonds and softens their phonons from above 3150 cm(-1) to below. The network H-O bonds elongation decreases their energy from similar to 4.0 to similar to 2.7 eV at hydration, which heats the solution as one often observes. The H2O: <-> :O:H- super-HB compressor and the alkali cation polarizor form the keys to the base hydration networks and the properties. 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, recommender systems have become popular to handle the information overload problem of social media websites. The most widely used Collaborative Filtering methods make recommendations by mining users’ rating history. However, users’ behaviors in social media are usually implicit, where no ratings are available. This is a One-Class Collaborative Filtering (OCCF) problem with only positive examples. How to distinguish the negative examples from missing data is important for OCCF. Existing OCCF methods tackle this by the statistical properties of users’ historical behavior; however, they ignored the rich content information in social media websites, which provide additional evidence for profiling users and items. In this paper, we propose to improve OCCF accuracy by exploiting the social media content information to find the potential negative examples from the missing user-item pairs. Specifically, we get a content topic feature for each user and item by probabilistic topic modeling and embed them into the Matrix Factorization model. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm can achieve better performance than the state-of-art methods.",

It is interesting to see that not only two-generation dendrimers but also one-generation dendrimers can be fabricated into thin films by self-deposition. Fluorescence spectra indicate that increasing the generation number of a dendrimer can effectively control the quenching of the fluorescence. Moreover, the fluorescence property of the diphenylanthracene core of the dendrimers in a solid film is quite similar to that of one in a solution, which is important for designing light-emitting materials.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the therapeutic effects of transplantation of haploidentical allogeneic stem cells, and the difference between those collected from peripheral blood and from bone marrow. Methods Fifty-six patients with leukemia, admitted to Department of Hematology of Xinqiao Hospital from Jun. 2006 to Dec. 2008, were enrolled as recipients who received transplantation of haploidentical allogeneic stem cells, with their family members including, parents, brothers or sisters as the donors. All donors were given subcutaneous injection of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for stem cells mobilization. Subsequently, stem cells in peripheral blood were isolated and collected with CS-3000 plus blood cell separation machine when the number of mononuclear cells (MNC) reached over 4.0×109 per liter, and they wer given to recipients within an hour. According to different collection methods in collecting stem cells from bone marrow, 56 donors were divided into 3 groups: bone marrow of Group 1 (n=5) was filtered with Lu Dao-pei's method (filter bone marrow with an injection needle), that of Group 2 (n=6) was filtered with Thomas' method (filter bone marrow with stainless steel strainer), and that of Group 3 (n=43) was filtered with the improved method (syringe needle and stainless steel strainer were replaced with transfusion set with stainless steel mesh). The erythrocytes of bone marrow should be removed by hydroxyethyl starch (HES) precipitation when major ABO incompatibility was found, while the plasma should be removed when there was minor ABO incompatibility. The stem cells were isolated from bone marrow and infused to recipients within 4 hours after collection. Results The median volume of collected peripheral blood was 56ml, the median amount of MNCs was 5.15×108/kg, and the median amount of CD34+ cells was 5.80×106/kg, and the median volume of 950ml of bone marrow, including a median number of 10.31×108/kg of nucleated cells and a median number of 11.33×106/kg of CD34+ cells, were collected from 56 donors. A total amount of CD34+ cells reached to 13.42×106/kg as obtained from peripheral blood and bone marrow. The quality of nucleated cells and CD34+ cells showed no significant difference as isolated by the 3 different methods. Major ABO imcompatibility was found in 15 cases and minor ABO imcompatibility in 17 cases, while the stem cells were effectively isolated from them. Among 56 recipients received stem cell transplantation, 2 died of intracranial hemorrhage 21 days after transplantation, and in 54 patients full donor chimerism developed on day 30 after transplantation and achieved complete hematopoietic reconstitution. Conclusions Transplantation of haploidentical allogeneic stem cells, collected from peripheral blood and bone marrow, may lead to a complete hematopoietic reconstitution in the patient with leukemia. The transfusion apparatus with filter as used in the present study for stem cell collection is feasible and effective, with which the quality of nucleated cells and CD34+ cells isolated is the same compared with that isolated with traditional methods.",

RELATO DE CASO: Descrevemos aqui um caso de LPA com globulos brancos elevados no exame de sangue e a morfologia variante hipogranular na medula ossea, juntamente com fms-like tirosina-quinase-3 com mutacoes de duplicacao em tandem interna (FLT3-ITD) e a isoforma bcr-3 de PML- RARα. Mais importante, detectamos alto nivel de gene do tumor de Wilms (WT1) em blastos medulares por RT-PCR (reverse transcription polimerase chain reaction). Ate agora, nao ha conclusoes claras sobre a associacao entre os niveis de expressao WT1 e APL. Este paciente recebeu sucessivamente regime de tratamento combinado, de hidroxicarbamida, trioxido de arsenico e idarrubicina e citarabina, alcancando finalmente a remissao completa. Infelizmente, em seguida, ele morreu de repente de hemoptise macica devido a uma infeccao pulmonar. CONCLUSAO: Com base em nossos resultados e numa revisao da literatura, a funcao anormal de WT1 pode ser um fator de alto risco em casos de APL.

        "abstract": "There are significant regional disparities in the level of technology availability and utilization in China. This study analyzes determinants of technology availability and utilization in China's 31 administrative units using data on technology adoption and socioeconomic factors. It examines the extent of spatial autocorrelation on technology levels and regression residuals, and provides exploratory spatial cluster analysis of technology attributes interpreted by four regional policy approaches. An exploratory conceptual model is established, based on diffusion of innovations theory and prior digital divide research. Regression findings indicate the most significant determinant of technology availability and utilization is export commodities value. This is followed by published books, tertiary employment, non-state-owned employment, and innovation funds of enterprises. The conceptual model is discussed in light of these findings and suggestions are offered for China's technology policy.",

        "abstract": "To investigate phenotype, cell differentiation and cytogenetic properties of bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) separated from the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. And to analyze cytogenetic aberration of MSC derived from MDS (MDS-MSC) and its mechanism in pathogenesis of MDS.Adherent MSC from both myelodysplastic (n = 22) and normal (n = 7) marrow were obtained by a stromal culture procedure. Morphological features were observed by optical microscope. The cell-surface antigens were performed by flow cytometer(FCM). Adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential of MSC were identified under specific induction conditions. Standard cytogenetic analysis of both hematopoietic cells and MSC were performed by trypsin-Giemsa (GTG) banding. The karyotype analysis DNA content was determined by FCM to verify the results.The morphology of MDS-MSC was typical slender spindle-shaped cells, MSC obtained from MDS patients had a MSC immunophenotype, lacked the expression of hematopoietic antigens-CD34, CD45 and expressed MSC markers, such as CD73, CD90, and CD105. MDS-MSC layers showed the capability to differentiate towards adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts. Cytogenetic aberrations were observed in MSC from 14 (64%) MDS patients, usually involve the loss of chromosomal material (92%), and the clonal loss (7 cases, 50%). Two cases of structural aberrations were also detected. Abnormal karyotypes in MSC were still more frequently identified in abnormal hematopoietic cells group (12 out of 13, 92% vs 3 out of 9, 33%, P < 0.05). There were not exactly the same type of chromosomal aberrations between hematopoietic cells and MSC, but different type of the aberrations in the same chromosome were involved.MDS-MSC retains the phenotyping characteristics and differentiated function of normal MSC, but has different type of chromosomal abnormalities. A high proportion of loss of chromosomal may be a marker of chromosomal instability of MDS-MSC. Detection of abnormalities in MDS-MSC suggests enhanced genetic susceptibility of these cells in MDS. This may indicate potential involvement of MSC in the pathophysiology of MDS.",

Larvae were collected from the mouse muscles using the method recommended by International Commission on Trichinellosis (ICT-digestion). Different settling vessels, temperatures, sieves and digestion time were examined for effect on the recovery of T. spiralis larvae from muscle tissue. The larval recovery rate by conical cylinders was significantly higher than separatory funnels (t=33.090, p<0.05), and optomal larval recovery was obtained with #40 (425 μm mesh) sieve at a reduced temperature (43 ℃, p<0.01). Higher larval recovery rate was obtained with a longer digestion time (2 h). The improved digestion protocol was applied to test the meat samples containing 0.1 or 1 lpg and showed 100 % larval recovery.",

In the supramolecular complex between CB[8] and a derivative of 1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-]pyrrole (DPP), the carbonyl groups of CB[8] and the DPP moiety are brought together through the formation of a folded conformation. In this way, the electrostatic effect of the carbonyl groups of CB[8] is fully applied to highly improve the reactivity of the DPP radical cation, which is the key intermediate of Fenton oxidation. As a result, the Fenton oxidation is extraordinarily accelerated by over 100 times. It is anticipated that this strategy could be applied to other radical reactions and enrich the field of supramolecular radical chemistry in radical polymerization, photocatalysis, and organic radical battery and holds potential in supramolecular catalysis and biocatalysis.",

        "abstract": "The hydrophobically associating water-soluble acrylamide-modified copolymers (PASA) with butyl styrene (BS) and sodium-2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulphonate (NaAMPS) were synthesized by the micellar free radical copolymerization technique. The two key problems including the very poor water-solubility and thermal stability of the hydrophobically associating water-soluble polymers are overcome in this study, which are due to the incorporation of the anionic monomer NaAMPS into the PASA molecules and the phenyl group from BS which can stabilize the hydrophobic units. The influence of reaction conditions on the apparent viscosity of PASA aqueous solution was studied, and the suitable reaction parameters including mole percentage of NaAMPS, mole percentage of BS, mole percentage of initiator, relative to total monomers, mass percentage of total monomers in water, mass percentage of surfactant in water, reaction temperature, pH value and reaction time were 10%, 2.5%, 0.07%, 10%, 6.0%, 50°C, pH 6-7 and 12 h, respectively. Under the above reaction conditions, the polymer was synthesized, which critical association mass concentration was about 0.05 g·dl -1. The apparent viscosities of 0.05 g·dl -1 and 0.1 g·dl -1 PASA aqueous solution were 283 mPa·s and 1020 mPa·s, respectively. The synthesized product was characterized with UV, FT-IR, 1H-NMR and elemental analysis. The block-structure of the polymer was shown by DSC measurement, which was favourable to the intermolecular hydrophobic association.",

        "abstract": "Previous study showed that Trichinella spiralis proteasome subunit beta type-7 (Tspst) gene is an up-regulated gene in intestinal infective larvae (IIL) compared to muscle larvae (ML), which was screened by using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and confirmed by real-time PCR. Tspst may be related to the larval invasion of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). The aim of this study was to identify Tspst and to investigate its immune protection against intestinal T. spiralis infection.The Tspst gene encoding a 29 kDa protein from T. spiralis infective larvae was cloned, and recombinant Tspst protein (rTspst) was produced in an Escherichia coli expression system. The rTspst was used to immunize BALB/c mice. Anti-rTspst antibodies were used to determine the immunolocolization of Tspst in the parasite. Transcription and expression of Tspst at T. spiralis different developmental stages were observed by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence test (IFT). The in vitro or in vivo immune protection of anti-rTspst serum or rTspst against intestinal T. spiralis infection in BALB/c mice was evaluated.Anti-rTspst serum recognized the native Tspst protein with 29 kDa in ML crude antigens. Transcription and expression of gene was observed at all T. spiralis different developmental stages (IIL, adult worms, newborn larvae, and ML). An immunolocalization analysis identified Tspst in the cuticle and internal organs of the parasite. An in vitro invasion assay showed that, when anti-rTspst serum, serum of mice infected with T. spiralis or normal mouse serum were added to the medium, the invasion rate of the infective larvae in an IEC monolayer was 25.2%, 11.4%, and 79%, respectively (P < 0.05), indicating that anti-rTspst serum partially prevented the larval invasion of IECs. After a challenge infection with T. spiralis muscle larvae, mice immunized with rTspst conferred a 45.7% reduction in adult worm burden in intestines.In the present study, Tspst was first identified and characterized. Tspst is an invasion-related protein of T. spiralis IIL and could be considered as a potential vaccine candidate antigen against intestinal T. spiralis infection that merits further study.",

Methods Fetal hUCBDSCs were cultured with either standard or modified Dexter-type cultures. Cell growth was observed by an inverted microscope and the morphological characteristics were detected by Wright′s staining. The cells were then identified by cytochemistry and immunocytochemistry. Results The number of adherent cells cultured for 48 h, initial time of cellular extension, and time of primary culture in the modified cultures were superior to those in the standard cultures. The adherent cell colonies appeared by days 9 to 14 (mean 12.1 days), reached to their maximum levels at days 15 to 21 (mean 19.4 days), and then spread all over the bottom of the dishes by day 28. The cells were mostly differentiated into fibroblast-like cells, macrophage-like cells, and small round cells. Cytochemistry assay revealed that the positive rate was 100% in both NSE and PAS stain. hUCBDSCs were positive in 26% of ALP stain but negative in POX. Immunocytochemistry stain revealed that the positive rate of hUCBDSCs was 96% for CD31, 95% for CD68, 0% for CD45, and 94% for Fn. Conclusions The modified Dexter-type cultures is an ideal way for cultivation of hUCBDSCs. The successful culture of hUCBDSCs in vitro provides a theoretical support for further studying their earlier clinical application.",

        "abstract": "There are several knowledge-sharing problems in knowledge-management system (KMS) contexts. Many organizations use rewards to motivate people to contribute knowledge, but there has been no conclusive evidence of the role of reward. We designed two game-theory models to explain why and how the different knowledge-sharing problems occur in a KMS and the effectiveness of rewards. We found that there are four types of Nash equilibriums in different knowledge-sharing situations (Perfect, Free-riding, Non-use, and Dormant). Complex situations also occur (e.g., the absence of consideration for knowledge quality leads to vicious cycles). People contribute low-quality knowledge that is not used, and thus the KMS spirals toward disuse. To provide proposition evidence, a case study in an enterprise resource planning vendor was conducted. Based on comparison with empirical evidence, proposition validity was ensured. To effectively facilitate knowledge sharing, our suggestion is that organizations not only add rewards but also apply some additional mechanisms, such as a quality-evaluating system, extended information technology support, and organizational policy. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Objective The present report describes the clinical effects of parental haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of hematologic diseases.Methods A total of 45 patients received parental haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from July 2007 to January 2011.The therapeutic effects and complications were observed.Results Engraftment was successful in a total of 43 patients.Implantation failed in two patients.The incidence of the graft versus host disease(GVHD) was 62.2%.The incidence of acute GVHD was 40.0%,and chronic GVHD occurred in 22.2% of the patients.The incidence of GVHD was lower when the father was the donor,as compared with the mother as the donor.The incidence of GVHD was related to the age of the donor and the number HLA matching sites.In addition,infections observed in the in the present study were mainly blood-borne with cytomegalovirus as the invader and lung infections.During the follow-up period of 6 months to 4 years,six patients died among 43 patients with successful implantation.The major cause of death was infection and a relapse of the original disease.The disease free survival(DFS) rate was 86.7%.Among,seven patients who also received umbilical cord blood,the effect of the transplantation seemed better than those who received parental stem cells only,as hematopoietic reconstruction was faster and the incidence of GVHD only accounted for 7.14% of the total incidence rate.Conclusions Parental hi-allo-HSCT is an effective treatment of hematologic diseases.A young male donor with more HLA matching sites is recommended to prevent GVHD and infection.The combination of parental hi-allo-HSCT and umbilical cord blood transplantation resulted in positive effects with faster hematopoietic reconstruction and a lower incidence of GVHD.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the functions of T. spiralis Nudix hydrolase (TsNd) during the larval invasion of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), development and survival in host by RNAi. The TsNd-specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was designed to silence the expression of TsNd in T. spiralis larvae. DsRNA were delivered to the larvae by soaking incubation or electroporation. Silencing effect of TsNd transcription and expression was determined by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The infectivity of larvae treated with dsRNA was investigated by the in vitro larval invasion of IECs and experimental infection in mice. After being soaked with 40 ng/μl of dsRNA-TsNd, the transcription and expression level of TsNd gene was inhibited 65.8% and 56.4%, respectively. After being electroporated with 40 ng/μl of dsRNA-TsNd, the transcription and expression level of TsNd gene was inhibited 74.2% and 58.2%, respectively. Silencing TsNd expression by both soaking and electroporation inhibited significantly the larval invasion of IECs in a dose-dependent manner (r1= -0.96798, r2=-0.98707). Compared with the mice inoculated with untreated larvae, mice inoculated with larvae soaked with TsNd dsRNA displayed a 49.9% reduction in adult worms and 39.9% reduction in muscle larvae, while mice inoculated with larvae electroporated with TsNd dsRNA displayed a 83.4% reduction in adult worms and 69.5% reduction in muscle larvae, indicating that electroporation has a higher efficiency than soaking in inhibiting the larval development and survival in mice. Our results showed that silencing TsNd expression in T. spiralis inhibited significantly the larval invasion and survival in host.",

La méthode proposéee est basée sur la formulation d'un problème de valeurs propres généralisées et utilise l'algorithme d’échange de Remez pour une platitude donnée. De ce fait, un ensemble de coefficients de filtre peut être aisément calculé en résolvant le problème de valeurs propres, et la solution optimale au sens minimax est obtenue en quelques itérations. De plus, la conception des filtres d'ondelettes maximalement plats est également incluse comme cas particulier, mais elle a une solution analytique identique à celle de Selesnick (IEEE Trans. Signal Process. 46 (4) (April 1998) 1138–1141) et ne requiert done pas de procédure itérative. Enfin, quelques exemples sont conçus pour étudier les caractéristiques des filtres, et il est montré que le nombre d’éléments de retard influence considérablement les résponses en amplitude du filtre.",

However, the infusion of allogeneic CAR-T cells may also cause graft-versus-host disease, which limited their applications during and after allo-HSCT. In this review, we discuss the clinical trials that applying CAR-T cells before allo-HSCT and the use of donor-derived CAR-T cells as conditioning regimen during allo-HSCT.

        "abstract": "Hydraulic fracture breakdown and reorientation data collected from two instrumented test borehole sites have been analyzed to assess the effect of the initiation type (axial or transverse) on the treating pressure. Vertical boreholes were drilled and fractures were placed in a conglomerate at depths of 140–180 m in a far-field stress field that favored horizontal fracture growth. Axial initiation resulted in high injection pressure, which was attributed to near-borehole tortuosity generated as the hydraulic fracture reoriented to align with the far-field stresses. Acoustic scanner logging of the boreholes after fracturing demonstrated that, in many cases, axial initiation occurred and when this was the case, treating pressures were high and consistent with near-borehole tortuous fracture paths. A fracture initiation analysis determined that initiation at abrasively cut circumferential slots should occur before axial initiation. Slots were cut to locate the initiation sites and to make transverse fracture initiation more likely. Transverse initiation from the vertical boreholes at pre-cut slots lowered the injection pressures during the fracture treatment by up to 12 MPa for water injected at approximately 500 L per minute.",

The BALB/c mice were immunized with DCs loading HUVEC antigen 4 times a week. One week after last vaccination, U14 cervical cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into the mice. The tumor size, CTL response of spleen lymphocytes in vitro, the percentage of CD3(+)CD8(+) surface markers of spleen lymphocytes, and the titer of serum antibody were detected. The specific immunity was examined by immunocytochemistry and Western blot.HUVECs with high purity were successfully cultured and by identified by immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR. After the vaccine was injected into mice, the tumors of mice in PBS group grew faster than the those in other groups. The tumors of mice in HUVEC-DC groups grew slowly and disappeared after 2 weeks and The tumors of mice in DC group disappeared after 3 weeks. The CTL response of spleen lymphocytes in vitro showed that HUVEC-DC-T cells could kill HUVEC cells. The percentage of CD3(+)CD8(+) surface markers of spleen lymphocytes in HUVEC-DC group was higher than that in other groups. The titer of serum antibody was 1:800. immunocytochemistry analysis indicated HUVEC-DC group had specific antigen-antibody reaction to HUVECs through and Western blot analysis revealed there were specific bands at 130 KDa and 220 KDa.HUVEC-DC vaccine and DC vaccine can inhibit the tumor growth of U14 cervical cancer of mice. The special cellular and humoral immunity are induced by HUVEC-DC vaccine. Furthermore, some antigens in HUVECs maybe have special immune reaction with integrin alphav and VEGF-R2.",

        "abstract": "Apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF-1) is a central component of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Our study aims at searching the role of APAF-1 in iron overload myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Erythroid apoptosis rate, mRNA expression levels of APAF-1, and caspase-9 activity were determined by flow cytometry, quantitative real-time PCR, and colorimetric assay in MDS patients, respectively. In addition, K562 and MDS-L cell lines were incubated with different concentrations of ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) or ferric ammonium citrate + desferrioxamine (FAC + DFO) in vitro to observe the alteration in erythrocyte apoptosis rate, APAF-1 mRNA, and protein expression levels. Moreover, as control, erythroid apoptosis rate and APAF-1 mRNA expression were detected after silencing APAF-1 expression by endoribonuclease-prepared small interfering RNAs (esiRNAs) in K562 and MDS-L cell lines. Both erythroid apoptosis rate and APAF-1 mRNA expression of the iron overload (IO) group were significantly higher than those of the non-IO group (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001). There is a significant difference of caspase-9 activity between the IO group and the non-IO group (P < 0.001). Erythroid apoptosis rate and APAF-1 mRNA expression of K562 and MDS-L cell lines significantly elevated after FAC incubation in different concentrations (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001 for K562; P < 0.001 and P < 0.001 for MDS-L), while erythroid apoptosis rate and APAF-1 mRNA expression in the FAC + DFO group declined (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001 for K562; P < 0.001 and P < 0.001 for MDS-L). After silencing of APAF-1 expression with specific esiRNAs, erythroid apoptosis rate and APAF-1 mRNA expression of K562 and MDS-L cell lines markedly decreased (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001 for K562; P < 0.001 and P < 0.001 for MDS-L). APAF-1 plays an important role in iron-induced erythroid apoptosis increase in MDS.",

        "abstract": "Accurate characterization of heat transfer in a wellbore during drilling, which includes fluid circulation, is important for wellbore stability analysis. In this work, a pseudo-3D model is developed to simultaneously calculate the heat exchange between the flowing fluid and the surrounding media (drill pipe and rock formation) and the in-plane thermoelastic stresses. The cold drilling fluid descends through the drill pipe at constant injection rates and returns to the ground surface via the annulus. The fluid circulation will decrease the wellbore bottom temperature and reduce the near-wellbore high compressive stress, potentially leading to tensile fracturing of the well. The governing equations for the coupled heat transfer stress problem are formulated to ensure that the most important parameters are taken into account. The wellbore is subject to a non-hydrostatic in situ far-field stress field. In modeling heat exchange between fluid and surrounding media, the heat transfer coefficients are dependent on fluid properties and flow behavior. Analytical solutions in the Laplace space are obtained for the temperatures of the fluid in both the drill pipe and annulus and for the temperature and stress changes in the formation. The numerical results in the time domain are obtained by using an efficient inversion approach. In particular, the near-well stresses are compared for the cases with fixed and time-dependent cooling wellbore conditions. This comparison indicates that the using a fixed temperature wellbore conditions may over-estimate or under-estimate the bottom-hole stress change, potentially leading to wellbore stability problems.",

        "abstract": "Two kinds of granitoids with the similar geochemical characteristics outcrop in Qiaohuote copper deposit which lies on the north side of South Tianshan Suture Zone. The granodiorite outcropping on the south side of Qiaohuote copper deposit and the moylite occurring as an enclave in the volcanic rocks belong to I type granite. They both have calc-alkaline composition, and are characterized by enriched LILE and depleted HFSE and negative anomalies in Eu, Ta, Nb, and Ti. Tectonically, they are related to the northward subduction of South Tianshan Ocean beneath the southern margin of Central Tianshan terrane. LA-ICP-MS zircon ages of 450. 4 ± 1. 1Ma and 430. 8 ±4. 1Ma were obtained from these granitoids. The geochemical and age dating data reported in this paper indicate that these granitoids were formed in a subduction environment, the northward subduction of South Tianshan Ocean may start at Late Ordovician (450Ma) and still be active during Early Silurian (431Ma) in Qiaohuote region. The age of granodiorite is earlier than the ore-host volcanic rocks, therefore, the metallization of Qiaohute copper deposit is independent of the granodiorite.",

Chimeric antigen receptors redirected T cells (CAR-T cells) can enhance disease remission with a favorable outcome for relapsed/refractory ALL, though some cases quickly relapsed after CAR-T cell treatment. Thus, treatment with CAR-T cells followed by allo-HSCT may be the best way to treat relapsed/refractory ALL. In this review, we first discuss the different types of CAR-T cells.

        "abstract": "Norovirus is an important cause of gastroenteritis both in children and adults. In China, few studies have been conducted on adult populations. This study aimed to determine the contribution of norovirus to gastroenteritis, characterize the features of norovirus infections, compare them with other pathogens, and test the effectiveness of the surveillance system.A citywide surveillance network on diarrhea patients was established. Samples were collected with intervals from both children and adults among diarrhea outpatients in hospitals and tested for viruses using rRT-PCR and for bacteria in CDCs. Patient information was acquired through interviews and recorded into a dedicated online system. The Pearson χ2 test, multivariate logistic regression models and discriminant models were fitted into its comparisons with the non-norovirus group and other pathogens.Norovirus was detected in 22.91% of sampled diarrhea patients. The seasonal distribution of norovirus infections was different from non-norovirus patients (p<0.001), with a half-year peak. Higher proportions of males (p=0.001, OR=1.303, 95% CI=1.110-1.529), local citizens (p<0.001) and officials/clerks (p=0.001, OR=1.348, 95% CI=1.124-1.618) were affected with norovirus when compared with non-norovirus patients. Diarrhea patients affected with norovirus featured nausea (p<0.001, OR=1.418, 95% CI=1.176-1.709) and vomiting (p<0.001, OR=1.969, 95% CI=1.618-2.398), while fewer manifested fever (p=0.046, OR=0.758, 95% CI=0.577-0.996) and abdominal pain (p=0.018, OR=0.815, 95% CI=0.689-0.965). Children were more vulnerable to rotavirus (p=0.008, OR=1.637, 95% CI=1.136-2.358) and bacteria (p=0.027, OR=1.511, 95% CI=1.053-2.169) than norovirus. There was a seasonal difference between the GI and GII genotypes (p<0.001). Officials or clerks were more easily affected with GI than GII (p=0.006, OR=1.888, 95% CI=1.205-2.958).This study was based on a citywide hospital-sentinel surveillance system with multiple enteric pathogens included. Norovirus was recognized as the most prevalent enteric pathogen in Shanghai. The seasonal peak was from October to April. Males had a higher prevalence than females. Local citizens and officials/clerks were more vulnerable to norovirus than other pathogens. Compared with rotavirus and bacteria, children were less frequently affected by norovirus. Nausea and vomiting were typical of norovirus, whereas fever and abdominal pain were uncommon symptoms of this pathogen. GI and GII infections were centered in different seasons. Officials and clerks were more easily affected by GI than GII.",

        "abstract": "The identification of epigenetically inactivated tumor suppressor genes may shed additional light on the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and lead to the identification of potential therapeutic targets for demethylating agents. In this study, the methylation status of the p73 gene promoter was analyzed by methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) in bone marrow (BM) samples from 126 adult patients with de novo MDS. The results of the MS-PCR were confirmed by bisulfite sequencing. In addition, we analyzed p73 expression using real-time PCR. The apoptosis of BM cells was examined by flow cytometry. The methylation of the p73 gene was observed in 36.5 % of cases. There were strong correlations between p73 methylation and the marrow blast levels (p  =  0.037) and the WHO classification (p  =  0.016). The frequency of p73 methylation was significantly correlated with the International Prognostic Scoring System subgroup ( r  =  0.904, p  <  0.001). Moreover, a decrease in the transcription of p73 was accompanied by methylation (p  =  0.032). Although the level of apoptosis in the BM samples of the methylated group was not significantly lower than that in the unmethylated group (p  =  0.094), decitabine treatment restored p73 expression and increased the level of cytarabine (ara-C)-induced apoptosis in vitro. The median survival time of patients with p73 methylation was shorter than that for patients without p73 methylation (15 vs. > 33 months, respectively, p  =  0.002). A multivariate analysis also indicated that the p73 methylation status was the independent factor that impacted overall survival. In conclusion, p73 methylation is common in patients with MDS and is associated with poor prognosis. Our results provide further evidence for the involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in the pathogenesis of MDS.",

The Monte Carlo simulation results indicate that when the under-estimate SNR offset is no more than 4dB, the T-TCM performance will not be badly affected, but greater offset can lead rapid performance degradation; Otherwise the overestimate of SNR will never lower the performance. A theoretical explanation is given by analyzing the Jacobian logarithm formula and iterative decoding algorithm, and based on the explanation a new T-TCM decoding scheme without SNR estimation is further proposed, with which the T-TCM systems have no performance loss and can be more conveniently applied and easily implemented.",

        "abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) mainly occur in elderly individuals in Western countries. However, MDS is commonly found in young individuals (<60 years) in Asia. The reason for the high incidence in younger individuals is still unclear, and the differences in disease features between young and elderly patients with MDS have been not well recognized. To explore these issues, in this study, we analyzed the clinical and experimental characteristics of MDS in the patients younger and older than 60 years old and characterized the potential age-associated differences. The results showed that over half of the patients with MDS (61.9%) were younger than 60 years old upon the first diagnosis. The younger patients were more likely to be female, who have lower risk and less advanced MDS. The occurrence of trisomy 8 and bone marrow failure were more frequent in the younger patients than the older ones. The marrow CD34+ cells in the younger patients showed lower proliferation and higher apoptosis in comparison with that in the older ones. Obvious amplification of T cells and low CFU formation could be found in the younger patients. CFU formation was significantly increased in the younger patients after the removal of activated T cells. In addition, the younger patients had a lower frequency of p15(INK4B) methylation, longer survival expectancy and less AML transformation. In summary, the younger patients with MDS in China may show more benign disease features than the older ones. Enhanced immunological response may be involved in the pathogenesis of MDS in the patients younger than 60 years.",

Methods AMLL was diagnosed according to the findings of morphology,cytochemistry and the immunophenotype of bone marrow cells. Therapeutic outcome was evaluated and the relative factors were analyzed. Results Clinical presentations of 8 AMLL patients included fever,enlargement of the lymph nodes,spleen and/or liver. Half patients belonged to hyper-leukocytic leukemia. The marrows of all the patients were markedly hypercellular with leukemic cells accounting for 0.86(0.79-0.96). The immunophenotypes of 8 patients were all B-Ly/My+ phenotype. Seven of the 8 patients received the induction chemotherapy with the regimen targeting both myeloid and lymphoid lineage,in whom 6 patients were completely remitted,and 1 patient died of induction chemotherapy-related death. Three of the 6 patients were continually given chemotherapy and the duration of disease-free survival has reached to 7 months (ranging from 5 to 9 months). Conclusion AMLL,a specific leukemia,should be diagnozed on the overall analysis of cell morphology,cytochemistry and immunophenotype. Modality of chemotherapy for AMLL should aim at both acute lymphoid leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Further study is needed to elucidate the long-term prognosis of AMLL.",

        "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that stromal cell precursors exist in human umbilical cord blood. After being cultured in vitro, these cells are called human umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells (hUCBDSCs). However, the role of hUCBDSCs in hematopoiesis is still unclear. We have previously shown that hUCBDSCs are superior to human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) at enhancing the expansion of megakaryocyte colony forming units (CFU-Meg). Based on this observation, we postulated that hUCBDSCs might promote megakaryocytopoiesis. to test this hypothesis, we developed a megakaryocyte/hUCBDSC co-culture model and a hematopoietic microenvironment injury model in nude mice. We explored the ability and mechanisms by which hUCBDSCs promoted the proliferation of megakaryocytes in vitro, and we also explored their capacity to restore the hematopoietic microenvironment in vivo. As expected, hUCBDSCs were more efective than hBMSCs at enhancing the proliferation of megakaryocyte lines from HeL cells and restoring megakaryocytopoiesis in a hematopoietic microenvironment injury model in nude mice. thrombopoietin (tpo) and stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are two of the key factors underlying this capacity. We also found that gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) between HeL cells and hUCBDSCs might be partially absent. our data provide the first evidence that hUCBDSCs play a regulatory role during megakaryocytopoiesis, which might be important for designing treatments for patients with megakaryocytic injury.",

These grains have a thin homogeneous rim and an oscillatory inner zone domain with or without a relict inherited core. Omphacite, phengite and rutile inclusions were identified within the rim domain of zircon grains only, indicating that the rim had formed during peak eclogite-facies metamorphism. U-Pb zircon data record three distinct age populations: 2450 ± 31 to 1956 ± 26 Ma (for the inherited core), 486 ± 8 to 428 ± 6 Ma (oscillatory inner zone) as well as 319.5 ± 2.9 Ma and 318.7 ± 3.3 Ma (for the metamorphic rim). These new ages suggest that the metamorphism associated with the collision of the Yili and the Tarim blocks along the southwestern margin of the Altaids must have occurred during the Late Carboniferous (ca., 320 Ma). © 2010 E.

        "abstract": "We studied interfacial properties of a series of methyl and ethyl esters of enantioenriched syn-2,3-dihydroxy fatty acids with different chain lengths at the air-water interface, using a Langmuir type film balance and a Brewster angle microscope (BAM). After analyzing their surface pressure (Pi)-area (A) isotherms, we inferred that these molecules existed as an E conformation in the liquid-expanded (LE) phase of monolayers, and the E conformation of molecules changed into a Z conformation during the LE-LC transition in a monolayer. BAM images evidenced the formation of elongated LC aggregates. This is possibly induced by the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, leading to the anisotropic growth of LC domains, on the basis of the FT-IR spectroscopy data. The enthalpy change of the LE-LC phase transition is considered to result from the three types of intermolecular interactions at the air-water interface during compression of these amphiphiles. These findings are discussed in terms of various physical factors that influenced intermolecular interactions and macroscopic aggregations of these amphiphiles.",

        "abstract": "Information-centric network technique is developed to reduce duplicate transmissions for popular data contents by adopting caching strategy and enabling mobile users to access popular data contents from cache stations of nearby network gateways. In current information-centric wireless networks, one popular data content can be stored in multiple cache stations and requested by multiple mobile users. One of the main challenges of this multiple-cache-and-multiple- user wireless network lies in how the mobile user obtains a data content from one of these multiple cache stations with the minimum cost while guaranteeing the data transmission quality-of-service (QoS), and which mobile-user should a cache station choose to provide the data content. To overcome these problems, we formulate a many-to-many negotiation game, where each player (a cache station or a mobile user) bargains with all of its negotiation partners (all mobile users and all cache stations, respectively) in terms of desirable prices, aiming at maximizing its individual payoff. In our proposed negotiation game scheme, the payoff for a mobile user is the obtained QoS gain minus corresponding costs, and the payoff for a cache station is the obtained payment from its negotiation partner mobile user minus the cost for providing services. We propose an adaptive concession strategy, such that players can adjust the concession speed and concession amount of their desirable prices according to their current bargain situations in each game round. Then, we mathematically prove that our proposed adaptive concession strategy maximizes playersu0027 payoffs and the probability to achieve a negotiation agreement. Finally, we validate and evaluate the performances of our proposed negotiation game scheme and adaptive concession strategy through the numerical analyses.",

        "abstract": "As one of essential techniques to support the multimedia transmissions over the fifth generation (5G) mobile wireless networks, the statistical quality of service (QoS) provisioning has been proved to be effective in statistically guaranteeing time sensitive video transmission over time-varying wireless channels. But, how to efficiently design and implement statistical QoS provisioning enabled wireless network remains as the open challenging problem. To overcome these challenges, in this paper we propose the hierarchical-caching architecture to efficiently implement the statistical QoS guarantees in 5G wireless networks, which cooperatively caches the popular multimedia data contents at different wireless network caching tiers, efficiently trading the widely available storage resources for precious wireless bandwidth resources. However, the hierarchical caching scheme imposes the multi-hop wireless link statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning problem when the requested multimedia data contents are fetched across tiers. In particular, we develop two hierarchical caching schemes to adaptively cache the delay bounded multimedia data contents: (1) caching in mobile users, which yields the single-hop wireless transmission and (2) caching in routers, which yields the tandem two-hop wireless transmission. To maximize the average effective capacity when cached data contents dynamically switch between these two schemes, we apply the Markov chain model to derive the optimal departure rates for data contents leaving cacheable mobile users and routers, respectively. U sing these two departure rates, we develop the optimal caching schemes in terms of the probability distribution of how long to cache the data contents and the probability of where to cache the data contents. Finally, we evaluate and validate these two optimized caching schemes through numerical analyses.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive MAC protocols are designed to efficiently utilize the spectral resources without affecting the performance characteristics of the primary users. The use of spectrum opportunities, so called white spaces, can often require stochastic approaches due to difficulty in predicting their appearance. Infrastructure based coordinated access techniques are not a viable option for all the applications and spectrum bands. In this paper, we describe a decentralized cognitive MAC protocol based on multi-channel preamble reservation scheme. The protocol dynamically selects an available communication channel using a distributed channel selection scheme and allows nodes to be completely asynchronous to each other. Our MAC does not need a common control channel and cooperative infrastructure. We also address other practical issues such as mobility and traffic awareness in our MAC design. We have carried out performance evaluation of our protocol on an SDR testbed consisting of Wireless Open Access Research Platform (WARP). Experimental results show that our protocol is able to achieve reliable data communication even in harshly interfering environments.",

Furthermore, no study about any biomarker or biomarker panel for aGVHD grading or steroid sensitivity of aGVHD patients simultaneously has been reported.METHODSHere we established an aGVHD mouse model and explored the relation between aGVHD onset and variations of some cytokines. Based on the results and latest progress, we selected 16 cytokines and compared their serum variations in aGVHD patients and non-aGVHD patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Using protein microarray, we explored the relation between the cytokine levels and aGVHD-related events (onset, grading, and steroid sensitivity).RESULTSThe increase of chemokine levels in murine aGVHD was very consistent with that of patients. We found obviously higher levels of IL-2, IL-4, Elafin, sST2, TLR4, and TNF-α, and lower levels of TGF-β in both aGVHD mouse models and aGVHD patients. In addition, patients with severe aGVHD showed increased IL-6, TLR4, TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), and Elafin and decreased TGF-β. TLR4 and TNFR1 were significantly increased in steroid-refractory aGVHD patients compared with steroid-effective patients (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONA combination of TLR4, TNFR1, TGF-β, and Elafin could be a new 4-biomarker panel to assist aGVHD diagnosis, grading, and evaluation of steroid sensitivity for clinical aGVHD patients.TRIAL REGISTRATIONChiCTR1900022292 \"Clinical Research of Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in the Prophylaxis of Graft-Versus-Host Disease After HLA-Haploidentical Stem-Cell Transplantation.\"FUNDINGNational Key Research Program, National Natural Science Foundation of China, Chongqing Social Career and People's Livelihood Security Science and Technology Innovation Project, Fundamental and Frontier Research Program of Chongqing, and Foundation of Xinqiao Hospital.",

Based on the feature of slow heat conduction in rock formation, the fluid flow in the well is divided into three stages, that is, in the injection, horizontal, and production wells. The output temperature of each stage is regarded as the input of the next stage. The results from the present model are compared with those obtained from numerical simulator TOUGH2 and show first-order agreement with a temperature difference less than 4°C for the case where the fluid circulated for 2.74 years. In the end, a parametric study shows that () the injection rate plays dominant role in affecting the output performance, () higher injection temperature produces larger output temperature but decreases the total heat extracted given a specific time, () the output performance of geothermal reservoir is insensitive to fluid viscosity, and () there exists a critical point that indicates if the fluid releases heat into or absorbs heat from the surrounding formation.",

        "abstract": "To guarantee the real-time transmission for time-sensitive traffic, we need to take delay-bound quality-of-service (QoS) into account when designing the wireless cellular networks. The traditional powerful QoS guarantee technique, called the homogeneous statistical QoS provisioning, assumes that the QoS provisioning of each link can be individually processed. In order to further significantly increase the global system throughput, the available resources of all links need to be jointly controlled, which is typically suitable for downlink transmissions over wireless cellular networks. Under this setup, we need to consider the diverse delay-bound QoS provisionings for different links at the same time, which represents the new heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning framework and imposes many new challenges not encountered before in wireless networks. To overcome these problems, in this paper we propose the heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning framework for high-speed downlink transmissions in wireless cellular networks. In particular, we formulate the optimization problem to maximize the downlink throughput subject to heterogeneous statistical delay-bound QoS requirements. For solving this optimization problem, we develop the heterogeneous-QoS-driven power allocation scheme to derive the closed-form solutions which can maximize the global system throughput while guaranteeing the heterogeneous delay-bound QoS for the entire wireless cellular networks. We show that the heterogeneous-QoS-driven power allocation provides more generic framework for downlink transmissions. The extensive simulation results obtained show that our proposed heterogeneous-QoS-driven power allocation scheme can achieve the global optimization of wireless resource efficiency, thus significantly increasing the global system throughput as compared with the homogeneous statistical delay-bound QoS provisioning schemes.",

Although they are designed  for different specific application or network requirement, they share something in common. In this thesis work, we will investigate some of the widely used medium access control (MAC) protocols and break them down into basic unit blocks. A simple drag & drop graphical design tool is to be designed. An end user can easily use the tool to wire-up a MAC protocol of one's own choice and necessary code can be auto-generated to be downloaded and run on top of a real sensor node directly. Although we shall confine ourselves to MAC protocols in this thesis work, this block building concept can be applied to any other categories of protocols such as routing protocol or localization protocols.

The impact of primary antifungal prophylaxis (PAP) on AL patients with different risk factors is unclear. We analyzed 2015 Chinese AL patients who received a total of 2274 chemotherapy courses, including 1410 courses in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and 864 courses in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) patients. The IFD incidence was significantly higher among AML than ALL patients (11.8 vs. 7.1%, P < 0.001) and in patients receiving induction chemotherapy than in those receiving consolidation chemotherapy (21.6 vs. 3.7%, P < 0.001). Induction chemotherapy, decreased serum albumin, indwelling central venous catheters, parenteral nutrition, and male gender were independent risk factors for IFD in AL patients, whereas PAP independently protected against IFD development. For patients on induction chemotherapy, PAP significantly reduced IFD incidence (P < 0.001). For patients on consolidation chemotherapy, however, PAP did not significantly alter IFD incidence, although PAP did lower IFD incidence in patients with certain risk factors. PAP is highly recommended for patients on induction therapy; for those on consolidation chemotherapy, PAP should be considered for patients who present with severe neutropenia, decreased albumin, and/or an indwelling central venous catheter.",

Three kinds of coal samples (anthracite bituminous and lignite) were chosen to explore the plasma characteristics of coal particle flow. The relationships between the characteristics of plasma signal and the sample itself are analyzed. The characteristics of those coal samples are quite different and they are widly used in coal-fire power plant. Samples were ablated by 1064 nm pulse laser in atmosphere. Based on the analysis of the plasma signal collected by the spectroscopy, the relations between coal particle flow and the relative line intensity of silicon and aluminum, plasma temperature and electron density are concluded. The analysis results show that the relative line intensity of silicon and aluminum is related to the ash content of the coals and its relative line intensity increases with the increasing of ash content in the coal particle flows. For the plasma temperatures and electron densities of the three kinds of coal samples, the results from large to small order are achieved: anthracite, bituminous, lignite.",

        "abstract": "Pinch-1, a widely expressed focal adhesion protein, has been demonstrated to be up-regulated in multiple solid tumor-associated stromal cells, particularly at invasive edges. It was supposed that Pinch-1 was intimately associated with development and progression of tumors. The expression of Pinch-1 in hematopoietic microenvironment in patients with leukemia remains unclear. This study focused on the expression of Pinch-1 in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) from leukemia patients and its possible effect. BMSC was isolated and cultured from bone marrow in leukemia patients and normal healthy donors. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were performed to determine Pinch-1 mRNA and protein level in BMSC, respectively. Lentiviral vector containing Pinch-1 siRNA was constructed, and the recombinant lentivirus particle was packaged in 293 cells. Effectiveness of Pinch-1 siRNA was determined by Western blot. The proliferation, apoptosis and motility of leukemia BMSC subjected to Pinch-1 knockdown using siRNA were tested by flow cytometry, TUNEL assay and Transwell system, respectively. Pinch-1 mRNA and protein were significantly up-regulated in ALL and AML BMSC compared to normal BMSC (p<0.01). Although there was no difference in Pinch-1 mRNA between ALL and AML BMSC, cellular levels of Pinch-1 protein in ALL BMSC were significantly higher than that in AML BMSC (p<0.01). Overexpressed Pinch-1 was significantly reduced in leukemia BMSC transfected with Pinch-1 siRNA evidenced by Western blot. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the percentage of cells in S+G2 phases in leukemia BMSC transfected with Pinch-1 siRNA was significantly lower than control (p<0.01). The percentage of apoptotic cells in leukemia BMSC transfected with Pinch-1 siRNA was 19.8±1.0%, significantly higher than controls (p<0.01). The number of leukemia BMSC transfected with Pinch-1 siRNA that migrated to the lower chamber after culturing for 24 h was 8.4±1.1 per field, significantly lower than controls (p<0.01). Pinch-1 mRNA and protein in leukemia BMSC were up-regulated drastically compared with BMSC from healthy donors. Leukemia BMSC displayed hypoproliferation, decreased migration and increased apoptosis after transfecting Pinch-1 siRNA.",

In this transplantation setting, the cost and outcome of stem cell collections have not been defined completely. The aim of this study was to compare the cost and outcome of stem cell collection in HLA-haplo identical/mismatched related transplantation with combined G-PBSCs and G-BM to the HLA-identical/matched transplantation with G-PBSCs alone for patients with hematologic malignancies. Hundred and fifty-two healthy donors received twice-daily granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) subcutaneously for 5 days. The PBSCs were collected on day 4 and 5 of G-CSF treatment for HLA-identical/matched transplantation from unrelated/related donors. The PBSC collections and BM harvests was performed on day 4 and 5 of G-CSF treatment for HLA-haplo identical/mismatched related transplantation from related donors, respectively. There was no difference in the major characteristics between groups. More stem cells were harvested in HLA-haplo identical/mismatched related donors than that of HLA-identical/matched donors and a lower cost was seen in the former. The HLA-haplo identical/mismatched related transplantation with combined G-PBSCs and G-BM was a feasible approach with high cell harvest and low cost of stem cell collection for patients with hematologic malignancies.",

        "abstract": "Recently, hashing based approximate nearest neighbors search has attracted much attention. Extensive centralized hashing algorithms have been proposed and achieved promising performance. However, due to the large scale of many applications, the data is often stored or even collected in a distributed manner. Learning hash functions by aggregating all the data into a fusion center is infeasible because of the prohibitively expensive communication and computation overhead. In this paper, we develop a novel hashing model to learn hash functions in a distributed setting. We cast a centralized hashing model as a set of subproblems with consensus constraints. We find these subproblems can be analytically solved in parallel on the distributed compute nodes. Since no training data is transmitted across the nodes in the learning process, the communication cost of our model is independent to the data size. Extensive experiments on several large scale datasets containing up to 100 million samples demonstrate the efficacy of our method.",

This work demonstrated the possibility of using eucalyptus lignosulfonate calcium &lpar;HLS&rpar; particles as reinforcement in polyvinyl alcohol &lpar;PVA&rpar; matrix. 41% and 384.7% improvement of pure PVA tensile strength and Young's modulus were achieved with incorporation of 5wt% HLS. The above results were ascribed to specific intermolecular interactions between HLS and PVA, suggested by the increasing PVA glass transition and crystalline relaxations temperature, depression of melting point with HLS incorporation. Moreover, this interaction was quantitatively determined by q value of -62.4±10.0 in Kwei equation. Additionally, the remarkable red shift of wavenumber corresponding to hydroxyl group also indicated the formation of strong hydrogen bond in HLS/PVA blend. SEM characterization confirmed that HLS/PVA blends are at least miscible.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of rituximab treatments for refractory and relapsed idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). 18 patients with refractory and relapsed ITP who received 22 courses of rituximab treatments from January 2007 to December 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. Rituximab was given at a dose of 375 mg/m(2) intravenously weekly for a continuous 4 weeks. The results indicated that responses were achieved in 15 of 22 (68%) courses, out of which complete responses were achieved in 10 of 22 (45%) courses, partial and minimal responses were achieved in 5 of 22 (23%) courses, and no responses were achieved in 7 of 22 (32%) courses. The median time of response was 3 weeks (1 - 17 weeks) from the start of treatment and median duration of response was 13 weeks (1 week - 42 months). The responses were mostly short-sustained and follow-up median time was 20 months (1 - 52 months). The responses of 8 patients (36%) sustained for over 6 months, 6 patients (27%) sustained for over 1 year, and 4 patients also showed sustained response at last visit of follow-up. Previous splenectomy resulted in a poor response (P = 0.037). Patients who failed in rituximab treatment and prior received multiple treatments including splenectomy, had a poor response to further therapies. It is concluded that rituximab is well tolerated by patients and is useful in some patients with relapsed and refractory ITP, however, only about 20% patients can achieve sustained remissions. The patients who failed in rituximab treatment has a poor response to further treatment.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent cause of dementia in the elderly, is characterized by progressive cognitive and intellectual deficits. Most patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are thought to be in a very early stage of AD. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging reflects spontaneous brain activities and/or the endogenous/background neurophysiological process of the human brain. Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) can provide a fast method for mapping regional activity across the whole brain. Little has been previously published about where or how spontaneous activity differs between MCI and AD, although many previous fMRI studies have shown that the activity pattern is altered in MCI/AD. In the present study, we first used the ReHo method to explore differences in regional spontaneous activities throughout the whole brain between normal controls (NC) and people with MCI and with AD. A one-way ANOVA was performed to determine the regions in which the ReHo differs between the three groups, and then a post hoc analysis was performed to evaluate differences in the pattern among the three groups. Finally a correlation analysis was done between the ReHo index of these regions and clinical variables in order to evaluate the relationship between ReHo and cognitive measures in the AD and MCI groups. An exploratory classification analysis also demonstrated that ReHo measures were able to correctly separate subjects in 71.4% of the cases. Altered brain spontaneous activations were found in the medial prefrontal cortex, the bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus and the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in both MCI and AD. In MCI, the ReHo index in the left IPL was higher than that of the NC, which could indicate the presence of a compensatory mechanism in MCI. More obviously, the correlation analysis indicated that the lower the memory and other cognitive abilities, the lower the ReHo in patients with MCI and AD. Combining our findings with the results in earlier studies, we propose that the spontaneous activity pattern in the resting state could potentially be used as a clinical marker for MCI/AD.",

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis to address this issue.We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EmBase, BISOS, Clinical Trials and some Chinese databases for relevant studies, and 2 prospective and 15 retrospective studies involving a total of 1595 patients met our inclusion criteria.The meta-analysis showed no significant differences in complete remission (CR) [odds ratio (OR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-1.72, p = 0.65], 5-year overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.85-1.45, p = 0.43] and 5-year progression free survival (PFS) (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.75-1.53, p = 0.70) in patients who received RT versus RCT. Furthermore, the addition of CT decreased neither systemic failure (SL) (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.47-1.21, p = 0.24) nor locoregional failure (LF) (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.68-2.01, p = 0. 57).RCT did not have an obvious advantage over RT for treating IE/IIE ENKTL.",

        "abstract": "We have successfully demonstrated that host-guest complex of carboxylated pillar[6]arene with oxaliplatin exhibits low cytotoxicity toward normal cells and displays higher anticancer bioactivity against colorectal cancer cells than oxaliplatin itself. Owing to higher binding affinity of carboxylated pillar[6]arene with spermine than that of with oxaliplatin, the oxaliplatin can be thoroughly released from its host-guest complex by the competitive replacement with spermine. This supramolecular chemotherapy works well both in vitro and in vivo for spermine-overexpressed cancers, such as colorectal cancer. Compared to oxaliplatin itself, anticancer bioactivity of this host-guest complex is further improved by about 20%. Such an improvement results from combined effect of controlled release of oxaliplatin from the host-guest complex and consumption of spermine by carboxylated pillar[6]arene. It is anticipated that this supramolecular strategy may be extended to other clinical anticancer drugs for decreasing their severe side effects and improving their anticancer bioactivity, thus enriching realm of supramolecular chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "SUMMARY FIR wavelet filters are mainly used in conventional wavelet-based image coding. However, FIR filters, except for the Haar wavelet, cannot satisfy both the exactly linear phase and orthonormality conditions. For example, the well-known Daubechies-9/7 wavelet is biorthogonal. In this paper, an effective implementation of the all-pass- based wavelet filters is presented for wavelet-based image coding. Since all-pass filters are IIR, both the exactly linear phase and orthonormality conditions can be simultaneously satisfied, so that better compression performance can be expected. Also, IIR filters can be realized with a lower computational complexity than can FIR filters. Finally, the proposed IIR wavelet filters are evaluated by using SPIHT to compress the practical images, and the influence of the all-pass filters and delay elements on the compression performance is investigated. It is shown through the experi - mental results that the IIR wavelet filters proposed in this paper have a lower computational complexity than the Daubechies-9/7 wavelet, with a comparable compression performance.

The aim of this study was to characterize the Ts31 protein and to evaluate the potential of the recombinant Ts31 protein (rTs31) for serodiagnosis of human trichinellosis. Ts31 gene was cloned and rTs31 was produced in an E. coli expression system. An anti-rTs31serum recognized the native protein migrating in a 25-55 kDa range by Western blotting of ML crude or ES antigens. Expression of Ts31 gene was observed at all developmental stages of T. spiralis (adult worms, newborn larvae, pre-encapsulated larvae and ML). An immunolocalization analysis identified Ts31 in the cuticle and stichocytes of the parasite. The sensitivity of rTs31-ELISA and ES antigen ELISA for detecting anti-Trichinella IgG antibodies in sera of patients with trichinellosis was 97.83% (45/46) and 86.78% (39/46), respectively (P>0.05); The specificity of rTs31-ELISA was 99.13% (114/115), which was significantly higher than 85.22% (98/115) of ES antigen ELISA (P<0.01). The rTs31 protein of T. spiralis could be considered as a potential diagnostic antigen for trichinellosis.",

Some novel ways of molecular self-assembly for surface\n patterning are particularly introduced in this review, including supramolecular architecture at interface, chemisorption of\n dendron thoils, and surface aggregation of bolaform amphiphiles. Provided that we know more and more about the basic principles\n governing the surface morphology, it is believed that interfacial molecular assembly would be a very competitive supramolecular\n technique, and a potential application in many fields such as surface property adjustment, organic patterned devices, surface\n molecular recognition, and combinatorial chemistry is greatly anticipated.",

        "abstract": "Recommendation for cold users is fairly challenging because no prior rating can be used in preference prediction. To tackle this cold-start scenario, rating elicitation is usually employed through an initial interview in which users are queried by some carefully selected items. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to mine the most valuable items to construct query set using a semi-supervised discriminative selection (SSDS) model. To learn a low dimensional representation for users in item space which can reflect their tastes to a large extent, the model incorporates category labels as discriminative information. To ensure the used labels reliable as well as all users considered, the model utilizes a semi-supervised scheme leveraging expert guidance with graph regularization. Experimental results on real-world dataset MovieLens demonstrate that the proposed SSDS model outperforms traditional preference elicitation methods on top-N measures for cold-start recommendation.",

        "abstract": "Progressive development of opening-mode splay or branch fractures along a permeable fault in an elastic medium, subject to elevated fluid pressure from a constant influx fluid source, is studied numerically using a plane-strain hydraulic fracturing model that couples fracture deformation and fluid flow. In situ stresses are imposed so that their resultant shear stress on the fault is lower than the frictional strength. New splay fractures are initiated based on satisfying a dual criterion for both tensile strength and fracture toughness and meeting a minimum fracture spacing requirement. Numerical results demonstrate that spatial variations in permeability along faults can cause arrest of local slip and the created slip gradient can result in splay fracture initiation at a significant distance inward from the fault tips. One splay fracture generally grows first, and the kinematic coherence in displacements at the junction between it and the fault can reduce the downstream flow rate to prevent the nucleation of other splay fractures. However, the number of splay fractures can be increased when the branch growth extent is limited to a certain size; when the fault is divided into many segments, each with a linear distributed initial aperture; and if the main fault is curved. The generation of a number of splay fractures can act to increase the permeability of the rock mass. When the splay fractures are constrained by two faults, a rhomb-shaped fault zone involving multiple high-angle branches forms. The development of the second-generation splay fractures on a first-generation one is promoted by fluid penetration. Multiple fluid-driven splay fractures can be created under the condition that fluid pressure is below or slightly above the fault confining stress. This implies that generation of complex splay fracture patterns requires less energy than generating a single opening-mode fracture. Multiple fluid-driven splay fracture nucleation and growth into a horsetail pattern occur when the fault-parallel in situ normal stress becomes more tensile. In addition, the effects of fluid viscosity and tensile fracture toughness are investigated to determine their role in splay fracture initiation and growth.",

        "abstract": "Cytogenetic alterations form the basis for risk stratification for multiple myeloma (MM) and guide the selection of therapy; however, current pathology assays performed on bone marrow samples can produce false negatives due to the unpredictable distribution and rarity of MM cells. Here, we report on a microfluidic device used to facilitate CD45 depletion to enhance the detection of cytogenetic alterations in plasma cells. Bone marrow samples from 48 MM patients were each divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was subjected to classic flow cytometry and FISH. The other first went through CD45+ cell depletion, further enriched by microfluidic size selection. The enriched samples were then analyzed using flow cytometry and FISH, and compared to those analyzed using the classic method only. Unlike the traditional method, the microfluidic device removed the CD45+ leukocytes and specifically selected plasma cells from the remaining white blood cells. Therefore, the microfluidic method (MF-CD45-TACs) significantly increased the percentage of CD38+/CD138+ cells to 37.7%±20.4% (P<0.001) from 10.3%±8.5% in bone marrow. After the MF-CD45-TACs enrichment, the detection rate of IgH rearrangement, del(13q14), del(17p) and 1q21 gains rose to 56.3%(P<0.001), 37.5%(P<0.001), 22.9%(P<0.001) and 41.7% (P=0.001), respectively; all rates of detection were significantly increased compared to the classically analyzed samples. In this clinical trial, this microfluidic-assisted assay provided a precise detection of cytogenetic alterations in plasma cells (PCs) and improved clinical outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Specific patterns of brain atrophy may be helpful in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we set out to evaluate the utility of grey-matter volume in the classification of AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) compared to normal control (NC) individuals. Voxel-based morphometric analyses were performed on structural MRIs from 35 AD patients, 27 aMCI patients, and 27 NC participants. A two-sample two-tailed t-test was computed between the NC and AD groups to create a map of abnormal grey matter in AD. The brain areas with significant differences were extracted as regions of interest (ROIs), and the grey-matter volumes in the ROIs of the aMCI patients were included to evaluate the patterns of change across different disease severities. Next, correlation analyses between the grey-matter volumes in the ROIs and all clinical variables were performed in aMCI and AD patients to determine whether they varied with disease progression. The results revealed significantly decreased grey matter in the bilateral hippocampus/parahippocampus, the bilateral superior/middle temporal gyri, and the right precuneus in AD patients. The grey-matter volumes were positively correlated with clinical variables. Finally, we performed exploratory linear discriminative analyses to assess the classifying capacity of grey-matter volumes in the bilateral hippocampus and parahippocampus among AD, aMCI, and NC. Leave-one-out cross-validation analyses demonstrated that grey-matter volumes in hippocampus and parahippocampus accurately distinguished AD from NC. These findings indicate that grey-matter volumes are useful in the classification of AD.",

        "abstract": "Supramolecular chemotherapy is aimed to employ supramolecular approach for regulating the cytotoxicity and improving the efficiency of antitumor drugs. In this paper, we demonstrated a new example of supramolecular chemotherapy by utilizing the clinical antitumor drug, oxaliplatin, which is the specific drug for colorectal cancer treatment. Cytotoxicity of oxaliplatin to the colorectal normal cell could be significantly decreased by host-guest complexation between oxaliplatin and cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]). More importantly, oxaliplatin-CB[7] exhibited cooperatively enhanced antitumor activity than oxaliplatin itself. On the one hand, the antitumor activity of oxaliplatin can reappear by competitive replacement of spermine from oxaliplatin-CB[7]; on the other hand, CB[7] can consume the overexpressed spermine in tumor environments, which is essential for tumor cell growth. These two events can lead to the cooperatively enhanced antitumor performance. Supramolecular chemotherapy can be applied to treat with spermine-overexpressed tumors. It is highly anticipated that this strategy may be employed in many other clinical antitumor drugs, which opens a new horizon of supramolecular chemotherapy for potential applications in clinical antitumor treatments.",

Nucleic acid of enterovirus (EV) was detected by real-time RT-PCR from 799 HFMD cases from 15 districts/counties in Shanghai; the complete sequences of VP1 encoding region of several identified EV71 strains and sequences of VP4 encoding region of several untyped EV were determined and analyzed. Analysis and summary of the epidemiological data was conducted with Microsoft Excel, and sequence analyses were conducted with both BioEdit and MEGA software. Untyped EV was identified through comparing the VP4 sequence to sequence database using BLAST online service. It was showed that all the 18 districts/counties had reported HFMD cases; children less than 6 years old were the most susceptible population group; the peak of epidemics of HFMD was from April to July; EV71 and Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) were the major pathogens for this epidemic, but the constituent ratio of EV71 and CA16 was different in different months and regions; CA16 infection was mainly responsible for the mild HFMD, but EV71 for most of the severe cases; EV71 strains of Shanghai were clustered with representatives of subgenotype C4a and showed the highest identity to them, based on the sequence analyses of VP1 encoding region; 2 of the untyped EV were identified as CA2 and CA10 respectively. All the results indicated that EV71 and CA16 were the major pathogens for the epidemic of HFMD in Shanghai, 2009; the circulating EV71 belonged to subgenotype C4a. Besides, other types of EV (for example: CA2 and CA10) were also responsible for a few of the HFMD cases.",

Large scale genome sequencing reveals PI3Kα is frequently hyper-activated in ESCC. We found that ESCC cells harboring alterations in PI3K pathway were more resistant to radiation and combination of a clinical PI3Kα-selective inhibitor CYH33 and radiation synergistically inhibited cell proliferation in 14 ESCC cell lines. Radiation induced phosphorylation of FOXO1 and Akt, which sensitized ESCC cells to PI3Kα inhibitors. Both S1PR3 and DNA-PK contributed to radiation-induced Akt phosphorylation, which were revealed to be collectively dependent on PI3Kα. By contrast, constitutively active Akt abrogated the synergism between PI3Kα inhibitors and radiation. PI3Kα inhibition enhanced radiation-induced DNA damage, G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Combination of CYH33 and radiation significantly inhibited the growth of xenografts derived from ESCC patients, which was accompanied with abrogation of radiation-induced phosphorylation of Akt and filtration of M2-like macrophages. Taken together, combination of CYH33 and radiation possesses synergism in ESCC, which provides promising rationale to test this combinatorial regimen in ESCC patients.",

        "abstract": "The biosynthetic thermoplastic poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB) possesses favorable tensile strength and elongation performance and has been studied as a new implantable polymer material for medical uses. However, its hemocompatibility has not been tested to confirm its applicability to tissue engineering. In this study, a series of experiments was performed that included erythrocyte hemolysis tests, dynamic blood coagulation tests, platelet adhesion tests, effects on blood coagulation, Wright staining, and adsorption of erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets, and plasma proteins. The results were compared with control tests on polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a biomaterial in current use, to evaluate the relative in vitro hemocompatibility of P4HB. The degree of hemolysis in the presence of P4HB was 1.9 ± 0.2%. The absorbance-time curve for blood clotting declined slowly and smoothly. There were no differences in the test values of Factor XII, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), or fibrin degradation products (FDPs) among whole blood samples exposed to P4HB or PVC and the blank control groups (P > .05). Adsorption of platelets and globulin was similar in samples exposed to P4HB and PVC (P > .05), but the adsorption of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and albumin to P4HB was higher (P < .05). In conclusion, P4HB compares favorably with PVC in terms of blood compatibility, except for a higher affinity for erythrocytes and leukocytes. The findings indicate that P4HB, an alternate scaffolding material with advantageous properties, is generally acceptable for bioengineering use.",

Methods We collected the Jurkat cells which had been co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells from 6 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia,2 cases of iron deficiency anemia,or 2 cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura for 10 d,and then observe the changes of Jurkat cells’ proliferation,cell cycle,apoptosis,differentiation and daunorubicin (DNR) intake dose. Results Leukemia bone marrow stromal cells promoted Jurkat cells’ adhesion,chemotaxis and reduction of intake dose than normal bone marrow stromal cells; but were weaker in inhibition of proliferation and promotion of differentiation. Leukemia bone marrow stromal cells inhibited Jurkat cells’ apoptosis,and the normal bone marrow stromal cells promoted apoptosis.

        "abstract": "The effects of fire on artificial secondary forests of Pinus massoniana with an average diameter at breast height(DBH) from 5.5958 cm to 19.3900 cm,average height from 4.11 m to 18.60 m,and average density from 500 clumps hm-2 to 2400 clumps hm-2,were investigated by comparison of burnt and non-burnt plots in a karst mountain area covered by Quaternary clay in central Guizhou province,China.The percentage damage to P.massoniana trees differed among plant organs and followed the order bark(95.51%) > branches(71.49%) > crown(62.95%).The percentage plant death in different forest layers was highest in the herbaceous layer(100%),intermediate in the arbuscular layer(30.43%) and lowest in the arboreous layer(29.09%).With increasing DBH of P.massoniana in the arboreous layer,the percentage damage to bark was unchanged,whereas damage to branches and the crown decreased,and the percentage death of plants also decreased.At P.massoniana DBH<5 cm,the percentage damage to bark,branches and the crown,percentage plant death and direct loss of biomass were all 100%,whereas at DBH≥25 cm the percentage damage to bark,branches and the crown were 85.00%,25.00% and 15.00%,respectively,and percentage plant death and direct loss of biomass were zero.In the arbuscular layer,either all individuals of a plant species died,such as P.massoniana,Betula alnoides and Camellia oleifera,all plants survived,such as Prunus serrulata,Myrsine africana and Rhamnus leptophylla,or only some plants died,such as Cunninghamia lanceolata,Castanea seguinii and Aralia chinensis.Plant species in the herbaceous layer either died or germinated after death of aboveground branches and leaves because of fire.In burnt forest,the potential biomass loss(68.7755 t/hm2) was higher than direct biomass loss(12.1818 t/hm2;percentage direct loss 22.41%).Direct biomass loss differed among the layers and followed the order arboreous layer(6.9382 t/hm2) > litter layer(3.3441 t/hm2) > arbuscular layer(2.4964 t/hm2) > herbaceous layer(0.8861 t/hm2);in terms of the corresponding percentage direct biomass loss,the order was herbaceous layer(or litter layer,100.00%) > arbuscular layer(33.36%) > arboreous layer(23.59%).Decreases in the Patrick,Gleason,Simpson and Hurlbert indices followed the order herbaceous layer > arbuscular layer > arboreous layer,and reflected potential losses were higher than direct losses of plant diversity in the different layers of burnt forests.The range and average values of direct diversity loss in the arboreous layer indicated by the Patrick,Gleason,Simpson and Hurlbert indices were 0—1 and 0.1429,0—0.1669 and 0.0238,0—1.0000 and 0.1586,and-0.1098—0 and-0.0166,respectively;the corresponding range and average values of percentage direct biodiversity loss were 0—100 and 14.29,0—100 and 14.29,0.66—100 and 17.85,and-18.61—-3.98 and-11.29,respectively.The range and average values of direct loss of diversity in the arbuscular layer as measured by these indices were 0—5 and 1.8571,0—0.6948 and 0.4301,0—0.2987 and 0.1115,and-0.3477—0 and-0.1241,respectively;the corresponding range and average values of percentage direct biodiversity loss were 0—42.86 and 26.76,0—42.85 and 26.76,0—86.35 and 37.63,and-52.00—0 and-18.53,respectively.The range and average values of direct diversity loss in the herbaceous layer indicated by these indices were 2—6 and 3.8000,1.8205—5.4614 and 3.4589,0.2593—0.8313 and 0.5300,and 0.1728—0.7619 and-0.4863;the percentage direct loss was 100.00% for all of the indices.The average burn height of the arboreous layer was negatively correlated to DBH,positively correlated to density and percentage damage to branches,the crown and entire plants,and uncorrelated with percentage damage to bark.The arboreous layer showed higher burn heights than those of the arbuscular layer,and their correlation was negative,and was negatively correlated to potential or direct loss of biomass and positively correlated to percentage direct loss of biomass.Burn height was positively correlated to direct loss or percentage direct loss of biomass,and negatively correlated to potential loss of biomass in the arbuscular layer.Direct loss or percentage direct loss of biomass with the Patrick and Gleason indices was not obviously correlated to burn height in the arboreous layer and was positively correlated to burn height in the arbuscular layer.Burn height was positively correlated to direct loss,and negatively correlated to percentage direct loss,of biomass with the Simpson index in the arboreous layer,and positively correlated to direct loss and percentage direct loss of biomass with the Simpson index in the arbuscular layer.No obvious correlation between burn height of the arboreous or arbuscular layer and direct loss or percentage direct loss of biomass with the Hurlbert index was detected.",

However, relapse of the hematological disease after allo-HSCT remains a challenge and is associated with poor long-term survival.

To break the limit, hUCB as a novel source of hUCB-derived stromal cells was incorporated in an attempt to expand CD34+ cells from hUCB in vitro. Cord blood CD34 cells were separated by MACS system. HUCB-derived stromal cells were cultured by the Dexter system and characterized by morphologic, immunophenotypical, and functional analysis. We studied the effects of hUCB-derived stromal cells, cytokines, and hUCB-derived stromal cells combined with cytokines on expansion of hUCB CD34 cells. The CD34+ cells were assessed for the degree of expansion and the number of colony-forming units in semisolid culture. Our research found that hUCB-derived stromal cells were mainly composed of three kinds of cell components, with CD106, CD29, CD44, CD45, CD50, CD68, CD31, Fn, Lm, and collagen IV positive, but CD34 negative immunophenotype. Functionally, it was discovered by cell cycle and growth curve analyses that the capability of colony and parietal layer formation of hUCB-derived stromal cells was poorer than that of BM stromal cells, and the doubling time of hUCB-derived stromal cells was longer than that of BM stromal cells. It was indicated by ELISA and RT-PCR that hUCB-derived stromal cells express higher level of TPO and less GM-CSF and SCF than BM stromal cell. Adherent layer of hUCB-derived stromal cells alone or combining with cytokines, increased CD34+ cell expansion. In vitro formation of CFUs by expanded CCD34 cells was significantly higher than that of unexpanded CD34+ cells (P < 0.05). When cocultured with hUCB-derived stromal cells in the presence of cytokines, cell growth was significantly enhanced: CD34 cells by 8.02 +/- 0.96-fold, CFU-GM by 217.60 +/- 6.72-fold, CFU-E by 1940.80 +/- 52.78-fold, and CFU-Mg by 142.60 +/- 4.39-fold. HUCB-derived stromal cells have significant superiority on the expansion of CFU-Mg (P < 0.05). The results indicate that human umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells may be a suitable feeder layer for expansion of hematopoietic progenitors from hUCB in vitro.",

        "abstract": "The surfactant-encapsulated europium-substituted heteropolyoxotungatate, (DODA) 11H 2 [Eu(SiW 11O 39) 2(H 2O) 4] (SEC-2), is structurally characterized in detail and its photophysical behaviors are investigated. The DODA alkyl chains of SEC-2 are well ordered in the solid state, solvent-casting film, and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film. The europium-substituted heteropolyoxotungatate (POM-2a) is organized in the solvent-casting and LB films. A comparison of the intensities of the W-O d antisymmetrical stretching band between the infrared transmission and reflection absorption spectra of the LB films suggests that the long axis direction of POM-2a is parallel to the substrates. The solid-state SEC-2 shows two different lamellar structures with interlayer distances of 3.6 and 4.9 nm, respectively. The layer structures are well defined in both the solvent-casting and LB films and have lamellar distances of 3.6 and 4.9 nm, respectively. In short periodicities, it is considered that the alkyl chains are partially interdigitated, and the interdigitated length may reach 1.3 nm. SEC-2 exhibits the characteristics 5D 0→ 7F j (j = 0-4) Eu 3+ emission. The bands in both the excitation and emission spectra of K 13Eu(SiW 11 O 39) 2·20H 2O (POM-2) and SEC-2 solutions (1 mM) show different intensities because of their various chemical microenvironments. The strong oxygen-to-tungsten charge transfer (O→W LMCT) bands of POM-2a appear in the excitation spectra of the solvent-casting and LB films, indicating an efficient intramolecular energy transfer from the O→W LMCT states to Eu 3+ ions. The luminescent lifetimes of SEC-2 are much shorter than those of the naked POM-2 because of the coordinated water molecules to Eu 3+ in SEC-2. The solution, solid state, solvent-casting films, and LB films of SEC-2 display their different photophysical properties such as spectrum, lifetime, and energy transfer from the O→W LMCT states to Eu 3+ ions. The photophysical behaviors of Eu-POMs can be modified by their organizational structures, which are significant for the future realizations of functional devices.",

        "abstract": "We propose the quality-of-service (QoS) driven power allocation scheme for full-duplex wireless links. By integrating information theory with the principle of effective capacity, we build two models - local transmit power related self-interference (LTPRS) model and local transmit power unrelated self-interference (LTPUS) model to analyze the full-duplex transmission, respectively. In the LTPRS model, self-interference directly corresponds to the level of local transmit power. In the LTPUS model, self-interference does not directly relate to the level of local transmit power. For both of these two models, we derive the optimal power allocation schemes, which aim at maximizing the system throughput subject to a given delay QoS constraint, over bidirectional wireless links with full-duplex transmission. The analyses and numerical results verify that our proposed power allocation scheme can efficiently support diverse QoS requirement over full-duplex wireless links. For LTPRS model, the optimal power allocation scheme converges to a constant power scheme when the QoS constraint gets very loose and the optimal power allocation scheme reduces to the channel inversion scheme when the QoS constraint becomes very stringent. For LTPUS model, the optimal power allocation scheme converges to the the water-filling scheme when the QoS constraint gets very loose and the optimal power allocation scheme reduces to the channel inversion scheme when the QoS constraint becomes very stringent.",

The proposed framework of DsRec includes three components: a matrix factorization model for the observed rating reconstruction, a bi-clustering model for the user-item subgroup analysis, and two regularization terms to connect the above two components into a unified formulation.

        "abstract": "Our previous study demonstrated that human umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells (hUCBDSCs) support the growth of hematopoietic stem cells, and promote the expansion of colony-forming units of megakaryocyte (CFU-Mk) even more efficiently than human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs). Given the unique role of hUCBDSCs in megakaryocytopoiesis in vitro, in this follow up study, we further investigated their effects in vivo on hematopoiesis in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplants. After infusing hematopoietic cells alone or together with either hUCBDSCs or hBMSCs into lethally irradiated BABL/c mice, we examined the engraftment of human CD45+ cells in the mouse bone marrow with flow cytometry, observed the survival rate of irradiated mice, obtained blood counts and bone marrow biopsies at different time points post-transplant, and assessed colony forming and the homing efficiency of hematopoietic cells. By comparing HSC transplantation with or without stromal cells, we show here that hUCBDSCs efficiently promote the homing of hematopoietic cells to the marrow and enhance the engraftment after cotransplantation. They also promote hematopoietic reconstitution, particularly of the megakaryocytic lineage, and restore the impaired stromal microenvironment after radiation-induced damages. These effects of hUCBDSCs are more potent than those of hBMSCs. In conclusion, our findings suggest the role of hUCBDSCs to facilitate hematopoietic reconstitution and engraftment when cotransplanted with hematopoietic cells.",

During the development of the retina, different types of neurons emerge according to a definite order and are influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic cues.

Methods: RPCs were isolated from embryonic 18-day-old and postnatal 2-week-old SD rat retina and cultured in suspension and adherent methods. All the culture of RPCs was maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM): F12 containing 10 ng/ml ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), 10% retinoid acid and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 2, 3, 5, 6 days of attachment, these cells and rat retina slices of embryonic 18 days, postnatal 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 days were stained by two-step immunohistochemistry staining with nestin, vimentin, opsin and glial filament acid protein (GFAP). Results: Cultured RPCs in suspension presented sphere shape and were stained into brown color in the cytoplasm by nestin. The suspension RPCs was subcultured 1 time and the adherent RPCs could be passed 5 generations. CNTF, bFGF and EGF played the same role in the induction differentiation of RPCs at the 6th day of culture. RPCs were differentiated into neuron-like cells by the functioning of CNTF, bFGF and EGF, showing a long axon with still positive staining for nestin. No opsin positive cells in the cultured RPCs were induced in vitro in the rats of postnatal 2 weeks. Conclusion: RPCs can be cultured and expansed in vitro. During differentiation of RPCs, the shape change of the cultured cell is earlier than that of function.",

Methods Twenty seven Sprague-Dawely rats were selected, and the left and right eyes were in the experimental control group and NGF group, respectively. After the RD model was set up by subretinal injection with sodium hyaluronate, 5 μl NGF (1 μgμl) was injected into the vitreous body of the right eyes which were in the NGF group; 5 μl PBS was injected into vitreous body of left eyes which were in the experimental control group. The injection was performed once every 4 days till the end of the observation period. The eye balls of the 27 rats were extrafted 1.5, 3, 6, 12 hours, 1 day, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 days after the RD model was established. Another 2 rats were selected as the normal control, which underwent none of the injections but eyeball extraction at the end of the observation period. TUNEL and transmission electron microscopy were used to detect the apoptosis of the retinal cells. Cell counts and statistical analysis were used to assess results. Results Typical apoptosis cells were observed in the early time of RD. Apoptosis was found in each retinal layers, especially in inner and outer nuclear layers. The number of apoptosis cells increased as the time of RD was prolonged(P<0.01). It was also found that apoptosis cells in NGF group were less than that in the experimental control group(P<0.01). Conclusion Intravitreous injection exogenous NGF may inhibit the apoptosis of retinal cells in experimental RD.",

        "abstract": "Binding of leukemia cells to the bone marrow extracellular matrix (ECM) through integrins might influence drug response and the survival of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the functions of integrin in AML are needed to be clarified. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were retrieved and integrin β3 (ITGB3) expression and prognostic significance for AML were analyzed. Integrin alphavbeta3 (αvβ3) in sorafenib sensitivity and signaling pathway of FLT3-ITD AML cells was evaluated in vitro. The level of ITGB3 expression was positively correlated with risk stratification and prognosis of AML patients, especially in cytogenetic-normal patients with Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutation. Integrin αvβ3 decreased sorafenib sensitivity when co-culture of MV4-11 cells and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), and it is crucial for osteopontin (OPN) induced sorafenib insensitivity in FLT3-ITD mutated AML cells. Mechanically, αvβ3 enhance β-catenin activation through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) pathway. Moreover, genetic inhibition of β-catenin by shRNA could increase sorafenib sensitivity in MV4-11 cells. Taken together, our study revealed a novel mechanism in microenvironment influence on sorafenib sensitivity in AML with FLT3-ITD mutation that was caused by activating integrin αvβ3/PI3K/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin pathway. Integrin αvβ3/β-catenin could be considered as a new therapeutic target for AML especially for FLT3-ITD mutated AML.",

        "abstract": "Spectrum and power efficiencies are both crucial to design efficient wireless networks. In past two decades, spectrum and power efficiencies of wireless networks are optimized separately. However, to increase the spectrum efficiency and reduce the energy consumption, it is necessary to jointly optimize spectrum and power efficiencies of wireless networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework to model the statistical delay quality of service (QoS) guarantees, in terms of QoS exponent, effective spectrum efficiency (ESE), and effective power efficiency (EPE), for joint spectrum and power efficiencies optimization to transmit real-time traffics over wireless networks. In particular, we derive the relationship between ESE and EPE under statistical QoS provisioning constraint. Based on the relationship, we obtain the mutually beneficial region and contention-based region. We also analyze the global maximum EPE and optimal average transmit power under various statistical QoS guarantees. Then, we develop a novel strategy to achieve the joint spectrum and power efficiencies optimization. Also conducted is a set of numerical evaluations showing that our proposed strategy can achieve superior joint spectrum and power efficiencies optimization for various statistical QoS provisionings. © 2012 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Although the alcohol–water mixtures are ubiquitously important to beverage and pharmacy industries, it remains yet puzzling how the alcohols interact with water molecules and how the alcohol molecules functionalize the hydrogen bond network of liquid water and body fluid. We show spectrometrically that alcohol hydration softens both the H–O bond and the O:H nonbond through hydrogen bond cooperative relaxation and associated charge polarization. Observations suggested that each of the dangling hydroxide group :O:H− (interacts with :O or –H+) and the dangling methyl group C–H+ (with –H+ or :O) is equally capable of interacting with H2O molecules in the form of O:↔:O point compressor, H+↔H+ point breaker, and O:H–O hydrogen bond at the alcohol–water interface without charge sharing or new bond formation. The alcohol–water O:H–O formation enables the solubility and hydrophilicity of the alcohol; the H+↔H+ breaker embrittles the hydration network; the O:↔:O compression shortens the O:H nonbond and lengthens the H–O bond. H–O softening is associated with heat emission and depression of solution melting temperature; the O:H nonbond softening (due to polarization) lowers the critical temperatures for freezing.

        "abstract": "The multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO), the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), and the cooperative communication techniques are widely applied in and significantly improved the essential performances of underwater acoustic (UWA) wireless networks in recent years. However, the challenge of reducing the computational complexity while guaranteeing performances of MIMO-OFDM based UWA wireless networks still remains to be resolved. In this paper, we propose a scheme for transmit antenna selection and relay selection to address this problem as follows. Using the channel station information feedback in the MIMO-OFDM based UWA cooperative communication channel, a single transmit antenna for each underwater sensor and one relay node which can maximize the total channel coefficient are selected to transmit data to the corresponding surface destination station, providing a balanced tradeoff between complexity and performance of the network.",

        "abstract": "The volcanic rocks of the Dahalajunshan Formation from the Adengtao area (Southeast Zhaosu) in the Chinese western Tianshan Mountains are dominantly composed of basaltic andesites which are characterized by enrichment of large ion lithophile elements (LILE), strong depletion of high field strength elements such as Nb, Ta and Ti and highly fractionation of rare earth elements (REEs), These basaltic andesites are intruded by some K-feldspar granite and granite porphyry dykes. The K-feldspar granite dykes are metaluminous and have high Na 2O + K 2O, light rare earth elements (LREEs), Zr, Mb and Y contents, high FeO T /MgO and Ga/ Al ratios, and both the granitoids are depleted in Ba, Sr, P, Ti and Fu. The granitoids (K-feldspar granite and granite porphyry) give Laser-ICPMS zircon U-Pb ages of 354.2 ± 2.3Ma and 339.5 ± 2.3Ma respectively, indicating that the surrounding Dahalajunshan volcanics were formed no later than the earliest stage of the Early Carboniferous. It is proposed that the volcanic rocks of the Dahalajunshan Formation and the Early Carboniferous A-type granites from the Adengtao area in the Southeast Zhaosu were probably formed in a back-arc extensional environment of an active continental margin, based on a combined analysis of the field observations, regional tectonics, and the geochemistry and ages of the rocks.",

        "abstract": "The main obstacle for allogeneic transplantation is delayed hematologic reconstitution and serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The results of 128 patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing HLA-identical (n=52) or HLA-haploidentical/mismatched (n=76) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) performed during the same time period were compared. Patients with HLA-identical HSCT received unmanipulated granulocyte-colony stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (G-PBSCs). Forty-six patients with HLA-haploidentical related HSCT received antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in conditioning regimens followed by the transplantation of the combination of unmanipulated G-PBSCs and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor-mobilized bone marrow (G-BM) and 30 patients with HLA-mismatched unrelated HSCT received ATG in conditioning regimens followed by the transplantation of unmanipulated G-PBSCs. All patients got successful hematopoietic engraftment. The cumulative incidences of grades I to II acute GVHD (aGVHD) on day 100 in the identical, haploidentical related and mismatched unrelated cohorts were 21.2%, 43.5%, and 53.3%, respectively. The cumulative incidences of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) in the identical, mismatched unrelated, and haploidentical related cohorts were 34.6%, 33.3%, and 10.9%, respectively. The 2-year relapse and treatment-related mortality (TRM) rates were 19.2%, 23.9%, 23.3%, and 9.6%, 8.7%, 10% for patients who underwent identical, HLA-haploidentical related, and mismatched unrelated transplantation, respectively. The 2-year probabilities of leukemia-free survival and overall survival were 72.2%, 70.6%, 68.1%, and 76.5%, 77.8%, 70.0% after identical, haploidentical related and mismatched unrelated transplantations, respectively. Multivariate analyses showed that only advanced disease stage and a diagnosis of disease had increased risk of relapse, treatment failure, and overall mortality. In conclusion, it is a feasible approach with acceptable outcomes for patients undergoing HLA-haploidentical related HSCT by the combination of G-PBSCs and G-BM with conditioning regimens including ATG.",

        "abstract": "The ability to resolve conflicts is indispensable to the function of daily life and decreases with cognitive decline. We hypothesized that subjects with different levels of cognitive impairment exhibit different conflict resolution performances and may be susceptible to interference effects at different stages.Sixteen normal controls (NC), 15 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and seven Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients were recruited to perform in a modified Eriksen flanker task.We observed that the AD and MCI patients exhibited smaller accuracy rate and longer response time compared to NC subjects. Longer N2 and P300 latencies were observed in the AD group. Furthermore, the MCI group showed a longer latency than the NC group in the P300 latency. The magnitude of the perceptual and response interference effects was larger in the AD group than the other groups, and the MCI group significantly differed from the NC group at the perceptual level.The ability to resolve conflict decreased with impaired cognition and the perceptual and response interference effects may be useful in distinguishing MCI and AD.The perceptual or response interference effect may potentially be employed as a useful non-invasive probe for the clinical diagnosis of MCI and AD.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A theoretical generalized plane-strain thermo-poro-elastic (THM) wellbore model is developed for application to the conventional overcore stress measurement method, under the situations when the thermal effect cannot be decoupled from the measured strains on the borehole walls. The THM theory developed by Coussy is used to describe the effects of both the pore pressure and the temperature on the stress and strain distributions around an inclined wellbore, which is assumed to be drilled instantly and subjected to initial stresses with arbitrary directions. The Laplace transformation is used to obtain the temperature, pressure, displacement, strain and stresses in the three-dimensional state around the wellbore. As special cases, the solutions of the above field variables are also provided for the poro-elastic (HM), thermo-elastic (TM) and pure elastic (CM) cases. Based on the THM solutions obtained, the stresses at the borehole wall, which vary with time, provide a bridge to find the in situ stresses from the measured strains at the wellbore surface. In this THM overcore stress measurement method, the temperature and the pressure (if a fluid is present) at the wellbore wall are another two parameters that need to be measured for stress inversion.",

        "abstract": "Objective Studies showed that hepatocyte growth factor(HGF)is an critical regulator for barrier function of retinal pigment epithelium(RPE)cells and plays important roles during the transformation of epithelium-to-mesenchyme of RPE cells.This study was to investigate the effect of HGF on cell morphology and surface antigen of human RPE cells. Methods Human RPE cells from normal donor were isolated and cultured in vitro and divided into normal culture group(0.4% calf serum medium)and HGF treated group.20ng/mL recombined human HGF was co-incubated with RPE cells in 0.4% calf serum medium in the latter group.The morphological change of cultured RPE cells was observed under the phase-contrast microscope.The expressions of cytokeratin(AE1/AE3),Vimentin and fibroblast specific protein(Fsp-1)in the RPE cells were detected by immunohistochemistry,and Fsp-1mRNA level in the RPE cells were evaluated in 0,12,24 and 48 hours after HGF treatment by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR). Results After HGF stimulation,the morphology of RPE cells changed from polygon into elongated spindle shape,presenting the characteristics of fibroblasts.The positive cell rate for AE1/AE3 in HGF group(50.1%)was significantly lower than normal group(89.7%)(χ2=38.1,P<0.01),and that of Fsp-1 was obviously increased in HGF group(91.2%)compared with normal group(45.3%)(χ2=48.62,P<0.01).However,the positive cell rate for Vimentin had no obvious change between these two groups(P>0.05).Fsp-1mRNA level increased significantly 12 hours later in HGF group(F=13.761,P=0.002). Conclusion These findings suggest that HGF may play a role in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation of RPE cells.",

        "abstract": "To study the change and significance of the expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and endothelium-selectin (E-selectin) in placenta of patients with pre-eclampsia.Twenty normal pregnant women (control group) and 40 women with pre-eclampsia (pre-eclampsia group, including 16 women with mild pre-eclampsia and 24 women with severe pre-eclampsia) were selected. The cellular distribution of TGF-beta1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin in placenta in both groups was determined by immunohistochemistry, and the mean density was measured by computer image analysis system.(1) The level of TGF-beta1 in placental villous syncytiotrophoblast of pre-eclampsia group (70.7 +/- 0.5) was significantly higher than that of control group (70.3 +/- 0.6), while the level of VCAM-1 and E-selectin in pre-eclampsia group (VCAM-1: 82.5 +/- 0.5, E-selectin: 53.5 +/- 0.5) was significantly lower than that of control group (VCAM-1: 82.8 +/- 0.3, E-selectin: 53.8 +/- 0.4) (P < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences in women with mild pre-eclampsia (TGF-beta1: 70.6 +/- 0.6, VCAM-1: 82.4 +/- 0.6, E-selectin: 53.4 +/- 0.5) and severe ones (TGF-beta1: 70.8 +/- 0.4, VCAM-1: 82.6 +/- 0.5, E-selectin: 53.6 +/- 0.5) (P > 0.05); (2) The level of E-selectin in placental villous capillary endothelial cells of pre-eclampsia group (63.0 +/- 0.5) was significantly higher than that of control group (62.6 +/- 0.4) (P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference in women with mild pre-eclampsia (63.2 +/- 0.4) and severe pre-eclampsia (62.9 +/- 0.5) (P > 0.05).TGF-beta1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin are not only related to placenta shallow bed of pre-eclampsia, but also participate in pathogenic process of vascular endothelial damage of pre-eclampsia.",

Since the orthonormal symmetric wavelets are used, it can be expected to get better compression performance than biorthogonal wavelets. Firstly, the implementation of irreversible real-to-real wavelets is presented and its decomposition process is shown by using allpass filters. Then, the realization of the reversible integer-to-integer wavelets is given by utilizing the invertible implementation of allpass filters. Finally, the coding performance of the orthonormal symmetric wavelets is evaluated and compared with the D-9/7 and D-5/3 wavelets.

        "abstract": "The current study evaluated whether the functional connectivity pattern of the thalamo-cortical network in patients with Alzheimer' s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) would show disease severityrelated alterations.Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were obtained from 35 patients with AD, 27 patients with MCI and 27 subjects with normal cognition (NC). First, the altered functional connectivity pattern in AD patients was evaluated in comparison to NC subjects. Second, the MCI subjects were included to evaluate how different stages of disease affect the functional connectivity pattern of the thalamus. Finally, a correlation analysis was performed between the strength of the functional connectivity of the identified regions and various clinical variables to evaluate the relationship between the strength of functional connectivity and the cognitive abilities of MCI and AD patients.When compared to NC subjects, AD patients showed decreased functional connectivity between the left thalamus and brain regions including the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex, right middle frontal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus. Decreased functional connectivity was also found between the right thalamus and right middle frontal gyrus and left inferior parietal lobule/angular gyrus. In addition, increased functional connectivity was observed between the bilateral thalamus and brain regions including the middle frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, postcentral gyrus and precuneus. Functional connectivity between the bilateral thalamus and the identified brain regions of MCI subjects was intermediate in comparison to the functional connectivity of AD and NC subjects. A significant correlation between the fitted functional connectivity strength and the clinical variables was also detected.Our results revealed disease severity-related alterations of the thalamo-default mode network and thalamocortical connectivity in AD and MCI patients. These results support the hypothesis of network disconnection in AD.",

        "abstract": "Molecular orientation, structure, and phase transition in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of an amphiphilic polymer consisting of a flexible hydrophilic epichlorohydrin-ethylenediamine slightly cross-linking microgel and a number of hydrophobic stearic chains (ES-3) have been studied by infrared (IR) transmission and reflection-absorption (RA) spectroscopy. The infrared study indicates that the LB films of ES-3 possess crystalline, tightly packed methylene chains and extended interchain hydrogen bonds between the amide groups, which connect the alkyl chains with the microgel. A comparison of the band intensities between the transmission and RA spectra suggests that the hydrocarbon chains are highly oriented with a small tilt angle and that N-H and C=O bonds of the amide groups and the interchain hydrogen bonds between the N-H and C=O bonds are nearly parallel to the surface. It is indicated from infrared spectra of LB films of ES-3 prepared under different surface pressures that the alkyl chains are highly ordered even in the film deposited under nearly zero surface pressure, while the microgel core shows some mobility. The phase transitions have been observed in narrow temperature ranges near 65, 105, and 140°C for multilayer LB films of ES-3. The three temperatures are very close to those for the phase transitions of bulk materials of ES-3, but the transitions occur more sharply for the LB films. Of note is that the transition temperatures of the LB films are markedly different from those of the self-assembling (SA) films previously reported. This may be due to structural differences in the alkyl chains between the two kinds of films; the SA films have partial interdigitation of the alkyl tails, while the LB films do not have it. In contrast to LB films of low molecular weight organic dyes, even a one-monolayer LB film of ES-3 shows clear phase transitions at slightly higher temperatures. Probably, the microgels prevent the direct interaction between the substrate and the alkyl chains in the first layer, providing the one-monolayer LB film with clear phase transitions.",

        "abstract": "To explore immunological properties of human umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells (hUCBDSC) and their effect on xenogeneic immune cells in vitro.Immunological phenotype of freshly isolated and cryopreserved hUCBDSCs was evaluated by flow cytometry. Xenogeneic splenic T-cells were stimulated by phytohemaglutinin A (PHA) or dendritic cells in the absence or presence of hUCBDSCs. T-cell proliferation was measured by cell counting kit-8 after 7-day incubation. The proportion of apoptotic cells and CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs) was determined in T-cells activated by PHA in the absence or presence of hUCBDSCs by flow cytometry. Phenotype of dendritic cells, cultured alone or with hUCBDSCs, was analyzed by flow cytometry.Levels of immune molecule expression on freshly isolated hUCBDSCs were as follows: human leukocyte antigen-I (HLA-I) (84.1+/-2.9%), HLA-II (1.6+/-0.3%), CD80 (0.8+/-0.1%), CD86 (0.8+/-0.1%), CD40 (0.6+/-0.1%), and CD40L (0.5+/-0.1%), which was not influenced by cryopreservation. T-cell proliferation in the presence of hUCBDSCs was significantly lower than that of positive control. The coculture led to a 10-fold increase (from 1.2+/-0.3% to 12.1+/-1.4%, P<0.001) in the proportion of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and a reversion of mature dendritic cells, as indicated by the down-regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II molecule (49.3% vs 25.9%, P=0.001), CD80 (47.2% vs 23.3%, P=0.001), and CD86 (40.6% vs 25.1%, P=0.002). When subjected to annexin V binding and propidium iodide uptake assay, the hUCBDSCs did not show the ability to induce apoptosis of xenogeneic T-cells.These results demonstrate low immunogenicity and immunomodulation effect of the hUCBDSCs. Reversion of mature dendritic cells and increase in Treg proportion, but not cell apoptosis, can possibly contribute to the suppression of xenogeneic T-cell proliferation by the hUCBDSCs.",

The supramolecular catalyst, prepared by the host-guest complexation between 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPO) and cucubit[7]uril (CB[7]), was used for biphasic oxidation of alcohols. Cationic TEMPO+, the key intermediate, was stabilized by the electrostatic effect of CB[7] in aqueous phase, thus promoting the formation of TEMPO+ and inhibiting side reactions. Moreover, through the migration into organic phase, TEMPO+ was separated from CB[7] and recovered the high reactivity to drive a fast oxidation of substrates. The adaptive reactivity of TEMPO+ induced an integral optimization of the catalytic cycle and greatly improved the conversion of reaction. This work highlights the unique advantages of dynamic noncovalent interactions on modulating the activity of reaction intermediates, which may open new horizons for supramolecular catalysis.",

        "abstract": "In order to support the diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for differentiated data applications in broad-band wireless networks, advanced techniques such as space-time coding (STC) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are implemented at the physical layer. However, the employment of such techniques evidently affects the subchannel-allocation algorithms at the medium access control (MAC) layer. In this paper, we propose the QoS-driven cross-layer subchannel-allocation algorithms for data transmissions over asynchronous uplink space-time OFDM-CDMA systems. We mainly focus on QoS requirements of maximizing the best-effort throughput and proportional bandwidth fairness, while minimizing the upper-bound of scheduling delay. Our extensive simulations show that the proposed infrastructure and algorithms can achieve high bandwidth fairness and system throughput while reducing scheduling delay over wireless networks.",

        "abstract": "Background   Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant hematologic disease with high incidence in the elderly peoples. The median age of onset is 65 years. There is no standard chemotherapy regimen for elderly AML, especially for AML patients older than 70 years old. Six to eight courses of low-dose or reduced-dose chemotherapy were commonly used in clinical treatment. However, most patients. However, most patients relapsed within six months after chemotherapy. How to prolong the survival of elderly patients with AML is a realistic problem that needs to be urgently solved.   Patients and Methods   From Jan 2017 to May 2018, six elderly patients with AML in our center include in the study. The median age was 74 (70-78) years. According to cytogenetics and molecular mutation, 1 patient were favorable risk with t (8, 21) and AML1-ETO, 3 patients were intermediate risk with karyotype abnormality, and 2 patients were unfavorable risk with complex karyotype and FLT3-ITD mutation. One patient received complete remission (CR) after IA induce scheme, and then, he received 4 courses of DA regimen for consolidation therapy. At last, he stopped chemotherapy because of severe atrial fibrillation and heart failure. Other 5 patients treated with 4-8 courses of decitabine (Dec) +CAG or HAG regimen. Minimal residual disease (MRD) of four patients were negative and two patients were positive before include in the study. Six patiens were given 10-day low dose Dec regimen treatment (5mg/m 2 /day×10 days) for every six weeks, until AML progress.   Results   For 2 MRD positive patients, after 10-day low dose Dec regimen treatment, one patient MRD turn to negative, one patient MRD remained positive, and died after 4 months. Till Jul 2018 (median observation time 10 months), 5/6 patients remained CR and survival with better quality of life. the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were related to hematocytopenia. The most significant reduction of blood cells was hypoleucocytosis, and mainly in the first 2 courses of G-Dec treatment.   Conclusion   Preliminary research shows 10-day low dose Dec regimen treatment has Significant effect and mild side effect on the survival of elderly AML patients. The multicenter, randomized controlled clinical study will conduct to further verify its effectiveness and safety.  Disclosures  No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",

However, considering high loafing tendency in IT-based and distributed environments, this effect should be re-examined. This study examines how KSV impacts on incentive-based relationship in IT-based knowledge management systems. The data were collected from real KM systems in an innovative service company. The results show that, in distributed environment, KSV was still a critical moderators in the prediction of employee's knowledge sharing behaviors. In the electronic KMS environment, the positive relationship between incentive and KS is stronger when employees' perceived KSV is higher. This research contributes theoretically to KS literature in examing the KSV as the three-way moderators on incentive-based relationship in IT-based environment, from real organizational samples.",

However, the use of Peg-Dox in myeloid neoplasms remains poorly studied. In this study, we first tested the role of Peg-Dox in the killing of myeloid cell lines and of primary myeloid leukemia cells. Then, a Peg-Dox-based protocol was used to treat patients with myeloid neoplasms. The results showed that the Peg-Dox and Peg-Dox-based protocols had a similar killing ability in myeloid cell lines and in primary myeloid leukemia cells compared to that of conventional doxorubicin. The complete remission rate was 87.5% and 100% for patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts, respectively, after treatment with Peg-Dox. All patients developed grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicity and recovered approximately 2 weeks after completing chemotherapy. No deaths or other severe complications were reported. Our results showed that Peg-Dox can be used in the treatment of myeloid neoplasms with high rates of complete remission and with mild complications.",

The solute capability of bond transition in terms of the fraction coefficient, follows the relation, f NaX (C) ∝ 1-exp(− C/C 0 ) towards saturation, with C being the solute concentration and C 0  the decay constant. Observations evidence that: (i) the solute ionic field electrification aligns, stretches, and polarizes its neighboring H 2 O molecules, which shortens the H O bond but lengthens the O:H nonbond via O O Coulomb repulsion; (ii) the effect of X −  electrification on the O:H O bond relaxation varies with solute type and solute concentration. Exercises not only verify the essentiality of solvent O:H O bond cooperative relaxation and polarization but also demonstrate the power of DPS that resolves processes occurred upon solvation.",

        "abstract": "We propose a PHY-MAC cross-layer based dynamic-resource allocation (DRA) scheme with diverse QoS guarantees for heterogeneous mobile users over MIMO-OFDM wireless network downlinks. Our scheme differentiates real-time users (e.g., audio/video) from non-real-time users (e.g., data). At the PHY layer, the DRA adaptively allocates transmit antennas and modulation levels for real- and non-real-time users to increase the spectral efficiency while guaranteeing the distinct BER-QoS requirements. Combining with the proposed PHY-layer infrastructure, the DRA at the MAC layer treats real- and non-real-time users differently: (1) it dynamically assigns time-slots for real-time users in a TDM-mode to guarantee the bounded delays; (2) it adaptively allocates subcarriers for non-real-time users in an FDM-mode to maximize the system throughput while retaining fairness among users. We analytically derive the admission-control and time-slot allocation conditions to guarantee the statistical delay-bound for real-time users using the effective bandwidth theory. Also, extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Although tacrolimus (Tac) has immunosuppressive properties and exhibits promising efficacy against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), little is known about Tac in the prophylaxis of GVHD after HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT). In a multicenter randomized controlled trial, 174 patients received haplo-HSCT with GVHD prophylaxis involving short-term Tac (from −8 days to +30 days) or cyclosporine (CsA). The 100 day cumulative incidences of acute GVHD (aGVHD) and grade III–IV aGVHD with the short-term Tac regimen and CsA regimen were 29.1 (19.5–38.7)% vs. 50.0(39.6–60.4)% (p = 0.005) and 3.6(0.0–7.5)% vs. 13.5(6.1–20.9)% (p = 0.027), respectively. There were no significant differences in the incidences of chronic GVHD (cGVHD), relapse and cytomegalovirus infection. Lymphocyte subset analysis showed that T cells decreased to lower levels on the short-term Tac regimen within 3 months of transplantation. The disease-free survival and overall survival on the short-term Tac and CsA regimens were 59.3 (48.9–69.7)% vs. 55.7 (45.3–66.1)% (p = 0.696) and 65.1 (55.1–75.1)% vs. 61.4 (51.2–71.6)% (p = 0.075), respectively. Our findings indicate that the short-term Tac regimen for GVHD prophylaxis in patients undergoing haplo-HSCT is associated with a low incidence and slight severity of aGVHD and did not increase the incidence of relapse and cytomegalovirus infection.",

        "abstract": "Mobile cloud-computing is a wireless network environment that focuses on sharing the publicly available wireless resources. Wireless network virtualization provides an efficient technique to implement the mobile cloud-computing by enabling multiple virtual wireless networks to be mapped onto one physical substrate wireless network. One of the most important challenges of this technique lies in how to efficiently allocate the wireless resources of physical wireless networks to the multiple virtual wireless network users. To overcome these difficulties, in this paper we propose a set of novel game-theory based schemes to resolve the wireless resources allocation problem in terms of transmit power and wireless spectrum. We formulate this wireless resources allocation problem as the gaming process where each mobile user bids for the limited wireless resources from physical substrate wireless networks, and competes with the other mobile-user players bidding for the same resources. Under our proposed game-theory framework, we develop three types of wireless resources request strategies: \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">price-based</italic>\n strategy, \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">correlation-based</italic>\n strategy, and \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">water-filling-based</italic>\n strategy to allocate wireless resources under three different gaming mechanisms. The extensive simulation results obtained validate and evaluate our proposed schemes.",

The systematic protocols were set as 3 forward translations, 2 committee reviews and 1 back-ward translation. The CLVQOL was performed in 100 randomly selected people with low vision (primary group) and 100 people with normal vision (control group). Ninety-four participants from the primary group completed the CLVQOL and repeated 2 weeks later (test-retest group). The results were compared with patient demographics and the internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, item-internal consistency, item-discrimination validity, construct validity and discrimination validity of the CLVQOL were calculated.The review committee agreed that the CLVQOL replicated the meaning of the LVQOL and was sensitive to cultural adaptations. The Cronbach alpha coefficient and the split-half coefficient for the four scales and total CLVQOL scales were 0.75 to 0.97. The test-retest reliability as estimated by intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.69 to 0.95. Item-internal consistency was > 0.4 and item-discrimination validity was generally < 0.40. The varimax rotation factor analysis of the CLVQOL identified four principal factors. All of the scores of four subscales and the total score of CLVQOL of the primary group were lower than those of the control group, both in patients and local residents. CLVQOL scores were highly correlated with visual acuity.The CLVQOL is a culturally specific VRQOL measure instrument. CLVQOL can satisfy conventional psychometric criteria, can discriminate visually healthy populations from low vision patients and is valuable in the clinical practice and in the screening of the community populations.",

        "abstract": "Objective To observe the effects of nerve growth factor(NGF) on the expression of apoptosis-related genes such as c-fos,bcl-2,Fas-L and caspase-3 in the retinal cells in experimental retinal detachment(RD). MethodsTwenty rats were selected,and the right and left eyes were served as experimental group(NGF group) and experimental control group(PBS group),respectively.Two rats were selected as the normal control group.After the RD model was set up by subretinal injection with sodium hyaluronate,5 μL(1 g/L) NGF or 5 μL(1 g/L) PBS were intravitreally injected into the right or left eyes,respectively.The injection was performed every 4 d till the end of the observation period.The expressions of bcl-2,Fas-L,caspase-3,and c-fos were detected by immunohistochemistry at 1.5,3,6,12 h and 1,2,4,8,16,32 d time points. Results The expressions of Fas-L,bcl-2,caspase-3 and c-fos were identified and differed between NGF group and PBS group(P<0.05).The peak of c-fos protein expression was delayed and decreased in NGF group compared with PBS group(P<0.05). Conclusion Intravitreal injection of exogenous NGF can promote the expressions of bcl-2,inhibit the expressions of c-fos and Fas-L, and influence the expressions of caspase-3.All these result in the suppression of the apoptosis of retinal cells after RD.",

        "title": "Review of plausible chemical migration pathways in Australian coal seam gas basins",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Coal seam gas (CSG) or coal bed methane production has grown exponentially in Australia over the last two decades with currently nearly 7000 productive wells and another 18,750 wells planned over the next five to ten years. To address concerns over environmental contamination by hydraulic fracture fluids (HFF) attributed to (i) incidents involving poor surface handling of HFF and other fluids with potential migration pathways in soil and shallow groundwater, and (ii) leakage pathways arising from HFF injection into coal seams and unintended migration of these chemicals, the  National assessment of chemicals associated with coal seam gas extraction in Australia  (the  Assessment ) was undertaken. The  Assessment  included a review of international studies on unconventional gas migration pathways to provide prior knowledge and comparison for use in the Australian study. The international literature highlighted that accidents with HFF were mainly due to surface operations and included leaking equipment and spills. Contamination risks of groundwater from hydraulic fracturing itself were found to be very small based on analysis of micro-seismic and groundwater hydrochemistry data; geologic modelling of vertical fracture growth further reveals a low risk of leakage pathways developing in aquifers confined by deep shale formations. This is due to limitations on the fracture growth vertically across aquitards often hundreds of meters thick, retention within the shale of limited amounts of injected fluid, and preferential fracture growth at shallow depths in the horizontal direction. These arguments are broadly applicable to Australian CSG basins. However, important differences exist, such as the reduced thickness in Australia of the aquitards that separate the targeted gas resource from groundwater. Also, hydraulic fracturing in Australian coal seams is practised only when permeabilities are too low for gas extraction to be economical without stimulation. From the nearly 10,000 CSG wells drilled in the Bowen and Surat Basins in Queensland, only 6% have received hydraulic fracturing to date. The reduced risk of leakage pathways developing during CSG production in Australian basins is further corroborated by geologic criteria based on modelling and observations. Criteria include encountering certain favourable conditions during drilling/injection, i.e. (i) interfaces, such as natural fractures, faults, and bedding planes, which promote offsetting and branching, or rock layers with higher fracture toughness causing the cessation or reduction in fracture growth, (ii) narrow fractures due to a relatively higher elastic modulus, leading to higher viscous flow loss, (iii) high permeability layers, and (iv) overlying layer(s) with a higher confining stress. In addition to the leakage pathways considered in North American shale gas basins involving (i) pre-existing fractures and faults, or (ii) flow up the production well due to poor casing or cementing, plausible chemical migration pathways in Australian CSG basins are due to (iii) connectivity via a fracture in or extended out of the coal seam formation between CSG wells and water bores co-located in the same formation, and (iv) poor integrity water bores enhancing inter-aquifer connectivity. These plausible pathways are described and used in subsequent work as the basis of risk assessments for contamination at the local- and regional scale.",

        "abstract": "We recently reported that Cx43 expression and gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) between acute leukemic bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were deficient, which could recovery after effective chemotherapy. However, the exact role of GJIC in the hematopoietic microenvironment in leukemic cell death and proliferation is not clear. We show here that following transfection with the Cx43 gene, GJIC function was increased between leukemic BMSCs. Furthermore, compared with leukemic cells alone, the proliferation and apoptosis of leukemic cells co-cultured with BMSCs were inhibited, the percentage of G0-phase cells was higher; and expression of p53 increased and bax decreased. However, after co-culturing leukemic cells with Cx43-modified BMSCs, the number of proliferative and spontaneously apoptotic Jurkat cells increased; the percentage of G0-phase cells decreased; the expression of p53 decreased; and bax increased. Compared with Jurkat cells co-cultured with BMSCs and Jurkat cells alone, the sensitivity of leukemic cells co-cultured with Cx43-modified BMSCs to chemotherapeutics increased. Our data suggests that GJIC between leukemia BMSCs is one of the impact factor to the proliferation, apoptosis and drug sensitivity of co-cultured leukemic cells. Up-regulating its function can inhibit the protective effects of leukemic BMSCS and enhance the efficacy of therapies in hematologic malignancies.",

        "abstract": "Factors affecting the efficacy of platelet and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have not been studied extensively. We aimed to evaluate platelet and RBC transfusion efficacy by measuring the platelet corrected count increment and the hemoglobin increment, respectively, 24 h after transfusion in 105 patients who received HSCT.Using retrospective analysis, we studied whether factors, including gender, time of transplantation, the compatibility of ABO group between HSC donors and recipients, and autologous or allogenic transplantation, influence the efficacy of blood component transfusion. We found that the infection rate of HSCT patients positively correlated with the transfusion amount, and the length of stay in the laminar flow room was associated with transfusion. We found that platelet transfusion performed during HSCT showed significantly better efficacy than that performed before HSCT. The effect of platelet transfusion in auto-transplantation was significantly better than that in allo-transplantation. The efficacy of RBC transfusion during HSCT was significantly lower than that performed before HSCT. The efficacy of RBC transfusion in auto-transplantation was significantly higher than that in allo-transplantation. Allo-transplantation patients who received HSCs from compatible ABO groups showed significantly higher efficacy during both platelet and RBC transfusion.We conclude that the efficacy of platelet and RBC transfusions does not correlate with the gender of patients, while it significantly correlates with the time of transplantation, type of transplantation, and ABO compatibility between HSC donors and recipients. During HSCT, the infection rate of patients positively correlates with the transfusion amount of RBCs and platelets. The total volume of RBC units transfused positively correlates with the length of the patients' stay in the laminar flow room.",

The previous study showed that Trichinella spiralis Nd (TsNd) bound to intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), and the vaccination of mice with T7 phage-displayed TsNd polypeptides produced protective immunity. The aim of this study was to clone, express and identify the full-length TsNd and to investigate its immune protection against T. spiralis infection.The full-length cDNA sequence of TsNd gene encoding a 46 kDa protein from T. spiralis intestinal infective larvae (IIL) was cloned and identified. The antigenicity of rTsNd was analyzed by Western blot. Transcription and expression of TsNd at T. spiralis different stages were observed by RT-PCR and IFT. The levels of the specific total IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies to rTsNd were determined by ELISA. The immune protection of rTsNd against T. spiralis infection was investigated.Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that TsNd had a nudix motif located at 226-244aa, which had high homology and the closest evolutionary status with T. pseudospiralis. The rTsNd was obtained after expression and purification. Western blot analysis showed that anti-rTsNd serum recognized the native TsNd protein in crude antigens of muscle larvae (ML), IIL, adult worms (AW) and newborn larvae (NBL), and ES antigens of ML. Transcription and expression of TsNd gene was observed in all developmental stages of T. spiralis (ML, IIL, AW and NBL), with high level expression in IIL. An immunolocalization analysis identified TsNd in the cuticle, stichocytes and reproductive organs of the parasite. Following immunization, anti-rTsNd IgG levels were increased, and the levels of IgG1 were more significantly higher than that of IgG2a. After a challenge infection with T. spiralis, mice immunized with the rTsNd displayed a 57.7% reduction in adult worms and a 56.9% reduction in muscle larval burden.TsNd induced a partial protective immunity in mice and could be considered as a novel candidate vaccine antigen against trichinellosis.",

        "abstract": "This paper is based on the context of electronic knowledge repositories (EKR). There are many problems in people using EKR to share knowledge. We can classify these problems into three types: 1) Free-riding situation, 2) Non-use situation, 3) Dormant situation. Many organizations use rewards to motivate people to contribute knowledge into EKR, but there has been no conclusive evidence of the role of reward. We designed two game-theoretical models: 1) to explain why and how the different knowledge sharing problems occur in EKR and, 2) to promote a better understanding of the effect of rewards in EKR. We found that a reward is misleading if it concentrates only on quantity of knowledge, that is, participants will contribute more quantity but lower quality of knowledge into the network. Our suggestion is that organizations not only add rewards, but also apply some knowledge review systems. The strategy of adding review systems can motivate people to contribute high quality knowledge.",

        "abstract": "In the practical applications of wireless sensor networks, it is almost inevitable that some sensors become faulty during running. The faulty measurement values will cause a burden to the limited energy of sensor networks. Furthermore, wrong judgement might be deduced because of the faulty data when they reach base station. Therefore, proper fault detection especially for long-term large-scale systems is crucial and challenging. Motivated by the requirement of practical applications, we propose a distributed fault detection approach for wireless senor networks. Firstly, Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) model is introduced to characterize the correlations between measurement values and real values of sensor nodes. Then, an errors-in-variables estimation method is presented to obtain the parameters in the HMRF model. Finally, a distributed fault detection algorithm is proposed based on the HMRF model. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed HMRF-based fault detection achieves considerable high detection accuracy and low false alarm rate simultaneously.",

To this end, a water-soluble bifunctional monomer bearing perylene diimide was synthesized, and its supramolecular complex with cucurbit[7]uril was fabricated on the basis of host-guest complexation, which could be reduced to forming radical anions in the presence of E. coli. It was found that this supramolecular complex could display different ability of generating radical anions by facultative anaerobic and aerobic bacteria in terms of their various reductive abilities. The selective antibacterial activity of the supramolecular complex could be realized by the photothermal performance of the radical anions under near-infrared irradiation. It is anticipated that this method may lead to a novel bacteria-responsive photothermal therapy to regulate balance of bacterial flora.",

        "abstract": "This paper determines the impact of two clay minerals (kaolinite and montmorillonite) and three oxides (goethite, δ-MnO, and bayerite) on the elemental composition and FTIR spectra of humic-like acid (HLA) extracted from microbial-mineral residue formed from the microbial utilization of lignin in liquid shake flask cultivation. Goethite, bayerite, and δ-MnO showed higher enrichment capabilities of C and O + S in the HLA than kaolinite and montmorillonite. Goethite showed the highest retention of organic C, followed by bayerite, but kaolinite exhibited the least exchangeability. Kaolinite and montmorillonite enhanced microbial consumption of N, resulting in the absence of N in HLA. A few aliphatic fractions were preferentially gathered on the surfaces of kaolinite and montmorillonite, making the H/C ratios of HLA from the clay mineral treatments higher than those of HLA from the oxide treatments. δ-MnO was considered the most effective catalyst for abiotic humification, and goethite and bayerite ranked second and third in this regard. This trend was proportional to their specific surface areas (SSAs). However, comparing the effects of different treatments on the promotion of HLA condensation by relying solely on the SSA of minerals was not sufficient, and other influencing mechanisms had to be considered as well. Additionally, Si-O-Al and Si-O of kaolinite participated in HLA formation, and Si-OH, Si-O, and Si-O-Al of montmorillonite also contributed to this biological process. Fe-O and phenolic -OH of goethite, Mn-O of δ-MnO, and Al-O of bayerite were all involved in HLA formation through ligand exchange and cation bridges. Lignin was better protected from microbial decomposition by the kaolinite, bayerite, and δ-MnO treatments, which caused lignin-like humus (HS) formation. Under the treatments of δ-MnO, goethite, and bayerite, HLA showed a greater degree of condensation compared to HLA precipitated by kaolinite and montmorillonite. Contributions from Si-O, and Si-O-Al of clay minerals, and Fe-O, Mn-O, and Al-O of oxides were the mechanisms by which minerals catalyzed the formation of HS from lignin.",

We present the recent progress in this regard from the perspective of molecular undercoordination induced O:H-O bond segmental cooperative relaxation and nonbonding electron polarization. The skin molecular undercoordination shortens the intramolecular H-O covalent bond spontaneously from 1.0 to 0.84 Ǻ, while the Coulomb repulsion between oxygen anions lengthens the intermolecular O:H nonbond from 1.70 to 2.71 Ǻ associated with strong polarization. The O:H-O resultant elongation depresses the mass density to 0.75 g/cm 3 ; the polarization results the skin high stress, hydrophobicity, lubricity, viscoelasticity; the H-O contraction shifts its stretching vibration frequency from the bulk value of 3150 to 3450 cm -1  at skin and to 3650 cm -1  of vapor; the O:H elongation shifts its stretching mode from 210 of bulk to 180 cm -1  at skin. Therefore, molecular undercoordination induced O:H-O bond relaxation and the associated polarization govern the performance of molecules at the skins of water and ice.",

        "abstract": "In order to observe the distribution of T.spiralis larvae in muscles of rats and mice and its number in capsule,30 male Kunming mice and 30 male Sprague Dawley(SD)rats were randomly divided into 3 groups(10 animals for each group):i.e.light,moderate and heavy infection groups.Each group was orally inoculated with 1,5 or 20 T.spiralis muscle larvae per gram of body weight,respectively.All infected animals were slaughtered at 42 days post-infection.The muscles were compressed between two slides to examine under microscope for the larval burden(larvae per gram,lpg)and the number in capsule(nurse cell).In rats with light infection,the larval burden in masseter muscle was the highest;in rats with moderate and heavy infection,the muscles contained the highest larval burden was diaphragmatic and lingual muscle,respectively.In mice with light infection,the larval burden in masseter muscle was also the highest;In both groups of mice with moderate and heavy infection,the larval burden in diaphragms was the highest.The frequency of capsules contained 1,2 and 3 larvae among 8028 capsules in infected rat muscles was 97.91%,1.95% and 0.14%,respectively.Out of 7559 capsules in infected mouse muscles,the capsules contained 1,2 and 3 larvae accounted for 97.33%,2.54% and 0.13%,respectively.The detection rate of capsules contained multiple(2-3)larvae in infected mouse muscles was obviously higher than that in infected rat muscles(χ2=5.644,P<0.05).The detection rate of capsules contained multiple larvae in rats and mice has the elevating trend with the increase of infective dose(χ2rat=42.656,P<0.05;χ2mouse=45.713,P<0.05).The muscles of rats and mice with heavy infection accounted for 81.82%(9/11)and 100%(10/10)of the muscles contained the capsules with 3 larvae.The capsules contained more than 4 larvae(4 or more)were not observed.These results indicate that when the epidemiological investigation on murine Trichinella infection was carried out,masseter muscles are preferred for pathogen examination,the next is diaphragm or masseter muscles;the detection of the capsules contained 3 larvae during muscle biopsy or meat quarantine suggests the presence of heavy Trichinella infection.",

        "abstract": "Integrating information theory with the principle of effective capacity, we propose the optimal resource allocation schemes for wireless full duplex and half duplex relay networks, respectively, to support the statistical quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning. In particular, we introduce a new control parameter, termed cancellation coefficient, to characterize the performance of full duplex relay transmission mode. For both amplitude-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relay networks, we develop the dynamic hybrid resource allocation policies under full duplex and half duplex transmission modes to maximize the network throughput for the given delay QoS constraint measured by the QoS exponent. The numerical results obtained verify that our proposed resource allocation schemes can support diverse QoS requirements over wireless relay networks under full duplex and half duplex transmission modes. Our analysis indicates that the optimal effective capacity of perfect full duplex transmission mode is not the just twice as much as the optimal effective capacity of half duplex transmission mode. Our numerical analyses also show that the hybrid transmission mode can achieve better performance than just using full duplex or half duplex transmission mode alone.",

A total of 505 full-time employees in Hong Kong responded to a structured telephone survey. The results showed that time control and perceived distributive justice were positively related to both job satisfaction and organizational commitment. More importantly, the positive relationships between time control and the two job attitudes were stronger when perceived distributive justice was high rather than low. These findings contrast with the typical buffering effects of organizational justice, in which perceived justice attenuates the beneficial effects of positive stimuli.

An effective approach for Green Wireless Communications is On-Demand strategy, which scales power consumption with the volume and location of user demand. Applying the On-Demand Communications model, we propose a novel scheme-Wireless Resource Trading, which characterizes the trading relationship among different wireless resources for a given number of performance metrics. According to wireless resource trading relationship, different wireless resources can be consumed for the same set of performance metrics. Therefore, to minimize the energy consumption for given performance metrics, we can trade the other type of wireless resources for the energy resource under the demanded performance metrics. Based on the wireless resource trading relationship, we derive the optimal energy-bandwidth and energy-time wireless resource trading relationship for green wireless communications. We also develop an adaptive trading strategy by using different bandwidths or different delays for different transmission distances with available bandwidths and acceptable delay bounds in wireless networks. Our conducted simulations show that the energy consumption of wireless networks can be significantly reduced with our proposed wireless resources trading scheme.",

        "abstract": "The difference of seedling photosynthetic characteristics and water use efficiency of ten tree species in central area of Guizhou province were studied. The results showed that:( 1) The curves of diurnal variation of net photosynthetic rate( Pn) in leaves of species showed two peaks,the curves of diurnal variation of transpiration rate( Tr) in leaves of species showed single peaks,water use efficiency( WUE) of Ligustrum lucidum、Broussonetia papyrifera、Toona sinensis were maximum.( 2) Physio-ecological parameters of different tree species showed significant difference. The light compensation and saturation points of Viburnum odoratissimum var. awabuki、Toona sinensis、Castanea seguinii 、Ligustrum lucidum、Koelreuteria paniculata were all high,which showed that they were the intolerant tree species. Light saturation point of Broussonetia papyrifera was high but compensation point was low,which showed that it can adapt to different light environments. The light compensation and saturation points of Michelia Wilsonii、Toona sinensis 、Magnolia denudata、Camellia oleifera were all low,which showed that they were the shade species.( 3) The contents of chlorophyll a、chlorophyll b、chlorophyll gross and carotinoid had significant positive correlation with Pn.( 4) According to clustering analysis,10 tree species were classified into 3 types.Broussonetia papyrifera is one of tree species with excellent photosynthesis characteristic.",

        "abstract": "The phylogenetic location of Chinese Spirometra sparganum isolates remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the phylogenetic location of the Spirometra sparganum isolates from China.The 28S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) D1 sequences of 14 Spirometra sparganum isolates collected from thirteen locations in China were analyzed by using Neighbor-Joining (NJ), maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian inference (BI), respectively. To investigate the deep variance of 28S rDNA D1 region among included species, the secondary structure of 28S rDNA D1 region was also calculated using the program RNA structure.The genus Spirometra as a monophyletic group was evidenced by two inference methods (MP and BI). All sequences within the genus Spirometra had a bulge of a cytosine residue (Bulge C) in the stem 13 of the secondary structure model of 28S rRNA D1 region. Varietal sites in sequences from all thirteen Chinese isolates were appeared in loops. In loops, adenine was the most abundant base (averagely 41.9%) followed by guanine (averagely 30.0%), and cytosine (averagely 15.1%). In stems, the average percentage of G + C (58.3%) was higher than the percentage of A + T (41.7%).The 'Bulge C' in the stem 13 of the 28S rDNA D1 secondary structure could be as a suitable mark to identify the Spirometra species.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biological behavior of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in migration, adhesion and apoptosis as well as the related signaling transduction pathways in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 37 patients with MDS, 10 patients with de novo AML and 14 patients with non-clonal cytopenia diseases were chosen for this study. The expression level of CXCR4 on CD34(+) cells and apoptosis of CD34(+) cells in bone marrow were detected by flow cytometry; the chemotaxis of SDF-1 on bone marrow mononuclear cells in 4 patients with low risk MDS (IPSS score ≤ 1.0) and 5 patients with high risk MDS (IPSS score ≥ 1.5) was assayed by transwell migration test of cells. The effect of SDF-1 on cell adhesion capability was measured by using CCK-8 method. The results indicated that the apoptosis rate of CD34(+) cells was significantly higher in MDS patients with low risk (IPPS score < 1.0) than that in MDS patients with high risk (IPSS score ≥ 1.5) (21.55% vs 7.52%, p < 0.001); as well, the apoptosis rate of CD34(+) cells was significantly higher in MDS patients with low risk than that in de novo AML patients (21.55% vs 7.33%, p < 0.001), no relation of CD34(+) cell apoptosis with age and sex of patients was found. SDF-1 could promote the cells of patients with CXCR4 high expression to adhere to the stroma cells, and induce migration of these cells, as well as, SDF-1 could trigger the polarization of the cells which highly expressed CXCR4. After addition of pertussis toxin, wortmannin and AMD3100, the ability of adhersion and migration of the cells with highly expressed CXCR4 decreased, but there was no above-mentioned phenomenon in patients who lowly expressed CXCR4. It is concluded that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis enhances the ability of cell adhesion and migration through PI3K signaling pathway, thereby plays antiapoptosis role, moreover the above-mentioned effects can be blocked by PI3K pathway inhibitor and G protein inhibitor.",

As such, it is imperative that we better understand how to design IT-based Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) to support high knowledge sharing visibility. This paper examines the impact of knowledge management technology functions (e.g., tracking, knowledge storing) on knowledge sharing visibility through qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with participants in a Chinese company. Impact and implications of use for their existing KMS are examined. Results encourage applied statistical, tracking, knowledge distribution and knowledge storing functions for monitoring explicit knowledge sharing, and suggest integration of knowledge maps with communication tools (e.g., instant messenger) to support visibility for implicit knowledge sharing. Extension to use of web 2.0 technologies (e.g., weblogs) in KMS is also explored.",

        "abstract": "Objective To observe the reconstruction of hematopoietic inductive microenvironment (HIM) and the recovery of megakaryocytes in nude mouse, after transplantation of human umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells (hUCBDSCs). Methods Sixty-three 6w-old female BALB/c-nu/nu nude mice placed in ventilated Plexiglas boxes were exposed to 5.0Gy 60 Co γ ray (dose rate 120cGy/min) to damage their hematopoietic microenviroment. The animals received a transplantation of hUCBDSCs 24h after the exposure in a concentration of 1×105 cells (0.3ml of the cell suspension was injected through the tail vein). Human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs, 1×105 cells/0.3ml) or equal volume of isotonic sodium chloride were injected through the tail vein as control. After the transplantation, the changes in platelet count, megakaryocyte count, CFU-F, bone marrow biopsy and pathology were observed on +1d, +3d, +5d, +7d, +10d, +14d and +21days, respectively. Results Platelet, megakaryocyte and CFU-F counts declined 5-7 days after translpantation (P<0.05). The nadirs of platelet, megakaryocyte and CFU-F counts were 148±18×109/L, 137±35/slide and 88±3/dish in hUCBDSCs group, being higher than that in hBMSCs group and isotonic NaCl group (P<0.05). The platelet, megakaryocyte and CFU-F counts in hUCBDSCs group recovered 21 days after transplantation to the level of that before transplantation, and they were also higher than that in hBMSCs group and isotonic NaCl group (P<0.05). More fibroblasts were seen to be disposed beside the bone trabecula in orderly fashion in hUCBDSCs group than in hBMSCs group and isotonic NaCl group. Conclusion hUCBDSCs transplantation may enhance the recovery of hematopoietic microenvironment in irradiated nude mice, especially the recovery of megakaryocytes and platelets. hUCBDSCs transplantation should be looked as a safe and effective way for recovery of megakaryocytes and platelets after chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",

METHODS: 21 case peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) patients were treated with pretreatment. The changes of morphology of the bone marrow stromal cells were assayed by light microscope and electron microscope, respectively. The numbers of CFU - F were assayed by Dexter type. RESULTS: The bone marrow stromal cells occured different types of morphology from PBSCT patients treated with chemotherapy or chemotherapy - TBI pretreatment, respectively, compared with controls. The transmission electron microscope showed that the endoplasmic reticula was dilated, the matrix of mitochondria appeared pale and the cristae of mitochondria became shorter in stromal cells from chemotherapy - TBI patients compared with those of controls. The structure of mitochondria from combined chemotherapy - TBI pretreatment appeared severe degeneration and disorder. The numbers of CFU - F from combined radiation - chemotherapy injury were significantly decreased compared with that before pretreatment and the chemotherapy injury (P<0.01), respectively. CONCLUSION: The change of cell morphology and capacity of CFU - F for bone marrow stromal cells is one of impairment injury mechanism of bone marrow hematopoietic inductive microenvironment from PBSCT patients post pretreatment.",

        "abstract": "Through the aegis of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), China has embarked on an ambitious effort to regain prominence in innovation and academic contribution to knowledge after decades of relative neglect precipitated by the \"cultural revolution.\" Unfortunately, initial efforts made during the last decade of the 20th century resulted in quick growth in knowledge quantity (e.g., publications) that failed to generate sound growth in knowledge quality (e.g., citations). Incentives in place were not producing desired results. An innovative collaborative Internet-based Science Information System (ISIS) was applied nation-wide in 2003 in China's Research Community (CRC) with a variety of embedded incentives to rectify the situation. The system has been well received. In the year 2005 alone, ISIS helped the NSFC to process more than 53,000 on-line funding applications and 250,000 electronic reviews from 1,400 universities and research institutes in China. This paper is aimed at exploring Information Systems (IS) innovation impact from the perspective of incentive alignment based on CRC empirical results. Since the nation-wide application of ISIS in 2003, CRC outcomes have markedly improved. Discussion and directions for future research examine generalizability in the context of information systems for innovation and collaborative business. Conclusions are drawn.",

        "title": "Heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning over 5G mobile wireless networks.",
        "abstract": "As a critical step towards the next new era of mobile wireless networks, recently 5G mobile wireless networks have received significant research attention and efforts from both academia and industry. The 5G mobile wireless networks are expected to provide different delay-bounded QoS guarantees for a wide spectrum of services, applications, and users with extremely diverse requirements. Since the time-sensitive services in 5G multimedia wireless networks may vary dramatically in both a large range from milliseconds to a few seconds and diversity from uniform/ constant delay-bound to different/variable delay-bound guarantees among different wireless links, the delay-bound QoS requirements for different types of services promote the newly emerging heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning over 5G mobile wireless networks, which, however, imposes many new challenging issues not encountered before in 4G wireless networks. To overcome these new challenges, in this article we propose a novel heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning architecture for 5G mobile wireless networks. First, we develop and analyze the new heterogeneous statistical QoS system model by applying and extending the effective capacity theory. Then, through the wireless coupling channels, we apply our proposed heterogeneous statistical QoS architecture to efficiently implement the following powerful 5G-candidate wireless techniques: 1) device-to-device networks; 2) full-duplex networks; and 3) cognitive radio networks, respectively, for providing heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS guarantees. Finally, using the simulation experiments we show that our proposed architecture and schemes significantly outperform the existing traditional statistical delay-bounded QoS provisioning schemes in terms of satisfying the heterogeneous delay-bounded QoS requirements while maximizing the aggregate system throughput over 5G mobile wireless networks.",

        "abstract": "T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) is a highly aggressive form of lymphoma with poor clinical outcomes and lacks of a standard treatment regimen. In this study, we assessed the safety and efficacy of tandem autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) strategy for adult T-LBL and evaluated prognostic factors affecting survival. 181 Newly-diagnosed adult T-LBL patients were enrolled, 89 patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, 46 patients were allocated to single auto-HSCT group, 46 patients were treated with tandem auto-HSCT. The median follow-up time was 37 months, the 3-year progression/relapse rate of the tandem auto-HSCT group was significantly lower than that of the single auto-HSCT group and chemotherapy group (26.5% vs 53.1% and 54.8%). The 3-year PFS and OS rate of the tandem auto-HSCT group (73.5% and 76.3%) were significantly higher than those of the single auto-HSCT group (46.9% and 58.3%) and the chemotherapy group (45.1% and 57.1%). In the tandem auto-HSCT group, age and disease status after the first transplantation impacted the OS and PFS. Multivariate analysis identified that disease status after the first transplantation was the only independent prognostic factor for patients treated with tandem-HSCT. In addition, diagnostic models of the initial CD8+CD28+/CD8+CD28- T cell ratio in predicting the disease status were found to be significant. Taken together, tandem auto-HSCT can be considered an optimal strategy for adult T-LBL patients (ChiCTR-ONN-16008480).",

We hypothesized that the impairment in the amygdala-cortical loop would be more severe in a follow-up MCI group than in a baseline MCI group and that these alterations would be related to the disease processes. To test this hypothesis, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate alterations in amygdalar connectivity patterns based on longitudinal data from 13 MCI subjects (8 males and 5 females). Compared to the baseline, decreases in functional connectivity were mainly found located between the amygdala and regions at the conjunction of the temporal-occipital system and the regions included in the default mode network in the follow-up MCI individuals. The alterations in the functional connectivity of the identified regions were validated in an independent dataset. Specifically, reduced amygdalar connectivity was significantly correlated with cognitive abilities. These findings indicate that impairments in the functional connectivity of the amygdala may be potential biomarkers of the progression of MCI.",

By interplaying theoretical predictions, numerical computations, and phonon spectrometrics, we firstly examined the relaxation dynamics of O:H-O bond segmental length and phonon stiffness of: i) liquid water at 300 K and ice at 80 K as a function of pressure, ii) liquid water cooling from 350 K to 80K under the ambient pressure, iii) mechanical freezing of the ambient water under compression up to 1.83 GPa, and, iv) liquid water heating from 253 to 753 K under 30 MPa pressure. Observations allow us to classify the T-c(P) phase boundaries of water and ice into four types according to their slopes and then formulate them in terms of hydrogen bond relaxation in segmental length and containing angle. Observations reinforce the essentiality and effectiveness of hydrogen bond notion in dictating the unusual behavior of water and ice and clarify the bonding dynamics during phase transition, which is beyond the scope of classical thermodynamics.

Metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFET) were designed for the measurements of FET characteristics. At the same time, oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (OSFET) were specially designed with a long gate area for the measurements of gas sensitivity of phthalocyanine LB film. To obtain high sensitivity of the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) gas sensor, FETs with depletion(D) p-channel mode were selected to be fabricated on the same monolithic silicon. LB multilayer films of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) were later transferred to the long gate area of OSFET(D), forming the structure of LB-OSFET(D). The measurement of gas sensitivity for the LB-OSFET(D) sensor showed that higher sensitivity to NO 2 could be obtained because of the effect of exhausted mode used in FET. This sensor can detect NO 2 up to 0.1 ppm; it also exhibits good stability, excellent selectivity, and rapid response and recovery.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Blogging is becoming increasingly popular as a global phenomenon. Individual blog traffic and blogosphere structure are of interest to academia and practice. Although it is difficult to get a snapshot of the blogosphere with enough blogs over a long enough period to capture the real situation, chaos theory finds underlying order in this apparent random and complex phenomenon. This study provides an overall view of blogging from micro (individual blog traffic dynamics) and macro (blogosphere structure) levels through a chaos theory lens. Key concepts of chaos theory are used to construct an interpretive framework to illustrate blog system behavior dynamics. Blog systems tend to be nonlinear, dynamic, and deterministic, as well as sensitive to initial conditions. The study also demonstrates the feasibility of applying chaos theory thinking to areas such as knowledge management and the recent global financial crisis. Implications for practice and research opportunities are presented.",

        "abstract": "In this study, a novel photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor based on two-dimensional (2D) porphyrinic covalent organic frameworks (p-COFs) for the label-free detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) is presented. The obtained p-COFs possess high conductivity and an improved stability due to strong and rigid covalent linkages. The introduction of p-COFs hinder the recombination of electrons and holes, decreasing their band gap (E), thereby which improved the photocurrent conversion efficiency. Compared with pure porphyrin, p-COFs exhibited enhanced photocurrent intensity. An amplified photocurrent conversion efficiency and enhanced photocurrent results from HO, which act as active molecules and electron donors. As an unprecedented application of COFs in PEC bioanalysis, the detection of CRP with a PEC aptasensor is presented. The assembly of a CRP aptamer on the surface of Ag nanoparticles hinders the electron transfer, resulting in the decrease of the photocurrent response. This PEC aptasensor exhibits good analytical performances such as a rapid response, high stability, wide linear range and excellent selectivity, making COFs promising candidates for PEC bioanalysis.",

The conventional method located as many zeros as possible at z = - 1 to obtain the maximum number of vanishing moments. In this paper, we specify the number of zeros at z = - 1, and then use the remaining degree of freedom to get the best possible frequency selectivity. The Remez exchange algorithm is applied in the stopband to approximate the equiripple magnitude response. Therefore, a set of filter coefficients can be obtained easily by solving a system of linear equations. Furthermore, the optimal solution is attained through a few iterations. Since the number of zeros at z = -1 can be specified arbitrarily, a new class of Hilbert transform pairs of orthonormal wavelet bases with the specified number of vanishing moments can be generated.",

Methods Sixty patients were divided into transplantation and non-transplantation groups. The thirty-four advanced patients with malignant hemopathy as transplantation group received auto-PBSCT after first remission induction and three/four courses intensification treatment. After auto-PBSCT, patients received high dose of IL-2 treatment for 28 days and long-interval maintenance therapy per 3～4 months. TA, MA, MP and CTOD were the frequently used treatment prescription. For non-transplantation group the twenty-six patients received the conventional chemotherapy. Results Thirty-four patients had rapid hematopoietic reconstitution after auto-PBSCT. There was no hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) related death. After two years of long-interval maintenance therapy, ten of twenty patients were relapse (50%), including six died patients. Sixteen of thirty-four patients were relapse (47.1%), including eight died patients. The 3 year disease-free survival (DFS) was (43.0±7.1)%. Twenty of twenty-six patients with conventional chemotherapy were relapse (76.9%), including twelve died patients. The 3 year DFS was (19.2±6.2)%.Conclusions Auto-PBSCT combine with long-interval maintenance therapy could be used as an important treatment owing to its low HSCT related death and relatively long DFS.",

        "abstract": "Both nitrous oxide (NO) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions are typically high in greenhouse-based high N input vegetable soils. Biochar amendment has been widely recommended for mitigating soil NO emissions in agriculture. However, knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms of fresh and aged biochar for both NO and NO production during ammonia oxidation is lacking. Two vegetable soils with different pH values were used in aerobic incubation experiments with 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO), 1-octyne and acetylene. The relative importance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) to NO and NO production was investigated as influenced by fresh and aged biochar amendments. The results showed that AOA dominated NO production in acidic soil, while AOB dominated NO production in alkaline soil. Aged biochar stimulated both AOA- and AOB-derived NO and NO production by 84.8 and 340%, respectively, in acidic soil but only increased AOA-derived NO and NO production in alkaline soil. Fresh biochar amendment increased AOA- and AOB-derived NO in acidic soil and AOA-derived NO in alkaline soil but had negligible effects on AOA- and AOB-derived NO in both soils. Fresh biochar decreased AOA-amoA but increased AOB-amoA gene abundances in acidic soil, whereas aged biochar increased AOA- and AOB-amoA gene abundances in both soils. These findings improved our understanding of NO and NO production mechanisms under different biochar amendments in alkaline and acidic vegetable soils.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To explore the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome(OSAS) and cognitive impairment in the elderly using neuropsychological test and polysomnography at home. METHODS: Eighteen patients with OSAS and 18 controls were tested by polysomnography at home, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index(PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale(ESS), mini-mental state examination(MMSE),Wechsler Memory Scale,clock drawing,word list recall and digital symbol test. RESULTS: The OSAS subjects were decreased significantly in delta sleep ratio, minimum and mean saturation of blood oxygen,and increased in apnea and hypopnea index(P<0.05). Performances on the MMSE, Wechsler Memory Scale, digital symbol test, clock drawing in the OSAS were impaired significantly compared with the control group. The results of MMSE were significantly associated with age (r=-0.533,P<0.05) and mean saturation(r= 0.409,P<0.05). The results of memory quotient (MQ) were significantly associated with MMSE(r=0.726,P<0.05) and sleep latency(r=0.495,P<0.05) and desaturation index (r=0.645,P<0.05). The mild cognitive impairment subjects accompanied with OSAS were decreased in the sleep latency, increased in ESS(P<0.05), and the results of ESS were significantly correlated with BMI(r=0.802,P=0.0094). CONCLUSION: The elderly with OSAS has less deep sleep and decreased blood oxygen level at night.There is a relationship between OSAS and cognitive impairment in the elderly.",

        "abstract": "A task that naturally emerges in recommender system is to improve user experience through personalized recommendations based on user's implicit feedback, such as news recommendation and scientific paper recommendation. Recommendations dealing with implicit feedback are most thought of as One Class Collaborative Filtering (OCCF), which only positive examples can be observed and the majority of data are missing. The idea to introduce weights for treating missing data as negatives has been shown to help in OCCF. But existing weighting approaches mainly use the statistical properties of feedback to determine the weight, which are not very reasonable and not personalized for each user-item pair. In this paper, we propose to improve recommendation by considering the rich user and item content information to assist weighting the unknown data in OCCF. To incorporate the useful content information, we get a content topic feature for each user and item by using probabilistic topic modeling method, and determine the personalized weight of every unknown user-item pair by these content topic features. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm can achieve better performance than the state-of-art methods. © Springer-Verlag 2012.",

As a consequence, various MAC solutions have been proposed suiting to different application characteristics [1]. However, MAC protocols are typically implemented in a monolithic fashion -- specific to a particular hardware platform. This hinders the possibility of code re-use across different platforms, which makes both implementation and porting cumbersome. It also imposes difficulties in protocol redesign when the application requirements change since the entire radio stack needs to be modified.",

        "abstract": "Asymptotic near-tip fields are analyzed for a plane strain Mode I crack propagating dynamically in non-associative elastic-plastic solids of the Drucker-Prager type with an isotropic linear strain hardening response. Eigen solutions are obtained over a range of material parameters and crack speeds, based on the assumption that asymptotic solutions are variable-separable and fully continuous. A limiting speed, beyond which a tendency to slope discontinuity in angular distributions of stresses and velocities is detected, is found to deviate from the associative models. At low strain- hardening rates, the onset of the plastic potential corner zone ahead of the crack-tip imposes another limit to the crack speed. Correspondingly, those limits imply the limits to the degree of non-associativity at a given crack speed. In addition, a tendency to slope discontinuity in the angular radial stress distribution sets another limit on the non- associativity at vanishing hardening rates. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

        "abstract": "To perform a short-term and a long-term cost-utility analysis of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) surgery in Shanghai, China.A total of 117 patients who underwent RRD surgery at Shanghai First People's Hospital, Affiliated Shanghai Jiaotong University, and then underwent follow-up for at least 1 year, were included in the study. Costs associated with RRD surgery and time trade-off utility values before and after surgery were recorded. Short-term analysis was made for 1 year. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by RRD surgery over the lifetime were calculated at a 3% discount rate in the long-term analysis. This study used the bootstrap method in statistical analysis and one-way sensitivity analyses to test robustness of the results.Compared with no treatment, the mean incremental costs of RRD surgery was 11,384 Chinese yuan (CN¥) (US$1751); the mean additional QALYs gained was 0.05 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.06) for 1 year and 0.88 (95% CI 0.64-1.13) for life expectancy; the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was CN¥224,921 (US$34,603)/QALY for the short-term, and CN¥13,794 (US$2122)/QALY for the long-term. In short-term analysis, the ICER was CN¥150,087 (US$23,090)/QALY for scleral buckling surgery, and CN¥507,727 (US$78,112)/QALY for vitreous surgery. In the long-term analysis, the ICER was CN¥6280 (US$966)/QALY for scleral buckling, and CN¥30,756 (US$4732)/QALY for vitreous surgery.For RRD patients, surgery increases QALYs. In a 1-year analysis, surgery is not a cost-effective treatment, however it is cost-effective over the lifetime.",
