        "abstract": "It was the aim of this study to evaluate the distribution and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in kidneys of patients with preeclamptic nephropathy and their relationship with clinical and pathological manifestations.From May 1993 to August 2004, 19 patients with a mean age of 28.1 +/- 4.53 years (range 23-40), diagnosed with preeclamptic nephropathy by renal biopsy, were enrolled in this study. Fifteen were nulliparous and 4 multipara. Their renal tissues were subjected to immunohistochemical staining by a four-layer peroxidase-antiperoxidase method using monoclonal anti-VEGF. Residual normal renal tissue obtained at nephrectomy served as control. The relationship between the expression pattern of VEGF and clinicopathological features was also investigated.The expression of VEGF markedly increased in renal tissues of patients with preeclamptic nephropathy at the early stage of gestation termination in comparison with normal controls. However, over time, it gradually decreased and reached the level of normal controls (100 vs. 71.43 vs. 20%, p < 0.05). The degree of endothelial proliferation in the glomeruli was closely related to the expression of VEGF, which was stronger in patients with diffuse endothelial proliferation than in those with segment proliferation (p < 0.05). In addition, there was a proportional relationship between the expression of VEGF and the level of urinary protein excretion (p < 0.05).The patients with preeclamptic nephropathy showed strong expressions of VEGF in glomeruli, which were closely associated with glomerular endothelial lesions and proteinuria, and over time, gradually weakened to normal level after gestation termination.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To evaluate the effectiveness of continuous blood purification (CBP) in three crush syndrome patients related to the earthquake. Methodology:Three victims from Wenchuan earthquake on May 12,2008 in the Southwest China were admitted to our hospital 11,11 and 18 days after their injuries. The duration to salvage was 5.5,22.5 and 28 hrs respectively. All of them were diagnosed as oliguric ARF,vigorous treatment in the local hospital including aggressive fluid infusion,fasciotomy and hemodialysis in the first 2 cases and CBP in the third patients. On admission,the first two cases were still oliguric,and had the high level of serum myoglobin (765 and 829 ng/ml); the third was in the polyuric stage (who had received CBP in the local hospital with polyuria of 5 000~9 000 ml/d),and the serum myoglobin was normal. Further debridement and drainage was performed. Continuous high volume hemofiltration (CHVHF) was conducted in all of patients,the replacement fluid rate was 4 L/h,citrate or combined with low molecular weight heparin was used for anticoagulation,and central venous pressure (CVP) was monitored to keep volume equilibrium. The blood and fresh frozen plasma were transfused. Erythropoietin and Cordyceps sinensis Sacc was used to promote regeneration of tubular epithelial cells,and enteral nutrition formula was administered. Results:CBP was well tolerated in all of patients,and the hemodynamic status was stable. No complication related with CBP and anticoagulation was noted. The body temperature and WBC decreased to normal gradually,anemia and hypoalbuminia was corrected. The levels of serum myoglobin and creatine phosphokinase were also decreased to normal range. The urine volume of the first two cases increased to normal after 20 and 22 days of oliguria,and it decreased to normal in the third after 16 days of polyuria. The tubular function recovered well in all of cases. The clearance of myoglobin during HVHF was 9.5 ml/min with the replacement fluid rate of 4 L/h and 5.9 ml/min with 2 L/h. All of patients were recuperated. None of them was performed amputation. Conclusion:CBP was effective in the treatment of crush syndrome related with earthquake. Fluid equilibrium,clearance of myoglobin,avoidance of bleeding and infection were fundamental during CBP.",

        "abstract": "Solid electrolyte is regarded as a perfect way to enhance safety issues and boost energy density of lithium batteries. Herein, we developed a type of free-standing poly(propylene carbonate)/Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 composite solid electrolyte for ambient temperature and flexible solid-state lithium batteries. The composite solid electrolyte exhibited excellent comprehensive performance in terms of high ionic conductivity (5.2 × 10−4 S cm−1) at 20 °C, a wide electrochemical window (4.6 V), high ionic transference number (0.75) and satisfactory mechanical strength (6.8 MPa). When evaluated as solid electrolyte for an ambient-temperature solid lithium battery, such a composite electrolyte delivered excellent rate capability (5C) at 20 °C. This superior performance can be comparable to a liquid electrolyte-soaked PP separator-based lithium battery at room temperature. To our knowledge, this is the best rate capability of a solid composite electrolyte for a solid lithium battery at ambient temperature. Moreover, such a composite electrolyte-based flexible LiFePO4/Li4Ti5O12 lithium ion battery delivered excellent rate capability and superior cycling stability. All these fascinating features make poly(propylene carbonate)/Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 a very promising all-solid-state electrolyte for flexible solid lithium batteries. Our study makes a big step into addressing the challenges of ambient-temperature solid lithium batteries.",

The effects of concentration, pH and temperature on oxygen contents of nickel powders were investigated in the washing processes which use BTA as oxidation inhibitor. Under the conditions of BTA mass fraction of 0.5%, 30°C and pH=3.0, the oxygen content of CVD nickel powders after modification decreases from mass fraction of 0.62% to 0.25% and achieves similar advanced standards (0.3%). Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR) testified that the coordinations between the unsaturated nitrogen atoms in the triazole ring and the surface of nickel powder takes place, forming a coating to protect nickel powders from oxidation. Nickel powders were coated using BTA, HMTA, and BTA + PVP 20000 as covering. SEM, Laser size analysis and ultraviolet spectrophotometry were carried out to evaluate the dispersibility of nickel powders after coating. The results show that the dispersibilities of nickels coated with BTA + PVP20000 improve significantly with the average particle size of nickle powder decreases from 2.28 to 1.03 μm and transmittance decreases from 0.476 to 0.0859.",

        "abstract": "Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is upregulated in podocytes of glomerular diseases and crucially mediates podocyte injury through integrin β3 (ITGB3). We previously showed that the miR-30 family maintains podocyte structure and function by inhibiting injurious calcineurin signaling through nuclear factor of activated T cells C (NFATC). Here, we tested whether the miR-30-calcineurin-NFATC and uPAR-ITGB3 pathways, two of the major pathways leading to podocyte injury, could interact. We found that podocyte-specific miR-30 knockdown in mice induced uPAR upregulation and ITGB3 activation, accompanied by proteinuria and podocyte injury. These effects of miR-30 knockdown were reduced using inhibitors of ITGB3, calcineurin, and NFATC, respectively, which are known to be antiproteinuric. These results indicate that miR-30 deficiency leads to calcineurin-NFATC signaling activation, which in turn activates the uPAR-ITGB3 pathway. In cultured podocytes, miR-30 knockdown also activated uPAR-ITGB3 signaling, leading to Rho GTPase activation, synaptopodin downregulation and podocyte injury. To explore uPAR-ITGB3 signaling regulation by miR-30 in podocytopathy development, we treated mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and found that miR-30 was downregulated in podocytes, accompanied by uPAR upregulation and ITGB3 activation. We obtained the same results in cultured podocytes treated with LPS. Podocyte-specific transgenic miR-30 abolished uPAR-ITGB3 signaling and ameliorated podocyte injury and proteinuria in mice. Taken together, these experiments show that uPAR-ITGB3 signaling is negatively regulated by miR-30 through calcineurin-NFATC pathway, a novel mechanism underlying podocyte injury in glomerular diseases. Our study has elucidated the relationship among the crucial players governing podocyte pathophysiology and the antiproteinuric actions of drugs commonly used for podocytopathies.",

        "abstract": "Triptolide (TP) has an anti-proteinuric effect and is used for the treatment of podocytopathies. TP has also been shown to act directly on immortalized podocytes in culture to protect them from injury. In the present study, we examined the effect of TP on healthy podocytes both in vitro and in vivo to better understand the action of TP on podocytes. We found that treatment of TP at 10 ng/ml, a concentration that is routinely used for podocyte protection, was sufficient to activate pro-apoptotic signaling of MAPK p38, p53 and BAX and induced apoptosis in cultured podocytes; and higher concentrations of TP exacerbated the p38, p53 and BAX activations and apoptosis. Moreover, TP severely downregulated the genes that are essential for podocyte structure and function. Interestingly, in contrast with other agents TP-induced podocyte injury was not prevented by glucocorticoids. In vivo, high-dose TP treatment for prolonged time did not cause podocyte injury, essential genes downregulation, and proteinuria in mice. TP was also not toxic to the podocytes with isolated glomeruli ex vivo. In summary, TP is toxic to immortalized podocytes in culture but not to the podocytes in animals or isolated glomeruli ex vivo. Our study suggests that immortalized podocytes might have genetically evolved to become sensitive to TP toxicity and thus caution should be taken in interpreting data from immortalized podocytes. Nevertheless, in vivo TP could be as safe as glucocorticoids in treating podocytopathies. Finally, TP may be used as a unique in vitro model for studying steroid-resistant podocytopathies.",

Methodology:One handrend and twenty patients with proliferative and membranous lupus nephritis were 1∶1 randomized to the multi-target therapy (n=60) and IVCY (n=60) groups. The induction course of treatment was initially set to 6 months,and it was prolonged to 9 months if subjects did not achieve complete remission within 6 months. All patients received intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy at the beginning,followed by oral prednisone. Tacrolimus (FK506) was given at 4mg/d,and mycopholate mofetil (MMF) 1.0 g/d. IVCY was given monthly 0.75 g/m2 BSA. Results:Analysis revealed a higher complete remission rate in the multi-target therapy group than that in the IVCY group after both 6 months (51.7% vs 26.7%,P<0.01) and 9 months (63.3% vs 35.0%,P<0.01),respectively. The complete remission rates of Class ⅡI,IV,V,V+ⅡI and V+IV reached 75.0%,60.0%,57.1%,66.7% and 66.7% respectively after 9-month multi-target therapy. No death occurred as a side-effect of the treatment. Multi-target therapy was well tolerated,although new-onset hypertension (10.0%) and hyperglycemia (5.0%) was relatively frequent in Multi-target therapy than that in IVCY. Conclusion:Our data demonstrated that Multi-target induction therapy was superior to IVCY for inducing complete remission of severe lupus nephritis and well tolerated.",

In order to make the linear relationship between the inflow and the outflow of the assembly boundary, the fission cross sections were divided by the keff of the reactor core, thus the eigen-value problem was transformed into a fixed source problem. As a result, the coupling correlation of J+ and J- could be decided by the linear coupling coefficients of them. Through iteration calculation in the reactor core, the keff of the reactor core and the boundary flows of every assembly could be worked out, and then the flux distribution was got. The C5G7 benchmark equivalent error was calculated and analyzed by using two dimensional SN program SN2D. The results show that this method can get better keff and assembly power without group and angle merging, but the precision for pin power still needs to be improved in further studies.",

Peritonitis incidence, patient and technique survival, cardiovascular status, causes of death, and drop-out were compared between the groups.In the 370 patients of the CQI group and the 249 patients of the control group, the predominant underlying kidney diseases were chronic glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy. After implementation of the CQI initiative, the peritonitis rate declined to 1 episode in 77.25 patient-months from 1 episode in 22.86 patient-months. Ultrasound parameters of cardiac structure were generally unchanged in the CQI group, but significant increases in cardiothoracic ratio and interventricular septal thickness were observed in the control group (both p < 0.05). Patient survival at 1, 2, and 3 years was significantly higher in the CQI group (97.3%, 96.3%, and 96.3% respectively) than in the control group (92.6%, 82.4%, and 67.3% respectively, p < 0.001). Implementation of the CQI initiative also appeared to significantly improve technique survival rates: 95.6%, 92.6%, and 92.6% in the CQI group compared with 89.6%, 79.2%, and 76.8% in the control group (p < 0.001) after 1, 2, and 3 years respectively.Integration of a CQI process into a PD program can significantly improve the quality of therapy and its outcomes.",

In order to measure the impact of the information transmission between non-adjacent nodes in online social networks, a closeness evaluating algorithm of the adjacent nodes and the non-adjacent nodes is given based on the relational features between users. By using the algorithm, the closeness between the adjacent nodes and the non-adjacent nodes can obtained depending on the interaction time of nodes and the delay of their hops. Furthermore, a more accurate and efficient betweenness centrality scheme based on the optimized algorithm with the degree of closeness and the corresponding updating strategy. The opinion leader nodes should be identified more accurately and efficiently under the improved algorithm because the considering of closeness between nodes in the network.

        "abstract": "The epidemic of diabetic nephropathy (DN) has been paralleled by rapid increases in both obesity and diabetes in China. The aim of this study was to investigate the natural history of DN and the association of obesity and renal function with diabetes.In total, 264 patients with renal biopsy-confirmed DN were examined from 2002 to 2008 and followed up to June 2008 in our institute. Among these, 129 patients were classified into a Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) stage I subgroup. Weight status, clinico-histopathological features, the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and increased proteinuria were evaluated at the baseline of biopsy and during the follow up. Lean, overweight and obese phenotypes were defined as body mass index (BMI) less than 25 kg/m2, 25-28 kg/m2, and more than 28 kg/m2 over, respectively.In the patients with renal biopsy-confirmed DN, BMI was 25.5 ± 3.39 kg/m2, with 122 (46.2%), 83 (31.4%) and 59 (22.3%) having lean, overweight and obese phenotypes, respectively. Mean proteinuria was 3.09 ± 2.32 g/24 h, serum creatinine was 2.02 ± 2.02 mg/dL, and creatinine clearance rate (Ccr) was 96.0 ± 54.0 mL/min/1.73 m2. Compared with obese patients, lean patients had a lower Ccr, a higher percentage of anemia, more renal lesions and higher risk for ESRD (HR = 1.812, P = 0.048). The weight in obese patients decreased significantly after 27 months, and lean patients had a longer duration of diabetes than obese patients. Regarding patients at K/DOQI stage I, patients with DN showed similar duration of diabetes regardless of weight status. Minimal weight loss was recorded in obese patients during follow-up, and they exhibited greater glomerular hyperfiltration and higher risk for increased proteinuria (HR = 2.872, P = 0.014) than lean patients.In China, obesity is common in DN patients undergoing biopsy. Initial high levels of proteinuria and subsequent weight loss are the major characteristics of the natural course of DN. Obesity contributed to increased proteinuria at an early stage, while the lean phenotype was associated with ESRD development, especially at the later stages.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sirolimus is a new generation of immunosuppressive agent with little renal toxicity, as well as effects of anti-proliferation and anti-tumor, which can decrease the occurrence of adverse reaction such as hepatic and renal toxicity, as well as serious infection in renal transplant recipients. OBJECTIVE: To verify the efficacy and safety of conversion treatment with sirolimus in renal transplant recipients using the calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) with one or more risk factors. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: A retrospective analysis on cases was performed in the Research Institute of Nephrology, Nanjing General Hospital of Nanjing Military Command from June 2003 to December 2006. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 93 patients performed conversion treatment with sirolimus after renal transplantation. They consisted of 59 males and 34 females, with an average age of (38.2±11.1) years. Among them, CNI induced renal toxicity were in 13 (13.9%) cases, CNI induced hepatic toxicity were in 26 (28.0%) cases, post-transplantation diabetes mellitus were in 11 (11.8%) cases, chronic allograft nephropathy were in 33 (35.5%) cases, and post-transplantation tumor were in 10 (10.8%) cases. METHODS: Rapid conversion with sirolimus was performed in all patients. The CNI withdrawal was in 2 weeks. At 4 hours after oral administration of cyclosporin A or Tacrolimus, the patients took sirolimus. Initial dose of sirolimus was 6 mg, and repeated maintenance dose is 1.0-2.0 mg/d. The first concentration of sirolimus was detected at 5-7 days after first oral administration, and the target concentration was 6-10 μg/L. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum creatinine levels, incidence of acute rejection, loss rate of grafts, pulmonary infection, and mortality rates were dynamically observed after conversion with sirolimus. RESULTS: The symptoms were markedly improved in patients with CNI induced renal toxicity and CNI induced liver toxicity, and the concentration of sirolimus were maintained at (5.1±1.2) μg/L. Serum creatinine levels decreased from (297.72±150.28) μmol/L to (123.76±44.2) μmol/L, and the liver function were recovery in 24 (92.3%) patients. 9 patients with high glucose returned to normal, and 2 patients were improved. Serum creatinine levels decreased more than 25% of primary level in 17 patients, and the effective rate was 51.5%. 10 patients with tumor were appeared 6-43 months after renal transplantation, no recurrence was found in 8 of them and 2 patients were dead. Acute rejections were occurred in 3 patients at 6 months after conversion treatment. The complications were included hyperlipidemia and proteinuria. 3 patients were dead, 6 patients returned to dialysis treatment, and 2 patients were removal of grafts. At 3 years after conversion treatment, the survival rates of patients and grafts were 90.9% and 75.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The conversion treatment with SRL and MMF may be a better option for the renal transplant recipients using the CNI with risk factors appeared.",

The samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission\n electron microscopy (TEM). The results reveal that the as-prepared powders are microsized single-crystalline Co3O4 with cubic spinel structure. An increase in the high-temperature hydrolysis time results in the evolution of particle shapes\n from cube to quasi-sphere, and then to octahedron. The effect of NaCl additive on the surface morphologies of Co3O4 particles was experimentally investigated. The results indicate that the NaCl additive acts as an inert disperse phase in\n the high-temperature hydrolysis, and prevents the aggregation of Co3O4 particles effectively.",

        "abstract": "Endothelium dysfunction is one of the critical pathophysiologic disorders in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). To investigate the effect of continuous blood purification (CBP) on endothelial function, we conducted a prospective study of 20 patients with SAP, 9 of whom had evidence of sepsis.All patients underwent CVVH for 72 h. Soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), soluble thrombomodulin, permeability of the endothelial monolayer, and endothelial intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i ) levels were used as the markers for the assessment of endothelial function and the effect of CBP therapy in patients with SAP. Blood samples were taken from the patients at 0, 2, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h during CVVH therapy. sE-selectin and thrombomoduiln were measured by ELISA. The endothelial permeability and activation were evaluated using cultured endothelial monolayer and intracellular Ca2+ concentration.The results showed that during CVVH treatment, the hemodynamics and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were stable. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score was improved significantly after CVVH. Endothelial dysfunction was evident in patients with SAP as compared to normal controls. Patients with SAP had increased levels of sE-selectin, endothelial permeability and intracellular [Ca2+]i , which was higher in patients with sepsis than in those without sepsis. The level of thrombomodulin showed a tendency to increase; however, these changes were not significant between SAP patients and controls. After CBP treatment, sE-selectin levels substantially decreased in all patients. CBP treatment also significantly diminished the endothelial permeability and decreased the intracellular [Ca2+] concentration.These data demonstrate that endothelial dysfunction is present in patients with SAP and the degree of endothelial damage may be correlated with the disease severity. CBP therapy can not only improve the general conditions, as measured by the APACHE II score, but also effectively improve endothelial dysfunction.",

According to the standardized procedures, all of the sera were determined by both, indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) ANCA, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) MPO-ANCA, PR3-ANCA and BPI-ANCA. The patients were divided into two groups according to serum ANCA positivity (Group A) or negativity (Group B). Thirty-three ANCA-associated pauci-immune CGN patients were regarded as control group (Group C). Their clinicopathologic features were compared to reveal whether ANCA correlated with disease activity.There were 11 (47.8%) cases with positive serum ANCA in 23 anti-GBM glomerulonephritis patients. There were 4/11 MPO-ANCA (one with positive PR3-ANCA and C-ANCA, three with negative IIF-ANCA), 1/11 PR3-ANCA (with positive MPO-ANCA and C-ANCA), 3/11 P-ANCA (with negative ELISA-ANCA) and 5/11 C-ANCA (one with positive PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA, and the other four with negative ELISA-ANCA). No BPI-ANCA was detected. No different clinicopathologic features were found between Groups A and B. Both were different from Group C in age, sex ratio, frequence of anuria and ESRD, variety of crescents, glomerular sclerosis, vessel lesion and prognosis.Our data demonstrate that ANCA in Chinese patients with anti-GBM CGN is not rare. The major target antigen of ANCA is MPO. ANCA seems not to be correlated with disease activity.",

The control rods in pebble bed high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTR) were located in the hole of side graphite reflector. Its absorber was made up of annular B 4C, which had special depletion rules. The depletion characteristics in each absorber sub-zone and the changes of the control rod worth were analyzed, based on both the MCNP coupling another depletion module and the detailed modeling control rod absorber region. According to the analysis, the boron in inner region of absorber is depleted only a little, although most of boron in outer region of absorber is depleted, because of the strong space self-shielding effects in control rod absorber. Therefore, the worth of control rod in the HTR decreases just a little at the end of reactor life time.",

In the present work, the newly emerging TPE-FRET technique was extended to the determination of oligonucleotide. A new TPE molecule with favorable two-photon action cross section was synthesized [2-(2,5-bis(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)acetic acid, abbreviated as TP-COOH], with the tagged reactive carboxyl group allowing facile conjugation with streptavidin (SA). Employing the TP-COOH molecule as energy donor and black hole quencher 1 (BHQ-1) as acceptor, a TPE-FRET-based homogeneous competitive hybridization model was constructed via a biotin-streptavidin bridge. Through the hybridization between a biotinylated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and a BHQ-1-linked ssDNA, and the subsequent capture of the as-formed hybrid by TP-COOH labeled SA, the donor fluorescence was quenched due to the FRET between TP-COOH and BHQ-1. Upon the competition between a target ssDNA and the quencher-linked ssDNA toward the biotinylated oligonucleotide, the donor fluorescence was recovered in a target-dependent manner. Good linearity was obtained with the target oligonucleotide ranging from 0.08 to 1.52 microM. The method was applied to spiked serum and urine samples with satisfying recoveries obtained. The results of this work verified the applicability of TPE-FRET technique in hybridization assay and confirmed the advantages of TPE-FRET in complicated matrix.",

A total of 698 patients were studied, including 363 men (52.0%) and 335 women (48.0%). Most of the patients had hematuria (85.8%) and/or proteinuria (82.1%). During a median follow-up of 54.0 months, 32 patients (4.6%) progressed to ESRD. The 5- and 10-year cumulative renal survival rates from ESRD were 96.4% and 88.6%, respectively. Baseline urinary protein, renal insufficiency, glomerular sclerosis and tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis were independent predictors of renal outcomes. Both the time-average mean arterial pressure and proteinuria during follow-up also influenced the renal prognosis. The patients with a time-average proteinuria <0.4 g/day had the lowest rates of ESRD or a 50% decline in renal function. In conclusion, identifying of clinical and histological prognostic factors may permit the prediction of renal outcomes. The optimal goal of therapy for HSPN patients may be to lower proteinuria to <0.4 g/day and control hypertension to achieve an ideal renal outcome.",

        "abstract": "Our previous work demonstrated a protective role of protein S in early diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Protein S exerts antiinflammatory and antiapoptotic effects through the activation of TYRO3, AXL, and MER (TAM) receptors. Among the 3 TAM receptors, we showed that the biological effects of protein S were mediated largely by TYRO3 in diabetic kidneys. Our data now show that TYRO3 mRNA expression is highly enriched in human glomeruli and that TYRO3 protein is expressed in podocytes. Interestingly, glomerular TYRO3 mRNA expression increased in mild DKD but was suppressed in progressive DKD, as well as in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Functionally, morpholino-mediated knockdown of tyro3 altered glomerular filtration barrier development in zebrafish larvae, and genetic ablation of Tyro3 in murine models of DKD and Adriamycin-induced nephropathy (ADRN) worsened albuminuria and glomerular injury. Conversely, the induction of TYRO3 overexpression specifically in podocytes significantly attenuated albuminuria and kidney injury in mice with DKD, ADRN, and HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Mechanistically, TYRO3 expression was suppressed by activation of TNF-α/NF-κB pathway, which may contribute to decreased TYRO3 expression in progressive DKD and FSGS, and TYRO3 signaling conferred antiapoptotic effects through the activation of AKT in podocytes. In conclusion, TYRO3 plays a critical role in maintaining normal podocyte function and may be a potential new drug target to treat glomerular diseases.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Rhein and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) have been reported to prevent the progression of diabeic nephropathy (DN). We futher explore the unknown ability to induce renal-protection of rhein and ACEI combined therapy in DN compared with the therapeutic effects of single treatment of them by using db/db mouse of type 2 diabetes model. Methods: db/db and db/m mice, 8 weeks of age, were divided into five groups according to the following treatments: (A) db/m, given saline treatment; (B) db/db, given saline treatment; C db/db, given rhein treatment (150 mg/kg/day); (D) db/db, given benazepril treatment (10 mg/kg/day); (E) db/db, given rhein (150 mg/kg/day) with benazepril (10 mg/kg/day). Body weight, plasma glucose, plasma lipid and 24h urinary albumin excretion levels were measured every 4 weeks. Morphometry of renal tissue and immunohistology of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β) and fibronectin were determined for all groups at the end of the treatment. Results: It was found that after treatment urinary albumin excretion was reduced after 4 weeks treatment in group E and after 8 weeks treatment in groups C and D, when compared to group B (p < 0.05). Plasma creatinine levels dropped significantly for group E, compared with the diabetic control group by the end of the treatment period. Futhermore, after the treatment body weight, plasma glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein all decreased in groups C and E compared to group B (p < 0.05). Histological morphometric analysis revealed that the whole glomerular area and extracellular matrix area was significantly reduced in groups C, D and E compared to group B, at 20 weeks of age, an effect most pronounced in group E. Using immunohistochemistry, the expression of fibronectin and TGF-β1 in groups C, D and E was found to have decreased compared to group B, after 12 weeks treatment, again the effect being more pronounced in group E. Conclusions: There appeared to be a similar renal protective effect of rhein compared with benazepril in diabetic nephropathy. A combined therapy may offer a more beneficial complementary effect on kidney injury in db/db mice, as reflected by urinary albumin excretion, renal function and histological changes. Our findings suggest that a therapeutic approach that combines rhein with ACEI provides a more effective therapy for DN than does either agent alone. © J. A.

These core-shell (TiN-VN) fibers incorporated mesoporous structure into high electronic conducting transition nitride hybrids, which combined higher specific capacitance of VN and better rate capability of TiN. These hybrids exhibited higher specific capacitance (2 mV s(-1), 247.5 F g(-1)) and better rate capability (50 mV s(-1), 160.8 F g(-1)), which promise a good candidate for high-performance supercapacitors. It was also revealed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization that the minor capacitance fade originated from the surface oxidation of VN and TiN.",

        "abstract": "Graphene oxide nanoplatelets (GONPs) are presented as electrochemical active materials for VO2+/VO2+ and V2+/V3+ redox couples for a vanadium redox flow battery. The structures and electrochemical properties of GONPs treated at different temperatures were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The results indicate that GONPs treated at 50 °C (GONP-50) possess highly hydroxylated and carboxylated groups and exhibit an excellent electrocatalytic activity towards VO2+/VO2+ and V2+/V3+ redox couples, while the pristine graphite only shows a reversible electrocatalytic activity towards VO2+/VO2+, suggesting that the V2+/V3+ redox reaction more strongly depends on the oxygen-containing groups attached on graphite surface than does the VO2+/VO2+. With the increase of treatment temperature, the polarization is reduced significantly. GONPs treated at 120 °C (GNOP-120) exhibit a lower electrochemical polarization than that of GONP-50 because of relatively higher electrical conductivity despite moderate electrocatalytic activity. The diffusion of VO2+ is faster on the surface of GONP-50 than on the pristine graphite and GNOP-120. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Tacrolimus (TAC) combined with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been suggested to play a critical role in the reversal of C4d-positive acute humoral rejection (AHR) in renal transplantation, but the efficacy of using only TAC-MMF without immunoadsorption or plasmapheresis has not been investigated. On the other hand, Chinese recipients of renal grafts usually need lower doses of immunosuppressants, and their optimal treatment for acute humoral rejection has not been established.Since 1999, we have used TAC-MMF to treat steroid-resistant acute rejection (AR). C4d staining was retrospectively performed in 32 patients with steroid-resistant AR, and the treatments of 19 patients with C4d-positive steroid-resistant AR were investigated.Thirteen of 19 patients received TAC-MMF treatment only; 11 episodes of rejection in them were reversed (7 completely, 4 partially) and only 2 recipients lost their graft. Another 6 patients received immunoadsorption also. One of them failed to respond and lost her graft. Four of 5 patients treated with immunoadsorption and TAC-MMF recovered (3 completely, 1 partially), but 3 of them had severe pneumonia, a complication rate statistically higher than in patients treated with only TAC-MMF (P<0.05). AR occurring during the first two weeks after transplantation had a statistically better outcome than that occurring later (P = 0.003).Our study suggests that the combination of TAC and MMF is a potentially safe and economic treatment for most Chinese renal allograft recipients with C4d-positive steroid-resistant AR, especially for rejections developing within the first two weeks after transplantation.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Insulin resistance and elevated serum level of insulin and amylin are the clinical features of type 2 diabetic patients. Mesangial expansion and deposition are the characteristic pathologic lesion found in the biopsy slides of type 2 diabetic patients with overt proteinuria. In the present study,we tried to delineate amylin deposition and distribution in type 2 diabetic patients with clinical diabetic nephropathy (DN) and tried to identify the influencing factors for renal amylin deposition. Methodology:Renal biopsy slides of 149 type 2 DN patients were retrospectively analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining of PAP four-layer technique was performed using monoclonal anti-amylin antibody and renal apoE were determined by indirect immunohistochemical staining. Blood amylin level was measured by competitive enzyme immunoassay. Comparison were made between these diabetic patients and patients with AL amyloidosis,obesity related nephropathy,light-chain deposition disease and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. Results:Seventy-two (48.3%) of patients have positive staining of amylin in the renal tissue. Amylin was found mainly in the expanded mesangial area,segmental sclerosis,K-W nodules,the Bowman's capsule as well as in blood vessel. Electronic microscopy showed that fibrils found in mesangial area be straight,long,randomly arranged and non-branching,with a diameter of (10.30±1.77)nm. Patients with positive amylin staining showed diffuse mesangial proliferation,with higher frequencies of glomerular nodular lesion and sclerotic lesion,and more severe renal tubular-interstitial lesion than patients with negative amylin staining (P<0.05). Consisted with the pathological comparison findings,patients with positive amylin staining showed more heavier proteinuria,higher serum creatinine levels,higher blood pressure,and severer renal tubular dysfunction and anemia. Plasma amylin level was markedly elevated in DN patients as compared with the healthy volunteers (P<0.05),but no significant difference was found between the patients with positive or negative amylin staining. Conclusion:Plasma amylin level is markedly elevated in patients with type 2 DN. And amylin deposition is found in mesangial area of those patients with advanced DN. Renal amylin deposition may not only aggravate the renal lesion,and also be correlated with the severity of clinical manifestations.",

        "abstract": "Melanin is one of the essential compounds in the pigments of molluscan shells. However, the effects of melanin on color variations in molluscs are largely unknown. Our previous study suggests that Yesso scallop Patinopecten yessoensis might contain melanin pigment in the dark brown shell. We therefore isolated melanin from the pigmented shells using hydrochloric acid method, and characterized the types of melanin pigments by spectrophotometry. The purified melanin, which was verified by spectrophotometry scanning and HPLC analysis, showed the typical characteristics of melanin absorption spectra and HPLC chromatograms. The contents of pheomelanin and eumelanin in pigmented shells, which were determined by the linear standard curve of melanin at 405 nm and 350 nm absorbance, were 48.23 ± 1.350 and 157.65 ± 5.905 mg, respectively. The present results indicate that the brown-pigmented shells of scallops comprise approximately 76.6% of eumelanin and 23.4% of pheomelanin, which supports the presence of eumelanin-rich pigment in scallop shells. Therefore, the combination of hydrochloric acid extraction and spectrophotometric quantification is a rapid and efficient method to isolate and quantify melanin in shells. This will facilitate the melanin studies related to shell color polymorphism and the selective breeding of bivalves with different shell colors.",

        "abstract": "Objective To identify the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in heart failure(HF) patients. Methods The data were collected by sleep monitoring and echocardiography in 223 eligible consecutive hospitalized HF patients prospectively between November 2003 and August 2005. Sleep apnea is the pathophysiologic condition of the abnormality of sleep-related respiratory control and upper airway opening during sleep. Apnea is defined as cessation of inspiratory airflow for ≥10 second, sleep apnea is defined as at least 10 apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep. OSA and hypopneas are resulted from complete or partial collapse of a narrowed pharynx, Obstructive apnea was defined as the absence of airflow in the presence of rib cage and abdominal excursions. Results Two hundred and twenty-three subjects were collected in eligible consecutive hospitalized HF patients prospectively. 160 of 223 HF patients (71.7%) had sleep apnea. 34.5 % (n = 77, 77/223) of the HF patients were OSA. The ascending aortic dimension in HF+OSA group (31.7 ± 4.2mm) were larger than in HF group (29.7 ± 3.7mm, P < 0.05) , and the left ventricular posterior wall thickness in HF+OSA group (9.32 ± 1.39mm) was increased compared with HF group (8.72 ± 1.44mm, P < 0.05). Age(OR=1.068) and history of hypertension(OR=3.761) were independent risk factors for OSA in HF patients after adjusting factors. Logistic regression analysis showed that habitual snoring was the significant clinical characteristic for OSA in HF patients (OR= 8.29). Conclusions HF patients with old age or history of hypertension were susceptible to OSA. Habitual snoring was the significant clinical characteristic. The echocardiographic characteristic of HF patients with OSA were enlarged ascending aortic dimension and increased left ventricular posterior wall thickness.",

        "abstract": "Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that HLA antibodies play an important role in early renal allograft injury. However, the effects of HLA antibodies on long-term graft survival are still poorly understood. In this study, we examined the impact of HLA antibodies on graft survival in long-term renal recipients with functional grafts for 10 years.In this retrospective study, long-term renal recipients were defined as kidney transplant recipients who had normally functioning renal grafts (serum creatinine level <2.0 mg/dl) for 10 years. Posttransplant serum samples from a total of 92 long-term renal allograft recipients on cyclosporine-based triple maintenance drug therapy (121.6 ± 0.886 months) were screened for the specificities of anti-HLA antibodies. The results of HLA antibodies before the transplantation, assessed using the same test method, were compared with those after their transplantations. Moreover, these 92 patients who received cadaveric renal transplant between January 2000 and December 2002 were followed up for about 10 years (range 107-135 months).27 patients had HLA-I antibodies and 16 patients had HLA-II antibodies before the transplantation, whereas 12 patients had HLA-I antibodies and 18 patients had HLA-II antibodies after the transplantation. Moreover, the types of HLA antibodies were different from those found before the transplantation. In these renal recipients with functioning renal grafts, the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 66.52 ± 14.52 ml/min/1.73 m(2) in the HLA antibody-positive group (n = 23) and 69.09 ± 25.54 ml/min/1.73 m(2) negative in the HLA antibody-negative group (n = 69, p > 0.05). Three patients (3.26%) (3 out of 92) had donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA). The frequency of DSA in this study was lower than that in the general Chinese Han renal recipient population.We find that all HLA antibodies in the long-term renal grafts are newly formed after the transplantation. The HLA antibody status has little impact on the renal graft function in the long-term renal recipients.",

        "abstract": "Objective:The correlation among the peritoneal dialysate volume(PDV) applied to peritoneal dialysis(PD) patients under different dialysis efficiencies,residual renal function(RRF) and body surface area(BSA) was retrospectively investigated,thus having summarized a method for calculating PDV in conformity with the physiological and disease characteristics of Chinese patients. Methodology:Measurement has been made for 1 650 times to 414 patients who have taken medium-position dialysis for 14.8 months(6-161 months) and been divided into three groups of adequacy,critical and inadequacy according to the 2006 NKF-K/DOQI standard.The changes of urea Kt/V,creatinine clearance rate(Ccr),protein expression rate(nPNA),plasma albumin(Alb),residual glomerular filtration rate(rGFR),PDV and PDV of unit BSA(PDV/BSA) of each group patients and the relationship among such factors have been studied. Results:With measurement for 1 650 times,the majority of patients have been dialyzed adequately,while only 391 cases have been dialyzed inadequately,covering 23.7%.As indicated by the analysis,there were significant differences(P<0.01 and P<0.01) in urine volume(UV) and rGFR,as well as in PDV and PDV/BSA for such three group.According to the research,it has also been observed that rGFR in the dequate dialysis cases was remarkably higher than that in other groups(P<0.01),while PDV/BSA there of was obviously less than that in other groups(P<0.01).As indicated by the observation of rGFR in different groups,PDV required for different RRF was significantly different(F=189.3,P<0.01).The correlation between rGFR and PV/BSA was further discussed,with correlation coefficient between them capable of being formulated as follows: PV/BSA=4 277.0-123.7×rGFR(r=-0.58,P<0.01).Therefore,the formula for calculating individual PDV of PD patients was got as follows: PDV(L/d)=(4.4-0.15×rGFR) ×BSA. Conclusion:PDV for all PD patients shoud be calculated according to RRF and BSA status.Such individual dialysis scheme is capable of not only exerting the advantages of RRF in PD to the maximum,but also saving dialysate dosage and reducing economic expenses of the patients.",

The variation of sedimentary rhythm, lithology and thickness of Cretaceous System and the variation of its contact with overlying and underlying strata from conformity to disconformity to conformity are mainly affected by the spatial and temporal variation of the intensity of activity of syn-tectonic fault-related folds and inverted structures. During the Cretaceous Period the deformation features of northern margin of Qaidam basin differed greatly from those basins in the East of China which indicated that structural evolution of the West of China and the East of China were controlled by different tectonic regimes, the NEE-SWW compression in northern margin of Qaidam basin during the Cretaceous Period were possibly related with the collision between the Gangdise landmass and the Eurasian continent in the Tethyan tectonic domain.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the effect and safety of modest tacrolimus(FK506) reduction by programming renal biospies.Methods A prospective,randomized,open study was designed and forty-eight recipients undergoing firstly cadaveric renal transplantation were divided randomly into two groups: low dose tacrolimus group(Lo-FK506 group,n=24) and standard dose tacrolimus group(St-FK506 group,n=24).The recipients in both groups were treated with triple immunosuppression regimen including mycophenolate mofetil(MMF),FK506 and adrenal cortex hormone.The FK506 blood trough concentration of St-FK506 group was maintained at 10-12 ng/ml in the first three months after study entry,and then at 8-10 ng/ml after three months.The FK506 blood trough concentration of Lo-FK506 group was maintained at 8-10 ng/ml in the first two months after study entry,3-7 ng/ml in third month,3-5 ng/ml after 3 months.All patients were followed up for one year.The FK506 blood trough concentration,renal function[serum creatinine(Scr),endogenous creatinine clearance rate(Ccr)],fasting blood glucose,glycosylated hemoglobin,seralbumin and blood fat were examined and recorded regularly.At the same time,acute rejection(AR) occurrence,pathological damage index score and chronic allograft damage index(CADI)of recipients were evaluated by using renal graft biopsy(FNA) at month 3 and 12 post-transplantation.The 1-year survival rate of patients /grafts and the incidence of adverse event were observed.Results One year follow-up post-transplantation,FK506 blood trough concentration in the Lo-FK506 group was lower compared with St-FK506 group(P<0.01),but most of the patients reached the target level.The level of Ccr in Lo-FK506 group was higher than that of St-FK506 group[(83±14) ml / min vs(62 ±16) ml/min,P<0.05].The level of glucose was lower in Lo-FK506 group than that of St-FK506 group(P<0.05).According to the results of programming renal biopsies,interstitial fibrosis,tubular atrophy and glomerulosclerosis score were also lower in Lo-FK506 group(all in P<0.05).The incidence,severity of AR as well as 1-year survival rates of patient /graft was similar in both groups(P>0.05).The incidence of pulmonary infection and de novo diabetes one year posttransplant was significantly lower in Lo-FK506 group compared with St-FK506 group(P<0.05 and P<0.01 respectively).Conclusion It is reliable and helpful to evaluate the efficacy of modest tacrolimus reduction by programming renal biopsies and to find the chronic pathological changes of transplanted grafts.Modest reduction of the FK506 blood trough concentration in the early stage after transplantation is good for kidney grafts and recipients without increasing the risk of rejection.",

All the LN patients followed-up in our lupus clinic center from 1986 to 2008 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Thirty-five patients with a disease onset beyond the age of 50 years were identified. One hundred systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients who had their disease onset before the age of 50 years were randomly recruited as controls. All of them received renal biopsy. The histological classifications were categorized according to 2003 International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) classification. All of patients were Han Chinese. The mean age of onset of SLE for late onset and the control groups were 55.7 ± 6.5 years (range: 50-76) and 28.9 ± 7.6 years (range:18-48).The female to male ratio was smaller in the late onset SLE group, 2.9-1, compared with 7.3-1 in the control. The patients with hypertension in late onset LN were much more than that in control group. The renal histological classes showed no significant difference between the two groups. Classes IV, V, IV + V were common in late onset LN patients. There were no significant differences in extra renal manifestations except for a lower prevalence of malar rash, a higher leukopenia and skin vasculitis in the late onset patients. As to the immunological features, serum antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and SSA positivity were more common in late onset LN patients. The patients with hypertension in late onset LN were much more than that in control group. The renal histological classes showed no significant difference between the two groups. Leukopenia and serum ANCA were more common. The results suggest a more severity of the disease in late onset LN.",

A dual matrix array (DMA) probe was designed using CIVA software on the basis of the actual structural characteristics of vacuum vessel welds. The key parameters of the probe were demonstrated, and the sound field was simulated. The verification results of the test blocks showed that the designed DMA probe had the advantages of small size and high signal-to-noise ratio during the inspection process.

        "abstract": "Hierarchical micro/nano-structured TiN spheres (micro/nano-TiNs) counter electrodes are fabricated by coating hierarchical micro/nano-TiO 2 paste onto Ti foil followed by a nitridation reaction. Compared with particulate TiN and TiN flat electrodes, the as-prepared hierarchical micro/nano-TiNs electrode based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) delivers significantly improved photovoltaic performances due to the presence of the hierarchical structure. In particular, V OC is enhanced by about 60 mV, which may be predominantly attributed to the gaining of favourable interfacial active sites and the traces of N-doped carbon residues. After an initial optimization of the particle sizes of the hierarchical micro/nano-TiNs, the reflectance effect of large submicroscale particles is attempted to improve the I SC. The highest overall conversion efficiency yields 7.83%, which is 30% higher than that of Pt/FTO (6.04%). This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.",

Methods Ten patients with Takayasu’s arteritis, aged 17～48(36.2±9.1)years old, had significant pulmonary stenosis and moderate and serious pulmonary hypertension. In them, 5 patients accompanied with the involvement of the aorta and its branches, while the others only isolated pulmonary stenosis. The follow-up results of ultrasonic cardiogram, arterial blood gas analysis and imaging examination were assessed. Results Percutaneous intervention procedure was successfully performed in 13 lesions of ten patients. Of these lesions, 9 lesions were treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty while the others were underwent percutaneous self-explandable stent placement. There were all extremely significant differences in the decrease of the stenosis , the broaden of diameter and decrease of pulmonary systolic pressure and mean pressure after operation(P <0.001). 2 patients suffered from hemoptysis during perioperation period and recovered completely after active treatments. In a follow-up of 5～34(20.4±10.3)months , the pulmonary artery systolic pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure were reduced from (92.4±17.2)mmHg to (62.7±14.5)mmHg, from (45.4±9.2)mmHg to (27.1±8.3)mmHg respectively, while arterial oxygen saturation was increased from (92.3±3.7)% to (96.8±1.7)%(P value for all <0.001). Conclusions Percutaneous intervention for pulmonary stenosis duo to Takayasu’s arteritis was safe and effective .",

As WSNs is usually in hostile environments, secure code dissemination has been a major concern. Most code dissemination protocols are Deluge-based which have to take much energy and memory to deal with the problem caused by out-of-order-delivery of packets in WSNs. Rate less erasure codes based approaches can reduce the overhead. However, none of them can defeat DoS attacks. This paper proposes a novel code dissemination scheme, which integrates immediately authentication into Fountain codes. The analysis shows that propose scheme can provide code image confidentiality, bogus code image protection, DoS protection and out-of-order-delivery-tolerant property.",

Different from previous works, we consider a scenario where the eavesdroppers can be located anywhere inside the communication region of the source, no location information of the eavesdroppers is available and no constraint on the number of eavesdroppers is presupposed. The basic idea is to transmit the message in multiple rounds and exploit the helpful interference from the source and the destination to jam the eavesdroppers in close proximity. Stochastic geometry based analytic results as well as Monte Carlo simulations are presented to illustrate the achievable secrecy performances.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the application of ultrathin cryo-immunogold electron microscopy methods in renal biopsy. Methodology: Tissue blocks of renal biopsy were fixed in fixation solution,and further sucrose cryoprotected. Ultrathin cryosections were cut with the application of improved technology of Tokuyasu. The grids were immunolabelled using IgA,κ,λ,C3 aR,podocine,and nephrin. Combined with immunofluorescence markers,immunoelectron microscopy for routine Epon812 and LR White embedding immunoelectron microscopy at low temperature as a reference,ultrathin cryosections were observed and the affects of those methods on the ultrastructure of renal biopsy,antigen preservation and immunolabelling were compared. Results: The ultrathin cryosections of renal tissue well preserved,fine structure. The intracellular structure was also clear while intracellular antigens preservation was good. However,the intracellular matrix,stored glycogen was not ideal. IgA、κ、λ immune markers of gold particles density was high,distribution specificity and high sensitivity. The antigens of C3 aR,podocine and nephrin,which might be difficult to detected by Epon812 routine immune electron microscopy and LR White Resin embedding immunoelectron microscopy,were well marked,and the immune markers of gold particle showed high density and distribution of specific and sensitive. Conclusion: The immunogold labeling of renal biopsy ultrathin cryosections was specific and high sensitive. This technique was a more satisfactory method at the ultrastructure level of renal morphological changes.",

        "abstract": "Renal involvement is found in about 70% of patients with systemic immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. However, there is no risk stratification system specialized for renal AL concerning patients' survival. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) has been reported to portend poor prognosis in other renal diseases. We measured Gal-3 and several traditional risk biomarkers of AL in baseline samples from 253 consecutive patients diagnosed with renal AL. At baseline, Gal-3 [Hazard ratio (HR): 1·46; P = 0·033], high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) (HR: 2·65; P < 0·001) and difference between involved and uninvolved free light chains (dFLC) (HR: 1·81; P = 0·001) were independent predictors of all-cause mortality. The cut-off points for Gal-3, hs-cTnT, and dFLC were 20·24 ng/ml, 0·026 ng/ml, and 75·89 mg/l, respectively. Patients were stratified into four stages by assigning a score of 1 for each of the three biomarkers above the cut-off point. The proportions of patients with disease stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 were 17·0%, 37·2%, 29·2% and 16·6%, and the median overall survival times from diagnosis were 100, 60, 29 and 15 months, respectively (P < 0·01). Higher level of Gal-3 is associated with increased risk for mortality, and the risk stratification based on Gal-3 is a reliable model for predicting mortality in AL amyloidosis with renal involvement.",

        "abstract": "Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is characterized as the incomplete resolution of emboli after pulmonary embolism (PE) and the subsequent fibrotic organization and remodeling of pulmonary vascular bed. It has been reported that abnormal fibrin probably contributes to the incomplete resolution of emboli. And there is evidence that free iron could convert fibrinogen into fibrin which is remarkably resistant to lysis. Thus, we hypothesized that persistent iron overload might participate in the development of CTEPH.A case-control study was conducted. Forty-five CTEPH patients were enrolled as cases, and 36 age and sex frequency-matched chronic PE patients without pulmonary hypertension were selected as controls. Levels of free iron, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), ferritin, sTfR/ferritin ratio, hepcidin-25, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, and malondialdehyde (MDA) were compared between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to estimate odds ratios.There was no difference of the levels of free iron, hepcidin-25, sTfR, ferritin, sTfR/ferritin ratio, TNF-α, and MDA between CTEPH patients and the controls. Levels of sTfR and ferritin in both groups were within the normal limits. Levels of IL-6 in CTEPH patients were significantly higher than that in the controls. A negative correlation was observed between hepcidin-25 and sTfR (Spearman's r=-0.438, P<.001), and a positive correlation was observed between hepcidin-25 and ferritin (Spearman's r=0.503, P<.001). In the univariate logistic regression model, there was no association observed between CTEPH and free iron, hepcidin-25, sTfR, ferritin, sTfR/ferritin ratio, TNF-α, IL-6, and MDA.CTEPH has no association with iron overload. The iron status evaluated by sTfR and ferritin is within the normal limits in this CTEPH population.",

Eight cases of recurrent proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits after a renal transplant have been reported. Almost all of these patients had a certain remission of proteinuria by steroids alone or with cyclophosphamide, and had further remission through other special treatments (ie, rituximab and plasmapheresis). We present a case of recurrent proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits of the IgG3Kappa subtype after a renal transplant, which was insensitive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide remitted by double filtration plasmapheresis. This case report reveals that recurrent proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits may be insensitive to intravenous pulse therapy of methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide. We advocate double filtration plasmapheresis as an effective treatment of proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits on remission of proteinuria.",

A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was modified with a film of such GSs which, due to the good electrical conductivity of graphene and the electrocatalytic properties of Na(CuTCPP), is capable of simultaneous determination of acetaminophen (AC) and dopamine (DA). The peak currents, best measured at voltage of 0.2 V (for DA) and 0.4 V (for AC; both vs. SCE), increase linearly in the 0.0024-3.6 μM and 0.004-7.6 μM concentration ranges, respectively. The detection limits are 0.8 nM for DA and 0.7 nM for AC. The sensor was successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of AC and DA in pharmaceutical preparations and spiked human serum. The results were in good agreement with those obtained for the same samples by HPLC. Graphical abstract Graphene nanosheets were prepared via a facile liquid-phase exfoliation of graphite with the assistance of copper(II) meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin tetrasodium salt.

Recent researches demonstrated that the expression profiles of miRNA showed tissue-specific expression patterns in the epidermis and hair follicles and stage-specific in cyclical development of hair follicles. Furthermore, a large number of miRNAs are involved in the development of epidermis and hair follicles, pigmentation, and the cyclical development of hair follicles. miRNAs in different cell types formed a comprehensive, multi-level network system through interaction with signal pathway and regulation factors. This review summarizes the available progress on how miRNAs are involved in the control of epidermal homeostasis and hair follicle development to enrich the research of gene regulatory networks and contribute to disease treatment and molecular breeding.",

Temperature dependent DC and RF characteristics are measured from 25 °C to 200 °C. The maximum drain current ( I   d−max  ) decreases from 1247 mA/mm to 927 mA/mm as the temperature increases from 25 °C to 200 °C. For maximum  f   T  ,  it  drops to 87 GHz and 64 GHz at 100°C and 200°C respectively. These results show that although both DC and RF performances decrease with the increase in temperature, the device still exhibits high mm-wave performance at high temperatures. Thus, InAlN/GaN based HEMTs are very promising for high temperature mm-wave applications.",

We report 10 Chinese patients with fibronectin glomerulopathy.Renal biopsies were performed on all patients, and the clinical and pathological parameters for all patients were analyzed.There were 6 males and 4 females, with an average age of 29 ±8 years. One patient had a family history of renal disease, all patients presented with proteinuria, and 80% of them suffered nephrotic range proteinuria. No patient demonstrated gross hematuria. The levels of serum creatinine were elevated, and the eGFR was decreased in 5 patients. Renal biopsy revealed a lobulated glomerular tuft. Patients showed numerous periodic acid-Schiff-positive and fuchsinophilic deposits in the mesangial area and along the capillary loops. Immense levels of fibronectin were detected in the glomerulus after immunofluorescence analysis. An electron microscopy scan found numerous electron-dense deposits in the mesangial and subendothelial areas. Immune-electron microscopy confirmed that the deposits consisted of fibronectin.Nephrotic proteinuria and massive intraglomerular fibronectin deposits are the most significant features of fibronectin glomerulopathy. *Huiping Chen and Hao Bao have contributed equally to the work and are to be considered first authors.",

        "abstract": "Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a widely used aerosol optical parameter in atmospheric physics. To obtain this parameter precisely, many institutions plan to launch satellites with multi-angle measurement sensors, but one important step in aerosol retrieval, the estimation of surface reflectance, is still a pressing issue. This paper presents an AOD retrieval method based on the multi-angle intensity data from the Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Science coupled with Observations from a Lidar (PARASOL) platform using empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), which can be universally applied to multi-angle observations. The function of EOFs in this study is to estimate surface intensity contributions, associated with aerosol lookup tables (LUTs), so that the retrieval of AOD can be implemented. A comparison of the retrieved AODs for the Beijing, Xianghe, Taihu, and Hongkong_PolyU sites with those from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground-based observations produced high correlation coefficients (r) of 0.892, 0.915, 0.831, and 0.897, respectively, while the corresponding root mean square errors (RMSEs) are 0.095, 0.093, 0.099, and 0.076, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The zebrafish pronephros is a valuable model for studying kidney development and diseases. Ultrastructural studies have revealed that zebrafish and mammals share similarities in nephron structures such as podocytes, slit diaphragms, glomerular basement membrane, and endothelium. However, the basic ultrastructural features of the pronephric glomerulus during glomerulogenesis have not been characterized. To understand these features, it is instructive to consider the developmental process of the pronephros glomerulus. Here, we describe the ultrastructural features of pronephric glomerulus in detail from 24 h hours post-fertilization (hpf) to 144 hpf, the period during which the pronephric glomerulus develops from initiation to its mature morphology. The pronephric glomerulus underwent progressive morphogenesis from 24 to 72 hpf, and presumptive glomerular cells were observed ventral to the aorta region at 24 hpf. The nascent glomerular basement membrane and initial lumen were formed at 36 hpf. A lumen was clearly visible in the region of the pronephros at 48 hpf. At 60 hpf, the pronephric glomerulus contained more patches of capillaries. After these transformations, the complex capillary vessel networks had formed inside the glomerulus, which was surrounded by podocyte bodies with elaborate foot processes as well as well-formed glomerular basement membrane by 72 hpf. The number of renal glomerular cells rapidly increased, and the glomerulus presented its delicate structural features by 96 hpf. Morphogenesis was completed at 120 hpf with the final formation of the pronephric glomerulus. J. Morphol. 277:1104-1112, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Differentiating BK virus nephropathy (BKVN) from acute rejection (AR) is crucial in clinical practice, as both of them have interstitial inflammation in the grafts. The purpose of the study is to describe the inflammatory cellular constituents of BKVN and to determine the clinical utility of immunophenotyping findings in distinguishing BKVN from AR. In addition, the expression of the HLA-DR was investigated. Sixty-five renal allograft recipients were included in this study, including 22 cases of BKVN, 31 cases of AR, and 12 cases of stable allograft. Immunostaining for infiltrating lymphocytes showed that the number of CD20 cells (P < 0.001) and the percentages of CD3 (P < 0.001), CD4 (P = 0.004), CD8 (P = 0.005), and CD20 (P = 0.002) cells were all significantly different between BKVN and AR. Moreover, there were no statistically significant differences in tubule cell HLA-DR expression (P = 0.156). This observation suggests that the number of CD20 cells and the percentages of CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD20 cells in renal biopsies would aid the distinction between BKVN and AR. On the other hand, the presence of HLA-DR upregulation may not only be specific for acute rejection but also be a response to BKVN.",

Hybrid capture 2 (hc2) and gene chip technology were performed to examine the high risk type human papillomavirus in the exfoliated cervical cells. Liquid-based cytology test (LCT) was also performed at the same time. The HPV-positive women with LCT > or = atypical squamous cells of undetermined sign (ASCUS) and the HPV-negative women with LCT > or = low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) underwent biopsy under colposcopy. The pathological results were used as the gold standard to evaluate the two HPV test methods.Totally 122 biopsy specimens were obtained. Pathological examination showed no cervical cancer case, 3 cases of grade III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), 11 cases of grade II CIN, 36 cases of grade I CIN, 69 cases of chronic cervicitis and metaplasia of squamous epithelium, and 3 cases of normal cervix. The HPV-positive rate was 14.0% by hc2 and 9.8% by gene chips with a HPV-positive rate by hc2 higher than that by gene chips (P < 0.001) and an mediocre accordance rate between these methods (kappa = 0.498). The. HPV-positive rate increased along with the increase of the grade of cervical lesions (P < 0.05). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive prevalue, negative prevalue, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio of hc2 for high-risk HPV were 100%, 87.1%, 87.3%, 8.8%, 100%, 7.7 and 0.000, respectively; and those of gene chips were 78.6%, 91.1%, 90.9%, 9.9%, 99.7%, 8.8 and 0.235 respectively.At present hc2 high risk HPV testing is still the better method for cervical cancer screening. Gene chips technology is able to rival hc2 except that its sensitivity for cervical high grade lesions need be improved.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most important microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We studied the expression characteristics of angiopoietin-like 2 (ANGPTL2), a novel DN-associated growth factor identified in our previous gene chip screening.Glomeruli were microdissected from renal biopsies from 24 patients with DN and 8 donor controls. The expression of ANGPTL2 was assessed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, and then correlated with clinical and pathological indices of glomerular injury.Consistent with the results of the gene chip experiment, abundant expression of ANGPTL2 was found more frequently in diabetic glomeruli as compared to donor controls (95 vs. 38%, chi(2) = 15.9, p < 0.01). ANGPTL2 mRNA upregulation was more prominent in glomeruli with less microaneurysm (22 vs. 66%, p < 0.05), inflammatory influx (6 vs. 50%, p < 0.05) or endothelial foam cell formation (11 vs. 53%, p < 0.05). Immunostaining revealed an upregulation of ANGPTL2 protein in hypertrophied diabetic glomeruli, mainly distributed in podocytes, which were supposed to be the origin of ANGPTL2.The upregulation of ANGPTL2 in diabetic glomerulopathy shows a close relationship to abnormal microvasculature and endothelial inflammation. ANGPTL2 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic glomerulopathy.",

        "abstract": "The sensitive and label-free detection of multiple biomarkers on a single electrode by photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensors based on light addressing strategies is very attractive for developing portable and high-throughput biosensing systems. The essential prerequisite of this proposal is the employment of uniform photovoltaic material modified electrodes with high conversion efficiency. Herein, a novel two-step constant potential deposition method for the rapid fabrication of bismuth sulfide film modified ITO electrodes (BiS/ITO) was established. The produced BiS/ITO, with excellent uniformity and high conversion efficiency in visible light ranges, was further modified with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and then divided into separated identical sensing zones by insulative paints. The adsorption-based immobilization of antibodies of three tumor markers, i.e., a-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), onto different sensing zones of the electrode and the further blocking with BSA established a label-free and light-addressable PEC sensor (LF-LAPECS), which can achieve the rapid and sensitive detection of these biomarkers with wide linear ranges, low detection limits and self-calibration ability. Moreover, the detection throughput can be conveniently improved by enlarging the size of the substrate electrode and increasing the number of separated sensing zones. The present work thus demonstrates the promising applications of PEC techniques for developing sensitive, time-saving, cost-effective and high-throughput biosensing methods.",

        "abstract": "Rhein is an anthraquinone compound isolated from the medicinal plant rhubarb and mainly used in the clinical treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Rhein exhibits various renoprotective functions, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully determined. However, its renoprotective properties recapitulate the role of Klotho, a renal-specific antiaging protein critical for maintaining kidney homeostasis. Here we explored the connections between rhein renoprotection and Klotho in a mouse model of adenine-induced chronic kidney disease. In addition to being an impressive Klotho upregulator, rhein remarkably reversed renal Klotho deficiency in adenine-treated mice. This effect was associated with significant improvement in disturbed serum biochemistry, profibrogenic protein expression, and kidney and bone damage. Further investigation of the molecular basis of Klotho loss revealed that these kidneys displayed marked inductions of DNA methyltransferase DNMT1/DNMT3a and Klotho promoter hypermethylation, whereas rhein treatment effectively corrected these alterations. The renal protective effects of rhein were largely abolished when Klotho was knocked-down by RNA interferences, suggesting that rhein reversal of Klotho deficiency is essential for its renoprotective actions. Thus, our study clarifies how rhein regulation of Klotho expression contributes to its renoprotection and brings new insights into Klotho-targeted strategy for the treatment of kidney diseases of various etiologies.",

        "abstract": "In the present work, a two-photon excited fluorescent chemosensor for Cu(2+) was prepared. The probe was constructed on the basis of internal charge transfer (ICT) principle with macrocyclic dioxotetraamine as the Cu(2+) receptor. The good water-solubility of the molecule enabled recognition and assay of Cu(2+) ions in biological media. The photophysical properties of the chemosensor were investigated in detail, exhibiting favorable fluorescence quantum yield and moderate two-photon absorption cross-section. The studies on binding thermodynamics demonstrated the formation of 1 : 1 complex between the chemosensor and Cu(2+) and an association constant of ca. 1.04 × 10(5) M(-1). Due to the rational design of the molecular structure, the sensor was highly specific to Cu(2+), which ensured high selectivity in Cu(2+) determination. Upon Cu(2+) binding, the intramolecular charge-transfer extent within the chromophore was weakened resulting in a remarkable quenching of fluorescence, based on which quantitative determination of Cu(2+) was performed. Good linearity was obtained between the fluorescence quenching value and Cu(2+) concentration ranging from 0.04 to 2.0 μM in aqueous solution. Benefiting from the merits of two-photon excitation, the chemosensor was free of interference from background luminescence in serum. A homogeneous quantitative determination of Cu(2+) was achieved in the serum medium with a linear range of 0.04 to 2.0 μM. Considering the structural flexibility of the sensor, this work also opens up the possibility to construct other two-photon excited chemosensors for direct homogeneous assay of various molecules/ions in complicated biological sample matrices.",

        "abstract": "Partitioning skew has been shown to be a major issue that can significantly prolong the execution time of MapReduce jobs. Most of the existing off-line heuristics for partitioning skew mitigation are inefficient; they have to wait for the completion of all the map tasks. Some solutions can tackle this problem on-line, but will impose an additional overhead by repartitioning the workload of overloaded tasks. In this paper, we present OPTIMA, an on-line partitioning skew mitigation technique for MapReduce. OPTIMA predicts the workload distribution of reduce tasks at run-time, leverages the deviation detection technique to identify the overloaded tasks and pro-actively adjusts resource allocation for these tasks to reduce their execution time. We provide the upper bound of OPTIMA in time complexity, while allowing OPTIMA to perform totally on-line. Through experiments using both real and synthetic workloads running on an 11-node Hadoop cluster, we have observed OPTIMA can effectively mitigate the partitioning skew and improved the job completion time by up to 36.73 % in our experiments.",

Methods: Thirty-eight recipients of first allograft kidney transplantation received Pred+CsA or FK506+MZR while the other 31 Pred+CsA or FK506 + MMF.Comparisons were made between the two groups in the patient/kidney survival rate,SCr,incidence of acute rejection,drug toxicity/side effects(leucopenia,GPT above normal,hyperuricemia and gastrointestinal symptom) and pulmonary infection.Results: No significant differences were observed in the patient/kidney survival rate,acute rejection incidence and SCr between the two groups 1,2 and 3 months after the transplantation.Compared with the MMF group,SCr was significantly increased at 6 and 12 months(P<0.05),while the incidences of gastrointestinal symptoms and pulmonary infection markedly decreased in the MZR group(P<0.05).No statistic differences were shown in the incidences of leucopenia,GPT above normal and hyperuricemia between the two groups. Conclusion: MZR,with its high safety and low toxicity/side effects,can be used as a maintenance immunosuppressant after allograft kidney transplantation.",

All patients underwent CPX to evaluate exercise capacity.Patients with right heart failure had significantly lower peak oxygen uptake (VO2), peak VO2/kg ratio, peak oxygen uptake/heart rate (VO2/HR) ratio and increases in oxygen uptake/increase in work rate (ΔVO2/ΔWR) slope, and had higher minute ventilation/CO2 production ratio and peak dead space volume/tidal volume during exercise. In patients with left heart failure, peak VO2/HR ratio was positively correlated with ΔVO2/ΔWR slope. However, VO2 and VO2/HR ratio were positively correlated with ΔVO2/ΔWR slope in patients with right heart failure.Compared with left heart failure, patients with right heart failure showed worse exercise capacity resulting from worse pulmonary and cardiovascular adaptation to exercise.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the predictive power of the pathologic classification in type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM).Methodology: Four hundred and fourteen T2DM patients who had biopsy-confirmed DN and followed for at least a year after biopsy from January 2003 to November 2011 at Jinling Hospital were enrolled in this retrospective study.The relevancies between pathological findings and renal outcome were assessed.All cases were categorized according to the pathologic classification of Tervaert having reported.Some common pathological changes of DN were also examined.A renal event was defined as eGFR < 15 ml /(min·1.73m2).Results: They were 260 male and 154 female with an average age of(50.0 ±9.10) years old.Among them,there were 63 in Class Ⅰ,95 Class Ⅱa,32 Class Ⅱb,168 Class Ⅲ,and 56 Class Ⅳ.The 5-year renal survival rates were 100%,90.2%,75.4%,39.0% and 15.3%,respectively.Cox regression showed that the glomerular classes,interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy(IFTA) and interstitial inflammation can significantly influence renal survival in these patients.Scores of arteriolar hyalinosis and arteriosclerosis were not significant variables.More than one area of arteriolar hyalinosis was commonly found in 95.4% of these patients,indicating that this index may not be suitable for classification.The patient with nodule lesions,glomerular microaneurysms,atubular glomeruli,segmental sclerosis,hyaline caps,fibrinoid exudation,foam cells within loops,glomerular inflammation,crescents,and segmental endothelial proliferation had a worse renal survival.Multivariate COX analysis showed that the glomerular classes,IFTA and acute tubular injury were independent risk factors for renal prognosis,even when adjusted for proteinuria,blood pressure and eGFR.Conclusion: The glomerular classification and IFTA are significantly associated with renal outcome in patients with T2DM,independently of proteinuria,blood pressure and eGFR.However,the vascular indexes in the classification are incapable to reflect the difference in vascular lesion severity of the patients and can't be used for renal prognosis,suggesting a necessity to redefine them.",

Integration processes, especially the introduced ions and electrons play an important role for the degradation of SBT capacitors. After insulator layer deposition and contact photo etching, a significant reduction in polarization was observed, and this reduction can be recovered well by recovery annealing in oxygen. The experimental result demonstrates that the integration processes can produce the ions, electrons and other defects, which has an obvious effect on the polarization of SBT capacitors.

        "abstract": "Objective:We explored the relevance of the markers with tubular interstitial lesion and glomerular function in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in order to find the specific and sensitive biomarkers. Methodology:Sixty patients with biopsy-proved idiopathic FSGS were recruited in this study. Thirty-six idiopathic menbranuous nephropathy (MN) and 30 minimal change diseases (MCD) were regarded as the control groups. The changes of urinary kideny injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), IL-18, neutrophil-gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), proteinuria, N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase (NAGase), retinal-binding protein (RBP), Cystatin C (CysC), C3, α2-MG and renal biochemistry were observed in each group and compared. The effects of urinary data, blood biochemistry as well as histological manifestations on the changes of KIM-1, IL-18, NGAL in FSGS patients were evaluated. Results:(1)Under the same proteinuria level, urinary KIM-1, IL-18, NGAL, NAG, RBP, C3,α2-MG were increased in patients with FSGS compared with MN and MCD (P<0.05).(2)In FSGS patients, urinary KIM-1 was increased along with serum CysC (P<0.05), and the patients with higher urinary NGAL showed proteinuria, BUN, urinary C3 and α2-MG increased (P<0.05), but serum total protein and albumin decreased (P<0.05).(3)FSGS patients with acute tubular interstitial injury showed KIM-1 and NGAL increased compared with that have only chronic tubular interstitial lesions (P<0.05).(4)In 21 patients with normal NAG and RBP, their urinary KIM-1, IL-18, NGAL was also increased, and the acute tubular interstitial lesions were found in histological examinations. Regard to diagnosis acute tubular and interstitial injury, the area under ROC curve of KIM-1, NGAL and NAG were greater than that of IL-18, RBP and CysC. Conclusion:Our study demonstrated the patients with FSGS had serious tubular interstitial damages compared with MN and MCD, and the reason was independent of the quantity of proteinuria. KIM-1, NGAL, NAG are more specific and sensitive novel biomakers than IL-18, RBP and CysC to estimate the acute tubular and interstitial function.",

        "title": "A novel method for determination of peroxynitrite based on hemoglobin catalyzed reaction",
        "abstract": "A novel spectrofluorimetric method for the determination of peroxynitrite is proposed. The method is based on a mimetic enzyme catalyzed reaction with hemoglobin as the catalyst and l -tyrosine as the substrate. A new fluorescent substance is produced that might probably be the coupled dimmer of tyrosine, which, instead of nitryl-tyrosine, is likely to be a new marking substance of ONOO − injury in vivo. Kinetics of the reaction is studied and the possible reaction mechanism is also recommended. The proposed method is simple and highly sensitive with a detection limit of 5.00 × 10 −8 mol L −1 of peroxynitrite. A liner calibration graph is obtained over the peroxynitrite concentration range 5.60 × 10 −7 to 2.10 × 10 −5 mol L −1 , with a correlation coefficient of 0.9983. Interferences from some amino acids and metal ions normally seen in biological samples, and also some anions structurally similar to ONOO − are studied. Keywords Peroxynitrite Enzymatic method Hemoglobin l -Tyrosine Kinetics 1 Introduction Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated as an important causative factor in cell damage, including apoptosis and necrosis. Their proposed actions comprise lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, the mitochondrial respiratory chain destruction and protein modifications [1–3] . Recent experiments have fastened on the importance of peroxynitrite, the reaction product of the two reactive species nitric oxide and superoxide [4] . Cells injury aroused by peroxynitrite is considered to contribute to the pathogenesis of a series of diseases, including inflammatory processes, ischemia-reperfusion, septic shock and neurodegenerative processes [5,6] . Evaluation of the potentially injuring mechanism of peroxynitrite has proved difficult due to its short life span, low concentration in vivo [7,8] . In recent years, various approaches have been tried to detect peroxynitrite [9–13] , such as fluorescent probes method (usually use dihydrodichloro-fluorescein (DCFH) and dihydrorhodamine-123 (DHR-123) as the probes), which is considered to be ideal and has been widely employed to monitor peroxynitrite in various biological systems [14,15] . Generally, the above methods are based on the oxidation of reduced, non-fluorescent forms of fluorescent dyes such as fluorescein and rhodamine by peroxynitrite to produce the parent dye molecule, resulting in a dramatic increase in fluorescence response. However, though these assays are commonly used, there are some controversy in the literatures concerning the mechanism of peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation of fluorescent indicators [16–18] , and the synthesis of these probe molecules is rather difficult and inconvenient [7] . Additionally, the use of organic dyes is very likely to result in environmental pollutants and usually should be avoided. Since peroxynitrite always originates and functions in vivo, it is significant to seek for some methods for the determination of peroxynitrite that fit to living biological system. On basis of our experiences in researching ROS utilizing enzymatic reactions [19–22] , we consider this kind of method might also be an interesting and qualified approach for peroxynitrite that meets the above demand. In the present tentative work, a peroxidase catalyzed redox reaction between peroxynitrite and another reducer is studied and applied in determination. Hemoglobin (Hb) is used as the mimetic enzyme for substituting horseradish peroxidase (HRP). There are two main reasons for doing so. Firstly, just like in our previous work, it is for the purpose of the mildness of reaction conditions and the minimization of cost. Hb is the respiring albumen in blood cells of the amniotes, due to the high similarity of its porphyrin (Fe) structure to that of HRP, Hb is capable of being used as a peroxidase substitute in many catalytic oxidation reactions. Its peroxidatic characteristics and enzymatic kinetics have been studied systematically in our laboratory during last few years [22–25] . Secondly and more weightily, since Hb is a kind of nature protein in human body it is much likely to coexist with peroxynitrite in cell or organism. Tyrosine is chosen as the reduced substrate in this work. As we all have known, based on the nitration of tyrosine with peroxynitrite, 3-nitro-tyrosine has normally been acted as the detecting target for the determination of peroxynitrite with spectrophotometry [26,27] . It is also considered as the marking substance of ONOO − injury in vivo. Whereas in this work, with Hb catalyzing, l -tyrosine is directly oxidized by peroxynitrite to produce a fluorescent product other than 3-nitro-tyrosine. Thus a new fluorometric method is built up for peroxynitrite determination. The kinetics and possible mechanism of the enzymatic reaction is also discussed. The other notable and important point of the work is that since all partners of the reaction system are seen in living organism and such reaction is very likely to occur in vivo, it is reasonably presumed that the enzymatic reaction may be another pathway in which the biologic macromolecules are injured by ONOO − and the fluorescent product, the molecular structure of which is still in further research, may be a new marking substance of ONOO − injury. And we believe the work might give a fillip to peroxidase-based researches on peroxynitrite in future. 2 Experimental 2.1 Reagents and apparatus l -Tyrosine (Tianyuan Biotechnological Co., Wuhan, China), a stock solution (1.00 × 10 −3 mol L −1 ) is prepared by dissolving 0.0090 g of l -tyrosine in 50.00 mL water (containing 1.00 mL 0.10 mol L −1 HCl); hemoglobin (Lizhu Reagent Co., Shanghai, China), a stock solution (1.00 × 10 −4 mol L −1 ) is prepared by dissolving 0.3400 g Hb in 50.00 mL water; Superoxide dismutase (SOD, 3000 U mL −1 ) is purchased from Sigma; A 0.10 mol L −1 dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution is prepared; 0.20 mol L −1 Tris–HCl buffer solutions with varying pH values are prepared. Distilled, de-ionized water is used throughout. All the solutions are stored in a refrigerator (4 °C). For fluorometric measurements, a Perkin-Elmer LS55 spectrofluorometer equipped with 1 cm quartz cell is used. The excitation and emission wavelength slits are respectively set at 15.0 and 5.0 nm. An UVIKON-941 (Kontron Inc.) spectrophotometer is used for absorbance measurements. Kinetic experiments are performed on an SX18MV-R stopped-flow analyzer (Applied Photophysics, UK). The experimental temperature, both for the quantitative determination and kinetic researches, is controlled with a Shimadzu TB-85 thermostat bath. For pH measurement, a TOA Electronics Model PHS-3C precision pH meter (Shanghai, China) is used. 2.2 Preparation of peroxynitrite standard solution The standard peroxynitrite is prepared according to methods reported previously [28] , to simply describe the procedure, 25.00 mL solution containing 1.00 g sodium nitrite of analytical reagent purity is added with 25.00 mL of distilled water containing 1.50 mL of 35% hydrogen peroxide and 0.40 mL of 96% sulphuric acid. The resulting mixture is promptly poured into 50 mL of aqueous solution containing 2.50 g sodium hydroxide. The excess H 2 O 2 is removed by 0.40 g MnO 2 . The product is diluted by 0.30 mol L −1 NaOH and filtrated to eliminate the excess MnO 2 and placed in a thermostat. The product is determined with UV–vis spectrophotometry ( λ max = 302.0 nm) and the concentration of peroxynitrite is found to be approximately 4.00–7.00 × 10 −4 mol L −1 . Aliquots of peroxynitrite are monitored spectrophotometrically to accurately determine the concentration before each experiment. 2.3 Preparation of NO donor standard solution About 50.00 mL of reduced GSH (2.00 × 10 −2 mol L −1 ) is prepared in citric acid buffer (1.00 × 10 −3 mol L −1 , pH = 2.00). About 50.00 mL of KNO 2 (2.00 × 10 −2 mol L −1 ) is prepared in NaCl solution (9.0%). The above two solutions are mixed and the pH is adjusted to 2.00. A yellow solution of NO donor is obtained and stored in a refrigerator (4 °C). The concentration of this NO donor solution is determined accurately with UV–vis spectrophotometry ( λ max = 338.0 nm). 2.4 Methods for determination of peroxynitrite In a set of 10 mL-colorimetric tubes, 0.20 mL of l -tyrosine (1.00 × 10 −3 mol L −1 ), 5.00 mL of Tris–HCl buffer solution (pH = 8.50), a series of different amount of ONOO − and 20.00 μL of hemoglobin (1.00 × 10 −4 mol L −1 ) are added in order, and then the reaction solution is diluted to the mark with the buffer solution. The reaction solution is kept at room temperature for 10 min. The fluorescence intensity of the solution is recorded at 410.0 nm with the excitation wavelength of 320.0 nm. 2.5 Detection of peroxynitrite in adriamycin-treated yeast cells When yeast culture enters the stationary phase, cells are harvested by centrifugation for 3 min at 5000 rpm and subsequently washed twice with 0.20 mol L −1 Tris–HCl (pH = 8.5). The same amounts of cells are suspended in the same volume of buffer in closed screw-cap cuvettes. A taken group with adriamycin (100 μg mL −1 ) added and a control group are prepared synchronously. Both groups are then incubated for 20 h with shaking at 28 °C. Cells are harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with 0.20 mol L −1 Tris–HCl (pH = 8.5), transferred to a glass homogenizer and homogenized completely on ice. The homogenate is centrifuged for 10 min at 12000 rpm under 4 °C. The suspension is taken for analysis. DMSO (0.10 mol L −1 ), a specific scavenger for OH and SOD (3 U mL −1 ), a specific scavenger for O 2 − , are introduced to the cell extraction to eliminate the possible interference of OH and O 2 − . Under the optimal experimental conditions, the samples including the taken group and control group are detected fluorimetrically. For standard additions and recovery experiments, yeast cells treated with various concentration of adriamycin are taken as samples. 2.6 Procedures for dynamic experiments Stopped-flow fluorescence analysis is performed to acquire kinetic parameters. One stream containing various amount of l -tyrosine, buffer and Hb is mixed with the other stream containing ONOO − and buffer in the flow cell with a 20 μL cubage. The slit width of excitation and emission wavelength are both set at 2.5 nm and the dead time is set to 1 ms. The fluorescence at 320.0/410.0 nm (excitation/emission) is recorded under a constant temperature within the initial 10 s after sampling, and the initial reaction rate (represented as dFI/d t ) under different concentrations of l -tyrosine are calculated from such kinetic curves (FI– t ). Further, an initial rate versus tyrosine concentration curve is plotted so that the Michaelis–Menten constant K m and V max are obtained. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Spectra characteristics of the system and possible structure of the product The substrate, l -tyrosine has its inherent fluorescence with the maximum excitation and emission wavelength located at 225.0 and 305.0 nm, respectively. After being oxidized by ONOO − with Hb catalyzing, the fluorescence of l -tyrosine decreased greatly or disappeared completely, meanwhile a new fluorescent substance appeared with the maximum emission wavelength located at 410.0 nm. The fluorescence spectra of both the substrate and the product are shown in Fig. 1 . It is seen the oxidization of the substrate is quite complete and the spectral signal of the product is fully free from interference from that of the substrate. The fluorescence of the product has two excitation peaks, which locates at 250.0 and 320.0 nm, respectively. Consider that strong violet light may probably result in the decomposing of the compounds in the reaction system, the relatively long wavelength, 320.0 nm is chosen as the excitation wavelength in the following experiments. In those works concerning ONOO − injury, it is well established that the tyrosine residue is nitrified to generate 3-nitro-tyrosine that has no intrinsic fluorescence but a maximum absorbance around 428.0 nm [29,30] , which is detected spectrophotometrically. Whereas in our experiments, the product is a strong fluorescent substance with no absorbance around 428.0 nm.Thus it is safely excluded the production of 3-nitro-tyrosine in this reaction. As has been proved in literatures, peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of substrates having similar molecular structure to that of tyrosine, i.e., p -cresol, would always yield polymers of the substrate [31,32] . And an early research reported that l -tyrosine was directly oxidized by H 2 O 2 with manganese-tetrasulfonatophthalocyanine catalyzing to produce coupled dimer [33] . In this work, the formation of the dimer of tyrosine is further verified with NO donors–inhibitors of dimer [34] . With introducing the standard solution of NO donor to the reaction mixture before peroxynitrite, the fluorescence signal disappears, which indicates that the NO donor restrains the formation of the dimeric product. 3.2 Kinetics and possible mechanism of the reaction With dynamic experimental approach, the kinetics of this catalytic reaction is studied. By recording the FI– t (relative fluorescence intensity versus time) curves under different concentrations of tyrosine, the relationship between the initial reaction rate (represented as dFI/d t ) and the substrate concentration is thus obtained, which is shown in Fig. 2 . It is discovered that the initial rate is proportional to the concentration of tyrosine at comparatively lower concentration level, which accords with the kinetic property of first-order reactions; with the concentration of tyrosine increasing, the reaction turns to be the so-called mixed order reaction. And finally, when the concentration of tyrosine becomes even higher, i.e., up to 4.90 × 10 −4 mol L −1 in this system, the initial rate does not increase any longer, in other words, the reaction has turned into a zero-order reaction due to the fact that Hb, the enzyme, has already been saturated by tyrosine, the substrate. All the experimental results are corresponding to the Michaelis–Menten's law, which describes enzyme-based kinetic behaviors, indicating the oxidation of tyrosine by peroxynitrite in the presence of Hb is a quite typical enzymatic reaction. According to Fig. 2 , the values of Michaelis–Menten constant K m and V max are acquired as 2.27 mmol L −1 and 3.34 ΔFI s −1 , respectively. Studies have shown that the oxidation of various substrates by peroxynitrite (ONOO − /ONOOH) can take place via different pathways [7] : (i) peroxynitrite can directly oxidize the substrates; (ii) peroxynitrite may decompose into highly reactive species ( OH , N O 2 ), which subsequently oxidizes the substrate or hydroxylates and nitrates aromatic compounds. In the present work, the possible pathway of the oxidation of tyrosine by peroxynitrite is studied. DMSO (0.10 mol L −1 ), a specific scavenger for OH , is introduced to the reaction mixture before the addition of peroxynitrite, and the signal of the system is found to be almost unchanged, indicating that OH does not contribute to the fluorescence increase of the system. Similarly, a specific scavenger for O 2 − , SOD (3 U mL −1 ), is added to the reaction system, and the fluorescence of the system also shows no changes compared with that in the absence of SOD, proving that O 2 − does not mediate the generation of the fluorescent product. The above results suggest that the oxidation of tyrosine must have raised from peroxynitrite itself, but not its decomposed reactive species. Combined the above results of kinetic studies with other reported opinions concerning the mechanism of the reaction between peroxynitrite and tyrosine [35–37] , the reaction pathway is proposed as follows. Firstly, hemoglobin is oxidized by peroxynitrite to form methemoglobin, which will promote the isomerization of peroxynitrite. Subsequently, in the presence of the carbonate radical anion – the product of peroxynitrite isomerization, tyrosyl radicals are generated. Meanwhile, methemoglobin is quickly back-reduced to Hb. Finally, the dimeric product is formed through the polymerization of tyrosyl radicals. 3.3 Optimization of determination conditions As is well known, in an acid circumstance, the majority of peroxynitrite will present as its conjugate acid, ONOOH, which is rather unstable and easy to decompose. Thus the determination is performed under alkaline conditions controlled with buffer solutions. Having studied several kinds of buffer solutions with similar pH range, i.e., Tris–HCl, NH 3 –NH 4 Cl, Na 2 HPO 4 –KH 2 PO 4 and so on. Tris–HCl is preferred due to the highest sensitivity. Then the pH dependence of the system is investigated over the range from pH 7.20 to 9.10 using Tris–HCl buffer solution, which is shown in Fig. 3 . It can be seen the detection signal (FI) of the system increases with the pH value up to 8.40, and there exists a platform on the curve within the pH range of 8.40–8.80. Hence the Tris–HCl buffer with pH 8.50 is chosen in the subsequent experiments. It is reported that peroxynitrite has a p K a value of 6.80, that is to say, in a slightly alkaline environment (pH 8.50), about 85% of peroxynitrite will present in the form of ONOO − [27] , indicating that it is mainly ONOO − who oxidized tyrosine to yield a highly fluorescent product in this system, which is consistent with the oxidizing nature of ONOO − . As has been pointed out above, the Hb catalyzed reaction between l -tyrosine and ONOO − is thoroughly different from that without Hb catalyzing. Like most works concerning enzymatic reactions, the concentration of the catalyst is always an important factor influencing the performance of the method and is essential to decide its appropriate amount. In our experiment, there is nearly no fluorescent product generated in the absence of Hb, and the fluorescence intensity increases with Hb concentration increasing till 2.00 × 10 −7 mol L −1 , as is shown in Fig. 4 . With Hb concentration higher than 2.00 × 10 −7 mol L −1 the fluorescence signal decrease instead, which is often seen in enzymatic reactions. Besides, the reproducibility of the signal becomes poor with even higher Hb. Considering the sensitivity as well as the reproducibility, 2.00 × 10 −7 mol L −1 of hemoglobin is recommended in the following determination. The concentration of substrate in enzymatic reactions is always a very important factor for the system. Too low concentration of substrate will unavoidably cause signal loss because of the incompleteness of reactions. Meanwhile, improperly high concentration of substrate will be extremely detrimental to the catalyst and also contribute to the blank. For the designed reaction completed and the signal fully obtained, less consumption of substrate is certainly better. The influence of l -tyrosine concentration on the fluorescence intensity of the system is also studied in this work. It is shown in Fig. 5 that the detection signal (FI) reaches to the maximum at about 2.00 × 10 −5 mol L −1 of l -tyrosine, which is then used during the following experiments. The temperature dependence of the reaction rate is one of the characteristics of enzymatic reactions and the experimental temperature is always precisely controlled. The reaction rate in the range of 4–50 °C was obtained, which is shown in Fig. 6 as a typical bell-mouthed curve. The optimal temperature of this Hb catalyzed reaction is located at 22 °C. 3.4 Analytical performances of the method The calibration curve for peroxynitrite obtained from the above mentioned determination procedure is linear ranging from 5.60 × 10 −7 to 2.10 × 10 −5 mol L −1 with a correlation coefficient 0.9983, which is shown in Fig. 7 . The detection limit, calculated according to the three S b / m criterion, in which ‘ m ’ is the slope of the range of the linearity used and ‘ S b ’ the standard deviation ( n = 9) of the blank solution, is found to be 5.00 × 10 −8 mol L −1 . The relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) at a 5.60 × 10 −6 mol L −1 peroxynitrite is 3.80% ( n = 7), and is 4.30% ( n = 8) at 8 × 10 −7 mol L −1 peroxynitrite, which shows a good reproducibility of this method. In order to demonstrate the accuracy of the new method, standard control experiments are carried out with spectrophotometry, the standard quantitative method for peroxynitrite based on its absorbance at 302.0 nm, as the comparison. A series of peroxynitrite solution with varying concentrations are parallel determined by both spectrophotometry and the proposed enzymatic fluorometric method. The results obtained from both methods, as shown in Table 1 , reveal a good correlation ( r = 0.998) and no statistical difference between the two means using a paired t -test. It is seen that the new method is comparatively precise. 3.5 Interference studies Interferences from some amino acids, metal ions normally seen in biological samples, as well as anions structurally similar to ONOO − are considered. At the same time, since a little amount of H 2 O 2 is possibly remained in the prepared ONOO − solution [28] , and it is also capable of oxidizing the substrate as a kind of ROS, it is obligatory to investigate the disturbance of H 2 O 2 on the system. With the ONOO − concentration fixed at 2.40 × 10 −6 mol L −1 , those foreign substances under study are added into the system with different concentrations. Their influences on the determination are presented as tolerance, which means the added intruder has lead to a change of the relative fluorescence intensity with less than 5%. Results in Table 2 show a fairly satisfactory selectivity of the method. Especially, the tolerance of H 2 O 2 is quite high, which may be explained in that the reactivity of peroxynitrite is 2000 times greater than H 2 O 2 [38] , it is prior to react with the reduced substrate. But the method allows rather low amount of Mn 2+ and Fe 3+ , which might have come from the disturbance of them on the catalytic center of Hb, the iron contained heme. 3.6 Analysis of biological samples It is well known that ONOO − is generated in adriamycin-induced cell injury. Results of fluorimetric detection of yeast cell samples are shown in Fig. 8 . It clearly exhibits the characteristic excitation and emission spectra in the taken group, i.e., the homogenate of yeast cells treated with adriamycin, whereas no such signal is detected in the control group. However, because of the rather strong background in the samples, quantitative results are not obtained yet. With addition of external peroxynitrite standard solutions to cells treated with adriamycin, the recovery data are obtained and shown in Table 3 , which are average values of three repeated determinations. 4 Conclusion A new method for determination of peroxynitrite, an attention-getting ROS, is built up with satisfactory sensitivity and selectivity. It is based on the oxidation of l -tyrosine by peroxynitrite in the presence of Hb. Biological sample is analyzed, and peroxynitrite in adriamycin-treated yeast cells is detected with the proposed method. The enzymatic essence of the redox reaction is revealed by kinetic studies, and Michaelis–Menten constant K m and V max are acquired. Possible pathway of the reaction and the structure of the product are recommended. Peroxynitrite is thought to be able to directly oxidize l -tyrosine under the catalysis of Hb, which produces a dimeric substance with strong intrinsic fluorescence emitted at 410.0 nm. The new product obviously differs from 3-nitro-tyrosine, the recognized product in non-enzymatic reactions, which is traditionally thought of as the marking substance of peroxynitrite injury of cells. Since Hb is much likely to coexist with peroxynitrite within living body, the enzymatic reaction might probably be another pathway of such injury to cells or organism, especially proteins with tyrosine residual.

Microwave digestion conditions and operational conditions of CAAS were optimized. The digestive solution was a mixture of hydrochloric acid-sulfuric acid (4:1, volume ratio) and the digestive time was 3 min at a microwave power of 1.0 MPa. The reaction medium was 0.5 mol x L(-1) sulfuric acid at room temperature. The characteristic concentration was 0.25 microg x L(-1). Five battery samples were determined, the recoveries were from 99.9% to 113%, and the relative standard deviations were from 4.85% to 11.9% (n = 6). The analytical results were satisfactory. The method is fast, simple, accurate and solvent-saving.",

        "abstract": "The development of bivalves has been extensively studied over the last 150 years. Despite this, the developmental dynamics of myogenesis in bivalves remains largely unknown, particularly at the early developmental stages. In the present study, we investigate the characteristics of muscle development of Yesso scallop Patinopecten yessoensis by phalloidin staining, light, electron and confocal microscopy. Myoblasts containing chaotic myofilaments are initially found in the blastocoel of trochophore, and become more organized during the transformation from trochophore into veliger. This is followed by a well-structured musculature including an anterior adductor, velum retractors and ventral retractors at the early veliger stage. With development into late veliger, larval muscle system is composed of the branched velum retractors and ventral retractors, anterior and posterior adductors. The most striking change for pediveliger is the development of foot retractor and mantle related muscles at this stage. During metamorphosis, the retractor muscles and anterior adductor undergo the irreversible shrink until vanishing completely towards the end of larval life, which coincide with the growth of foot retractor and mantle margin. All retractor muscles are found to be composed of striated fibres, whereas the adductor muscles have both smooth and striated components. The present study provides new evidences on the dynamic pattern of myogenesis during embryonic and larval development in scallops, which will greatly improve our understanding of scallop myogenesis and provide the basis for comparative analysis of muscle development in bivalves.",

        "abstract": "Objective:The increased expression of calcineurin(CaN)in podocyte can directly damage the cytoskeleton structure,leading to podocyte injury and proteinuria.It is interesting to know the expression of CaN in podocyte of patients with membranous nephropathy(MN)and its change after treatment with calcineurin inhibitor(CNI).Methodology:In the present study,the α isform of calcineurin A subunit(CnAα)expression in podocyte was detected by immunohistochemistry in 49 biopsy proven idiopathic MN,and the cytoskeleton protein,synaptopodin expression was observed at the same time in these patients.In addition,the alteration of podocyte CnAα expression after tacrolimus treatment in 2 cases of idiopathic MN were observed.Furthermore,28 cases of type V lupus nephritis and 15 cases of hepatitis B virus associated MN were used as disease controls to clarify the specifity of the podocyte CnAα expression in idiopathic MN.Results:It was found that in 49 cases of idiopathic MN patients,20 patients showed increased expression of CnAα in podocyte(40.8%),accompanied by the decreased expression and discontinuous distribution of synaptopodin in the podocyte.Repeat renal biopsy revealed that after complete remission treated with tacrolimus,the CnAα expression significantly reduced,meanwhile the intensity of synaptopodin expression increased with normalized distribution in the podocyte.None of the hepatitis B virus associated MN patients had increased expression of CnAα in podocyte,however,11 out of 28 cases of type V lupus nephritis had increased expression of CnAα in podocyte(37.9%),the frequency is similar with idiopathic MN.Conclusion:Increased expression of CnAα in podocyte was present in part of patients with idiopathic MN,this change was accompanied by the podocyte cytoskeleton destruction.After complete remission treated with CNI,the podocyte CnAα expression decreased significantly,with normalized synaptopodin expression and distribution.The tpye V lupus nephritis patients showed the similar frequency of increased expression of CnAα in podocyte with idiopathic MN,while none of the hepatitis B virus associated MN patients had increased CnAα expression.This result shed light on the individual therapy not only for idiopathic MN,but also for other podocyte disease.",

        "abstract": "Urxun-Beier depression in Hailaer Basin is the Mesozoic-Cenozoic basin located in the Paleozoic orogenic belt in Inner Mongolia-Daxing'anling area.Based on the sequence stratigraphic theory and sporopollen assemblages, stratigraphic sequences of the Lower Cretaceous have been recognized from bottom to up as: Xing'anling Group,Tongbomiao Formation,Nantun Formation,Damoguaihe Formation,Yimin Formation.The four structural belts with different directions are found in the area.The faults with NE,NEE and NS trends formed earlier with long-term activity,and control on the basin evolution;the faults with NW trend formed later and overprinted on the early structures.The structures of the area experienced four deformation stages in the Cretaceous period,which controlled on the migration,accumulation and distribution of oil and gas,and the later structures destroyed or reformed the earlier oil and gas accumulation.The unconformity within the area is an important migration pathway and good reservoir of oil and gas.The four structural belts with different trends and unconformities are the favorable zones for oil and gas accumulation in Urxun-Beier depression.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that platelet activation occurs in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW) are two markers of platelet activation, and have recently been recognised as risk predictors of cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to investigate whether MPV and PDW would be useful to reflect disease severity and predict prognosis in idiopathic PAH (IPAH).MPV and PDW levels were measured in 82 IPAH patients without antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment on admission and 82 healthy controls. Concurrent collected data included clinical, haemodynamic and biochemical variables. All patients were followed-up from the date of blood testing. The endpoint was all-cause mortality.MPV and PDW were significantly higher in patients with IPAH than in age and sex-matched control subjects (11.4±0.9fl vs. 10.3±0.9fL and 14.3±2.9% vs. 11.9±1.9%, respectively; p=0.000). Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that MPV and PDW correlated positively with right ventricular systolic pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. After a mean follow-up of 14±8 months, 12 patients died of right heart failure. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that MPV and PDW could not predict all-cause mortality. Multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that right/left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ratio and NT-proBNP were independent predictive parameters of all-cause mortality.Our results suggest that MPV and PDW were elevated in patients with IPAH. They could partly reflect disease severity, but did not predict prognosis.",

Methodology:90 patients who underwent renal biopsy and diagnosed as IgAN before enrolment in the study. They were divided into two groups. 60 patients (TW group) received the combined regime (TW at dosage of 60mg/d, ARB and Emodin) and the other 30 patients (the control group) received treatment with ARB and Emodin. Results:After the 3,6,12 months treatment, the percentage got to complete remission (CR) of TW group were 25.9%, 44.7%, 53.5%, while the control group were 7.7%, 8.40%, 14.3%. Only 3 months after the treatment, the proteinuria and hematuria decreased 55.1%, 66.7% as compared with the base line. At the 12 months' treatment, the hematuria and proteinuria significantly decreased in TW group [(84.18±111.29)×104/ml vs (17.49±23.27) ×104/ml, P<0.01. (1.09±0.38)g/24h vs (0.36±0.27)g/24h, P<0.01]. In control group, at the 12 months' treatment, the proteinuia decreased much slowly (P<0.05), no significantly change of haematuria [(87.20±115.74) ×104/ml vs (66.71±85.36)×104/ml, P>0.05]. The level of serum creatinine (SCr) kept stable in all the patients. Conclusion:Combined regime of Tripterygium wilfordii plus ARB and emodin was effective and safe in IgAN with asymptomativ abnormal urinalysis by decreasing proteinuria, haematuria and keeping renal function stable.",

Herein, the carbonate-linked PEO solid polymer such as poly(diethylene glycol carbonate) (PDEC) and poly(triethylene glycol carbonate) (PTEC) were explored to find out the feasibility of resolving above issues. It was proven that the optimized ionic conductivity of PTEC based electrolyte reached up to 1.12 × 10 −5  S cm −1  at 25 °C with a decent lithium ion transference number of 0.39 and a wide electrochemical window about 4.5 V vs. Li + /Li. In addition, the PTEC based Li/LiFePO 4  cell could be reversibly charged and discharged at 0.05  C -rates at ambient temperature. Moreover, the higher voltage Li/LiFe 0.2 Mn 0.8 PO 4  cell (cutoff voltage 4.35 V) possessed considerable rate capability and excellent cycling performance even at ambient temperature. Therefore, these carbonate-linked PEO electrolytes were demonstrated to be fascinating candidates for the next generation solid state lithium batteries simultaneously with high energy and high safety.",

Theory and experiment demonstrated that the actuators with larger resistance (real part of impedance) at resonance frequency exhibited good mechanical quality factor and coupling coefficient.

However, the actuators were destroyed after depolarizing at high temperature or poled vertical the ceramic channel by applied large voltage on them. As a result, the drive pulse and the bias voltages should be limited below the coercive voltage. Low temperature behavior has been studied from 50 K to room temperature for the actuator properties and mechanism. The resonance frequency increased as decreasing the temperature because of increasing for the stiffness coefficient at low temperature. On the other hand, the intensity of resistance at resonance frequency increased with decreasing temperature, which related to the improvement of mechanical quality factor at low temperature.",

        "abstract": "A heavy air pollution event occurred in Chengdu between 7 May 2014 and 8 May 2014. The present study established tracer sources based on HJ-1 satellite data, micropulse light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing data, and backward trajectories simulated using the hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Additionally, the present study analyzed the diffusion conditions for the sources and characteristics of the pollutant transport in this pollution event through simulation using a mesoscale atmospheric chemistry transport model—the weather research forecasting model with chemistry (WRF–CHEM). The results show that the change in the boundary-layer height over Chengdu had a relatively large effect on the vertical diffusion of pollutants. During the pollution event, Chengdu, Meishan, and Leshan were areas of significantly low mean ventilation coefficients (     V H     ). In Chengdu, the      V H      was extremely low at night, and there was a temperature inversion near the ground, resulting in the continuous accumulation of pollutants at night and a continuous worsening of the pollution. During the period of heavy pollution, there were straw-burning sites in Meishan, Ziyang, Neijiang, Zigong, and Deyang. On 7 May 2014, the pollutants in Chengdu mainly originated from Meishan. The accumulation in Chengdu of pollutants originating in Meishan and Deyang led to highly concentrated pollution on 8 May 2014, to which the pollutants originating in Deyang were the main contributor. The transport of pollutants resulting from straw burning in the study area and the relatively poor conditions for the pollutant diffusion in Chengdu collectively led to the heavy air pollution event investigated in the present study.",

At biopsy, patients with RMH were younger, had lower median proteinuria, a lower incidence of hypertension, and a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate than those in the NMH group. Pathologically, patients with RMH had a lower level of mesangial hypercellularity and segmental glomerulosclerosis as well as less tubular atrophy than those with NMH. The demographic and clinical features of patients with IMH fell between patients with RMH and those with NMH. During a median follow-up of 7.9 years, the 5-, 10- and 20-year cumulative renal survival after biopsy, as calculated by K-M methods, were 98, 91, and 91% in the RMH group, 95, 89, and 64% in the IMH group, and 95, 79, and 57% in the NMH group. The renal survival in patients with RMH was significantly better than patients with NMH or IMH.The long-term prognosis of patients who present with RMH is significantly better than patients with NMH or IMH.",

        "abstract": "Monitoring the fluctuation of hydroxyl radical (·OH) in the body can serve as an effective tool for the prediction of relative diseases; however, it is highly challenging due to the radical's short lifetime, high reactivity, and extremely low concentration. Sandwich structured lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) exhibit unique luminescence properties and great prospects in bioimaging. Nonetheless, their rather low luminescence efficiency and intensity are serious limitations for their application. Herein, we report on dual-activator codoped UCNPs with a core-multishell structure that greatly improve the luminescence intensity and lifetime by 46-fold and 2.6-fold, respectively, compared to those of the monoactivator doped sandwich structured UCNPs. Moreover, emitting ions in the designed core-multishell (CMS)-UCNPs were confined in a homogeneous and thin shell layer (∼2 nm); thus, the luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET)-based CMS-UCNPs@azo dye nanoprobe exhibited a largely shortened energy transfer distance and a pronounced luminescence quenching yield (97%), affording the nearly zero background signal and achieving an ultrahigh sensitivity for the detection of ·OH (with limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 0.10 fM). With good biocompatibility, low biotoxicity, and enhanced luminescence intensity and lifetime, the developed nanoprobe was competent in monitoring the subtle fluctuation of ·OH concentration both in vitro and in vivo.",

        "abstract": "AimTo compare the therapeutic effect of 1.88-mg and 3.75-mg gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) in the treatment of stage III–IV endometriosis after laparoscopic surgery.MethodsFifty patients with stage III–IV endometriosis diagnosed on laparoscopy were randomized into two groups according to GnRHa dose. Sex hormone level, symptoms of estrogen deficiency and lumbar vertebrae bone density were compared and analyzed between the two groups.ResultsBone density was decreased in both groups at 20 weeks after treatment, and the degree of bone density loss in the full-dose group (5.6%) was higher than in the half-dose group (1.2%; P   0.05) after resumption of menstruation. Both groups had symptoms of perimenopause at 8 weeks after treatment (P u003e 0.05), but change in Kupperman score with time differed between the groups. At 16, 20 weeks after treatment, the symptoms of perimenopause in the half-dose group were improved, and Kupperman score was lower than at 8 weeks after treatment. In the full-dose group, however, Kupperman score was higher than at 8 weeks after treatment and higher than in the half-dose group (P   0.05). Estradiol (E2) in the full-dose group was significantly lower than in the half-dose group (P u003c 0.05).ConclusionThe 1.88-mg GnRHa treatment can be used in III–IV endometriosis patients after laparoscopic surgery, to reduce perimenopausal symptoms, significantly improve bone loss, and achieve a good clinical effect.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To evaluate the effects of different modes and doses of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) on the clearance of amino acids. Methodology:Four patients requiring CRRT due to acute kidney injury were enrolled in this study.An Edward CRRT machine and AV-600 filter was used for CRRT. During each treatment session,the CRRT mode and dose was switched as following order every 20 minutes:continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) 2 000 ml/h,4 000 ml/h,continuous veno-venous hemofiltration(CVVH) through pre-dilution route (pre-CVVH) 2 000 ml/h,4 000 ml/h,CVVH through post-dilution route(post-CVVH)2 000 ml/h,4 000 ml/h.Each time before the switching of mode or dose,the blood samples were drawn from the pre-filter site (before replacement fluid infusion in pre-CVVH mode) and post-filter site,as well as effluent samples.All specimens were measured for urea nitrogen(UN),creatinine (Cr),5 essential amino acids(Valine,Methionine,Isoleucine,Leucine,Lysine),2 semi-essential amino acids(Arginine,Histidine),and 5 non-essential amino acids(Aspartic acid,Glumatic acid,Glycine,Citrulline,Ornithine).Sieving coefficient (SC) and clearance of all the above-mentioned solutes were calculated based on the measured data. Results:The SCs of Aspartate acid and Glumatic acid were (0.5±0.04) and (0.48±0.07),respectively;and the SCs of other 10 amino acids were nearly 0.9. During various dose and mode,clearances of UN and Cr were comparable.With the dose of 2 000 ml/h,the clearances of UN/Cr under the CVVHD,Pre-CVVH,post-CVVH modes were 32.7/32.68 ml/min,23.95/24.69 ml/min,32.62/32.22 ml/min,respectively;while with the dose of 4 000 ml/h,the clearances of UN/Cr under the CVVHD,Pre-CVVH,post-CVVH modes were 62.73/63.31 ml/min,45.59/48.09 ml/min,and 65.16/66.41 ml/min,respectively.In all modes and doses,the clearance of Aspartic acid and Glumatic acid was much lower than other 10 amino acids,but without obvious differences of clearance between the 10 amino acids. With the dose of 2 000 ml/h,the clearances of Aspartate acid/Glumatic acid under the CVVHD,Pre-CVVH,post-CVVH modes were 18.08/16.79 ml/min,13.39/13.33 ml/min and 19.1/19.6 ml/min,respectively;while the clearance of other 10 amino acids were 28.31～32.18 ml/min,21.6～24.9 ml/min and 27.38～32.4 ml/min, respectively.With the dose of 4 000 ml/hr,the clearances of Aspartate acid/Glumatic acid under the CVVHD,Pre-CVVH, post-CVVH modes were 36.95/32.88 ml/min,29.37/26.86 ml/min and 37.82/34.79 ml/min,respectively;while the clearance of other 10 amino acids were 59.18～64.8 ml/min, 46.71～50.64 ml/min and 58.83～65.1 ml/min,respectively. Conclusion:The mode of CRRT has an impact on the clearance of amino acids,but the effects of CRRT dose are more dominant.",

Methodology:One hundred and sixty renal allograft recipients were enrolled in this prospective study, among them 11 cases were diagnosed as having AHR during 2 weeks post transplantation. The diagnosis was based on clinical manifestations, histological changes and C4d staining. Once rejection episode occurred, pulse methylprednisone therapy was selected as the first-line treatment. At the same time, all the patients were subjected to tacrolimus/MMF rescue. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) other than regular hemodialysis was performed when patients need dialysis. No other rescue methods such as ATG, immunoadsorption, PP et al were used in this group according to the study design. Results:Among the 11 patients, there were 9 middle age females and two males, no recipients had response to pulse methylprednisolone treatment, and 10 received CBP. After (16.19±6.16) days of treatment, all rejection episodes were successfully reversed, and the graft function were stable during the follow-up. Conclusion:Our data suggests that FK506 combined with MMF alone can effectively reverse almost early AHR after renal transplantation in renal allograft recipients.",

        "abstract": "Hailar basin is a Meso-Cenozoic basin which superimposed on the Inner Mongolia-Greater Hinggan Mountain Paleozoic collision orogenic belt. Wuerxun sag which is a second-order structural unit in the middle part of Hailar basin, has been experienced 3 times extension and 2 times compression since the Early Cretaceous. The stratigraphic thickness and migration of subsidence centers in Wuerxun sag are mainly controlled by syngenetic fault and fault-related fold. On the extension period, when a half-graben formed on the hanging wall of the listric normal fault, one or more subsidence centers which located in hanging wall of the fault and near the fault formed at the part of the fault that the stretching amount is lager than the other part; When the multiple independent half-grabens formed on the hanging wall of the listric normal faults, every half-graben has its own subsidence center, and the intersection of different direction faults is often the subsidence center of the fault depression. With the increase of stretch amount, the subsidence center of the fault depression constantly migrated to the opposite direction of the slip direction of the control subsidence fault, and the scale of the basin gradually increased. On the first compression period, the early NS trending control subsidence fault F1 reversed, the hanging wall near the fault occurred uplift, and the part away from the fault, as the front limb of a large fault-propagation fold anticline, also occurred rotary uplift. Wuerxun sag became the front syncline of a large NS trending fault-propagation fold anticline, the stratigraphic thickness is very thin near the fault and away from the fault, the stratigraphic thickness gradually increases to the front syncline of the large fault-propagation fold anticline, and the subsidence center migrates to the low-lying areas of the syncline. On the second compression period, the early NS trending control subsidence fault F2 reversed, a large-scale NS trending fault propagation fold anticline or pop up formed in the middle part of Wuerxun sag. The top of the anticline or pop up were eroded, and the subsidence centers located in the low-lying area of the front and rear synclines.",

Renal function was assayed at months 0 (right after treatment), 1, 3, and 6 of the experiment. Renal histological examination was also performed.1) At month 0, the renal functional changes of acute renal injury included azotemia, low molecular weight proteinuria, glycosuria, hypoosmotic urine, and NAG enzymuria. Histopathological changes showed acute tubular necrosis, predominantly at the corticomedullary junction. 2) At months 1 and 3, the renal function of rats of the experiment was gradually restored and histopathologic examination suggested that the tubular lesions gradually recovered. In HE sections, basophilic deposits were observed in the tubular cytoplasm. And interstitial infiltration of inflammatory cells was not prominent. 3) At months 6, renal preneoplastic lesions, renal tumors, and extrarenal tumors occurred in rats. The occurrence of renal preneoplastic lesions at dosages of 50 g.kg-1.d-1, 30 g.kg-1.d-1, and 20 g.kg-1.d-1 were 100.0% at all three doses, renal tumors 42.8%, 25.0%, and 0%, respectively, extrarenal tumors 14.4%, 12.5%, and 12.5%, respectively, and systemic tumors 57.2%, 37.5%, and 12.5%, respectively. The occurrence of basophilic deposits, renal preneoplastic lesions, renal tumors, and extrarenal tumors in normal control group was nil.1) Administration of large dosage of Aristolochia manshuriensis Kom induces acute renal failure in rats. 2) The long-term renal function and histopathologic changes of acute renal injury induced by Aristolochia manshuriensis Komrecover spontaneously. 3) Aristolochia manshuriensis Kom has been proved to be oncogenic for the first time.",

They underwent an initial biopsy before steroid and CTX intermittent intravenous pulse therapy and were biopsied again one to three months later. Expression of MCP-1, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and CD68 in glomeruli with cellular and fibrocellular crescents were examined by immunohistochemical analysis in serial sections of renal biopsies. The effect of the pulse therapy on histopathological changes was also observed.Although steroid and CTX intermittent intravenous pulse therapy markedly reduced the degree of glomerular crescent formation both in LN-CGN and V-CGN, the effect of the therapy on glomerular chemokine expression was significantly different between LN-CGN and V-CGN. It was found that steroid and CTX intermittent intravenous pulse therapy reduced the expression of CD68, MCP-1, and MIP-1alpha, but had no effect on MIP-1beta in glomeruli with cellular crescents of patients with LN-CGN. In patients with V-CGN, the therapy also reduced the expression of CD68, but had no effect on MCP-1, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-1beta in glomeruli with cellular crescents. It was noted that the degree of glomerulosclerosis and tubular interstitial fibrosis increased more significantly at the second biopsy in V-CGN as compared to LN-CGN.The efficacy of steroid and CTX intermittent intravenous pulse therapy in CGN might be affected by reduction of glomerular chemokine expression. The different changes in glomerular expression of MCP-1 and MIP-1alpha in patients with LN-CGN and V-CGN after pulse therapy may correlate to different responses to treatment and prognosis.",

        "abstract": "Cooperative jamming is a popular technique for physical layer security, which is helpful to increase the secrecy of communication networks. To enhance the performance of cooperative jamming, this paper proposed a two-layer network consisting of a social network and a physical communication network. Each user is in the social network and their willingness of providing jamming is modeled by a susceptible-infective-recovery(SIR) spreading model, while devices of each user and their connection are presented in the physical communication network as the lower layer. The concept of social tie is introduced to the description of connections between two layers, and game theory is used to model processes of cooperative jamming. It is discovered that stronger social tie and SIR model is helpful to decrease secrecy outage probability of communication networks. Furthermore, our proposed two-layer network can raise the efficiency of designing strategies for cooperative jamming. Simulation results also demonstrate the proposed model and algorithms successfully enhance the secrecy performance for communication networks.",

        "abstract": "Electrochemical performance of high-voltage lithium batteries with high energy density is limited because of the electrolyte instability and the electrode/electrolyte interfacial reactivity. Hence, a cross-linking polymer network of poly(acrylic anhydride-2-methyl-acrylic acid-2-oxirane-ethyl ester-methyl methacrylate) (PAMM)-based electrolyte was introduced via in situ polymerization inspired by \"shuangjian hebi\", which is a statement in a traditional Chinese Kungfu story similar to the synergetic effect of 1 + 1 > 2. A poly(acrylic anhydride) and poly(methyl methacrylate)-based system is very promising as electrolyte materials for lithium-ion batteries, in which the anhydride and acrylate groups can provide high voltage resistance and fast ionic conductivity, respectively. As a result, the cross-linking PAMM-based electrolyte possesses a significant comprehensive enhancement, including electrochemical stability window exceeding 5 V vs Li/Li, an ionic conductivity of 6.79 × 10 S cm at room temperature, high mechanical strength (27.5 MPa), good flame resistance, and excellent interface compatibility with Li metal. It is also demonstrated that this gel polymer electrolyte suppresses the negative effect resulting from dissolution of Mn ions at 25 and 55 °C. Thus, the LiNiMnO/Li and LiNiMnO/LiTiO cells using the optimized in situ polymerized cross-linking PAMM-based gel polymer electrolyte deliver stable charging/discharging profiles and excellent rate performance at room temperature and even at 55 °C. These findings suggest that the cross-linking PAMM is an intriguing candidate for 5 V class high-voltage gel polymer electrolyte toward high-energy lithium-on batteries.",

Methods From 2003 to 2007, 11 patients with TKA were treated, of whom 2 were diagnosed as having acute infection and 9 as having chronic infection. Infectious bacteria included Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=3), Staphylococcus aureus (n=4), Kawasaki bacilli (n=1) and Candida parapsilosis (n=1). Results Of the 11 patients, 4 were treated with debridement and retention of prosthesis, and infection recurred in 2 of them; 4 were treated with stage II revision, in whom no recurrence of infection was observed during a 3-48 months follow-up and the mean KSS score was 83; and the remaining 3 patients were treated with Knee fusion, whose knee joints were fused completely during a 1 6-12 months follow-up, although the wound failed to heal after operation in one patient. Conclusions Post TKR infection is a severe complication. Early diagnosis and proper treatment is necessary once it is confirmed. Stage II revision is the clinical treatment of choice for post TKR infection.",

The effect of NaOH concentration, oxygen partial pressure, temperature, liquid/solid ratio and reaction time on the leaching of arsenic, antimony and lead were investigated. It was found that u003e 95% of arsenic was selectively leached using 40 g/L NaOH with the oxygen partial pressure of 0.5 MPa at a liquid/solid ratio of 10 and 140 °C for 2 h, while almost of antimony and lead remained in the residue. The complete separation of arsenic and antimony can be attributed to the oxidative transformation of arsenic and antimony. The low solubility sodium arsenite was completely oxidized to highly soluble sodium arsenate, while Sb 2 O 3  was transformed into insoluble Sb 3 O 6 (OH) and NaSb(OH) 6 . In addition, the filtration performance of leach slurry was significantly improved due to reaction under hydrothermal conditions.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Explore the diagnosis and treatment of pure red cell aplasia(PRCA) induced by human parvovirus B19 in patients with allograft renal transplantation.Methods:4 cases of allograft renal transplantation patients suffered from HPV-B19 infection with the symptom of PRCA were analyzed retrospectively of the clinical features,diagnostic methods,treatment process and prognosis.These 4 cases who received several courses Intravenous immunoglobulin(IVIG) were cured finally and followed-up for 24 months.Results:(1) The 4 of 6 renal transplant recipients in our center appears highly similar clinical symptoms such as fever,gradually hemoglobin(Hb) decreasing within 60 days post-transplantation;(2) 4 cases of HPV-B19 infection were confirmed by anti-HPV-B19-IgM/IgG examination,bone marrow aspiration and other laboratory examinations,combined with epidemiological characteristics;(3) HPV-B19-associated PRCA can be cured by IVIG and adjusted baseline immunosuppression regimen,and may be recurrent in these immunocompromised patients,and the following course of IVIG would be still effective.Conclusion:(1) Anemia is a prominent clinical symptoms in patients after renal transplantation infected with HPV-B19,HPV-B19 infection should be suspected for such patients with unaccountability anemia;(2) PCR technology and/or specific IgM/IgG examination,bone marrow aspiration,and other laboratory examines will meet the requirements of HPV-B19 diagnosis;(3)IVIG is recommended as first regimen to control the serious HPV-B19 infection-associated PRCA in patients with renal allograft transplantation,while baseline immunosuppression regimen should be carefully adjusted and lowered to reduce relapse probability.",

        "abstract": "Objective To study the influences of nucleoside analogue on hepatitis B virus(HBV) cccDNA,tDNA and serum HbsAg in chronic hepatitis B(CHB) patients.Methods The levels of hepatocellular cccDNA,tDNA,and serum HBV DNA were determined in four CHD patients who were treated by nucleoside analogue antiviral therapy and met the drug withdrawal criteria(NAAT group) and in 12 CHB patients who did not receive any antiviral therapy with HBV DNA being 1.0×103 copies/ml(control group).The level of HbsAg was determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA),and the influences of nucleoside analogue on HBV viral indexes was analyzed.Results The levels of hepatocellular cccDNA,tDNA,and serum HBV DNA were significantly lower in the NAAT group than in control group,although low level of HBV cccDNA was still detected in hepatic cells.No relapse was noted in the NAAT group 9,12,19,and 19 months after drug withdrawal.Conclusion Long-term nucleoside analogue therapy may consume hepatocellular cccDNA and contribute to the decrease of hepatocellular tDNA and serum HBsAg.In patients who meet the drug withdrawal criteria for CHB,low level of HBVcccDNA can still be detected in hepatocytes even after 2 years′ nucleoside analogue therapy,and cessation of therapy may cause relapse.",

The expression of ANGPTL2 was assessed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, and then correlated with biochemical and histological indices of kidney injury. No significant difference of ANGPTL2 expression was found in the kidney of db/db mice and the control db/m mice at the age of 4 weeks, a time when all biochemical and histological indices indicated that the db/db mice were in pre-diabetic condition. However, with the development of obesity, hyperglycemia and proteinuria, the expression of ANGPTL2 in the kidney of db/db mice increased, which indicated that the increased expression of ANGPTL2 associated with diabetic nephropathy. ANGPTL2 protein was found distributed mainly in the glomerulus. It is along the capillary loop, located just outside the basement membrane, and in the same location as podocytes, which suggested that podocytes are the main origin of ANGPTL2 in the kidney. Besides, increased expression of ANGPTL2 was found in older db/m mice though it has not reached to a significant level, which may suggest that ANGPTL2 might have some thing to do with the kidney injury caused by ageing.",

The acute hemodynamic and oxygenation responses and adverse events were recorded.Iloprost decreased total pulmonary resistance ((1747 ± 918) dyn×s×cm(-5) vs. (1581 ± 937) dyn×s×cm(-5), P < 0.001), increased stroke volume ((45.0 ± 22.1) ml vs. (47.0 ± 24.2) ml, P = 0.002), and cardiac output ((3.7 ± 1.7) L/ml vs. (3.9 ± 1.9) L/min, P = 0.009). Heart rate and systemic vascular resistance remained stable during inhalation. However, systemic arterial blood oxygen saturation fell slightly ((91.0 ± 6.8)% vs. (90.3 ± 6.7)%, P = 0.002). Pulmonary and systemic arterial blood pressures declined within 1 - 3 minutes after inhalation initiation and reached their lowest levels within 10 - 15 minutes. Idiopathic PAH responded more favorably than pulmonary hypertension due to other causes (P £0.001) and patients with less severe pulmonary hypertension have better responses to Iloprost. No adverse events requiring medical care or leading to termination of inhalation occurred.Inhalation of 20 µg Iloprost showed potent and selective pulmonary hemodynamic effects and was well tolerated in the Chinese pulmonary hypertension patients. Patients with idiopathic PAH and less severe pulmonary hypertension responded more favorably to inhalation of Iloprost.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To investigate the etiology, histopathological and immunofluorescence features in patients with secondary IgA nephropathy. Methodology:1 324 patients from Mar. 1985 to Feb 2007 were enrolled in this retrospective study. All of the patients were met the following diagnosis criteria: 1) the light microscopic examination showed an increase in both mesangial cells and matrix, including mesangial expansion, with or without segmental peripheral loops lesions such as necrosis, scar and crescents. 2) Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed the definitive characteristic dominant or co-dominant deposits of IgA in mesangial area, IgG, IgM and/or C3 might be also present, and not included IgA deposition in diffuse peripheral loops. 3) The renal lesions resulted in original diseases. The etiology, histological, immunofluorescent features and uremia analysis were investigated and compared. Results:1)In this study, the patients suffered from original diseases were Henoch-Schnlein purpura in 1 172 (88.5%), Psoriasis Vulgaris in 25 (1.9%), Thyroid Gland disease in 25 (1.9%), Hepatitis B infection in 22 (1.7%), Rheumatoid arthritis in 22 (1.4%), Sjogren syndrome in 16 (1.2%), ankylosing spondylitis in 16 (1.2%) and so on. 2) In histological examination, all patients presented mesangial lesions, with or without segmental peripheral loops lesions. The acute lesions showed fibrinoid necrosis and crescents, and the chronic lesions were peripheral loops scar. The swelling and pairing endothelial cells and infiltrating cells were also found. In addition to, the patients with original disease had the respective features. 3) The diffuse IgA deposition in mesangial area was the defining hallmark. IgG and/or IgM might be co-deposited. IgA, IgG and IgM might also be found in the same distribution. Immunoglobulin deposit might prolong the segmental peripheral loops occasionally. 4) The degree of pathological lesions was associated with the site and category of immunoglobulin deposit and urinalysis. Conclusion:Secondary IgA-nephropathy was a series of the original diseases. Although the similar histological and immunofluorescent features presented in these patients, there were respective features of original diseases.",

DCGN is categorized into three types according to immunopathologic characteristics. The incidence of this disease, its primary diseases, clinical characteristics and serum antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) were analyzed.The distribution of patients among the three classifications was 8.7% type I, 68.6% type II and 22.7% type III. Clinically, the majority of patients (69.8%) presented rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), but 30.2% manifested a chronic nephritic syndrome or chronic renal failure. In terms of related conditions, 93% were anemic, 61.6% had hypertension, 50.6% oliguria, 45.3% nephrotic syndrome, 43% uremic syndrome and 39.5% displayed gross hematuria. Those patients who were positive in serum for ANCAs had predominantly type III DCGN. Two cases with anti-GBM-antibody crescentic glomerulonephritis and three with lupus nephritis were also positive for ANCAs in serum.DCGN is not rare in Chinese patients. A majority of patients in our study presented with RPGN, but 30.2% manifested a chronic renal failure. Lupus patients with DCGN that were positive for ANCAs had more severe vasculitic lesions.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the efficacy of adefovir dipivoxil(ADV) on chronic hepatitis B(CHB) patients with HBV DNA breakthrough(>1.0×10 3 copies/ml) after lamivudine(LAM) treatment.Methods Forty-nine CHB patients with HBV DNA breakthrough after LAM treatment were divided into 3 groups.Patients in group A(n=12) were switched to ADV directly.Patients in group B(n=25) were given a combination therapy of ADV and LAM until HBV DNA levels under 1.0 ×10 3 copies/ml were achieved and then ADV alone.Patients in group C(n=12) received a combination therapy of ADV and LAM constantly.The serum HBV DNA levels were observed over 12 months of rescue treatment.Results HBV DNA levels under 1.0×10 3 copies/ml were achieved in 10 patients in group A after a median treatment duration of(3.50±2.07) months(range 1-7 months),in 21 patients in group B after a median treatment duration of(2.05±1.36) months(range 1-5 months),and in 12 patients in group C after a median treatment duration of(1.33±0.65) months(range 1-3 months).Virologic response was maintained more than 12 months in the patients undergoing successful rescue treatment.There were no serious adverse effects such as renal function impairment during the treatment.Conclusions A switch to ADV treatment,a combination treatment of ADV and LAM and then ADV alone and a constant combination treatment of ADV and LAM are all safe and efficient for CHB patients with HBV DNA breakthrough after LAM treatment.Moreover,the constant combination therapy may be the most rapid and efficient rescue strategy to suppress viral replication.",

If only the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and ambient noise are taken into consideration, a square root law was obtained and the result shows that the privacy rate approaches zero asymptotically. In this paper, we consider the covert communication in large-scale wireless networks, where the transmitters form a stationary Poisson point process, and Alice wishes to communicate covertly to Bob without being detected by warden Dave. In this scenario, Bob and Dave not only experience the ambient noise, but also the aggregate interference simultaneously. Although the interference sources are not in collusion with Alice, and Bobu0027s noise increases as well, our results show that, the measurement uncertainty of Dave will increase along with the increase of interference, and interference can indeed improve the performance of covert communication.",

        "abstract": "MapReduce has become a popular model for large-scale data processing in recent years. However, existing MapRe-duce schedulers still suffer from an issue known as partitioning skew, where the output of map tasks is unevenly distributed among reduce tasks. In this paper, we present DREAMS, a framework that provides run-time partitioning skew mitigation. Unlike previous approaches that try to balance the workload of reducers by repartitioning the intermediate data assigned to each reduce task, in DREAMS we cope with partitioning skew by adjusting task run-time resource allocation. We show that our approach allows DREAMS to eliminate the overhead of data repartitioning. Through experiments using both real and synthetic workloads running on a 11-node virtual virtualised Hadoop cluster, we show that DREAMS can effectively mitigate negative impact of partitioning skew, thereby improving job performance by up to 20.3%.",

The transition region thicknesses of the Si layers grown under different PH3 flux and different growth temperatures were investigated by spread-resistance probe. Results show that the growth temperature has remarkable influence on the arsenic diffusion from the Si substrate. The thickness of the transition region was 0.16 μm grown at 700°C and 0.06 μm at 500°C, respectively. Moreover, the dopant profiles were very abrupt. X-ray diffraction investigation of the Si layer grown at 700°C shows that the quality of Si layer is very high. Silicon-germanium hetero-junction bipolar transistor (SiGe HBT) was fabricated by a revised double-mesa polysilicon-emitter process. Tests show that the CB-junction breakdown characteristic of the SiGe HBT is very hard, and the leakage current is only 0.3 μA at VCB=14.0 V. The SiGe HBT device also had good output performance with current gain β=60 at VCE=5 V and IC= 3 mA.",

Compared with the MCD group, patients with MCD-IgAN had lower levels of baseline serum albumin (p   0.05). The median time to achieve remission was 4 weeks (range 1 - 24 weeks) and 4 weeks (range 1 - 28 weeks), respectively. No significant difference existed in the efficacy of corticosteroid between the two groups. During 3.96 years (range 3.0 - 8.5 years) of follow-up, no patients in the two groups entered end-stage renal disease (ESRD), only 2 patients (2.6%) with MCD-IgAN had u003e 50% reduction of eGFR.MCD-IgAN may be controlled well achieving a comparable clinical outcome as MCD but more frequently necessitates additional immunosuppressive medication.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effectiveness of using continuous veno venous hemofiltration (CVVH) in the treatment of acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP).Thirteen ANP patients were involved in this study, including 4 females and 9 males, averaging 50.6 +/- 10.8 years old. CT scans upon admission revealed 33% necrosis involving the body of the pancreas in 2 patients, 67% necrosis in 3 patients and 100% necrosis in the other 8; the CT severity score was 8.9 +/- 2.1. CVVH was maintained for at least 72 hours and the AN69 hemofilter (1.2 m(2)) was changed every 24 hours. The ultrafiltration rate during CVVH was 2993.9 +/- 983.0 ml/h, the blood flow rate was 250 - 300 ml/min, and the substitute fluid was infused in a pre-diluted manner. Low molecular weight heparin was used as anticoagulant.CVVH was well tolerated in all the patients. Bloody abdominal cavity drainage fluid was observed in 2 patients, but no other side-effects related with CVVH were observed. Two patients died of systemic fungal infections and another died of intracranial fungi infection, resulting in an ICU mortality of 23.1%. Ten of the patients survived in the ICU, but one of them died for other reasons unrelated to the SAP before discharge. The APACHE II score before CVVH was 15.2 +/- 6.5, but decreased significantly to 8.1 +/- 5.3, 7.5 +/- 4.9 and 8.0 +/- 5.2 at the 24th, 48th and 72nd hour after CVVH, respectively (P < 0.01). Serum concentration of IL-1beta and TNFalpha decreased to the trough at the 6th hour after a new hemofilter was used and increased slowly to pre-CVVH levels 12 hours later. After CVVH had ceased, the serum levels of two cytokines increased to their peaks at the 120th hour and decreased eventually at the 144th hour. The sieving coefficient (SC) of IL-1beta and TNFalpha was 0.33 +/- 0.11 and 0.16 +/- 0.08.CVVH offered therapeutic options for ANP and was well tolerated resulting in clearance of IL-1beta and TNFalpha; CVVH at early stages of SAP may contribute to the improvement of outcome.",

The structures of cesium 5-sulfosalicylate, cesium 3,5-dinitrosalicylate and cesium 2,4-dinitrophenoxide monohydrate have been determined through X-ray diffraction analysis. The 5-sulfosalicylate anion has lost the proton at the −SO 3 H group while the 3,5-dinitrosalicylate anion at −COOH group but both retains the usual intermolecular hydrogen bond between phenolic and carboxylic oxygen. In cesium 2,4-dinitrophenoxide monohydrate, the Cs + cation is 12-coordinate by O atoms in anions and water molecules while the metal atoms in cesium 5-sulfosalicylate and cesium 3,5-dinitrosalicylate have coordination numbers 10 and 11, respectively, with an irregular coordination sphere made up exclusively of oxygen atoms. Even more in cesium 2,4-dinitrophenoxide monohydrate, the water molecules are in rare triply bridging positions between these cations. Both complexes have layer structures containing the cations and polar groups of the ligands in core domains sandwiched by the aromatic rings above and below. The organization of all layer structures appears to be governed mainly by steric effects and electrostatic forces with very little directional influence of the cations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A paper-supported aptasensor was constructed for total IgE using a luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) protocol with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as energy donors and carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) as energy acceptors. This is the first time that zero-dimensional carbon nanoparticles were used as energy acceptors for paper-based LRET assays. The π-π stacking interaction between the aptamer and CNPs brought the energy donor (UCNPs) and energy acceptor (CNPs) in close proximity, induced the LRET process on the surface of paper and thus led to the luminescence quenching of UCNPs. The introduction of IgE inhibited the energy transfer and hence recovered the luminescence of UCNPs in a concentration-dependent manner, as a result of the recognition between IgE and aptamer. This aptasensor can be used to detect IgE concentration in the range of 0.5–80 ng/mL in both buffer solution and human serum samples. The IgE concentrations measured by our method were well correlated to those obtained from chemiluminescence-based clinical assay. Owing to its simplicity and accuracy, the proposed sensor thus showed the potential of clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To investigate the clinical and pathological features in patients of membranous nephropathy (MN) associated with psoriasis vulgaris. Methodology:Seventeen patients of MN associated with psoriasis vulgaris were included in this retrospective study. The renal biopsy was performed in all patients. Immunohistochemical method was used to detect the distribution of IgG subclasses in renal tissues. Results:①They were 12 males and 5 females with the mean age of (41.7±13.5) years old. ②The mean history of psoriasis vulgaris was 8.1 years,and the time between psoriasis and nephropathy were from 10 to 179.5 months (mean of 86.1±62.2). 16 cases presented edema. The average of urinary protein excretion was (3.94±2.29) g/24 h. ③Elevated urinary NAG (12 cases,71%) and RBP (8 cases,47%),decreased urinary osmotic pressure (14 cases,82%) were noted. ④The histological examination showed thickening of glomerular capillary walls and mild mesangial proliferation. Endothelial cell proliferation and leukocyte infiltration were observed in 8 cases. Vascular involvement,including arteriolar hyalinosis and incrassation,was observed in 10 patients. ⑤By immunofluorescent microscopy,the granular deposits of IgG,C3,C4 and C1q along the capillary walls were in 5 patients,and the granular deposits of IgG,IgA,IgM,C3,C4 and C1q along the capillary walls were in 2 cases. ⑥The deposition of IgG1 and IgG4 was also detected in the glomerular capillary walls. The deposition of IgG1 was stronger than IgG4. The segmental deposition of IgG subclasses was found in 3 patients. In addition to,the deposition of IgG subclasses on the peritubular capillary and the tubular basement membrane was in 2 cases. Conclusion:The patients of MN associated with psoriasis vulgaris presented edema and nephropathic proteinuria. The histological examination showed non-typical membranous nephropathy with obvious tubulointerstitial lesions. The granular deposits of C4 and C1q were observed in some patients by immunohistochemical examination. The deposition of IgG1 was stronger than IgG4.",

For the benefits of deep penetration and small deformation, electron beam welding (EBW) was selected for port stub butt-joint welding. Unacceptable defects such as vertical crack, non-fusion and non-penetration might appear in this kind of large depth-to-width ratio weld.  In this paper, the phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) method was introduced. Reference blocks with artificial defects of different lengths and heights were fabricated, and then tested by 2.5 MHz 64el dual element matrix array probe and 2.25 MHz 64el single linear array probe. Detection sensitivity of 0.2 mm in width was achieved. In the end, the above probes were successfully applied on the detection of the EBW testing blocks with natural defects. The testing results of reference and testing blocks implied the full capability of the selected probes.",

        "abstract": "An obesity paradox, a &amp;quot;paradoxical&amp;quot; decrease in morbidity and mortality with increasing body mass index (BMI), has been shown in patients with heart failure. However, the impact of BMI in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) has not been studied. This study aims to find out whether BMI is a prognostic factor in IPAH.We analysed 173 patients with IPAH. The patients were subclassified into categories of BMI defined as: under-weight (&amp;lt; 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2), overweight and obese (25 to 34.9 kg/m2). The three BMI groups had similar profiles in terms of haemodynamic parameters assessed by right heart catheterization and level of NT-proBNP. The overweight and obese group had higher age, and lower WHO functional class, larger left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions (LVEDDs) than the other two groups.The Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the three BMI categories demonstrated that the overweight and obese group had a significantly higher survival rate than the normal weight and underweight groups (log-rank test, P = 0.027, P = 0.000, respectively). In a stepwise forward regression, lower BMI, higher WHO functional class, lower cardiac index, smaller LVEDDs and absence of targeted medication remained independent predictors of mortality.Excess body mass is a protective factor for death in patients with IPAH.",

        "abstract": "Objective:A prospective,non-controlled study to observe the clinical efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) dispersible tablets in the treatment of patients with class III and class IV lupus nephritis. Methodology:Twenty-three patients with renal biopsy-proved active class III and class IV lupus nephritis were enrolled in this study. All patients had urinary protein≥1.0 g/24h,and serum creatinine<265.2 μmol/L. They were treated with corticosteroids and MMF dispersible tablets (Cycopin,Hangzhou Zhongmei Huadong Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd). The starting dose of MMF was 1.0-1.5 g/d,MMF doses were then controlled by blood MPA concentration (MPA-AUC0-12 h) to get the target AUC level of 30-40 mg·h/L during the first three months of induction period. The primary efficacy parameter was the complete and partial remission rate at 6 months. Results:They were 19 females and 4 males with an average age of (32.5±10.9) years old. Renal histology showed class III in 9 patients,and classs IV in 14 patients. The average dose of MMF was (1.13±0.40) g/d with MPA-AUC0-12 h level (35.80±9.31) mg·h/L. At the end of 6 months of induction therapy,11 cases (47.8%) had complete remission,and 11 patients (47.8%) had partial remission,and the total remission rate was 95.6%. The patients in class III had higher remission rate than that in class IV (complete remission rate 55.6% vs 42.9%,P>0.05,and total remission rate 100% vs 92.9%,P>0.05). The adverse events including herpes zoster (13.0%),gastrointestinal symptom (4.3%) and elevation of liver enzymes (4.3%) were observed and no one developed pulmonary infection. Conclusion:Induction treatment with steroids and MMF dispersible tablets showed high remission rate for patients with class III and IV lupus nephritis without severe side effects by concentration-controlled MMF doses.",

Genome-wide association studies found rs955333 located in 6q25.2 was associated with diabetic kidney disease in multiple ethnic populations, including European Americans, African Americans, and Mexican Americans. We aimed to investigate the association between the variant rs955333 in SCAF8-CNKSR3 and DKD susceptibility in Chinese type 2 diabetes patients. Methods. The variant rs955333 was genotyped in 1884 Chinese type 2 diabetes patients. Associations of the variant rs955333 with DKD and DR susceptibility and related quantitative traits were evaluated. Results. The variant rs955333 was not associated with DKD in our samples, while subjects with genotype GG were associated with DR (, OR = 0.5525 ), and it also showed association with microalbuminuria (, beta = −0.1812 ). Conclusion. Our data suggests the variant rs955333 was not associated with DKD but showed association with diabetic retinopathy in Chinese type 2 diabetes patients.",

        "abstract": "It is indisputable that immunosuppressive therapy and pathological diagnosis of renal biopsy have greatly improved the prognosis of childhood nephrotic syndrome. Unfortunately, there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach for precise patient stratification and treatment when facing the huge challenges posed by steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). But genomic medicine has brought a glimmer of light, and the cognition of SRNS has entered a new stage. Based on this, identification of single genetic variants of SRNS has recognized the key role of podocyte injury in its pathogenesis. Targeted treatment of podocyte injury is paramount, and immunosuppressant with podocyte-targeted therapy seems to be more suitable as the first choice for SRNS, that is, we need to pay attention to their additional non-immunosuppressive effects. In the same way, other effect factors of nephrotic syndrome and the related causes of immunosuppressive therapy resistance require us to select reasonable and targeted non-immunosuppressive therapies, instead of only blindly using steroids and immunosuppressants, which may be ineffective and bring significant side effects. This article provides a summary of the clinical value of identification of genetic variants in podocytes and non-immunosuppressive therapy for nephrotic syndrome in children.",

Pre- and post-radiation DC characteristics of the transistors are used to quantify the dose tolerance to the two different irradiation sources. Measurement results indicate that the devices exhibit a total dose tolerance up to Mrad level. The device response is indeed radiation source dependent and the proton irradiation can produce a more significant damage than the gamma irradiation, causing more pronounced performance degradation. The experimental results from both irradiations are compared and discussed in detail, and furthermore the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed and investigated. The considerably different degradation behaviors are attributed to the extra displacement damage besides ionizing damage induced by the proton irradiation. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of immunoadsorption treatment in patients with lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG). Methodology:Seventeen patients with biopsy proven LPG were enrolled in this study. They were divided into two groups according to their treatment ways. Eight patients received immunoadsorption on protein A of the staphylococcus bacterium (SPA) plus routine treatment. The other 9 patients received only routine treatment. The levels of proteinuria,serum creatinine,plasma lipid and apoE before and after immunoadsorption treatment were compared. The long-term outcomes between the two groups were analysed. Results: (1) The levels of proteinuria,serum creatinine,plasma lipid and apoE were dramatically decreased (P<0.05) after immunoadsorption in all of the 8 patients. Repeated biopsy found the lipoprotein thrombi diminished or even disappeared. (2) The repeated immunoadsorption treatment in patients with relapse after the treatment showed the effective result as same as that of the first treatment,and the remission time has been prolonged in these patients. (3) Follow up data showed that the proteinuria and serum creatinine levels increased slower in patients who received immunoadsorption treatment than in patients of the control group after six-month,one-year and two-year follow-up. The median time that the serum creatinine increased 50 percent was 67 months for the patients who underwent immunoadsorption treatment,while it was 6 months for patients in the control group,but no statistical significance. Conclusion:We demonstrated that the immunoadsorption treatment for LPG did dramatically decrease proteinuria and improve renal function immediately after treatment. By comparing the two groups during the long-term follow-up,we found that the immunoadsorption treatment could protect renal function and delay the progression in patients with LPG.",

Here, we measured anti-PLA2R antibody in the serum of 60 patients with idiopathic MN, 20 with lupus-associated MN, 16 with hepatitis B (HBV)-associated MN, and 10 with tumor-associated MN. Among patients with idiopathic MN, 49 (82%) had detectable anti-PLA2R autoantibodies using a Western blot assay; an assay with greater sensitivity detected very low titers of anti-PLA2R in 10 of the remaining 11 patients. Using the standard assay, we detected anti-PLA2R antibody in only 1 patient with lupus, 1 with HBV, and 3 with cancer, producing an overall specificity of 89% in this cohort limited to patients with secondary MN. The enhanced assay detected low titers of anti-PLA2R in only 2 additional samples of HBV-associated MN. In summary, these results suggest that PLA2R is a major target antigen in Chinese idiopathic MN and that detection of anti-PLA2R is a sensitive test for idiopathic MN.",

        "abstract": "We sought to identify the long-term renal survival rate and related risk factors of progression to renal failure in Chinese adult patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and to quantify the effects of proteinuria during the follow-up on outcome in patients with IgAN.Patients with biopsy-proven primary IgAN in the Nanjing Glomerulonephritis Registry were studied. Renal survival and the relationships between clinical parameters and renal outcomes were assessed.One thousand one hundred and fifty-five patients were enrolled in this study. The 10-, 15- and 20-year cumulative renal survival rates, calculated by Kaplan-Meier method, were 83, 74 and 64%, respectively. At the time of biopsy, proteinuria>1.0 g/day [hazard ratio (HR) 3.2, P<0.001], estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)<60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (HR 2.6, P<0.001), hypertension (HR 1.9, P<0.001), hypoproteinemia (HR 2.0, P<0.001) and hyperuricemia (HR 2.1, P<0.001) were the independent risk factors. Multivariate Cox analysis showed the time-average proteinuria (TA-P) during follow-up was the most important risk factor of renal failure. Patients with TA-P>1.0 g/day were associated with a 9.4-fold risk than patients with TA-P<1.0 g/day (P<0.001) and 46.5-fold risk than those with TA-P<0.5 g/day (P<0.001). Moreover, patients who achieved TA-P<0.5 g/day benefit much more than those with TA-P between 0.5 and 1.0 g/day (HR 13.1, P<0.001).Thirty-six percent of Chinese adult patients with IgAN progress to end stage renal disease within 20 years. Five clinical features-higher proteinuria, hypertension, impaired renal function, hypoproteinemia and hyperuricemia-are independent predictors of an unfavorable renal outcome. The basic goal of anti-proteinuric therapy for Chinese patients is to lower proteinuria<1.0 g/day and the optimal goal is to lower proteinuria to <0.5 g/day.",

Most patients with MN present with associated systemic diseases that need to be identified before appropriately diagnosing idiopathic MN. However, the cause and clinical characteristics of MN in Chinese patients have not been investigated.Case series.Patients with biopsy-proven MN at the Research Institute of Nephrology, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, China.The diagnosis of idiopathic and secondary MN was based on clinical, initial laboratory, and histological findings.390 patients with MN were identified from 1985 to 2005. Of 390 patients with MN, 124 (31.8%) had idiopathic MN and 266 had secondary MN (68.2%). Of patients with idiopathic MN, 75 (60.5%) were men and 49 (39.5%) were women. Mean age was 43.9 +/- 13.2 years (range, 14 to 78 years). Common presentations of idiopathic MN were 60.5% with proteinuria (39.5% of whom presented with nephrotic syndrome), 29.8% with hypertension, 17.7% with hematuria, and 0.8% with decreased kidney function. In patients with secondary MN, causes were autoimmune diseases (73.3%), infections (17.7%), tumors (4.5%), and drugs or toxins (4.5%). Systemic lupus erythematosus was the most common autoimmune disease (predominately in younger women). Hepatitis B predominated in younger men. Greater levels of proteinuria were found in patients who presented with drugs or toxins compared with patients with other secondary MNs (P < 0.05).Not all patients underwent all tests, particularly serum tumor markers, hepatitis C virus antibody, and hepatitis C virus RNA tests.Proteinuria was a common presentation in patients with idiopathic MN, which was predominately found in middle-aged to elderly men. Secondary MN was more common than idiopathic MN, and most secondary MN diagnoses were secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus and hepatitis B infection.",

        "abstract": "A novel two-photon excited fluorescent probe for cadmium (named as TPCd) was designed and synthesized utilizing a prodan (6-acetyl-2-methoxynaphthalene) derivative as the two-photon fluorophore and an o-phenylenediamine derivative as the Cd(2+) chelator, which possessed favorable photophysical properties and good water-solubility. The probe was designed with a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanism and thus was weakly fluorescent itself. After binding with Cd(2+) which blocked the PET process, the fluorescence intensity of the probe was enhanced by up to 15-fold under one-photon excitation (OPE) and 27-fold under two-photon excitation (TPE), respectively. The two-photon action cross-section (Φδ) of the TPCd-Cd complex at 740 nm reached 109 GM compared to 3.6 GM for free TPCd, indicating the promising prospect of the probe in two-photon application. TPCd chelated Cd(2+) with 1 : 1 stoichiometry, and the apparent dissociation constant (K(d)) was 6.1 × 10(-5) M for the one-photon mode and 7.2 × 10(-5) M for the two-photon mode. The probe responded to Cd(2+) over a wide linear range from 0.1 to 30 μM with a detection limit of 0.04 μM. High selectivity of the probe towards Cd(2+) was acquired in Tris-HCl/sodium phosphate buffer. The probe was pH-independent in the biologically relevant pH range and non-toxic to living cells at reasonable concentration levels, warranting its in vivo applications. Through two-photon microscopy imaging, the probe was successfully applied to detect Cd(2+) uptake in living HepG2 cells.",

This study was aimed at exploring the renoprotective effects of weight loss on patients with ORG.A total of 63 patients with renal biopsy-proven ORG had food and exercise intervention in the physician-supervised weight loss program and were divided into three groups on the basis of the percentage of weight change from baseline to follow-up: significant weight loss (>3% reduction in body mass index [BMI]), stable weight, or significant weight gain (>3% increase). Metabolic parameters and renal lesions were evaluated regularly for 2 years.After 6 months, 27 patients lost weight by 8.29 +/- 4.00%, with a mean decrease in proteinuria of 35.3%, whereas 24 months later, 27 patients achieved a 9.20 +/- 3.78% reduction in BMI and a 51.33% reduction in urine protein secretion. The levels of serum triglyceride, serum uric acid, and BP were also decreased. Contrarily, in patients with increased BMI, urine protein was increased by 28.78%. Correlation analysis showed proteinuria was associated with BMI, serum triglyceride, and uric acid, and multivariate regression analysis indicated the changes in BMI were the only predictor of proteinuria (P < 0.01).Weight loss intervention benefited remission of proteinuria in patients with ORG, whose function could not be replaced by conventional pharmacotherapy.",

Results:Fifty-three patients completed the study and entered into data analysis,15 in group A,19 in group B and 19 in group C.The mean APACHEII scores in each group were 16.2±3.65,17.11±3.5 and 17.01±4.79,respectively(P > 0.05).The filter survival time were(21.2±3.48 )h in group A,(25.1±5.50) h in group B,and(40.4±7.08) h in group C(P <0.01).There were 3 patients in each group of A(20%) and B(15.8%) switching to the anticoagulation protocol of group C due to fdter life span less than 8 hrs,4 patients in group B(21%) switching to group C due to bleeding,3 patients in group A(20%) and 4 patients in group C(21.1%) switching to group B due to citrate related complications. The percentage of patients with reduction of Hb and platelet counts levels was more than 30%,while no differences was found among 3 groups(P > 0.05 ).There were no differences in the CV VH duration,hospital days and ICU days and giving up or death rates between 3 groups.Conclusion:Compared with anticoagulation using only regional citrate or LMWH, regional citrate plus low dose of LMWH protocol was more efficacy in prolonging filter life span,without significant increase of anticoagulation-related complications.",

The clinical manifestations, pathologic features and immune pathologic changes in patients with positive ANCAs were compared with that in patients with negative ANCAs. The effects of immune suppressive therapy on clinic and pathologic changes as well as ANCAs activity were also investigated in ANCAs positive and ANCAs negative patients.Both of clinic active manifestations such as the degree of hematuria, rapidly progressive renal failure and pathologic active features including segmental capillary necrosis and vasculitis were much common in patients with positive ANCAs as compared with that in patients with negative ANCAs. The number of infiltrating cells in renal tissue, especially CD4+ cells, was markedly higher in ANCAs positive patients than that in ANCAs negative patients. The effects of immune suppressive therapy were also much better in patients with positive ANCAs than that in patients with negative ANCAs.Serum ANCAs is not only a marker for diagnosis of systemic vasculitis, but also a sensitive predictor for evaluation of diseases' activity and treatment in patients with PICGN. The good effect of immune suppressive treatments on patients with PICGN is partially associated with the degree of ANCAs activity.",

This paper introduces the methodologies adopted in the XPZ code, including the resonance treatment, equivalent homogenization, transport calculation, and burnup calculation. Emphasis is put on the treatment of the double heterogeneity effect, which involves the following two strategies. Firstly, the Dancoff factor obtained from the double-heterogeneous model is used in the resonance treatment. Secondly, with considering the spatially self-shielding effect in dispersed particles, the fuel compact is equivalently homogenized into a homogeneous media so that the conventional transport calculation can be applied. The effectiveness and accuracy of the methodologies are examined against Monte Carlo solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the XPZ code is promising for lattice physics computations in HTRs.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To analyze the demography,clinical features and hemodynamics in patients with different types of pulmonary arterial hypertension(PAH).Methods: We retrospectively studied 551 PAH patients who were treated at 31 medical centers in China from May 2007 to October 2010.The diagnosis was confirmed by right heart catheterization,and 386(70.1%) patients with female gender.According to the standard of American Heart Association,there were 4 types of PAH including idiopathic PAH(IPAH group),n=150,PAH associated with congenital heart disease(CHD-PAH group),n=273,PAH associated with connective tissue disease(CTD-PAH group),n=64,and chronic thromboembolic PAH(CTEPH),n=64.The demography,WHO functional classification(WHO-FC) and hemodynamics were collected and compared among different PAH groups.Results: CHD-PAH group had the largest number of patients(273/551,49.5%),with the youngest age and lowest BMI.While CTEPH group was opposite from CHD-PAH group in age and BMI,it had the highest ratio of female/male gender.Overall,fatigue(76.4%) and breathlessness(72.2%) were the most common symptoms in PAH patients.CTD-PAH group had the shortest 6 minutes walking distance(6MWD),and CHD-PAH group had the longest 6MWD.There were more patients with WHO-FC II in CHD-PAH group,and the mean pulmonary arterial pressure(mPAP),pulmonary vascular resistance(PVR) in CHD-PAH group was obviously higher than those in the other 3 groups,P < 0.01 respectively.Conclusion: With confirmed diagnosis,more IPAH patients were already at the severe condition.CHD-PAH was the most common type and it more happened in young and middle aged female gender,it had the highest mPAP and PVP,while rather good WHO-FC,which implies that the cardiac function may not be parallel to mPAP and PVR in those patients.",

        "abstract": "Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (Hipk2) has been shown to have important regulatory roles in cancer biology, such as cancer cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell invasion. However, the contributions of Hipk2 to bladder cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. In the current study, we assayed the expression level of Hipk2 in bladder cancer tissues by real-time PCR, and defined its biological functions. We found that Hipk2 levels were downregulated in most bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and Hipk2 levels were remarkably decreased in metastasized tumor tissues when compared with primary tumors. SiRNA-mediated Hipk2 silencing increased bladder cancer cell invasion. Hipk2 knockdown resulted in decrease of E-cadherin expression and increase of N-cadherin and fibronectin expression, indicated that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was induced. We further demonstrated that Hipk2 knockdown induced Wnt signaling activation and β-catenin nuclear localization. Finally, we confirmed that Hipk2 inhibition promoted EMT and subsequent cell invasion, at least in part by activating Wnt signaling. These data suggest an important role of Hipk2 in regulating metastasis of bladder cancer and implicate the potential application of Hipk2 in bladder cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "Objective:It is a common condition that diabetic nephropathy (DN) coincides with other non-diabetic renal disease. The renal biopsy should be necessary for diagnozing a patient with atypical feature. However,the optimal timing of observation and the safety after biopsy is not well established. The aim of this study was to investigate the significance and safety of renal biopsy in patients with DN. Methodology:A prospective observation was performed in one hundred and eleven cases with type 2 diabetes who received percutaneous renal biopsy. The complications were evaluated at 4 h,8 h,24 h,48 h and 72 h after biopsy by monitoring gross hematuria,flank pain,hypotension,hemoglobin and renal ultrasound examination. Results:We observed that 28 cases (25.2%) of biopsies complicated with hematoma. The size of hematoma was between 2-4 cm2 in 20 cases (18.0%),and 8 cases was larger than 4 cm2 (7.21%). There were 3 cases with symptomatic hematoma (2.7%). Among the 8 cases with large hematoma,3 cases with renal failure (SCr 114.9-152.9 μmol/L),and other 3 cases were coincidence with IgA nephropathy and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. The timing of large hematoma peaked in 4 h. We found that 11 cases (9.91%) had gross hematuria. Among them,4 cases with renal dysfunction (SCr 166.2-265.2 μmol/L) and other 5 cases were coincidence with IgA nephropathy and microscopic polyangitis. The hematoma and gross hematuria improved spontaneously without further intervention. In renal pathological diagnosis,there were 31 cases (27.9%) with nondiabetic renal disease including 20 cases of IgA nephropathy,8 membranous nephropathy,one membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis,one amyloidosis and one microscopic polyangitis. Conclusion:The main complications of renal biopsy in patients with DN were hematoma and gross hematuria. They mostly occurred within 8hrs,especially in 4hrs,and might improved spontaneously without intervention. DN patients with renal dysfunction,increased frequency of puncture and coincidence with IgA nephropathy and systemic vasculitis were risk factors after biopsy. To ensure the safety of the biopsy,the key point is to control the indication exactly,have a full examination before the operation,and improve the operative technique. In DN patients,renal biopsy is necessary for making diagnosis and treatment.",

        "abstract": "Manganese oxide-based cathodes are one of the most promising lithium-ion battery (LIB) cathode materials due to their cost-effectiveness, high discharge voltage plateau (above 4.0 V vs. Li/Li+), superior rate capability, and environmental benignity. However, these batteries using conventional LiPF6-based electrolytes suffer from Mn dissolution and poor cyclic capability at elevated temperature. In this paper, the ionic liquid (IL)-based electrolytes, consisting of 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfon)imidate (PYR1,4-TFSI), propylene carbonate (PC), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfon)imide (LiTFSI), and lithium oxalyldifluoroborate (LiDFOB) additive, were explored for improving the high temperature performance of the LiMn2O4 batteries. It was demonstrated that LiTFSI-ILs/PC electrolyte associated with LiDFOB addition possessed less Mn dissolution and Al corrosion at the elevated temperature in LiMn2O4/Li batteries. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy implied that this kind of electrolyte also contributed to the formation of a highly stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI), which was in accordance with the polarization measurement and the Li deposition morphology of the symmetric lithium metal cell, thus beneficial for improving the cycling performance of the LiMn2O4 batteries at the elevated temperature. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy implied that the cells using this kind of electrolyte exhibited better interfacial stability, which was further verified by the polarization measurement and the Li deposition morphology of the symmetric lithium metal cell, thus beneficial for improving the cycling performance of the LiMn2O4 batteries at the elevated temperature. These unique characteristics would endow this kind of electrolyte a very promising candidate for the manganese oxide-based batteries.",

Methodology:Thirty-seven female patients diagnosed class Ⅴ+Ⅳ LN (according to ISN/RPS 2003 classification criteria) were randomly assigned to either FK506 0.1 mg/(kg·d) for 6 months (n=19) or intravenous cyclophosphamide (CTX) 0.5-1.0 g/m~2 BSA monthly for 6 months (n=18) in addition to corticosteroids. The primary end point was complete remission (CR) at 6 months (defined as a value of proteinuria <0.4 g/24h with normal urinary sediment, serum albumin ≥3.5 g/dl and a normal value of serum creatinine or no more than 15% above the base-line values). A secondary end point was partial remission (PR) and remission at 6 months. Results:1) Clinical efficacy: 31 patients (K506 group=15, CTX group=16) completed the 6 months induction therapy. The remission occurred in 14 out of 15 patients in the FK506 group and 8 out of 16 patients in the CTX group (P=0.015). There were 4 patients (26.7%) in the FK506 group and 1 patient (6.3%) in the CTX group that achieved CR (P>0.05). The improvements in SLE-DAI, serum albumin and serum complement were similar in both groups, but there was no change of urine RBC and anti-dsDNA. The average proteinuria of post-treatment was significantly decreased in the FK506 group while with no improvement in the CTX group. 2) Dosage of FK506 and adverse effects: The inducement dosage of FK506 was 0.086~0.091 mg/(kg·d) and the average trough blood concentration was 6.6~8.1 ng/ml. No damage in the renal tubular function was found under this dosage. 5 patients dropped out because of adverse effects (2 in the CTX group, 3 in the FK506 group) and one had no follow-up in FK506 group. The adverse effects of infection, temporary GPT/GOT rise, upper gastrointestinal symptoms, leucopenia and irregular menstruation/amenorrhea were lower in the FK506 group than that in the CTX group, especially the adverse effects of irregular menstruation/ amenorrhea. In contrast, elevated blood pressure and hyperglycemia were higher in the FK506 group with no statistics significance.

        "abstract": "Studies on biopsy-proven renal disease in the elderly (age ≥65 years) are extremely limited in China. The aim of this study was to examine the spectrum of renal diseases and their clinical presentations in elderly patients undergoing renal biopsy.All native renal biopsies (n = 851) performed in patients aged ≥65 years from January 2003 to December 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. The results were compared with a control group of 28 574 patients aged 18-64 years undergoing renal biopsy over the same period.These 851 patients included 549 males and 302 females. Primary glomerular diseases (53.94%) occurred more frequently than secondary glomerular diseases (36.49%). The clinical manifestations were nephrotic syndrome (NS) in 29.49% of the patients, chronic renal failure in 24.68%, proteinuria and hematuria in 13.28%, proteinuria in 10.93%, acute kidney injury (AKI) in 10.81% and AKI and NS in 8.93%. Membranous nephropathy (MN) was the most frequent diagnosis (28.79%), followed by diabetic nephropathy (DN, 9.75%), IgA nephropathy (IgAN, 9.64%) and vasculitis (6.82%). When compared with the control group, the results showed that MN (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), DN (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), vasculitis (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) and amyloidosis (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) occurred more frequently and IgAN (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), lupus nephritis (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) and minimal change disease (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) occurred less frequently in the elderly.This study is the first and largest renal biopsy series to analyze patients aged ≥65 years in China, and the results obtained from this study may increase the knowledge of renal diseases in elderly patients.",

        "abstract": "Klotho is an anti-aging protein mainly expressed in the kidney. Reduced Klotho expression closely correlates with the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Klotho is also a downstream gene of Peroxisome Proliferation-Activated Receptor γ (PPARγ), a major transcription factor whose functions are significantly affected by post-translational modifications including acetylation. However, whether PPARγ acetylation regulates renal Klotho expression and function in CKD is unknown. Here we test whether renal damage and reduced Klotho expression in the adenine CKD mouse model can be attenuated by the pan histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A. This inhibition up-regulated Klotho mainly through an enhancement of PPARγ acetylation, stimulation of PPARγ binding to Klotho promoter, and PPARγ-dependent increase in Klotho transcription, with a substantial control of the regulation occurring via PPARγ acetylations on K240 and K265. Consistently trichostatin A-induced reversal of Klotho loss and renoprotective effects were abrogated in PPARγ knockout mice, supporting that PPARγ is an essential acetylation target for Klotho restoration and renal protection. Intriguingly, the kidneys of adenine-fed CKD mice displayed deregulated HDAC3 up-regulation. Selective HDAC3 inhibition effectively alleviated Klotho loss and kidney injury, whereas the protective effects were largely abolished when Klotho was knocked down by siRNA, suggesting that aberrant HDAC3 and Klotho loss are crucial components involved in the renal damage of mice with CKD. Our study identified an important signaling cascade and key components contributing to the pathogenesis of CKD. Thus, targeting Klotho loss by HDAC3 inhibition has promising therapeutic potential for the reduction of CKD progression.",

The results indicate that suitable boron addition effectively lowered the initial liquid-phase sintering temperature of the cermets, and a suitable boron addition contributed to the formation of homogenous and dense structure. As the result, the hardness, transverse rupture strength, and abrasion resistance of the Mo 2 FeB 2  cermets were significantly improved.

        "abstract": "Tubulointerstitial fibrosis impacts renal prognosis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Based on transcriptomic analysis, we found that the level of LOC105375913 was increased in tubular cells of FSGS patients. C3a induced the expression of LOC105375913, which promoted the expression of fibronectin and collagen I in tubular cells. Silence of snail reversed the level of fibronectin and collagen I in cells overexpressing LOC105375913. MiR-27b was predicted and confirmed to regulate the expression of snail in tubular cells, and LOC105375913 contained the response element of miR-27b. The competitive binding between LOC105375913 and miR-27b increased the level of snail and promoted fibrogenesis in tubular cells. Upstream, p38 and XBP-1s regulated the expression of LOC105375913. Inhibition of p38 or silence of XBP-1s decreased the level of LOC105375913, and suppressed the expression of snail, fibronectin and collagen I in tubular cells treated with C3a. Overexpression of LOC105375913 decreased the level of miR-27b, increased the level of snail and caused tubulointerstitial fibrosis in mice. In conclusion, the activation of C3a/p38/XBP-1s pathway induces the expression of LOC105375913 in tubular cells, and LOC105375913 increases the level of snail and induces tubulointerstitial fibrosis through competitive binding of miR-27b in tubular cells of FSGS patients.",

        "abstract": "It is widely accepted that the periodic cycle of hair follicles is controlled by the biological clock, but the molecular regulatory mechanisms of the hair follicle cycle have not been thoroughly studied. The secondary hair follicle of the cashmere goat is characterized by seasonal periodic changes throughout life. In the hair follicle cycle, the initiation of hair follicles is of great significance for hair follicle regeneration. To provide a reference for hair follicle research, our study compared differences in mRNA expression and microRNA expression during the growth and repose stages of cashmere goat skin samples. Through microRNA and mRNA association analysis, we found microRNAs and target genes that play major regulatory roles in hair follicle initiation. We further constructed an mRNA-microRNA interaction network and found that hair follicle initiation and development were related to MiR-195 and the genes CHP1, SMAD2, FZD6 and SIAH1.",

        "abstract": "Background. Alport syndrome (AS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous nephropathy. The goal of the present study is to delineate clinical characteristics and the distribution of type IV collagen chains in Chinese AS patients and to identify any α(IV)-chain expression and clinical phenotype correlation. Methods. A total of 126 biopsy-proven patients meeting immunofluorescence criteria for the diagnosis of AS were investigated retrospectively. Results. Microscope haematuria associated with proteinuria was observed as the initial symptom in 77.8% of the patients; 59.8% showed hearing impairment and 22.9% had ocular abnormalities. Renal biopsies from 118 patients revealed mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (61.9%) and focal and segmental sclerosis glomerulonephritis (37.3%). Ten different distribution patterns for the type IV collagen α-chains were found in the kidney; six of these are presented here for the first time. Based on renal immunofluorescence findings, 113 patients (89.7%) were classified as X-linked dominant inherited AS (XLAS) and 13 (10.3%) as autosomal recessive AS (ARAS). The XLAS group was divided into typical and non-typical subgroups according to the expression patterns for the α3(IV)-chain. Clinical phenotypes were more severe in XLAS patients than in ARAS patients and the prognosis was poorer in typical XLAS patients than non-typical XLAS patients. Conclusion. In China, the incidence of XLAS is 89.7% and 10.3% for ARAS. Chinese patients with AS have various distribution patterns of type IV collagen α-chains. The distribution pattern of type IV collagen α-chains in the kidney may correspond to the severity of the clinical phenotype. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",

The processes of iron-making by reduction smelting were investigated experimentally. The effects of mass ratio of carbon to oxygen together with slag binary basicity, smelting temperature and smelting time on the recoveries of iron and gold were evaluated, and the optimal conditions were determined. The results show that the optimal conditions are as follows: mass ratio of carbon to oxygen is 0.93, slag binary basicity is 1.0, smelting temperature is 1500°C and smelting time is 90 min. Under the optimal conditions, the recoveries of iron and gold reach 97.49% and 99.10%, respectively, and the composition of pig iron obtained is analyzed chemically to be as follows: gold 16 g/t, iron 97.27%, and carbon 1.38%. The gold content in the pig iron increases by about 0.63 times than that in the cinder.",

Methodology:Twenty-one patients with LN,who had a disease onset at the age of ≥50 years old,were enrolled in this study. 132 LN patients who had their disease onset before the age of 50 were recruited as controls. All patients had renal biopsy. The LN histological classifications were categorized according to 2003 ISN /RPS classification (Class I and VI were not included in the study). Their clinical and pathological features were analyzed and compared. Results:The female to male ratio was 6 to 1,smaller in the late-onset LN group compared with 7.3 to 1 in the control. The mean age of onset of SLE for late onset and the control groups were (54.8±5.40),ranged from 50 to 67 and (28.7±7.50) years old,ranged from 18 to 48). The patients with hypertension in late-onset LN were much more than that in control group. Class IV、V、IV+V were common in late-onset LN patients,however,the renal histological subtypes showed no significant difference between the two group. The incidence of extra renal manifestations: leukopenia were more common in late-onset LN patients. Immunological features: A-dsDNA antibody,anticardiolipin antibody,low serum C3 were more common in late-onset LN patients. Conclusion:Our data suggested that there be some differences about clinical manifestations between the late-onset LN and the control groups.",

        "abstract": "In this work, nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets serving as lithium storage materials are presented. The nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets were prepared by heat treatment of graphite oxide under an ammonia atmosphere at 800°C for 2 h. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed to characterize the prepared product as nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets with a doping level of ca. 2% nitrogen, where the N binding configuration of the graphene includes 57.4% pyridinic, 35.0% pyrrolic and 7.6% graphitic N atoms. Galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments revealed that these nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets exhibited a high reversible capacity (900 mA h g-1 at 42 mA g-1 (1/20 C)), excellent rate performance (250 mA h g-1 at a current density of 2.1 A g-1 (2.5 C)), and significantly enhanced cycling stability, which demonstrated nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets to be a promising candidate for anode materials in high rate lithium-ion batteries. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "The natural history of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) under treatment is about a gradual resolution of the thrombi, and uncommonly, the development of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). We hypothesized that ventilatory efficiency parameters during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) may be able to monitor the process and predict CTEPH.15 patients rehabilitated from acute PE (total resolution of thrombi), 44 patients with chronic PE (with residual thrombi), 66 patients with CTEPH, and 36 sedentary healthy controls performed incremental CPET.The lowest VE/VCO₂ was higher in CTEPH patients than that in chronic PE and rehabilitated patients (43.4 L/min vs 29.9 L/min vs 27.1 L/min, p&amp;lt;0.005). The VE/VCO₂ slope (48.4 L/min/L/min vs 29.9 L/min/L/min vs 28.0 L/min/L/min, p&amp;lt;0.005) and oxygen uptake efficiency plateau (OUEP) (37.1 L/min vs 27.0 L/min vs 25.2L/min, p&amp;lt;0.005) had the similar changes. In logistic regression analysis, the lowest VE/VCO₂ ≥ 34.35 L/min was the best predictor of CTEPH (OR 159.0, 95% CI 36.0-702.3, p&amp;lt;0.001). The lowest VE/VCO₂ was higher in chronic PE patients compared with the controls (29.9 L/min vs 26.5 L/min, p&amp;lt;0.05), but there was no difference between the rehabilitated patients and the controls. In multiple linear regression analysis, the percentage of vascular obstruction by ventilation-perfusion lung scanning (PVO) was the most significant independent predictor for indices of ventilatory efficiency in chronic PE and rehabilitated patients.CTEPH is associated with weakened ventilatory efficiency. The lowest VE/VCO₂ ratio has the best capability to predict CTEPH. Ventilatory inefficiency improves along with recovery of acute PE.",

        "abstract": "E-cadherin links to the cytoskeleton via catenins and mediates cell-cell homophilic adhesion. beta-catenin not only regulates cell-cell adhesion as a protein interacting with cadherin, but also functions as an important component of the Wnt signaling pathway which has been found to be closely associated with tumor formation. This study was performed to examine the expression of E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and cyclin D1 in breast cancer in order to evaluate their possible roles in the formation and progression of breast cancer.The alterations of E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and cyclin D1 in 60 cases of breast cancer were determined using highly sensitive SP immunohistochemical method.Normal immunoreactivity of E-cadherin and beta-catenin were observed in 29 (48.3%) and 18 (30.0%) cases, respectively. Twenty-eight cases (46.7%) showed cyclin D1 overexpression. Thirty percent (9/29) of the cases with normal staining of E-cadherin showed overexpression of cyclin D1, while 61.3%(19/31) of the cases showed overexpression of cyclin D1 with abnormal staining of E-cadherin. Abnormal expression of E-cadherin and overexpression of cyclin D1 showed a significantly positive correlation (rs=0.303,P< 0.05). Forty-two cases showed abnormal staining of beta-catenin. Cyclin D1 overexpression was observed in 57.1% (24/42) of these cases with abnormal staining of beta-catenin, but only observed in 22.2% (4/18) of these cases with normal membranous staining of beta-catenin. There was a significantly positive correlation between the abnormal expression of beta-catenin and overexpression of cyclin D1 (rs=0.321, P< 0.05).Down-regulation of E-cadherin and beta-catenin accumulation in the cytoplasm/nuclear may promote malignant transformation and progression by triggering cyclin D1 overexpression in breast cancer.",

This study aimed to investigate the significance of RDW for predicting survival in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome (ES).We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records and collected baseline data for patients newly diagnosed with ES in our hospital between January 2005 and October 2009. Follow-up data were collected periodically using a specifically designed network database until December 31, 2012. The end point was all-cause death.A total of 109 patients with ES were included in the study. Twenty-one patients (19.3%) died during a median follow-up period of 4.2 years (interquartile range 3.7-5.0 years). Baseline RDW was significantly correlated with mixed venous oxygen saturation (r=-0.286, p=0.003), arterial oxygen saturation (r=-0.423, p<0.001), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (r=0.271, p=0.004) and total pulmonary resistance (r=0.465, p<0.001). The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates for all 109 patients were 94%, 87% and 78%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with RDW ≥13.9% had a lower survival rate than patients with RDW <13.9% (p=0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that RDW was an independent prognostic marker in ES, with a hazard ratio of 1.162 (95% CI 1.036-1.302; p=0.010).Baseline RDW correlates with hemodynamics and is an independent prognostic marker in ES.",

        "abstract": "Wireless channels are increasingly being used to transmit highly sensitive information in the Internet of Things. However, traditional cryptography methods cannot solve all security problems in IoT systems. Covert wireless communication can prevent an adversary from knowing the existence of a useru0027s transmission; thus, it can provide stronger security protection for IoT devices. In this article, we consider the covert communication in a noisy wireless network, and find that the uncertainty of the aggregated interference experienced by the adversary is beneficial to the potential transmitters. From the network perspective, wireless communications can be hidden in the interference of the noisy wireless network, which the adversary observes as a shadow network to a certain extent. Furthermore, we discuss some new results on the effect of active eavesdropper. Square root law becomes invalid, and even jammer-assisted schemes have little effect on the covertness in the presence of active eavesdropper. Finally, we provide a vision for future research.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Idiopathic collapsing and cellular focal segmental glomerulosclerosis(FSGS) are actually different from other variants of FSGS due to their complicated pathogenesis.Collapsing FSGS has a more aggressive clinical course,with fewer remissions and worse prognosis.However,the relationship of collapsing and cellular FSGS in Chinese patients has not been investigated. Methodology:Four hundred eleven patients with biopsy-proven idiopathic FSGS were studied retrospectively.They were subdivided into five histological variants on the basis of the columbia FSGS classification: collapsing(COLL),cellular(CELL),classic(NOS),tip(GTL) and perihilar(PH).In this study,we compared the clinical and histological characteristics of patients between COLL and CELL variants. Results:(1)411 cases consisted of 4.9% COLL,8.5% CELL,36.9% NOS,38.7% GTL,and 11% PH.(2)COLL and CELL were predominately in youth.The median onset age of COLL and CELL patients was(23.6±5.96) and(28.9±15.0) years old.Mean time to biopsy were(22.2±61.0) and(25.1±54.3) months respectively.(3)Both COLL and CELL cases had massive proteinuria [(9.34±5.34)g/24h and(8.60±4.44)g/24h],while a higher ratio of patients with proteinuria ≥10 g/24h was present in COLL group(55.5%) as compared with CELL group(37.1%)(but without significant differences).The level of serum albumin [(18.2±4.06)g/L] in CELL was lower than that in COLL [(22.3±8.95)g/L](P<0.01).(4)Both the patients with COLL and CELL FSGS had severe damage of renal tubular function(the proportion of patients with higher urine NAG and RBP level were 95%,100% and 73.7%,85.3% respectively),had the same level of serum creatinine,the proportion of renal dysfunction,the same incidence of hypertension(30% and 22.9% respectively) and microscopic hematuria(50% and 45.7%).(5)There was no difference in the ratio of global glomerulosclerosis and segmental glomerulosclerosis in the two groups.The patients with COLL variant had more chronic tubular interstitial lesion and vascular lesion than that CELL variant [(55% vs 25.7%),(65% vs 37.1%)](P<0.05).There were 9 cases with COLL group(45%) accompanied with cellular lesion.(6)After received therapy by Tripterygium wilfordii(TW) or combined TW with steroid,the ratio of remission and renal function recovery with COLL and CELL were 64.3%,68.2% and 35.7%,40.9% respectively. Conclusion:The incidence of COLL and CELL was 4.9% and 8.5% in Chinese idiopathic FSGS.There were overlapping or common clinical and pathologic features between COLL and CELL variants.The therapy by TW or combined TW with steroid had higher ratio of remission in both FSGS subgroups.",

In this study, we investigated the effect of IA on serum anti-GBM level and evaluated its clinical efficacy in patients with Goodpasture's syndrome.Four patients with Goodpasture's syndrome were enrolled in this study. All patients presented with severe renal failure and needed hemodialysis. They were treated with staphylococcal protein A IA, together with intravenous pulse methylprednisolone therapy and mycophenolate mofetil (n=3) or intermittent intravenous cyclophosphamide (n=1). IA was administered for 10 cycles per session and 8-10 sessions as a course; a total of 30-60 L of plasma was regenerated in each course.Serum anti-GBM antibody level decreased to the normal range in 3 patients after 1 course of IA treatment and remained negative in 2 patients who were followed up for 4 months. In the other patient, serum anti-GBM antibody level decreased by 62.8% after the first course of IA treatment and decreased to the normal range after the second course of IA. Rebound of serum anti-GBM was found in all patients during the first 3 to 4 IA sessions. Pulmonary hemorrhage resolved in all patients, including 1 patient who was unresponsive to methylprednisolone pulse therapy. One of the 4 patients who required initial hemodialysis on admission could stop hemodialysis after IA, and the other 3 patients who had 100% glomerular crescents were on maintenance hemodialysis.IA could remove serum anti-GBM antibody and resolve pulmonary hemorrhage effectively; the efficacy of IA in improving renal function is markedly determined by the severity of renal damage.",

Conclusion:The T_(max) of MMF was increased significantly with the use of PPI,and the C_(max) of MMF showed some downward trend.However,PPI showed little effect on the pharmacokinetics of EC-MPS.MPA concentration should be detected early after transplantation in patients using MMF as immunosuppressant and the dose of MMF can be adjusted timely accordingly.",

        "abstract": "Podocytes are important to glomerular filtration barrier integrity and maintenance of size selectivity in protein filtration in the kidney. Although there is evidence to suggest that triptolide has direct protective effects on podocyte injuries, the mechanism mediating this process remains largely unexplored. In this study, we found triptolide suppresses podocyte p53 and GADD45B expression in vivo and in vitro. We used our previously developed in vivo zebrafish model of inducible podocyte-targeted injury and found that triptolide or the inhibition of p53 and gadd45ba with morpholino (MO) alleviated metronidazole (MTZ) induced edema in zebrafish, while the overexpression of gadd45ba in podocytes blocked the protective effect of triptolide and p53 MO on podocyte injury in zebrafish. Further study showed that p53 directly transactivated GADD45B. Triptolide inhibited p53 binding to the GADD45B promoter and subsequent GADD45B transcription. We further demonstrated that p53 may indirectly regulate GADD45B expression via NF-κB signaling. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that triptolide maintained glomerular barrier function via the inhibition of p53-NF-κB-GADD45B signaling, which provides a new understanding of the antiproteinuric effects of triptolide in glomerular diseases.",

Recent studies have revealed that the generation of HClO has close links with the wound healing process. It's thus meaningful to develop a reliable method for monitoring HClO in wounded tissues. Toward this purpose, we herein report a rationally designed quinolone-based ratiometric two-photon fluorescent probe, , for HClO. The probe  rapidly displays a drop in blue emission and an increase of green emission in response to HClO due to the oxidation of oxathiolane. The fluorescence intensity ratio (green/blue) can serve as the ratiometric detection signal for HClO with high sensitivity. After confirming its excellent sensing performance , the probe was validated by detecting exogenous and endogenous HClO in living cells. The probe was capable of monitoring HClO  in the wounded tissues of mice by two-photon microscopy, which demonstrated the production profile of HClO during the wound-healing process. This work affords a simple and reliable tool for the detection and imaging of HClO, which promises to find more applications in HClO-related biological and pathological studies.",

        "abstract": "IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is polyphormic in its clinical manifestation, course and prognosis. Patients with isolated IgA deposit in glomeruli tend to have a high incidence of macroscopic haematuria and carry a better prognosis. In contrast, patients with deposits of IgA and IgG and IgM have a higher incidence of nephrotic syndrome and hypertension. In parallel, patients with IgA and IgG and IgM tend to have more glomerulosclerosis and tubulointestitial lesions. Recently, the angiotensin converting enzytne (ACE) gene polymorphism and its association in disease risk provided interesting exploration leading us to speculate about a possible mechanism to explain the variation in the rate of progression of IgAN; although, the results are still controversial. The variability of plasma ACE concentration has been shown to be associated with an insertion/deletion polymorphism. The frequencies of ACE genotype in 177 Chinese patients with IgAN has been observed. We found that patients with IgAN showed a higher frequency of DD genotype than normal population. In contrast to the previous reports, we did not find any association between AGE genotype and the rate of progression of IgAN. As different genotypes of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) are also responsible for the circulating levels of IL-1ra, the polymorphism of IL-1ra gene has been analyzed in 100 IgAN patients. There was no significant difference in the frequency of IL1RN*2 allele between normal subjects and IgAN. However, patients with recurrent macroscopic haematuria showed a higher carriage rate of IL1RN*2. Hereditable factors, in combination with a number of recognized environmental risk factors, are important determinants of the pathogenesis and natural history of IgAN. The notion that the gene polymorphism might be responsible for the clinical features and progression of IgAN is both intriguing and provocative. The lessons from previous multiple small size studies have produced conflicting results illustrating the need for observation of large numbers of cases in further studies to verify these observed associations.",

The fabricated device shows excellent performance with a maximum responsivity (R v) of 15 kV/W and a minimal noise equivalent power (NEP) of 0.58 pW/Hz0.5 for 0.14 THz radiation at room temperature. We consider these excellent results as due to the design of asymmetric nanoantennas. From simulation, we show that indeed such nanoantennas can effectively enhance the local electric field induced by sub-THz radiation and thereby improve the detection response. The excellent results indicate that GaN HEMTs with nanoantennas are future competitive detectors for sub-THz and THz imaging applications.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Ngal and Kim-1 are recently-recognized biomarkers for acute injury of proximal tubular epithelial cells,and their up-regulation is observed in various renal injury.The present study is to investigate the feature of Ngal and Kim-1 expression in aristolochic acid-induced injury in tubular epithelial cells,and to clarify their roles in aristolochic acid-induced nephrotoxicity.Methodology:HK2 cells were treated with 20 μg/ml of aristolochic acid.The mRNA and protein expression of Ngal and Kim-1 were detected by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence.The secretion of Ngal and Kim-1 in the culture supernates was detected by ELISA.The release of(N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase)NAG was determined by colorimetry with para-nitrophenol.The alteration in cell cycle and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry.Results:The up-regulation of Ngal and Kim-1 mRNA occurred in 6-12 hours and 24-48 hours of aristolochic acid administration.In the culture supernates,the release of Ngal was temporarily but prominently increased at 12h after aristolochic acid administration,and the secretion of Kim-1 occurred later but more sustaining(24-48h),similar to the secretion of NAG.The dosage of aristolochic acid inducing Ngal and Kim-1 expression was different with the dosage inducing apoptosis.Conclusion:The increased expression and secretion of Ngal and Kim-1 is accompanied with aristolochic acid-induced tubular injury.Ngal is an early but temporary molecule induced by aristolochic acid,while Kim-1 and NAG appear later but more sustaining,so we believe Kim-1 and NAG are reliable markers for clinical identification of aristolochic acid-induced nephrotoxicity.The increased expression of Ngal and Kim-1 in aristolochic acid induced tubular injury may represent another important mechanism for aristolochic acid-induced nephrotoxicity and may provide new markers for early detection of aristolochic acid nephropathy.",

In the process, volatile rhenium oxides, such as ReO4 and Re2O7 , were vaporized under a controlled oxidizing atmosphere via the pyrolysis of ammonium perrhenate, and carried into reduction zone by carrier gas, and there reduced into rhenium powders by hydrogen gas. Thermodynamic calculations indicated that Re2O7 could be prevented from further decomposition through controlling the oxygen partial pressure higher than 10 1.248 Pa in the pyrolysis of ammonium perrhenate. This result was further validated via DSC TGA analysis of ammonium perrhenate. The typical rhenium powders prepared by the CVD method proposed show irregular polyhedron morphology with particle size in the range of 100 800nm and a D 50 of 308 nm. The specific surface area and oxygen content were measured to be 4.37m2/g and 0.45%, respectively.",

Methods:A total of 1,137 women of 15 to 59 years old selected from Huaqiaocheng community,Nanshan district of Shenzhen received a population-based cervical cancer screening between November 2004 and December 2004. All of the subjects were investigated by four approaches,including visual inspection with acetic acid(VIA),col- poscopy,hybrid captureⅡ(HC-Ⅱ)human papillomavirus(HPV)test and liquid-based cytology test(LCT).Subjects with abnormal or suspicious findings during colposcopy received biopsies.HPV-positive subjects with atypical squamous cells of undetermined sign(ASCUS)based on LCT or HPV-negative patients with low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion(LSIL)based on LCT had biopsies during colposcopy.The pathology results were used as gold standards to evaluate the four approaches for screening for cervical cancer.Results:A total of 122 biopsy specimens were obtained.Pathological examination found no cases of cervical cancer,3 cases of gradeⅢcervical intraepithelial neoplasia(CIN),11 cases of gradeⅡCIN,36 cases of gradeⅠCIN,69 cases of chronic cervicitis and metaplasia of squamous epithelium,and 3 cases of normal cervix.The HPV-positive rate was 14.0%by HC-II, the LCT-positive rate was 12.6%,the VIA-positive rate was 12.5%,and the colposcopy positive rate was 13.6%. The HPV-positive rate and LCT positive rate increased as the pathological grade of cervical lesions increased(P< 0.005).The sensitivity,specificity,accuracy,positive prevalue,negative prevalue,positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 100%,87.1%,87.3%,8.8%,100%,11.3 and 23.5%for HC-II HPV for detecting high grade cervical lesions;92.9%,88.4%,88.5%,9.1%,99.9%,8.0 and 8.0%for LCT;35.7%,96.0%,95.3%,10.0%, 99.2%,8.9,and 67.0%for VIA;and 50%,86.8%,86.4%,4.5%,99.3%,3.8,and 57.6%for colposcopy.Conclusion: HC-Ⅱhigh risk HPV detection and LCT are presently two promising approaches for cervical cancer screening. The sensitivity of VIA and colposcopy is lower for detecting high grade cervical lesions and is therefore not suitable for screening,but their specificity and negative prevalue are higher and readily applicable for clinical testing.",

A series of analytical equations are derived for non-linear rational function fitting as well as linear regression to measured device frequency response characteristics. The method is successfully applied to a set of fabricated RF LDMOSFETs with different geometry scales. As a result, all of the cut-off small-signal equivalent circuit elements are determined. Validation of the extraction method is verified by good agreement between the simulation results and the corresponding measurement data. In addition, reasonable physical meaningfulness of the method is further demonstrated by characterizing the device geometrical dependences of the extracted gate-drain capacitance (Cgd) and drain-source capacitance (Cds).",

This IPN-PDEC polymer electrolyte exhibited a decent ionic conductivity of 1.64 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature and a wide electrochemical stability window (up to 4.5 V vs. Li+/Li). The LiFePO4/IPN-PDEC/Li and LiFe0.2Mn0.8PO4/IPN-PDEC/Li cells delivered excellent rate capability and cycling performance at room temperature. An all solid state lithium battery was also demonstrated by applying the as-prepared solid polymer electrolyte (SPE-PDEC) at a temperature of 100 °C, which displayed a superior cycling performance. Therefore, the IPN-PDEC network is a promising polymer electrolyte for solid state lithium batteries.",

        "abstract": "Objective To explore the relationship of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene -675 4G/5G and β fibrinogen gene -455 G/A variations to glomerular microthrombosis (T) in lupus nephritis (LN). Methods One hundred and one patients with biopsy proven LN were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of glomerular microthrombus, i.e. group LN + T(n=46) and group LN - T(n = 55). The genotypes of PAI-1 gene and β fibrinogen gene were profiled by polymerase chain reaction-sequence length polymorphism (PCR-SLP) and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) respectively. Clinical baseline data at the time of renal biopsy were collected. Normal controls consisted of 128 unrelated healthy adults. The etiologic fractions (EF) were calculated for estimating the contribution of risk genotypes of the two candidate genes to an increase in susceptibility to glomerular microthrombosis in LN patients. Results Both the 4G/4G genotype and the 4G allele of PAI-1 gene occurred more frequently in group LN + T (47.83% and 0. 685) than in group LN - T (23.64% and 0.507)(P<0.05) and normal controls (28.13% and 0.570)(P<0.05). The PAI-1 4G/4G genotype was significantly associated with microthrombosis (OR = 2.96, 95%CI: 1.26 - 6.92). Besides, the prevalence of the genotypes carrying the A allele of β fibrinogen gene, i.e. G/A and A/A, as well as the prevalence of the A allele per se, was increased in group LN + T (47.83% and 0. 261) versus group LN - T (27.27% and 0.145) (P<0.05). LN patients carrying the A allele had a high risk of glomerular thrombosis (OR = 2.44, 95%CI: 0.98 - 5.59). In addition, the presence of the PAI-1 4G/4G genotype together with the A allele of the β fibrinogen gene was found to be a greater risk factor (OR = 4.5,95%CI:1.34 - 15.12) for glomerular thrombosis in LN than the 4 G / 4 G genotype or the A allele alone. The pooled EF (45.98%) for the risk genotypes of both PAI-1 gene and β fibrinogen gene was also higher than that for the risk genotypes of either gene (31.67% and 28.23%). Conclusion The above findings indicated that genetic variations in PAI-1 and β fibrinogen loci might represent risk factors for glomerular microthrombosis in LN. They may have synergetic impact and present gene dosage effect on the susceptibility to this pathological subphenotype.",

According to the kinetic c-t curve and pH-t curve, the process of dissolution and phase transformation can be divided into three stages: dissolution, transformation induce dissolution, and crystallization stage. The experimental results show that chloropinnoite dissolves incongruently in water. MgCl2 is removed first and then the midproduct(MgO·B2O3·4H2O) is formed. The final phase transformation product is inderite (2MgO·3B2O3·15H2O). The kinetic equations of dissolution and crystallization have been obtained. The kinetic mechanisms of dissolution and crystallization reactions have been confirmed according to order of reaction, activation energy and effect of stirring.",

        "abstract": "Determine the sensitivity and specificity of optical coherence tomography (OCT) as an adjunct to colposcopy in the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or higher in a real-time clinical evaluation.Optical coherence tomography (OCT) uses infrared light similar to ultrasound pulse-echo imaging. Image resolution is optimal in the 1-to-3-mm range. This study is the third in our series of OCT investigations and our first real-time clinical trial. The study was conducted at the Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, China.Nonpregnant women 18 years or older with abnormal cervical cytologic findings or a positive high-risk human papillomavirus test result were recruited. Women were assessed; and diagnoses, recorded by cervical quadrant first with colposcopy, followed by colposcopic directed OCT. A biopsy of the abnormal areas was performed. In normal quadrants, biopsy specimens were obtained at the 2-, 4-, 8-, and 10-o'clock positions at the squamocolumnar junction depending on the quadrant. An endocervical curettage was also done. Individual OCT diagnoses were paired with colposcopic impressions and biopsy specimens to assess its role as a paired secondary screen. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations to control for correlation within a woman.One thousand two hundred thirty-seven paired diagnoses from 299 women were analyzed. Median age was 36 years. Ninety-six women (8%) had a diagnosis of CIN 2 or higher. Evaluation by quadrant showed that the sensitivity for CIN 2 or higher decreased by adding OCT to colposcopy, but the specificity increased from 83% to 93%.We continue to try to improve sensitivity by improving the near-infrared light source, decreasing the scan time to 8 frames per second, and using a larger diameter (5 mm) fiberoptic probe with a newly designed application specific probe sheath.",

However, current IDO inhibitors are not approved for clinical use yet; therefore, new IDO inhibitors are still demanded. To identify new IDO inhibitors, we have built naive Bayesian (NB) and recursive partitioning (RP) models from a library of known IDO inhibitors derived from recent publications. Thirteen molecular fingerprints were used as descriptors for the models to predict IDO inhibitors. An in-house compound library was virtually screened using the best machine learning model, which resulted in 50 hits for further enzyme-based IDO inhibitory assays. Consequently, we identified three new IDO inhibitors with IC values of 1.30, 4.10, and 4.68 μM. These active compounds also showed IDO inhibitory activities in cell-based assays. The compounds belong to the tanshinone family, a typical scaffold family derived from Danshen (a Chinese herb), the dried root of , which has been widely used in China, Japan, the United States, and other European countries for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Thus, we discovered a new use for Danshen using machine learning methods. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments proved that the inhibitors interacted with the IDO target. Molecular dynamic simulations demonstrated the binding modes of the IDO inhibitors.",

The principle of PR in determining Ge content of a Si1-xGex epilayer is thoroughly described. The unambiguous E1 transition energy in the Si1-xGex epilayer is very useful to determine Ge content during PR analysis. R&R study with 10 repeats at the same point indicates that the measurements of PR are reproducible. These results demonstrate that PR is very promising for analysis of Si1-xGex epilayer characterization with constant Ge content.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To observe the effect of continuous high volume hemofiltration(CHVHF) on severe lung infection occurred in the early period after renal transplantation.Methodology:Sixteen patients were enrolled in this study with diagnosis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome(SIRS) due to lung infection within 6 months after allograft renal transplantation and received CHVHF immediately after onset of SIRS in addition to routine therapy.Concurrently,18 patients with the same conditions but not received CHVHF were chosen to serve as historic control.We observe the influence of CHVHF to mean arterial blood pressure,heart rate,temperature,PaO2 /FiO2,APACHE Ⅱ scores and inflammatory factors(C reactive protein,IL-6,IL-10).The white blood cell count and CD4 + /CD8 + T cell count were also observed in two groups.The comparisons between two groups were also performed on the number of patients requiring tracheal intubation,duration of intubation,occurrence rate of secondary infection and survival rate.Results:After the therapy of CHVHF,the patient's temperature decreased significantly during 48 hours,the average of artery blood pressure rose after 24 hours and PaO2 /FiO2 goes up after 72 hours.The index of APACHE Ⅱ after 48 hours and C reactive protein after 72 hours,IL-6 after 24 hours decreased obviously differently(P < 0.05).The white blood cell count and CD4 + /CD8 + T cell count decreased from the pre pneumonia,SIRS period to ARDS period,and increase from the 5th to the 10th day from the beginning of ARDS.The degree of CD4 + /CD8 + T cell decreasing in CHVHF group was less than that in control group(P < 0.05) and the degree of CD4 + /CD8 + T cell increasing in CHVHF group was higher than that in control group(P < 0.05).The proportion of patients requiring tracheal intubation was 43.8%(7 /16) in CHVHF group,and 44.4 %(8 /18) in control group.The mean duration for intubation was(7.14 ± 1.46) d in CHVHF group,and(10.6 ± 2.62) d in control group(P < 0.01).There were 2 patients complicated with secondary infection and one died in CHVHF group,with mortality rate 6.3%(1 /16).However,there were 7 patients complicated with secondary infection and 7 died in control group,with mortality rate 38.9%(7 /18)(P < 0.05).The survival of CHVHF group was better than that of control group(P = 0.01689).Conclusion:The temperature,MAP,PaO2 /FiO2 and the APACHE Ⅱ score improved greatly after CHVHF in pneumonia patient after allograft renal transplantation.The cytokines(CRP,IL-6,IL-10) decreased greatly through CHVHF.The white blood cell count and CD4 + /CD8 + T cell count recovered quickly in CHVHF group contrast to the control group.Therefore,the duration of mechanical ventilation was shorter in CHVHF group,which can decrease the secondary infection rate and improve patient survival.",

Particularly, owing to the presence of a unique plastic-crystalline phase, succinonitrile/salt-based solid electrolytes possess an ultra high ionic conductivity of more than 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. Herein, recent progress in nitrile-based polymer electrolytes has been reviewed in terms of their potential application in flexible, solid-state or high voltage lithium batteries. Factors affecting the ionic conductivity of nitrile-based electrolytes have also been summarized. We hope that fresh and established researchers can obtain a clear perspective of nitrile based polymer electrolytes and our mini review can spur more extensive interest for the exploration of high performance batteries.",

        "abstract": "Membranous nephropathy (MN) is the most common glomerular disease of post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Although this condition is now considered a renal complication of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), the pathogenesis of this disease is not well established.Five patients with post-HSCT MN diagnosed by renal biopsy were selected for this study. The clinical and renal pathological data of these patients were analyzed, and anti-PLA2R (M-type phospholipase A2 receptor) autoantibodies and IgG subclasses were detected in the serum samples from the patients.None of the 5 patients had a history of kidney disease. All the patients had a combination of cGVHD and proteinuria, which was in remission after an effective anti-graft-versus-host disease treatment. The immunofluorescent detection showed that IgG4 was the predominant IgG subclass, and the distribution of IgG4 was the same as that of nephrin. The anti-PLA2R autoantibodies were negative in 4 patients and positive in 1 patient. The levels of IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 increased in the majority of the patients.Our data showed that the clinical course of post-HSCT MN patients was closely related to that of cGVHD. Although the renal pathology was similar to idiopathic MN, the negative result for the anti-PLA2R autoantibodies in the majority of the patients suggested that the formation of an immune complex occurs differently between these 2 diseases.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To compare the efficacy of prednisolone with Leflunomide (LEF) or Tripterygium wilfordii (TW) for the maintenance treatment in patients with lupus nephritis (LN). Methodology:One hundred and twenty two patients with LN(WHO class Ⅱ 24,class Ⅲ 9,class IV 65,class V 24),females 116,and males 6 cases with the average age of (29.6±8.3) years old,who received the complete remission state after induction treatments,were enrolled in this study. They were divided randomly into the LEF group (a dosage of 50 mg/d orally for 3 days then 20 mg/d,n=61) or the TW group (a dosage of 60 mg/d,n=61) according to the WHO renal histological classes. All patients were also taken predinisone (10 mg/d). No difference in sex,age,classes of lupus nephritis and induction therapy was found between the two groups. The patients followed for 24 months were collected for the analysis of clinical efficacy. The primary efficacy parameter was percentage of relapse,the secondary evaluation included immunology parameters (A-ds-DNA,C3,C4),urinary proteinuria and renal function. The adverse effects were also recorded in the all patients. Results:19 patients were withdraw from the study (14 in LEF group,5 in TW group),103 patients (47 in LEF group,56 in TW group) were followed for 24 months. 7 cases (14.9%) in LEF group (renal relapse in 4,extra-renal relapse in 3) and 9 patients (16.1%) in TW group (renal relapse in 6,extra-renal relapse in 3) relapsed after the maintenance treatment for (9.9±5.5) months and (12.4±4.3) months respectively. The percentage of cases with serum anti-ds-DNA autoantibody was significantly decreased in the LEF group at the end of the study (46.8% vs 23.4%,P<0.05) while no significant decrement was found in the TW group (35.7% vs 26.8%,P>0.05). No differences were found in proteinuria,serum albumin and complement level between the two groups. The rate of skin rashes (14.8% vs 0,P<0.05) and alopecia (13.1% vs 0,P<0.05) were much higher in LEF group than that in the TW group,while amenorrhea rate was much higher in the TW group than that in LEF group (58.1% vs 5.6%,P<0.01). Other adverse effects in the LEF group and TW group included elevation of hepatic enzyme (6.6% and 6.6%),diarrhea (4.9% and 0),leukocyteopenia (4.9% and 1.6%),myalgia (3.3% and 0) and infection (3.3% and 3.3%). Conclusion:LEF and TW showed no differences in the relapse rate during the 24 months follow-up period. LEF could be used as a maintenance therapy for patients with lupus nephritis,but allergy reactions and other adverse effects should be monitored during the treatment.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in the fibrinogen A alpha-chain gene are the most common cause of hereditary renal amyloidosis in the United Kingdom. Previous reports of fibrinogen A alpha-chain amyloidosis have been in isolated kindreds, usually in the context of a novel amyloidogenic mutation. Here, we describe 71 patients with fibrinogen amyloidosis, who were prospectively studied at the UK National Amyloidosis Centre. Median age at presentation was 58 yr, and renal involvement led to diagnosis in all cases. Even after a median follow-up of 4 yr, clinically significant extra-renal disease was rare. Renal histology was characteristic: striking glomerular enlargement with almost complete obliteration of the normal architecture by amyloid deposition and little or no vascular or interstitial amyloid. We discovered four amyloidogenic mutations in fibrinogen (P552H, E540V, T538K, and T525fs). A family history of renal disease was frequently absent. Median time from presentation to ESRD was 4.6 yr, and the estimated median patient survival from presentation was 15.2 yr. Among 44 patients who reached ESRD, median survival was 9.3 yr. Twelve renal transplants survived for a median of 6.0 (0-12.2) yr. Seven grafts had failed after median follow up from transplantation of 5.8 yr, including three from recurrent amyloid after 5.8, 6.0, and 7.4 yr; three grafts failed immediately for surgical reasons and one failed from transplant glomerulopathy after 5.8 yr with no histological evidence of amyloid. At censor, the longest surviving graft was 12.2 yr. In summary, fibrinogen amyloidosis is predominantly a renal disease characterized by variable penetrance, distinctive histological appearance, proteinuria, and progressive renal impairment. Survival is markedly better than observed with systemic AL amyloidosis, and outcomes with renal replacement therapy are comparable to those for age-matched individuals with nondiabetic renal disease.",

No location data of eavesdropper is available, meanwhile no constraint on the figures of eavesdroppers is posited. A cooperative jamming approach is introduced for jamming the eavesdroppers any location in the system, even through the eavesdroppers are established quite adjacent to the sender or the receiver. The main ideas behind the strategy are to jam eavesdroppers by a divide and conquer strategy, and apply the advantageous jamming signal which is generated from the sender or the receiver to solve the problem of adjacent eavesdropper. evaluation and simulation consequences expose that cooperative jamming has the ability to improve the secure performance, and it can be employed to establish initial connections in wireless networks.",

        "title": "Podocyte autophagic activity plays a protective role in renal injury and delays the progression of podocytopathies.",
        "abstract": "The progression of podocytopathies is quite variable among patients and the underlying reason for this remains unclear. Here, we report that autophagic activity in podocytes plays a critical role in controlling the progression of podocytopathies. Morphological and biochemical studies on renal biopsies from patients with minimal change disease (MCD) or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) showed that glomeruli, and in particular podocytes, from MCD patients had higher levels of Beclin1-mediated autophagic activity than glomeruli from FSGS patients. Repeat renal biopsies of MCD patients enabled tracking of podocyte autophagic activity and confirmed that patients maintaining high podocyte autophagic activity retained MCD status, whereas patients with decreased podocyte autophagic activity progressed to FSGS. Inhibition of autophagic activity, by knocking down Beclin1 or by treating with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or chloroquine, enhanced puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced apoptosis of podocytes. In contrast, rapamycin-mediated promotion of autophagic activity decreased this apoptosis. In PAN-treated rats, inhibition of autophagy with 3-MA or chloroquine resulted in earlier onset and greater proteinuria, more extensive foot-process effacement, and reduction in podocyte markers, whereas rapamycin-mediated stimulation of autophagy led to decreased proteinuria and less severe foot-process effacement, but higher expression of podocyte markers. This study demonstrates that podocyte autophagic activity plays a critical protective role in renal injury and that maintaining podocyte autophagic activity represents a potential therapeutic strategy for controlling the progression of podocytopathies.",

Methods:A total of 223 consecutive patients with chronic heart failure treated in our hospital from November 2003 to August 2008 were retrospectively analyzed.There were 83/223(37.2%) patients suffered from central sleep apnea(CSA) and 77/223 (34.5%) suffered from obstructive sleep apnea(OSA).The patients mean age was 56.5±12.3 years.Plasma concentrations of NT-proBNP and SAA were measured using enzyme immunoassay,and the grade of heart failure was evaluated by NYHA standard. Results:There were 160 heart failure patients(160/223,71.75%) combined with SA.Multiple regression analysis indicated that plasma NT-proBNP and SAA associated with CSA and OSA in heart failure patients(P=0.012 and P=0.021,respectively). In CAS patients with NYHAⅡandⅢgrade of heart failure,plasma concentration of NT-proBNP was higher than those without CSA(P<0.05). Conclusion:Plasma NT-proBNP level was associated in heart failure patients combined with CSA,plasma SAA level was associated in heart failure patients combined with OSA.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis(FSGS) is a common type of adult glomerular disease which manifest nephrotic proteinuria and progress to chronic renal failure.Although several therapeutic regimens have been used on FSGS,the results were unsatisfied.It has been reported that high-dose prednisone and long-range therapy(6-month or longer) may be effective.But the total remission rates were only about 50%.However,the side-effects of this therapy should be paid attention.In this study,we conducted a single-center prospective non-randomized trial to investigate the therapeutic effecy of oral prednisone therapy for adult patients with FSGS.Methodology:(1) Patient criteria:age 18～60 years;biopsy proven FSGS;SCr<265.2 μmol/L;eGFR>30 ml/min per 1.73 m2,urine protein>3.5 g/24h,and serum albumin≤30 g/L.The secondary FSGS was excluded.(2)Therapeutic regimens:In the initial 8 weeks,the prednisone was full-dose of 1mg/kg BW/day(Max 60 mg/day).If the patients were complete remission at the 8th week,the prednisone should be tapered gradually;if the patients were partial remission,the prednisone extended to 10th week,and then tapered.(3)Evaluation:CR(proteinuria<0.4 g/24h,serum albumin≥35 g/L and normal value of SCr),and PR(proteinuria<3.5 g/24h and declined > 50% of baseline with stable kidney function).Results:(1) Thirty-one patients,twenty-two males and nine females,with age 18～47 years old,were enrolled this study.(2) At the prednisone tapering time which was the 8th week,26 patients(83.9%) had the total remission.Among them,8 patients(25.8%) had CR,18 patients(58.1%) PR,and 5 patients(16.1%) had NR.At the 10th week,the total remission rate was also 83.9%,just 1 case transformed from PR to CR,5 cases(16.1%) had still NR.(3)The total remission rate in initial treatment was higher than that in non-initial patients'(94.8% vs 66.7%,P<0.05).The urine RBP positive rate in CR patients' was lower than that in PR patients'(25.0% vs 83.3%,P<0.01) and NR patients'(25.0% vs 100%,P<0.01).The CR rate in ARF was lower than that in non-ARF patients'(0% vs 36.4%,P<0.05).(4)Complications and adverse effects:9 cases(29.0%) had an increase level of serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase(over twice normal value),5(16.1%) Cushing's syndrome,5(16.1%) infection,one(3.2%) steroid-induced diabetes,and one(3.2%) had an increase level of SCr(97.2 to 172.3 μmol/L).Conclusion:Oral full-dose prednisone alone(8-weeks therapy) is effective for the treatment of adult patients with FSGS.However,the CR rate was not high(25.8%) and adverse effects were serious.And the relapse after the stop of the therapy should be further observed and discussed in the following studies.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between codon 54 gene polymorphism of the host defense molecule, mannose-binding protein (MBP), and the patterns of glomerular immune deposition in IgA nephropathy (IgAN).IgAN patients with different patterns of glomerular immune deposition were selected and divided into two groups. Group A consisted of 77 patients with glomerular IgA and C3 deposits, and Group AGM consisted of 70 patients with glomerular IgA, IgG, IgM, C3 and Clq deposits. Clinical features and laboratory relevant data of all patients were collected. One-hundred and forty healthy adults were recruited as normal controls. The MBP gene codon 54 GGC/GAC polymorphism was investigated by using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism.The genotype frequency of GGC/GAC heterozygotes was significantly higher in Group AGM as compared with that of Group A (41.4% vs 19.5%, P < 0.01) or normal subjects (41.4% vs. 26.4%, P < 0.05), while no difference was found in the distribution of MBP genotypes between Group A and normal subjects. GAC allele frequency was also higher in Group AGM than that in Group A (0.24 vs. 0.14, P < 0.05) or normal subjects (0.24 vs. 0.15, P < 0.05). The variant allele (GAC) was markedly associated with Group AGM (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.06 - 3.58). In both Group A and Group AGM, more patients carrying the variant allele had episodes of upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infections prior to the onset of IgAN than those with wild homozygotes (GGC/GGC).Genetic variation of the host defense molecule, MBP, may be involved in the formation of the diverse patterns of glomerular immune deposition in IgAN. The variant allele of the MBP gene may partially account for abundant immune deposits in some IgAN patients.",

        "abstract": "A decreased platelet count may occur and portend a worse outcome in patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). We aim to investigate the incidence of decreased platelet count and related risk factors in patients receiving CRRT.In this retrospective study, we screened all patients receiving continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) at Jinling Hospital between November 2008 and October 2012. The patients were included who received uninterrupted CVVH for more than 72 h and had records of blood test for 4 consecutive days after ruling out pre-existing conditions that may affect the platelet count. Platelet counts before and during CVVH, illness severity, CVVH settings, and outcomes were analyzed.The study included 125 patients. During the 3-day CVVH, 44.8% and 16% patients had a mild decline (20-49.9%) and severe decline (≥ 50%) in the platelet count,respectively; 37.6% and 16.0% patients had mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 50.1-100 × 109/L) and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count ≤ 50 × 10(9)/L), respectively. Patients with a severe decline in the platelet count had a significantly lower survival rate than patients without a severe decline in the platelet count (35.0% versus 59.0%, P=0.012), while patients with severe thrombocytopenia had a survival rate similar to those without severe thrombocytopenia (45.0% versus 57.1%, P=0.308). Female gender, older age, and longer course of the disease were independent risk factors for a severe decline in the platelet count.A decline in the platelet count and thrombocytopenia are quite common in patients receiving CVVH. The severity of the decline in the platelet count rather than the absolute count during CVVH may be associated with hospital mortality. Knowing the risk factors for a severe decline in the platelet count may allow physicians to prevent such an outcome.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To explore the clinical features and hemodynamics of adult patients with Eisenmenger syndrome in different types of congenital heart diseases (CHD). Methods: Patients with Eisenmenger syndrome with different types of CHD diagnosed by right heart catheterization were enrolled from 31 clinical centers in China during the period from May 2007 to October 2010. Age, gender, body mass index (BMI), symptoms and signs, World Health Organization functional class (WHO-FC) of pulmonary hypertension, six-minute walk distance (6MWD) and hemodynamics were recorded. All the above indices were analyzed and compared. Results: A total of 224 patients with Eisenmenger syndrome with 3 kinds of CHD were enrolled, including atrial septal defect (n =67), ventricular septal defect (n = 104) and patent ductus arteriosus (n =53). Among them, there were 67 males (29.9%) and 157 females (70.1%) with a mean age of (29.6 ±9.9) years (range: 15-63). Mean BMI was (19.9 ±4.0) kg/m2 and mean 6MWD (371 ±75) m. The majority of patients were in WHO-FC II (n = 158, 70.5%) and III (n = 64, 28.6%). Electrocardiogram of 11.2% of them indicated hypertrophic right ventricle. Mean right atrial pressure was (8.9 ±5.7) mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) (77.2 ± 19.1) mm Hg, cardiac index (3.03 ± 1.35) L · min-1 · m-2 and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (1621 ±887) dyn · s · cm-5. Conclusions: The majority of patients with Eisenmenger syndrome with different types of CHD are young females and ventricular septal defect is the most frequent underlying cause. The deterioration of heart function in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome is non-parallel to mPAP and PVR in CHD. Copyright © 2013 by the Chinese Medical Association.",

        "abstract": "Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is a renal disease characterized by thrombus-like lipoproteins in the glomerular capillaries and its abnormal lipoprotein profiles with marked elevation of apolipoprotein E (apoE). In this study, 15 Chinese patients with LPG were involed in exploring the association of the genetic variation and its plasma level in the pathogenesis of LPG.A retrospective analysis of the clinical and pathological features was made in 15 patients with LPG. Plasma concentrations of apoE were measured with radial immunodiffusion assay. Genetic variations of apoE gene were detected using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Glomerular deposition of apoA, apoB and apoE in these patients were detected by immunofluorescence staining using monoclonal antibodies.Biochemical profiles of lipids and lipoproteins revealed markedly elevated levels of triglyceride, apoB and apoE, but approximately normal levels of total cholesterol, apoA1 and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], which resembled familial hypertriglyceridemia. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the genotype distribution of apoE were 7 cases with epsilon3/epsilon4, 4 cases with epsilon3/epsilon3 and 2 cases with epsilon2/epsilon3. The other 2 cases (a mother and her son) showed a same distinct band. The band pattern of later 2 cases was quite similar to the apoE variant of Tokyo type. The calculated allele frequency of epsilon 4 was relatively high in cases with LPG in comparison with that in the normal controls. We further divided the 13 patients into three groups according to their genotypes of apoE. Patients with the genotype of apoE epsilon2/epsilon3 showed a lower level of plasma apoE as compared to those with apoE epsilon3/epsilon4 (P < 0.05). The serum level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was the lowest in patients with the genotype of apoE epsilon3/epsilon4. No difference was found among the patients with different apoE genotype in the other clinical and pathological characteristics.The genotype of apoE epsilon3/epsilon4 is the predominant one in Chinese patients with LPG. Patients with this genotype tend to have a higher plasma level of apoE and more severe lipid dysmetabolism. No correlation was found between the genotype of apoE and the clinical features in patients with LPG.",

The diagnosis of IMN was made with exclusion of secondary forms of membranous nephropathy by extensive clinical and pathological studies. No patients received steroids or cytotoxic agents for six months prior to enrollment. In the CSA group, CSA was given at an initial dosage of 5 mg.kg-1.d-1, gradually tailed off over the first three months and maintained at 2 mg.kg-1.d-1 for 12 months. In the CAP group, CAP was given at a dosage of 37.5 mg/day.In the first three months, 6 (6/15) complete remissions (CR) and 2 (2/15) partial remissions (PR) were observed in the CSA group while only 2 (2/15) PRs were observed in the CAP group. Before the end of the 15-months, 8 patients in the CSA group experienced CR and 4 patients experienced PR. One CR patient relapsed as the dosage of CSA was reduced, so 7 patients remained in CR at the end of the first 15-months. No additional CR or PR was observed in the CAP group during late follow-up. At the last visit (an average follow-up time of 44 months) in the CSA-group, another 2 CR patients had relapsed and 1 CR patient shifted to PR after stopping the CSA treatment, so 4 CR and 5 PR remained in the CSA group. In the CAP group, 3 spontaneous CRs occurred beyond 1.5 year's follow-up, with 3 CR and 2 PR at the last visit. No difference was found between the averages of the initial and the last serum creatinine levels in either group. No serious adverse effects were found during CSA treatment. Re-biopsy data of three patients responsive to CSA treatment showed that no pathological improvement of glomerular basement membrane was observed, even in cases at remission. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis was found in 1 relapsed CR patient, whose serum creatinine increased above the normal range, but not in the other 2 patients whose serum creatinine remained in the normal range.CSA therapy at a dosage of 5 mg.kg-1.d-1 is effective in inducing remission of nephrotic syndrome in adult IMN patients within three months, with a response rate of 80%. A relatively high rate of relapse (50%) was observed within 2 years after the withdrawal of CSA treatment.",

The expression of GLUT1 mRNA was detected by Northern blotting; the ability of glucose uptake was determined by 2-deoxy-[3H]-D-glucose uptake assay.Rhein had no effect on glucose uptake in mesangial cells cultured in normal glucose concentration. TGF-beta 1 could upregulate the expression of GLUT1 mRNA and glucose uptake in mesangial cells. This effect was markedly attenuated by the addition of rhein in a dose dependent manner.TGF-beta 1 could upregulate the expression of GLUT1 mRNA and glucose uptake in mesangial cells, resulting in excessive glucose consumption and extracellular matrix production in diabetic nephropathy. Rhein antagonized the effect of TGF-beta 1 in mesangial cells, so it might be a hopeful remedy for the treatment of patients with diabetic nephropathy.",

        "abstract": "High-voltage lithium batteries have attracted increasing attention for large scale energy storage application in electric vehicles, smart grids and other electronic devices. However, a major bottleneck to achieve high-voltage lithium batteries is the anodic voltage stability of electrolytes. Herein, we fabricate a composite polymer electrolyte, comprised of poly(methylethyl α-cyanoacrylate), nonwoven polytetrafluoroethylene and lithium bis(oxalate)borate salt. The composite polymer electrolyte presents a wide electrochemical window, which is explored to address the above-mentioned bottleneck. It is demonstrated that such a composite polymer electrolyte exhibits a higher ionic conductivity (1.24 mS cm−1 at 25 °C), better dimensional thermal resistance (150 °C) and higher ion transference number (0.63) compared to those of commercially available liquid electrolytes with a polypropylene separator. In addition, LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li batteries employing such a composite polymer electrolyte deliver excellent cycling performance and outstanding rate capability. So, it is demonstrated that the poly(methylethyl α-cyanoacrylate) based polymer electrolyte appears to be a promising candidate of high-voltage lithium battery electrolyte towards next generation high energy density batteries.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To observe early postoperative renal function changes and its influence factors in living-related kidney donors. Methodology: Thirty four cases of living-related kidney donors were enrolled in this study. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease ( MDRD) formulae,the GFR of both kidneys was detected using emission computed tomography (ECT) equipment and eGFR of each kidney before surgery was estimated in proportion. The changes of eGFR and compensatory rate of the retained kidney in the first month after donor nephrectomy were observed,and at the same time the influence factors eg,sex,age, body mass index ( BMI) and preoperative eGFRwere exanimated. The endpoint of the study was one month post surgery. Results: The eGFR of the retained kidney increased gradually and reached a peak at 4 days after surgery. The average eGFR increased from 72. 4 ml / ( min·1. 73m2 ) before surgery to 88. 1 ml/( min·1. 73m2 ) at the endpoint with the average compensatory rate of 21. 6% . The eGFR of the male group increased from 64. 5 ml / ( min ·1. 73m2 ) to 80. 5 ml / ( min·1. 73m2 ) ,with the compensatory rate of 24. 8%,and the female group from 76. 7 ml/( min·1. 73m2 ) to 92. 2 ml/( min·1. 73m2 ) ,with the compensatory rate of 20. 2%. For donors over the age of 50,the eGFR increased from 72. 8 ml / ( min·1. 73m2 ) to 81. 66 ml/( min·1. 73m2 ) and the compensatory rate was 12. 14%,and for doners less than 50 years old the eGFR increased from 72. 2 ml / ( min·1. 73m2 ) to 91. 5 ml/( min·1. 73m2 ) with the compensatory rate of 26. 8%.For doners eGFR above 60 ml/( min·1. 73m2 ) before surgery,the average eGFR increased from 81. 9 ml/( min·1. 73m2 ) to 95. 4 ml/( min·1. 73m2 ) with the compensatory rate of 16. 4%,and for doners eGFR below 60 ml/( min·1. 73m2 ) increased from 54. 9 ml / ( min·1. 73m2 ) to 74. 6 ml/( min·1. 73m2 ) ,with the compensatory rate of 35. 8%. For doners BMI above 23. 0 kg/m2 before surgery,the average eGFR increased from 67. 2 ml/( min·1. 73m2 ) to 84. 4 ml/( min·1. 73m2 ) , with the compensatory rate of 25. 6% ,and the eGFR of donors with a presurgry BMI below 23. 0 kg/m2 increased from 76. 5 ml/( min·1. 73m2 ) to 90. 9 ml/( min·1. 73m2 ) ,with the compensatory rate of 18. 9%. Conclusion: The eGFR of the retained kidney increased significantly after surgery. The; gender,age and preoperative eGFR were important influence factors on the renal recovery of the retained kidney after nephrectomy. The compensatory rate between male and female donors was similar while male donors had a lower preoperative eGFR. Donors over the age of 50 had lower compensatory rate and donors with lower preoperative eGFR and higher BMI always had higher compensatory rate.",

Methods :HC-Ⅱ HPV and LCT were performed in 2 471 women treated in Shenzhen Hospital of Peking University from May 2003 to Dec.2005.The women with abnormal or suspicious finding on colposcopy received biopsy.Both women with HPV-positive and women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined sign(ASCUS) received biopsy under colposcopy.Both women with HPV-negative or HPV-positive and women with LCT equal to low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion(LSIL) or higher than LSIL also received biopsy under colposcopy. All biopsy in specimens were examined by pathology.HC Ⅱ HPV and LCT were performed by double blind method.The pathology results were the final diagnosis to evaluate the value of each approach for screening cervical cancer. Results :A total of 287 patients received biopsy in this study.Of the 287 patients,6 had cervical cancer,18 had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia CINⅢ,39 had CINⅡ,98 had CINⅠ,126 had other diseases(chronic cervititis and metaplasia).HPV-positive rate and LCT-positive rate were 16.8% and 11.8%,respectively.The positive rate of HPV combined with LCT was 21.2% in parallel test and 7.4% in serial test.The HPV-positive rate and LCT positive rate increased with cervical lesions grade increased(P <0.005).The sensitivity,specificity,accuracy,positive prevalue,negative prevalue,positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio of HC-Ⅱ HPV for detecting high-grade cervical lesions were 98.4%,85.3%,85.6%,14.9%,100%,6.7 and 0.02,respectively;The values for LCT were 92.1%,90.3%,90.3%,19.9%,100.0%,9.5 and 0.09,respectively;The values for HPV-LCT parallel test were 100.0%,80.8%,81.3%,12.0%,100%,5.2 and 0.0,respectively;The values for HPV-LCT serial test were 90.5%,94.8%,94.7%,31.1%,99.7%,17.4 and 0.10,respectively.The areas of under receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curves in each screening test for screening high-grade cervical lesions were 0.919,0.921,0.904 and 0.926,respectively.There were no significant differences between screening tests(P >0.05). Conclusions :Both HC-Ⅱ HPV test and LCT are valuable for screening cervical cancer at present.The combination of HC Ⅱ HPV and LCT cannot improve significantly the detection rate of cervical cancer screening,but may increase the cost of cervical cancer single screening.",

        "abstract": "To study the significance and distribution of renal infiltrating cells, including monocytes (CD68+ cells), proliferative cell nuclear antigen positive cells (PCNA+ cells), CD4+ and CD8+ cells in diffuse crescent glomerulonephritis (DCGN).Fifty-six patients with DCGN were studied, including 10 cases of anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM)--type I DCGN, 26 immune complex--type II DCGN, and 20 cases of pauci-immune--type III DCGN. Glomerular and interstitial infiltrates of CD68+ and PCNA+ cells, and interstitial infiltrates of CD4+ and CD8+ cells were detected by using four-layer PAP methods.There was a significant increase of renal infiltrating CD68+, PCNA+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells in patients with DCGN compared with that in normal controls. In patients with type I DCGN, there was a higher number of renal infiltrating CD68+ and PCNA+ cells than that in patients with type II and III DCGN. A glomerular infiltrates of CD68+ and PCNA+ cells correlated with the interstitial infiltrates of CD4+ cells in type I or III DCGN patients. In lupus DCGN patients, the numbers of renal infiltrating CD68+ and PCNA+ cells were similar to vasculitis or type III DCGN patients.These findings demonstrate that the renal infiltrates of CD68+ and PCNA+ cells play an important role in patients with DCGN, that the infiltrates of CD4+ cells correlate with the infiltrates of CD68+ and PCNA+ cells may be an active marker of DCGN, and that cell-mediated immunity may contribute to crescent formation in lupus DCGN patients.",

Rutherford backscattering/ion channeling (RBS/C), high resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD), Raman spectra as well as atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to characterize these SiGe films. Investigations by RBS/C as well as HRXRD demonstrate that these thin Si0.8Ge0.2 films could indeed epitaxially grow on the Ar+ ion implantation Si substrates. Under low dose (1 × 1014 cm-2) and medium dose (5 × 1014 cm-2) implantation conditions, the relaxation extents of SiGe films are 60.6% and 63.6%, respectively. However, high dose implantation (3 × 1015 cm-2) prompt the strain in epitaxial SiGe film to be close to full relaxation status (relaxation extent of 96.6%). On the other hand, determinations of RBS/C also indicate the crystalline quality of SiGe film grown on high dose implantation Si substrate is nearly identical to that grown on low dose (1 × 1014 cm-2) implantation Si substrate.",

The as-prepared MoN/N-C nanospheres manifest considerable electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction in nonaqueous electrolytes because of its nanostructure and the synergetic effect between MoN and N-C. Furthermore, the MoN/N-C nanospheres are explored as cathode catalyst for Li-O2 batteries with tetra-(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether as the electrolyte. The assembled batteries deliver alleviated overpotentials and improved battery lifespan, and their excellent performances should be attributed to the unique hierarchical structure and high fraction of surface active sites of cathode catalyst.",

Here we report that expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and Cosmc is decreased in B cells, and correlates with B cell number and the aberrant glycosylation of IgA1 in IgAN. Patients with IgAN exhibit higher miR-374b in B cells compared to controls. We show that miR-374b targets PTEN and Cosmc by luciferase assays and western blot analysis. Inhibition of miR-374b increased PTEN and Cosmc expression, and prevented cell proliferation and aberrant glycosylation of IgA1, thus representing a new therapeutic approach for IgAN.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between mannose-binding protein(MBP) gene codon 54 (GGC/GAC) polymorphism and the patterns of glomerular immune deposition in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and explore its functional significance.IgAN patients were divided into two groups according to the pattern of glomerular immune deposition. Group A included 77 patients with glomerular IgA and C3 deposits. Group AGM consisted of 70 patients with glomerular IgA, IgG, IgM, C3 and Clq deposits. One hundred and forty healthy adults were used as normal controls. MBP genotypes were investigated by PCR-RFLP. Serum MBP levels of some subjects with different genotypes were also assayed by ELISA simultaneously.The genotype frequency of GAC heterozygotes was significantly higher in group AGM than in group A (41.4% vs. 19.5%, P<0.01) or normal subjects (41.4% vs. 26.4%, P<0.05), while no difference was found in the distribution of MBP genotypes between group A and normal subjects. The allele frequency of GAC mutation was also higher in group AGM than in group A (0.236 vs. 0.136, P<0.05) or normal subjects (0.236 vs. 0.146, P<0.05). The variant allele (GAC) was markedly associated with group AGM (OR=1.95, 95%CI: 1.06-3.58). In both group A and group AGM, more patients carrying the variant allele had episodes of upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infections prior to the onset or exacerbation of IgAN than wild homozygotes. In addition, a significant difference in serum MBP level was also observed among the three genotypes (GGC/GGC>GGC/GAC>GAC/GAC) (P<0.0001) for all groups, while there were no differences in serum MBP levels for subjects with the same genotypes among the three groups (P>0.05).The above findings provide evidence that IgAN patients with abundant immune deposits in glomeruli show a higher frequency of MBP gene variation which is associated with a high frequency of infection and a low serum MBP level. This genetic deficiency may lead to an impaired first-line defense and a less effective clearance of immune complex than those without this mutation and thereafter accelerate glomerular immune deposition during the process of disease.",

        "abstract": "Cashmere goats, as an important part of animal husbandry production, make outstanding contributions to animal fiber industry. In recent years, a great deal of research has been done on the molecular regulation mechanism of hair follicle cycle growth. However, there are few reports on the molecular regulation mechanisms of secondary hair follicle growth cycle in cashmere goats. In this study, we used transcriptome sequencing technique to sequence the skin of Inner Mongolia cashmere goats in different periods, Analyze the variation and difference of genes in the whole hair follicle cycle. And then, we verified the regulation mechanism of cashmere goat secondary hair follicle growth cycle by fluorescence quantitative PCR. As the result shows: The results of tissue section showed that the growth cycle of cashmere hair could be divided into three distinct periods: growth period (March-September), regression period (September-December) and resting period (December-March). The results of differential gene analysis showed that March was considered the beginning of the cycle, and the difference of gene expression was the most significant. Cluster analysis of gene expression in the whole growth cycle further supported the key nodes of the three periods of villus growth, and the differential gene expression of keratin corresponding to the villus growth cycle further supported the results of tissue slices. Quantitative fluorescence analysis showed that KAP3.1, KRTAP 8-1 and KRTAP 24-1 genes had close positive correlation with the growth cycle of cashmere, and their regulation was consistent with the growth cycle of cashmere. However, there was a sequence of expression time, indicating that the results of cycle regulation made the growth of cashmere change.",

        "abstract": "Inner Mongolia and Liaoning cashmere goats are two outstanding Chinese multipurpose breeds that adapt well to the semi-arid temperate grassland. These two breeds are characterized by their soft cashmere fibers, thus making them great models to identify genomic regions that are associated with cashmere fiber traits. Whole-genome sequencing of 70 cashmere goats produced more than 5.52 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 710,600 short insertions and deletions. Further analysis of these genetic variants showed some population-specific molecular markers for the two cashmere goat breeds that are otherwise phenotypically similar. By analyzing F  and θ outlier values, we identified 135 genomic regions that were associated with cashmere fiber traits within the cashmere goat populations. These selected genomic regions contained genes, which are potential involved in the production of cashmere fiber, such as FGF5, SGK3, IGFBP7, OXTR, and ROCK1. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of identified short insertions and deletions also showed enrichment in keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal cell differentiation. These findings demonstrate that this genomic resource will facilitate the breeding of cashmere goat and other Capra species in future.",

Methodology:Four hundred and forty-one Chinese patients (females 377 and males 64 with mean of 29.6±9.85 years old) with biopsy-proven DPLN (ISN/RPS2003 classification criteria) were collected in this study. The patient and renal survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to assess the risk factors associated with end stage renal disease (ESRD). Results:All patients were followed for (60.8±43.3) months with the median of 61 months. 15 patients died,and the patient survival at 5 and 10 year was 96.5% and 92% respectively. 28 cases developed ESRF,the renal survival at 5 and 10 year was 94.5% and 86.4% respectively. Baseline serum creatinine (SCr) ≥132.6 μmol/L (HR 6.54),renal CI≥3(HR 3.52),AI≥10(HR 2.10),with renal vascular lesion (HR 10.37)or type V lesion (HR 2.80),and no remission after induction treatments (HR 10.22) or relapse during follow-up(HR 6.13)were independent risk factors for developing ESRD. 71 patients was performed re-biopsy because of no remission after the induction treatment or relapse during maintenance period,among them 17 (23.9%) showed renal histological transformation from class IV to class IV+V. Adverse effects included infection (21.3%),menstrual disorders(20.2%),elevation of liver enzyme (4.5%),leucopenia (2.7%),diabetes mellitus (2.3%),hypersensitiveness (1.4%),psychiatric symptom (0.9%),avascular necrosis (5.4%),deep vein thrombosis (0.9%),and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.7%),skin cancer (0.2%) and mesothelial cell tumor (0.2%). Conclusion:Long-term patient and renal survival rate were high in this group of patients with DPLN. The patients with renal vascular lesion,no remission after induction treatment or relapse had high risks to develop ESRD. The high incidence of adverse events was the main factors associated with the morbidity and mortality of patients with lupus nephritis.",

Little is known about the gene expression differences between primary and secondary hair follicle cycling. In this study, we obtained RNA-seq data from cashmere and milk goats grown at four different seasons. We studied the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during the yearly hair follicle cycling, and between cashmere and milk goats. WNT, NOTCH, MAPK, BMP, TGFβ and Hedgehog signaling pathways were involved in hair follicle cycling in both cashmere and milk goat. However, Milk goat DEGs between different months were significantly more than cashmere goat DEGs, with the largest difference being identified in December.

To determine if the podocyte-specific gene information contained in mRNA profiles of the whole glomerulus of the diabetic kidney accurately reflects gene expression in the isolated podocytes, we crossed  Nos3 −/−   IRG mice with podocin-rtTA and TetON-Cre mice for enhanced green fluorescent protein labeling of podocytes before diabetic injury. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin, and mRNA profiles of isolated glomeruli and sorted podocytes from diabetic and control mice were examined 10 weeks later. Expression of podocyte-specific markers in glomeruli was downregulated in diabetic mice compared with controls. However, expression of these markers was not altered in sorted podocytes from diabetic mice. When mRNA levels of glomeruli were corrected for podocyte number per glomerulus, the differences in podocyte marker expression disappeared. Analysis of the differentially expressed genes in diabetic mice also revealed distinct upregulated pathways in the glomeruli (mitochondrial function, oxidative stress) and in podocytes (actin organization). In conclusion, our data suggest reduced expression of podocyte markers in glomeruli is a secondary effect of reduced podocyte number, thus podocyte-specific gene expression detected in the whole glomerulus may not represent that in podocytes in the diabetic kidney.",

Methodology:Thirty lupus nephritis(LN) patients with vascular lesion and thirty LN patients without vascular lesion were recruited. Twenty-five age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers served as controls. The levels of thrombomodulin (TM), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin were measured by ELISA. Results:The levels of TM and VCAM-1 had no difference between LN patients without vascular lesion and control group. In patients with vascular lesion, the levels of TM and VCAM-1 were significantly higher than those patients without vascular lesion (P<0.01). The level of E-selectin had no difference between LN patients with vascular lesions and control group. A strong positive correlation was found between TM and renal function (creatinine) (r=0.625, P<0.01). In all LN patients with vascular lesion, the level of TM of those with TMA was significantly increased compared with those without TMA (P<0.01). Conclusion:Combined with renal pathological examination, monitoring the circulatory biomarkers of endothelial damage, such as TM and VCAM-1, can provide more comprehensive view of renal vascular lesions in LN patients.",

        "abstract": "Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressive drug with a narrow therapeutic range and wide interindividual variation in its pharmacokinetics. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp, encoded by MDR1) play an important role in the absorption and metabolism of tacrolimus. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether or not CYP3A5*1/*3 or MDR1 C3435T polymorphisms are associated with the tacrolimus concentration per dose.CYP3A5 and MDR1 genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 118 Chinese renal transplant patients receiving tacrolimus. Whole blood trough tacrolimus concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and dose-adjusted concentration (ng/mL per mg/kg/d) was calculated at 1 wk, 1 month, and 3 months after transplantation.The dose-adjusted concentration of CYP3A5*1/*1 and *1/*3 patients was significantly lower than *3/*3 patients (32.8 +/- 17.7 and 41.6 +/- 15.8 vs. 102.3 +/- 51.2 at 1 wk; 33.1 +/- 7.5 and 46.4 +/- 12.9 vs. 103 +/- 47.5 at 1 month; 35.3 +/- 20.9 and 59.0 +/- 20.6 vs. 150 +/- 85.3 at 3 months after transplantation respectively). At 1 wk, 46% of the CYP3A5*1 allele carriers had a tacrolimus concentration lower than 5 ng/mL and 77% lower than 8 ng/mL, whereas 20% of the *3/*3 patients had a concentration higher than 20 ng/mL. There was a mild difference between *1/*1 homozygotes and *1/*3 heterozygotes at 1 and 3 months after transplantation. No difference was found among the MDR1 genotypes.CYP3A5*1/*3 polymorphisms are associated with tacrolimus pharmacokinetics and dose requirements in renal transplant recipients. Pharmacogenetic methods could be employed prospectively to help initial dose selection and to individualize immunosuppressive therapy.",

An understanding of the ligand selective mechanisms is critical in the design and identification of LXRβ-selective ligands because the α and β isoforms, LXRα-Val263 and LXRβ-Ile277 have only minor structural differences in the ligand binding domain (LBD). In this work, in silico and in vitro studies have been performed. For the first time, we report that the ligand LXRβ-selectivity relies on structural differences between LXRα-Val263 and LXRβ-Ile277, and also on conformational changes at Leu274 and Ala275. These residues are the same in both α and β isoforms, but their conformational changes when interacting with selective ligands are different. Mutation studies indicate that replacing both Val263 and Ile277 with alanine residues does not completely nullify the β-selectivity. High β-binding selectivity can be related to the synergistic effects of other residues that interact with the ligand in the LBD although these residues are identical in both LXRα and LXRβ. This work offers a path to the design and optimization of selective LXRβ agonists.",

Pre- and post-irradiation direct current (DC) characteristics were used to quantify the dose tolerance to the heavy ion irradiation. Base current was found more sensitive than collector current and current gain appeared to decline with the ion fluence increasing. An unexpected increase in emitter current was observed in the reversed-mode operation. The reverse leakage current of base-collector and base-emitter junction increased with the increase in ion fluence. The displacement damages were thought to be mainly contributed to performance degradation of SiGe HBT.",

Ten age-matched non-diabetic male littermates db/m mice treated with placebo were studied as non-diabetic control. Body weight and fasting blood glucose level were measured before and after medication. The islets were isolated after 8 weeks' gavage. Islet perifusion system was set up, and all columns were perfused in parallel at a flow rate of 0.5 mL x min(-1) with KRB (2.8 mmol L(-1) glucose) at 37 degrees C. After 60-min static incubation with KRB (2.8 mmol x L(-1) glucose), the islets were stimulated in the continuous presence of a high concentration of 16.7 mmol x L(-1) glucose. Samples were collected every 20-second until 2-min, every 1-min until 5-min, thereafter every 5-min until 30-min. Samples were immediately stocked at -80 degrees C until further analysis.Compared with the db/db control group, the fasting glucose concentration was significantly decreased in the rhein treatment group. The first-phase insulin secretory function was impaired significantly in db/db mice, while the first-phase insulin secretory peak was obvious in the rhein treatment mice.Rhein treatment significantly improved glucose tolerance, restored the first-phase insulin secretion and protected the islets function.",

Excess base currents and normalized current gains are used to quantify performance degradation. Experiment results demonstrate that the lower the dose rate, the more the irradiation damage, and some enhanced low dose rate sensitivity (ELDRS) exists in SiGe HBTs. The ELDRS effect is found to depend highly on the bias condition during exposure, and the transistors with forward active mode exhibit a more serious ELDRS effect compared to the floating case. The performance degradation at different dose rates and bias conditions is compared and discussed, and furthermore the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed and investigated in detail. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

The density of CD4+, CD8+, CD20+, and CD68+ cells and HLA-DR expression were characterized and quantified using immunohistochemical staining. Histologic changes were compared between high-density and low-density CD20+ B-cell groups. Poor prognosis factors were analyzed with Cox proportional regression.Density of CD20+ cells in the very-early rejection group was lower than it was in the early- and late-acute rejection groups (P = .03); the density of CD4+, CD8+, and CD68+ cells and HLA-DR expression did not differ between the groups. Mesangial matrix increase, tubular atrophy, arteriolar hyaline thickening, and tubulitis were more prevalent in the high CD20+ density group. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that HLA-DR expression on the tubules, arteriolar hyaline thickening, and CD20+ cell density were associated with an elevated risk of acute cellular rejection.Expansion aggregation of CD20+ B cells occurred mostly after 2 weeks. When combined with HLA-DR expression and arteriolar hyaline thickening, these influence the outcome of acute cellular rejection in renal allograft.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To evaluate the short term effects of tacrolimus(FK506),a kind of calcineurin inhibitors,in patients with Alport syndrome.Methodology:Five 5 cases with Alport syndrome who proved non-responsive to ACEI and traditional Chinese herbal medicine were enrolled this study.All of them were performed percutanious biopsy and satisfied the Flinter's diagnostic criteria for Alport syndrome,and had pathologic evidence of collagen IV chains abnormalities both in kidney and/or skin biopsy specimen.They were 4 male and one female with an average age of 18.5 years old.Their inheritance modes were 4 X-linkage and one autosomal recessive AS(ARAS).FK506 was administered at a dosage of 0.15 mg/(kg·d) for the first 8 weeks and then tapered to 0.10 mg/(kg·d) for the maintenance therapy.The target trough serum concentration of FK506 was 5～8 ng/dl.The efficacy and side-effects of FK506 were observed at an interval of 2～4 weeks during the follow-up.Results:In 4 of the five patients whose CYP3A5 polymorphic genotypes were 2 of CYP3A5-*1/*3,one of CYP3A5-*3/*3 and one of CYP3A5-*1/*1,the target trough level of FK506 was achieved in the proposed therapeutic window range,except one patient of CYP3A5-*1/*1 genotype.In the end of the second and the fourth week of follow-up,a marked reduction of 24-hour urinary protein excretion,and an elevation of serum albumin level were observed in all of patients.Two cases withdrew FK506 because of side-effects as renal toxicity and/or abnormal glucose metabolism.One patient dropped out of the study because of inefficacy associated with failure to achieve targeted trough serum level of FK506.Another 2 patients prolonged the therapy of FK506 for 36 weeks and 40 weeks showed that the level of serum albumin maintained at 33～35 g/L and proteinuria fluctuating between 0.5～2.5 g/L.The side-effects of renal toxicity,gastro-intestinal disorders,and abnormality of glucose metabolism were observed during the first 8 weeks.Conclusion:The proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia was improved by the short term of FK506 therapy in the patients with Alport syndrome.The long-term efficacy of FK506 therapy for patients with Alport syndrome remained further investigation.",

        "abstract": "Few data are available on the clinical features and outcomes of Chinese patients with systemic immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. The aim of this study is to reveal the clinical picture and risk factors of disease progression in a large cohort of Chinese patients with AL amyloidosis.Patients in the Jinling Hospital amyloidosis registry from 2003 to 2011 were studied. The clinical and laboratory information were collected from first presentation to death or until the last available clinical follow-up. The patients' survival and renal outcomes were analyzed, and the relationships between the clinical parameters and survival were also assessed.A total of 231 patients were enrolled in this study, all the patients studied had renal involvement. One hundred and fifty-three (66.2%) were male, and the median age at diagnosis was 56 years. A total of 198 (85.7%) cases had light-chain λ-type. One hundred and forty-seven (63.6%) cases presented as nephrotic syndrome (NS), and 25% of patients had renal insufficiency at diagnosis. Liver involvement and NS appeared to be more common in patients of κ-type amyloidosis, and renal impairment is more severe in κ-type amyloidosis. The median survival time of all patients was 36.3 months, and the 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year cumulative survival rates were 67, 53, 48 and 35%, respectively. Multivariate COX analysis showed that age, hepatic involvement and heart involvement can significantly influence survival in these patients. The median time that patients remained dialysis free was 50 months. The percentage of patients that remained dialysis free at 1, 2, 3 and 5 years were 78, 69, 62 and 37%, respectively. Multivariate COX analysis showed that serum creatinine and hypotension were the important risk factors of renal failure.λ-Type is the most dominant type of AL amyloidosis in Chinese patients. The survival of patients with AL amyloidosis is poor. The risk factors included heart and hepatic involvement, hypotension and impairment of renal function. The high serum creatinine level and hypotension at diagnosis are associated with poor renal outcome.",

        "abstract": "We report a bubbling chemical vapor deposition method for mass production of high-quality graphite nanosheets using molten copper as the catalyst for continuous growth. Bubbles containing precursor gas (CH4 or natural gas) are produced by inserting an aerator into molten copper. High-quality graphite nanosheets with a thickness ranging from a few to 40 graphitic layers are grown on bubble surfaces and carried to the copper surface. The production rate can be as high as 9.4 g/h using a crucible with a volume of 3 L. The high quality of the graphite nanosheets is demonstrated by composites with very high conductivity. The highly conductive composite shows excellent performance in an electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding application with an EMI effectiveness of u003e70 dB at X band. Moreover, except for precursor gases, the lack of other chemicals in the growth process makes it an environmentally friendly approach. Natural gas can also be used as the precursor, making it a low-cost production. In addition...",

Methodology:HVHF was performed in 25 patients with AKI after cardiotomy, including 16 males and 9 females, with average age of 15~80(56.4±16.80) years. Except 6 of the patients quitted in early stage of HVHF for economics, the remaining 19 patients were divided into three groups. They were group Ⅰ ( AKI Ⅰ stage,n=6) received HVHF when SCr was ≥0.3 mg/dl (≥26.4 μmol/L) or increased to ≥150%-200% (1.5-to 2-fold) from baseline, or<0.5 ml/(kg·h) for>6 hours, group Ⅱ (AKI Ⅱ stage,n=6), HVHF was started when SCr>200%-300%(2-to 3-fold) from baseline, or<0.5 ml/(kg·h) for>12 hours, and group Ⅲ (AKI Ⅲ,n=7) had HVHF when SCr>300%(3-fold) from baseline (SCr≥4.0 mg/dl (≥354 μmo/L) with an acute increase of at least 0.5 mg/dl(44 μmol/L), or<0.5 ml/(kg·h) for>12 hours. HVHF was performed with AV600 hemofilter (polysulfone, 1.6 m2). The rate of substitute fluid was at 4 000 ml/h by a pre-dilution route, and the rate of blood flow was 200-250 ml/min. Low molecular weight heparin and/or citrate were used for anticoagulation. The general conditions of each patients including blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and temperature (T) were monitored every 30 minutes, and the blood gas analysis, serum biochemistry test were detected before and every 24 hours after the initiation of HVHF. APACHEⅡscores were evaluated every 12 hours during HVHF. Results:HVHF was well tolerated in all patients and the hospital mortality of 57.9%. The mortality of group I was lower than group III(50% vs 71.4%)while the patients in group I were more severe: the cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB)time[(244.2±170.46) vs (154.3±73.58)]and x-clamp time[(93.2±43.21) vs (82±59.59)]were both longer than group III,and more patients accepted IABP (66.7% vs 28.6%). After 12 hours' HVHF treatment, the high fever of patients was improved obviously(P<0.05), while heart rate and MAP was maintained in normal range. After 24 hours' therapy, the serum creatinine and blood urea were both decreased (P<0.05), and all survival patients had renal function recovered. After HVHF (60 hrs), we also found APACHE II scores improved significantly (P<0.05). Conclusion:HVHF is technically possible in AKI patients after cardiotomy, which was an important treatment to post-cardiac operation patients with AKI and MODS. We also found that early HVHF performed in AKI I stage was better, which had lower mortality.",

Methodology:Seven hundred and fifty nine IgAN patients from November 2003 to June 2006 were enrolled in this study. They were divided into seven subtypes: isolated microscopic hematuria (I-H), asymptomatic abnormal urinalysis (U-ab), recurrent macroscopic hematuria (R-H), crescentic IgAN (cres. IgAN), mass proteinuria (MP), hypertension (HT) and end stage renal disease (ESRD). Their epidemiological features, clinical manifestations were investigated and compared. Results:They were 371 males and 388 females with mean age (30.0±10.0) years old. Among the 759 patients, there were 2.8% I-H, 13.2% R-GH, 42.9% U-ab, 7.2% Cres.IgAN, 10.9% MP and 18.9% HT. Different subtypes had different clinical characteristics: isolated microscopic hematuria was the only clinical feature of I-H. U-ab was the most common subtype in IgA nephropathy, 47% patients without clinical findings. 69% patients with R-GH had the upper respiratory infection or diarrhea before the onset of the macroscopic hematuria. Severe hematuria, proteinuria and renal dysfunction were the most noticeable clinical manifestations in Cres.IgAN. The amount of urinary protein excretion in MP was markedly more than that in other subtypes. And there were a number of clinical features for HT: these include the male predominance, the peak incidence in the third decades of life, and 62.5% patients with renal dysfunction at the onset of the disease.

After pyrolysis and amalgamation, the mercury was determined by cold atomic absorption spectrometry at 253. 65 nm. Optimal experimental conditions were discussed, including the sampling amount, determination mode, background control and selection of instrumental analysis conditions. The linear range of method was 0.1-600 ng, and the detection limit was 0.0007μg/g. The proposed method was applied to the determination of mercury in two reference mineral samples, whose results were consistent with the certified values. The relative standard deviations(RSD, n=7)were 3.3% and 1.1%, respectively. The mercury-containing mineral samples such as copper concentrate, manganese ore and zinc ore were determined by this method, as well as by cold atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry after digestion. It took only 5 min to determine one sample. The results showed that there was no significant difference. The dosage of sample required in this method was small, which enabled it more applicable to the testing of batch samples.",

The structural formula of this compound was Mg[B 6 O 9 (OH) 2 ]·2.5H 2 O. The enthalpy of solution of MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·3.5H 2 O in approximately 1 mol dm −3 HCl was determined. With the incorporation of the standard molar enthalpies of formation of MgO(s), H 3 BO 3 (s), and H 2 O(l), the standard molar enthalpy of formation of −(5595.02±4.85) kJ mol −1 of MgO·3B 2 O 3 3.5H 2 O was obtained. Thermodynamic properties of this compound was also calculated by group contribution method. Keywords MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·3.5H 2 O Synthesis Standard molar enthalpy of formation Solution calorimetry 1 Introduction There are many kinds of magnesium borates, both natural and synthetic. Up to now, four hydrated magnesium borates belong to MgO·3B 2 O 3 · n H 2 O ( n =7.5, 7, 6, 5) are found. The polyborate anion of all these borates is [B 6 O 7 (OH) 6 ] 2− . Recently, we discovered a new magnesium hexaborate when investigating the phase transformation of 2MgO·2B 2 O 3 ·MgCl 2 ·14H 2 O in boric acid aqueous solution. Its structure has been studied using XRD, FT-IR and Raman spectra as well as TG. Thermodynamic properties play very important roles in scientific research and industrial applications. Li et al. reported [1,2] the standard molar enthalpy of formation of nine hydrated magnesium borates. As part of the continuing study of the thermochemistry of hydrated borates, this paper reports the synthesis and the standard molar enthalpy of formation of MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·3.5H 2 O. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·3.5H 2 O MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·3.5H 2 O was synthesized by the method of phase transformation of double salt. The 2MgO·2B 2 O 3 ·MgCl 2 ·14H 2 O (3.72 g, synthesized by modification of the literature method [3] ), H 3 BO 3 (5.96 g), and H 2 O (40 ml) were transferred to a flask with a reflux condenser, the mixture was heated to the boiling point and became a clear solution. After 3 days, Mg-borate crystallized from the clear solution. The solid was separated, washed thoroughly with hot distilled water, and then with alcohol and ether. Finally, the solid was dried at T =353 K to constant mass. The synthetic sample was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (recorded on a Rigaku D/MAX-IIIC), FT-IR spectroscopy (recorded on a Bruker Equinox 55 spectrometer with KBr pellets at room temperature), Raman spectroscopy (recorded on a Nicolet Almega Dispersive Ramanmeter), and TG (determined on a Perkin-Elmer TGA7 thermograph analyser at a heating rate of 10 °C min −1 in flowing N 2 ). The chemical composition of the sample was determined by EDTA titration for Mg 2+ , by NaOH standard solution in the presence of mannitol for B 2 O 3 , and by difference for H 2 O. 2.2 Method of calorimetric experiment MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·3.5H 2 O can be regarded as the product of the following reaction: (1) MgO ( s )+6 H 3 BO 3 ( s )= MgB 6 O 10 ·3.5 H 2 O ( s )+5.5 H 2 O The standard molar enthalpy of formation of MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·3.5H 2 O could be obtained by solution calorimetry in combination with the standard molar enthalpies of formation of MgO(s), H 3 BO 3 (s), and H 2 O(l). The H 3 BO 3 and MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·3.5H 2 O were dissolved in approximately 1 mol dm −3 HCl(aq), respectively, and then the calculated amount of MgO was dissolved in aqueous (hydrochloric acid+boric acid) which consisted of approximately 1 mol dm −3 HCl(aq) and the calculated amount of H 3 BO 3 . The HCl solvent was prepared from analytical grade hydrochloric acid and deionized water, and its concentration was determined by titration with standard sodium carbonate. A RD496-III heat conduction microcalorimeter (Southwest Institute of Electron Engineering, China) was used and has been described in detail previously [4] . The temperature of the calorimetric experiment was 298.15 K. Additional double-layer glass tubes were put in the 15 ml stainless steel sample cell and reference cell of the calorimeter. This was done to prevent corrosion of the stainless steel sample and reference cell by HCl(aq). The lining in the double-layer glass tube containing HCl(aq) was broken by a rod after thermal equilibration for at least 2 h. The HCl(aq) was mixed with solid sample in the outer glass tube, then the thermal effect was recorded automatically on an computer. Total time required for the complete reaction was about 0.5 h. There were no solid residues observed after the reactions in each calorimetric experiment. To check the performance of RD496-III heat conduction microcalorimeter, calorimetric measurements on the enthalpy of solution of KCl (spectral purity) in deionized water were made. The experimental value 17.23±0.04 kJ mol −1 of Δ sol H m is in excellent agreement with that of 17.234 kJ mol −1 reported in the literature [5] . This shows that the device for measuring the enthalpy of solution used in this work is reliable. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of synthetic sample Chemical analysis results of synthetic sample: MgO, 13.06%; B 2 O 3 , 66.44%; H 2 O, 20.50%; mole ratio of MgO:B 2 O 3 :H 2 O, 1.00:2.95:3.51. XRD data of synthetic sample, d (Å): 7.167, 6.223, 5.720, 4.048, 3.596, 3.417, 3.104, 2.688, 2.497, 2.152, 2.082, 2.070. The IR and Raman spectra of synthetic sample exhibited the following absorptions and they were assigned referring to literature [6] . The band at 3433 cm −1 is the stretching of OH. The band at 1635 cm −1 is assigned to the HOH bending mode, which shows the compound containing the crystal water. The bands at 1443, 1335 cm −1 and 946, 904 cm −1 might be the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of B(3)O, respectively. The band at 1200 cm −1 is the in-plane bending of BOH. The bands at 1111, 1043 cm −1 and 802, 875 cm −1 (Raman) are assigned as the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of B(4)O, respectively. The bands at 742 cm −1 (very weak) in FT-IR spectra and 744 cm −1 in Raman spectra are the out-of-plane bending of B(3)O. The very strong Raman spectra peak 636 cm −1 is assigned as the characteristic of hexaborate anion. The bands at 475 cm −1 in FT-IR and 399 cm −1 in Raman are the bending modes of B(4)O. It can be seen that the shape of XRD spectra and the vibration frequencies of FT-IR and Raman are more similar to those of CaO·3B 2 O 3 ·4H 2 O which structure is Ca[B 6 O 9 (OH) 2 ]·3H 2 O than MgO·3B 2 O 3 · n H 2 O ( n =7.5, 7, 6, 5). TG curve indicates that the total loss is 20.02%, and there exist two weight loss stages from 60 to 733 °C. The first weight loss from 60 to 310 °C, 14.13%, corresponds to the loss of 2.5 water molecules and can be compared with calculated value of 14.42%. The second weight loss from 310 to 733 °C, 5.88%, corresponds to the loss of one water molecule and can be compared with calculated value of 5.77%. Therefore, the structural formula of MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·3.5H 2 O can be written as Mg[B 6 O 9 (OH) 2 ]·2.5 H 2 O. No impurity lines were observed, and the synthetic sample is suitable for the calorimetric experiments. 3.2 Results of calorimetric experiment The results of the calorimetric measurements are given in Table 1 , in which m is the mass of sample, Δ sol H is the enthalpy of solution of solute, Δ sol H m is the molar enthalpy of solution of solute, and the uncertainty is estimated as twice the standard deviation of the mean. Table 2 gives the thermochemical cycle for the derivation of the standard molar enthalpy of formation of MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·3.5H 2 O. The molar enthalpy of solution of H 3 BO 3 (s) of (21.83±0.08) kJ mol −1 in approximately 1 mol dm −3 HCl(aq), and of MgO(s) of −(146.20±0.36) kJ mol −1 in the mixture of HCl and H 3 BO 3 were taken from literature [1] . The standard molar enthalpies of formation of H 2 O(l), MgO(s), and H 3 BO 3 (s) were taken from the CODATA Key Values [7] , namely −(285.830±0.040), −(601.60±0.30), and −(1094.8±0.8) kJ mol −1 , respectively. The enthalpy of dilution HCl(aq) was calculated from the NBS tables [8] . From these data, the standard molar enthalpy of formation of MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·3.5H 2 O was calculated to be −(5595.02±4.85) kJ mol −1 . The enthalpy of formation of MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·3.5H 2 O can also be estimated by a group contribution method [9] as the sum of the contributions of Mg 2+ (aq), [B 6 O 9 (OH) 2 ] 2− (aq) and of structural water. The standard molar enthalpy of formation is, using this scheme, −5597.73 kJ mol −1 . The calculated value is close to the experimental result. The relative error is −0.05%. This result shows that the proposed structural formula of this compound, Mg[B 6 O 9 (OH) 2 ]·2.5H 2 O, is correct. So we also used a group contribution method to calculate Δ f G ° m of MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·3.5H 2 O to be −5149.07 kJ mol −1 . Combining the Δ f H ° m of MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·3.5H 2 O, the standard molar entropy of formation of MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·3.5H 2 O has been calculated at −1504.81 J mol −1 K −1 according to following equation: Δ f S° m = Δ f H° m − Δ f G° m T Finally, the standard molar entropy of MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·3.5H 2 O was calculated to be 404.30 J mol −1 K −1 according to following reaction: Mg ( s )+6 B ( s )+3.5 H 2 ( g )+ 13.5 2 O 2 ( g )= MgB 6 O 10 ·3.5 H 2 O ( s ) The standard molar entropies of the elements were taken from CODATA Key Values to be 32.67, 5.90, 130.571, and 205.043 J mol −1 K −1 for Mg(s), B(s), H 2 (g), and O 2 (g), respectively.

        "abstract": "Summary   Hypocomplementemia has been frequently reported in immunoglobulin G4–related kidney disease (IgG4-RKD). However, studies on the role of complement system in IgG4-RKD are lacking. A total of 40 429 renal biopsies from January 2010 to January 2018 were reexamined in the present study, and 17 patients were confirmed to meet the criteria of IgG4-RKD. According to the serum C3 levels, they were divided into 2 groups: the low-C3 group (C3  P  = .025), higher serum IgG4 concentrations ( P  = .003), higher positive rates in rheumatoid factor ( P  = .033), more severe storiform fibrosis ( P  = .007) at diagnosis, and higher blood urea nitrogen levels at the latest test ( P  = .04). The serum levels of C3 were in negative correlation with the serum levels of IgG4 ( P  = .003), the levels of rheumatoid factor ( P  = .002), renal deposition of C1q ( P  = .028), storiform fibrosis ( P  P  = .015), the amount of renal IgG4–positive (IgG4 + ) plasma cells ( P  = .020), the ratios of IgG4 +  plasma cells/CD138 +  cells ( P  = .018), and the blood urea nitrogen concentrations at the last test ( P  = .023). Our study shows that IgG4-RKD is a relatively rare entity. Complement system may participate in the development of IgG4-RKD.",

        "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can result in hypertension and significantly increase cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. There are few reports on the long-term effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled hypertension with coronary heart disease (CHD) and OSA.We conducted a prospective, long-term follow-up study in 83 patients with uncontrolled hypertension, CHD, and OSA randomized to control or CPAP groups. Daytime systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and severe cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (SCCEs) were recorded at baseline and follow-up.Seventy-three patients completed the study with a median follow-up of 36 (interquartile range = 24-54) months. The 2 groups had similar characteristics at baseline. CPAP was used for 4.5±1.1 hour/night. SBP in the CPAP group was significantly reduced at follow-up (143±7 mm Hg vs. 139±7 mm Hg, P = 0.04), and SBP decreased by 8mm Hg (95% confidence interval = 1.4-9.9; P = 0.01). Hypertension control was improved (CPAP, 69.4% for CPAP users vs. 43.2% for control subjects; P = 0.02); however, DBP did not reach statistical difference between the groups (81±10 mm Hg vs. 79±8 mm Hg; P = 0.49). In the CPAP group, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was markedly reduced (7.0±3.4 vs. 3.7±2.3; P < 0.001). There was 1 SCCE in the CPAP group (heart failure), and 5 SCCEs in the control group (acute myocardial infarction: 2 (with 1 death); stroke: 3), but there was no significant difference identified.Long-term CPAP application in uncontrolled hypertension with CHD and OSA significantly reduced daytime SBP, improved hypertension control and daytime sleepiness, and decreased the trend in SCCEs compared with control subjects.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02059993.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Rhein has been proved effective in reducing mesangium matrix formation and inhibitive of the up-regulated glucose transporting in mesangial cell in diabetic rats. In this study, we investigated the effects of rhein on renal expression of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and its receptors type Ⅰ (TβRⅠ) and type Ⅱ (TβRⅡ) in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Methodology:An animal model of diabetes was established by intraperitoneal injection of STZ. Ninety-six adult female Wistar rats were divided randomly into normal control group, diabetic control group, low-dose rhein treated group 35 mg/(kg·d) and high-dose rhein treated group 70 mg/(kg·d). At the end of the 4th-week, the 8th-week and the 12th-week, eight rats in each group were sacrifised, and data of parameters as body weight, left kidney weight, serum glucose, serum creatinine, and 24-hour urinary protein excretion were collected. The urinary level of TGF-β was detected with ELISA. Renal mRNA and protein expression of TGF-β, TβRⅠ, TβRⅡ, FN and GLUT1 were measured with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot and immunohistochemical techniques. Results:In diabetic control group, serum glucose level and 24h urinary protein excretion rate were increased significantly. Renal expression of TGF-β, TβRⅠ, TβRⅡ and FN protein, and renal expression of both GLUT1 mRNA and protein peaked at the 8th-week of observation. In diabetic rats treated with rhein, the serum glucose level, the serum creatine level, 24h urine protein excretion and renal/body weight index were reduced time- and dose-dependently. The renal mRNA and protein expression of TGF-β, TβRⅠ, TβRⅡ, FN and GLUT1 were all down-regulated time- and dose-dependently. Conclusion:Rhein ameliorates renal lesion in diabetic rats, by decreasing serum glucose level and renal mesangial matrix. Rhein directly suppressed synthesis of TGF-β and expression of TGF-β receptors (TβRⅠ and TβRⅡ ). The mechanism of rhein' effect might be related to the suppression of up-regulated hexosamine biosythesis pathway and to the suppression of over-expression of GLUT1.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Hazardous zinc refinery residues that contain Ag and Hg are a typical complex material obtained from zinc oxygen pressure leaching and currently there are few economically viable methods for disposal or reuse. The research presented here offers an effective approach for the comprehensive recovery of Zn, Fe, Cu, Ag and Hg from this highly toxic waste. During the initial hot-acid leaching stage, leaching efficiencies of 96.3% Zn, 96.0% Fe and 97.5% Cu were obtained, whereas the leaching of Ag and Hg were  3+ , with a L/S ratio of 8 and a temperature of 40 °C for 2 h. The residue after thiourea leaching could be used as raw material in lead smelting. In the next step based on zinc powder cementation, the recovery of Ag and Hg both reached 99.0% and the cementation residue comprised of 53.1 wt% Ag and 11.7 wt% Hg. The main phases present included Ag, Hg 3 Ag 2  and Ag 2 S and these can be further treated by vacuum distillation in order to separate Hg from Ag. These findings demonstrate that high recoveries of Zn, Fe, Cu, Ag and Hg from the toxic waste could be achieved with stepwise leaching followed by zinc powder cementation. This treatment protocol for toxic zinc refinery residues not only avoids the potential harm to the environment but also significantly improves the economics of the process.",

Methodology:Fifty cases with type 2 DN were enrolled in this study. According to urinary protein excretion they were divided into three groups:microalbuminuria (albuminuria 30~300 mg/24h),overtproteinuria (proteinuria 0.5-2.0 g/24h) and heavyproteinuria (proteinuria>3.5 g/24h). The clinical parameters were collected,and renal biopsy were performed in all patients. The histological characteristics and the changes of glomerular filtration barrier were observed under light microscope and transmission electron microscope. The glomerular volume,endotheliocyte density,endotheliocyte number,GBM thickness,podocyte density,podocyte number and foot-process width in the three groups of patients were also analyzed by morphometric methods. Results:There was no significant difference in age,sex,BMI,blood pressure,duration of DN among three different groups. We found that the changes of glomerular filtration barrier were swelling,proliferation and the detachment from GBM of the glomerular endothelial cells,wrinkling,collapse GBM,the changes of GBM thickness,the density and disappearance of normal trilaminar structure,the different degrees of foot-process fusion,microvillus formation,and the defluvium of podocyte. The morphometry analysis under light-and electron-microscopic were confirmed:(1) The number of glomerular endothelial cells had already increased in patients with 2TDN since the stage of microalbuminuria (microalbuminuria,overtproteinuria,heavyproteinuria vs control P<0.01),but the density of glomerular endothelial cells didn't change much among three different proteinuria groups (P>0.05). (2) The thickness of GBM increased since the stage of microalbuminuria (microalbuminuria,overtproteinuria,heavyproteinuria vs control P<0.01),and more disappearance of normal trilaminar structure occured as the proteinuria increasing. (3) Since the stage of microalbuminuria,the density of podocyte was decreased (microalbuminuria vs control P<0.01),and foot-process width was increased (microalbuminuria vs control P<0.01). With the development of disease,the podocyte density and number was progresively decreased (microalbuminuria vs heavyproteinuria P<0.05). (4) The degrees of proteinuria was related to the number of podocyte (heavyproteinuria,r=0.648,P<0.01) and GBM thickness (overtproteinuria,r=0.538,P<0.05). Conclusion:There was a series of changes in the ultrastructure of glomerular filtration barrier in patients with 2TDN,which were corelative with proteinuria.",

Beier sag is a second-order structural unit in the south of Beier Lake depression.. The control subsidence fault of Beier sag is a listric normal fault which consists of a convex and two concave fault-bend, and formed extensional duplex in depth..

The horizontal extension of the control subsidence fault F 1 is 6850 m during Late Nantun Period in the Early Cretaceous, determined by the rollover width between active axial surface and inactive axial surface.. The geometry and kinematics of extensional fault-bend fold in Beier sag reflect the impact of the fault slip rate, the tectonic subsidence rate, deposition rate on deformation characteristics of sedimentary strata and constrains on the sedimentation and petroleum geological conditions in the depression.. The internal angular unconformity of the Upper Member of Nantun Formation in Beier sag developed without erosion or hiatus on deformation due to increases in deposition rate relative to subsidence rate, where half-graben compartments change from sediment-underfilled to overfilled conditions.",

Keywords Hydrated hexaborate Crystal structure Vibrational spectroscopy Thermal analysis 1 Introduction Boron can form a large variety of compounds because of the complexity of the structures involved. Besides a lot of single metal borates found in nature and synthesized in laboratory, there are many double metal borates. Some of these compounds have useful physical properties, such as KB 5 O 8 ·4H 2 O, CsLiB 6 O 10 [1] , and CsB 3 O 5 [2] . Their single crystals have very good non-linearity. This is the reason that the chemistry of borates has been reinvestigated for recent years. Mostly, the double metal borates are composed of alkali and alkaline earth metals. They could be triborates, such as K 2 Mg[B 3 O 3 (OH) 5 ] 2 ·4H 2 O [3] , tetraborates, such as Cs 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O [4] , pentaborates, such as NaCa[B 5 O 6 (OH) 6 ]·5H 2 O [5] . In this paper, the crystal structure, vibrational spectroscopy, and thermal behavior of the hexaborate containing mixed cations of K + and Mg 2+ has been reported. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis All reagents used in the synthesis were of analytical grade (Xian Chemical Factory, China). An amount of 12.94 g of K 2 B 4 O 7 ·5H 2 O was dissolved in 100 ml H 2 O. Then, the above solution was mixed with 2.043 g of MgCl 2 ·6H 2 O to form a precipitate. The mixtures were stirred and a 1:1 aqueous solution of HCl was added gradually until the solution was clear, and the pH value of this solution was 7.5. The obtained solution was filtered and brought to room temperature. Crystallization began after 3 months, and large single crystals were obtained after about 6 months. Finally, the obtained solid was dried in a vacuum dryer to a constant mass at room temperature and was characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy (recorded over the 400–4000 cm −1 region on a Bruker Equinox 55 spectrometer with KBr pellets at room temperature), Raman spectroscopy (recorded over the 300–4000 cm −1 region on a Nicolet Almega Dispersive Ramanmeter), and TG (determined on a METZSCH-Geratebau GmbH STA449C Thermal Analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min −1 in flowing N 2 ). 2.2 Determination of crystal structure A colorless, transparent crystal of size 0.47 mm × 0.32 mm × 0.19 mm was selected for the crystal structure measurements. The X-ray diffraction intensities were recorded by a Bruker Smart-1000 CCD automatic four-circle diffractometer with graphite-monochromatized Mo Kα radiation ( λ = 0.071073 nm). Crystal data and conditions of the intensity measurements are given in Table 1 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Description of crystal structure The atomic coordinates and equivalent isotropic displacement parameters are reported in Table 2 . The main bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 3 . The asymmetric structure of K 2 Mg[B 6 O 7 (OH) 6 ] 2 ·4H 2 O is shown in Fig. 1 , which also shows the configuration of the polyborate anion [B 6 O 7 (OH) 6 ] 2− and the coordination environment of K + and Mg 2+ cations. The crystal structure of K 2 Mg[B 6 O 7 (OH) 6 ] 2 ·4H 2 O consists of K O polyhedra, Mg O octahedra and [B 6 O 7 (OH) 6 ] 2− polyborate anions. The structure of the polyborate anion [B 6 O 7 (OH) 6 ] 2− consists of BO 3 triangles (▵) and BO 4 tetrahedrons (T) linked to each other. Only one oxygen atom (O1) is linked to the three boron atoms and all of the other oxygen atoms of the borate anion are linked to two boron atoms. [B 6 O 7 (OH) 6 ] 2− hexaborate groups consist of three six-membered rings in which three boron atoms (B4, B5, B6) are surrounded by three oxygen atoms, and the other three boron atoms (B1, B2, B3) are surrounded by four oxygen atoms. The BO 3 and BO 4 groups are linked by vertices. According to the classification of polyborate anions proposed by Heller [6] , and Christ and Clark [7] , the shorthand notation for [B 6 O 7 (OH) 6 ] 2− in K 2 Mg[B 6 O 7 (OH) 6 ] 2 ·4H 2 O is 6:3▵+3T. The mean B O distances of the BO 3 and BO 4 groups are 1.362 and 1.469 Å, respectively. Potassium cations are surrounded by two oxygen atoms (O14, O15) of water molecules and six oxygen atoms (O9#1, O6#2, O12#3, O13#4, O12#2, O13#1) from [B 6 O 7 (OH) 6 ] 2− . Of these, O9#1 and O6#2 are from B O B bridges, and the others from the BO 2 (OH). These form an irregular polyhedron. The K O distances range from 2.723 to 3.109 Å with a mean of 2.941 Å. Magnesium cations are surrounded by two oxygen atoms (O14, O14#5) of water molecules, and four oxygen atoms (O4, O4#5, O7, O7#5) from four tetrahedral BO 3 (OH) of two [B 6 O 7 (OH) 6 ] 2− anions to form a Mg O octahedron. The Mg O distances range from 2.0517 to 2.1202 Å with an average of 2.0933 Å. In the structure of K 2 Mg[B 6 O 7 (OH) 6 ] 2 ·4H 2 O, MgO 6 octahedra and KO 8 polyhedra, linked by oxygen atoms from H 2 O, form infinite rows. These rows are connected by oxygen atoms from H 2 O to form two-dimensional planes. These 2D planes are connected by [B 6 O 7 (OH) 6 ] 2− anions to form three-dimensional structures. Figs. 2 and 3 give a view of the three-dimensional framework along the b and the c axes. In the structure of this compound, 10 short O O distances are found which can be explained in terms of O H ⋯ O hydrogen bonds ( Table 4 ). The O ⋯ O distances range from 2.628 to 3.003 Å. The [B 6 O 7 (OH) 6 ] 2− anions form layers via hydrogen bonds, between which water molecules, potassium and magnesium cations are intercalated. The calculated bond valences show that the oxygen atoms of the borate anion must be strongly engaged in hydrogen bonds in order to fulfill valence requirements [8] . 3.2 Vibrational spectroscopy The FT-IR and Raman spectra of this compound exhibited the following absorption bands and they were assigned referring to literature [9] . The bands at 3378, 3129 cm −1 in the IR and 3349 and 3132 cm −1 in the Raman spectra are the stretching modes of O H. The band at 1640 cm −1 in the IR spectrum is assigned to the H O H bending mode, which shows that the compound contains crystal water. The bands at 1443, 1366 and 954 cm −1 in the IR spectrum and at 937 cm −1 in the Raman spectrum might be the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of B O in BO 3 , respectively. The band at 1253 cm −1 in the IR spectrum is the in-plane bending mode of B O H. The bands at 1149, 885 and 811 cm −1 in the IR spectrum and at 807 cm −1 in the Raman spectrum are assigned as the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of B O in BO 4 , respectively. The bands at 736 and 651 cm −1 in the IR spectrum are the out-of-plane bending mode of B O in BO 3 . The band at 612 cm −1 in the IR spectrum and the very strong peak at 620 cm −1 in the Raman spectrum are assigned as the characteristic peak of the hexaborate anion, [B 6 O 7 (OH) 6 ] 2− . The bands at 435 cm −1 in the IR spectrum and at 478, 432 and 401 cm −1 in the Raman spectrum are the bending modes of B O in BO 4 . 3.3 Thermal behavior of K 2 Mg[B 6 O 7 (OH) 6 ] 2 ·4H 2 O The thermal behavior of this compound is shown in Fig. 4 . Two weight losses appear in the TG curve. The first weight loss is 9.95% occurring from 100 to 175 °C, which corresponds to the loss of four water molecules and can be compared with the calculated value of 9.84%. The second weight loss is 15.09% occurring from 175 to 600 °C, which corresponds to the loss of 12 hydroxyl groups and is in good agreement with the calculated value of 14.76%. This two-step dehydration process can be expressed as follows: K 2 Mg [ B 6 O 7 ( OH ) 6 ] 2 ⋅ 4 H 2 O ⟶ − 4 H 2 O K 2 Mg [ B 6 O 7 ( OH ) 6 ] 2 ⟶ − 6 H 2 O K 2 Mg B 12 O 20 In the DSC curve ( Fig. 4 ), there are five peaks. The first and second intense endothermic peaks appearing at 146.2 and 232.6 °C are related to the two-step dehydration and formation of the amorphous phase K 2 MgB 12 O 20 . This amorphous phase recrystallizes at 726.6 °C as proven by the exothermic peak. The endothermic peaks appearing at 777.1 and 821.9 °C are related to the melting of the solid phase.

Inflammatory lesions including glomerulitis and peritubular capillaritis, suggestive of endothelial injury, are prominent in this condition but the mechanism underlying this inflammation remains unclear. Here we measured the expression of T-bet (a member of the T-box family of transcription factors regulating Th1 lineage commitment) and its relationship with inflammation in 70 patients with transplant glomerulopathy. Within this cohort, 32 patients were diagnosed with transplant glomerulopathy, 23 with interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy, and 15 with stable grafts. There was a significant increase in T-bet expression in both glomerular and peritubular capillaries of the transplant glomerulopathy group. This expression was strongly correlated with CD4(+), CD8(+), and CD68(+) cell infiltration within glomerular and peritubular capillaries. The expression of GATA3, a Th2 regulator, was rarely found in the transplant glomerulopathy group. Transplant glomerulopathy was associated with diffuse peritubular capillary dilation without reduced capillary density. Moreover, the degree of capillary dilation was significantly correlated with the number of infiltrating CD68(+) cells. Since endothelial injury is a typical lesion that follows alloantibody reactivity, our results suggest that T-bet is involved in the pathogenesis of this glomerulopathy.",

        "abstract": "To explore the prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in congenital heart disease (CHD) and analyze its independent risk factors.During May 2007 to December 2008, a total of 704 consecutive CHD patients initially admitted into Fuwai Hospital were recruited. Their baseline data were collected and right heart catheterization (RHC) was performed. Those with a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) ≥ 25 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa) during RHC were diagnosed as PAH. Multiple Logistic regression was performed to analyze the independent risk factors of PAH.There were 319 males and 385 females with a median age of 5 years. The causes included atrial septal defect (n = 185), ventricular septal defect (VSD, n = 452), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA, n = 48) and a combinations of the above lesions (n = 19). And 280 (39.8%) CHD patients had PAH. Logistic regression analysis revealed that age, systemic artery systolic blood pressure, VSD, PDA and combined lesions were independent risk factors of PAH in CHD (age: OR = 1.017, 95%CI: 1.001-1.033, P = 0.040; systemic artery systolic blood pressure: OR = 0.959, 95%CI: 0.944-0.975, P < 0.001; VSD: OR = 4.402, 95%CI: 2.615-7.411, P < 0.001; PDA: OR = 6.417, 95%CI: 3.079-13.373, P < 0.001; combined lesions: OR = 10.513, 95%CI: 3.641-30.355, P < 0.001).PAH is a common complication of CHD. Age, peripheral artery systolic blood pressure and type of lesion are independent risk factors of PAH in CHD.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A flame retardant and thermally dimensional stable membrane with high permeability and electrolyte wettability can overcome the safety issues of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) at elevated temperatures. In this work, a multifunctional thermoset nonwoven membrane composed of melamine formaldehyde resin (MFR) nano-fibers was prepared by a electro-spinning method. The resultant porous nonwoven membrane possesses superior permeability, electrolyte wettability and thermally dimensional stability. Using the electrospun MFR membrane, the LiFePO 4 /Li battery exhibits high safety and stable cycling performance at the elevated temperature of 120 °C. Most importantly, the MFR membrane contains lone pair electron in the nitrogen element, which can chelate with Mn 2+  ions and suppress their transfer across the separator. Therefore, the LiMn 2 O 4 /graphite cells with the electrospun MFR multifunctional membranes reveal an improved cycle performance even at high temperature. This work demonstrated that electrospun MFR is a promising candidate material for high-safety separator of LIBs with stable cycling performance at elevated temperatures.",

        "abstract": "Although the use of bortezomib alone and in combination with steroids has shown efficacy in AL amyloidosis, its role in combination with high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDM/SCT) is unknown. In this study, we evaluated bortezomib in combination with dexamethasone (BD) for induction chemotherapy prior to HDM/SCT.This was a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing induction therapy consisting of two BD cycles followed by HDM/SCT (BD + HDM/SCT) with HDM/SCT alone in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis. The hematological and organ responses of the patients were assessed every three months post HDM/SCT.Fifty-six patients newly diagnosed with renal (100%), cardiac (57.1%), liver (7.1%), or nervous system (8.9%) AL amyloidosis were enrolled in this study; 28 patients were assigned to each arm. Two patients died within 100 days of HDM/SCT (3.6% treatment-related mortality). The overall hematologic response rates in the BD + HDM/SCT arm and HDM/SCT arm at three, six and twelve months were 78.5% versus 50%, 82.1% versus 53.5% and 85.7% versus 53.5%, respectively. In the BD + HDM/SCT arm, 15 (53.5%) patients achieved a hematologic response after BD and before HDM/SCT. An intention-to-treat analysis revealed a higher rate of complete remission in the BD + HDM/SCT arm at both 12 and 24 months (67.9% and 70%, respectively) than with the HDM/SCT-only therapy (35.7% and 35%, respectively, P = 0.03). After a median follow-up of 28 months, the survival rates at 24 months post-treatment start were 95.0% in the BD + HDM/SCT group and 69.4% in the HDM/SCT alone group (P = 0.03).Our preliminary data suggest that the outcome of treating AL amyloidosis with BD induction and HDM/SCT was superior to the outcome of the HDM/SCT treatment alone.This trial has been registered at clinicaltrials.gov with the number NCT01998503.",

        "abstract": "This study was designed to evaluate the usefulness of serum cystatin C (CysC) as a marker of renal function in 83 patients with diabetic nephropathy, considering multiple factors including tubular function and body mass index. Serum CysC was assayed using a particle-enhanced nephelometric immunoassay and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was obtained by measuring the plasma disappearance of the isotope (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid. By comparing the correlation of CysC and serum creatinine (SCr) with GFR, it was concluded that CysC may be a better indicator of GFR than SCr in diabetic patients, in both the early hypertransfusion stage and in the late renal dysfunction stage. CysC showed a slightly higher sensitivity for renal function evaluation than SCr in patients with renal tubular dysfunction and moderate to severe proteinuria. In addition, CysC was not affected by the metabolic index. Thus, CysC may serve as an ideal endogenous marker of GFR in patients with diabetic nephropathy.",

        "abstract": "MapReduce has become a popular model for large‐scale data processing in recent years.\n         Many works on MapReduce scheduling (e.g., load balancing and deadline‐aware scheduling)\n         have emphasized the importance of predicting workload received by individual reducers.\n         However, because the input characteristics and user‐specified map function of a given\n         job are unknown to the MapReduce framework before the job starts, accurately predicting\n         workload of reducers can be a difficult challenge. To address this challenge, we present\n         ROUTE, a run‐time robust reducer workload estimation technique for MapReduce. ROUTE\n         progressively samples the partition size of the early completed mappers, allowing\n         ROUTE to perform estimation at run time yet fulfilling the accuracy requirement specified\n         by users. Moreover, by using robust estimation and bootstrapping resampling techniques,\n         ROUTE can achieve high applicability to a wide variety of applications. Through experiments\n         using both real and synthetic data on an 11‐node Hadoop cluster, we show ROUTE can\n         achieve high accuracy with error rate no more than 10.92% and an improvement of 40.6%\n         in terms of error rate while compared with the state‐of‐the‐art solution. Besides,\n         through simulations using synthetic data, we show that ROUTE is robust to a variety\n         of skewed distributions. Finally, we apply ROUTE to existing load balancing and deadline‐aware\n         scheduling frameworks and show ROUTE significantly improves the performance of these\n         frameworks.

        "abstract": "A two-photon fluorescent probe FNTR for nitroreductase was synthesized by using 9,9-dimethyl-2-acetyl-fluoren-7-methylamino (1) as a two-photon fluorophore and a p-nitrobenzyl carbamate group as a recognition domain for nitroreductase (NTR). The probe and the fluorophore were tested under one- and two-photon modes respectively. After reacting with nitroreductase, FNTR had a 130-fold fluorescence enhancement at 563 nm in 10 min and the maximal two-photon action cross-section value was detected as 66 GM at 750 nm. The probe showed a high sensitivity with a detection limit as low as 23.67 ng ml, high selectivity, low cytotoxicity and good photostability. In the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), endogenous NTR was detected in living cells, tissues and zebrafish. Cobalt chloride was used to induce chemical hypoxia to produce NTR, which generated enhanced fluorescence in cells and tumor tissues. Finally, two-photon fluorescence imaging of NTR was achieved in zebrafish at a penetration depth of up to 200 μm.",

Objective: To summarize the rehabilitation outcome of 12 hemophilic arthritis patients treated with total knee arthroplasty, and to describe the coagulation factor VIII monitoring and alternative treatment program in perioperative period. Methods: Take the coagulation factor replacement therapy scheme by Ruijin Hospital as a standard, combining with the actual factor level and experienced surgeon, we operated total knee arthroplasty for the 12 male patients (17 knees) with hemophilic arthritis. Function was assessed using the Cleveland score and the Knee Society Rating Scale. Results and Conclusion: Results were excellent in 8 knees, fair in 3 knees and poor in 3 knees according to the Cleveland score, 1 thigh amputees and 2 patients who suffered from joint fusion surgery were not involved in this score. According to KSS score, average knee score increased from (23.6±9.0) preoperatively to (86.7±12.1) postoperatively, average knee function score increased from (25.2±28.4) preoperatively to (65.7±39.8) postoperatively. For the patients with hemophilic arthritis, reasonable alternative treatment program can promote the recovery of joint function, but it has bigger risk, so caution is necessary.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Electron beam welding (EBW) will be used in the manufacture of the Chinese Fusion Engineering Testing Reactor (CFETR) vacuum vessel (VV). The VV is the main support structure of a fusion reactor, and it has strict requirements on welding quality. To improve the properties of welded joints, EBW with beam oscillation was investigated on 316L austenitic stainless steel with 50 mm thickness. Microstructure and hardness were tested with optical microscope and microhardness tester. The results showed that EBW with beam oscillation improved the weld morphology and uniformity of microstructure. The weld microstructure was composed of austenite and ferrite. The morphology of the ferrite was gradually changed from lathy/skeletal grains in the top layers of the joints to equiaxed grains in the bottom layers. Also, beam oscillation affected the solidification mode of the fusion zone (FZ). At the bottom of the weld with beam oscillation, the solidification mode changed from primary ferrite with second-phase austenite (FA) to primary austenite with the second-phase ferrite (AF). However, microhardness tests demonstrated that beam oscillation had less impact for microhardness. The microhardness of the FZ center line increased along the thickness.",

One hundred and one cases of biopsy-proven severe LN with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) were analyzed in this retrospective study. Another 200 severe LN patients without RPGN were randomly enrolled as a control group. Their clinicopathological data and long-term outcome were compared. There were 76 females and 25 males with an average age of 31.9 ± 14.2 years followed for a median period of 4 years. Compared with controls, patients with RPGN had shorter LN duration (p = 0.008), higher level of creatinine (p < 0.001), severe anemia (p = 0.037), heavier hematuria (p < 0.001), severe tubular injury parameters [NAG (p < 0.001), RBP (p < 0.001), C3 (p < 0.001)], higher scores of AI (p = 0.001) and CI (p = 0.004), higher proportions of glomerular sclerosis (0.033) and crescents (p < 0.001), severe tubulointerstitial lesions (p < 0.001) and interstitial inflammation (p < 0.001), lower rate of complete remission (33.9 vs 68.2 %) and higher rate of treatment failure (46.8 vs 7.9 %). The 3-, 5- and 10-year cumulative renal survival rates of RPGN and non-RPGN patients were 65.1 versus 53.9 versus 42.9 and 96.9 versus 94.9 versus 91.7 %, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that SCr concentration and the proportion of crescents were the most important risk factors for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in severe LN with RPGN (p < 0.001). In conclusion, RPGN occurred in 3.6 % of LN and is associated with severe renal manifestations, serious sclerotic and crescentic glomeruli lesions, severe tubulointerstitial inflammation, atrophy and fibrosis, prominent leukocyte infiltration and worse treatment response. Multivariate analysis revealed that SCr concentration and the proportion of crescents were the most important risk factors for ESRD. 57.1 % of severe LN patients with RPGN might progress to ESRD within 10 years.",

In order to verify the design and key technologies to be used in the future, a 1/8 VV sector mock-up has been designed and fabricated at the Institute of Plasma Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (abbreviated ASIPP). In this paper, the mock-up is used to demonstrate thick austenitic stainless steel plate hot forming, welding, cutting, part segment assembly, and other technologies and developments. The design considerations and criteria of the 1/8 sector mock-up are discussed in detail. Based on these considerations, the main design parameters and characteristics of the 1/8 VV sector mock-up are described, including the inn...",

        "abstract": "Notorious lithium dendrite causes severe capacity fade and harsh safety issues of lithium metal batteries, which hinder the practical applications of lithium metal electrodes in higher energy rechargeable batteries. Here, a kind of 3D-cross-linked composite network is successfully employed as a flexible-rigid coupling protective layer on a lithium metal electrode. During the plating/stripping process, the composite protective layer would enable uniform distribution of lithium ions in the adjacent regions of the lithium electrode, resulting in a dendrite-free deposition at a current density of 2 mA cm . The LiNi Mn O -based lithium metal battery presents an excellent cycling stability at a voltage range of 3.5-5.0 V with the induction of 3D-cross-linked composite protective layer. From an industrial field application of view, thin lithium metal electrodes (40 µm, with 4 times excess lithium) can be used in LiNi Mn O (with industrially significant loading of 18 mg cm and 2.6 mAh cm )-based lithium metal batteries, which reveals a promising opportunity for practical applicability in high energy lithium metal batteries.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the fate of the mesangial IgA deposits in the donor kidney after allograft transplantation.Routine pre-transplant cadaveric donor kidney biopsy and repeated renal biopsies were performed at months 1, 3, and 6 after renal transplantation. The patients, 342 in number, were divided into IgA positive deposition kidney group (group A, n = 83) and non-IgA deposition kidney group (group B, n = 259). There were no significant differences between the two groups' sex, age, time of hemodialysis, warm ischemia time, cold ischemia time, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, level of panel-reactive assay, and the distribution of original disease.Recipients in group A received donor kidney with glomerular mesangial proliferation and marked diffuse granular IgA deposition. All of them showed edema, nephrotic range protienuria, microhematuria, hypoalbuminemia, hypertension, and delayed graft function. Borderline change was higher in group A than in group B, 37.3 and 16.2% (p < 0.001), respectively. Acute allograft rejection was higher in group A than in group B, 31.3 and 19.3% (p < 0.001), respectively. The glomerular mesangial IgA deposits gradually disappeared from the mesangial regions in grafts of acute rejection. Graft survival in both groups was not significant, being 93.8 and 95.6% in 1 yr, and 86.7 and 88.3% in 3 yr.Clinical features of the recipients which received from donor kidney with glomerular mesangial proliferation and marked diffuse granular IgA deposition: edema, proteinuria, microhematuria, hypoalbuminemia, hypertension, and delayed graft function. The presence of IgA deposits on donated kidney, by a possible increase of the immunogenicity of these kidneys, might be a cause of increased rejection. There were no significant differences between the two groups on long-term allograft survival.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics and risk factors of avascular necrosis of the femoral head( ANFH) patients with lupus nephritis( LN). Methodology: Six hundred ninety nine initial-treatment patients with LN( 607 females,and 92 males with a mean age of 28. 4 ± 11. 1 years old) were divided into ANFH group( n = 41) and non-ANFH group( n = 658). The epidemiological and clinical features of ANFH were investigated and the clinical, immunological and pathological differences were compared between the two groups. Univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis were applied for associated impact factors. Results: The incidence of ANFH were 5. 9% during the following 58 months( 42 ~ 94 months),witch was higher in males( 9. 8%) than in females( 5. 3%). ANFH could be observed in patients with type Ⅴ + Ⅲ commonly( 13%),and next were in patients with type Ⅴ( 8. 6%). ANFH was diagnosed during 10 to 88 with a median time of 35 months after treatment,and 78% patients were diagnosed in 4 years. The clinical symptoms of ANFH included hip pain( 70. 7%),hip pain associated with knee or leg pain( 9. 8%),and knee or leg pain( 19. 5%). Compared with non-ANFH group,the patients with ANFH group had higher incidence of Raynaud's sign( 24. 4% vs 12. 2%,P < 0. 05),oral ulcer( 19. 5% vs 10. 5%,P < 0. 05),anemia( 63. 4% vs 43. 8%,P < 0. 05),thromcytopenia( 29. 3% vs 16%,P < 0. 05),ACL positivity( 56. 1% vs 38. 8%,P < 0. 05),and non-remission( 17. 1% vs 3. 2%,P < 0. 05). Multiple factor logistic regression analysis revealed that non-remission( OR = 6. 28,P < 0. 001),anemia( OR =3. 18,P =0. 001),ACL positivity( OR =2. 39,P =0. 012),and membranous lesion in renal biopsy( OR =2. 30, P = 0. 019) were independent risk factors for ANFH patients with LN. Conclusion: The incidence of ANFH was high in patients with LN after making diagnosis of 1 ~ 4 years. Some patients were delayed to diagnose of ANFH for its atypical symptoms. The patients who had no remission for treatment,membranous lesion in renal biopsy and ACL positivity were high risk group of ANFH,and should do MRI test of the hip joint routinely when the time of treatment for 10 months.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To find out the association between endothelial dysfunction and the disease activity markers of endothelial dysfunction in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis(FSGS) at different stages of the disease were assessed. Methodology:Sixty-three patients with FSGS (aged 10 to 59 years) and 32 sex-and age-matched healthy volunteers were included in this longitudinal study. Among these patients, 11 cases complicated with venous thromboembolism (VTE). Markers of endothelial dysfunction including circulating endothelial cells (CECs), von Willebrand factor (vWF), soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) and E-selectin (ES) were assessed at baseline. Markers except CECs were rechecked after 2, 6, and 12 months' treatment. Results:Patients with FSGS had significantly higher plasma levels of CECs, vWF, sTM, VCAM and ES compared to controls. In patients without VTE, the positive rates of CECs, vWF, sTM, VCAM and ES were 48.1%, 92.3%, 96.2%, 67.3% and 28.9%, respectively. Both sTM and VCAM were positively related to serum creatinine. VCAM as well as vWF was also correlated significantly with urine NAG and RBP. After 2 months therapy, 8 cases were lost to follow up, 15 achieved complete remission (CR), 13 got partial remission(PR)and 15 had no response (NR), 1 was withdrawn as she went into peritoneal dialysis. The plasma levels of all the markers studied before and after treatment were not significantly different in NR group, but in PR group, the level of sTM decreased significantly, while the other three markers had no obvious change. Patients who achieved CR had significantly decreased plasma levels of sTM and VCAM, but the levels of vWF and ES did not change significantly. There were 11 patients who obtained continuous complete remission (CCR) during the one year follow up. Markers of endothelial dysfunction in these patients decreased systematically to normal levels except vWF and VCAM, the levels of which remained higher than those of controls. The levels of CECs and vWF were higher in patients with VTE than those without VTE. Conclusion:Patients with FSGS had endothelial dysfunction which is related to the disease activity and VTE complications. Modulation of endothelial function may offer a novel strategy to reduce renal insult and complications.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To explore the clinical and pathological characteristic of heavy chain deposition disease( HCDD) from Chinese patients. Methodology: The clinical and pathological data from eleven patients with biopsyproven HCDD were retrospectively analyzed from Jan,1990 to Oct,2012. Results: They were 4 males and 7 females with an average age of( 48. 2 ± 9. 9) years old( ranged from 34 ~ 65). Nephrotic proteinuria was indentified in 9 cases( 81. 8%),heamturia in 9( 81. 8%),hypertension in 8( 72. 7%),renal dysfunction in 6( 54. 5%),and anemia in 10 cases( 90. 9%). None of them was myeloma by the examination of bone marrow biopsy,and serum mono-IgGλ was detected in 4 from 7 cases( 57. 1%) by serum protein electrophoresis( SPEP). Serum abnormal free light chain( FLC) ratio( < 0. 26 or > 1. 65) was observed in 5 cases( 45. 4%). Hypocomplementemia with C3 and C4 was present in 9 and 7 cases respectively. The levels of urine β-N-Acetyl glucosaminidase( NAG) and retinol-binding protein( RBP) were( 75. 5 ± 38. 2) U /( g·cr) and( 10. 5 ± 10. 7) mg / L respectively. Histological examination showed glomerular nodular lesion in all patients with crescents in 5 cases( range 4% ~ 20%). IF presented the deposition of IgG along glomerular basement membrane and tubular basement membrane in all patients,and on arteriole walls in 8 cases. Subtype of IgG staining indicated IgG1 in 6,IgG2 in one,IgG3 in 2,both IgG2 and IgG4 in one,and both IgG1 and IgG4 in one. The staining of κ、 λ chain was both negative. Dense deposits were identified in glomeruli GBM and along TBM. Conclusion: HCDD characterized by nephrotic proteinuria,hypertension,renal dysfunction and nodular lesion frequently accompanied with g heavy chain and mono IgG1 deposition.",

        "abstract": "AIM:An in vivo study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of Rhein (an anthraquinone derivatives isolated from chinese rhubarab) in plasma of SD rats and Beagle dogs. METHODS:Using a rapid and sensitive HPLC-Fluorescence mothod to determine the plasma concentration of rhein after a single i.v. and i.g. administration to SD rats and Beagle dogs at different dosages. A representative plasma concentration vs time profile was illustrated,and the PK parameters and absolute bioavailability were calculated based on these results. RESULTS:After a single i.g. administration and a single i.v. injection of rhein at high,middle and low dosages to rats,there was a good linear relationship between the AUC and dosage (r>0.99). The estimated half life of rhein had some similarities in three different dosage of i.g. administration and i.v. injection. These indicated a linearity pharmacokinetic behavior of rhein in the studied dosage range. The oral bioavailability of rhein in SD rats of high、middle and low dosages were 16.4%,23.8% and 19.4%,respectively. The pharmacokinetic profiles of rhein to six Beagle dogs show that:after a single i.v. administration of 0.4 mg/kg,and i.g. administration of 20 mg/kg,the estimated half life of rhein were (1.77±0.93) h and (3.25±0.80) h,respectively. However,the oral absolute bioavailability of rhein in Beagle dogs was (49.7±7.4)%. Analysis the subject bioavailability data of each Beagle dog (n=6) and each rat in three oral dosage groups (n=18),showed a statistically significant difference (P<0.01) between this two groups. CONCLUSION:There are some species differences between dogs and rats in absorption behavior.The absorption in dogs is higher than in rats.",

        "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide (HS) is a kind of gaseous signalling molecule that plays pivotal role in various biological processes. So far, it is still a challenge to develop convenient and reliable methods for HS detection in lysosomes. Herein, we developed a novel ratiometric two-photon fluorescent probe LR-HS for imaging HS in lysosomes. Upon the addition of HS (using NaS as a donor) to LR-HS in buffer solution, the azide group is reduced to amino group and subsequently the carbamate ester is cleaved by 1,6-elimination, resulting in a fluorescence emission increase at 541nm and a concomitant emission decrease at 475nm. Under two-photon excitation of 840nm, an 80-fold fluorescence ratio (F/F) enhancement was observed with a wide linear range of 25-2500μM. The detection limit was calculated to be 0.70μM based on 3σ/k method, indicating that the probe can detect HS with a high sensitivity. The probe also shows excellent selectivity toward HS among other biological interference species and features with low cytotoxicity and favorable two-photon properties. Furthermore, LR-HS can easily localize in lysosomes and vividly illuminate endogenous/exogenous HS level and distribution in lysosomes of living SGC-7901 cells.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we constructed a label-free ratiometric fluorescence nanoprobe for ascorbic acid (AA) on the basis of the change in dual-emission signals by the specific reaction between cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) and AA. CoOOH nanoflakes were used as the recognition unit while polymer dots (PFO dots) and gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) served as luminescent units of the nanoprobe. After electrostatic assembly of PFO dots and AuNCs on the surface of CoOOH nanoflakes, the energy transfer between the PFO dots and CoOOH could occur and thereby quench the fluorescence of the PFO dots. When AA was present, CoOOH nanoflakes were reduced to Co2+, resulting in a recovery of the fluorescence of the PFO dots. In the meantime, the generated Co2+ could combine with the surface ligands of AuNCs, accompanied by a reduction in the luminescence intensity of the AuNCs. Therefore, the fluorescence intensity ratio of PFO dots to AuNCs would be related to the concentration of AA. The nanoprobe enabled highly sensitive analysis of AA with a detection limit of 1.9 μM and showed great performance in human serum samples and living cells. This report may not only endow a CoOOH-based nanoprobe with improved ability but also offer a novel strategy for the construction of ratiometric nanoprobes for AA and have potential applications in research into and clinical diagnosis of AA-related diseases.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to examine the frequencies of different subsets of B and follicular helper T (Tfh) lymphocytes in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), and investigate the potential underlying mechanism. A total of 27 patients with IgAN and 10 healthy controls (HC) were recruited for analysis of the frequencies of different subsets of B and Tfh cells. ELISA was used to analyze the concentration of serum interleukin (IL)‑21. The transcriptional levels of activation‑induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in the B cells were determined using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while the translational levels of AID were analyzed using western blotting. The frequencies of circulating memory and activated B cells and Tfh cells were found to be significantly increased in the IgAN groups, compared with those of the HC group, although the number of plasma cells were not significantly different between the two IgAN groups. In addition, the serum levels of IL‑21 were found to be higher in the patients with IgAN, and correlated with 24‑h proteinuria. IL‑21 also enhanced the expression levels of AID in the B cells. The data of the present study revealed that the high levels of memory and activated B cells and Tfh cells were positively associated with the progression of IgAN, and that this may be mediated by the overexpression of AID, which is potentially regulated by IL‑21.",

We found that level of miR-21 was up regulated in both glomerular and tubular-interstitial tissues of patients with IgAN. Enhanced expression of miR-21 mainly located in podocytes and tubular cells. Mesangial cell derived cytokines contributed to the increase of miR-21 in podocytes and HK2 cells. IgA-HMC medium prepared with pIgA from IgAN, lead to obvious fibrogenic activation, evidenced by the loss of Podocin and CD2AP in podocytes, loss of E-cadherin and Megalin in HK2 cells and increase of FN and Col I in both cells. miR-21 targeted PTEN in these cells. Expression of PTEN was decreased and phosphorylation of Akt was increased in podocytes and HK2 cells exposed to the medium prepared with pIgA from IgAN. Inhibition of miR-21 preserved the expression of PTEN, prevented the activation of Akt and inhibited the fibrogenic activation in podocytes and HK2 cells exposed to the IgA-HMC medium prepared with pIgA from IgAN. In conclusion, our study suggests that inhibition of miR-21 prevents fibrogenic activation in podocytes and tubular cells by preventing PTEN/Akt pathway activation in IgAN.",

A series of NW trending tight anticlines and the gentle synclines in the between constitute the structural framework of the area. Research shows the study area underwent mainly two stages of deformation since Mesozoic: (1)during Early to Middle Jurassic, the area was mainly dominated by extension and featured by the formation of the dustpan-like faults; and (2)during Shizigou Period to present, the area has been controlled by the SWNE trending compression. The formation of Jiandingshan anticline started in Shizigou Period, and the underlying early depression-controlling normal fault was inverted because of compression, forming large scale fault-propagation folds. The formation of Nanyishan anticline started in Qigequan Period, which was formed by a shallow anticline superimposed on a deep one, the deep anticline was a large scale faultpropagation fold, while the shallow one was a box anticline similar to detachment fold which was formed above the fault by the opposite thrust of two step thrust faults which forming Type-I triangle zone. The forms of Nanyishan anticline and Jiandingshan anticline are relatively integrated, the formation time of structure matches the time of maturity and migration of oil and gas well, indicating very favorable oil and gas exploration prospect.",

Methodology:Sixty-five patients with DN whose proteinuria more than 2.5g/24h,serum creatinine (SCr) less than 265.2 μmol/L,younger than 70 years old and no cardiovascular events in the past six months,were enrolled in this study. They were randomized divided into two groups:TW treatment group (n=34,treated with TW 120 mg/d for 3 months,and then tapered to maintenance dose of 60 mg/d for 3 months)and ARB control group (n=31,treated with valsartan 160 mg/d for 6 months). At the end-point,the decrease of proteinuria,the increase of SCr and the side effects of TW were evaluated,and the clinical and pathological factors which influence the therapeutic effect were also investigated. Results:At the treatment end-point,the level of proteinuria was dramaticly decreased in TW group compared with that of baseline [(4.99±2.25) vs (2.99±1.81)g/24h,P<0.01],and the percentage of the decrease at month 1,3,and 6 was 32.9%,38.8%,and 34.3% respectively. But the level of proteinuria in ARB group was not significantly decreased,the percentage of the decrease were 1.05%,10.1%,and-11.7% respectively. The increase ratio of SCr in ARB group was significantly higher than that in TW group(36.9% vs 20.3%,P<0.05)and the decrease ratio of eGFR in ARB group was also significantly higher than that in TW group(24.6% vs 13.7%,P<0.05). No statistics difference of side effects was observed between the two groups. Conclusion:Tripterygium wilfordii was a novel effective and safe drug for treatment of DN patients with heavy proteinuria.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To develop a fast and effective method for determining whether goat milk powder is adulterated with hydrolyzed animal protein(HAP).Methods: L-Hydroxyproline was used as an indicator of the existence of HAP.Samples were hydrolyzed under the assistance of microwave before colorimetric determination of L-hydroxyproline.The microwave-assisted hydrolysis process was compared with the conventional wet hydrolysis process.Results: The optimal microwave-assisted hydrolysis conditions of sulphuric acid concentration microwave power and hydrolysis time were 4 mol/L,720 W,and 45 min,respectively.Substantially identical results for the determination of L-hydroxyproline content in HAP and synthetic products adulterated with L-hydroxyproline were obtained from both hydrolysis processes with a RSD between-4.5% and 1.6%.The method allowed rapid determination of whether goat milk powder is adulterated with HAP,with high accuracy and reproducibility.Moreover,an excellent linear relationship was found between L-hydroxyproline concentration and absorbance with a determination coefficient of 0.9968.Spike recoveries between 86.24% and 91.30% were obtained.Thus,the requirements for the colorimetric determination of L-hydroxyproline were met.Conclusions: Microwave-assisted hydrolysis can shorten the sample pretreatment time from 16 h to 45 min.The method offers the advantages of rapidity,simplicity,good reproducibility and high recovery.",

        "abstract": "Glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs) contribute to renal injuries in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Here we profiled microRNAs (miRNAs) in GEnCs treated with conditioned medium from human mesangial cells in vitro. Levels of miR-223 in GEnCs decreased after incubation with the medium prepared with pIgA from patients with glomerular endothelial proliferation and were also decreased in the glomerular tissues of patients with glomerular endothelial proliferation. Mesangial-derived IL-6 caused miR-223 levels to decrease. The addition of exogenous miR-223 inhibited cell proliferation, ICAM-1 expression, and monocyte adhesion. The NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathways collaborate during the activation process. MiR-223 mimics inhibited the nuclear localization and DNA binding of p65 and STAT3 but had no effect on the expression of upstream molecules. Instead, importin α4 and α5 (multipurpose nuclear transport receptors), validated as targets of miR-223, were responsible for the nuclear transport of p65 and STAT3. Importin α4 and α5 siRNA inhibited the nuclear localization of p65 and STAT3 and prevented cell proliferation and monocyte adhesion. The level of miR-223 in circulating endothelial cells was decreased and related to the clinical and pathological parameters. Thus, miR-223 downregulation promotes glomerular endothelial cell activation by upregulating importin α4 and α5 in IgAN. Monitoring the level of miR-223 in circulating endothelial cells may provide a noninvasive method for evaluating the severity of IgAN.",

Methodology:Four hundreds and eighteen biopsy-proven MN patients were enrolled in this clinical study. The results were compared with those of previous published reports to observe whether any differences between Japanese and Caucasian patients. Results:(1) Totally 29.7 MN patients were idiopathic. (2) The average age of patients with idiopathic MN was (43.9±13.1) years old. The male ratio to female in this group was 1.53∶1. The manifestation included proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome and hypertension. The level of proteinuria more than 3.5 g/24h was 39.5. (3) In the idiopathic MN, more male patients suffered hypertension(37.3 vs 18.4,P<0.05)and excessive proteinuria(P>0.05)than the female patients did. 4. The original disease of the secondary MN patients included autoimmune diseases(66.3)、infections(17.0)、diabetes(9.52)、tumours(4.08)and renal toxicity(4.08)and the most common disease was systemic lupus erythema (SLE) (56.1)、hepatitis B(16.3)and diabetes(9.52). Conclusion:Idiopathic MN is more common in male and middle age patients. Nephrotic syndrome is relatively scarce. Hypertension and heavy proteinuria is more common in male patients, which indicates the prognosis of male MN patients might be inferior. SLE, hepatitis B and diabetes are the most common original diseases in Chinese patients.",

Plasma concentrations and genetic analysis of apoE were completed. Glomerular depositions of apoA, apoB and apoE were detected using monoclonal antibodies on cryostatic sections in all patients.All 16 patients presented with edema; 14 presented with nephrotic syndrome. Anemia, microhematuria, hypertension and abnormal levels of serum creatinine were detected in 12 patients (75%), 11 patients (69%), 8 patients (50%) and 6 patients (37.5%), respectively. All the patients showed hypertriglyceridemia, while only 7 showed slight hypercholesterolemia. The characteristic features of hyperlipidemia in these patients were approximately in accord with those of type IV hyperlipoproteinemia. Concentrations of apoB correlated with urine protein, triglycerides and cholesterol (r=0.558, p=0.038; r=0.6, p=0.023; r=0.65, p=0.012; respectively). No correlation was found between serum level of apoE and clinicopathological features in patients with LPG. The genotype of apoE-epsilon3/epsilon4 is the predominant one in Chinese patients with LPG. No mutated forms of apoE were found, compared with previous reports.Unique clinicopathological and genetic features were found in this group of Chinese patients with LPG compared with the general population, including lower serum levels of apoE and cholesterol, as well as anemia and microhematuria. Multiple factors other than apoE were involved in the pathogenesis of LPG.",

        "abstract": "Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) is a multi-organ systemic vasculitis, which shares many clinical, histological and immunological features with IgA nephropathy (IgAN). To address whether these two diseases have a common genetic background, the polymorphism of the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) gene has been analyzed using PCR in patients diagnosed with HSPN (N = 43) and IgAN (N = 97), together with normal controls (N = 98) and patients with acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis (APGN), under the concept that IL-1 might play an important role in mediating pathogenesis of vasculitis and glomerulonephritis. It was found that the allele frequency and carriage rate of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist allele (IL1RN*2) of the IL-1ra gene increased significantly in HSPN patients as compared to IgAN (P < 0.01), APGN (P < 0.05) and normal subjects (P < 0.01). Interestingly, varied carriage rates of IL1RN*2 were found among various groups of IgAN patients presenting with different clinical manifestations. The carriage rate of IL1RN*2 was significantly higher in patients with recurrent gross hematuria than other groups of IgAN patients (P < 0.01). Furthermore, although the carriage rate of IL1RN*2 was higher in HSPN (46.5%) than average IgAN patients (26.8%; P < 0.01), there was no significant difference in the carriage rate of IL1RN*2 between HSPN and those IgAN patients with recurrent gross hematuria (42.8%l P > 0.05). It suggested that the IL1RN*2 allele might be a genetic marker shared by HSPN and a special group of IgAN patients with recurrent gross hematuria. Our preliminary observation provided a genetic evidence to support the hypothesis that HSPN and certain subgroup of IgAN are closely related diseases. Such an association of the gene polymorphism of IL-1ra between HSPN and IgAN with recurrent gross hematuria might serve as a key to explore their pathogenesis and eventually a specific intervention.",

Amino terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a useful target of CHF treatment. The purpose of this study was to assess the short-term effect of positive pressure ventilation (PPV) on the plasma concentration of NT-proBNP in patients with both CHF and SA.One hundred and five patients diagnosed with CHF participated in the study. Medical history was recorded, and Doppler echocardiography and overnight polysomnography were performed. Seventy-seven patients were diagnosed as having SA. Patients with CHF and SA were randomly assigned to receive medical therapy alone (12 patients) or with the addition of PPV (14 patients) for 2 - 5 days.Plasma NT-proBNP concentration was measured in 77 patients with CHF and SA. The plasma level of NT-proBNP was associated with the severity of CHF. Subjects with higher degree of NYHA class showed higher a level of NT-proBNP. After PPV treatment, the apnea-hypopnea index decreased (P < 0.001), the lowest SaO2 increased (P < 0.001), and the plasma concentration of NT-proBNP decreased as compared to the baseline levels (P < 0.05).The plasma levels of NT-proBNP could reflect the severity of CHF, and PPV treatment could decrease the plasma NT-proBNP level in patients with CHF and SA.",

Disadvantages of time consuming and inaccurate calculation results with MCNP4C when calculating the deep penetration problems are avoided by step calculation. When re-building the model, the optimization problem of shielding design for revolving door is converted into a combined optimization problem of shielding materials. Characteristic statistic algorithm (CSA) is combined with ANISN program and then optimization program of shielding design is developed. After searching for large numbers of schemes, the optimal scheme of optCH2 is found, which meets the need of radiation security, economy and mechanical performance of materials. Then optimal scheme is calculated using MCNP4C program and compared with the former ones. The results show that the optCH2 scheme is much better than the original one both in security and economy.",

        "abstract": "Rhein (4,5-dihydroxyanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid) is purified from rhubarb (Rheum officinale), a widely used traditional Chinese herb. In our previous studies, rhein was shown to be effective in ameliorating diabetic renal pathological changes and attenuating hyperlipidemia. Statins have also been proven to ameliorate renal pathological changes associated with diabetic nephropathy (DN) through lipid-dependent and -independent mechanisms. We here study the protective and regulatory effects of rhein on renal injury and dyslipidemia in db/db mice with DN, using simvastatin as the control, and provide information on the mechanisms by which rhein protects against renal damage from DN. The results indicated that urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was reduced after 8 weeks of treatment in the rhein group, and 12 weeks in the simvastatin group. The morphometric analysis revealed that levels of extracellular matrix (ECM) significantly decreased in the rhein group after the full treatment course, but not in the simvastatin group. The more powerful effects of rhein on decreasing transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and fibronectin immunohistochemistry expression in renal tissue were also observed. And the plasma levels of cholesterol (Chol), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and ApoE all decreased in both the rhein and the simvastatin groups. Together, our data suggested that both rhein and simvastatin regulate dyslipidemia. The powerful effect of rhein in renal protection is due to its widespread effects. Rhein is a new drug that can decrease lipid levels and protect against DN progression in a different fashion with simvastatin.",

        "abstract": "Scapharca broughtonii is one of the most important Arcidae aquaculture species in the Asia-Pacific region. We aimed to investigate the immune responses of hemocytes from ark shell S. broughtonii hemolymph against pathogens. Hemocyte ultrastructure and immunological activity in response to Vibrio anguillarum challenge were observed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Before ultrastructure observation, we used the API ZYM semi-quantitative kit to evaluate the levels of hydrolytic enzymes in the plasma and hemocytes following V. anguillarum infection. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was used to investigate the variation in the lysozyme activity and hemocytes following bacterial infection. The results showed that hemocytes were the main defense cells against bacterial infection, whereas plasma played a role in the transport and support of hemocytes. It was presumed that an important function of lysozymes and hydrolytic enzymes in lysosomes was for bacterial digestion. Three major types of hemocytes were observed, namely, red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and thrombocytes (TCs). Scanning electron microscopy showed that the normal RBCs appeared pie-shaped with 10 μm diameter and 4 μm central thickness, whereas WBCs were spherical in shape with varying sizes, 4-8 μm diameter, and included small lymphocytes. TCs were long, spindle-shaped, and 12-20 μm in length. The cell membrane surface was smooth and even for all cells before pathogen challenge. Under transmission electron microscopy, RBCs displayed a limited ability to devour and digest bacteria adherent to the cell surface following infection. Many hemoglobin particles were observed in the RBC cytoplasm. WBCs were very active against bacterial invasion and showed a strong ability to digest and decompose infected and wrapped V. anguillarum through phagocytosis and lysosome fusion. Digestive vacuoles rapidly became transparent and were thought to contain increasing quantities of pathogen-induced lysozymes. WBCs that devoured pathogenic bacteria were prone to deformation as well as adhesion to each other. TCs were rich in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) content in their cytoplasm and were widely connected in a net-shaped structure. Mitochondria in TCs formed clusters upon invasion of V. anguillarum in the hemolymph. TCs disintegrated to release the ER into the plasma to form a mesh that facilitated clotting. The ability of circulating hemocytes to quickly modify their morphologies and stainability suggests that S. broughtonii is endowed with highly dynamic hemocyte populations capable of coping with environmental changes and rapidly growing pathogens.",

        "abstract": "It is known that patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) can have elevated F-FDG uptake in the right ventricle (RV) on PET imaging. This study was designed to assess possible relationship between FDG uptake of ventricles and the function/hemodynamics of the RV in patients with PH.Thirty-eight patients with PH underwent FDG PET imaging in both fasting and glucose-loading conditions. The standard uptake value (SUVs) corrected for partial volume effect in both RV and left ventricle (LV) were measured. The ratio of FDG uptake between RV to LV (SUVR/L) was calculated. Right heart catheterization and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) were performed in all patients within 1 week. The FDG uptake levels by the ventricles were compared with the result form the right heart catheterization and CMR.The SUV of RV (SUVR) and SUV of LV were significantly higher in glucose-loading condition than in fasting condition. In both fasting and glucose-loading conditions, SUVR and SUVR/L showed reverse correlation with right ventricular ejection fraction derived from CMR. In addition, in both fasting and glucose-loading conditions, SUVR and SUVR/L showed positive correlations with pulmonary vascular resistance. However, only SUVR/L in glucose-loading condition could independently predict right ventricular ejection fraction after adjusted for age, body mass index, sex, mean right atrial pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, and pulmonary vascular resistance (P = 0.048).The FDG uptake of RV increases with decreased right ventricular function in patients with PH. Increased FDG uptake ratio between RV and LV might be useful to assess the right ventricular function.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, many companies are embracing the Hadoop MapReduce system for large-data processing with completion time constrains. However, exiting Hadoop schedulers still suffer from the reducer load imbalancing problem. In this paper, we present a novel run-time load balancing method for MapReduce. Our approach predicts the workload of each reduce task at run-time, and assigns the reduce tasks to specified machines based on the estimated workload of reduce tasks dynamically. Therefore, our approach can achieve load balance among machines. The experimental results show that our approach achieves high accuracy while predicting the workload of reduce tasks, and improves the job completion time by up to 23.15%.",

        "abstract": "Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) is a promising Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) drug target. DPP-IV inhibitors prolong the action of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), improve glucose homeostasis without weight gain, edema, and hypoglycemia. However, the marketed DPP-IV inhibitors have adverse effects such as nasopharyngitis, headache, nausea, hypersensitivity, skin reactions and pancreatitis. Therefore, it is still expected for novel DPP-IV inhibitors with minimal adverse effects. The scaffolds of existing DPP-IV inhibitors are structurally diversified. This makes it difficult to build virtual screening models based upon the known DPP-IV inhibitor libraries using conventional QSAR approaches. In this paper, we report a new strategy to predict DPP-IV inhibitors with machine learning approaches involving naïve Bayesian (NB) and recursive partitioning (RP) methods. We built 247 machine learning models based on 1307 known DPP-IV inhibitors with optimized molecular properties and topological fingerprints as descriptors. The overall predictive accuracies of the optimized models were greater than 80%. An external test set, composed of 65 recently reported compounds, was employed to validate the optimized models. The results demonstrated that both NB and RP models have a good predictive ability based on different combinations of descriptors. Twenty “good” and twenty “bad” structural fragments for DPP-IV inhibitors can also be derived from these models for inspiring the new DPP-IV inhibitor scaffold design.",

Mean patient age was 63 years (51-82 years). Five hips presented a dislodgment of polyethylene liner and three hips who had osteolysis around the prosthesis component was performed a bone graft through the metal shell holes. Preoperative evaluation of Harris hip score was 81.7 (range 56-91).Results 16 patients were followed up for 2-6 years, all cases did not present polyethylene-cement-metal shell interface loosening in radiographic evaluation. 3 cases with allograft bone healing was found around the acetabular socket in three patients with allograft. No postoperative infection and dislocation was found in follow-up. The evaluation of Harris Score was 87.6 (range 76-92).Conclusions Simple polyethylene liner exchange is a safe and useful technique in patients with a stable meta shell, this technique preserves acetabular bone stock and permits a well fixation of new polyethylene insert.",

The flame retardant properties of the prepared 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanomaterials were investigated by the thermal analysis method and a vertical combustion test, demonstrating that they had the better behaviors than the non-nanostructure sample. Keywords Nanomaterials Zinc borate Hydrothermal preparation Flame retardant property Thermal analysis 1 Introduction There are many kinds of zinc borates [1] found in nature as well as synthesized in the laboratory. Some of these borates have useful properties. For example, zinc borates with different chemical formula such as 2ZnO·3B 2 O 3 ·3.5H 2 O, 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O, and 2ZnO·3B 2 O 3 are the fire retardant materials used in plastics [2] . However, the zinc borate particles are hardly dispersed in a polymer matrix, which restrains their uses in industry. Besides the sizes, the morphologies of a fire retardant also greatly affect its fire retardant property. Therefore, much attention has been paid to the application of nanometer particles. To date, there are only a few reports on the preparation of zinc borates with nanostructures, such as ZnB 4 O 7 nanotubes [3] and Zn 2 B 6 O 11 ·3H 2 O nanodiscs [4] . Recently, Yuan and coworkers [5,6] have reported 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nano-/microstructures with different morphologies (rod-, wire-, and lamellar-like shapes and microspheres of nano-/microrods) prepared by a PEG-300 assisted hydrothermal method. But their flame retardant properties were not evaluated. In this paper, we report the preparation of two new morphologies—a cluster-like 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanostructure and a 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanoribbon—under hydrothermal conditions, and the evaluation of their flame retardant properties by a thermal analysis method. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of samples All the chemical reagents used in our experiments were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. For cluster-like 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanostructure sample: the mixture of 0.60 g of ZnSO 4 ·7H 2 O, 0.12 g of sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT), 2.0 g of KNO 3 , 10.0 mL of deionized water and 10.0 mL of ethanol was stirred at 50 °C until homogeneous. Then 10.0 mL of 0.2 mol L −1 borax aqueous solution was added dropwise to the above mixture while being stirred for 0.5 h. The final mixture with pH = 6.0 was transferred into a 40 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave. For 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanoribbon sample: 0.95 g borax and 0.9 g boric acid were dissolved in 25 mL of distilled water to give solution A, and 0.71 g ZnSO 4 ·7H 2 O was dissolved in 15 mL of distilled water to give solution B. Both solutions were placed in ultrasonic bath and sonicated at 59 kHz for 30 min. Then the solution B was poured into the solution A slowly, forming a homogeneous mixture which was continued to sonicated for another 60 min. After being added 20 mL of distilled water, the obtained mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave. The above two autoclaves were maintained at 120 °C for 12 h under autogenous pressure and then cooled to room temperature. The resulting white precipitates were obtained by filtration, washed 3 times respectively with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol, and dried in air at 60 °C for 8 h, which were collected for the following characterization. 2.2 Characterization of the samples All samples were identified by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD; recorded on a Rigaku D/MAX-IIIC with Cu target at a scanning rate of 8° min −1 with 2 θ ranging from 10° to 70°), FT-IR spectroscopy (Nicolet NEXUS 670 FT-IR spectrometer in the range of 400–4000 cm −1 with KBr pellets at room temperature) and the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) attached to the following SEM. The sizes and morphologies of the products were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM; Quanta 200, Philips-FEI; before SEM imaging, the sample was coated with thin layers of gold) and transmission electron microscope (TEM; Hitachi H-600). 2.3 Flame retardant evaluation The flame retardant properties of samples were investigated through the thermal analysis method. Wood powder was selected as the blank sample. 20% prepared samples and non-nanostructure sample of 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O were added into the selected wood powder, and the mixtures were stirred until homogeneous, respectively. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the obtained mixture samples was performed on an SDT Q600 thermal analyzer under N 2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 20 °C min −1 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O samples Fig. 1 gives the XRD patterns of the prepared 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O samples. The data of XRD pattern of the prepared nanoribbon sample and corresponding data in the literature [5] are listed in Table 1 . The main characteristic d values of the 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O samples corresponded with those of the reported data in the literature [5,6] and the patent [7] . Furthermore, EDS analysis ( Fig. 2 ) indicates the presence of Zn, B and O atoms. The FT-IR spectra ( Fig. 3 ) of the 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O samples exhibited the following absorption bands and they were assigned referring to the literature [8] . The band at 3458 cm −1 is the stretching of O–H. The peaks at 1380 and 1306 cm −1 might be asymmetric and symmetric stretching of B (3) –O, respectively. The peaks at 1242 and 1119 cm −1 are the in-plane bending of B–O–H. The strong peak at 716 cm −1 is the out-of-plane bending of B (3) –O. The peaks at 534 cm −1 is the in-plane bending of B (3) –O. The peaks at 1028 and 475 cm −1 might be the vibration of Zn–O [9] . These assignments reveal the presence of triangular BO 3 and OH groups in this compound, which are consistent with the structure of Zn 2 (OH)BO 3 [10] . 3.2 Size and morphology of 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O samples The lower magnification and higher magnification SEM images and TEM images of the samples for cluster-like 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanostructure and 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanoribbons are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 , respectively. Both the morphology and size determined by TEM are similar to the SEM images. Fig. 4 (a) and (b) shows that cluster-like 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanostructure consists of nanoribbons with the thickness of about 80 nm, the width of 200–300 nm, and length up to several micrometers. Furthermore, we also observed that these clusters are intersections to each other. As is shown in Fig. 4 (c) and (d), the uniform 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanoribbons were about 50 nm in thickness and about 200–500 nm in width. As a comparison, the SEM images of the 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O non-nanostructure sample are also given in Fig. 4 , which shows that it is the irregular blocks with about 1–5 μm in width and about 1–2 μm in thickness. 3.3 The possible formation mechanism of cluster-like 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanostructure Based on the experimental results, it could be concluded that the formation of such cluster-like 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanostructure is achieved via a self-assembly process. 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanoribbons were firstly formed through conventional nucleation and subsequent crystal growth process. The possible reactions are as follows: [B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2− + H 2 O → 2H 3 BO 3 + 2[B(OH) 4 ] − 2Zn 2+ + [B(OH) 4 ] − → Zn 2 (OH)BO 3 + 3H + Then, AOT might provide a soft template for self-assembly process, which could adsorb the nanoribbons selectively, and further tended to aggregate forming cluster in order to lower the surface energy by reducing exposed areas. This is consistent with the fact that no cluster-like 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanostructure was formed in the absence of AOT in our experiment. In addition, it was the existing positive and negative electric charge in AOT that possibly resulted in the intersections in the clusters. 3.4 Flame retardant properties Fig. 6 shows TG curves of wood powder, wood powder with 20% non-nanostructure sample of 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O, and wood powder with 20% prepared samples of cluster-like 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanostructure and 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanoribbon, respectively. The corresponding mass losses at different temperatures are listed in Table 2 . As shown in Fig. 6 , all the samples had a two-step mass losses between 30 and 700 °C. The first mass losses at 30–150 °C correspond to the loss of adsorbed water in wood powder. The second mass losses at 150–700 °C correspond to the decomposition of wood. From Fig. 6 and Table 2 , it can be seen that the final mass losses at 700 °C are gradually decreased, namely, 92.56% for a, 77.04% for b, and 75.75% for c, and 70.59% for d. Furthermore, the mass losses at any same temperatures are also gradually decreased from samples a to d, indicating that the decomposing rates are gradually decreased from samples a to d. This result shows that the flame retardant properties of cluster-like 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanostructure and 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanoribbon samples are better than that of non-nanostructure one, and the flame retardant property of 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanoribbon sample is better than that of cluster-like 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanostructure sample, which can be ascribed to the less thickness of nanoribbon. As a comparison, we also evaluated the flame retardant properties of prepared samples by a vertical combustion tester (ZBY-1, China). All the tested samples were stirred until homogeneous, and then were pressed into pieces. The results of vertical combustion test are shown in Table 3 . It can be seen that the duration of after flame and the duration of afterglow are all gradually decreased from samples a to d at the same duration of flame application. This result shows that the flame retardant properties are gradually improved from non-nanostructure 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O to cluster-like 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanostructure and to 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanoribbon sample, which corresponds with the result of above TGA test. 4 Conclusions In summary, cluster-like nanostructure and nanoribbon for 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O have been prepared under hydrothermal conditions at 120 °C for 12 h. The flame retardant tests, including the TGA method and the vertical combustion method, showed that the prepared 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanomaterials had the better behavior than the non-nanostructure sample, and the 4ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O nanoribbon sample had the better behavior than the cluster-like nanostructure sample, which showed that the evaluation of flame retardant property of nanomaterials by thermal analysis method was feasible.

Application of digital imaging to pathology made substantial progress over the past decade; it is now in use for education, clinical trials and translational research. Digital pathology evolved as a valuable tool to generate comprehensive structural information in digital form, a key prerequisite for achieving precision pathology for computational biology. The application of this new technology on an international scale is driving novel methods for collaborations, providing unique opportunities but also challenges. Standardization of methods needs to be rigorously evaluated and applied at each step, from specimen processing to scanning, uploading into digital repositories, morphologic, morphometric and computer-aided assessment, data collection and analysis.

        "abstract": "Objective: To explore the protection and therapeutic effect of triptolid on podocyte injury induced by puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) in vitro. Methodology: Conditionally immortalized mouse podocytes were treated with PAN. For the protec tive experiments, the podocytes were pretreated for 30mins with triptolid (3 ng/ ml) before PAN (100 μg/ml) exposure for 24hrs, while for the recovery experimen ts, after 24hr of PAN (100 μg/ml) treatment, the culture medium was changed to medium with or without triptolide (3 ng/ml). The cytoskeleton distribution of po docyte as indicated by F-actin and synaptopodin was observed by fluorescence mi croscopy and flow cytometry. At the same time, the activity of Rho signal pathwa y that mediates actin filament polymerization was analyzed by measure the extent of phosphorylation of the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (MBS), one of the major substrates of Rho-kinase. In addition, the slit diaphragms pro teins, podocin and nephrin, were observed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cy tometry. Results: We found that PAN almost completely disrupted the podocyte actin cytoskeleton, a nd made the disappearance of synaptopodin expression, while triptolide stabilize d the actin filaments, and improved the synaptopodin expression. Rho signaling w as not activated in PAN-induced podocyte injury. Addition of triptolide induced a strong increase in phosphorylated MBS. Y-27632, a specific kinase inhibi tor for Rho, can block triptolide protective effect. We also observed that PAN d ecreased the expression of nephrin and podocin, and disrupt filamentous pattern of podocin in podocytes, which was ameliorated by the treatment with Triptolid. Conclusion: Triptolide can not only provide direct protection of podocytes against PAN-indu ced injury, but also enhance recovery from prior podocytes injury. The protectiv e effect of triptolide may partially contribute to the restoration of myosin pho sphatase activity mediated by Rho kinase. The antiproteinuria effect of triptoli d observed in vivo may be due, at least in part, to its direct effects on podocyte.",

        "abstract": "Obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG) is an important complication of obesity. The pathophysiological mechanism of glomerular injury in ORG is incompletely understood. Gene expression profiles in the glomeruli obtained from renal biopsy samples of patients with ORG were investigated, using a microdissection technique combined with Affymetrix microarray analysis. Six patients presented with obesity, proteinuria, and biopsy-proven ORG were enrolled. Two sex- and age-matched donor kidneys were applied as the controls. Glomeruli were dissected out from renal biopsy samples under microscope, and total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro kit. After two rounds of T7 promoter-based RNA amplification, gene expression profiles of the glomeruli samples were detected using Affymetrix U133A gene chips. Bioinformatic tools were applied to analyze the microarray data. Results of candidate ORG-related genes were further confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry staining using renal biopsy samples of a larger pool of 15 ORG patients. Genes related to lipid metabolism, inflammatory cytokines, and insulin resistance were the most highlighted subgroups that significantly changed in the glomerular gene expression profiles of the ORG patients, compared with the controls. The expression levels of several key genes in lipid metabolism were increased over 2-fold, including low-density lipoprotein receptor, fatty acid binding protein 3, and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1. Moreover, some inflammatory cytokines and their downstream molecules were increased as well, including TNF-alpha and its receptors, IL-6 signal transducer, and interferon-gamma. As the indicators of insulin resistance in the local glomerular cells, levels of glucose-transporter 1, leptin receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, and vascular endothelial growth factor increased, too. In addition to lipid dysmetabolism and insulin resistance, the activation of an inflammatory process in the glomeruli might play a unique role in the development of obesity-related glomerulopathy. Our results expand the understanding of obesity-induced glomerular injuries and shed light on new approaches in the treatment of this disease.",

Due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, security issues have been taken as a critical role in wireless communications. A promising direction toward achieving secure wireless communications is physical-layer security, which is an approach exploiting the randomness of wireless channels to ensure secrecy. Although theoretical study has shown its potential to enhance the secrecy of wireless communications, great challenges remain when transforming the theory into practice. This article investigates strategies for allowing and managing cooperative jammers for security in wireless communications. A cooperative jamming strategy is proposed to deal with eavesdroppers anywhere in the wireless network; then jammer placement algorithms targeted toward optimizing the total number of jammers are introduced.",

        "abstract": "The reduction of podocyte number and density per glomerulus has been linked to the development of proteinuria and the progression of disease in patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). However, it has been recognized that measurement of podocyte number by light microscope is quite difficult because of the complexity of both podocyte and glomerular structure, which is not suitable for clinical research. In our research institute, we used WT1 as podocyte marker to evaluate the podocyte lesion.In our experiment, we selected the C-terminal antibody of WT1 to stain the nuclei and the N-terminal antibody of WT1 to stain the cytoplasma of podocytes. Forty patients were enrolled with type 2 diabetes and proven to have DN by renal biopsy analysis. DN patients were classified into three groups based on the degree of proteinuria: microalbuminuria (n=10, 30-300mg/24h), overt proteinuria (n=15, 0.5-3.5g/24h), and heavy proteinuria (n=15, >3.5g/24h).The results demonstrated that the podocyte number was markedly decreased in patients with DN (30-51% reduction). There was a significant negative correlation between the proteinuria and both podocyte density and number. The cover area density of podocyte cytoplasma in glomerulus was also significantly decreased in all DN patients (39-80% reduction). A significant inverse correlation was observed between the cover area density and the degree of proteinuria. The correlation coefficient (r=-0.85) was much higher than that between proteinuria and podocyte density (r=-0.56) or podocyte number (r=-0.36).In conclusion, podocyte damage occurred in patients with DN, even in the early stage and became more dramatic during the course of proteinuria progression. WT1 staining, using the polyclonal antibody to stain the nuclei and monoclonal antibody to stain the cytoplasma of podocytes together, is a valuable alternative technique in the study of podocyte injury.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the curative effect of baofukang suppository and interferon in low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia(CIN1)and to compare their effects in clearing human papilloma virus(HPV).Methods From March 2004to March 2011,369cases with CIN1and HPV infection were enrolled in this study.Patients were divided into baofukang group(group 1,113cases),interferon group(group 2,143cases)and control group(group 3,113cases).All patients were under follow-up for 24months by using liquid-based cytology test combined with high-risk HPV test(HC-Ⅱ)every 6to 12months.If the cervical cytology indicated as ASC-US or more severe lesion and/or HR-HPV positive,colposcopy and biopsies were performed.Results There was no progression case and the persistence and regression rate of CIN1had no statistical difference between three groups at6months.At 12months and 24months,patients in group 1had lower rate of persistence and higher rate of regression than that in the other two groups,and they had statistical differences,but not between group 2and group 3;as for the progression rate,no statistical difference between the three groups.At 24months,group 1had higher clearance rate of HPV than that in the other two groups(P<0.05).Conclusions Baofukang suppository can promote the CIN1regression and HPV clear,and increase the rate of negative-inverted distinctly,while interferon had no such effects.",

        "abstract": "To study the amplification of human telomerase RNA component (hTERC) gene in the cervical exfoliated cells from natural population in Shenzhen and to explore its relationship with human pappiloma-virus (HPV) infection, abnormal cervical cytology and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).Three hundred and eighty-eight women, 30 - 59 year-old and having normal intelligence in a community of Shenzhen, were examined with liquid-based cytology. Human pappiloma-virus (HR-HPV) was tested by hybrid capture II (HC-II) and hTERC gene detection by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Patients with ASCUS and above lesion, and/or positive HR-HPV results and/or amplification of hTERC gene were examined by colposcopy, multiple biopsies of cervical quadrant and pathology.The frequencies of CIN I, II, III, cervical cancer were 55 (14.18%), 4 (1.03%), 9 (2.32%) and 1 (0.26%) respectively, with the rate of hTERC gene amplification as 8.76%. There were significantly differences of hTERC amplification among the samples with different cytological and histological lesions as well with HPV infection (P < 0.01). (1) The positive rate of HPV infection was 17.01%; the positive rates of hTERC gene amplification were 19.70% in HPV positive and 6.52% in HPV negative samples and the results were significantly different (P < 0.01). (2) Cytologically, the rates of hTERC gene amplification appeared to be as follows: NILM (5.97%), ASCUS (18.75%), LSIL (10.00%), ASC-H (66.67%), HSIL (100.00%). There was a marked increase of hTERC amplification in patients with HSIL and above lesions (P < 0.01). (3) On histology findings, the rates of hTERC gene amplification were as follows: NILM (0%), CIN I (5.45%), CIN II (50.00%), CIN III (77.78%), and invasive carcinoma (100.00%). There was a marked increase of hTERC amplification in patients with CIN II and above lesions (P < 0.01).There was a close correlation between amplification of hTERC and histological as well cytological lesions which increased progressively along with the severity of cytological and histological grade. The evidence of hTERC, with or without amplification, might serve as a prognostic indicator to measure the grade of lesion.",

Patients were followed up for 6 months or longer after antiviral therapy was stopped. Serum HBV DNA level at cessation was detected by a highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction assay with detection limitation of 2 IU/mL.Of all the 72 patients, 42 patients (65.3%) relapsed after NA cessation. The detectable rate of the trace amount of HBV DNA at cessation was 41.7% by highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction reagents. The detectable rate of patients with consolidation treatment duration of <18 months was higher than that with consolidation duration of ≥18 months (47.5% vs. 15.4%, P=0.034), and the detectable rate of patients with HBeAg seroconversion within 6 months of treatment was lower than that of ≥6 months (25.0% vs. 61.5%, P=0.036). The residual amount of HBV DNA and detectable rate at cessation showed significant differences between relapsed and nonrelapsed patients (130.4±420.90 vs 44.6±155.16 IU/mL, P=0.004; 55.3% vs. 16.0%, P=0.001). The cutoff value predicting relapse was 2.24 IU/mL, with a sensitivity of 0.553 and specificity of 0.840.Residual amount of HBV DNA in serum at NA cessation is associated with HBV relapse.

We evaluated and compared the two groups.Pulmonary abnormalities and decreased exercise capacity are common in IDCM and IPAH. Little is known about the differences in these two syndromes.Sixty-three patients were involved the study, 23 with IDCM and 40 with IPAH. All patients underwent pulmonary function testing at rest and CPX.Patients with IPAH had a higher peak respiratory frequency (32.40 ± 7.88 vs 29.60 ± 6.50 b/min), peak dead space volume/tidal volume (29.33 ± 4.55 vs 26.30  ± 3.31%), peak end-tidal partial pressure of O2 (125.18 ± 5.88 vs 115.17 ± 6.06 mm Hg), peak minute ventilation/CO2 production (50.14 ± 13.26 vs 33.50 ± 6.80 L/min/L/min), and a lower peak oxygen uptake (1262.70 ± 333.34 vs 742.76 ± 194.72 ml/min), peak minute ventilation (38.20 ± 13.07 vs 45.33 ± 12.31 L), peak oxygen uptake/heart rate (5.11 ± 1.47 vs 9.43 ± 2.79 ml/b) and peak end-tidal partial pressure of CO2 (23.73 ± 5.39 vs 35.30 ± 5.45 mm Hg) during exercise.Compared to IDCM, patients with IPAH had worse pulmonary function and exercise capacity resulting from severe ventilation/perfusion mismatching and gas exchange abnormalities.",

However, the measurement results show that there are dimensional errors between the design model and each PS which has been made. This means that the welding grooves cannot be machined directly according to the design model. So, the method of reverse engineering is used to achieve the 3-D model of each PS which has been made. Based on this 3-D model, the model for CNC machining can be designed. At the same time, the machining equipment for PS is a three-coordinate CNC floor-type milling and boring machine which needs a datum plane when it is milling. Considering each PS has a complex surface profile, 3-D datum transformation is used for solving the problem of lacking the machining benchmark. At present, based on these two methods, the machining work of welding grooves for eight PSs has been completed which has met the requirements of assembly and welding.",

Results:They were 7 males and 4 females with an average age of 28.5±12.7 years old ranged from16 to 50.All patients with biopsy-proved podocytopathy,Among them,8 cases used full-dose methylprednisolone (48 mg/day),and 3 cases used prednisone (50 to 60 mg/day).At the 8th week,11 patients (100%) had total remission.However,all of them developed pulmonary infection after taking glucocorticosteroids within 9~16 weeks,with an average time of 13±2 weeks.They complained of progressive dyspnea and fever,cough and a little white sputum.Their temperature was higher at 39.9±0.8℃ (38.9 to 41.2℃).Rapid progression was observed in the patients,with difficulty breathing and severe hypoxemia as the significant symptoms.The oxygenation indices were below 200 with an average of 118±42.1 (57.5 to 200).Coarse breath sounds was heard initially and a few wet and dry rales later on lung auscultation.Chest CT or chest radiography was suggestive of bilateral diffuse interstitial inflammation.Laboratory examination revealed a lower level of cellular immune function and reduced count of peripheral blood lymphocytes(539±166/μl),as well as significantly decreased CD4+ T lymphocyte count at (133±45.4)/μl,IgG and IgM levels were with the normal range.All patients were given suspected diagnosis of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and need ventilatory support therapy.The triple therapy of antiinfection drugs was SMZ,micafungin and methylprednisolone.Six patients required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT),one of them given extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy (ECMO).After therapy,8(72.7%) patients recovered and 3 (27.3%) died or gave up treatment.The average ICU stay was 18±7.0 days (11 to 33),and the overall average length of stay (24±14) days (13 to 55). Conclusion:steroid-sensitive patients who were treat with glucocorticosteroids for their podocyte injury may appears severe pulmonary infections even though they had complete remission.Regard to immunodeficiency,the disease can rapidly progress and mortality is high.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the preventive and therapeutic effect of triptolide on puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced (nonimmune-mediated) nephrosis rats and its effe ct on podocyte injuries. Methodology: An animal model of nephrosis induced by PAN was established by single intravenou s injection of PAN. These SD rats were divided randomly into normal control, PAN nephrosis control, triptolide-preventative group and triptolide-therapeutic g roup. At each time point, the blood and urine samples were collected, and renal tissues were processed after killed. The 24h urinary protein excretion and blood biochemistry parameters were measured by routine methods. The glomerular morpho logy and podocyte ultrastructure were observed by light microscopy and transmiss ion electron microscopy respectively. The foot process width was examind by morp hometric method. The nephrin and podocin expression and distribution change were determined by indirect immunofluorescence staining. Results: In both of triptolide-preventative and therapeutic groups, the nephrotic syndro me of PAN rats was significantly improved compared with that in PAN nephrosis co ntrol. Their urinary protein excretion was decreased, plasma albumin was increas ed, and high cholesterol/triglyceride levels were remission. Meanwhile, the degr ee and area of podocte processes effacement was significantly reduced in both of triptolide-preventative and therapeutic groups. A minor of podocte processes e ffacement was left on 14th day, and podocyte processes morphology was rest ored to normal on 21st day. The expression and distribution of nephrin and podocin was also significantly improved by triptolide. On the 10th day, c ompared with that in PAN nephrosis control, not only the expression of nephrin a nd podocin increased, but also the distribution of them appeared to be continuou s linear. The expression and distribution of nephrin and podocin almost recovere d on 14th day and completely restored to normal on 21st day in both of triptolide-preventative and therapeutic group. Conclusion: Triptolide has significant preventive and therapeutic effect on PAN-induced pod ocyte injury model. The effects represent the reducing proteinuria, improving po docyte processes effacement, recovering podocye associated protein expression an d distribution, and reversing podocyte injury in nephrosis rats induced by PAN.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by a key agreement scheme proposed by Leighton and Micali (LM-KDS), we present a key establishment mechanism for heterogeneous sensor networks which combines random key pre-distribution schemes and LM-KDS. Using LM-KDS as its building block, proposed scheme divides nodes into groups and distributes a small number of micro key servers among nodes. This scheme consists of two phases. In the first one, some secret information is sent by the TA to every node off-line, then the TA assigns public keying material to every micro key server. In the second phase, if any pair of nodes cannot establish session key using their preloaded keying material, they may get public keying material from a micro key server through an open channel. Besides, all the public keying material preloaded in micro key servers does not need to be secret. This scheme preserves properties of LM-KDS yet takes advantage of flexibility of probabilistic approaches to yield improved resilience against node capture attacks by trading off increased communication overhead and storage complexity.",

        "abstract": "Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have attracted increasing interest owing to their excellent properties in chem/bio sensing. And DNA is the most frequently used biomolecule to functionalize the nanoparticles. However, there is still an urgent need for an effective and convenient strategy to assemble DNA strands on UCNPs. Herein, we utilized polydopamine (PDA) to coat hydrophobic UCNPs by a water-in-oil microemulsion method, which were then assembled with DNA through hydrogen bonding and π–π stacking interactions between the nucleotides of DNA and the aromatic groups of the PDA shell on the surface of the UCNPs. This strategy exhibited several merits such as decreasing the random coordination between phosphates of the DNA backbone and lanthanide ions of the UCNP surface and retaining the intrinsic DNA biorecognition functions for targets. A proof-of-concept biosensor for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) based on luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) was constructed using CEA aptamer-stabilized silver nanoparticles (Apt-AgNPs) as the energy acceptor. Due to the strong affinity between CEA and its aptamer, the upconversion luminescence was recovered in a [CEA]-dependent manner. This facile assembly strategy can be extended to various targets and sensors by altering the aptamer.",

        "abstract": "Objective:In order to test for the presence of a circulating factor(CF),an in vitro method for quantifying glomerular permeability in rats was utilized.In this study,we utilized podocytes to determine the presence of CF and explore the mechanism by which it overcomes the glomerular permeability barrier.Methodology:Eighty sera from patients with FSGS and Seventy from patients with podocytopathy were investigated.Sera from nephrotic syndrome patients with MN,IgMN,IgAN,DN,LN or MPGN were also studied as controls.Differentiated podocytes were treated with 1ml of medium containing 10% vol/vol of serum from patients for 24hrs.Changes in both F-actin and ZO-1 patterns in podocytes were observed by confocal microscopy.At the same time,Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with 0.1 ml serum from above patients.The level of urine protein in the rats were determined at 0h,4h,8h,12h and 24h.To characterize the nature of CF,the sera were processed before treated podocytes as decomplement,removed lipoproteins by dextran sulfate and calcium chloride,removed IgG by 70%(NH4)2SO4 saturation,pre-incubated with the homologous nephrotic urine or normal sera,or neutralized with IL-13 antibody.In order to understand the underlying effect of CF on podocytes,the activity of JAK-STAT 6,MAPK and RhoA signal pathways were studied using western blot.Results:CF presented in 16.3% of FSGS and 12.2% of podocytopathy patients by using podocytes as a target cell,while CF was not detected in other nephrotic patients(IgAN,MN,MPGN,LN,DN).Sera from certain patients with FSGS and podocytopathy destroyed the cytoskeleton of podocyte,as well as damaged the tight junction of podocyte.Injection of the sera which damaged podocyte induced proteinuria in rats as fast as 8h(0.5±0.03 mg/ml vs 0.2±0.01 mg/ml control sera,P<0.01),and as peak as 12h.Although decomplement,precipitated at 70% ammonium sulfate and removed lipoproteins,the positive sera still contained the CF activity.Activate the cellular signal transduction pathways(RhoA,STAT and p38 MAPK).Coincubation of serum with homologous urine and normal serum could not neutralize the activation of CF,it did not support the missing factor hypothesis.In addition,IL-13 neutralizing antibody did not affect the bioactivity of CF.Proteins from podocytes injuried by sera from patients with FSGS and podocytopathy showed activation of STAT6,p-38 MAPK and RhoA signal pathways as early as 30 min.Conclusion:Ciculating factor,which was specificity presence in patients with FSGS and podocytopathy,directly acted on podocytes and disrupt cytoskeleton as well as cell-cell interation.Multiple signal pathways could be involved in the effect of CF on podocytes.Our study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of FSGS,thus potentially contributing to the design of individual therapeutic strategies in FSGS.",

        "abstract": "Acute renal failure (ARF) related to crush syndrome is usually treated with hemodialysis. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) has seldom been adopted in this situation due to the main drawback of continuous anticoagulation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA)-CVVH in two crush syndrome patients following the Wenchaun earthquake.Two victims from the Wenchuan earthquake in Southwest China were admitted to our hospital on May 23, 2008, 11 days after their injury. The total entrapment time under the rubble was 5.5 and 22.5 hrs respectively. They remained oliguric on admission, in spite of vigorous treatment in the local hospital including aggressive fluid infusion, fasciotomy and intermittent hemodialysis. On admission, their serum myoglobin levels were 765 and 829 ng/mL, respectively. Further debridement and drainage were performed. RCA-CVVH was conducted; the citrate containing substitution fluid was infused in a pre-dilution manner at a rate of 4 l/h; calcium was infused through a separate access to the venous inlet of the double lumen catheter. The infusion rate was adjusted according to the serum ionized calcium and whole blood activated clotting time (WBACT). A low dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was infused at the rate of 150 approximately 300 U/h simultaneously for anticoagulation after anemia had been corrected and their wounds were stable. RCA-CVVH was substituted by conventional CVVH and LMWH anticoagulation when case 2 complicated with hypoxia.RCA-CVVH was well tolerated, hemodynamic status was stable, and no complications related with RCA-CVVH were noted. The body temperature and WBC decreased to normal range, while anemia and hypoalbuminia were corrected. The levels of serum myoglobin and creatine phosphokinase were also decreased to normal range. Their urine volume increased after 20 and 22 days of oliguria and the tubular function of the patients recovered well. Although the second case encountered acute cholecystitis and acute lung injury in the hospital, both the patients recuperated and neither of them underwent amputation.The present two crush patients have been successfully treated, but due to the limits of the small sample, it is difficult to generalize whether RCA-CVVH is safe enough for crush syndrome with a high risk of bleeding diathesis. Additional investigation with a larger number of patients is required. Fluid equilibrium, nutritional support, prevention of bleeding and infection are fundamental in this situation.",

Anti--coagulated blood was obtained at 1 day before and 4 days after undergoing CVVH, and plasma IL--10 level (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) and HLA--DR expression (flow cytometry) were determined. Thirty healthy subjects were enrolled as controls. In addition, the correlation between IL--10 and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHEII) score was assessed.(1)Altogether, 7 patients died among a total of 43 critically ill patients, the mortality was 16.3%. Eighteen patients had negative cultures during the study (group I), and 19 patients had positive cultures (group II), and in 6 patients positive bacterial culture appeared 72 hours after the beginning of the treatment (group III). (2) The IL--10 level (ng/L) was higher in patients than in healthy subjects [23.46 (46.71) vs. 0.32 (0.45), P < 0.01]. Compared with group I, the levels of IL--10 in group II and III were higher significantly [40.20 (46.44), 41.78 (49.63) vs. 7.33 (21.05), both P < 0.05]. Continuous observation revealed that IL--10 rapidly lowered in group I after treatment [4.50 (7.44) vs. 7.33 (21.05), P < 0.05], while there was no apparent change in patients of other two groups. It was found that IL--10 was significant positive correlation with the APACHEII score (r = 0.71, P < 0.01).(3) HLA--DR was lower in patients than in healthy individuals [21.65% (25.62%) vs. 90.39% (9.80%), P < 0.01]. After CVVH, HLA--DR expression was obviously increased in group I [64.95% (35.03%) vs. 32.45% (45.03%), P < 0.01]. However, there were no significant changes in the other two groups. The patients who died had persistent and extremely low HLA--DR expression.(1)A significant discriminative power of IL--10 levels in predicting disease severity was found among the patients receiving CRRT, and persistently high IL--10 level predicts poor prognosis. (2) Persistently low monocyte HLA--DR expression may indicate concomitant or impending infection in patients receiving CRRT.",

The method is based on the strong inhibitory effect of tiopronin on the multienzyme redox system of hemoglobin, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and H(2)O(2), in which the intrinsic fluorescence of NADH was employed as the detection signal. The calibration graph is linear in the range 6.13 x 10(-7) to 6.13 x 10(-6) M with a detection limit of 1.65 x 10(-7) M and the relative standard deviation of 2.02%. Kinetics in the pseudo-first-order conditions was investigated by stopped-flow spectrofluorometry and the inhibition mechanism of tiopronin was verified of the competitive type.",

In this paper, the thermosetting polyimide (PI) nano-fibers based nonwoven separators have been developed by electrospining technique and followed by thermal imidization and mechanical pressing with improved thermal stability and considerable mechanical strength. The high concentration of tortuous nanopores structure and intrinsic chemical configuration lead to good ionic transport and improved electrolyte wettability. The electrochemical characterization at high temperature of 120 C demonstrates that the LiBOB/PC soaked polyimide nonwovens is an excellent electrolyte system for high temperature operation owing to possessing high oxidative potential, excellent lithium deposition-stripping performance and considerable ionic conductivity. The cells using LiBOB/PC soaked polyimide nonwovens as separator still exhibit stable charge-discharge profiles with quantitative coulumbic efficiency and satisfactory cyclability at 120 C. The superior electrochemical performance at high temperature could endow these polyimide nonwovens promising alternative to PP separators for high power or high temperature application with superior safety characteristic. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

The extraction equilibria of both metals were obtained within 10 min at 30 °C. More than 99.0% Ga(III) and 99.8% Ge(IV) were extracted in a three-stage counter current extraction using an organic system consisting of 20% (v/v) N235, 10% (v/v) TBP and 70% (v/v) sulfonated kerosene at an A/O ratio of 3:1 and 30 °C for 10 min. Over 99.0% Ga(III) was selectively stripped from the loaded organic solution by three-stage counter current stripping using 2.5 mol/L H 2 SO 4  at an A/O ratio of 1:2 and 30 °C for 15 min, resulting in a loaded strip liquor containing 3.8 g/L Ga(III). After Ga(III) stripping, 99.8% Ge(IV) was stripped by two-stage counter current stripping using 4 mol/L NaOH at an A/O ratio of 1:3 and 40 °C for 15 min, resulting in a final loaded strip liquor containing 8.3 g/L Ge(IV). A conceptual flowsheet has been developed to recover Ga(III) and Ge(IV) from zinc refinery residues using two-stage leaching with H 2 SO 4  and oxalic acid, subsequently, iron removal with iron powder and solvent extraction with N235 and TBP.",

        "abstract": "Ferritin, the principle cytosolic iron storage protein in the majority of living organisms, has important roles during immune process in invertebrates. Detailed information about ferritin in the ark shell Scapharca broughtonii, however, has been very limited. In this study, full-length ferritin (termed SbFer) was cloned by the rapid amplication of cDNA ends (RACE) method based upon the sequence from the transcriptome library. The cDNA contained a 182 bp 5'-untranslated region, a 519 bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 172 amino acids, a 229 bp 3'-untranslated region, and three introns (902, 373 and 402 bp) embedded in four exons. There was an iron response element (IRE) in the 5'-untranslated region. The deduced amino acid sequence of SbFer possessed many characteristics of vertebrate H type ferritin, shared 63%-91% identity with mollusks and greater identity with vertebrate H type ferritin compared to the L type. The SbFer gene expression pattern examined by quantitative real-time PCR showed ferritin mRNA was expressed in all ark shell tissues examined. The highest levels of expression were found in hemocytes with decreasing levels of expression in foot, mantle, gill, adductor muscle and hepatopancreas. A challenge with Vibrio anguillarum resulted in time-dependent significant upregulation of SbFer mRNA, indicating SbFer participated actively in the bacterial defense process. Further analysis of the antibacterial activity indicated recombinant SbFer could function as an immune antibacterial agent to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Taken together, these results suggested strongly that ferritin of the ark shell is involved in immune defense against microbial infection and it is a constitutive and inducible acute-phase protein.",

        "abstract": "The intracellular viscosity is closely related to many functional disorders and diseases. Especially, abnormal mitochondrial viscosity changes are one of the distinct indications in metabolite diffusion as well as mitochondrial metabolism. In this work, we report a novel fluorescent probe (NI-VIS), which uses quinoline as an acceptor group and employs a TICT mechanism (twisted intramolecular charge transfer) to detect viscosity. NI-VIS features a good mitochondrion targeting ability and near-infrared emission. NI-VIS possesses a highly sensitive response towards viscosity changes in aqueous environments. As the viscosity of a DPBS-glycerol system increased from 1.0 cp to 999 cp, NI-VIS exhibited a hundred-fold enhancement in fluorescence. We demonstrated that after the treatment with ionophores, NI-VIS could identify the variation of mitochondrial viscosity in HeLa cells. The probe also recognized the decrease of mitochondria viscosity during starvation-induced mitophagy. More importantly, NI-VIS was successfully applied to visualize the viscosity variation in cirrhotic liver tissues. Our trial with zebrafish suggested this probe could map the microviscosity in vivo. These findings reveal that NI-VIS can serve as a powerful tool to monitor viscosity of biological samples and shows broad potential applications in the biomedical field.",

Results showed that the growth temperature had remarkable influence on the arsenic diffusion from the Si substrate.

QF displays both one- and two-photon ratiometric responses towards fluoride ions in aqueous solution. QF was enabled to detect exogenous fluoride ions in living cells by a ratiometric method. Two-photon microscopic imaging of fluoride ions in living HeLa cells and zebrafish has also been achieved. QF has been demonstrated to be an excellent fluorescent probe with high selectivity, low cytotoxicity and good photostability. ",

Cyclic voltammetry measurements confirmed that this composite electrode exhibited better catalytic activity compared with pristine CuInS₂ or PEDOT:PSS electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that the composite film constitutes a three-dimensional catalytic network. The DSC using this composite CE can yield 6.50% photoelectric conversion efficiency, which is comparable to that of the conventional platinum CE (6.51%) and better than that of the pristine CuInS₂ (5.45%) or PEDOT:PSS (3.22%) electrode.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the prevalence of high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) genital infection and cervical cancer in adult women from Shenzhen.Cluster sampling was used to investigate the prevalence of HPV infection and cervical cancer from women aged 20 - 59 years old living in Luohu, Futian, Nanshan, Longgang and Baoan districts in Shenzhen from April 2006 to April 2010. All women were detected for liquid-based cytology test (LCT) or Thinprep cytologic test (TCT) and high-risk HPV-DNA test with hybrid capture II (HC-II). All women with ≥ ASC-US by cytology and/or a positive HC-II test were asked to return for colposcopy and four-quadrant biopsy. Endocervical curettage was performed. Pathological finding were used as the gold standard of the diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.10 210 women were involved in the study and 10 017 of them having completed data. The overall positive rate of high-risk HPV-DNA was 16.29%. HPV positive rates in 20-, 30-, 35-, 40-, 45-, 50-59 age groups were 17.37%, 15.59%, 16.33%, 14.74%, 17.16% and 17.98%, respectively. The curve of HPV infection rates in different age groups appeared a 'W' shape. HPV infection rates in the 25-years-olds and 50-59 year-olds groups were significantly higher than the other age groups (χ(2) = 4.50, P = 0.03). The overall prevalence rate of cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN) was 7.52%, of which the prevalence rates of low-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN I) was 5.32% high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN II/III) was 2.21%, cervical cancer was 0.12%. The prevalence of CIN I was significantly higher than the CIN II/III (χ(2) = 134.15, P < 0.001). The prevalence of cervical cancer in 45-age group was 0.12%, the highest. HPV infection rates increased with the grades of cervical lesions including women without CIN as 44.31%, in CINI as 70.73%, in CINII as 86.73%, and in CIN III as 96.75% and in cancer as 100.00%. The HPV infection rates were different in districts (χ(2) = 17.81, P = 0.03), with Futian and Luohu higher than those of Nanshan, Longgang and Baoan district. The prevalence rate of CIN in Baoan was lower than other districts. The CIN prevalence rates were not significantly different among the other districts of Shenzhen (χ(2) = 4.84, P = 0.18).The prevalence of cervical cancer was low in adult women living in Shenzhen, with cervical lesions still in the early stage. Prevention of HPV infection and treatment of CIN were the key points for the prevention of cervical cancer.",

Its ability to improve erectile function has been shown in patients with vasculogenic ED by many randomized-controlled trials against sham procedures. However, the role of LI-ESWT in ED caused by radical prostatectomy (RP) is still questionable because this type of ED was excluded from nearly all clinical studies; it has been investigated in only a few small single-arm trials. This review summarizes preclinical studies on mechanisms of action of LI-ESWT for ED and neurological diseases to explore the potential of this treatment for nerve-impaired ED after RP.",

        "abstract": "Covert wireless communication can prevent an adversary from knowing the existence of useru0027s transmission, thus provide stronger security protection. In AWGN channels, a square root law was obtained and the result shows that Alice can reliably and covertly transmit $mathcal{O}(sqrt{n})$ bits to Bob in n channel uses in the presence of a passive eavesdropper (Willie). However, existing work presupposes that Willie is static and only samples the channels at a fixed place. If Willie can dynamically adjust the testing distance between him and Alice according to his sampling values, his detection probability of error can be reduced significantly via a trend test. We found that, if Alice has no prior knowledge about Willie, she cannot hide her transmission behavior in the presence of an active Willie, and the square root law does not hold in this situation. We then proposed a novel countermeasure to deal with the active Willie. Through randomized transmission scheduling, Willie cannot detect Aliceu0027s transmission attempts if Alice can set her transmission probability below a threshold. Additionally, we systematically evaluated the security properties of covert communications in a dense wireless network, and proposed a density-based routing scheme to deal with multi-hop covert communication in a wireless network. As the network grows denser, Willieu0027s uncertainty increases, and finally resulting in a shadow network to Willie.",

Analysis of the data of this group of patients showed that primary glomerulonephritis (GN) remained the most important and prevalent renal disease in China. The ratio of primary to secondary GN was 2.75:1. However, it is declining progressively in the past two decades with an increment in the incidence of diabetic nephropathy and nephrosclerosis. IgA nephropathy (IgAN) constituted 45.26% of the primary GN, while non-IgA mesangial proliferative lesions were 25.62%. Membranous nephropathy was 9.89% and minimal change disease was 0.93%, remarkably less. The most prevalent etiology of secondary GN was systemic lupus erythrematosus (SLE) (54.3%) followed by Henoch-Schönlein purpura (20.3%), diabetic nephropathy (6.6%), systemic vasculitides (4.0%), and amyloidosis (2.2%). Based on the study of biopsy materials obtained from 607 cases manifesting chronic renal failure, IgAN was identified as the most frequent cause (26.69%) of chronic renal failure.",

        "abstract": "The monocyte function of patients with severe tetramine poisoning and the effects of sequential hemoperfusion (HP) and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) on the immune status of the patients were investigated. Eleven patients with severe acute tetramine poisoning were treated with sequential HP and CVVH. The APACHE II score and Glasgow score were used to evaluate the disease status during the therapy. Blood samples were collected at 0, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. Peripheral monocytes were isolated and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to detect the ability of monocytes to secrete tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10. The number of monocytes was counted at the same time. As expected, three patients died and the clinical manifestations were improved in the other patients. The production of cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10) by monocytes of patients with tetramine poisoning was much lower than normal controls (P<0.001), and was significantly increased after HP and CVVH in the survivors (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.05, respectively). The blood concentration of tetramine was 0.124+/-0.082 mg/l at prehemoperfusion and 0.080+/-0.055 mg/l at posthemoperfusion (P<0.05). It was concluded that there was severe damage to monocyte function in patients with tetramine poisoning, and that sequential HP and CVVH can effectively ameliorated monocyte function and eliminate tetramine from blood.",

        "abstract": "Anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECAs) are thought to be involved in the development of renal allograft rejection. To explore this further, we determine whether AECAs play a role both in predicting the incidence of allograft rejection and long-term outcomes by analysis of serum samples from 226 renal allograft recipients for AECAs pre- and post-transplant. Surprisingly, the presence of pre-existing AECAs was not associated with either an increased risk of rejection or a detrimental impact on recipient/graft survival. Subsequent de novo AECAs, however, were associated with a significantly increased risk of early acute rejection. Moreover, these rejections tended to be more severe with a significantly increased incidence of both steroid-resistant and multiple episodes of acute rejection. The acute rejections associated with de novo AECAs did not correlate with C4d deposition at the time of renal biopsy, but did demonstrate an association with the presence of glomerulitis and peritubular capillary inflammation. Significantly more patients with de novo AECAs developed graft dysfunction. Thus, our prospective study suggests the emergence of de novo AECAs is associated with transplant rejection that may lead to allograft dysfunction.",

The clinical and pathological features were analyzed.There were 47 males and 39 females, aging from 12 to 69 years old. Abnormal urine analysis and gastro-intestinal diseases were two main underlying causes for patients taking aristolochic acid (AA) containing drugs. All patients suffered from renal function impairment. 19 patients (22.0%) presented with acute kidney injury (AKI), while 67 patients (78%) presented as chronic cases. Among them, 31 patients (36.0%) lacked symptoms, 30 patients (34.8%) were accompanied with hypertension, and 26 patients (30.2%) presented with gastrointestinal symptoms. Laboratory examination revealed elevated urine retinol-binding protein (RBP) (90.7%) and urine N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase (NAG) (80.2%). Anemia and glucosuria accounted for 64.0% and 58.1%, respectively. Renal biopsy showed prominent tubular brush border ablation (84.2%) in acute cases, while obvious tubular basement membrane (TBM) thickening (81.4%) and interstitial fibrosis were present in chronic cases. During the follow- up, 11 (57.9%) acute cases gained renal function recovery. They had lower urine RBP level and lower incidence of hypokalemia than the non-recovery acute cases. In the chronic group, 27 patients (40.2%) progressed to endstage renal disease (ESRD), with 11 dialysis and 5 renal transplantation cases.AAN patients usually suffered from renal impairment with an associated history of taking AA containing drugs. Proximal renal tubular dysfunction and structure destroying would be the main positive findings in laboratory tests and renal biopsy. Urine RBP and hypokalemia might determine the outcome of acute AAN patients.",

There lacks routine examinations or gold standard to diagnose peri-prosthetic infection. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of technetium- 99m-labelled triphase isotope scintigraphy in the diagnosis of peri-prosthetic infection following total hip arthroplasty. METHODS: A total of 11 patients with suspected peri-prosthetic infection were selected, with continuous hip pain, prosthesis loosening and abnormal serum indexes, including 7 males and 4 females, with an average age of 63.8 (53-74) years. The average time of prosthesis usage was 14.5 (0.5-30) years. The technetium \"\"-labelled bone scintigraphy images were obtained to observe the density variation of the infection region during the blood flow phase, blood pool phase and late phase and compared with normal lateral limb. Time-radioactive uptake curve was made using software to analyze the diagnostic results. In addition, the diagnostic value of the triple-phase bone scinitigraphy was analyzed using the intraoperative frozen section results (neutrophil < 5 under 10 high power visual fields: no infection). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Of 11 patients, 2 cases showed negative result of triple-phase bone scinitigraphy, and intraoperative frozen section analysis showed < 5 polymorphonuclear cells per high-power field, who underwent one-stage revision surgery; 8 displayed positive result of triple-phase bone scinitigraphy, and intraoperative frozen section analysis showed > 5 polymorphonuclear cells per high-power field, who underwent two-stage revision surgery; 1 case showed negative result of triple-phase bone scinitigraphy but intraoperative frozen section analysis showed > 5 polymorphonuclear cells per high-power field, who also underwent two-stage revision surgery. Results show that positive results of triple-phase bone scintigraphy were related to peri-prosthetic infection, which has great value for revision surgery in combination with histopathological examination.",

Further evidence also showed that low-dose iloprost given intravenously was equally effective as high-dose iloprost in the therapy of systemic sclerosis.Patients with pulmonary hypertension will benefit from inhalation of low-dose iloprost.Sixty-two patients with PH were enrolled and initiated with neubulizedlow-dose iloprost (2.5 µg per inhalation, 6× daily) for 24 weeks in 13 medical centers in China. Efficacy endpoints included changes in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), World Health Organization functional class (WHO-FC), and hemodynamic parameters.Fourteen patients (22.6%) prematurely discontinued the study: 8 due to clinical worsening (6 in WHO-FCIII-IV at baseline), 4 because of protocol change, and 2 patients lost during follow-up. In the remaining 48 patients, 6MWD was increased from 356 ± 98 meters to 414 ± 99 meters (P < 0.001) and WHO-FC improved significantly (P = 0.006) after 24-week inhalation therapy. Cardiac output, cardiac index, and mixed venous oxygen saturation improved significantly compared with baseline (n = 34, P < 0.05). Most of the hemodynamic parameters improved significantly in patients in WHO-FC II (P < 0.05) but not in patients in WHO-FCIII-IV.Low-dose iloprost inhalation significantly improved exercise capacity and functional status in patients with PH. It was well tolerated. The improvement of hemodynamics was confirmed in patients with WHO-FCI-II but not in patients with WHO-FCIII-IV, suggesting the importance of early treatment in patients with advanced disease stages.",

        "abstract": "Objective: By a prospective randomized controlled study, to compare the efficacy of low protein diet supplemented with two kinds of ketoanalogues tablets in treatment of patients with chronic renal failure. Methodology:From May,2010 to Oct,2010,the patients diagnosed as chronic renal failure who regularly visited the outpatient department of Jinling hospital were screened for enrolment. The major inclusion criteria were as following: serum creatinine (SCr) 132～265 μmol/L; stable renal function status without active disease; and primary glomerular disease was supposed to be the primary diagnosis. All patients were recommended to adhere to a diet with protein intake less than 0.6 g/(kg·d) and received the same routine renal protective therapy before being randomly allocated into Keluodi and Ketosteril group supplemented with ketoanalogues tablets Keluodi or Ketosteril, respectively. They were followed at timepoint 0,2,4, and 6th month, for recording of main complains, weight, height and blood and urine tests, as well as body fat and lean weight using bioimpedance analysis method. Results:Each group enrolled 32 patients, with 2 dropouts in Keluodi (KLD) group and 1 dropout in Ketosteril (KT) group. Finally 61 patients were entered into data analysis. There was no difference in baseline values between two groups in age, sex, body mass index, blood hemoglobin,SCr,cystatin C (CysC), endogenous creatinine clearance (CCr), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urine proteinexcretion, drugs intake, and diet protein intake (DPI). No obvious side effects were recorded during the follow up period. At the endpoint, compared with baseline, following parameters had significant declined in both group: weight [0 vs 6th month:KLD group (59.0±8.9 vs 57.8±8.4 kg),KT group (61.8±11.7 vs 60.6±11.3 kg),P<0.05],serum urate [0 vs 6th month:KLD group (483±84.1 vs 439.4±80.1 μmol/L),KT group (485±96.1 vs 426±61.2 μmol/L),P<0.01];following parameters had significantly elevated in both group: serum calcium [0 vs 6th month:KLD group (2.3±0.1 vs (2.4±0.1 mmol/L),KT group (2.3±0.2 vs 2.4±0.2 mmol/L),P<0.01], serum IgG [0 vs 6th month:KLD group(13.8±2.6 vs 15.1±3.2 g/L),KT group (14.3±2.9 vs 15.1±3.7 g/L),P<0.05], urine protein excretion (0 vs 6th month:KLD group (0.41±0.33 vs (0.79±0.78 g/24h),KT group (0.61±0.53 vs 0.77±0.59 g/24h),P<0.01]; following parameter had significantly decreased only in KT group but not in KLD group: serum pre-albumin [0 vs 6th month:KT group (376.5±89.5 vs 318.3±77.0 mg/L),P<0.001;KLD group (393±104 vs 349.4±72.0 mg/L),P>0.05]; following parameter had significantly increased only in KLD group but not in KT group: CCr [0 vs 6th month:KLD group (36.5±13.5 vs 40.1±14.5 ml/min),P<0.05,KT group (37.3±17.8 vs 39.5±17.7 ml/min),P>0.05]; other parameters including body lean weight, serum albumin, serum transferrin, lipids, hemoglobin, SCr, CysC, serum phosphorus and eGFR had no significant changes. Conclusion:Low-protein diet supplemented with two kinds of ketoanalogues tablets has no significant different effects in treatment of patients with chronic renal failure, in regarding nutrition status and renal function preservation, as well as side effects.",

Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy together with channeling demonstrates that the SiGe film grown on the SOI substrate is of high crystalline quality without significant dislocations. Cross-sectional TEM images of the Si/SiGe/SOI sample also indicate that there are no dislocations within the SiGe layer. The status of strain in both the Si cap layer and its underlying SiGe layer are evaluated by high-resolution x-ray diffraction (HRXRD) and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. 0.36 % of tensile strain in the Si cap layer is exhibited in the HRXRD rocking curve. Raman spectroscopy measurements show that the relaxation degree of strain in the SiGe film grown on the SOI substrate is 24%.",

In some cases, drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis (DIAIN) resulted in delayed function recovery or chronic kidney disease. To study the underlying mechanism, the authors investigated the clinical and pathological features of DIAIN patients with delayed renal function recovery. The delayed recovery group consisted of patients with reduced renal function for more than 3 months after diagnosis.In this retrospective study, 18 patients with DIAIN from January 2003 to December 2009 were identified as the delayed recovery group, whereas 54 patients with DIAIN who recovered completely within 3 months were treated as the control group. Clinical and pathological features were compared between the 2 groups.In the delayed recovery group, the average age at onset was 48.8 years, antibiotics and herbs were the 2 main causative drugs and the dominant extra-renal manifestation was gastrointestinal symptomatology. In comparison with patients in the control group, patients in the delayed recovery group had longer interval time from disease onset to hospitalization, and they presented with less oliguria. Moreover, these patients had higher levels of urine retinol binding protein, and more renal interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrations were observed in their renal histology.Aging, long interval time from disease onset to hospitalization and renal interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration may predict delayed renal function recovery.",

The solubilities of Cs 2SO4 in water, C2H5OH and mixed solvent had been determined and the refractive index of the liquid phases was also determined. The phase diagram indicated that C2H5OH was salted out by Cs2SO4 from this system and the equilibrium solid phase is Cs2SO4.

In this work, a monolithic sodium ion battery based on a Na V (PO ) cathode, MoS layered anode, and polyether-based polymer electrolyte is reported. In addition, a new kind of polysulfonamide-supported poly(ethylene glycol) divinyl ether based polymer electrolyte is also demonstrated for monolithic sodium ion battery via in situ preparation. The resultant polymer electrolyte exhibits relatively high ionic conductivity (1.2 mS cm ) at ambient temperature, wide electrochemical window (4.7 V), and favorable mechanical strength (25 MPa). Moreover, such a monolithic Na V (PO ) /MoS sodium ion battery using this polymer electrolyte delivers outstanding rate capability (up to 10 C) and superior cyclic stability (84%) after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C. What is more essential, such a polymer electrolyte based soft-package monolithic sodium ion cell can still power a red light emitting diode lamp and run finite times without suffering from any internal short-circuit failures, even in the case of a bended and wrinkled state. Considering these aspects, this work no doubt provides a new approach for the design of a high-performance polymer electrolyte toward monolithic sodium ion battery with exceptional rate capability and high safety.",

This study was carried out to investigate the effect of aristolochic acid I (AAI) on DNA damage and cell cycle in porcine proximal tubular epithelial cell lines (LLC-PK1 cells). LLC-PK1 cells were stimulated with AAI at the concentrations of 80, 320, and 1,280 ng/ml for 24 h. DNA damage was examined by comet assay and the cell cycle was assayed by flow cytometry (FCM), cellular apoptosis and lysis were examined simultaneously. Cellular nuclear changes were observed by electron microscopy and the expression of wild-type p53 protein and mRNA were measured by FCM and RT-PCR. We found that AAI-induced DNA damage prior to apoptosis and lysis in LLC-PK1 cells in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.01). The percentage of cells in the G2/M phase that were treated with AAI (320 and 1,280 ng/ml) for 24 h increased significantly (P<0.01). Electron micrographs showed the nuclear abnormalities in AAI-treated cells. The expression of p53 protein and mRNA did not change in the AAI-treated cells. AAI may cause DNA damage and cell cycle arrest in LLC-PK1 cells through a wild-type p53-independent pathway, prior to apoptosis or necrosis. This study on the molecular mechanism of AAI-induced toxicity may explain why tubular epithelial cells present limited proliferation and regeneration abilities in the clinical presentation of AAI-associated nephrotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "Sensor networks are composed of a large number of low power sensor devices. For secure communication among sensors, secret keys are required to be established between them. Considering the strict resource constraints of sensors, key infection has been proposed by Anderson, Chan, and Perrig. However, because the communication keys are broad casted in plaintext in key infection, some of them maybe eavesdropped by an adversary. To address this security issue, secrecy transfer is presented, which utilizes pre-loaded secret keying material to enhance the security performance of key infection. To thwart on-going cryptanalytic attacks, a key evolution scheme is proposed to continuously refresh shared keys. Key evolution forces the adversary to keep monitoring traffic all the time after compromising a key; even if the adversary has compromised a key, it cannot catch up with the key evolution process, and may lose control of the compromised key quickly in a noisy communication environment. Analysis results show that key infection, secrecy transfer, and key evolution present viable trade-offs between security and resource consumption for smart dust sensor networks.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Although it is believed that FSGS is a disease of podocyte,tubular injury is a common phenomena in such patients,and the degree of proteinuria is insufficient to explain the reasons.It has been reported that IL-13 could lead to podocyte injury by IL-13 receptor(IL-13R) on podocyte.Since podocyte shares many common molecules with renal tubular cell,which become molecular basis mediating podocyte and renal tubular cell common injury.To answer this question,IL-13R expression in tubular cell was observed in the renal biopsy tissues from patients with FSGS.Methodology:Fourty-one patients with idiopathic FSGS diagnosed by renal biopsy was recruited in this study.The patients with IgA nephropathy(IgAN,n=11) and membranous nephropathy(MN,n=10) served as disease controls.Five donor kidneys served as normal controls.IL-13R and RANTES(regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted) expression and distribution in renal tissue were determined by immunofluorescence staining.Tubulointerstitial lesions in FSGS patients were classified into normal,acute lesion,acute/chronic lesion and chronic lesion.The distribution and intensity of IL-13R was evaluated by scoring method.Double staining of IL-13R/N-cadherin was performed to observe IL-13R distribution.Results:The trace expression of IL-13R was found in proximal tubular cells in normal controls.The distribution and intensity of IL-13R staining was higher in FSGS patients than that in normal controls,IgAN and MN.In addition,the maximum expression of IL-13R was found in FSGS patients with looks normal tubulointerstitium and those with acute tubulointerstitial lesion,the medium expression of IL-13R in those with acute /chronic tubulointerstitial lesion and minor expression of IL-13R in those with chronic tubulointerstitial lesion.The expression and distribution of RANTES was paralleled to that of IL-13R.Reduced expression of epithelial cell marker N-cadherin was observed in the tubular cells with high expression of IL-13R.Conclusion:IL-13R was expressed in normal human renal tubular cells.The patients with FSGS had wider and higher IL-13R expression than that other glomerular diseases with same degree of proteinuria.Tubular IL-13R distribution and intensity were different according to tubulointerstitial lesions in FSGS patients.Tubular IL-13R high expression may participate in tubular cell injury in FSGS patients.",

        "abstract": "Kidneys are significantly affected by profound anatomic and functional changes with senescence. These changes lead to decline\n in glomerular filtration rate, decreased urinary concentrating and diluting ability, diminished urinary acidification, and\n impaired potassium clearance, to list a few. Such changes make the elderly prone to drug toxicity and serious fluid and electrolyte\n imbalance. While the entire mystery of aging is far from being clear, the role of oxidative stress, telomere length, Klotho\n gene expression, and the renin angiotensin system seem to be the key mechanisms involved in aging. Aging, being a complex\n process, involves an array of intertwined molecular pathways. Simultaneous study of multiple molecular pathways in parallel\n could provide invaluable information in understanding the clinical course of kidney aging and elucidating mechanisms that\n play key roles in the aging process. A better understanding of these mechanisms may help to preserve renal function, improve\n morbidity and mortality, and hopefully reduce healthcare costs for the aging population.",

The residue was recovered by flotation and leached in the MACA solution subsequently. The leaching solution was electrodeposited after removal of As and Sb and then deeply purified through two-stage countercurrent of zinc replacement. The technical and economic target,such as cycle leaching rate,removal rate,materials balance,electric zinc quality and power consumption,were investigated. The results show that the combined method of flotation-metallurgy is a suitable process for treating low-grade zinc oxide from Lanping. The average zinc leaching rates for raw ores,ammonia soluble zinc and flotation concentrate are 70.48%,89.14% and 79.75%,respectively. The purification rate and current efficiency are up to 95% and 97.02%,respectively. Electrolytic zinc with purity of 99.98%Zn is manufactured.",

The planar nanostrips were formed by partial arsenic ion implantation isolation in the channel under the gate. Devices with a gate length (   $text{L}_{{textbf {g}}}$   ) of 80 nm and a source-to-drain distance (   $text{L}_{mathrm {mathbf {textsf {sd}}}}$   ) of 1    $mu text{m}$    were fabricated. A conventional device and a device with a fin-like nanowire channel were also fabricated together for comparison. It was observed that the nanostrip and nanowire channel structures can both suppress the access resistance increase at the high output current level, and thereby improve the device’s    $text{g}_{mathrm {mathbf {textsf {m}}}}$    and    $text{f}_{mathrm {mathbf {textsf {T}}}}$    linearity.

        "abstract": "Unattended wireless sensor networks operating in hostile environments face the risk of compromise. Given the unattended nature, sensors must safeguard their sensed data of high value temporarily. However, saving data inside a network creates security problems due to the lack of tamper-resistance of sensors and the unattended nature of the network. In some occasions, a network controller may periodically dispatch mobile sinks to collect data. If a mobile sink is given too many privileges, it will become very attractive for attack. Thus, the privilege of mobile sinks should be restricted. Additionally, secret keys should be used to achieve data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication between communicating parties. To address these security issues, we present mAKPS, an asymmetric key predistribution scheme with mobile sinks, to facilitate the key distribution and privilege restriction of mobile sinks, and schemes for sensors to protect their collected data in unattended wireless sensor networks.

        "abstract": "BK virus infection accompanied with plasma cell-rich infiltrates is a dilemma in renal transplant recipients. One young female patient diagnosed as BK virus-associated nephropathy with plasma cell-rich infiltrates at 16 months after renal transplant was treated with bortezomib and a sequential immunosuppressive protocol of tacrolimus combined with leflunomide. After a short period of reduction, her serum creatinine increased slowly with stable BK viruria. The patient underwent repeat biopsy. The histologic changes showed a decrease in plasma cells and CD20+ cells in the allograft, but the other mononuclear cells showed no difference from the first biopsy. The immunosuppressive protocol was converted to tacrolimus combined with enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium. Her serum creatinine decreased gradually during 6 months of follow-up. We speculate that bortezomib can be used in BK virus-associated nephropathy accompanied with plasma cell-rich infiltrates, and this effect might be mediated through a decrease of plasma cells and CD20+ cells in the allograft. The dosage and time of therapy need to be explored in the future; additional studies of large samples are needed.",

        "abstract": "Covert wireless communication or low probability of detection (LPD) communication that employs the noise or jamming signals as the cover to hide useru0027s information can prevent a warden Willie from discovering useru0027s transmission attempts. Previous work on this problem has typically assumed that the warden is static and has only one antenna, often neglecting an active warden who can dynamically adjust his/her location to make better statistic tests. In this paper, we analyze the effect of an active warden in covert wireless communications on AWGN channels and find that, having gathered samples at different places, the warden can easily detect Aliceu0027s transmission behavior via a trend test, and the square root law is invalid in this scenario. Furthermore, a more powerful warden with multiple antennas is harder to be deceived, and Willieu0027s detection time can be greatly shortened.",

The fluorescence intensity of the product was measured under the optimal experimental conditions, i.e. 4.0 x 10(-6) M H2O2, 6.0 x 10(-5) M p-cresol, 1.2 M NH3-NH4Cl (pH 10.4) and 2.0 x 10(-7) M hemoglobin. The order of additions of the reagents was also studied. The activation of AA was found to be associated with a high ammonia concentration. The linear range of the method was 9.0 x 10(-10)-3.6 x 10(-8) M of AA. The detection limit was calculated to be 3.0 x 10(-10) M. The relative standard deviation of this method is 1.6% at 7.0 x 10(-9) M for 11 determinations.",

        "abstract": "Few studies are currently available about the renal survival and risk factors of crescentic lupus nephritis (cLN). We retrospectively analyzed data from Chinese patients with cLN in our center to identify the prognostic factors.One hundred twenty-four cases of biopsy-proven LN with ≥50% crescents (cLN) were included in this study. Another 100 patients with LN without crescents were randomly enrolled as a control group. Their clinicopathological data and long-term outcome were compared.There were 101 females and 23 males with an average age of 32.0 ± 13.5 years followed for a median period of 4 years. At biopsy, the mean SCr level was 2.4 ± 2.0 mg/dL, and the mean percentage of crescents was 64.4 ± 13.3%. The renal survival rates at years 1, 3 and 5 after biopsy of cLN group and the control group were 82.3% versus 97.8%, 78.4% versus 92.6% and 70.2% versus 84.9%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression revealed initial SCr concentration as the only independent risk factor for end-stage renal disease (hazard ratio: 1.433, P < 0.001). Logistic regression showed that the risk of end-stage renal disease at 5 years after biopsy increased rapidly at SCr >1.4 mg/dL and reached 90% at SCr >5.5 mg/dL.Crescentic LN had worse treatment response and lower probability of renal survival than those without crescents. Initial SCr concentration may predict kidney failure in patients with crescentic disease.",

        "abstract": "Inflammation is associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and coronary heart disease (CHD). Ghrelin, a multifunctional hormone, may play a key role in patients with OSA and/or CHD. The aim of this study was to investigate plasma ghrelin and pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients with OSA and /or CHD and assess the association of these cytokines with ghrelin.Plasma ghrelin, interleukin-6(IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-á) were measured in 75 patients and in 25 age-, sex-, and BMI-matched healthy control subjects. These patients were further classified into 3 groups (25 with OSA, 25 with OSA and CHD, and 25 with CHD), matched for age, sex, body mass index, and the severity of OSA or CHD.Plasma ghrelin levels were increased, and TNF-á and IL-6 were decreased in OSA patients with and without CHD, when compared with controls with similar CHD clinical characteristics (both P<0.05). Further, OSA patients with CHD tended to have higher plasma levels of TNF-á and IL-6, and lower plasma levels of ghrelin than OSA controls (P>0.05). Notably, plasma ghrelin levels were independently negatively correlated with plasma TNF-á and IL-6 (P<0.05).Increased plasma ghrelin levels might constitute an independent determinant of decreased TNF-á and IL-6, suggesting that higher ghrelin level may in part represent a compensatory mechanism to overcome the pro-inflammatory effects of OSA. Further large-scale and prospective studies are needed to confirm these effects.",

They were assigned to the standard medical therapy group (SMT group, n=4) or HVHF group (n=8) immediately after enrollment, in a 1:2 ratio. The SMT group were given standard treatment for SAP, while the HVHF group were given standard as well as 72-hour HVHF treatment initiated within 2 hours after enrollment. Patients in the 2 groups were comparable for the baseline clinical parameters. All patients were monitored over a 72-hour observation period for continuous clinical status, blood cell counts including monocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and HLA-DR expression on monocytes. Blood samples were collected from those patients at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hour after enrollment for measurement of plasma Th1-type cytokines (interleukin-1 [IL-1], IL-2, interferon-gamma [IFN-gamma], and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]) and Th2-type cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-IO, and IL-13) using ELISA.Within 72 hours, all measured cytokines except IL-4 were maintained at high levels, accompanied with a low level of peripheral monocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts, and HLA-DR expression. Seventy-two hours later, plasma cytokines IFN-gamma, IL-1, IL-2, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 (p<0.05), but not TNF-alpha and IL-6, in patients in the HVHF group were significantly reduced, while there was no change for these parameters in the SMT group. Plasma levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-2, IL-5, and IL-13 in the HVHF group were significantly lower than those in the SMT group. Peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, monocyte count, and HLA-DR expression were increased significantly (p<0.05) only in the HVHF group, not in the SMT group. HLA-DR expression in the HVHF group was significant higher than that in the SMT group (p<0.05).HVHF significantly reduced plasma inflammatory cytokine concentrations including those of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-2, IL-5, and IL-13, while it increased monocyte HLA-DR expression in patients with SAP. The association of plasma cytokine reduction and cellular immune function recovery and clinical outcome needs further investigation.",

        "abstract": "To analysis the pathological demography in Chinese patients undergoing renal biopsy from our nephrology center.Between January 1979 and October 2000 in Jinling Hospital, Nanjing, China, 10,002 attempts of percutaneous renal were performed in patients with renal disease from 33 provinces of China. The pathological classifications were made according to the WHO criteria of 1982 for renal pathology or the modified WHO criteria of 1995 by a panel of pathologists and nephrologists during routine clinical-pathological rounds. The pathological demography between those specimens collected from 1979 - 1989 and those from 1990 - 1999 was compared.The mean age of the 10,002 subjects undergoing renal biopsy was 31.4 +/- 13.0 years (ranging from 1 to 78 years), with a male to female ratio of 1.3:1; for the 592 renal transplant recipients, the mean age was 37.5 +/- 9.1 years (ranging from 16 to 66 years), with a male to female ratio of 2.36:1. Primary glomerular diseases (PGD) accounted for 71% of the total patients undergoing renal biopsies, secondary glomerular nephritis (SGN) 23%, tubular-interstitial diseases 3.2%, unclassified renal diseases 1.3%, hereditary and congenital renal diseases 1.0%, end stage renal diseases 0.96%, and recently realized or rare renal diseases 0.15%. IgA nephropathy (IgAN) was the most frequent pathological pattern (40%) of PGD, followed by mesangial proliferative lesion (MsPL) (30%), membranous nephropathy (MN) (10%), and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (6%). Lupus nephritis (LN) was the most pathology common seen (74%) in SGN. During the 22 years of the study period, there was a steady increase in patients with SGN discovered during pathological evaluation of renal disorders. A rise in prevalence was found in IgA nephropathy, MN (both P < 0.001), crescentic glomerulonephritis (P < 0.0001), anti-GBM disease, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura related renal damages (both P < 0.001). There was a decrease in endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis (P < 0.001) and IgM nephropathy (IgMN) (P < 0.01) from 1990 - 1999 as compared to 1979 - 1989. Infrequent renal pathological entities were also diagnosed in this group, including Niemann Pick disease, Fabry's disease, POEMS syndrome, and lipoprotein glomerulonephropathy.This is the largest series of renal biopsy data in China, and therefore may reflect the demographic picture of renal diseases in this country. Changes in prevalence of renal pathological entities were reflected in this group of patients over the last 22 years. In primary glomerular diseases, IgA nephropathy is still the most frequently observed pathological pattern. In SGN, LN appeared the most often. Increased prevalence was found in anti-GBM nephritis and HUS/TTP.",

The measured band gap of bulk FAPbI3 is 1.43 eV and it is therefore potentially superior than the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) as the light harvester. A homogeneous FAPbI3 perovskite layer was deposited on the TiO2 surface by utilizing the in situ dipping technology. As a result, a high efficiency of 7.5% was achieved using P3HT as the hole transport material. The nearly cubic crystal structure and appropriate band gap render this new FAPbI3 perovskite extremely attractive for next generation high-efficiency low-cost solar cells. ? 2014 American Chemical Society.",

But there is a certain error for the results when incident flow is considerable. An improved method for the homogenization calculation based on the response of incident flow and exit flow instead of the conservation of mean flux was proposed in this paper. Almost little calculation amount was added in the new method. The verification on a slab problem with reflector and the C5G7MOX benchmark problem indicates that the new method can improve the accuracy of the calculation for the eigenvalue and pin power distribution.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the effects of rhein on cell hypertrophy and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the renal tubular epithelial cells. METHODS: LLC-PK1 cells were incubated with transforming growth factor β1(TGFβ1) 2 μg/L for 24 h to induce cell hypertrophy and production of ECM. To evaluate the effects of rhein on inhibiting the action of TGFβ1, cell volume, cellular protein level, and [3H]leucine incorporation in LLC-PK1 cells treated with rhein at different concentrations were measured. In addition, the [3H] proline incorporation, level of fibronectin (FN) in supernatant, and mRNA expression of collagen IV and FN were also detected in rhein treated cells. RESULTS: The cell volume, cellular protein content, and [3H] leucine incorporation were markedly increased in LLC-PK1 cells after TGFβ1 stimulation as compared with control (P <0.01), and this TGFβ1stimulated cell hypertrophy was ameliorated by rhein. It was observed that TGFβ1 not only increased the production of FN and [3H]proline incorporation in LLC-PK1 cells (P <0.01), but also enhanced the mRNA expression of collagen IV and FN. Rhein significantly decreased the protein production and mRNA expression of ECM in LLC-PK1 cells stimulated by TGFβ1. CONCLUSION: Rhein can inhibit cell hypertrophy and ECM accumulation in LLC-PK1 cells induced by TGFβ1, which may partly account for the role of rhein in preventing and retarding the progression of diabetic nephropathy.",

        "abstract": "A new method was developed for the fabrication of CdS-TiO(2) semiconductor nanoparticles as visible-light-excitable photocatalyst at low temperatures. Nanosized CdS acting as an effective and stable sensitizer was incorporated into TiO(2) by microemulsion-mediated solvothermal hydrolyzation followed by acidic peptization of the precipitate under 70 °C. The new method avoided the calcination or other pyrochemical treatments involved in traditional preparations, and thus eliminated the unwanted agglomeration of nanoparticles or the oxidation of CdS by oxygen. Compared to traditional methods, it was highly simplified, bypassing those miscellaneous steps like filtration, sintering, milling and redispersion in solutions. The crystal structure, configuration, element composition, as well as the light-absorption properties of the obtained CdS-TiO(2) hydrosol were characterized in detail. The hydrosol consisting of uniform and small crystalline particles of about 2 nm in diameter was thermodynamically stable and showed good dispersibility. The photocatalytic activity of the 'coupled' material was confirmed through the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye under visible light irradiation, and the cooperative photocatalytic mechanism is discussed.",

The use of a planar nanostrip-channel and MIS structure allows these devices to have close to 10 dB better intermodulation distortion than traditional InAlN/GaN high electron mobility transistors. In addition, the GaN planar nanostrip-channel MISHEMT shows five orders of magnitude lower gate current    ${I}_{g}$   , 30% higher current drivability and much improved    ${g}_{m}$    and    ${f}_{T}$    gate voltage swing than a planar nanostrip-channel GaN HEMT with a Schottky gate. This allows the planar nanostrip-channel GaN MISHEMT to be able to operate at higher input gate voltage (more than    ${V}_{g}= +4$    V) and achieve higher output current with better linearity performance.",

        "abstract": "In this article the impact of geometrical parameters of the dummy gate on capacitance characteristics for RF-LDMOS transistors is analyzed and studied by using a 2-D numerical TCAD process and device simulator. Firstly, the device structure and fabrication process are described. Then measured and simulated capacitance characteristics of the fabricated RF-LDMOS transistors are compared, confirming the effectiveness of the TCAD simulations. On the basis of this, further extensive simulations on the device capacitance characteristics for varying thickness of the oxide layer under and beside the dummy gate (tfox) and length of the dummy gate over n-drift region (Lf) are carried out. Based on these simulation results, the effects of the dummy gate on various capacitance components are analyzed and discussed, indicating that feedback capacitances can be effectively reduced by the introduction of the dummy gate to the device, nevertheless, at the expense of increased output and input capacitances. For this reason, the key geometry parameters of the dummy gate have to be traded off in order to optimize device design. ©The Electrochemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Obesity-related glomerulopathy is an important complication of obesity that shares some pathophysiological factors relevant to renal damage with diabetic nephropathy. It was recognized that podocyte lesions lead to proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis in patients with some proteinuric glomerular diseases, especially diabetic nephropathy. However, podocyte changes in patients with obesity-related glomerulopathy and the underlying mechanisms are unclear.Glomerular volume, podocyte number, and foot-process width were evaluated in 46 patients with biopsy-proven obesity-related glomerulopathy. Renal tissue from 10 kidney donors served as controls.Glomerular volume was enlarged markedly in patients with obesity-related glomerulopathy (P < 0.001), with a corresponding decrease in podocyte density (P < 0.001) compared with controls. Foot-process width on the peripheral glomerular basement membrane was increased significantly, whereas mesangial volume fraction did not differ between patients with obesity-related glomerulopathy and controls. Degree of proteinuria was associated strongly with decreased podocyte density (P = 0.001), increased foot-process width (P = 0.001), and decreased podocyte number (P = 0.002). In addition, the endogenous creatinine clearance rate correlated with decreased podocyte number (P = 0.008). Interestingly, podocyte number and density correlated significantly with abnormalities in fasting glucose (P < 0.001) and insulin levels (P < 0.001) and Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (P < 0.001).Decreased podocyte density and number were observed in patients with obesity-related glomerulopathy, and changes in podocytes correlated with degree of proteinuria and renal function impairment in these patients. In addition to the enlargement in glomerular volume with consequential mechanical stretch, metabolic disorders also may contribute to the development of podocyte lesions in patients with obesity-related glomerulopathy.",

Human MCs were identified by the morphology and immunofluorescence staining. The apoptotic cells were determined by ultrastructure changes, TUNEL, and DNA fragmentation analysis. Propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry was employed for quantitative measurement of apoptosis.Under the light and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), the human MCs with condensed chromatin, plasma shrinkage, marginated nuclear chromatin or apoptotic body were observed in amylin-treated MCs. Positive TUNEL staining, hypolipoid DNA peak, and typical DNA \"ladder\" pattern were also detected in amylin-treated MCs. Quantitative analysis of the apoptotic MCs showed that human amylin induced an increase of the percentage of apoptotic cells in a dose-dependent manner. Amylin nano-scale fibrils (5-18nm) in diameter were detected in the cultured solution using negative staining under the TEM. Compared to the control, no significant changes of lactate dehydrogenase release were observed in amylin-treated MCs (P>0.05).Fibrillogenic amylin evokes the apoptosis of human MCs in vitro, which may explain the mechanism of the hypocellular mesangial damage and progressive glomerulosclerosis of the patients with diabetic nephropathy.",

        "abstract": "Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are attracting increasing attention in biosensing and imaging. The design of UCNP-based probes currently relies exclusively on the luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) principle. The prerequisite spectral overlap in LRET leads to limited flexibility in probe design, thus hindering the construction and application of upconversion (UC) probes. To change this situation, we herein present a new approach to construct UC probes by use of heavy metal ion-induced quenching. We reveal that heavy metal ions can quench the upconversion luminescence (UCL) to u003e95% without the occurrence of spectral overlap. A proof-of-concept UC probe for biothiols by manipulating Cu2+ as the switch of luminescence exhibits satisfying performance both in vitro and in bioimaging. This is the first report of a UC probe utilizing heavy metal ions to govern the read-out signal. The strategy is much simpler than the LRET principle and highly efficient, which provides a new way to design and apply...",

Correlations among peak oxygen consumption, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, NT-proBNP, 6 minute walking distance (6MWD) and cardiac index are analyzed.There were 44 cases with NYHA class II (43.6%), 49 cases with NYHA class III (48.5%), mean 6MWD was (421 ± 91 )m, NT-proBNP was (1262 ± 816) ng/L, pulmonary vascular resistance was (1031 ± 582) dyn·s(-1)·cm(-5), CI was (3.5 ± 2.3) L·min(-1)·m(-2), peak oxygen consumption was( 13.8 ± 4.1)ml·min(-1)·kg(-1). 6MWD, pulmonary vascular resistance and peak oxygen consumption were related to CI (r = 0.299, -0.541, 0.341, respectively, all P < 0.05), but NYHA class and NT-proBNP were not correlated to CI. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that peak oxygen consumption (B = 0.135, P = 0.004) but not 6MWD was correlated with CI after adjusting age, sex and pulmonary vascular resistance. ROC analysis found that the sensitivity and specificity using peak oxygen consumption <15.2 ml·min(-1)·kg(-1) as a cut-off value was 92.6% and 57.5%, respectively, for diagnosing severe heart dysfunction.The correlation between peak oxygen consumption and CI is better than that of NYHA class, 6MWD, and NT-proBNP with CI. Peak oxygen consumption less than 15.2 ml·min(-1)·kg(-1) could be used to detect reduced CI in patients with pulmonary hypertension.",

Clarifying the mechanism of microcirculating damage is obviously a key step to understand the pathogenesis of ABMR. Here we characterized capillary variation in ABMR and its possible mechanisms. Compared with T cell-mediated rejection and stable grafts, there was a significant dilation and rarefaction in peritubular capillaries (PTCs) of the ABMR group; Image-Pro Plus revealed a significantly larger intra-PTC area. Interestingly, the dilation of PTCs was strongly correlated with the intra-PTC cell counting. Moreover, peritubular capillary inflammation is correlated with in situ T-bet expression, and there was a good correlation between the intra-PTC expression of T-bet and the PTC diameter. HIF-1α up-regulation could be observed in ABMR but it was not necessary for capillary dilation. In general, ABMR is characterized with early capillary dilation and rarefaction; our data confirmed that the dilation is strongly correlated with intracapillary inflammation, which in turn is correlated with in situ T-bet expression. T-bet plays an important role in the development of microcirculating injury, and thus it is a potential target for the treatment of ABMR.",

It has been reported that 20.8% patients of IgA nephropathy had a different degree of crescent formation. From January 1995 to December 2004, 1000 patients had undergone cadaveric renal transplantation, and 1742 allograft renal biopsies were reviewed in the Department of Nephrology at Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University. Among them, 18 cases were found with crescent formation, in which 10 patients were diagnosed as recurrent or de novo IgA nephropathy because their immunofluorescence showed strong IgA deposition in mesangial area and capillary. The initial treatment protocol was CsA+Azp+Pred, except in two cases of CsA+MMF+Pred. There were 8 males and 2 females, with ages from 25 to 69 (mean of 37.1) years old. All of them showed progressive renal dysfunction with increasing level of serum creatinine ranged from 1.48 to 6.25 mg/dL. Seven cases presented edema with an increasing level of proteinuria (1.36 to 3.58 g/24hr), and nine cases presented with hematuria ranging from 50 to 1250 x 10(4)/mL (one showed gross hematuria). In pathological examinations, they showed mesangial proliferation and matrix expansion with 10% to 66.7% crescents (mean of 37.5%) in their allograft renal biopsy's samples. All patients changed their immunosuppressive regimens; however, nine of them eventually advanced to ESRD and returned to hemodialysis after 6 to 36 months. Two cases received second renal transplantation after six months to five years, and one kept stable renal function with 2.5 mg/dL of serum creatinine after three years of follow-up. IgA nephropathy with crescentic formation was not rare in renal allografts or native glomerulonephritis in Chinese patients. These patients showed rapidly progressive renal dysfunction, and most of them lost graft function and needed hemodialysis therapy.",

The dosage of clindamycin was 1.0-1.5 g/day. Fifteen patients had episodes of gross hematuria, but fever, skin rash and eosinophilia were rare. Urine analysis revealed mild proteinuria and severe tubular dysfunction. Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with AKI stage 3 upon admission. The clindamycin lymphocyte transformation assay was positive for 63.2% of the patients. Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) were proven by renal biopsy, and renal insufficiency appeared to result from tubular toxicity and drug crystals. In the majority (87.5%) of the patients, AKI was severe and required renal replacement therapy, but all of their renal function recovered significantly 2 months after discharge. Clindamycin-induced AKI is largely reversible and has episodes of gross hematuria. Renal biopsies confirmed AIN or ATN in these patients.",

        "abstract": "Crescentic glomerulonephritis (CGN) presents a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis clinically, in which macrophages play a crucial role in the pathogenesis. However, the precise molecular mechanism of macrophage recruitment and activation has not been fully elucidated. C-C chemokines, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha and beta (MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta), are major chemoattractants for macrophages. We attempted to study the expression of C-C chemokines and their correlation with CD68-positive macrophages in crescentic glomeruli to investigate further their possible roles in crescent formation and progression to fibrosis in different types of human CGN.The expression of MCP-1, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta and CD68 was detected in glomeruli with different forms of crescents (cellular, fibrocellular and fibrous crescents) by immunohistochemistry in serial sections of renal biopsies taken from 32 patients with biopsy-proven CGN including eight patients with anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease (type I CGN), 12 patients with immune complex-mediated CGN (type II CGN) and another 12 patients with pauci-immune CGN (type III CGN) enrolled in this study. Eight normal human kidneys were obtained from cadaveric renal transplant donors whose kidneys were technically unsuitable for transplantation, serving as controls.MCP-1, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta and CD68 were undetectable in glomeruli of normal kidney. In crescentic biopsies, MCP-1, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta and CD68 were detected in fibrocellular crescents and were even more prominent in cellular crescents, but were undetectable in fibrous crescents. Using consecutive sections for staining, it was demonstrated that a high proportion of infiltrating CD68-positive macrophages, mainly localized to the area of the expression of chemokines, were MCP-1, MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta positive in crescents. Chemokines were expressed mainly by CD68-positive macrophages and parietal epithelial cells in crescents. The number of MCP-1- and MIP-1alpha-positive cells in glomeruli with cellular crescents was positively correlated with the number of CD68-positive cells (r = 0.568 and 0.749, respectively, both P < 0.01). The number of MCP-1- and MIP-1alpha-positive cells and the incidence of Bowman's capsule rupture in glomeruli of patients with type I CGN were higher than those of type II and type III CGN.These observations suggest that the expressed C-C chemokines, MCP-1, MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta, may mediate the inflammatory process of crescent formation and progression to fibrosis. The strong correlation of MCP-1 and MIP-1alpha with infiltrating macrophages within glomeruli with cellular crescents suggested that these chemokines might be of particular importance for macrophage recruitment to this site. MCP-1 and MIP-1alpha were correlated to type I CGN with its more severe inflammatory course and worse prognosis. The variance of glomerular expression of C-C chemokines may contribute to the difference in histopathological features and prognosis in these three types of CGN.",

Differing from previous methods, the proposed technique is based on the rational function fitting. Two formulas are used to determine the lower and upper limits of RB, and then RB is confined to a very narrow range and can be estimated analytically only from S-parameter data, without any special structures or numerical optimization. The proposed method is successfully applied to SiGe HBTs with different device geometries. Results demonstrate that the average error for extracted RB is less than 2.5% over a wide range of bias points. Therefore, we believe that the proposed technique is a reliable routine applicable to estimation of the base resistance for SiGe HBT HICUM model.",

        "abstract": "Glomerular microthrombosis (GMT) is not uncommon in lupus nephritis and has been associated with active renal injury and progressive kidney destruction. We undertook this study to determine whether genetic variations of hemostasis factors, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and fibrinogen, affect the risk of GMT.A cross-sectional cohort of 101 lupus nephritis patients with or without GMT was genotyped for PAI-1 -675 4G/5G and beta-fibrinogen (FGB) -455 G/A gene polymorphisms and analyzed.PAI-1 4G/4G homozygotes and FGB A allele carriers were both at increased risk for GMT. When the data were stratified for both gene polymorphisms, an epistatic effect was detected. The PAI-1 4G/4G genotype was found to predispose to GMT not equally in all lupus nephritis patients, but only in FGB A allele carriers. Likewise, the association between the FGB A allele and GMT was restricted to lupus nephritis patients homozygous for the PAI-1 4G allele. This epistatic effect was revalidated by the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis and further assessed by incorporating a variety of environmental and clinical factors into the MDR analysis. The most parsimonious model that had a cross-validation consistency of 100% included joint effects of PAI-1 and FGB gene polymorphisms and anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) status and yielded the best prediction of GMT, with 66.6% accuracy.Our findings suggest that risk of GMT in lupus nephritis is attributable, at least in part, to an epistatic effect of PAI-1 and FGB genes, likely via an interaction with environmental/clinical factors, such as aCL.",

The structural formula of this compound was Mg[B 3 O 3 (OH) 5 ]·6H 2 O. The enthalpy of solution of β-2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O in approximately 1 mol dm −3 HCl was determined. With the incorporation of the standard molar enthalpies of formation of MgO(s), H 3 BO 3 (s), and H 2 O(l), the standard molar enthalpy of formation of −(10256.39±4.93) kJ mol −1 of β-2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O was obtained. Thermodynamic properties of this compound was also calculated by group contribution method. Keywords 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O Synthesis Characterization Standard molar enthalpy of formation 1 Introduction There are many kinds of magnesium borates, both natural and synthetic. Up to now, four hydrated magnesium borates containing the polyborate anion of [B 3 O 3 (OH) 5 ] 2− are found. They are 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·13H 2 O, 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·15H 2 O (inderite), 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·15H 2 O (kurnakovite), and 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O [1] . Of these, inderite and kurnakovite are the two forms of 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·15H 2 O. They have the same structural form of Mg[B 3 O 3 (OH) 5 ](H 2 O) 4 ·H 2 O, and contain the same six membered ring of [B 3 O 3 (OH) 5 ] 2− group, which is composed of one BO 3 planar triangles and two BO 4 tetrahedron. But the relationship between Mg and the B−O group occurs in inderite in a way quite different from kurnakovite. The borate group can be considered as less regular in inderite than in kurnakovite if the ideal regular group is defined as one in which the ring plane is a plane of symmetry [2] . Recently, we discovered a new form of 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O when investigating the phase transformation of 2MgO·2B 2 O 3 ·MgCl 2 ·14H 2 O in boric acid aqueous solution at 0 °C. Its structure has been studied using XRD, FT-IR, and Raman spectra as well as TG. Thermodynamic properties play very important roles in scientific research and industrial applications. Li et al. [3] reported the standard molar enthalpy of formation of eight hydrated magnesium borates. This paper reports the synthesis and the standard molar enthalpy of formation of a new form of 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of a new form of 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O The new form of 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O was synthesized by the method of phase transformation of double salt as follows: 1.86 g of 2MgO·2B 2 O 3 ·MgCl 2 ·14H 2 O (synthesized by modification of the literature method [4] ), 0.85 g of H 3 BO 3 (mass fraction ≥99.8%), and 40 ml of H 2 O were transferred to a flask with a stirrer, and set in a constant temperature water bath at 0 °C. After the reaction mixture was stirred for 3 days, the solid in solution was separated, washed thoroughly with alcohol and then ether. Finally, the obtained solid was dried in a vacuum dryer to a constant mass at room temperature, and was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (recorded on a Rigaku D/MAX-IIIC), FT-IR spectroscopy (recorded over the 400–4000 cm −1 region on a Bruker Equinox 55 spectrometer with KBr pellets at room temperature), Raman spectroscopy (recorded over the 200–1000 cm −1 region on a Nicolet Almega Dispersive Ramanmeter), and TG (determined on a METZSCH-Geratebau GmbH STA449C Thermal Analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min −1 in flowing N 2 ). The chemical composition of the sample was determined by EDTA titration for Mg 2+ , by NaOH standard solution in the presence of mannitol for B 2 O 3 , and by difference for H 2 O. 2.2 Method of calorimetric experiment The new form of 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O can be regarded as the product of the following reaction: 2 MgO ( s )+6 H 3 BO 3 ( s )+8 H 2 O ( l )=2 MgO ·3 B 2 O 3 ·17 H 2 O ( s ) The standard molar enthalpy of formation of a new form of 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O could be obtained by solution calorimetry in combination with the standard molar enthalpies of formation of MgO(s), H 3 BO 3 (s), and H 2 O(l). The H 3 BO 3 and the synthetic sample were dissolved in approximately 1 mol dm −3 HCl(aq), respectively, and then the calculated amount of MgO was dissolved in aqueous (hydrochloric acid + boric acid) which consisted of approximately 1 mol dm −3 HCl(aq) and the calculated amount of H 3 BO 3 . The HCl solvent was prepared from analytical grade hydrochloric acid and deionized water, and its concentration was determined by titration with standard sodium carbonate. A RD496-III heat conduction microcalorimeter (Southwest Institute of Electron Engineering, China) was used and has been described in detail previously [5] . The temperature of the calorimetric experiment was 298.15 K. Additional double-layer glass tubes were put in the 15 ml stainless steel sample cell and reference cell of the calorimeter. This was done to prevent corrosion of the stainless steel sample and reference cell by HCl(aq). The lining in the double-layer glass tube containing HCl(aq) was broken by a rod after thermal equilibration for at least 2 h. The HCl(aq) was mixed with solid sample in the outer glass tube, then the thermal effect was recorded automatically on an computer. Total time required for the complete reaction was about 0.5 h. There were no solid residues observed after the reactions in each calorimetric experiment. To check the performance of RD496-III heat conduction microcalorimeter, calorimetric measurements on the enthalpy of solution of KCl (spectral purity) in deionized water were made. The experimental mean value (17.23±0.04) kJ mol −1 of Δ sol H m is in excellent agreement with that of (17.241±0.018) kJ mol −1 reported in the literature [6] . This result shows that the device for measuring the enthalpy of solution used in this work is reliable. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of the synthetic sample Chemical analysis results of synthetic sample: MgO, 13.50%; B 2 O 3 , 35.20%; H 2 O, 51.30%; mole ratio of MgO:B 2 O 3 :H 2 O=2.00:3.02:17.01. XRD data of synthetic sample, d (Å), ( I/I 0 ): 9.605(100), 7.076(20), 6.573(12), 6.412(25), 6.138(68), 5.175(12), 5.024(24), 4.706(12), 4.530(41), 4.304(30), 3.531(17), 3.448(15), 3.356(16), 3.266(20), 3.225(29), 3.123(35), 2.833(39), 2.682(19), 2.549(15), 2.429(17), 2.264(15), 2.047(16), and 1.881(14). It can be seen that the shape and data of XRD spectra of synthetic sample are different from those of 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O reported in the literature [1] , which indicates that the synthetic sample is a new compound. The IR and Raman spectra of synthetic sample exhibited the following absorptions and they were assigned referring to literature [7] . The band at 3336 cm −1 is the stretching of O−H. The band at 1655 cm −1 is assigned to the H−O−H bending mode, which shows the compound containing the crystal water. The bands at 1398 and 1356 cm −1 might be the asymmetric stretching of B(3)−O. The bands at 1139, 1053, 1001 cm −1 and 889, 806, and 748 cm −1 (Raman) are assigned as the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of B(4)−O, respectively. The band at 667 cm −1 in IR and 631 cm −1 in Raman are assigned as the characteristic peak of triborate anion, which shows that the synthetic sample contains the [B 3 O 3 (OH) 5 ] 2− . The bands at 508 cm −1 in IR and 490, 409, 325 cm −1 in Raman are the bending modes of B(4)−O. TG curve ( Fig. 1 ) indicates that the total mass loss is 51.51% from 50 to 600 °C, which corresponds to the loss of 17 water molecules and can be compared with calculated value of 51.39%. On the DSC curve ( Fig. 1 ), there are two peaks: one endothermic peak (Δ r H m =555.39 kJ mol −1 ) appeared at 89 °C corresponds to the loss of 17 water molecules and formed amorphous 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ; the other greater exothermic peak (Δ r H m =−51.46 kJ mol −1 ) appeared at 760 °C corresponds to a recrystallization of 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 . Therefore, the synthetic sample is a new form of 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O reported in the literature [1] . In the following, our form of 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O will be named β-2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O and Li et al. [1] α-2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O. Although their structural formula can be both written as Mg[B 3 O 3 (OH) 5 ]·6H 2 O, the regular of [B 3 O 3 (OH) 5 ] 2− groups in their structure may be different, which is similar to the case in inderite and kurnakovite. No impurity lines were observed, and the synthetic sample is suitable for the calorimetric experiments. 3.2 Results of calorimetric experiment The results of the calorimetric measurements are given in Table 1 , in which m is the mass of sample, Δ sol H m is the molar enthalpy of solution of solute, and the uncertainty is estimated as twice the standard deviation of the mean. Table 2 gives the thermochemical cycle for the derivation of the standard molar enthalpy of formation of the β-2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O. The molar enthalpy of solution of H 3 BO 3 (s) of (21.83±0.08) kJ mol −1 in approximately 1 mol dm −3 HCl(aq), and of MgO(s) of −(146.20±0.36) kJ mol −1 in the mixture of HCl and H 3 BO 3 were taken from literature [3] . The standard molar enthalpies of formation of H 2 O(l), MgO(s), and H 3 BO 3 (s) were taken from the CODATA Key Values [8] , namely −(285.830±0.040), −(601.60±0.30), and −(1094.8±0.8) kJ mol −1 , respectively. The enthalpy of dilution HCl(aq) was calculated from the NBS tables [9] . From these data, the standard molar enthalpy of formation of β-2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O was calculated to be −(10256.39±4.93) kJ mol −1 . This result is different from that of 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O reported in the literature [3] , which also shows that the synthetic sample is a new form of 2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O reported in the literature [1] . The enthalpy of formation of β-2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O can also be estimated by a group contribution method [10] as the sum of the contributions of Mg 2+ (aq), [B 3 O 3 (OH) 5 ] 2− (aq) and of structural water. The standard molar enthalpy of formation is, using this scheme, −10244.46 kJ mol −1 . The calculated value is close to the experimental result. The relative error is 0.12%. We also used a group contribution method to calculate Δ f G ° m of the β-2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O to be −8974.14 kJ mol −1 . Combining its Δ f H ° m , the standard molar entropy of formation of the β-2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O has been calculated at −4300.69 J mol −1 K −1 according to following equation: Δ f S° m = Δ f H° m − Δ f G° m T Finally, the standard molar entropy of the β-2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O was calculated to be 890.36 J mol −1 K −1 according to following reaction: 2 Mg ( s )+6 B ( s )+17 H 2 ( g )+14 O 2 ( g )=2 MgO ·3 B 2 O 3 ·17 H 2 O ( s ) The standard molar entropies of the elements were taken from CODATA Key Values to be 32.67, 5.90, 130.571, and 205.043 J mol −1 K −1 for Mg(s), B(s), H 2 (g), and O 2 (g), respectively. It can be seen from the results of literature [3] that the Δ f H ° m of inderite is bigger than that of kurnakovite, which is consistent with the fact that the inderite is more stable than kurnakovite. In present paper, the determined Δ f H ° m of β-2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O is less than that of α-2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O reported in the literature [3] , the difference of which is mainly due to the difference of regular of [B 3 O 3 (OH) 5 ] 2− in their structure as if the case of the former pair. This result shows that the β-2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O is less stable than α-2MgO·3B 2 O 3 ·17H 2 O.

        "abstract": "The mechanism by which glucocorticoids alleviate renal inflammatory disorders remains incompletely understood. Here, we report that the efficacy of glucocorticoids in ameliorating FSGS depends on the capacity to expand myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). After glucocorticoid treatment, the frequency of CD11b(+)HLA-DR(-)CD14(-)CD15(+) MDSCs in peripheral blood rapidly increased in patients with glucocorticoid-sensitive FSGS but remained unchanged in patients with glucocorticoid-resistant FSGS. The frequency of CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) MDSCs in mouse peripheral blood, bone marrow, spleen, kidney-draining lymph nodes (KDLNs), and kidney also increased after glucocorticoid treatment. The induced MDSCs from glucocorticoid-treated mice strongly suppressed T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages but induced regulatory T cells in spleen, KDLNs, and kidney. Moreover, glucocorticoid treatment suppressed doxorubicin-induced T cell proliferation, dendritic cell and macrophage infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine production, whereas this protective effect was largely abolished by depleting MDSCs using anti-Gr-1 antibody. Finally, the adoptive transfer of induced MDSCs into the doxorubicin-treated mice not only confirmed the protective role of MDSCs in doxorubicin-induced renal injury but also showed that the transferred MDSCs rapidly migrated into the lymphocyte-accumulating organs, such as the spleen and KDLNs, where they suppressed T cell proliferation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that glucocorticoid treatment ameliorates FSGS by expanding functional MDSCs and that this rapid elevation of MDSCs in peripheral blood may serve as an indicator for predicting the efficacy of glucocorticoid treatment.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the effect of blood cardioplegia on the extent of myocardial injury during cardiac surgery and postoperative recovery in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients by continually detecting the changes of myocardiac enzymes. Methods The venous blood samples of 39 patients undergoing CABG were taken on the day before surgery and days 1, 3, 5, and 8 after surgery to measure the serum levels of AST, CK, CK-MB, LDH and LDH-1. Results The levels of AST, CK, CK-MB, LDH and LDH-1 before surgery were all within the normal range but they peaked up to be three to fifteen times on day 1 after surgery (P< 0.01). CK, LDH, LDH-1 and AST were still significantly higher on day 3 (P< 0.05 or P< 0.01) whereas CK-MB became normal. CK and AST recovered to the normal level on day 5, but both LDH and LDH-1 remained higher on day 8 (P< 0.05 or P< 0.01). Conclusion The levels of 5 cardiac enzymes measured before surgery were all within the normal range. They elevated to the peak on day 1 after surgery. CK-MB was the first to become normal, followed by CK and AST. LDH and LDH-1 were the last. Both LDH and LDH-1 should be used as an index to evaluate repair of myocardium after ischemic and reperfusion injury. Blood cardioplegia can offer satisfactory myocardial protection for CAGB patients.",

        "abstract": "The patient, a previously healthy woman, presenting with acute renal failure and anemia, was admitted to our hospital. Her serum creatinine (Scr) had increased from 0.79 - 2.69 mg/dl over three days and hemoglobin had decreased from 12.1 - 7.8 g/dl over 4 weeks. Mild compression fracture and degeneration of the lumbar vertebra and skull were observed in X-ray. The renal biopsy showed acute proximal tubular lesions induced by multiple calcium deposition. A bone marrow biopsy showed that primitive lymphocyte was up to 92.5%. After making a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia complicated with acute kidney injury induced by hypercalcemia, CRRT (continued renal replacement therapy) and chemotherapy were used immediately. Ten days later, the blood calcium had gradually decreased from 3.88 to normal range (1.8 mmol/l) and the renal function was back to normal (Scr 0.93 mg/dl). This unusual case shows that a patient who has a syndrome of acute renal failure, electrolyte disturbances, anemia, and elevated LDH needs bone marrow puncture to eliminate renal injury caused by hematologic diseases.",

A high quality SiGe base layer was obtained. Enhancement of strain relaxation of the SiGe layer with increasing thickness of the Si cap layer is demonstrated. In addition, strain stability of the SiGe layer with an appropriate Si cap layer during real SiGe HBT fabrication has also been investigated. Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at elevated temperature between 880°C and 910°C for a very short period of time had almost no influence on the strain in a Si0.84Ge0.16 epilayer. However, high temperature (900°C) furnace annealing for 1 hr prompted the strain in the Si0.84Ge0.16 layer to relax by approximately 15 % relative to that in an as-grown structure.",

It has been found that Ca2+ is able to induce the formation of the so-called competence of some bacterial cells, such as Escherichia coli, which results in the Horizonal Gene Transfer phenomenon. But it is not yet well known the role of Ca 2+ in the procedure. It is significant to make it clear whether Ca2+ can transfer across the cellular membrane. In the present work, Fura-2, a kind of new fluorescence probe, was used to study the transmembrane behaviors of Ca2+ to Escherichia coli HB101 cells. It was found that extracellular Ca2+ could cross the cellular membrane of Escherichia coli cells and the amount of inpouring Ca2+ was correlative to the concentration of extracellular Ca2+. Kinetics based on stopped-flow spectrofluorimetry indicated that the transmembrane behavior of Ca2+ to Escherichia coli cells, was a quite fast process, i.e., within only 1 s. What is more, the cell in early log phase had the lowest concentration of intracellular Ca2+ and the highest capability of incepting extracellular Ca2+, as compared with cells in late log phase and stationary phase.",

The absorbance obtained at 40°C was found to be proportional to the concentration of H2O2 in the range of 2.0×10−5–2.0×10−7 mol/L, with a correlation coefficient of 0.999 1. The proposed method is simple and highly sensitive to a detection limit\n of 2.7×10−8 mol/L. The relative standard deviations were within 5% for the determination of different concentrations of H2O2. Satisfied results were obtained in the determination of H2O2 in rainwater by this method, and the recoveries were at the range of 97.2%–105.4%.",

        "abstract": "Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active moiety of mycophenoate mofetil (MMF), an ester prodrug widely used as an immunosuppressant. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of MPA is becoming mandatory for transplant patients received MMF therapy in the routine clinical practice because of large individual variability, dose-related toxicity and the risk of acute rejection. In this study, a rapid, sensitive and selective LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the quantitative analysis of total and free MPA in plasma and in saliva that uses one identical liquid chromatographic and mass spectrometric condition. Following protein precipitation for total and saliva MPA, and ultrafiltration for free MPA, chromatographic separation was performed on an Allure PFP Propyl analytical column (100 x 2.1 mm, 5 microm, RESTEK Co., Bellefonte, PA, USA) with 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water (45:55, v/v) as the mobile phases. The compounds were quantified by positive electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery, matrix effect, and saliva stability were evaluated during method validation. The validated method was applied to a pharmacokinetic study of MPA after an oral administration of a single 1000 mg of MMF to eight healthy male volunteers and 750 mg bid of MMF to nine renal transplant patients.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the injury effects of organic solvents on kidney, an animal model of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats treated with mixed organic solvents via inhalation was generated and characterized. The mixed organic solvents consisted of gasoline, dimethylbenzene and formaldehyde (GDF) in the ratio of 2:2:1, and were used at 12,000 PPM to treat the rats twice a day, each for 3 hours. Proteinuria appeared in the rats after exposure for 5-6 weeks. The incidences of proteinuria in male and female rats after exposure for 12 weeks were 43.8% (7/16) and 25% (4/16), respectively. Urinary N-Acetyl-β-(D)-Glucosaminidase (NAG) activity was increased significantly after exposure for 4 weeks. Histological examination revealed remarkable injuries in the proximal renal tubules, including tubular epithelial cell detachment, cloud swelling and vacuole formation in the proximal tubular cells, as well as proliferation of parietal epithelium and tubular reflux in glomeruli. Ultrastructural examination found that brush border and cytoplasm of tubular epithelial cell were dropped, that tubular epithelial cells were partially disintegrated, and that the mitochondria of tubular epithelial cells were degenerated and lost. In addition to tubular lesions, glomerular damages were also observed, including segmental foot process fusion and loss of foot process covering on glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Immunofluorescence staining indicated that the expression of nephrin and podocin were both decreased after exposure of GDF. In contrast, increased expression of desmin, a marker of podocyte injury, was found in some areas of a glomerulus. TUNEL staining showed that GDF induced apoptosis in tubular cells and glomerular cells. These studies demonstrate that GDF can induce both severe proximal tubular damage and podocyte injury in rats, and the tubular lesions appear earlier than that of glomeruli.",

        "abstract": "Formamidinium lead triiodide (HC(NH2)2PbI3 or FAPbI3) is gaining increasing interest in the field of mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for its broader light absorption compared with the more widely studied CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3). Because FAPbI3 has two polymorphs (“black” α-FAPbI3 and “yellow” δ-FAPbI3) at ambient temperature, where α-FAPbI3 is the desirable photoactive perovskite phase, it becomes particularly important to suppress the formation of the nonperovskite δ-FAPbI3 for achieving high efficiency in FAPbI3-based mesoscopic PSCs. In this study, we demonstrate that the judicious use of low-volatility additives in the precursor solution assists in the evolution of α-FAPbI3 through the formation of non-δ-FAPbI3 intermediate phases, which then convert to α-FAPbI3 during thermal annealing. The underlying mechanism involved in the additive-modulated evolution of α-FAPbI3 upon mesoporous TiO2 substrates is elucidated, which suggests guidelines for developing protocols for the fabrication efficient FA...",

        "abstract": "Objective:To compare the effect, relapse rate and outcomes between pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide(CTX) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in the induction therapy of crescentic lupus nephritis(CLN) in Chinese. Methodology:Twenty-five CTX treated and twenty-seven MMF treated lupus patients with ≥50% crescent formation were enrolled in this study, who were hospitalized in the Research Institute of Nephrology, Nanjing Jinling Hospital between January 1998 and June 2005. General conditions, clinicopathological findings, remission rate, relapse rate, and outcomes were compared. All the patients were followed-up until June 2005, with an average follow-up in the CTX group for range 10～80(38.5±21.2) months, and range 12～90(41.1±27.0) months in the MMF group. Results:No significant difference was found between CTX group and MMF group in general conditions, base parameters of clinical and pathological findings. The remission rate at the 12th month in CTX and MMF group were 69.6% and 73.1%. The complete remission rate in MMF group (53.8%) was significantly higher than that of the CTX group (26.1%). The relapse rate in MMF group (10.5%) was significantly lower than that of the CTX group (43.8%). 40% of the patients in the CTX group with partial remission relapsed. Two patients in the CTX group and two in the MMF group entered into end stage renal failure (ESRF). The side effect of infection was more significant in the CTX group. Conclusion:Higher complete remission rates and less infection complications were observed in crescentic lupus nephritis patients who received MMF induction regime than in patients who received intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide(CTX) regime.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To study the effect of triptolide on the activity of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and gene expression of IκBα, a major inhibitor of NF-κB, in human Jurkat T cell line. METHODS: Jurkat cells treated with or without PMA/PHA were incubated with varied doses of triptolide for different time periods. The activity of NF-κB in Jurkat cells was measured with electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), and the mRNA expression of IκBα in Jurkat cells was detected by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: PMA/PHA treatment was found to induce NF-κB activation rapidly. Triptolide treatment decreased the activity of NF-κB in both PMA/PHA treated and untreated Jurkat cells. This effect of triptolide was in a dose-dependent manner and was more obvious in cells treated with PMA/PHA. The mRNA expression of IκBα were upregulated by triptolide, while this effect was more potent in cells without PMA/PHA treatment. CONCLUSION: Triptolide is a potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation in T lymphocyte and this effect is partly due to the upregulation of IκBα mRNA expression.",

Although IMN is thought to run a more benign course in Asian patients than in the Caucasian population, there has been no persuasive study to determine the long-term prognosis and risk factors for IMN in the Chinese population.A retrospective chart review. All patients admitted to Nanjing Institution of Nephrology from January 1985 to December 2007 with biopsy-proven IMN were enrolled. The primary outcome was the renal survival rate and risk factors at renal biopsy.A total of 217 patients were included in the study, and the overall renal survival rates were 96.9%, 93.5%, and 86.6% at 5, 10, and 15 years after renal biopsy, respectively. When the clinical features at biopsy were evaluated, patients with hypertension (p = 0.023), decreased eGFR (p < 0.001), nephrotic-range proteinuria (p = 0.047), elevated urinary NAG (p = 0.045) and RBP (p = 0.007) had a worse prognosis. Cox multivariate analysis showed that decreased eGFR and chronic tubulointerstitial lesion were independent risk factors for ESRF (end-stage renal failure).IMN is a disease with a comparatively good prognosis in the Chinese population, with a renal survival rate of more than 90% at 10 years after renal biopsy. Decreased eGFR at biopsy and chronic tubulointerstitial lesion are independent risk factors of ESRF. Partial or complete remission of proteinuria improved the prognosis.",

This method was very different from the traditional methods, which produced titanium dioxide nanoparticles with anatase crystalline structure either at high acid condition or high temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM) demonstrated that the as-prepared TiO 2 sol nanoparticles with anatase crystalline structure were uniformly distributed, and the average size was 3 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV–vis absorption spectra showed that triethylamine was adsorbed on TiO 2 sol particles surface. FTIR spectroscopy noted that TiO 2 sol particles had the similar spectra with Degussa P25. Photoactivity of the as-prepared TiO 2 sol was studied by investigating the photodegradation of methyl violet in hydrosol reaction system under visible light irradiation.",

A total of 40429 renal biopsies from January 2010 to January 2018 were re-examined in the present study, and 17 patients were confirmed to meet the criteria of IgG4-RKD. According to the serum C3 levels, they were divided into two groups: the low C3 group (C3<0.8g/L, n=7) and the normal C3 group (C3≥0.8g/L, n=10). Compared with the normal C3 level group, the patients in the low C3 level group had lower serum C4 concentrations (P=.025), higher serum IgG4 concentrations (P=.003), higher positive rates in rheumatoid factor (P=.033), more severe storiform fibrosis (P=.007) at diagnosis, and higher blood urea nitrogen levels at the latest test (P=.04). The serum levels of C3 were in negative correlation to the serum levels of IgG4 (P=.003), the levels of rheumatoid factor (P=.002), renal deposition of C1q (P=.028), storiform fibrosis (P<.001), scores of interstitial fibrosis (P=.015), the amount of renal IgG4 positive (IgG4) plasma cells (P=.020), the ratios of IgG4 plasma cells/CD138 cells (P=.018), and the blood urea nitrogen concentrations at the last test (P=.023).

        "abstract": "Network coding has emerged as a promising approach for peer-to-peer converged\n                ubiquitous networks to increase network capacity and solve the block reconciliation\n                problem. However, peer-to-peer systems with network coding suffer a severe security\n                threat, known as pollution attack, in which malicious peers inject corrupted packets\n                into the information flow. Previous solutions are either computationally expensive\n                or too ineffective to limit pollution attacks with arbitrary collusion among\n                malicious peers. In this paper, we propose time keys, an efficient security scheme\n                which allows participating peers to efficiently detect corrupted packets by using\n                time and space properties of network coding. Our work is an innovative security\n                solution to frustrate pollution attacks with collusion based on time and space\n                properties of network coding. In addition, time keys scheme provides an efficient\n                packet verification without requiring the existence of any extra secure channels. We\n                also present security analysis and simulations of our scheme, and results\n                demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of time keys scheme.",

Three of them suffered from ACR, and the other five with normal function. Biopsy sections were detected for the presence of recipient-derived cells and their phenotypes. Recipient-derived cells appeared in the tubular epithelium as early as 13 days posttransplant, with the phenotype of cytokeratin(+)/CD45(-). They also localized in the medium walls of arterioles and expressed alpha-SMA. In patients with ACR, recipient-derived tubular cells increased persistently during the first 6 months (3.8 to 6.6%). Long-term follow up showed a decline in their number when ACR ameliorated. In patients without ACR, the infiltration rate remained stable (0.6-2.3%). Recipient-derived cells participate the remodeling of renal allografts. They might have a close relationship with ACR outcome and with vascular structure remodeling.",

        "abstract": "Background: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent implantation for stenotic lesions of renal arteries and other branches of the aorta in Takayasu's arteritis have been reported to show good outcomes. However, this form of therapy has been reported in few cases with pulmonary artery involvement. Hypothesis: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of this interventional treatment for pulmonary stenosis due to Takayasu's arteritis. Methods: A total of 4 patients (3 female and 1 male, ages 30-40 yrs) with Takayasu's pulmonary arteritis underwent percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty and stent implantation and were followed up for 1 to 4 years. Results: One patient underwent balloon angioplasty alone, 3 patients underwent balloon angioplasty and stent implantation. The stenoses were relieved acutely, oxygen saturation improved immediately due to improvement in lung perfusion and relief of dyspnea. The pressure gradient fell from 58.3 ± 8.7 mm Hg to 14 ± 3.2 mmHg and mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased from 48.5 ± 12.0 mmHgto37.3 ± 6.0 mm Hg. At a follow-up period of 34.5 ± 15.8 months, the patient with balloon angioplasty alone developed a recurrence of symptoms 18 months after the procedure. The other 3 patients continued to be asymptomatic and the stent remained patent without restenosis after the procedure. Conclusion: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent implantation is a safe and effective treatment in patients with pulmonary stenosis caused by Takayasu's arteritis. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

In this prospective study, 40 patients with class V+IV lupus nephritis were randomly assigned to induction therapy with mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and steroids (multitarget therapy) or intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVCY). Patients were treated for 6 mo unless complete remission was not achieved, in which case treatment was extended to 9 mo. An intention-to-treat analysis revealed a higher rate of complete remission with multitarget therapy at both 6 and 9 mo (50 and 65%, respectively) than with IVCY (5 and 15%, respectively). At 6 mo, eight (40%) patients in each group experienced partial remission, and at 9 mo, six (30%) patients receiving multitarget therapy and eight (40%) patients receiving IVCY experienced partial remission. There were no deaths during this study. Most adverse events were less frequent in the multitarget therapy group. Calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity was not observed, but three patients developed new-onset hypertension with multitarget therapy. In conclusion, multitarget therapy is superior to IVCY for inducing complete remission of class V+IV lupus nephritis and is well tolerated.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the application value of cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).A total of 116 consecutive patients admitted into the Cardiology Department of Fuwai Hospital.They were divided into 3 groups of CTEPH (n = 44), CPE (without pulmonary hypertension in chronic pulmonary embolism) (n = 24) and control (without pulmonary embolism or pulmonary hypertension) (n = 48) respectively. Their levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were measured. Incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed to compare its differential results among 3 groups and evaluate the correlation between NT-proBNP and its parameters.The body mass index (BMI) in the CTEPH group was lower than those in the CPE and control groups ((23.8 ± 3.9) vs (26.1 ± 3.6) and (26.7 ± 3.2) kg/m(2) ), both P < 0.05); the medical history in the CTEPH group was longer than those in the CPE and control groups ((58 ± 48) vs (12 ± 10) and (29 ± 25) months, both P < 0.05). The plasma concentrations of NT-proBNP in the CTEPH group were higher than those in the CPE and control groups ((1678 ± 1255) vs (577 ± 167) and (608 ± 247) pmol/L, both P < 0.05). All of them completed the test and there were no severe complications such as syncope or exacerbation of disease. Maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max), percentage of predicted maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 %), oxygen consumption in relation to body weight (VO2/kg), anaerobic threshold and O2 pulse in the CTEPH group were significantly lower than those in the CPE and control groups (P < 0.05). The ratios of dead space volume (VD) to tidal volume (VT) in the CTEPH and CPE groups were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The plasma concentrations of NT-proBNP were inversely correlated with right ventricular internal diameter (r = -0.690, P = 0.000) and VO2/kg (r = -0.496, P = 0.000). The right ventricular internal diameter (β = 0.583, P = 0.000) and VO2/kg (β = 0.233, P = 0.032) were strong independent determinants of NT-proBNP.As a reliable pathophysiological indictor of CTEPH, cardiopulmonary exercise testing may be used objectively and safely to evaluate the cardiopulmonary function of CTEPH patients.",

Herein, a facile and reliable in situ polymerization strategy of poly(ethyl cyanoacrylate) (PECA) based gel polymer electrolytes (GPE) via a high efficient anionic polymerization was introduced consisting of PECA and 4 M LiClO in carbonate solvents. The in situ polymerized PECA gel polymer electrolyte achieved an excellent ionic conductivity (2.7 × 10 S cm) at room temperature, and exhibited a considerable electrochemical stability window up to 4.8 V vs Li/Li. The LiFePO/PECA-GPE/Li and LiNiMnO/PECA-GPE/Li batteries using this in-situ-polymerized GPE delivered stable charge/discharge profiles, considerable rate capability, and excellent cycling performance. These results demonstrated this reliable in situ polymerization process is a very promising strategy to prepare high performance polymer electrolytes for flexible thin-film batteries, micropower lithium batteries, and deformable lithium batteries for special purpose.",

Twenty-three patients were given MMF orally at a dosage of 1.0 - 1.5 g/d (MMF Group). Another 23 cases received conventional intermittent CYC pulse therapy (CYC Group). Supplemental steroid treatment was offered in the same manner to both groups. The age, sex distribution and severity of renal damage were matched in two groups. Therapeutic effects were evaluated at the end of six-month treatment. Fifteen patients in the MMF Group and 12 patients in the CYC Group had repeated renal biopsy at that time.MMF therapy was more effective in reducing proteinuria and hematuria. A 50% reduction of urinary protein and urinary red blood cell excretion from baseline value in 69.6% and 91.3% patients in the MMF Group, while only 47.8% and 65.2% in the CYC Group. MMF was more effective in inhibiting autoantibody production (especially anti-dsDNA antibody) and in decreasing serum cryoglobulin levels. Pathologically, the MMF group showed more markedly reduction in glomerular immune deposits with less glomerular necrosis, and less microthrombi, less crescent formation and vascular changes in the repeated renal biopsy as compared with the CYC group. Adverse reactions related to the treatment included gastrointestinal symptoms 26.1% and 43.5% in the MMF and CYC Groups respectively, infection 17.4% in the MMF group and 30.4% in the CYC group.MMF was more effective in controlling the clinical activity of DPLN and renal vascular lesions as compared with CYC pulse therapy in a 6 month follow-up study.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To explore the protective effects and mechanism of triptolide on podocytes injury induced by sublytic complement complex C5b-9. Methodology:Terminal complement complex C5b-9 was formed on podocytes using purified C5b-6 and C7-C9.Complement lysis was determined by measuring release of lactate dehydrogenase,similarly(LDH).C5b-9 deposition on the membrane of podocyte was detected by LSM and flow cytometry using the human C5b-9-specific mAb aE11.F-actin was observed by fluorescence microscopy.The podocytes were treated with triptolide before or after C5b-9 has been assembled,and then observed the effect of triptolide on the reactive oxygen species(ROS) gerneration and MAPK activation induced by C5b-9.ROS was assayed using the fluoroprobe CM-H2DCFDA,while MAPK activation was analyzed by western blot. Results:Intact C5b-9 was formed on the surface of podocyte as detected by imunofluorescence.Sublytic C5b-9 induced marked actin cytoskeleton alteration in a time-dependent manner.C5b-9 significantly increased ROS generation in podocytes.This effect was observed rapidly at 10min and maintained for 90min.Furthermore,C5b-9 stimulated a strong increase in phosphorylated p38 in podocytes after 1h incubation.In contrast,C5b-9 treatment had no significant effect on phospho-ERK1/2 and phosphor c-Jun MAPK levels.In addition,antioxidant NAC and SB202190,a specific kinase inhibitor for p-38,can block C5b-9 induced podocyte injury as showed by cytoskeleton staining,indicating that ROS generation and MAPK activation mediated C5b-9-induced podocyte injury.Triptolide did not interfere with the formation of C5b-9 on the membrane of podocytes.When podocytes were treated with triptolide after C5b-9 has been assembled for 30min,it is observed that triptolide has no significant inhibiting effect on C5b-9 induced ROS generation.However,the activation of p38 MAPK decreased. Conclusion:Triptolide had a protective effect in C5b-9 induced podocyte injury,which might partially due to the inhibition of p38 MAPK activation.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the effects of triptolide on proinflammatory factor-induced over-expression of class II major histocompatibility complex (class II MHC), B7-1, B7-2, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in human proximal tubular epithelial (HKC) cells. METHODS: HKC cells were exposed to both interferon γ (IFN-γ, 200 μg/L) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α, 20 μg/L) and cultured in media containing different concentrations of triptolide for 24 h. Class II MHC, B7-1, B7-2, and ICAM-1 levels in HKC cells were evaluated by flow cytometry. ICAM-1 mRNA level was measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR method. RESULTS: HKC cells expressed quite high level of ICAM-1 and very low levels of class II MHC, B7-1, and B7-2 molecules. Class II MHC, B7-1, B7-2, and ICAM-1 levels in HKC cells were significantly increased by the costimulation of IFN-γ and TNF-α. Triptolide inhibited the over-expression of class II MHC, B7-1, and B7-2 molecules in a concentration-dependent manner. The up-regulations of ICAM-1 molecules and ICAM-1 mRNA level were not altered by triptolide. CONCLUSION: Triptolide can significantly inhibit proinflammatory factors induced over-expression of class II MHC, B7-1, and B7-2 costimulatory factors in tubular epithelial cells. These results may contribute to the therapeutic effects of triptolide in some renal diseases.",

A surface emission model, Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) and an one-dimensional atmosphere transfer model (1DRTM) were combined to generate a database. Through analysis of the simulated dataset, it is found that the ratio of the polarization difference obtained from 36.5 and 89 GHz (ΔT B(36.5)/ΔTB(89)), called PDR-CLW later) is sensitive to CLW. The algorithm was validated using AMSR-E observations over the Southern Great Plains. The CLW data retrieved by five ground based microwave radiometers (MWR) were used to validate the algorithm, with RMS error of 0.11 mm. © 2011 IEEE.",

The patients were divided into FK506 (n=20) and CsA(n=31)combination group. MMF protocol is the same in two groups. The MPA concentration was evaluated with high-performance liquid chromatography, which was presented by the MPA area under the curve (MPA AUC 0-12). Within the first 6 months after transplantation, plasma samples for MPA AUC 0-12 were collected at 4 different timing (15day, 1 month, 3month, and 6 month). Results:The MPA AUC 0-12 of FK506 group was higher than that of CsA group during the early time [15th day: (56.0±21.1) vs (33.2±8.9)mg/L·h ,P<0.01, and 1st month: (54.0±12.5) vs (38.5±12.9) mg/L·h,P<0.01] with the same MMF dosage. The MPA AUC 0-12 and the MMF dosage had no difference between two groups in the 3~ rd and the 6~ th month. The average dosage of MMF in 3~ rd and 6~ th month for FK506 group was lower than that of CsA group( 3~ rd month:(1.10±0.29)g/d vs (1.27±0.25)g/d,P<0.05, 6~ th month:(1.02±0.18) vs (1.22±0.10)g/d,P<0.05) with the similar MPA AUC 0-12. There were no differences between two groups in body weight, hemoglobin, serum creatinine and albumin at four timing. Conclusion:The low dosage of MMF for Chinese people (in contrast to westerner) also can reach an effective MPA AUC 0-12. Combined with MMF, the MPA concentration of FK506 group was higher than that of CsA group within 1 month after transplantation with the same MMF dosage, and the MMF dosage of FK506 group was lower than that of CsA group from the third month with the same MPA concentration. Our data indicate that the MMF dosage should be adjusted individually in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global public health problem with significant gaps in research, care, and policy. In order to mitigate the risks and adverse effects of CKD, the International Society of Nephrology has created a cohesive set of activities to improve the global outcomes of people living with CKD. Improving monitoring of renal disease progression can be done by screening and monitoring albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate in primary care. Consensus on how many times and how often albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate are measured should be defined. Meaningful changes in both renal biomarkers should be determined in order to ascertain what is clinically relevant. Increasing social awareness of CKD and partnering with the technological community may be ways to engage patients. Furthermore, improving the prediction of cardiovascular events in patients with CKD can be achieved by including the renal risk markers albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate in cardiovascular risk algorithms and by encouraging uptake of assessing cardiovascular risk by general practitioners and nephrologists. Finally, examining ways to further validate and implement novel biomarkers for CKD will help mitigate the global problem of CKD. The more frequent use of renal biopsy will facilitate further knowledge into the underlying etiologies of CKD and help put new biomarkers into biological context. Real-world assessments of these biomarkers in existing cohorts is important, as well as obtaining regulatory approval to use these biomarkers in clinical practice. Collaborations among academia, physician and patient groups, industry, payer organizations, and regulatory authorities will help improve the global outcomes of people living with CKD.",

        "abstract": "Because of the lack of mechanism to verify a route's path authorization, border gateway protocol BGP has been disrupted by route hijacking for decades. Although several secure inter-domain protocols have been proposed during the past years, such as secure BGP S-BGP and BGPsec, they all have serious performance issues in both time and space cost, preventing their further deployment in the practical Internet. Statistical results from the real Internet reveal that multiple Internet protocol prefixes could often been announced along with the same AS path/sub-path to its downstream autonomous systems; hence, the route announcements can be aggregated at the level of prefix. In light of this, we propose a three-signature path authentication 3S scheme to improve the performance of path authentication. We first introduce the concept of \\\"virtual AS,\\\" to reflect a cluster of prefixes that are announced along a common path/sub-path. Then we aggregate those prefixes into an atom and only need to sign the first route announcement of a virtual AS instead of single prefixes; thus, it can reduce the number of cryptographic operations significantly. We evaluate the performance of 3S scheme in both theoretical and experimental ways; the results have shown that our proposed scheme is more efficient yet without losing security capabilities as existing methods such as S-BGP and BGPsec.

After purification,the extraction solution was derivated by taking N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide as derivatization agent. The qualitative and quantitative analysis for tetrabromobisphenol A was carried out by total ion chromatogram and selected ion chromatogram with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The pretreatment conditions,such as derivatization time and temperature,use amount of derivatization agent and precipitation agent,were optimized. The tests of linear correlation,recovery rate and precision were performed. The results show that:the linearity range of the testing method is 0.05～50mg/L,the correlation coefficient is 0.9992,the lowest detection limit is 2mg/kg,the recovery rate and relative standard deviation are 91.0%～97.9% and less than 7% respectively.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To investigate the metabolomic profile in serum and urine of patients with DN at different stages,and find out biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis of DN. Methodology:Ninety male patients diagnosed as type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) were enrolled this study.They were divided into 3 groups (normoalbuminuria,n=30,microalbuminuria,n=30,and proteinuria,n=30). Twenty-five health controls were included. Serum and urine metabolites were analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Results:Distinct metabolomic differences were observed between different stages of DN. All the three groups of patients showed clear dysfunction of glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle. Activation of protein kinase C pathway and hexosamine biosythesis pathway were also demonstrated. The levels of serum branched-chain amino acids were increased in the diseased group.The levels of serum non-essential fatty acid were elevated,while L-cartinine and acyl CoA were decreased,which indicated the dysfunction of β-oxidation of fatty acids. The palmitic acid in the serum,as well as PC (P-19∶1(12Z)/0∶1) and dodecanedioic acid in the urine might be candidate biomarker for early diagnosis of DN. DecanoylL-carnitine,PC(9∶0/0∶0) and Dg (17∶2(9Z,2Z)/20∶3 (8Z,11Z,14Z)/0∶0) in the serum,as well as uridine diphosphate and lysoPC (16∶0) might be candidate biomarkers for prognosis of DN. Conclusion:Our study demonstrated the changes of metabolic profile in different stages of DN,and provided candidate biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis.",

        "abstract": "VANETs can significantly improve traffic management and driving safety. It has attracted great attention of government departments, academia and industry circles. To perform cooperative operations, vehicles should broadcast traffic information to RSUs and other vehicles periodically. Unfortunately, the massive messages should be digitally signed and verified in a very short time to the real-time constraints. To deal with this issue, we propose an efficient anonymous authentication scheme, in which RSU becomes the message center that can establish the session relationship with the surrounding vehicles and assign temporary identities to vehicles. Using the temporary identity and session key, every vehicle is only responsible for transmitting messages to RSU, the latter for collecting and validating messages from vehicles and broadcasting the information verified. To obtain traffic information, any vehicle only need verify the broadcast messages from RSU. In addition, the proposed scheme can provide anonymity in the RSUu0027s coverage. The security and performance analysis illustrates that the proposed scheme can effectively protect the useru0027s security and can provide fast authentication.",

Renal biopsy is a valuable tool to provide histological evidence. However, the safety in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving renal biopsy is not well evaluated. This study was conducted to monitor the dynamic complications and to evaluate the safety of biopsy in diabetic patients.A prospective observation was performed on 130 patients with type 2 diabetes and 150 patients not undergoing renal biopsy. The complications were monitored at 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h sequentially after biopsy.Haematoma was observed in 34 (26.15%) patients with diabetes and 50 (33.33%) in controls (P=0.19). The timing of large haematoma peaked at 4 h. Gross haematuria occurred in 12 (9.23%) diabetic patients and eight (5.33%) controls (P=0.207). It happened mainly within 8 h. Renal pathological diagnosis showed 96 (73.85%) cases with diabetic nephropathy and 34 (26.15%) cases with non-diabetic renal disease.Renal biopsy in patients with type 2 diabetes is safe. The frequency of complications after renal biopsy in diabetes is no higher than those without diabetes. The complications mostly happened within 8 h, especially within 4 h. Biopsy is also very necessary to rule out other chronic renal diseases in diabetes.",

Although a considerable number of fluorescent probes have been developed for NO imaging, the  tracking of this gas molecule in biological events remains a big challenge, mainly because of the relatively short excitation and/or emission wavelengths, which are subject to background interference and lowered collection efficiency in deep-tissue imaging. Herein, we report a far-red emissive (650 nm) two-photon (TP) excitable  probe, using Nile Red as the TP fluorophore, for NO detection and imaging both  and . The  probe shows a fast (within 180 s) and specific fluorescence response toward NO with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 46 nM. The excellent properties of  enable it to sensitively detect both exogenously and endogenously generated NO in living cells. The \"NIR in\" and \"far-red out\" lights lead to improved penetrating ability, thus endowing the probe with high resolution for the illumination of deep tissues. It is therefore able to visualize the NO generation in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammation process for the first time. Our results demonstrate that  could be a practical tool for studying the NO-related biological events. Moreover, this study also suggests the possibility of using Nile Red and its derivatives to develop far-red emissive TP probes, which is an important, yet undeveloped area.",

The types of NHL include the following: chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (n = 8), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 4), T/NK cell lymphoma (n = 3), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (n = 2), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (n = 1), mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (n = 1) and mantle cell lymphoma (n = 1). All presented with proteinuria, and 15 patients had impaired renal function. The pathological findings included (1) membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis-like pattern in seven patients; (2) crescent glomerulonephritis in four; (3) minimal-change disease in three, and glomeruli without specific pathological abnormalities in three; (4) intraglomerular large B-cell lymphoma in one; (5) intracapillary monoclonal IgM deposits in one; (6) primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the kidneys in one; and (7) lymphoma infiltration of the kidney in eight patients.A wide spectrum of renal lesions can be observed in patients with NHL, and NHL may be first proven by renal biopsies for evaluation of kidney injury or proteinuria. Renal biopsy is necessary to establish the underlying cause of renal involvement in NHL.",

Thiamine deficiency brings many clinically significant problems, such as dysphoria, quadriplegia and dyspepsia. Intrinsic fluorescence has an advantage over the extrinsic fluorescence of an unperturbed environment during investigation, especially in complex systems such as biological cells and tissues. Cellular fluorescence provides a sensitive index of the functional state of a living cell (1). Different amounts of thiamine were added to culture medium and the fluorescence of tryptophan and NADH from yeast was determined. When the thiamine concentration was greater than 0-0.16 microg/mL, the intensity of tryptophan fluorescence increased linearly, whereas the NADH fluorescence decreased. When the thiamine concentration was above 0.24 microg/mL, the fluorescence of tryptophan and NADH was almost unchanged. We concluded that low thiamine concentration in culture medium had a large effect on the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and possible reasons are discussed.",

However, the application of this classification in children with IgAN needs validation in different patient populations.A total of 218 children with IgAN from 7 renal centers in China were enrolled. The inclusion criteria was similar to the original Oxford study.There were 98 patients (45%) with mesangial proliferation (M1), 51 patients (23%) with endocapillary proliferation (E1), 136 patients (62%) with segmental sclerosis/adhesion lesion (S1), 13 patients (6%) with moderate tubulointerstitial fibrosis (T1 26-50% of cortex scarred), and only 2 patients (1%) with severe tubulointerstitial fibrosis (T2, >50% of cortex scarred). During a median follow-up duration of 56 months, 24 children (12.4%) developed ESRD or 50% decline in renal function. In univariate COX analysis, we found that tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis (HR 4.3, 95%CI 1.8-10.5, P < 0.001) and segmental glomerulosclerosis (HR 9.2 1.2-68.6, P = 0.03) were significant predictors of renal outcome. However, mesangial hypercellularity, endocapillary proliferation, crescents, and necrosis were not associated with renal prognosis. In the multivariate COX regression model, none of these pathologic lesions were shown to be independent risk factors of unfavorable renal outcome except for tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis (HR 2.9, 95%CI 1.0-7.9 P = 0.04).We confirmed tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis was the only feature independently associated with renal outcomes in Chinese children with IgAN.",

        "abstract": "Hailar Basin is a Meso-Cenozoic basin which superimposed on the Paleozoic collision orogenic belt of Inner Mongolia-Greater Hinggan Mountain.The basin,trending north-east,consists of five first-order structural units(three depressions and two uplifts),they are,from west to east,the Zhalenuoer Depression,Cuogang Uplift,Beier Lake Depression,Bayanshan Uplift and Huhe Lake Depression,respectively.Wuerxun and Beier Sags are two second-order structural units in the south of Beier Lake Depression.The research indicates that in the Early Cretaceous,Wuerxun-Beier Sag underwent two long-term compressions:NW-SE trending during Damoguaihe Period to early Yimin Period,and near EW trending during late Yimin Period,respectively.The compressions led to the inversion of some depression-controlled normal faults in the extensional faulted depression,and formed new fault-propagation fold,fault-band fold,imbricate structure,duplex structure,pop-up structure,triangular zone etc.Because of the differences in geometric and kinematic features and the variance in the ratio of the uplift rate of compressional structures to the deposition rate of isostructurally growing strata in space,the syn-collision strata sequences show different sedimentary features in different structural positions.These structural features are very similar to those of orogenic belt.The discovery of two phases of compressional structure in Wuerxun-Beier Sag proved that the crust of Northeast China was not always in the state of extension and thinning in the Early Cretaceous,but showed the features of superimposition and thickening during the two compression periods,and thus formed structural framework of alternative distribution of compression-depression basins and intracontinental(intraplate)orogenic belt in space.",

        "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been widely used and proven effective in the long-term clinical practice. However, the molecular mechanism of action for many TCMs remains unclear due to the complexity of many ingredients and their interactions with biological receptors. This is one of the major roadblocks in TCM modernization. In order to solve this problem, we have developed TCMAnalyzer, which is a free web-based toolkit allowing a user to: 1) identify the potential compounds that are responsible for the bioactivities for a TCM herb through scaffold-activity relation searches using structural search techniques, 2) investigate the molecular mechanism of actions for a TCM herb at systemic level, 3) explore the potential targeted bioactive herbs. The toolkit can result in TCM networks that demonstrate the relations among natural product molecules (small molecular ligands), putative protein targets, pathways, and diseases. These networks are graphically depicted to reveal the mechanism of actions for a TCM herb, or to identify new molecular scaffolds for new chemotherapies. TCMAnalyzer is freely available at http://www.rcdd.org.cn/tcmanalyzer.",

The total reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and the accumulation of Fe2+ during the photodegradation process were detected to examine the role of Fe3+. In contrastto an aqueous TiO2 dispersion where Fe3+ strongly inhibited the photoactivity of TiO2 via suppressing the reduction of O2 and decreasing the production of ROS, Fe3+ accelerated the photodegradation of all dyes examined in the hydrosol through increasing the yield of oxidative ROS. The influence of the prebound hydroxyl groups on the surface of TiO2 was compared to that of free alcohols in aqueous solution, which revealed the cooperative function of the surface hydroxyl groups. The thoroughly contrary effect of Fe3+ on the photocatalysis of TiO2 hydrosol and TiO2 powder, which are all anatase nanocrystallites but are synthesized with different procedures, was ascribed to the complexation of the hydroxyl groups bound to TiO2 surface with Fe3+. The formation of such complexes has resulted in an altered electron-transfer pathway of the dye-sensitized photocatalysis under visible light irradiation.",

Methods:Our work included two groups,CHF group,n=20,the patients were treated in our center from August to December 2010 and Control group,n=27,the subjects with normal cardiopulmonary function.CPET was performed and the general clinical information were collected and compared between two groups. Results:Compared with Control group,the peak heart rate,peak systolic blood pressure,diastolic blood pressure,the anaerobic threshold,peak VO2,peak VO2/pred,peak oxygen pulse were significantly decreased in CHF group,P<0.001 or P<0.05,while VE/VCO2 slope was significantly increased in CHF group,P<0.01.By Pearson and partial correlation analysis,NT-proBNP was mostly correlated to VE/VCO2 slope(r=0.685,P<0.001),LVEF was mostly correlated to peak VO2(r=0.679,P<0.001),the peak heart rate was mostly correlated to peak VO2/pred(r=0.791,P<0.001),peak systolic blood pressure was mostly correlated to peak VO2(r=0.677,P<0.001).In addition,FVC and FEV1 were closely related to peak VO2(r=0.559,P<0.001 and r=0.589,P<0.001 respectively). Conclusion:CPET can objectively and quantitatively evaluate the exercise capacity in patients with chronic left heart failure.",

        "abstract": "Soluble suppression of tumorigenicity (sST2) has been proposed to be a marker for biomechanical strain and a possible predictor of mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. The use of sST2 in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has not been well defined.Plasma sST2 levels may correlate with the disease severity and predict clinical worsening in PAH.We performed a cohort study of 40 idiopathic PAH patients with data on demographics, exercise capacity, echocardiographic parameters, laboratory tests, hemodynamics, and medications. Plasma sST2 was assessed with the high-sensitivity ST2 ELISA kit at diagnostic catheterization. All patients were followed up from the date of blood sampling. The endpoint was clinical worsening.sST2 was significantly elevated in patients with idiopathic PAH compared with control subjects (28.9 ± 13.9 vs 20.7 ± 7.5 ng/mL, P = 0.003). Pearson correlation analysis revealed that sST2 levels correlated with cardiac index (r = -0.534, P = 0.000) and pulmonary vascular resistance (r = 0.350, P = 0.027), and could reflect disease severity of PAH. After a mean follow-up of 14 ± 5 months, 12 patients showed clinical worsening. Receiver operating characteristic analysis suggested that sST2 levels >31.4 ng/mL discriminated clinical worsening with a sensitivity and specificity of 83.3% and 78.6%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that higher sST2 levels (>31.4 ng/mL) were associated with poor clinical outcomes (P = 0.008). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that sST2 was an independent predictor of clinical worsening (hazard ratio: 6.067, 95% confidence interval: 1.317-27.948, P = 0.021).sST2 correlates with disease severity and is a significant predictor of clinical worsening in patients with PAH.",

Methodology:Twelve consecutive patients diagnosed as POEMS syndrome in a single institute were recruited in this study.Among them,4 patients were performed renal biopsy.Their clinical and pathological characteristics of renal lesions were investigated. Results:They were 9 males and 3 females with a median age of 44.5 years old.The systemic manifestations included polyneuropathy in all cases,organomegaly in 11,at least one endocrine abnormality at time of presentation in 10,a detectable monoclonal protein with serum immunofixation in 9,and skin changes documented in 12 cases.The renal involvements included initially reported edema in 11 cases,mild proteinuria in 8,microscopic hematuria in one,and the increasing serum creatinine in half of cases.Renal biopsy showed prominent glomerular changes which were mesangiolytic lesions with swelling and vacuolization of endothelial cells.Mesangial proliferation and thickening of the capillary wall with double contour were also observed on light microscopy.No immunoglobulins or light chains deposits were found on immunofluorescent microscopy. Conclusion:These observations suggest that chronic endothelial injury constitute the basic pathology of glomerular disease in patients with POEMS syndrome,while no specific clinical renal features.It is important for clinicians that POEMS should be considered a rare cause of renal disease.",

Methodology:Twenty patients with class Ⅳ LN combined renal NNV were divided into two groups according to their induction therapy. They were MMF group treated with MMF and cyclophosphamide(CTX) group with intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVC) in addition to corticosteroids. Among them,eight patients were offered MMF 1.5～2.0 g/d for 6 months and nine were treated with IVC 0.75～1 g/m2 monthly for 6 months. The baseline characteristics between the two groups were no significant differences and the efficacy and side effect were compared. Three patients,who were two cases of CTX group and one of MMF group,discontinued in this study. Results:The total remission rate [complete remission(CR) and partial remission(PR)] in MMF group were higher than that in CTX group,CR rate in the 6 month between MMF and CTX group were 37.5% vs 0,P=0.08. MMF as induction therapy was found to be more effective in improvement of the hematuria,proteinuria,and better tolerated with lower adverse reaction rate of severe side effect such as pneumonia and gastrointestinal symptoms. Conclusion:As induction therapy for LN (IV) combined NNV,MMF in combination with corticosteroids is more effective than IVC therapy. Further larger and longer clinical trial ,as well as exploring a optimal therapy,would be required.",

Triptolide, a diterpene triepoxide, is one of the major active components of these extracts. To clarify its antiproteinuric effects we induced podocyte injury by puromycin aminonucleoside. Triptolide effectively reduced the proteinuria induced by puromycin in nephrotic rats without reducing the glomerular filtration rate. The antiproteinuric effect was associated with improvement in the foot process effacement, a decrease in the podocyte injury marker desmin as well as the restoration of nephrin and podocin expression and distribution. In cultured mouse podocytes triptolide pretreatment prevented the puromycin-induced disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and microfilament-associated synaptopodin while protecting nephrin and podocin expression. Triptolide suppressed reactive oxygen species generation and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation while restoring RhoA signaling activity. These results show that triptolide ameliorates puromycin aminonucleoside-mediated podocyte injury in vivo and in vitro.",

These results indicate that these composites with good electronic conductivity can deliver a favorable capacity performance. Keywords A. Composites B. Sol–gel chemistry C. Electron microscopy D. Electrochemical properties 1 Introduction Supercapacitors represent a class of charge-storage devices typically exhibiting high power density and excellent reversibility [1–5] . Substantial researches have been carried out during the past few years for their potential applications in several fields including portable electronic devices, uninterruptible power supplies, and hybrid electrical vehicle systems [6–9] . Comparing to conventional electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLC), pseudocapacitors involving Faradaic reaction have been proposed for the applications in supercapacitors. Hydrous RuO 2 is currently a benchmark pseudocapacitive material since it is capable of demonstrating capacitances exceeding 1000 F g −1 [10] . However, the expensive nature of ruthenium limits its potential for commercialization. Therefore, researches have been extensively explored for alternative materials. Metal nitrides have drawn considerable attention for their various applications as optoelectronic materials, catalyst and electrodes for supercapacitors [11–15] . Especially for the latter application, the low cost, high molar density and superior chemical resistance of the transition metal nitrides render them desirable alternatives for the next-generation supercapacitors. Among various options, nanocrystalline vanadium nitride (VN), which has been reported to deliver a specific capacitance of up to 1340 F g −1 in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte [16] , is clearly one of the most promising candidates for pseudocapacitors [17] , However, VN was reported to exhibit a poor electronic conductivity resulting in their limited rate capability [18] . On the other hand, titanium nitride, usually used as current collector, was reported to possess a good electronic conductivity but with minor capacity [19–21] . Therefore, the formation of ternary metal nitrides, that is, of metal nitrides featuring two metals in their crystal structure, provide an excellent solution. Since both vanadium and titanium nitrides feature the same diffraction patterns and similar cell parameters, it is reasonably expected that the combination of titanium and vanadium nitride into ternary metal nitride can provide the ingredients for both faster electronic transportation and excellent storage performance. Core–shell nanocomposite materials have been intensively investigated as electrode for supercapacitor application [22–26] , as these nanostructures provide multiple functionalities by combining the physical properties of different materials. Recently, Ti-V nitrides have been fabricated via heating the respective ternary oxide precursor with nitrogen donors or solid state metathesis reactions using reactive templates [27] . However, template synthesis is rather complicated and there is still limited report concerning exploiting titanium vanadium nitrides for supercapacitors. Herein, we report a facile strategy on the synthesis of core–shell Ti-V nitride. The process involves coating commercial TiN nanoparticles with V 2 O 5 · n H 2 O sols resulting in the fabrication of TiN/V 2 O 5 core–shell composite followed by ammonia reduction to form TiN/VN particles. We demonstrate that TiN/VN core–shell particles can exhibit promising electrochemical performances for supercapacitors. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of specimen 2.1.1 Reagents Vanadium pentoxide and hydrogen peroxide 30% were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (China). Titanium nitride was purchased from Hefei Kaier Nano Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (China). All of the reagents were used as received without further treatment. All solutions were prepared with twice distilled water. 2.1.2 Preparation of V 2 O 5 · n H 2 O sol V 2 O 5 · n H 2 O sol was synthesized according to the method reported by Fontenot et al. with slight modification [28] . V 2 O 5 and 30% H 2 O 2 were used as precursors. 1.36 g V 2 O 5 powder was dissolved in 20 mL de-ionized H 2 O and 6 mL H 2 O 2 solution. The suspension was stirred approximately 1.5 h until V 2 O 5 powder totally dissolved resulting in a dark red solution. 2.1.3 Preparation of TiN/VN composites Various amounts of TiN nanopaticles were added to the V 2 O 5 · n H 2 O sol stirred for 1 h. The final molar ratios of V: Ti in the sols were 2:3, 3:2 and 4:1 respectively. The solution was then sonicated overnight to get a dark gel. The as-prepared TiN/V 2 O 5 · n H 2 O composites are denoted hereafter as TiN/VN-1, TiN/VN-2, TiN/VN-3, respectively. Subsequently, the resulting composites were dried at 80 °C for 24 h, and then calcined at 450 °C in air for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min −1 . The TiN/VN composites were finally obtained as a black powder after heating to 800 °C and kept at this temperature for 5 h under ammonia with a flow rate of 500 mL min −1 in a tube furnace. For a fair comparison, pure VN was also obtained by the same procedure without the addition of TiN nanopaticles. 2.1.4 TEM Characterization Morphologies of TiN/VN composites were studied using a JEOL 2010F transmission electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The interpretable resolution defined by the contrast transfer function of the objective lens is 0.19 nm. An FEI Sirion 200 field-emission scanning electron microscope was also used in this study. 2.1.5 XRD Analysis X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of TiN/VN composites were recorded in a Bruker-AXS Micro-diffractometer (D8 ADVANCE) with Cu Kα radiation ( λ = 1.5406 Å) at a scanning speed of 0.33° min −1 . X-ray tube voltage and current were set at 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. 2.2 Measurements 2.2.1 Electrical conductivity The electrical conductivities of the TiN/VN pellets were measured using the four-probe technique on a 4-point Probes Resistivity Measurement System (RTS-8, Four Probes Tech.) at room temperature. The pellets with 1 cm in diameter and 0.05–0.09 cm in thickness were pressed at room temperature under pressure of 15 MPa for 3 min. For each pellet with the same pressing protocol, three pellets were tested and the conductivity of each pellet was measured four times in different directions at the center of the pellet. Therefore, the conductivity of each sample is determined by averaging over 12 random spots using four-probe technique. 2.2.2 Electrochemical analysis Electrochemical measurements were made on a three-electrode cell set-up that consisted of a working electrode, a platinum foil counter electrode, and an Hg/HgO reference electrode. The working electrode was prepared by dispersing TiN/VN composites, super P, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in distilled water, with a weight ratio of 85:5:10, respectively. The resultant slurry was pasted on a stainless steel current-collector with 1 cm × 1 cm square and pressured under 15 MPa. The typical mass of electrodes is 3.0 ± 0.1 mg. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out between −1.1 and 0 V (vs. Hg/HgO) with scan rates varied from 2 to 2000 mV s −1 in 1 M KOH electrolyte at 25 °C with a CHI 440a potentiostat. The specific capacitance was calculated from the enclosed area of the anodic curves in the CV plot. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using a ZAHNER ZENNIUM electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode system too, EIS measurement was carried out by applying an AC voltage of 5 mV amplitude in the frequency range of 0.1–100 kHz at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion For the preparation of TiN/VN core–shell structure, as shown in Scheme 1 , the TiN nanoparticles were dispersed evenly into the sols of V 2 O 5 · n H 2 O which were prepared by a facile V 2 O 5 –H 2 O 2 routine reported by Fontenot et al. [28] . Through ultrasonic agitation, the mixture turned into a uniform dark gel with the evaporation of excess water in the V 2 O 5 · n H 2 O sols. During the process of thermal treatment at 450 °C, the crystallization of V 2 O 5 · n H 2 O gels occurred and the resultant V 2 O 5 layer aggregated around the TiN nanoparticles to form the core/shell structure. Finally, the TiN/V 2 O 5 composites were nitridized under ammonia atmosphere to obtain the TiN/VN core–shell structure. The XRD patterns ( Fig. 1 ) indicate that all of the as-prepared products consist of crystalline metal nitrides with cubic symmetry. It is worthy to note that the present patterns do not fit to the standard JCPDS positions of VN (JCPDS 65-4307) or TiN (JCPDS 38-1420) and all the peaks shift to higher angles in the diffraction patterns with increasing vanadium amount compared with that of TiN pristine. It may be ascribed to a partial formation of Ti–V-N solid solution during ammonia reduction at high temperature [29] . The slight peaks of TiO 2 reflect the oxidation of redundant uncovered TiN due to the trace of oxygen in the calcination process in ammonia. Transmission electron micrograph shown in Fig. 2 a reveals the diameter of TiN/VN composites range from 30 to 80 nm. An image of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in Fig. 2 b displays well-defined core/shell structures with the TiN core nearly fully wrapped by coating VN layer with an average shell thickness of about 3 nm. A magnified view shown in Fig. 2 c is zoomed in from the rectangular region marked in Fig. 2 b with both TiN and VN lattice fringes observed. Individual diffractograms are shown in Fig. 2 d and e, respectively, corresponding to the lattices of TiN (core) and VN (shell). The EIS analysis has been recognized as one of the principal methods for examining the fundamental behavior of electrode material. Fig. 3 shows EIS plots for the TiN/VN-1, TiN/VN-2, TiN/VN-3 in 1 M KOH aqueous solution electrolytes with open circuit voltage and amplitude of 5 mV over a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. From Fig. 3 we can see that the radius of the semicircle at high frequency range of all three curves is similar and show comparable charge-transfer resistance of 1.5–2 Ω, which indicates that the polarization resistance of TiN/VN composite is relative small. At low frequency region the imaginary part of the impedance curves approaches a vertical line, presenting an ideal capacitive-type behavior. A good electrical conductivity is a prerequisite of superior performance for supercapacitor electrode material. Therefore, the electrical conductivity of TiN/VN samples was measured by four point probes technique. As a result, the electrical conductivities of samples are 4.12, 2.81, 2.65, 2.52, and 0.81 mS cm −1 , corresponding to commercial TiN, TiN/VN-1, TiN/VN-2, TiN/VN-3, and pure VN, respectively. The electrochemical response of the synthesized TiN/VN composites was performed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) on the TiN/VN electrode scanned at various scan rates of 2–2000 mV s −1 . As shown in Fig. 4 , the shape of the CV curve at low voltage sweep rate of 2 mV s −1 can be approximated a rectangular mirror image for both the charge and discharge portions which is reflective of an ideal capacitive behavior. There are one pair of slight peaks (indicated by arrows) observed during the charging and discharging process indicating the oxidation of the nitride surface leading to reversible redox reaction of vanadium. The possible redox reaction could occur on the nitride or oxy-nitride surface as follows [16] : (1) VN x O y + OH − ↔ VN x O y //OH − where VN x O y //OH − represents adsorption of hydroxide ions at specific sites on the oxynitride surface [16] . However, comparing with the previous reports of VN [15,16,30] , the behavior of TiN/VN electrode is similar to the response of an electrical double layer (EDL) type capacitor. As the scan rate increases, the rectangular shaped CV curves become more inclined (45° to the voltage-axis) indicative of a poor capacitive response [31,32] . As a result, the specific capacitance is determined to be sensitive to the voltage sweep rate. The average specific capacitance was calculated according to the equation: (2) C = i υ × m where i , υ , and m represent the average current, scan rate, and weight of TiN/VN composites, respectively. The average current was calculated from the corresponding cyclic voltammograms. The overall specific capacitances calculated for TiN/VN synthesized with various V/Ti mol ratios are plotted in Fig. 5 . The highest specific capacitance of 170 F g −1 was exhibited by using TiN/VN-3 as electrodes at a scan rate of 2 mV s −1 . Around 65 F g −1 (TiN/VN-1), 62.37 F g −1 (TiN/VN-2) and 74.46 F g −1 (TiN/VN-3) could still be obtained at 200 mV s −1 , respectively. Compared with pure nanosized TiN or VN gel, TiN/VN composites exhibited obviously, higher specific capacitances at low scan rate of 2 mV s −1 , and maintained a promising rate capability at higher scan rate. The capacity increase is possibly due to the unique architecture of TiN/VN composite integrated both faster electronic transportation and higher storage. These results reveal that the TiN/VN core–shell composite can provide an alternative for supercapacitors application. Cycling performance is one of the most important issues concerned for electrochemical capacitors. Cyclic tests of TiN/VN composites were performed at a scan rate of 20 mV s −1 and the results are shown in Fig. 6 . It can be seen that the cycling stability of the TiN/VN-3 is a slightly better than the other two electrodes. After 500 cycles, the TiN/VN-3 electrode shows about 89% of retention of the initial capacitance. 4 Conclusion In summary, TiN/VN core–shell composites have been prepared by a facile two-step strategy. These composites can provide promising electronic conductivity and favorable capacity storage. The highest specific capacitance of 170 F g −1 was obtained when scanned at 2 mV s −1 and a promising rate capacity performance was maintained at higher voltage sweep rates. Results of this study suggested that the TiN/VN core–shell composite can be used as an alternative for supercapacitor applications in high power devices.

        "abstract": "Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in the kidney is a histopathologic lesion that occurs in a number of clinical settings and is often associated with poor renal prognosis. The standard test for the diagnosis of TMA is the renal biopsy; noninvasive parameters such as potential biomarkers have not been developed.We analyzed routine parameters in a cohort of 220 patients with suspected TMA and developed a diagnostic laboratory panel by logistic regression. The levels of candidate markers were validated using an independent cohort (n = 46), a cohort of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (n = 157) and an expanded cohort (n = 113), as well as 9 patients with repeat biopsies.Of the 220 patients in the derivation cohort, 51 patients with biopsy-proven TMA presented with a worse renal prognosis than those with no TMA (P = 0.002). Platelet and L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels showed an acceptable diagnostic value of TMA (AUC = 0.739 and 0.756, respectively). A panel of 4 variables - creatinine, platelets, ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 repeats 13) activity and LDH - can effectively discriminate patients with TMA (AUC = 0.800). In the validation cohort, the platelet and LDH levels and the 4-variable panel signature robustly distinguished patients with TMA. The discrimination effects of these three markers were confirmed in patients with SLE. Moreover, LDH levels and the 4-variable panel signature also showed discrimination values in an expanded set. Among patients undergoing repeat biopsy, increased LDH levels and panel signatures were associated with TMA status when paired evaluations were performed. Importantly, only the 4-variable panel was an independent prognostic marker for renal outcome (hazard ratio = 3.549; P<0.001).The noninvasive laboratory diagnostic panel is better for the early detection and prognosis of TMA compared with a single parameter, and may provide a promising biomarker for clinical application.",

As applied a bias voltage on the capacitor with the same direction of retained polarization, the shift became more serious because of more space charges accumulated at the interfaces. However, as applied the different direction for the retained remnant polarization and bias voltages, a competition on the imprint formed in the films. The retained polarization played an important role on the imprint as the applied bias is small, and the effect of bias became stronger with increasing the applied bias voltages.",

Methods From Dec .1992 to Oct. 2005, 1381 patients (835 males, 546 females )were operated on for their VSD. The patients' age ranged from 2 days to 55 years old (4.6±3.2 years old). The body weight ranged from 2.5 to 80 kg(14.5±10.7)kg. 487 cases were less than 10 kg (35.3%). All patients underwent VSD repair under hypothermic anaesthesia with cardiopulmonary bypass. If necessary, deep hypothermic and low flow or improved superfilter was used. 823 cases were repaired with direct stitch closure and 558 with patch closure. Results There were 24 deaths (10 infants younger than 6 months, one new born) and operative mortality was 1.7%. One infant died 66 days after operation. The morbidity was 9.7%. Conclusions VSD is the most common congenital heart disease and operative treatment may got satisfactory result while indication of infants who are younger than 6 months must be control strictly. Subpulmonary VSD should be repaired early to prevent aortic insufficiency. The care and therapy of the respiratory and circulatory system must be emphasized after operation. The treatment of perioperative pulmonary hypertension must be highlighted.",

A light microscopic examination of renal biopsy specimens showed nodular glomerulosclerosis. Electron microscopy revealed electron-dense deposits along the glomerular and tubular basement membranes. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed positive glomerular and tubular staining for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and negative staining for κ and λ light chains.

We therefore reviewed 1,000 (8,531 person-years follow-up) renal allograft recipients from Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University, revealing an incidence rate of 2.4% of post-transplant malignancies, with a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 17.8 (95% C.I.: 16.7-18.8); the standardized rate is 1.67%, compared with 0.29% in the general population. However, our group demonstrated an extremely low incidence of skin cancer, which dominates in western countries. To confirm the findings, we reviewed the literature on post-transplant malignancies in Chinese renal allograft recipients, covering 296 malignancies in 18,548 renal transplant recipients in 21 reports. The top three most common sites of malignancies were the digestive tract, bladder and liver. The incidence of skin cancer was very low in most centers. These data show that Chinese renal allograft recipients have a unique spectrum of post-transplant malignancies, with an extremely very low incidence of skin cancer as compared to populations from western countries.",

We studied demographic, clinical, histological, and treatment variables, related them to outcome. Methodology:Twenty-seven cases were enrolled in this study, who admitted in our Research Institute of Nephrology for TMA during the period from 1995 to 2004, all of them having had a renal biopsy, and the specimens were analyzed both clinically and pathologically. Their clinical, biological, and histological data were investigated. Results:They were 12 males and 15 females, mean age (31.7±13.9)years old. The observed etiologic antecedents of TMA were diarrhea prodrome in 4 cases, post-partum in 2 cases, mitomycin in 3 cases, food poisoning in 2 cases, snakebite in 1 case and unknown in 15 cases. All patients presented thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypertension and renal failure. Among them, 21 cases were required hemodialysis support on admission. In histological examinations, predominant arteriolar involvement, with intimal proliferation and hyperplasia, and secondary glomerular ischemia and collapse were frequently found in 14 patients, among them, cortical necrosis was found in 2 cases. Predominantly glomerular involvement was found in 13 cases. The prognosis of these patients was poor, only six patients with predominantly glomerular involvement, recovered completely. Ten survivors currently have chronic renal failure, and eleven patients developed end stage renal disease. Conclusion:The result of our study suggested that it is very difficult to predict the outcome of TMA based on the clinical findings alone , the disease is much more severe in those patients with predominantly severe vascular damage.",

        "abstract": "Reversal of active glomerular lesions after immunosuppressive treatment in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and their association with prognosis have not been well established.Sixty patients with IgAN who received repeat biopsies after immunosuppressive treatment were recruited. Reversal of renal pathological lesions was evaluated between the first and second biopsy. The end-point was defined as a 30 % reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or end-stage renal disease after the second biopsy.Active glomerular lesions, i.e. endocapillary hypercellularity (E), crescents (C) and necrosis (N) were markedly decreased at the second biopsy after immunosuppressive therapy (36.7 vs. 8.3 %, p < 0.001; 85.0 vs. 25.0 %, p < 0.001; and 51.7 vs. 3.3 %, p < 0.001). Patients with E, C or N at the first biopsy but reversed at the second biopsy showed significantly decreased median levels of proteinuria and hematuria. Such clinical changes were not observed in those with active lesions at both biopsies. After a median follow-up of 32 months, 25.0 % of patients reached the end-point. Repeat biopsy confirmed that only tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis was associated with the renal outcome.Active glomerular lesions can be reversed by immunosuppressive treatment in patients with IgAN. The reversal is accompanied by improvement in proteinuria and hematuria. The reversal of these lesions during the disease process may explain the lack of significant correlation of these lesions with clinical outcomes in the present study as well as in previous evaluation studies of the Oxford classification of IgAN.",

After the treatment, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was performed and the area under curve (AUC) of insulin levels in IPGTT was calculated to evaluate insulin secretory function. The AUC(INS0-30) was calculated to evaluate the early-phase insulin secretion. Immunohistochemical staining for insulin was performed to estimate the beta-cell mass, and beta-cell apoptosis was detected using TUNEL assay.Compared with the control group, rhein-treated group showed significantly reduced blood glucose concentrations at 0, 30, 60 and 120 min after glucose load with significantly higher insulin levels at 30, 60 and 120 min. The early-phase insulin secretion was also obviously increased. The beta-cell mass was obviously rescued by the 8-week treatment with rhein, which also notably improved the staining intensity of insulin and suppressed beta-cell apoptosis compared with the control.Early rhein treatment significantly improves glucose tolerance by restoring the early-phase insulin secretion in db/db mice and inhibiting the apoptosis of the beta-cells, suggesting the potential of rhein as a novel therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes.",

        "title": "Podocyte Lesions in Patients With Obesity-Related Glomerulopathy",
        "abstract": "Background: Obesity-related glomerulopathy is an important complication of obesity that shares some pathophysiological factors relevant to renal damage with diabetic nephropathy. It was recognized that podocyte lesions lead to proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis in patients with some proteinuric glomerular diseases, especially diabetic nephropathy. However, podocyte changes in patients with obesity-related glomerulopathy and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Methods: Glomerular volume, podocyte number, and foot-process width were evaluated in 46 patients with biopsy-proven obesity-related glomerulopathy. Renal tissue from 10 kidney donors served as controls. Results: Glomerular volume was enlarged markedly in patients with obesity-related glomerulopathy ( P < 0.001), with a corresponding decrease in podocyte density ( P < 0.001) compared with controls. Foot-process width on the peripheral glomerular basement membrane was increased significantly, whereas mesangial volume fraction did not differ between patients with obesity-related glomerulopathy and controls. Degree of proteinuria was associated strongly with decreased podocyte density ( P = 0.001), increased foot-process width ( P = 0.001), and decreased podocyte number ( P = 0.002). In addition, the endogenous creatinine clearance rate correlated with decreased podocyte number ( P = 0.008). Interestingly, podocyte number and density correlated significantly with abnormalities in fasting glucose ( P < 0.001) and insulin levels ( P < 0.001) and Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance ( P < 0.001). Conclusion: Decreased podocyte density and number were observed in patients with obesity-related glomerulopathy, and changes in podocytes correlated with degree of proteinuria and renal function impairment in these patients. In addition to the enlargement in glomerular volume with consequential mechanical stretch, metabolic disorders also may contribute to the development of podocyte lesions in patients with obesity-related glomerulopathy.",

The method is based on a mimetic enzyme catalyzed reaction with myoglobin as the catalyst and L-tyrosine as the substrate. A new fluorescent substance was produced that might probably be the coupled dimmer of tyrosine, which, instead of nitryl-tyrosine, was likely to be a new marking substance of ONOO- injury in vivo. Kinetics of the reaction was studied by stopped-flow method and the possible reaction mechanism was also recommended. The optimum conditions of the determination were studied. The proposed method is simple and highly sensitive with a detection limit of 8.20 × 10 -8 mol/L of peroxynitrite. A linear ralationship is obtained over the peroxynitrite concentration range 6.00 × 10-7 mol/L to 3.00 × 10-5 mol/L with a correlation coefficient of 0.9971.",

CECs were isolated from peripheral blood with anti-CD136-coated immunomagnetic Dynabeads and counted by microscopy during biopsy. CEC numbers were compared in each group, as well as the correlation between CECs and C4d and vascular changes in different groups.CECs counts were higher in the acute rejection (AR) with endarteritis group than in the normal group (p < 0.01), acute tubular necrosis (ATN) group (p < 0.01) and chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) group (p < 0.01), there were no difference among ATN, normal and CAN) group (p = 0.587). There was no difference among the normal group without hyaline, normal group with hyaline and CAN with hyaline group. An increasing CECs count was related to C4d-positive AR (p = 0.008; κ score = 0.519) and infiltration of inflammatory cells (p = 0.002, κ score = 0.573) in proximal tubule cells (PTCs). The CECs count decreased after intensive therapy in five patients (p = 0.001).Elevation of the CEC count in blood was related to endarteritis.

        "abstract": "Objective:Lupus nephritis with diffuse proliferation ( type Ⅳ lesion) and membranous lesion (type Ⅴ lesion) is associated with poor prognosis and refractory response to treatment. In this study, we retrospectively compared the clinical efficacy and side-effects in patients with class Ⅳ+Ⅴ lupus nephritis who recieved mycophenolate mofetil(MMF) regime or intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide(CTX) regime. Methodology:Forty-three lupus patients classified as type (Ⅳ+Ⅴ) lupus nephritis after renal biopsy, according to the criteria of ISN/RPS 2003, were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and MMF (MMF group,n=20) or with intravenous methylprednisolone and pulse cyclophophamide (CTX group,n=23). MMF was given at a dosage of 1.5～2.0 g/d, and CTX was administered as intravenous pulse therapy (0.75～1 g/m~2BSA) monthly for at least 6 months. Patients received these two regimes were comparable in general conditions and clinicopathological parameters for the activity and severity of renal damage. Patients in MMF group had a higher average level of serum creatinine. Results:In patients receiving intravenous CTX therapy, the complete remission rate and the partial remission rate at the 6~ thmonth were only 4.4% and 34.8%. While in patients of MMF group, the complete remission rate and the partial remission rate at the 6~ thmonth were 20% and 60%, both with a significant statistic difference (P<0.05). MMF was found more effective in reducing proteinuria and retard the deterioration of renal function. Repeated biopsy data analysis revealed that vasculitic and proliferative lesions disappeared in MMF group. No significant change of membranous lesion was found in patients of both group. MMF was better tolerated with lower adverse reaction rate, such as pneumonia and upper gastrointestinal symptoms. No patient dropped out for side effect. Conclusion:The combined therapy of MMF and steroid is more effective and tolerable than CTX pulse therapy in the induction treatment of patient with LN(Ⅵ+Ⅴ). MMF was more effective in improving renal vasculitic lesion. No significant ascendancy in controlling membranous lesion was found in MMF treated patients.",

        "abstract": "Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a potent immunosuppressant that inhibits the activity of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo synthesis of guanosine nucleotides. MMF has been used widely in solid-organ transplantation. Increased evidence indicated that MMF exhibited beneficial effects on various types of vasculitis, for reasons that were not fully understood. Endothelial cells play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of vasculitis. Endothelium may not only be the main target for injury, but also be able to amplify the inflammatory response by adhesion molecule expression, leukocyte adhesion, cytokine production and angiogenesis. In the present study, the effect of mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active metabolite of MMF, on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was investigated. MPA markedly inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha)-induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) mRNA and surface expression, suppressed TNFalpha-induced neutrophils adhesion to endothelial cells, and reduced TNFalpha-induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion. The inhibitory effects of MPA on ICAM-1 surface expression and IL-6 secretion were not attenuated by addition of guanosine, implying that inhibition of these processes were not due to intracellular guanosine nucleotides depletion. MPA also decreased angiogenesis of endothelial cells in three-dimensional collagen gel culture system, reduced the migration in a wounded monolayer of endothelial cells, and inhibited the proliferation of endothelial cells. In conclusion, MPA exhibited multifarious effects on endothelial cells including inhibition of ICAM-1 expression, neutrophil attachment, IL-6 secretion, and the process of angiogenesis, which might contribute to the efficacy of MMF in the treatment of vasculitis.",

        "abstract": "Aristolochic Acid Nephropathy (AAN) is regarded as a kind of toxic nephropathy caused by the formation of DNA- aristolochic acid adducts in renal parenchymal cells. However, the underlying mechanisms driving the progression of renal interstitial fibrosis in AAN still remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate the role of some immunological factors, especially mast cells (MCs), in the pathogenesis of AAN. Sixteen patients with AAN were enrolled in this study, including five acute and 11 chronic AAN. Monoclonal antibodies against human tryptase, alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), and CD68 were applied on serial sections, which were further counterstained with Periodic Acid-Schiff. It was found that massive tryptase-positive MCs were observed in the fibrotic areas in chronic AAN, especially around thickened tubular basement membranes where myofibroblasts accumulated too. In contrast, MCs infiltrated to a less extent in acute AAN, and were barely found in normal control kidneys. In chronic AAN, the number of MCs in the tubulointerstitium was positively correlated with the degree of renal fibrosis (r=0.64, P <0.05), but not with serum creatinine levels. Meanwhile, the recruitment of MCs into the renal interstitium is accompanied with local proliferation of myofibroblasts. Macrophages were not abundant, neither in acute nor in chronic AAN. Our findings show for the first time that mast cell infiltration seems to be associated with the progression of fibrosis in the renal tubulointerstitium in chronic AAN.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Tacrolimus concentration per dose is associated with CYP3A5 genotype.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute rejection and the adverse effect of tacrolimus of the posttransplant population with different CYP3A5 genotype.Methodology:Sixty-seven kidney recipients receiving the triple immunosuppressive(tacrolimus+mycophenolate mofetil+prednison) were grouped according to the CYP3A5 genotype(*1/*1,*1/*3,*3/*3).The initial dose of tacrolimus was 0.15 mg/(kg·d) and the dosage was adjusted according to the drug concentration to a target therapeutic window.All patients underwent a protocol biopsy at one month posttransplantation.In each patient we assayed the tacrolimus blood trough concentration and calculated the concentration per dosage during the follow up.The acute rejection and the adverse effect of tacrolimus was also investigated.Results:The blood concentration of tacrolimus showed significant difference on 7th day and one month,while no significant difference on 3,6,and 12 month among the three groups.The CYP3A5*3/*3 group had the largest C/D(concentration per dosage) and the CYP3A5*1/*1 group had the smallest C/D.The ratio of acute rejection showed significant difference among the three groups within 3 months and no significant difference during 3 to 12 months after transplantation.The adverse effects of tacrolimus(nephrotoxicity,hyperglycosemia,neurotoxicity) were increased in CYP3A5*3/*3 group compared with CYP3A5*1/*1 group within 3 months.Conclusion:The blood concentration of tacrolimus was lowest in *1/*1 genotype group within 3 months which induced the deficient immunosuppression and higher acute rejection rate,and highest in *3/*3 genotype group within 3 months which resulting in higher adverse effects.To choose the initial dosage according to the CYP3A5 genotype is necessary for getting better outcome and reducing acute rejection in the CYP3A5*1/*1 group and the adverse effect of tacrolimus in the CYP3A5*3/*3 group.",

Methodology:Twelve patients (female 5,male 7,age 43~72 years ) with new onset and active AAV were included this study.BVAS scores were (14.7±3.2).10 patients had serum positive P/MPO-ANCA,the others had serum positive C/PR3-ANCA,and the average levels of ANCA were (275±33.9) RU/ml.On admission, they had a mean SCr of (549±197) μmol/L and all of them needed renal replacement therapy.Every case had renal biopsy,and histological patterns were classified into focal (≥50% normal glomeruli,n=1),crescentic (≥50% glomeruli with cellular crescents,n=5),mixed (<50% crescentic and < 50% globally sclerotic glomeruli,n=3) and sclerotic (≥50% globally sclerotic glomeruli,n=3). All of them were received DFPP treatment as well as methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by oral prednisone and mycophenloate mofetil (MMF) or intravenous cyclophosphamide pulse therapy. Double volumes of plasma were processed during each DFPP session every other day. EC50W and EC20W (Asahi Kasei Corporation, Japan) were used as first filter for plasma separation and second filter for plasma fractionation, respectively.The changes of ANCA and renal function were investigated. Results:All patients were treated with DFPP for 3~5 times. At the end of DFPP,the serum level of MPO-ANCA from [(275±33.9) to (1 112±55.1) RU/ml,P<0.01] was lower significantly,with a decrement of (60.0±18.1)%. Ten patients (83.3%) were free from dialysis, while one patient (the pathologic classification was crescentic) was followed only one month have not been free from dialysis,the other one without improvement of renal function received maintenance hemodialysis.Ten patients who free from dialysis after DFPP were followed 6.20±4.80 (1~15 months). Among them,renal function recovered normal in one case (the pathologic classification was focal),stable in 8 patients (three were mixed,three were crescentic and two sclerotic) remained stable, and the serum creatinine increased again in the last one (crescentic) who received maintenance hemodialysis. No adverse effects were observed in DFPP treatment occurred. Conclusion:Double filtration plasmapheresis treatment could effectively decrease serum level of ANCA and improve renal function.The efficacy of different pathologic classification should be further investigated.",

        "abstract": "Rhein, an anthraquinone compound isolated from rhubarb, has been shown to improve glucose metabolism disorders in diabetic mice. The mechanism underlying the protective effect of rhein, however, remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that rhein can protect the pancreatic β-cells against hyperglycemia-induced cell apoptosis through stabilizing mitochondrial morphology. Oral administration of rhein for 8 or 16 weeks in db/db mice significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG) level and improved glucose tolerance. Cell apoptosis assay using both pancreatic sections and cultured pancreatic β-cells indicated that rhein strongly inhibited β-cell apoptosis. Morphological study showed that rhein was mainly localized at β-cell mitochondria and rhein could preserve mitochondrial ultrastructure by abolishing hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) expression. Western blot and functional analysis confirmed that rhein protected the pancreatic β-cells against hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis via suppressing mitochondrial Drp1 level. Finally, mechanistic study further suggested that decreased Drp1 level by rhein might be due to its effect on reducing cellular reactive oxygen species. Taken together, our study demonstrates for the first time that rhein can serve as a novel therapeutic agent for hyperglycemia treatment and rhein protects pancreatic β-cells from apoptosis by blocking the hyperglycemia-induced Drp1 expression.",

The effects of factors on the leaching rate, such as stirring speed, temperature and total ammonium concentration, were studied experimentally. The results show that increasing temperature and total ammonium concentration can enhance the leaching rate remarkably, while when the speed is larger than 250 r/min, the stirring has no obvious effect on the leach. The leach process obeys the grain model with porous diffusion control, indicating that the diffusion and chemical reaction take place, not only on the outer surface of the particles, but also on the out surface together with the cavities of the porous particles. Kinetic studies demonstrate that the leach process is controlled by the porous diffusion, determining the apparent active energy and reaction order to be 71.35 kJ/mol and 4.27, respectively.",

Proteinuria and hypertension were the most common symptoms, with incidences of 88.9 and 77.8%, respectively. Two patients had abnormal renal function. Their histological appearances varied. Massive eosinophilic and weakly periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive substances were deposited along the capillary loops and in the mesangial area in three cases, while others had thickened capillary walls with a chain-like structure or double-contour appearance of the PAS- and silver-stained sections. Immunofluorescence analysis showed the abundant deposition of collagen type III. Electron microscopy revealed massive scattered or bundle-shaped fibre-like materials in the subendothelial and mesangial areas.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sufficient dose of mycophenolate mofetil combined with low-dose tacrolimus and corticosteroid regimen may be an ideal treatment option for renal transplant recipients, and the regimen has been widely used in clinic due to its low nephrotoxicity, few adverse reactions and strong immunosuppressive effects. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil combined with low-dose tacrolimus and corticosteroid regimen in renal transplantation patients with the control of mycophenolate mofetil combined with standard-dose tacrolimus and corticosteroid. METHODS: A total of 210 patients receiving a single-organ renal allograft were randomly divided into standard-dose tacrolimus group (n=104) and low-dose tacrolimus group (n=106). Individual patients were treated for 12 months. The primary efficacy endpoints were the chronic allograft damage index and glomerular filtration rate at 12 months after transplantation. The secondary efficacy end points mainly included the acute rejection rate, treatment failure rate, and the survival rate of patient and transplant kidney. The safety parameters such as new onset of post-transplantation diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidemia were also evaluated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The vast majorities of patients were administrated with sufficient dose of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g/d or above) in two groups. The majority of the patients in standard-dose tacrolimus group had the mean trough level below the protocol-defined, which led to the similar mean trough level between standard-dose and low-dose tacrolimus group. These could also confirm that the regimen of mycophenolate mofetil combined with low-dose tacrolimus and corticosteroid had been wildly accepted and used by clinicians. The efficacy and safety of two groups were similar. The mean chronic allograft damage index of the renal pathological changes at 12 months after transplantation in standard-dose and low-dose tacrolimus group were 1.82 and 2.13 respectively (P=0.081 3), the mean glomerular filtration rates were 77.08 mL/min and 80.12 mL/min (P=0.794 9), acute rejection rates were 2.6% and 5.2% (P=0.681 2), and the survival rates of patients and transplant kidney were 100% and 99.1% (P=1.000 0). The rates of new onset of post-transplantation diabetes mellitus in the standard-dose and low-dose tacrolimus group were 2.9% and 1.9%, and the rates of hyperlipidemia were 2.9% and 3.8%, respectively. For the regimen of mycophenolate mofetil combined with tacrolimus and corticosteroid, the utilization of sufficient dose of mycophenolate mofetil could reduce the dose of tacrolimus, thereby significantly reducing the nephrotoxicity, hyperlipidemia and new onset of post-transplantation diabetes mellitus caused by tacrolimus and achieving a good balance of efficacy and toxicity when maintaining a strong immune inhibition and reducing the acute rejection incidence successfully.",

        "abstract": "Although multiple factors contribute to the initiation and progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN), hyperglycemia and genetic predisposition are two major components implicated in the development of DN. Several pieces of experimental evidence suggest that glucose transporter (GLUT1) activity is an important modulator for the cell hypertrophy and extracellular matrix formation of glomerular mesangial cells.To evaluate the role of the GLUT1 gene mutation in the development of DN in Chinese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), the polymorphic XbaI site of GLUT1 gene was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction in 124 normal subjects and 131 patients with NIDDM, among whom 64 were complicated with DN. DN was defined as persistent albuminuria with or without impaired renal function with no known cause of renal disease other than diabetes.The frequencies of XbaI (+/-) genotype (75 vs. 44%, P < 0.01) and XbaI (-) allele (44 vs. 29%, P < 0.05) were significantly higher in NIDDM patients with DN than those without nephropathy. There were no significant differences for GLUT1 genotype and allele frequency between NIDDM patients without nephropathy and normal subjects. The presence of the XbaI (-) allele appeared to have a strong association with the development of DN. The odds ratio was 1.915, and the 95% confidence interval was 1.044 to 3.514. In addition, no strong association was found between GLUT1 gene polymorphism and retinopathy in NIDDM patients.Our results indicate that the XbaI (-) allele of the GLUT1 gene might be a genetic marker of NIDDM with DN, and this genetic susceptibility is independent of its retinopathy in Chinese subjects.",

        "abstract": "Double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) and (IA) are both used to clear antibody. However, the clinical efficacy and safety of DFPP in patients with anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease are unclear.The 28 enrolled patients diagnosed serologically and pathologically with anti-GBM disease from 2003 to 2013 included 16 treated with DFPP and 12 with IA, with all patients administered immunosuppressive agents. DFPP consisted of an EC50W filter for plasma separation and an EC20W filter for plasma fractionation. A double volume of plasma was processed, and each patient received a 30-40 g human albumin supplement during each session. IA consisted of 10 cycles per session, with 8-10 sessions performed daily or every other day and each session regenerating 30-60 L of plasma. Serum anti-GBM antibodies and IgG were measured, and urinary and blood tests were performed, before and after each procedure. Renal function and outcome were determined.The 28 patients consisted of 13 males and 15 females, of median age 44.5 years (range, 22.5-57 years). Six patients had pulmonary hemorrhage and 18 had serum creatinine concentrations >500 umol/L. The average serum creatinine concentration at early onset of disease was 525 umol/L while the peak concentration was 813 umol/L. All patients showed progressive increases in serum creatinine and required CRRT during the course of disease. Pathological examination showed an average 73.9% of crescents (range, 54.6-95.4%).The clinical and pathological features of the DPPP and IA groups were similar. Efficacy of clearing anti-GBM antibody was similar in the two groups (59.0 vs. 71.2%, P = 1.00), although fewer patients in the DFPP group experienced reduced IgG (62.7 vs. 83.5%, p = 0.002). One patient each had a pulmonary hemorrhage and a subcutaneous hemorrhage during treatment, but there were no other serious complications. At the end of follow-up, patient survival and renal survival were similar in the DFPP and IA groups.DPPP plus immunosuppressive therapy efficiently and safely removed anti-GBM antibodies. The fewer plasma-associated side effects and reduced loss of IgG suggest that DFPP may be a better treatment choice for anti-GBM disease, especially in patients with insufficient plasma.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the efficacy of different combination of liquid-based cervical cytological test(LCT) and hybrid capture II(HC-Ⅱ)human papillomavirus(HPV)test in cervical cancer screening.Methods HC-Ⅱ HPV test and LCT were performed for cervical cancer screening in 5217 women aged 25~59 years in Shenzhen from May 2004 to May 2009.Any of the women with positve results by HC-Ⅱ HPV test or abnormal cytology underwent colposcopy examination.We used pathological results as the final diagnosis to evaluate the value of different combination of the two tests in cervical cancer screening.Results The HPV-positive rate and LCT-positive rate were increased with the increased level of cervical lesions(P<0.05).We compared the values of six schemes of the combination in detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia(CIN) grade 2 or above and found that the HC-Ⅱ HPV test was more sensitive than LCT,the HPV-LCT parallel test showed higher sensitivity and negative prediction value(NPV),the HPV-based screening showed higher specificity and positive prediction value(PPV),the HPV-LCT series tests reduced the number of colposcopy examination and the LCT-based screening reduced the number of screening.Conclusion Both HC-Ⅱ HPV test and LCT are valuable in screening cervical cancer at present.We should select the scheme of their different combination based on our needs in cervical cancer screening.",

        "abstract": "Our aim was to investigate the clinical efficacy of double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) in the treatment of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-(ANCA) associated vasculitis (AAV) with severe renal involvement. Fifteen AAV patients who had severe renal failure (median SCr 5.6(IQR 5.2-9.0) mg/dL) and needed initial renal replacement therapy (RRT) were treated with DFPP and immunosuppressive therapy. Two plasma volumes were processed during each DFPP session. The changes of serum ANCA and renal function were investigated. After the DFPP treatment for three to five sessions, serum MPO-ANCA level decreased from 250.0 ± 86.9 RU/mL to 70.5 ± 64.7RU/mL (P = 0.00), with a median reduction rate of 67.6%. Eleven patients (73.3%) no longer needed from RRT 3 months after DFPP treatment, while another four patients remained on dialysis. During the follow up for median 10 (IQR 6-24) months, SCr level decreased to normal in one patient, one patient progressed into ESRD. The 1 year renal survival rate was 62.9%. Five (33.3%) patients were complicated with pulmonary infection. DFPP combined with immunosuppressive therapy could increase the renal recovery rate through rapidly decreasing serum ANCA levels for AAV patients with severe renal failure, but its clinical efficacy and impact on long-term renal survival require further studies.",

The aim of this study was to assess the value of plasma NTproBNP with regard to recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE).NTproBNP levels were measured in 224 consecutive patients with the first episode of acute pulmonary embolism occurring from January 2005 through October 2010. Patients were categorized into two groups by NTproBNP reference range. Follow-ups were performed at 3, 6, and 12months and yearly thereafter. The primary end point was symptomatic, recurrent fatal or nonfatal VTE.NTproBNP was elevated in 158 (70.5%) patients and not elevated in 66 (29.5%) patients. After a mean follow-up period of 31.0±19.4months, patients with elevated NTproBNP showed an increased risk of recurrent VTE (20 patients, 12.7%) compared to those without elevated NTproBNP (only 1 patient, 1.5%) (P=0.009). Of the 7 deaths related to pulmonary embolism, 6 occurred in patients with elevated NTproBNP compared to patients with normal NTproBNP (1 of 7 deaths). In a multivariate analysis stratified by oral anticoagulant treatment duration, elevated NTproBNP was an independent predictor of recurrent VTE (hazard ratio, 9.32; P=0.02).Elevated NTproBNP is associated with recurrent VTE in acute pulmonary embolism patients.",

YKL-40, a marker of tissue remodelling and inflammation, has recently been recognized as a risk predictor of cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. The study aimed to investigate a potential role of YKL-40 in predicting prognosis in idiopathic PAH (IPAH).Plasma YKL-40 levels were measured in 82 IPAH patients without current or previous PAH-specific treatment during right heart catheterization and in 54 healthy volunteers. Concurrent data included clinical, haemodynamic and biochemical variables.Plasma YKL-40 levels were increased in IPAH patients compared with control subjects (median, interquartile range: IPAH: 24.90, 17.68-39.78 ng/mL; controls: 16.58, 14.20-19.64 ng/mL; P < 0.001). YKL-40 levels correlated with cardiac index (r = -0.244, P = 0.027) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP, r = 0.263, P = 0.017). After a median follow-up of 578 days, YKL-40 outperformed NT-proBNP, uric acid, and 6-min walk distance in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses in predicting both clinical worsening (area under the curve (AUC) 0.681) and death (AUC 0.717). Compared with patients with YKL-40 below the ROC-derived cut-off point (24.5 ng/mL), the high YKL-40 group showed higher pulmonary vascular resistance and serum uric acid levels, and showed more clinical worsening events and deaths in Kaplan-Meier analyses. Plasma YKL-40 was independently associated with clinical worsening in univariate and multivariate Cox analyses (all P < 0.05).Plasma YKL-40 might serve as a promising indicator of disease severity and prognosis in patients with IPAH.",

Under ammonia atmosphere, mesoporous TiO₂ spheres are directly converted into mesoporous TiN spheres with the addition of cyanamide to retain the original morphology. The electrochemical performance of the resultant mesoporous TiN spheres demonstrates that this material can be a promising electrode material for nonaqueous supercapacitors with high energy densities.",

        "abstract": "Organ-specific microRNAs have essential roles in maintaining normal organ function. However, the microRNA profile of the kidney and the role of microRNAs in modulating renal function remain undefined. We performed an unbiased assessment of the genome-wide microRNA expression profile in 14 mouse organs using Solexa deep sequencing and found that microRNA-196a (miR-196a) and miR-196b are selectively expressed in kidney, with 74.37% of mouse total miR-196a and 73.19% of mouse total miR-196b distributed in the kidneys. We confirmed the predominant expression of miR-196a/b in mouse and human kidney, particularly in the glomeruli and tubular epithelium, by quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization assays. During unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced mouse renal fibrosis, renal miR-196a/b levels rapidly decreased. Elevation of renal miR-196a/b expression by hydrodynamic-based delivery of a miR-196a/b-expressing plasmid before or shortly after UUO significantly downregulated profibrotic proteins, including collagen 1 and α-smooth muscle actin, and mitigated UUO-induced renal fibrosis. In contrast, depletion of renal miR-196a/b by miR-196a/b antagomirs substantially aggravated UUO-induced renal fibrosis. Mechanistic studies further identified transforming growth factor beta receptor II (TGFβR2) as a common target of miR-196a and miR-196b. Decreasing miR-196a/b expression in human HK2 cells strongly activated TGF-β-Smad signaling and cell fibrosis; whereas increasing miR-196a/b levels in mouse primary cultured tubular epithelial cells inhibited TGF-β-Smad signaling. In the UUO model, miR-196a/b silenced TGF-β-Smad signaling, decreased the expression of collagen 1 and α-smooth muscle actin, and attenuated renal fibrosis. Our findings suggest that elevating renal miR-196a/b levels may be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating renal fibrosis.",

Nevertheless, the role of RPS15A in the progression of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unknown. In the present study, by comparing the publicly available data from RCC tissues and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction results, it was identified that RPS15A was upregulated in RCC tissues and cell lines (P<0.001). Notably, knockdown of RPS15A suppressed 786‑O cell proliferation (P<0.001) and promoted its apoptosis/necrotic (P=0.0001) in vitro. Additionally, tumour formation and growth of transfected 786‑O cells were observed to be restrained in a mouse model (P<0.05). Subsequent to analysing the microarray data, 747 genes were differentially expressed in the RPS15A‑knockdown 786‑O cells. The enriched canonical pathways, diseases and functions of differentially expressed genes, and the interactive network of RPS15A in RCC were successfully constructed by ingenuity pathway analysis. Overall, the present results provided a preliminary experimental basis for RPS15A as a novel oncogene and potential therapeutic target in RCC.",

To get a fully connected and secure network, we introduce secrecy transfer which combines random graph and random geometric graph via the propagation of acquaintanceship to produce an acquaintanceship graph G n,n0, a kind of random geometric graph with each edge representing an acquaintanceship between two nodes. We find that components of graph G n,n0 that undergoes a phase transition from small components to a giant component when n 0 is larger than a threshold, the threshold for G n,n0 to be a connected graph is derived.

Characteristic statistic algorithm (CSA) is very fit for the problem. In the past, the reloading optimization using CSA has shortcomings of separating the fuel assemblies' loading pattern (LP) optimization from burnable absorber's placement (BP) optimization. In this study, LP and BP were optimized simultaneously using CSA coupled with CYCLE2D, which is a core analysis code. The corresponding reloading coupling optimization software, CSALPBP, was developed. The 10th cycle reloading design of Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant was optimized using CSALPBP.

However, the expression of proteins involved in intracellular vesicular trafficking in pulmonary vasculature in PAH remains unclear.To elucidate possible roles of proteins involved in intracellular vesicular trafficking in the development of PAH in rats treated with monocrotaline, changes in the expression of N-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), α-soluble NSF attachment protein (α-SNAP) and synaptosome-associated membrane protein (SNAP) 23 were examined together with expression of caveolin-1 (cav-1), endogenous nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), type 2 bone morphogenetic receptor (BMPR2) and cellular apoptosis.The mRNA expression was investigated by real time-PCR and protein expression by immunoblot method in rat lung. Caspase-3 was used as an indicator of cellular apoptosis and examined by immunoblot method.During the development of PAH, mRNA and protein expression of NSF, α-SNAP and SNAP23 all significantly increased before pulmonary arterial pressure started to increase, then all significantly decreased when PAH established. The expression of eNOS and BMPR2 changed similarly, while the mRNA and protein of cav-1 both downregulated after monocrotaline treatment. Caspase-3 was also increased after exposure to monocrotaline.Since the expression of NSF, α-SNAP and SNAP23 changed greatly during the onset of PAH and accompanied with abnormal expression of eNOS, BMPR2 and cav-1 and with enhanced cellular apoptosis, NSF, α-SNAP and SNAP23 appear to be associated with the development of PAH in rats treated with monocrotaline.",

        "abstract": "Despite distinct renal lesions, a series of rare glomerular nephropathies are reportedly mediated by complement overactivation. Genetic variations in complement genes contribute to disease risk, but the relationship of genotype to phenotype has not been straightforward. Here, we screened 11 complement genes from 91 patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type I (MPGN I), and identified the concomitant presence of three missense variations located within the human complement Factor H (CFH) gene cluster. The three variations, rs55807605, rs61737525 and rs57960694, have strong linkage disequilibrium; subsequent haplotype analysis indicated that ATA increased the susceptibility of these renal diseases. In silico analysis, the CFHR3 rs61737525-T risk allele altered the physical and structural properties and generated a reduction in binding affinity of the CFHR3/C3b complex. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding analysis further demonstrated the substitution induced a decrease of two orders of magnitude in C3b-binding properties, with a declined cofactor activity in fluid phase. These data suggest that the haplotype carrying the causative allele behaves as a partial C3 convertase deficiency, predisposing individuals to diverse pathologic lesions underlying complement overactivation. Such genotype-phenotype discrepancies allow better understanding about these nephropathies mediated by genetic complement disorders.",

        "abstract": "Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis using high cutoff filters (HCO-CVVHD) is a promising technique, which may be effective to decrease the extremely high level of circulating myoglobin in patients with rhabdomyolysis (RM). Here, we report a patient with RM caused by heat stroke who was successfully treated by HCO-CVVHD. A male patient received HCO-CVVHD with 4 L/h dialysate for 5 days and then pre-dilution continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) at a dose of 4 L/h until recovery of renal function. The clearance of myoglobin and albumin at 5 minutes, and at 4, 12, and 24 hours were calculated. The serum myoglobin level decreased from a peak of 25,400 ng/mL on admission to 133 ng/mL at discharge. During HCO-CVVHD, the mean clearances of serum myoglobin at four timepoints were 61.3 (range, 61.0-61.6), 52.3 (38.9-65.8), 47.3 (46.8-47.9), and 43.7 (39.5-48.0) mL/min, respectively, and the mean clearances of albumin were 12.4 (range, 11.8-13.1), 3.1 (2.5-3.8), 1.2 (1.0-1.4), and 0.8 (0.6-1.0) mL/min, respectively. During CVVH, the clearance rates of myoglobin at 5 minutes and 24 hours were 17.0 and 3.8 mL/min, respectively, with a negligible clearance of albumin. HCO-CVVHD can effectively decrease serum myoglobin in patients with RM because of much higher clearance of myoglobin than CVVH. However, attention should be paid to albumin loss during HCO-CVVHD.",

        "abstract": "A novel mixed alkali metal hydrated borate NaCs[B10O14(OH)4] was synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. Its structure was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and further characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, TG-DTA, powder X-ray diffraction, and chemical analysis. NaCs[B10O14(OH)4] crystallizes in monoclinic space group P2/c with a = 7.6588(3) Å, b = 9.0074(3) Å, c = 11.8708(6) Å, and β = 115.682(3)°. The crystal structure of NaCs[B10O14(OH)4] consists of Na–O, Cs–O polyhedral, and [B10O14(OH)4]2− polyborate anions. [B10O14(OH)4]2− units are connected together through common oxygen atoms forming a 1D helical chain-like structure, which are further connected by O–H···O hydrogen bonds forming a 3D supramolecular structure. Through a designed thermochemical cycle, the standard molar enthalpy of formation of this borate was determined to be −7888.6 ± 8.1 kJ mol−1 by using a heat conduction microcalorimeter.",

Experiment results demonstrated that the bias configuration corresponding to the worst performance degradation depended on the dose rate. For the high dose rate irradiation, the case with all terminals floating shown an enhanced degradation, while during the low dose rate irradiation, the forward active mode suffered more irradiation damage. The underlying physical mechanisms were analyzed and investigated in detail. It was indicated that the varied bias dependences for the high and low dose rate irradiation might be attributed to different origins of hole and proton induced by gamma irradiation. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Methodology:Thirty-nine patients with severe HSPN proven clinically and histologically were enrolled into this study. They were divided into MMF and CTX groups. MMF group included 21 cases who were treated with MMF at a dosage of 1.5～2.0 g/d. CTX group enrolled 18 cases who were geven 0.6～0.75 g/m~2 BSA monthly for 6 months and then quarterly. The patients in both groups also received methylprednisolone (MP) pulse therapy followed by oral predenisone. The two groups were matched in age and severity of renal damage. One in MMF group and six patients in CTX group were lost follow-up, and two patients in CTX group were dropped out during the therapy. The other patients were followed up for more than 12 months. The clinical efficacy and side effects were compared between the two groups. Results:①Clinical efficacy: The total remission rate (complete remission and partial remission) in the 6~ th, 9~ thand 12~ thmonth after MMF therapy were 65%,85% and 95%, while only 58.3%, 58.3% and 58.3% in CTX group respectively. The complete remission rate in MMF vs CTX Group were 25% vs 8.3%, 40% vs 25% and 50% vs 25%(P>0.05),respectively. ②The complete remission rate of proteinuria (≤0.4 g/24h) in the 6~ thand 12~ thmonth after the MMF vs CTX therapy were 45% vs 16.7% and 70% vs 25%(P<0.05),respectively. ③The complete remission rate of Urinary RBC count(≤10×10~4/ml) in the 6~ thmonth after the MMF vs CTX therapy were 45% vs 16.7%. ④Renal function:5 of six cases recovered renal function after treatment with MMF for 3 months, and one for 6 months. In CTX group, four cases recovered their renal function after treatment for 3 months. ⑤Side effects: There were no significant side effects in both groups. Only one was dropped out owing to severe side effect in CTX group.⑥Recurrence: Two cases relapsed in MMF group, while five cases relapsed in CTX group. Conclusion:The combination therapy of MMF and steroid was more effective than CTX pulse therapy in patients with severe HSPN. MMF could have more efficacy in reducing proteinuria, haematuria with fewer complications and lower relapse.",

Twenty-seven MMF therapeutic and twenty-five CTX therapeutic lupus patients with >or=50% crescent formation were enrolled in this study. The general conditions, clinicopathological findings, remission and relapse ratio, and outcomes of them were compared.There was no significant difference of general condition and clinicopathological findings between MMF and CTX group. At 12 months, the total remission ratio in MMF and CTX group were 73.1% and 69.6%, while the complete remission ratio in MMF group (53.8%) was significantly higher than that in CTX group (26.1%). The relapse ratio in MMF group (10.5%) was significantly lower than in CTX group (43.8%). Forty per cent of PR patients in CTX group suffered from relapse. Until June 2005, the patients in CTX group received a follow time with 38.5 +/- 21.2 (range 10 approximately 80) months, and in MMF group the follow time was 41.1 +/- 27.0 (range 12 approximately 90) months. Two patients in MMF group and two in CTX group entered into end stage renal failure. The side effect of infection was more significant in CTX group.Higher complete remission ratio and lower relapse ratio were observed in MMF group than in CTX group. The side effect of infection was more infrequent in MMF group, which showed preferable security of MMF.",

        "abstract": "Objective: by a case-controlled design,to investigate the effect of combined therapy using double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) and oral statins on severe hypercholesterolemia in resistant nephrotic syndrome (NS) . Methodology: Twenty two patients with severe hypercholesterolemia caused by resistant NS were enrolled in this study. They were divided into three groups as follow: 2 of them in the group receiving a single session of DFPP alone (DFPP group) ,8 in the group receiving a single session of DFPP combined with oral Atorvastatin (Combination group) ,and 12 in the group receiving oral Atorvastatin alone (Statins group) . Other treatments for primary disease and symptom-control remained unchanged. All patients were followed-up to 4 weeks. Results: The baseline levels of serum total cholesterol (TC) were ( 12. 7 ±1. 40) mmol/L in DFPP group,( 17. 1 ±4. 70) mmol/L in combination group,and ( 15. 4 ±5. 10) mmol / L in statins group ( P > 0. 05) . Single session of DFPP decreased serum TC by ( 85. 8% ± 7. 20% ) ( P < 0. 01) , accompanied with a decline of plasma immunoglobulin A ( IgA) ,M and fibrinogen ( P < 0. 01) but not albumin or IgG. No remission was found in the all groups during 4 weeks follow-up. During the follow-up period,compared with baseline data,serum TC was 85. 9% at the 1 week,100% at the 2 week,and 134% at the end in DFPP group,serum TC was below 50% in the first 2 weeks,and 70. 2% at the end in combination group,and serum TC was around 81. 1% through the whole period in the statins group. The levels of serum TC were significantly lower than that in the other groups at the first two weeks ( P < 0. 01 ) . Conclusion: Oral statin alone can only decline lipids slightly in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia due to resistant nephrosis,while combined therapy using DFPP plus oral statin can decrease lipids to a larger extent in these patients.",

The primary end point was change from baseline to 12 weeks in exercise capacity assessed by 6 min walk (6MW) test. Secondary end points included changes in WHO class and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics. Clinical worsening was defined as death, transplantation, hospitalization for PAH, or initiation of additional therapies for PAH, such as intravenous epoprostenol or oral bosentan.After 12 weeks, the compliance was good in 56 patients. Significant improvement was seen in NYHA heart function class and WHO class as compared to baseline (P < 0.01): from class IV to class III in 2, from class III to class II in 8 and to class I in 2 cases, and from class II to class I in 5 cases. No NYHA heart function class and WHO PAH function class deterioration were observed. Oral sildenafil increased 6MW distance, from (352 ± 80) m to (396 ± 78) m, with a change of (44 ± 70) m (P < 0.01). Significant improvement was seen in hemodynamics (mean pulmonary artery pressure, P < 0.01; cardiac index, P < 0.01; pulmonary vascular resistance, P < 0.01) at week 12 as compared with baseline. Mean right atrial pressure decreased (3 ± 11) mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa), mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased (6 ± 14) mm Hg, cardiac output increased (1.1 ± 2.0) L/min, cardiac index increased (0.7 ± 1.1) L×min(-1)×m(-2), and total pulmonary resistance decreased (490 ± 831) Dys×s×cm(-5). Side effects were mild and consistent with those reported with sildenafil treatment. No statistically significant clinical worsening was observed with sildenafil therapy for PAH patients.Sildenafil improves exercise capacity, WHO functional class, and hemodynamics in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.",

        "title": "Highly sensitive spectrofluorimetric determination of ascorbic acid based on its enhancement effect on a mimetic enzyme-catalyzed reaction",
        "abstract": "A spectrofluorimetric method for determining ascorbic acid based on its enhancement on the fluorescence of the mimetic enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of p -cresol by hydrogen peroxide was proposed. The optimal conditions were found. The influence of different buffers and concentrations on the relative fluorescence intensity was tested, which showed that the enhancement effect was the most evident in NH 3 –NH 4 Cl solution, especially at high NH 3 concentration. The reaction product was monitored fluorimetrically, with a 3σ detection limit of 3.45×10 −10 mol l −1 ascorbic acid. A liner calibration graph was obtained over the ascorbic acid concentration range 1×10 −9 –8×10 −8 mol l −1 , with a correlation coefficient of 0.9997 ( n =18). The relative standard derivation at an ascorbic acid concentration of 3×10 −8 mol l −1 was 1.2% ( n =9). The varying influence of different concentrations of ascorbic acid on the redox reaction was observed through 3D fluorescent spectra and progress curves. Keywords Ascorbic acid Spectrofluorimetric determination Enhancement effect Mimetic enzyme Hydrogen peroxide 1 Introduction Due to the great importance of ascorbic acid (AA) in human beings, the determination of AA has gained increased significance in several areas of analytical chemistry such as in pharmaceutical, clinical and food applications. A variety of methods for determining AA has been reviewed [1–3] . Spectrofluorimetric analysis is well known for its sensitivity and speed. There have been many reports on the application of fluorimetric methods for determining AA. Deutsch and Weeks [4] reported a microfluorimetric assay for AA, which was accepted as an official AOAC method. In their method, AA was oxidized with activated charcoal (Norit) to dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA) and then the latter reacted with o -phenylenediamine (OPDA) to form a fluorescent product. Fluorescence measurements were made after equilibrium was reached. This method shows good selectivity for samples containing large amounts of reducing interference, but it is tedious and time consuming because the sample is percolated through a column containing Norit or mixed with Norit and filtered. Several improvements on the fluorimetric method have been reported [5,6] , where Norit was replaced by other oxidants such as N -bromosuccinimide, and other coupling reagents, e.g. 4-nitro-1,2-phenylenediamine, were used instead of OPDA to react with DHAA. Automatic techniques and kinetic methods were also introduced into the fluorimetric determination [7,8] . The growing interest in enzymatic methods for the determination of AA has been demonstrated in reports in which ascorbic acid oxidase (EC 1.11.1.17) or peroxidase (EC 1.10.3.3) was used. In the ascorbic acid oxidase-based determination [9] , AA was oxidized with oxygen catalyzed by the enzyme. The decrease of oxygen in the system was monitored by an electrode, which responded linearly to AA concentration. In the peroxidase-catalyzed method [10] , the determination was based on the interference of AA with the peroxidase-catalyzed reactions of hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen donor molecules [11] . The interaction of AA and other substrates resulted in a lag phase in the reaction progress curves, the duration and degree of which depended on the ascorbate concentration. Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) was also used for determining AA [12] . The present work has developed a new fluorimetric method for determining AA, in which β-cyclodextrin-hemin (β-CD-hemin) was used as the mimetic enzyme for peroxidase. As we know, mimetic enzymes do have some advantages over natural enzymes in some aspects, for example a solution of synthesized mimetic enzymes is more stable than that of natural enzymes and the catalytic activity of mimetic enzymes is easier to sustain. No work on the application of a mimetic enzyme in the determination of AA has been published. Hemin contains the same active center as horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The present work is also based on a hydrogen peroxide-oxidized reaction. But unlike those peroxidase-catalyzed determinations or those derivative reaction-coupled fluorimetric methods, the proposed method is based on the enhancement of fluorescence intensity resulting from the addition of AA. In an earlier paper on hydrogen peroxide determination using β-CD-hemin as catalyst [13] a rather high concentration of AA was found to result in a decrease in the fluorescence of the product, which was considered to have come from the interaction of AA and H 2 O 2 . But in recent work it has been discovered that, at much lower concentrations, AA could strongly enhanced both the fluorescence intensity and the reaction rate. Attracted by the interesting phenomenon we have further studied this reaction and found good linearity between the fluorescent change and the added amount of AA at low concentrations. Thus, a simple fluorimetric method for AA with quite high sensitivity was established. The mechanism of the reaction was further studied so as to explain the thoroughly contrary effects of AA at different concentration levels on the reaction mechanism. 2 Experimental 2.1 Reagents β-CD-hemin was synthesized according to methods reported previously [14] through the reaction of hemin with β-CD in dried dimethylformamide (DMF) using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide as a condensation reagent in the presence of pyridine and zeolite 4A at 0°C for 6 days, then at room temperature for 24 h. After reduced pressure evaporation, the product was recrystalized from a ethanol–acetone–water. A stock solution was prepared by dissolving 4.38 mg of β-CD-hemin in 25 ml of deionized water, which is 10 −4 mol l −1 in β-CD-hemin, and was refrigerated. p -Cresol (purchased from Aldrich) was 99% pure; a stock solution was prepared by dissolving 10.56 μl of p -cresol in 100 ml of water, which was 10 −3 mol l −1 in p -cresol. H 2 O 2 stock solution was prepared by diluting 0.01 ml of 30% H 2 O 2 to 100 ml. It was stored in a brown bottle in a refrigerator. Ascorbic acid (analytical-reagent grade) was prepared as aqueous solutions just before use. Distilled deionized water was used throughout. All other chemicals were of analytical-reagent grade. 2.2 Apparatus The fluorimetric detection was carried out on a Model SFM-25 spectrofluorimeter (Kontron) and a RF-5301 PC spectrofluoremeter (Shimadzu). The temperature was controlled by using a TB-85 thermostat bath (Shimadzu), and the pH value was measured with a PHS-3C precision pH meter. 2.3 Procedures Prior to use the H 2 O 2 stock solution was standardized by titration with secondary standard KMnO 4 [15] . As for AA determination each color comparison tube was filled with 0.1 ml of H 2 O 2 , 0.3 ml of p -cresol, 4 ml of NH 3 –NH 4 Cl buffer solution, various amount of AA and 0.5 ml of β-CD-hemin solution, and then diluted with water to 10 ml. Different orders of reagent addition were tested. A blank was used, which contained H 2 O in place of AA. After ca. 8 min, when the reaction had reached its equilibrium state, the solution was measured spectrofluorimetrically. At the selected excitation wavelength of 322 nm the emission spectrum had a maximum at 418 nm. These wave length were used for the quantitation of AA. Plots of the relative fluorescence intensity versus time were recorded. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Fluorescent spectral characteristics It was known that AA could act as an inhibitor in the peroxidase-catalyzed reaction, based on which AA was determined [10,16] . However, in this redox reaction between hydrogen peroxide and p -cresol, different amounts of AA had contrasting effects on the reaction catalyzed by β-CD-hemin. The 3D fluorescent spectra of the products were obtained and are shown in Fig. 1 . It is noted that both in the presence of a small amount of AA and a large amount of AA, the spectral shapes of the product were identical, and were consistent with that of the case in the absence of ascorbic acid. The only and remarkable difference between these three was the size of peaks. They were similar in profile but different in size. In addition, in the presence of AA, the fluorescent peak of the product red shifted slightly, which must have resulted from an increase of the polarity of the environment. The addition of AA, no matter how little or how much, did not result in any new fluorescent products. AA simply enhanced the fluorescence intensity of the product linearly at low concentrations, on which the new method for the determination of AA was based. The time dependence of the reactions in the presence of different amounts of AA was studied. We found that the fluorescence of the product showed three different trends as the AA concentration changed from very low to very ‘high’ values. Thus, it was considered that the reactions must have proceeded via different mechanisms with different AA concentrations. Some typical curves are shown in Fig. 2 . 3.2 Effect of the order of reagent addition We tested the effect of different orders of reagent addition on the fluorescence intensity of the reaction product with using 1.1×10 −5 mol l −1 H 2 O 2 and 3×10 −5 mol l −1 p -cresol at pH 10.4. The values of fluorescence intensity (FI) detected at 322/418 nm (Ex/Em) are listed in Table 1 . All data were the average of three repeated determinations. We can see that when AA alone reacted with H 2 O 2 , there was no fluorescence. In the case of low AA concentration when AA could enhance the relative FI, the highest FI appeared when AA was added later than the substrate and buffer. This is explained in that such a sequence resulted in the least oxidation of AA by H 2 O 2 , as well as the most cooperative effect of AA on the redox reaction. On the other hand, when quite a large amount of AA that could quench the fluorescence was introduced, the order of addition had little effect. In addition, we tried two more sequences where AA or p -cresol was added 10 min later than other reagents. As shown in Table 1 , if AA had reacted alone with H 2 O 2 for 10 min before p -cresol was added, the fluorescence intensity of the product was extremely low in both cases, which must have been due to the oxidation of AA by H 2 O 2 . Otherwise, if p -cresol has reacted with H 2 O 2 for 10 min before the addition of AA, the fluorescence was just the same as the blank in both cases, which showed that the product of the H 2 O 2 - p -cresol reaction did not react with AA. Thus, it was concluded that the enhancement did not rise from an interaction between AA and the fluorescent product. 3.3 Optimization of experimental conditions The pH dependence of the system was investigated over the pH range 8.5–11 using NH 3 –NH 4 Cl buffer. The data is shown in Fig. 3 . The difference between the relative FI between the sample and the blank (δFI) was quite large at pH 10.1–10.5. So pH 10.4 was selected for using in subsequent experiments. As we know, some nitrogenous compounds can enhance the activity of peroxidase due to the accessibility of the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen [17] . Having tried several kinds of buffer solutions with pH value 10.1–10.5 we found that NH 3 –NH 4 Cl solution was the best buffer for this system. Moreover, the enhancement could proceed only at quite high concentration of NH 3 , and had a maximal δFI at ca. 0.6 mol l −1 NH 3 . To keep the temperature constant is important for fluorimetric determination because, general speaking, the quantum efficiency of fluorescent substances changes with temperature. The effect of temperature change on the system was investigated in a range from room temperature up to 45°C. With the increasing temperature the time needed to reach equilibrium was shortened slightly. At each temperature the fluorescence of the product reached a maximum in no more than 8 min. To avoid decomposition of H 2 O 2 at high temperature we kept the reaction at 25°C with detection after 8 min. 3.4 Selection of the substrate concentration The amount of the substrate was investigated at given concentrations of H 2 O 2 and AA. The curve of δFI versus p -cresol concentration is shown in Fig. 4 and 3×10 −5 mol l −1 p -cresol was chosen for the determination of AA. In earlier work [13] the optimum ratio of H 2 O 2 to p -cresol was found to be ca. 1:20. However, in the present system it is not the case. For 5×10 −6 mol l −1 AA and the same concentration of β-CD-hemin as in that work, the best ratio of H 2 O 2 to p -cresol to obtain the best enhancement was found to be 1:3. More p -cresol would result in a lower fluorescence intensity. It is considered that there was some kind of competition between the substrate and AA with respect to β-CD-hemin. The excess p -cresol would prevent AA from being included by the hydrophobic cavities of β-CD and being combined with the active center of hemin, which held back the cooperative effect. 3.5 System performance A linear calibration graph was obtained over the AA concentration ( C ) range 1×10 −9 –8×10 −8 mol l −1 . The linear response can be fitted to an equation as follows: δFI =(0.4951±0.00657)× C 10 −9 +(7.963±0.2671) (r=0.9997, n=18) The detection limit, calculated according to the three S b / m criterion, (in which ‘ m ’ is the slope over the range of linearity used and ‘ S b ’ is the standard deviation ( n =9) of the signal from the blank), was found to be 3.45×10 −10 mol l −1 . The reproducibility of the system was tested by repeated measurements on 3×10 −8 mol l −1 ( n =9). The relative standard deviation was 1.2%. 3.6 Interfering species Several inorganic cations and organic acids, and some common amino acids and vitamins were investigated for their interference with this β-CD-hemin-catalyzed spectrofluorimetric method for AA. The concentration of AA used was 3×10 −8 mol l −1 . The species in question were dissolved in the sample-containing solution, and the signal was compared with that of the sample without an interfering species. If the relative FI changed by >5%, the substance added was considered to have caused an interference. The results demonstrated that K + , Na + , and Mg 2+ as well as glycine, alanine, barbituric acid, oxalic acid, uric acid, tartaric acid and citric acid did not interfere even the concentration was >300 times molar excess with respect to AA. The determination was free of interference from vitamin K 4 and Cu 2+ when their concentrations were no more than 100 times in excess with respect to AA. The method could tolerate D -glucose and vitamin B 12 with concentrations 50 times AA. When the concentration of vitamin B 6 and L -cysteine was less than 10 times of that of AA the determination was not interfered with. But vitamin B 1 and lactic acid interfered at concentration just 5 times higher than that of AA. Fe(III) could strongly quench the fluorescence. The addition of F − could successfully eliminate the interference of Fe(III). 3.7 Discussion of the mechanism In the derivative reaction-coupled fluorimetric methods for AA, as is known, AA was first oxidized by H 2 O 2 to DHAA and then DHAA reacted with OPDA to yield a quinoxaline derivative, which contained a hexacyclic ring formed between DHAA and OPDA. However, as for the monohydroxyl substrate p -cresol, it is unlikely to form such a stable ring structure between DHAA and p -cresol. From the fluorescent fingerprints we can see that the product of AA-linked reactions is just the same as that produced in the reaction without AA ( Fig. 1 ), which is 2,2′-dihydroxy-4,4′-dimethylbiphenyl [18] . The experimental results of reagent addition ( Table 1 ) have shown that the addition of AA to the product did not enhance the FI. What is more, the highest degree of enhancement required the simultaneous presence of p -cresol and AA. Hence it is deduced that the enhancement effect has risen from synergetic actions of AA and p -cresol. We tried HRP with the same system and found that such a cooperative enhancement also proceeded in the HRP-catalyzed reaction. At rather high AA concentrations (>3.5×10 −4 mol l −1 ), the progress curves exhibited a lag phase and the FI of the equilibrium state decreased, which showed the inhibition of AA on the catalytic reaction. Such inhibition could be explained in that AA competed with p -cresol in combination with the mimetic enzyme. The excess AA took up the combining site of β-CD-hemin so as to result in the decrease of reaction rates and FI. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 4 , improperly high concentration of p -cresol could also result in the decrease in FI, which also supported the existence of such a competition as well as of the synergic action. But a strange phenomenon appeared when the concentration of AA was in ‘the median’ levels, i.e. ca. 5×10 −5 –3×10 −4 mol l −1 . The relative FI at 322/418 nm increased to a maximum and decayed again ( Fig. 2 ). The details of the reaction mechanism are under further study.

In the first leaching stage with sulfuric acid media, 92% of zinc and 94% of copper were leached resulting in significant gallium and germanium enrichment up to ca. 300%. In the second leaching stage with oxalic acid media, the effects of H 2 C 2 O 4  concentration, leaching time, liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratio and temperature on the recovery of gallium and germanium were investigated. More than 96% of gallium and 99% of germanium were leached out using 70 g/L H 2 C 2 O 4  with a L/S ratio of 10 at 90 °C for 2 h. The removal of iron in the H 2 C 2 O 4  leach solution was carried out using an ultrasound-assisted ferrous iron precipitation method in which u003e 96% of Fe(III) was removed in the form of FeC 2 O 4 ·2H 2 O with minor losses of Ga(III) and Ge(IV) (1.4% and 1.3%). The results indicated that high recoveries of gallium and germanium from the zinc refinery residues could be achieved with two-stage leaching method.",

Therefore, it is of crucial importance to investigate the cashmere development mechanism of cashmere goat and to search for the important cashmere growth-related candidate genes. Fetal skin samples at 10 different periods of cashmere goat were collected in this research. Moreover, high-throughput sequencing was conducted on RNA samples from side skin of cashmere goat fetuses collected at three critical periods of skin hair follicle initiation, growth and development (namely, 45, 55 and 65 days) after balanced mix in line with the previous research results. Meanwhile, 3 samples at corresponding periods were used as the biological duplications. Data regarding microRNA and mRNA expression in skin and hair follicles of cashmere goats at various fetal periods were obtained using the high-throughput sequencing method. The results indicated that microRNAs in the oar-let-7 and oar-miR-200 families in 55 days and 66 days of pregnancy samples had been notably up-regulated relative to those in 45 days of pregnancy samples. This revealed that they might be the critical microRNAs in hair follicle development.",

A linear calibration graph was obtained over the AA concentration range 1 × 10-9 mol/L ∼ 8 × 10-8 mol/L with a detection limit of 3.45 × 10-10 mol/L of AA.

        "abstract": "Globally sclerotic glomeruli (GSG) occur with both normal aging and kidney disease. However, it is unknown whether any GSG or only GSG exceeding that expected for age is clinically important. To evaluate this, we identified patients with a glomerulopathy that often presents with nephrotic syndrome (focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, or minimal change disease) in the setting of the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), China-Digital Kidney Pathology (DiKiP), and the Southeast Minnesota cohorts. Age-based thresholds (95th percentile) for GSG based on normotensive living kidney donors were used to classify each patient into one of three groups; no GSG, GSG normal for age, or GSG abnormal for age. The risk of end-stage renal disease or a 40% decline in glomerular filtration rate during follow-up was then compared between groups. Among the 425 patients studied, 170 had no GSG, 107 had GSG normal for age, and 148 had GSG abnormal for age. Compared to those with no GSG, the risk of kidney disease progression with GSG normal for age was similar but was significantly higher with GSG abnormal for age. This increased risk with GSG abnormal for age remained significant after adjustment for interstitial fibrosis, arteriosclerosis, age, hypertension, diabetes, body mass index, glomerulopathy type, glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria. Thus, in patients with glomerulopathy that often presents with nephrotic syndrome, global glomerulosclerosis is clinically important only if it exceeds that expected for age.",

Methodology:One hundred and twenty two patients of LN (WHO typeⅡ24, type Ⅲ 9, type Ⅳ 65, and type Ⅴ 24 cases)with complete remission by induced therapy were recruited from Jun. 2004 to Aug. 2005. They were 116 female and 6 male with a average age of (29.6±8.3)years old, and randomized into the LEF group (n=61) or the TW group (n=61). Both of them were no difference in sex, age, WHO classification, and induction therapy. All patients were follow-up 24 months. The primary evaluation was performed on efficacy and side effects. Results:①There were 67 cases follow-up ≥6 months, 31 from the LEF group (follow-up 6 to 14 months), and 36 from the TW group (follow-up 6 to 16 months). 14 cases(23.0%) withdrew from the LEF group, mainly because of rash, diarrhea, leucopenia, and liver dysfunction, which was significantly higher than that of the TW group (4.9%). ②The relapses were observed in patients follow-up ≥6 months in both groups, with 3 cases (9.7%)belong to the LEF group (one was extra-renal relapsed on 5 months, and 2 were renal relapsed on 7, 14 months separately), and 5 (13.9%) in the TW group (one was extra-renal relapsed, and 4 were renal relapsed). ③The side effects were evaluated in all recruited patients. The total side effect rate in the LEF group was 34.4%. However, the rate of the TW group was just 26.2%. Conclusion:LEF had the same efficacy as TW in the LN maintenance therapy in those follow-up ≥6 months patients, and it had weak effect on menses. The rate of rash increased significantly in the LEF group, as well as higher withdrawal numbers. The effect of LEF on LN maintenance therapy may require long-term follow-up study.",

Methodology: Thirty one patients( 19 females and 12 males,average age of 24. 4 ± 10. 9 y) with severe LN including class Ⅳ( n = 19) 、Ⅲ( n = 1) 、Ⅴ + Ⅳ( n = 8) 、Ⅴ +Ⅲ( n = 2) and Ⅴ( n = 1) were enrolled in this study. Among them,22 cases showed rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis( RPGN) with elevated serum creatinine( SCr)( 300. 6 ± 185. 6 mmol / L),and 11 of them needed renal replacement therapy. DFPP was performed with two-fold plasma volume on each session using membrane type plasma component separator( EC50W and EC20W,Asahi Kasei Kuraray,Japan). Results:( 1) Clinical efficacy: After DFPP treating 2. 6 times( 1 ~ 3) for each patient,their SLE-DAI was reduced significantly from( 16. 0 ± 3. 5) to( 9. 7 ± 1. 5)( P < 0. 01) and SCr was decreased from( 300. 6 ± 185. 6) mmol / L to( 247.5 ±168.0) mmol/L( P <0.05). Six patients got off dialysis respectively. Gross hematuria disappeared in 4 patients and there was no change in proteinuria.( 2) Immunologic parameters: After DFPP,the levels of serum IgG were decreased from( 10.9 ±5.2) g/L to( 4.6 ±2.0) g/L( P <0.01),and the titers of anti-dsDNA antibody were significantly declined,while the levels of complements and lymphcytes had no change.( 3) Follow up: 31 patients were followed up for 1 ~ 29 months( 10. 1 ± 6. 4). 6 patients achieved complete remission,18 had partial remission and 6 developed to ESRD with maintenance hemodialysis.( 4) Adverse effect: one had catheter infection and one had hypotension episodes during DFPP treatment. Conclusion: DFPP could decrease activity of SLE and improve renal function through rapidly and effectively clearance of antibodies in severe LN. So DFPP accompanied with corticosteroid is an effective therapeutic method for severe LN. However,the right indication,suitable course and dosage of DFPP will need to deeply investigate.",

Both the probe and the fluorophore were investigated under one- and two-photon excitation modes. The fluorescence intensity of the probe was enhanced by ∼229-fold and ∼193-fold under one-photon and two-photon excitation, respectively, after reacting with HOCl. A maximal two-photon action cross-section of 50 GM was obtained under excitation at 810 nm. The probe exhibited high sensitivity with a detection limit of 42.3 nM, as well as high selectivity, low cytotoxicity, and good photostability. Two-photon microscopy (TPM) was conducted to visualize HOCl levels in living cells and tissues. The production of endogenous HOCl induced by lipopolysaccharide-mediated inflammation was successfully monitored with this probe.",

Methodology:Kidney samples were obtained from db/db mice and their db/m littermates at the age of 4,8,12,16 and 20 weeks.The expression of CXCL16 was assessed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry,and then correlated with biochemical and histological indices of kidney injury. Results:No significant difference of CXCL16 expression was found in the kidney of db/db mice as compared with the control db/m mice at the age of 4 weeks,a time when all biochemical and histological indices indicated that the db/db mice were in pre-diabetic condition.However,with the development of obesity,hyperglycemia and proteinuria,the expression of CXCL16 in the kidney of db/db mice increased.CXCL16 protein was distributed mainly in the renal distal tubule and in the glomerular podocytes to a less extent.Besides,different distribution of CXCL16 was also found between young mice(4-week-old db/m and db/db mice) and adult mice(db/m mice of 8-week-old and older than 8 weeks),which may suggest that CXCL16 might have some thing to do with the growth and development of kidney. Conclusion:Renal CXCL16 expression increased with the development of DN suggests that CXCL16 might involve in the initiation and development of DN in db/db mice.",

        "abstract": "The anticoagulation effect of heparin requires adequate serum antithrombin (AT)-III levels. Rivaroxaban, however, exhibits its anticoagulation effects independent of AT-III. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban as a treatment for venous thromboembolism in patients with AT-III deficiency due to nephrotic syndrome. Patients with nephrotic syndrome and low serum concentration and functional activity of AT-III and venous thromboembolism were randomly assigned to the rivaroxaban group (n=8) and low weight molecular heparin group (n=8). The patients were treated for 4 weeks and evaluated at weeks 2 and 4. The primary endpoint was thrombus dissolution or a >90% decrease in thrombus volume in 4 weeks. Secondary endpoints included an increase in the volume of the pre-existing thrombosis and safety assessments. In each of the two groups, 7/8 patients achieved a primary endpoint. At week 2, 5 patients in the rivaroxaban group and 4 in the low weight molecular heparin group had achieved the primary endpoint. Notably, at week 2 the patients whose AT-III levels and functional activity remained low in the low weight molecular heparin group did not achieve the primary endpoint. The adverse effects were similar in both groups, with no severe hemorrhage observed. In conclusion, the results of this pilot study demonstrate that rivaroxaban may be an effective, safe, single-agent approach for treating vein thromboembolism in patients with nephrotic syndrome and low AT-III levels. The potential benefits of rivaroxaban over low weight molecular heparin treatment require further investigation with a larger sample size in order to validate the findings of the present study.",

        "abstract": "Pathologic studies play an important role in evaluating patients with Alport syndrome besides genotyping. Difficulties still exist in diagnosing Alport syndrome (AS), and misdiagnosis is a not-so-rare event, even in adult patient evaluated with renal biopsy.We used nested case-control study to investigate 52 patients previously misdiagnosed and 52 patients initially diagnosed in the China Alport Syndrome Treatments and Outcomes Registry e-system.We found mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN, 26.9%) and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS, 19.2%) were the most common misdiagnosis. FSGS was the most frequent misdiagnosis in female X-linked AS (fXLAS) patients (34.8%), and MsPGN in male X-linked AS (mXLAS) patients (41.2%). Previous misdiagnosed mXLAS patients (13/17, 76.5%) and autosomal recessive AS (ARAS) patients (8/12, 66.7%) were corrected after a second renal biopsy. While misdiagnosed fXLAS patients (18/23, 78.3%) were corrected after a family member diagnosed (34.8%) or after rechecking electronic microscopy and/or collagen-IV alpha-chains immunofluresence study (COL-IF) (43.5%) during follow-up. With COL-IF as an additional criterion for AS diagnosis, we found that patients with less than 3 criteria reached have increased risk of misdiagnosis (3.29-fold for all misdiagnosed AS patients and 3.90-fold for fXLAS patients).We emphasize timely and careful study of electronic microscopy and COL-IF in pathologic evaluation of AS patients. With renal and/or skin COL-IF as additional criterion, 3 diagnosis criteria reached are the cutoff for diagnosing AS pathologically.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies addressing the question of whether continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) could improve the insulin resistance and glucose control in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have led to conflicting results. Therefore, we conducted the meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of CPAP on glycemic control and insulin resistance in OSA patients.We searched PubMed, HighWire Press, Ovid Medline (R), Cochrane library, and EMBASE before December 2011 on original English language studies. The meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager Version 5.The summary estimate for mean difference of homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA) from 12 non-diabetic studies was -0.55 (95 % CI, -0.91 to -0.20; P = 0.002). When compared with fasting blood glucose at baseline, 3 to 24 weeks of CPAP treatment did not improve glycemic control in non-diabetic subjects (-0.12; 95 % CI, -0.3 to 0.06; P = 0.20), as well as in diabetic subjects (-0.71; 95 % CI, -2.24 to 0.83; P = 0.37). There were no intervention-related changes in body mass index.Our analysis showed that CPAP significantly improved insulin resistance in non-diabetic patients with moderate to severe OSA, while no significant change in body mass index was detected. Compared with fasting blood glucose at baseline, there was no change in glycemic control with CPAP. Further large-scale, randomized, and controlled studies are needed to evaluate the longer treatment and its possible effects on weight loss and glycemic homeostasis.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To evaluate the clinical effects of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and cyclophosphamide(CTX) treatment for patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis (AAV). Methodology:Thirty-five patients who had active AAV[15 male, 20 female: age(49.1±12.2)y], of whom 28 patients were MPO-ANCApositive and two were PR3-ANCA positive, were enrolled in this study. All patients had renal involvement with serum creatinine less than 500 μmol/L prior to the study and were received either MMF treatment (MMF group, n=18), or intermittent CTX pulse therapy (CTX group, n=17). The patients in both groups also received methylprednisolone (MP) pulse therapy followed by oral predenisone. The disease activity was monitored using the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS). The chronic damage was measured by vasculitis damage index (VDI). The remission rate, drug-related adverse reactions and relapse were compared in the two groups. Results:The patients in the MMF group were treated with MMF for 6-24months and had a follow-up time ranged from 12 to 60 months (average 29.7±16.8) except 2 patients lost follow up after 6 months' treatment. The patients in the CTX group were followed up 12 to 63 months(average 28.5±14.6)except four patients dropped out. 17 of the 18 patients (94.4%) in the MMF group and 10 of the 13 patients (76.9%) in the CTX group had remission. At 3 months, 50% patients in MMF group, and 15.4% patients in CTX group had remission (P<0.05), while the remission rate were 77.8% and 61.5%, 100% and 81.8% at 6 months and 12 months respectively ( P>0.05). Two patients developed end stage renal failure in both groups during follow-up. At the last visit, 44.4% of MMF group and 15.4% of CTX group had their renal function recovered. The VDI scores after 12 months follow-up were significantly lower in the MMF group than that in the CTX group(P<0.05). Furthermore, 5 of the 12 ANCA positive patients (41.7%) in the MMF group and 1 of the 5 patients (20%) in the CTX group were ANCA negative after 12 months treatment. The decrement of ANCA titer was found in 50% of patients in the MMF group and 40% in the CTX group. Two patients in the MMF group (11.8%) and 3 patients (30%)in the CTX group relapsed. One patient died in each group. The side effects included pneumonia (one), herpes zoster (one) and gastro-intestinal symptoms (2 patients) in the MMF group, and leukocytopenia (one), severe gastro-intestinal symptoms(4 patients) in the CTX group. Conclusion:MMF was more effective than intermittent CTX pulse therapy in inducing remission, improving renal function and reducing serum ANCA level in patients with ANCA associated vasculitis.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Podocyte injury is the characteristic feature of minimal change disease(MCD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis(FSGS).Interleukin-13(IL-13) has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of MCD.The aim of this study is to investgate wether or not that IL-13 takes part in a direct impairment way on podocyte. Methodology:The expression of IL-13 receptor was studied by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.After being treated with 10 ng/m,50 ng/ml or 100 ng/ml IL-13 for different times(8h,12h,24h),the changes of F-actin and ZO-1 patterns on podocytes were observed by confocal microscopy.In order to understand the underlying roles of IL-13 effect on tubular epithelial cells,the activity of JAK-STAT 6 signal pathway was analyzed by measuring the extent of phosphory-lation of JAK-STAT 6 using western blot. Results:The expression of IL-13 receptor α1 mRNA and protein were detected in podocytes.IL-13 induced reorganization of F-actin fibers and redistribution of ZO-1 in a dose and time-dependent manner.50 ng/ml IL-13 treated for 24hrs could induce podocyte injury distinctly.The pattern of cytoskeleton changed into reorganization of F-actin to the cell periphery at the expense of transcytoplasmic microfilaments.ZO-1 staining appeared markedly fragmented and its density decreased.Western blot demonstrated phosphorylation of STAT 6 in podocytes upon incubation with IL-13.STAT6 signaling pathway inhibitor leflunomide could block the effect of IL-13 on F-actin and ZO-1 in podocytes. Conclusion:Podocyte expressed IL-13 receptor.IL-13 damaged the cytoskeleton structure and tight junction protein.The activation of the STAT 6 signal pathway might play an important role in the podocyte injury induced by IL-13.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential for podocyte homeostasis, and the miR-30 family may be responsible for this action. However, the exact roles and clinical relevance of miR-30s remain unknown. In this study, we examined the expression of the miR-30 family in the podocytes of patients with FSGS and found that all members are downregulated. Treating cultured human podocytes with TGF-β, LPS, or puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) also downregulated the miR-30 family. Podocyte cytoskeletal damage and apoptosis caused by treatment with TGF-β or PAN were ameliorated by exogenous miR-30 expression and aggravated by miR-30 knockdown. Moreover, we found that miR-30s exert their protective roles by direct inhibition of Notch1 and p53, which mediate podocyte injury. In rats, treatment with PAN substantially downregulated podocyte miR-30s and induced proteinuria and podocyte injury; however, transfer of exogenous miR-30a to podocytes of PAN-treated rats ameliorated proteinuria and podocyte injury and reduced Notch1 activation. Finally, we demonstrated that glucocorticoid treatment maintains miR-30 expression in cultured podocytes treated with TGF-β, LPS, or PAN and in the podocytes of PAN-treated rats. Glucocorticoid-sustained miR-30 expression associated with reduced Notch1 activation and alleviated podocyte damage. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that miR-30s protect podocytes by targeting Notch1 and p53 and that the loss of miR-30s facilitates podocyte injury. In addition, sustained miR-30 expression may be a novel mechanism underlying the therapeutic effectiveness of glucocorticoids in treating podocytopathy.",

Methodology:This study included 30 renal biopsy-proven ORG patients and 19 controls (obese people with normal urinalysis). Anthropometric parameters, serum insulin levels and lipids were determined,and all subjects were evaluated with abdominal ultrasonagraphy (US) and computed tomography (CT). The ORG patients were subdivided into 3 groups according to the body fat patterns evaluated in CT scan. Central fat distribution pattern was defined as visceral fat area in CT scan ≥120 cm~2. Results:We found that all the ORG patients showed central fat distribution pattern as compared with 78.9% in obese subjects in the control group (P<0.05). The relative risk of ORG was 8.0 times greater in subjects with central pattern of obesity than in subjects with peripheral pattern of obesity. Meanwhile, patients with ORG had higher levels of fasting glucose (P<0.05), insulin (P<0.05) and insulin resistance (P<0.01) than the control. And the levels of total cholesterol in patients with ORG were higher that controls (P<0.05), while the levels of triglyceride, high density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein had no difference between two groups. Furthermore, ORG patients showed increased levels of proteinuria (0.89±0.41),(1.47±0.69) & (2.24±1.22)g/24h, more percentage of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (40%, 50% & 100%) with an increase in visceral fat area(P<0.05, ANOVA). Meanwhile, glomerular filtration rate and insulin resistance increased(P<0.05, ANOVA), whereas lipid dysmetabolism did not, as the visceral fat area increased. Serum level of C reactive protein showed an upward increasing trend with the increment of visceral fat area, but without statistic significance. Conclusion:Central pattern of fat distribution is a risk factor for obese patients to develop renal impairment, and may contributes to further progression of ORG.",

Methodology:Twenty-four db/db and db/m mouse with 8 weeks of age were divided into five groups according to their treatment ways: group A db/m was treated with saline; group B db/db with saline; group C db/db with rhein [150 mg/(kg·d)],and group D db/db was treated with simvastatin [20 mg/(kg·d)]. The body weight,plasma glucose,lipids level,24h urinary albumin excretion were measured every 4 weeks. The morphometry and immunohistology of transforming growth factor-β_1(TGF-β_1) and fibronectin (FN) were performed in all groups at the end of the study. Results:The plasma levels of cholesterol,triglyceride,low density lipoprotein and ApoE were all decreased in groups C and D than that in group B after treatment of 8 weeks. Urinary albumin excretion were reduced after treatment of 8 weeks in groups C and 12 weeks in groups D compared with group B (P<0.05). The morphometric analysis revealed that the glomerular tuft area (GTA) and extracellular matrix area (ECMA) were significantly decreased in groups C but not in group D compared with that in diabetic control group at age of 20 weeks. In immunohistochemistry,TGF-β_1 and FN expression of renal tissue was markedly decreased in groups C compared with that in group B at 20 weeks (P<0.05),but they were not significantly decreased in group D (P>0.05). Conclusion:Our data suggested that rhein has a similar effect to simvastatin on regulating dyslipidemia in diabetic db/db mouse. However,rhein also presents a more effective renal protection than simvastatin in diabetic nephropathy.",

        "abstract": "Previous data showed that the predominance of intraglomerular T-bet or GATA3 is correlated with different mechanisms of rejection, suggesting that the ratio of T-bet/GATA3 might be used to distinguish antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) and T-cell-mediated rejection (TCMR).We compared the intraglomerular T-bet/GATA3 ratio in ABMR and TCMR. The intragraft expression of T-bet and GATA3 was studied via immunohistochemistry. The correlation of the diagnosis of AMR with the ratio of T-bet/GATA3 was examined.Both intraglomerular T-bet- and GATA3-expressing cells were increased during acute rejection. T-bet/GATA3>1 was strongly correlated with ABMR (93.3% versus 18.2%). The incidence of positive HLA-I/II antibodies and glomerulitis is significantly higher in T-bet/GATA3>1 group (P < 0.001, 0.013, resp.). The scores of peritubular capillary inflammation and glomerulitis were also higher in T-bet/GATA3>1 group (P = 0.052, P < 0.001, resp.). Nevertheless, T-bet/GATA3>1 is also correlated with C4d-negative ABMR and resistance to steroid treatment. Compared with C4d deposition, T-bet/GATA3>1 had a slight lower (90% versus 100%) specificity but a much higher (87.5% versus 68.8%) sensitivity.Our data suggested that intraglomerular predominance of T-bet over GATA3 might be used as diagnosis maker of ABMR in addition to C4d, especially in C4d-negative cases.",

Owing to its great potential in chemical conversion, the value-added utilization of this non-grain biomass has received much attention in recent years. Based on the established transformation route from shikimic acid (1) to methyl 3-dehydroshikimate (3-MDHS, 2) and to the multi-functionalized methyl 2-amino-3-cyanobenzofuran-5-carboxylate (3), we disclose a facile and transition metal-free method to access a series of N-substituted benzofuro[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amines in 63%-90% yields. The identification of these compounds as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors has also been described. Among them, compound 5h exhibited the most potent inhibitory effect against EGFR tyrosine kinase with an IC of 1.7 nM and excellent antiproliferative activity against A431 and A549 cell lines with a GI of 5.1 and 12.3 μM, respectively.",

Stopped-flow spectrophotometry was used to study the kinetic behavior of the oxidation reaction. The catalytic activity of Mb was compared to other three kinds of catalyst. The time dependent absorbance of the reaction product, 2,3-diamimophenazine (DAPN), at a wavelength of 426 nm was recorded. The initial reaction rate obtained at 40 degrees C was found to be proportional to the concentration of Mb in the range of 1.0 x 10(-6) to 4.0 x 10(-9)mol L(-1). The detection limit of Mb was found to be 9.93 x 10(-10)mol L(-1). The relative standard deviations were within 5% for the determination of different concentrations of Mb. Excess of bovine serum albumin (BSA), Ca(II), Mg(II), Cu(II), glucose, caffeine, lactose and uric acid did not interfere.",

Methodology:Three hundred and fifty five cases with type 2 diabetic nephropathy were enrolled in this study. The general information,blood biochemistry and urine test as well as kidney pathological data of patients were collected. The patients with NAFLD were identified by type B ultrasonic sound test. The clinical and histological features of kidney injury were also analyzed. Results:Sixty two cases of 355 (17.5%) subjects were diagnosed as NAFLD. Compared with patients without NAFLD,NAFLD patients were significantly younger[(49.1±9.04) vs (53.9±9.61 )years old,P<0.01] and a shorter course of diabetes mellitus [(61.0±57.7) vs (277±72.4 )months,P<0.01]. In patients with NAFLD,their body mess index (BMI) was obviously higher[(28.8±3.24) vs (24.9±3.48) kg/m2,P<0.01],insulin resistance index was much more severer(7.15±4.28) vs (5.17±4.39),P<0.05),triglyceride level was also significantly elevated[(3.52±4.03)vs (2.11±1.46 )mmol/l,P<0.01],while high density lipoprotein (HDL) level was significantly lower(P<0.01)than that in patients without NAFLD. There was no statistic difference in total cholesterol level between two groups. The level of serum creatinine (SCr) was significantly lower[(1.07±1.04) vs (2.17±2.05)mg/dl,P<0.01],total urine protein and low molecular urine protein were also significantly lower in NAFLD group[(2.21±3.44) vs (3.63±2.80)g,P<0.01 and (7.67±13.39) vs (11.54±11.72)%,P<0.05,respectively]. The rate of glomerular sclerosis,mesengial proliferation,K-W nodular and tubular-interstitial lesion were much more predominant in non-NAFLD patients. Conclusion:The patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy and NAFLD were comparably younger with shorter course of diabetes mellitus. The metabolic disturbance was much more significant in these patients characterized as overweight,insulin resistance,hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL,which may implicated that metabolic control is very important in the treatment of type 2 diabetic nephropathy patients with NAFLD.",

NADH is an important fluorescent substance in living cells. The time courses of intracellular NADH autofluorescence in the process of yeast cells exposed to H(2)O(2) and ONOO(-) have been recorded in detail in this work. In the presence of different amounts of H(2)O(2) and ONOO(-), necrosis, apoptosis and reversible injury are initiated in yeast cells, which are confirmed by acridine orange/ethidum bromide and Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. It is found that intracellular NADH content increases momently in the beginning of the apoptotic process and then decreases continually till the cell dies. The most remarkable difference between the apoptotic and the necrotic process is that the NADH content in the latter case changes much more sharply. Further in the case of reversible injury, the time course of intracellular NADH content is completely different from the above two pathways of cell death. It just decreases to some degree firstly and then resumes to the original level. Based on the role of NADH in mitochondrial respiratory chain, the time course of intracellular NADH content is believed to have reflected the response of mitochondrial redox state to oxidative stress. Thus, it is found that the mitochondrial redox state changes differently in different pathways of oxidative injury in yeast cells.",

        "abstract": "The Yesso scallop Patinopecten yessoensis displays polymorphism in shell colors, which is of great interest for the scallop industry. To identify genes involved in the shell coloration, in the present study, we investigate the transcriptome differences by Illumina digital gene expression (DGE) analysis in two extreme color phenotypes, Red and White. Illumina sequencing yields a total of 62,715,364 clean sequence reads, and more than 85% reads are mapped into our previously sequenced transcriptome. There are 25 significantly differentially expressed genes between Red and White scallops. EPR (Electron paramagnetic resonance) analysis has identified EPR spectra of pheomelanin and eumelanin in the red shells, but not in the white shells. Compared to the Red scallops, the White scallops have relatively higher mRNA expression in tyrosinase genes, but lower expression in other melanogensis-associated genes. Meantime, the relatively lower tyrosinase protein and decreased tyrosinase activity in White scallops are suggested to be associated with the lack of melanin in the white shells. Our findings highlight the functional roles of melanogensis-associated genes in the melanization process of scallop shells, and shed new lights on the transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms in the regulation of tyrosinase activity during the process of melanin synthesis. The present results will assist our molecular understanding of melanin synthesis underlying shell color polymorphism in scallops, as well as other bivalves, and also help the color-based breeding in shellfish aquaculture.

Methodology:From Jun 2010 to Aug 2011,nine patients were diagnosed as PGNMID.Their clinical and pathological features were retrospectively analyzed.The diagnosed criteria of PGNMID was proliferative or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis on LM,monoclonal IgG and staining for a single light-chain isotype on IF,and glomerular electron-dense deposits on EM. Results:Patients were 5 males and 4 females with an average age of (49.8±10.9) years old.The duration of renal disease was (15.9±13.1) months(1～36 months).All of them had proteinuria with an average (5.60±2.80) g/d of urine protein excretion,7 had microscopic hematuria and 8 had hypoalbuminia with an average serum albumin of (29.0±5.5) g/L.The level of urine NAG was (72.3±38.6) U/(g·cr) and retional binding protein (RBP) was (11.3±17.1) mg/L.Seven patients had elevated serum creatine,8 hypertension,and 8 had anemia (from 76~102 g/L) who had no myeloma by bone marrow biopsy.Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) showed that only one patient had monoclonal (M) spikes (IgGκ) in serum from 7 patients.Five patients had decreased serum complement C3,while C4 normal.In histological examinations,alll patients showed proliferative glomerulonephritis,3 of them had nodular lesions and one presented cellular and fibro-cellular crescents (33.3%).On EM,the granular dense deposits were identified predominately in subendothelial,mesangial and occasional in subepithelial region.Two had massive crystal lattice in subendothelial,mesangial and ocasional subepithelia regions.By IF,all patients had IgG and C3 glomerular diposits,and 5 had C1q deposits.Subtype IgG and light chain staining showed IgG3κ in 3,IgG3λ in 3,IgG1κ in 2,and IgG1λ in one. Conclusion:The clinical features of patients with PGNMID were massive proteinuria,heamaturia,renal dysfunction as well as anemia.There was predominance of IgG3 glomerular deposits associated with granular dense and occasional crystal lattice deposits.",

A polysilicon emitter (PolyE) double mesa microwave power SiGe HBT showing excellent low current DC characteristics with β=60@VCE/IC=9.0 V/300 μA, β=100@5 V/50 mA, BVCBO=22 V, ft/fmax=5.4 GHz/7.7 GHz@3 V/10 mA is demonstrated. The PolyE SiGe HBT needs only 6 lithographical steps and cancels the growth of the thick emitter epitaxy layer, both of which show great potential for production. A 60-finger class-A SiGe linear power amplifier (PA) with 22 dBm of 1 dB compress point output power (P1dB), 11 dB of power gain (Gp) and 26.1% of power added efficiency (PAE) @900 MHz, 3.5 V/0.2 A is demonstrated. Another 120-finger class-A SiGe PA with 33.3 dBm (2.1 W) of Pout, 10.3 dB of Gp and 33.9% of PAE @900 MHz, 11 V/0.52 A is also demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "The difference in underlying pathophysiology in different congenital heart disease (CHD) may have an influence on clinical outcome. It remains unclear whether the effect of sildenafil on pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) varies in different types of CHD.The potential effect of sildenafil on pulmonary arterial hypertension related to CHD may be associated with shunt location.In this 12-week, prospective, open label, multicenter trial, 55 patients with CHD were divided into the 3 groups: atrial septal defects group (ASD, n = 15), ventricular septal defects group (VSD, n = 24), and patent ductus arteriosus group (PDA, n = 16). Exercise capacity, hemodynamic parameters, and arterial oxygen saturation were assessed at baseline and after sildenafil therapy (25 mg, 3 times daily).Six-minute walk distance significantly increased from 377.2 ± 68.7 m to 436.0 ± 70.4 m in patients with ASD, from 371.2 ± 66.0 m to 413.7 ± 83.1 m in VSD, and from 384.3 ± 90.2 m to 440.9 ± 71.8 m in PDA (P<0.01, respectively). Moreover, sildenafil also improved the pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary blood flow index in the 3 groups, whereas no significant changes in systemic vascular resistance and systemic arterial pressure were observed. However, arterial oxygen saturation was significantly improved in the ASD group only. The incidence of adverse events was similar among the 3 groups.Sildenafil therapy seems to be effective and safe for PAH secondary to ASD, VSD, and PDA, although some clinical and hemodynamic parameters were changed in a different manner among the 3 groups.",

        "abstract": "Sildenafil has been shown to be effective in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, the impact of sildenafil on PAH has been under-investigated in China. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral sildenafil in PAH patients in China.In this prospective, open-label and multi-center study, 90 patients were recruited from 14 centers to receive oral sildenafil (75 mg/d) for 12 weeks. They underwent a six-minute walk test (SMWT) and cardiac catheterization at the beginning and the end of 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the changes in exercise capacity as assessed by SMWT. And the secondary endpoints included assessment of functional class, evaluation of cardiopulmonary hemodynamics and clinical deterioration (defined as death, transplantation and re-hospitalization for PAH). Drug safety and tolerability were also examined.There were 19 males and 71 females with an average age of 32.5 ± 12.1 years old (range: 18 - 61). Their etiologies were idiopathic (n = 15), related with congenital heart disease (n = 60), or related with connective tissue disease (n = 9) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (n = 6). Oral sildenafil significantly increased the SMWT distances [(342 ± 93) m vs. (403 ± 88) m, P < 0.001]. There was also remarkable improvement in Borg dyspnea score (2.9 ± 2.6 vs. 2.4 ± 2.0, P = 0.005). Furthermore, significant improvements in World Healthy Organization (WHO) functional class and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics were also found (mean pulmonary artery pressure, P < 0.001; cardiac index, P < 0.001; pulmonary vascular resistance, P < 0.001). Side effects were mild and consistent with other reports.This study confirms and extends previous studies. Oral sildenafil is both safe and effective for the treatment of adult PAH patients in China.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and minimal change disease (MCD) are common types of primary glomerular disease; they share numerous clinical and pathological similarities but have different treatment regimens and prognoses. It is therefore necessary to distinguish between them and to explore the mechanism underlying their differences. Fibrinogen is reportedly involved in podocyte damage and in renal fibrosis in vitro and in animal models of kidney disease. We thus tested urinary fibrinogen, serum fibrinogen, and renal fibrinogen deposition levels in a cohort comprising 50 patients with FSGS and 40 patients with MCD. Our results suggested that urinary fibrinogen and renal interstitial fibrinogen deposition levels were significantly higher in the FSGS patients than in the MCD patients, while serum fibrinogen levels did not differ between the groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed an excellent diagnostic ability for urinary fibrinogen and a fair diagnostic ability for tubulointerstitial fibrinogen deposition in differentiating FSGS from MCD. Additionally, we found that urinary fibrinogen levels were positively correlated with the 24-h urine protein levels in patients with FSGS but not in patients with MCD. In conclusion, urinary fibrinogen and renal interstitial fibrinogen deposition is elevated in primary FSGS compared to MCD, which may be relevant to both diagnosis and pathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sirolimus (SRL) has a very important effect on preventing and treating acute rejection in renal transplantation. Moreover, it is a potent inhibitor of smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, and may play a role in preventing chronic rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy. However, the precise mechanism remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of SRL on transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TFG-β1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in chronic allograft nephropathy. METHODS: A total of 60 renal allograft recipients were randomly divided into SRL group, treated by SRL+ cyclosporine A (CsA) +prednisone (Pred), and Azathioprine (Aza) group, treated by Aza +CsA+Pred. SRL was 6 mg and 2 mg per day in 2 weeks, and changed to 1.0-2.0 mg per day after 2 weeks; CsA was 5.0-7.0 mg per day; Aza was 50-100 mg per day, and Pred was 15-20 mg per day. After two years, the pathological changes of the allografts, serum creatinine of the recipients, distribution of TGF-β1 and VEGF, and hepatic function were observed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The patients were followed-up for 2 years. CsA dose was significantly lower in SRL group than Aza group at 1, 3, 12 months postoperatively, but there were no differences in blood plasma CsA C0 concentration between two groups. In Aza group, TFG-β1 was expressed mostly in proximal convoluted tubule, also in glomerulus and interstitial blood vessel. Majority of tissues expressed TFG-β1 in proximal convoluted tubule, and presented at brush border in line. Some tissues expressed TFG-β1 in glomerular splanchnoderm epithelial cells. Additionally, little TFG-β1 was observed in endothelial cells and intercapillary cells. In SRL group, there was significant decreasing staining in proximal convoluted tubule, but there were no differences in glomerulus and blood vessel. In Aza group, VEGF was expressed mostly in glomerular splanchnoderm epithelial cells, and some in endothelial cells and intercapillary cells. VEGF was positively expressed in interstitial vessel, especially in endothelial layer. There was significant decreasing staining in SRL group glomerulus and blood vessel. Compared with Aza group, patient/kidney survival was high, but VEGF and TFG-β1 expression was significantly decreased. Results from the study showed that SRL decreased VEGF and TFG-β1 expression in renal graft, delayed progression of chronic allograft nephropathy, and prolonged survival of allografts.",

        "abstract": "Monocyte and its secreted cytokines play a crucial role in the process of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). It has been known that continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) can partially attenuate the inflammatory process by removal of cytokines, but the effect of CVVH on monocyte secretion function remains unknown. This study investigated the effect of different doses of CVVH on monocyte secretion function as well as the plasma cytokine profile in a SAP porcine model.After successful induction of SAP by pressure-controlled (100 mmHg), intraductal injection of sodium taurocholate (4%, 1 ml/kg) and trypsin (2 U/kg), 24 swine were randomly assigned to 3 groups. Swine in group I (n=8) serving as SAP controls received only standard medical therapy (SMT). Besides SMT, swine in two other groups received zero-balanced CVVH, one hour after the induction of SAP, with low volume fluid exchange (group II, n=8, ultrafiltration rate (UFR) 20 ml/kg/h, LV-CVVH) or high volume (group III, n=8, UFR 100 ml/kg/h, HV-CVVH). Using heparin as anticoagulant, the filter (AN69, Hospal, Lyon, France) was changed every 24 hours. Monocytes were isolated from porcine blood at various timepoints for detection of cytokine secretion (interleukin-6, IL-6; interleukin-10, IL-10; tumor necrosis-a, TNF-a) after LPS stimulus; plasma cytokines were measured simultaneously.CVVH showed a dose-dependent beneficial effect on the animals' survival time. In control animals, plasma pro-inflammatory cytokine levels exhibited a double-phase fluctuation after SAP induction: IL-6 and TNF-alfa rapidly increased to a peak level within 6-12 hours, then dropped to very low level in the late stage. Unlike pro-inflammatory cytokines, the plasma level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 reached a plateau within 6-12 hours but dropped little. In CVVH-treated animals, the peak-nadir patterns of 3 cytokines were all flattened, most prominently in the HV-CVVH group. Similarly to plasma cytokine patterns, the monocyte ex vivo response to LPS stimulus showed an over-production of cytokines within 6-12 hours, but low production in the late stage. Although unable to totally prevent the abnormality of the monocyte secretion function, CVVH showed a dose-dependent ameliorative effect on it.Monocytes are over-reactive to stimulus in the early stage of SAP, accompanied by a high level of plasma cytokines, and hypo-reactive to stimulus in the late stage of SAP, accompanied with a low level of plasma cytokines. CVVH treatment has a dose-dependent improvement effect on monocyte responsiveness.",

Using the TP-NH 2 molecule as an energy donor, a two-photon excitation fluorescence resonance energy-transfer (TPE-FRET) based homogeneous immunoassay method was proposed. The donor and the acceptor (DABS-Cl, a dark quencher) were labeled to bovine serum albumin (BSA) separately, and anti-BSA protein was determined by employing an antibody bridging assay scheme. Rabbit anti-BSA serum containing other biomolecules was intentionally used as the sample to introduce interference. A parallel assay was performed using the traditional one-photon excitation FRET model, which failed to carry out quantitative determination due to the serious background luminescence arising from those biomolecules in the sample. The TPE-FRET model showed its strong ability to overcome the problem of autofluorescence and provided satisfying analytical performance. Quite good sensitivity and wide linear range (0.05-2.5 nM) for anti-BSA protein was obtained. The results of this work suggest that TPE-FRET could be a promising technique for homogeneous assays excluding separation steps, especially in complicated biological sample matrixes.",

        "abstract": "D-dimer can be used to exclude acute pulmonary embolism (PE) for its high negative predictive value (NPV). Also, it is a predictor of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) after anticoagulation withdrawal. The aim of the present study was to assess the predictive value of D-dimer for recurrent VTE when tested at hospital discharge. Plasma D-dimer levels were repeatedly measured at hospital discharge in 204 consecutive patients with the first episode of acute pulmonary embolism. Patients were categorized to two groups by D-dimer levels at hospital discharge and followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter. The primary end point was symptomatic, recurrent fatal or nonfatal VTE. D-dimer levels were persistently abnormal in 66 patients (32%). After 31±19 months follow-up, patients with persistently abnormal D-dimer level levels showed a higher rate of of recurrent VTE (14 patients, 21%) compared to those with D-dimer regression (8 patients, 6%) (P = 0.001). At the multivariate analysis, after adjustment for other relevant factors, persistently abnormal D-dimer level levels were an independent predictor of recurrent VTE in all subjects investigated, (hazard ratio, 4.10; 95% CI, 1.61–10.39; P = 0.003), especially in those with unprovoked PE (hazard ratio, 4.61; 95% CI, 1.85–11.49; P = 0.001). The negative predictive value of D-dimer was 94.2 and 92.9% in all subjects or those with unprovoked PE, respectively. Persistently abnormal D-dimer level levels at hospital discharge have a high negative predictive value for recurrence in patients with acute pulmonary embolism, especially in subjects with an unprovoked previous event.",

        "abstract": "In this paper,data from 2003 to 2011 production performance records of Inner Mongolia White Cashmere goats were used to analysis and discuss the relationship between cashmere yield and weight after fleecing(WT).Excel and SAS were used to organize data in the study.Cashmere yield decreased in 2004,2008,2009,2011 years,but WT increased.As the growth of the age,the cashmere yield gradually increased before the fourth years old,and declined but there were a few still increasing phenomenon of varying degrees after the fourth years old,WT showed an increasing trend. Ignoring year's environmental factors the cashmere yield and WT had a same trend as the growth of the age before the fourth years old,but with the increasing of cashmere yield,the increasing of WT presented decrescent trend. Otherwise,with the increasing of WT,the added of cashmere yield slowdown. While the cashmere yield increased whereas WT decreased,and cashmere yield decreased but the fleece weight increased in the same wool production season. This research showed that there were some competition between the cashmere yield and WT grew together at the same time at the post-growing period.",

The differences of pulmonary function in chronic left heart failure and chronic right heart failure are not fully understood.We evaluated 120 patients with stable CHF (60 with chronic left heart failure and 60 with chronic right heart failure). All patients had pulmonary function testing, including pulmonary function testing at rest and incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX).Patients with right heart failure had a significantly lower end-tidal partial pressure of CO2 (PetCO2), higher end-tidal partial pressure of O2 (PetO2) and minute ventilation/CO2 production (VE/VCO2) at rest. Patients with right heart failure had a lower peak PetCO2, and a higher peak dead space volume/tidal volume (VD/VT) ratio, peak PetO2, peak VE/VCO2, and VE/VCO2 slope during exercise. Patients with right heart failure had more changes in ∆PetCO2 and ∆VE/VCO2, from rest to exercise.Patients with right heart failure had worse pulmonary function at rest and exercise, which was due to severe ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatching, severe ventilation inefficiency, and gas exchange abnormality.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Neutronics design of commercial reactors currently utilizes a procedure linking lattice physics and core physics calculations together, where broad-group constants are generated by fine-group lattice calculations and are then used by downstream whole-core diffusion calculations. Among this procedure, the leakage effect in group-constant generation contributes a non-negligible source of errors. In pebble-bed high temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs), this effect becomes even important because the neutron diffusion length is relatively large compared with the size of pebble lattice. Traditional neutronics analysis codes for pebble-bed HTGRs need repeatedly re-call lattice calculations with the leakage information obtained from core diffusion calculations. In this paper, existing methods for leakage correction are reviewed, and a new method is proposed to correct broad-group constants by using buckled fine-group spectrum. The new method eliminates the need of online coupling between lattice physics and core physics calculations, and thus makes it possible to use the tabular group-constant library as is done in light water reactors (LWRs). Numerical tests show that the proposed method are promising for leakage correction in pebble-bed HTGR analyses.",

An automatic PAUT system of dual matrix array probe has been recently developed and qualified in ASIPP. In this paper, key parameters of the system and test results obtained on demonstration blocks are introduced. Test results imply high sensitivity and efficiency of the automatic PAUT system, which will be further testified on the NDT of CFETR VV welding.",

        "abstract": "This study, in optimally treated CAD patients with newly diagnosed OSA, focused on (1) The relationships between OSA and serum biomarkers of four potential pathways of cardiovascular injury in OSA: high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), endothelin-1 (ET-1), N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and fibrinogen; and (2) The effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on these markers. 151 Chinese patients with proven CAD and standard medication were enrolled. After polysomnography, patients were classified into four groups according to apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): no OSA (n = 25); mild OSA (n = 50); moderate OSA (n = 43); severe OSA (n = 33). Morning levels of hs-CRP, ET-1, NT-proBNP and fibrinogen were assayed and repeated in severe OSA patients after 3-months CPAP treatment. Hs-CRP was greater in patients with severe OSA than those with no OSA or mild OSA (P = 0.001, P = 0.003; respectively). After adjustment for confounders, the hs-CRP levels correlated most strongly with AHI and oxygen desturation index (ODI) (r = 0.439, P < 0.001; r = 0.445, P < 0.001; respectively). In stepwise multiple linear regressions, the strongest predictor of hs-CRP levels was ODI (P < 0.001). After 3 months of CPAP treatment, the hs-CRP levels deceased (P = 0.005) in CAD patients with severe OSA. In CAD patients on current optimal medications, hs-CRP is significantly correlated with the severity of OSA, and the elevated hs-CRP levels can be decreased by CPAP. This suggests that OSA could activate vascular inflammation in CAD patients despite current best practice medications.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To investigate the prevalence and the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) CKD stage 2～5. Methodology:One hundred and eighty-one patients with IgAN and 199 patients with DN,who were biopsy-proven and hospitalized or followed in our Nephrology Department, were surveyed by collecting history and laboratory data. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association of clinical data with CVD events. Results:The prevalence of CVD in patients with IgAN CKD stage 2～5 were 8.7%,7.7%,17.2% and 44.4% respectively.The prevalence of CVD in patients with DN CKD stage 2～5 were 29.6%,40.0%,45.2% and 72.7% respectively. The prevalence of CVD in the each CKD stage patients with DN were significantly increased when compared with the patients with IgAN (CKD stage 2 29.6% vs 8.7%,P<0.01,CKD stage 3 40.0% vs 7.7%,P<0.01,CKD stage 4 45.2% vs 17.2%,P<0.05,CKD stage 5 72.7% vs 44.4%,P<0.05). The total prevalence of CAD and LVH in the patients with DN were markedly elevated as compared with the patients with IgAN, and the difference in CAD between two diseases was the most significant (CAD 16.1% vs 0.6%,P<0.01,LVH 33.2% vs 14.7%,P<0.01).The prevalence of CVD in the patients of both diseases with CKD stage 5 was remarkably higher than that in the patients with CKD stage 2～4. In the patients with IgAN, the incidence of hypertension, the levels of SCr and serum phosphate in patients with CVD were significantly elevated and the level of Hb was decreased as compared with the patients without CVD. In the patients with DN, the incidence of smoking history, hypertension, the levels of SCr and TC in patients with CVD were significantly increased as compared with the patients without CVD. Logistic regression analysis showed that the independent risk factors of LVH for patients with both kidney diseases, and CAD for patients with DN were SCr and Hb (OR values were 1.22,P<0.05 and 0.67,P<0.01),SCr and BMI (OR values were 1.77,P<0.01;1.36,P<0.05), and smoking history,SCr and LDL respectively (OR values were 2.96,P<0.05;1.45,P<0.01;6.93,P<0.05). Conclusion:The prevalence of CVD in the each CKD stage patients with DN was higher than that in patients with IgAN and LVH is the commonest manifestation of CVD in the patients with both diseases. The prevalence of CAD and LVH in the patients with DN was higher than that in the patients with IgAN, which suggests the correlation with higher CVD mortality in the patients with DN. The prevalence of CVD in the patients of both diseases with CKD stage 5 was remarkably increasing, indicating the early intervention in CKD patients is necessary. Kidney specific risk factors play an important role in CVD patients with IgAN, and diabetic related and other metabolism risk factors may exert a larger influence over kidney specific factors in CVD patients with DN.",

        "abstract": "Key distribution is one of the most challenging security problems in wireless sensor networks, existing approaches to this problem are to assign more than one key to each node, such as the random key pre-distribution scheme (R-KPS) proposed by Eschenauer and Gligor. The random key pre-distribution scheme does not use any deployment and location information, but in many practical scenarios, certain deployment knowledge may be available and can improve the performance. In R-KPS every node should choose key chain from the same key pool because they are equally likely to be neighbors. However, if the network can be divided into several domains, nodes from specific domain are more likely to be neighbors of nodes from the same domain and those from nearby domains. In this paper, the authors propose a method to improve the random key pre-distribution scheme using a priori area deployment information. Comparison to random key pre-distribution scheme shows that the authors' approach can substantially improve a network's connectivity, reduce the amount of memory required and enhance the network resilience against node capture. Finally, a new node positioning algorithm is put forward which does not rely on any position finding equipments and only exploits the domain's location information. This algorithm is simple, being applicable to the situation where the positioning accuracy demand is not high.",

Methodology: One hundred and twenty-three patients who received peritoneal dialysis (PD) from June 2010 to December 2011 were enrolled into this prospective study,and the patients with acute kidney injury were excluded. The album,hemoglobin( Hb) blood pressure,body mass index( BMI) ,urine volume,ultrafiltration,fluid removal, residual glomerular filtration rate ( rGFR) ,Urea Kt/V,creatinine clearance ( Ccr) were examined regularly during the follow up. to explore dynamic changes of all indexes and risk factors of cardiothoracic ratio. To explore dynamic changes of all indexes and risk factors of cardiothoracic ratio, the cardial function and construct were also determined by echocardiography and chest radiograph every 6 month in all patients. Results: ( 1 ) With the extending of time on PD treatment,CTR was gradually increasing. CTR was 0. 465 ± 0. 041、0. 474 ± 0. 045、0. 492 ± 0. 060 respectively ( P < 0. 01) on pre-PD,and six,twelve months after PD in all patients. Ejection fraction ( EF) presented the downward trend. ( 2) 20 cases ( 16. 3% ) showed swollen,chest distress,blood pressure significantly increased and other clinical manifestation of cardia insufficiency. Among them,diabetic nephropathy was in 7( 35% ) ,refractory hypertension in 16( 80% ) ,continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis in 8 cases ( 40% ) ,and these patients were with serious anemia and rapid decline of rGFR. ( 3) Correlation and regression analysis revealed that BMI ( r = 0. 375,β = 0. 442) ,SBP ( r = 0. 281,β = 0. 217) ,Hb ( r = -0. 283,β = -0. 199) ,fluid removal ( r = - 0. 231,β = - 0. 851) were independent factors for CTR.

        "abstract": "Dense deposit disease (DDD) is a rare disease that has no universally effective treatment. Herein we explore the clinical and pathological features of DDD in Chinese patients and the therapeutic effect of Tripterygium wilfordii (TW).Clinical and pathological data of 10 Chinese patients with biopsy-proved DDD were collected and analyzed retrospectively.The patients consisted of 6 males and 4 females. All of them had heavy proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. Gross hematuria, renal insufficiency, anemia, hypertension and low serum complement 3 (C3) occurred in 3, 3, 5, 6 and 8 cases, respectively. Under light microscopy (LM), 8 cases exhibited membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain disclosed intense PAS-positive bright ribbon-like thickening of glomerular basement membranes (GBM). Immunofluorescence mainly showed diffuse fine granular and short linear deposition of C3 along the glomerular capillary wall. Under electron microscopy, ribbon-like electrondense intramembranous deposits were identified in the lamina densa of the GBM, along the tubule basement membranes (TBM) and wall of Bowman's capsule. Before admission, 6 cases were treated with prednisone, cyclophosphamide and/or cyclosporin A with no response. Proteinuria in 8 cases who received TW during the course decreased at different degrees.The clinical and pathological features in DDD patients were various. The effect of TW in patients with DDD merits further investigation.",

Methods Retrospective analysis of the clinical effect,following-up results and pregnant outcomes in the 88 Ⅰ a1 microinvasive cervical cancer patients treated with LLETZ in our hospital from May 2003 to November 2008. Results The mean age of patients treated with LLETZ is ( 37. 19 ± 6. 41) yrs,young patients( ≤35 yrs) covered 85. 2% . The mean invasive depth is ( 0. 82 ± 0. 76) mm, 75 patients( 85. 2% ) whose invasive depth is ≤1 mm. The 86 patients whose cutting edge is negative are all following-up to now,the period is 12 ～ 72 months,they all have no recurrence until now. Including 27 patients have the desire to delivery,until now,15 patients have been pregnant,the pregnant rate is 55. 6% . Conclusions Following-up to now,the clinical treatment effect of Ⅰa1 cervical cancer by LLETZ is good,especially the clincal treatment effect of LLETZ in patients invasive depth ≤1 mm is ecouraging. And the procedure of LLETZ is simple and won't influence the fertility of the patients. So,treating the microinvasive cervical cancer patients by conservative surgery of LLETZ can be considered to use more extendly in clinical.",

In contrast to the adult patients, the pediatric patients were predominantly female (73.7 vs. 51.9 %; P &amp;lt; 0.05). The prevalence of skin purpura was higher and pulmonary symptoms were less common among pediatric patients than among adult ones (36.8 vs. 13.7 %, P &amp;lt; 0.01 and 26.3 vs. 46.0 %, P &amp;lt; 0.05, respectively). Subtype was correlated with the baseline levels of serum creatinine and treatment response among patients with SSV and was found to have a tendency to predict end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among pediatric patients (hazard ratio 2.273, P &amp;lt; 0.01). The probability of progressing to ESRD was highest in pediatric patients with the sclerotic glomerulonephritis subtype, followed by the mixed, crescentic and focal glomerulonephritis subtypes (in descending order of probability) (P &amp;lt; 0.01).Estimated histopathological classification has a prognostic value for renal outcome and response to therapy in children with SSV.",

        "abstract": "MUTYH is a DNA repair enzyme that initiates a base excision repair (BER) by recognizing and removing 8-Oxoguanine (8-oxoG) and its paired adenine. We demonstrated that both TGF-β1 and H2O2 treatment led to an increased 8-oxoG in cultured human proximal tubule epithelial (HK-2) cells, while the former induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the latter caused cell apoptosis. Without stimulation, HK-2 cells showed MUTYH expression in mitochondria. TGF-β1 triggered a transient upregulation of mitochondrial MUTYH and induced the expression of nuclear isoforms, while H2O2 showed no role on MUTYH expression. Ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice exhibited high 8-oxoG reactivity with tubulointerstitial lesions. After obstruction, the MUTYH expression was increased only in tubules at day 3 and decreased with obvious tubular atrophy at day 10. Particularly, MUTYH was primarily located in normal tubular cytoplasm with a dominant mitochondrial form. A few cells with nuclear MUTYH expression were observed in the fibrotic interstitium. We confirmed that increased MUTYH expression was upregulated and positively correlated with the severity of kidney fibrosis. Thus, renal fibrosis caused a cell-type-specific and time-dependent response of oxidative DNA repairs, even within the same tissues. It suggests that intervention of MUTYH might be effective for therapies.",

From these result and the enthalpies of solution of H 3 BO 3 in approximately 1 mol dm −3 HCl (aq), and of CaO in aqueous (hydrochloric acid+boric acid), the standard molar enthalpy of formation of −10,308.06±6.57 kJ mol −1 for Rb 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O was obtained from the standard molar enthalpy of formation of CaO (s), RbCl (s), H 3 BO 3 (s) and H 2 O (l). The standard molar entropy of formation of Rb 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O was calculated from the thermodynamic relation with the standard molar Gibbs free energy of formation of Rb 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O computed from a group contribution method. Keywords Rb 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O Standard molar enthalpy of formation Solution calorimetry Molar enthalpy of solution Aqueous hydrochloric acid solution 1 Introduction Most of hydrated double borates found in nature and synthesized in laboratory contain alkali metals and alkali earth metals, for example, Ulexite [NaCaB 5 O 6 (OH) 6 ·5H 2 O], Aristarainite {Na 2 Mg[B 6 O 9 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·6H 2 O}, Hydroboracite [CaMgB 6 O 8 (OH) 6 ·3H 2 O] and Inderborite {CaMg[B 3 O 3 (OH) 5 ] 2 ·6H 2 O} [1] . Until now, eight kinds of hydrated double metal tetraborates have been synthesized in laboratory among which the structure of six compounds such as K 1.67 Na 0.33 [B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ]·3H 2 O, NaRb[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ]·4H 2 O, K 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O, K 2 Sr[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·10H 2 O, Rb 2 Sr[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O and (NH 4 ) 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O [2–6] have been established. All compounds contain the [B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2− tetraborate anion which is the same that of borax. The rubidium calcium octaborate dodecahydrate Rb 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O was firstly reported in 1981, and it’s physicochemical properties have not been presented. Thermodynamic properties play very important roles in scientific researches and industrial applications. In previous papers, Li et al. [7–10] reported the standard molar enthalpies of formation of hydrated magnesium borates, hydrated calcium borates, hydrated lithium borates, hydrated sodium borates and hydrated potassium borates. Besides, thermodynamic properties of two hydrated double metal borates, namely Ulexite (NaCaB 5 O 6 (OH) 6 ·5H 2 O) [11] and K 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O [12] have also been studied. In this paper, the standard molar enthalpy of formation Δ f H ° m of Rb 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O has been determined by solution calorimetry, and other thermochemical parameters have also been calculated. 2 Experimental All the reagents used in the synthesis were analytic grade. 46.2 g of a Rb 2 CO 3 (Jiangxi Lithium Factory, China) and 53.0 g of a H 3 BO 3 were dissolved in approximately 300 ml H 2 O. After CO 2 release, the above solution was mixed with 23 g of a CaCl 2 to form an amorphous precipitate, the mixture was stirred during 20 min at 75 °C and leaving at room temperature. The crystallization begins in a few days. Large single crystals are obtained after 10 days. The prodoct was analyzed according to standard methods as following: calcium was titrated by a standard solution of Na–EDTA in an alkaline condition by the addition of buffer solution (pH=9.56). Boron was determined by titration with a standard solution of NaOH in the presence of manitol; rubidium was determined as RbB (C 6 H 5 ) 4 by a gravimetric method. H 2 O content was determined by thermal dehydration. The powder X-ray diffraction data ( Fig. 1 ) of the synthesized compound was obtained using Rigaku D/MAX-2400 with Cu Kα radiation ( λ =1.5418 Å). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and DSC were conducted on a NETZSCH-Geratebau STA 449c, in a flow of N 2 with a heating rate of 10 °C min −1 . FT-IR spectra ( Fig. 2 ) was recorded in the 4000–400 cm −1 region on a Nicolet NEXUS 670 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr pellets. The analytical data of the compound are given in Table 1 . The data shows that the compound obtained is pure and has the general compound formula Rb 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O and it is suitable for calorimetric experiment. Thermochemical reaction used for getting the derivation of Δ f H ° m of Rb 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O was: (1) Rb 2 Ca [ B 4 O 5 ( OH ) 4 ] 2 ·8 H 2 O ( s )+4 HCl ( aq )=2 RbCl ( aq )+ CaCl 2 ( aq )+8 H 3 BO 3 ( aq )+2 H 2 O The standard molar enthalpy of formation of Rb 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O could be obtained by solution calorimetry in combination with the standard molar enthalpies of formation of RbCl (s), CaO (s), H 3 BO 3 (s) and H 2 O (l). The H 3 BO 3 (s) and Rb 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O (s) were dissolved in approximately 1 mol dm −3 aqueous hydrochloric acid, the calculated amount of CaO (s) was dissolved in aqueous (hydrochloric acid+boric acid) which consisted of approximately 1 mol dm −3 HCl (aq) and the calculated amount of H 3 BO 3 , and then the calculated amount RbCl was dissolved in the former mixed solution (hydrochloric acid+boric acid + calcium oxide). High-purity CaO (mass fraction > 0.9999, PR China) was heated at the temperature of 1098 K during 3 h, and stored in a desiccator. The CaO sealed in a glass ampoules inside a box containing P 2 O 5 as a drying agent. Before sealing, high-purity Ar gas was admitted to the glove box to expel the air. Both KCl (mass fraction > 0.9999, PR China) and RbCl (mass fraction > 0.9999, PR China) were heated at 700 and 873 K respectively for 3 h and stored in a desiccator. The H 3 BO 3 (mass fraction > 0.9999, PR China) was used. The HCl standard solution was prepared from azeotropic hydrochloric acid and deionized water, and its concentration was determined by titration with standard borax. An RD496-III Microcalorimeter (Southwest Institute of Electronic Engineering, China) was used. The sensitivity of the instrument was measured through electrical calibration and the accuracy and precision were determined by chemical calibration. The calibration was repeated after each experiment and the average calibration constant was used. The temperature of the calorimetric experiments was 298.15±0.005 K. The experimental data was saved and processed by using a computer. A detailed description is found elsewhere [13] . A glass ampoule containing a sample to be measured, put in the stainless steel reaction cell of the Microcalorimeter and broken after the thermal equilibrium was reached (at least 2 h). The total time required for the complete reaction was about 1 h, depending on the samples. No solid residues were observed in the solution after the calorimetric experiments. 3 Results and discussion To check the performance of the RD496-III Microcalorimeter, the enthalpy of solution of KCl in deionized water was measured at 298.15 K and the results are listed in Table 2 , the experimental value 17.24±0.06 kJ mol −1 is in excellent agreement with that of 17.241±0.018 kJ mol −1 reported [14] . This indicated that the device used in this work was reliable. Tables 3 and 4 give the results of the calorimetric experiments. In these tables, m is the mass of the sample, Δ sol H m is the molar enthalpy of solution of solute, and the uncertainty is twice the standard deviation of the mean. Table 5 gives the thermochemical cycles for the derivation of the standard molar enthalpies of formation of Rb 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O. The molar enthalpies of solution of H 3 BO 3 (s) of 21.83±0.08 kJ mol −1 in approximately 1 mol dm −3 HCl (aq) and of CaO (s) of −188.63±0.88 kJ mol −1 in the mixture of HCl and H 3 BO 3 were taken from our previous works separately [7,8] . The standard molar enthalpies of formation of H 2 O (l), CaO (s), and H 3 BO 3 (s) were taken from the CODATA Key Values [15] , namely −285.830±0.04, −643.9±0.9 and −1094.8±0.8 kJ mol −1 , respectively. The standard molar enthalpies of dilution of HCl (aq) were taken from the NBS table [16] ; The enthalpies of formation of RbCl (s) and HCl (aq) were taken from the NBS table [16] . Therefore, the standard molar enthalpy of formation of Rb 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O (s) could be calculated and the result is −10308.06±6.57 kJ mol −1 . Applying the group contribution method developed by Li et al. [17] for the calculation of thermodynamic properties of hydrated borates, we calculated Δ f H ° m of the Rb 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O to be −10297.45 kJ mol −1 . This value agrees with the experimental result very well. The relative error is 0.10%. Because of no experimental data on Δ f G ° m of Rb 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O available, we used a group contribution method to calculate Δ f G ° m of the Rb 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O to be −9211.72 kJ mol −1 . Combining with the standard molar enthalpy of formation of Rb 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O, the standard molar entropy of formation of Rb 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O (s) has been calculated as −3677.14 J K −1 mol −1 according with the following equation: Δ f S° m = Δ f H° m − Δ f G° m T Otherwise, the standard molar entropy of Rb 2 Ca[B 4 O 5 (OH) 4 ] 2 ·8H 2 O has been calculated to be 797.62 J K −1 mol −1 according to reaction (11) in Table 5 . The standard molar entropies of the elements were taken from CODATA Key Values as 76.78, 41.59, 5.90, 130.571, and 205.043 J K −1 mol −1 for Rb(s), Ca (s), B (s), H 2 (g), and O 2 (g), respectively.

In this work, we developed a damage-free corner rounding technology combining Tetramethylammonium hydroxide wet etching and piranha clean. By optimizing the inductively coupled plasma dry etching conditions and applying the rounding technology, two main trench shapes were demonstrated: flat-bottom rounded trench and tapered-bottom rounded trench. TCAD simulations were then performed to investigate the impact of trench shapes and round corners on device blocking capability. GaN trench metal-insulator-semiconductor barrier Schottky rectifiers with different trench shapes were fabricated and characterized. A breakdown voltage over 500 V was obtained in the device with flat-bottom rounded trenches, compared to 350 V in the device with tapered-bottom rounded trenches and 150 V in the device with non-rounded trenches. Both experimental and simulation results support the use of rounded flat-b...",

Mothods After a collection of 64 patients with knee osteoarthritis(118 knees)CT images from October 2008 to March 2011 in Shanghai Ruijin Hospital, we use Photoshop to handle the images and make statistical comparison with gender, sides, the interior condylar which we chose, and the difference in the different ages group for the post condylar angle(PCA) were measured. We also want to find out the correlation between the 28 knee's PCA before the surgery we measured and the actual femoral prosthesis external rotation in the total knee arthroplasty. Results Different gender,sides,the interior condylar which we chose had no impact on the PCA. Statistical difference(P<0.05) was found beween the group of over age 80 and under age 70. It may be caused by small sample size and individual difference; the actual femoral prosthesis external rotation=4.58+0.05×PCA before the surgery were measured, r=0.057 coefficient of determination R2= 0.0033, we cannot think they have inevitable connection. Conclusions To the patients with osteoarthritis, if we just determine the femoral prosthesis rotation by PCA, we will have inevitably errors in results, the method of balance gap is feasible to judge the external rootation.",

        "abstract": "Graphene has attracted enormous attention due to its numerous remarkable\nproperties and wide range of potential applications. To fully realize its\npotential, graphene needs to be synthesized in large scale with excellent\nquality. Recently several methods, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on\ncopper (Cu), have been developed to synthesize wafer-scale graphene that is\npredominantly a single layer. However, the large-scale graphene films\nsynthesized to date are normally polycrystalline. The presence of grain\nboundaries in these films is generally believed to degrade their quality (e.g.\nelectronic mobility), but there have been very few experiments that have\ndirectly studied such effects. Here we study single-crystal grains of graphene,\nsynthesized by ambient CVD on polycrystalline Cu, and show how boundaries\nbetween coalescing grains affect graphene's electronic properties. The\nsingle-crystal nature of the graphene grains is verified by electron\ndiffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy. Their edges are shown to be\npredominantly parallel to zigzag directions. Raman spectroscopy indicates that\nthe grain boundaries display large D peak, indicating disorder. We discover\nthat these graphene grains can grow laterally cross Cu grain boundaries, a\nunique growth mechanism that opens the possibility of large single-crystal\ngraphene growth on polycrystalline substrates. Our findings also suggest that\nCVD graphene does not have a definite epitaxial relationship with the\nunderlying Cu crystal. We show that the electrical resistivity across the grain\nboundaries is always higher than that within the grains, with weak localization\nand carrier scattering observed in the electrical transport measurements across\nthe boundary.",

The experimental results indicated that the superstoichiometric oxidation of As(III) by KMnO4 could be attributed to the catalytic effect of reductive product of KMnO4. The XRD and XPS results demonstrated that the catalyst was nascent MnO2 rich in potassium. The results also showed that the mole ratio of Mn/As and the initial pH had significant effects on the oxidation of As(III). The time for the oxidation by air was less than 2h with the mole ratio of Mn/As less than 1/10.5 and the initial pH higher than 13. The kinetics of the catalytic oxidation of arsenic was interpreted using the pseudo first order reaction, and the apparent active energy was about 15.01 kJ/mol. The study suggested that the initial oxidation was firstly dominated by the direct oxidation of KMnO4 followed by the catalytic oxidation with the nascent MnO2.",

This study was undertaken to investigate the clinicopathological features and outcome of Chinese DPLN patients with different degrees of crescents.520 DPLN patients with more than 10% histological crescents (cDPLN) were enrolled in this retrospective study. They were divided into three groups: group 1 (10%≤ crescents <25%, n = 240), group 2 (25%≤ crescents <50%, n = 160), and group 3 (crescents ≥50%, n = 120). Another 100 patients without histological crescents were enrolled as a control group. Clinicopathological features, treatment responses, and outcomes were compared among the four groups.There were 450 (86.6%) females and 70 (13.4%) males with an average age of 31.7 ± 11.4 years. Compared with the control group, cDPLN patients had shorter lupus nephritis duration (20.7 ± 34.1 vs. 30.4 ± 48.9 months), higher prevalence of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis syndrome (21.8%), and gross hematuria (26.7%). Laboratory findings indicated more severe hypoproteinemia, hyperlipidemia, and renal insufficiency; heavier proteinuria and microscopic hematuria; higher tubular injury parameters, and lower serological activity in crescentic groups. Histologically, cDPLN patients have severe glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions as well as extensive leukocyte infiltration together with a lesser degree of immune complex deposition. The proportion of death, end-stage renal disease, and treatment failure correlates positively with the degree of histological crescents.cDPLN patients with acute onset and short disease duration mostly show severe renal manifestations, less extrarenal organ involvement, lower serological activity, serious capillary necrosis, severe tubulointerstitial inflammation, atrophy and fibrosis, prominent leukocyte infiltration, less glomerular immune complex deposition, poor treatment response, and worse renal outcome.",

        "abstract": "The traditional identifier locator split network has many issues such as inflexibility, hard to innovate and difficult to deploy. SDN (Software Defined Network) provides a new direction for designing flexible identifier locator split network. The recent identifier locator split network based on SDN use the OpenFlow swicth directly via rewritting the address, which lacks the scalability and utilizes locator address ineffectively. An OpenFlow switch named IDOpenFlow is proposed to support the communication based on identifier. IDOpenFlow switch provides the communication mechanism via encapsulating the packets, which has good scalability and utilizing locator address effectively. IDOpenFlow switch encapsulates and decapsulates packets according flow entries which are installed by SDN controller. Moreover, the prototype system shows that IDOpenFlow effectively supports the communication for both the fixed node and the mobile node. With respect to the issues of software forwarding performance, a high-performance IDOpenFlow switch based on Intel DPDK (which is named A-IDOpenFlow) is proposed. The results of Ixia test tool show that: 1) for packets more than 128 bytes, A-IDOpenFlow switch supports the communication based on identifier at rate of 10Gbit / s; 2) for small packet of 64 bytes, the rate of A-IDOpenFlow is 7.25 times faster than the rate of IDOpenFlow.",

Mice diabetic nephropathy related genes (and ESTs) were found out. Then, a 1.4 kb cDNA (mouse diabetic nephropathy related cDNA No. 411, mdnr411, GenBank accession number AY256858) was amplified and cloned by using RACE method, based on the sequence of EST. Homologous analysis of the sequence was carried out. And the result shows that it is a new cDNA, which is highly homologous with mouse \"RIKEN cDNA 5830436L09 gene (5830436L09Rik) mRNAV. The ORF of mdnr411 was predicted by using DNASIS v 2. 5 Demo program. The result shows that the peptide coded by mdnr411 mRNA has 90 amino acids. And the result of homology screening did not find any obviously homologous protein, except Archaeoglobus fulgidus Na +/H+ antiporter (napA-2), which is partially homologous with the peptide coded by mdnr411 mRNA. All these results show that a cDNA of a new DNA related gene which function is fully unknown have screened and cloned. The foundation for further study of the function of the new gene, and its possible role in the pathogenesis of mice diabetic nephropathy has been laid, which is valuable to further understand the mechanism of diabetic nephropathy.",

Daily single dose of 1 mg/kg (maximum 60 mg/day) prednisone was given until complete remission (CR), followed by gradually decreasing dosage. The clinical data were collected from baseline up to 12 weeks of treatment (Certification No. 2011NLY-006, Clinical trials gov ID. NCT01451710).The patient cohort consisted of 15 males and 12 females. The mean age of the patients was 29.2 ± 10.8 years (range 18-60 years) at the time when they were subject to renal biopsy. All patients had hypoalbuminaemia (23.7 ± 4.13 g/L) and heavy proteinuria (>3.5 g/24 h). Cumulative CR (proteinuria < 0.4 g/24 h) rates were 3.70, 48.1, 92.6 and 100% after 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, respectively. Two cases relapsed after CR, one at 6 weeks of treatment, likely due to failure to follow the corticosteroid withdrawal schedule, and the other one at 8 weeks of treatment accompanied with an upper respiratory infection. Infection, alanine aminotransferase elevation (>2-folds), fasting blood glucose (FBG) elevation (>6.2 mmol/L) and hypopotassaemia (<3.5 mmol/L) occurred in 2, 5, 2 and 5 cases, respectively, but were eliminated after treatment.Corticosteroid therapy is likely effective and safe for MCD-IgAN patients.",

        "abstract": "Key generation is one of the essential components to secure Android devices. Generating a key needs random numbers. In order to acquire high-quality random numbers, a noise source with high-entropy is required. In this paper, we analyze the process scheduling information of Android system, and find that the rules of the PID calling order reflect the change of interruption times. A sequence of time t, which is required to increase the same number of interruptions, follows the negative exponential distribution. The sequence is a Poisson stream that owns a memoryless property, that is, each value of the sequence is only related to adjacent values. So, the increased number of interruption times during the identical time can be regarded as a noise source. Random numbers can be generated by preprocessing the noise source information, quantization and coding. Our experimental results show that random numbers with higher entropy can be obtained with mean non-uniform quantization, sampling per 1ms and suppressing the running of the ksoftirqdr process.",

        "abstract": "To define the functional significance of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) gene polymorphism and to investigate, the production of IL-1ra by monocytes from individuals with different genotypes of IL-1.The genotype of IL-1ra was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Peripheral monocytes obtained from patients with immunoglobin A nephropathy (IgAN), Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) and normal subjects were matched in sex and age between the IL1RN-2 allele carriers and non-carriers. The secretion of IL-1ra, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta in the supernatant of GM-CSF (10 ng/ml) treated and untreated monocytes were measured by ELISA.The secretion of IL-1ra by monocytes stimulated with GM-CSF was significantly higher in the IL1RN-2 allele non-carriers than those of carriers both in IgAN (21.55 +/- 3.08 vs 13.85 +/- 2.24 ng/ml, P < 0.001) and HSPN (23.72 +/- 6.68 vs 12.67 +/- 2.24 ng/ml, P < 0.01) as well as in normal controls (20.29 +/- 1.45 vs 10.51 +/- 2.3 ng/ml, P < 0.001). All showed no significant differences in monocyte secretion of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta by GM-CSF stimulation between the IL1RN-2 allele carriers and non-carriers.These results indicate that a functional correlation of the IL1RN-2 allele and IL-1ra production is present in patients with IgAN and HSPN. This gene polymorphism control of IL-1ra production may contribute to the variety of clinical responses to inflammatory stimulation in individuals with different genotype of IL-1ra.",

Methods Cultured mouse mesangial cells were used. The expression of GLUT1 mRNA was detected by Northern Blot; glucose uptake and its kinetics were determined with a 2-Deoxy-[3H]-D-glucose uptake assay. Results Mesangial cells exposed to enriched glucose medium (20 mmol/L) for 72 hours demonstrated a decrease in both GLUT1 mRNA and Vmax for uptake of the glucose analog, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DOG), as compared to mesangial cells cultured in physiologic glucose concentrations (5.5 mmol/L) . In contrast, hypertonic mannitol had no effect on GLUT1 mRNA levels. TGF-β1 treatment for 10 hours stimulated 2DOG uptake, both in 5.5 mmol/L and 20 mmol/L glucose medium, by approximately 4.28-fold in a dose-dependent manner (2 ng/ml maximum) . Kinetic analysis of 2DOG uptake revealed an increase in Vmax and a decrease in Km in the presence of TGF-β1. TGF-β1 also up-regulated the expression of GLUT1 mRNA in mesangial cells. The addition of anti-TGF-β neutralizing antibody (30 μg/ml) in mesangial cells cultured in enriched glucose medium (20 mmol/L) led to a 40% decrease in 2DOG uptake. Conclusions The expression of GLUT1 can be suppressed by exposure of mesangial cells to high glucose medium, which may serve as a protective mechanism against possible adverse effects of excessive glucose flux into cells. TGF-β1 stimulates glucose uptake by enhancing the expression and function of GLUT1 in mesangial cells. This effect is independent of the glucose milieu in the cultured medium.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis(FSGS) include a number of histological variants, but there is considerable controversy surrounding the significance and definition of these variants because published information regarding the presentation, course, and response to treatment is limited. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the clinical characters and histological variants as well as podocyte lesion. Methodology:One hundred and thirteen adult patients with idiopathic FSGS proven by renal biopsy were studied retrospectively. They were subdivided into five histological variants on the basis of D'Agati's histological criteria: Classic (n=39), tip (n=36), cellular (n=21), perihilar (n=13) and collapsing group (n=4). The differences of clinical features, response to therapy, and clinical outcomes among those five histological variants were investigated. Results:In clinical features, the patients with cellular lesion had a higher level of proteinuria [(10.5±5.10) vs (6.70±6.60),(5.50±5.10) and (3.50±3.10)g/d, P<0.01], higher ratio of patients with proteinuria >10 g/d (57.1% vs 19.4%, 17.9% and 0, P<0.01) compared to that tip, classic and perihillar group. The level of serum creatinine and number of patients with renal insufficiency was similar among four groups except collapsing group, who were higher. The complete remission of proteinuria and renormalization of renal dysfunction were highly attained in patients with tip (52.6% and 81.8%) and cellular group (46.2% and 80%) than that of classic (33.3% and 33.3%) and perihillar groups (18.2% and 0). In histological changes, the patients with tip and cellular variant had less global glomerulosclerosis [(2.70±7.90)% and (4.70±10.9)% vs (11.4±14.4)% and (14.7±15.3)%, P<0.01], less chronic tubular-interstitial lesion (11.1% and 19.0% vs 53.8% and 69.2%, P<0.01) and vascular lesion (58.3% and 52.4% vs 87.2% and 76.9%, P<0.01), and more acute tubular-interstitial lesions (69.4% and 71.4% vs 35.9% and 30.8%, P<0.01) than that of the patients with classic and perihillar lesions. The podocyte number per glomerulus was significantly decreased in all patients than that in controls. The cellular group had the highest and perihilar group had the lowest podocyte number among the four variants except collapse group. Conclusion:The patients with tip variant had prominent proteinuria and more acute tubular-interstitial lesions, but had mild podocyte lesion, so higher complete remission of proteinuria and renomarlization of renal dysfunction were attained as well as the patients with cellular variant. The patients with classic and perihilar variant with lower proteinuria, but with prominent podocyte lesion and more chronic tubular-interstitial and vascular lesions, failed to respond to the therapy.",

To get a fully connected and secure graph, we introduce a secrecy transfer algorithm which combines the random graph and the random geometric graph via an introduction process to produce an acquaintanceship graph Gn,n0. We find that the maximum component of graph Gn,n0 transitions rapidly from small components to a giant component when n0 is larger than a threshold, the threshold is derived, and applications for sensor networks are presented.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most important causes of end stage renal disease in the world. Its hallmark is proteinuria. Therefore, we set out to clarify the structural changes that occur in the glomerular filtration barrier in Chinese patients with true type 2 diabetic nephropathy, and to examine the relationship between these structural changes and proteinuria.42 Chinese patients with true T2DN were divided into three groups according to urinary protein excretion. Glomerular volume, endothelial cell density, endothelial cell number, glomerular basement membrane (GBM) width, podocyte density, podocyte number and foot process width were evaluated using light and electron microscopic morphometry.Glomerular volume and endothelial cell number were increased in diabetic patients, but there was no difference between patients with respect to the degree of proteinuria. As proteinuria progressed, endothelial cell density remained unchanged, while the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and podocyte foot process width increased, podocyte density and number decreased.Podocyte and GBM change more obviously during the development of proteinuria. Besides, proteinuria was inversely related to podocyte density, and directly related to GBM and glomerular volume.",

        "abstract": "Mutations of the apolipoprotein E (apo E) gene are thought to play an etiological role in lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG), a novel kidney disease. Evidence suggesting that mutated forms of apo E may be present in LPG includes elevated plasma concentrations of apo E in LPG patients and deposition of apo E in their glomerular capillaries, and there are published reports indicating that mutations of the apo E gene are present in the Japanese LPG patient population. Conflicting reports, however, exist in the current literature. Therefore, to strengthen the theory that apo E gene mutations may be present in LPG pathogenesis, we chose to examine the 5.5 kb genomic DNA encompassing the entire apo E locus and adjoining flanking regions, in 17 Chinese LPG patients and 10 normal controls. Results suggest that there are no apo E gene mutations present in our LPG patients, including previously reported apo E mutations associated with LPG. Surprisingly, however, when the apo E sequence used in the current study was compared against the apo E gene sequence published in GenBank, 10 ethnic variation sites were identified in the noncoding regions. We therefore conclude that apo E gene mutations may not be the only etiology of LPG, and it is likely that other abnormalities could play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.",

As compared to the commercialized polypropylene (PP) separator, such composite separator presented improved electrolyte uptake, better interface stability and enhanced ionic conductivity. In addition, the lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2)/graphite cell using this composite separator exhibited better rate capability and cycling retention than that for PP separator owing to its facile ion transport and excellent interfacial compatibility. Furthermore, the lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4)/lithium cell with such composite separator delivered stable cycling performance and thermal dimensional stability even at an elevated temperature of 120°C. All these fascinating characteristics would boost the application of this composite separator for high-performance lithium ion battery.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the pattern of monocyte chemoattractant prolein-1 (MCP-1) distribution in the renal interstitium and evaluate its pathogenic role in tubulo-interstitial lesions in patients with lupus nephritis, the distribution of MCP-1 in renal tissue was observed.Eighteen female patients with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis were enrolled in this study. No intensive immunosuppresive therapy was used in these patients during the 3 months prior to renal biopsy. The distribution of MCP-1, infiltration of CD68+ (macrophage/monocyte), CD4+ and CD8+ cells in the tubulo-interstitium of patients with lupus nephritis was detected using immunohistochemical staining with specific antibodies. Renal specimens from patients with minimal change glomerulonephritis were used as controls.MCP-1 protein was widely distributed in the renal tissue of patients with lupus nephritis, mainly located at the baso-lateral surface of tubular epithelial cells (16/18 biopsies), and on the wall of interstitial blood vessels (9/18 biopsies). In contrast, tubular MCP-1 staining was weak and rare in renal tissue from controls (7.4 +/- 6.2% vs 26.7 +/- 22.8%, P < 0.01). Tubulo-interstitial infiltration of CD68+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells was markedly increased in patients with lupus nephritis as compared to controls. The tubular expression of MCP-1 was strongly associated with the amount of CD68+ cell infiltration in the interstitium (r = 0.5420, P < 0.05) and the extent of interstitial fibrosis. There was no correlation between MCP-1 production in tubules and the degree of urinary protein excretion in patients with lupus nephritis (r = 0.0547, P > 0.05).The expression of MCP-1 in the renal tubules and vascular wall was markedly increased in patients with lupus nephritis. The overproduction of MCP-1 in renal tissue may contribute to monocyte recruitment in the interstitium and thus result in tubulo-interstitial damage in lupus nephritis.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the clinical application of four approaches to cervical cancer screening. Methods: A total of 1,137 women of 15 to 59 years old selected from Huaqiaocheng community, Nanshan district of Shenzhen received a population-based cervical cancer screening between November 2004 and December 2004. All of the subjects were investigated by four approaches, including visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), colposcopy, hybrid capture II (HC-II) human papillomavirus (HPV) test and liquid-based cytology test (LCT). Subjects with abnormal or suspicious findings during colposcopy received biopsies. HPV-positive subjects with atypical squamous cells of undetermined sign (ASCUS) based on LCT or HPV-negative patients with low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) based on LCT had biopsies during colposcopy. The pathology results were used as gold standards to evaluate the four approaches for screening for cervical cancer. Results: A total of 122 biopsy specimens were obtained. Pathological examination found no cases of cervical cancer, 3 cases of grade III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), 11 cases of grade II CIN, 36 cases of grade I CIN, 69 cases of chronic cervicitis and metaplasia of squamous epithelium, and 3 cases of normal cervix. The HPV-positive rate was 14.0% by HC-II, the LCT-positive rate was 12.6%, the VIA-positive rate was 12.5%, and the colposcopy positive rate was 13.6%. The HPV-positive rate and LCT positive rate increased as the pathological grade of cervical lesions increased (P<0.005). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive prevalue, negative prevalue, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 100%, 87.1%, 87.3%, 8.8%, 100%, 11.3 and 23.5% for HC-II HPV for detecting high grade cervical lesions; 92.9%, 88.4%, 88.5%, 9.1%, 99.9%, 8.0 and 8.0% for LCT; 35.7%, 96.0%, 95.3%, 10.0%, 99.2%, 8.9, and 67.0% for VIA; and 50%, 86.8%, 86.4%, 4.5%, 99.3%, 3.8, and 57.6% for colposcopy. Conclusion: HC-II high risk HPV detection and LCT are presently two promising approaches for cervical cancer screening. The sensitivity of VIA and colposcopy is lower for detecting high grade cervical lesions and is therefore not suitable for screening, but their specificity and negative prevalue are higher and readily applicable for clinical testing.",

        "abstract": "To observe and compare perioperative myocardial enzyme changes in 107 patients with congenital (CHD, n = 53), rheumatic (RHD, n = 40) and coronary artery (CAD, n = 14) diseases, and to find whether different diseases can affect the release and recovery of myocardial enzymes after heart operations.On the day before operation and the 1st, 3rd, 5th and the 8th day after operation, the venous blood was taken to measure the release of myocardial enzymes: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and LDH-1.All the enzymes measured before operation in three groups were in the normal range; their release increased abruptly on the 1st day postoperatively to 2 - 15 times of those before operation; on the 3rd day, they recovered to some degrees, and on the 8th day they recovered to normal in all groups except LDH and LDH-1 in rh and CAD groups. Because the aortic cross-clamp time (CCT) had a good positive correlation to the release of myocardial enzymes, those patients whose CCT was over 60 minutes in three groups were compared revealing that the CCT was not different between three groups (P < 0.05). The release of CK, CK-MB and AST was significantly higher in CHD60 group than those in CHD60 and CAD60 groups, they recovered afterwards; while the release of DH and LDH-1 was higher in CAD60 group than those in CAD60 and in CHD60 groups from the 1st day to the 8th day postoperatively.The release of all the 5 enzymes measured before operation was in normal range in selected CHD, RHD and CAD patients. The release peak and the recovery order of all enzymes were the same in three groups. The release of CK, CK-MB and AST was higher in CHD60 group than those in RHD60 and CAD60 groups on the 1st day. The release of LDH and LDH-1 was higher in RHD60 group than those in CHD60 and CAD60 groups from the 1st day to the 8th day postoperatively. The shorter the CCT is, the less the release of myocardial enzymes. Using the release of LDH and LDH-1 to evaluate the recovery of myocardial injury after open-heart operations was recommended.",

Ninety-four DCGN lupus patients were enrolled. Their clinical features and renal outcomes were investigated. There were 84 females and 10 males, with a mean age of 27.9 ± 10.7 years old. They represented: hypertension in 73 cases (77.7%), rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in 62 cases (66.0%), 46 cases (48.9%) with nephritic syndrome, 35 (37.2%) gross hematuria, and 14 cases (14.9%) with uremic syndrome needed dialysis therapy. There were 25 cases received repeated renal biopsy. Their histological examination showed the decreasing of active lesions and the increasing chronic lesions. All patients were more than 6 months follow-up, and 79 patients (84.0%) were more than 12 months follow-up. At the first time of follow-up (3 months), the renal function, proteinuria, and anemia were improved significantly in all of cases received intensive immunosuppressive therapy. At the last time of follow-up (56.1 ± 18.8 months), only four patients eventually developed to the end-stage renal failure and five died with normal renal function. The lupus patients with DCGN presented more severe clinical syndromes, which were similar to those patients of type II of DCGN. The relative good renal outcomes were observed in those lupus patients, to which may be contribute to the effective induction therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background/Aims: To compare the efficacy of a new artificial liver support system, fractionated plasma separation and adsorption integrated with hemofiltration, with the old system, plasma adsorption. Methods: Sixteen patients with acute liver failure each received a first session of treatment using the old system, in which plasma was perfused through an adsorber. They then received a second session using the new system, in which albumin-rich plasma separated using a fraction plasma separator was ultrafiltrated using a hemofilter and perfused through an adsorber before being returned to blood. Results: The new system had a higher clearance of bilirubin and slower decline of clearance over time. There was a lower reduction ratio of bilirubin, bile acid, urea, and creatinine; longer prolongation of coagulation parameters; and greater decline in albumin level using the old system compared with the new one. Conclusions: Use of the novel system results in more efficient removal of toxins and fewer deterious effects than the old system. Copyright © 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel.",

        "abstract": "The microRNA-30 family plays important roles in maintaining kidney homeostasis. Patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) have reduced miR-30 levels in glomerulus. TGF-β represses miR-30s in kidney podocytes, which leads to cytoskeleton damage and podocyte apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which TGF-β represses miR-30d in vitro. The human miR-30d promoter contains multiple copies of Smad binding element-like sequences. A fragment of 150 base pairs close to the transcription start site was negatively regulated by TGF-β to a similar extent as the 1.8 kb promoter, which was blocked by histone-deacetylase inhibition. TGF-β specifically enhanced HDAC3 expression. Knockdown of HDAC3 by shRNA or a selective inhibitor RGFP966 significantly relieved the repression of miR-30d mRNA and the promoter transcription. TGF-β promoted HDAC3 association with Smad2/3 and NCoR and caused their accumulation at the putative Smad binding site on the miR-30d promoter, which was prohibited by TSA or RGFP966. Furthermore, TSA or RGFP966 treatment reversed TGF-β-induced up-regulation of miR-30d targets Notch1 and p53 and alleviated the podocyte cytoskeleton damage and apoptosis. Taken together, these findings pinpoint that TGF-β represses miR-30d through a Smad2/3-HDAC3-NCoR repression complex and provide novel insights into a potential target for the treatment of podocyte injury-associated glomerulopathies.",

Methodology:Twelve patients[11 female and one male with average age of(32.4±13.8)years old] treated with PTU and developed to ANCA positive and systemic vasculitis with renal involvement were collected and analyzed.ANCA was detected by IF and ELISA.All patients had renal involvement and renal biopsy. Results:Of the 12 patients received PTU for 2 to 264 months(median 42 mo),and the duration of renal disease was(11.5±20.1)months.All patients had serum positive ANCA,among them,11 cases were MPO-ANCA positive,and one was MPO and PR3-ANCA double positive.All patients presented with hematuria and proteinuria,5 had gross hematuria,the mean urine protein was(1.9±1.6)g/24h,7 had renal disfunction,and 3 required initial renal replacement therapy.Renal biopsy showed pauci-immune necrotizing segmental crescentic glomerulonephritis in 10 cases,sand segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis with membranous lesion in 2 cases.All patients withdrew PTU after the diagnosis and received immunosupressive therapy.Among them,10 cases were followed-up for 13 to 57 months(median 26 mo),one developed to ESRD,2 patients progressed to chronic renal failure,and 7 patients were in completely remission(normal renal function and urine analysis).Serum ANCA turned negative only in 2 patients,ten patients had persistent serum ANCA.3 patients relapsed with the elevation of serum ANCA level. Conclusion:PTU-associated ANCA vasculitis with renal involvement could be necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis,or superimposed on membranous lesion.The prognosis was not benign,most patients had persist positive serum ANCA and relapsed even after PTU withdraw.The prognosis was not benign because of the high risk of the development of chronic renal failure and relapse.",

The solid phase in equilibrium with the biphasic region was Cs2SO4. The binodal curves were correlated using a four-parameter equation. Tie lines were satisfactorily described using the Othmer-Tobias and Bancroft equations. The effects of temperature (25°C, 35°C and 45°C) and molecular weight of the PEG (1000, 4000, and 10 000) on the binadol curve were also investigated. It was observed that the effect of the temperature was insignificant within the investigated range and an increase in the molecular weight of the PEG produced a displacement of the binodal curve toward the origin.",

Methodology:Twenty-four HBsAg positive renal transplant receipts with normal liver function,HBeAg negative and normal HBV-DNA were selected in this study.They were 20 male and 4 female with average age of(39.6±9.86) years old,and divided into two groups:received lamivudine(LAM group,n=11),and received combination of lamivudine and hepatitis B immune globulin(LAM+HBIG group n=13).All of them were received the triple immunosuppressive drugs of tacrolimus,mycophenlate mofetil and prednisone,and followed up at least for over two years.The tests of HBsAg,HBV-DNA copies,the live function were performed during the follow-up time.The recurrence rate of hepatitis B,the rate of acute rejection,and the receipts and allograft survival were compared between two groups. Results:In LAM group,the mean of follow up time was(54.4±24.0) months.Two cases died of acute liver failure and two lost their renal allograft function.The recurrence rate was 18.2%.The receipts survival were 81.8%(9/11),and the allograft survival was 63.6%(7/11).In the LAM+HBIG group,the mean of follow up time was(37.2±8.76) months.None had acute liver failure and died,and also none lost their renal allograft function.The receipt and allograft survival were both 100%. Conclusion:The combination of lamivudine and hepatitis B immune globulin in the HBsAg positive renal transplant receipt can decreased the recurrence of hepatitis B and improve the renal allograft and receipt survival.The conclusion should be made by large scale clinical trials in the future.",

Our investigation revealed that this new class solid polymer electrolyte possessed comprehensive properties in high mechanical integrity strength, sufficient ionic conductivity (3 × 10(-4) S cm(-1)) at 60°C and improved dimensional thermostability (up to 160°C). In addition, the lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4)/lithium (Li) cell using such solid polymer electrolyte displayed superior rate capacity (up to 6 C) and stable cycle performance at 80°C. Furthermore, the LiFePO4/Li battery could also operate very well even at an elevated temperature of 160°C, thus improving enhanced safety performance of lithium batteries. The use of this solid polymer electrolyte mitigates the safety risk and widens the operation temperature range of lithium batteries. Thus, this fascinating study demonstrates a proof of concept of the use of rigid-flexible coupling solid polymer electrolyte toward practical lithium battery applications with improved reliability and safety.",

A cooperative jamming strategy is proposed to thwart eavesdroppers anywhere in the network, even if they are located close to the source or the destination. The basic idea is to defeat eavesdroppers by a divide and conquer strategy, and exploit the helpful interference from the source and the destination to circumvent the nearby eavesdropper problem. Analysis and simulation results reveal that this strategy can enhance the secure connection probability and can tolerate any number of independent eavesdroppers provided that the number of legitimate nodes satisfies certain condition.",

The average age was 71 (60-81). Among them, 5 were type B1, 7 were type B2, 12 were type B3 and 7 were type C fracture according to Vancouver classification. Wire cerclage, clamp, strut of cortical allograft, shape memory alloy sleeve clamp, cable-plate, long stem revision and LISS plate based on the site of fracture, stablility of implant and quality of bone.Results The mean follow-up was 9.5 years. The fracture united healed in type B1 and type C without malalignment. One case of Type B1 fracture was treated with cable-plate initially, the fixation was failed 8 month later, the hardware was revised with LISS plate after 6 month uneventful in those 80 year woman. Another two failure cases, one B1case all implants were removed after several debridement because severe infection, one B3 fracture, LISS plate was used twice and failed finally, the next surgery was anticipated.Conclusions The methods applied for periprosthetic fractures depend upon the site of fracture, stability of implant and quality of bone. Treatment of periprosthetic fracture is still a hard work, prevention is the best manipulation for these fractures. The key of the management is to choose the appropriate therapy.",

        "abstract": "The progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is frequently determined by clinical parameters; however, the predictive value of histologic lesions remains largely unknown. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between histologic changes and renal outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).A total of 396 patients with T2DM and biopsy-proven DN who received follow-up for at least 1 year were recruited. The severity of different histologic lesions was assessed using the pathologic classification established by the Renal Pathology Society. Renal outcomes were defined by progression to end-stage renal disease and doubling of serum creatinine. The influence of histologic findings on renal outcomes was assessed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression.A univariate Cox regression showed that the severity of glomerular and interstitial lesions had a significant impact on renal outcomes (P < 0.001). Scores of vascular lesions demonstrated no association with renal outcomes (P > 0.05). A multivariate COX analysis demonstrated that the glomerular classes and scores of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy were significantly associated with renal outcomes when adjusting for baseline proteinuria, mean arterial pressure and estimated glomerular filtration rate (P < 0.05). The glomerular and interstitial lesions correlated significantly among each other. However, in several patients, the severity of interstitial lesions did not correlate with glomerular lesions.These findings indicated that the severity of glomerular and interstitial lesions were significantly associated with renal outcomes in patients with DN, whereas the vascular indexes did not have any impact on renal outcomes.",

To protect privacy of virtual assets this paper proposed privacy preserving methods using the centrality based on complex network theory. On the basis of not changing the network structure, some properties called centrality of the network topology is treated as noise to made the corresponding weight perturbation to protect the shortest path in the network. And changing of the length of the shortest path lies in a certain range is analyzed. Result of the experiment shows that the perturbation strategy performs great for the protection of the shortest path in social networks, better than the Gauss perturbation strategy.",

The composite films have been explored as an alternative for the counter electrodes of dye-sensitized solar cells. It was manifested that these nanostructured TiN-PEDOT:PSS composite films displayed excellent performance comparable to Pt-FTO counter electrode due to the combined network endowing more favorable and efficient interfacial active sites. Among them, the energy conversion efficiency of the cell with TiN(P)-PEDOT:PSS as counter electrode reached 7.06%, which was superior to 6.57% of the cell with Pt-FTO counter electrode under the same experimental conditions.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To investigate whether tripotolide have direct effect on podocyte injured by Ang Ⅱ ? If so,how does it work? Methodology:The heat-sensitive mouse podocytes were divided into three groups:negative control,positive control treated with Ang Ⅱ (10-6,10-7,10-8mol/L) and pretreated with triptolide (1,3,10 ng/ml) for 2 hours. F-actin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) were observed by fluorescence microscopy. To explore the underlying mechanism,we observed reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the subsequent MAPK activation by flow cytometry and western blot. Results:Ang Ⅱ induced actin cytoskeleton reorganization and ZO-1 redistribution in a dose-dependent manner. In untreated podocytes,the ZO-1 staining was peripherally distributed at contacts of adjacent cells as fine segments,while it appeared markedly fragmented in response Ang Ⅱ,indicating tight junction loose and cell ruffling. Triptolide stabilized actin filaments and improved ZO-1 distribution in a dose dependent manner. At the dose of 10 ng/ml,triptolide almost completely restored the normal cytoskeleton and cell contact in podocyte without affecting cell survival. Ang Ⅱ (10-7mol/L) significantly increased ROS generation in podocyte. This effect was observed rapidly at 10 min and maintained for 30 min. Pretreatment of podocyte with triptolide (10 ng/ml) or antioxidant NAC (10 mmol/L) before Ang Ⅱ exposure led to a significant reduction in the cellular ROS level. In addition,antioxidant NAC successfully reduced Ang Ⅱ-induced podocyte damage as showed by cytoskeleton staining,indicating that ROS generation mediates Ang-induced podocyte injury. Furthermore,triptolide effectively inhibited Ang Ⅱ-induced p-38,ERK1/2 and JNK MAPK activation,which are the downstream signaling molecules of ROS. SB203580 and U0126,which are specific kinase inhibitor for p-38 and ERK MAPK,can block Ang Ⅱ induced podocyte injury. Conclusion:Triptolide showed dramatic protective effect in Ang Ⅱ induced podocyte injury. The protective effect of triptolide might partially contribute to the inhibition of ROS generation and the subsequent MAPK activation.",

        "abstract": "To report endotoxemia presented in a case with multiple myeloma (MM) treated by high cutoff hemodialysis (HCO-HD) being prevented by using ultrapure dialysate. A female inpatient with MM received six times HCO-HD (HCO 2100 dialyzer) within 3 weeks after initiation of a chemotherapy based on vincristine+epirubicin+dexamethasone protocol. Conventional dialysate was used in the first three times and then changed to ultrapure dialysate due to elevation of body temperature after HCO-HD. Free light chains (FLC) and endotoxin levels in blood and dialysate were monitored. After six times HCO-HD, her serum FLC λ decreased from 4689 mg/L to 492.7 mg/L, with a trend of decline of serum creatinine. The clearance, reduction ratio, and removal amount of FLC λ was 38.4 mL/min, 71.0-85.2%, and 9.06-18.02 g, respectively, in the setting of dialysate flow rate 500 mL/min, while in the setting of dialysate flow rate 200 mL/min, the removal efficacy of FLC λ was lower than the former. A rise of body temperature up to 38.5°C after treatment and endotoxemia (endotoxin levels 0.122 EU/mL) was found when using conventional dialysate (endotoxin levels 0.112-0.145 EU/mL), but not seen after changing to ultrapure dialysate. Combined with appropriate chemotherapy, HCO-HD can effectively remove and reduce blood FLC. Attention should be paid to the endotoxemia and the rise of temperature after treatment when conventional dialysate is used, which can be prevented by using ultrapure dialysate.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the study was to analyse the clinical manifestation and management of pulmonary Lophomonas blattarum infection in four allograft transplantation recipients retrospectively. Four patients with pulmonary L. blattarum infection were diagnosed by using Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) examination. Their clinical manifestation and management are summarized. Four cases of pulmonary L. blattarum were found during the period from the second month to the third month after transplantation. Concurring infection by other pathogens was found in three of them. Common initial symptoms included fever (>38 degrees C) without cough and breathlessness. Lower lobe shadowing could be found on chest X-ray. Body temperature decreased to the normal range in three patients and to 37.5 degrees C in the other one, after intravenous injection of metronidazole and tapering immunosuppressant. Radiological examination confirmed improved health condition of the patients afterwards. Two patients received repeated FOB and only dead L. blattarum was found. Pulmonary L. blattarum infection in allograft transplant recipients carry relatively obscure initial symptoms. Possible L. blattarum infection needs to be screened in post-transplantation pulmonary infection patients with similar symptoms, especially in those who respond poorly to anti-infection treatment. Microscopic examination of BAL fluid can help to identify pulmonary L. blattarum infection and metronidazole is an ideal treatment choice.",

        "abstract": "As a major complication of diabetes, diabetic nephropathy (DN) has become a major cause for end stage renal failure. Increasing evidences demonstrated that DN is a kind of inflammation disease. However, the exact mechanism is not completely elucidated. In an effort to investigate the possible role of C3aR in the development of DN, it was found unexpectedly a kind of C3aR highly expressing infiltrates in the renal tissue of patients with DN. To identify the cells and evaluate the possible role of the cells in the development of DN, forty five cases of patients with DN were selected and sections of their renal biopsy were analyzed by histological, immunohistochemical, double immunofluorescence labeling, immunoelectronicmicroscopic methods and toluidine blue staining while another 15 sections of renal biopsy from normal transplantation donor were used as normal controls. The number of C3aR highly positive cells in each section was counted and the density of the cell was calculated, and the correlation between the density of the cell and the development of DN was analyzed. Light microscopic and electron-microscopic analysis revealed that the cells were similar morphologically to mast cell. Double immunofluorescence labeling analysis demonstrated that the cells were positive in CD68 and tryptase staining while negative in CD45 staining, which is also in accordance with that of mast cells. Toluidine blue staining analysis further proved that the cells were a kind of mast cells. Only very small number of the C3aR highly positive mast cells was found in the renal biopsy of normal control group. However, the number of the cells increased with the development of DN, and correlated linearly with the urine protein level and serum creatinine. These results strongly suggested that mast cells are involved in the development of DN. C3aR might play an important role in the recruitment and activation of renal mast cell and thus contribute to the development of DN.",

The separate effects of the molar ratio of methanol to oil, the reaction time, and reusability were investigated. In addition, the catalytic activities of Sr(OH)2 and SrCO3 were also examined for the comparison. The results showed that the basicity and catalytic activity of these catalysts were decreased as the following order: Sr(OH)2 > SrB2 O4 ·4H2 O > SrB6 O10 ·5H2 O > SrB2 O4 > SrB6 O10 > SrCO3, and the reusability decreases as the following order: anhydrous strontium borates(SrB2 O4, SrB6 O10) > hydrated strontium borates(SrB2 O4 ·4H2 O, SrB6 O10 ·5H2 O) > Sr(OH)2. The results indicate that the SrB2 O4 ·4H2 O with regular morphology, which was obtained at low temperature by a simple preparation method, might be as one kind of good potential alkaline earth salts catalyst for transesterification. Moreover, the possible reaction mechanism is proposed and analyzed.",

Herein, a novel kind of poly(vinylene carbonate) (PVCA)-based polymer electrolyte is developed via a facile in situ polymerization method, which possesses the merits of good interfacial compatibility with electrodes. In addition, this polymer electrolyte presents a high ionic conductivity of 5.59 × 10 S cm and a wide electrochemical stability window exceeding 4.8 V vs Li/Li at ambient temperature. In addition, the rigid cyclic carbonate backbone of poly(vinylene carbonate) endows polymer electrolyte a superior mechanical property. The LiFeMnPO/graphite lithium ion batteries using this polymer electrolyte deliver good rate capability and excellent cyclability at room temperature. The superior performance demonstrates that the PVCA-based electrolyte via in situ polymerization is a potential alternative polymer electrolyte for high-performance rechargeable lithium ion batteries.",

        "title": "Ghrelin protects human pulmonary artery endothelial cells against hypoxia-induced injury via PI3-kinase/Akt.",
        "abstract": "Endothelial injury and diminished NO release induced by hypoxia is thought to be a critical factor in the development of pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). Ghrelin (Ghr) is a well-characterized hormone and has protective effects on the cardiovascular system, specifically by promoting the vascular endothelial cell function. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the Ghr on the hypoxia-induced injury in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) and on the involved transduction pathway. Effects were investigated by treating cells with varying concentrations of Ghr in the absence or presence of inhibitors that target phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), in normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 24h. Our results indicated that the treatment with 10(-7) mol/l Ghr significantly enhanced cell viability (P<0.05, n=5) and upregulated the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax under hypoxic condition (P<0.05, n=4), as compared with the hypoxic condition alone. However, an addition of the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 inhibited these Ghr-mediated effects. Moreover, the Ghr (10(-7)mol/l) significantly increased NO secretion and eNOS phosphorylation in comparison with the hypoxia or normoxia alone group (P<0.05, n=4). Nevertheless, the treatment with LY294002 (20 μmol/l) decreased the Ghr-induced NO release as well as the eNOS activity. In conclusion, the Ghr could inhibit hypoxia-mediated HPAECs dysfunction via the PI3K/Akt pathway, and the bcl-2/bax ratio was also involved in the protective action of the Ghr in HPAECs. As such, the Ghr demonstrates a significant potential to prevent and treat PAH affected by the endothelial dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To identify GLUT1 in human mesangial cells and its regulation by TGF-β1 and rhein. METHODS: Identification of GLUT1 was performed in human mesangial cells by analyzing its mRNA expression, protein product, and functional assay. The effects of TGF-β1 and rhein on glucose uptake and GLUT1 mRNA expression in mesangial cells were examined by [3H]-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake and Northern blotting analysis. RESULTS: It was found that human mesangial cells do express functional GLUT1. The 2-DOG uptake of mesangial cells was markedly increased by TGF-β1 stimulation with simultaneous elevated expression of GLUT1 mRNA. Increased glucose uptake and GLUT1 mRNA expression in mesangial cells induced by TGF-β1 were markedly attenuated by rhein in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: We found that functional GLUT1 did present in human mesangial cells. TGF-β1 stimulated the glucose uptake in mesangial cells through upregulation of GLUT1 expression, this effect of TGF-β1 could be antagonized by rhein.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Microvascular angiogenesis plays an important role in the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). We identified in our previous gene chip screening study that angiopoietin-like protein 2 ( ANGPTL 2), as a novel DN associated growth factor, was implicated in the diabetic microvascular lesion. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of ANGPTL 2expression at both mRNA level and protein level in the microvascular lesion of DN. Methodology:Glomeruli were microdissected from renal biopsy specimen of 24 DN patients, and the expression of ANGPTL 2gene was evaluated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The correlations between ANGPTL 2expression and patients' phenotypic characteristics were explored. Results:In consistent with the results obtained from gene chip, a significant upregulation of ANGPTL 2expression was found in glomeruli from DN patients, as compared with the normal controls (95% vs 38%, χ~2=15.9, P<0.01). The pronounced upregulation of ANGPTL 2expression was found in DN patients with less microaneurysm formation (22% vs 66%, P<0.05), fewer infiltrating leukocytes (11% vs 73%, P<0.05) and fewer endothelial foam cell(11% vs 53%, P<0.05) in the glomeruli. Conclusion:Enhanced glomerular expression of ANGPTL 2is reversely correlated with glomerular endothelialium abnormalities in DN patients. This upregulated expression may be a protective response in maintaining the normal capillary arrangement as well as endothelial function in glomeruli in diabetic patients.",

The north-east trending basin consists of five first-order structural units (three depressions and two uplifts) including Zhalenuoer depression, Cuogang uplift, Beier Lake depression, Bayanshan uplift and Huhe Lake depression from west to east, respectively, The Hongqi sag is a second-order structural unit in the north of Beier Lake depression. Research indicates that the Hongqi sag underwent four deformation stages during the Early Cretaceous: Stage of NW-SE extension during the deposition of Xing'anling Group and the Nantun Formation, NE trending half-garben controlled by large scale dustpan-like normal fault as depression-controlling fault developed; Stage of NW-SE compression during the deposition of Damoguaihe Formation and the first member of Yimin Formation, thrust fault formed due to the intensive inversion of early normal fault, the thrust of the hanging wall lead to the uplift of the NW boundary of the sag near the depression-controlling fault, and the block of thrust sliding of the deep part of the depression-controlling fault in the shallow area lead to the rotary uplift of the SE slope zone during the inversion, hence, the size of the sag dwindled obviously, and the large scale NE trending fault-bend fold formed in the center of the sag which consists of the central fault-uplift zone of Hongqi sag; Stage of EW trending extension during the deposition of lower part of the second member of Yimin Formation, the early depression-controlling fault showed features of normal fault, and the newly formed depression-controlling fault had features of sinistral discrete slip; Stage of EW compression during the deposition of upper part of the second member of Yimin Formation, the early depression-controlling fault showed features of thrust of hanging wall again, inverted anticline developed in the hanging wall near the fault, forming fault-bend fold in the sag. During each deformation stage, there were some differences of the structural features of Hongqi sag in space.",

Compared to Non-MCD-IgAN, MCD-IgAN patients were younger,with male predominance, had higher levels of proteinuria, total cholesterol and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), lower incidence of hypertension and microhematuria, lower level of serum creatinine, and had less severe glomerular, tubulointerstitial and vascular lesions in renal pathology. In the Non-MCD-IgAN group, 157 patients (14.0 %) reached the renal endpoint and 103 patients (9.2 %) entered end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The 5-,10-, 15- and 20-year cumulative renal survival rates from ESRD, calculated by Kaplan-Meier method, were 95.0, 83.0, 72.9 and 65.4 %, respectively. In the MCD-IgAN group, no patients entered ESRD and only 4 (1.6 %) reached the renal endpoint. Patients with MCD-IgAN had a significantly better renal outcome than Non-MCD-IgAN (p < 0.01). At multivariate Cox analysis, proteinuria >1.0 g/day, hypertension, eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), hypoproteinemia and hyperuricemia were independent risk factors of renal survival for Non-MCD-IgAN patients [hazard ratio (HR) 3.43, p < 0.001; HR 1.65, p < 0.05; HR 2.61, p < 0.001; HR 2.40, p < 0.001; HR 2.27, p < 0.001, respectively), but not for patients with MCD-IgAN.The long-term outcome of patients with MCD-IgAN is significantly better than that of patients with Non-MCD-IgAN.",

        "abstract": "No consensus has been obtained on the differences between class IV-S and IV-G lupus nephritis (LN), especially regarding renal outcome. Our study investigated clinical-pathological features and prognosis of diffuse segmental and pure diffuse global proliferative LN.In this retrospective study, a total of 120 patients with biopsy-proven diffuse LN were included, of which 31 patients were class IV-S and 89 were pure class IVG. Class IV-S was defined as segmental lesion involving ≥ 50% of all glomeruli, while pure class IV-G was defined as global lesion involving ≥ 50% of all glomeruli with no segmental necrosis or crescents. The clinical- pathological and prognostic features of the two classes were compared.There was no difference in levels of urine protein or serum creatinine between the two groups. Higher serological activity was observed in the pure IV-G group with lower complement C3 (p < 0.001) and C4 level (p < 0.001), compared to the IV-S group. Histologically, immune-complex deposits were significantly more common in the pure IV-G group, with higher prevalence of wire loop (42.7% vs. 0%, p < 0.001) and hyaline thrombi (34.8% vs. 3.2%, p < 0.001). However, the complete remission (CR) rate to intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVCY) induction was lower in the IV-S than in the pure IV-G group (16.7% vs. 53.2%, p = 0.023). After 1 year, the pure class IV-G group had a higher CR rate (71.9% vs. 48.4%, p = 0.017). The 10-year renal survival rate (without doubling of serum creatinine or end-stage renal disease) was significantly lower in patients with IV-S than pure IV-G (75.2% vs. 97.4%, p = 0.028).LN class IV-S and class IV-G without segmental lesion showed different clinical-histological features and prognosis, suggesting that different mechanisms may exist.",

Meanwhile, they have some defects, such as low stability, bad dispersivity and easy to agglomerate. Therefore, in order to meet the industrial requirements, it is necessary to coat the ultra-fine powders to change their surface properties and improve their dispersivity. In the present paper, the Coulomb’s electrostatic attraction mechanism, chemical bonds mechanism and super-saturation mechanism, the basic principles of ultra-fine powders coating are simplely introduced. Then some surface coating technologies are synthetically described, including solid/gas/liquid phase methods and some novel methods, and the advantages/disadvantages of each method are also pointed out. On the basis of the above, it is proposed that the spray pyrolysis coating method is the hopeful technology for industrial applications.",

Based on the experiment, the high frequency noise figure of SiGe HBT can be decreased by reduced Rb and Re with TiSi2. For PD= 200mW, frequency from 0.8 GHz to 1.2 GHz, the SiGe HBT with TiSi2 has lower noise figure than that without TiSi2. The typical noise figure of SiGe HBT with TiSi 2 is 1.6dB at f = 1.1 GHz, whereas, it is 2.0dB at the same status for SiGe HBT without TiSi2. The experiment also shows that the associated gain is improved when SiGe HBT with TiSi2 is used in high frequency.",

        "abstract": "Gene expression differs substantially among individual cells of the same type. We speculate that genes that are expressed in all but a portion of cells of a given cell type would be likely essential and required for either the cell survival (housekeeping) or for the cell type's unique structure and function, enabling the organism to survive. Here, we performed RNA-seq of 20 mouse podocytes using the Fluidigm C1 system and identified 335 genes that were expressed in all of them. Among them, 239 genes were also expressed in mesangial and endothelial cells and were involved in energy metabolism, protein synthesis, etc., as housekeeping genes. In contrast, 92 genes were preferentially expressed in podocytes (over five-fold versus expression in mesangial and endothelial cells) and are, therefore, the essential candidate genes specific for podocytes. Assessments by bioinformatics, conserved expression in human podocytes, and association with injury/disease all support the essentiality of these genes for podocytes. Factually, 27 of the 92 genes are already known to be essential for podocyte structure and function. Thirty-seven novel genes were functionally analyzed by siRNA silencing, and we found that a deficiency of 30 genes led to either cytoskeletal injury (FGFR1, AOX1, AIF1L, HAUS8, RAB3B, LPIN2, GOLIM4, CERS6, ARHGEF18, ARPC1A, SRGAP1, ITGB5, ILDR2, MPP5, TSC22D1, DNAJC11, SEPT10, MOCS2, FNBP1L, and TMOD3) or significant downregulation of CD2AP and synaptopodin (IFT80, MYOM2, ANXA4, CYB5R4, GPC1, ZNF277, NSF, ITGAV, CRYAB, and MTSS1). Thus, the list of genes essential for podocyte cytoskeletons is expanded by single-cell RNA sequencing. It appears that podocyte-specific essential genes are mainly associated with podocyte cytoskeletons.",

        "abstract": "Since the Oxford Classification of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) was published in 2009, MEST scores have been increasingly used in clinical practice. Further retrospective cohort studies have confirmed that in biopsy specimens with a minimum of 8 glomeruli, mesangial hypercellularity (M), segmental sclerosis (S), and interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (T) lesions predict clinical outcome. In a larger, more broadly based cohort than in the original Oxford study, crescents (C) are predictive of outcome, and we now recommend that C be added to the MEST score, and biopsy reporting should provide a MEST-C score. Inconsistencies in the reporting of M and endocapillary cellularity (E) lesions have been reported, so a web-based educational tool to assist pathologists has been developed. A large study showed E lesions are predictive of outcome in children and adults, but only in those without immunosuppression. A review of S lesions suggests there may be clinical utility in the subclassification of segmental sclerosis, identifying those cases with evidence of podocyte damage. It has now been shown that combining the MEST score with clinical data at biopsy provides the same predictive power as monitoring clinical data for 2 years; this requires further evaluation to assess earlier effective treatment intervention. The IgAN Classification Working Group has established a well-characterized dataset from a large cohort of adults and children with IgAN that will provide a substrate for further studies to refine risk prediction and clinical utility, including the MEST-C score and other factors.",

A 1.2-kV, 5-A GaN vertical power FinFET was demonstrated in a chip area of 0.45 mm 2 , with a specific on-resistance of 2.1    $text{m}Omega cdot textsf {cm}^{textsf {2}}$    and a threshold voltage of 1.3 V. Device junction capacitances were characterized and their main components were identified. This was used to calculate the switching charges and practical switching frequencies. Device FOMs were then derived that take into account the trade-offs between the conduction and switching power losses. Our GaN vertical FinFETs exhibit high-frequency (~MHz) switching capabilities and superior switching FOMs when compared with commercial 0.9-1.2-kV Si and SiC power transistors. This letter shows the great potential of GaN vertical FinFETs for next-generation medium-voltage power electronics.",

This vertical fin transistor only needs n-GaN layers, with no requirement for epitaxial regrowth or p-GaN layers. A specific on-resistance of 0.2 mfi-cm 2  and a breakdown voltage over 1200 V have been demonstrated with extremely high ON current (over 25 kA/cm 2 ) and low OFF current at 1200 V (below 10 −4  A/cm 2 ), rendering an excellent Baligau0027s figure of merit up to 7.2 GW/cm 2 . A threshold voltage of 1 V was achieved and was stable up to 150 °C. Large devices with high current up to 10 A and breakdown voltage over 800 V were also demonstrated. These results show the great potential of GaN vertical fin transistors for high-current and high-voltage power applications.",

The first part of the research,i.e.,thermodynamic analysis of leaching,was introduced. The phase analysis shows that the main iron containing phases in kiln slag iron concentrate are Fe,FeO,FeS,Fe2O3,Fe3O4 and FeSiO3. The φ—pH predominance diagram of Fe-Cl-H2O system,as well as the lg c —pH diagrams of FeS,FeO,FeSiO3-H2O system and FeS,FeO,FeSiO3-Cl-H2O system were calculated and plotted,aimed at analyzing the thermodynamic feasibility of hydrochloric acid leaching kiln slag iron concentrate. The analysis results show that all of iron phases in the kiln slag iron concentrate are able to dissolve in hydrochloric acid leaching,and the higher the [Cl ]T,the greater the solubility. Due to different natures of anions in the system,the effects of Cl on the solubility of FeO,FeS and FeSiO3 are not the same,the pH value ranges valid in Cl effect are 4.2 10.8 for FeO,0.4 10.8 for FeS and 0 10.8 for FeSiO3.",

As a result, the structural study of the two units can help to find out the processes of formation and evolution of Yishu graben. Our results show that the activity of the boundary faults of Yishu graben is characterized by multiple centers and imbalance in Eocene-Oligocene epoch. The fault at the east boundary of Tangyuan fault basin is a basin-controlling fault, and the faults at both the east and the west boundaries of Fangzheng fault basin are also a basin-controlling fault, with the west boundary fault at Fangzheng being the major one. Analysis of the fault growth index shows that the NW fault within the graben is identical with the boundary fault in activity, and the two faults both serve to regulate the evolution and development of the boundary faults, and it was found that the transtension direction of the boundary faults of Yishu graben was determined by the Moho gradient tilt direction, since the latter is identical to the extension direction of the graben as a whole.",

        "abstract": "Background  The disease spectrum of crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) has been described in only a few previous studies, and detailed epidemiologic data from China are unavailable to date.  Study Design  Case series.  Setting u0026 Participants  528 patients with biopsy-proven crescentic GN in 2003 to 2013 from a single center.  Predictor  Crescentic GN was classified into 3 types according to immunofluorescence findings: type I was defined as linear deposition of immunoglobulins along the glomerular basement membrane; type II, as glomerular deposition of immune complex; and type III, as pauci-immune deposition.  Outcomes  Demographic, clinical, and serologic characteristics.  Results  Of 528 cases identified, 208 (39.4%) were men, with a mean age of 37.6±16.4 (SD) years at kidney biopsy. 61 (11.6%) patients had type I crescentic GN, 331 (62.7%) had type II (lupus nephritis, 34.3%; immunoglobulin A [IgA] nephropathy, 17.4%), and 136 (25.8%) had type III. Proportions of patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), acute kidney diseases and disorders without AKI, and chronic kidney disease were 86.9%, 0%, and 13.1% for type I; 42.0%, 19.6%, and 38.4% for type II; and 84.6%, 2.9%, and 12.5% for type III crescentic GN, respectively. Serum antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were detected in 11 (18.0%) patients with type I, 15 (4.5%) with type II, and 117 (86.0%) with type III. Anti–glomerular basement membrane antibodies were found in 60 (98.4%) patients with type I, 3 (0.9%) with type II, and 5 (3.7%) with type III. 5-year cumulative renal survival rates for patients with types I, II, and III were 17.6%, 70.1%, and 44.3%, respectively.  Limitations  Retrospective study, single-center experience.  Conclusions  Lupus nephritis may be the most common type of crescentic GN in China, followed by pauci-immune crescentic GN and IgA nephropathy. Almost half the patients presented with AKI, whereas 28.8% of cases showed chronic kidney disease. Clinical manifestations and outcomes varied according to crescentic GN type. The distinction between subtypes based on immunofluorescence and serologic findings has important implications for therapy and outcome.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To investigate the ability to remove different plasma proteins by double-filtration plasmapheresis(DFPP) using various primary separator and secondary separator combinations;based on it,to propose a novel DFPP therapy,and test its ability to eliminate MPO-ANCA from circulation of patients with vasculitides.Methodology:Fifteen patients with serum MPO-ANCA positive diagnosed as vasculitides were enrolled and received 44 sessions DFPP.Three kinds of plasma filters were used to serve as primary and secondary filter,one plasma separator MPS07 and two plasma fraction separators EC50W,EC20W.There were three combinations:MPS07/EC50W,MPS07/EC20W,and EC50W/EC20W combination;in each combination,the former was used as primary filter,and the latter was used as secondary filter.Double volume of plasma was processed,and 30~40g human albumin was supplemented during each session.One received 3 sessions DFPP using MPS07/EC50W,9 received 27 sessions DFPP using MPS07/EC20W,and the other 5 patients received 14 sessions DFPP using EC50W/EC20W.During DFPP,waste plasma was discarded in intermittent way.When the pressure pre-secondary filter reached the threshold value to discard plasma,800ml normal saline was flushing the secondary filter to force filtration of plasma proteins accumulated in filter,before waste plasma was discarded.Sieving coefficients(SC) of albumin,IgA,IgG and IgM were measured for 3 filters,as well as reduction percentage of plasma proteins concentrations,MPO-ANCA titer by single session DFPP.Results:MPS07 filter was well permeable for all above-mentioned plasma proteins(SC>0.6);while EC50W filter was well permeable for albumin and IgG,less permeable for IgA,and little permeable for IgM(SC 0.06);EC20W filter was permeable for only small proportion of albumin and IgG,much less for IgA,and impermeable for IgM(SC 0.03).Single session of DFPP had no effect on serum albumin level,but had diverse effects on other proteins concentration depending on filters combinations and proteins' type.During DFPP using MPS07/EC50W,decline of IgM,IgA,and IgG was(89.7±5.4)%,(61.7±14.8)%,and(30.5±9.0)% respectively.During DFPP using MPS07/EC20W,decline of IgM,IgA,and IgG was(94.2±3.1)%,(96.2±2.3)%,and(64.7±21.0)% respectively.During DFPP using EC50W/EC20W,decline of IgM,IgA,and IgG was(2.80±12.9)%,(90.9±4.4)%,and(43.5±13.8)%,respectively.Reduction percentage of MPO-ANCA titer by single session DFPP using EC50W/EC20W was(34.6±14.3)%.Forced filtration of plasma in secondary filter by normal saline flushing before waste plasma discarding could raise the ratio of IgG/albumin concentration in waste plasma by 24.2%.Conclusion:According to sieving coefficients of three kinds of filters for different plasma proteins,DFPP using EC50W/EC20W filters is better for removal of pathogens like IgG.With more selective removal of IgG,less loss of other larger useful molecules,it is effective to reduce serum ANCA titer.",

ANCA was detected by both immunofluorescence (IF) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All patients had renal biopsy.Twelve patients received PTU for 2-264 months (median 42 months) when PTUAAV was diagnosed. All patients had positive serum P-ANCA, 11 of them were MPO-ANCA, 1 was MPO and PR3-ANCA double positive. All patients presented with hematuria and proteinuria, 5 of them had gross hematuria, urine protein was 1.9 ± 1.6 g/24 h, 7 of 12 (58.3%) patients had renal dysfunction, among them 3 needed initial renal replacement therapy. Renal biopsy showed pauci-immune segmental necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis in ten patients, segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis superimposed on membranous nephropathy in two patients. All patients withdrew PTU and received steroid and immunosuppressive therapy. After a median follow-up of 42 months (range 21-86), 3 patients developed to ESRD, 7 patients entered complete renal remission. Serum ANCA turned negative only in 2 patients, 10 patients had persistent positive serum ANCA. Three patients relapsed with the elevation of serum ANCA level.Renal damage of PTU-AAV could be pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis, and necrotizing glomerulonephritis coexisted with membranous nephropathy. Most patients had persistent positive serum ANCA and had a risk of relapse and progression to ESRD even after PTU withdrawal and immunosuppressive therapy.",

However many organic dyes conventionally used in FRET have functional limitations such as low resistance to photobleaching, narrow excitation bands coupled with broad emission bands, all of which have limited the development and the application of FRET. Therefore new pairs of energy donor and acceptor are needed. Because of the advantages over organic dyes, quantum dots (QDs) have expanded the range of FRET and have been considered as new and significant development trend of FRET nowadays. The theory of FRET and the applications of QDs in FRET are reviewed in this article.",

Devices with a Si-CMOS compatible front-end process were fabricated and the impact of the heterostructure design and doping on device performance is studied. Low subthreshold swing with minimum (Smin) down to 70 mV/decade was achieved by employing an InGaP top barrier layer and a cap doping of ∼2 × 10 19  cm −3  was obtained with a Si-Te co-doping technique. An effective mobility (μ eff ) of ∼4900 cm 2 /Vs at sheet electron density (N) of 3 × 10 12  cm −2  was achieved which is record among InxGa 1 -xAs (x  T ) of ∼60 GHz was extracted for 150 nm channel length MOSHEMTs.",

Methodology:Eighty three patients,43 in elder group(≥65y),and 40 in non-elder group(15-50y),diagnosed as IMN by renal biopsy,excluded possible secondary factors,were enrolled in the study.Their clincal manifestions and renal histological features were investigated.The absolute cell numbers of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets(CD4+,CD8+,CD20+ cells) and CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells(Treg cells) were determined.Another 40 healthy volunteers served as the healthy controls(HC). Results:(1) 28 male and 15 female elder patients with age(67.4±3.70)y(65-78y),26 male and 14 female non-elder patients with age(38.1±7.91)y(15-50y),the incidence of hypertension in elder patients was higher as compared with that in non-elder pateints(67.4% vs 27.5%,P<0.01).(2) There was no difference in the level of urine protein in patients between two groups.Compared to non-elder patients,more elder pateints presented with microhematuria(67.4% vs 27.5%,P<0.01) and had severer impaired renal tubular function,manifested by elevating urine NAG enzyme [(42.3±23.9) u/g·cr vs(29.8±16.5) u/g·cr,P<0.05] and decreasing urine osmolarity [(522±138) mOsm/Kg·H2O vs(642±137) mOsm/Kg·H2O,P<0.01].The levels of serum creatinine [(72.5±14.1)μmol/L vs(65.4±17.7)μmol/L,P<0.05] and blood urea nitrogen [(6.3±2.6)mmol/L vs(4.93±1.87)mmol/L,P<0.01] in eder patients were higher as compared with that in non-elder group.(2) The chronic tubulointerstitial lesions and glomerular sclerosis occurred more frequent in elder patients than in non-elder patients(P<0.01,P<0.05).(3) Comparing with HC,both elder and non-elder patients showed an increase in the number of B cells and a decrease in the number of regulatory T cells.The numbers of CD4 and CD8 subsets and ratio of CD4/CD8 were similar between non-elder patients and HC.In contrast,elder patients showed a marked decrease in the number of CD8 cells [(328±106) cells/μl vs(464±200) cells/μl,P<0.01],[(328±106) cells/μl vs(430±200) cells/μl,P<0.01],and an increase of CD4/CD8 ratio(2.40±0.97 vs 1.52±0.48,P<0.01),(2.40±0.97 vs 1.81±0.89,P<0.01) as compared with that in HC and non-elder pateints. Conclusion:Hypertension,microhematuria and impaired renal tubular function occurred more frequently in elder IMN patients.These might be affect on prognosis and response to treatment in elder IMN.The alterations of immune system function in elder IMN patients were characterized by a marked decrease of the number of CD8 cells and imbalance of CD4 and CD8 subsets.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to identify urinary microRNAs (miRNAs) as biomarkers for FSGS disease activity.Candidate urinary miRNAs were identified in pooled urine samples from patients with active FSGS (FSGS-A) and FSGS in remission (FSGS-CR), and were then validated using individual samples. Their levels were compared both under different treatment responses in a prospective study of FSGS and in patients with different membranous nephropathy (MN) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) disease activity. The prediction of these miRNAs for treatment responses was further analyzed in both retrospective and prospective cohorts of patients with FSGS.All 54 miRNAs were included as candidate biomarkers, including those with high levels in patients with FSGS-A (n=9) under the TaqMan Low Density Array as well as those with conserved expression in kidneys and involved in immune response. TaqMan probe-based quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the higher levels of four miRNAs in patients with FSGS-A in two independent cohorts (n=18 and n=80). Urinary miR-196a, miR-30a-5p, and miR-490 discriminated FSGS-A from FSGS-CR, with an area under the curve of ≥ 0.80. After steroid treatment, their levels were lower in steroid-responsive patients with FSGS (all P<0.001), but were unchanged in steroid-resistant patients. The levels of miRNAs were similar between active MN and MN in remission as well as active DN and incipient DN (all P>0.05). Urinary miR-30a-5p marginally predicted the response to steroid treatment in patients with FSGS-A, with an area under the curve of 0.63 (P=0.03).The levels of urinary miR-196a, miR-30a-5p, and miR-490 are associated with FSGS disease activity.",

        "abstract": "Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) showed promising results in the management of critically ill patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)/sepsis. However, the underlying mechanism is still not very clear. A change of immune homeostasis in critically ill patients during CRRT was observed only to a smaller degree.The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that high-volume continuous venovenous hemofiltration (HV-CVVH) treatment could improve monocyte function and restore immune homeostasis in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).This was a prospective clinical trial in the surgical intensive care unit of a teaching hospital. Subjects were 16 patients with severe acute pancreatitis: sepsis group (n=7): positive culture result and in the late phase of disease (from onset of SAP to receiving CVVH therapy: more than 3 days); and nonseptic group (n=9): negative culture result and early phase of disease (less than 3 days). Patients received 72 hours of HV-CVVH. We measured the change in mean arterial pressure, APACHE II score, monocyte functions (including antigen-presenting and cytokine production ability), and plasma cytokines.Mean arterial pressure were stable accompanied with APACHE II score improvements. HLA-DR expression on monocytes (antigen-presenting ability) were markedly decreased (p<0.0001) in all patients. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF-alpha, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-10 production from patients' monocytes markedly decreased in septic patients, but significantly increased in nonseptic patients. During HV-CVVH treatment, HLA-DR expression was markedly increased in nonseptic patients in 24 hours (p<0.05), and in septic patients in 72 hours (p<0.05). LPS-induced cytokine production was decreased in nonseptic patients, but not significantly changed in septic patients. The change of plasma cytokines showed the same trend.In patients with SAP, HV-CVVH was associated with improved hemodynamics. HV-CVVH restores monocytes functions, especially in patients in the early phase of the disease and without sepsis. These findings suggest a potential role for HV-CVVH in the treatment of SAP.",

Methods From Dec.1992 to Sep. 2005, 706 infants ( 417 males,289 females )were operated on for their VSD. Their ages ranged from 0.067 to 36 months (14.6±8.7 months ). Their body weight ranged from 3 to 22.5 kg.(10.8±8.3kg).476 cases were less than 10 kg (67.4%).All patients underwent VSD repair under hypothermic anaesthesia with cardiopulmonary bypass. If necessary, deep hypothermic and low flow, improved superfilter was used.436 cases were repaired with direct stitch closure and 270 with patch closure. Subpulmonary VSD should be repaired early to prevent aortic insufficiency. The care and therapy of the respiratory system and circulatory system must be paied attention to after operation. The monitor and treatment of peroperative pulmonary hypertension must be thought highly of, too. Results There were 18 deaths (10 infants who less than 6 months, one new born ), with operative mortality of 2.55%. One infant died 66 days after operation. The morbidity was 11.2%. Conclusion The satisfactory result can be acquired in infantile operation of VSD. But, the operative indication about the infants who less than 6 months must be control strictly.",

        "abstract": "Objectives. To investigate the effect of rhein on endothelial plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) mRNA expression and protein production induced by transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1), and to explore the mechanism of the protective action of rhein on endothelial cells. Methods. A human umbilical endothelium derived cell line (ECV-304) from ATCC was used in this study. The PAI-1 mRNA expression and protein synthesis in the endothelial cells were detected by Northern blot and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The activity of phospho-p44/p42 MAP kinase induced by TGFβ1 was determined by immunoprecipitation analysis and western blot. Results. TGFβ1 rapidly increased PAI-1 mRNA expression in the endothelial cells, and this effect lasted at least 24 hours. The upregulation of PAI-1 mRNA expression induced by TGFβ1 in endothelial cells was inhibited by rhein in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, rhein inhibited endothelial PAI-1 protein production. Further study revealed that rhein had a significant inhibitory effect on the activity of phosphop44/p42 MAP kinase induced by TGFβ1 in human endothelial cells. Conclusions. Our results showed that rhein may have a protective effect on the endothelial dysfunction by inhibiting overexpression of PAI-1, indicating a way for the treatment of vascular diseases.",

        "abstract": "The ark shell Scapharca broughtonii is a commercially important shellfish in China. Alserver's solution (AS), modified Alserver's solution (MAS) and Heparin sodium solution (HSS) are common anticoagulants used for shellfish blood. To observe the immune response mediated by its hemocytes, we challenged in vivo S. broughtonii hemolymph with Vibrio anguillarum and dealt with the following three anticoagulants in vitro: Alserver's solution (AS), modified Alserver's solution (MAS) and Heparin sodium solution (HSS). The methodologies we used were immunostimulation with V. anguillarum, Wright-Giemsa staining, micro-examination, and flow cytometric and hydrolyzing enzyme activity analysis. The results showed that all three types of anticoagulants effectively prevented blood clotting in ark shellfish. The morphology of hemocytes did not significantly change 30 h after anticoagulant treatment, except for the shrinking of hemocytes after administering HSS. The size and permeability of hemocytes changed when treated with the anticoagulants and when stimulated with V. anguillarum. Both alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and acid phosphatase (ACP) in hemocytes and Plasma were measured at different times after they were stimulated with V. anguillarum in HSS and MAS. The AKP enzymatic activity in HSS was somewhat higher than in the MAS anticoagulant, but changes in response to V. anguillarum challenge of enzymatic activity were almost the same in HSS and MAS groups. In conclusion, all three types of anticoagulants may be used for ark shell blood preservation. They all changed the cell-surface characteristics of hemocytes to inhibit clot formation. The AS anticoagulant was appropriate for maintaining white and red cell shapes, while MAS was ideal for retaining throbus cell function. Lastly, HSS was appropriate for maintaining enzymatic activity in hemolymph and function of hemocytes. Following this investigation, we gained insight into the changes in hemolymph characteristic during immune response.",

Methodology:Thirty-four female patients diagnosed class Ⅳ-G LN (according to ISN/ RPS 2003 classification criteria) were randomly assigned to either FK506 0.1 mg/(kg·d) for 6 months (n=17) or intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVC) 0.5-1.0 g/m~2 BSA monthly for 6 months (n=17) in addition to corticosteroids. The primary end point was complete remission (CR) at 6 months (defined as a value of proteinuria <0.4 g/24hr with normal urinary sediment, serum albumin ≥3.5 g/dl and a normal value of serum creatinine or no more than 15% above the base-line values). A secondary end point was partial remission (PR) and remission at 6 months. Results:1) Clinical efficacy: The remission occurred in 16 out of 17 patients (94.1%) in the FK506 group and 14 out of 17 patients (82.4%) in the IVC group. There were 64.7% in the FK506 group and 41.2% in the IVC group that achieved CR (P=0.303). The average time to reach PR in the FK506 group was significantly less than that in the IVC group (1.9±1.2 vs 3.2±1.8 months,P=0.034) while the time to reach CR was 4.0±1.3 and 5.0±1.2 months, respectively. The improvements in SLE-DAI, proteinuria, urine RBC, serum albumin, serum complement and anti-dsDNA were similar in both groups. 2) Dosage and trough blood level of FK506: The average dosage of FK506 was 0.08-0.09 mg/(kg[DK]·d) and trough blood level was 5.7-7.1 ng/ml. Those who achieved CR with high blood level of 8.1±3.9 ng/ml and those of PR were 5.2±2.7 ng/ml. 3 patients whose blood level less than 5.0 ng/ml also achieved CR. 3)Adverse effects: In the FK506 group, the adverse effects of infection, temporary GPT/GOT rise, leucopenia, irregular menstruation were lower than that in the IVC group. In contrast, elevated blood pressure, hyperglycemia, transient increase in SCr and alopecia were higher in the FK506 group with no statistics significance. Conclusion:FK506 was an effective immunosuppressor, which had quick response and less adverse effects, as the inducing treatment in patients with diffuse proliferative LN.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To analyze the incidence of complications in different stage patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). Methodology:Seven hundred and seventy four patients with clinical or biopsy-proven 2 type DN were enrolled. They were divided into microalbuminuria (n=210),proteinuria (n=246) and renal dysfunction group (n=318) according to the level of urine protein and serum creatinine. We calculated the complication incidence in patients in different stage and compared the difference of their metabolic parameters. Results:The mean age of these patients was (56.6±11.3) years old,and the median duration of diabetes mellitus was 96 months,and 12 months for DN. Hypertension presented in 80.6% patients with DN,most of whom with impaired renal function. Retinopathy was gradually increasing with the progression of DN. The prevalence of retinopathy in patients with impaired renal function was statistically higher than that in patients with normal renal function. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy was 49.5%,most of which was superficial sensation disorder. Gastrointestinal dysfunction and impotence were predominant in autonomic neuropathy. The neuropathy occurred in majority of patients with impaired renal function. The difference of prevalence of angina and myocardial infarct wasn't distinguished among the patients in different stages. Myocardium ischemia was more common in patients with elevated serum creatinine,counting for 40.3%. Myocardium diastolic function decreased with the development of DN. Cerebral ischemia was predominant in cerebral vessels diseases. Diabetic foot was scarce in these patients. The prevalence of intermittent claudication was 7.5 percent. The qualification rate of glycosylated hemoglobin was higher in microalbuminuria group than those in proteinuria and renal dysfunction group. There was statistically difference between microalbuminuria and proteinuria group. Fasting and postprandial blood glucose were controlled better in microalbuminuria group compared with the other two groups. Abnormal lipid metabolism presented predominantly with hypertriglyceridemia and elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Conclusion:Diabetic other macro-and micro-vascular complications occurred simultaneously in patients with type 2 DN. The complications were diverse and severe in patients with severe renal dysfunction. It was emphasized that comprehensive treatment is necessary for the patients with DN. Intensive controlling of blood glucose,blood lipid and blood pressure and preventing microalbuminuria were the key for improving the prognosis,reducing complications and ameliorating the life quality of DN patients.",

        "abstract": "Identifying protein targets for a bioactive compound is critical in drug discovery. Molecular similarity is a main approach to fish drug targets, and is based upon an axiom that similar compounds may have the same targets. The molecular structural similarity of a compound and the ligand of a known target can be gauged in topological (2D), steric (3D) or static (pharmacophoric) metric. The topologic metric is fast, but unable to represent steric and static profile of a bioactive compound. Steric and static metrics reflect the shape properties of a compound if its structure were experimentally obtained, and could be unreliable if they were based upon the putative conformation data. In this paper, we report a pharmaceutical target seeker (PTS), which searches protein targets for a bioactive compound based upon the static and steric shape comparison by comparing a compound structure against the experimental ligand structure. Especially, the crystal structures of active compounds were taken into similarity calculation and the predicted targets can be filtered according to multi activity thresholds. PTS has a pharmaceutical target database that contains approximately 250 000 ligands annotated with about 2300 protein targets. A visualization tool is provided for a user to examine the result.

        "abstract": "Early diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is difficult although it is of crucial importance to prevent its development. To probe potential markers and the underlying mechanism of DN, an animal model of DN, the db/db mice, was used and serum and urine metabolites were profiled using gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Metabolic patterns were evaluated based on serum and urine data. Principal component analysis of the data revealed an obvious metabonomic difference between db/db mice and controls, and db/db mice showed distinctly different metabolic patterns during the progression from diabetes to early, medium, and later DN. The identified metabolites discriminating between db/db mice and controls suggested that db/db mice have perturbations in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA, citrate, malate, succinate, and aconitate), lipid metabolism, glycolysis, and amino acid turnover. The db/db mice were characterized by acidic urine, high TCA intermediates in serum at week 6 and a sharp decline thereafter, and gradual elevation of free fatty acids in the serum. The sharp drop of serum TCA intermediates from week 6 to 8 indicated the downregulated glycolysis and insulin resistance. However, urinary TCA intermediates did not decrease in parallel with those in the serum from week 6 to 10, and an increased portion of TCA intermediates in the serum was excreted into the urine at 8, 10, and 12 wk than at 6 wk, indicating kidney dysfunction occurred. The relative abundances of TCA intermediates in urine relative to those in serum were suggested as an index of renal damage.",

ESRF rate was 11.6% in this group of patients. Eight patients died (2 died of infections and 6 died of ESRF) during the follow-up period. At the beginning of the study the rates of hypertension, persistent anemia and hematuria in Group II were 50%, 70%, and 70% respectively, being much higher than those in Group I. The calculation of AI and CI in 60 patients revealed that there were 65% of patients with AI > or = 7 and 70% of patients with CI > or = 3 in Groups II and III, while in Group I there were only 32% of patients with AI > or = 7 and 19% of patients with CI > or = 3. Sixteen cases had pathologic class changed in 48 repeated biopsies. Seven cases changed to Class IV, 5 to Class II, 3 to Class V from other classes and one to class III from Class II.Factors associated with the development of renal insufficiency in these lupus patients included hypertension, anemia and hematuria. Renal biopsy evaluation offered additional prognostic information and showed that patients with severe active and chronic histologic changes were at risk for developing renal insufficiency. During the clinical course, the renal classification of LN changed in certain patients, thus the histologic classification of renal morphology at initial presentation did not fully predict the outcome. Renal involvement is very common in systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) patients. Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common form of secondary renal disease in China. It has various and unpredictable clinical features. The risks associated with its treatment have challenged investigators to detect the factors which may influence the survival rate of patients with LN and to develop the rational approaches to therapy. Decades of intensive investigation at many centers around the world had underscored the predictive value of demographic, clinical and laboratory data prior to treatment. Controversies still existed due to the difference in environment, race and the selection criteria of patients as well as the method used to evaluate the outcome. There are still some factors which are thought to have an impact on the prognosis of LN. Most of the articles on the prognosis of patients with LN were reported from Europe and America either about Caucasian or African-American patients. The prognosis of LN and its influence in Chinese patients need more elucidation.",

Methods: Medical records of 61 patients with pulmonary infection after renal transplantation from January 2003 to July 2008 in our hospital were reviewed in this retrospective study. According to stages of infection onset, we divided all patients into two groups, early onset group (43/61, 70. 5%, ≤ 12 months after transplantation) and late onset group (18/61, 29. 5%, > 12 months after transplantation). Clinical manifestations and prognosis were compared between the two groups. Results: In the early onset group, the radiographic manifestation suggested diffuse interstitial changes of bilateral lungs. Combination of anti-infective therapy and early mechanical ventilation was preferred. While in the late onset group, unilateral pulmonary lesions were seen in most cases. More patients showed cardiac and gastrointestinal complications in this group, the mortality of which was much higher. Conclusions: Pulmonary infection is a major complication of renal transplantation. The etiology, clinical characteristics and prognosis of infection varies with the stage after transplantation. Effective preventive and therapeutic measures should be applied more vigorously in patients with pulmonary infection, especially early onset ones.",

Methodology:All of MHD patients with diabetic nephropathy from Jan 1,1989~Aug 1,2007 were enrolled this retrospective study. The clinical data were collected and analyzed:(1) Demographic and laboratory data,chronic and acute complications at the initial stage of treatment. (2) Sufficiency of hemodialysis,and vascular access. (3) Prognosis and outcome:long-term survival rate,causes of death and factors related with mortality. Results:(1) They were 83 patients with a mean of (61.6±11.6) years old,57.8% of them was more than 60 yrs. The duration of diabetes and nephropathy was (13.5±8.33) and (3.27±3.25) yrs respectively at the initial hemodialysis therapy. (2) Cardiovascular disease before hemodialysis including coronary artery disease (24.1%),chronic cardiac failure (22.9%) and cardiac arrhythmia (6.02%),the main cerebrovascular disease was cerebral infarction (14.5%),and Charlson complication index was 4.86±0.98. (3) Acute complications at the initital of hemodialysis were:left heart failure/pulmonary edema (51.8%),pulmonary infection (26.5%),uremic pericarditis (9.64%) and electrolyte disturbances. The pre-treatment SCr was (701.0±230) μmol/L,serum albumin was (34.51±6.06) g/L,and Hb was (7.56±1.64) g/L. (4) They were divided into two groups according to weekly hemodialysis time:12 h/wk and 13.5 h/wk,the calculated Kt/v-urea was not differed between two groups,while the decreasing rate of phosphorus were higher in the 13.5 h/w group [(58.37±11.82)% vs (52.45±12.41)%,P<0.05]. (5) Vascular access operation was performed in 23(27.71%) cases for more than twice times and long-term catheter was implemented to 13 cases for short of ideal blood vessels. (6)The estimated mean survival time was (80.3±11.6) month. The 1-and 3-year survival rate was (85±5)% and (68±7)%,5-and 10-year survival rate were (46±9)% and (33±10)%. The main causes of death in short and long-term survival patients were cerebral accident (47.1%) and infection (44.4%) respectively. The age,chronic complications,BMI and weekly dialysis time were the main influence factors of long-term survival. Conclusion:Most of the hemodialystic diabetic patients in this group were elder with multiple complications. The estimated 1,3,5 and 10 year survival rate was 85%,68%,46% and 33%. The main causes of death in short and long-term survived patients were cerebral accident and infection respectively. The age,chronic complications,BMI and dialysis adequacy were the possible agents related with long-term survival.",

This study investigates the potential therapeutic benefits of atorvastatin as an affordable treatment for pulmonary hypertension patients. 220 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) were randomised, double-blind, to receive atrovastatin 10 mg daily or matching placebo in addition to supportive care. At 6 months, 6-min walk distance decreased by 16.6 m in the atorvastatin group and 14.1 m in the placebo group. The mean placebo-corrected treatment effect was -2.5 m (95% CI: -38-33; p=0.96), based on intention to treat. A small nonsignificant increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and fall in cardiac output was seen in both treatment groups. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients who improved, remained stable or showed a deterioration in World Health Organization functional class between atorvastatin and placebo treatments. Nine patients died in the atorvastatin group and 11 in the placebo group. Serum cholesterol levels fell significantly on atorvastatin treatment. Discontinuation rates were 23.2% and 26.9% on atorvastatin and placebo, respectively. Atorvastatin 10 mg daily has no beneficial effect on the natural history of PAH or CTEPH over 6 months.",

        "abstract": "Since the term chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) was removed from the Banff scheme in 2005, transplant glomerulopathy (TG) has been regarded as a clinicopathological entity that is one of the major causes of graft loss. To assess the distinction between CAN and TG, we performed a comprehensive evaluation comparing TG with traditional CAN.We compared the clinicopathological features of 43 cases of TG with 43 matched cases of non-TG CAN (non-TG group) after renal transplantation. TG was diagnosed by light microscopy based on the double contours of the glomerular basement membranes, and the Banff 97 classification system was used to score TG severity (cg0-3).Compared to the control group, we found a significantly higher incidence of positivity for human leukocyte antigen class-I and II antibodies, a higher incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and poorer graft survival in TG patients. Clinically, TG was associated with a higher prevalence of proteinuria, hematuria, anaemia and hypoalbuminemia. Histologically, TG strongly correlated with antibody related microcirculatory injuries, including glomerulitis, peritubular capillaritis and peritubular capillary (PTC) C4d deposition. Interestingly, the TG patients showed a significantly higher incidence of IgA deposition than the control patients. C4d-positive TG was correlated with higher TG and PTC scores, and PTC C4d deposition was correlated with a more rapid progression to graft dysfunction. TG accompanied by HCV infection was associated with heavier proteinuria, higher TG and C4d scores, and poorer graft survival.TG presents clinicopathological features that are distinct from non-TG cases and leads to poorer outcomes. PTC C4d deposition is related to a more rapid progression to graft loss, suggesting ongoing antibody reactivity. HCV-positive TG is a more severe sub-entity, that requires further investigation.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health concern and a key determinant of poor health outcomes. While the burden of CKD is reasonably well defined in developed countries, increasing evidence indicates that the CKD burden may be even greater in developing countries. Diabetes, hypertension, and obesity are major contributors to the global burden of the disease and are important  traditional  CKD risk factors; however,  nontraditional  CKD risk factors such as nephrotoxin exposure, kidney stones, fetal and maternal factors, infections, environmental factors, and acute kidney injury are also increasingly being recognized as major threats to global kidney health. A broad approach to CKD prevention begins with the identification of CKD risk factors in the population, followed by the development of appropriate mitigation strategies. Effective prevention policies rely on an accurate understanding of the incidence and prevalence of CKD in a given setting, as well as the distribution and burden of risk factors. Populations or individuals at CKD risk must be screened and treated early to prevent the onset of and delay the progression of the kidney disease. Systematically collected data should be analyzed at country, province, and district levels to identify regional disparities and CKD hotspots and develop targeted prevention strategies. Race-ethnicity, genetics, sex, socioeconomic status, and geography are likely modifiers of CKD risk. A comprehensive, informed approach to prevention that takes into account all of these factors is therefore required to successfully tackle the global CKD epidemic.",

        "abstract": "Objective To study the relationship between expressions of α,β-catenin and cyclin D1 and the occurrence,infiltration and metastasis.Methods High sensitive S_P immunohistochemical method was used to detect the protein expressions of α,β-catenin and cyclin D1.Results Abnormal immunoreactivity of α,β-catenin was observed in 42(70%) cases respectively.There were 28 cases(46.7%) who showed cyclin D1 overexpression.The abnormal expression rates of α,β-catenin in ILC were significantly higher than those in IDC(P<0.05),but had no relation to the extent of differentiation and lymphatic metastasis(P>0.05).The overexpression rate of cyclin D1 was correlated with tumor stage,lymphatic metastasis(P<0.05),but not with histological type and the extent of differentiation(P>0.05).Cyclin D1 overexpression was observed in 57.1%(24/42) of these cases showed abnormal staining of β-catenin,but only observed in 22.2%(4/18) of these cases with normal membranous staining of β-catenin.There was a significantly positive correlation between the abnormal expression of β-catenin and overexpression of cyclin D1(r_s=0.321,P<0.05).Conclusions The abnormal expression of β-catenin may play an important role in the genesis of the breast cancer by triggering cyclin D1 overexpression in breast cancers.The abnormal expression of α,βcatenin is not a key factor in neoplastic cell metastasis in breast cancer,but may also involve in this progress.",

After the pad parasitics and extrinsic circuit elements are determined and removed from the measured  S -parameter, the admittance matrix of intrinsic HBT in common-emitter configuration is derived in the form of non-linear rational function, as a function of angular frequency. Eight constants are accurately obtained based on the non-linear rational function fitting over the whole range of frequencies. Then the intrinsic circuit elements are directly determined in an analytical closed-form manner without any numerical optimization or special test structure. The proposed technique is successfully validated with several sized SiGe HBTs from 100 MHz to 20.89 GHz, and excellent agreement is obtained between the measured and simulated  S -parameters over the whole frequency range.",

Methodology:One hundred twenty four cases(112 females,12 males,mean age 29.22±11.4 years) of LN class Ⅱ were divided into nephritic syndrome group (NS,n=27) and non-NS group (n=97).The degree of mesangial proliferation was graded into normal (M0)、mild (M1)、moderate (M2) and severe (M3).Diffuse foot process effacement was defined as more than 50% of the glomerular capillary loops showing foot process effacement by EM.Clinical,immunological,pathological features and prognosis were compared between the two groups. Results:No significant differences in gender,onset age,LN duration,and SLE duration were found between the two groups.Compared with non-NS group,the patients with NS group had a much higher incidence of renal manifestations as the first onset symptom (77.8% vs 15.5%,P<0.01) and acute kidney injury (29.6% vs 0,P<0.01),but much lower incidence of malar rash (40.7% vs 69.1%,P<0.01),fever (14.8% vs 62.9%,P<0.01),arthritis (29.6% vs 75.3%,P<0.01),hematuria (0 vs 34%,P<0.01) and serum anti-dsDNA positivity (29.6% vs 52.6%,P<0.05).In renal histology,the NS group had less severe mesangial proliferation (M2+M3:7.4% vs 59.8%,P<0.01),but significantly higher incidence of diffuse foot process effacement (88.9% vs 0,P<0.01) than that in non-NS group.Remission rate showed no differences between the two groups (100% vs 98.4%,P>0.05),but the recurrence rate was much higher in NS group than that in non-NS group (69.9% vs 33.3%,P<0.01),and no patient progressed to end stage renal failure after the follow-up for 8~125 months (median 55 months) and 6~274 months(median 57 months) respectively.Repeated renal biopsy in 7 patients (2 in NS group and 5 in non-NS group) after relapsing showed no histological transformation in the NS group,while all five patients in the non-NS group showed histological transformation (2 to class Ⅲ,one to class Ⅳ,Ⅴ and Ⅴ+Ⅳ respectively). Conclusion:Our data demonstrate that the nephrotic class Ⅱ LN is a podocyte disease which should be differentiated from the class Ⅱ LN with mesangial proliferation.Further studies are needed to explore the pathogenesis of podocyte injury in SLE.",

        "abstract": "Background:  Peak oxygen consumption or ventilator efficiency, which can better provide prognostic information in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) remains controversial, and studies showed circulatory power and ventilatory power were both variables predictive of prognosis in patients with left heart failure. This study was aimed to assess whether circulatory power and ventilatory power were also variables predictive of prognosis in patients with IPAH, and whether a new variable that was defined as peak oxygen consumption (peak VO 2 ) divided by minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production at anaerobic threshold (VE/VCO 2 @AT), which we labeled cardiopulmonary fitness index, can better predict prognosis in patients with IPAH.   Methods:  Patients with newly diagnosed IPAH underwent symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing from 1 January 2011 to 1 January 2014 in Fuwai hospital and were followed for up to 66 months for major cardiac events (mortality and lung transplantation). Prognostic value was assessed by survival curves (Kaplan-Meier method) and uni- and multivariate Cox analyses.   Results:  One hundred forty-two patients with IPAH (105 female, mean age, 33±11years) were studied. During follow-up (mean: 43±14 months), 25 patients died and 1 patient underwent lung transplantation. In a univariate analysis, peak VO 2 , VO 2 @AT , VE/VCO 2 @AT, cardiopulmonary fitness index , circulatory power, ventilatory power, peak heart rate , NT-ProBNP, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), cardiac index (CI ) , WHO functional class were all predictive of cardiac events (all  P 0.05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only NT-ProBNP and cardiopulmonary fitness index were the indicators of prognosis (chi-square=7.51,  P =0.006; chi-square=7.26,  P =0.007, respectively).The mortality rates of 1- , 2- and 3-year for patients with cardiopulmonary fitness index≤0.29 mL·kg –1 ·min –1  were 8.3%, 16.6% and 23.3% respectively.   Conclusions:  Cardiopulmonary fitness index, rather than circulatory power or ventilatory power provides prognostic information in patients with IPAH.   ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02061787.",

And the features of onset, clinical and laboratory characteristics, imaging tests and causes of misdiagnosis were analyzed.There were 12 males and 10 females with an average age of (36.2 ± 14.2) years. And 12 (54.5%) PE patients had concurrent deep venous thrombosis. Antiphospholipid syndrome and Behcet's disease were the major causes of connective tissue disease. Chest distress, palpitation and extremity swelling were initial symptoms. There were elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (n = 11, 50.0%), elevated C-reactive protein (n = 8, 36.4%) and abnormal autoantibody (n = 15, 68.2%) respectively. Computed tomography showed pulmonary arteries stenosis, occlusion and aneurismal dilation. Eighteen (81.8%) patients had pulmonary hypertension with a systolic pulmonary pressure of (72 ± 20) mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa). And 3 of them presented severity of pulmonary pressure non-matched to the degree of pulmonary vascular involvement. And 18 (81.8%) patients with connective tissue disease were missed due to a lack of typical symptoms and physician understanding of disease before admission. Three (13.6%) patients had a misdiagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. The median time of diagnosis was 12 months.Connective tissue disease may develop PE as the initial symptom. And some patients lack typical clinical manifestations of connective tissue disease. It should raise an alert with the physicians.",

        "abstract": "Background: Community based cervical cancer screening models using self-collection can effectively place the identification of who is positive in the hands of the patient. The key areas we have identified as critical are 1) education, 2) notification of screening opportunities, 3) registration, 4) submission of samples, 5) receiving results with an explanation, and 6) being advised where to receive evaluation and management from qualified healthcare personnel. Methods: Our primary objectives were to create, register, and pilot a website as a public platform for cervical cancer prevention for both city and rural, individual and organizational application. We selected two sites: Shenzhen City in China as the local city (individual participant) site, and Sangzhi County in Hunan Province as the remote (group management) site. The website was reviewable to all of China, but applications for screening and registration were open only to the women from the 2 pilot sites. In the local site, the women would first sign up (obtain a password) to view the website (www.mcareu.com), and then if they desired, they could register for screening using their true name and their state ID. After an offline confirmation of the address, the sampling kit would arrive. Results were available with additional education and guidance for care also on the website. Findings: 120,099 people nationwide visited the website in 27 months by the end of May, 2015, 1148 women from the sites registered at the website and 87.5% enrolled in the pilot trial. 72.3% of those testing positive returned for management. Virtually 100% of the registration/historical information was entered appropriately and 100% of the samples were handled properly. Interpretation: Web-based decision aids help patients through the uncertainties of healthcare. Applied to cervical cancer screening using self-collection, the effectiveness of the model specifically in respect to accessibility, education, registration, data input, and instructions for positive management was clearly demonstrated by this pilot as well as the potential for future diagnostics applicable to self-collection.",

        "abstract": "C3aR is a receptor of anaphylatoxin C3a and have been reported associated with inflammation disease.Kidney samples were obtained from db/db mice and their db/m littermates at the age of 4,8,12,16 and 20 weeks.The expression of C3aR was assessed by RT-PCR,Western blotting and immunohistochemistry,and then correlated with biochemical and histological indices of kidney injury.No significant difference of C3aR expression was found in the kidney of db/db mice as compared with the control db/m mice at the age of 4 weeks,a time when all biochemical and histological indices indicated that the mice were in pre-diabetic condition.However,with the development of obesity,hyperglycemia and proteinuria,the renal expression of C3aR in the db/db mice increased as compared with the db/m mice of the same age.Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that C3aR protein distributed specifically in renal epithelial cells,including tubular epithelial cells,glomerular podocytes and parietal epithelial cells both in db/m and db/db mice.Much more intensity of C3aR immunohistochemical staining was found in the epithelial cells of proximal tubule which just located at the intermedial of cortex and medulla.In the glomerulus,C3aR was found distributed specifically in the podocytes position and no C3aR staining was found in the mesangial and endothelial cells.In diabetic db/db mice,the increased expression of C3aR was found mainly in proximal tubule and podocytes.Interestingly,serious vacuolar degeneration was often observed in tubular cells with higher intenstity of C3aR immunohistochemical staining.All these suggested that C3aR might have something to do with the initiation or/and development of diabetic nephropathy,especially in the pathogenesis of tubular cells and podocytes.",

Methodology:A twenty-nine aged female patient who had quickly allograft disfunction after renal transplantation(RT) was studied retrospectively.She received three consecutive biopsies on 12th day,30th day and 4.5 month after RT.According to the protocol we collected the blood samples at pre-RT and 7th day,1.5 month after RT,and before every biopsy for detecting her FLOW-PRA,AECA and anti-MICA antibody.The patients' MICA genotype and the anti-MICA antibody genotype were also detected at the same six time point. Results:The FLOW-PRA and AECA were negetive at the six time point.The anti-MICA antibody was also negetive at pre-RT,7th day post-RT and before the first biopsy.While it turned to be positive before the second biopsy.The MICA genotype of donor was MICA002/02,MICA008,and the genotype of recipient was MICA010,MICA010.The genotype of anti-MICA antibody was to aim directly at MICA02,MICA19,and MICA07.The recipient had the donor special anti-MICA02 antibody.The first biopsy showed that the patient had untypical acute humoral rejection and C4d deposition was negative in peritubular capillary(PTC).The second the patient had typical acute humoral rejection and C4d deposition was positive in PTC.The patient was administrated prednisolone pulse therapy combined with the immunosuppressive protocol including tacrolimus,MMF,prednisone and Tripterygium wilfordii(TW),and her acute rejection was reversed.The level of serum creatinine decreased to normal range.The repeat renal biopsy showed no pathological features of acute humoral rejection,and C4d deposition in PTC turned to be negative. Conclusion:The donor special anti-MICA antibody could mediate acute humoral rejection.The regime of prednisolone pulse therapy combined with the immunosuppressive protocol(tacrolimus,MMF,prednisone and TW) could reverse the donor special anti-MICA antibody mediated acute humoral rejection.",

Methodology:A retrospective analysis was carried out in three posttransplant recurrent FSGS patients.The renal biopsy of native,donor and allograft were performed to evaluated histopathologic features.The clinical and laboratory data,and response to treatment were recorded in detail. Results:(1)There were one male and two females.Their onset ages were 17,23,and 40 yrs.The levels of 24h urinary proteinuria excretion as native renal biopsy were 7.55,10.5 and 14.26 g/24h.The levels of serum creatinine were 99,105.2 and 265.2 μmol/L.The time of progression to ESRD were 4,2 and 4yrs,respectively.(2)Proportion of glomerular/segmental sclerosing lesions were 5.30%/42.1%,0/6.90% and 40%/33.3%,acute/chronic tubulointerstitial lesion were 0/10%,10%/0 and 10%/30%.We observed the diffuse foot process effacement(>50%) by electron microscopy in case 2 and 3 of native renal biopsy,while no tissue for TEM in case 3.FSGS variants in native kidneys were cellular,tip lesion,and cellular type,respectively.(3)Proteinuria occurred at 10 and 40 days after transplantation in case 1 and 2(18.3 and 7.55g/24h),3 cases were diagnozed recurrent FSGS at 130,67 and 70 days after transplantation.The levels of 24h urinary proteinuria excretion were 10.1,15.8,and 4.38g/24h.The levels of serum creatinine were 114.0 μmol/L,484.4 μmol/L and 701.8 μmol/L..(4) Early graft biopsies might show normal appearing glomeruli by light microscopy but diffuse foot process effacement by electron microscopy.Segmental sclerosing lesions may occur later in repeated renal biopsy,with acute tubulointerstitial lesion;FSGS variants in graft kidneys are cellular,collapsing,cellular,respectively.(5) Case 1 was treated with 5 cycles of plasmapheresis,and achieved a partial remission;case 2 was received with 5 cycles of immunoadsorption,achieved no remission,and progressed to ESRD at 3 months after transplantation.Case 3 lost follow-up. Conclusion:Proteinuria and renal dysfunction were noticeable clinical manifestations in recurrent FSGS after renal transplantation.In patients with recurrent proteinuria,early graft biopsies may be normal appearing glomeruli by light microscopy,but diffuse foot process effacement by electron microscopy,and segmental sclerosing lesions in repeat biopsy later.FSGS variants in graft kidneys may be same with or different from native kidney.",

        "abstract": "Lupus nephritis (LN) is a clinical heterogeneous autoimmune disease and genetic factors contribute to the development of LN. One of the most striking characteristics in LN is the high prevalence among childbearing women, as well as that its clinical manifestation differs in women and men, suggesting the role of sex hormones in its pathogenesis.The PvuII and XbaI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of estrogen receptor (ER) gene were analyzed in 245 biopsy-proven LN patients (58 males and 187 females) and 172 normal controls (101 males and 71 females) by PCR-RFLP. The clinical and pathological features of 49 male and 152 female LN patients with different genotypes were analyzed.It was found that genotype PpXx, ppxx and Ppxx were three major genotypes of ER gene in both of lupus patients and control groups. The distribution of ER gene polymorphism was quite different in lupus patients of different genders. The frequency of the PpXx genotype in male LN patients was significantly higher than both the gender matched normal controls (p < 0.05) and the female LN patients (p < 0.05), while no difference was shown in the frequency of PpXx genotype between female LN patients and gender matched controls. Interestingly, skin rashes and arthritis were found more common in the patients with PpXx genotype. The frequency of hematological abnormalities and hypertension were higher in patients with ppxx genotype (p < 0.05), while capillary thrombi and glomerular sclerosis were more frequently complicated in the patients with ppxx genotype. In addition, the renal vasculitis and interstitial injury were more frequent in those with Ppxx genotype (p < 0.01).The distribution of ER gene polymorphism in LN patients is distinct with different gender. The PpXx genotype of ER gene may be associated with the susceptibility of SLE in male. ER gene polymorphism is probably one of the genetic factors contributing to the development of clinical heterogeneity and sexually dimorphic manifestations of LN.",

        "abstract": "The kinetics and electron transfer of the photo-degradation procedure of five azo compounds, mainly DBC-carboxyazo, on the surface of titanium dioxide were studied by using UV-Vis absorption and differential spectra. An intermediate with rather long life(t 1/2 = 8, 86 min) formed and then destructed during the procedure of the capture of the photo-induced charge-carrier. The theoretically fit peak-shape curve of the intermediate with error-compensated algorithm parallel accorded with the experimental c∼t curve. Thus we have got the rate constants of DBC-carboxyazo and TBC-CPA at 25 °C, being 0. 170(k 1/min -1) and 2, 96 × 10 -2(k 2/min -1) as well as 0. 104 (k 1/min -1) and 9. 56 × 10 -2 (k 2/min -1), respectively. The effect of the initial pH value on the photo-degradation rate was tested. pH 3-7 was found to be the optimal pH range for the photo-degradation. In addition, the reaction solution without being buffered was found to tend to be weak acidic. The sensitization mechanism of TiO 2 by azo was discussed. That is, electrons transferred from the excited azo to the conductive band of semiconductor TiO 2, which made the bandgap energy match the energy of visible light. The degradation course was presumed as that, after the electron injection and the self-oxidaiton of azo, the intermediate naphthoquinone was oxidized by O ̇- 2 to produce phthalic acid, followed by the final mineralization of the phthalic acid to yield CO 2, H 2O and other inorganic compounds.",

Inclusion criteria and statistical analysis were similar to the Oxford study.Histologic findings of mesangial hypercellularity score, endocapillary proliferation, segmental sclerosis or adhesion, crescents, necrosis, and tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis. Clinical features, blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), proteinuria, and treatment modalities.Time to a 50% reduction in eGFR or end-stage renal disease (the combined event); the rate of eGFR decline (slope of eGFR); proteinuria during follow-up.Compared with the Oxford cohort, the Chinese cohort had a lower proportion of patients with mesangial hypercellularity (43%) and endocapillary proliferation (11%), higher proportion with segmental sclerosis or adhesion (83%) and necrosis (15%), and similar proportion with crescents (48%) and tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis (moderate, 24%; severe, 3.3%). During a median follow-up of 53 (25th-75th percentile, 36-67) months, 159 (15.5%) patients reached the combined event.

This study reports a facile  in-situ  polymerization process to approach molecular mixing level of poly (vinylidene fluoride-hexa-fluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) and the fully aromatic single-ion conducting polymer ( fa -SIPE). The molecular level mixing is greatly beneficial for promoting both macro and nanophase separation between the flexible aliphatic PVDF-HFP and the aromatic  fa -SIPE. These occur because of the poor physical compatibility of the two polymers and leads to a macro/nano porous single-ion polymer electrolyte (SIPE). Filling the porosity with a Li + -ion coordinating solvent enables high Li + -ion mobility, which is favorable for the development of high power and fast charge LIBs. Remarkably, the highly porous SIPE membrane displays high mechanical stability, high electrolyte wettability and strong thermal dimensional stability, all possibly contributing to excellent stability and reliability of LiBs. This study provides an efficient way of fabricating porous, single-ion polymer electrolyte for LIBs application.",

An altered ratio of their relative expression promotes the pathogenesis of certain immunological diseases, but whether this may also contribute to the pathogenesis of antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) versus T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) is unknown. Here, we characterized the intragraft expression of T-bet and GATA3 and determined the correlation of their levels with the presence of typical lesions of ABMR and TCMR. We found a predominant intraglomerular expression of T-bet in patients with ABMR, which was distinct from that in patients with TCMR. In ABMR, interstitial T-bet expression was typically located in peritubular capillaries, although the overall quantity of interstitial T-bet was less than that observed in TCMR. The expression of intraglomerular T-bet correlated with infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, which express T-bet, as well as intraglomerular CD68+ monocyte/macrophages, which do not express T-bet. The predominance of intraglomerular T-bet expression relative to GATA3 expression associated with poor response to treatment with bolus steroid. In summary, predominance of intraglomerular T-bet expression correlates with antibody-mediated rejection and resistance to steroid treatment.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To explore the therapeutic effect and mechanism of triptolide on membranous neph ropathy using passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) in rats. Methodology: Passive Heymann nephritis was induced in SD rats using rabbit antiserum against FxIA antigen. SD rats were divided into three groups, including normal controls, PHN rats with or without treatment with triptolide. PHN rats were administrated orally with triptolide (200 μg/kg per day). After the treatment with triptolid e for 7, 14, 21 and 28 days,the 24hr urine and blood were collected to examine the levels of proteinuria, serum albumin, aminotransferases, serum creatinine an d white blood cell counts. The renal tissue was processed for the examinations o f light microscopy, electron microscopy, immunefluorescene and immune electron m icroscopy. The deposition of IgG and C5b-9 along capillary wall was observed. T he distribution of nephrin and podocin as the expression of slit diaphragm prote ins was also determined. Results: (1) Urinary protein: Triptolide could significantly reduce proteinuria in rats with passive Heymann nephritis. This effect could be seen at day 7 after the tre atment and got more prominent at day 14 and persistent on day 21 and 28. At the same time, the plasma albumin was also significantly increased(P<0.01). ( 2) Subepithelial immune deposits: The examination of electron microscopy showed that the subepithelial immune deposits, spikes formation and basement membrane proliferation were improved after treatment with triptolide. The subepithelial i mmune deposits decreased and the reaction of basement membrane was also ameliora ted. However, the subepithelial immune deposits still existed although the urina ry protein decreased significantly. (3) Glomerular deposition of IgG and C5b-9: The immunefluorescene observation indicated that the deposition of IgG and C5b -9 decreased after treatment with triptolide. Compared with Heymann nephritis, the intensity of fluorescene decreased, especially after treatment with triptoli de for 7 days. (4) Injuries on podocytes: After treatment with triptolide for 7, 14, 21 and 24 days, the injuries on foot process of podocyte were recovered com pared with that in Heymann nephritis. The effacement of the podocyte foot proces ses was improved. The mean width of foot processes was decreased. Most foot proc esses was restored to normal shape after treatment with triptolide for 28 days. (5) Change of slit diaphragm related protein: After treatment with triptolide fo r 7 days, the expression of nephrin and podocin was significantly increased comp ared with that in Heymann nephritis. The abnormal distribution of nephrin and po docin started to be corrected. After treatment with triptolide for 21 days, the expression of nephrin and podocin was mostly restored to normal continuous linea r expression. The immune electron microscopy confirmed the therapeutic effect of triptolide on the restoration of nephrin expression. Conclusion: Triptolide could effectively reduce proteinuria and alleviate the glomerular imm une injuries, and also remarkably improve the podocyte lesion and help to restor e the normal structure of slit diaphragm. In addition to its immunosuppression a nd anti-inflammation activity, the therapeutic effect of triptolide might be du e to its direct activity on the treatment with podocyte injuries.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To analyze the characteristics of anemia in patients with diabetic nephropathy(DN)and its relevant factors.Methodology:Two hundred and thirty five patients with DN who had been diagnosed by clinical information and renal biopsy were enrolled.The incidence and character of anemia was investigated,and the relationship between anemia and tubular function,serum creatinine,cystatin C,metabolism and other vascular complications was also analyzed.Results:In 235 cases of DN,the incidence of anemia was 43.8%.Anemia could be seen in some patients with normal serum creatinine.Most were normocyte and normochromic.Riboflavine-binding protein(RBP),N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase(NAG)and hemoglobin in patients with DN had a negative correlation(r=-0.310,-0.353,P<0.01).Tubulointerstitial damage had existed in most patients with anemia before eGFR began to decline.When renal function was normal,tubulointerstitial damage was more severe in patients with anemia than in those without anemia.The level of hemoglobin had a positive correlation with eGFR(r=0.398,P<0.01)and cystatin C(r=0.578,P<0.01).The anemia had been present before eGFR began to decline.Tubulointerstitial damage was more severe in patients with elevated cystatin C than those with normal cystatin C.Insulin and C peptide were higher in non-anemia group.Triglyceride was higher in non-anemia group than that in anemia.HDL-cholesterol was higher in anemia group.The hemoglobin was positively correlated with serum albumin(r=0.504,P<0.05)and prealbumin(r=0.282,P<0.05).Body mass index was higher in non-anemia group.Retinopathy and angiocardiopathy had a higher percentage in patients with anemia than that in patients without anemia(P<0.01).Conclusion:The incidence of anemia is high and anemia could occur at early stage in DN patients,which is associated closely with tubulointerstitial damage.Anemia could present before eGFR declined,which is not only associated with renal function,but also with metabolism abnormality and nutrition state in DN patients.So anemia is a risk factor of other types of vascular complications in DN patients.",

Mice diabetic nephropathy related genes (and ESTs) were found out. A 1.7 kb cDNA was amplified and cloned by using RACE method, based on the sequence of EST. Homologous analysis of the sequence was carried out. And the result shows that it is part of mouse expression sequence AL023001, which function is unknown. To further investigate the relationship between AL023001 and diabetic nephropathy, the function of AL023001, expression levels of AL023001 were analyzed quantitatively using RT-PCR method. Result of RT-PCR shows that AL023001 is expressed differentially in liver, muscle, brain and fat, while the expression pattern of AL023001 in kidney is just like that revealed by gene chip. These results suggest that AL023001 is related to mice diabetic nephropathy, though its function and possible role played in the development of mice diabetic nephropathy still to be investigated.",

In recent years,MMF dispersible tablet has been produced by Hangzhou zhonmei Huadong Pharmaceutical Co.,Ltd. In this study,we looked into the pharmacokinetics characteristics and adverse events of MMF dispersible tablet prospectively. Methodology:Ten patients with Class IV lupus nephritis were enrolled in this study. They were 3 males and 7 females,with an average age of (25.0±8.4) years old. They had nomal renal function with an average serum creatinine of (62.8±22.1) μmol/L. MMF was given at 0.75 g,q12 h. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group 1 was administered MMF alone,and Group 2 was administered MMF with meals. The blood samples were collected after one week,and then patients changed their medication method. MPA AUC0-12 h was calculated with direct calculation and limited sampling strategy. Results:(1) Tmax,Cmax and AUC0-12 h of MMF tablets were (0.57±0.26) h,(16.1±5.30) mg/L and (34.5±8.89) mg·hr/L in the fasting state,and (0.87±0.42) h,(11.0±4.41) mg/L and (32.1±9.82) mg·h/L in the fed state. (2) The average value of Cmax dropped by 31.5%(P<0.05),while AUC0-12 h decline by 7.2%(P>0.05),and Tmax extented by 52.6%(P>0.05) in the fed sate. (3) There was no difference between MPA AUC0-12 h calculated with standard method and limited sampling strategy [(33.3±9.21) mg·hr/L vs (34.1±8.39) mg·hr/L]. Their correlation coefficient reached 0.94(P<0.05). (4) Gastro-intestinal symptoms emerged in the fasting state and alleviated when fed in 2 cases. Conclusion:Compared with the fasting state,Cmax decreases significantly when MMF was given with food. The gastrointestinal events were also alleviated in the fed state. In addition,no difference being presented between limited sampling strategy and standard method,suggesting that limited sampling strategy is still suitable for the MPA AUC calculation of MMF dispersible tablets.",

As a major part of lithium batteries, the separator plays a critical role in the development of high-voltage lithium batteries. Herein, we demonstrated a sustainable and superior heat-resistant alginate nonwoven separator for high-voltage (5 V) lithium batteries. It was demonstrated that the resultant alginate nonwoven separator exhibited better mechanical property (37 MPa), superior thermal stability (up to 150 °C), and higher ionic conductivity (1.4 × 10 S/cm) as compared to commercially available polyolefin (PP) separator. More impressively, the 5 V class LiNiMnO (LNMO)/Li cell with this alginate nonwoven separator delivered much better cycling stability (maintaining 79.6% of its initial discharge capacity) than that (69.3%) of PP separator after 200 cycles at an elevated temperature of 55 °C. In addition, the LiFePO/Li cell assembled with such alginate nonwoven separator could still charge and discharge normally even at an elevated temperature of 150 °C. The above-mentioned fascinating characteristics of alginate separator provide great probability for its application for high-voltage (5 V) lithium batteries at elevated temperatures.",

The retrospective analysis was made on the clinical and pathological data of different subtypes of IgAN. Results:In I-H, there was only microscopic hematuria (110±100)×10~4/ml, without hypertension, anemia and renal insufficiency. The incidence of chronic histological lesions was lower. In U-ab, there were both microscopic Hematuria (98±195)×10~4/ml and proteinuria (0.80±0.57)g/24h. 5.8 of patients were chronic renal insufficiency, and 23 were various degrees of renal interstitial fibrosis. In R-GH patients, the incidence of tonsillitis was 15.4, which significantly higher than that in other patterns (P<0.05). The count of urine red blood cells during the interval stage of gross hematuria were (214±336)×10~4/ml. In Cres. cases, urine red blood cells count (405±485)×10~4/ml ranked the highest, 21.1 of cases with mass proteinuria, 17.5 with increasing serum creatinine, and 31.5 with anemia. The incidence of cellular crescents and segmental necrosis was 50.9, which was more than that in any other patterns. In MP subtype, the mean of urinary protein excretion was (3.93±2.68)g/24h, associated with hypoalbuminaemia (29.1±6.8)g/L and hyperlipidaemia (6.99±2.67)mmol/L. Furthermore, the urine C3 and NAG was also increased significantly. In HT patients, the incidence of low molecular weight proteinuria reached 10.8, with hypotonic urine. The rate of renal insufficiency was high to 54.4, and the proportion of global sclerosis was (24.3±23.2). The ESRD subtype was a terminal condition of various subtypes of development, who needed replacement therapy. Conclusion:IgAN is a clinical syndrome with similar immunopathological features as well as different pathophysiological mechanisms. The different treatment in different subtypes of IgAN will improve the effect of treatment, and deepen the understanding of the nature of IgAN.",

This study was designed to investigate the long-term renal outcome of adult APIGN.A total of 64 adults with APIGN were identified and divided into two groups: acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) group and acute nonstreptococcal postinfectious glomerulonephritis (nonstreptococcal APIGN) group. For the purpose of outcome analysis, 49 patients with a follow-up of ≥ 12 months were included. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for prognostic factors.Nephrotic syndrome was more frequently seen in nonstreptococcal APIGN patients. At the time of biopsy, the mean proteinuria of the two groups was 1.82 ± 2.14 and 4.21 ± 4.39 g/d, respectively (p = 0.005). There was no significant difference between the two groups on microscopy. Among the 49 patients with ≥ 12 months of follow-up, the complete remission rate was 85.7%, and the incidence of chronic renal failure and endstage renal disease (ESRD) was 6.1% and 4.1%, respectively. The complete remission rate of the APSGN group was higher than that of the nonstreptococcal APIGN group. Univariate analysis showed that the prognostic factors were age, underlying disease, proteinuria, tubular damage and C1q deposits. In multivariate analysis, underlying disease was the only significant and independent inverse correlate of complete remission.The long-term prognosis for young Chinese adults with APIGN is optimistic if there is no underlying disease. The renal outcome for patients with APSGN is better than for patients with nonstreptococcal APIGN.",

Methods Because of abdominal distention,9 patients with ascites were diagnosed as adenocarcinoma. They were all under chemotherapy after exploratory laparotomy. There were ascites in all 9 patients,dispersed in tumour nodules; 6 patients' ovaries were normal size and smooth surface;3 patients'ovaries were bigger than normal,had coarse small nodules in surface; big omental tumour was distracted in all patients;5 patients appeared diffuse infiltration of small nodular,tumour infiltration of 4 patients formed big omental laminar structure. According lesions to choose different surgical methods,after removed hole uterus,bilateral adnexa,and big omental,eliminated tumour nodules which diameter was more than 1.0cm. Used electrocoagulation to clear up the small nodules which can't clear up in elimination. 2 patients were under pelvic lymphadenectomy,used partial left hemi-colectomy in one patient. Affused cisplatin into abdomen before it sew up. Chemotherapy by PCor PAC for 8 periods of treatment after surgery. Results 5 patients were middle differentiation and 4 patients were low differentiation in pathological test. All patients didn't appear infiltration of tumour in uterus endom,6 patients' ovaries were normal structure,one patient appeared ovarian epicutiula tumour organic infiltration. One patient was dead in one month after surgery. One patient was in-sensitive to chemotherapy,his ascites was out of control,was dead in two months after surgery. 2 patients' tumour relapsed respectively in 6 months and 8 months after surgery,and it caused ileus,but they were dead respectively in 3 months and 5 months after removing again surgery:2 patients' relapsed respectively in 10 months and 14 months after surgery,they refused treatment and lost vistation. 2 patients lost visitation:only one Ⅲb patient lived for four years without tumour. Conclusion Surgery is preferred for treating EPSPC,and it is useful for EPSPC diagnosis. The principle of EPSPC surgery is cytoreduction,it is same with ovarian cancer surgery. After surgery,assisted canonical chemotherapy. It is useful to delay live time and reduce relapse rate.",

        "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the value of liquid-based cytology test (LCT) combined with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) testing in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III (CIN III) after large-loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) during follow-up. Methods: Clinical analysis was used to investigate 567 patients diagnosed with CIN III and treated with LLETZ from May 2003 to May 2009 at Peking University Shenzhen Hospital. The patients were enrolled in a follow-up program set at 3 months, 6 months, and every 6 to 12 months. LCT and HR-HPV testing were used as monitoring indicators to evaluate HR-HPV testing after LLETZ during follow-up. Results: 1)The residual lesion predicting capacity of postoperative LCT obtained the following: sensitivity, 60%: specificity, 88.15%: positive predictive value, 8.30%; and negative predictive value, 99.19%. The residual lesion predicting capacity of HPV testing obtained the following: sensitivity, 100%: specificity, 85.64%: positive predictive value, 11.11%; and negative predictive value, 100%. The recurrent lesion predicting capacity of postoperative LCT obtained the following: sensitivity, 63.64%; specificity, 92.27%; positive predictive value, 14.00%; and negative predictive value, 99.23%. The recurrent lesion predicting capacity of HPV testing obtained the following: sensitivity, 72.73%; specificity 85.97%; positive predictive value 9.30%; and negative predictive value, 99.38%. 2)The recurrent lesion rate was higher in postoperative persistent HPV infection patients than in non-postoperative persistent HPV infection patients , Ther were statistically significant differences between the persistent negative and non-testing preoperative group (P<0.05). The recurrence rate was higher in persistent HPV-positive and HPV-re-infected patients than in the negative conversion group, whereas no recurrent lesion was found in persistent HPV-negative patients. Conclusion: Results showed the importance of predicting residual and recurrent lesions by LCT and HR-HPV testing, which were also confirmed to be effective methods in follow up. Postoperative persistent HPV-positive status is associated with recurrence and requires consistent follow-up.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To explore the risks factors of podocyte lesion in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy(DN),and the relationship between podocyte lesion and the progression of renal function.Methodology:A retrospective study was performed in twenty four patients with biopsy-proven DN,they were followed for at least 3 years.Podocyte density was detected with immunofluorescence double-staining using anti-GLEPP1,a marker of podocyte,and anti-type Ⅳcollagen a3 chain.The stained sections were examined by the confocal microscopy and the density of podocyte per glomerulus was calculated using specific software.The rate of decline in creatinine clearance rate(ml/min)over at least 3 years was quantified through Cockroft-Gault formula.Results:(1)Comparing with normal control subjects,significantly decreased podocyte density per glomerulus was observed in patients with DN.(2)Reduced podocyte density was strongly associated with body mass index and increased total cholesterol(r=-0.486,P<0.05;r=-0.438,P<0.05).Bad serum glucose control for a long time(glycosylated hemoglobin>7%)contributed to a lower podocyte density compared with subjects under better glucose control(glycosylated hemoglobin <7%)(P<0.05,ANOVA).(3)There was a strong correlation between the reduced podocyte density and the degree of proteinuria(r=-0.529,P<0.01).Furthermore,stepwise linear regression showed that podocyte density was the strongest predictor of proteinuria in patients with DN.(4)In the subsequent longitudinal study,although all the subjects were under satisfactory metabolic control,there were significant differences in proteinuria and podocyte density at the time of biopsy between DN patients with or without progressive renal failure.(5)Reduced podocyte density was strongly related to the rate of creatinine clearance decline(r=0.424,P<0.05).In addition,durations of diabetes(r=-0.614,P<0.05)and degree of proteinuria(r=-0.668,P<0.01)also correlated with the rate of decline in renal function.Conclusion:Podocyte density reduction was observed in patients with DN.The changes of podocyte may contribute to increasing proteinuria,and be significantly related to the progression of renal function in patients with DN.Metabolic disorders may be partly responsible for the development of podocyte lesions in DN.",

        "abstract": "Pulmonary angiography is widely performed in pulmonary hypertension patients, but its immediate effects on right heart hemodynamics and safety are not well known. The objective of this study was to investigate the right heart hemodynamic effects and safety of pulmonary angiography in Chinese patients with pulmonary hypertension.Between January 2008 and June 2009, pulmonary hypertension patients undergoing pulmonary angiography were consecutively enrolled. Pulmonary angiography was performed during breath-holding after deep breathing. The baseline clinical data, hemodynamic measurements before and after pulmonary angiography and complications occurring within 48 hours after angiography were recorded.Ninety-five patients were included. All received non-ionic contrast medium with a volume of (75.7 ± 29.8) ml. Angiography reduced heart rate in patients with baseline mean pulmonary arterial pressure ≥ 60 mmHg (change of heart rate: (-3.1 ± 7.0) beats/min, P = 0.005), increased mean right atrial pressure, diastolic and end-diastolic right ventricular pressure in patients with baseline mean pulmonary arterial pressure < 60 mmHg (all P < 0.05). Patients with decreased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (change of mean pulmonary arterial pressure ≤ -10 mmHg) had the highest total pulmonary resistance (P = 0.009 vs. no change in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (change of mean pulmonary arterial pressure, -10 mmHg to 10 mmHg); P = 0.03 vs. increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (change of mean pulmonary arterial pressure ≥ 10 mmHg)) and the lowest cardiac output (P = 0.018 vs. no change in mean pulmonary arterial pressure; P = 0.013 vs. increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure). There were 7 complications (7%), with 6 related to catheter and only 1 directly related to angiography. All complications were mild and no death occurred.Pulmonary angiography has minimal effect on right heart hemodynamics and is safe in pulmonary hypertension patients.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effects of inflammation cytokines, (FK506) and cyclosporine (CSA) on albumin secretion, and the effects of FK506 and CSA on the IL-6 induced suppression of albumin synthesis in cultured human hepatocytes.Human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2 cells) were separately cultured with IL-6, IL-2 and IL-10 (0 approximately 10 microg/L) and FK506, CSA (0 approximately 100 microg/L) for 48 h. In another experiment, HepG2 cells were stimulated with different doses of FK506 and CSA (0 approximately 10 microg/L) in the presence of IL-6 (5 microg/L) for 48 h. Albumin levels in the supernatant of all groups were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The concentration of LDH secreted by cells stimulated with FK506 and CSA were detected with spectrophotometry.For cultured HepG2 cells, IL-6 significantly decreased albumin levels in a dose-dependent manner (P <0.01), and the maximal inhibition occurred at 5 microg/L. CSA mildly decreased albumin levels and a significant reduction in albumin production was first visible at 10 microg/ L (P <0.05). In contrast, IL-2, IL-10 and FK506 did not significantly influence albumin pro- duction (P > 0.05). FK506 obviously decreased LDH levels in the supernatant (P < 0.05) and attenuated IL-6 induced suppression of albumin synthesis (P < 0.01). But CSA slightly increased LDH concentration and could not block the IL-6 induced decrease of albumin synthesis (P > 0.05).IL-6 but not IL-2 and IL-10 suppressed the production of hepatic albumin in vitro. FK506 protected against the suppression of hepatic albumin synthesis caused by IL-6, suggesting its potential role in improving hypoalbuminaemia in immune glomerulonephritis.",

Fifty-four patients underwent tonsillectomy and 58 patients did not. The clinical remission rate during follow-up and variables to predict clinical remission were estimated by chi2 test and multivariate Cox regression analysis; renal survival was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.Up to 2006, the follow-up period lasted 130 +/- 50.3 months (60-276 months). The clinical remission rate was 46.3% in patients with tonsillectomy and 27.6% in those without tonsillectomy during follow-up. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that tonsillectomy was not an independent impact factor for renal clinical remission (p = 0.386). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, there was no significant difference in renal survival rate between patients with tonsillectomy and those without tonsillectomy (p = 0.059).The clinical remission rate in IgAN patients with tonsillectomy was higher than that in patients without tonsillectomy during follow-up. But within 130 months, it was difficult to find statistical difference in renal survival between IgAN patients with and without tonsillectomy.",

Methodology:Sixty non-diabetic patients with early chronic renal failure (serum creatinine level of 1.3~3.0 mg/dl) were divided into two groups. They were group 1, treatment group (n=30), treated with low-protein flour (protein 0.9,344 Kcal/100g) as staple food, and group 2, control group (n=30), with common rice or flour as staple food. All of patients were observed for 6 months, the suggested diet protein intake (DPI) was 0.6 g/(kg·d),energy intake was 30~35 Kcal/(kg·d) (according to optimal body weight). Somatometric index and serum chemistry was measured. 24 hour urine was collected for the calculation of DPI. GFR was calculated with simplified MDRD equation. Results: (1) Compliance of patients: there were 5 cases withdrawal from treatment group, and also 5 cases withdrawal from control group. There were 25 patients completed the observation in each group, the calculated DPI was (0.63±0.04) g/(kg·d) in control and (0.61±0.02) g/(kg·d) in treatment group. (2)Body weight, body mass index (BMI), arm middle circumference (AMC) and arm circumference (AC) were not significantly changed in both groups. (3)The levels of serum total protein, albumin and prealbumin were slightly decreased in control group (P>0.05), while those nutritional makers maintained stable in treatment group. (4)BUN was not significantly changed in control group but markedly decreased in treatment group (P<0.01). The level of serum creatinine (SCr) was significantly increased in control group in the 2~ nd and 4~ th month (P<0.05), but decreased to baseline in the 6~ th month, while it was significantly decreased (P<0.05) in treatment group. GFR was decreased in control group in the 2~ nd and 4~ th month (P<0.05) but elevated to baseline in the 6~ th month, while it was significantly increased in treatment group (P<0.05). The decreasing rate of GFR were -0.31 (ml/min·1.73m~2)/month in treatment group and 0.28 (ml/min·1.73m~2 )/month in control group. (5)The level of urinary protein excretion was decreased (P<0.05) in treatment group but unchanged in control group, it was decreased to normal range in 7/13(53.8)cases in treatment group, 4/15(26.7)cases in control group (P>0.05). Conclusion:This six-month study indicated that, LPD with low-protein flour was much better tolerated than the common LPD, and it could delay the progression of renal dysfunction and maintain the nutritional status in patients with early chronic renal failure.",

        "abstract": "A pure calcium borate Ca 2 [B 2 O 4 (OH) 2 ]·0.5H 2 O has been synthesized under hydrothermal condition and characterized by XRD, FT-IR and TG as well as by chemical analysis. The molar enthalpy of solution of Ca 2 [B 2 O 4 (OH) 2 ]·0.5H 2 O in HC1·54.582H 2 O was determined. From a combination of this result with measured enthalpies of solution of H 3 BO 3 in HC1·54.561H 2 O and of CaO in (HCl + H 3 BO 3 ) solution, together with the standard molar enthalpies of formation of CaO(s), H 3 BO 3 (s) and H 2 O(l), the standard molar enthalpy of formation of −(3172.5 ± 2.5) kJ mol −1 of Ca 2 [B 2 O 4 (OH) 2 ]·0.5H 2 O was obtained. Keywords Ca 2 [B 2 O 4 (OH) 2 ]·0.5H 2 O Synthesis Standard molar enthalpy of formation 1 Introduction There are several types of hydrated calcium borates, both natural and synthetic. Some of them are useful chemical industrial materials, which are used in the glass, pottery and porcelain enamel industries, especially in the manufacture of glasses without alkali content. Gurevich and Sokolov [1] determined the standard molar enthalpies of formation of the natural calcium borate minerals of Ca 2 B 6 O 11 ·5H 2 O and Ca 2 B 6 O 11 ·l3H 2 O. Jun et al. [2] also reported the standard molar enthalpy of formation of five other hydrated calcium borates. This paper reports the synthesis and standard molar enthalpy of formation of a new calcium borate, Ca 2 [B 2 O 4 (OH) 2 ]·0.5H 2 O. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of Ca 2 [B 2 O 4 (OH) 2 ]·0.5H 2 O 2.806 g of CaO (obtained by the decomposition of CaCO 3 (A.R.) at 1223 K for 3 h), 3.093 g of H 3 BO 3 (A.R.) and 30 cm 3 of H 2 O were put into a small autoclave (40 ml). The mixture was stirred and placed in an oven at 393 K. The autoclave was cooled naturally and opened after 5 days. The solid phase was filtered, washed with hot distilled water, alcohol and ether and was dried at 353 K to constant mass. The synthetic sample was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (Rigaku D/MAX-IIIC), FT-IR spectroscopy (Nicolet NEXUS 670 FT-IR spectrometer, in KBr pellets at room temperature) and TG (METZSCH-Geratebau GmbH STA449C thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min −1 in flowing N 2 ). The chemical composition of the sample was determined by titration with standard EDTA solution for calcium content, by titration with standard NaOH solution in the presence of mannitol for B 2 O 3 content, and by difference for H 2 O content. 2.2 Method of calorimetric experiment An RD496-III heat conduction calorimeter (Southwest Institute of Electron Engineering, China) has been described in detail previously [3,4] . The temperature of the calorimetric experiment was 298.15 K. Additional double-layer glass tubes were put in the 15 cm 3 stainless steel sample and reference cells of the calorimeter to prevent corrosion of the stainless steel by HCl(aq). The lining in the double-layer glass tube containing 2.00 ml HCl(aq) was broken by a rod after at least 2 h, when thermal equilibration was reached, and the HCl(aq) was mixed with solid sample (6 mg) in the outer glass tube. The thermal effect was then recorded automatically by a computer. Total time required for the complete reaction was about 0.5 h. There were no solid residues observed after the reactions in each calorimetric experiment. To check the performance of the calorimeter, the calorimetric measurements on the enthalpy of solution of KCl (G.R.) in deionized water were made. The average experimental value (17.31 ± 0.20) kJ mol −1 of Δ sol H m of KCl(s) is in excellent agreement with that of 17.241 ± 0.0l8 kJ mol −1 reported in ref. [5] . Ca 2 [B 2 O 4 (OH) 2 ]·0.5H 2 O can be regarded as the product of the reaction (5) , and the thermochemical cycle could be established as indicated in Fig. 1 . The approximately 1 mol dm −3 HCl(aq) solvent dissolves all components of the reaction (5) . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of the synthetic sample The analysis of the sample is shown in Table 1 together with the theoretical values. The XRD pattern of the synthetic sample is shown in Fig. 2 . The characteristic d values are 0.2967, 0.6681, 0.2828, 0.2229, 0.2068, 0.4217, 0.1838, 0.1787, 0.1821, 0.9929, 0.1774, 0.1774 and 0.1746 nm. The absorption bands in the IR spectrum of the synthetic sample ( Fig. 3 ) are assigned according to ref. [6] . The band at 3355 cm −1 is the stretching vibration of the O H group. The weak band at 1600 cm −1 is assigned to the H O H bending mode. This confirms the presence of crystallization water in the compound. The bands at 1429, 1315 and 911 cm −1 are, respectively, assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of B(3) O group. The band at 1159 cm −1 is the in-plane bending of B O H. The very strong band at 715 cm −1 is assigned to out-of-plane bending of the group B(3) O, which was also observed in the compound of Mg 2 [B 2 O 4 (OH) 2 ]·H 2 O [7] . The band at 592 cm −1 is assigned to the in-plane bending of B(3) O. TG–DSC curves ( Fig. 4 ) indicate that the total weight loss is 13.09% from 50 to 750 °C, which corresponds to the loss of 1.5 water molecules and is near to the calculated value of 12.94%. Thus, the general formula for 2CaO·B 2 O 3 ·1.5H 2 O can be written as Ca 2 [B 2 O 4 (OH) 2 ]·0.5H 2 O. All of above results indicate that the synthetic sample is pure and suitable for the calorimetric experiments. 3.2 Results of calorimetric experiment The results of five calorimetric measurements gave −191.75 ± 0.34 kJ mol −1 for Δ H m ° sol , the molar enthalpy of solution of the compound. Table 2 gives the thermochemical cycle for the derivation of the standard molar enthalpy of formation of Ca 2 [B 2 O 4 (OH) 2 ]·0.5H 2 O. The molar enthalpy of solution of H 3 BO 3 (s) of 21.83 ± 0.08 kJ mol −1 in HC1 54.561H 2 O and of CaO(s) of −(188.63 ± 0.36) kJ mol −1 in the mixture of HCl and H 3 BO 3 were taken from ref. [2] . The standard molar enthalpies of formation of H 2 O(l), CaO(s) and H 3 BO 3 (s) were taken from the CODATA Key Values [8] , namely −(285.83 ± 0.04), −(634.9 ± 0.90) and −(1094.8 ± 0.8) kJ mol −1 , respectively. The enthalpy of dilution of HCl(aq) was calculated from the NBS tables [9] . From these data, the standard molar enthalpy of formation of Ca 2 [B 2 O 4 (OH) 2 ]·0.5H 2 O was calculated to be −(3172.5 ± 2.5) kJ mol −1 .

        "abstract": "A new analytical method for the determination of uric acid (UA) by the perturbation of UA on the Belousov–Zhabotinsky oscillating reaction is proposed. The method is based on the linear relationship between the changes in the oscillating period and the concentration of UA. The calibration curve is linear over the range of 2.0 × 10 −5 to 5.0 × 10 −4 M, with a detecting limit of 3.28 × 10 −6 M. The method features good precision (R.S.D.: 3.59%) and excellent throughput (10 samples h −1 ). The possible mechanism of the perturbation of UA on the oscillating reaction is discussed. Keywords Oscillating chemical reaction APP Uric acid CSTR 1 Introduction Oscillating chemical systems have been the focus of many researchers for the past two decades because of the wealth of dynamic behavior in these far-from-equilibrium complex systems. Not only single period, but also a wide variety of non-linear behaviors have been observed in experimental systems: quasi-double-period, complex oscillations, chaos and so on [1–4] . A number of approaches have been taken to investigate on the non-linear behaviors in order to elucidate the very complex reaction mechanisms. The most widely studied chemical system is the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction [5] . In general, the BZ reaction accomplishes the oxidation of an organic substrate by bromate under a catalyst in an acidic environment. However, most biological systems are commonly placed under far-from-equilibrium state with dissipative structure. There has been an explosion of interest in the BZ reactions, as a simple chemical model of biological systems, because of the similarities between chemical oscillating systems and life process that exhibit oscillatory behavior. Lactic acid (LA) is an important intermediate product that is related to metabolic process of life. Under anaerobic conditions, glucose in vivo can be transferred to LA and produce energy to maintain normal functions of living organism. Under aerobic conditions, LA can be oxidized to CO 2 and H 2 O [6] . Therefore, we consider the LA–acetone–BrO 3 − –Mn 2+ –H 2 SO 4 oscillating reaction as a better model for studying on antioxidation. Mn(II)-catalyzed Belousov–Zhabotinsky oscillator with LA was extensively studied by Peter Sevcik and co-workers [7,8] . They found the system oscillates only if the bromine formed during the reaction is removed by bubbling inert gas [9] . It was firstly reported by our group in 1997 that acetone can be used instead of inert gas, which has active methylene radical by the action of enolization in acid medium. In this paper, the modified reaction was investigated in open system for the first time in order to get sustained stable oscillations. Continuous-flow stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) is widely used to ensure the oscillating reaction be permanently far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Under the optimum conditions by CSTR, the state of the oscillation would be stable at least 10 h, so that we have enough time for the quantitative analysis. The analyte pulse perturbation technique, developed by Pérez-Bendito and co-workers [10–13] have been considered as a powerful analysis tool for CSTR systems. The literatures have been gradually accumulated for analytical determination using this technique in the last few years [14–17] . Free radicals have been postulated to be a major factor contributing to many diseases for its oxidative damage to cellular components, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease [18,19] and sickle cell anemia [20] . However, antioxidants can inhibit the levels of active oxygen. Uric acid, the end product of purine metabolism, is a natural antioxidant that exists in plasma in relatively high concentration (in men, 320 ± 60 μM; in women, 234 ± 52 μM) [21] . UA can prevent lipid from peroxidating and clear up ozone and hypochlorous acid in body. UA reactions with hydroxy radical produce peroxy radical, which is more inactive and harmfulness than hydroxyl. But excess UA peroxy radical can make alcohol dehydrogenase and α-antiprotease inactive [22,23] . Therefore, determination of uric acid would be often recommended in many clinical situations. Uric acid is often determined by chromatographic [24,25] and electrophoretic [26,27] methods. Up to now, there have been few literatures on the determination of UA by kinetic analytical method, which will help us better understand antioxidation of UA. Moreover, our new analytical method is more rapid and simple after the oscillations become stable. A new method for the determination of uric acid based on the perturbation on the LA–acetone–BrO 3 − –Mn 2+ –H 2 SO 4 oscillating system by CSTR is proposed in this paper. After regular single period displayed in the system, a few microliters solution of uric acid was injected into the oscillation system. Changes in oscillating period were recorded and calculated for quantitative analysis of uric acid. We also found that the ratio of the oscillating period changes (PR) was not simply increased with the concentration of uric acid. But PR was gradually decreased as the increase of uric acid concentration over 5.0 × 10 −4 M. 2 Experimental 2.1 Reagents All chemicals used were of analytical grade and doubly distilled, de-ionized water was used to prepare solutions throughout. Solutions of LA (0.15 M), Act (0.12 M), MnSO 4 (5.0 × 10 −3 M), and KBrO 3 (0.035 M) were prepared separately with different concentrations of H 2 SO 4 . The concentration of H 2 SO 4 was chosen by the requirement of experiment to control the different acidity of oscillating reaction. Stock solution of uric acid (0.01 M) was prepared with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide. 2.2 Apparatus The experimental instrument (in Fig. 1 ) consists of a 20 mL glass vessel connected to a Model CS501 thermostat (Chongqing Experimental Instrumental Factory), Pt electrode and Hg/Hg 2 SO 4 /K 2 SO 4 reference electrode (Rex, 217) which were used to monitor the signals of oscillations, a magnetic stirrer (Shanghai Experimental Instrumental Factory, 81-2). The reactants were fed by a peristaltic pump (Masterflax, Cole-Pammer Instrument). A syringe was used for injecting samples. 2.3 Procedures All the solutions of reactants and the CSTR were thermostated at 299 K. Then, the electrodes were inserted and peristaltic pump started to supple the reactant streams at a constant flow rate of 1.13 mL min −1 ( Fig. 1 ). Oscillations immediately start when the reactants mixed. After the stable oscillatory state had been set-up, different amounts of UA samples or water were injected. It would spend a few periods for the system to regain its stable oscillatory state and then a new determination could be taken. Voltage signals of the reaction were acquired by our data-collecting system. Changes in the oscillating period following perturbation were used as measurement to construct the calibration plot and determine UA. 3 Results and discussion In the process of Mn(II)-catalyzed oxidation of lactic acid by BrO 3 − in strong acid medium, the color of the solution switched periodically between yellow and colorless. Fig. 2 shows three kinds of different oscillation profiles we obtained by CSTR under different experimental conditions, whereas only one kind of oscillation profile was obtained in closed system. After a uric acid solution of 4.0 × 10 −5 M was injected into the system, the effects of the perturbation on the three oscillatory states would fade away after about three oscillating periods. So this method can give us excellent throughput (10 samples h −1 ). There are some differences among the effects of perturbation: under single period and quasi-double-period conditions, the oscillating periods shortened; under the mix-mode oscillation, not only the oscillating periods shortened but also the state converted to single period. All the effects can be used for our determination. The point of the cycle in which the analyte is injected, is an important factor in analytical determination oscillating system. The optimum injection point, for maximum response, should be at the point, which the potential is at top of the cycle as shown in Fig. 2 . In order to get good reproducibility, the injection point of every determination should be uniform. 3.1 Influence of experimental variables The effects of experimental variables on the oscillating reaction were studied in order to optimize the working condition for determining uric acid. Different behaviors of the oscillation were observed under different conditions, and the effects of uric acid on the oscillation were also different. Changing each variable in turn while keeping other variables constant, we optimized the system in the absence and presence of UA for obtaining the maximum possible sensitivity and precision. 3.1.1 Influence of acidity The influence of H 2 SO 4 concentration was studied over the range 0.5–1.2 M. Sulfuric acid was almost of no effect on the oscillating amplitude, while the induction period gradually shortened. As can be seen in Fig. 3 A, PR increases firstly and then decreases with increase of acidity. 0.9 M of H 2 SO 4 was chosen as our working condition. 3.1.2 Influence of temperature Temperature was an important variable for the proposed system. The oscillating period was highly vulnerable to any changes of the system temperature. Raising the system temperature, induction period and oscillating period both shortened for the reaction rate improved. The system response to UA perturbation was almost not altered by the temperature changes below 300 K, while PR rapidly decreased above 300 K with raising the temperature of system. We chose 299 K as our working condition for the best sensitivity and reproducible oscillations. 3.1.3 Influence of overall reactant flow rate The overall reactant flow rate fed to CSTR, the other key parameter of the oscillation, was also investigated. The parameter influenced the behaviors of the oscillation and the system resistance to the perturbations. Increasing it from 0.39 to 2.04 mL min −1 , the state of oscillation converted quasi-double-period into single period. The maximum of PR was obtained at 1.13 mL min −1 which we chose in the single period of the oscillation. 3.1.4 Influence of the concentrations of reactants The effect of the LA concentration by CSTR was studied over the range 0.12–0.24 M. With the concentration increased, the induction period shortened while the oscillating period and amplitude kept constant. The effect of the UA perturbation was such that it increased firstly and then decreased rapidly. A LA concentration of 0.15 M was chosen for the optimum condition. The effect of the KBrO 3 concentration in the reactor was studied over the range 0.020–0.040 M and was similar to the effect of LA on the oscillation. Increasing the KBrO 3 concentration, we found that the oscillation state was converted from single period to quasi-double-period. A KBrO 3 concentration of 0.035 M was chosen for the highest sensitivity. The Mn 2+ concentration in the reactor, which Mn 2+ was considered as a catalyst, was changed between 0.003 and 0.030 M. As the Mn 2+ concentration was increased, the induction period shortened and the system transformed single period into quasi-double-period. As a result of increasing the Mn 2+ concentration, PR was increased firstly and then decreased as shown in Fig. 3 F. The Mn 2+ concentration of 0.0033 M was adapted in order to get high sensitivity. Finally, the effect of the acetone concentration was studied over the range 0.10–0.25 M. As the concentration was increased, the induction period lengthened and the system converted from single period to quasi-double-period. But there were almost no changes about PR. We chose an acetone concentration of 0.12 M as our working condition. 3.2 Determination of uric acid Different amounts of uric acid were injected into the system after the oscillation state was stable under the optimum condition. The response to the UA perturbation was evaluated by variational ratio of period (PR): PR = ( P 0 − P )/ P 0 , where P 0 is the period of the cycle immediately before the perturbation was applied, and P is the one corresponding to the UA perturbation ( Fig. 4 ). As can be seen in Fig. 5 , there was good linear relationship between PR and the injected analyte concentration. It may be considered acceptable that applied this method for determination of uric acid. Table 1 summarizes the figures of merit of the calibration graphs. The precision (R.S.D.: 3.59%) and the sensitivity (detection limit: 3.28 × 10 −6 M) of the method were quite good while the UA concentration was in the range of 2.0 × 10 −5 to 50 × 10 −5 M. Under the working conditions, the chemical oscillating reaction would regain the stable oscillatory state after each perturbation, and the throughput was estimated to be about 10 samples h −1 . 3.3 Interferences It was reported that oscillating system is vulnerable to some foreign species. We investigated the effects of some foreign ions and potential interferences from substances with chemical structures or characteristics resembling that of uric acid. The tolerant level was defined as the maximum amount of foreign species causing an error of less than 5% in the determination of 4 × 10 −5 M uric acid. The results obtained are shown in Table 2 . 3.4 Mechanism of uric acid on the oscillating system and numerical simulations Since the FKN model for the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction was first reported by Field et al. in 1972 [28] , which consists of over 20 elementary reactions, the literatures have gradually accumulated on the investigation of the mechanism. The model considered here, which has been studied deeply by An (our group) in 1997 [6] , is a simplification of the FKN model. The basic idea of the mechanism is that there are four important processes in every oscillating period which are listed as follows: • Process A: (1) B r − + Br O 3 − + 2 H + ⇌ HBr O 2 + HOBr (2) HBr O 2 + B r − + H + ⇌ 2 HOBr (3) B r − + HOBr + H + ⇌ B r 2 + H 2 O • Process B: (4) 2 HBr O 2 ⇌ HOBr + Br O 3 − + H + (5) HBr O 2 + Br O 3 − + H + ⇌ 2 Br O 2 + H 2 O (6) Br O 2 + M n 2 + + H + ⇌ M n 3 + + HBr O 2 • Process C: (7) M n 3 + + C H 3 CHOHCOOH + H 2 O → M n 2 + + C H 3 COOH + C O 2 + 4 H + • Process D: (8) B r 2 + C H 3 COC H 3 → BrC H 2 COC H 3 + B r − + H + The key of the oscillation contain the autocatalytic reaction of Br O 2 that is mainly depended on the concentration of Br − . With the increase of [Br − ], the production of Br O 2 becomes more and more slowly because of the restriction of Process B. When the concentration of Br − decreased, on the contrary, Process A is restricted and Process B becomes the main reaction of the system, with the formation of Mn 3+ . When uric acid was injected into the oscillation, the analyte can react with Mn 3+ which was reduced to Mn 2+ by lactic acid. As a result of the increase of [Mn 2+ ], the reaction (9) cooperates with Process C. Therefore, Process B is dominated in the whole reactions causing the decrease of Br − which controls the oscillating period. All our numerical simulations are based on the modified FKN model mentioned above. Simulations were performed using the LSODE implementation of the Gear's algorithm for stiff ordinary differential equations (LSODE, Livermore solver for ordinary differential equations). The integrator works in double precision, while the output file is single precision. Data were sampled once a second. Fig. 6 illustrates the comparison between our experimental data and numerical simulations. Oscillations and the perturbations on this system were both simulated under the condition of single period. Numerical simulations are in agreement with the data of actual experiments very well. 4 Conclusions Our results demonstrate a suitable use of LA–acetone–BrO 3 − –Mn 2+ –H 2 SO 4 oscillating reaction for the determination of uric acid, which has an effect on the Mn 2+ concentration. The calibration curve is linear over the range of 2.0 × 10 −5 to 5.0 × 10 −4 M, with a detecting limit of 3.28 × 10 −6 M. The method features good precision (R.S.D.: 3.59%) and excellent throughput (10 samples h −1 ). It will help us better understand the antioxidation of UA on the biological systems.

The as-yielded materials are analyzed by micro-Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscope. The results reveal that large area, thin (100 nm) SiGe layer with high relaxation (94%) is thus successfully prepared. Selective chemical etching of SiGe, with the etching rate of 25.4 nm/min, is also performed to study the mechanism. It is found that a strained-Si layer exists at the interface between the epi-SiGe and Si substrate, which is believed to be resulted from both ion implantation and formation of a relaxed-SiGe layer.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene -592 A/C polymorphism in Chinese patients with lupus nephritis (LN) and evaluate the role of IL-10 in the pathogenesis and clinical/pathological diversity of LN. Methods: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses were used to detect the IL-10 gene -592 A/C polymorphism in 265 LN patients and 100 ethnically matched controls. Frequencies of the genotypes were compared between LN patients and controls and among LN patients with different pathological classes. The clinical and pathological characteristics of the patients with different genotypes were also analyzed. Serum IL-10 levels of the patients were determined by ELISA. Results: No significant differences were found in the distribution of the polymorphism between healthy controls and LN patients. The parameters of disease activity index (DAI), percentage of positive serum anti-dsDNA antibodies, proteinuria and hematuria, and frequency of glomerular thrombi were all higher in patients with -592 AC/CC genotypes than those with AA genotype. AC/CC genotypes were more frequent in patients with LN-IV than in those with LN-II and Va. There was no significant difference in the serum IL-10 levels in patients with these three genotypes. Conclusion: The IL-10 gene -592 A/C polymorphism appears to be associated with disease activity and renal pathology of LN, but not associated with LN susceptibility or serum IL-10 levels. Patients carrying the -592 C allele had a higher risk of diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, indicating the genetic influence of the IL-10 gene polymorphism in the renal lesions of LN. © Copyright Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 2005.",

        "abstract": "Objective:to investigate the renal clinical and pathological characters in Chinese obese patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy (T2DN). Methodology:One hundred and fourty two cases of T2DN diagnosed by renal biopsy were enrolled. The clinical and laboratory data as well as histological characters were analyzed. According to wether or not obesity the patients were divided into two groups. Results:Sixty cases of obese patients accounted for 42.3% in whole cases with T2DN ,the mean BMI was (30.3±1.90)kg/m2,mean waist circumstance was (102±7.80)cm,and mean waist to hip ratio was 0.95±0.06. Among them,the central obesity accounted for 85%,especially in female cases. The obese patients had severe metabolic disorder including high triglycerides,high dense lipoprotein,high level of fast serum insulin and C peptide. The course of diabetes mellitus in obese patients was shorter than that in normal weight group significantly (P<0.01),however,the interval between diabetes and renal damage was significantly shorter (P<0.01),the rate of slight proteinuria (<1 g/24h,P<0.05)was higher,the complications of diabetic retinopathy and heart ischemia was lesser. In obese group,the renal volume and eGFR was significantly higher (P<0.01),the glomerular diameter and volume was enlargement,and the hyaline degeneration of afferent and efferent arteriole of glomeruli were more common than that in normal weight patients (P<0.05). The incidence ratio of renal dysfunction was higher in normal weight group,and renal pathological lesions prior to reflect advanced sclerosis changes. Conclusion:Not only severe metabolic disturbance,but also renal glomerular hyperperfusion and hyperfiltration co-existed in obese patients with T2DN,and proteinuria occurred earlier in obese patients. In this regard,the weight reduction may postpone renal damage in obese patients either with T2DM or T2DN.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To analyze the clinical and immunological features of 1 352 Chinese patients with lupus nephritis in a single-center. Methodology: 1 352 LN patients in Jingling Hospital from 1986 to 2005 were included in this study. All patients had renal biopsy. The histological classifications were categorized according to 2003 ISN/RPS classification (Class Ⅰ and Ⅵ were not included in the study). The cmbined class of Ⅳ or Ⅲ and Ⅴ were recorded as Ⅳ+Ⅴ or Ⅴ+Ⅲ. Results: 1 193 (88.2) females, and 159(11.8) males were all Han Chinese, 80 of them were from 18 to 50 years old (mean 27.3±9.2 years). The renal histological classes showed class Ⅱ (14.2), Ⅲ (5.6), Ⅳ (49.1), Ⅴ (14.4), Ⅴ+Ⅳ (11.7) and Ⅴ+Ⅲ (5). The proportion of class Ⅱ (15.2) and Ⅲ (6.2) in females was higher than that in males (6.9 and 0.6 respectively, P<0.05), while class Ⅳ was more common in males than that in females (59.7 vs 47.6, P<0.01). The incidence of extra-renal manifestations including malar rash, fever, arthritis and anemia were higher in class Ⅱ than that in other types. The Serositis, positive anti-dsDNA antibody and low C4 were more frequent in class Ⅳ and Ⅴ+Ⅳ, but less in class Ⅴ. The skin vasculitis and serum ANCA (all MPO-ANCA) were more common in class Ⅲ (10.3), Ⅳ (5.7) and Ⅴ+Ⅲ (3.2). The anticardiolipin antibodies were detected in all types but higher in class Ⅱ (34.1), Ⅲ (34.8), Ⅴ (32.6) and type Ⅳ (26.1), while Cryoglobulinemia was more prominent in class Ⅴ+Ⅲ (69.4), type Ⅴ (59) and Ⅴ+Ⅳ (46.3). The patients with hematuria in class Ⅱ (18) and Ⅴ (30) were much less than that in Ⅳ (89), Ⅴ+Ⅳ (87), Ⅴ+Ⅲ (79) and Ⅲ (63), while gross hematuria and RPGN were only found in class Ⅳ (10, 27), Ⅴ+Ⅳ(6.3, 20.9 ), Ⅴ+Ⅲ(6.3, 6) and Ⅲ (3.9, 1.3) but none in class Ⅱ and Ⅴ. The incidence of nephrotic syndrome was higher in class Ⅴ+Ⅳ (52.5) than that in class Ⅳ (31.6), class Ⅴ (34.9) and Ⅴ+Ⅲ (35.8). Conclusion: Lupus nephritis class Ⅳ was the most common type in this study. The segmental or diffuse glomerular proliferation combined with membranous lesion was also common and should be identified. The Sex difference influenced the pattern of histological types. The correlation between histological class and clinical-immunological features might be associated with unique immunopathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "In this work, temperature dependences of small-signal model parameters in the SiGe HBT HICUM model are presented. Electrical elements in the small-signal equivalent circuit are first extracted at each temperature, then the temperature dependences are determined by the series of extracted temperature coefficients, based on the established temperature formulas for corresponding model parameters. The proposed method is validated by a 1 × 0.2 × 16 μm2 SiGe HBT over a wide temperature range (from 218 K to 473 K), and good matching is obtained between the extracted and modeled results. Therefore, we believe that the proposed extraction flow of model parameter temperature dependence is reliable for characterizing the transistor performance and guiding the circuit design over a wide temperature range.",

        "abstract": "Endothelial dysfunction promotes the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN), which is considered to be an early event in disease progression. However, the molecular changes associated with glomerular endothelial cell (GEC) injury in early DN are not well defined. Most gene expression studies have relied on the indirect assessment of GEC injury from isolated glomeruli or renal cortices. Here, we present transcriptomic analysis of isolated GECs, using streptozotocin-induced diabetic wildtype (STZ-WT) and diabetic eNOS-null (STZ-eNOS) mice as models of mild and advanced DN, respectively. GECs of both models in comparison to their respective nondiabetic controls showed significant alterations in the regulation of apoptosis, oxidative stress, and proliferation. The extent of these changes was greater in STZ-eNOS than in STZ-WT GECs. Additionally, genes in STZ-eNOS GECs indicated further dysregulation in angiogenesis and epigenetic regulation. Moreover, a biphasic change in the number of GECs, characterized by an initial increase and subsequent decrease over time, was observed only in STZ-eNOS mice. This is consistent with an early compensatory angiogenic process followed by increased apoptosis, leading to an overall decrease in GEC survival in DN progression. From the genes altered in angiogenesis in STZ-eNOS GECs, we identified potential candidate genes, Lrg1 and Gpr56, whose function may augment diabetes-induced angiogenesis. Thus, our results support a role for GEC in DN by providing direct evidence for alterations of GEC gene expression and molecular pathways. Candidate genes of specific pathways, such as Lrg1 and Gpr56, can be further explored for potential therapeutic targeting to mitigate the initiation and progression of DN.",

Biochemical patterns of lipids and lipoproteins were detected by routine examination. Plasma concentrations of apo B and apo E were determined by radial immunodiffusion assays. Biopsy specimens were then processed for light microscopy, immunohistochemical staining for immunoglobulins and complement components, and electron microscopy. Glomerular deposition of apo A, B, and E were detected using monoclonal antibodies on cryostatic sections.All of the eight patients presented with edema, microscopic hematuria, severe proteinuria, anemia, and enlarged kidney size. Biochemical profiles revealed high levels of triglycerides, apo B, and apo E. We noted increments of glomerular size and lipoprotein thrombi occupying capillary lumina in the glomeruli of all patients. Immunofluorescence staining showed that the thrombi were strongly positive for apo A, B, and E. Granules and various sizes of vacuoles were observed in the thrombi under electron microscope.Compared with previous reports on LPG in other countries, unique clinical and pathological features were found in this group of Chinese LPG patients.",

Regardless of the pathologic diagnosis of the glomerular disease, segmental glomerular sclerosis occurred more frequently in patients with FCs than in patients without FCs. In the AS or IgAN group, interstitial fibrosis was more severe, and levels of proteinuria and serum lipids were significantly higher in FC-positive patients than in patients without FCs.FC formation in renal interstitium is associated with the degree of proteinuria and hyperlipidemia in patients with AS and IgAN.

        "abstract": "To evaluate the role of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) in the glucose uptake of glomerular mesangial cells.Cultured human glomerular mesangial cells were used. The expressions of glucose transporter 1 mRNA and protein were detected with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. Glucose uptake was determined with 2-deoxy-[3H]-D-glucose uptake assay.The expressions of GLUT1 mRNA and proteins were detected in human mesangial cells. Glucose uptake and its kinetics assay showed that GLUT1 is a functional glucose transporter in cultured human mesangial cells, and that its function could be inhibited by the specific inhibitor, Phloretin.GLUT1 is the predominant glucose transporter in human mesangial cells, which has the kinetic characteristics of high affinity and low capacity for D-glucose. This suggests that in order for mesangial cells to take up excessive quantities of glucose, as in diabetes, changes in glucose transporter expression, translocation or activity may be required.",

The clinical and pathological features of 49 male and 152 female LN patients with genotype PpXx or Ppxx, ppxx were then analyzed respectively.It was found that genotype PpXx and ppxx, Ppxx were three major genotypes of ER gene in both lupus patients group and control group. The distribution of ER gene polymorphism was quite different in lupus patients of different genders. The frequency of the PpXx genotype was significantly higher in male LN patients than in both the gender matched normal controls (P<0.05) and the female LN patients (P<0.05), while no difference was shown in the frequency of PpXx genotype between female LN patients and female controls. Interestingly, varied clinical and renal pathological features were also demonstrated in female patients with different genotypes of ER gene.The distribution of ER gene polymorphism in LN patients varies with gender. The PpXx genotype of ER gene may be associated with the susceptibility of LN in male. ER gene polymorphism is probably one of the genetic factors contributing to the development of clinical heterogeneity and sexually dimorphic manifestations of LN.",

        "abstract": "Both epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and immune regulation are important biological process in malignant tumours. The current research aims to comprehensively explore the potential association between the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature and immune checkpoint signature and its role in predicting the prognosis of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients. EMT-related genes were collected from an experiment-based study and then were investigated using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas. A total of 357 genes were included, and 23 of them that were upregulated and correlated with prognosis were analysed further as core EMT genes in ccRCC. Interestingly, the emerging immune checkpoints CD276, OX40 and TGFB1 were found to be significantly co-expressed with core EMT genes, and TGFB1, CXCR4, IL10, and IL6 were the most important molecules potentially interacting with EMT molecules in our model, as determined from mRNA co-expression and protein-protein interaction network analysis. Additionally, an integrated scoring model based on FOXM1, TIMP1 and IL6 was successfully established to distinguish ccRCC patients with different clinical risks. Our results identified core genes in the EMT-immunophenotyping correlation and evaluated their risk assessment capabilities, providing more potential therapeutic targets and prediction approaches regarding the translational research of treatment and prognosis in ccRCC.",

        "abstract": "Published data regarding the overall risks and incidence of hypertension and proteinuria associated with bevacizumab were still unclear. To quantify the precise risks and incidence, we performed this comprehensive meta-analysis of 72 published clinical trials including 21902 cases and 20608 controls. The overall incidence, risk ratios (RRs), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using a fixed or random-effect model based on the heterogeneity. The incidence of all-grade and high-grade hypertension were 25.3% (95% CI: 21.5%-29.5%) and 8.2% (95% CI: 7%-9.8%) for patients treated with bevacizumab. And the incidence of all-grade and high-grade proteinuria were 18% (95% CI: 11.7%-26.6%) and 2.4% (95% CI: 1.8%-3.2%), respectively. Compared with controls, bevacizumab significantly increased the risks of all-grade (RR: 3.595, 95% CI: 2.952-4.378) and high-grade hypertension (RR: 5.173, 95% CI: 4.188-6.390). Obviously increased risks of all-grade (RR: 3.369, 95% CI: 2.492-4.556) and high-grade proteinuria (RR: 5.494, 95% CI: 3.991-7.564) were also observed. In the subgroup analysis, the risks of hypertension and proteinuria may significantly vary with bevacizumab dosage, cancer types and concomitant drugs. Whereas, no obvious difference were discovered when stratified based on phase of trials, age of patients, treatment line and duration. So, close monitor and effective management were highly recommended for the safe use of bevacizumab.",

        "abstract": "Our aim was to investigate the removal of myeloperoxidase-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) from the circulation of patients with vasculitides by double-filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) using various primary separator and secondary separator combinations. Nineteen patients diagnosed with vasculitides positive for serum MPO-ANCA were enrolled and received 56 sessions of DFPP. One patient received three sessions of DFPP using MPS07 (the primary filter)/EC50W (the secondary filter), nine patients received 27 sessions of DFPP using MPS07/EC20W, and the other nine patients received 26 sessions of DFPP using EC50W/EC20W. The sieving coefficients (SC) of albumin, immunoglobulin (Ig)A, IgG and IgM were measured, as well as the reduction ratio in plasma protein concentrations and MPO-ANCA titer after a single session of DFPP. The MPS07 filter was well permeable for all the above-mentioned plasma proteins; the EC50W and EC20W filters were permeable for albumin and IgG, less for IgA and IgM. During DFPP using MPS07/EC50W, the reduction ratio of IgG was much lower than IgM and IgA (30.5 ± 9.0% vs. 89.7 ± 5.4% and 61.7 ± 14.8%). During DFPP using MPS07/EC20W, the decline in IgM, IgA, and IgG was 94.2 ± 3.1%, 96.2 ± 2.3%, and 64.7 ± 21.0%, respectively. During DFPP using EC50W/EC20W, the decline in IgM, IgA, and IgG was 2.8 ± 12.9%, 90.9 ± 4.4%, and 43.5 ± 13.8%, respectively. The percentage reduction in MPO-ANCA titer after a single session of DFPP using EC50W/EC20W was 34.6 ± 14.3%. DFPP using EC50W/EC20W filters may be more selective for the removal of pathogens such as IgG, with subsequently effective reduction of serum ANCA titer.",

Methods Ten patients diagnosed as type 2 DN were included in the study. They were divided based on their clinical phenotype. Five donor kidneys served as normal controls. Glomeruli were dissected out from each individual patient abundant residual biopsy sample under microscope. Total RNA was extracted and biotin-labeled cRNA was hybridized to each GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Statistical analysis was performed with the GeneSpring 7.2 software (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA, USA) and the further bioinformatic analysis was carried out. The alteration of candidate genes was further confirmed using real-time PCR. Results The glomerular gene profiling of DN was markedly distinct from the normal controls. Different genotypes were given based on the different clinical phenotypes. Combined analyzing the changed gene expression in the development of proteinuria, histology lesions and serum creatinine level, the gene profiling linked to the progression of DN was found, in which there were a lot of genes related to the metabolism. And some molecules related to inflammation response were also included. Conclusions Phenotype-based analysis of glomerular gene profiling using biopsy tissues displayed the gene profiling of patients with progressive DN. Disordered metabolism and the following triggered inflammation response may play an important role in progression of DN.",

        "abstract": "The enthalpies of solution of magnesium oxysulfate compounds MgSO 4 ·5MgO·7H 2 O and MgSO 4 ·5MgO·8H 2 O in approximately 1 mol dm −3 aqueous hydrochloric acid were determined. From these results and the enthalpies of solution of MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O and MgO in HCl(aq) respectively, the standard molar enthalpies of formation of −(6496.00±0.73) kJ mol −1 for MgSO 4 ·5MgO·7H 2 O and −(6800.17±0.55) kJ mol −1 for MgSO 4 ·5MgO·8H 2 O were obtained by using the standard molar enthalpies of formation of MgO(s), MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O(s) and H 2 O(l). The standard molar entropies of formation of MgSO 4 ·5MgO·7H 2 O and MgSO 4 ·5MgO·8H 2 O were calculated from the thermodynamic relation with the standard molar Gibbs free energy of formation of MgSO 4 ·5MgO·7H 2 O and MgSO 4 ·5MgO·8H 2 O computed from a group contribution methods. Keywords Magnesium oxysulfate Standard molar enthalpy of formation Solution calorimetry Molar enthalpy Aqueous hydrochloric acid solution 1 Introduction Magnesium oxysulfate compounds belong to a rather large group of hydrated metal sulfates which exhibit retrograde solubility upon cooling. Most of them were synthesized in the MgO–MgSO 4 –H 2 O and Mg(OH) 2 –MgSO 4 –H 2 O ternary system [1–3] . Recently, some new members in this series of compounds, for example, MgSO 4 ·5MgO·8H 2 O [4] , MgSO 4 ·(1/3)Mg(OH) 2 ·(1/3)H 2 O [5] and 2MgSO 4 ·Mg(OH) 2 [6] , were obtained by hydrothermal reactions. These magnesium oxysulfate compounds have useful properties, for example, MgSO 4 ·5MgO·8H 2 O is a kind of whisker which can be used for reinforcing and giving them fireproof properties in the polymers production. The main studies on these magnesium oxysulfate compounds were concentrated on their structure and thermal behavior [7–9] . There are no reports on the standard molar enthalpies of formation of magnesium oxysulfate compounds in the literature. Thermodynamic properties play very important roles in scientific researches and industrial applications. In this paper, the standard molar enthalpies of formation of MgSO 4 ·5MgO·7H 2 O and MgSO 4 ·5MgO·8H 2 O were determined by solution calorimetry. 2 Experimental MgSO 4 ·5MgO·8H 2 O was prepared at laboratory according to method given in the literature [4] . All the reagents used in synthesis were of analytical grade (Xi’an Chemical Factory, PR China). Eighty-five grams NaOH solution (10 mol l −1 ) was dropped into 800 g of a MgSO 4 solution (3.2 mol l −1 ) to form a slurry solution after stirring. The mixture was sealed in a 2 dm 3 stainless steel autoclave and heated at 140±2 °C during 8 h followed by quenching of the autoclave to room temperature. The solid phase was separated and washed with distilled water, alcohol and ether, respectively. Finally, it was dried at room temperature at constant weight. The compounds were characterized by chemical analysis, X-ray powder diffraction, and FT-IR spectrum, and the results were in agreement with the literature [4] . Two and a half grams of NaOH solution (10 mol l −1 ) was droped into 55 g of a MgSO 4 solution (2.5 mol l −1 ) to form a slurry solution after stirring, and the mixture was sealed in a 90 cm 3 stainless steel autoclave and heated at 160±2 °C during 16 h. The preparation and characterization process of MgSO 4 ·5MgO·7H 2 O were similar to that of MgSO 4 ·5MgO·8H 2 O. The composition of the compounds is given in Table 1 . The compounds are pure and have the general formulas: MgSO 4 ·5MgO·7H 2 O and MgSO 4 ·5MgO·8H 2 O, and they are suitable for calorimetric experiments. The impurity corrections were unnecessary. High-purity MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O (mass fraction >0.9999, Xi’an Chemical Factory, PR China) was used without further purification. Analytical grade HCl and distilled water were used for preparation of the solvent system and its concentration was determined by titration with standard borax. Thermochemical reaction used for the derivation of Δ r H ° m of MgSO 4 ·5MgO·7H 2 O and MgSO 4 ·5MgO·8H 2 O was: (1) MgSO 4 ·5 MgO · nH 2 O ( s )+10 HCl ( aq )= MgSO 4 ( aq )+5 MgCl 2 ( aq )+(5+n) H 2 O The standard molar enthalpies of formation of MgSO 4 ·5MgO·7H 2 O and MgSO 4 ·5MgO·8H 2 O could be obtained from the enthalpies of reaction (Δ r H ° m ) and the standard molar enthalpies of formation of MgO(s), MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O(s) and H 2 O(l). A RD496-III precision microcalorimeter (made in Southwest Institute of Electronic Engineering, China) was used. A set of additional glass reaction cell which was put in the stainless steel cell for the microcalorimeter was used because of the corrosion by HCl(aq) of the stainless steel cell. The RD496-III precision microcalorimeter was calibrated for the Joule effect; the calibration was repeated after each experiment, and the average calibration constant was used. The glass ampoule in the reaction cell was broken by a glass rod after thermal equilibrium for at least 2 h, and thermal effect was recorded. Total time required for the complete reaction was about 1 h, depending on the samples. There was no solid residue observed after reaction in any of the calorimetric experiments. 3 Results and discussion To check the performance of the RD496-III precision microcalorimeter, the enthalpy of solution of KCl (mass fraction >99.99%) was measured, and the results are listed in Table 2 , the experimental value of 17.24±0.06 kJ mol −1 is in agreement with that of 17.241±0.081 kJ mol −1 , the recommended value in the literature [10] . Tables 3–5 give the results of the calorimetric experiment. In these tables, m is the mass of the sample, Δ sol H m is the molar enthalpy of solution of solute, and the uncertainty is twice the standard deviation of the mean. Tables 6 and 7 give the thermochemical cycle for the derivation of the standard molar enthalpies of formation of MgSO 4 ·5MgO·7H 2 O and MgSO 4 ·5MgO·8H 2 O. The molar enthalpies of solution of MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O(s) of −(36.16±0.36) kJ mol −1 in approximately 1 mol dm −3 HCl(aq), and MgO(s) of −(149.78±0.32) kJ mol −1 in approximately 1 mol dm −3 HCl(aq) were taken from literature [11] . The standard molar enthalpies of formation of H 2 O(l), MgO(s), MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O(s) were taken from the CODATA Key Values [12] , namely, −(285.83±0.04), −(597.98±0.32) and −(3388.71±0.04) kJ mol −1 , respectively. The enthalpies of dilution of HCl(aq) were calculated from the NBS table [13] . Therefore, the standard molar enthalpies of formation of MgSO 4 ·5MgO·7H 2 O and MgSO 4 ·5MgO·8H 2 O could be calculated and result are −(6496.00±0.73) kJ mol −1 , −(6800.17±0.55) kJ mol −1 . Applying a group contribution method developed by Mostafa et al. [14] for the calculation of thermodynamic properties of salts, we calculated Δ f H ° m of the MgSO 4 ·5MgO·7H 2 O and MgSO 4 ·5MgO·8H 2 O to be −6511.935 kJ mol −1 and −6810.868 kJ mol −1 . These values agree with the experimental results very well. The relative errors are 0.24 and 0.16%, respectively. Because of no experimental data on Δ f G ° m of MgSO 4 ·5MgO·7H 2 O and MgSO 4 ·5MgO·8H 2 O available, we used a group contribution method to calculate Δ f G ° m to be −5822.44 and −6066.76 kJ mol −1 . Combining with the standard molar enthalpies of formation of MgSO 4 ·5MgO·7H 2 O and MgSO 4 ·5MgO·8H 2 O, their standard molar entropies of formation have been calculated as −2259.13 and −2459.87 J K −1 mol −1 according to the following equation: Δ f S° m = Δ f H° m − Δ f G° m T . Otherwise, the standard molar entropies of MgSO 4 ·5MgO·7H 2 O and MgSO 4 ·5MgO·8H 2 O have been calculated to be 523.091 and 555.45 J K −1 mol −1 according to reaction (6) in Table 6 and reaction (8) in Table 7 . The standard molar entropies of the elements were taken from CODATA Key Values as 32.68, 31.80, 205.43 and 130.571 J K −1 mol −1 for Mg(s), S(s), O 2 (g) and H 2 (g), respectively. References [1] T.

        "abstract": "Intracellular pH is closely related with many biological processes, including cellular proliferation, apoptosis, endocytic processes, signal transduction, and enzymatic activity. The use of fluorescent probes has become an essential method for intracellular pH detection, but existing fluorescent probes have substantial limitations, such as requiring tedious synthetic preparation, suffering from an inappropriate response range and insufficiently long emission wavelength. In this work, a red emissive two-photon fluorescence probe based on carbon dots (pH-CDs) is fabricated using a facile one-pot hydrothermal method for the monitoring of intracellular pH. pH-CDs possess a variety of superior properties, including high selectivity, excellent photostability, and low cytotoxicity. Furthermore, they exhibit a pH-sensitive response in the range of 1.0-9.0 and a linear range of 3.5-6.5, which is desirable for tracking the pH value in living cells. It is demonstrated that the pH-dependent fluorescence signal is regulated via switching between aggregation and disaggregation of CDs. More importantly, pH-CDs can be successfully applied to sense and visualize pH fluctuation in cells, tissue, and zebrafish. These findings suggest that the as-prepared pH-CDs probe has significant potential for practical application in living systems.",

        "abstract": "We performed a single-centre non-blinded clinical trial to compare the clinical efficacies of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and intermittent cyclophosphamide (CTX) pulse therapy as induction treatments in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) vasculitis (AAV) and moderate renal involvement.Patients with active AAV and serum creatinine <500 micromol/L received either MMF treatment (MMF group) or monthly CTX pulse therapy (CTX group) for 6 months. Disease activity was assessed using the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS). The disease activity, remission rate, renal function and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups.A total of 35 patients (15 male, 20 female: aged 49.1 +/- 12.2 years) were enrolled, with 18 in the MMF group and 17 in the CTX group. Of the 35 patients, 28 were MPO-ANCA positive and 2 were PR3-ANCA positive. Four patients were lost to follow-up in the CTX group. At Month 6, BVAS scores were much lower in the MMF group than in the CTX group (0.2 +/- 0.89 versus 2.6 +/- 1.7, P < 0.05). In the intent-to-treatment analysis, 14 of 18 patients (77.8%) treated with MMF and 8 of 17 patients receiving CTX (47.1%) had complete remission with an absolute difference of 30.7%. Eight of 18 patients (44.4%) in the MMF group and 2 of 17 patients (15.4%) in the CTX group recovered renal function. Serum ANCA decreased to normal in 41.7% of patients in the MMF group and in 16.7% in the CTX group. Side effects in the MMF group were pneumonia (1), herpes zoster (1) and gastrointestinal symptoms (2), and in the CTX group were leukocytopenia (1), gastrointestinal distress (4) and pneumonia (1).Our study suggests that MMF effectively ameliorates disease activity and considerably improves renal function in patients with AAV. Further large-scale multicentre prospective randomized controlled trials will be needed to confirm these findings.",

        "abstract": "High autophagic activity in podocytes, terminally differentiated cells which serve as main components of the kidney filtration barrier, is essential for podocyte survival under various challenges. How podocytes maintain such a high level of autophagy, however, remains unclear. Here we report that signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) plays a key role in promoting podocyte autophagy. Unlike other glomerular cells, podocytes strongly express SIRPα, which is, however, downregulated in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and mice with experimental nephropathy. Podocyte SIRPα levels are inversely correlated with the severity of podocyte injury and proteinuria but positively with autophagy. Compared to wild-type littermates, Sirpa-deficient mice display greater age-related podocyte injury and proteinuria and develop more rapid and severe renal injury in various models of experimental nephropathy. Mechanistically, podocyte SIRPα strongly reduces Akt/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling, leading to an increase in autophagic activity. Our findings thus demonstrate a critical protective role of SIRPα in podocyte survival via maintaining autophagic activity.",

        "abstract": "The Hailar Basin is a Mesozoic-Cenozoic basin, which is superimposed on the Paleozoic collision orogenic belt of Inner Mongolia–Greater Hinggan Mountain. The basin, trending north-east, consists of five first-order structural units (three depressions and two uplifts), they are, from west to east, the Zhalenuoer Depression, the Cuogang Uplift, the Beier Lake Depression, the Bayanshan Uplift and the Huhe Lake Depression, respectively. The Wuerxun Sag and the Beier Sag are two second-order structural units in the south Beier Lake Depression. Research indicates that in the Early Cretaceous Epoch, the Wuerxun-Beier sag underwent two long-term compressions: NW-SE trending during the Damoguaihe Period to the early Yimin Period, and near EW trending during the end of the Yimin Period, respectively. The compressions led to the inversion of some depression-controlling normal faults in the extensional faulted depression, and formed new fault-propagation fold, fault-bend fold, imbricate structure, duplex structure, pop-up structure, and triangular zone etc. Because of the differences in geometric and kinematic features and the variance in the ratio of the uplift rate of compressional structures to the deposition rate of isostructural growing strata in space, syn-compression strata show different depositional features in different structural positions. These structural features are very similar to those of the orogenic belt. The discovery of two phases of compressional structures in the Wuerxun–Beier Sag proved that the crust of Northeast China was not always in the state of extension and thinning in the Early Cretaceous, but showed the features of superimposition and thickening during the two compression periods, and thus formed the structural framework of the alternative distribution of the compression-depression basins and the intra continental (intra plate) orogenic belt in space.",

Inspired by the positive interfacial effect of vinylene carbonate additive on solid electrolyte interface, a novel poly (vinylene carbonate) based solid polymer electrolyte is presented via a facile in situ polymerization process in this paper. It is manifested that poly (vinylene carbonate) based solid polymer electrolyte possess a superior electrochemical stability window up to 4.5 V versus Li/Li and considerable ionic conductivity of 9.82 × 10 S cm at 50 °C. Moreover, it is demonstrated that high voltage LiCoO/Li batteries using this solid polymer electrolyte display stable charge/discharge profiles, considerable rate capability, excellent cycling performance, and decent safety characteristic. It is believed that poly (vinylene carbonate) based electrolyte can be a very promising solid polymer electrolyte candidate for high energy density lithium batteries.",

It was found that the LiFePO 4 particles adhered to the surface of graphene and/or embedded in the graphene nanosheets. As a result, an effective three-dimensional conducting network was formed by bridging graphene nanosheets, which can facilitate electron transport effectively and thus improve the kinetics and rate performance of LiFePO4. The LiFePO4/graphene (92:8 wt.) composites exhibited a discharge capacity of 160.3 mAh g- 1 at 0.1 C and 81.5 mAh g- 1 at 10 C, respectively. The comparative investigation on LiFePO4/graphene composites and LiFePO4 proved that establishing a mixed conducting network with graphene has a potential to enhance the specific capacity and rate capability of LiFePO 4. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This study explored whether plasma miRNAs could be used as biomarkers to evaluate disease activity in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).Retrospective and prospective cohorts.78 patients with FSGS with nephrotic proteinuria (protein excretion > 3.5g/24 h), 35 patients with FSGS in complete remission, 63 patients with membranous nephropathy, 59 patients with diabetic nephropathy, and 69 apparently healthy controls were recruited. Plasma samples from 51 other patients with FSGS with nephrotic proteinuria were collected prospectively before and after steroid treatment.Plasma miRNA concentration.Complete remission (protein excretion < 0.4g/24 h), or no response (sustained protein excretion > 3.5g/24 h after 8 weeks of steroid treatment).Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of plasma miRNAs.Increases in miR-125b, miR-186, and miR-193a-3p levels were identified in a pooled plasma sample of 9 patients with FSGS compared with that of 9 healthy controls and were confirmed with individual samples from patients with FSGS (n=32) and healthy controls (n=30). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of miR-125b, miR-186, miR-193a-3p, and the 3 miRNAs in combination were 0.882, 0.789, 0.910, and 0.963, respectively. miR-125b and miR-186 concentrations were significantly lower in patients with FSGS in complete remission (n=35) than those with nephrotic proteinuria (n=37). In a prospective study, miR-125b and miR-186 levels declined markedly in patients with FSGS with complete remission (n=29), but not those with no response (n=22), after steroid treatment. Plasma miR-125b and miR-186 levels were not elevated in patients with membranous nephropathy (n=63) and diabetic nephropathy (n=59) regardless of degree of proteinuria. Last, plasma miR-186, but not miR-125b, level was correlated with degree of proteinuria in patients with FSGS (151 samples).Relatively small cohort size.Plasma miR-186 may be a biomarker for FSGS with nephrotic proteinuria.",

        "abstract": "Friulimicin is a cyclic lipodecapeptide antibiotic that is produced by Actinoplanes friuliensis. Similar to the related lipopeptide drug daptomycin, the peptide skeleton of friulimicin is synthesized by a large multienzyme nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) system. The LipD protein plays a major role in the acylation reaction of friulimicin. The attachment of the fatty acid group promotes its antibiotic activity. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that LipD is most closely related to other freestanding acyl carrier proteins (ACPs), for which the genes are located near to NRPS gene clusters. Here, we report that the solution NMR structure of apo-LipD is very similar to other four-helix bundle forming ACPs from fatty acid synthase (FAS), polyketide synthase, and NRPS systems. By recording NMR dynamics data, we found that the backbone motions in holo-LipD are more restricted than in apo-LipD due to the attachment of phosphopantetheine moiety. This enhanced stability of holo-LipD was also observed in differential scanning calorimetry experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, unlike several other ACPs, the folding of LipD does not depend on the presence of divalent cations, although the presence of Mg or Ca can increase the protein stability. We propose that small structural rearrangements in the tertiary structure of holo-LipD which lead to the enhanced stability are important for the cognate enzyme recognition for the acylation reaction. Our results also highlight the different surface charges of LipD and FAS-ACP from A. friuliensis that would allow the acyl-CoA ligase to interact preferentially with the LipD instead of binding to the FAS-ACP.",

        "abstract": "Objective To study the correlationship between the expression of programmed death 1 (PD-1) and the pathology of chronic hepatitis B, and explore the role of PD-1 in chronic HBV infection. Methods Liver biopsies were performed in all 84 patients withchronic hepatitis B, the liver tissues were fixed by 10% formalin and paraffin-embedded sections were stained by HE, and the hepatic inflammatory activity grade and fibrosis stages were evaluated. Immunohistochemical SP was applied to detect the expression of PD-1 in liver tissues. The positive expression means that red staining was found in five discontinuous visual fields under high magnification (400 ×). The results were analyzed by Image Pro Plus 6.0 software. The expression intensity of PD-1 in liver tissues were measured by integral optical density (IOD) titres. Results The expression of PD-1 was positively correlated with hepatic inflammatory activity grade and fibrosis stage, with correlation coefficient as 0.898 (P < 0.001) and 0.700 (P < 0.01) respectively. There were significant differences of PD-1 expression among the hepatic inflammatory activity grades of each groups (P < 0.05). The expression of PD-1 were significantly different among the fibrosis stages of each group (P < 0.05), except S 2 and S 3 , S 3 and S 4 (P > 0.05). Conclusions PD-1 expression in liver tissues are positively correlated with the hepatic inflammatory activity grade and fibrosis stage. Detection of PD-1 is worthy of evaluating hepatic inflammatory activity and fibrosis stages, meanwhile, it can provide valuable reference for assessment in hepatitic pathology.",

        "abstract": "Background. The adjuvant use of mitotane on adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) has always been in controversy. We aimed to assess the prognostic benefits of adjuvant mitotane after resection of ACC in patients without distant metastasis. Methods. The PubMed, WoS, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were adopted as measurements. A meta-analysis was conducted based on hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). A study was included only if the enrolled patients underwent resection of ACC without adjuvant chemotherapy except mitotane. Results. A total of 5 retrospective studies reporting on 1249 patients were included for this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that adjuvant mitotane was significantly associated with prolonged RFS (HR = 0.62; 95%CI, 0.42-0.94; P u003c 0.05) and prolonged OS (HR = 0.69; 95%CI, 0.55-0.88, P u003c 0.05). Conclusion. After comprehensive review, current evidence suggests that adjuvant mitotane significantly decreases the recurrence rate and mortality after resection of ACC in patients without distant metastasis, but these findings need further demonstration from prospective controlled trials.",

        "abstract": "Podocyte injury is a primary contributor to proteinuria. Triptolide is a major active component of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F that exhibits potent antiproteinuric effects. We used our previously developed in vivo zebrafish model of inducible podocyte-target injury and found that triptolide treatment effectively alleviated oedema, proteinuria and foot process effacement. Triptolide also inhibited podocyte apoptosis in our zebrafish model and in vitro. We also examined the mechanism of triptolide protection of podocyte. Whole-genome expression profiles of cultured podocytes demonstrated that triptolide treatment downregulated apoptosis pathway-related GADD45B expression. Specific overexpression of gadd45b in zebrafish podocytes abolished the protective effects of triptolide. GADD45B is a mediator of podocyte apoptosis that contains typical NF-κB binding sites in the promoter region, and NF-κB p65 primarily transactivates this gene. Triptolide inhibited NF-κB signalling activation and binding of NF-κB to the GADD45B promoter. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that triptolide attenuated proteinuria and podocyte apoptosis via inhibition of NF-κB/GADD45B signalling, which provides a new understanding of the antiproteinuric effects of triptolide in glomerular diseases.",

        "abstract": "The Labudalin basin is a Mesozoic unsymmetrical fault depression basin located in the Paleozoic orogenic belt in Inner Mongolia-Da Hinggan Ling area.The Lower Cretaceous and Quaternary depositional systems are well developed in the basin.Structural features of Labudalin basin are very complex.There are three groups of structures in NE direction,NEE direction and NW direction,respectively.The NE-trending structures are mainly a series of listric normal faults and associated normal faults in the same direction.The NEE-trending structures are shear-normal faults.The NE-and NEE-trending faults were formed in the same stress field during the depositional periods of Tamulangou Formation-Yiliekede Formation and have different characteristics.The NW-trending faults are late sinistral strike-slip normal faults cutting the NE-and NEE-trending faults.The Labudalin basin experienced three times of deformation during the Lower Cretaceous:① The NW-NE extension from the Tamulangou Formation depositional period to the Yiliekede Formation depositional period;② The NW-NE compression in the Damoguaihe Formation depositional period;③ The nearly EW extension in the Yimin Formation depositional period.",

Patients were divided into two groups according to age: adults aged more than 17 years and children aged less than 15 years.The incidence of APSGN, especially in adults, has decreased in the past three decades. Children have had a higher incidence of macroscopic haematuria than adults (58.3% vs 32.7%, P < 0.05). Laboratory test showed that red blood cell count of urine sediment in children was more significant. On light microscopy, adults had more global glomerulosclerosis, tubular basement membrane thickening, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, while children had more glomerular infiltrating neutrophils and monocytes and cellular casts. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that classical staining was seen more in children. The short-term prognoses were good in both children and adults. But the recovery rate of proteinuria in children was faster than that in adults.Adults with APSGN had similar clinical features as children except that children had more significant haematuria. On pathology, adults had more outstanding chronic changes by light microscopy and more untypical staining by immunofluorescence.",

A theoretical model for the voltage responsivity of the transistor THz detector with a resonant cavity was derived and verified experimentally using a GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) with the FP cavity formed between the GaN HEMT substrate and an indium tin oxide mirror. The measured detector responsivity shows 2.5 times enhancement compared to the device without the cavity and lower noise equivalent power. The performance of the GaN HEMT THz detector with a FP cavity, which has a designed quality factor of 16, is dependent on the incident angle of the THz radiation.",

        "abstract": "Alport syndrome (AS) is an inherited nephropathy characterized by glomerular basement membrane (GBM) abnormalities due to mutations in the type IV collagen genes. Through immunofluorescence analysis, the absence of alpha3(IV), alpha4(IV) and alpha5(IV) chains within the GBM has been shown in the majority of AS cases. In some atypical AS cases, however, staining of the GBM with antibodies against the alpha3(IV), alpha4(IV) and alpha5(IV) chains appeared normal. In this study, we studied these atypical AS cases by quantitative analysis of the expression of type IV collagen subchains in GBM.Twelve patients diagnosed with AS, yet having normal staining for alpha3(IV) and alpha5(IV) chains in the GBM, were recruited. Quantitative analysis of type IV collagen subchains in the GBM was performed using confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence double label techniques.The absolute amounts of alpha3(IV), alpha4(IV) and alpha5(IV) were significantly lower in AS patients than that in normal subjects, associated with up-regulated expression of type IV collagen in GBM. It was found that eight cases had decreased ratios of alpha3(IV)/IV, alpha4(IV)/IV and alpha5(IV)/IV in the GBM simultaneously; one had reduced levels of alpha3(IV)/IV and alpha5(IV)/IV but had a normal level of alpha4(IV)/IV, and one had reduced alpha3(IV)/IV with normal alpha4(IV)/IV and alpha5(IV)/IV levels. The remaining two patients had normal ratios of alpha3(IV)/IV, alpha4(IV)/IV and alpha5(IV)/IV.Confocal analysis demonstrated for the first time that the ratios of alpha3(IV)/IV, alpha4(IV)/IV and alpha5(IV)/IV in the GBM decreased in patients with AS, even though routine immunofluorescence staining for alpha(IV) chains appeared normal. This result not only sheds light on the pathogenesis of AS, but also provides an alternative approach to diagnose atypical AS cases.",

Objective: To investigate pathological features and clinical characteristics of BKVAN. Methods: Polyomavirus large T antigen staining of 121 transplant renal biopsy showed that nine cases were positively diagnosed as having BKVAN. Clinical, pathologic, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry observation of BKVAN patients were performed by anti-SV40 large T antibody staining. Results and Conclusion: Mycophenolic acid-AUC 0-12 and tacrolimus blood concentration in the BKVAN group were higher than those in the no BKVAN group (P < 0.05). SV-40 large T antigen staining of nine cases of biopsy showed that there were scattered positive tubular polyomaviruses in the renal cortex and medulla. Immunofluorescence staining showed the negative expression of IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C4, C1q and C4d. All the renal histopathological observation showed that a large number of CD3, CD4 and CD8, CD68-positive cells were aggregated in the renal interstitial. In one case of merge rejection, human leukocyte antigen DR and interleukin-2 receptor were highly expressed. However, the expressions of human leukocyte antigen DR and interleukin-2 receptor in non-merge rejection patients were almost less than 5%. The follow-up of nine cases of BKVAN was more than 6 months, one case of renal allograft dysfunction, three cases improved, two cases of stable and three cases of deterioration. Immunohistochemistry with SV-40 large T antigen staining is used as an indirect method to document the presence of BKVAN. There is an extremely important clinical value of kidney allograft C4d, interleukin-2 receptor and human leukocyte antigen DR detection in the diagnosis of BKVAN.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Background and aims  Increasing evidence has shown the critical role of long non-coding RNA cytoskeleton regulator (CYTOR) in cancers. The expression of CYTOR is reported to be up-regulated in many kinds of cancers, such as gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, colon cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. Here, we summarized related studies and performed a meta-analysis to investigate the prognostic value of CYTOR in multiple cancers.    Methods  Eligible studies were retrieved from PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases, and the role of CYTOR in cancers was evaluated by pooled odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The results were further validated using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset.    Results  Our results showed that elevated CYTOR expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients (overall survival, HR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.73–2.38, P     Conclusion  Overall, this study indicates that CYTOR may serve as a prognostic biomarker for cancer patients during the follow-up.",

The effects of initial mass concentrations of Cu(II) ions (ρ(Cu 2+) 0), Cd(II) ions (ρ(Cd 2+) 0), dosage of zinc dust, temperature and stirring speed on the rate of cobalt removal and the purities of the zinc sulfate solution were examined. The results show that adding a certain amount of Cu(II) ions not only increases the cobalt removal rate together with the purities of zinc sulfate solution, but also saves the dosage of zinc dust used in the purification process. It is also validated that adding Cu(II) and Cd(II) ions at the same time behaves a better effect of cobalt removal than adding Cu(II) ions solely. The optimal conditions for cobalt removal are obtained as follows: ρ(Cu 2+) 0 15 mg/L, ρ(Cd 2+) 0 15 mg/L, antimony potassium tartrate 3 mg/L, zinc dust dosage 2 g/L, temperature 85°C and stirring speed 300 r/min.",

Methods:Cervical carcinoma tissues with different clinical stages were collected respectively. Total protein from cervical carcinoma tissues were extracted; differential proteome profiles were established and analyzed by means of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE),matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spec-trometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and bioinformatics analysis. Part of proteins expression were assayed by Western Blot and immunohisto-chemical method. Results:Well-resolved,reproducible 2-DE profiles of human cervical carcinoma tissues were obtained. Average pro-tein dots were 1098±23,1142±21 in early-stage and medium-advanced stage respectively; By analyzing and by mass spectrometry and bioinformatics,8 of them were well characterized. Compared to early stage group,4 proteins were low-expressed in early-stage group,in-cluding Hemoglobin subunit beta HB,caspase-14,galectin-7,CK19; 4 protein were highly expressed in medium-advanced stage,including NMP238,HSP70,Calmodulin-like 5,S100A9. S100A9 expressed higher in medium-advanced stage group than in early-stage group and CK expressed higher in early-stage stage group than in medium-advanced group.

It was found that VN nanoparticles adhered to the surface of nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets and/or were embedded in the graphene layers of the hybrid material (VN-G). This nanostructured material promises an efficient electronic and ionic conducting network, which exhibits dramatically increased specific capacities after rate capability test in comparison to the original value under the same current density. The most probable explanations for these distinct characteristics are deduced from observations by advanced transmission electron microscopy together with X-ray diffraction and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, which illustrate a gradual activation of nitride during lithiation/delithiation processes, owing to slow kinetics of VN reaction with lithium. The electrochemical results demonstrate that the weight ratio of VN to G has a significant effect on the performance and related kinetics of the materials. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.",

        "abstract": "Owing to its non-selectivity, plasma exchange has limited use in the treatment of patients with hepatic failure, although it is effective in removal of protein-bound toxins. This study reports a novel way to perform selective albumin exchange (SAE) by using a secondary plasma separator and aims to study its depurative capacity in the removal of bilirubin.In ex vivo experiments, the sieving coefficients (SCs) of plasma proteins for two secondary plasma separators, EC20W and EC30W (Asahi Medical, Tokyo, Japan), were measured. The EC20W membrane was chosen for use in clinical treatment because of its higher selectivity in separating albumin from plasma than the EC30W. The SCs of albumin, immunoglobumin G, A and M (IgG, IgA, IgM) for the EC20W were 0.3+/-0.021, 0.017+/-0.012, and 0, respectively. Five inpatients with plasma total bilirubin (TB) more than 200 micromol/L were enrolled in the present study and received a total of 10 SAE therapy sessions. Each session lasted 10 hours. SAE using the EC20W was conducted, making it similar to post-dilution continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), with a filtrate rate of 2000 ml/h. Replacement fluid was composed by adding human albumin into conventional CVVH replacement fluid, with a final albumin concentration of 0.6%. During each treatment, the parameters of plasma and filtrate TB, direct bilirubin (DB), indirect bilirubin (IDB), and proteins were dynamically monitored. Hemostasis parameters were measured before and after sessions.The reduction ratio of plasma TB, DB, and IDB after a single session was 29.1+/-3.0%, 31.3+/-4.5%, and 18.7+/-10.2%, respectively. The clearance of TB at initiation was 11.1+/-1.3 mL/min and declined to 4.4+/-0.5 ml/min at the end (p<0.01). This decline was accompanied by a reduction in albumin SC from 0.3+/-0.021 to 0.13+/-0.05. The molar ratio of bilirubin to albumin in filtrate was comparable to that in plasma. After a single treatment, plasma protein concentration including total protein, albumin, IgA and IgM remained unaffected, except for globulin and IgG, which were reduced by 11.5+/-7.8% and 11.1+/-2.3%, respectively. An improvement in hemostasis parameters, including plasma fibrinogen, prothrombase time and INR, was found after treatment. No obvious side effects were reported during any of the sessions.Selective albumin exchange is a simple and effective method to remove bilirubin. However, further studies are required to verify its effects on clinical outcome.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of peritoneal dialysis (PD) in patients with severe lupus nephritis (LN) complicated with organ dysfunction. In total, 13 severe LN patients complicated with multiple-organ dysfunction, who underwent PD treatment between November 2003 and September 2010, were enrolled in the study. Six patients received methylprednisolone pulse therapy due to lupus activity and progressive renal failure. These patients were complicated with severe edema, cardiac insufficiency and severe hypoalbuminemia. PD was applied to the patients, followed by the administration of immunosuppressants. Patients were followed-up to review the parameters of renal function, the immunological indexes and the systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index. The results indicated that the general state of health was markedly improved following PD treatment, with edema abatement and improvement of heart function and physical strength. Serum creatinine levels significantly decreased from 6.3±1.6 to 2.6±1.0 mg/dl. A total of 10 cases ceased PD treatment during the follow-up, while three cases continued PD to the end of the follow-up period. The levels of albumin and hemoglobin exhibited a marked increase from 29.7±5.7 to 35.2±5.5 g/l and 8.7±1.8 to 9.8±1.8 g/l, respectively. There was one case of peritonitis, one case of peritoneal leakage and two cases of pneumonia. Therefore, PD may be a successful treatment method for severe LN patients complicated with essential organ dysfunction. PD not only improved the symptoms of edema and heart failure, but also played an important role in preserving residual renal function and improving the nutritional state of the patients. Thus, PD can be considered as a treatment option for patients with severe LN associated with acute kidney injury, however, selecting a suitable immunosuppressant during PD treatment is essential.",

        "abstract": "Graphene with a large area was synthesized on Cu foils by chemical vapor deposition under ambient pressure. A 4″ × 4″ graphene film was transferred onto a 6″ Si wafer with a thermally grown oxide film. Raman mapping indicates monolayer graphene dominates the transferred graphene film. Gas sensors were fabricated on a 4 mm × 3 mm size graphene film with a 1 nm palladium film deposited for hydrogen detection. Hydrogen in air with concentrations in 0.0025–1% (25–10,000 ppm) was used to test graphene-based gas sensors. The gas sensors based on palladium-decorated graphene films show high sensitivity, fast response and recovery, and can be used with multiple cycles. The mechanism of hydrogen detection is also discussed. Keywords Graphene Chemical vapor deposition Gas sensor 1 Introduction Graphene [1,2] , a single atomic layer of graphite, is the building block of all sp 2 bonded carbon materials including graphite as well as carbon nanotubes. The explosion of recent interests in graphene is in a large part due to its exceptional electronic properties [3–8] demonstrated experimentally and its potential application, such as nanoelectronic devices [9] and chemical/bio-sensors [10,11] . While the first electrically isolated graphene was fabricated by mechanical exfoliation of graphite [7] , a large amount of recent effort has been devoted to develop methods to synthesize graphene at large scale for practical electronic applications. A variety of methods, such as epitaxial growth on SiC [12,13] , chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on metals [14–21] , and numerous solution-based chemical approaches [22–25] have been explored. One of the most important and challenging goals is to grow graphene at large scale with uniform thickness [13,18] . Carbon materials are useful as chemical/bio-sensors since the environmental sensitivity of carbon-based molecules can be efficiently tailored by synthetic chemistry techniques [26] . Chemical/bio-sensors based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have already been extensively studied in a decade [27–30] . However, the diversity in CNTs’ structure and chirality may lead to varied device characteristics, and thereby cause device reliability issues [31] . On the contrary, graphene has a great potential to resolve these problems. Graphene is a strictly two-dimensional (2D) material and, as such, enables devices based on graphene to have an identical performance on a large scale. The fabrication of chemical/bio-sensors in field effect transistor type structures based on graphene in large scale is also simpler than that of SWNT. In addition, with the 2D structure, the monolayer graphene has its whole volume exposed to the environment, which can maximize the sensing effect. The principle of graphene devices is based on changes in device conductance due to chemical or biological species adsorbed on the surface of graphene, acting as electron donors or acceptors. Recently, graphene-based gas molecule sensors and biosensors have been reported [10,11,32] . In this paper, we report wafer-scale synthesis of monolayer graphene by CVD under ambient pressure and explore its application in gas sensors. With the progress of synthesis of wafer-scale graphene with uniform thickness, sensors based on the graphene are expected to have an identical performance. Therefore, the commercialization of graphene-base chemical/bio-sensors could be realizable. 2 Experimental 2.1 Graphene growth and Raman characterization Graphene was synthesized on Cu foils and transferred to Si/SiO 2 wafers using procedures analogous to those in published literature [18] and in our previous work [14,15,21] . Briefly, the procedure is described as follows. Graphene was grown by thermal CVD on a Cu foil, at a temperature of 1000 °C and under 1 atm pressure with methane as the precursor gas. A quartz tube with 2″ diameter was used as the reaction chamber for our CVD system. Cu foils were rolled up in a roll, but without the rolled-up layers touching to each other. Following the growth, PMMA was spun on graphene/Cu substrate to form PMMA/graphene/Cu sandwich structure. Later, Cu foil was etched away using an iron nitrate aqua solution. After the Cu foil was completely etched away, graphene with PMMA/graphene film was transferred onto a Si wafer with 300 nm thermally grown SiO 2 . The PMMA was then removed by repeatedly rinsing the film in acetone. Our Raman measurements were performed with a Horiba LabRam confocal Raman microscope with a motorized sample stage for Raman mapping. The wavelength of the excitation laser used was 532 nm and the power kept low enough (typically on the order of 1mW at the sample surface) in the “linear” regime, that is, further reducing the power would not give appreciable change in the intensity ratios (defined below) between relevant Raman bands (but will give more noise in the spectra). The laser spot size is ∼0.6 μm for the 100× objective used. 2.2 Gas sensor device fabrication and testing The schematic view of a hydrogen sensor based on Pd modified graphene is shown in Fig. 1 a . CVD grown graphene with a typical size of 3 mm × 4 mm was transferred onto a highly doped Si wafer covered by a 300 nm-thick SiO 2 film. The graphene sample on SiO 2 /Si was then decorated with a thin Pd film (1 nm thickness) using electron beam evaporation. To define the contacts, Ti/Au (5 nm/100 nm) films were also deposited by electron beam evaporation through a shadow mask. Subsequently, the sensor sample was assembled into a chip carrier by wire bonding, as shown in Fig. 1 b. The sensor devices were characterized in a home-made testing chamber flowing a mixture of hydrogen and air with a flow rate of 5000 sccm at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. The concentration of hydrogen was varied by controlling the flow rates of the two gases using MKS mass flow controllers. The variation of sensor resistance was measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter. The carrier type and carrier density in our graphene sensor were characterized in hydrogen environment at different concentrations by Hall effect measurements. For Hall effect measurements, a square graphene sample (1 cm × 1 cm) with Ti/Au contacts at four corners was placed in a glass tube with gas inlet and outlet. The glass tube was entirely covered by black tapes to eliminate the influence of light in the environment. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Raman characterization Raman spectroscopy is a powerful, yet relatively simple method to characterize the thickness and crystalline quality of graphene layers [17–19] . We have performed Raman spectroscopy and Raman mapping on the CVD graphene films transferred to SiO 2 /Si. In particular, we have used spatially resolved Raman measurements to probe the uniformity of our large-scale CVD graphene. Fig. 2 a–c shows a representative Raman map showing the intensity of D, G and 2D bands measured in a 10 μm × 10 μm area of a CVD graphene sample (the corresponding optical microscope image of the scanned area is shown as the inset of Fig. 2 a). To extract the intensity of a given band, I x (where x = D, G, or 2D), we performed a best Lorentzian ( f ( x ) = y 0 + A w / ( w 2 + 4 ( x − x 0 ) 2 ) ) fit to the peak over the corresponding range. The intensity ( I x ) is defined by the amplitude value ( A / w ) of the Lorentzian function fit. We used intervals 1320–1380, 1560–1620 and 2640–2720 cm −1 as the range of the D, G, and 2D bands for the Lorentzian function fit, respectively. By comparing Fig. 3 a–c , we can learn that the intensity maps of G and 2D bands are correlated, while the intensity map of D band (signal from defects) is not correlated to those of G and 2D bands (both signals from graphene lattice). In the sample, the locations where G band has a high density are also the locations where 2D band has a high density. The possible reason is the spatially non-uniform adhesion. The images by He ion microscope (not shown here), indicates the transferred graphene does not spatially uniformly adhere to the substrate. The adhesion between graphene and a substrate can affect the intensity of Raman spectra. However, D band is always low owing to the high quality of the graphene and it intends to show a noisy feature. Fig. 2 d shows the Raman map of I D / I G of the same area scanned in Fig. 2 a. The mean value of I D / I G is less than 0.1, which indicate low defect density in the graphene film. It is known that I 2D / I G is a sensitive probe of the number of graphene layers [17–19] . For example, our measurements (under similar experimental conditions as we used in Fig. 2 ) on exfoliated graphene layers gave typical I 2D / I G ∼2–3 for monolayer samples and I 2D / I G slightly lower than 1 for bilayers. Previous studies [18] of CVD-grown graphene (transferred from Cu) have taken a I 2D / I G ∼2 to indicate monolayer graphene, 2 > I 2D / I G > 1 for bilayer and I 2D / I G < 1 for multilayers (it has also been noted that due to possible stacking disorder, it can be more difficult to determine the exact number of CVD-grown graphene layers from the Raman spectrum compared with exfoliated graphene [19] ). We find that ∼99% of the area mapped show I 2D / I G > 2, ∼93% of the area mapped show I 2D / I G > 3 and about half of the area show I 2D / I G > 4 (the medium value). Based on our I 2D / I G data, we conclude that most of the area mapped is monolayer graphene. We also notice that, even in locations with I 2D / I G > 2, believed to indicate monolayer, we can still observe substantial variation in I 2D / I G (as seen, for example, in several Raman spectra in Fig. 2 f measured from the corresponding marked spots in Fig. 2 e). We speculate that one possible reason for this variation and sometimes very large I 2D / I G (e.g. >5) may also be the spatially non-uniform adhesion between the transferred graphene film and the underlying substrate (SiO 2 ), as the graphene-substrate interaction could strongly affect I 2D / I G [33] . The adhesion can significantly affect G and 1D band, but with different extents. The disorder-induced D band in the spectra shown in Fig. 2 f is seen to be very small, indicating high crystalline quality of the graphene. We have also obtained qualitatively similar Raman maps from many areas randomly selected from different locations of a large-scale CVD graphene film. Several of these areas have been subsequently fabricated into devices and an independent and more unambiguous verification of monolayer graphene has been performed using quantum Hall measurements [14] . Our results suggest that our CVD graphene films have excellent quality and uniformity, consisting mainly of monolayer. 3.2 Hydrogen sensor properties and sensor mechanism The hydrogen sensing capability is experimentally tested by recording sensor resistance change when the sensor is exposed to hydrogen gas with different concentrations. The sensor sensitivity is defined by sensitivity = ( R peak − R 0 )/ R 0 × 100%, where R peak is the highest sensor resistance in hydrogen gas and R 0 is the resistance in air. Fig. 3 a shows the percentage of the sensor resistance change to various hydrogen concentrations from 0.0025% to 1% (25–10,000 ppm). The concentrations in details are labeled above each peak in Fig. 3 a. Before turning on hydrogen, only air flowed through the testing chamber. After turning on hydrogen, the resistance of the graphene sensor increased with time upon the exposure to hydrogen. After 300 s, hydrogen was shut off and only air flowed through the testing chamber for several hundred seconds to let the resistance recover the original level. The graphene sensor was tested in hydrogen with varied concentrations in the order from low to high concentrations. We also tested the graphene sensors without Pd deposition and could not observe non-trivial change of the sensor's resistivity. The sensitivity of the sensor to hydrogen concentration is roughly linear in a logarithm coordinate, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3 a. The hydrogen sensor shows more than 10% increase of resistance to the exposure to 1% hydrogen concentration. For much lower concentration of hydrogen (minimum 0.0025% (25 ppm) hydrogen in the case investigated), there is also an observable signal with a corresponding resistance increase of 0.2%. As the hydrogen concentration decreases, the number of adsorbed hydrogen molecules is reduced, and therefore, the corresponding sensitivity also decreases. The response and recovery times are defined as the time durations to reach 90% of the range of resistance change since the beginning of H 2 gas flow and end of H 2 gas flow, respectively. Whenever the sensor is exposed to hydrogen, a quick increase of resistance is observed. For example, for the sensor response to 0.05% (500 ppm) hydrogen, the response time is 213 s and the resistance of the sensor increased 1% in less than 30 s. After tuning hydrogen off, the resistance decrease fast and the measured recovery time is 463 s. Fig. 4 b shows the sensor response to 0.05% (500 ppm) hydrogen concentration for six cycles. The sensitivity measured is around 4.10% for each cycle. The resistance of the sensor recovers to its original value within 10 min when hydrogen gas is completely closed and the test chamber is purged with air. We also used argon to purge the sample after turning off hydrogen and found that the sensor's resistance recovered much slower. The sensing mechanism of gas sensors based on graphene can be attributed to the change of carrier density in graphene induced by palladium hydride (PdH x ). With Pd deposition on graphene by electron beam evaporation, discrete Pd nanoparticles form on graphene. When the Pd-decorated graphene is exposed to hydrogen, Pd atoms can be converted to PdH x . PdH x on graphene has an electrical dipole structure [34] , i.e. the charge is positive at hydrogen side and electrons accumulates at the interface between Pd and carbon. According to Hall effect measurements, our CVD graphene samples were found to be p-type, which is common in as-fabricated graphene devices [7] . The electrons accumulating at the interface of Pd and graphene can neutralize holes in graphene, therefore, reduce the p-type carrier density. Fig. 4 shows that the p-type carrier density decreases with concentration of hydrogen in air in the range of 0–0.1%. Lower carrier density is the reason that resistance increases with hydrogen concentration. The formation of dipole structure by PdH x plays a critical role in hydrogen sensing for our graphene sensors. According to our testing results of graphene sensor without Pd deposition, hydrogen only has very limited interaction directly with graphene. Increased resistivity with hydrogen concentration has also been observed in CNTs-based hydrogen sensors [34–36] . The resistance of our sensor exposed to hydrogen recovered much slower in pure argon than in air. It is expected that oxygen in air greatly enhances the decomposition of PdH x , which can be described as 1/4O 2 + Pd active /H → Pd active + 1/2H 2 O [34] . It should also be noticed that Pd is a catalyst to decompose H 2 . However, it is hard to form chemisorption between graphene and hydrogen radical at room temperature [35] . Therefore, it is hard for the graphene/H 2 to interact to induce the change of sensor conductance. 4 Conclusion We synthesized graphene with a large area on a Cu foil at a temperature of 1000 °C under 1 atm pressure with methane as the precursor gas by thermal CVD. Although only 4″ × 4″ graphene film was demonstrated, the size of graphene film, which can be synthesized by this approach, is not limited by the size of CVD chamber at all owing to the rolled-up Cu foil during synthesis. Raman spectrum shows 99% area of the film has ratio of 2D band to G band larger than 2, which indicates most of film is a monolayer. Thanks to the synthesis of wafer-scale graphene with uniform thickness, sensors based on the graphene are expected to have an identical performance comparing with other nanomaterials, such as CNTs. Hydrogen sensors were demonstrated on Pd-decorated CVD graphene films. The hydrogen sensors show high sensitivity, fast response and recovery, and are usable for multiple cycles. The mechanism of hydrogen detection can be attributed to carrier density in graphene induced by PdH x .

        "abstract": "Chronic tubulointerstitial injury impacts the prognosis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). We found that the level of versican V1 was increased in tubular cells of FSGS patients. Tubular cell-derived versican V1 induced proliferation and collagen synthesis by activating the CD44/Smad3 pathway in fibroblasts. Both urine C3a and suPAR were increased and bound to the tubular cells in FSGS patients. C3a promoted the transcription of versican by activating the AKT/β-catenin pathway. C3aR knockout decreased the expression of versican in Adriamycin-treated (ADR-treated) mice. On the other hand, suPAR bound to integrin β6 and activated Rac1, which bound to SRp40 at the 5' end of exon 7 in versican pre-mRNA. This binding inhibited the 3'-end splicing of intron 6 and the base-pair interactions between intron 6 and intron 8, leading to the formation of versican V1. Cotreatment with ADR and suPAR specifically increased the level of versican V1 in tubulointerstitial tissues and caused more obvious interstitial fibrosis in mice than treatment with only ADR. Altogether, our results show that C3a and suPAR drive versican V1 expression in tubular cells by promoting transcription and splicing, respectively, and the increases in tubular cell-derived versican V1 induce interstitial fibrosis by activating fibroblasts in FSGS.",

        "abstract": "A key pre-distribution scheme is a method by which initially an off-line trusted authority distributes pieces of information among a set of users. Later, each member of a group of users can compute a common key for secure communication. In this paper we present an Asymmetric Key Predistribution Scheme. Instead of assuming that the network is comprised entirely of identical users in conventional key predistribution schemes, the network now consists of a mix of users with different missions, i.e., ordinary users and keying material servers. A group of users, using secret keys preloaded in their memory and public keying material retrieved from one keying material server, can compute a session key. The properties of this method are that, the compromise of keying material servers does not reveal any information about users' secret keys and the session keys of privileged subset of users; if computational assumptions are considered, each user has very low storage requirement. These properties make it attractive for sensor networks. We first formally define the asymmetric key pre-distribution scheme in terms of the entropy and give lower bounds on user's storage requirement and the public keying material size. Then, we present its constructions and applications for sensor networks.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To investigate the value of peripheral blood circulating endothelial cells(CECs) on the diagnosis and the short-term outcome of acute rejection(AR) in patients with renal allograft. Methodology:Total fourty two renal transplant patients received renal allograft biopsy from Nov.2006 to Dec.2007 were investigated in this study.They were divided into two groups: group I(normal group,n=17) and group II(AR group,n=25).Then the group II was separated into group II-A(acute vascular rejection group,n=5),group II-B(mixed rejection group,n=7) and group II-C(acute tubulointerstitial rejection group,n=13).The CECs were isolated from peripheral blood and were counted by microscopy during the renal biopsy time. Results:The count of CECs was higher in group II than that in group I(27.0±13.6 vs 14.6 ±4.20,P<0.01),in group II-A higher than that in group II-C(32.6±15.9 vs 19.5±9.50,P<0.01)and no significant difference between group II-A and group II-B(P>0.05).The count of CECs in group II-C was higher than group I with no significant difference(P>0.05).The increasing count of CECs(CECs ≥24 cells/ml)was related to endarteritis(P<0.01).The steroid resistant rate of high CECs count was higher than that of low CECs count(CECs <24 cells/ml)in group II(9/14 vs 3/11,P<0.05).The one year graft survival of patients with high CECs count was worse than that with low CECs count(P<0.05).The count of CECs was decreased significantly with the recovery of renal allograft function in group II-A(P<0.01). Conclusion:The count of CECs in peripheral blood was related to the AR,and also related to the endarteritis in renal allograft.It might be used as a differential diagnosis marker for the AR and a marker for the prognosis of AR.",

The structures and electrochemical properties of GO/MWCNTs are investigated by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. GO/MWCNTs are shown to be cross-linked and form an electrocatalytic hybrid with an effective mixed conducting network, leading to efficiently fast ion and electron transport characteristics. Compared with the pure GO nanosheets and MWCNTs, GO/MWCNTs deliver a much better electrocatalytic redox reversibility towards the positive VO 2+/ VO 2 + couple, especially for the reduction from VO 2 + to VO 2+. The excellent experimental results demonstrate that the newly developed hybrid material holds great promise in the application of VRFB. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) model using two-photon excitable small organic molecule DMAHAS as energy donor has been constructed and tried in an assay for avidin. In the FRET model, biotin was conjugated to the FRET donor, and avidin was labeled with a dark quencher DABS-Cl. Binding of DABS-Cl labeled avidin to biotinylated DMAHAS resulted in the quenching of fluorescence emission of the donor, based on which a competitive assay for free avidin was established. With using such donors that are excited in IR region, it is capable of overcoming some primary shortcomings of conventional one-photon FRET methods, especially in bioassays, such as the interference from background fluorescence or scattering light, the coexcitation of the energy acceptor with the donor. And such small molecules also show advantages over inorganic up-converting particles that also give anti-Stokes photoluminescence and have been applied as FRET donor recently. The results of this work suggest that two-photon excitable small molecules could be a promising energy donor for FRET-based bioassays.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the effects of triptolide on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and secretion by endothelial cells, and explore the mechanism of anti-proteinuric effect of triptolide on glomerulonephritis. METHODS: A human umbilical endothelium derived cell line (ECV-304) from American Type Culture Collecttion (ATCC) was used in this study. The effects of triptolide on VEGF mRNA expression, production, and secretion induced by 12-o-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were measured by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), flow cytometry, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively. The endothelial c-fos/c-jun mRNA expression were also detected by RT-PCR after treatment of triptolide. RESULTS: VEGF mRNA expression was markedly up-regulated by TPA-stimulation. In addition, the production and secretion of VEGF in endothelial cells also increased in TPA treated cells. It was founded that triptolide inhibited VEGF mRNA expression, protein production and secretion in endothelial cells induced by TPA. Interestingly, TPA-induced c-fos/c-jun mRNA expression in endothelial cells was also inhibited by triptolide. CONCLUSION: Triptolide is a potent inhibitor of VEGF expression and production in endothelial cells. The inhibitory effects of triptolide on VEGF expression and production can contribute to its anti-proteinuric effect on glomerulonephritis. Down-regulation of c-fos/c-jun expression in endothelial cells by triptolide is one of the mechanisms of the inhibitory effect of triptolide on VEGF expression.",

However, the underlying mechanisms are not understood. We aimed to observe whether patients with OSA had unfavorable cardiovascular responses to stress, which were risk factors for the development of hypertension.Methods: A retrospective study was carried out to observe OSA patients’ responses to stress through comparing their blood pressure and heart rate changes before, during and after coronary angiography in the sleep laboratory of center for pulmonary vascular diseases, Fuwai Hospital. Results: Fifty-six coronary artery disease patients with OSA and 18 coronary artery disease patients without OSA (No-OSA) were enrolled. In OSA patients, systolic blood pressure response to coronary angiography was exaggerated and diastolic blood pressure recovery was delayed compared with the No-OSA (P=0.047). No differences were noted in the heart rate response to coronary angiography between two groups. The increase in SBP during CAG was negatively correlated to 90% SaO2 (r=-0.222, p=0.031) and positively correlated to sleepiness score (r=0.257, p=0.028), but not related to AHI, ODI, and the lowest SaO2.Conclusions: Cardiovascular responses to coronary angiography in OSA patients were abnormal, reflected by an exaggerated systolic blood pressure response and delayed diastolic pressure recovery, which were associated with hypoxia and may play a role in cardiovascular complications of OSA patients.",

Immunocytochemistry was employed to detect HPV L1 capsid protein, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to detect the hTERC.The expression of HPV L1 capsid protein reduced with the increase of the histological grade of cervical cells and was negatively related to the grade of cervical lesions. However, the expression of hTERC increased with the increase of the histological grade and positively associated with the grade of cervical lesions. The proportion of patients with L1(-)/hTERC(+) was higher in patients with histological grade of CIN2 or higher than that in those with histological grade of CIN1. The L1(+)/hTERC(-) and L1(-)/hTERC(-) were negatively related to the grade of cervical lesions. L1(-)/hTERC(+) was positively associated with the grade of cervical lesions. The L1/hTERC ratio increased. The negative predictive value of both HPV L1 and hTERC was higher than that of HPV L1 or hTERC, but there was no marked difference in the screening efficacy of cervical cancer among HPV L1, hTERC and HPV L1+hTERC.HPV L1 capsid protein and hTERC gene may serve as markers for the early diagnosis and prediction of cervical lesions. The increase in L1/hTERC ratio reflects the progression of cervical lesions to a certain extent.",

We evaluated the efficacy of an aggressive systemic protocol including strategies improving body's immune function. Twenty-one recipients were enrolled in this study. Patients were subjected to a protocol including (i) withdrawal of most immunosuppressants, (ii) early use of immunoenhancers and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), (iii) reasonable administration of antibiotic regimen, (iv) prompt mechanical ventilating strategy, and (v) adequate nutrition. Immunosuppressants were adjusted according to the value of CD4+, CD8+T lymphocytes in peripheral blood. CRRT was conducted at once when patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), regardless the graft function. Thirteen (62%) survived and eight died finally. This is a high survival rate for this kind of patients. Eighteen patients had received thymosin treatment. All patients who survived experienced renal allograft dysfunction during CRRT, but when CRRT stopped, the function of all grafts gradually recovered. No acute rejection episodes were documented during the treatment. The aggressive systemic protocol including strategies improving the body's immune function and CRRT can improve the outcome of patients with ARDS after renal transplantation. The count of CD4+, CD8+T lymphocytes of peripheral blood is useful in the adjustment of immunosuppressants and the prediction of patient outcome.",

The results have shown that β-CD- hemin is the best mimetic enzyme for peroxidase among those tested, and that DEA is a quite good substrate for β-CD-hemin. Meanwhile, the chromogenic reaction rate and sensitivity of 4-AAP-DEA-β-CD-hemin system for determination of hydrogen peroxide were investigated. Zero to 8.4x10-5 M hydrogen peroxide was determined with good accuracy and reproducibility. The molar-absorption coefficient of the chromogenic compound for hydrogen peroxide determined was found to be 1.65x104 mol l-1 cm-1.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   As an important trait influencing meat quality, the deposition of Intramuscular fat (IMF) is affected by preadipocyte differentiation. Nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorγ( PPARγ ) plays an important role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. In this study, lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) was applied to inhibit  PPARγ  gene expression, which can explore the effects of  PPARγ  silencing on the preadipose of cashmere goats in vitro. The roles of  PPARγ  gene in proliferation and differentiation of adipocytes were investigated by MTT assay and Oil Red O staining extraction assay. Using Real-time PCR and Western blotting analyses, the gene expression levels in goat adipocytes were detected at 24, 36, 48 and 72 h after transfection. By the high-throughput sequencing, the comparative transcriptome analysis of four different samples including preadipocyte, adipocyte, shRNA-  PPARγ  intramuscular fat cell and control group in Cashmere goats was performed. The results showed that  PPARγ  gene could increase proliferation of goat adipocyte, but decrease their differentiation. The novel genes screened with 152, 450, 456, 412, 39 and 445 different expressions by high-throughput sequencing. The genes, such as  PREF-1, PREF-1, FGF ,  TGF, TNF, RA, IL-21  and  EGF  had higher expression in shRNA- PPARγ  intramuscular fat cells. The 10 pathways that related to adipocyte differentiation were discovered by GO and KEGG analysis. The most significant pathways involved in PPARγ, WNT, mTOR, and MAPK signaling. Some key gens including  LPL, FABP, FATP, AP2, RXRG and CD36  were enriched in PPARγ signal pathway. All of these findings will provide a new reference for understanding adipose transcriptome and identifying novel pathways regulating adipose physiology.",

        "abstract": "Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, for patients who already have OSA and coronary heart diseases (CHD) with optimal medications, whether CPAP can reduce the blood pressure (BP) is not clear. This is a controlled study to evaluate the effects of CPAP on BP in Chinese cohorts with CHD under optimal medications.Twenty-four patients with CHD and moderate to severe OSA were treated with CPAP and standard care for 1 month. Twenty-four matched control patients were only treated with standard care alone. Baseline demographic data as well as sleep study data was recorded in all patients. Office blood pressure, heart rate, Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) score, and quality of life (SF-36) of the two groups were compared after 1-month treatment.Compared with control group, CPAP treatment markedly reduced the morning diastolic BP (Δ -0.8 ± 6.0 vs. Δ -5.1 ± 6.5, respectively, P = 0.023) and improved ESS scores (Δ -0.5 ± 3.2 vs. Δ -5.2 ± 3.1, P < 0.001). In contrast, there were no significant changes in systolic BP (Δ -0.3 ± 7.3 vs. Δ -3.8 ± 11.8, P = 0.225), heart rate, and quality of life.CPAP treatment for 1 month was associated with significant reduction in diastolic BP and improvement in ESS score. For patients with moderate to severe OSA and CHD under optimal medications, CPAP treatment leads to effective reduction in diastolic blood pressure and improvement in daytime sleepiness.",

        "abstract": "The strong interest in graphene has motivated the scalable production of high-quality graphene and graphene devices. As the large-scale graphene films synthesized so far are typically polycrystalline, it is important to characterize and control grain boundaries, generally believed to degrade graphene quality. Here we study single-crystal graphene grains synthesized by ambient chemical vapour deposition on polycrystalline Cu, and show how individual boundaries between coalescing grains affect graphene's electronic properties. The graphene grains show no definite epitaxial relationship with the Cu substrate, and can cross Cu grain boundaries. The edges of these grains are found to be predominantly parallel to zigzag directions. We show that grain boundaries give a significant Raman 'D' peak, impede electrical transport, and induce prominent weak localization indicative of intervalley scattering in graphene. Finally, we demonstrate an approach using pre-patterned growth seeds to control graphene nucleation, opening a route towards scalable fabrication of single-crystal graphene devices without grain boundaries.",

        "abstract": "New compounds of phthalic acid, Cs(HPHT), and terephthalic acid, Cs 2 (TPA), have been synthesized. The enthalpy of solution of Cs(HPHT) in water was determined and combined with the standard molar enthalpies of formation of CsOH(aq), H 2 O(l) and phthalic acid(s) to calculate the standard molar enthalpy of formation of Cs(HPHT) of −(1035.6 ± 0.5) kJ mol −1 . The enthalpies of solution of Cs 2 (TPA) and TPA in approximately 0.11 mol dm −3 CsOH were determined and combined with the standard molar enthalpies of formation of TPA(s), H 2 O(l) and CsOH(aq, 1:500) to calculate the standard molar enthalpy of formation of Cs 2 (TPA) of −(1266.2 ± 0.3) kJ mol −1 . Keywords Synthesis Characterization Standard enthalpy of formation 1 Introduction We synthesized two compounds Cs(HPHT) and Cs 2 (TPA) which have been studied with XRD, FT-IR and Raman spectra as well as TG. This paper reports the synthesis and standard molar enthalpy of formation of these compounds. 2 Experimental 2.1 General information Analytical grade cesium sulfate (purity >99.5%), analytical grade barium hydroxide, analytical grade phthalic anhydride, phthalic acid, terephthalic acid, and double distilled water were used in all experiments. 2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 Synthesis of Cs(HPHT) About 18.7 mmol phthalic anhydride was added to CsOH (18.7 mmol) solution in 5 mL of water. The suspension was stirred for 2 h at 333 K, filtered under reduced pressure and white crystals of Cs(HPHT) obtained from the filtered solution 7 days later. Then the compound was dried in the desiccator at room temperature. 2.2.2 Synthesis of Cs 2 (TPA) 19.1 mmol telephthalic acid was added to 10 mL of CsOH (38.2 mmol) solution. The suspension was stirred for 2 h at 333 K, filtered and the solution concentrated to a volume of 3 mL under reduced pressure. Then alcohol was added and a white solid appears. The mixture was then filtered under reduced pressure, leaving behind a white solid which was washed with 10 mL of alcohol and dried under vacuum at room temperature to obtain Cs 2 (TPA). The chemical composition was determined by C, H, N element analysis and Cs + by Tas-986 atomic absorption spectrophotometry at 852.1 nm. 2.3 Calorimetric experiments Cs(HPHT) (7 mg) was dissolved in 8 mL H 2 O, then PHT (5 mg) in 8 mL of aqueous 0.014 mol dm −3 CsOH(aq), Cs 2 (TPA)(s) (5 mg) and TPA (2 mg) in 6 mL 0.11 mol dm −3 CsOH solution. The CsOH solvent was prepared from Cs 2 SO 4 and Ba(OH) 2 [1] , and the concentration determined by titration with standard potassium acid phthalate. A RD496-III heat conduction calorimeter (Southwest Institute of Electron Engineering, China) was used at 298.15 K and has been described in detail previously [2] . The sample was pressed into the solvent by a rod after thermal equilibration for at least 1 h [3] . Total time required for the complete reaction was about 40 min. There were no solid residues observed after the reactions. The enthalpy of solution of KCl (spectral purity) in deionized water was measured to verify calorimeter calibration. The mean value (17.23 ± 0.04) kJ mol −1 of Δ sol H m agrees with the literature value of (17.241 ± 0.018) kJ mol −1 reported in [4] . 3 Results 3.1 Characterization of the synthetic samples Anal. Calc. for Cs(HPHT): C, 32.21; H, 1.68; Cs, 44.59. Found: C, 31.43; H, 1.62; Cs, 44.30. Anal. Calc. for Cs 2 (TPA): C, 22.34; H, 0.93; Cs: 61.84. Found: C, 22.35; H, 0.87; Cs, 61.07. There is no impurity line observed in XRD, FT-IR or Raman spectra which shows the synthetic sample is suitable for the calorimetric experiments. 3.2 Result of calorimetric experiment The results of the calorimetric measurements are given in Table 1 . Tables 2 and 3 give the thermochemical cycles for the derivation of the standard molar enthalpies of formation of Cs(HPHT) and Cs 2 (TPA). In Table 3 , the concentrations of the CsOH solutions in reactions 1 and 2 are almost the same, approximately, 0.11 mol dm −3 . The standard molar enthalpies of formation of H 2 O(l), Cs + (aq) and OH − (aq) were taken from the CODATA Key Values [5] , namely, −(285.83 ± 0.04) kJ mol −1 , −(258.28 ± 0.50) kJ mol −1 and −(230.15 ± 0.04) kJ mol −1 , respectively. The enthalpy of formation of CsOH(aq) in H 2 O, −(488.43 ± 0.50) kJ mol −1 , which was calculated from standard molar enthalpies of formation of Cs + (aq) and OH − (aq). The standard molar enthalpies of formation of PHT, TPA and CsOH solution ( n CsOH: n H 2 O = 1:500, 0.11 mol dm −3 ) were taken from Lange's handbook of chemistry [6] and the NBS tables [7] , namely, −782.0, −816.1 and −487.73 kJ mol −1 . From these data, the standard molar enthalpy of formation of Cs(HPHT) was calculated to be −(1035.6 ± 0.5) kJ mol −1 and the standard molar enthalpy of formation of Cs 2 (TPA) was −(1266.2 ± 0.3) kJ mol −1 .

        "abstract": "This letter demonstrates vertical GaN junction barrier Schottky (JBS) rectifiers fabricated with novel ion implantation techniques. We used two different methods to form the lateral p-n grids below the Schottky contact: 1) Mg implantation into n-GaN to form p-wells and 2) Si implantation into p-GaN to form n-wells. Specific differential ON-resistances (   ${R}_{ mathrm{scriptscriptstyle ON}}$   ) of 1.5–2.5    $text{m}Omega ~cdot $    cm 2  and 7–9    $text{m}Omega ~cdot $    cm 2  were obtained in the Mg-implanted and Si-implanted JBS rectifiers, respectively. A breakdown voltage of 500–600 V was achieved in both devices, with a leakage current at high reverse biases at least 100-fold lower than conventional vertical GaN Schottky barrier diodes. The impact of n-well and p-well widths on the    ${R}_{ mathrm{scriptscriptstyle ON}}$    and BV was investigated. Fast switching capability was also demonstrated. This letter shows the feasibility of forming patterned p-n junctions by novel ion implantation techniques, to enable high-performance vertical GaN power devices.",

        "abstract": "A new method was developed for the fabrication of CdS-TiO2 semiconductor nanoparticles as visible-light-excitable photocatalyst at low temperatures. Nanosized CdS acting as an effective and stable sensitizer was incorporated into TiO2 by microemulsion-mediated solvothermal hydrolyzation followed by acidic peptization of the precipitate under 70 °C. The new method avoided the calcination or other pyrochemical treatments involved in traditional preparations, and thus eliminated the unwanted agglomeration of nanoparticles or the oxidation of CdS by oxygen. Compared to traditional methods, it was highly simplified, bypassing those miscellaneous steps like filtration, sintering, milling and redispersion in solutions. The crystal structure, configuration, element composition, as well as the light-absorption properties of the obtained CdS-TiO2 hydrosol were characterized in detail. The hydrosol consisting of uniform and small crystalline particles of about 2nm in diameter was thermodynamically stable and showed good dispersibility. The photocatalytic activity of the 'coupled' material was confirmed through the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye under visible light irradiation, and the cooperative photocatalytic mechanism is discussed. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Single ion conducting polymer electrolytes with high porous, superior electrolyte wettability and excellent thermal dimensional stability are attracting increasing attentions for meeting the requirement. Herein, the fabrication of the highly porous single ion conducting polymer electrolyte membrane (SIPE) by the non-solvent phase separation process (NIPS) using water as the coagulation bath solvent was firstly reported. The key properties of porosity, solvent uptake, mechanical strength and electrolyte wettability were systematically investigated and compared to that of the porous SIPE using chloroform as the coagulation bath solvent and commercial PP separator. The results indicate that the water induced NIPS process is a facile way to for preparation of highly porous SIPE. The uniform and interconnected porous SIPE with high porosity of 73.5% and solvent uptake of 537.9 wt% was successfully obtained. As a consequence, the excellent electrochemical performances of the LIBs assembled by the porous SIPE were achieved.",

The degree of proteinuria, endogenous creatinine clearance rate, body mass index, amylin, fasting glucose, insulin, lipid and lipoprotein concentrations were measured during the steady state.The patients with ORG were clinically characterized by increased body mass index and proteinuria, with higher levels of amylin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), insulin, glucose, and lipid proteins when compared with the lean controls. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that amylin and HOMA-IR were significantly associated with the prevalence of ORG. In patients with ORG, proteinuria level correlated with amylin, total cholesterol, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR. Moreover, proteinuria correlated positively with HOMA-IR and amylin in a multiple regression analysis. In addition, the endogenous creatinine clearance rate did not correlate with any metabolic marker.This study suggested that screening for HOMA-IR might have predictive value for renal damage in obese patients. In addition to insulin resistance, amylin also showed positive effects on evaluation of such renal impairment.",

CsA was given at a starting dosage of 5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) for 3 months, with a 1 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) reduction every month and then maintained at a dosage of 2 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1). The dosage of oral prednisone differed from person to person according to levels of extra-renal activity. Clinical efficacy and adverse reactions were retrospectively analyzed. Complete remission was defined as having a urinary proteinuria level (Upr) of < 0.4 g/d, and normal serum albumin and serum creatinine (SCr) levels, without SLE activity. Partial remission was defined as having a UPr decrement > 50% of baseline value and a serum albumin value of 30 - 35 g/L, without SLE activity. No response was defined as having a Upr decrement < 50% of baseline value and > 2.0 g/d, or as a deterioration of renal function, or as having active SLE.One patient could no longer undergo follow-up, and the other 23 patients were treated with CsA and followed up for 6 - 36 months (mean 16.8 +/- 8.4 months). The mean starting dosage of CsA was 4.7 +/- 0.5) mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) and the trough level of the whole blood CsA was 248 +/- 110) micro g/L. Twelve patients (52.2%) achieved complete remission, 10 patients (43.3%) achieved partial remission after CsA treatment, and one patient showed no response. At different CsA treatment timepoint, the complete remission rates were 17.4% (3rd month), 21.7% (6th month), 40% (12th month), 88.9% (18th month) and 100% (24th month) respectively. SCr elevation, when within a normal limit was not observed in most patients during early CsA administration, and at the end of the follow-up all the patients had a normal SCr. Relapse occurred in 33.3% of the patients after withdrawing CsA for 4 - 24 months. No chronic CsA renal toxicity was observed in 4 patients who had a repeat renal biopsy after CsA treatment for 6 - 24 months.CsA could be regarded as an effective therapy for patients with membranous lupus nephropathy, but its adverse effects, especially its nephrotoxicity, should be carefully monitored during CsA treatment.",

Methodology:Sixty-six patients diagnosed membranous nephropathy by renal biopsy,45 male and 21 female with age from 15 to 71 years old,excluded possible secondary factors,without large dose immunosuppressive agent using recently,were enrolled in the study.Another 40 age-and sex-matched healthy volunteers served as healthy controls(HC).The ABSolute cell numbers of peripheral blood regulatory T cells(CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells),B lymphocyte(CD20+ cells) and T lymphocyte subsets(CD3+,CD4+ and CD8+ cells) were determined in IMN patients as compared to HC by flow cytometry.According to the level of urine protein(Upro),the IMN patients were divided into two groups,the first group with Upro≥3.5 g/d and the second group with Upro<3.5 g/d.The variation of peripheral blood regulatory T cells,B lymphocyte and T lymphocyte subsets was compared between the patients with IMN and HC,as well as between two subgroups of IMN patients.24 in 66 IMN patients of which B lymphocytes >30/mm2 in renal tissue were divided into two groups according to whether there is a focal aggregation of B lymphoctes.The variantion of Upro,NAG,RBP and periphral blood B lymphcytes are compared between the two groups. Results:(1) The ABSolute cell number of peripheral blood regulatory T cells was significantly lower in patients with IMN than that in HC [(23.2±10.7) cells/μl vs(31.4±7.29) cells/μl,P<0.01].(2) Comparing with HC,the ABSolute cell number of peripheral blood B cells in patients with IMN was elevated apparently [(208±111) cells/μl vs(137±64) cells/μl,P<0.01].(3) No significant differences in the ABSolute cell numbers of CD4+ cells [(715±267) cells/μl vs(657±214) cells/μl,P>0.05] and CD8+ cells [(393±178) cells/μl vs(464±200) cells/μl,P>0.05] could be found between IMN patients and HC,however,the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ cells of IMN patients was higher remarkably in patients with IMN as compared with that in HC(2.04±0.92 vs 1.52±0.48,P<0.01).(4) The ABSolute cell number of peripheral blood B cells was significantly higher in the first group(Upro≥3.5 g/d IMN patients) than that in the second group(Upro<3.5 g/d IMN patients) [(246±117) cells/μl vs(186±108) cells/μl,P<0.05].The ABSolute cell numbers of regulatory T cells,CD4+ cells,CD8+ cells and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ cells between two subgroups showed no statistical difference(P>0.05).(5) The numbers of B lymphocytes infiltrated in renal tissue was higher in the IMN patients than that in HC.NAG of IMN patients with focal aggregation of B lymphocytes was increased significantly. Conclusion:The decrease of regulatory T cells,the up-regulation of B lymphocyte and the disequilibrium of CD4+/CD8+ cells in peripheral blood occurs in patients with IMN.The focal aggregation of B lymphocytes in renal tissue could present more serious acute tubular-intersitial damage,and the amount of peripheral B cells may be associated with the degree of proteinuria.Those parameters may predict the disease activity of IMN.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Pressure acid leaching of zinc refinery residues containing 0.266 wt.% Ga and 0.363 wt.% Ge was performed. The effects of the experimental parameters on the leaching of gallium and germanium and the filtration performance of the leach slurry were systematically investigated. The results show that the losses of Ge and Ga rapidly decreased because of the aggregation of amorphous silica under the pressure leaching conditions. Furthermore, the Ge leaching and filtration performance of the leach slurry were improved by adding calcium nitrate, which can be attributed to the oxidation of metallic Ge and its sulfides and the formation of calcium sulfate. The optimal leaching conditions are as follows: temperature of 150 °C sulfuric acid concentration of 156 g L − 1 , liquid-to-solid ratio (mL/g) of 8, total pressure of 0.40 MPa, calcium nitrate addition of 20 g L − 1 , stirring rate of 300 r min − 1 , and leaching time of 3 h. Under the optimal conditions, more than 98% of the Ga and 94% of the Ge were leached. Moreover, the filtration rate of the studied leach slurry was 20 times faster than that of the leach slurry that was obtained under atmospheric pressure acid leaching conditions.",

The phase transitions from chloropinnoite dissolved in water and boric acid solution would strongly consist of magnesium borate minerals deposited in a salt lake of China. The obtained results from phase relations and kinetic mechanism of chloropinnoite-water/boric acid system would further propose a new geochemical hypothesis for hydrated magnesium borate deposition. The chloropinnoite was diluted by rich boric acid or solution, and it would accelerate the phase transition of chloropinnoite into other borates, which would explain well the geochemical formation of hydrated borate minerals deposited in Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, China. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) and incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in female populations in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China. Methods: Totally 1137 women aged 15-59 from Shahe Community, Nanshan District, Shenzhen were investigated for cervical cancer during an population-based epidemiological screening from November 2004 to December 2004. Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), colposcopy, liquid-based cytology test (LCT), and hybrid capture 2 (HC-II) were performed to detect the high-risk HPV types in cervical secretions. Biopsy under colposcope was performed in women who were HPV-positive with LCT ≥ atypical squamous cells of undetetemined sign (ASCUS) or HPV-negative with LCT ≥ low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), with the pathological results as the golden standards. Results: The detection rate of high-risk HPV-DNA was 14.0%. HPV detection rates in 15-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, and 50-59 age groups were 15.5%, 17.7%, 12.6%, 8.8%, 10.2%, 15.3%, and 21.0%, respectively (P < 0.05). HPV detection rates in 25-29 years group and 50-59 years group were significantly higher than those in other groups (P < 0.05) and 35-39 group had the lowest detection rate. The curve of HPV infection rates in all groups was 'V' type. The overall incidence of CIN was 4.4%. The incidences of CIN I, CIN II, and CIN III were 3.2%, 1.0%, and 0.3%, respectively, in which the incidence of CIN I was significantly higher than those of CIN II and III. HPV detection rates increased with cervical lesion grades, which in ≥ CIN II groups and normal group were 100.0% and 8.3%, respectively. No cervical cancer was identified in this research. The sensitivities of VIA, colposcopy, LCT, and HC-II for high-risk HPV screening were 35.7%, 50.0%, 92.9%, and 100%, respectively, in detecting high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), the specificities of these four methods were 96.0%, 87.2%, 88.4%, and 86.9%, respectively. Satisfactory negative predictive values were obtained for all methods. Conclusions: HPV infection is the main risk factor for CIN. Cervical cancer among female populations in Shenzhen is still in early stages. Prevention of HPV infection and treatment of CIN are key for the prevention of cervical cancer.",

        "abstract": "Background  Observational studies suggest that patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) with active proliferative lesions show a good response to immunosuppressive treatment.  Study Design  Multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial.  Setting u0026 Participants  176 patients with IgAN with active proliferative lesions (cellular and fibrocellular crescents, endocapillary hypercellularity, or necrosis), proteinuria with protein excretion ≥ 1.0g/24h, and estimated glomerular filtration rate u003e 30mL/min/1.73m 2 .  Intervention  Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) group: MMF, 1.5g/d, for 6 months and prednisone, 0.4 to 0.6mg/kg/d, for 2 months and then tapered by 20% per month for the next 4 months; prednisone group: prednisone, 0.8 to 1.0mg/kg/d, for 2 months and then tapered by 20% per month for the next 4 months. All patients were followed up for another 6 months.  Outcomes  The primary end point was complete remission rate at 6 and 12 months.  Results  At baseline, median estimated glomerular filtration rates were 90.2 and 94.3mL/min/1.73m 2  and mean proteinuria was protein excretion of 2.37 and 2.47g/24h in the MMF and prednisone groups, respectively. At 6 months, complete remission rates were 37% (32 of 86 patients) and 38% (33 of 88 patients); the between-group difference was not statistically significant ( P =0.9). At 12 months, complete remission rates were 48% (35 of 73 patients) and 53% (38 of 72 patients) in the MMF and prednisone groups, respectively; the between-group difference was not statistically significant ( P =0.6). Incidences of Cushing syndrome and newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus were lower in the MMF group than in the prednisone group.  Limitations  Not all participants were treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers, relatively short follow-up.  Conclusions  MMF plus prednisone versus full-dose prednisone did not differ in reducing proteinuria, but patients treated with the former had fewer adverse events in patients with IgAN with active proliferative lesions.",

        "abstract": "Idiopathic IgA nephropathy is one of the main causes of secondary malignant hypertension, especially in Chinese population. But little information has been available about malignant hypertension secondary to IgA nephropathy (IgANMHT). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinico-pathological features and outcomes of IgANMHT patients.A case control retrospective study was carried out in 45 cases of IgANMHT and 26 cases of primary malignant hypertension (PMHT) diagnosed by renal biopsy. Their clinical features and pathological findings were investigated. Their average follow-up time was 37.4 months. Univariate analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to select variables to predict renal survival.In the study, 1.2% of all the IgA nephropathy patients presented malignant hypertension. The amounts of urine protein excretion and red blood cells in IgANMHT patients were significantly higher, while the levels of serum creatinine were significantly lower than those in PMHT patients. The glomerular injury in IgANMHT patients was more severe than that in PMHT patients. The two characteristic vascular lesions of primary malignant hypertension, proliferative endoarteritis and fibrinoid necrosis were also found in IgANMHT patients but with less severity. Renal survival of IgANMHT patients was significantly higher than that of PMHT patients (p = 0.0043). However, log-rank test showed no significant difference in the renal survival between IgANMHT and PMHT patients with similar SCr levels at admission. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that a high amount of urine protein excretion(> or =1.5 g/24 h), mesangial proliferation and elevated serum creatinine (> or =2 mg/dl) were statistically independent risk factors for renal prognosis (RR = 1.90, 2.72, 2.84, respectively). Conversely, strict blood pressure control had a favorable effect on renal prognosis.The clinico-pathological features and outcomes of IgANMHT patients were different from those of PMHT patients. The renal survival of IgANMHT patients was poor, which was determined by many factors. Early control of proteinuria, early monitoring and strictly controlling blood pressure may contribute to the renal survival.",

        "abstract": "The effect of obesity and medication on the relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and lipidaemia and systemic inflammation is not fully understood for various reasons. The aim of the present study is to determine the effects of 12 months of therapy with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on lipid profiles and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in non-obese patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and OSA.We consecutively recruited 78 non-obese subjects with newly diagnosed CAD and moderate-to-severe OSA who were taking lipid-lowering medication. Patients were randomised to CPAP treatment or the control group. The patients' lipids and the hs-CRP level were measured at baseline and at follow-up.Seventy patients completed the study. The CPAP and control groups had similar characteristics at baseline. The mean duration of CPAP treatment was 4.2±1.1h/night. There was no significant difference in the lipids or hs-CRP levels at 12 months (both, P>0.05). The apnoea-hypopnoea index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale were significantly lower in the CPAP treatment group than in the control group (both, P<0.05).Continuous positive airway pressure treatment in non-obese patients with CAD and OSA who are taking standardised lipid-lowering treatment does not significantly decrease the lipid or hs-CRP levels. In addition, there are no relationships found between the severity of OSA and the lipid profiles. However, the status of OSA and daytime sleepiness improved significantly in the CPAP group.URL: http://clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT02127177.",

        "abstract": "Hemoglobin, the main component of haemolymph, is widely distributed in animals. Although its important oxygen transport functions has been extensively reported, studies on the immune function of hemoglobin in mollusc are few. Research on immune of hemoglobin of ark shell Scapharca broughtonii attracted more and more attention due to its ownership of erythrocyte comparing with many other shellfish. In this study, the hemoglobin cDNA of S. broughtonii was cloned by EST and RACE methods (named as SbHb). Sequence analysis revealed that the cDNA was 946 bp in length, including an open reading frame (ORF) of 459 bp which encoded a polypeptide of 152 amino acid residues, and a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of 313 bp, a 3'-UTR of 174 bp. Sequence and homology analysis showed that the SbHb shared similarity with that of other related species. The mRNA expression profiles of SbHb in tested tissues analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that the mRNA of SbHb could be all detected in foot, gill, mantle, adductor muscle, haemocytes and hepatopancreas, and the highest level was found in the haemocytes, which is 163.2 times higher than that in adductor muscle. Vibrio anguillarum stimulation and hypoxia treatment both had significant impact on the expression of SbHb, which showed the same trends as increasing first to the highest at 16 h after treatment and then followed by declining. Recombinant protein of SbHb (rSbHb) was successfully obtained by prokaryotic expression, and further function analysis indicated obviously that the rSbHb had very strong phenoloxidase-like activity (PO-like activity) and it could remarkably inhibit growth of gram-negative bacteria V. anguillarum. All the data suggested that the SbHb plays a significant role in the process of antibacterial and anoxia tolerance reaction in S. broughtonii, providing the evidence that SbHb is a key immune factor.",

Thus online kinetic studies of the intermediate were accomplished. Two-way kinetic spectral data were acquired with stopped-flow technique. By resolving the data with global analysis software, both the kinetic curves and the absorption spectra of the components involved in the reaction process were simultaneously obtained. The whole reaction in the reversed micelle was proved to be composed of two successive steps, an enzymatic generation of the intermediate and a following nonenzymatic decay of the intermediate. A consecutive first-order kinetic model of the whole reaction was confirmed. The influences of microenvironmental factors of the medium (such as the pH value of the water pool and the water/AOT ratio) on the detection of the intermediate were also investigated.",

        "abstract": "The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau plays a very important role in studying severe weather in China and around the globe because of its unique characteristics. Moreover, the surface emissivities of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are also important for retrieving surface and atmospheric parameters. In the current study, a retrieval algorithm was developed to retrieve the surface emissivities of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The developed algorithm was derived from the radiative transfer model and was first validated using simulated data from a one-dimensional microwave simulator. The simulated results show good precision. Then, the surface emissivities of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were retrieved using brightness temperatures from the advanced microwave-scanning radiometer and atmospheric profile data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer. Finally, the features of the time and space distribution of the retrieved results were analyzed. In terms of spatial characteristics, a spatial distribution con- sistency was found between the retrieved results and surface coverage types of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In terms of time characteristics, the changes in emissivity, which were within 0.01 for every day, were not evident within a one-month time scale. In addition, surface emissivities are sensitive to rainfall. The reasonability of the retrieved results indicates that the algorithm is feasible. A time-series surface emissivity database on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau can be built using the developed algorithm, and then other surface or atmospheric parameters would have high retrieval precision to support related geological re- search on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",

Methodology:Five patients with post-allogeneic HSCT MN which proved by renal biopsy was involved in this study.The clinical manifestations,laboratory data,and morphology,immunefluorescence and electron microscopy of the renal pathology of those patients were analyzed.Moreover,the IgG subclasses in glomerular deposits and the co-deposition of nephrin and IgG4 were studied.Finally,We detected the Anti-PLA2R(M-type phospholipase A2 receptor) autoantibodies in serum samples from patients with post-allogeneic HSCT MN. Results:The following items are the clinical and pathological features of the 5 patients:(1) All of the 5 patients have no history and family history of kidney disease.(2) All patients were combined with the syndrome of chronic GVHD at the time of proteinuria presence,and 4 patients had a history of acute GVHD,after an effective anti-GVHD treatment,the patients' proteinuria also remissioned.(3) The autoantibodies for some of the patients were positive and accompanied by the deposition of C4 and C1q in kidney,suggesting the existence of autoimmune phenomenon.(4) The dominant subclass of IgG deposition was IgG4,the distribution of IgG4 was as same as nephrin.(5) One of the five patients have detected the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor in the serum,the positive rate is far lower than in idiopathic membranous nephropathy(IMN) patients. Conclusion:Our data suggested that the membranous nephropathy of Allo-HSCT patients is a form of cGVHD,the pathogenesis may be related to the anti podocyte antibody which produced by the transplanted immune cells,and the type of antibody is different from the anti-PLA_2R antibody of the IMN patients.",

The clinical manifestations, serologic results and prognosis were compared for Classes Va and Vb.The incidence of hypertension and anemia in Class Vb patients was significantly higher than in Class Va (38.5% vs 21.3%, 72.5% vs 52.5%, p<0.05). The incidence of hematuria and renal insufficiency in Class Vb was 64.8%and 15.4%, which was higher than Class Va (44.2% and 3.3%), but lower than Class IV (89.1% and 35%), p<0.05. The percentage of patients with positive anti-dsDNA antibody and hypocomplementemia in Class Vb tended to be higher than Class Va (35.2% vs 26.2%, 50.6% vs 31.2%). Repeated renal biopsies in 24 patients (11 Class Va, 13 Class Vb) showed that eight Class Vb patients had \"transformed\" to Class IV LN, while only two Class Va patients did (p<0.05). In three Class Va patients serum creatinine doubled during follow-up, but none of them progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In Class Vb serum creatinine doubled in ten patients, and three progressed to ESRD.The renal injury and extrarenal manifestations of Class Vb patients were severer than Class Va. Class Vb patients were more likely to shift to Class IV LN, and the prognosis was poorer than for Class Va.",

        "abstract": "Online social networks provide valuable information for researchers. However, users' privacy will be exposed when the social network data is published. Social relationships are connected with our social identification which represent users' sensitive message. In addition, there are some nodes in the social network that are closely connected to others, called hub nodes. These hub nodes play an important role in the social network. Many proposed methods only protect the privacy of social relationships, the hub nodes with a large amount of neighbors are exposed to the adversary. Therefore the adversary can easily find out the identity of these nodes, and then inferring the probability of the existence of a link, although the link is perturbed. To tackle this problem, we proposed a random walk based algorithm which can protect both hub nodes and social relationships. Through a random degree perturbation algorithm, the performance of link privacy preserving method can be improved. We conducted comprehensive experiments over the real-world social network dataset to evaluate the anonymity level and utility of the transformed graph. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can achieve higher link privacy and has better utility, outperforming the state of the art approaches.",

        "abstract": "Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis(CAPD) for severe lupus nephritis(LN) patients complicated with important organ dysfunctions. Methods Eight patients diagnosed as severe LN complicated with multiple organ dysfunctions and undergoing CAPD from November 2003 to June 2008 were enrolled in this study.They were characterized by the following features:①Methylprednisolone pulse therapy was required due to active lupus and progressive renal failure,but immunosuppressant could not be continuously applied due to high catabolism;②Regular therapy failed due to severe edema, cardiac insufficiency and severe malnutrition;and③Severe gastrointestinal symptoms.Catheterization surgery was carried out,and CAPD was conducted at 2,000ml/time and 3-4 times/day.Immunosuppressant was re-administered when the above features improved.Changes of renal function,nutrition status and systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index(SLE-DAI),and the administration of immunosuppressant in these patients were followed up for at least 4 months.Results①Clinical effects:Better general condition,regression of edema,and improvement of heart function,mental status and physical strength were found in the 8 patients.Renal function recovered significantly in all patients,and the CAPD discontinued in 5 of the 8 patients.②Nutrition indices:Remarkable improvement was present in all patients.③Immunological indices:In patients taking prednisone and other immunosuppressant therapy such as mycophenolate mofetil(MMF) after CAPD,ANA and anti-dsDNA antibody titers decreased significantly in 5 patients,and remained unchanged in 2 patients,and ANA titer increased in one patient.SLE-DAI decreased significantly after CAPD in all patients.④Complications:Peritonitis occurred in one patient.Conclusion Peritoneal dialysis can be used in severe LN patients complicated with important organ dysfunctions.After peritoneal dialysis, edema,heart failure and azotemia improved,the residual renal function preserved,and the nutritional status ameliorated in these patients.When the patient's condition improves,immunosuppressant should be resumed to treat the primary disease and to help recover the residual renal function.",

Compared with the commercial polypropylene (PP) separator, the PSA@PVDF-HFP composite nonwoven separator manifested higher porosity, better electrolyte wettability and superior thermal stability. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the assembled cell with PSA@PVDF-HFP composite nonwoven separator displayed superior rate capability and better cycling capacity retention than those of PP separator. Notably, these attractive characteristics would endow PSA@PVDF-HFP composite nonwoven a promising separator for high power lithium ion battery. © 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

        "abstract": "To assess the value of cardiopulmonary exercise test in the evaluation of cardiac function in patients with chronic left heart failure caused by dilated cardiomyopathy.Fifty-three inpatients aged 18 year and over with chronic left heart failure caused by dilated cardiomyopathy at Fuwai Hospital from October 2010 to October 2011 were selected and divided into 2 groups according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) heart function classification. One group had 20 cases for class II and another 33 cases for class III-IV. All of them received cardiopulmonary exercise tests. Synchronous measurement and record of gas exchange indices were taken during every breath, and so were heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram and blood oxygen saturation. At the same time, other routine tests were also performed. After exercise test, anaerobic threshold and peak oxygen consumption indices were calculated and statistically analyzed. They also received subsequent follow-ups of 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months and 1 year, including activities, clinical manifestations and cardiac adverse events.At baseline, the differences in gender, age, body mass index, concurrent diseases, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, left ventricular ejection fraction and serum creatinine had no statistical significance (P > 0.05). Compared with cardiac function class II group, the class III-IV group had higher left atrial diameter, level of amino terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), incidence of atrial fibrillation ((51.4 ± 7.5) vs (43.6 ± 7.7) mm, (2 607 ± 1 782) vs (1 312 ± 901) µg/L, 42.4% (14/33) vs 5.0% (1/20)) and lower glomerular filtration rate, peak oxygen consumption, levels of anaerobic threshold ((72 ± 20) vs (97 ± 23) ml/min, (13.7 ± 2.6) vs (20.5 ± 3.6) ml·min(-1)·kg(-1), (10.7 ± 1.5) vs (13.3 ± 2.1) ml·min(-1)·kg(-1)) (all P < 0.01). And NT-proBNP and cardiac function classification showed a positive correlation (OR = 1.002, P = 0.003) while peak oxygen consumption, anaerobic threshold and cardiac function classification were negatively correlated (OR = 0.736, 0.608; P = 0.011, 0.001).Cardiopulmonary exercise test objectively reflects the cardiopulmonary reserve of heart failure patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. And the parameters of anaerobic threshold and peak oxygen consumption may reflect the patient's motor ability quantitatively and accurately.",

Inkjet printing process of graphene film is described with sheet resistance as low as 110    $Omega $   /sq. To suppress background noises, the biosensors are based on intensity changes of the ac signal as a function of the biological agents’ concentration. Using the foodborne pathogen, Norovirus, as a proof-of-concept disease target, the value of S12 (i.e., the voltage gain from source to drain) at 10 GHz generates a linear response from 0.07 to 3.70 dB when the concentration of Norovirus protein increases from 0.1 to 100    $mu text{g}$   /ml. While further studies are needed to improve surface functionalization and sensitivity, the current study establishes a linear response over three orders of magnitude indicating that the flexible graphene FET sensor has a wide dynamic range for detection of biological targets that could ultimately be applied for detection of a variety of disease-causing pathogens.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To investigate the clinic and pathological features in patients of IgA nephropathy(IgAN) associated with psoriasis vulgaris. Methodology:Twenty patients with psoriasis vulgaris, who diagnosed as IgAN by renal biopsy, were included in this retrospective study. Their clinic and pathological manifestations were analyzed. Results: They were fifteen males and five females, mean age 18～54(31.9±10.7) years old. The mean history of psoriasis vulgaris was 8.7 years. The duration between psoriasis and nephropathy was from 2 to 306 months (mean 95.0±71.1 months). The mean history of renal lesion was 8.73±9.56 months(0.3～36 months). In clinic picture, four cases presented edema and hypertension, and sixteen had asymptomatic hematuria and (or) proteinuria. Three cases revealed high serum IgA, and nine showed the decrease of serum complement C3. In pathological examination, thirteen patients presented focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and the others showed mild to moderate mesangial proliferative lesions. The segmental cellular crescents were observed in five cases, and segmental loop necrosis in three cases. The severe chronic tubulointerstitial lesions were in six patients, and vascular involvement, including arteriolar hyalinosis and incrassation, was in thirteen patients. Conclusion:IgAN existed in patients with psoriasis. These patients presented hematuria and (or) proteinuria. We recommend routine urinalysis, careful examination of kidney function and a wider application of renal biopsy in psoriatic patients.",

        "abstract": "CXCL12 has been implicated in human carcinogenesis, but the association between the most-studied G801A polymorphism (rs1801157) and the risk of various cancers was reported with inconclusive results. The aim of this study was to assess the association between the CXCL12 G801A polymorphism and cancer risk. A meta-analysis of 17 studies with 3048 cancer patients and 4522 controls was conducted to evaluate the strength of the association using odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI). The overall results showed that the variant genotypes were associated with a significantly increased risk of all cancer types (OR=1.38, 95%CI=1.18-1.61 for GA versus GG, and OR=1.36, 95%CI=1.17-1.59 for GA/AA versus GG). In the stratified analyses, there was a significantly increased risk for the studies of breast cancer (OR=1.64, 95% CI=1.16-2.33 for AA versus GG, OR=1.42, 95%CI=1.18-1.71 for GA versus GG, and OR=1.44, 95%CI=1.21-1.72 for GA/AA versus GG) and lung cancer (OR=2.86, 95% CI=1.75-4.69 for AA versus GG, OR=1.62, 95% CI=1.20-2.18 for GA vs. GG, OR=1.80, 95% CI=1.36-2.39 for GA/AA versus GG, and OR=2.24, 95%CI=1.41-3.57 for AA versus GA/GG), which remained for the studies of Asian populations and hospital-based control sources. Although some modest bias could not be eliminated, this meta-analysis indicates that the CXCL12 G801A polymorphism is a low-penetrance risk factor for cancer development.",

        "abstract": "Post-transplant proteinuria is a common complication after renal transplantation; it is associated with reduced graft and recipient survival. However, the prevalence of histological causes has been reported with considerable variation. A clinico-pathological re-evaluation of post-transplant proteinuria is necessary, especially after dismissal of the term \"chronic allograft nephropathy,\" which had been considered to be an important cause of proteinuria. Moreover, urinary protein can promote interstitial inflammation in native kidney, whether this occurs in renal allograft remains unknown. Factors that affect the graft outcome in patients with proteinuria also remain unclear. Here we collected 98 cases of renal allograft recipients who developed proteinuria after transplant, histological features were characterized using Banff scoring system. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used for graft survival predictors. We found that transplant glomerulopathy was the leading (40.8%) cause of post-transplant proteinuria. Immunological causes, including transplant glomerulopathy, acute rejection, and chronic rejection accounted for the majority of all pathological causes of proteinuria. Nevertheless, almost all patients that developed proteinuria had immunological lesions in the graft, especially for interstitial inflammation. Intraglomerular C3 deposition was unexpectedly correlated with the severity of proteinuria. Moreover, the severity of interstitial inflammation was an independent risk factor for graft loss, while high level of hemoglobin was a protective factor for graft survival. This study revealed a predominance of immunological parameters in renal allografts with post-transplant proteinuria. These parameters not only correlate with the severity of proteinuria, but also with the outcome of the graft.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most common cause of end-stage renal failure. Although angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) can be used to attenuate proteinuria in DN patients, their efficacy remains limited. This clinical trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) extract in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM)-induced nephropathy.A total of 65 DN patients with proteinuria levels ≥ 2.5 g/24 h and serum creatinine levels<3 mg/dl were enrolled in this six-month, prospective, randomized, controlled study. The patients were randomized into treatment groups that received either 120 mg of TwHF extract per day for three months, followed by 60 mg per day for three more months, or 160 mg of valsartan daily for six months. The urinary protein and estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) level were measured at one, three, and six months after the commencement of treatment. The primary measure of treatment efficacy was a reduction in the 24-h urine protein level between baseline and the end of the study, and the secondary measure of treatment efficacy was a reduction in the eGFR value.At the end of the treatment period, the mean urine protein level in the TwHF group was dramatically decreased (4.99 ± 2.25 g/24 h vs 2.99 ± 1.81 g/24 h, p< 0.01), with decreases at one, three, and six months of 32.9%, 38.8%, and 34.3%, respectively. In contrast, the proteinuria in the valsartan group was not significantly attenuated, and the decreases in urine protein levels at treatment months one, three, and six were 1.05%, 10.1%, and -11.7%, respectively. The mean decrease in eGFR in the valsartan group was greater than that in the TwHF group (26.4% vs. 13.7%, respectively; p =0.067).TwHF extract can reduce the urine protein level of DN patients and represents a novel, potentially effective, and safe drug for the treatment of DN patients with proteinuria.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00518362.",

Clinical records and renal biopsies were reviewed. The primary endpoint was end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and death.The most frequent FSGS variant was not otherwise specified (45.2%), followed by tip lesion (20.2%). 57 patients presented nephrotic syndrome. Among the nephrotic patients with first episode, the total remission rate was 94.75% by prednisone treatment and 50% by Tripterygium wilfordii (TW) multiglycoside treatment. Steroid-resistant patients treated by TW multiglycoside achieved a total remission rate of 80%. Over a median follow-up of 72 months, 25 patients developed ESRD. The median renal survival was 116 months. The renal survival rates were 83.5% and 43.8% at 5 and 10 years after the biopsy, respectively. By multivariate Cox proportional analysis, the degree of proteinuria, acute kidney injury (AKI) with chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stage 3, chronic tubulointerstitial injury, and complete and partial remission were independent predictors of ESRD.TW is a new potential treatment for steroid-resistant nephrotic FSGS. The 5-year renal outcome in adults with primary FSGS in China is better in comparison to the west. Severe proteinuria, CKD with AKI, chronic tubulointerstitial injury, and no response were independent risk factors of prognosis.",

        "abstract": "An ultrasensitive biosensor for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was constructed based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between upconverting nanoparticles (UCPs) and palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs). PdNPs was synthesized by the addition of a solution of Na2PdCl4 into a mixture of N2H4·H2O as the reducing agent and 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUDA) as the stabilizer. The CEA aptamer (5'-NH2-ATACCAGCTTATTCAATT-3') was conjugated to hexanedioic acid (HDA) modified UCPs (HDA-UCPs) through an EDC-NHS coupling protocol. The coordination interaction between nitrogen functional groups of the CEA aptamer and PdNPs brought UCPs and PdNPs in close proximity, which resulted in the fluorescence quenching of UCPs to an extent of 85%. And the non-specific fluorescence quenching caused by PdNPs towards HDA-UCPs was negligible. After the introduction of CEA into the UCPs-CEA aptamer-PdNPs fluorescence quenching system, the CEA aptamer preferentially combined with CEA accompanied by the conformational change which weakened the coordination interaction between the CEA aptamer and PdNPs. So fluorescence recovery of UCPs was observed and a linear relationship between the fluorescence recovery of UCPs and the concentration of CEA was obtained in the range from 2pg/mL to 100pg/mL in the aqueous buffer with the detection limit of 0.8pg/mL. The ultrasensitive detection of CEA was also realized in diluted human serum with a linear range from 4pg/mL to 100pg/mL and a detection limit of 1.7pg/mL. This biosensor makes the most of the high quenching ability of PdNPs towards UCPs with negligible non-specific fluorescence quenching and has broad application prospects in biochemistry. ",

Methods In 40 patients, activity of cTnT and CK-MB in serum were analyzed before and after operation at 9 different time intervals. The mean age was (61.3±18.5) years(41-76). The average number of graft was 2.8(1-5) per patient, mean CPB time was(118±57) minutes and aortic cross-clamping time was (58±35) minutes. We evaluated the prognosis of patients with the ECG, echocardiographic and biochemical criteria. Results The concentration in blood of cTnT and CK-MB both elevated after aortic cross-clamping release and reached peak after 10 hours of crossclamping release. Five days later of operation, the CK-MB resumed to level of preoperation. But the cTnT needed 10 days for that. cTnT in 4 patients with perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI) was significantly higher than that of non-PMI during the perioperative period. Ten days after surgery, it still higher than the normal level. Two of these 4 patients died of PMI after operation. Conclusions The change of cTnT and CK-MB is the similar at the preceding stage after coronary artery bypass grafting. But the time which cTnT is higher than the normal level is longer than that of CK-MB. Because of its higher sensitivity and specificity than CK-MB. cTnT is the reliable biochemical marker to predict the prognosis of coronary artery bypass grafting.",

        "abstract": "Membranous nephropathy is a major cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults where podocyte injuries were found to mediate the development of proteinuria. Triptolide, a major active component of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, has potent immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory and antiproteinuric effects. To study its antiproteinuric properties, we established an experimental rat model of passive Heymann nephritis and a C5b-9 injury model of podocytes in vitro. Treatment or pretreatment with triptolide markedly reduced established proteinuria as well as the titer of circulating rat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies in these nephritic rats, accompanied by a reduction in glomerular C5b-9 deposits. Expression of desmin, a marker of podocyte injury, diminished after triptolide treatment, whereas quantitative analysis of mean foot process width showed that effacement of foot processes was substantially reversed. In in vitro studies we found that triptolide deactivated NADPH oxidase, suppressed reactive oxygen species generation and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and restored RhoA signaling activity. Triptolide did not interfere with the formation of C5b-9 on the membrane of podocytes. Thus, triptolide reduces established heavy proteinuria and podocyte injuries in rats with passive Heymann nephritis, and protects podocytes from C5b-9-mediated injury.",

        "abstract": "Asparaginase-associated concurrence of hyperlipidemia, hyperglobulinemia, and thrombocytosis is a rare complication requiring aggressive lipoprotein apheresis, but no one of currently available lipoprotein apheresis methods can simultaneously resolve the 3 abnormalities. Herein, we reported a construction of double-filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) using a combination of centrifugal/membranous plasma separation techniques to successfully treat a patient with hyperlipidemia, hyperglobulinemia, and thrombocytosis. A male presented with severe hyperlipidemia, hyperglobulinemia, and thrombocytosis during asparaginase treatment for NK/T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and was scheduled to receive lipoprotein apheresis. To simultaneously remove lipoproteins, immunoglobulin, and deplete platelets from blood, a centrifuge/membrane hybrid DFPP was constructed as following steps: plasma and part of platelets were separated first from whole blood by centrifugal technique and then divided by a fraction plasma separator into 2 parts: platelets and plasma components with large size, which were discarded; and those containing albumin, which were returned to blood with a supplement of extrinsic albumin solution. DFPP lasted 240 minutes uneventfully, processing 5450-mL plasma. The concentrations of plasma components before DFPP were as follows: triglycerides 38.22 mmol/L, total cholesterols 22.98 mmol/L, immunoglobulin A (IgA) 15.7 g/L, IgG 12.7 g/L, and IgM 14.3 g/L; whereas after treatment were 5.69 mmol/L, 2.38 mmol/L, 2.5 g/L, 7.7 g/L, and 0.4 g/L, respectively. The respective reduction ratio was 85.1%, 89.6%, 83.9%, 39.4%, and 96.9%. Platelet count decreased by 40.4% (from 612 × 10(9)/L to 365 × 10(9)/L). Centrifuge/membrane hybrid DFPP can simultaneously remove lipoproteins, immunoglobulin, and deplete platelets, with a success in treatment of asparaginase treatment-induced hyperlipidemia, hyperglobulinemia, and thrombocytosis, and may be useful for patients requiring DFPP but with particular situations.",

        "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare metabolic disorder resulting from deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-GalA). Renal involvement is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in male patients. Here, we describe the largest series ever reported for this condition in China.Nine patients were enrolled in this study. Routine light microscopy (including toluidine blue staining), immunofluorescence and electron microscopic examinations were performed. We measured alpha-GalA activity in leukocyte and gene mutation analysis. Clinical and laboratory data of the patients were collected.Eight of the 9 patients were hemizygous males. Proteinuria was obvious in all patients. Three patients presented with mild renal function impairment. Light microscopy revealed glomeruli full of enlarged podocytes with abundant foamy cytoplasm. Toluidine blue stain revealed abundant cytoplasmic granular inclusions within the podocytes, tubular epithelial cells and endothelial cells of peritubular capillaries. Electron microscopy showed abundant electron-dense myelin figures within the podocyte cytoplasm. Arteriolar hyalinization and occlusion were also observed. Extrarenal manifestations, including acroparesthesia, hypohidrosis, abnormal electrocardiography and angiokeratoma were noted. No cornea verticillata or lenticular opacities were observed. These patients had about 0.3%-1.3% residual alpha-GalA activity in leukocytes. We identified a novel missense mutation (F273L) causing nonclassical Fabry disease.Fabry disease is relatively rare in China. Renal biopsy and specific staining is efficacious in the correct diagnosis of the disease. Discrepancies in the clinical manifestations of Fabry disease (i.e., eye disorders and hypertension) exist between cases found in China and those detailed in Western reports.",

Based on inherent strain theory, the weld distortion of the vacuum vessel can be predicted using the computer package ABAQUS. In this paper, calculation and application method of inherent strain on various welded joints is proposed. Six possible welding sequence schemes of the PS3 segment are provided within the actual processing condition, weld distortion of vacuum vessel on six welding sequence schemes is studied without external constraints condition, then according to the distortion value and distortion tendency without external constraints condition, the external constraints condition are provided. The optimal welding sequence can be obtained by the simulation result with external constraints condition, which can provide data support and theoretical guidance for the actual processing of the CFETR vacuum vessel.",

This paper shows a novel framework of the fault and intrusion tolerance of complex networks in a controllability view, which takes the number of driver nodes as standard. The result, the SF networks have a better fault tolerance than the ER networks, is consistent with the result considered with available researches. But the SF networks and ER networks have poor intrusion tolerance. The reason is that it is more difficult to fully control the real SF networks than to fully control the real ER networks, so it is easier to thoroughly destroy the controllability of the real SF networks than the real ER networks.",

The Re2O7 gas obtained by decomposing NH4ReO7 was transported to the reduction chamber and then reduced by H2 to form rhenium powders. In order to evaluate the effects of sintering on properties of rhenium particles, such as crystal size, morphology, surface conditions and particle size, the samples of rhenium powders prepared at different reduction temperatures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and laser particle size analyzer. The experimental results show that the sintering effect among particles is enhanced with increasing of reduction temperature, resulting in larger crystal size, smoother surface and larger average particle size of the rhenium powder.

        "abstract": "Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) was initially proposed as a pathogenic and predictive biomarker of primary FSGS, but the findings were controversial. This study aimed to clarify the clinical implications of suPAR.The study enrolled 109 patients with biopsy-proven primary FSGS who were administered prednisone between January 2011 and May 2013 and followed up for 6-24 months (median duration of follow-up, 12 months). Ninety-six healthy volunteers, 20 patients with minimal-change disease (MCD), and 22 patients with membranous nephropathy (MN) served as controls. Serum suPAR levels were measured using ELISA.suPAR levels in patients with FSGS (median, 3512 [interquartile range (IQR), 2232-4231] pg/ml) were significantly higher than in healthy controls (median, 1823 [IQR, 1563-2212] pg/ml; P<0.001), patients with MCD (median, 1678 [IQR, 1476-2182] pg/ml; P<0.001), and patients with MN (median, 1668 [IQR, 1327-2127] pg/ml; P<0.001). With 3000 pg/ml used as a threshold, suPAR levels were elevated in 48.6% of patients with FSGS, in contrast to 5% of patients with MCD and 4.5% of those with MN. suPAR levels were independently associated with steroid response in patients with FSGS (odds ratio, 85.02; P=0.001). Patients who were sensitive to steroids had significantly higher suPAR levels than nonsensitive patients (median, 3426 [IQR, 2670-5655] pg/ml versus 2523 [IQR, 1977-3460] pg/ml; P=0.001). A suPAR level of 3400 pg/ml was chosen as the optimal cutoff value for steroid response. At the 6-month follow-up in 84 patients with FSGS, suPAR levels were significantly decreased in those with suPAR level ≥ 3400 pg/ml (median, 4553 [IQR, 3771-6120] pg/ml versus 3149 [IQR, 2278-3953]; P=0.002) but were unchanged in patients with suPAR level <3400 pg/ml (median, 2359 [IQR, 2023-2842] pg/ml versus 2490 [IQR, 1916-3623] pg/ml; P=0.09).suPAR is specifically elevated in some patients with FSGS, which differs from the finding in patients with MCD and MN. A suPAR assay may help predict steroid response in patients with primary FSGS.",

Heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP or FABP3) is involved in lipid metabolism and was predicted to relate to renal lesions in obesity.A total of 28 patients with ORG were investigated, and renal tissue from 7 kidney donors served as controls. Db/db mice with albuminuria were treated with Simvastatin for 12 weeks.Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the H-FABP staining in glomerular and tubular areas of patients with ORG, and the percentage of H-FABP in the glomerular area was significantly higher than in controls (15.8±1.62 versus 4.51±0.56%, P<0.001). Moreover, H-FABP expression correlated with proteinuria, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, waist circumference and the homeostatic model assessment - insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) among patients with ORG. Enhanced expression of H-FABP was also detected in the db/db mice, and expression increased from 8 to 20 weeks of age and was weakly related to increased albuminuria (r = 0.433; P = 0.020). Furthermore, H-FABP was co-localized with synaptopodin and demonstrated a podocyte pattern distribution. After Simvastation treatment, the urine albumin levels decreased with lipid levels and H-FABP expression in the glomeruli. The expression of H-FABP was related to Simvastatin treatment, albuminuria and triglycerides, while it was only linked with triglycerides and albuminuria (r = 0.643, P = 0.036).This study confirmed an association of H-FABP with the pathogenesis of clinical and experimental ORG, and suggests that such a process might be related to podocytes and lipid dysmetabolism.",

        "abstract": "From January 2002 to June 2007, 8 cases of patellofemoral joint complications after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were admitted in Department of Orthopedics, Ruijin Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Among them, 3 had patellofemoral maltracking, 2 had patellar fracture, and 3 had patellar impingement syndrome, all of which occurred within 3 months after TKA. The post-operative radiography and findings during the revision operation and arthroscopy showed that the maltracking or instability of patellofemoral joint was resulted from the femoral or tibial prosthesis implanted at a internal rotation or a slant surface of the patella. This complication could be corrected if the prosthesis is implanted properly during the revision procedure. The treatment of patellar fracture is difficult. The curative effect for patella fracture is usually not favorable with high incidence of complication. The patellar impingement syndrome is caused by the blockage at the femoral intercondylar fossa of fibrous scar or the superior patellar pole. It could be corrected under arthroscopy or by proper resurfacing of the patella.",

        "abstract": "Although lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have shown great promise in biosensing and bioimaging owing to their excellent photophysical properties, researchers are facing a bottleneck of upconversion (UC) probes which is the limited signal-to-background ratio (SBR). Since UC nanoprobes are basically constructed with a luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) process to provide \"off-on\" signals, the SBR level is principally decided by the luminescence quenching efficiency which is very difficult to further improve through existing approaches. Herein, we put forward a new strategy for fabricating UC nanoprobes using an organic dye as target-modulated sensitizing switch. The dye functions as both the recognition unit for target and a potential sensitizer for upconversion luminescence (UCL). The reaction of the dye with target modulates its photophysical properties, which switches on the sensitization and affords a significantly improved SBR. The idea is validated with a proof-of-concept UC nanoprobe for glutathione (GSH) detection with the SBR of ∼30 (versus a SBR of less than 10 for most current UC nanoprobes). This probe showed good performance in GSH sensing both in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that the target-modulated sensitization is a useful new strategy to build UC nanoprobes. And we can reasonably expect that the breakthrough of SBR limit will make UC nanoprobe a more powerful tool in future studies.",

When AChE inhibitors do not work, Chinese patients turn to Chinese medicine, such as the Buzhongyiqi decoction (BD), to treat MG. By elucidating the relations between the herbs of the Buzhongyiqi decoction recipe and AChE inhibitors with structure-based and ligand based drug design methods and chemoinformatics approaches, we have found the key active components of BD. Using these key active components as templates, we discovered five new AChE inhibitors through virtually screening a commercial compound library. The new AChE inhibitors have been confirmed with Ellman assays. This study demonstrates that lead identification can be inspired by elucidating Chinese medicine. Since BD is a mixture, further studies are needed against other drug targets.",

In this study, the clinical and pathological features of patients with acute aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) superimposing CGN (AAN-CGN) were investigated.Eighteen patients diagnosed as acute AAN were included in this retrospective study, from January 2001 to December 2009. According to the pre-existing CGN, 13 patients were identified as the AAN-CGN group, and 5 isolated AAN patients as the control group. Clinical and pathological features were compared between the two groups.In the AAN-CGN group, six patients complained with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, or loss of appetite. The rest of seven cases were asymptomatic or minimally uncomfortable, who were found with elevated serum creatinine (Scr) in the follow up of CGN. Compared with the control group, the patients in AAN-CGN group had higher levels of serum uric acid, urine n-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, and urine protein excretion (366.2 ± 122.8 vs. 218.0 ± 125.8 μmol/L, p = 0.037; 9.74 ± 4.4 vs. 1.38 ± 1.01 g/d, p = 0.001; 61.2 ± 21.9 vs. 27.4 ± 15.8 μ/g ċ cr, p = 0.007, respectively). In addition to, the AAN-CGN patients had an absolutely prominent percentage of macromolecule substance in the urine protein electrophoresis (25.0 ± 6.32 vs. 15.8 ± 7.8%, p = 0.029). The occurrence of hypokalemia and excretion of aminoaciduria were lower than that in the control group. Pathologically, 84.6% of patients were found with tubular brush border dropping, 30.8% with naked tubular basement membrane, and 15.4% with different stages of vascular lesion. There were no statistical differences in the above-mentioned pathological parameters between the two groups. In the follow-up, 10 patients with AAN-CGN recovered with normal Scr, accounting for 76.9%, which was better than the recovery in the control group.Patients with acute AAN-CGN manifested with a great mass of urine protein excretion, low incidence of hypokalemia and aminoaciduria, however, the tubular-interstitial lesions were similar to the isolated AAN.",

The diagnoses were confirmed by lymphoid biopsy. Peripheral blood eosinophil, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphoid cell count and total serum IgE level were examined. Renal biopsy, IL-4 expression cells and IgE-positive cell counts in renal tissue were performed. Follow-up data were recorded in detail.Six patients were observed with the onset symptoms of subcutaneous mass or enlarged lymph nodes, and the other 2 with edema. Constitutional symptoms included bronchial asthma, enteritis, eczema, neuritis and nephrotic syndrome. Renal biopsy revealed mesangial proliferation with or without IgA deposition under immunofluorescence (n=6) and membranous nephropathy (n=2). Tubulointerstitial infiltration of eosinophils was found in 6 patients. IL-4-positive cells in renal interstitium were detected in 5 cases. IgE-positive cells were negative in all cases. Fusion of the epithelial foot process was observed under electron microscopy in patients with mesangial proliferation. All patients were sensitive to treatment with systemic prednisone, but 4 patients had a renal or extrarenal relapse after the dose tapered. Three patients who presented with solitary masses and underwent lymphoidectomy or mass excision were free from renal and extrarenal relapse. All patients had normal renal function at last follow-up.Mesangial proliferation, eosinophilic infiltration and podocyte confusion are prominent histological features of this cohort of patients. Patients are sensitive to prednisone therapy but apt to relapse. Lymphoidectomy can be helpful to prevent relapse.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the present research was to develop a nondestructive technique for the analysis of heavy elements of regulated substances in electrotechnical products using an XRF spectrometer. Reference samples were prepared within-house reference materials containing the elements Cr, Cd, Br, Pb, and Hg, and calibration curves of all elements exhibited a good linearity from 100 to 1 500 mg x kg(-1). Thus, the calibration curve method was effective in the determination of heavy elements in electrotechnical products. The minimum detection limits (MDLs) calculated with reference material (BCR-681) ranged from 0. 27 (Br) to 1. 10 mg x kg(-1) (Cd). The interference from background and spectra overlap was discussed. The matrix effect was corrected by experience coefficients, using scattered radiation as an internal standard. The accuracy of the method was evaluated by the analysis of certified reference material of BCR-681. The results are in agreement with certified values with a precision of less than 5. 0%.",

Methodology:24 709 patients received renal biopsy from Jan 1st 1994 to Dec 31st 2007 were enrolled.We analyzed retrospectively the epidemiologic character in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Results:The ratio of diabetic nephropathy was increased from 2.57 to 4.31 percent during the period of 1994 to 2000 and 2001 to 2007.There was statistical difference comparing the prevalence during the two periods(P<0.01).The prevalence of diabetic nephropathy companied non-diabetic nephropathy was increased from 10.9% to 18.8%(P<0.01).The age of patients with diabetic nephropathy was younger(mean age 53.0 vs 50.5 year old,P<0.01).The ratio of male to female was 1.66.The level of blood glucose in patients who were hospitalized in the 21st century was better than those in the 20th century.The mean glycosylated hemoglobin was 6.8% and 7.5%(P<0.01).The age of patients with diabetic nephropathy was older than those with non-diabetic nephropathy(mean age 51.7 vs 48.5 year old,P<0.01) and the same to the duration of diabetic mellitus(mean duration 84.9 vs 48.5 months,P<0.01).The duration of nephropathy was longer in the patients with non-diabetic nephropathy than in the patients with diabetic nephropathy(mean duration 43.4 vs 24.7 months).The incidence of microscopic hematuria was lower in patients with diabetic nephropathy than in those with non-diabetic nephropathy(45.1% vs 64.5%,P<0.01).The level of serum creatinine was higher in the former than the latter(127.2 vs 93.4 μmol/L,P<0.01).The incidence of renal dysfunction was also higher in the former(38.8 vs 22.6 percent,P<0.01).The coinstantaneous non-diabetic nephropathy included 66 IgA nephropathy(53%),38 membranous nephropathy(31%),7 Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis(6%),5 hepatitis associated nephritis(4%),1 lipoprotein nephropathy(1%) and 7 other types nephropathy(5%). Conclusion:The incidence of type 2 diabetic nephropathy was increased notably during 2001 to 2007.The age of the patients was younger.Non-diabetic nephropathy was not rare in patients with diabetic mellitus.So renal biopsy is necessary and important for diagnosis and treatment in patients with diabetic mellitus accompanied with nephropathy.",

        "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the predictors of changes in blood pressure (BP) with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment in hypertensive patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).Seventy-one hypertensive patients with CHD and OSA were enrolled in this study. Daytime systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and anthropometric characteristics were assessed at baseline and follow-up.Sixty-six patients completed the study. The median follow-up period was 36 months (interquartile range, 24-60 months). The mean duration of CPAP application was 4.3 ± 1.2 hours per night. From baseline to follow-up, SBP and DBP were reduced by 5.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0-8.1) and 3.0 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.8-5.3), respectively. Daytime somnolence was significantly improved (ESS, from 9.5 ± 3.4 at baseline to 3.6 ± 2.0 at follow-up; P < 0.001); the mean improvement in ESS was 6.0 (95% CI, 5.1-6.9). Correlation analysis of the fall in mean BP (MBP) showed that baseline MBP, change in ESS, heart rate, and CPAP compliance showed a positive correlation, whereas the baseline body mass index (BMI) and ESS had an inverse relationship. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, however, indicated that only baseline BMI, baseline MBP, and CPAP compliance were independently correlated with the fall in MBP.Long-term CPAP treatment reduces BP in hypertensive patients with CHD and moderate/severe OSA; baseline BMI, baseline MBP, and CPAP compliance are independent predictors of the decrease in BP with CPAP treatment in these patients.",

        "abstract": "Developing high-voltage Mg-compatible electrolytes (u003e3.0 V vs Mg) still remains to be the biggest Ru0026D challenge in the area of nonaqueous rechargeable Mg batteries. Here, the key design concepts toward exploring new boron-based Mg salts in a specific way of highlighting the implications of anions are proposed for the first time. The well-defined boron-centered anion-based magnesium electrolyte (BCM electrolyte) is successfully presented by facile one-step mixing of tris(2H-hexafluoroisopropyl) borate and MgF2 in 1,2-dimethoxyethane, in which the structures of anions have been thoroughly investigated via mass spectrometry accompanied by NMR and Raman spectra. The first all-round practical BCM electrolyte fulfills all requirements of easy synthesis, high ionic conductivity, wide potential window (3.5 V vs Mg), compatibility with electrophilic sulfur, and simultaneously noncorrosivity to coin cell assemblies. When utilizing the BCM electrolyte, the fast-kinetics selenium/carbon (Se/C) cathode achieves the best rate capability and the sulfur/carbon (S/C) cathode exhibits an impressive prolonged cycle life than previously published reports. The BCM electrolyte offers the most promising avenue to eliminate the major roadblocks on the way to high-voltage Mg batteries and the design concepts can shed light on future exploration directions toward high-voltage Mg-compatible electrolytes.",

        "abstract": "The study area,located in the middle part of Altyn slope zone in the Qaidam Basin,spans three structural units including Qaidam Basin,Altyn fault and Suoerkuli Basin. The Altyn slope zone generally characterized with an approximately south-dip ramp is a curved surface varying in three-dimension,and the trend of its envelope surface is almost consistent with that of the Altyn fault. The Altyn slope zone consists of near-E-W-trending anticlines associated with the Altyn fault,which gradually converge towards the fault. In the foreland of the Altyn Mts,the slope zone is characterized with a series of oblique nose structures,presenting a regular change of wide and gentle alternate uplift and depression. In most parts,it presents as the forelimb of the large-scale anticline resulted from the thrusting of stacking-type duplex structure to south from north. Based on the growth strata of the forelimb,the formation of Altyn fault began at the deposition of the upper member of the Xiaganchaigou Formation (38Ma),the fault has been active until now. The active intensity of the fault was weak during the deposition period from the upper member of the Xiaganchaigou Formation to the upper Shangyoushashan Formation (38~8.1Ma),and became strong since the deposition of Shizigou Formation (8.1Ma).",

The experimental results showed that 2MgO · 2B2O3 · MgCl2 · 14H2O dissolved congruently in 4.5% H3BO3 aqueous solution, which was different from the process of the dissolution of 2MgO · 2B2O3 · MgCl2 · 14H2O in water. The final crystal solid phase was kurnakovite(2MgO · 3B2O3 · 15H2O). The kinetic equations of the crystallization reaction were given with the aid of Simplex Optimum Method and Runge-Kutta digital solution of differential equation system, a mechanism of dissolution and transformation and the formation condition of kurnakovite in Qinghai-Tibetan plateau were proposed and discussed.",

Ten subjects with acute cellular rejection received a repeat biopsy. All samples were stained with CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, and human leukocyte antigen DR by immunochemical staining. Levels of these markers were compared among the subgroups of each group.Human leukocyte antigen DR expression was greater in the early C4d-negative acute rejection group than it was in the early C4d-positive acute rejection group. Human leukocyte antigen DR expression was greater during acute rejection than that was on a repeat biopsy. Human leukocyte antigen DR expression was accord with the infiltration of monocyte infiltration in the acute cellular rejection group. Human leukocyte antigen DR expression was greater during late acute rejection than it was in BK virus nephropathy, which was not in accord with monocyte infiltration. Human leukocyte antigen DR expression was greater during chronic rejection than it was in IgAN, BK virus nephropathy, and TA/IF groups, and even in tubular atrophy.Human leukocyte antigen DR expression in renal tubular cells was associated with early acute cellular rejection and was in accord with monocyte infiltration. Human leukocyte antigen DR expression in renal tubular cells during the late phase (especially in tubular atrophy) was a marker of chronic rejection, but was not in accord with monocyte infiltration in renal allografts.",

H 2 C 2 O 4  and H 2 O 2  leaching studies indicated that the selective leaching of metals in the residues, that primarily contain Zn, Cu, Fe, SiO 2 , Ga and Ge, can be achieved. Under the optimal leaching conditions ([H 2 C 2 O 4 ] = 110 g/L, [H 2 O 2 ] = 0.12 mol/L, L/S ratio = 8, T = 40 °C and t = 30 min), 99.32% of the Ga, 98.86% of the Ge and 30.25% of the Fe were leached out, whereas the leaching of Zn, Cu and Si only reached 0.30%, 0.82% and 0.43%, respectively. Concerning leachate purification, 98.31% of the iron could be removed in the form of FeC 2 O 4 ·2H 2 O with minor losses of Ga and Ge (1.08% and 0.68%) using an ultrasound-assisted iron powder replacement method under optimal conditions. The Ga (99.36%) and Ge (99.89%) were subsequently extracted by tri(octyl-decyl)amine (N235). After extraction, the loaded organic phase was stripped of Ga (98.91%) and Ge (99.21%) into separate solutions using sequential treatments of 2 mol/L H 2 SO 4  and 4 mol/L NaOH respectively. Based on these results, a process flow sheet of efficient separation and recovery of Ga and Ge is presented.",

        "title": "Retrieval of Aerosol Fine-Mode Fraction from Intensity and Polarization Measurements by PARASOL over East Asia.",
        "abstract": "The fine-mode fraction (FMF) of aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a key optical parameter that represents the proportion of fine particles relative to total aerosols in the atmosphere. However, in comparison to ground-based measurements, the FMF is still difficult to retrieve from satellite observations, as attempted by a Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) algorithm. In this paper, we introduce the retrieval of FMF based on Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Science coupled with Observations from a Lidar (PARASOL) data. This method takes advantage of the coincident multi-angle intensity and polarization measurements from a single satellite platform. In our method, we use intensity measurements to retrieve the total AOD and polarization measurements to retrieve the fine-mode AOD. The FMF is then calculated as the ratio of the retrieved fine-mode AOD to the total AOD. The important processes in our method include the estimation of the surface intensity and polarized reflectance by using two semi-empirical models, and the building of two sets of aerosol retrieval lookup tables for the intensity and polarized measurements via the 6SV radiative transfer code. We apply this method to East Asia, and comparisons of the retrieved FMFs for the Beijing, Xianghe and Seoul_SNU sites with those of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground-based observations produce correlation coefficients (R2) of 0.838, 0.818, and 0.877, respectively. However, the comparison results are relatively poor (R2 = 0.537) in low-AOD areas, such as the Osaka site, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the satellite observations.",

Lymphocyte subsets were measured using flow cytometry in 66 patients with clinically-confirmed IMN and in 40 healthy control subjects. Compared with healthy subjects, the number of peripheral blood B lymphocytes was significantly increased in IMN patients and that of regulatory T-cells was significantly decreased, accompanied by an increased CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell ratio. There was no relationship between the number of peripheral blood B lymphocytes and markers of kidney function. Although the number of infiltrating B lymphocytes in the kidney of IMN patients was higher, there was no relationship with the number of peripheral blood B lymphocytes. In conclusion, there was no relationship between peripheral blood B lymphocytes and disease activity, suggesting that peripheral blood B lymphocytes are not a biomarker of disease activity and therapeutic efficacy in IMN.",

        "abstract": "A graphene/titanium nitride (G/TiN) hybrid as an anode material of lithium ion batteries is prepared by a simple in situ hydrolysis method combined with ammonia annealing. TiN nanoparticles as obtained are ∼5 nm in size and homogeneously anchored on G. The G/TiN hybrid anode delivers a reversible capacity as high as 646 mA h g -1 at 20 mA g -1 and exhibits an enhanced initial coulombic efficiency of 75%, much higher than that of pure graphene (G: 52%) in the first cycle. The capacity retention is as much as 86% after 200 cycles. At a current density of 2000 mA g -1, the hybrid anode still retains 325 mA h g -1 while that of G is only 98 mA h g -1. It is demonstrated that the G/TiN hybrids display a superior electrochemical performance owing to the highly efficient mixed (electron and Li +) conducting network. The internal defects between G layers induced by nitrogen-doping in G/TiN may improve reversible Li storage, whereas the catalytic sites on the surface of G related to the decomposition of the electrolyte may be occupied by TiN, leading to a decreased irreversible capacity. Moreover, the formation of Li 3N in the interface is beneficial to interface transport, which is confirmed by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. The anchoring of TiN nanoparticles on G is promising prospect for energy storage applications in high performance lithium-ion batteries. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To investigate whether calcineurin expression or not in podocytes of patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Methodology:The renal calcineurin subunit A α, β, γ isoforms (CnAα,β, γ) were detected by immunohistochemistry in sixty-three adult nephrotic, biopsy-proven idopathic FSGS patients. Twenty-four cases with minimal change disease (MCD), and 10 donor renal grafts were regarded as control. CnAα and synaptopodin by immunofluorescence double staining was performed. The precise location of CnAα in glomeruli was confirmed by colloidal gold immunoelectron microscopy. Immunostaining was scored by two pathologists in a double-blind manner. Results:Mild expression of CnAα and CnAβ without CnAγ were found in renal tubules from donor renal grafts, while calcineurin wasn’t observed in glomeruli. CnAα expression was up-regulated in podocytes in cases with FSGS, however, CnAβ and CnAγ were negative. CnAα expression in podocytes increased in 26 (41.27%) FSGS cases, while all MCD were negative (P<0.01). Serum creatinine, urinary rentiol binding protein, pathological variants were significant different between podocyte CnAα posivtie and negative FSGS cases (P<0.05). Podocyte CnAα posivte cases in Collapsing, Celluar, Tip, Hillar variant were 5 (83.33%), 10 (66.67%), 8 (61.54%) and 3 (20%), respectively, but none in NOS(P<0.01). Serum creatinine (OR 4.855,P<0.01), collapsing variant (OR 11.069,P<0.05) were critical factors for CnAα overexpression in podocytes of FSGS by Logistic regression. Synaptopodin was decreased and discontinued in 69.23% cases with podocyte CnAα overexpression. Conclusion:We demonstrated that CnAα expresssion was upregulated in podocytes of some adult idopathic FSGS, which may be involved in the aggressive course. Differential expression of CnAα in podocytes suggests different pathogenic mechanism among FSGS variants and MCD. Detection of CnAα in podocytes is useful in distinction of FSGS versus MCD in renal biopsies without defining lesions.",

        "abstract": "It is suggested that non-HLA endothelial antigens may also cause C4d-positive acute rejection, but this is very rare. We report on three renal allograft recipients who developed C4d-positive acute rejection with detectable circulating antiendothelial cell antibodies (AECAs). All patients had severe dialysis-dependent graft dysfunction. Histologic manifestations include neutrophils infiltration on peritubular capillaries and glomeruli. Endoarteritis can be seen in all the patients. Two patients lost grafts after the rescue therapy including immunoadsorption, mycophenolate mofetil with or without tacrolimus. The titer variation of AECAs might be associated with the graft outcome. In patients those who lost grafts, AECAs titer increased from 1:10 to 1:80 in one patient, and was kept positive during the treatment in the other patient. In the recovered patient, however, the titer became negative from 1:40. From our report, it appears that persisting circulating AECAs during the rescue treatment of C4d-positive acute rejection may be associated with a poor outcome.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the clinicopathological features and outcome of idiopathic IgA nephropathy with diffuse crescent formation in Chinese patients.Twenty-five patients with diffuse crescentic IgA nephropathy (DCIgAN), 15 males and 10 females with median age of 28.5, and median disease duration of 5.1 months, were studied. Their clinical, laboratory and pathological features and outcome were investigated. Twenty-one were administered pulse immunosuppressive therapy, and 15 were followed up for more than 6 months.1.14% had total IgA nephropathy, and 16.4% total diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis. Clinically, most of patients (88%) showed rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with a high level of serum creatinine (418 +/- 264 micromol/l). Gross hematuria was noted in 72%, hypertension in 64%, and nephrotic syndrome in 48%. Pathologically, except for diffuse crescent formation (a median 65% and range 50-95%), we observed segmental necrosis of glomerular capillaries in 60%, glomerular infiltrating cells in 48%, endothelial cells proliferation in 32%, and rupture of Bowmans' capsule in 24%. Severe tubular interstitial damage was also found, tubular atrophy in 64%, interstitial fibrosis in 60%, diffuse interstitial infiltrating cells in 74%, and interstitial vasculitis in 40%. Immunopathologically, four phenotypes were observed; however, IgA associated with IgM deposition was higher than that in patients with general IgA nephropathy (IgAN). In addition, the infiltrating CD4+, CD8+, CD68+ and PCNA+ cells in renal tissue were significantly high compared with that in controls. In a follow-up study, 66.7% of patients had life-sustaining renal function, 4 of them had normal range of serum creatinine (<124 micromol/l), and only 5 were dialysis-dependent.The patients with crescentic IgA nephropathy mostly show rapidly progressive nephritis associated with more severe pathological changes including glomerular, tubular interstitial and vascular lesions than in patients with general IgAN. The infiltrates in glomeruli may contribute to the crescentic formation, and the intensive immune suppressing treatment is useful to improve renal damage in patients with DCIgAN.",

        "abstract": "A new synthetic method of szaibelyite (2MgO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O) has been reported. The enthalpy of solution of 2MgO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O in 2.9842 mol dm −3 HCl (aq) was determined. From a combination of this result with measured enthalpies of solution of H 3 BO 3 in 2.9842 mol dm −3 HCl (aq) and of MgO in (HCl+H 3 BO 3 ) solution, together with the standard molar enthalpies of formation of MgO (s), H 3 BO 3 (s), and H 2 O (l), the standard molar enthalpy of formation of −(2884.36±1.82) kJ mol −1 of 2MgO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O was obtained. Keywords Szaibelyite Synthesis Standard molar enthalpy of formation Solution calorimetry 1 Introduction There are many kinds of magnesium borates, both natural and synthetic. Some of them have useful properties, such as 2MgO·B 2 O 3 (Mg 2 B 2 O 5 ) and 2MgO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O might be prepared as whisker materials [1] . 2MgO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O named szaibelyite (ascharite) is a magnesium borate mineral with a structure formula of Mg 2 [OH][B 2 O 4 (OH)] [2] . Recently, we also found a new synthetic method for it when we investigated the phase transformation of 2MgO·2B 2 O 3 ·MgCl 2 ·14H 2 O in boric acid solution. The advantages of this method consist in the natural material of 2MgO·2B 2 O 3 ·MgCl 2 ·14H 2 O which was obtained from the natural concentrated salt lake brine [3] , relatively lower hydrothermal reaction temperature. Thermodynamic properties play very important roles in scientific research and industrial applications. Li et al. [4] reported the standard molar enthalpy of formation of eight hydrated magnesium borates. This paper reports this new synthesis method and the standard molar enthalpy of formation of 2MgO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O. 2 Experimental 2MgO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O could be synthesized by the dissolution and phase transformation of double salt 2MgO·2B 2 O 3 ·MgCl 2 ·14H 2 O in boric acid solution at hydrothermal condition as follows: 1.86 g (3.28×10 −3 mol) 2MgO·2B 2 O 3 ·MgCl 2 ·14H 2 O (synthesized by modification of the literature method [5] ), 1.85 g (2.99×10 −2 mol) H 3 BO 3 , and 20 ml H 2 O were put in the lining of small autoclave (40 ml). The mixture was stirred for 0.5 h, and placed in an oven at 180 °C. The autoclave was cooled naturally and opened after reaction 3 days. The solid phase was separated, washed thoroughly with hot distilled water, and then with alcohol and ether. Finally, the solid phase was dried at 80 °C to constant mass. The synthetic sample was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (Rigaku D/MAX-IIIC), FT-IR spectroscopy (Bruker Equinox 55 spectrometer with KBr pellets at room temperature), TG (Perkin-Elmer TGA7, at a heating rate of 10 K min −1 in flowing N 2 ). The chemical compositions of the sample were determined by EDTA titration for Mg 2+ , by NaOH standard solution in the presence of mannitol for B 2 O 3 , and by difference for H 2 O. 2MgO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O can be regarded as the product of the following reaction: (l) 2 MgO ( s )+2 H 3 BO 3 ( s )= Mg 2 B 2 O 5 · H 2 O ( s )+2 H 2 O 2MgO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O is one of the most difficult to dissolve of the magnesium borates, so the enthalpies of solution of 2MgO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O, of H 3 BO 3 in approximately 3 mol dm −3 HCl (aq), and of the calculated amount of MgO in aqueous (hydrochloric acid+boric acid) which consisted of approximately 3 mol dm −3 HCl (aq) and the calculated amount of H 3 BO 3 were determined. The standard molar enthalpy of formation of 2MgO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O could be obtained by solution calorimetry as above in combination with the standard molar enthalpies of formation of MgO (s), H 3 BO 3 (s), and H 2 O (l).The HCl solvent was prepared from analytical grade hydrochloric acid and deionized water, and its concentration, 2.9842 mol l −1 , was determined by titration with standard sodium carbonate, and its density, 1.053 g cm −3 , was taken from Soviet Chemical Handbook [6] . A RD496-III heat conduction microcalorimeter (Southwest Institute of Electron Engineering, China) was used and has been described in detail previously [7] . The temperature of the calorimetric experiment was 298.15 K. Additional double-layer glass tubes were put in the 15 ml stainless steel sample cell and reference cell of the calorimeter. This was done to prevent corrosion of the stainless steel sample and reference cell by HCl (aq). The lining in the double-layer glass tube containing HCl (aq) was broken by a rod after thermal equilibration for at least 2 h, and the HCl (aq) was mixed with solid sample in the outer glass tube, then the thermal effect was recorded automatically on a computer. Total time required for the complete reaction was about 0.5 h for H 3 BO 3 (s) and MgO (s), 1 h for 2MgO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O. There were no solid residues observed after the reactions in each calorimetric experiment. 3 Results and discussion Chemical analysis results of synthetic sample: MgO, 47.21%; B 2 O 3 , 41.43%; H 2 O, 11.36%; mole ratio of MgO:B 2 O 3 :H 2 O=1.97:1.00:1.06. TG curve indicates that the total loss is 10.78% in the range of 691∼933∼1043 K, which corresponds to the loss of one water molecule and can be compared with calculated value of 10.70%. The d (nm) values of XRD spectrum are 0.6232, 0.5181, 0.3020, 0.2980, 0.2659, 0.2599, 0.2569, 0.2536, 0.2429, 0.2318, 0.2304, 0.2202, 0.2079, 0.1554, 0.1548. FT-IR spectrum of synthetic sample exhibited the following absorptions and they were assigned referring to literature [8] . The band at 3561 and 3427 cm −1 is the stretching of O–H. The bands at 1461, 1400 and 1015, 981, 926 cm −1 might be the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of B(3)–O, respectively. The band at 1227 cm −1 is the in-plane bending of B–O–H. The strong band at 709, 627 cm −1 is the out-of-plane bending of B(3)–O. The weak band at 560 cm −1 is the in-plane bending of B(3)–O. No impurity lines were observed. The synthetic sample is suitable for the following calorimetric experiments. To check the performance of RD496-III heat conduction microcalorimeter, calorimetric measurements on the enthalpies of solution of KCl (spectral purity) in deionized water and of THAM (trishydroxymethylaminomethane) in 0.1 mol dm −3 HCl (aq) were made, respectively. The average experimental values 17.23±0.04 kJ mol −1 of Δ sol H m ∝ of KCl (s) and −(29.75±0.04) kJ mol −1 of THAM are in excellent agreement with those of 17.234 kJ mol −1 reported in the literature [9] and −(29.73±0.04) kJ mol −1 reported in the literature [4] , respectively. This shows that the device for measuring the enthalpy of solution used in this work is reliable. The results of the calorimetric measurements are given in Tables 1–3 , in which Δ sol H m is the molar enthalpy of solution of solute, and the uncertainty is estimated as twice the standard deviation of the mean, namely, δ=2 ∑(x i − x ̄ ) 2 /n(n−1) , in which n is the experimental number ( n =5), x i the experimental value of each series of repeated measurement and x ̄ the mean value. Table 4 gives the thermochemical cycle for the derivation of the standard molar enthalpy of formation of 2MgO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O. The two solutions after reactions (2) and (3) had the same value of refraction index n 25 of 1.3558 (A 2WA-J type of Abbe refractometer, Shanghai, China), indicating that their thermodynamic states were the same and the thermochemical cycle designed in Table 4 was correct. The standard molar enthalpies of formation of H 2 O (l), MgO (s), and H 3 BO 3 (s) were taken from the CODATA Key Values [10] , namely −(285.830±0.040), −(601.60±0.30), and −(1094.8±0.8) kJ mol −1 , respectively. The enthalpy of dilution HCl (aq) was calculated from the NBS tables [11] . From these data, the standard molar enthalpy of formation of 2MgO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O was calculated to be −(2884.36±1.82) kJ mol −1 . A similar compound 2MgO·B 2 O 3 ·2H 2 O was obtained by the phase transformation of 2MgO·2B 2 O 3 ·MgCl 2 ·14H 2 O in water at 120 °C. It is easy to dissolve in 1 mol dm −3 HCl (aq). So the standard molar enthalpy of formation of −(3185.78±1.91) kJ mol −1 of 2MgO·B 2 O 3 ·2H 2 O was obtained by solution calorimetry of it in 1 mol dm −3 HCl (aq) [12] . The difference between the two values is −301.42, which near the −290.42 kJ mol −1 of Δ f H ° m of structural water and might result from the difference of one structural water between these two molecules.

        "abstract": "Pathological glomerulus classification plays a key role in the diagnosis of nephropathy. As the difference between different subcategories is subtle, doctors often refer to slides from different staining methods to make decisions. However, creating correspondence across various stains is labor-intensive, bringing major difficulties in collecting data and training a vision-based algorithm to assist nephropathy diagnosis. This paper provides an alternative solution for integrating multi-stained visual cues for glomerulus classification. Our approach, named generator-to-classifier (G2C), is a two-stage framework. Given an input image from a specified stain, several generators are first applied to estimate its appearances in other staining methods, and a classifier follows to combine these visual cues for decision making. These two stages are optimized in a joint manner. To provide a reasonable initialization for the generators, we train an unpaired image-to-image translation network for each stain, and fine-tune them with the classifier. Since there are no publicly available datasets for glomerulus classification, we collect one by ourselves. Experiments reveal the effectiveness of our approach, including the authenticity of the generated patches so that doctors can hardly distinguish them from the real ones. We also transfer our model to a public dataset for breast cancer classification, and outperform the state-of-the-arts significantly",

        "abstract": "Covert communication can prevent the opponent from knowing that a wireless communication has occurred. In the additive white Gaussian noise channels, if we only take the ambient noise into account, a square root law was obtained and the result shows that Alice can reliably and covertly transmit $mathcal{O}(sqrt{n})$ bits to Bob in $n$ channel uses. If additional  node closest to the adversary can produce artificial noise to aid in hiding the communication, the covert throughput can be improved. In this paper, we consider the covert communication in noisy wireless networks, where potential transmitters form a stationary Poisson point process. Alice wishes to communicate covertly to Bob without being detected by the warden Willie. In this scenario, Bob and Willie not only experience the ambient noise, but also the aggregated interference simultaneously. Although the random interference sources are not in collusion with Alice and Bob, our results show that uncertainty in noise and interference experienced by Willie is beneficial to Alice. When the distance between Alice and Willie $d_{a,w}=omega(n^{delta/4})$ ($delta=2/alpha$ is stability exponent), Alice can reliably and covertly transmit $mathcal{O}(log_2sqrt{n})$ bits to Bob in $n$ channel uses, and there is no limitation on the transmit power of transmitters. Although the covert throughout is lower than the square root law and the friendly jamming scheme, the spatial throughout of the network is higher, and Alice does not presuppose to know the location of Willie. From the network perspective, the communications are hidden in the noisy wireless networks, and what Willie sees is merely a emph{shadow} wireless network where he knows for certain some nodes are transmitting, but he cannot catch anyone red-handed.",

Methodology:DNA was extracted from 200 patients with IgAN, 90 patients with HSPN, 45 patients with MPA and 100 healthy volunteers. The polymorphism of the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) gene was analyzed using PCR. The clinical and pathological features of IgAN with different genotypes were analyzed. The patients with IgAN were divided into 6 groups according to their clinicopathological manifestations. They were: crescentic (Cres.,16 cases), recurrent gross hematuria (R-GH, 27), mass proteinuria (MP, 21), hypertension(HT, 42), isolated microscopic hematuria (I-H, 5) and asymptomatic abnormal urinalysis (U-ab, 89 cases). The distribution of IL-1ra alleles was compared among different types of IgAN, HSPN, MPA patients and normal controls. Results:There was no significant difference in the allele frequency and carriage rate of IL1RN*2 between patients with IgAN and healthy controls. The patients carrying IL1RN*2 showed higher incidence of R-GH, severe hematuria during the interval stage of gross hematuria, more crescent formation and increase rate of cellular/fibrocellular crescents, higher frequency of segmental glomerular necrosis than that in IgAN patients without IL1RN*2(P<0.05). The carriage rate of IL1RN*2 was significantly higher in patients with Cres. IgAN than that in other subgroups of IgAN and normal controls (P<0.05). As to HSPN patients, the allele frequency and carriage rate of IL1RN*2 were higher than that in healthy controls, and patients carrying IL1RN*2 also showed more crescent formation and increase rate of cellular/fibrocellular crescents, higher frequency of segmental glomerular necrosis than that in patients without IL1RN*2(P<0.05). However, MPA patients did not share the congenerous IL-1ra gene polymorphism. In addition, there was no statistical difference of the IL1RN*2 carriage rate between Cres.IgAN and HSPN. The IL1RN*2 carriage rate of Cres.IgAN patients was actually close to that of HSPN patients with the rates of crescents more than 15%. Conclusion:The carriage rate of IL1RN*2 in patients with Cres. IgAN was significantly higher than that in other subgroups of IgAN and normal controls. IL1RN*2 allele was associated with the occurrence of both Cres.IgAN and HSPN, and the carriage rate of IL1RN*2 in Cres.IgAN patients was actually close to that in HSPN patients whose crescents were more than 15%. Our data suggested that IL1RN*2 allele may be a genetic link between Cres. IgA N and HSPN.",

        "abstract": "By allowing the mixture of information at the source and intermediate nodes, network coding benefits network protocols with increased throughput and higher reliability. However, such mixture makes network coding systems suffering pollution attacks, in which malicious nodes inject corrupted packets into the information flow. Previous solutions are either computationally expensive or too ineffective to limit pollution attacks with arbitrary collusion among malicious nodes. In this paper, we propose an efficient authentication scheme, STNC, which allows intermediate nodes to efficiently detect corrupted packets by using space and time properties of network coding. Our work is an innovative space and time based solution to frustrate pollution attacks with arbitrary collusion among malicious nodes, and the security of STNC scheme relies on the asymmetry of time in packet verification. We also present security analysis and simulations of our scheme, and results demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of STNC scheme.",

        "title": "ROUTE: run-time robust reducer workload estimation for MapReduce.",
        "abstract": "MapReduce has become a popular model for large-scale data processing in recent years. Many works on MapReduce scheduling e.g., load balancing and deadline-aware scheduling have emphasized the importance of predicting workload received by individual reducers. However, because the input characteristics and user-specified map function of a given job are unknown to the MapReduce framework before the job starts, accurately predicting workload of reducers can be a difficult challenge. To address this challenge, we present ROUTE, a run-time robust reducer workload estimation technique for MapReduce. ROUTE progressively samples the partition size of the early completed mappers, allowing ROUTE to perform estimation at run time yet fulfilling the accuracy requirement specified by users. Moreover, by using robust estimation and bootstrapping resampling techniques, ROUTE can achieve high applicability to a wide variety of applications. Through experiments using both real and synthetic data on an 11-node Hadoop cluster, we show ROUTE can achieve high accuracy with error rate no more than 10.92% and an improvement of 40.6% in terms of error rate while compared with the state-of-the-art solution. Besides, through simulations using synthetic data, we show that ROUTE is robust to a variety of skewed distributions. Finally, we apply ROUTE to existing load balancing and deadline-aware scheduling frameworks and show ROUTE significantly improves the performance of these frameworks.

        "abstract": "Obesity is a common risk factor for several diseases. Obesity related hormone and increased insulin resistance (IR) may contribute to the effects of obstructive sleep apnoea on cardiovascular consequences. We investigated ghrelin and IR in non-diabetic apnoeic patients with stable coronary heart disease and assessed the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).Plasma ghrelin, glucose and insulin were measured in 22 patients with CPAP and 22 matched controls without CPAP at baseline and three months. Indexes including homeostasis model assessment IR (HOMA IR), HOMA S and HOMA β were calculated for the assessment of IR, insulin sensitivity and pancreatic β cell function.At three months follow-up, plasma ghrelin levels and HOMA IR in CPAP group were significantly decreased (P=0.002 and 0.046, respectively) while those in control group increased significantly (P=0.012 and 0.009, respectively). Significant moderate correlations were found between ghrelin vs. HOMA IR and ghrelin vs. HOMA S after CPAP, however, for those without CPAP, no significant associations were observed.Short-term effective continuous positive airway pressure had a significant effect on lowering plasma ghrelin levels and IR, but not body fat. Further large scale and longer term studies are warranted to corroborate these findings.",

        "title": "The long noncoding RNA LOC105374325 causes podocyte injury in individuals with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.",
        "abstract": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a common kidney disease that results in nephrotic syndrome. FSGS arises from dysfunction and apoptosis of podocytes in the glomerulus of the kidney, leading to podocytopathy. The molecular mechanisms underlying podocyte apoptosis remain incompletely understood. Using an array of gene expression profiling, PCR and in situ hybridization assay, we found here that the levels of the long noncoding RNA LOC105374325 were elevated in the renal podocytes of individuals with FSGS. We also observed that the microRNAs miR-34c and miR-196a/b down-regulated the expression of the apoptosis regulators BCL2-associated X, apoptosis regulator (Bax) and BCL2 antagonist/killer 1 (Bak) in podocytes. Competitive binding between LOC105374325 and miR-34c or miR-196a/b increased Bax and Bak levels and caused podocyte apoptosis. Of note, the mitogen-activated protein kinase P38 and the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) up-regulated LOC105374325 expression. P38 inhibition or C/EBPβ silencing decreased LOC105374325 levels and inhibited apoptosis in Adriamycin-treated podocytes. LOC105374325 overexpression decreased miR-34c and miR-196a/b levels, increased Bax and Bak levels, and induced proteinuria and focal segmental lesions in mice. In conclusion, the activation of the P38/C/EBPβ pathway stimulates the expression of LOC105374325, which, in turn, increases Bax and Bak levels and causes apoptosis by competitively binding to miR-34c and miR-196a/b in the podocytes of individuals with FSGS.",
