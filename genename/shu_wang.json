        "abstract": "This article is concerned with the concept and practice that are estranged from us day by day,that is,the traditional interest in natural objects and their appearances in respect of paintings,gardens,implements and architectures in China.The interest does not come from a self-absorbed analytical rationality but comes from the firm belief that natural appearance of landscape can have an influence on the living condition and the destiny of human beings.Various patterns are drawn from a long term experience of observing the nature, which are in most accordance with the transcendental natural patterns and are quantified systematically in some special way.Nevertheless,this quantization does not mean the lost of intuitive judgment on natural object.Therefore,the related thinking and practices are not just debates,but a kind of narration on the patterns and verification with regard to nature.Or in other words, different from the literature,it is the narration about the construction itself.The verification not only means to be in accordance with nature,but also means to make adjustments on nature according to the\"principle\".It must involve a kind of construction geometry,which is evidently not the Euclidean geometry,but a kind of narration and geometry of the natural appearance.",

        "abstract": "Chinese and Western architectural traditions were once both eco-friendly.At present,if we go beyond ideological differences,the most commonly shared issue between East and West is that of ecology. In terms of architecture,there are lessons to be gleaned from tradition;that means contemporary architecture in China needs to learn more from rural practice.There is not only a need to study the concepts and building process of architecture,also a need to study and advocate a lifestyle that naturally and harmoniously integrates nature and man.Such a lifestyle has been suppressed in China for almost a century.We believe that a new order of architectural activity would be formed,which surpasses urban and rural differences,blends architecture and landscaping, breaks the barriers between professionalism and amateurism,focuses on the relationship between architecture and nature,and will surely bring about a fundamental change to architecture.Architecture is now undergoing a shift from the traditional idea of landscaping to one of modern.We are especially short of deep reflections on architecture,from which new ideas and methodologies will be revived.",

The AW interview with Wang Shu reveals an artisangrappling with the philosophical and practical consequences that world recognition hasbrought to him personally and to contemporary Chinese architecture more generally. From1990-1998, Wang Shu worked with ordinary craftsmen, learning to construct buildings anddeveloping perspective on traditional architecture through hands-on experience. His decisionto leave the expertise and modernity of the city was deliberate and reflected a convictionthat there was much to be learned in China\u2019s rural areas, where tradition still shaped buildingdesign, the choice of construction materials, and the relationship between a building and itsnatural location. Since then, Wang Shu has used insights and values from that seminal timeto create a distinct architectural style that evoke the past, without making direct referencesto history. Consequently, by invoking traditional gardens as particular negotiation of therelationship between nature and culture, tradition and the contemporary, Wang Shu\u2019s worksnot only actualize an attitude toward and valuation of the function of tradition in contemporaryarchitecture, but also present a challenge to Chinese architects and urban planners \u2013 whereare you building and why?",

It is especially dangerous that the social system and professinal system of our producing and manufacturing, seeming too mature to be questioned or changed, are virtually not well-done, which results in a shift of the focus to the aspects of style, form and taste and a neglection of the hidden subversive and critical power contained the involved relations between the human race and the society .The dialogue recorded in this article is a synthesis of these ideas metioned above.",

The result showed that standard amplification appeared in SVCV RNA,and Ct values of all samples and the control were similar,indicating that MNP could absorb SVCV particles effectively and release SVCV RNA. Twenty days after being extracted with MNP,the samples were detected positive still by the real-time RT-PCR,proved that the virus nucleic acid could be saved in normal atmospheric or lower temperature. In this way,samples could be handled on the spot,and carried conveniently,so the transportation cost could be reduced and the detection efficiency improved.",

In July 2012, continuous mortality of cultured hybrid sturgeons was occurred on a farm in Huairou.We isolated three pathogens from liver, kidney and spleen of the dying sturgeons with clinical symptoms, marked HRS12718L, HRS12718K and HRS12718S respectively. Then we analyzed theirs morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics, and drug sensitivity. We also cloned and partially sequenced the 16S rDNA of strain HRS12718K. Moreover, we identified the pathogenic characteristic of strain HRS12718K by artificial infection.The morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics of three strains were consistent with that of Streptococcus iniae isolated from other fishes in China, and 16S rDNA sequence of the strain HRS12718K was more than 99.1% homology with that of Streptococcus iniae. The LD50 of the pathogen to hybrid sturgeon was 4.42 x 10(5) CFU/mL, and challenged sturgeons presented the similar signs as the natural infected sturgeons. In addition, the bacterium was sensitive to norfloxacin, enrofloxacin, neomycin sulfate, doxycyline hyclate and tetracycline hydrochloride, and was highly sensitive to enrofloxacin.Streptococcus iniae was the pathogen to cultured hybrid sturgeons in Beijing area, and enrofloxacin can be used against the disease.",

Moreover, the pathogenic characteristic of presumptive pathogens was identified by artificial infection.The 16S rDNA sequence of the pathogen was more than 99% homology with that of Plesiomonas shigelloides, suggesting that the pathogen was P. shigelloides, which was also demonstrated by the results of biochemical tests. The LD50 of the pathogen to sturgeon was 1.0 x 10(5.8) CFU/mL, and it also can cause liver, kidey and spleen to lesions. There were no activities of amylase, caseinase, lipase, gelatinase and haemolysis of extracellular products of P. shigelloides, and its toxicity might be from endotoxin. In addition, the bacterium was specific sensitive to enrofloxacin, doxycyline hyclate, florfenicol and thiamphenicol with MIC less than 2 microg/mL.P. shigelloides was the main pathogen to cultured sturgeons in Beijing area, and enrofloxacin, doxycyline hyclate and florfenicol can be used against the disease.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between fractional cholesterol esterification rate in plasma or serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (FER(HDL)) and lipoprotein subfractions and other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors has been demonstrated. However, the current method for measuring FER(HDL) requires fresh serum samples and radioactive labeling of the samples, making it impractical for use in clinical laboratories. In this study, we developed a simple and precise HPLC method for the measurement of FER(HDL). Correlations between FER(HDL) and CVD risk factors were evaluated in 119 healthy volunteers.Fasting blood samples were collected and serum was isolated within 2 h. Serum HDL was prepared by precipitation of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins with dextran sulfate and magnesium chloride. HDL fractions were divided into two aliquots and incubated at 0\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, respectively, for 1 h. Free cholesterol in the HDL fractions was analyzed by HPLC. FER(HDL) was calculated as the percent decrease of free cholesterol during incubation.The esterification reaction of HDL free cholesterol was not linear, but the measured FER(HDL) was stable when serum samples were stored at room temperature for <4 h, or at 4\u00b0C for <24 h. The intra-assay and total CVs for FER(HDL) measurements were 1.0%-2.1% and 1.6%-3.8%, respectively. Results of 119 healthy volunteers showed that FER(HDL) was positively correlated with age, BMI, blood pressure, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and small dense low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDLb-C), and negatively correlated with HDL-C and HDL2-C. FER(HDL) has shown to be a predictor of HDL and LDL subfraction distributions.This method is simple, non-radioactive and precise and will be useful in prediction of lipoprotein subfraction distributions and in clinical assessment of CVD risks.",

Methods A total of 149 hospitalized patients underwent coronary angiography were included.Patients were divided into CAD group(n=97) and non CAD control group(n=52) according to coronary angiogram.Serum cotinine concentrations were determined by isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry(ID-LC/MS/MS). Results Serum cotinine levels of 149 subjects were shown skewed and leptokurtic distribution.Cotinine levels of smokers were significantly higher than non-smokers [12.64(0.91-99.61) \u03bcg/L vs.0.22(0.12-0.51) \u03bcg/L,P<0.001].CAD risk in the highest cotinine level group(>10 \u03bcg/L) was significantly higher than in the lowest group(<1 \u03bcg/L),the OR value was 2.94(95% CI: 1.11-7.78,P<0.05).With the increment of serum cotinine level,OR increased in parallel with dose-effect relationship(all P<0.05).Multifactor logistic regression analysis showed that diabetes,dyslipidemia and cotinine were the most marked risk factors(all P<0.05).Cotinine level was positively correlated with smoking(r=0.656,P<0.001) and white blood cell counts(WBC,r=0.257,P=0.010),and negatively correlated with HDL-C(r=-0.184,P=0.025) and HDL2-C(r=-0.217,P=0.008). Conclusions Serum cotinine can effectively reflect smoking exposure,and the increased serum level of cotinine is associated with the development of CAD.",

METHODS: The experiment was performed at the Key Laboratory of Geriatric Medicine of Ministry of Health from November 2005 to May 2006. Fresh human umbilical cord was obtained to culture HUVECs. The cells were assigned into \u2460normal control group, \u2461serum-free group: cultured for 24 hours in serum-free medium; \u2462low density lipoprotein group: cultured with 800 mg/L low density lipoprotein medium for 16 hours; \u2463danshen root and carthamus tinctorius extract pretreatment group: After pretreatment with danshen root and carthamus tinctorius extract (brand name: Danhong injection, concentrated solution provided by Shanxi Buchang Group, number Z 20026866/Z 20026867) for 24 hours, 800 mg/L low density lipoprotein was added to culture for 16 hours or culture in serum-free medium for 24 hours. The effect of danshen root and carthamus tinctorius extract on HUVECs was observed with MTT method. NOX4 mRNA level was analyzed with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Apoptotic rate was measured with flow cytometry and ROS production was detected with DCFH-DA method. RESULTS: \u2460NOX4 mRNA expression, ROS production and apoptotic rate in the low density lipoprotein group was 1.3 times, 1.2 times and 4 times of those in the normal control group. \u2461NOX4 mRNA expression, ROS production and apoptotic rate in the serum-free group was 1.4 times, 1.6 times and 3 times of those in the normal control group, respectively. \u2462NOX4 mRNA expression, ROS production and apoptotic rate in the danshen root and carthamus tinctorius extract pretreatment group was 0.4 times, 0.5 times and 0.2 times of those in the low density lipoprotein group, respectively. \u2463NOX4 mRNA expression, ROS production and apoptotic rate in the danshen root and carthamus tinctorius extract pretreatment group was 0.2 times, 0.5 times and 0.6 times of those in the serum-free group, respectively. CONCLUSION: Danshen root and carthamus tinctorius extract can effectively prevent the NOX4 mRNA expression under high-lipid and ischemic status so as to inhibit ROS production and apoptotic rate in HUVECs, and has effectively protective effect on endothelial cells.",

        "abstract": "Studies have shown a negative association between macrophage cholesterol efflux and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, the current methods for measuring cholesterol efflux require a radioactive tracer and involve a variety of cell treatments, making the measurement of macrophage cholesterol efflux impractical for use in clinical laboratories. In this study, we developed a non-radioactive and precise LC/MS/MS method for the measurement of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) mediated cholesterol efflux from J774 macrophages.J774 cells were seeded on 12-well plates at a density of 1.5\u00d710(5) cells/ml in H-DMEM medium, and when the cells were approximately 80% confluent, they were incubated with H-DMEM medium containing 2% FBS, 0.5 \u03bcg/ml ACAT inhibitor Sandoz 58-035, and 20 \u03bcg/ml [3,4-(13)C]cholesterol for 6 h. After washing and equilibrating the cells, HDL samples were added at a final concentration of 7% and incubated for 8 h. The cells were lysed, and [3,4-(13)C]cholesterol and cholesterol were measured by LC/MS/MS. Cholesterol efflux was expressed as the percent decrease of cell [3,4-(13)C]cholesterol mass during the incubation.When incubated with [3,4-(13)C]cholesterol enriched J774 cells, HDL mediated higher cell cholesterol efflux than influx compared to serum and isolated LDL; therefore, HDL was used as the extracellular acceptor. The results from healthy volunteers showed that the rate of cholesterol efflux was negatively correlated with weight, BMI, blood pressure, and FERHDL and positively correlated with HDL-C, HDL2-C, and apoAI levels.A LC/MS/MS method for the measurement of HDL mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophage cells has been established. This method is non-radioactive, precise and reliable and is potentially useful for the assessment of HDL function and cardiovascular disease risks.",

        "abstract": "In type 2 diabetes, pancreatic \u03b2-cells cannot secret enough insulin compensate for insulin resistance, which are often accompanied by abnormality in lipid metabolism such as hypertriglyceridemia. It is reported that oxidative stress is involved in pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction. However, molecular mechanisms linking between excessive generations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and \u03b2-cell dysfunction and apoptosis induced by high levels of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) are poorly understood. In this study, we test the hypothesis that NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)-derived ROS may play a key role in dysfunction and apoptosis of pancreatic \u03b2-cell induced by VLDL. Our results show that the ApoCIII transgenic mice displayed increased serum TG levels, enhanced generation of ROS and impaired insulin content in pancreatic \u03b2-cells. In vitro, the treatment of pancreatic NIT-1 cells with 1 mg/ml VLDL for 12 h stimulated NOX2-derived ROS generation, decreased expression and secretion of insulin. Furthermore, we found that VLDL induced dysfunction and apoptosis of pancreatic \u03b2-cells through JNK and p53 pathways, which were rescued by siRNA-mediated NOX2 reduction. In conclusion, our data demonstrate a critical role of NOX2-derived ROS in dysfunction and apoptosis through JNK and p53 pathways in pancreatic \u03b2-cells induced by VLDL.",

        "abstract": "Reversible phosphorylation has a critical role in the regulation of the activity of acetyl\u2011CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), which is associated with de novo lipogenesis. It has been shown that AMP\u2011activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates ACC1 on serine 79 and inhibits its activity; however, the mechanism of ACC1 dephosphorylation remains elusive. Protein phosphatase 4 (PP4), a ubiquitous serine/threonine phosphatase, regulates a variety of cellular functions; however, whether PP4 is involved in lipid metabolism has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, PP4 was identified as a novel regulator of ACC1, which is also involved in hepatic lipogenesis. The expression of PP4 was found to be significantly increased in the livers of db/db mice. Furthermore, pACC1\u2011Ser79/ACC1 levels were observed to be decreased and high triglyceride accumulation was found in the livers of db/db mice. Moreover, PP4 overexpression was observed to lead to a decreased pACC1\u2011Ser79/ACC1 ratio and subsequently an increased intracellular triglyceride content in mouse primary hepatocytes. PP4 was also found to directly interact with pACC1\u2011Ser79 in human HepG2 cells. In conclusion, the present study showed that PP4 may be a novel regulator in hepatic lipogenesis through dephosphorylating ACC1 on serine 79, suggesting that PP4 may be a promising therapeutic target in lipid metabolism disorders.",

        "abstract": "Aim To investigate the effect and mechanism of ferulic acid(FA) on the expression of adhesion molecules and oxidative stress in tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1(TNF-\u03b1)-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells(HUVEC).Methods An endothelial cell model of adhesion function damage was established by administration of TNF-\u03b1. The level of intercellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1(VCAM-1) was determined by Western blot.HUVEC viability and apoptosis were detected by MTT and Hoechst 33342 staining.Reactive oxygen species(ROS) production was measured by DHE staining.Adhesion assay of monocyte and HUVEC was used to detect endothelial cell adhesive function.Nuclear factor-\u03baB(NF-\u03baB) activation was detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining.Results The TNF-\u03b1 treatment caused a significant increase of ROS generation and the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in HUVEC,which was associated with a dramatic augmentation in phosphorylation of I-\u03baB and relocation of NF-\u03baB into the nuclei.However,TNF-\u03b1-induced ROS generation,ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 upregulation and NF-\u03baB relocation could be attenuated by pretreat ment of ferulic acid.Conclusion Ferulic acid could suppress TNF-\u03b1-induced adhesion molecule expression by blocking NF-\u03baB signal and inhibiting ROS generation in HUVECs,suggesting that ferulic acid could be a novel drug candidate for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.",

METHODS: The insulin resistance cell models were induced by TNF-\u03b1(4 ng/mL)to stimulate human hepatoma carcinoma cell HepG2. The cytotoxicity of HepG2 was observed by MTT. The concentrations of glucose in cell culture fluid of HepG2 were detected using a glucose oxidase assay kit. The levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species were detected by DCFH-DA fluorescent probe and flow cytometry. The expressions of JNK, p-JNK,IRS1 were measured by Western blotting. RESULTS:After HepG2 was stimulated by TNF-\u03b1, the glucose uptake was blocked,the glucose concentrations were significantly increased in cell culture fluid,the active oxygen levels were significantly increased in cells, the JNK was activated, the expression of IRS1 was decreased. Pioglitazone could significantly decrease the active oxygen levels,inhibit JNK phosphorylation,promote the expression of IRS1,improve insulin resistance. CONCLUSION: Pioglitazone could improve the insulin resistance condition by degrading oxidative stress levels and inhibiting JNK passway.",

        "abstract": "As a transcription factor mainly expressed in cardiovascular system, T-box 20 (Tbx20) plays an important role in embryonic cardiovascular system development and adult heart function. Here, we determined the mechanism by which Tbx20 regulates cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiomyopathies.We analyzed Tbx20 expression levels and apoptosis rates in normal and heart failure human autopsy heart samples. Female C57BL/6 mice were ovariectomized and treated with 17\u03b2-estradiol to determine Tbx20 expression levels. ROS production, TUNEL, DNA laddering, qRT-PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry and ChIP analyses were performed on male C57BL/6 transverse aortic constriction-induced heart failure samples and on neonatal rat ventricular myocytes that were treated with H2O2 to investigate the role of Tbx20 in estrogen-mediated heart protection.Tbx20 expression was down regulated during heart failure, accompanied by elevated cardiomyocyte apoptotic levels in humans and mice. H2O2 led to a concurrent decrease in Tbx20 expression and increase in apoptosis in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Tbx20 overexpression reduced H2O2-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and was associated with a profound inhibition of p38MAPK, Bax and caspase3 and the activation of Bcl-2. Estrogen was able to protect cardiomyocytes from H2O2-induced apoptosis by upregulating Tbx20 expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Tbx20 silencing increased oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells. Moreover, Tbx20 directly regulated Esrra expression to enhance the heart-protective effect of estrogen.These results indicate that Tbx20 functions as an important regulator of estrogen-mediated cardiomyocyte protection during oxidative stress, suggesting that estorgen-Tbx20-ERR-\u03b1 may represent a crucial regulatory cascade and a potential therapeutic target for heart failure.",

After extraction of serum lipids with isopropanol, CEFAs were separated on reversed phase liquid chromatography and detected by mass spectrometry in positive ion mode with multiple reaction monitor. Individual CEFA was quantified by peak area normalization method and expressed as molar percent of total CEFAs. The run time was less than 5 min and detection limits were from 0.31 to 14.50 \u00d7 10(-5)mmol/L. Recoveries of the CEFAs ranged from 91.85% to 104.83% with a mean of 99.12%. The intra and total CVs for the measurement of CEFAs were 0.87-7.70% and 1.02-7.65%, respectively. This LC-MS/MS method required no internal standards, eliminated natural isotope interferences, and provided reproducible and reliable results for 11 major CEFAs in human serum. This method can be used in monitoring and evaluating dietary fatty acid intake. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the associations between serum CEFAs and cardiovascular disease risk factors.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that Cardiac Shock Wave Therapy (CSWT) improves myocardial perfusion and cardiac function in a porcine model of chronic myocardial ischemia and also ameliorates myocardial ischemia in patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD). Apoptosis plays a key role in ischemic myocardial pathogenesis. However, it remains unclear whether CSWT is beneficial for ischemia/hypoxia (I/H)-induced myocardial cell apoptosis and by which mechanism CSWT could improve heart function. We put forward the hypothesis that CSWT might protect heart function during ischemia/hypoxia by decreasing apoptosis.We generated ischemia/hypoxia (I/H)-induced apoptosis in the H9c2 myoblast cell line to examine the CSWT function and possible mechanisms. H9c2 cells were treated under hypoxic serum-starved conditions for 24 h and then treated with or without CSWT (500 shots, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12mJ/mm(2)). The apoptotic cell rate was determined by flow cytometry assay, cell viability was examined by the MTT assay, nuclear fragmentation was detected by Hoechst 33342 staining, and the mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic pathway of apoptosis was assessed by the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 protein and Caspase3 activation.First, apoptosis could be induced by ischemia/hypoxia in H9c2 cells. Second, CSWT attenuates the cell death and decreases the H9c2 cell apoptosis rate induced by ischemia and hypoxia. Third, CSWT suppresses the expression of apoptosis molecules that regulate the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in H9c2 cells. Fourth, CSWT increases the phosphorylation of AKT, which indicates the activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway.These results indicate that CSWT exerts a protective effect against I/H-induced cell death, potentially by preventing the activation of components of the mitochondrial-dependent intrinsic apoptotic pathway. We also demonstrate that the PI3K-Akt pathway may be involved in the CSWT effects on apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To recognize the research status on the mechanism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NADPH oxidases in cell growth and death, and explore the effects of ROS and NADPH oxidases on cardiomyocyte differentiation. DATA SOURCES: A computer-based online search of Medline was undertaken for the articles about the action mechanism of reactive oxygen and NADPH oxidases in cell growth and death published in English between January 1997 and December 2003 with the key words of \"Reactive oxygen species, NADPH oxidase, Cardiomyocytes, Differentiation, Signal transduction\". STUDY SELECTION: Inclusive criteria: \u2460Articles on ROS production and structure and activation of NADPH oxidase and their action mechanism in cell growth and death; \u2461Research about the molecule mechanism of cardiomyocytes differentiation. The repetitive research and review articles were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION: Totally 132 articles about the action mechanism of ROS and NADPH oxidase and cardiomyocytes differentiation were collected, and 78 ones met the inclusive criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: \u2460ROS involved in pathogenesis of many diseases were mainly from intramitochondrial electron transport chains, and NADPH oxidase was closely related with ROS production; NADPH oxidase firstly found in phagocyte was a kind of multienzyme complex, and its activity was regulated by the concentration of Ca2+ in cells and mRNA expression of its subunits. \u2461At present, many researchers presumed that oxidative stress was a double-edged sword, and it two-ways regulated the cell proliferation and death, in which ROS served as the second messenger in the signal transduction. Recent data showed that ROS and NADPH oxidase played important roles in cardiomyocytes differentiation; however, it was not identified which subunit of NADPH oxidase expressed in myocardial cells and its detail regulative pathway. Those problems were important for further study in the molecule mechanism of cardiomyocytes differentiation. CONCLUSION: ROS including superoxide anion (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radical (OH-), are generated in cardiomyocytes mainly by a membrane-bound NADPH oxidase (NOX). The NOX-derived ROS, as the second passenger, play important roles in various intracellular signaling pathways. In cardiomyocytes, ROS have the potential to alter the balance between cell growth and death through these signaling pathways. Recently, ROS have been demonstrated to play a critical role in regulation of cardiomyocyte differentiation from embryonic stem cells. Research in the regulation mechanisms of ROS will contribute to our better understanding of the role of ROS and NADPH oxidase in cardicomyocyte differentiation and will lead to the identification of factors able to promote cardiac differentiation.",

        "abstract": "Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a member of the sirtuin family, which could activate cell survival machinery and has been shown to be protective in regulation of heart function. Here, we determined the mechanism by which SIRT1 regulates Angiotensin II- (AngII-) induced cardiac hypertrophy and injury in vivo and in vitro.We analyzed SIRT1 expression in the hearts of control and AngII-induced mouse hypertrophy. Female C57BL/6 mice were ovariectomized and pretreated with 17\u03b2-estradiol to measure SIRT1 expression. Protein synthesis, cardiomyocyte surface area analysis, qRT-PCR, TUNEL staining, and Western blot were performed on AngII-induced mouse heart hypertrophy samples and cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) to investigate the function of SIRT1.SIRT1 expression was slightly upregulated in AngII-induced mouse heart hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by elevated cardiomyocyte apoptosis. SIRT1 overexpression relieves AngII-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis. 17\u03b2-Estradiol was able to protect cardiomyocytes from AngII-induced injury with a profound upregulation of SIRT1 and activation of AMPK. Moreover, estrogen receptor inhibitor ICI 182,780 and SIRT1 inhibitor niacinamide could block SIRT1's protective effect.These results indicate that SIRT1 functions as an important regulator of estrogen-mediated cardiomyocyte protection during AngII-induced heart hypertrophy and injury.",

        "abstract": "Aim To investigate the association of lipoproteins subfractions with intimal medial thickness(IMT) of carotid artery in type 2 diabetic patients. Methods The subfractions of lipoproteins were determined by ultracentrifugation and high-performance liquid chromatiography,and the IMT of both sides carotid artery were measured by B-mode ultrasonography in 55 type 2 diabetic patients,divided into two groups by the IMT >1.2 mm(n=20) and \u22641.2 mm(n=35).The relationship between the lipoprotein subfractions and IMT was investigated. Result The older age was more common in patients with IMT>1.2 mm compared to those with IMT\u22641.2 mm(P<0.05).The serum level of lipoprotein(a) was higher in group IMT>1.2 mm(0.122\u00b10.077 mmol/L vs 0.081\u00b10.049 mmol/L,P<0.05).After adjusting the age,sex and BMI,the higher IMT was positively correlated with Lp(a) and LDLb;Lp(a) was positively correlated with LDL;TG was positively correlated with fasting blood glucose and LDLb,inverse correlated with HDL\u3001HDL2 and LDLa(P<0.05). With stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis,older age and Lp(a) were identified as significant and independent risk factors for higher IMT of carotid artery in type 2 diabetic patients(P<0.001 and P=0.021 respectively). Conclusion The results suggest that Lp(a) has a strong association with IMT of carotid arteries and might be the important predictor for early atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetic patients.",

        "abstract": "Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) extracted from the roots of panax notoginseng are free radical-scavenger, with an antioxidant property, capable of inhibiting expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines. This study was designed to test the effects of PNS administration in apolipoprotein (apo)-E-deficient mice on the activation of JNK, p38(MAPK), ERK1/2 and NF-\u03baB, and the expression of RAGE, adhesion molecules and chemokines in the atherosclerotic lesions.Wild type and apoE-null mice (male, 10-week-old) were treated with PNS for 4 weeks. Peripheral blood was collected for assessing the serum levels of glucose, lipids and MDA, and activities of SOD and GSH. The sizes of atherosclerotic lesions and numbers of macrophages in the branchiocephalic arteries, and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the aortic root were analyzed. The levels of CD68, Galectin-3, RAGE, JNK, phosphor-JNK, p38(MAPK), phosphor-p38(MAPK), ERK1/2, phosphor-ERK1/2, I-\u03baB, phosphor-I-\u03baB (Ser32), NF-\u03baB, phosphor-NF-\u03baB, MCP-1, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in the descending arteries were identified by Western blot.The atherosclerotic lesion sizes, and macrophage numbers, but not the smooth muscle cell amounts and the collagen content, were decreased in apoE(-/-) mice treated with PNS. After PNS administration for 4 weeks, the apoE(-/-) mice displayed reduced level of serum MDA and enhanced activity of SOD and GSH, accompanied by impaired ROS generation in the aortic root. Moreover, PNS down-regulated the expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and MCP-1, accompanied by reduced expression of RAGE and suppressed the activation of NF-\u03baB, JNK, p38(MAPK) and ERK1/2.PNS may inhibit progression of atherosclerotic lesions via their antioxidant/anti-inflammatory biological properties. PNS suppress the RAGE/MAPK signaling pathways, inactivate NF-\u03baB, and reduce expression of pro-inflammatory factors, such as VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and MCP-1 in atherosclerotic lesions of apoE(-/-) mice.",

Peripheral blood samples were collected from the caudal vein. Serum insulin level was assayed by radioimmunoassay. Total serum cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) were measured by enzyme-colorimetric method. By the end of experiment the rats were killed with their pancreases taken out. Immunohistochemistry was used to observe the morphological changes of the islet beta and alpha cells. Beta cell and alpha cell masses were calculated by the proportions of positive area in the islet. Proinsulin mRNA level was detected by RT-PCR. Insulin protein content in islets was detected by Western blotting.Four weeks after the insulin intervention against glucotoxicity, the fasting blood glucose and blood glucose 2 h after sugar-taking of the INS group were both significantly lower than those of the DM group (both P < 0.01).

        "abstract": "Doxorubicin, a potent chemotherapeutic agent, is associated with acute and chronic cardiotoxicity, which is cumulatively dose-dependent. Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), the extract of Astragalus membranaceus with strong antitumor and antiglomerulonephritis activity, can effectively alleviate inflammation. However, whether APS could ameliorate chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity is not understood. Here, we investigated the protective effects of APS on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and elucidated the underlying mechanisms of the protective effects of APS.We analyzed myocardial injury in cancer patients who underwent doxorubicin chemotherapy and generated a doxorubicin-induced neonatal rat cardiomyocyte injury model and a mouse heart failure model. Echocardiography, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, TUNEL, DNA laddering, and Western blotting were performed to observe cell survival, oxidative stress, and inflammatory signal pathways in cardiomyocytes.Treatment of patients with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin led to heart dysfunction. Doxorubicin reduced cardiomyocyte viability and induced C57BL/6J mouse heart failure with concurrent elevated ROS generation and apoptosis, which, however, was attenuated by APS treatment. In addition, there was profound inhibition of p38MAPK and activation of Akt after APS treatment.These results demonstrate that APS could suppress oxidative stress and apoptosis, ameliorating doxorubicin-mediated cardiotoxicity by regulating the PI3k/Akt and p38MAPK pathways.",

        "abstract": "Aim: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) can induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of vascular endothelial cells and has a principal role in the growth and injuries of endothelium. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect ofhigh concentration of LDL on ROS generation, mRNA level of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Methods: The experiment was carried out in the Key Laboratory of Geriatrics, Ministry of Health from December 2004 to February 2006. 1 Materials: Umbilical cords were collected from Maternity Department of Beijing Hospital with informed consents. LDL was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry Laboratory of Beijing Institute of Geriatrics, Beijing Hospital. 2 Procedure: The optimum concentration and time of LDL treatment were selected, and then isolated HUVECs were treated for 24 hours with different concentrations of LDL. The NOX4 expression was observed after selecting an optimal concentration. There were control group, 0.8 g/L LDL group, 1.6 g/L LDL group and 2.4 g/L LDL group. The NOX4 expression was observed after HUVECs fi-eated with 1.6 g/ L LDL for an optimal time. There were control group, 12-hour treatment group, 24-hour treatment group and 48-hour treatment group. ROS generation, NOX4 and apoptosis in HUVECs treated with optimized LDL concentration and proper hours were detected. 3 Assessments: The NOX4 expression was measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Intracellular ROS level and apoptotic rate were determined by Flow Cytometry (FCM). Hoechst 33342 staining was used to analyze the apoptosis in HUVECs. Results: 1 Compared with control group, ROS generation was increased in HU-VECs after treatment with 1.6 g/L LDL for 24 hours (P < 0.05). 2 The apoptosis in HUVECs treated with 1.6 g/L LDL for 24 hours was significantly higher than that in control group (P < 0.05). 3 The RT-PCR results indicated that the mRNA expression of NOX4 was increased in HUVECs treated with different concentrations of LDL for different hours. Conclusion: LDL could induce apoptosis through up-regulating NOX4 expression and intracelfular ROS production in HUVECs.",

        "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that miRNAs are involved in cellular apoptosis. However, the specific role of miR-291b-3p in apoptosis has not been elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the effect of miR-291b-3p on NCTC1469 cell growth and apoptosis.Cell viability and apoptosis were examined in NCTC1469 cells transfected with miR-291b-3p mimics, inhibitor miRNA or negative control. Using computational miRNA target prediction databases, HuR was predicted as a target of miR-291b-3p. Luciferase assay, immunofluorescence and western blot were used to further explore the effects of miR-291b-3p on HuR expression. In addition, the effect of HuR on cell apoptosis was evaluated using a HuR-specific siRNA.TNF-\u03b1-induced hepatocyte apoptosis was accompanied by enhanced expression of miR-291b-3p, suggesting that miR-291b-3p might contribute to the apoptotic process. Follow-up experiments showed that upregulation of miR-291b-3p decreased cell viability and induced NCTC1469 cell apoptosis. Additionally, similar to the activity of miR-519, which is another member of the same miRNA family, miR-291b-3p suppressed HuR translation through binding to the HuR coding region (CR). We further showed that the downregulation of HuR expression by miR-291b-3p was accompanied by reduced Bcl-2 expression. Moreover, knockdown of HuR also impaired Bcl-2 expression and increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. More significantly, downregulation of miR-291b-3p failed to increase Bcl2 expression in NCTC1469 cells that were co-transfected with siRNA-HuR. Finally, inhibition of miR-291b-3p led to reduced apoptosis, while knockdown of HuR by siRNA promoted apoptosis, even in NCTC1469 cells that were co-transfected with the miR-291b-3p inhibitor.The current data suggested that miR-291b-3p contributed to NCTC1469 cell apoptosis by regulating the expression of HuR, which in turn increased Bcl-2 stability.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have determined that branched-chain (BCAAs) and aromatic (AAAs) amino acids are strongly correlated with obesity and atherogenic dyslipidemia and are strong predictors of diabetes. However, it is not clear if these amino acids are capable of identifying subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD), particularly with subclinical atherosclerosis who are at risk of developing CAD.Four hundred and seventy two Chinese subjects (272 males and 200 females, 42-97 y of age) undergoing physical exams were recruited at random for participation in the cross-sectional study. Serum BCAAs and AAAs were measured using our previously reported isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Bilateral B-mode carotid artery images for carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) were acquired at end diastole and cIMT values more than 0.9 mm were categorized as increased. Correlations of BCAAs with cIMT and other CAD risk factors were analyzed.BCAAs and AAAs were significantly and positively associated with risk factors of CAD, e.g., cIMT, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, TG, apoB, apoB/apoAI ratio, apoCII, apoCIII and hsCRP, and were significantly and negatively associated with HDL-C and apoAI. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age (\u03b2\u200a=\u200a0.175, P<0.001), log BCAA (\u03b2\u200a=\u200a0.147, P<0.001) and systolic blood pressure (\u03b2\u200a=\u200a0.141, P\u200a=\u200a0.012) were positively and independently associated with cIMT. In the logistic regression model, the most and only powerful laboratory factor correlated with increased cIMT was BCAA (the odds ratio of the fourth quartile compared to the first quartile was 2.679; P\u200a=\u200a0.009).BCAAs are independently correlated with increased cIMT. This correlation would open a new field of research in the mechanistic understanding and risk assessment of CAD.",

        "abstract": "To develop a risk assessment model for persons at risk from type 2 diabetes in Chinese.The model was generated from the cross-sectional data of 16246 persons aged from 20 years old and over. C4.5 algorithm and multivariate logistic regression were used for variable selection. Relative risk value combined with expert decision constructed a comprehensive risk assessment for evaluating the individual risk category. The validity of the model was tested by cross validation and a survey performed six years later with some participants.Nine variables were selected as risk variables. A mathematical model was established to calculate the average probability of diabetes in each cluster's group divided by sex and age. A series of criteria combined with relative RR value (2.2) and level of risk variables stratified individuals into four risk groups (non, low, medium and high risk). The overall accuracy reached 90.99% evaluated by cross-validation inside the model population. The incidence of diabetes for each risk group increased from 1.5 (non-risk group) to 28.2(high-risk group) per one thousand persons per year with six years follow-up.The model could determine the individual risk for type 2 diabetes by four risk degrees. This model could be used as a technique tool not only to support screening persons at different risk, but also to evaluate the result of the intervention.",

        "abstract": "Background. Insulin treatment plays a key role in management of diabetes mellitus. Clinical researches showed that extra improvements in restoration of insulin secretion of pancreatic \u03b2 cells were found in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of early insulin treatment on insulin mRNA expression and morphological alterations of \u03b2 cells in a Sprague Dawley (SD) rat model of type 2 diabetes. Methods. A rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was induced by a high fat diet (high energy, HE) and low doses of streptozotoxin (STZ, 40 mg/kg). A group of diabetic rats was then injected with protamine zinc insulin (PZI, 1-2 U\u00b7kg-1\u00b7d-1) for one week. Insulin mRNA expression, morphological features of pancreatic islets, and metabolic parameters were examined in rats using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, and other techniques. Results. In insulin-treated diabetic rats, insulin mRNA levels prominently increased by 81.3% (P < 0.05), as compared with untreated diabetic rats. Moreover, timely insulin treatment noticeably improved the insulin content of \u03b2 cells, with an increase of 10.2% (P <0.05), despite a slight reduction in fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride (TG), and free fatty acid (FFA) levels, as compared to an untreated diabetic group. Conclusion. Insulin treatment at the onset of T2DM effectively improves insulin synthesis, as confirmed by morphological changes to \u03b2 cells in a rat model of type 2 diabetes.",

However, similar data especially the old people's data is relatively rare in China. Objective: To analyze the relationship between the components of metabolic syndrome (MetS), their clusters and the risk of diabetes among Chinese old population. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Beijin g Institute of Geriatrics, Beijing Hospital, Ministry of Public Health. Participants: The study was carried out from February 2001 until November 2001.4 499 volunteers aged 60 and over were recruited from the academic institutes in Beijing Xicheng, Haidian and Shijingshan districts through cluster sampling methods. They were selected after excluding those who did not have integral data. Methods: Diabetes was considered when fasting glucose was \u22657.0 mmol/L and was treated for or diagnosed as DM. Chi-square tests were performed to compare the categorical data. Age and sex adjustment were taken in the comparison of the levels of blood pressure, waist circumference (WC), The body mass index (BMI), and lab variables, Multifactor stepwise (backward) Logistic regression analyses were used to select the factors which would have association with the risk of DM. When analyzing the relationship between number of clustering of the traits of MetS and DM, the group without any metabolic abnormalities was set as control group. The dummy variables were set for 1,2,3,4 clusters of metabolic abnormalities. The Logistic regression model was used again to test the relationship and adjusted by age and the family history of DM. Main outcome measures: The blood glucose, waist, BMI, blood pressure, triglyceride (TG), HDL-C, and family history of diabetes of subjects. Results: 4 444 people in the mean age of 65\u00b15 were retrieved. 556 cases of DM were found in this survey. Age, family history of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, waist and TG were independently associated with the risk of DM, with OR (95%CI) being 1.02 (1.00-1.04), 3.48 (2.76-4.39), 1.02 (1.01-1.02), 1.03 (1.00-1.03), 1.13 (1.05-1.21), respectively. When TG was not in the model, HDL-C was also inversely associated with DM (OR=0.67, 95%CI 0.49-0.91). The risk of DM increased with clustering of abdominal obesity, raised blood pressure, raised TG, and reduced HDL-C level in individuals. Conclusion: In addition to age and genetic factors, metabolic factors, especially their clusters are closely related to the risk of diabetes. Therefore, the features of MetS are important indicators for the risk of DM in aged people.",

Down-regulation of NOX3 using siRNA prevented TNF-alpha-induced decrease of cellular glycogen. In the cells treated with TNF-alpha, there were NOX3-dependent activation of JNK, inhibition of IRS1 and phosphorylation of AKT/PKB and GSK. In conclusion, the effects of TNF-alpha on hepatic insulin resistance appear to be, at least in part, mediated by NOX3-derived ROS through a JNK pathway.",

        "abstract": "Dysfunction of b-cell is one of major characteristics in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The combination of obesity and type 2 diabetes, characterized as 'diabesity', is associated with elevated plasma free fatty acids (FFAs). Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of FFA-induced b-cell dysfunction. However, molecular mechanisms linking between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and FFA-induced b-cell dysfunction and apoptosis are less clear. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that NOX2-derived ROS may play a critical role in dysfunction and apoptosis of b-cells induced by FFA. Our results show that palmitate and oleate (0.5 mmol/L, 48 h) induced JNK activation and AKT inhibition which resulted in decreased phosphorylation of FOXO1 following nuclear localization and the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of PDX-1, leading to the reducing of insulin and ultimately dysfunction of pancreatic NIT-1 cells. We also found that palmitate and oleate stimulated apoptosis of NIT-1 cells through p38MAPK, p53 and NF-kB pathway. More interestingly, our data suggest that suppression of NOX2 may restore FFA-induced dysfunction and apoptosis of NIT-1 cells. Our findings provide a new insight of the NOX2 as a potential new therapeutic target for preservation of b-cell mass and function. \u00a9 2010 Yuan et al.",

Whereas the NMDA channel blocker MK801 consistently induced HSP70 in posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices, eliprodil had no such effects even at the highest dose (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), supporting the idea that injury to the cerebrocortical neurones by NMDA receptor antagonists is probably related to specific sites of the receptor. Furthermore, eliprodil, given immediately after injection of MK801, blocked the effects of MK801 on HSP70. The result is discussed in terms of high affinity of eliprodil for the sigma receptor.",

        "abstract": "The localisation of S-100 in mammalian CNS neurons has been under debate for more than two decades. We address the question with two polyclonal and two new monoclonal antibodies. The specificity and the distribution in rat brain is based on an antigen retrieval method. We present evidence that aldehyde fixatives mask S-100\u03b2 in neurons, and that the immunoreactivity is retrieved after trypsinisation. Neuronal S-100\u03b2 is also detected in unfixed and ethanol fixed sections. The neuronal immunoreactivity is partly solubilised from unfixed tissue sections with 2.5 mM EDTA and is completely extracted with 2.5 mM EDTA and 1% Triton X-100. Most of the glial S-100\u03b2 is washed out from unfixed tissue sections with saline. S-100\u03b2 has distinct distribution in neurons of the hindbrain, i.e., the brainstem and cerebellum, but is not observed in the forebrain. One of the monoclonal antibodies immunostained neither neurons nor glia when it had been absorbed with S-100 crosslinked to nitrocellulose membranes. The distribution of neuronal S-100\u03b2 differed from that of other neuronal calcium binding proteins, such as calbindin and parvalbumin. It was confined mainly to cholinergic neurons of the hindbrain. The presence of S-100\u03b2 in distinct neuronal populations may indicate neurotrophic effects of S-100\u03b2. The notion is supported by the capability of S-100 to cause neurite outgrowth in vitro.",

        "abstract": "The regional distribution of neurofilament proteins in the rat hippocampus and their early changes after kainic acid induced seizures were investigated immunocytochemically with antibodies against light weight neurofilament, phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated heavy weight neurofilament. The light weight and non-phosphorylated heavy weight neurofilaments were distributed more unevenly than the phosphorylated neurofilament. The perikarya and processes of pyramidal cells in the CA3 field contained the highest light weight and non-phosphorylated heavy weight neurofilaments, while the perikarya of granule cells contained only few light weight neurofilament and the perikarya of CA1 pyramidal cells were even devoid of immunoreactivity of both light and heavy weight neurofilaments. The fiber staining of the light weight and non-phosphorylated heavy weight neurofilaments, especially the former, was less in the CA1 field and molecular layer of dentate gyrus. The phosphorylated neurofilament immunoreactivity was identified only in axons. Mossy fibers, the axons of granule cells, contained the light weight and phosphorylated heavy weight neurofilaments, but not the non-phosphorylated neurofilament. Seven days after the kainic acid induced seizures, the phosphorylated neurofilament staining was greatly reduced in the CA1 and inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, probably resulting from the axonal degeneration of the Schaffer collaterals and the commissural/associational fibers. Furthermore, the nonphosphorylated neurofilament appeared in the mossy fibers of the CA3 stratum lucidum, which normally do not express such immunoreactivity. The results indicate that the neurofilaments are altered following the neuronal degeneration and postlesional plasticity caused by the kainic acid administration. Therefore, the examination of various phosphorylated neurofilaments may offer a comprehensive understanding of major hippocampal pathways, axonal plasticity and the possible roles of neurofilaments in the hippocampus following excitotoxic insults.",

Exposure to 600 p.p.m. for 4 to 12 weeks resulted in a slower increase in brain weight. Brain region weights, total proteins and DNA were decreased in frontal cerebral cortex and brain stem but not in hippocampus after exposure to 600 p.p.m. for 12 weeks. Four marker proteins were measured to monitor the specific neurotoxic effects of perchloroethylene: S-100 protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein as glial cell markers and neurone specific enolase and neurofilament 68 kD polypeptide as neuronal markers. The concentrations of glial and neuronal cytoskeletal proteins (glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament 68 kD polypeptide) were reduced in frontal cerebral cortex. The total tissue contents of glial proteins (S-100 protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein) were decreased in all 3 brain regions investigated (frontal cerebral cortex, hippocampus and brain stem). Neurone specific enolase was unchanged by perchloroethylene exposure. These results indicate that exposure to perchloroethylene reduces the number of brain cells, possibly glial cells, and interferes with the metabolism of cytoskeletal elements in both glial and neuronal cells.",

This enhanced sensitivity in NT2/D1 neurons was correlated with an 8-fold lower level of intracellular glutathione. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, an agent that is able to raise the levels of intracellular glutathione, promoted the survival of hydrogen peroxide-treated NT2/D1 neurons. Thus, the low glutathione level may contribute to the high sensitivity of NT2/D1 neurones to hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis. This study indicates that neuronal susceptibility to oxidative damage is developmentally regulated.",

        "abstract": "The study provides detailed biochemical correlates to the common histopathological diagnoses in epilepsy. A dot immunobinding procedure was used for quantification of NSE, GFA, S-100, NCAM, NF 68 and NF 200. The material consisted of samples from 48 patients either selected for surgical treatment of partial epilepsy or for disorders not related to epilepsy. The histopathological diagnosis of the epileptic cases was: MCD (mild cortical dysplasia, microdysgenesis), gliosis, astrocytoma, ganglioglioma, oligodendroglioma and single cases. The concentration in non-epileptic white matter, in per cent of that in grey matter was: NSE, 85; GFA, 175; S-100, 117; NCAM, 43; NF 68,227 and NF 200, 173. The concentration of NSE as well as of GFA was close to normal in the specimens of the MCD and gliosis groups and of one subgroup of the astrocytomas. There was a striking inverse relationship of the GFA vs the NSE concentrations in the whole material. The concentrations of S-100 showed no such inverse relationship to NSE levels. In all the epileptic groups, total NCAM was lower than 50% of that of the non-epileptic group. The mean NF 68 and NF 200 concentration in the gliosis and astrocytoma groups was 75% of that of the non-epileptic group while the corresponding value for the MCD group was 50%. There was a positive correlation of immunochemically determined GFA and the histopathological gliosis score in the samples of epileptogenic cortex. There was no correlation between the concentration of GFA in the samples and the duration of epilepsy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Abnormal reestablishment of mossy fibers with the CA3 pyramidal cells and granule cells is an important aspect of postlesional plasticity in epilepsy. However, basis for the structural reorganisation and functional consequences of the event remain uncertain. Therefore we have investigated alterations of neurofilaments, major cytoskeletal components of neurons, in the rat hippocampus after the kainic acid (KA) administration, an experimental model for the temporal lobe epilepsy. The immunoreactivity for phosphorylated heavy weight neurofilament (pNFH) and non-phosphorylated heavy weight neurofilament (npNFH), in particular the pNFH, decreased in the CA1 field and inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus during 3 and 10 days after the KA administration. After 10 days, npNFH immunoreactivity appeared in the mossy fibers, in which it is normally absent, meanwhile the pNFH staining in the mossy fibers did not decrease. From day 21, the immunoreactivity of pNFH and npNFH was normal or above normal in the CA1 stratum lacunosum-moleculare, mossy fibers, hilus and inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. These alterations in the later phase remained at least to day 90. The reappearance and increase of the neurofilament immunoreactivity in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus probably reflects a collateral extension of the granule cell axons known as mossy fiber sprouting. The results suggest that neurofilament changes in the granule cell-mossy fiber system may be a morphological basis for the structural reconstruction of granule cell axons, and neurofilaments are involved in the plasticity after the KA induced seizures.",

        "abstract": "An intrahippocampal injection of N-methyl-D-aspartate induced the appearance of degradation products of both the 68 kiloDalton neurofilament protein and the glial fibrillary acidic protein, as revealed by immunoblot techniques. The degradation of these two filament proteins was maximal at 10 days after the lession. The degradation patterns were similar to those induced with calpains or calcium in vitro. There were no degradation effects on the 200 kD neurofilament protein as tested with both mono- and polyclonal antibodies. Consequently, the neuronal degeneration after excessive activation of NMDA receptors appears to involve calcium activation of proteolytic enzymes. The effects on the glial proteins are probably secondary to neuronal damage but could be related to calcium dependent processes.",

        "abstract": "In addition to being an astroglial protein, S-100\u03b2 is localised in distinct populations of neurons in the adult rat hindbrain. We report, here, the expression of S-100\u03b2 in both neurons and glia of the rat brain during development. Prenatally, S-100\u03b2 immunoreactivity was confined to glial cells close to the germinal zone. After birth, S-100\u03b2 positive glial cells were seen mainly in the brainstem and cerebellum, while only a few were detected in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The number of S-100\u03b2 containing glial cells increased steadily during the first 2 postnatal weeks after which the adult pattern was attained. No S-100\u03b2 containing neurons were present prenatally. The first S-100\u03b2 containing neurons were seen in the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus at postnatal day 1 (P1), and in the motor trigeminal nucleus at P3. Neuronal S-100\u03b2 immunoreactivity in other nuclei was mostly attained from the 10th to the 21st postnatal day. The neuronal S-100\u03b2 immunoreactivity was first detected in the cell nuclei during development, then increased in the cytoplasm with ages. A nuclear staining in many immunoreactive neurons persisted until the adult. It usually took 1 to 2 weeks for neuronal S-100\u03b2 to attain the adult staining pattern, i.e., heavy staining of the cytoplasm and processes, after its appearance. The forebrain never contained S-100\u03b2 positive neurons. The S-100\u03b2 is first expressed in glial cells, suggesting it is primarily of the glial origin. Coupled with neurotrophic effects of the protein, the time course of neuronal S-100\u03b2 expression during the critical period of neuronal development implies that it may be involved in neuronal differentiation and maturation.",

        "abstract": "Neuronal and glial cell marker proteins were quantified in order to evaluate the possibility of increased proteolysis in the brain of rabbits with acute liver failure and acute hyperammonemia. Acute liver failure was induced by a two-stage devascularization procedure. Acute hyperammonemia was induced by a prolonged infusion of ammonium acetate, which simulates the plasma ammonia level in acute liver failure. Control animals received an infusion of sodium/potassium acetate. After development of severe encephalopathy, the animals were sacrificed (13.7 +/- 1.3 hours for rabbits with acute liver failure and 20.2 +/- 0.8 hours for rabbits with hyperammonemia) (x +/- S.E.M./n = 6) and their brains were dissected into cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and brain stem. The total protein content and the concentrations of the neuronal cell marker proteins NSE (neuron specific enolase), NF68 and NF200 (68 kD and 200 kD neurofilament polypeptides) and the glial cell marker proteins GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and S-100 were determined. Total protein content was decreased in the brain stem in acute hyperammonemia only. The content of neuronal and glial cell markers was not affected in either of the two conditions. However, low molecular weight proteolytic fragments of the NF 68 kD polypeptide were observed in the hippocampus of three out of six animals in both experimental groups. No proteolytic degradation of GFAP was observed. The results show that, in experimental encephalopathy due to acute liver failure and acute hyperammonemia, no major changes occur in the marker proteins. The finding of proteolytic fragments of the NF68 polypeptide indicates that the neuronal population is affected prior to glial alterations. These findings are in agreement with the concept that acute hepatic encephalopathy is reversible and induces only slight structural changes.",

Peroxides were generated on the substrate surface by UV preirradiation and they initiated graft polymerization of acrylic acid (AA) onto the surface upon a second UV irradiation. Micropatterns and gradients of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) were formed when the substrate was placed under or moved with respect to a photomask during UV preirradiation. Protein micropatterns and gradients were fabricated on the surface by covalently linking to the carboxyl groups on PAA chains. To test cell response to the protein gradient surfaces, PC12 pheochromocytoma cells were cultured on laminin-bound substrates in serum-free medium supplemented with nerve growth factor (NGF). It is found that both the attachment and neurite outgrowth behaviors of PC12 cells were dependent on the surface laminin density. However, the unreacted carboxyl groups on the polymer surface negatively affected PC12 cells. This weakened the positive influence from laminin.",

        "abstract": "Here, we seek to control cellular development by devising a means through which cells can be subjected to a microheated environment in standard culture conditions. Numerous techniques have been devised for controlling cellular function and development via manipulation of surface environmental cues at the micro- and nanoscale. It is well understood that temperature plays a significant role in the rate of cellular activities, migratory behavior (thermotaxis), and in some cases, protein expression. Yet, the effects and possible utilization of micrometer-scale temperature fields in cell cultures have not been explored. Toward this end, two types of thermally isolated microheated substrates were designed and fabricated, one with standard backside etching beneath a dielectric film and another with a combination of surface and bulk micromachining and backside etching. The substrates were characterized with infrared microscopy, finite element modeling, scanning electron microscopy, stylus profilometry, and electrothermal calibrations. Neuron culture studies were conducted on these substrates to 1) examine the feasibility of using a microheated environment to achieve patterned cell growth and 2) selectively accelerate neural development on regions less than 100 \u03bcm wide. Results show that attached neurons, grown on microheated regions set at 37\u00b0C, extended processes substantially faster than those incubated at 25\u00b0C on the same substrate. Further, unattached neurons were positioned precisely along the length of the heater filament (operating at 45\u00b0C) using free convection currents. These preliminary findings indicate that microheated substrates may be used to direct cellular development spatially in a practical manner.",

        "abstract": "Transient genetic manipulation of human neurons without chromosomal integration of the transgene would be valuable but has been challenging due to the quiescent nature of these postmitotic cells. In this study, we developed a set of baculoviral vectors for transient transduction in nondividing neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Using a baculoviral vector equipped with the woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE), we observed a quick onset of transgene expression as early as day 1 after baculoviral transduction and a high efficiency of up to 80%. Strong transgene expression in the cultured human neurons was observed for more than 1 month and the signal was easily detectable even after 3 months. Using two baculoviral vectors carrying different transgenes, we found that co-transduction at a single neuron level was possible. After transplantation into the brain of nude mice, the baculovirus-transduced human neurons were integrated into the mouse brain and maintained transgene expression for at least 4 weeks, portending the usefulness of this technique in assisting neural transplantation. Therefore, by mediating efficient transient gene expression, baculoviral vectors can provide useful tools for both basic gene function studies in human neurons and therapeutic applications of these cells.",

        "abstract": "V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells are a minor subset of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood that has been extensively investigated for their tolerability, safety and anticancer efficacy. A hindrance to the broad application of these cells for adoptive cellular immunotherapy has been attaining clinically appropriate numbers of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells. Furthermore, V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells exist at low frequencies among cancer patients. We, therefore, sought to conceive an economical method that allows for a quick and robust large-scale expansion of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells. A two-step protocol was developed, in which peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors or cancer patients were activated with Zometa and interleukin (IL)-2, followed by co-culturing with gamma-irradiated, CD64-, CD86- and CD137L-expressing K562 artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) in the presence of the anti-CD3 antibody OKT3. We optimized the co-culture ratio of K562 aAPCs to immune cells, and migrated this method to a G-Rex cell growth platform to derive clinically relevant cell numbers in a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant manner. We further include a depletion step to selectively remove \u03b1\u03b2 T lymphocytes. The method exhibited high expansion folds and a specific enrichment of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells. Expanded V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells displayed an effector memory phenotype with a concomitant down-regulated expression of inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors. Finally, we ascertained the cytotoxic activity of these expanded cells by using nonmodified and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engrafted V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells against a panel of solid tumor cells. Overall, we report an efficient approach to generate highly functional V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells in massive numbers suitable for clinical application in an allogeneic setting.",

        "abstract": "In recent year, the write-heavy applications is more and more prevalent. How to efficiently handle this sort of workload is one of intensive research direction in the field of database system. The overhead caused by write operation is mainly issued by two reasons: 1) the hardware level, i.e., the IO cost caused by logging. We canu0027t remove this cost in short period 2) the dual-copy software architecture and serial replay. The born of log as database architecture is originated to overcome the software defect. But existing systems treating log as database either are built on top of special infrastructure such as infiniband or NVRam (Non-Volatile Random access memory) which is far from widely available or are constructed with the help of other system such as Dynamo which is lack of flexibility. In this paper we build only write-once key-value system called LogStore from scratch to support our instant messenger business. The key features of LogStore include: 1) a single thread per partition executing mode, which eliminates the concurrency overhead; 2) log as database to enable write-once feature and freshness on the standby. We achieve high availability by embedding replication protocol other than dependent on other infrastructure; 3) fine-grained and low overhead data buffer pool management to effectively minimize IO cost. According to our empirical evaluations LogStore has good performance in write operation, recovery and replication",

        "abstract": "Transient genetic manipulation of human neurons without chromosomal integration of the transgene would be valuable but has been challenging due to the quiescent nature of these postmitotic cells. In this study, we developed a set of baculoviral vectors for transient transduction in nondividing neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Using a baculoviral vector equipped with the woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE), we observed a quick onset of transgene expression as early as day 1 after baculoviral transduction and a high efficiency of up to 80%. Strong transgene expression in the cultured human neurons was observed for more than 1 month and the signal was easily detectable even after 3 months. Using two baculoviral vectors carrying different transgenes, we found that co-transduction at a single neuron level was possible. After transplantation into the brain of nude mice, the baculovirus-transduced human neurons were integrated into the mouse brain and maintained transgene expression for at least 4 weeks, portending the usefulness of this technique in assisting neural transplantation. Therefore, by mediating efficient transient gene expression, baculoviral vectors can provide useful tools for both basic gene function studies in human neurons and therapeutic applications of these cells.",

        "abstract": "Viral vectors hold promise and challenges in gene therapy. Specifically, we have previously shown that baculoviral (BV) vectors have a high efficiency of gene delivery in human embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here we report the development of a complementary system to further our evaluation by utilizing the laboratory fish medaka that has ES cell lines and tools for experimental analyses in vitro and in vivo. We show that BV vectors can give rise to almost 100% of transient gene delivery in the medaka ES cell line MES1. BV-transduced MES1 cells reproducibly (at approximately 10(-5)) produce GFP-expressing colonies that, upon manual isolation, develop into stable clones during 300 days of culture. Surprisingly, BV transduction can also mediate efficient gene integration in the medaka genome, as fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed the presence of the BV-delivered gfp transgene in multiple locations in nuclei and on various chromosomes of metaphase spreads. We show that BV transduction does not compromise the genome stability and pluripotency of MES1 cells. We conclude that BV can efficiently mediate gene delivery and chromosomal integration in medaka ES cells. Therefore, medaka provides a powerful system for analyzing the potential of BV-mediated gene delivery in stem cells and gene therapy.",

Given that transcription machineries directed by certain Pol II and III promoters may use common factors, we investigated whether the enhancer of the Pol II cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter could improve the efficacy of RNA interference mediated by the Pol III H1 promoter. We constructed a hybrid promoter by appending the CMV enhancer 5' to the H1 promoter. In the context of plasmid vectors, the hybrid promoter provided up to 50% greater inhibition of the expression of target genes than the unmodified H1 promoter and extended the silencing effect beyond that provided by the H1 promoter. Insect baculoviruses can infect a broad range of mammalian cell types. We constructed a baculovector expression cassette in which the synthesis of short hairpin RNA was under the control of the hybrid CMV enhancer-H1 promoter. This recombinant baculovirus vector was capable of suppressing expression of a target gene by 95% in cultured cells and by 82% in vivo in rat brain. These findings indicate that the hybrid CMV enhancer-H1 promoter can be used favorably for RNA interference.",

A previous study used \u03b1\u03b2 T cell-derived CAR-modified iPSCs to produce CAR-T cells. However, these \u03b1\u03b2 T cells are restricted to autologous use and only recognize single cancer antigen. To make CAR-T alternative for allogeneic use, we reprogrammed \u03b3\u03b4 T cell into iPSCs (\u03b3\u03b4 T-iPSCs) to circumvent the risk of graft-versus-host disease. To target multiple cancer-associated antigens, we used an \"NK cell-promoting\" protocol to differentiate \u03b3\u03b4 T-iPSCs and to induce expression of natural killer receptors (NKRs). Through such two-step strategy, mimetic \u03b3\u03b4 T cells endowed with an array of NKRs and thus designated as \"\u03b3\u03b4 natural killer T (\u03b3\u03b4 NKT) cells\" were derived. With no/low-level expression of inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and immune checkpoint receptors, \u03b3\u03b4 NKT cells may provide a potent \"off-the-shelf\" cytotoxic cell source to recognize multiple ubiquitous antigens in a broad spectrum of cancers.",

        "abstract": "Gene delivery vectors that restrict the expression of a therapeutic gene to a particular type of cells are critical to gene therapy in a complex structure, such as the central nervous system. We constructed a nonviral vector for targeted gene transfer to cells expressing nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor TrkA.The vector was a synthetic chimeric peptide composed of a targeting moiety derived from NGF loop 4 and a DNA-binding moiety of 10 lysine residues. The peptide activated signal transduction pathways of the NGF receptor TrkA in PC12 cells and supported the survival of the cells after serum deprivation. After forming complexes with plasmid DNA, the peptide dose-dependently increased reporter gene expression in PC12 cells, which could be inhibited by excess NGF. The peptide-mediated gene expression was not affected in PC12 cells by co-incubation with a blocking antibody against the low-affinity NGF receptor p75 and was significantly enhanced in NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with TrkA cDNA, suggesting the involvement of the high-affinity NGF receptor TrkA without the participation of p75. Moreover, the peptide did not assist gene transfer in TrkA-poor, but TrkB- and/or TrkC-positive primary cerebellar granule neurons and primary cortical glial cells.The chimeric peptide reported will be useful in gene delivery to and gene therapy of the nervous system and other tissues/organs with cells expressing TrkA.",

To realize these potentials, the development of effective and safe genetic manipulation methods in hES cells is an obvious demand. We report here that baculoviral vectors were able to transduce hES cells efficiently. In transient transduction experiments, a recombinant baculoviral vector equipped with a human elongation factor 1-alpha promoter and a woodchuck hepatitis post-transcriptional regulatory element transduced up to 80% of cells in hES cell clumps and embryoid bodies. For prolonged transgene expression, hybrid baculoviral vectors that have incorporated a rep gene and inverted terminal repeat sequences from adeno-associated virus were produced. These hybrid vectors yielded stable transgene expression during the prolonged undifferentiated proliferation of hES cells and after differentiation. Baculoviral transduction did not affect the normal growth, phenotype, and pluripotency of hES cells. Thus, baculoviral vectors suitable for both transient overexpression and long-term stable expression are an attractive option for genetic manipulation of hES cells.",

These substrates were then used to investigate the influence of carboxyl groups (-COOH) on cell behavior. Both the attachment and differentiation behaviors of C17.2 cells showed a -COOH group density-dependent response. In order to achieve an even distribution of cells on a -COOH gradient surface for neuron differentiation studies, an Ar plasma post-treatment was applied to the PAA-grafted surfaces. It greatly improved the cell adhesion properties with little damage to -COOH groups. This allows uniform distributions of seeded cells even on substrates with -COOH gradients. A linear or stepped -COOH gradient was found to be capable of serving as a repelling cue to guide the outgrowth of neurites from C17.2 cells. Up to 3.7 times more cells developed neurites growing down the -COOH gradient than growing up it.",

To develop a chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cell therapy approach to treat patients with end-stage PC, we constructed third generation CARs specific to EpCAM using the 4D5MOC-B single chain variable fragment. CART cells were generated with lentiviral transduction and exhibited specific in vitro killing activity against EpCAM-positive human ovarian and colorectal cancer cells. A single intraperitoneal injection of the CART cells eradicated established ovarian xenografts and resulted in significantly prolonged animal survival. Since EpCAM is also expressed on normal epithelium, anti-EpCAM CART cells were generated by mRNA electroporation that display a controlled cytolytic activity with a limited CAR expression duration. Multiple repeated infusions of these RNA CAR-modified T cells delayed disease progression in immunodeficient mice bearing well-established peritoneal ovarian and colorectal xenografts. Thus, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of using anti-EpCAM CAR-expressing T cells for local treatment of PC in mice.

        "abstract": "Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is widely shown in end-stage neoplastic disease, especially in recurrent colorectal cancer, and has become a significant threat to the overall survival of patients. Since NKG2D ligands are commonly up-regulated on cell surface of carcinomas but rarely present on most healthy tissues, they can be the ideal targets in the treatment of NKG2D ligand-overexpressing colorectal PC. In this study, we developed a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy approach by arming human T lymphocytes with mRNA coding a chimeric NKG2D receptor to target NKG2D ligands. We constructed first, second, and third generation CARs specific for NKG2D ligands by linking the extracellular domain of the human NKG2D receptor to the CD3-zeta signaling domain and costimulatory moieties. mRNAs of those chimeric NKG2D CARs were electroporated into human T lymphocytes and the anti-tumor activities of engineered T cells were examined afterwards. The NKG2D CAR expression was detectable for at least 6 days and the modified T cells exhibited efficient cytotoxic immune activity against NKG2D ligand-positive tumor cells, but not NKG2D ligand-negative cells. Multiple infusions of the RNA CAR modified T cells in immunodeficient mice bearing established peritoneal human colorectal tumors led to a significant reduction in the tumor burden. Here, we showed that T cells engineered with NKG2D CAR by RNA electroporation can efficiently control the colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis in the mouse model. Transfection of mRNA encoding a CAR is an economical way to benefit the test of new CARs and it holds great promise in controlling on-target/off-tumor toxicity and cytokine storms.

        "abstract": "Tillering is one of the most important agronomic traits of rice. In order to explore the molecular mechanism of rice tillering, a high-tillering dwarf 1-2 (htd1-2) mutant was isolated from the offspring of the indica rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica) variety 9311 treated with 350Gy 60Co gamma-radiation. Genetic analysis showed that both high tillering and dwarf phenotypes of htd1-2 were controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene. By means of molecular marker technique, the HIGH-TILLERING DWARF1-2(HTD1-2) gene was mapped between two CAPS markers A6 and E2 on chromosome 4 within 116 kilobases. Within this region, there is a cloned gene HIGH-TILLERING DWARF1(HTD1), which controls rice tillering. By comparing sequences of HTD1 between htd1-2 and 9311, in combination with the results from dCAPS analysis, we believed that HTD1 is an orthologue of the gene HTD1-2. Because of different genetic backgrounds, htd1 and htd1-2 have different phenotypes although they are the allelic mutants. Furthermore, removal of axillary buds proved that dwarfism of htd1-2 mutant is partly attributed to its excessive tillers.",

The design and construction of the cable-strut joint is key technique to assure the smooth sliding of circumferential cable and the efficient transfer of prestress in circumferential cable. This paper analyses geometrical construction of cable-strut joint, presents method for calculating the prestress loss of the loop cable. The nonlinear contact friction finite element analysis of the loop cable and cable-strut joint is carried on with ANSYS, the prestress loss is calculated through the actual construction monitoring data. The computed results are comparied with the actual monitoring data, and the causes for larger monitoring pretress loss are studied. Following suggestions are provided for cable-strut joint of suspend-dome that loop cables are tensioned to prestress in the construction; the cable-strut joint cast steel should be made precisely to satify the design criterion; the constructional detail of the cable-strut joint should be improved to diminish the prestress loss; the prestress loss value of cable-strut joint is preferable at 5%-6%, meanwhile the cable-strut joint should be made precisely and the construction should be controlled strictly.",

After modifying, the members' strength increased significantly and their ductile nature reduced greatly. Large deformation collapse buckling limiting state of the prestressed long-span steel structure system is the controlling factor of the structure security. So it is very important to analyze the ductile nature of the cable and tension bar for the design of the prestressed long-span steel structure system. This paper takes the suspend-dome of the badminton gymnasium for 2008 Olympic Games for example, attempting to analyze and study the stress and the distort ability of the cable and the tension bar under severe earthquake and overall buckling. The study indicates the mechanical behavior of suspend-dome structure, i.e. large deform in system, small strain in cable and bar. It proves that the cable and bar with low ductility capability is safe to be applied on suspend-dome structure system.",

The safety control of this structure system is different from conventional ones. It requires control of the design state namely the ultimate service-state. Simultaneously the structure mechanical property of the prestress tensioning process should be studied, and the safety in the geometric forming process of structure should be controlled. In this paper, the suspend-dome of the badminton gymnasium for 2008 Olympic Games is taken as the research subject by simulating the whole process of prestressing construction with two different calculation methods, analyzing the changing characteristic of shape, internal force and node displacement, and affirming the safety during the construction process. The study indicates that the structural mechanics response by stepped entirely loading method is more than that of element birth-death method. It proves the practicality of stepped entirely loading method usually used in simulating analysis of engineering construction process and the safety of stepped entirely loading method in suspend-dome design. This paper may serve as a good reference for future practice.",

The elasto-plastic performance in the condition of static stability limit state becomes the key factors of the security of the structure. First, the performance of the main structure in the condition of static loading was analyzed adopting the performance target put forward in this paper. The choice of the multi-floor structure with the huge grid as the best scheme was made among many schemes. Then the seismic performance studies were conducted by response spectrum analysis, elastic dynamic time-history analysis and elasto-plastic dynamic time-history analysis respectively. The key part of the analysis is the irregularity of the structure, the security at the end of cantilever and the elasto-plastic performance in the condition of major earthquake. Analysis shows that the structural scheme selected based on the performance target put forward in this paper is economic and reasonable, and the static and seismic performance objectives for design are realized.",

The following aspects are considered including the prestressed cable system setting and achieving of the formed shape of structure by prestress tension, the formed shape of structure satisfying normal use and safety requirements, determining the reasonable form by optimization of prestressing degree. Prestress tension form-finding and simulation of whole loading process were analyzed through restart analysis for cable dome structure. Firstly, as prestress tension methods has no influence on the final formed shape of structure by analyzing prestress tension simulation for cable dome structure, a flexible technical space will be created for construction unit formulating plans of prestress tension. Secondly, the whole process simulation under different prestressing degrees was performed to obtain performance control indexes at each stage. The prestress rationality and safety of structure were determined based on the conclusions for the project. At last, the initial prestressing degree P 0 that can keep the initial geometric form was determined. The research shows that the initial prestress P 0 of 7.5~10.0 times as the design prestress is the safe and reasonable choice by analyzing the elasto-plastic ductile performance of different span cable dome structures under different prestressing degrees. The research methods and conclusions was used in design of large-span cable dome structure, which is roof structure of the National Fitness Center in Ejin Horo Banner, Inner Mongolia, first built in mainland of our country.",

        "abstract": "A novel nano TiO2 film(N-TiO2-CTMS) with reversible wettability controlled by visible light was prepared on the surface of glass slide,using tetrabutyl titanate as precursor,via nitrogen-doped and chlorotrimethylsilane modificated.UV-Vis,FE-SEM and contact angle measurements etc were used to characterize the samples.The results demonstrated that the sample with 20%(molar ratio) N-doped concentration(20%N-TiO2) held the highest photocatalytic activity on the degradation of methyl orange under visible light.The target N-TiO2-CTMS film was obtained by hydrophobic modified of the 20%N-TiO2 sample,with a surface contact angle of 95\u00b0,and it becomes comparatively hydrophilic(45\u00b0) after being irradiated under visible light for 5h,and gradually returns to a relatively hydrophobic state(90\u00b0) when left in the dark.Such switch could be reversibly cycled on the same surface,indicated that the novel N-TiO2-CTMS film was hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic convertible driven by visible light.Here,the preliminary mechanism for the above results were also investigated.",

The results indicated that the distribution of Na + and K+ in poplar vegetative organs was different.The change of content of Na+ and K+ in roots, stems and leaves of \u2018107\u2019 was obvious with different tree age and different ground diameter ,the content of Na+ and K+ in roots of \u201818-1\u2019 containing NTHK1 was fundamentally equal with different tree age and ground diameter. The content of K + in stems raised with increase of tree age,the content of K + in leaves lowered with increase of tree age,the content of Na+ in stems and leaves was lesser .The features that poplar \u201818-1\u2019 was more applicable the saline than \u2018107\u2019,which can better resist to salt stress and maintain ion homeostasis. The effect of NTHK1 may be limitted a large number of Na+ in the vacuole and reduced ion toxicity of high consistency Na+ to cell, so the salt tolerance ability of 18-1 containing NTHK1 was enhanced.",

Based on the changes in principle component number, loading matrixes, and principle component matrixes, which reveal evolvement of the underlying process behavior, a three-step substage separation method is realized. First, rough separation of operation substage is executed by the difference of principle component number. To reflect objectively the similarity of the loading matrixes and the similarity of the principle component matrixes, two improved similarity distances, based on weighted cosine of the angle between loading vectors and weighted Euclidean distances, are introduced respectively. According to the criterion of minimum similarity distances, time-slice matrixes are sorted using the rival penalized competitive learning algorithm to realize separation of operation substage more particularly for batch processes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by applying it to the MPCA modeling and on-line monitoring of the injection mold process. Copyright \u00a9 2010 Acta Automatica Sinica.

However, it is difficult to find an inverse mapping function from the feature space to the original space for KPCA, resulting in great difficulties for the KPCA-based fault diagnosis. To solve this problem, the fault identification index was improved on the basis of KPCA fault data reconstruction method. The improved method could identify both univariate faults and multivariate faults. In addition, the proposed method could also reduce calculation and avoid the defect that the traditional fault detection methods could only identify univariate faults.

To diagnose the faults in hydraulic test process timely, a stage-based recursive multiway fisher discriminant analysis method is introduced in this paper. The method is based on the idea that the process can be divided into some stages, different faults can be characterized in different stages; and different MFDA models can be built using every stage data. A recursive idea is adopted to combine the diagnosis results of the three stages. The method was applied to the fault data of four shuttle valves in practical production process. Test results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The injection speed system was characterized by the M. Rafizadeh model, and its reversibility was confirmed through calculating the relative degree of the system. Considering the difficulty in obtaining the analytical form of reversible model for injection speed system, the RBF neural network (RBFNN) was used to build an inverse system of injection speed. The RBFNN-based inverse system, which has unsatisfied control effect due to open-loop control, was combined with the conventional PID control, thus realizing the composite control of injection speed. The simulation results show that the control system proposed has good tracking and anti-disturbance performance.",

Different modes are needed for different steady modes because different relations of variables are contained in each mode model. Transition mode is a dynamic process occurring when production changes operating mode. The dynamic characteristic reflects not only the changing variables but also the changing relation of variables. The relative change information can be obtained by differential transform of transition data. Principle components can be extracted by analyzing correlation of differential variables using principal component analysis (PCA).

The method realizes a 3-step sub-phase separation of the batch process using the retained principal components number, loading matrixes and principal component matrixes, which can adequately reflect the features variation of the process. In line with the different features and classification step, automatic identification of 'burrs' and transition phases has been expounded. The proposed method can directly separate the stable phases and transition phases in the batch process, and deduce high-precision transition phase models. Based on the proposed method, the MPCA modeling and online monitoring is applied in the injection molding process.

Better operation performance helps the factory obtain more benefit. Traditional monitoring approaches determine if the process is working normally, but cannot tell if it is running well. Therefore, establishing effective operation performance optimality assessing mechanism is of great significance. Data driven method, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), deals with linearly related variables and extracts the main information from data. However, PCA lacks in interpretability. Process knowledge based technique, Dynamic Causality Diagram (DCD), intuitively reveals causal relations between variables. But the discretization in DCD decreases calculation precision. A novel approach to realize process operation performance assessment and corresponding cause identification for non-optimal performance is proposed in this article. The proposed method is finally utilized in gold hydrometallurgy process operation performance assessment to illustrate its effectiveness.",

Many approaches, such as PCA, KICA, and so forth, have been proposed and successfully applied in many fields. However, the assumption of data characteristics for each method has significantly limited its application. PCA is more suitable for Gaussian processes, whereas ICA is always used in non-Gaussian processes. ICA-PCA has been proposed to analyze some complex processes that contain both Gaussian and non-Gaussian information, and Kernel-based methods (i.e., KPCA, KICA, and kernel ICA-PCA) have been shown to be more effective in nonlinear processes. Therefore, data characteristics should be known to select the most suitable monitoring method. However, prior knowledge is in fact hard to obtain in most industrial processes. For coping with the problem, a novel strategy that can test the data characteristics has been proposed in this paper to select an appropriate monitoring method automatically.

The time difference is utilized to overcome the data misalignment problem caused by the slurry crystal on the surface of sensors. The input secondary variables of the method are time difference press value relative to the initial time, and all the press sensors located in different depth, while the output is the corresponding time difference value of underflow slurry concentration relative to the initial concentration. It is essential that the initial slurry concentration should be measured precisely. A large amount of data is used to training the soft sensor model, and the method can estimate the real-time thickener underflow slurry concentration accurately. The method is applied to a thickener in certain refinery, and the measurement error is in the allowable deviation.",

To handle these issues, a variable moving window-k nearest neighbor (VMW-kNN) based local modeling, irregular phase division, and monitoring strategy is proposed for uneven batch processes in the present paper. First, a pseudo time-slice is constructed for each sample by searching samples that are closely similar to the concerned sample in which the variable moving window (VMW) strategy is adopted to vary the searching range and the k nearest neighbor (kNN) rule is used to find the similar samples. Second, a novel automatic sequential phase division procedure is proposed by similarity evaluation for local models derived from pseudo time-slices to get different irregular phases and ensure their time sequence. Third, the affiliation of each new sample is real-time judged to determine the proper phase model and fault status can be distinguished from phase shift event. The pr...",

Based on a deep study of the start-up process of injection molding process, a phase-shift sliding window modelling scheme is proposed in this paper for quality prediction. Firstly, to deal with the time-varying problem during the start-up process, sliding windows are built in the batch direction, and multiple continuous models are established to capture the relationship between the process variables and the quality respectively. Secondly, according to the operational characteristics of the plastication phase of injection molding process, a hypothesis that the plastication phase of the current batch has a greater impact on the quality of the next batch than the quality of the current batch is proposed, and the existence of this assumption is verified by the simulation with experimental data. Under the premise of the above assumptions, a new quality prediction scheme is proposed and is verified to be more accurate than the traditional methods.",

        "abstract": "In batch processes, multiple process modes usually exist because operation conditions frequently change to satisfy different market requirements. Besides multiple modes, the multiplicity of operation phases within each batch is an inherent nature of many batch processes. Different between-batch modes and different within-batch phases may exhibit significantly different underlying behaviors and have different effects on the final product quality. In this work, based on multi-phase quality analysis and between-mode quality analysis at the same time, a new quality prediction strategy is developed for injection molding processes. Firstly, a multi-phase residual recursive model is established using each quality residual of the phase regression models, so the contributions of main phases would be combined together. Also, between-mode quality analysis is conducted to judge the relationship between the new mode and the historical modes. Online quality prediction is completed using the selected model built based on the new mode or the historical modes. The simulation results illustrate the feasibility of this strategy.",

Multiple phases within a batch have correlated contributions to final qualities. So, previous phases should be considered in the quality-regression modeling for the current phase. In this paper, a new phase-based recursive statistical quality regression method is proposed for the quality prediction of multiphase batch processes. First, within each batch, main phases are obtained by a basic process analysis. Second, by analyzing phase characteristics, phases which have significant impacts on final qualities are identified as critical-to-quality phases. Then, a recursive quality regression algorithm is proposed using each quality residual of the regression models built in those critical-to-quality phases. Besides, phase characteristics are represented by the average trajectories of process variables within each phase. Quality prediction is performed at each sample point for online prediction.

        "abstract": "The multiple modeling strategy and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) have been widely used to monitor multimode processes. On the basis of a deterministic view, multiple modeling strategy builds the specific model for each mode, which can extract more accurate information for monitoring. However, multiple modeling strategy is unable to deal with the situation in which the online mode information cannot be determined, and this condition easily leads to a severe error when an inappropriate model is used for monitoring. GMM builds a mixture model for the whole process from a probabilistic view. It unites all the models probabilistically for monitoring without having to identify the mode information. However, it may perform badly for some specific modes because some irrelevant models of other modes are introduced by GMM. Besides, it may not efficiently capture the local features especially for complex processes with transitional modes.

        "abstract": "Injection molding process is a typical batch processing technique to manufacture plastic products. In such process, plastic particles are heated to melt, injected to a mold with a certain configuration, and cooled down to solid state. In recent years, because of the more pressing market demand for modern multi-species, multi-standard and high-quality products, more attention have been paid on batch processes which can produce small-quantity, high-added-value products. In order to improve the safety of multimode production process, inter-mode analysis is an urgent need to establish monitoring for multimode production process. Besides inherent process variation along the time direction within each batch, multimode characteristic along the batch direction widely exists in injection molding processes. Different operation modes along the batch direction may not be well captured by a single model. In this work, multiple modes are modeled separately for online process monitoring along the batch direction. First, after a batch cycle is divided into multiple phases, normality test is conducted to analyze the data characteristic. Then, ICA-PCA models are constructed for each mode within each phase according to their different characteristic considering both the Gaussian and non-Gaussian information of the process data. Then online monitoring model is properly chosen by identifying which mode the new sample point belongs to. The application to a real injection molding process illustrates the feasibility and performance of the proposed algorithm.",

Tumor cell proliferation was measured by MTT colorimetric assay and its apoptosis was determined by the flow cytometry (FCM).Firstly, with higher concentrations, 100 microg/mL and 200 microg/mL, 70% ethanol eluate from Marsdensia tenacissima inhibited the proliferation of Raji, NB4 and K562 cells significantly, in a dose and time dependent manner, compared with 30% and 50% ethanol elution components from Marsdensia tenacissima (P < 0.05). Secondly, four C21 steroidal saponin monomer compounds, tenacissosides B,C,I and marsdenoside K, also inhibited the proliferation of Raji, NB4 and K562 cells in vitro significantly, in a dose and time dependent manner, compared with that of control group (P < 0.05). Among them, tenacissoside C showed the strongest inhibition effects on proliferation of these cells under all experimental conditions compared with the other three C21 steroidal saponin monomer compounds (P < 0.05). Furthermor, the IC50 of tenacissosides C on proliferation of Raji, NB4 and K562 cells were 64.1 micromol/L, 70.4 micromol/L and 105.8 micromol/L, respectively. Finally, after Raji, NB4 and K562 cells were treated with 98.4 micromol/L tenacissoside C for 24 h and 48 h, the early apoptosis rates and late apoptosis rates of these tumor cells increased markedly, compared with the control group (P < 0.05).The extract from Marsdensia tenacissima, including different ethanol elution components and C21 steroidal saponin monomer compounds, may inhibit the proliferation of some human hematologic neoplasm cell line cells and induce these tumor cells apoptosis in vitro, especially tenacissoside C, one of the C21 steroidal saponin monomer compounds, showed the strongest effects on proliferation of these tumor cells when compared with other ones, with the strongest inhibition activities on human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Raji cells.",

        "abstract": "Cancer is well known as a leading cause of death in the world. At present, it is the very active area to search for anticancer drugs from natural products. In this study, we evaluated the antitumor property of chloroform extract (CE), n-hexane extract (HE), water extract (WE) and steroidal alkaloids from the cultivated Bulbus Fritillariae ussuriensis (BFU) and its preliminary mechanism for its action was investigated.Firstly, cytotoxicity of the different extracts from BFU against Lewis lung carcinoma cell line (LLC), Human ovarian cancer cell line (A2780), human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2), human lung carcinoma cell line (A549) was measured by MTT assay. Then, we identified the compounds from the active extract of BFU by bioassay guided isolation, determined their antitumor activity in vitro, and detected cell cycle distribution using flow cytometry. Moreover, the extract of BFU which showed remarked anti-proliferative activity in vitro was further evaluated using S180 and LLC tumor models. Additionally, a preliminary investigation of the mechanism of the action was carried out by using histological and immunohistochemical staining technique.The results showed that CE and the purified total alkaloids of BFU (TAFU) exhibited stronger cytotoxic activity than the others (WE and HE). We further isolated the four main steroidal alkaloids from TAFU, and found all alkaloids showed significant cytotoxicity, and peimisine induced G0/G1 phase arrest and increased apoptosis. The results showed that TAFU had significant antitumor activity and low toxicity in vivo. Additionally, the immunohistochemical examinations signified that TAFU remarkably increased caspase-3 expression and reduced microvessel density (MVD) in tumor tissues of transplantable S180 and LLC tumor models.These results achieved suggested that the steroidal alkaloids could hold a good potential for use as an antitumor drug. Notably, our finding is the first report on the antitumor activity of extracts and steroidal alkaloids from the cultivated BFU in vitro and in vivo and its mechanisms.",

The minor interference from other heavy metal ions clearly shows that the PFP-P 2 can be used as the Cu 2+ ion probe with good selectivity. Keywords Conjugated polyelectrolytes Copper(II) ions Fluorescence sensors 1 Introduction Water-soluble conjugated polymers (CPs) have recently attracted much attention as the optical platforms in highly sensitive chemical and biological sensors [1\u201312] . In comparison to small molecule counterparts, these CPs coordinate the action of a large number of absorbing units, and exhibit exceptional fluorescence quenching or energy transfer efficiencies in the presence of oppositely charged acceptors and therefore result in the amplification of optical signals for transduction of chemical or biological recognizing events [13,14] . Since heavy metal ions are significant pollutants and essential trace elements in biological systems, many fluorescent sensors of heavy metal ions based on CPs have been developed [1,15\u201323] . However, the nonaqueous assay requirements for most of these systems prevent their practical application. Although the progress has been made to design sensors for these ions in aqueous solution based on water-soluble CPs [24\u201328] , good selectivity against other interference ions is difficult to achieve using these water-soluble CPs because the binding of metal ions to these materials is driven by nonspecific electrostatic interactions [1] . As a way to circumvent the limitations, Bunz and Kim have applied carboxylated poly( p -phenylene ethynylene)/papain complex for selective mercury(II) ion sensing [29] . Recently we have also developed a highly selective mercury(II) ion assay in aqueous solution using water-soluble polythiophene/DNA complex [30] . However, these biological macromolecules are relatively unstable and expensive. Development of convenient and selective analytical approaches for heavy metal ions in aqueous solution with minor or no interference from other metal ions is still needed [31] . The 2,2\u2032-bipyridine ligand can effectively coordinate transition metal ions and 2,2\u2032-bipyridyl-phenylene-vinylene-based polymers have been used to develop sensitive and selective metal ion sensing [15,16] . However, most of these polymers do not dissolve in water and nonaqueous assay is required. Furthermore their quantum yields are usually lower. Polyfluorene and their derivatives are well-known conjugated polymers that have rigid planar units, high photoluminescence quantum efficiencies and unique chemical and physical properties. Water-soluble polyfluorenes are widely used as optical platforms for highly sensitive chemical and biological sensors [1,2,6,7] . To combine the advantages of 2,2\u2032-bipyridyl-phenylene-vinylene and water-soluble polyfluorenes in sensor application, in this paper we design and synthesize a new series of water-soluble cationic polyfluorene copolymers containing 2,2\u2032-bipyridyl-phenylene-vinylene moieties (PFP-P 1\u20133 ) in the backbone. Among them, PFP-P 2 can be used as selective and sensitive fluorescent probe to detect Cu 2+ ions in aqueous medium. 2 Results and discussion The Cu 2+ ion detection system functions as outlined in Scheme 1 . In the absence of the Cu 2+ ion, the PFP-P possesses ammonium moieties in the side chain and exhibits strong fluorescence emission in aqueous solution. Upon adding the Cu 2+ ion, the PFP-P coordinates to Cu 2+ ions through weak N\u22efCu interactions, and its fluorescence is efficiently quenched by the Cu 2+ ion [16] . By triggering the change of emission intensity of PFP-P, it is possible to assay Cu 2+ ions in aqueous solution. A series of water-soluble cationic polyfluorene copolymers (PFP-P 1\u20133 , see Scheme 2 for their chemical structures and synthesis) containing the 2,2\u2032-bipyridine moieties in backbone were designed and synthesized as the fluorescent probe for Cu 2+ ions. Reaction of 5,5\u2032-dimethyl-2,2\u2032-bipyridine ( 1 ) with excess triphenylphosphine in toluene under reflux provides compound 2 in 88% yield. Compound 3 was prepared by Wittig condensation reaction of compound 2 with 4-bromobenzaldehyde in anhydrous methylene chloride in the presence of an excess of sodium ethoxide in 24% yield. The PFP-P 1\u20133 were synthesized by Suzuki coupling of monomers 3 and 5 with 1,4-phenyldiboronic ester ( 4 ) in the presence of 2.0 M aqueous K 2 CO 3 and catalytic Pd(dppf)Cl 2 in tetrahydrofuran. The molar feed ratios of monomers 3 to 5 were 5:95, 10:90 and 20:80, respectively, and the corresponding copolymers were referred to as PFP-P 1 , PFP-P 2 and PFP-P 3 . The actual 2,2\u2032-bipyridine rations for PFP-P 1 , PFP-P 2 , and PFP-P 3 were determined to be 0.08, 13.2, and 17.7%, respectively, which were obtained from their 1 H NMR spectra using the ratio of the integrations of 3 to 5 characteristic proton signals. The crude polymers were purified by dialysis using a dialysis membrane with a cutoff at M = 7000 g mol \u22121 for 2 days to afford yellow powders. The UV\u2013vis absorption spectra of these polymers in water exhibit maximum peak at 381 nm, and the emission spectra show maximum peak at 418 nm ( Fig.\u00a01 ). The fluorescence quantum yield of PFP-P 1 , PFP-P 2 and PFP-P 3 is 33, 26 and 15% in water with 9,10-diphenylanthracene as the standard and that of monomer 3 is 1%. The higher 2,2\u2032-bipyridine content in the copolymer can decease the fluorescence quantum yield. Fig.\u00a02 shows the emission spectra of PFP-P 2 in water with a constant concentration ([PFP-P 2 ] = 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 M in RU) upon successive addition of the Cu 2+ ion ([Cu 2+ ] = 0\u201310 \u03bcM) with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm. The addition of the Cu 2+ ion resulted in a gradual quenching of the PFP-P 2 emission, and a maximum quenching efficiency of 72% was obtained. The quenching efficiencies of PFP-P 1 and PFP-P 3 were also obtained as 60 and 70%, respectively. These results show that the higher 2,2\u2032-bipyridine content in the copolymer is favorable to increase the quenching efficiency, whereas to decrease the fluorescence quantum yield. The lowest concentration of Cu 2+ ions to be measured was 20 nM. It is demonstrated that the use of water-soluble cationic conjugated polymers provides an approach to detect Cu 2+ ions with high sensitivity. The fluorescence quenching response of PFP-P 2 upon adding Cu 2+ ions was compared to that of monomer 3 . The Stern\u2013Volmer quenching constant ( K sv ) is determined by monitoring measurable changes in the fluorescence of PFP-P 2 via the Stern\u2013Volmer equation (Eq. (1) ) [32] : (1) I 0 / I = 1 + K sv [ Q ] At low concentrations of metal ion (0\u20134.0 \u03bcM) profiles, linear Stern\u2013Volmer plot for PFP-P 2 was obtained with the K sv values of 1.44 \u00d7 10 7 M \u22121 (see Fig.\u00a03 c), which is 100 times greater than that of monomer 3 , indicating that the conjugated polymer chain significantly amplified the quenching. Fig.\u00a03 shows the emission spectra and the fluorescence quenching efficiency (1 \u2212 I / I 0 ) of PFP-P 2 in the presence of various metal ions ([PFP-P 2 ] = 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 M, [metal ion] = 3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 M for each). The fluorescence of PFP-P 2 is effectively quenched upon the addition of Cu 2+ ions. The fluorescence of PFP-P 2 is nearly not influenced by the addition of Ca 2+ , Zn 2+ and Ni 2+ ions. For the other heavy metal ions, Hg 2+ , Co 2+ , Ag + , Mn 2+ and Pb 2+ , a small fluorescence quenching of PFP-P 2 is observed, however, the fluorescence quenching efficiencies (20\u201325%) are also much lower than that of the Cu 2+ ion. Fig.\u00a03 c shows the Stern\u2013Volmer plots of PFP-P 2 in the presence of Hg 2+ , Ag + , Mn 2+ , Pb 2+ and Cu 2+ ions. The linear Stern\u2013Volmer plots were obtained with the K sv values of 1.44 \u00d7 10 7 , 1.45 \u00d7 10 6 , 1.95 \u00d7 10 6 , 1.80 \u00d7 10 6 and 2.39 \u00d7 10 6 M \u22121 for Cu 2+ , Mn 2+ , Pb 2+ , Hg 2+ and Ag + , respectively. The K sv value for Cu 2+ ions is approximately 10 times higher than that for Mn 2+ , Pb 2+ ions, 8 times higher than that for Hg 2+ ions and 6 times higher than that for Ag + ions ( Fig.\u00a03 d). It can be easily recognized that the PFP-P 2 has specific recognition ability for the Cu 2+ ion. To study the effect of copolymer composition on the selectivity to metal ions, the fluorescence quenching efficiency (1 \u2212 I / I 0 ) of PFP-P 1 and PFP-P 3 was also studied in the presence of various metal ions ([PFP-P 1 or PFP-P 3 ] = 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 M, [metal ion] = 3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 M for each) ( Fig.\u00a04 ). For PFP-P 1 with lowest 2,2\u2032-bipyridine content, the selectivity to other heavy metal ions except for Hg 2+ ions is a little smaller than that of PFP-P 2 due to the decreased fluorescence quenching efficiency upon the addition of Cu 2+ ions. For PFP-P 3 with highest 2,2\u2032-bipyridine content, the fluorescence quenching efficiencies are increased upon adding most of other heavy metal ions in comparison to those for PFP-P 2 , which also lower the selectivity of Cu 2+ ion detection. For the Cu 2+ ion detection, one of the essential requirements is minor or no interference from mixed other heavy metal ions. The fluorescence signal response of the PFP-P 2 to Cu 2+ ion was examined in the presence of other metal ions ( Fig.\u00a05 ). To the solution of PFP-P 2 in aqueous solution mixed metal ions (Pb 2+ , Hg 2+ , Zn 2+ , Mn 2+ , Ag + ) were added, the integrated fluorescence intensity of PFP-P 2 was quenched by approximately 30%. After Cu 2+ ion was added to the mixture solution, the fluorescence intensity of PFP-P 2 significantly decreased and about 70% fluorescence of PFP-P 2 was quenched. The minor interference from other metal ions clearly shows that the PFP-P 2 can be used as Cu 2+ ion probe with good selectivity. To gain insight into the optical response mechanism of the PFP-P 2 to Cu 2+ ions, we studied the absorption spectra of PFP-P 2 in the presence of Cu 2+ ions. As shown in Fig.\u00a06 a, the absorbance intensity of PFP-P 2 and its absorption maximum at about 381 nm in the presence of Cu 2+ ions were hardly shifted in comparison to those of PFP-P 2 itself. It was noted that the absorption spectrum of PFP-P 2 may not be altered significantly upon adding Cu 2+ ions due to the low content of 2,2\u2032-bipyridine moieties in the polymer backbone. Thus the electrochemical behavior of monomer 3 and PFP-P 2 was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig.\u00a06 b and c, the oxidation potentials of monomer 3 were increased in the presence of Cu 2+ ions, however, those of PFP-P 2 (1.44 and 1.25 V) were decreased to 1.03 V upon adding Cu 2+ ions (the peaks at 0.38 and 0.78 V are due to Cu 2+ ions). It implies that the fluorescence quenching of PFP-P 2 originates from the changes in the electron density along the polymer backbone [1,22] . 3 Conclusions In summary, we report a fluorescent detection for Cu 2+ ions in aqueous solution with good sensitivity and minor interference from other metal ions using a cationic polyfluorene copolymer containing 2,2\u2032-bipyridine moieties in the backbone. The fluorescence quenching of the conjugated polymer is mainly attributed to the changes in the electron density along the polymer backbone. The assay benefits from the sensitivity of optical signals from conjugated polymers and the simplicity of fluorescence measurement techniques. To improve the selectivity of Cu 2+ ion detection, it will be our further work in the near future to synthesize cationic conjugated polymers containing functional groups that bind Cu 2+ ions more specifically and tightly. 4 Experimental part 4.1 Materials and measurements Starting materials were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company or Alfa-Aesar and used without further purification. 5,5\u2032-Dimethyl-2,2\u2032-bipyridine ( 1 ) [33] and 2,7-dibromo-9,9-bis(6\u2032- N , N , N -triethylammoniumhexyl)fluorene ( 5 ) [34] were prepared according to the literature procedure. The 1 H NMR spectra were recorded on AV400 spectrometer. UV\u2013vis absorption spectra were taken on a JASCO V-550 spectrometer. Fluorescence measurements were obtained in a 3 mL quartz cuvette at room temperature using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorometer equipped with a Xenon lamp excitation source. The measurements were all in water solution. The cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed at room temperature in dried acetonitrile/DMSO (9:1) solutions containing 0.04 M TBAPF 6 as supporting electrolyte. A three-electrode configuration consisting of a glassy carbon working electrode, a Pt counter electrode and an Ag wire quasi-reference electrode was used. The scan rate is 50 mV/s. The water was purified using a Millipore filtration system. 4.2 Synthesis of compound 2 A solution of compound 1 (100 mg, 0.29 mmol) and triphenylphosphine (380 mg, 1.45 mmol) in 20 mL toluene was refluxed for 2 h. The precipitate was filtered off while the suspension was still hot. The collected solid was washed with toluene subsequently and dried under vacuum to afford a white solid (220 mg, 88%). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3 ): \u03b4 = 8.35\u20138.33 (d, 2H), 7.89 (s, 2H), 7.81\u20137.70 (m, 18H), 7.62\u20137.57 (m, 12H), 7.47 (d, 2H), 5.61\u20135.58 (d, 4H). MS (MALDI-TOF): m / z = 705.8 (M + ). 4.3 Synthesis of compound 3 To a solution of compound 2 (350 mg, 0.4 mmol) and 4-bromobenzaldehyde (150 mg, 0.8 mmol) in anhydrous methylene chloride (25 mL) was added sodium ethoxide (3.0 mL, 1.0 M solution in ethanol). The solution was allowed to stir at room temperature overnight, and then was poured into water. The organic phase was separated and washed with water. After the organic solvent was evaporated to near dryness, hexane was added and the precipitate was discarded. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with MeOH/CHCl 3 (1/400) as eluent to give a light yellow solid (50 mg, 24%). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3 ): \u03b4 = 8.25\u20138.19 (d, 4H), 7.38\u20137.36 (d, 4H), 7.12\u20137.09 (d, 6H), 6.75\u20136.62 (m, 4H). MS (MALDI-TOF): m / z = 519.1 (M + ). 4.4 A typical synthesis of PFP-P 2 A mixture of compound 5 (296 mg, 0.35 mmol), compound 3 (20 mg, 0.04 mmol) and 5,5-dimethyl-2-(4-(5,5-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborinan-2-yl)phenyl)-1,3,2-dioxaborinane (116.6 mg, 0.39 mmol) in 6 mL of THF and 3 mL of aqueous potassium carbonate (2.0 M) was degassed and Pd(dppf)Cl 2 (10 mg) was subsequently added in nitrogen stream. The resulted mixture was vigorously stirred at 85 \u00b0C for 2 days. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting solution was poured into acetone to get the precipitate, and then purified by dialysis using a dialysis membrane with a cutoff at M = 7000 g mol \u22121 for 2 days to yield 60 mg of PFP-P 2 (yield 22%). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO- d 6 ): \u03b4 = 7.95 (br), 7.37 (br), 3.12\u20132.88 (br), 2.71 (br), 2.07 (br), 1.36\u20131.05 (br), 0.65 (br). 4.5 Fluorescence quenching of PFP-P 2 by metal ions The quenching experiment was performed by successive additions of metal ions ([metal ion] = 0\u201340 \u03bcM) to the solution of PFP-P 2 ([PFP-P 2 ] = 1.0 \u03bcM) in aqueous solution at room temperature, and the fluorescence spectra were measured at once.

Good energy conversion efficiency was obtained. The film of PTCA on TiO 2 yielded an incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of approximately 40% in the wavelength region of 440 to 530 nm, while that for PNDCA was approximately 14% at the wavelength region from 460 to 510 nm. Further studies concentrated on the doping of this system with bromine (Br 2 ). The results indicated that the sensitizing wavelength region was red shifted, which was advantageous for solar light harvesting. Furthermore, the doped films gave lower quantum conversion efficiency than the non-doped films. Keywords Dye sensitization Nanocrystalline TiO 2 Perylene derivatives",

        "abstract": "The detection of pathogens plays a crucial role in clinical applications. In recent years, conjugated polymers are favorable in chemical and biological detections due to their remarkable light harvesting and optical signal amplification characteristics. However, most of the conjugated polymers exhibit cytotoxicity due to their rigid and hydrophobic backbone. To circumvent these deficiencies, one promising strategy is to develop a non-conjugated polymer with fluorescence, low-toxic and water-soluble characteristics. In this paper, we describe the synthesis and characterization of a novel water-soluble non-conjugated polymer (P1) containing chromophores with groups of quaternary ammonium cations in the side-chains and non-conjugated linkers of oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG), the capability of which would not only increase the flexibility and hydrophilicity of the main-chain, but also reduce nonspecific adsorption to proteins and cell surfaces of microbial pathogens. Thus, through the balance between pendent groups of quaternary ammonium cations and OEG linkers, self-luminous P1 molecules could realize visual optical discrimination and detection of three kinds of microbial pathogens rapidly and simply by using a fluorescence microscope.",

Cationic poly(phenylene vinylene) derivative (PPV) as photoelectrochemical active species was modified on the electrode. Under light irradiation, PPV could be excited and generate efficient photocurrent. PPV also had the ability to bind with negatively charged membrane of pathogenic microorganisms, which hindered the electron transfer between electrode and electrolyte. As a result, the photocurrent would decrease obviously. For E. coli, B. subtilis and C. albicans, the photocurrent density was reduced by 18, 33 and 59\u2009%, respectively. Based on the reduction degree of the photocurrent after capturing different types of species of pathogenic microorganisms, a PEC sensor for discrimination of pathogenic microorganisms was realized.",

Herein, we presented the first demonstration for the use of graphdiyne (GDY) as photothermo-acoustic wave nanotransducers for simultaneous effective photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT) in living mice. With a large extinction coefficient in near-infrared (NIR) region, upon irradiated by 808 nm laser, GDY not only exhibits a stable photothermal performance with a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 42%, but also provides an excellent photoacoustic response. Owing to its good biocompatibility modified with PEGylation, GDY can be simultaneously used as PAI probe and PTT agent and exhibits an efficient photothermal ablation of cancer cells in living mice. This work opens a new way into the development of 2D graphdiynes as novel theranostic platform for cancer treatment.",

Upon addition of PFP to planktonic Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), electrostatic interactions bring cationic PFP to the surface of S. aureus, which possesses negative charges. As the amount of PFP coated on S. aureus becomes saturated, the interactions of bacteria to bacteria and bacteria to surface may be disrupted, resulting in reduced biofilm formation. After the biofilm matures, those PFP on the surface of the biofilm can generate ROS under white light irradiation, which has the ability to inactivate bacteria nearby. Once the biofilm is broken, PFP can penetrate throughthe biofilm and continuously generate ROS under irradiation, resulting in biofilm disruption. As a consequence, this makes conjugated polymers a very promising material for the disruption of biofilm in biomedical and industrial applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Oxidative stress stimulated by angiotensin II (Ang II) plays an important role in the progression of inflammation and cardiovascular disease. In this work, polythiophene modified with dihydropyridine groups (PTDHP) realized the control of oxidative stress induced by Angiotensin II stimulation in living cells, by inhibiting the activity of NADPH oxidase  via  DHP groups. Upon light irradiation, the PTDHP could sensitize surrounding oxygen molecules to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). The generated ROS oxidized the pendant DHP of polythiophene into pyridine group, which inactivated the control ability of DHP to oxidative stress in living cells. Thus, PTDHP can not only control the intracellular oxidative stress effectively and suppress ROS to some degree in dark, but also regulate its anti-oxidative effect under light irradiation.",

In an effort to address this threat, we develop an imidazolium-functionalized conjugated polyelectrolyte that exhibits profound light-activated biocidal activity. Here we report the synthesis, photophysical properties, and biocidal activity of a regioregular head-to-tail polythiophene substituted with cationic imidazolium units (P3HT-Im) prepared by Grignard metathesis controlled polymerization. In water, P3HT-Im has a broad absorption in the visible region and exhibited a remarkably high biocidal efficiency with both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria at sub-microgram per milliliter concentrations. Moreover, mammalian cell studies suggest that P3HT-Im is nontoxic to mammalian cells at concentrations of \u226420 \u03bcg/mL over a short time scale (\u22641 h) in the dark and light, and the targeting rate-dependent selective mechanism is revealed.

Herein, a water-soluble conjugated polymer is designed as a membrane probe. The probe shows a strong affinity toward lipid membranes owing to the high charge density from abundant imidazolium moieties together with the moderate rigidity and hydrophobicity derived from the conjugated backbone. Upon binding with a membrane, the interchain FRET of the probe was substantially enhanced, which resulted in the emission of both blue and red fluorescence. This is favorable for dual-color imaging. Finally, cellular experiments demonstrate the excellent performance of this macromolecular probe on stable binding with cell membranes without the appearance of cell endocytocysis even after a long retention time.",

Herein, we bring novel insights into a water-soluble conjugated polyelectlyte by deeply studying its properties in cells. Poly(9, 9-bis (6u0027- N,N,N -trimethylammonium hexyl)fluorene phenylene) (PFP), a good biosensing material, was studied in this paper. The biocompatibility of PFP was investigated in different cells, and cell cycle analysis was carried out to explore the reasons of different biocompatibility of PFP to cells. After irradiation, fluorescence enhancement of blue emission and turn-on of long-wavelength emission of PFP in HepG2 cells was observed, which was first reported as far as we know. The differentiated biocompatibility of PFP and its particular imaging properties in cancer cells can help to guide the application of conjugated polymers in cells and provide a new dimension in designing sensitive and responsive imaging materials.",

Their selective imaging towards  S. aureus  were thus realized. The selective imaging towards  S. aureus  was also confirmed even under the blend of microbes. PFP-3 shows stronger fluorescence imaging signal than PFP-1 and PFP-2. Zeta potential and isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) tests demonstrated that both electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions played important roles in the binding between PFPs and pathogens.

This study might be a new avenue for the design of three-dimensional branched conjugated molecule and specific location imaging in living cell.",

Thus, it is anticipated that more effective antibiotic switches should be obtained by further exploring the developed strategies. Here, we report an improved pretreatment strategy using a surfactant (Triton X-100) for constructing an effective supramolecular antibiotic switch based on a poly(fluorene-co-phenylene) derivative (PFP) and cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), which can regulate the aggregation state of polymers before the supramolecular self-assembly process occurs.

By increasing the hydrophobic ability of side chain moieties, there is a gradually blue shift for the maximum absorption wavelength and red shift for the maximum emission wavelength, a reducing trend for fluorescence quantum yields, a growing trend for Stokes shift, and an increasing trend for the mean sizes in the order of PT, PT-ADA, and PT-DDA. All the synthesized polymers show low toxicity and good photostability and accumulate in the lysosomes of A549 cells. Furthermore, the introduction of porphyrin group to PT-ADA side chain (PT-ADA-PPR) broadens the absorption and emission ranges of PT-ADA. PT-ADA-PPR could be excited at two different excitation wavelengths (488\u2005nm and 559\u2005nm) and exhibits two emission pathways, and dual-color fluorescence images (orange and red) of PT-ADA-PPR accumulated in A549 cells are observed. Thus, PT-ADA-PPR could be used as an excellent dual-color fluorescent and lysosome-specific imaging material.",

Furthermore, the fluorescent characteristic of PMNT makes it simultaneously able to trace its cellular uptake and localization by cell imaging. cDNA microarray study shows that PMNT can greatly regulate genes related to cell growth or differentiation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of cell growth or differentiation promotion by polyelectrolyte material without the need of serum, thereby providing an important demonstration of degenerative biomaterial discovery through polymer design.",

By virtue of versatility in molecular design, a new peptide-like cell membrane-broken molecule, oligo-(7,7\u2032-bifluoren-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (OFBT) possessing a conjugated backbone and eight pendant guanidyl moieties was designed and synthesized. OFBT exhibits favorable broad-spectrum of antimicrobial activity to pathogens including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and fungi with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) below 3.0 \u03bcM. Moreover, OFBT exhibits high selectivity for pathogens over human cells to make it a promising broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.",

Herein, we designed and synthesized a new conjugated oligomer, oligo(p-phenylenevinylene-co-benzothiazole) (OPVBT), which could be used as photosensitizer to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon light illumination. Advantageously, OPVBT was found to specifically accumulate in mitochondria, which is beneficial for effective subcellular organelles-targeted PDT. A biocompatible and biodegradable hydrogel was constructed based on Michael-type addition between cysteine-terminated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-cleavable oligopeptides and 4-arm vinyl sulfone-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-VS). By functionalizing hydrogel with OPVBT and cell adhesion peptide motif RGD, cell attachment and spreading on the hydrogel were easily realized.

Isothermal titration microcalorimetry results show that the driving forces for polythiophene/A\u03b216\u201322 assembly formation are electrostatic interactions, as well as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The assemblies accelerate the photoinduced electrons transfer from polythiophene upon light excitation and eventually enhance the hydrogen evolution.

Considerably enhanced GFP fluorescence under near-infrared 2-photon excitation is demonstrated both in solution and in HeLa cells. The results suggest applications in 2-photon fluorescence imaging of cells, tissues, and organs of living animals expressing GFP.",

Many creative strategies have been proposed to furnish CPs with distinguished properties or integrate CPs with other functional moieties to form multifunctional materials, which have been widely applied in different biological conditions, ranging from  in vitro  to  in vivo  experiments. This review provides a brief introduction to recent strategies for constructing these CP-based materials for biological sensing and imaging applications, where the design strategies of the two basic components (backbones and side chains) of CPs are firstly highlighted, followed by the construction of CP-based composites including nanoparticle strategies and hybridization strategies.

In this work, we demonstrate that water-soluble cationic conjugated polymers (PFP-G2) can interact with bacteria to form aggregates through electrostatic interactions. With bacteria coated in the aggregate, PFP-G2 can induce the bacteria QS system and prolong the time duration of QS signal molecules (autoinducer-2 (AI-2)) production. The prolonged AI-2 can bind with specific protein and continuously regulate downstream gene expression. Consequently, the bacteria show a higher survival rate against antibiotics, resulting in decreased antimicrobial susceptibility. Also, AI-2 induced by PFP-G2 can stimulate 55.54 \u00b1 12.03% more biofilm in E. coli. This method can be used to understand cell\u2013cell communication and regulate biological functions, such as the production of signaling molecules, antibiotics, other microbial metabolites, and even virulence.",

With the aim of developing new antimicrobial agents, we designed and synthesized a new conjugated polymer ( PFPhim ), which possesses an imidazolium containing backbone. The cationic backbone enables it to strongly interact with bacterial membrane leading to an antimicrobial ability that is more potent than that of a conjugated polymer containing a neutral backbone.  PFPhim  also displays strong photodynamic antimicrobial activity.",

        "abstract": "Photothermal therapy (PTT) holds great promise for noninvasive cancer treatment. To fulfill this goal, highly effective and low-risk photothermal agents have been intensively explored. Here, we present a new PTT material based on conjugated polymer dots (Pdots) that exhibit strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption and high photostability. The Pdots result in a thermal response upon illumination with a NIR laser, leading to a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 65%. Thus, the photothermal ablation of cancer cells using the Pdots both in vitro and in vivo can be achieved, highlighting the potential of Pdots as a nanoplatform for clinical therapy. They also open up a new avenue to develop new photothermal therapeutic materials.",

The conjugated backbone and hydrophilic side chains of cationic CPs allow them to capture Escherichia coli on the surface of the platform. The captured bacteria induced fluorescence response of CPs coupled with plasmon-enhanced fluorescence from the Ag nanostructure yields a bioassay platform for bacterial detection. Moreover, the strong antimicrobial activity of CPs, originating from its conducting polymer backbone, suggests great promise for applications as an efficient antibacterial system. This new platform permits bacterial detection and also shows antimicrobial activity suggesting great promise for application as a novel multifunctional sensing and antibacterial system.",

        "abstract": "A cationic dendritic polyfluorene (PFP) is examined as a siRNA delivery vector. This material was designed to facilitate the nucleic acid binding, encapsulation and efficient cellular uptake. PFP can effectively protect siRNA against nuclease degradation, which is necessary for gene carriers. PFP can be used for multidrug resistance gene-targeted siRNA delivery in doxorubicin (Dox)-resistant human breast cancer cells (MCF7) cells. As a siRNA transfection agent, PFP can efficiently achieve the reversal of drug resistance and enhance the drug sensitivity. These new features and capabilities represent a major step toward conjugated polymers that can function for therapeutic application.",

The photosensitizing behavior and bacteria-killing performance of a pyridinium-substituted tetraphenylethylene with an alkyne group (TPE-A-Py ) is reported herein. Interestingly, TPE-A-Py exhibits higher photosensitizing efficiency than TPE-Py (without alkyne group) when I was used as a counteranion. This is well explained by the fact that the \u0394\u0395 between the excited singlet state (S ) and triplet state (T ) was lower for TPE-A-Py than for TPE-Py , according to theoretical calculations. Moreover, replacement of I with other anions (PF , N(SO CF ) and BPh ) led to a decrease of photosensitizing efficiency for TPE-A-Py . Notably, TPE-A-Py could be used as an efficient photosensitizer to photo-inactivate ampicillin-resistant (amp ) E.\u2005coli at low concentration under white-light irradiation very quickly.",

In this paper, the authors considered storage opportunities offered by oil reservoirs and deep saline aquifers in the Jiyang Depression, in east China. Based on detailed geological analysis and assessment of CO2 storage suitability, the Dongying Sag and Linyi\u2010Shanghe areas of the Huimin Sag within the Jiyang Depression appear promising for CO2 storage. Following more detailed characterization, the second and third members of the Shahejie Formation located in these two areas appear the most promising for CO2 storage. Within the areas identified as having potential for storage, 55 primary and 62 secondary recommended storage units were defined, with a total theoretical capacity of 5.02 \u00d7 108 tonnes (t) CO2. This represents storage of CO2 emissions from large\u2010scale sources in the Jiyang Depression for more than 30 years at current emission rates.",

Here, a strategy is reported to realize the remote control of the activities of potassium channels via photothermal inactivation of calmodulin (CaM) by using reduced graphene oxide decorated with calmodulin binding peptide (rGO-P) as the transducer with near-infrared light (NIR) irradiation. Upon NIR light irradiation, the CaM/Ca bound to rGO-P is inactivated by the photothermal effect of rGO-P, resulting in the incapability of binding with Ca . Hence, the closed Kv10.1 channel is converted to be open in the presence of calcium in living cells. Meanwhile, the SK2 channel is induced to be closed from the open state and the Kir2.1 channel is unaffected by the intracellular inactivation of CaM. This strategy gives a noninvasive and effective approach to remotely control the activities of potassium channels, offering an alternative for the development of optogenetics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Recent investigations revealed the close relationship between H 2 S and HNO in biological systems. It is significant to develop an efficient fluorescent sensor to realize the discriminative sensing of HNO and H 2 S. Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel fluorescent sensor ( CuHCD ) with hemicyanine-carbazole as fluorophore and bipyridine-triazole-Cu 2+ complex as receptor, which enabled the selective recognition of HNO and H 2 S, respectively via the non-covalent modulation of surfactant assemblies. The  CuHCD /surfactant sensor system exhibited excellent selectivity for H 2 S at 5\u00a0mM SDS in HEPES buffer, and displayed high specificity for HNO at 1\u00a0mM SDS in HEPES buffer over other common anions and reactive species. Different detection mechanisms in sensing H 2 S and HNO were deeply investigated. The results showed that H 2 S seized Cu 2+  from the complex to recover the fluorescence of  HCD , while HNO reduced Cu 2+  to Cu +  in the complex to turn on the fluorescence. In different SDS micellar systems,  HCD  possessed different dispersity and binding capacity with Cu 2+ , which led to the selective detection of H 2 S and HNO, respectively. The hypothesis was further confirmed by replacing SDS micelles with liposome under the same conditions.",

Here, we report a novel system based on the conjugated polymer poly[(9,9-bis{6\u2032-[N-(triethylene glycol methyl ether)-di(1H-imidazolium)methane]hexyl}-2,7-fluorene)-co-4,7-di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole] tetrabromide (PFDBT-BIMEG), which enables efficient microbial pathogen discrimination and killing. The functional side chains of PFDBT-BIMEG enabled both electrostatic and salt bridge interactions with microorganisms. Microorganism binding events caused a change in the aggregation structure of PFDBT-BIMEG, which could be recognized by a change of its fluorescence signal by intramolecular Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). This sensing strategy allowed rapid and sensitive distinction of microbial pathogens within 15 min. We performed linear discrimination analysis that featured this advance to confirm that the polymer PFDBT-BIMEG could accurately clas...",

        "abstract": "Organic fluorophores are indispensible in chemical/biological imaging. The conjugated fluorescent molecules simultaneously possessing highly tunable emission, high quantum yield in solvents of different polarities, and large Stokes shift are quite rare. Herein, we report a new category of fluorophores based on diarylated thieno[3,4-b]thiophenes efficiently synthesized by direct C\u2013H arylation reaction. TbT-Fluors showed full-color-tunable emissions with large Stokes shifts. Intriguingly, the fluorescence quantum yields of TbT-Fluors are barely sensitive to solvent polarities, approaching 100%. Based on photophysical and theoretical investigations, we found that the enhanced oscillator strength of the S1-S0 transition and increased T2-S1 energy difference can sufficiently compensate the negative effect from the decreased energy gap and increased reorganization energy in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Bioimaging applications revealed that some TbT-Fluors can penetrate the cell membrane and are superior for imaging in terms of high photochemical stability and low cytotoxicity. Furthermore, TbT-PhF exhibits specific colocalization with mitochondria in living cells.",

COEs also offer a novel molecular approach to biosensing, bioimaging, and disease therapy. Substantial progress has been made in the past decade at the intersection of chemistry, materials science, and the biological sciences developing COEs and their polymer analogues, namely, conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs), into synthetic systems with biological and biomedical utility. CPEs have traditionally attracted more attention in arenas of sensing, imaging, and therapy. However, the precisely defined molecular structures and interactions of COEs offer potential key advantages over CPEs, including higher reliability and fluorescence quantum efficiency, larger diversity of subcellular targeting strategies, and improved selectivity to biomolecules. Here, the unique-and sometimes overlooked-properties of COEs are discussed and the noticeable progress in their use for biological sensing, imaging, and therapy is reviewed.",

Light absorption by a robust and efficient photosensitizer is one of the key steps in solar energy conversion. However, common photosensitizers, including [Ru(bpy)3]2+, remain far from the ideal. In this work, we exploited the performance of conjugated polymers (CPs) as photosensitizers in photodriven hydrogen evolution in aqueous solution (pH 6). Interestingly, CPs, such as poly(fluorene-co-phenylene) derivative (PFP, 429 mmolH2\u2022gCP-1\u2022h-1), exhibit steady and high reactivity towards hydrogen evolution; this performance can rival that of a phosphonated [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (RuP) under the same conditions, indicating that CPs are promising metal-free photosensitizers for future application in photocatalysis.",

The solvatochromic behavior of hydroxyperylenebisimide was studied, and the structure of naphthoperylenebisimide was determined by X-ray crystallography. The spectral studies indicated that the hydroxyperylenebisimide and naphthoperylenebisimide units of dyad 9 were strongly coupled in the ground state, and as a result the fluorescence of the naphthoperylenebisimide unit was almost quenched and that of the hydroxyperylenebisimide unit was greatly enhanced due to the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). As we expected, this FRET process could be tuned with the addition of protons, base, and ferric ions. This behavior of dyad 9 could be interpreted by a two-input INH logic gate, while in the presence of Fe(III), the ion complex of 9 could execute a two-input XOR logic gate. By changing the output signal, a combinational logic circuit with three inputs could also be interpreted.",

        "abstract": "Conjugated polymers have great potential applications in bioimaging. However, the aggregation of conjugated polymers driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions in aqueous media results in the reduction of photoluminescence quantum efficiency. In present work we synthesized a carboxylate gemini surfactant [sodium 2,6-didodecyl-4-hydroxy-2,6-diaza-1,7-heptanedicarboxylate (SDHC)] to adjust the aggregation behaviors and fluorescence properties of conjugated polymers [anionic poly(2-methoxy-5-propyloxy sulfonate phenylene vinylene) (MPS-PPV) and cationic poly(3-alkoxy-4-methylthiophene) (PMNT)]. This gemini surfactant shows very low critical micellar concentration (CMC) in aqueous solution and forms vesicles above CMC. In neutral and acidic conditions, MPS-PPV combines with the SDHC vesicles mainly via hydrophobic interactions and forms the aggregates in which the photoluminescence quantum efficiency of MPS-PPV is highly enhanced from 0.1% to 27%. As to PMNT, the molecules are located in the bilayer of SDHC vesicles through both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, and this structure prevents the production and release of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, SDHC is nontoxic and can effectively decrease the dark- and photocytotoxicity of MPS-PPV and PMNT, laying a good foundation for their bioimaging application. The living cell imaging indicates that the surfactant/conjugated polymer aggregates can stain the MCF-7 cells with main location in the lysosome. This work provides insight into how to improve the fluorescence properties and bioimaging applications of conjugated polymers by surfactants.",

        "abstract": "Ginsenoside is a large family of triterpenoid saponins from Panax ginseng, which possesses various important biological functions. Due to the very similar structures of these complex glycoconjugates, it is crucial to develop a powerful analytic method to identify ginsenosides qualitatively or quantitatively. We herein report an eight-channel fluorescent sensor array as artificial tongue to achieve the discriminative sensing of ginsenosides. The fluorescent cross-responsive array was constructed by four boronlectins bearing flexible boronic acid moieties (FBAs) with multiple reactive sites and two linear poly(phenylene-ethynylene) (PPEs). An \"on-off-on\" response pattern was afforded on the basis of superquenching of fluorescent indicator PPEs and an analyte-induced allosteric indicator displacement (AID) process. Most importantly, it was found that the canonical distribution of ginsenoside data points analyzed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was highly correlated with the inherent molecular structures of the analytes, and the absence of overlaps among the five point groups reflected the effectiveness of the sensor array in the discrimination process. Almost all of the unknown ginsenoside samples at different concentrations were correctly identified on the basis of the established mathematical model. Our current work provided a general and constructive method to improve the quality assessment and control of ginseng and its extracts, which are useful and helpful for further discriminating other complex glycoconjugate families.",

The antibacterial activity of Por in the dark could be turned off upon binding with CB[7], whereas the antibacterial activity under white-light illumination could be turned on. In addition, its antibacterial efficiency could be greatly enhanced by introducing metal ions. When Pd(II) was introduced into porphyrin, its antibacterial efficiency was enhanced from 40 to 100%. It should be noted that these small molecules showed little to no cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells even at concentrations higher than those under the antibacterial condition studied. This line of research will provide a strategy for germicides consisting of quaternary ammonium groups to fight against bacterial accumulation in the long term and holds huge potential for application in the real world.",

        "abstract": "Despite efficacious antimicrobial activity, cationic oligomeric surfactants show strong skin irritation potential due to their larger cationic charge numbers and multiple hydrophobic chains. This work reports that the incorporation of \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-CDs with different cavity sizes can effectively improve the mildness of cationic ammonium trimeric surfactant DTAD with a star-shaped spacer while maintaining its high antibacterial activity. On the basis of the different cavity sizes of CDs and the asymmetry in the spacer of DTAD, the CD/DTAD mixtures form \u03b1-CD@DTAD, 2\u03b1-CD@DTAD, \u03b2-CD@DTAD, and \u03b3-CD@DTAD complexes. Compared to DTAD, these CD/DTAD complexes show much stronger self-assembly ability with much lower critical aggregation concentrations (CAC) and form more diverse aggregates with reduced zeta potential. Just above their CACs, the CD/DTAD complexes form vesicles or solid spherical aggregates of \u223c50 nm and then transform into small micelles of \u223c10 nm as the concentration increases. The strong self-assembly ability and the multiple sites of hydrogen bonds of the CD/DTAD complexes endow them with high antibacterial activity against E. coli, showing a very low minimum inhibitory concentration (2.22-2.48 \u03bcM) comparable to that of DTAD. In particular, the addition of CDs significantly reduces the abilities of DTAD in solubilizing zein (a skin model protein) and in binding with zein, and the mildness decreases in the order of 2\u03b1-CD@DTAD > \u03b2-CD@DTAD > \u03b3-CD@DTAD > \u03b1-CD@DTAD. This tendency depends on their different self-assembling structures, and the formation of vesicles is approved to be in favor of the improvement of the mildness.",

As a proof of concept, the commercially available antibacterial cationic polymer, e-poly-l-lysine hydrochloride, was chosen for the demonstration. Using host\u2013guest chemistry, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), a water-soluble macrocyclic host, was employed to bind with the positive charge and hydrophobic component on e-poly-l-lysine hydrochlorides for antibacterial regulation. In this way, by tuning the ratio of CB[7] to the cationic polymer, the antibacterial polypseudorotaxane can be obtained, and the antibacterial efficiency can be well tuned from 5% to 100%. This line of research will enrich the field of cationic polymers and polypseudorotaxanes with important functions on precise control over antibacterial activity.",

        "abstract": "To take advantage of the excellent optical properties of conjugated polymers (CPs) or conjugated oligomers (COs) for biological applications, there is still a requirement to find new ways to deliver these conjugated molecular materials into cells in a facile, controllable and noninvasive manner. Herein, a photoactive oligo(p-phenylene vinylene) (OPV) derivative was covalently attached with phospholipid units (OPV-lipid) to enhance its dispersion in water and facilitate its internalization by cells. OPV-lipid could be delivered into either cell membrane or cytoplasm controllably through the assistance of liposomes with different formulas. It could also act as fluorescent probe for cell imaging and visualization of the delivery process. This work shows a good potential for delivering functional conjugated molecular materials into cells in a controllable way.",

Therefore, they have reached the limit of the unique functionalities as a whole. Different from other escaping strategies, we introduced the polarity exchanging approach to rigid-backboned conjugated polymer for controlled penetrating through endosome or lysosome membranes. With the aid of pH-sensitive cleavage of water-soluble side chain, the rigid conjugated polymer turns highly hydrophobic after it is internalized into lysosomes and then accomplishes escaping. Thus, polarity exchange of CPs could become a new strategy for their application on chemotherapeutics.",

To this end, a water-soluble bifunctional monomer bearing two naphthalene moieties and a phenylbenzene moiety, as well as a small molecule with antibacterial activity were synthesized. The side-chain antibacterial supramolecular polymer was fabricated through self-sorting of the bifunctional monomer, the small-molecule antibacterial agent, and cucurbit[8]uril. It displayed enhanced antibacterial efficacy against ampicillin-resistant E. coli owing to the local enrichment effect. The controlled degradation of the antibacterial supramolecular polymer could well regulate its antibacterial performance from high to low activity. It is anticipated that this line of research may lead to novel antibacterial supramolecular materials for building degradable antibiotics with enhanced antibacterial efficacy to fight against drug-resistant bacteria.",

A recent study revealed that the A946T polymorphism (rs1990760) in interferon induced helicase (IFIH1) gene was a susceptible locus for GD. A case-control study in a Chinese population was undertaken, with 261 GD patients and 206 healthy subjects, to analyze the association of A946T polymorphism in IFIH1 gene with GD. In addition, the distribution of IFIH1 genotypes was investigated in subgroups according to the onset age and the Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO). No significant differences in the allele and genotype frequencies for A946T polymorphism were found between GD patients and healthy controls (chi2 = 2.834, P = 0.242; chi2 = 1.127, P = 0.288). The genotype-phenotype correlation was not identified either. Therefore we were unable to find the association of A946T polymorphism of the IFIH1 gene with the development of GD in a Chinese population.",

The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) is believed to be critically involved in the pathogenesis of GD. This study aims to elucidate the effect of IL-12A gene polymorphisms on GD.A case-control association study of five tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs2243115, rs2243123, rs583911, rs568408 and rs2243143) within the IL-12A gene was performed in two independent Chinese cohorts. A pilot cohort conducted in Shanghai consisted of 701 patients and 686 controls and a replicate cohort in Xiamen Island included 378 patients and 312 controls. The five SNPs were genotyped by the SNPstream Genotyping Systems and Taqman PCR method.Polymorphism of rs568408, located at the 3'-UTR region, was found to have a significant association with GD in both the cohorts (P(allele) = 2\u00b796 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 and P(allele) = 0\u00b7013 for Shanghai and Xiamen Island cohorts, respectively). Haplotype analysis showed that the haplotype of the five SNPs (TTAAG) was associated with a significant risk of GD in both the cohorts (OR = 2\u00b704 and OR = 1\u00b770 for Shanghai and Xiamen Island cohorts, respectively).Our results have established an association between IL-12A polymorphism and GD susceptibility in the Chinese population.",

Recently association of IL-16 gene polymorphisms with autoimmune diseases had been reported. However, there was little known about the impact of IL-16 gene polymorphisms on GD. In this study, we performed a case-control association study of three tagSNPs (rs4778889-rs1131445-rs4778641) within the IL-16 gene on 258 patients with GD and 208 healthy subjects in the Chinese population. Our data showed that common IL-16 variants were associated with GD (P=0.013-0.0186) and Graves' disease associated ophthalmopathy (GO) (P=0.0033-0.041). A novel protective haplotype containing the three tagSNPs (C-T-C) was observed in association with GO (P=0.013). In conclusion, IL-16 gene was significantly associated with susceptibility to Graves' disease and Graves' disease associated ophthalmopathy in the Chinese population.",

        "abstract": "Steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3/AIB1/ACTR/NCoA-3) is a transcriptional coactivator for nuclear receptors including vitamin D receptor (VDR). Growth hormone (GH) regulates insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) expression, and IGF-I forms complexes with acid-labile subunit (ALS) and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) to maintain its circulating concentration and endocrine function. This study demonstrated that the circulating IGF-I was significantly reduced in SRC-3(-/-) mice with the C57BL/6J background. However, SRC-3 deficiency affected neither GH nor ALS expression. The low IGF-I level in SRC-3(-/-) mice was not due to the failure of IGF-I mRNA and protein synthesis but was a consequence of rapid degradation. The rapid IGF-I degradation was associated with drastically reduced IGFBP-3 levels. Because IGF-I and IGFBP-3 stabilize each other, SRC-3(-/-) mice were crossbred with the liver-specific transthyretin (TTR)-IGF-I transgenic mice to assess the relationship between reduced IGF-I and IGFBP-3. In SRC-3(-/-)/TTR-IGF-I mice, the IGF-I level was significantly increased over that in SRC-3(-/-) mice, but the IGFBP-3 level failed to increase proportionally, indicating that the low IGFBP-3 level is a responsible factor that limits the IGF-I level in SRC-3(-/-) mice. Furthermore, IGFBP-3 mRNA was reduced in SRC-3(-/-) mice. The IGFBP-3 promoter activity induced by vitamin D, through VDR, was diminished in SRC-3(-/-) cells, suggesting an important role of SRC-3 in VDR-mediated transactivation of the IGFBP-3 gene. In agreement with the role of SRC-3 in VDR function, the expression of several VDR target genes was also reduced in SRC-3(-/-) mice. Therefore, SRC-3 maintains IGF-I in the circulation through enhancing VDR-regulated IGFBP-3 expression.",

        "abstract": "Amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1; steroid receptor coactivator-3, p/CIP, RAC3, ACTR, TRAM-1, or NCoA-3) is a transcriptional coactivator for nuclear receptors and certain other transcription factors and is a newly defined oncogene overexpressed in human breast cancer. Although the role and molecular mechanism of AIB1 in normal physiology and in breast cancer are currently under intensive investigation, the role of AIB1 in determination of the susceptibility of mammary gland to chemical carcinogens remains uncharacterized. In this study, we used back-crossed FVB wild-type (WT) and AIB1 mutant mice to assess the role of AIB1 in mammary gland development and in carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis. We show that mammary ductal growth was delayed in AIB1-/- mice with FVB strain background, and mammary ductal outgrowths emanating from the AIB1-/- mammary epithelial transplants in WT mice also were attenuated, indicating that the role of AIB1 in mammary ductal growth is a mammary epithelial autonomous function. In mice treated with the chemical carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), AIB1 deficiency protected the mammary gland, but not the skin, from tumorigenesis. AIB1 deficiency suppressed the up-regulation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 and thereby inhibited the activation of Akt, expression of cyclin D1, and cell proliferation. The suppression of these components for insulin-like growth factor-I signaling might be partially responsible for the decreased DMBA-induced mammary tumor initiation and progression in AIB1-/- mice. Our results suggest that AIB1 may serve as a potential target for prevention of carcinogen-induced breast cancer initiation and for treatment of breast cancer progression.",

        "abstract": "Hepatic fibrosis, a disease characterized by altered accumulation of extracellular matrix, can cause cirrhosis and liver failure. There is growing interest in the impact of co-activators on hepatic fibrogenesis. Here, we provided genetic evidence that mice lacking steroid receptor co-activator-3 (SRC-3) were protected against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced acute liver necrosis and chronic hepatic fibrosis. After acute CCl4 treatment, SRC-3(-/-) mice showed attenuated profibrotic response and hepatocyte apoptosis, whereas hepatocyte proliferation was elevated in SRC-3(-/-) mice versus SRC-3+/+ mice. Similarly, chronically CCl4-treated SRC-3(-/-) mice showed significant weakening of inflammatory infiltrates, hepatic stellate cell activation and collagen accumulation in the liver compared with SRC-3+/+ mice. Further investigation revealed that TGFbeta1/Smad signaling pathway was impaired in the absence of SRC-3. Moreover, the expression levels of SRC-3, as assessed in human tissue microarray of liver diseases, correlated positively with degrees of fibrosis. These data revealed that SRC-3(-/-) mice were resistant to CCl4-induced acute and chronic hepatic damage and TGFbeta1/Smad signaling was suppressed in the lack of SRC-3. Our results established an essential involvement of SRC-3 in liver fibrogenesis, which might provide new clues to the future treatment of hepatic fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is caused by autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in the RET proto-oncogene, which includes multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A), type 2B (MEN 2B), and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). In this paper we present the phenotype-genotype correlation of 20 unrelated Chinese families with 15 cases of MEN2A and five cases of MEN2B.Cross-sectional study.A total of 147 members from the 20 families were included. Among them, 119 family members were from MEN2A pedigrees (including 15 MEN2A probands) and 28 members from MEN2B pedigrees (including five MEN2B probands).Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leucocytes and was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). DNA analysis for RET mutations in exons 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 was performed with specific primers.Thirty-seven MEN2A and five MEN2B patients were identified as having RET mutations. The incidence of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma (PCC) and hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in the 37 MEN2A patients was 91.9, 56.8 and 10.8%, respectively; the onset of MTC in MEN2A patients was earlier than that of PCC and HPT. Five germline mutations, all located at codon 634 of exon11 in the RET proto-oncogene, were detected in all of the 37 MEN2A patients. The highest frequency of the five germline mutations was C634Y (46.7%), followed by C634R (26.7%), C634W (13.3%), C634F (6.7%) and C634S (6.7%). No statistical significance was found between the incidence of PCC and different genotypes of codon 634 in MEN2A patients, whereas the incidence of HPT was closely associated with C634R and C634Y. The gene mutation (M918T) at exon16 of the RET proto-oncogene was present in five MEN2B probands.RET proto-oncogene mutations were restricted to codon 634 and 918 in Chinese families with MEN2A and MEN2B. In general the genetic characteristics of these patients with MEN2A and MEN2B reflect the general pattern around the world and it remains to be determined with larger studies in China whether Chinese patients have a different genetic pattern of mutations.",

        "abstract": "Interferon alpha (IFNalpha) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of different autoimmune diseases. IFNalpha is widely used for the treatment of chronic viral infections, particularly chronic hepatitis C virus infection; however, several case reports have emerged describing autoimmune conditions, such as Graves' disease (GD), that have developed in the patients receiving IFNalpha. The mechanism by which IFNalpha is involved in GD remains poorly understood. We investigated the expression of IFNalpha and IFNalpha-inducible genes (IFIGs) in GD and found that IFIGs were overexpressed in 60% of 54 clinical diagnostic GD patients. These elevated IFIGs correlated with serological levels of autoantibody to thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). Recombinant human IFNalpha stimulated primary cultured thyrocytes resulted in not only high level expression of IFIGs, but also, more importantly, expression of MHC-II antigens (HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR5) and TSHR in GD subjects. Furthermore, thyroid gland tissues from GD patients over express HLA-DR, TSHR and IFNalpha receptors at both messenger RNA and protein levels. Taken together, these data indicated that in GD patients, IFNalpha can function on thyroid tissue to induce a number of genes, particularly MHC class II molecules which may enhance autoantigen presentation of TSHR on thyrocytes.",

        "abstract": "Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) is a transcriptional coactivator for nuclear receptors and other transcription factors. Although multiple physiological roles of SRC-3 have been revealed, its involvement in the inflammatory process remains unclear. Herein we show that SRC-3(-/-) mice are markedly hypersensitive to LPS-induced endotoxic shock. In response to LPS, SRC-3(-/-) macrophages produce significantly more proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta than wild-type controls, although they express similar amounts of cytokine mRNAs, suggesting that SRC-3 can exert effects at translational levels. Increased heavy polysome-associated TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNAs in SRC-3(-/-) macrophages implicate SRC-3 as a translational repressor. SRC-3 may cooperate with other translational repressors such as TIA-1 and TIAR to regulate cytokine mRNA translation. Collectively, our studies reveal an essential function of SRC-3 as a coordinator of inflammatory mRNA translation and as a physiologic protective factor against the lethal endotoxic shock triggered by an acute inflammatory response.",

We generated Ngn3KO mice (ablation of  an essential component of mTORC1 in Ngn3 endocrine progenitor cells), and found that mTORC1 was dispensable for endocrine cell lineage formation, but specifically regulated both proliferation and identity maintenance of neonatal \u03b2 cells. Ablation of  in neonatal \u03b2 cells led to autonomous loss of cell identity, decelerated cell cycle progression, compromised proliferation and caused neonatal diabetes due to inadequate establishment of functional \u03b2 cell mass at P14. Completely different from mature \u03b2 cells,  regulated G1/S and G2/M phase cell cycle transition, thus permitting high proliferation rate in neonatal \u03b2 cells. Moreover, Ezh2 was identified as a critical downstream target of mTORC1 in neonatal \u03b2 cells, which was responsible for G2/M phase transition and proliferation. Our discovery of the dual effect of mTORC1 in immature \u03b2 cells revealed potential target for replenishing functional \u03b2 cell pools by promoting both expansion and functional maturation of newly-formed immature \u03b2 cells.",

Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is an important cytokine involved in innate and adaptive immune responses. This case-control study sought to investigate genetic association between the IL-17A gene and the process of Graves' disease (GD).Our pilot study was performed on a cohort from Shanghai, which included 713 patients with GD and 756 healthy controls. A replicate cohort was from Xiamen, recruiting 444 patients with GD and 427 healthy subjects. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs4711998, rs3819024, rs2275913, rs8193037, rs3819025 and rs3748067) within the IL-17A gene were genotyped by the SNPstream Genotyping Systems and Taqman PCR method.In Shanghai cohorts, the frequencies of rs8193037 alleles were strongly different between patients with Graves' disease (G, 87\u00b76% and A, 12\u00b74%) and healthy controls (G, 91\u00b74% and A, 8\u00b76%) (P = 0\u00b700067). The A carriers were associated with increased Graves' disease risks when compared with the G carriers (OR = 1\u00b751, 95%CI = 1\u00b719-1\u00b792). In replicate cohorts, the proportion of individuals carrying the A allele of rs8193037 was significantly higher in patients with Graves' disease than in controls [Graves' disease vs control, 14\u00b73% vs 9\u00b71%, OR = 1\u00b766 (95% CI: 1\u00b723-2\u00b724), Pallele  = 0\u00b70082]. In addition, rs8193037 and rs3748067 were found to be different in both genotype and allele distributions in Graves' disease-associated ophthalmopathy patients and controls in Shanghai cohorts. Haplotype association analysis also identified five main haplotypes of those six SNPs.These results suggested that the polymorphism of IL-17A rs8193037 was strongly associated with Graves' disease susceptibility in the Chinese Han population.z.",

        "abstract": "Two independent Chinese cohorts were used to study the genetic association between the interleukin-23A (IL-23A) gene polymorphism (rs11171806) and susceptibility to Graves' disease (GD). The initial Shanghai cohort consisted of 712 unrelated patients with GD and 705 healthy control subjects, and the replication cohort from Xiamen Island included 433 patients with GD and 410 healthy control subjects. The serum concentration of IL-23 in GD patients was measured significantly higher than in health controls. Moreover in the subgroup analysis, higher concentrations of IL-23 were identified in patients of older age (\u2a7e40 years) and female gender. We also performed an association study with the IL-23 gene polymorphism rs11171806 in both cohorts, in Shanghai cohorts, the frequencies of rs11171806 alleles were strongly different between Graves' disease patients (G 95.7% and A 4.3%) and healthy controls (G 97.7% and A 2.3%) (P=2.6\u00d710(-3), OR=1.93 (95% CI: 1.25-2.97)), and in Xiamen cohorts, the proportion of individuals carrying the A allele of rs11171806 was the same significantly higher in Graves' disease patients than in controls [Graves' disease vs. control, 4.8% vs. 4.3%, OR=2.15 (95% CI: 1.23-3.79), P(allele)=6.3\u00d710(-3)]. The distribution of rs11171806 genotype was also investigated in subgroups according to the age and gender.

The study aims to determine whether abnormal IDO and TTS activities in autoreactive T, B and dendritic cells (DCs) lead to tryptophan metabolism disorder, inducing the immune imbalance in patients with Graves' disease (GD). The concentrations of serum kynurenine and tryptophan and the mRNA expressions of IDO and TTS were analyzed, and the mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) was employed to assess the interaction of IDO-expressing DCs and TTS-expressing CD4(+) T cells. Compared with healthy donors (HD), the ratio of serum kynurenine to tryptophan (P < 0.0001) was increased in GD patients, which was associated with the increased IDO expression in B cells (P < 0.01) and DCs (P < 0.01). GD-derived CD4(+) T cells enhanced TTS expression (P < 0.01), and its proliferation was not inhibited in the presence of IDO-expressing DCs from the GD patients. In contrast, the proliferation of HD-derived CD4(+) T cells with low TTS expression was inhibited. Increased TTS expression from CD4(+) T cells resists IDO-mediated immunosuppression from DCs, which might link to a pathogenic mechanism involved in autoreactive T cells being sustained in vivo in GD patients.",

Mice deficient in steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) are shown to be protected against high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity but little is known about whether visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) distribute differently in SRC-3(-/-) mice versus SRC-3(+/+) mice. Here we reported that under HFD, fat redistributed between VAT and subcutaneous area of SRC-3(-/-) mice. When VAT/SCAT weight ratio (VAT/SCAT ratio) was calculated, SRC-3(-/-) mice had significantly elevated VAT/SCAT ratio in HFD versus normal diet (ND), while VAT/SCAT ratio was similar in SRC-3(+/+) mice under ND and HFD. Serological changes in SRC-3(-/-) mice paralleled the altered fat distribution. In SRC-3(-/-) mice, assays on gene expression revealed an increase in adipogenesis in VAT versus SCAT and an elevation in thermogenesis and lipolysis in SCAT versus VAT, which could explain the preferential fat accumulation in SRC-3(-/-) VAT. Our results presented in vivo evidence that SRC-3 deficiency could lead to fat redistribution under HFD in mice and provided new clues to researches on the pathogenesis of fat redistribution.",

        "abstract": "For patients with active moderate-to-severe Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO), a course of 4.5 g iv glucocorticoids (GCs) is the recommended therapy. The weekly protocol is preferred because of the potential safety concerns with the daily protocol. However, evidence for the superiority of different administration protocols is lacking.We conducted a prospective, randomized trial to compare the efficacy and safety of two protocols of iv 4.5 g methylprednisolone in a total of 80 patients in our institute. The patients were randomized to receive iv methylprednisolone weekly or daily. The response rate (a composite response endpoint including lid width, soft tissue involvement, proptosis, intraocular pressure, Clinical Activity Score [CAS], diplopia, and visual acuity) was evaluated as the primary outcome, and adverse effects were recorded at each visit. GO-associated serum cytokines were measured.We found a significantly greater response rate for the weekly protocol vs the daily protocol at the 12th week (76.92 vs 41.03%; P = .0025) and a similar response rate at the fourth week. Seven patients on the daily protocol worsened when tapering iv methylprednisolone to oral prednisone in the fourth week. Patients in both groups showed significant CAS response, and at the 12th week, patients on the weekly protocol showed a nonsignificant trend toward greater CAS response. Weekly protocol showed significant prolonged retreatment-free survival. Severe side effects were only observed in two cases, both of which were on the daily protocol. Furthermore, we observed sustained decreased levels of serum CXCL10 in the 12th week compared to the baseline level (P = .0009) in the patients on the weekly protocol.The weekly protocol of iv methylprednisolone therapy is more efficient and safer than the daily protocol for patients with active moderate-to-severe GO.",

Age at the time of diagnosis was (31.0 +/- 12.2)years in the successful group and (36.3 +/- 14.0) years in the failure group. Free T3 (FT3) was (25.60 +/- 9.52) pmol/L and (19.16 +/- 6.38) pmol/L in the failure and the successful group (P = 0.001). FT3 to FT4 ratio and thyrotrophin receptor antibody (TRAb) levels were higher in the failure group (P = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that thyroid size, FT3 to FT4 ratio and TRAb at the time of diagnosis were associated with failure outcome. The patients reached euthyroid state at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months respectively and in the failure group the patients with continued thyrotropin suppression were more than those in the successful group (P = 0.001).Graves disease patients with large thyroid size, high levels of TRAb and FT3 to FT4 ratio before drug treatment are more likely to fail to respond to antithyroid drug treatment. We also found that patients with continuing thyrotropin suppression and attainment of euthyroid state in the course of treatment had low remission rate and prolonged therapy.",

        "abstract": "Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) has been demonstrated to regulate lipid metabolism by inhibiting adipocyte differentiation. In this study, the potential role of SRC-3 in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which characterized by inflammatory demyelination in central nervous system (CNS), was examined by analyzing disease progression in SRC-3-deficient (SRC-3(-/-)) mice. We found that SRC-3 deficiency significantly attenuated the disease severity of EAE along with decreased inflammatory infiltration and demyelination. However, these effects are not caused by inhibition of peripheral T cell response, but by upregulated expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-beta in CNS, which induced an alternative activation state of microglia in SRC-3(-/-) mice. These alternatively activated microglia inhibited CNS inflammation through inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL10, as well as upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and opsonins, such as C1qa and C1qb. Moreover, microglia alternative activation promoted myelin regeneration through increased accumulation of oligodendrocyte precursors in white matter and elevated expression of myelin genes in the spinal cords of SRC-3(-/-) mice. Our results build up a link between lipid metabolic regulation and immune functions, and the modulation of the expression of SRC-3 or PPAR-beta may hopefully has therapeutic modality in MS and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a sensitive and highly reproducible technique of gene expression analysis. However, for accurate and reliable gene expression results, it is vital to have an internal control gene expressed at constant levels under all the experimental conditions being analyzed for. In this study, the authors validated candidate reference genes suitable for qRT-PCR profiling experiments using livers from control mice and high fat diet-induced obese mice. Cross-validation of expression stability of ten selected reference genes using three popular algorithms, GeNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper found HPRT1 and GAPDH as most stable reference genes. Thus, HPRT1 and GAPDH are recommended as stable reference genes most suitable for gene expression studies in the development of hepatic steatosis.",

        "abstract": "Glucocorticoid (GC) insensitivity occurs commonly in Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO), and GC therapy is associated with major adverse effects. A reliable and easily accessible biomarker is required to predict the outcome of GC therapy. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of circulating microRNA (miRNA) to predict GC insensitivity in GO patients. A total of 35 consecutive patients were included in this study. A cumulative dose of 4.5 g of methylprednisolone (MP) was administered intravenously for 12 weeks. Pretreatment serum miRNAs from the best- (N = 5) and worst- (N = 4) responding patients were profiled using miScript PCR arrays and validated by quantitative PCR in all patients. We calculated the predictive value of pretreatment assays of serum miRNAs with regard to GC insensitivity. We further investigated the roles of target miRNAs in modulating NF-\u03baB activity and restoring transrepression of an NF-\u03baB reporter by dexamethasone. Nine miRNAs displayed significant differences between responsive and resistant patients by miScript PCR arrays. Validation of the top two miRNAs in all 35 patients confirmed a significantly lower serum level of miR-224-5p (p = 0.0048) in resistant patients. A multivariate logistic regression model identified a composite biomarker combining baseline serum miR-224-5p and TRAb was independently associated with GC response (OR: 2.565, 95 % CI 1.011-6.505, p = 0.047). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis revealed the composite marker combining miR-224-5p and TRAb led to a 91.67 % positive prediction value (PPV) and a 69.56 % negative prediction value (NPV) with regard to GC resistance. Overexpression of miR-224-5p restored transrepression of the NF-\u03baB reporter by dexamethasone under induced resistance, which may be via targeting GSK-3\u03b2 to increase GR protein level. Our study demonstrated baseline serum miR-224-5p was associated with GC sensitivity in GO and in vitro overexpression of miR-224-5p restored GC sensitivity in a resistant cell model. A parameter combined serum miR-224-5p and TRAb could effectively predict GC sensitivity in GO patients.",

        "abstract": "Objective: A promising radiopharmaceutical 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC (99mTc-HYNIC-Octreotide) can be applied for somatostatin receptor scintigraphy with the potential to replace Indium-111 labeled somatostatin analogus. Here we evaluate whether orbital 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy can be used as a Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) activity parameter to predict the retrobulbar irradiation response. Methods: Orbital 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy was performed on 14 consecutive patients demonstrating moderated to severe Graves' ophthalmopathy. The patients were treated with retrobulbar irradiation following the octreoscan and the response to this therapy was assessed at 3 months after the start of treatment. The orbital 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC uptake was calculated to assess the effects of treatment. Results: Among the 14 GO patients, eight (57.1%) responded to retrobulbar radiotherapy; six (42.9%) showed no change. We compared the eight responders and six non-responders in terms of orbital 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC uptake, using the orbital/occipital ratio. On the 4-h 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy, responders had a higher orbital/occipital uptake ratio than the no-responders (P = 0.001). A significant correlation was found between the orbital/occipital ratio and the clinical activity score (CAS) (P = 0.034). The Receiving-Operator-Characteristic curve showed the best threshold for discriminating active and inactive disease was 1.40 (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 83.3%). In the responders group, all these eight patients had positive scintigraphy. While there were five patients who had negative scintigraphy in the non-responders group. Conclusion: Orbital 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy can be a useful method for the estimation of disease activity and prediction the response to subsequent radiotherapy in GO patient. And the patients with positive octreoscan were more likely to respond to irradiation. \u00a9 Humana Press Inc. 2007.",

        "abstract": "Graves' disease (GD) is a common autoimmune disease involved autoantibody production. Although we previously reported that osteopontin (OPN), a proinflammatory protein, affected development of GD through NF-\u03baB activation, little is known about the role of OPN in regulating immunoglobulin production in GD. CD40 Ligand (CD40L) is expressed on the surface of activated CD4+T cells and costimulates CD40 on B cells, stimulating production of immunoglobulins, a process which has been reported to play a vital role in immunological signalling transduction in several autoimmune diseases. This study sought to characterize the relationship between CD40L and GD development, as well as investigating the role of OPN in modulating immunoglobulin production in GD via CD40L.Forty incident patients with GD, twenty-one patients with GD in remission and twenty-seven healthy controls were recruited. Both membrane-bound and soluble forms of CD40L were measured, and their correlations with clinical parameters were studied. In addition, correlation between OPN and CD40L level was also examined. Furthermore, we studied the regulatory effect of OPN on CD40L in CD4+T cells.We demonstrated that the CD40L levels were enhanced in patients with GD and recovered in patients with GD in remission. CD40L levels correlated with clinical GD diagnostic parameters and OPN concentration. Moreover, human recombinant OPN and plasma samples from patients with GD increased CD40L expression, which could be significantly suppressed by OPN monoclonal antibody. In addition, CD40L antibody blocked the immunoglobulin production augmented by OPN in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), isolated from patients with GD and healthy subjects.These results indicate that CD40L is induced by OPN and serves as the downstream effector of OPN for immunoglobulin production in GD development.",

Compared with healthy donors (HD), the ratio of serum kynurenine to tryptophan (P\u00a0P\u00a0P\u00a0+ T cells enhanced TTS expression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and its proliferation was not inhibited in the presence of IDO-expressing DCs from the GD patients.

Increased TTS expression from CD4+ T cells resists IDO-mediated immunosuppression from DCs, which might link to a pathogenic mechanism involved in autoreactive\n T cells being sustained in vivo in GD patients.",

Many studies have reported that interleukin-8 (IL-8), a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, is associated with many autoimmune diseases and could increase the degree of lymphocyte infiltration within the thyroid gland. The aim of the present study is to elucidate whether IL-8 is associated with the development of GD and GO. The serum concentration of IL-8 was tested in 39 primary GD patients, 43 treated active GO patients, and 24 healthy controls. We also performed an association study with the IL-8 gene polymorphism rs2227306 between 642 patients and 648 healthy controls in Chinese population. Our data showed that the expression level of IL-8 was associated with the development of GD, and the C-allele frequency of SNP rs2227306 was significantly higher in GD and GO patients compared with healthy controls. These results suggest that IL-8 is strongly associated with GD and GD.",

        "abstract": "Graves' disease (GD) is a chronic autoimmune process characterized by the production of auto-antibodies that presumably consequent to the lymphocytic infiltrates in the thyroid. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 21 (CCL21) is important for the circulation of CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7)-expressing cells. Meanwhile, osteopontin (OPN) enhances the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines through NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways in GD. Although CCL21 has been reported to play a vital role in several autoimmune diseases, little is known about the relationship between CCL21 and GD development. This study aimed to detect the CCL21 level in GD and to examine the role of OPN in regulating CCL21 production. 40 initial GD patients, 15 euthyroid GD patients, 12 TRAb-negative GD patients, and 25 healthy control donors were recruited. CCL21 levels in plasma and culture supernatants were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). CD4+ T cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using antibody-coated magnetic beads. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine CCL21 expression levels in CD4+ T cells. We demonstrated for the first time that plasma CCL21 levels were overexpressed in GD patients and recovered in TRAb-negative GD patients. Moreover, CCL21 levels correlated with TRAb levels and plasma OPN concentrations. Furthermore, we demonstrated that recombinant OPN increased the expression of CCL21 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These data indicated a clinical correlation between plasma CCL21 levels and GD. CCL21 could serve as a novel biomarker for GD as well as a potential target for TRAb-positive GD treatment.",

        "abstract": "Excess dietary fat can cause hepatic steatosis, which can progress into severe liver disorders including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3), a member of the p160 coactivator family, is reported as a key regulator of adipogenesis and energy homeostasis. We sought to determine the influence of SRC-3 on hepatic steatosis and the mechanism beneath.The influence of siRNA-mediated SRC-3 silencing on hepatic lipid accumulation was assessed in HepG2 cells. The molecular mechanism of SRC-3 regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism was also studied. Moreover, the effect of SRC-3 ablation on hepatic steatosis was examined in SRC-3 deficient mice.In this study, we report that SRC-3 ablation reduces palmitic acid-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Moreover, deletion of SRC-3 ameliorates hepatic steatosis and inflammation response in mice fed a high fat diet (HFD). These metabolic improvements can presumably be explained by the reduction in chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) expression and the subsequent elevation in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) level. At the molecular level, SRC-3 interacts with retinoic receptor \u03b1 (RAR\u03b1) to activate COUP-TFII expression under all-trans retinoic acid (ARTA) treatment.These findings indicate a crucial role for SRC-3 in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism and provide the possible novel inner mechanisms.",

In addition, the coexpression of several OPN receptors as well as various nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) downstream target genes were examined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from human subjects. The effect of OPN on NF-\u03baB activation was determined by in vitro assays.We demonstrated for the first time that the OPN levels are enhanced in serum from GD patients. OPN levels are strongly associated with clinical serum parameters for GD diagnosis. The coexpression of selective OPN receptors and inflammatory response genes was enhanced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from GD patients. Furthermore, serum from GD patients activated NF-\u03baB activity in vitro, which was significantly suppressed by OPN monoclonal antibody abrogation.These data indicated a clinical correlation between serum OPN levels and GD. OPN could affect GD development through NF-\u03baB activation and the subsequent changes in inflammatory milieu.

We compared the\n eight responders and six non-responders in terms of orbital 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC uptake, using the orbital/occipital ratio. On the 4-h 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy, responders had a higher orbital/occipital uptake ratio than the no-responders (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). A significant correlation was found between the orbital/occipital ratio and the clinical activity score (CAS) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.034).

        "abstract": "Graves' disease (GD) is a common autoimmune disease involving the thyroid gland. The altered balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines plays an important role in the pathogenesis of GD. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20) is important for interleukin-17 (IL-17) signal activation and a potent chemoattractant for Th17 cells. Meanwhile, Osteopontin (OPN), a broadly expressed pleiotropic cytokine, has been implicated in GD through inducing Th1-involved response to enhance the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, but little is known about the role of OPN in regulating CCL20 and IL-17 signaling.This study sought to explore the possibility of CCL20 level as a biomarker for GD, as well as investigate the role of OPN in regulating CCL20 production.Fifty untreated GD patients, fifteen euthyroid GD patients, twelve TRAb-negative GD patients and thirty-five healthy control donors were recruited. OPN, CCL20 and other clinical GD diagnosis parameters were measured. CD4+T cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using antibody-coated magnetic beads. Enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to determine CCL20 expression level.We found that the plasma CCL20 level was enhanced in GD patients and decreased in euthyroid and TRAb-negative GD patients. In addition, CCL20 level correlated with GD clinical diagnostic parameters and plasma OPN level. Moreover, we demonstrated that recombinant OPN and plasma from untreated GD patients increased the expression of CCL20 in CD4+T cells, which could be blocked by OPN antibody. Furthermore, we found that the effect of OPN on CCL20 expression was mediated by \u03b23 integrin receptor, IL-17, NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways.These results demonstrated that CCL20 might serve as a biomarker for GD and suggested the possible role of OPN in induction of CCL20 expression.",

        "abstract": "Graves' disease (GD) is an autoimmune disorder with genetic predisposition. There is strong evidence that members of the selectin family participate in the interaction between leucocytes and the endothelium, as well as in inflammatory cell recruitment. Moreover, a high serum level of a soluble form of L-selectin (SL-selectin) has been reported in untreated GD patients. However, the impact of L-selectin polymorphisms on GD has not yet been investigated. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether L-selectin gene polymorphisms were associated with the development of GD.L-selectin gene polymorphisms were investigated in 230 Chinese GD patients and 208 healthy control subjects without antithyroid autoantibodies or a family history of autoimmune disorders. Two L-selectin SNPs were genotyped by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.A C/T polymorphism at position -642 of the promoter region and a Pro213Ser (c.725 C-T) polymorphism in exon 6 were examined using PCR-RFLP. There was a significant increase in -642T allele frequency in GD patients compared with healthy controls (70 vs. 62%; P = 0.0126; P(c) = 0.0252). The frequency of the c.725C allele in exon 6 also appeared higher in GD patients than in controls. Haplotype analysis showed a significant decrease in the -642C/c.725T haplotype in GD patients (26 vs. 34%; P = 0.0095; Pc = 0.0190). However there was no association between polymorphisms and certain GD clinical phenotypes, including age of onset and ophthalmopathy.L-selectin gene polymorphisms are associated with GD susceptibility in Chinese patients.",

Here we evaluate whether orbital (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy can be used as a Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) activity parameter to predict the retrobulbar irradiation response.Orbital (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy was performed on 14 consecutive patients demonstrating moderated to severe Graves' ophthalmopathy. The patients were treated with retrobulbar irradiation following the octreoscan and the response to this therapy was assessed at 3 months after the start of treatment. The orbital (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC uptake was calculated to assess the effects of treatment.Among the 14 GO patients, eight (57.1%) responded to retrobulbar radiotherapy; six (42.9%) showed no change. We compared the eight responders and six non-responders in terms of orbital (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC uptake, using the orbital/occipital ratio. On the 4-h (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy, responders had a higher orbital/occipital uptake ratio than the no-responders (P = 0.001). A significant correlation was found between the orbital/occipital ratio and the clinical activity score (CAS) (P = 0.034). The Receiving-Operator-Characteristic curve showed the best threshold for discriminating active and inactive disease was 1.40 (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 83.3%). In the responders group, all these eight patients had positive scintigraphy. While there were five patients who had negative scintigraphy in the non-responders group.Orbital (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy can be a useful method for the estimation of disease activity and prediction the response to subsequent radiotherapy in GO patient. And the patients with positive octreoscan were more likely to respond to irradiation.",

Ophthalmopathy occurred simultaneously with the development of hyperthyroidism or followed it 18.8 months later in the majority of the patients. (2) Upper eyelid retraction was the commonest sign of the lids. 120 cases complained of double vision. 89 had eye movement restriction, especially to upper direction. Mean extent of proptosis was 17.9 mm. 14.5% had high intraocular pressure. The extraocular muscles involvement was characteristically bilateral and multiple. The inferior rectus was the most frequently involved with enlargement. (3) Only 19.2% cases received corticosteroids, retrobulbar irradiation or surgery because of the severity of ocular symptoms and signs.TAO way occur with the development of hyperthyroidism simultaneously or follow it later. The disease has its own clinical characteristics and natural course. Making accurate diagnosis earlier is essential for instituting treatment and predicting prognosis.",

As a new class of modulators of gene expression, microRNA (miRNA) have been reported to play a vital role in immune functions and in the development of autoimmunity and autoimmune disease.This study sought to characterize the different miRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from GD patients and healthy individuals and examine their direct responses to T(3) treatment.Forty-one patients who met criteria for initial GD, 13 GD patients in remission, and 35 healthy controls were recruited. Microarray was used to analyze the expression patterns of miRNA in PBMC obtained from initial GD patients and healthy controls. Three top-ranked miRNA were selected and validated by TaqMan-based real-time PCR in healthy controls, initial GD patients, and GD patients in remission. Furthermore, we cultured PBMC from healthy donors with or without T(3) treatment to examine direct effects of T(3) on selective miRNA.There were sixteen miRNA expressed differently in PBMC from initial GD patients compared with normal subjects. Further analysis consistently showed that the expression of miR-154*, miR-376b, and miR-431* were suppressed in PBMC from initial GD patients. In addition, their expression levels were recovered in GD patients in remission. Meanwhile, T(3) treatment could directly inhibit the expression of these miRNA in cultured PBMC from healthy subjects.The present work revealed that differentially expressed miRNA were associated with GD and T(3) exposure, which might serve as novel biomarkers of GD and potential targets for GD treatment.",

Furthermore the distribution of ICAM-1 genotypes was investigated in subgroups of patients with GD according to the onset age and the ophthalmopathy.No G241R polymorphism of ICAM-1 gene was detected in Chinese. No significant differences of allele and genotype frequencies regarding K469E polymorphism were found between GD patients and healthy controls (chi2 = 0.092, P = 0.762; chi2 = 1.089, P = 0.580). In addition, the genotype-phenotype correlation was not identified either.We found no association of G241R and K469E polymorphisms of the ICAM-1gene with the development of GD in a Chinese population. However, we could not rule out possible contributions of other polymorphisms of the ICAM-1gene to the pathogenesis of GD. Therefore, further studies are needed to elucidate the role of ICAM-1gene in Graves' disease in different population.",

The study aims to determine whether abnormal IDO and TTS activities in autoreactive T, B and dendritic cells (DCs) lead to tryptophan metabolism disorder, inducing the immune imbalance in patients with Graves\u2019 disease (GD). The concentrations of serum kynurenine and tryptophan and the mRNA expressions of IDO and TTS were analyzed, and the mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) was employed to assess the interaction of IDO-expressing DCs and TTS-expressing CD4+ T cells. Compared with healthy donors (HD), the ratio of serum kynurenine to tryptophan (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) was increased in GD patients, which was associated with the increased IDO expression in B cells (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and DCs (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). GD-derived CD4+ T cells enhanced TTS expression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and its proliferation was not inhibited in the presence of IDO-expressing DCs from the GD patients. In contrast, the proliferation of HD-derived CD4+ T cells with low TTS expression was inhibited. Increased TTS expression from CD4+ T cells resists IDO-mediated immunosuppression from DCs, which might link to a pathogenic mechanism involved in autoreactive T cells being sustained in vivo in GD patients.",

        "abstract": "Background  Previous studies have shown that smoking is closely related to the occurrence, severity and response to orbital radiation in Graves\u2019 ophthalmopathy (GO). The aim of this study was to investigate whether smoking impacts the response to intravenous 4.5\u2005g methylprednisolone therapy in patients with active moderate-to-severe GO.  Methods  Ninety-two individuals with active moderate-to-severe GO who were treated with cumulative doses of 4.5\u2005g intravenous methylprednisolone within 3\u2005months were recruited. The patients were grouped as never smokers, active smokers (including smokers and quit smokers) and passive smokers.  Results  We observed significantly greater response rate in never smokers compared with active smokers (73.9% vs 29.0%, p=0.001). After adjusting the confounding factors such as age, sex, body mass index, clinical activity score, thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody and the duration of GO, smoking was independently associated with poor intravenous glucocorticoid (GC) response (OR 12.40, 95% CI 1.20 to 128.14, p=0.035). We also found the response rate was significantly higher in never smokers than in quit smokers (73.9% vs 16.7%, p=0.001), while no statistical significance between current smokers and quit smokers (36.8% vs 16.7%, p=0.228). There was a trend of poor response for passive smokers compared with never smokers (64.7% vs 72.2%, p=0.583).  Conclusions  Smoking, even past smoking, was an independent risk factor associated with impaired response to intravenous corticosteroids in patients with GO. Smokers with GO should be given optimised treatment strategy such as higher dose of GC or combined radiation therapy.",

A distributed anomaly-based intrusion detection algorithm was also proposed, Local IDS (intrusion detection systems) were attached to each node of the WSN, which were responsible for collecting raw data of network operation, and computing a local anomaly index, measuring the difference between the current node operation and normal operation. In this hierarchical system, node-level and cluster-level anomaly index were fused, producing cluster-level and network-level anomaly index respectively. The fusion algorithm was described mathematically and deduced theoretically. For performance evaluation, the ROC (receiver operating characteristics) curves in simulation,for operations at the nodes, cluster heads and managers,was adopted. The overall results confirm the effectiveness of the architecture and algorithm described in the paper. Research shows that the fusion algorithm can greatly improve system's probability of detection.",

        "abstract": "Many range-free localization algorithms estimate the distance in between two nodes based on the hop-count information, which, however, is a coarse proximity measure. Recently, the regulated neighborhood distance (RND) has been proposed as a new proximity measure, and can greatly improve the localization accuracy, compared with those hop-count-based algorithms. However, the RND algorithm and most previous hop-based approaches are based on the disk communication model, and cannot be directly applied into the practical world with some general radio propagation model. In this paper, we revisit the RND-based localization with a general propagation model, where the received transmission power is modeled as a random variable and its expectation is a nonincreasing function of the distance between a transmitter and receiver pair. In particular, we define the neighborhood based on the packet reception ratio (PRR), and propose an optimal PRR threshold selection algorithm to adaptively adjust the RND-based distance estimation. We verify the effectiveness of the adaptive RND-based localization for the log-normal shadowing model and a polynomial fitting model from our field experiments. Simulation results show that the adaptive selection of the best PRR threshold helps to improve localization accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive RND-based localization can achieve higher localization accuracy, compared with the classical DV-hop localization with the same network configurations.",

However, existing measurement matrices suffer from high computational burden because of their completely unstructured nature. In this study, the authors propose to construct a novel measurement matrix with a specific structure, called sparse block circulant matrix (SBCM), to reduce the computational burden.

The simulation results validate that SBCM reduces the computational burden significantly whereas keeps similar signal recovery accuracy as Gaussian random matrices.",

In our previous work [Acta Phys. Sin. 61 174301 (2012)], an analytical model to predict the sound absorption from vibrational relaxation in a gas medium is proposed. In this paper, we develop the model to decouple the V\u2013V coupled energy to each vibrational\u2013 translational deexcitation path, and analyze how the multimode relaxations form the peaks of sound absorption spectra in gas mixtures. We prove that a multimode relaxation is the sum of its decoupled single-relaxation processes, and only the decoupled process with a significant isochoric-molar-heat can be observed as an absorption peak. The decoupling model clarifies the essential processes behind the peaks in spectra arising from the multimode relaxations in multi-component gas mixtures. The simulation validates the proposed decoupling model.",

We present and evaluate a methodology for low-cost robust location. Our approach uses an Inverse RSSI Weighting (IRW) algorithm that requires only simple RSSI measurement during the receiving of the packages. Because that such measurement is necessary for demodulation and decoding the information, the approach based on IRW is not require additional equipments on sensors. We tested our localization algorithm in two fading environments: tile walk area and wooded area. Comparing to three most popular localization algorithms, the IRW algorithm can alleviate the negative impact of noisy ranging measurement and is robust over the deep fading scenarios.",

        "abstract": "With increasingly smaller size, more powerful sensing capabilities and higher level of autonomy, multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can form UAV networks to collaboratively complete missions more reliably, efficiently and economically. While UAV networks are promising for many applications, there are many outstanding issues to be resolved before large scale UAV networks are practically used. In this paper we study the application of cognitive radio technology for UAV communication networks, to provide high capacity and reliable communication with opportunistic and timely spectrum access. Compressive sensing is applied in the cognitive radio to boost the performance of spectrum sensing. However, the performance of existing compressive spectrum sensing schemes is constrained with non-strictly sparse spectrum. In addition, the reconstruction process applied in existing schemes has unnecessarily high computational complexity and low energy efficiency. We proposed a new compressive signal processing algorithm, called Iterative Compressive Filtering, to improve the UAV network communication performance. The key idea is using orthogonal projection as a bandstop filter in compressive domain. The components of primary users (PUs) in the recognized subchannels are adaptively eliminated in compressive domain, which can directly update the measurement for further detection of other active users. Experiment results showed increased efficiency of the proposed algorithm over existing compressive spectrum sensing algorithms. The proposed algorithm achieved higher detection probability in identifying the occupied subchannels under the condition of non-strictly sparse spectrum with large computational complexity reduction, which can provide strong support of reliable and timely communication for UAV networks.",

        "abstract": "Spectrum sensing is a key functional part for cognitive radio networks. In heterogeneous networks, the mobility of cognitive nodes will lead to changes in the received signal strength and noise power, which make it difficult for cognitive users to achieve optimal sensing performance at all times using traditional spectrum sensing methods with fixed thresholds. To solve this problem, an adaptive threshold scheme is proposed in this paper. The Steepest Descent Algorithm (SDA) is used to adjust thresholds of all cooperative nodes and the optimal data fusion rule is adopted in the control center to decrease the average Bayesian risk. No prior information of primary signals, channel fading and noise power is needed and the optimal sensing performance is achieved by applying the proposed scheme. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method can quickly converge to optimal sensing parameters in spatial temporal varying environment.",

It is the basic relaxation process, which arises from the translational-vibrational degree of freedom (V-T) and the molecular energy transfer between different vibrational degrees of freedom (V-V) separately. By studying the molecule energy transition model of the basic acoustic relaxation processes of gas, we propose an analytic model reflecting the correspondence between effective specific heat capacity and relaxation time in this paper. Compared with the existing relaxation model, the analytic model provides the corresponding relationship between the vibrational specific heat capacity and the relaxation time in V-T and V-V. The solution procedure of the analytic model illustrates that the higher vibrational energy level is the determinant of the basic relaxation process. The effective heat capacity is the foundation of acoustic relaxation attenuation spectrum of gas. The relaxation attenuation spectra result from the analytic model in this paper, which is modified by fine-tuning the collision diameter of the gas molecule, are more consistent with the experiment data than with the existing theoretical value. It proves the correctness and validity of the analytic model. \u00a9 2012 Chinese Physical Society.",

Based on the ring model of energy consumption,according to the detection radius of the sensor nodes,it gives two strategies named coverage-first and connectivity-first for the node deployment. Theoretical calculations and simulation experiments show that the distribution of the node deployment can guarantee effectively the coverage and connectivity,under the premise of making energy load evenly distributed in all nodes.

Many existing connectivity- or hop-count-based range-free localization methods suffer from the hop-distance ambiguity problem where a node has a same distance estimation to all of its one-hop neighbors. In this paper, we define a new measure, called regulated neighborhood distance (RND), to address this problem by relating the proximity of two neighbors to their neighbor partitions. Furthermore, we propose a new RND-based range-free localization method, and compare our localization algorithm with peer classical algorithms in different network scenarios, which include grid deployment, random uniform deployment, non-uniform deployment and uniform deployment with a coverage hole. Simulation results show that ours can achieve better and reliable localization accuracy in these network scenarios.",

In this paper, a trend-duration and trend-gradient detector is proposed for automatic fire detection. The detector can distinguish fire signals from noise using a trend-duration algorithm. The fire smoke density (if smoke sensors are used) can be determined with the gradient algorithm. In order to indicate the level of the smoke density, fuzzy logic is applied to the gradient determination.",

Further, it proposes a market-based adaptive task scheduling algorithm, named MATS, which schedules tasks to the set of optimal nodes by adjusting the energy price of nodes and modifying the nodes' roles. The simulation in the scenario of target tracking demonstrates that MATS is adaptable to the changing network conditions and realizes an efficient allocation of energy resources by regulating the energy consumption of nodes. Compared with the static scheduling algorithm, MATS impressively promotes the energy efficiency at the trivial cost of tracking accuracy. \u00a9 2006 IEEE.",

And a theoretical predictive model of acoustic attenuation was developed, which is independent of experiential parameters. The acoustic attenuation spectra of various multi-component gas mixtures, consisting of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane and water, were estimated by the DSMC method. The sound frequency range of interest is from 8 MHz to 232 MHz. Compared with the result of the relaxation attenuation based on the DL model plus that of the classical attenuation calculated by the Stokes-Kirchhoff formula, the estimations of acoustic attenuation of our model agreed with them. The precision of the model depends upon the knowledge of the physical mechanism of molecule collision from which the attenuation arises. In addition, the result of our model shows that the characters of the frequency-dependent acoustic attenuation rely on the composition of the gas mixtures. And this could lead to the development of smart acoustic gas sensors capable of quantitatively determining gas composition in various environments and processes.",

        "abstract": "Cooperation can improve the performance of spectrum sensing. However, the sensing overhead is generally increasing with the number of cooperating users as more data needs to be reported to the fusion center. Most existing works assume a general time frame structure in which spectrum observing and sensing results reporting are conducted sequentially. We argue that this frame structure is inefficient, since the time consumed by reporting contributes little to the performance of spectrum sensing. In this paper, we propose a pipelined spectrum sensing framework, in which spectrum observing is conducted concurrently with results reporting in a pipelined way. By making use of the reporting time for sensing, the new framework provides a much wider observing window for spectrum measurement, which results in a performance improvement of spectrum sensing. Besides, we also present a multi-threaded sequential probability ratio test method (MTSPRT) which is very suitable for the pipelined framework as the data fusion technique. The MTSPRT method can improve the sensing speed significantly. Numerical results indicate that our pipelined sensing scheme incorporating with MTSPRT shows a better performance than the cooperative sensing based on the general frame structure.",

        "abstract": "Rate Compatible Modulation (RCM) has been shown to be capable of achieving smooth rate adaptive transmission in highly dynamic channel scenarios. In this paper, the capacity of RCM is analyzed for different channel conditions, and an important result is obtained, i.e., in low-to-middle signal to noise ratio (SNR), the same achievable capacity in RCMs may be obtained for different weight sets being used. Based on this result, instead of employing fixed-weight sets with large values or big cardinalities for all channel conditions as in conventional RCM, a novel RCM scheme with variable weight sets (RCM-VWS) is proposed by employing different weight sets for different SNR ranges such that the demodulation complexity can be significantly reduced. In RCM-VWS, the SNR value of the received signal is divided into five unoverlapped ranges, which are estimated and encoded into 3-bit information at the receiver. This 3-bit information is delivered back to the transmitter for weight set selection when the SNR value of the received signal changes from one range to another or for some transmission interval. Thus, the cost of the feedback load is trivial in practice. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that compared with conventional RCM with fixed weight sets, the computational complexity of RCM-VWS can be reduced by as much as 97% at SNR u003c 6 dB and 90% at 6 dB u003c SNR u003c 9 dB while maintaining the same transmission rate. In addition, the proposed scheme achieves a better BER performance than the conventional RCM.",

Cooperative spectrum sensing is regarded as the most promising method to improve the reliability of spectrum sensing. However, such cooperation also introduces overhead traffic of control signaling and result transmission which consumes more power in battery operated mobile terminals. In this paper, an RLECSS (Run-length Encoding based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing) scheme is proposed. We focus on how to reduce the transmission power consumption in cooperative spectrum sensing. The run-length encoding (RLE) technique is adopted to send local decisions and only informative local decisions are reported to the common receiver.

And the effective relaxation time of gas can be estimated by two approaches, which are base on SSH theory and experimental data, respectively. The acoustic attenuation spectra of various polyatomic gas mixtures, consisting of nitrogen, methane, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water, were estimated by the reconstruction algorithm. The sound frequency rang of interest is from 1 Hz to 10 GHz. Comparing with the results of the relaxation attenuation based on the DL model, the estimations of relaxation attenuation of the reconstruction algorithm agreed with the latter. The precision of the reconstruction algorithm depends upon the knowledge of the physical mechanism of molecular relaxation processes. In addition, the reconstruction algorithm was applied to quantitatively determining the concentrations of water and carbon dioxide in some polyatomic gas mixtures. The results show that the relaxation attenuation can be used as a quantitative probe of the composition of polyatomic gas mixtures. And this could lead to the development of smart acoustic gas sensors capable of determining the precise compositions of gas mixtures.",

The concept of variable-width channels is recently proposed to overcome these drawbacks. To investigate the problem of the non-overlapping variable-width channel allocation for selfish access points (APs) in a WLAN, we model it as a non-cooperative game. we aim to investigate two fundamental issues on it in this paper: 1) Are there some fair and system-optimal Nash equilibrium (NE) allocations? 2) How to achieve one of these desirable allocations if they exist? At first, the existence of fair and system-optimal Nash equilibria in this game is proved. Then, a simple protocol to achieve one of these desirable NE allocations is proposed. Considering the implementation issues, a punishment-based method and a transfer-based self-enforcing truth-telling method are proposed for single-stage and multi-stage game scenarios respectively. The numerical results show the effectiveness of our approaches.",

And the blind source separation algorithm is explained to be feasible in mixed DSSS signal parameters estimation. Then the basic model of blind source separation and an effective algorithm called bias-removal fast independent component analysis (FASTICA) are given. An algorithm framework for blind sources separation-DSS is derived, and that classical ICA algorithms can be unified into this framework is proven.

Finally, a weighted-based location estimate strategy is utilized, which is independent of the complex optimize computation. The extensive simulation study shows that the proposed algorithm is self-adaptive, distributed, scalable and robust.

It has been shown that sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) is a promising data fusion technique for cooperative spectrum sensing. However, most exiting works assume that the primary spectrum status stays unchanged during the cooperative sensing process. We argue that, in reality, the spectrum state can vary at anytime during one round of cooperative sensing, and this kind of spectrum variation could cause severe distortion to the performance of SPRT. In this paper,we propose a novel cooperative sensing scheme to cop with this problem. In the proposed scheme, we introduce a multi-process mechanism into the traditional SPRT technique, which can effectively deal with the variation of spectrum within a sensing process. Besides, we also study the design tradeoff issue in our scheme. Simulation results show that our multi-process SPRT scheme can improve the response speed to spectrum status variation and show a better performance in cooperative spectrum sensing. \u00a9 2010 IEEE.",

Owing to inherent anti-aliasing feature of NUS with the random variation in time interval, larger array aperture is available without spatio-temporal ambiguity, which enhances the resolution and estimation accuracy. In addition, the proposed approach is computational efficiency as it needs only 1-D search and no extraneous methods for matching DOA and frequency. Simulation results, furthermore, show that the proposed algorithm is an effective way for far-field sources angle-frequency estimation and capable of improving the estimation performance, especially at low SNR regions.",

        "abstract": "Spectrum sensing is an essential function for cognitive radio systems. Based on the observation that signal samples usually are correlated due to various reasons, such as oversampling, multipath propagation and correlation among raw signals, a correlation-based detection method is proposed to differentiate signals from noise in this paper. Sensing performance of the proposed method is analyzed theoretically when primary signals are fully correlated. Its complexity is compared with that of energy detection and threshold setting is discussed under an estimated false alarm probability. However, the algorithm is inferior to energy detection in sensing performance when signal samples are uncorrelated. To overcome this disadvantage, an adaptive detection model is developed. Simulations based on captured ATSC DTV signals and analog PAL TV signals are presented to verify the performance of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Cooperation can improve the performance of spectrum sensing by taking advantage of diversity gains. However, in the process of cooperative spectrum sensing, malicious users could send false local sensing results to the fusion center, which can cause severe distortion to the final sensing decision. To improve the immunity of cooperative spectrum sensing against false sensing information, we propose a robust cooperative spectrum sensing scheme which is based on weighted sequential probability ratio test (WSPRT) technology. Through reputation maintenance, weight allocation and multi-threaded detection, the proposed scheme can effectively deal with different kinds of attack patterns. Simulation results show that our robust scheme can identify and weed out malicious users accurately and efficiently.",

Moreover purchasing spectrum rights with millions or billions of dollars is unreasonable under an emphasis on low-cost to WSN. Thus an alternate method based on the concept of Cognitive Radio is explored to capture spectrum for WSN. A cooperative energy detection technique is introduced. The probabilities of detection of proposed technique are evaluated over some classical fading channels. The quantization case is also considered for practicality. The simulation results show that the quantization case exhibits almost comparable performance with the optimum Neyman-Pearson detector, while it has much less overhead.",

The user-centric allocation approach aims to maximize the revenues of individual SUs and the system-centric allocation approach attempts to maximize the system revenue. In this paper, we focus on the joint user-centric and system-centric allocation approach and aim to investigate two fundamental issues below: 1) Is there an allocation profile which maximizes the revenues of the SU sand the system? 2) How to achieve this desirable allocation if it exists? We use the game theory approach to investigate these issues. We model the problem of the channel allocation as an ordinal potential game and prove the existence of the desirable allocation profile. Furthermore, we propose a simple protocol to achieve it. Finally, considering the practical issues, we propose a self-enforcing truth-telling method and a Best Response Based algorithm which uses only local information.",

        "abstract": "A new approach is proposed for resolving the direction ambiguity by using twice virtual array transformation, which makes use of the nonuniform time delay to generate virtual transformation matrix.Due to the random variation in time interval of nonuniform time delay,the transformation based on nonuniform time delay matrix is equivalent to altering the relative distance between sensors.This means that the plane wave impinges a virtual uniform linear array with a time-varying array element interval.Therefore,a larger array aperture is available without anglular ambiguity,which enhances resolution and accuracy of the direction-of-arrival(DOA) estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is effective for DOA estimation,and capable of improving estimation performance at low SNR.",

        "abstract": "To identify the correlation between sound propagation and molecular multimode vibrational relaxation in polyatomic gas mixture, an analytical model that constructs acoustic multi-relaxation spectrum is presented. The frequency-dependent effective specific heat of gas is formulated from the micro view of vibrational mode energy transfer as well as the macro view of relaxation process due to vibrational-vibrational mode energy coupling. With the aid of the general relaxation equations of multimode vibrational energy transfer, the analytical expressions to calculate acoustic relaxation absorption and dispersion, which reflect both primary and secondary relaxation processes, are developed from the effective specific heat. The constructed absorption spectra of various gas mixtures, consisting of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen, and oxygen, accord with the experimental data very well. Especially, the peak errors of those results are less than 1%. Moreover, the simulation results illustrate that less than two single processes with higher strength appear generally in a multi-relaxation absorption spectrum. Compared with the existing models, the analytical model can directly obtain the analytical expressions of characteristic points in the relaxation spectrum of gas mixtures, which makes it advantageous to analyze the spectral characteristics qualitatively and quantitatively. Consequently, the model provides an effective approach to analyzing the relationship between sound propagation and molecular vibrational relaxation of gas mixtures. \u00a92012 Chinese Physical Society.",

When the referenced beacon nodes are collinear or almost collinear, however, an evident localization error would be brought out even if the range measurement error is small.As for this condition, the concept of collinearity is introduced. The location estimation executes only if the collinearity of the referenced beacon nodes is larger than a threshold.

A simplified expression for fading parameter m integer is derived based on moment generating function method.

However, it was shown by recent studies that DFH suffered from an inherent serious drawback that the frequency transition matrix may be intercepted by any third-party receiver and this would decline the anti-jamming performance of DFH. The root of this drawback is the poor 2-dimensional (2D) continuity of DFH sequence. Theoretical analysis of 2D continuity performance of DFH sequence is performed in this paper and it is proved that DFH sequence using single G function (GF) generated with most GF construction methods may not have favorable 2D continuity performance. A simple but convenient method, time varying G Function (TVG) method, is put forward to improve 2D continuity performance of DFH sequence. Optimization of TVG method is performed and optimization criterion of GF sequence is deduced. Simulation results verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of this method. \u00a9 2008 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "A key enabling functionality in implementing Cognitive Radio is to reliably detect the licensed users. In recent literature, cooperation among spectrum sensing terminals is suggested to offer reliable sensing performance. We consider the problem that the presence of malfunctioning or malicious sensing terminals will severely degrade the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing. In this paper, we extend the Weighted Sequential Probability Ratio Test (WSPRT) by replacing the binary local report with N-bits local report to achieve a better detection performance. Additionally, three types of reputation rating evaluation schemes are introduced: neutral, punitive and heavy punitive. Simulation results show that the extended WSPRT technique improves detection performance. Moreover, the extended WSPRT with heavy punitive scheme is shown to be the most robust against the malfunctioning or malicious sensing terminals.",

In this paper we focus on the routing problem in energy-constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs), of which a cooperative MISO-based routing strategy is adopted. We first analyze the physical layer energy consumption model of cooperative transmission in the scenarios of one hop and hop-to-hop for energy-efficient routing in order to prolong the network lifetime. Based on this analysis, we disclose how the energy-efficient network routing problem is tightly related to the inter-cluster MISO node and hop-to-hop relay node selection. As we noticed, the problem of energyefficient cooperative routing is NP-hard innately which is difficult to implement in a totally distributive approach. Due to these analysis, a feasible algorithm with minimum cost is thus proposed. In the simulation part, we prove that our protocol can prolong the network lifetime tremendously when choose appropriate transmission parameters. Moreover, as an example, we simulate a typical network scenario which indicates our protocol is more energy efficient when comparing with vMIMO scheme in our previous work.",

This system can achieves smooth rate adjustment under highly dynamic channel conditions. However, for fast implementation, the convolution in the horizontal processing and the vertical processing required lots of multipliers in RCM demodulation algorithm using Belief Propagation(BP), which beyond the current hardware.

        "abstract": "Rate Compatible Modulation (RCM) had been shown to be capable of achieving smooth rate adjustment in highly dynamic channel scenarios. However, there still exist two main problems in RCM: (1) The theoretical bound of the achievable rate, which is the benchmark for practical RCM design, has not been obtained. (2) The iterative decoding algorithm for RCM have a high computational complexity due to the long weight set with large value and the much more symbols required by receiver for successful decoding under poor channel conditions. To tackle these problems, Firstly, we get the theoretical achievable rate upper bound of RCM via analysis of the mutual information between transmitted and received symbols, and obtain an important result, i.e., in low SNR, the achievable rates of RCM are completely the same for the cases of large or small weight sets. Based on this result, a low-complexity RCM with variable weight sets (RCM-VWS) is proposed. In addition, we investigate the messages relationship between symbol nodes and information nodes in decoding algorithm based on Bayesian interference and analyze the computational complexity of the RCM-VWS we proposed. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that, in low SNR (<;8dB), the computational complexity of the proposed scheme can be reduced by 95% compared with that of the conventional RCM, while preserving the same BER performance. So the average decoding efficiency is improved significantly.",

At the same time, the accuracy and validity of fire detection is greatly weakened by reason of increasing uncertainty of fire signal. Therefore a new approach is presented for the detection of uncertainty fire signal based on fire scenario, which its algorithm in the detection of one-dimension fire space is given in order to show the proposed method having fine fault-tolerance, robustness and accuracy. In this method, a certain character of fire space fractal in the detected fire space is obtained firstly by a performance analysis of fire scenario, and then a character of signal space fractal is acquired by using intelligent method based on rough set theory and trend fusion to process the multi-source signal detected from a group of fire detectors, when a logical coincident relationship between the two characters recognized, a real fire alarm is produced lastly",

        "abstract": "Spectrum sensing is an essential functionality of cognitive radio networks (CRN). Among existing spectrum sensing methods, cooperative spectrum sensing is the best one which can achieve superior sensing performance by introducing spatial diversity of sensing data sources. Such cooperation also introduces additional information exchanging which leads to extra power consumption and reporting delay. In this paper, the optimal sensing performance problem is formulated as a nonlinear binary integer programming problem to find suitable cooperative nodes minimizing the average detection Bayesian risk. The binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm is adopted to obtain suboptimal solutions to cooperative nodes. Computer simulations show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the sensing performance compared with the case that all neighboring nodes participate in sensing without discrimination under different scenarios.",

Here we present an algorithm to capture the primary relaxation processes by only measuring the sound absorption and sound speed of two operating frequencies at a single pressure, without the necessity of detecting the gas density. This algorithm is developed from the fact that the frequency-dependent sound absorption curve due to a single-relaxation process can be reconstructed from the two values of the relaxation frequency and the maximum relaxational absorption, and they can be synthesized by the acoustic measurements at two frequencies. Moreover, by acquiring the high-frequency sound speed, those two synthesized values can be used to reconstruct the sound dispersion curve. The simulations demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm and its robustness against errors of acoustic measurements. \u00a9 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The channel outputs are sampled on nonuniform sampling sets, and an analysis of the decorrelation based on nonuniform sampling (NUS) is investigated. It is demonstrated that MUSIC algorithm with NUS of various array elements may be capable of selecting the signal of interesting including the coherent group. NUS in the time domain is equivalent to alter the relative distance between sensors and leads to the radiant sources impinging the different arrays between two snapshots just as a virtual array spatial smoothing preprocessing. Simulations are conducted to verify that MUSIC based on nonuniformity of sensor sampling is effective to estimate direction-of-arrival (DOA) of incident signals in the coherent environment. Simultaneously, it's beneficial to greatly improve the estimation accuracy and angular resolution as a result of larger array aperture introduced but no angle-measure ambiguity and offer a better performance in lower SNR than weighted spatial smoothing (WSS) with MUSIC algorithm.",

In this paper, we study the connectivity of Wireless Sensor Networks from a network self-localization prospective. To the best of our knowledge, theoretic analyses of the network connectivity for node self-localization have not been previously studied in the networking literature. Assuming a spatial Poisson distribution of network nodes, we modeled the network as random graph and derived an analytical expression that allows the determination of the localizable probability of any an unknown node for given network density \u03c1. The problems have also been investigated by simulation in various scenarios. Our results are of practical value for designing sensor network considering of node self-localization. \u00a9 2005 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Link adaptation (LA) plays an important role in adapting an IEEE 802.11 network to wireless link conditions and maximizing its capacity. However, there is a lack of theoretic analysis of IEEE 802.11 LA algorithms. In this article, we propose a Markov chain model for an 802.11 LA algorithm (ONOE algorithm), aiming to identify the problems and finding the space of improvement for LA algorithms. We systematically model the impacts of frame corruption and collision on IEEE 802.11 network performance. The proposed analytic model was verified by computer simulations. With the analytic model, it can be observed that ONOE algorithm performance is highly dependent on the initial bit rate and parameter configurations. The algorithm may perform badly even under light channel congestion, and thus, ONOE algorithm parameters should be configured carefully to ensure a satisfactory system performance.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Sound relaxational absorption spectroscopy of excitable gas mixtures is potentially applied for gas composition detection. The relaxation of vibrational modes of gas molecules determines the sound relaxational absorption. However, to our knowledge, the contribution of each vibrational mode available in gas mixtures to sound multi-relaxation absorption has not been calculated in existing literature. In this paper, based on the decoupled expression of the effective isochoric molar heat for a gas mixture, a sound multi-relaxation absorption spectrum is decomposed into the sum of single-relaxation spectra. From this decomposable characteristic, the contribution of each vibrational mode available in the gaseous medium to the multi-relaxation absorption is obtained at room temperature. For various gas compositions including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen etc., the calculated contributions of vibrational modes are verified by the comparison with experiment data. We prove the following views with quantifiable outcomes that the primary molecular relaxation process associated with the lowest mode plays the major role in acoustic relaxational absorption of gas mixtures; the mode with lower vibrational frequency provides higher contribution to the primary relaxation process. This work could provide a deeper insight into the relationship between the sound relaxational absorption spectroscopy and gas molecules.",

In this paper, the ESH of the molecular relaxation process of a gas mixture is decomposed to obtain the relaxation contributions of the individual gas components. The decomposed ESHs obtained by the proposed method have the same complex-plane curves as the ESHs of the corresponding pure gases; thus, the ESH curve of the mixture can be obtained by the sum of the ESH curves of the corresponding pure gases. This conclusion not only provides a theoretical foundation for the existing gas sensing method based on acoustic spectral peaks, but can also be used to identify gas components in mixtures. The connecting lines of the minimum points of the ESH curves were used to quantitatively detect carbon dioxide and methane in dry air, and to monitor contaminant gases in natural gas.",

In this paper, we design an optical fire smoke detector with consistent response to white smokes and black smokes based on dual-wavelength technology and multiple scattering signals. The proposed detector utilizes the incident lights of dual wavelengths to measure the surface area concentration and volume concentration of fire smokes respectively. The particle size distribution of the smokes can be estimated by these concentrations. The refractive indices are deduced by the third scattering signal and more observing angles are helpful to reduce the measurement errors. As a result, a 4-channel detector [140\u00b0\u2013950\u00a0nm, 45\u00b0\u2013950\u00a0nm, 140\u00b0\u2013450\u00a0nm, 45\u00b0\u2013450\u00a0nm] is developed, which can accurately measure the concentrations of both smoldering cotton (white smoke) and open fire of polyurethane (black smoke).",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Existing fire smoke detectors utilize the intensity of scattering light as the indicator of fire smokes to trigger fire alarms, but a false fire alarm would be triggered by non-fire aerosols due to their similar concentration characteristics. According to the measurement results of our experiments and related works, the Sauter mean diameters of fire smokes are usually smaller than those of non-fire aerosols. Instead of the smoke concentration detector, a new type of Sauter mean diameter sensor is developed based on dual wavelength technology for fire detection. In order to measure the aerosol samples with different particle size distribution and refractive indices, an extra correction channel is added to reduce the measurement error from 39.1% to 7.61%. The sensor is calibrated by the DEHS (Di-Ethyl-Hexyl-Sebacat) aerosols in different sizes and tested by several typical fire smokes and non-fire aerosols, the results show that the sensor can timely trigger a fire alarm to fire smokes and avoid the false alarm caused by non-fire aerosols. With simple mechanical structure and high accuracy, this sensor improves the performance of optical fire smoke detector with high sensitivity, low-cost and unique ability to resist the false alarms caused by non-fire aerosols.",

In this paper, we present a reconstructive method based on the novel decomposition of frequency-dependent acoustic relaxation spectra to capture the entire molecular multimode relaxation process. This decomposition of acoustic relaxation spectra is developed from the frequency-dependent effective specific heat, indicating that a multi-relaxation process is the sum of the interior single-relaxation processes. Based on this decomposition, we can reconstruct the entire multi-relaxation process by capturing the relaxation times and relaxation strengths of N interior single-relaxation processes, using the measurements of acoustic absorption and sound speed at 2N frequencies. Experimental data for the gas mixtures CO2\u2013N2 and CO2\u2013O2 validate our decomposition and reconstruction approach.",

The proposed algorithm doesn't require the number of signals is smaller the number of sensors, and is computational efficiency as it doesn't need eigendecomposition and spectrum peak search. Simulation results, furthermore, show that the correct estimation probability of the proposed algorithm is approximately 80%, and root mean square error (RMSE) of DOA estimation is less than 0.9 degree even if signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low only -5dB because of the array aperture extension capability based on fourth-order cumulant. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.",

However, existing optical sensors with a single wavelength source cannot measure these two concentrations accurately. In this paper, we design a sensor to measure these two concentrations with dual wavelength sources, based on the phenomenon that the surface area concentration and the volume concentration of aerosols are proportional to the scattering intensity of the different wavelength incident lights. The prototype sensor is tested by monodisperse aerosols with particle sizes ranging from 200\u00a0nm to 2000\u00a0nm. The standard measurement deviations of the surface area concentration, volume concentration and Sauter mean diameter are 11.6%, 21.9% and 9.4%, respectively, which are better than the results of sensors with a single wavelength source. Moreover, the Sauter mean diameter of fire smokes measured by our sensor are consistent with calibration instruments, which is helpful to resist false alarm in fire detection. With simple mechanical structure and high accuracy, this sensor is promising in fire detection and atmosphere environment monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that chrysophanol protects against learning and memory impairments in lead-exposed adult mice. In the present study, we investigated whether chrysophanol can alleviate learning and memory dysfunction and hippocampal neuronal injury in lead-exposed neonatal mice. At the end of lactation, chrysophanol (0.1, 1.0, 10.0 mg/kg) was administered to the neonatal mice by intraperitoneal injection for 15 days. Chrysophanol significantly alleviated injury to hippocampal neurons and improved learning and memory abilities in the lead-poisoned neonatal mice. Chrysophanol also significantly decreased lead content in blood, brain, heart, spleen, liver and kidney in the lead-exposed neonatal mice. The levels of malondialdehyde in the brain, liver and kidney were significantly reduced, and superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities were significantly increased after chrysophanol treatment. Collectively, these findings indicate that chrysophanol can significantly reduce damage to hippocampal neurons in lead-exposed neonatal mice.",

Because both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are forms of ischemic vascular disease, they are closely related. We hypothesized that rutaecarpine also has neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury. A cerebral ischemia reperfusion model was established after 84, 252 and 504 \u03bcg/kg carpine were given to mice via intraperitoneal injection, daily for 7 days. Results of the step through test, 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride dyeing and oxidative stress indicators showed that rutaecarpine could improve learning and memory ability, neurological symptoms and reduce infarction volume and cerebral water content in mice with cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury. Rutaecarpine could significantly decrease the malondialdehyde content and increase the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in mouse brain. Therefore, rutaecarpine could improve neurological function following injury induced by cerebral ischemia reperfusion, and the mechanism of this improvement may be associated with oxidative stress. These results verify that rutaecarpine has neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia reperfusion in mice.",

        "abstract": "Rutaecarpine (Rut) is a type of indole quinazoline alkaloid exracted from Ruticarpum. Studies showed that Rut has a wide range of pharmacological effects, such as anti-hypertension, anticancer, anti-inflammation, anti-thrombus formation. Currently, many scholars are committed to developing it into a new antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory drug with all new mechanisms. But studies found that Rut is a highly fat-soluble drug with low water and oil solubility. Its high insolubility is the main obstacle in its oral absorption and application, which greatly reduced its bioavailability. Therefore, hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) was used as the inclusion material to prepare Rut-HP-beta-CD inclusion complex in this experiment, in order to increase its water solubility and bioavailability. In this experiment, the inclusion complex was prepared by the stirring-freeze-dry method. The preparation process was optimized by the orthogonal test, with the inclusion rate as the index, and molar ratio between host and guest molecules, inclusion temperature, time and stirring speed as the impacting factors. Moreover, the inclusion complex was verified by detecting the apparent solubility, thin layer chromatography, microscopic identification, melting point detection and dissolution study. The results showed that under the conditions of the molar ratio between Rut and HP-beta-CD of 1: 1, temperature at 60 degrees C, inclusion time of 4h and stirring speed at 600 r x min(-1), the inclusion rate of Rut-HP-beta-CD reached 91.04%. Therefore, the preparation process of Rut-HP-beta-CD inclusion under the optimum conditions is simple and feasible, with a highest inclusion rate and reproducibility, and could significantly improve Rut's solubility and bioavailability, and provide a reliable experimental basis for its clinical application.",

        "abstract": "Aim: To investigate the effects of chrysophanol (Chry) on memory impairment in mice induced by lead acetate and discuss its possible mechanisms. Methods: Mice, except control group were administered 7 mg\u00b7kg -1 lead acetate by peritoneal injection every day for 8 days to establish the lead poisoning model. Chry was ip injected for 14 days. The abilities of learning and memory were examined by step through test and Morris water maze test. Antioxidant enzyme levels (GSH-Px, SOD) and lipid peroxidation products (MDA) were performed by UV spectrophotometry scenery. The contents of nitrogen monoxidum (NO), nitricoxide synthase (NOS) in brain tissue were examined. Results: Lead acetate could induce the disorder of space learning and memory, and it could also increase the lead levels of mouse blood and brain, the content of NO and MDA, and the activities of NOS and iNOS of brain. Additionally, lead acetate could decrease the activities of SOD and GSH-Px of mouse brain. Chry could improve the learning and memory impairment and decrease the lead levels in blood and brain. Chry (0.1 mg\u00b7kg -1) could decrease the activities of NOS and iNOS in mouse brain (P < 0.05), There was no significant influence on content of NO, while Chry (10.0, 1.0 mg\u00b7kg -1) could decrease the content of NO and the activities of NOS and iNOS in mouse brain (P < 0.01). Chry (0.1 mg\u00b7kg -1) could increase the activities of SOD and GSH-Px in mice brain (P < 0.01). There was no significant effect on content of MDA, while Chry (10.0, 1.0 mg\u00b7kg -1) could decrease the content of MDA and increase the activities of SOD and GSH-Px in mice brain (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Chry can significantly improve the impairment of learning and memory and antioxidant defense system of mice induced by lead acetate, and apparently inhibit lipid peroxidation.",

        "abstract": "Iodine antiseptics exhibit superior antimicrobial efficacy and do not cause acquired microbial resistance. However, they are underused in comparison with antibiotics in infection treatments, partly because of their adverse effects such as pain and allergy. The cause of these noxious effects is not fully understood, and no specific molecular targets or mechanisms have been discovered. In this study, we show that iodine antiseptics cause pain and promote allergic contact dermatitis in mouse models, and iodine stimulates a subset of sensory neurons that express TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels. In vivo pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of these channels indicates that TRPA1 plays a major role in iodine antiseptics\u2010induced pain and the adjuvant effect of iodine antiseptics on allergic contact dermatitis and that TRPV1 is also involved. We further demonstrate that iodine activates TRPA1 through a redox mechanism but has no direct effects on TRPV1. Our study improves the understanding of the adverse effects of iodine antiseptics and suggests a means to minimize their side effects through local inhibition of TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels.![][1] This report identifies the cation channel TRPA1 as an endogenous molecular target of iodine in mammals. The iodine\u2010dependent activation of TRPA1 and also TRPV1 is associated with major iodine antiseptics\u2010induced adverse reactions such as pain and cutaneous allergy.EMBO Reports (2016) 17: 1422\u20131430 [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

It is an almost pure chemical with a chemical composition of (+)\u2010borneol and has been historically used as a topical analgesic for millennia. However, the clinical efficacy of topical borneol lacks stringent evidence\u2010based clinical studies and verifiable scientific mechanism. We examined the analgesic efficacy of topical borneol in a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled clinical study involving 122 patients with postoperative pain. Topical application of borneol led to significantly greater pain relief than placebo did. Using mouse models of pain, we identified the TRPM8 channel as a molecular target of borneol and showed that topical borneol\u2010induced analgesia was almost exclusively mediated by TRPM8, and involved a downstream glutamatergic mechanism in the spinal cord. Investigation of the actions of topical borneol and menthol revealed mechanistic differences between borneol\u2010 and menthol\u2010induced analgesia and indicated that borneol exhibits advantages over menthol as a topical analgesic. Our work demonstrates that borneol, which is currently approved by the US FDA to be used only as a flavoring substance or adjuvant in food, is an effective topical pain reliever in humans and reveals a key part of the molecular mechanism underlying its analgesic effect.",

Through this method, the production rate of HO increased by 46.9% after 20% nitric acid (HNO) pretreatment and reached up to 1.55\u202fmg\u00b7L\u00b7h, while the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency increased by 54%. The high micropore surface area of the acid-pretreated graphite cathode (23.32\u202fm\u00b7g) enhanced the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the electrode and subsequently increased the Faradic efficiency and maximum power density by 25% and 45%, respectively.

However, nitrate is an ideal electron sink for anaerobic pollutant degraders desiring electron acceptors due to the high redox potential. Unfortunately, not all degraders can directly reduce nitrate, and the anaerobic direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) between degraders and denitrifiers has not been confirmed yet. Here we demonstrated that syntrophic growth of  PCA with denitrifying microbial community at anaerobic condition eliminated the lag phase of 15 h and improved the denitrification rate by 13\u223c51% over a broad C/N ratio of 0.5 to 9. Quantitative PCR revealed that  selectively enhanced the expression of  coding for a cytochrome cd1-nitrite reductase, resulting in a fast and more complete denitrification.  also selectively enriched its potential denitrifying partners - , , and  - to form spherical aggregates. More studies of the binary culture system need to be carried out to confirm the syntrophic mechanism of  and denitrifiers in the future. These findings extend our knowledge on understanding the anaerobic bacterial interspecies electron transfer in the denitrification process, which has broader implications in fast selection and stabilization of denitrifiers in wastewater treatment plant, and general understanding of ecology for nitrogen and metal cycling.",

        "title": "Phosphorus Competition in Bio-induced Vivianite Recovery from Wastewater.",
        "abstract": "Phosphorus undergoes a one-way flow from minerals to soil to water, which creates a phosphorus crisis as well as aquatic eutrophication. Dissimilatory metal reduction bacterial (DMRB)-induced vivianite recovery from wastewater is a promising route to solve these problems synthetically. In this study, phosphorus competition between biomass growth and bio-induced vivianite mineralization was investigated at the batch scale. Biomass growth leads to phosphorus utilization over vivianite mineralization. Geobacter was selected as the main functional microorganism and presented higher vivianite recovery rates (20 % - 48 %) than sewage biomass (7 % - 33 %). An optimal Fe/P stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 was observed for both sewage biomass and Geobacter inoculated batches. The highest vivianite yield of 4.3 mM was obtained in Geobacter inoculated batches at a Fe:P of 1:1, with values 59 % higher than those at a Fe:P of 1:0.67 (equal to the Fe/P molar ratio in vivianite). Sufficient PO43- stimulated cell growth and yielded a higher Fe3+ reduction rate and vivianite yield. Nevertheless, excessive PO43- facilitated the precipitation of KFe3 (PO4)2(OH) \u00b78H2O and Fe7 (PO4)6, which inhibited vivianite synthesis. In the optimal Geobacter batch, the \u03bc-S curve indicated a mixed order reaction (0< x <1) for both vivianite formation and biomass growth. The vivianite growth series proceeded as follows: tiny blue particles, plain pieces, dark blue nodules and large spherical crystals.",

        "abstract": "Harmful cyanobacterial bloom is a serious threat to global aquatic ecology and drinking water safety. Electro-Fenton (EF) has emerged as an efficient process for cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins removal, but high consumption of energy and chemicals remain a major bottleneck. This study presents a novel convertible three-electrodes Electro-Coagulation-Fenton process for cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins removal with low energy consumption and no chemicals addition. We for the first time demonstrated the freely alternating between Electrocoagulation (EC) and EF by switching electrodes. The optimal aerated EC was operated at pH 8 and 100\u2009mA to remove 91\u2009\u00b1\u20092% of cyanobaterial cells and 15% of Microcystins (MCs). Coagulants generated in EC were adsorbed on cyanobacterial cells to form a protect layer against algae disruption and cyanotoxins releasing. Residual MCs and cyanobaterial cells were completely mineralized by EF at 28\u2009mA with iron ions and HO generated in-situ. Compare to traditional EF, the optimal Electro-Coagulation-Fenton process increased total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency by 30%, yet energy consumption reduced up to 92%. The novel Electro-Coagulation-Fenton process is a promising technology for the efficient treatment of the mixture of suspended solid pollutants and persistent organic pollutants in one system with low energy consumption.",

        "abstract": "Nitrate is considered as a contamination since its over discharging to water incurs environmental problems. However, nitrate is an ideal electron sink for anaerobic pollutant degraders desiring electron acceptors due to the high redox potential. Unfortunately, not all degraders can directly reduce nitrate, and the anaerobic direct interspecies electron transfer between degraders and denitrifiers has not been confirmed yet. Here we demonstrated that syntrophic growth of G. sulfurreducens PCA with denitrifying microbial community at anaerobic condition eliminated the lag phase of 15 h and improved the denitrification rate by 13 ~ 51 % over a broad C/N ratio of 0.5 to 9. Quantitative PCR revealed that G. sulfurreducens selectively enhanced the expression of nirS coding for a cytochrome cd1-nitrite reductase, resulting in a fast and more complete denitrification. Geobacter also selectively enriched its potential denitrifying partners - Diaphorobacter, Delftia and Shinella - to form spherical aggregates. More studies of the binary culture system need to be carried out to confirm the syntrophic mechanism of Geobacter and denitrifiers in the future. These findings extend our knowledge on understanding the anaerobic bacterial interspecies electron transfer in the denitrification process, which has broader implications in fast selection and stabilization of denitrifiers in wastewater treatment plant, and general understanding of ecology for nitrogen and metal cycling.",

        "abstract": "Biodegradation was regarded an environmentally benign and cost-effective technology for formaldehyde (CH O) removal. However, the biotoxicity of CH O inhibited microbial activity and decreased removal performance. We developed a novel heterotopic CH O biodegradation process that combined bioelectrochemical system (BES) and UV/H O . Instead of exogenous addition, H O was biosynthesized with electron transferred from electrochemically active bacteria. Heterotopic biodegradation of CH O was more efficient and faster than in situ biodegradation, as confirmed by 69%-308% higher removal efficiency and 98% shorter degradation time. Operated under optimal conditions for 30\u00a0min, which are optical distance of 2\u00a0cm, initial H O concentration of 102\u00a0mg/L, and pH 3, heterotopic biodegradation removed 78%, 73%, 49%, and 30% of CH O with 6, 8, 10, and 20\u00a0mg/L initial concentration. Mild formation of hydroxyl radicals from UV/H O is beneficial to sustainable CH O degradation and efficient H O utilization. Heterotopic biodegradation is a promising technology for efficient degradation of other organic compounds with biological toxicity. PRACTITIONER POINTS: H O biosynthesis through electrochemically active bacteria (EAB) served as source of \u00b7OH for CH O removal in UV/H O . Heterotopic CH O biodegradation avoided the biotoxicity of CH O. Heterotopic biodegradation of CH O saved 98% time than in-situ biodegradation. Heterotopic CH O biodegradation improved 69%-308% efficiency than in-situ.",

        "abstract": "Equilibrium of three reactants (oxygen, proton and electron) in oxygen reduction reaction at large current flux is necessary for highly efficient electro-generation of HO. In this work, we investigated reactants equilibrium and HO electrochemical production in liquid-gas-solid three phase interfaces on rolling cathodes with high electroactive area. Electrocatalytic reaction accelerated the electrolyte intrusion into hydrophobic porous catalyst layer for higher electroactive surface area, resulting in a 21% increase of HO yield at 15\u202fmA\u202fcm. Air aerated cathode submerged in air/O aeration solution was unable to produce HO efficiently due to the lack of O in three phase interfaces (TPIs), especially at current density\u202f>\u202f2.5\u202fmA\u202fcm. For air breathing cathode, stable TPIs inside the active sites was created by addition of gas diffusion layer, to increase HO production from 11\u202f\u00b1\u202f2 to 172\u202f\u00b1\u202f11\u202fmg\u202fL h at 15\u202fmA\u202fcm. Pressurized air flow application enhanced both oxygen supply and HO departure transfer to obtain a high HO production of 461\u202f\u00b1\u202f11\u202fmg\u202fL h with CE of 89\u202f\u00b1\u202f2% at 35\u202fmA\u202fcm, 45% higher than passive gas transfer systems.

        "abstract": "Bacteria induced infectious diseases have threated the lives and health of millions people each year. Nanosized titanium dioxide (TiO2) have been developed for photodynamic bacterial killing with minimal drug resistance, but the efficiency was restricted by their large band gap, limited light-absorption region, and rapid electron-hole recombination. In this work, we rationally fabricated a TiO2/BTO/Au multilayered coaxial heterostructured nanorod array by inserting a ferroelectric semiconductor barium titanate (BaTiO3) nanolayer between TiO2 nanorod and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The TiO2/BTO/Au heterostructure showed greatly enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) (superoxide (O2\u2022-) and hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH)) generation, and incident photo-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) in UV/visible light region. On the basis of experimental observations, the detailed photodynamic mechanism of the enhanced ROS generation was proposed, mainly ascribed to the piezophototronic effect and plasmonic property of the nanorod array. The nanorod array was used as an antibacterial coating to kill gram-negative bacterium E. coli and gram-positive bacterium S. Aureus with an antibacterial efficiency up to 99.9% under simulated sunlight. It also showed an efficient promotion of infectious wound regeneration in mice with S. aureus infected dermal wounds.",

This property has been used for analyte detection, tumor tissue visualization, and cancer therapy, etc. However, the effect of particle structure and morphology on its peroxidase-like activity has been rarely reported. In this work, we fabricated FeO nanoparticles with different structures (nanoclusters, nanoflowers, and nanodiamonds) by facilely tuning the pH values in the hydrothermal reaction. Their in vitro peroxidase-like activity was evaluated via chromogenic reaction of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by the reduction of HO to HO. It was found the nanostructures had a great influence on their peroxidase-like activity, following the order of nanoclusters>nanoflowers>nanodiamonds. With this activity, the peroxidase-like activity of FeO NPs was used for cancer therapy with the addition of low-concentration HO. The cancer cell-killing activity was due to the intracellular generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) after endocytosis of FeO NPs into the Hela cells. It was interesting that the cell killing ability of these three kinds of FeO NPs was not consistent with the in vitro enzyme-like activity. It was deduced that the cell endocytosis of the nanoparticles along with their enzyme-like activity co-determined their cancer cell-killing performance.",

        "abstract": "To meet the growing demands in flexible and wearable electronics, various sensors have been designed for detecting and monitoring the physical quantity changes. However, most of these sensors can only detect one certain kind of physical quantity based on a single mechanism. In this paper, we have fabricated a multifunctional sensor made from carbonized electrospun polyacrylonitrile/barium titanate (PAN-C/BTO) nanofiber film. It can detect two physical quantities (pressure and curvature), independently and simultaneously, by integrating piezoresistive, piezoelectric and triboelectric effect. For flex sensing with the impedance change of PAN-C/BTO nanofiber films during bending, it had a sensitivity of 1.12 deg-1 from 58.9o to 120.2 o and a working range of 28\u00b0~150\u00b0. For self-powered force sensing, it had a gauge factor of 1.44 V\u2022N-1 within the range of 0.15~25 N. The sensor had a long stability over 60,000 cycles at both sensing modes. The inclusion of barium titanate nanoparticles (BTO NPs) into the nanofiber film had an over 2.4 times enchantment of sensitivity for the pressure sensing due to the synergy of piezoelectric and triboelectric effect. Based on the multifunction and modularity, a series of potential applications of the sensor were demonstrated, including sensing human's swallowing, walking gaits, finger flexure and finger-tapping sensitively. The self-powered flexible dual-mode sensor has great application potential in human-computer interactive and smart wearable sensing system.",

To address the problem, herein, we presented an alternative strategy to conquer drug-resistant breast cancer through the combinatorial delivery of Ca channel siRNA with cytotoxic drug. Mesoporous silica nanocapsules (MSNCs) with mesoporous and hollow structure were fabricated for co-delivery of T-type Ca channel siRNA and doxorubicin (DOX) with high drug loading efficiency. The DOX/siRNA co-loaded MSNCs showed a synergistic therapeutic effect on drug-resistant breast cancer cells MCF-7/ADR, while had only an additive effect on drug-sensitive MCF-7 counterpart. It was found that the combination of T-type Ca channel siRNA and DOX had similar effect on MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR in knockdown of overexpressed T-type Ca channel and decrease in cytosolic Ca concentration ([Ca]), but it specifically induced G/G1 phase cell-cycle arrest and intracellular drug accumulation enhancement in MCF-7/ADR. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that the MSNCs with good biocompatibility had a high efficiency for conquering the drug-resistant breast cancer with the DOX/calcium channel siRNA cocktail co-delivery. It provides a new biological target for drug/gene delivery enhanced cancer therapy with nanoformulations.",

Herein, a biomechanical-energy-powered triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)-driven electroporation system is developed for intracellular drug delivery with high efficiency and minimal cell damage in vitro and in vivo. In the integrated system, a self-powered TENG as a stable voltage pulse source triggers the increase of plasma membrane potential and membrane permeability. Cooperatively, the silicon nanoneedle-array electrode minimizes cellular damage during electroporation via enhancing the localized electrical field at the nanoneedle-cell interface and also decreases plasma membrane fluidity for the enhancement of molecular influx. The integrated system achieves efficient delivery of exogenous materials (small molecules, macromolecules, and siRNA) into different types of cells, including hard-to-transfect primary cells, with delivery efficiency up to 90% and cell viability over 94%. Through simple finger friction or hand slapping of the wearable TENGs, it successfully realizes a transdermal biomolecule delivery with an over threefold depth enhancement in mice. This integrated and self-powered system for active electroporation drug delivery shows great prospect for self-tuning drug delivery and wearable medicine.",

        "abstract": "As a physical cue for controlling the fate of stem cells, surface nanotopography has attracted much attention to improve the integration between implants and local host tissues and cells. A biocompatible surface TiO2 nanorod array is proposed to regulate the fate of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). TiO2 substrates with different surface nanotopographies: a TiO2 nanorod array and a polished TiO2 ceramic are built by hydrothermal and sintering processes, respectively. The assessment of morphology, viability, gene expression, and protein characterization of the MSCs cultured on the different TiO2 substrates proves that a TiO2 nanorod array promotes the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, while a TiO2 ceramic with a smooth surface suppresses it. Periodically assembled TiO2 nanorod array stripes on the smooth TiO2 ceramic are constructed by a combination of microfabrication and a chemical synthesis process, which realizes the location-committed osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. A route to control the differentiation of MSCs by a nanostructured surface, which can also control the location and direction of MSCs on the surface of biomaterials with micro-nano scale surface engineering, is demonstrated.",

However, their clinical application is technically restricted by their bio-inert property with limited cross-interaction with biological microenvironment and cells. In this work, a facile approach was proposed to construct surface nanostructure and metal ion incorporation for titanium foam to regulate the attachment and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). This modification was realized by a hydrothermal treatment following a Mg 2+  or Ca 2+  ion-substitution process. The assessment of cell morphology, viability, gene and protein expression of MSCs grown on the surface nanostructured titanium form and different ion corporation showed that the surface nanostructure and Mg 2+  and Ca 2+  incorporation with proper concentration promoted the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Once beyond the proper concentration range, the promoting effect of osteogenesis was reduced. It provides a promising method for constructing 3D biomaterial in bone tissue engineering.",

In this study, nanostructured MoS 2  biointerface was fabricated by assembling few-layer MoS 2  nanoflakes onto substrate using a facile hydrothermal method. Its effects on proliferation, adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were compared with a flat substrate. The live\u2013dead staining and cell count kit-8 (CCK-8) were used to evaluate the biocompatibility. Focal adhesion formation was used to explore the interaction between MSCs and the nanostructured MoS 2 . Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, alizarin red S staining, immunofluorescent staining and real quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were performed to assess the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. The results showed that the nanoporous structured MoS 2  interface can not only promote the MSCs attachment and spreading, but also accelerate the MSCs osteogenesis. Our results can provide insight into the design considerations of the biointerface to control the stem cell fate.",

In the present work, we first found that a titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanorod array that can be conveniently prepared on multiple kinds of substrates has high affinity for tumor cells.

The WS 2  nanosheets possess an excellent electrocatalytic oxidation response towards adenine and guanine that encourages the adsorption of nucleobases and charge transfer at the surface of the microfibers. The WS 2  nanosheet/graphite microfiber hybrid electrode shows high sensitivity and selectivity for the detection of adenine and guanine. This hybrid microfiber electrode represents an excellent candidate platform for development of an electrochemical biosensor due to its low cost, flexibility and 3D morphology.",

        "abstract": "The cell-material interface is one of the most important considerations in designing a high-performance tissue engineering scaffold because the surface of the scaffold can determine the fate of stem cells. A conductive surface is required for a scaffold to direct stem cells toward neural differentiation. However, most conductive polymers are toxic and not amenable to biological degradation, which restricts the design of neural tissue engineering scaffolds. In this study, we used a bioactive three-dimensional (3D) porcine acellular dermal matrix (PADM), which is mainly composed of type I collagen, as a basic material and successfully assembled a layer of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets on the surface of the PADM channels to obtain a porous 3D, biodegradable, conductive and biocompatible PADM-rGO hybrid neural tissue engineering scaffold. Compared with the PADM scaffold, assembling the rGO into the scaffold did not induce a significant change in the microstructure but endowed the PADM-rGO hybrid scaffold with good conductivity. A comparison of the neural differentiation of rat bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was performed by culturing the MSCs on PADM and PADM-rGO scaffolds in neuronal culture medium, followed by the determination of gene expression and immunofluorescence staining. The results of both the gene expression and protein level assessments suggest that the rGO-assembled PADM scaffold may promote the differentiation of MSCs into neuronal cells with higher protein and gene expression levels after 7 days under neural differentiation conditions. This study demonstrated that the PADM-rGO hybrid scaffold is a promising scaffold for neural tissue engineering; this scaffold can not only support the growth of MSCs at a high proliferation rate but also enhance the differentiation of MSCs into neural cells.",

        "abstract": "The influence of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) on key characteristics of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) phenotype (i.e., self-renewal, differentiation potential, and pluripotency) is systematically investigated in this work. First, the viability and impact of GQDs on the self-renewal potential of MSCs is evaluated in order to determine a threshold for the exposing dose. Second, GQDs uptake by MSCs is confirmed due to the excellent fluorescent properties of the particles. They exhibit a homogenous cytoplasmatic distribution that increases with the time and concentration. Third, the impact of GQDs on the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs is deeply characterized. An enhanced activity of alkaline phosphatase promoted by GQDs indicates early activation of osteogenesis. This is also confirmed upon GQD-induced up-regulation of phenotypically related osteogenic genes (Runx2, osteopontin, and osteocalcin) and specific biomarkers expression (osteopontin and osteocalcin). GQDs also effectively enhance the formation of calcium-rich deposits characteristics of osteoblasts. Furthermore, genes microarray results indicate that the enhanced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs by GQDs is in progress through a bone morphogenetic protein and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 relative signaling pathways. Finally, intracytoplasmatic lipid detection shows that GQDs can also promote the adipogenic differentiation of MSCs, thus confirming the prevalence of their pluripotency potential.",

        "abstract": "Nanoformulations that can respond to the specific tumor microenvironment (TME), such as a weakly acidic pH, low oxygen, and high glutathione (GSH), show promise for killing cancer cells with minimal invasiveness and high specificity. In this study, we demonstrate self-assembled copper-amino acid mercaptide nanoparticles (Cu-Cys NPs) for in situ glutathione-activated and H2O2-reinforced chemodynamic therapy for drug-resistant breast cancer. After endocytosis into tumor cells, the Cu-Cys NPs could first react with local GSH, induce GSH depletion and reduce Cu2+ to Cu+. Subsequently, the generated Cu+ would react with local H2O2 to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) via a Fenton-like reaction, which has a fast reaction rate in the weakly acidic TME, that are responsible for tumor-cell apoptosis. Due to the high GSH and H2O2 concentration in tumor cells, which sequentially trigger the redox reactions, Cu-Cys NPs exhibited relatively high cytotoxicity to cancer cells, whereas normal cells were left alive. The in vivo results also proved that Cu-Cys NPs efficiently inhibited drug-resistant breast cancer without causing obvious systemic toxicity. As a novel copper mercaptide nanoformulation responsive to the TME, these Cu-Cys NPs may have great potential in chemodynamic cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Generally, carbon or graphite fibers (GFs) are used as the supporting materials for the preparation of flexible supercapacitors (SCs) by assembling various electrochemically active nanomaterials on them. A facile and rapid electrochemical oxidation method with a voltage of 3\u00a0V in a mixed H 2 SO 4 -HNO 3  solution for 2\u201315\u00a0min is proposed to active continuous filament GFs. Detailed structural characterization, SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman and XPS demonstrate that the GFs-8 (oxidized for 8\u00a0min) possessing high specific surface area which provided numerous electrochemical sites and a large number of oxygen-containing functional groups producing pseudocapacitance. Cyclic voltammetric (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are conducted to test the capacitive of GFs and activated GFs. The capacitance of GFs-8 reaches as high as 570\u00a0mF\u00a0cm \u22121  at the current density of 1\u00a0mA\u00a0cm \u22121  in LiCl electrolyte, a 1965-fold enhancement with respect to the pristine GFs (0.29\u00a0mF\u00a0cm \u22121 ). The fabricated fiber solid-state supercapacitors (SSCs) provide high energy density of 0.68 mWh cm \u22123  at the power density 3.3\u00a0W\u00a0cm \u22123  and have excellent durability with 90% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles. In addition, such fiber SSCs features flexibility and mechanical stability, which may have wide applications in wearable electronic devices.",

It is shown that the total densities, total temperatures, and magnetic field of two carriers converge to the equilibrium states at the same rate (1 + t)-3/2 + 3/2n in Ln norm. But both the difference of densities and the difference of temperatures of two carriers decay at the rate (1 + t)-2- 1/n , and the velocity and electric field decay at the rate (1 + t)-3/2 + 1/2n .

This system is quasilinear hyperbolic-parabolic. In the first part, by using the maximum principle, we find a non-constant steady state solution with small amplitude for this system.

Other preliminary results in this paper include temperature dependency study, pulse voltage write/read and retention characterization. From these results, lithium niobate based device show the temperature stability and multiple stages of write/read and long retention period. All these demonstrate its potential for the application of neuromorphic computing in the future.",

This is essential for programming neuromorphic systems based on memristor crossbars in order to achieve best deep learning capability. The memristor devices were formed using a 42\u00a0nm layer of LiNbO 3  sandwiched between two metal electrodes. I-V curves demonstrate a typical and repeatable memristor characteristic from \u2212\u00a03\u00a0V to 3\u00a0V. Such devices have a continuous resistance range that has a maximum to minimum resistance ratio of about 100, and the ability to program intermediate resistance states. The results also show the ability to read the device symmetrically with a positive or negative voltage, and strong data retention after the programming phase.",

A common approach for the development of memristor-based neuromorphic circuits is to store synaptic weight values within memristors as resistance values. This requires use of the continuous resistance range available in the memristors to store the weight matrix produced by a learning algorithm. More specifically, these devices will be used in systems that implement supervised learning algorithms such as single and multilayer perceptrons. It is important to be able to iteratively program a target resistance through a number of feedback controlled voltage pulses as opposed to abruptly switching the device between two binary states. This paper shows how TiO 2  memristor devices placed in a crossbar arrangement are capable of implementing Boolean logic functions using a perceptron algorithm. Resistances within a memristor crossbar can be tuned and reconfigured so that a neuron circuit based on this crossbar can represent multiple different functions.",

In this paper, we demonstrate the programmability of memristor devices with filamentary switching based on LiNbOx, a new resistive switching oxide. We have performed several characterization experiments that demonstrate the high resolution programmability of these devices. Once the optimal programming voltages and conductivity ranges for these memristor devices are determined, a method is presented to determine how many unique states can be achieved in these devices. Parameters obtained from this analysis can greatly strengthen memristor device models that implement realistic stochastic switching behavior. We show that 11 unique states can be stored in this device with 95% confidence, but many more states are achievable using feedback write techniques or in-situ learning. Therefore, we have determined that Lithium Niobate memristors are strong candidates for use in neuromorphic computing.",

The influence of model structure and training data set composition are each analysed for their influence on combustion phasing control accuracy under steady-state and transient engine operating conditions. The model structure developed for this research utilises both fuel sensitive and combustion related physical models as inputs, with an aim to minimise neural network size and increase its generalisation capability. Optimisation of the network structure is also studied to evaluate overall robustness and ensure control stability. Real-time engine test results show satisfactory combustion phasing control performance with multiple fuels for both steady state and transient conditions. Moreover, demonstration of the differences of controller performance brought by the steady state and transient training data samples will be also provided.",

Dynamic analysis is necessary for some applications, but the dynamic response of DEMESs is difficult to model because of the complicated morphology and viscoelasticity of the DE film. In this paper, a method composed of theoretical analysis and experimental measurement is presented to model the dynamic response of a DEMES rotary joint under an alternating voltage. Based on measurements of equivalent driving force and damping of the DEMES, the model can be derived. Some experiments were carried out to validate the equivalent dynamic model. The maximum angle error between model and experiment is greater than ten degrees, but it is acceptable to predict angular velocity of the DEMES, therefore, it can be applied in feedforward\u2013feedback compound control.",

If the task only needs binary action, the bistable structure will be an efficient solution and can save energy because it requires only a very short duration of voltage to switch its state. To obtain bistable DEMES, a method to realize the two stable states of traditional DEMES is provided in this paper. Based on this, a type of symmetrical bistable DEMES is proposed, and the required actuation pulse duration is shorter than 0.1 s. When a suitable mass is attached to end of the DEMES, or two layers of dielectric elastomer are affixed to both sides of the primary frame, the DEMES can realize two stable states and can be switched by a suitable pulse duration. To calculate the required minimum pulse duration, a mathematical model is provided and validated by experiment.",

Driven with an alternating electric field, the joint deformation vibrational frequency follows the input voltage frequency. However, the authors find that if the rotational angel over a negative angle during dynamic response, the resonance mode will be different from the traditional, the vibration with the largest amplitude does not occur while the voltage frequency is equal to natural response frequency of the joint. Rather, the vibrational amplitude will be quite large over a range of other frequencies, at which the voltage frequency is greater than one time of the nature frequency and smaller than two times. This phenomenon was analyzed by relationship between the bending angle, applied voltage and bending moment of the film to the frame on a timeline. This new resonance mode can be applied to some biomimetic soft robots that consist of DEMES rotary joint.",

Considering the rotary joint is a basic and common component of many biomimetic robots, we have been fabricated rotary joint by DEMES and developed its performances in the past two years. In this paper, we have discussed the static analysis, dynamics analysis and some characteristics of the DEMES rotary joint. Based on theoretical analysis, some different applications of the DEMES rotary joint were presented, such as a flapping wing, a biomimetic fish and a two-legged walker. All of the robots are fabricated by DEMES rotary joint and can realize some basic biomimetic motions. Comparing with traditional rigid robot, the robot based on DEMES is soft and light, so it has advantage on the collision-resistant.",

Actuation of DE under voltage control is prone to electromechanical instabilities, while the DE under charge control always survives from instabilities with sacrificing a large deformation. In this article, a novel actuation mode of steady electric field is proposed. By tuning applied voltage and sprayed charge during viscoelastic creep, an invariable electric field is generated. Such an actuation method can both avoid the occurrence of electromechanical instabilities and guarantee a large deformation in DE actuation.",

Currently time-dependent EM solvers are typically parallel only in space.

But the parallel efficiency quickly deteriorates and even saturates if spatial parallelism has been fully exploited. We proposed a new time domain EM solver to harvest parallelism in both spatial and temporal dimension. The spatial parallelism is achieved by discontinuous Galerkin formulation, and the temporal parallelism is enabled by Krylov subspace method based exponential integrator.

The proposed PRS employs service recommendation techniques to infer residential users\u2019 potential interests and needs on energy saving appliances, and then it recommends energy saving appliances to users, therefore potentially creating opportunities to save energy for the grid. The proposed approach starts by applying a non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NILM) method based on generalised particle filtering to disaggregate the end users\u2019 household appliance utilisation profiles from the smart meter data. Based on the NILM results, several inference rules are applied to infer the preferences and energy consumption patterns, and to form the user profile. In parallel, information retrieval techniques are applied to extract keywords from the textual appliance advertisements (Ads), and to define the appliance profile. Finally, the similarity measurement method is applied to compare the user profile and appliance profile, to rank the appliance Ad, and to make the recommendations. Experiments are conducted to validate the proposed system.",

        "abstract": "With the spread of distributed energy resources, sensing infrastructure, and automation facilities, modern homes are becoming \u201chome microgrids\u201d. This paper intends to support this trend and proposes a two-stage hierarchical energy management system for smart homes by considering both day-ahead and actual operation stages. In the day-ahead stage, an efficient scenario analysis approach is developed to account for the residential photovoltaic solar power uncertainty. The approach performs solar power scenario generation and reduction based on the Wasserstein distance metric and K-medoids, respectively. This is then followed by the use of a stochastic day-ahead residential energy resource scheduling model. In the actual operation stage, a Semi-Scenario based Rolling Horizon Optimization (SSRHO) mechanism is proposed, based on which an actual operation model is established. Simulations are then conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system.",

Studies on how to collaboratively enable the optimal planning of these interacted networks is less explored. In this work, a joint distribution network expansion planning framework integrated with a shared EV charging station is proposed. One of the objectives is to minimise overall investment cost considering operational waiting cost of shared EV charging service and power loss, while the other aims to maximise the utilisation of charging infrastructures. To overcome the difficulties in solving the multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear problem, Tchebycheff decomposition based evolutionary algorithm is modified to find the Pareto front showing the trade-offs between goals above. Besides, stochastic traffic assignment model is used to obtain traffic distribution and travel demand. The final optimal solution is decided by the fuzzy satisficing method. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on a 54-node test system. Sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the impact of key parameters from the perspectives of transportation and distribution network sectors. The numerical results demonstrate the capability and feasibility of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Multiphoton microscopy has attracted increasing attention and investigations in the field of breast cancer, based on two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and second-harmonic generation (SHG). However, the incidence of breast benign diseases is about 5 to 10 times higher than breast cancer; up to 30% of women suffer from breast benign diseases and require treatment at some time in their lives. Thus, in this study, MPM was applied to image fibroadenoma and fibrocystic lesion, which are two of the most common breast benign diseases. The results show that MPM has the capability to identify the microstructure of lobule and stroma in normal breast tissue, the interaction of compressed ducts with surrounding collagen fiber in fibroadenoma, and the architecture of cysts filled with cystic fluid in fibrocystic disease. These findings indicate that, with integration of MPM into currently accepted clinical imaging system, it has the potential to make a real-time diagnosis of breast benign diseases in vivo, as well as breast cancer.",

Their accurate identification is important for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. In this paper, distinguishing between neurons and glial cells by using the two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) signals of intracellular intrinsic sources was performed. TPEF microscopy combined with TUJ-1 and GFAP immunostaining and quantitative image analysis demonstrated that the perinuclear granules of neurons in the TPEF images of brain tissue and the primary cultured cortical cells were a unique characteristic of neurons compared to glial cells which can become a quantitative feature to distinguish neurons from glial cells. With the development of miniaturized TPEF microscope (u0027two-photon fiberscopesu0027) imaging devices, TPEF microscopy can be developed into an effective diagnostic and monitoring tool for psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia.",

MPM is able to effectively identify neurons and neurites in cerebral cortex, as well as glial cells, Purkinje cells, and granule cells in cerebellar cortex at subcellular resolution. In addition, the use of automated image processing algorithms can quantify the circularity of neurons and the density distribution of neurites based on the intrinsic nonlinear optical contrast, further providing quantitative characteristics for automatically analyzing the laminar structure of cortical structures. These results suggest that with the development of the feasibility of two-photon fiberscopes and microendoscope probes, the combined MPM and image analysis holds potential to provide supplementary information to augment the diagnostic accuracy of neuropathology and in vivo identification of various neurological illnesses in clinic.",

Defined cell layers are significant to our understanding of brain structure and function. In this work, multiphoton microscopy (MPM), based on second harmonic generation and two-photon excited fluorescence, is applied for visualizing the mouse and human cerebral cortex from fresh, unfixed, and unstained specimen. We show that label-free MPM is able to effectively visualize microscopic scale of cortical neurons, six-layer cortical lamination, and functional cortex that correlates with the corresponding stained histological images. Moreover, we further demonstrate that MPM is feasible for identifying focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) in the human cerebral cortex. The border between gray and white matter, abnormal radial cortical lamination, immature small diameter neurons, pia mater, and blood vessels are also clearly visualized as the typical histopathologic hallmark of FCD. In addition, to diagnose FCD more accurately and rapidly, an image processing method is employed to extract MPM image features for auxiliary identification of FCD specimen. These results offer additional metrics to pathologists and surgeons, which hold the translational potential to be used as a diagnostic tool into routine clinical use.",

Although clinical brain imaging techniques have provided precise anatomic images of cerebellar structures, a definitive diagnosis still requires adequate resolution to identify individual layers in cerebellar cortex, the extent of tumor, even requires the histological tissue examination during surgical procedures. In this study, multiphoton microscopy (MPM), based on second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF), was perform on the rat cerebellar structures and pathology with the combination of image analysis methods. Results show that MPM can reveal the cerebellar vermis, hemispheres, medulla, and ventricle, as well as axon bundles, Purkinje cells, capillaries, and the pia mater of the cerebellum. Together with custom-developed image processing algorithms, MPM could further differentiate between the gray and white matter, as well as evaluate the Purkinje cell layer, identify the cerebellar tumor boundary, and distinguish between the tumor core and peritumor regions.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) of variable duration times could be anticipated to result in varying degrees of injury that evolve spatially over time. Therefore, investigations following strokes require information concerning the spatiotemporal dimensions of the ischemic core as well as of perilesional areas. In the present study, multiphoton microscopy (MPM) based on two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and second harmonic generation (SHG) was applied to image such pathophysiological events. The ischemic time-points for evaluation were set at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after MCAO. Our results demonstrated that MPM has the ability to not only identify the normal and ischemic brain regions, but also reveal morphological changes of the cortex and striatum at various times following permanent MCAO. These findings corresponded well with the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained tissue images. With the technologic progression of miniaturized imaging devices, MPM can be developed into an effective diagnostic and monitoring tool for ischemic stroke.",

        "abstract": "Endothelial cells death induced by angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a role in vascular injury. RNF146 is identified as a E3 ubiquitin ligase, which promotes cell survival under many types of stresses. However, the role of RNF146 in endothelial cellular injury is unknown. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), Ang II treatment led to cell death by oxidative stress and promoted RNF146 to accumulate in nucleus in time dependent manner. Nuclear export signal was found in the RNF146's sequence. The interaction between RNF146 and XPO1 was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Inhibition of XPO1 with KPT-185 increased the level of RNF146 in nucleus. The expression of XPO1 was suppressed responding to Ang II treatment. Overexpression of XPO1 facilitated the nuclear shuttling of RNF146, which protected from Ang II-induced cell death. Moreover, overexpression of RNF146 in HUVECs reduced the cell death induced by Ang II, whereas inhibition of XPO1 abolished the protective effect of RNF146. Therefore, our data demonstrated that RNF146 was a protective factor against cell death induced by AngII in human endothelial cells, which was dependent on XPO1-mediated nuclear export.",

In the present study, we found that the expression of CSN5 was increased in Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiac hypertrophic mice hearts and Ang II-treated cardiomyocytes. We also observed that overexpression of CSN5 significantly inhibited Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy, whereas CSN5 silence exhibited the opposite phenotypes. Further investigation demonstrated that CSN5 maintained the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in cardiomyocyte by enhancement of LKB1. Mechanistically, we found that CSN5 directly interacted and deubiquitinated LKB1 for its stabilization in cardiomyocytes. Finally, our results demonstrated that the anti-hypertrophic effect of CSN5 was partially dependent on stabilization of LKB1. Collectively, these findings suggested that strategies based on activation of CSN5/LKB1 axis might be promising in the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Sepsis-related acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by excessive lung inflammation and apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells resulting in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Recent studies indicated that anaerobic glycolysis play an important role in sepsis. However, whether inhibition of aerobic glycolysis exhibits beneficial effect on sepsis-induced ALI is not known. In\u00a0vivo, a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced ALI mouse model was set up and mice treated with glycolytic inhibitor 3PO after CLP. The mice treated with the 3PO ameliorated the survival rate, histopathological changes, lung inflammation, lactate increased and lung apoptosis of mice with CLP-induced sepsis. In\u00a0vitro, the exposure of human alveolar epithelial A549\u00a0cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in cell apoptosis, inflammatory cytokine production, enhanced glycolytic flux and reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased. While these changes were attenuated by 3PO treatment. Sequentially, treatment of A549\u00a0cells with lactate caused cell apoptosis and enhancement of ROS. Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly lowered LPS and lactate-induced the generation of ROS and cell apoptosis in A549\u00a0cells. Therefore, these results indicate that anaerobic glycolysis may be an important contributor in cell apoptosis of sepsis-related ALI. Moreover, LPS specifically induces apoptotic insults to A549\u00a0cell through lactate-mediated enhancement of ROS.",

Abnormal high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) activation is involved in the pathogenesis of PF. However, whether aerobic glycolysis contributes to HMGB1-induced fibroblast proliferation and ECM production in PF has not yet been determined. In this study, we investigated the effects of HMGB1 on human embryonic lung fibroblast (HLF-1) proliferation, ECM production, and aerobic glycolysis. The lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor oxamic acid (OA), and PFKFB3 inhibitor 3PO were used to block certain crucial steps of aerobic glycolysis. As a result, we observed an increase of HMGB1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in bleomycin (BLM)-treated rats as compared to non-treated rats (control group). A concentration-dependent increase of HLF-1 proliferation and expression of \u03b1-SMA and \u03b1-collagen I were observed in the HMGB1 group, as well as increases of LDHA activation, glucose uptake levels, glycolytic rate, lactate level, and ATP production. OA and 3PO, or suppression of HIF1-\u03b1, blocked the effects of HMGB1. In summary, HMGB1 promotes fibroblast proliferation and ECM production though upregulating expression of HIF1-\u03b1 to induce an increase of aerobic glycolysis.",

        "abstract": "Viral infection affects the pattern of plant miRNA expression. It has been presumed that reduction of miR171 and several other miRNAs influences viral symptoms in plants. We here experimentally demonstrate the association of osa-miR171b with rice stripe virus (RSV) symptoms in rice. Inhibition of osa-miR171b caused stunting with reduced chlorophyll content in leaves similar to viral symptoms. Overexpression of osa-miR171b by an artificial miRNA extended vegetative growth and enhanced chlorophyll accumulation in leaves. Tillers were thicker, and panicles were longer with more spikelets in plants overexpressing osa-miR171b than in controls, but there were no differences in tiller numbers. Targets of osa-miR171b, OsSCL6-IIa, OsSCL6-IIb, and OsSCL6-IIc, were respectively up- and down-regulated in plants where osa-miR171b was inhibited or overexpressed. In plants overexpressing osa-miR171b, five positive regulators for heading development, Ehd1, Ehd2, Ehd3, Ehd4, and Hd3a were up-regulated, while the negative regulator Ghd7 was down-regulated. Plants overexpressing osa-miR171b were less susceptible to RSV and virus symptoms were attenuated. Taken together, the results reveal that a reduction of osa-miR171b in RSV-infected rice contributes to RSV symptoms, and provide more insight into the roles of osa-miR171b in rice.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in plant development. There is increasing evidence that changed expression of miRNAs in virus-infected plants contributes to the development of viral symptoms. Here, we analyzed the altered expression of miRNAs of Nicotiana benthamiana in response to potato virus X (PVX) by Illumina Solexa sequencing. One of the 21 miRNAs significantly affected, nbe-miR166h-p5, was closely associated with viral symptoms. Using the tobacco rattle virus-based miRNA suppression (VbMS) system, we found that the suppression of nbe-miR166h-p5 in plants caused leaves to turn dark green with increased chlorophyll. When PVX was inoculated on nbe-miR166h-p5-suppressed plants, the leaf yellowing symptom of PVX was largely attenuated with less reduction of chlorophyll content, while the accumulation of PVX was decreased. nbe-miR166h-p5 was also up-regulated in plants infected by turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), and its suppression attenuated the leaf yellowing symptom of TuMV and decreased viral accumulation. Three potential targets of nbe-miR166h-p5 were identified. The results indicate the association of nbe-miR166h-p5 with symptoms of PVX and also with those of TuMV, providing useful information on the relationship between miRNA and viral infection.

Deep sequencing technology has revolutionized the study on the interaction between virus and plant host through the analysis of vsiRNAs profile. However, comparison of vsiRNA profiles in different tissues from a same host plant has been rarely reported. In this study, the profiles of vsiRNAs from leaves and fruits of  plants infected with Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) were comprehensively characterized and compared. Many more vsiRNAs were present in infected leaves than in fruits. vsiRNAs from both leaves and fruits were mostly 21- and 22-nt in size as previously described in other virus-infected plants. Interestingly, vsiRNAs were predominantly produced from the viral positive strand RNAs in infected leaves, whereas in infected fruits they were derived equally from the positive and negative strands. Many leaf-specific positive vsiRNAs with lengths of 21-nt (2058) or 22-nt (3996) were identified but only six (21-nt) and one (22-nt) positive vsiRNAs were found to be specific to fruits. vsiRNAs hotspots were only present in the 5'-terminal and 3'-terminal of viral positive strand in fruits, while multiple hotspots were identified in leaves. Differences in GC content and 5'-terminal nucleotide of vsiRNAs were also observed in the two organs.

We now show that Nicotiana benthamiana ALD1 is involved in defence against a virus and that the ethylene pathway also participates in ALD1-mediated resistance. NbALD1 was up-regulated in plants infected with turnip mosaic virus (TuMV). Silencing of NbALD1 facilitated TuMV infection, while overexpression of NbALD1 or exogenous application of pipecolic acid (Pip), the downstream product of ALD1, enhanced resistance to TuMV. The SA content was lower in NbALD1-silenced plants and higher where NbALD1 was overexpressed or following Pip treatments. SA mediated resistance to TuMV and was required for NbALD1-mediated resistance. However, on NahG plants (in which SA cannot accumulate), Pip treatment still alleviated susceptibility to TuMV, further demonstrating the presence of an SA-independent resistance pathway. The ethylene precursor, 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACC), accumulated in NbALD1-silenced plants but was reduced in plants overexpressing NbALD1 or treated with Pip. Silencing of ACS1, a key gene in the ethylene pathway, alleviated the susceptibility of NbALD1-silenced plants to TuMV, while exogenous application of ACC compromised the resistance of Pip-treated or NbALD1 transgenic plants. The results indicate that NbALD1 mediates resistance to TuMV by positively regulating the resistant SA pathway and negatively regulating the susceptible ethylene pathway.",

        "abstract": "In plants, autophagy is involved in responses to viral infection. However, understanding of new host factors mediating autophagic clearance of plant viruses is very limited. We here identified a new host factor NbP3IP participating in autophagy-mediated plant defense against viral infection. NbP3IP interacted with p3, a RNA silencing suppressor encoded by Rice stripe virus (RSV), a negative-strand RNA virus, and mediated its autophagic degradation. NbP3IP could also interact with NbATG8f, which was required for NbP3IP-miediated p3 degradation. Overexpression of NbP3IP induced autophagy and down-regulation of NbP3IP reduced autophagy. Both overexpression of NbP3IP and silencing of GAPC, which induces autophagy, inhibited RSV infection. In contrast, silencing of ATG7 promoted RSV infection. Thus, through identification of a new potential selective autophagy receptor P3IP, we revealed a new mechanism of autophagy-mediated plant defense against plant virus, and provided the first evidence that plant autophagy can also play antiviral roles to negative-strand RNA virus.",

        "abstract": "Levetiracetam therapy is often associated with high levels of individual variation in the recommended dose required to achieve preferential treatment. Thus, a reliable and dynamic regulation system to accurately tailor dose is necessary. The main objective of this work was to explore and prepare a dose-flexible control system suitable for rapid release tablets equipped with high drug loading and a cylindrical model design. Semisolid extrusion 3D printing was utilized to fabricate a series of tablets of increased volume. This method was compatible with three patterns to regulate the volumes to manipulate the tablet mass and achieve tailored personalized precision dosing. All tablets from each pattern exhibited a smooth surface and regular shape as well as sufficient mechanical strength. A good linear correlation between the mass and theoretical volume of the tablets was maintained, regardless of the pattern used. The range of dose accuracy was between 103.3% and 96.2%, with an acceptable variation coefficient in the range of 0.6-3.2%. Faster release behavior for levetiracetam can be achieved from the small sized tablets due to their larger surface area/mass ratio. All the results demonstrated the potential and capability of SSE 3D printing as a novel pharmaceutical manufacturing technique to provide a dynamic and highly accurate controllable system for preparing patient-tailored medicines.",

The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of SSE 3D printed tablets with novel internal structures. Twelve types of 3D printed tablets with pre-designed structures were developed. Glipizide was selected as the model drug and three different concentrations of the HPMC K100LV polymer were used in the 3D printing process as the hydrophilic matrix. All of the printed tablets had satisfactory physical properties and structural integrity indicating the suitability of SSE 3D printing for the fabrication of personalized medicines with complex structures. The dissolution profiles of the printed tablets revealed the relationship between novel structures and drug release behavior. Tailored drug release may be easily achieved without changing the prescription by adjusting printing parameters such as outline value, grid width and printing pattern. All results of this paper clearly reveal the feasibility and capability of SSE 3D printing technology as a novel pharmaceutical manufacturing technique to fabricate personalized medicines and modulate drug dissolution profiles.",

The polymeric micelles were prepared by an organic solvent evaporation method, and the encapsulation efficiency (EE), drug loading (DL), critical micelle concentrations (CMC), morphology, particle size, and zeta potential were determined. The cytotoxicity was examined by the MTT assay, and the cellular uptake study was performed by confocal laser scanning microscopy.

The results demonstrated that the particle size of the prepared micelle was 124.6\u2009\u00b1\u20099.6\u00a0nm, the encapsulation efficiency was 82.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9%, and the drug loading was 8.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4%. The results of cytotoxicity and cellular uptake demonstrated that the SGD 5n-loaded micelles could efficiently enter tumor cells, and the cellular uptake of SGD 5n presented concentration and time dependence. This study demonstrated that the prepared SGD 5n-loaded polymeric micelles had significant antitumor activity and provided a basis for clinical development of new compound SGD 5n.",

        "abstract": "In order to explore a novel high efficacy drug delivery system for membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN), a complex chronic inflammation, methylprednisolone bovine serum albumin nanoparticles (ME BSA NPs) were designed. The nanoparticles were prepared by desolvation-chemical crosslinking method and its physicochemical characterizations were conducted. The experimental MGN rat models induced by cationic bovine serum albumin were established by a modified Border's method and applied in the pharmacodynamics study of ME BSA NPs. The results showed that the particle size, particle dispersion index, and entrapment efficiency of ME BSA NPs were 131.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4\u00a0nm, 0.159\u2009\u00b1\u20090.036, and 71.51\u2009\u00b1\u20091.74%, respectively. In addition, the image of transmission electron microscopy showed that the ME BSA NPs were the relatively uniform spherical particles. In the in vivo pharmacodynamics study, compared with saline group and SOLU-MEDROL\u00ae group, that the ME BSA NPs group was significantly reduced the levels of 24\u00a0h urinary protein (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and serum creatinine (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Consequently, these outcomes indicated that the nanoparticles we studied were a promising drug delivery system for the MGN disease, and it may be also useful for other complex chronic inflammations.",

Regarding the complexity in debris flow dynamics, experimental approaches have proven to be effective in revealing the formative mechanism for debris flow, and quantifying the relations between the various influencing factors with debris-flow formation and subsequent transport processes. Therefore, a flume-based and experimental study was performed at the Debris Flow Observation and Research Station of Jiangjia Gully in Yunnan Province, to theoretically analyze favorable conditions for debris-flow formation and initial transport by selecting the median particle size d50, flow rate Q, vertical grading coefficient \u03c8, slopes S, and the initial soil water contents W as the five variables for investigation. To achieve this, an optimal combination of these variables was made through an orthogonal experimental design to determine their relative importance upon the occurrence and initial mobilization behavior of a debris flow and to further enhance our insight into debris-flow triggering and transport mechanisms.",

To the best of our knowledge, there is no review focusing on their antitumor activity and mechanism of their antitumor activity. To fill the gap, in this review, we summarized antitumor effects of the isosteroidal alkaloids from genus Veratrum and Fritillaria on different tumors and the mechanisms of their antitumor activity.

        "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the world. Present therapies for COPD have limited effect on reducing the progression of COPD and suppressing the inflammatory response in the lung. Bulbs of Fritillaria cirrhosa D. Don (BFC) have been used in many Asian countries for a long time to treat pulmonary diseases, such as cough, expectoration, and asthma. Steroidal alkaloids are the major biological active constituents in BFC, whereby imperialine is one of the important steroidal alkaloids. So far, there are no studies reporting the effect of imperialine on COPD. In this study, we investigated the effect of imperialine on pulmonary function and structure and inflammation in a COPD-like rat model which was induced by the combination of exposure to CS and intratracheal administration of LPS. Our data show that imperialine mitigates pulmonary functional and structural impairment and suppressed inflammatory response in a COPD-like rat model by mediating expression of related cytokines in lung tissues of the COPD-like rats, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, NF-\u03baB, TGF-\u03b21, MMP-9, and TIMP-1.

        "abstract": "The genus  (Liliaceae) comprises of ~140 species of bulbous perennials, which are distributed in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere.  species have attracted much attention because of their commercial value, partly as ornamental plants but principally as a source of material for use in traditional medicine. The use of  extracts is well established in some countries in Eastern Europe (e.g., Turkey), and Asia (e.g., China, Japan). In traditional Chinese medicine, the medicinal  species is called Bulbus Fritillariae Cirrhosae (BFC), which has been used as a traditional medicine for thousands of years. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on resource investigation of plants of BFC in the last ten years. In this study, we chose 32 traditional producing regions in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to perform an investigation on resource availability of BFC. In five sites we did not find any plants of BFC. Results show that the average number of the plants of BFC per quadrat in 26 sites was less than 7, and the average resource density was <22 mg/m. Habitat types and plant morphology of BFC plants were recorded. Our investigation shows that the area for artificial cultivation of BFC is larger than 400 hm and productivity was higher than 180 t. In addition, the total alkaloid contents of samples from cultivated bases and plantations are higher than that from wild fields. This study suggests that the wild populations of BFC are still at the risk of depletion. Artificial cultivation of BFC might be an important way to resolve the current contradiction between resource protection and resource utilization. In addition, identifying the closest European relatives of the  species used in traditional medicine may resolve this contradiction.",

The widespread application of this material is limited by its brittleness, as evidenced by low tensile elongation at break, impact strength, and fracture toughness. Herein, a multifunctional vegetable oil, acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO), was investigated as a biodegradable, renewable additive to improve the toughness of PLA. AESO was found to be a highly reactive oil, providing a dispersed phase with tunable properties in which the acrylate groups underwent cross-linking at the elevated temperatures required for processing the blends. Additionally, the presence of hydroxyl groups on AESO provided two routes for compatibilization of PLA/AESO blends: (1) reactive compatibilization through the transesterification of AESO and PLA and (2) synthesis of a PLA star polymer with an AESO core.

        "abstract": "Vegetable oils and their fatty acids are promising sources for the derivation of polymers. Long-chain poly(n-alkyl acrylates) and poly(n-alkyl methacrylates) are readily derived from fatty acids through conversion of the carboxylic acid end-group to an acrylate or methacrylate group. The resulting polymers contain long alkyl side-chains with around 10\u201322 carbon atoms. Regardless of the monomer source, the presence of alkyl side-chains in poly(n-alkyl acrylates) and poly(n-alkyl methacrylates) provides a convenient mechanism for tuning their physical properties. The development of structured multicomponent materials, including block copolymers and blends, containing poly(n-alkyl acrylates) and poly(n-alkyl methacrylates) requires knowledge of the thermodynamic interactions governing their self-assembly, typically described by the Flory\u2013Huggins interaction parameter \u03c7. We have investigated the \u03c7 parameter between polystyrene and long-chain poly(n-alkyl acrylate) homopolymers and copolymers: specifically we ...",

        "abstract": "A microphase-separated poly(styrene-b-(lauryl-co-stearyl acrylate)-b-styrene) (SAS) triblock copolymer exhibiting a disordered spherical microstructure with randomly oriented grains was aligned through the application of large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) at a temperature below the order\u2013disorder transition temperature of the triblock copolymer, yet above the glass transition temperature of the polystyrene spherical domains. The thermoplastic elastomeric behavior of the SAS triblock copolymer provided a convenient means to observe the aligned morphology. Following application of LAOS, the specimen was quenched to room temperature (below the glass transition temperature of polystyrene), and small-angle X-ray scattering data were obtained in the three principal shear directions: shear gradient, velocity, and vorticity directions. The analysis revealed that the SAS triblock copolymer formed coexisting face-centered cubic and hexagonally close-packed spherical microstructures. The presence of a close-pa...",

The volume fraction of PDAEMA in the triblock copolymer was varied at constant midblock molecular weight. At lower PDAEMA content, the triblock copolymers exhibited microphase separated morphologies lacking long-range order, which transitioned to a well-defined cylindrical morphology as the PDAEMA content was increased.

        "abstract": "Classical Cepheids are well-known and widely used distance indicators. As distance and extinction are usually degenerate, it is important to develop suitable methods to robustly anchor the distance scale. Here, we introduce a near-infrared (near-IR) optimal distance method to determine both the extinction values of and distances to a large sample of 288 Galactic classical Cepheids. The overall uncertainty in the derived distances is less than 4.9%. We compare our newly determined distances to the Cepheids in our sample with previously published distances to the same Cepheids with Hubble Space Telescope parallax measurements and distances based on the IR surface brightness method, Wesenheit functions, and the main-sequence fitting method. The systematic deviations in the distances determined here with respect to those of previous publications is less than 1-2%. Hence, we constructed Galactic mid-IR period-luminosity (PL) relations for classical Cepheids in the four Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) bands (W1, W2, W3, and W4) and the four Spitzer Space Telescope bands ([3.6], [4.5], [5.8] and [8.0]). Based on our sample of hundreds of Cepheids, the WISE PL relations have been determined for the first time; their dispersion is approximately 0.10 mag. Using the currently most complete sample, our Spitzer PL relations represent a significant improvement in accuracy, especially in the [3.6] band which has the smallest dispersion (0.066 mag). In addition, the average mid-IR extinction curve for Cepheids has been obtained: A_W1/A_Ks=0.560, A_W2/A_Ks=0.479, A_W3/A_Ks=0.507, A_W4/A_Ks=0.406, A_[3.6]/A_Ks=0.481, A_[4.5]/A_Ks=0.469, A_[5.8]/A_Ks=0.427, and A_[8.0]/A_Ks=0.427 mag.",

Careful classification of the new variables results in a tally of 21,427 new EW-type eclipsing binaries, 5654 EA-type eclipsing binaries, 1312 Cepheids, and 1231 RR Lyraes. By comparison with known variables available in the literature, we estimate that the misclassification rate is 5% and 10% for short- and long-period variables, respectively. A detailed comparison of the types, periods, and amplitudes with variables in the Catalina catalog shows that the independently obtained classifications parameters are in excellent agreement. This enlarged sample of variable stars will not only be helpful to study Galactic structure and extinction properties, they can also be used to constrain stellar evolution theory and as potential candidates for the James Webb Space Telescope.",

        "abstract": "Distances and extinction values are usually degenerate. To refine the distance to the general Galactic Center region, a carefully determined extinction law (taking into account the prevailing systematic errors) is urgently needed. We collected data for 55 classical Cepheids projected toward the Galactic Center region to derive the near- to mid-infrared extinction law using three different approaches. The relative extinction values obtained are AJ/AKs = 3.005, AH/AKs = 1.717, A[3.6]/AKs = 0.478, A[4.5]/AKs = 0.341, A[5.8]/AKs = 0.234, A[8.0]/AKs = 0.321, AW1/AKs = 0.506, and AW2/AKs = 0.340. We also calculated the corresponding systematic errors. Compared with previous work, we report an extremely low and steep mid-infrared extinction law. Using a seven-passband u0027optimal distanceu0027 method, we improve the mean distance precision to our sample of 55 Cepheids to 4%. Based on four confirmed Galactic Center Cepheids, a solar Galactocentric distance of R_0 = 8.10pm0.19pm0.22 kpc is determined, featuring an uncertainty that is close to the limiting distance accuracy (2.8%) for Galactic Center Cepheids.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the effects of dust extinction is important to properly interpret observations. The optical total-to-selective extinction ratio, Rv = Av/E(B-V), is widely used to describe extinction variations in ultraviolet and optical bands. Since the Rv=3.1 extinction curve adequately represents the average extinction law of diffuse regions in the Milky Way, it is commonly used to correct observational measurements along sightlines toward diffuse regions in the interstellar medium. However, the Rv value may vary even along different diffuse interstellar medium sightlines. In this paper, we investigate the optical--mid-infrared (mid-IR) extinction law toward a very diffuse region at l = 165 in the Galactic plane, which was selected based on a CO emission map. Adopting red clump stars as extinction tracers, we determine the optical-to-mid-IR extinction law for our diffuse region in the two APASS bands (B, V), the three XSTPS-GAC bands (g, r, i), the three 2MASS bands (J, H, Ks, and the two WISE bands (W1, W2). Specifically, 18 red clump stars were selected from the APOGEE--RC catalog based on spectroscopic data in order to explore the diversity of the extinction law. We find that the optical extinction curves exhibit appreciable diversity. The corresponding Rv ranges from 1.7 to 3.8, while the mean Rv value of 2.8 is consistent with the widely adopted average value of 3.1 for Galactic diffuse clouds. There is no apparent correlation between Rv value and color excess E(B-V) in the range of interest, from 0.2 to 0.6 mag, or with specific visual extinction per kiloparsec, AV/d.",

        "abstract": "W Ursa Majoris (W UMa)-type contact binary systems (CBs) are useful statistical distance indicators because of their large numbers. Here, we establish (orbital) period-luminosity relations (PLRs) in 12 optical-to-mid-infrared bands (GBV RIJHKsW1W2W3W4) based on 183 nearby W UMa-type CBs with accurate Tycho-Gaia parallaxes. The 1{sigma} dispersion of the PLRs decreases from optical to near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. The minimum scatter, 0.16 mag, implies that W UMa-type CBs can be used to recover distances to 7% precision. Applying our newly determined PLRs to 19 open clusters containing W UMa-type CBs demonstrates that the PLR and open cluster CB distance scales are mutually consistent to within 1%. Adopting our PLRs as secondary distance indicators, we compiled a catalog of 55,603 CBs candidates, of which 80% have distance estimates based on a combination of optical, near-, and mid-infrared photometry. Using Fourier decomposition, 27,318 high-probability W UMa-type CBs were selected. The resulting 8% distance accuracy implies that our sam- ple encompasses the largest number of objects with accurate distances within a local volume with a radius of 3 kpc available to date. The distribution of W UMa-type CBs in the Galaxy suggests that in different environments, the CB luminosity function may be different: larger numbers of brighter (longer-period) W UMa-type CBs are found in younger environments.",

        "abstract": "The Milky Way\u2019s neutral hydrogen (H\u2009i) disk is warped and flared1,2. However, a dearth of accurate H\u2009i-based distances has thus far prevented the development of an accurate Galactic Disk model. Moreover, the extent to which our Galaxy\u2019s stellar and gas disk morphologies are mutually consistent is also unclear. Classical Cepheids, primary distance indicators with distance accuracies of 3\u20135% (ref. 3), offer a unique opportunity to develop an intuitive and accurate three-dimensional picture. Here, we establish a robust Galactic Disk model based on 1,339 classical Cepheids. We provide strong evidence that the warp\u2019s line of nodes is not oriented in the Galactic Centre\u2013Sun direction. Instead, it subtends a mean angle of 17.5\u00b0\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00b0 (formal) \u00b1\u20093\u00b0 (systematic) and exhibits a leading spiral pattern. Our Galaxy thus follows Briggs\u2019 rule for spiral galaxies4, which suggests that the origin of the warp is associated with torques forced by the massive inner disk5. The stellar disk traced by Cepheids follows the gas disk in terms of their amplitudes; the stellar disk extends to at least 20\u2009kpc (refs. 6,7). This morphology provides a crucial, updated map for studies of the kinematics and archaeology of the Galactic Disk.",

        "abstract": "A precise interstellar dust extinction law is critically important to interpret observations. There are two indicators of extinction: the color excess ratio (CER) and the relative extinction. Compared to the CER, the wavelength-dependent relative extinction is more challenging to be determined. In this work, we combine spectroscopic, astrometric, and photometric data to derive high-precision CERs and relative extinction from optical to mid-infrared (IR) bands. A group of 61,111 red clump (RC) stars are selected as tracers by stellar parameters from APOGEE survey. The multi-band photometric data are collected from Gaia, APASS, SDSS, Pan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE surveys. For the first time, we calibrate the curvature of CERs in determining CERs E(lambda-GRP)/E(GBP-GRP) from color excess -- color excess diagrams. Through elaborate uncertainties analysis, we conclude that the precision of our CERs is significantly improved (sigma u003c 0.015). With parallaxes from Gaia DR2, we calculate the relative extinction A_GBP/A_GRP for 5,051 RC stars. By combining the CERs with the A_GBP/A_GRP, the optical -- mid-IR extinction A_lambda/A_GRP have been determined in total twenty-one bands. Given no bias toward any specific environment, our extinction law represents the average extinction law with the total-to-selective extinction ratio Rv=3.16+-0.15. Our observed extinction law supports an adjustment in parameters of CCM Rv=3.1 curve together with the near-IR power law index alpha=2.07+-0.03. The relative extinction values of HST and JWST near-IR bandpasses are predicted in 2.5% precision. As the observed reddening/extinction tracks are curved, the curvature correction needs to be considered when applying extinction correction.",

        "abstract": "A precise measure of the mid-infrared interstellar extinction law is crucial to the investigation of the properties of interstellar dust, especially of the grains in the large size end. Based on the stellar parameters derived from the SDSS-III/APOGEE spectroscopic survey, we select a large sample of G- and K-type giants as the tracers of the Galactic mid-infrared extinction. We calculate the intrinsic stellar color excesses from the stellar effective temperatures and use them to determine the mid-infrared extinction for a given line of sight. For the entire sky of the Milky Way surveyed by APOGEE, we derive the extinction (relative to the K$_{rm S}$ band at wavelength $lambda=2.16mu$m) for the four emph{WISE} bands at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22$mu$m, the four emph{Spitzer}/IRAC bands at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8$mu$m, the emph{Spitzer}/MIPS24 band at 23.7$mu$m and for the first time, the emph{AKARI}/S9W band at 8.23$mu$m. Our results agree with previous works in that the extinction curve is flat in the ~3--8$mu$m wavelength range and is generally consistent with the $R_V=5.5$ model curve except our determination exceeds the model prediction in the emph{WISE}/W4 band. Although some previous works found that the mid-IR extinction law appears to vary with the extinction depth $A_{rm{K_S}}$, no noticeable variation has been found in this work. The uncertainties are analyzed in terms of the bootstrap resampling method and Monte-Carlo simulation and are found to be rather small.",

        "abstract": "The characteristics of IR properties and MIR variability of RSGs in the LMC are analyzed based on 12 bands of NIR to MIR co-added data from 2MASS, Spitzer and WISE, and $sim$6.6 years of MIR time-series data collected by the ALLWISE and NEOWISE-R projects. 773 RSGs candidates were compiled from the literature and verified by using the CMD, SED and MIR variability. About 15% of valid targets in the $IRAC1-IRAC2$/$IRAC2-IRAC3$ diagram may show PAH emission. We show that arbitrary dereddening Q parameters related to the IRAC4, S9W, WISE3, WISE4, and MIPS24 bands could be constructed based on a precise measurement of MIR interstellar extinction law. Several peculiar outliers in our sample are discussed, in which one outlier might be a RSG right before the explosion or an x-AGB star in the very late evolutionary stage based on the MIR spectrum and photometry. There are 744 identified RSGs in the final sample having both the WISE1- and WISE2-band time-series data. The results show that the MIR variability is increasing along with the increasing of brightness. There is a relatively tight correlation between the MIR variability, MLR, and the warm dust or continuum, where the MIR variability is evident for the targets with $K_S-WISE3u003e1.0~mag$ and $WISE4u003c6.5~mag$, while the rest of the targets show much smaller MIR variability. The MIR variability is also correlated with the MLR for which targets with larger variability also show larger MLR with an approximate upper limit of $-6.1~M_odot/yr^{-1}$. Both the variability and the luminosity may be important for the MLR since the WISE4-band flux is increasing exponentially along with the degeneracy of luminosity and variability. The identified RSG sample has been compared with the theoretical evolutionary models and shown that the discrepancy between observation and evolutionary models can be mitigated by considering both variability and extinction.",

The compressive strength was also tested. Test results indicate that high curing temperature is effective in promoting the pozzolanic reaction of GP, which contributes to improve the mechanical and microstructure performance. Besides, pozzolanic reaction is found around the unhydrated GP particle and formed C\u2013S\u2013H gel instead of ASR. This research can provide a new approach of improving the reaction activity of GP and lay a theoretical basis for the application of GP in precast concrete products, mass concrete or concrete construction during hot season.",

The methods evaluated include the harmonic method, the conduction-convection method, and the temperature integral method. Soil heat storage calculated using the harmonic method provides the closest match with measured values. The conduction-convection method underestimates nighttime soil heat storage. The temperature integral method best captures fluctuations in soil heat storage on sub-diurnal timescales, but overestimates the amplitude and peak values of the diurnal cycle. The relative performance of each method varies with the underlying land surface. The land surface energy balance is evaluated using observations of soil heat flux at 5-cm depth and estimates of ground heat flux adjusted to account for soil heat storage. The energy balance closure rate increases and energy balance is improved when the ground heat flux is adjusted to account for soil heat storage. The results achieved using the harmonic and temperature integral methods are superior to those achieved using the conduction-convection method.",

The alkali reactivity of waste glass aggregate is examined by two methods in accordance with the China Test Code SL352-2006. The potential of WGP to control the ASR expansion is determined in terms of mean diameter, specific surface area, content of WGP and curing temperature. Two mathematical models are developed to estimate the inhibitory efficiency of WGP. These studies show that there is ASR risk with an ASR expansion rate over 0.2% when the sand contains more than 30% glass aggregate. However, WGP can effectively control the ASR expansion and inhibit the expansion rate induced by the glass aggregate to be under 0.1%. The two mathematical models have good simulation results, which can be used to evaluate the inhibitory effect of WGP on ASR risk.",

        "abstract": "Rapid development has led to frequent haze in Beijing. With mountains and sea surrounding Beijing, the pollution is found to be influenced by the mountain-plain breeze and sea-land breeze in complex ways. Meanwhile, the presence of aerosols may affect the surface energy balance and impact these boundary layer (BL) processes. The effects of BL processes on aerosol pollution and the feedback between aerosol and BL processes are not yet clearly understood. Thus, the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) is used to investigate the possible effects and feedbacks during a haze episode on 23 September 2011. Influenced by the onshore prevailing wind, sea-breeze, and upslope breeze, about 45\u00a0% of surface particulate matter (PM)2.5 in Beijing are found to be contributed by its neighbor cities through regional transport. In the afternoon, the development of upslope breeze suppresses the growth of BL in Beijing by imposing a relatively low thermal stable layer above the BL, which exacerbates the pollution. Two kinds of feedback during the daytime are revealed as follows: (1) as the aerosols absorb and scatter the solar radiation, the surface net radiation and sensible heat flux are decreased, while BL temperature is increased, resulting in a more stable and shallower BL, which leads to a higher surface PM2.5 concentration in the morning and (2) in the afternoon, as the presence of aerosols increases the BL temperature over plains, the upslope breeze is weakened, and the boundary layer height (BLH) over Beijing is heightened, resulting in the decrease of the surface PM2.5 concentration there.",

        "abstract": "Accurate hydrological simulations in high-altitude mountainous basins are important for optimizing reservoir operations in hydropower production and flood control. However, the simulations experience substantial uncertainties from the sparse precipitation measurements over complex mountainous topography and the imperfect hydrological process representations over the heterogeneous surface. At the Daduhe river basin, which is a high-altitude mountainous river basin located in the eastern slope of the Tibetan Plateau, daily streamflow over the 2-year period of 2014 and 2015 is simulated using the Noah land surface model with multi-parameterizations (NoahMP) and Routing Application for Parallel computation of Discharge (RAPID) coupled model driven by the Chinese Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD). Two different runoff parameterization schemes of NoahMP are used for the simulations: SIMGM, which is derived from TOPMODEL and parameterizes surface runoff using water table depth, and NOAH, in which surface runoff is parameterized using soil moisture content based on the Philip infiltration model. The simulated streamflow is evaluated at two mainstream gauges on the Daduhe river, Tongjiezi and Longtoushi, in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), correlation coefficient, bias, and standard deviation. The uncertainty of the simulated streamflow is attributed to different runoff parameterization in NoahMP, the flow wave celerity parameter of RAPID, and the forcing CMFD precipitation data.  Results show that the NOAH runoff parameterization scheme outperforms the SIMGM scheme. NOAH satisfactorily reproduced the observed streamflow anomaly and flood timing at the two mainstream gauges, and the correlation coefficients between the simulated and observed streamflow are above 0.85. The NSE for NOAH is approximately 0.3. The mathematical decomposition of NSE reveals that the relatively low NSE value is mainly attributed to the significant streamflow bias. Without the bias, NSE can be improved to approximately 0.7. The bias shows little dependency on the flow wave celerity parameter of RAPID and the runoff parameterization of NoahMP, whereas it closely corresponds to the forcing CMFD precipitation data bias. Comparing the estimated precipitation from Budykos curve and the observed streamflow, CMFD significantly underestimates the basin-averaged precipitation, which leads to the significant streamflow underestimation in the hydrological simulations. CMFD does not correctly represent the orographic effects on precipitation in the Daduhe river basin. Comparing the rain gauge measurements located in low-altitude river valleys, the CMFD precipitation is significant underestimated, suggesting a significantly underestimation in high-altitude precipitation.  This study shows that streamflow bias can be reduced by densifying rain gauges at high altitudes. Despite the bias, the NoahMP RAPID coupled model can satisfactorily reproduce streamflow anomalies and flood timing in mountainous basins. As a dam model is already included, the coupled model can be further used to optimize reservoir operations for hydropower production and flood control.",

        "abstract": "Different biological subtype breast cancers respond differently to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but it is unknown whether neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy leads to different long-term survival in each specific subtype although equal outcomes have been reported in general population. This study sought to clarify whether the selection of either neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy was linked to a differential survival benefit based on breast cancer subtypes.A prospectively maintained breast cancer database was queried from 2000 to 2008. All patients with a diagnosis of stage II and III breast cancer who received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy were identified, only patients receiving docetaxel and epirubicin (TA) regimen were included. Patients were divided according to the administration of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. The biological subtypes were determined by immunohistochemical tests. The outcomes between neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy were compared in each different subtype. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated, and the Cox model was used to estimate the association between death risk and chemotherapy timing while adjusting for potentially confounding factors. P values < .05 were considered statistically significant.Of the 406 patients included, 201 (49.5%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and 205 (50.5%) received an adjuvant TA regimen. Patients with the HER2+ and TNBC subtypes showed significantly higher pCR rates than patients with luminal types (P\u200a<\u200a.05). In general population, the neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy groups showed little survival variance (HR=1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) .69-1.91, P=.60). In luminal B-like patients, neoadjuvant chemotherapy led to worse overall survival (OS) than adjuvant therapy (HR=2.92, 95%CI 1.20 to 8.31, P\u200a=\u200a.02). In patients with the HER2+ subtype, neoadjuvant treatment corresponded to better OS (HR\u200a=\u200a.10, 95%CI .02-.58, P\u200a=\u200a.01). In contrast, patients with luminal A-like (HR\u200a=\u200a1.14, 95%CI .53-2.43, P\u200a=\u200a.74) and TNBC disease (HR\u200a=\u200a1.00, 95%CI .27-3.73, P\u200a=\u200a>.99) who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed equivalent OS when compared to patients undergoing adjuvant therapy.Neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy results in a disparate impact on overall survival among patients with variant subtype breast cancer. When neoadjuvant chemotherapy was given, luminal B-like patients showed worse outcome, while patients with HER2+ disease had better OS. Prospective studies are necessary to determine and optimize the timing of chemotherapy for breast cancers with different molecular backgrounds.",

However, different molecular subtypes show variant response to chemotherapy, which is associated with different long-term prognosis. This study was to clarify whether molecular subtypes lead to different outcome between neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: We identified 406 patients with stage II-III breast cancer who were treated with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy between 2000 and 2008. To minimize the confounding bias, only patients received taxanes and anthracycline based regimen (TA) were included. Cases were divided according to receipt of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy.

This study was undertaken to examine current practice pattern in China, evaluate the impact of Z0011 on practice, and determine the exportability of the Z0011criteria for selecting Chinese patients who are eligible for omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) with positive SLNs. Methods: A electronic survey about Z0011 trial was distributed to members of Surgical Group of Breast Cancer attached to Chinese Preventive Medicine Association. Surgeons were questioned about the impact of the trial results on their practice. At the mean time, we collected 658 consecutive patients with ALND after positive SLN biopsy from five centers\u2019 database and grouped them as eligible or ineligible for omitting ALND according to Z0011 criteria. The eligible group was compared with the cohort included in the Z0011 trial and with the ineligible group. Results: Of the 427 respondents, 11...",

The results also imply that different chemoprevention strategies may be appropriate for selected individuals, highlighting the need to be particularly aware of women with a high waist/hip ratio but normal body mass index. Given the lack of any proven pharmacologic intervention for estrogen receptor negative breast cancer, stricter weight-control measures may be advised in these individuals.",

        "abstract": "Autoantibodies can be present years to decades before the onset of disease manifestations in autoimmunity. This finding suggests that the initial autoimmune trigger involves a peripheral lymphoid component, which ultimately drives disease pathology in local tissues later in life. We show that Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome manifestations that develop in aged NOD.H-2h4 mice were driven by and dependent on peripheral dysregulation that arose in early life. Specifically, elimination of spontaneous germinal centers in spleens of young NOD.H-2h4 mice by transient blockade of CD40 ligand (CD40L) or splenectomy abolished Sj\u00f6gren's pathology of aged mice. Strikingly, a single injection of anti-CD40L at 4 weeks of age prevented tertiary follicle neogenesis and greatly blunted the formation of key autoantibodies implicated in glandular pathology, including anti-muscarinic receptor antibodies. Microarray profiling of the salivary gland characterized the expression pattern of genes that increased with disease progression and showed that early anti-CD40L greatly repressed B cell function while having a broader effect on multiple biological pathways, including interleukin-12 and interferon signaling. A single prophylactic treatment with anti-CD40L also inhibited the development of autoimmune thyroiditis and diabetes in NOD.H-2h4 and nonobese diabetic mice, respectively, supporting a key role for CD40L in the pathophysiology of several autoimmune models. These results strongly suggest that early peripheral immune dysregulation gives rise to autoimmune manifestations later in life, and for diseases predated by autoantibodies, early prophylactic intervention with biologics may prove efficacious.",

Here we show that an unusual CD11cT-bet B cell subset, with a unique expression profile including chemokine receptors consistent with migration to target tissues, is expanded in SLE patients, present in nephrotic kidney, enriched for autoreactive specificities and correlates with defined clinical manifestations. IL-21 can potently induce CD11cT-bet B cells and promote the differentiation of these cells into Ig-secreting autoreactive plasma cells. While murine studies have identified a role for T-bet-expressing B cells in autoimmunity, this study describes and exemplifies the importance of CD11cT-bet B cells in human SLE.",

        "abstract": "We examined a large cohort of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and found an unusual B cell subset highly expanded. These B cells displayed a unique phenotype and expressed antigens not present on other B cell populations, including high densities of CD11c, FcRL5, and the T-box  transcription factor,  T-bet, but unexpectedly, were CD40 lo  and CD24 \u2212 . Although these CD11c hi  cells were largely negative for the memory B cell antigen CD27, their telomere length was consistent with memory, rather than naive B cells. Notably, the increase of CD11c hi  B cells in SLE significantly correlated with disease severity scores as well as with other markers of disease activity including serum IL-21. While memory B cells characteristically express low densities of IL-21R, these memory CD11c hi  B cells were IL-21R bright. In culture, IL-21 was a potent driver of CD11c expression when B cells were co-stimulated through the B cell receptor and CD40. Lastly, CD11c hi  B cells in SLE significantly correlated with blood plasma cells as well as a distinct set of autoantibodies, and importantly, were efficiently driven to differentiate into plasma cells in response to activated T cells. These data indicate that among the many roles of IL-21 in regard to B cell activation and differentiation, this pleiotropic cytokine also regulates CD11c hi  B cells, and presumably contributes to autoimmunity through the differentiation of autoreactive CD11c hi  B cells in SLE.",

        "abstract": "Intimal macrophages are determinant cells for atherosclerotic lesion formation by releasing inflammatory factors and taking up oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) via scavenger receptors, primarily the CD36 receptor. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has a potential to decrease cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory responses in macrophages. We made EGCG-loaded nanoparticles (Enano) using phosphatidylcholine, kolliphor HS15, alpha-tocopherol acetate and EGCG. 1-(Palmitoyl)-2-(5-keto-6-octene-dioyl) phosphatidylcholine (KOdiA-PC), a CD36-targeted ligand found on oxLDL, was incorporated on the surface of Enano to make ligand-Enano (L-Enano). The objectives of this study are to deliver EGCG to macrophages via CD36-targeted L-Enano and to determine its antiatherogenic bioactivities. The optimized nanoparticles obtained in our study were spherical and around 108 nm in diameter, and had about 10% of EGCG loading capacity and 96% of EGCG encapsulation efficiency. Compared to Enano, CD36-targeted L-Enano had significantly higher binding affinity to and uptake by macrophages at the same pattern as oxLDL. CD36-targeted L-Enano dramatically improved EGCG stability, increased macrophage EGCG content, delivered EGCG to macrophage cytosol and avoided lysosomes. L-Enano significantly decreased macrophage mRNA levels and protein secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, but did not significantly change macrophage cholesterol content. The innovative CD36-targeted nanoparticles may facilitate targeted delivery of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic compounds to intimal macrophages for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis with enhanced efficacy and decreased side effects.",

        "abstract": "There are great needs in developing compact-size kilohertz (kHz) high-frequency (HF) electrochemical capacitors (ECs) for ripple current filtering and environmental vibration energy harvesting. However, the previously demonstrated electrodes are generally limited to a very small areal capacitance density at 120 Hz due to sub-\u03bcm thick electrode used for meeting frequency requirement, which renders them unsuitable for practical ECs. Here, using crosslinked carbon nanofiber aerogel, derived from rapid microwave plasma pyrolysis of bacterial cellulose that was synthesized in a fermentation process, we demonstrated kHz HF-ECs with areal capacitance density as high as 4.5 mF cm\u22122 at 120 Hz in an aqueous electrolyte. The cruciality of plasma pyrolysis on high frequency response of the derived carbon nanofiber aerogel was discussed. The electrode performance in an organic electrolyte was further studied for operation in a large potential window of more than 3 V. Using such kHz HF-ECs, we further demonstrated their applications in rapid pulse energy storage for vibrational energy harvesting, as well as in ripple current filtering for AC/DC conversion. The promising results suggest this technology has great potential for developing practical compact HF-ECs in substitution of electrolytic capacitors for several crucial applications.",

        "abstract": "Trans-resveratrol (R) has a potential to increase energy expenditure via inducing browning in white adipose tissue. However, its low levels of aqueous solubility, stability, and poor bioavailability limit its application. We have successfully synthesized biocompatible, and biodegradable R encapsulated lipid nanocarriers (R-nano), and R encapsulated liposomes (R-lipo). The mean particle size of R-nano and R-lipo were 140\u202fnm and 110\u202fnm, respectively, and their polydispersity index values were less than 0.2. Nanoencapsulation significantly increased aqueous solubility and enhanced chemical stability of R, especially at 37\u202f\u00b0C. R-lipo had higher physical and chemical stability than R-nano while R-nano had more prolonged release than R-lipo. Both R-nano and R-lipo increased cellular R content in 3T3-L1 cells. Both R-nano and R-lipo dose-dependently induced uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) mRNA expression and decreased white specific marker insulin growth factor binding protein 3 expression under isoproterenol (ISO)-stimulated conditions. At the low dose (5\u202f\u03bcM), nanoencapsulated compared to native R enhanced UCP1 and beige marker CD137 expression under ISO-stimulated conditions. Compared to R-nano, R-lipo had better biological activity, possibly due to its higher physical and chemical stability at the room and body temperature. Taken together, our study demonstrates that nanoencapsulation increased R's aqueous solubility and stability, which led to enhanced browning of white adipocytes. Even though both R-lipo and R-nano increased R's browning activities, their differential characteristics need to be considered in obesity treatment.",

        "abstract": "Indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, has been shown to induce white adipocyte differentiation; however, its roles in brown adipocyte differentiation, and activation in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and obesity are unknown. To address this issue, we treated mouse pre-brown cells with different doses of indomethacin, and delivered indomethacin to interscapular BAT (iBAT) of obese mice using implanted osmotic pumps. Indomethacin dose-dependently increased brown adipocyte differentiation, and upregulated both mRNA and protein expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma (\u03b3) coactivator 1-alpha. The mechanistic study showed that indomethacin significantly activated the reporter driven by PPAR response element, indicating that indomethacin may work as a PPAR\u03b3 agonist in this cell line. Consistently, indomethacin significantly decreased iBAT mass and fasting blood glucose levels in the high-fat diet induced obese (DIO) mice. Histological analysis showed that brown adipocytes of indomethacin-treated mice contained smaller lipid droplets compared to the control mice, suggesting that indomethacin alleviated the \"whitening\" of BAT induced by the high-fat diet. Moreover, indomethacin significantly increased UCP1 mRNA expression in the iBAT. Taken together, this study indicates that indomethacin can promote mouse brown adipocyte differentiation, and might increase brown fat and glucose oxidation capacity in DIO mice.",

        "abstract": "Paraben esters and their salts are widely used as preservatives in cosmetics, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and foods. We previously reported that parabens promoted adipocyte differentiation in vitro and increased adiposity but suppressed serum marker of bone formation in vivo. Here, we investigated the effects of parabens (methylparaben and butylparaben) on modulating cell fate of multipotent stem cell line C3H10T1/2. Both parabens modulated adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells in vitro. Butylparaben markedly promoted adipogenic differentiation, but suppressed osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation whereas methylparaben showed similar but less pronounced effects. Moreover, butylparaben, but not methylparaben, was shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b3 whereas neither of the paraben was shown to activate glucocorticoid receptor (GR) responsive reporter in C3H10T1/2 cells. The adipogenic effects of butylparaben were significantly attenuated by PPAR\u03b3 knockdown, but not by GR knockdown. In contrast, paraben's effects on osteoblast differentiation were affected by both knockdowns. Collectively, the results demonstrate opposing effects of parabens on adipogenic and osteoblastogenic/chondrogenic differentiation of multipotent stem cells. In light of the recent findings that parabens are detected in human placenta and milk, our studies provide rationales to study paraben exposure during early development of life in the future.",

        "title": "Detection and treatment of atherosclerosis using nanoparticles.",
        "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is the key pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, which is a silent killer and a leading cause of death in the United States. Atherosclerosis starts with the adhesion of inflammatory monocytes on the activated endothelial cells in response to inflammatory stimuli. These monocytes can further migrate into the intimal layer of the blood vessel where they differentiate into macrophages, which take up oxidized low-density lipoproteins and release inflammatory factors to amplify the local inflammatory response. After accumulation of cholesterol, the lipid-laden macrophages are transformed into foam cells, the hallmark of the early stage of atherosclerosis. Foam cells can die from apoptosis or necrosis, and the intracellular lipid is deposed in the artery wall forming lesions. The angiogenesis for nurturing cells is enhanced during lesion development. Proteases released from macrophages, foam cells, and other cells degrade the fibrous cap of the lesion, resulting in rupture of the lesion and subsequent thrombus formation. Thrombi can block blood circulation, which represents a major cause of acute heart events and stroke. There are generally no symptoms in the early stages of atherosclerosis. Current detection techniques cannot easily, safely, and effectively detect the lesions in the early stages, nor can they characterize the lesion features such as the vulnerability. While the available therapeutic modalities cannot target specific molecules, cells, and processes in the lesions, nanoparticles appear to have a promising potential in improving atherosclerosis detection and treatment via targeting the intimal macrophages, foam cells, endothelial cells, angiogenesis, proteolysis, apoptosis, and thrombosis. Indeed, many nanoparticles have been developed in improving blood lipid profile and decreasing inflammatory response for enhancing therapeutic efficacy of drugs and decreasing their side effects.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Skeletal muscle disorders including sarcopenia are prevalent during the complex biological process of aging. Loss of muscle mass and strength commonly seen in sarcopenia is induced by impaired neuromuscular innervation, transition of skeletal muscle fiber type, and reduced muscle regenerative capacity, all attributable to chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Current literature suggests that vitamin E molecules ( \u03b1 -,  \u03b2 -,  \u03b3 -,  \u03b4 -tocopherols and the corresponding tocotrienols) with their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capabilities may mitigate age-associated skeletal dysfunction and enhance muscle regeneration, thus attenuating sarcopenia. Preclinical and human experimental studies show that vitamin E benefits myoblast proliferation, differentiation, survival, membrane repair, mitochondrial efficiency, muscle mass, muscle contractile properties, and exercise capacity. Limited number of human cross-sectional observational studies reveal positive associations between serum tocopherol level and muscle strength. Several factors, including difficulties in validating vitamin E intake and deficiency, variations in muscle-protective activity and metabolism of diverse forms of vitamin E, and lack of understanding of the mechanisms of action, preclude randomized clinical trials of vitamin E in people with sarcopenia. Future research should consider long-term clinical trials of with adequate sample size, advanced imaging technology and omics approaches to investigate underlying mechanisms and assess clinically meaningful parameters such as muscle strength, physical performance, and muscle mass in sarcopenia prevention and/or treatment.",

While the anti-inflammatory and hypotriglyceridemic properties of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are well known, their antiobesity effects and efficacy against metabolic syndrome, especially in humans, are still under debate. In animal models, evidence consistently suggests a role for n-3 PUFAs in reducing fat mass, particularly in the retroperitoneal and epididymal regions. In humans, however, published research suggests that though n-3 PUFAs may not aid weight loss, they may attenuate further weight gain and could be useful in the diet or as a supplement to help maintain weight loss. Proposed mechanisms by which n-3 PUFAs may work to improve body composition and counteract obesity-related metabolic changes include modulating lipid metabolism; regulating adipokines, such as adiponectin and leptin; alleviating adipose tissue inflammation; promoting adipogenesis and altering epigenetic mechanisms.",

Binder-free EOG/CMF electrodes were fabricated in a one-step 5-min plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition process, where cellulose fiber sheets were rapidly pyrolyzed by high-temperature plasma, while EOG simultaneously formed on the developing CMFs.

        "abstract": "Mirabegron, a \u03b23-adrenergic receptor agonist, has been shown to stimulate activity of brown fat and increase resting metabolic rate in humans. However, it is unknown if mirabegron can reduce body weight and improve metabolic health. We investigated the anti-obesity effects of mirabegron using both in vitro and in vivo models. Mouse brown preadipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells were treated with different concentrations of mirabegron (0.03-3 \u00b5g/ml), and expression of brown fat-related genes was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Furthermore, male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet for 10 weeks, and mirabegron (2 mg/kg body weight) or a vehicle control was delivered to interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) using ALZET\u00ae osmotic pumps from week 7 to 10. Metabolic parameters and tissues were analyzed. In both mouse brown preadipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells, mirabegron stimulated uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression. In animal studies, mirabegron-treated mice had lower body weight and adiposity. Lipid droplets in iBAT of mirabegron-treated mice were fewer and smaller in size compared to those from vehicle-treated mice. Haemotoxylin and Eosin staining and immunohistochemistry indicated that mirabegron increased the abundance of beige cells in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT). Compared to vehicle-treated mice, mirabegron-treated mice had higher gene expression of UCP1 (14-fold) and cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor alpha-like effector A (4-fold) in iWAT. Furthermore, mirabegron-treated mice had improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Taken together, mirabegron enhances UCP1 expression and promotes browning of iWAT which are accompanied by improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and prevention from high-fat diet-induced obesity.",

        "abstract": "Introduction  Osteoporosis is a major health concern in postmenopausal women, and oxidative stress contributes to the development of bone loss. Cellular studies and ovariectomised rat model mimicking bone loss in postmenopausal women show the bone-protective effect of tocotrienols (TTs) with antioxidant capability. We aim to access the safety and efficacy of TT consumption for bone health in postmenopausal women.  Methods and analysis  In this 12-week randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled trial for the effects of dietary TT supplementation in postmenopausal women, postmenopausal women aged 45\u2005years and older with at least 1\u2005year after menopause and bone mineral density T-score at the spine and/or hip 2.5 or more below the reference values will be randomly assigned to 3 daily supplements: (1) placebo group receiving 860\u2005mg olive oil, (2) low TT group receiving 430\u2005mg of 70% pure TTs (containing 300\u2005mg TT) and (3) high TT group receiving 860\u2005mg of 70% pure TTs (600\u2005mg TT). The primary outcome measure will be urinary  N -terminal telopeptide. The secondary outcome measures will be serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand, osteoprotegerin, urinary 8-hydroxy-2\u2019-deoxyguanosine and quality of life. At 0, 6 and 12\u2005weeks, the following will be assessed: (1) primary and secondary outcome measures; (2) serum TT and tocopherol concentrations; (3) physical activity and food frequency questionnaires. Liver function will be monitored every 6\u2005weeks for safety. \u2018Intent-to-treat\u2019 principle will be employed for data analysis. A model of repeated measurements with random effect error terms will be applied. Analysis of covariance, \u03c7 2  analysis and regression will be used for comparisons.  Ethics and dissemination  This study was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. The findings of this trial will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal in the areas of bone or nutrition and international conferences.  Trial registration number  NCT02058420; results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Highly insulating nature of sulfur species and the shuttling effects caused by soluble lithium polysulfides have been blamed for hindering the development of lithium\u2013sulfur (Li\u2013S) batteries. A variety of carbonaceous materials have been investigated to ameliorate these problems by providing a conductive matrix with physical trapping and chemical binding capabilities, but inevitably resulted in typically low sulfur content in the cathode and hence low gross specific energy when considering all the active and inactive masses. A highly conductive and crosslinked matrix with superior trapping and binding capability to sulfur species but a very low mass density is essential. Herein, crosslinked carbon nanofiber aerogel (CNFA) with extremely low density, attained from pyrolysis of bacterial cellulose (BC) aerogel, was studied for sulfur cathodes. With its unique combination of several merits, in particular the capability of strong absorption of catholyte, CNFA based sulfur electrodes exhibit outstanding performance. With 75% sulfur content of the gross cathode mass, cells demonstrated an initial capacity of 1360\u00a0mA\u00a0h\u00a0g \u22121  at 0.2\u00a0C, and exhibited excellent cycling stability with 76% of the initial capacity retained after 200 cycles.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of green tea polyphenols (GTP) supplementation on body composition, bone properties, and serum markers in obese rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a caloric restricted diet (CRD). Forty-eight female rats were fed an HFD ad libitum for 4 months, and then either continued on the HFD or the CRD with or without 0.5% GTP in water. Body composition, bone efficacy, and serum markers were measured. We hypothesized that GTP supplementation would improve body composition, mitigate bone loss, and restore bone microstructure in obese animals fed either HFD or CRD. CRD lowered percent fat mass; bone mass and trabecular number of tibia, femur and lumbar vertebrae; femoral strength; trabecular and cortical thickness of tibia; insulin-like growth factor-I and leptin. CRD also increased percent fat-free mass; trabecular separation of tibia and femur; eroded surface of tibia; bone formation rate and erosion rate at tibia shaft; and adiponectin. GTP supplementation increased femoral mass and strength (P = .026), trabecular thickness (P = .012) and number (P = .019), and cortical thickness of tibia (P < .001), and decreased trabecular separation (P = .021), formation rate (P < .001), and eroded surface (P < .001) at proximal tibia, and insulin-like growth factor-I and leptin. There were significant interactions (diet type \u00d7 GTP) on osteoblast surface/bone surface, mineral apposition rate at periosteal and endocortical bones, periosteal bone formation rate, and trabecular thickness at femur and lumbar vertebrate (P < .05). This study demonstrates that GTP supplementation for 4 months benefited body composition and improved bone microstructure and strength in obese rats fed with HFD or HFD followed by CRD diet.",

        "abstract": "Phosphate is a typical limiting nutrient in oligotrophic oceans and its concentration can be as low as the nanomolar level, especially in surface seawater. Different techniques for nanomolar level phosphate determination have been studied, most of which are automatic and high throughput methods based on flow analysis. However, these techniques need expensive commercial or laboratory-made instruments, and experienced operators. This study reports an operationally convenient, sensitive and practical method for the determination of nanomolar dissolved reactive phosphorus in aqueous samples, based on classic phosphomolybdenum blue chemistry and solid phase extraction methodology. Under acidic conditions, the formed phosphomolybdenum blue can be preconcentrated on a hydrophilic-lipophilic balance solid phase cartridge, eluted with 0.2 M NaOH, and detected at 700 nm after color recovery with the addition of more reagents. After optimization of the recovery reagents volumes, the effectiveness of the method was evaluated. This simple manual method is sensitive (detection limit of 3.0 nM using 50 mL sample, which can be lowered to \u223c 1 nM by preconcentrating more sample), reproducible (relative standard deviation of 2.6%, n\u2009=\u200981, with different operators), free of interferences from salinity (0\u201335), silicate (up to 200 \u03bcM) and arsenate (up to 100 nM) and suitable for different aqueous matrixes. The effects of a series of phosphorus-containing compounds (n\u2009=\u200913) were evaluated, with more than half showing hydrolysis during the experiment. This method was applied to determine the phosphate concentration in samples collected from the Western Pacific.",

        "abstract": "2-Aminoethylphosphonic acid (2-AEP) and 2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (2-AP3) are two types of abundant and ubiquitous naturally occurring phosphonates used as sources of phosphorus by many prokaryotic lineages. The potential utilization mechanism of 2-AEP and 2-AP3 in eukaryotic phytoplankton is currently under investigation. However, the lack of suitable analytical methods in saline samples are the limitation of such researches. Herein, a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for monitoring 2-AEP and 2-AP3 using precolumn fluorescence derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde-ethanethiol (OPA-ET) in seawater matrix was developed. The derivatization procedure and HPLC conditions were carefully examined, which included optimization of the fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths, the ammonium acetate concentration and pH of the mobile phase, the OPA-ET reagent content and composition and derivatization time. Because increasing salinity was observed to lower the derivatization efficiency, working standards were freshly prepared in artificial seawater with the same salinity as that of the samples for the quantification of 2-AEP and 2-AP3. The developed HPLC method showed a wide linear response with high linearity (R\u2009>\u20090.999) and high repeatability at three concentration levels. The relative standard deviation was less than 4.1% for 2-AEP and less than 1.7% for 2-AP3 (n\u2009=\u20097). The limits of detection for 2-AEP and 2-AP3 in artificial seawater matrix were both 12.0\u2009\u03bcg/L. The recoveries were 83.0-104% for 2-AEP and 72.6-98.6% for 2-AP3 in different aqueous samples, including algal culture medium prepared with filtered seawater. These results indicated the matrix effect of this method was insignificant.",

        "title": "Automated determination of nitrate plus nitrite in aqueous samples with flow injection analysis using vanadium (III) chloride as reductant",
        "abstract": "Determination of nitrate in aqueous samples is an important analytical objective for environmental monitoring and assessment. Here we report the first automatic flow injection analysis (FIA) of nitrate (plus nitrite) using VCl3 as reductant instead of the well-known but toxic cadmium column for reducing nitrate to nitrite. The reduced nitrate plus the nitrite originally present in the sample react with the Griess reagent (sulfanilamide and N-1-naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride) under acidic condition. The resulting pink azo dye can be detected at 540 nm. The Griess reagent and VCl3 are used as a single mixed reagent solution to simplify the system. The various parameters of the FIA procedure including reagent composition, temperature, volume of the injection loop, and flow rate were carefully investigated and optimized via univariate experimental design. Under the optimized conditions, the linear range and detection limit of this method are 0-100 \u00b5M (R(2)=0.9995) and 0.1 \u00b5M, respectively. The targeted analytical range can be easily extended to higher concentrations by selecting alternative detection wavelengths or increasing flow rate. The FIA system provides a sample throughput of 20 h(-1), which is much higher than that of previously reported manual methods based on the same chemistry. National reference solutions and different kinds of aqueous samples were analyzed with our method as well as the cadmium column reduction method. The results from our method agree well with both the certified value and the results from the cadmium column reduction method (no significant difference with P=0.95). The spiked recovery varies from 89% to 108% for samples with different matrices, showing insignificant matrix interference in this method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A compact loop flow analyzer was developed for automated determination of nitrite in aqueous samples based on Griess reaction and spectrophotometric detection. The integrated system employed a customized single chip microcomputer based hardware and laboratory-programmed software written by LabVIEW to control the injection valve, pumps and optical detection module. Experimental parameters related to nitrite analysis, including the reagent volume, sample temperature and salinity were evaluated and optimized. This fully automated analyzer showed a limit of detection as low as 0.02\u00a0\u03bcM with sample throughput of 15\u00a0h \u22121 . The calibration curves prepared in pure water and low nutrient seawater were consistent over the linear range of 0\u201310\u00a0\u03bcM (R 2 \u00a0=\u00a00.999), showing insignificant interference from the common ions in seawater. Different aqueous samples were successfully analyzed using both the present analyzer and the standard benchtop method, and the results from the two techniques showed no significant difference according to the statistical  t -test ( P \u00a0=\u00a00.95). This compact automatic analyzer is simple, fully integrated, and user-friendly, making it highly suitable for field applications, such as on-line environmental monitoring and underway analysis.",

        "abstract": "Daily living activity recognition can be exploited to benefit mobile and ubiquitous computing applications. Techniques so far are mature to recognize simple actions. Due to the characteristics of diversity and uncertainty in daily living applications, most existing complex activity recognition approaches have notable limitations. First, graphical model-based approaches still lack sufficient expressive power to model rich temporal relations among activities. Second, it would be rather difficult for graphical model-based approaches to build a unified model for achieving multiple types of tasks. Third, current semantic-based approaches often fail to capture uncertainties. Fourth, formulae in these semantic-based approaches are often manually encoded. Meanwhile, it is impractical to handcraft each formula accurately in daily living scenarios where temporal relations among activities are intricate. To address these issues, we present a probabilistic semantic-based framework that combines Markov logic network with 15 temporal and hierarchical relations to explicitly perform diverse inference tasks of daily living in a unified manner. Advanced pattern mining techniques are introduced to automatically learn the propositional logic rules of intricate relations as well as their weights. Experimental results show that by logical reasoning with the mined temporal dependencies under uncertainty, the proposed model leads to an improved performance, particularly when recognizing complex activities involving the incomplete or incorrect observations of atomic actions. HighlightsA probabilistic semantic-based framework is presented to explicitly perform diverse inference tasks.The framework combines Markov logic networks with 15 relations between activities.Advanced pattern mining techniques are introduced to learn intricate temporal rules.Performances can be improved by logical reasoning with the mined rules under uncertainty.Our approach is robust to the incomplete or incorrect observations of intervals.",

In this paper, we intend to predict Beijingu0027s tertiary industry, whose datasets are small, irregular and non-stationary, leading to a difficulty of building an accurate prediction model. To this end, we present an improved grey model, named PRGM(1,1), which extends the grey prediction model by integrating two techniques, i.e., the particle swarm optimization algorithm for parameter optimization and the exponential preprocessing method for data cleaning. The experimental results show that PRGM(1,1) outperforms other variants of the grey prediction model in predicting Beijingu0027s tertiary industry, and is viable to do reasonable prediction over short and fluctuated economic data sequences. In addition, we employ PRGM(1,1) in the economic prediction of Beijingu0027s tertiary industry in the next five years, and conclude that the growth rate will decelerate.

Complex activity recognition is challenging since a complex activity can be performed in different ways, with each having its own configuration of primitive events and their temporal dependencies. To address such temporal relational variabilities in complex activity recognition, we propose a Bayesian network-based probabilistic generative framework that employs Allens interval relation network to represent local temporal dependencies in a generative way. By employing the Chinese restaurant process and introducing relation generation constraints, our framework can characterize these unique internal configurations of a particular complex activity as a joint distribution. Three concrete models are implemented based on our framework. Specifically, in this paper we improve two of our previous models and provide an enhanced model to handle temporal relational variabilities in complex activities more efficiently. Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of our framework. In particular, it is shown that our models are rather robust against errors caused by the low-level predictions from raw signals.",

However, formulas in current semantic-based approaches are generally manually encoded, which is rather unrealistic in situations where event relations are intricate. Moreover, current approaches for learning event relations often lack the capability to handle uncertainties. To address these issues, we present a framework to learn an event knowledge base (EKB) of probabilistic interval-based event relations and use them to infer varied semantic-level queries about activity occurrences under uncertainty. Specifically, we formalize an activity model to represent eight temporal and hierarchical event relations and four commonly performed queries. We leverage pattern mining techniques to learn an EKB associated with these relations and queries in a unified way. Experimental results show that the proposed framework with the learned EKB involving temporal and hierarchical dependencies leads to a significant performance improvement on activity recognition, particularly in the presence of incomplete or incorrect observations.",

For sign-changing and smooth doping profile with \u2018good\u2019 boundary conditions the quasineutral limit (zero-Debye-length limit) is performed rigorously by using the multiple scaling asymptotic expansions of a singular perturbation analysis and the carefully performed classical energy methods. The key point in the proof is to introduce a \u2018density\u2019 transform and two \u03bb -weighted Liapunov-type functionals first, and then to establish the entropy production integration inequality, which yields the uniform estimate with respect to the scaled Debye length. The basic point of the idea involved here is to control strong nonlinear oscillation by the interaction between the entropy and the entropy dissipation.",

It was found that acupuncture treatment can lower blood pressure, postpone the development of prehypertension, improve vascular endothelia function and immune function, down-regulate the levels of serum proinflammatory cytokines, and reduce inflammatory reactions of the heart and kidney, possible by way of regulating cellular signal pathways as TLR 4/NF-\u03baB, p 38/MAPK, CaM-eNOS-NO, TGF-\u03b2 1/Smads, etc. and playing a protective effect on the target organs.

The UV spectra of various solvent extracts of palm fiber were investigated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and UV spectra were used to analyze the treated palm fiber, 100% \u03b1-cellulose, and raw palm fiber. The UV absorbances of palm, bamboo, and ramie fibers and their lignin extracts were comparatively investigated. The results showed that lignin is the main contributor to the UV absorption property of palm fiber. UV spectroscopy of the solvent extracts showed that a dioxane solution exhibited an excellent extraction capacity. The analysis of the FTIR and UV spectra of treated palm fiber, 100% \u03b1-cellulose, and raw palm fiber confirmed that there was a strong correlation between the UV absorption property and the chemical components. The results showed that the palm fiber exhibited superior UV absorption properties and that the lignin content noticeably affected the UV absorption degree.",

Ten EMSFs with different metal fiber contents and metal grid sizes were examined as research specimens, and tests were conducted to determine electromagnetic shielding effectiveness (EMSE) and wearability indices. The indices were analyzed and the comprehensive performances of the EMSFs evaluated with the fuzzy matter-element method. Experimental results show that the EMSE improved and fabric wearability worsened when metal fiber content increased and metal grid size decreased. Moreover, fuzzy matter-element evaluation findings suggested that the best comprehensive performance was observed in the composite fabric containing 11.71% metal and whose metal mesh measures 1.41\u00a0mm2; these features reflect the maximum Euclid approach degree.",

First, the optimal parameters of the activation technology, such as impregnation ratio, temperature, and time, were determined. The pyrolysis process and activation mechanism of KOH were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). WPF powder-based activated carbons were then prepared under the optimized condition and characterized by SEM, FTIR, XRD, and nitrogen adsorption techniques. The reaction mechanisms were deduced in two phases. The reaction mechanisms in the first carbonization process were mainly related to substitution, scission, and oxidization reactions of methylene. In the second activation process, KOH and carbon began to react at 350 \u00b0C, producing potassium compounds, which further reacted with carbon. Results show that the optimal process for preparing an excellent adsorbent from WPF employs an impregnation ratio of 4:1 at 850 \u00b0C for 2.5 h, which can result in a good adsorption property for methylene blue, high BET surface area of 1734.34 m2/g, and total pore volume of 0.96 cm3/g. WPF-based activated carbon demonstrates a remarkable adsorption capacity, and thus WPF has great potential value as a new agricultural resource.",

By synthesizing ammonium titanyl oxalate as a precursor, N-doped TiO2 can be prepared, then the core\u2013shell structure of N-TiO2@CuOx with a catalyst loading of Cu on its surface was prepared using a precipitation method. It was characterized in detail using XRD, TEM, BET, XPS and H2-TPR, while its photocatalytic activity was evaluated using the probe reaction of the degradation of methyl orange. We found that the core\u2013shell N-TiO2@CuOx nanomaterial can lessen the TiO2 energy band-gap width due to the N-doping, as well as remarkably improving the photo-degradation activity due to a certain loading of Cu on the surfaces of N-TiO2 supports. Therefore, a preparation method for a novel N, Cu co-doped TiO2 photocatalyst with a core\u2013shell structure and efficient photocatalytic performance has been provided.",

The speciation of aqueous HAuCl4, Au colloids, and Au/SiO2 catalysts were characterized in detail by ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013Vis) absorption spectroscopy, ion chromatography, dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The catalytic activity and stability of the Au/SiO2 catalysts in CO oxidation were also evaluated. The results show that the Au species in aqueous HAuCl4 and the morphology of Au colloids were apparently affected by the solution pH, but were independent of the reagent used to adjust the pH value. The catalytic activity of Au/SiO2 catalysts in low-temperature CO oxidation inevitably exhibited a volcano shape, depending on not only the pH value of the aqueous HAuCl4, but also the specific reagent used to adjust the pH value, while the stability of the Au/SiO2 catalysts depended only on the coexisting elements.",

        "abstract": "This study sought to evaluate the potential of circulating long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as biomarkers for heart failure (HF). We measured the circulating levels of 13 individual lncRNAs which are known to be relevant to cardiovascular disease in the plasma samples from 72 HF patients and 60 non-HF control participants using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) methods. We found that out of the 13 lncRNAs tested, non-coding repressor of NFAT (NRON) and myosin heavy-chain-associated RNA transcripts (MHRT) had significantly higher plasma levels in HF than in non-HF subjects: 3.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.30 versus 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07 for NRON (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and 1.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14 versus 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12 for MHRT (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The area under the ROC curve was 0.865 for NRON and 0.702 for MHRT. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified NRON and MHRT as independent predictors for HF. Spearman's rank correlation analysis showed that NRON was negatively correlated with HDL and positively correlated with LDH, whereas MHRT was positively correlated with AST and LDH. Hence, elevation of circulating NRON and MHRT predicts HF and may be considered as novel biomarkers of HF.",

This study investigated the patterns of use of docetaxel (T) in real-life clinical practice in China. Methods: This retrospective pooled analysis included female Chinese adults (\u226518 years) with operable breast cancer treated with docetaxel-based adjuvant chemotherapy enrolled in the Asia-Pacific Breast Initiatives (APBI) I (2006-2008) and II (2009-2011) registries, and two Chinese observational studies; BC STATE (2011-2014) and BC Local Registry (2007-2010). Patients with metastatic disease were excluded. The primary endpoint was assessment of treatment patterns and patient profiles. Patient profiles for treatment regimen selection were investigated using regression analysis. Results: Data from 3020 patients were included. The most commonly used regimen was docetaxel/anthracycline combination (n=1421 [47.1%]; of whom 52.0% received T/epirubicin (E)/cyclophosphamide (C)), followed by docetaxel/other (n=70...",

        "abstract": "Glycine has been shown to protect against ischemic stroke through various mechanisms. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) which antagonize Akt-dependent cell survival has been linked to neuronal damage. However, whether glycine has a neuroprotective property intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) was unknown. This study aimed to determine the protective effect of glycine in rats ICH. Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to left striatum infusion of autologous blood. ICH animals received glycine (0.2-3\u202fmg/kg, icv) at 1\u202fh after ICH with or without pre-injection of Akt Inhibitor IV (100\u202f\u03bcM, 2\u202f\u03bcl, icv) 0.5\u202fh prior to glycine treatment. Our results showed that in the perihematomal area PTEN was up-regulated in the early stage after ICH. However, glycine treatment decreased PTEN protein level and increased the phosphorylation level of AKT (p-AKT) in the perihematomal area. With the administration of glycine, neuronal death was significantly reduced and Evans blue leakage was alleviated as well as the brain edema after ICH. Moreover, hematoma volume was decreased and neurobehavioral outcome was improved. Nevertheless, Akt Inhibitor IV abolished the neuroprotective effects of glycine after ICH. Together, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, the protective role of glycine on ICH rats, and suggest that the neuroprotective effect of glycine was mediated through PTEN/Akt signal pathway.",

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive glioma in the brain. Recurrence of GBM is almost inevitable within a short term after tumor resection. In a retrospective study of 386 cases of GBM collected between 2013 and 2016, we found that recurrence of GBM mainly occurs in the deep brain regions, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, and corpus callosum. But the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not clear. Previous studies suggest that neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) is necessary for GBM growth. Our results show that the levels of NLGN3 in the cortex are higher than those in the deep regions in a normal human brain, and similar patterns are also found in a normal mouse brain. In contrast, NLGN3 levels in the deep brain regions of GBM patients are high. We also show that an increase in NLGN3 concentration promotes the growth of U251 cells and U87-MG cells. Respective use of the cortex neuron culture medium (C-NCM) and basal ganglia neuron culture medium (BG-NCM) with DMEM to cultivate U251, U87-MG and GBM cells isolated from patients, we found that these cells grew faster after treatment with C-NCM and BG-NCM in which the cells treated with C-NCM grew faster than the ones treated with BG-NCM group. Inhibition of NLGN3 release by ADAM10i prevents NCM-induced cell growth. Together, this study suggests that increased levels of NLGN3 in the deep brain region under the GBM pathological circumstances may contribute to GBM recurrence in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and corpus callosum.",

        "abstract": "Bisperoxovanadium (pyridine-2-carboxyl) [bpV(pic)] is a commercially available PTEN inhibitor. Previous studies from us and others have shown that bpV(pic) confers neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia injury. We set up to determine whether ERK 1/2 activation plays a role in bpV(pic)-induced neuroprotective effect in cerebral ischemia injury. We found that the phosphorylation levels of Akt (p-AKT) and ERK1/2 (p-ERK 1/2) were down-regulated after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. The injection of bpV(pic) after injury not only increased the level of p-AKT but also the level of p-ERK 1/2. While the inhibition of PTEN mediated the up-regulatation of p-AKT and p-ERK 1/2 by bpV(pic). Interestingly, the ERK 1/2 activation induced by bpV(pic) was also independent of the inhibition of PTEN. Our results indicate that bpV(pic) protects against OGD-induced neuronal death and promotes the functional recovery of stroke animals through PTEN inhibition and ERK 1/2 activation, respectively. This study suggests that the effect of bpV(pic) on ERK 1/2 signaling should be considered while using bpV(pic) as a PTEN inhibitor.",

        "abstract": "DJ-1 (also called PARK7) is a multifunctional redox-sensitive protein that is protective against oxidative stress-induced cell death. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a major protein component of pathological inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Reducing aberrant aggregation of TDP-43 is a potential approach to prevent cell death. To investigate whether DJ-1 might inhibit TDP-43 aggregation to exert a protective effect in oxidative stress-induced injury, we tested the protein level and subcellular localization of TDP-43 and DJ-1 in SH-SY5Y cells transfected with wild-type DJ-1, DJ-1 mutant (L166P) cDNA, or DJ-1 siRNA. We show that oxidative stress induced by paraquat leads to the formation of cytosolic TDP-43 aggregation in SH-SY5Y cells. DJ-1 overexpression decreases paraquat-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 in SH-SY5Y cells and protects against paraquat-induced cell death. Transfection of DJ-1 L166P mutant or DJ-1 siRNA leads to increased cytosolic aggregation of TDP-43 in paraquat-treated SH-SY5Y cells and promotes cell death. These data suggest that DJ-1 may protect against oxidative stress-induced cell death through the suppression of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregation.",

The mutant exhibited a pale-green leaf (pgl) phenotype throughout the whole development as well as reduced grain quality. Map-based cloning of PGL3 revealed that it encodes the chloroplast signal recognition particle 43 kDa protein (cpSRP43). PGL3 affected the Chl synthesis by regulating the expression levels of the Chl synthesis-associated genes. Considerable reactive oxygen species were accumulated in the leaves of pgl3, and the transcription levels of its scavenging genes were down-regulated, indicating that pgl3 can accelerate senescence. In addition, high temperatures could inhibit the plant's growth and facilitate the process of senescence in pgl3.",

Cultivars with particular flowering behaviors have been artificially selected to survive in the long-day and low-temperature conditions of Northeast China. To dissect the genetic mechanism responsible for heading date in rice populations from Northeast China, association mapping was performed to identify major controlling loci. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified three genetic loci, Hd1, Ghd7 and DTH7, using general and mixed linear models. The three genes were sequenced to analyze natural variations and identify their functions. Loss-of-function alleles of these genes contributed to early rice heading dates in the northern regions of Northeast China, while functional alleles promoted late rice heading dates in the southern regions of Northeast China. Selecting environmentally appropriate allele combinations in new varieties is recommended during breeding. Introducing the early indica rice\u2019s genetic background into Northeast japonica rice is a reasonable strategy for improving genetic diversity.",

        "abstract": "Doxorubicin (adriamycin), an anthracycline antibiotic, is commonly used to treat many types of solid and hematological malignancies. Unfortunately, clinical usage of doxorubicin is limited due to the associated acute and chronic cardiotoxicity. Previous studies demonstrated that Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), the extracts of Astragalus membranaceus, had strong anti-tumor activities and anti-inflammatory effects. However, whether APS could mitigate chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity is unclear thus far. We used a doxorubicin-induced neonatal rat cardiomyocyte injury model and a mouse heart failure model to explore the function of APS. GFP-LC3 adenovirus-mediated autophagic vesicle assays, GFP and RFP tandemly tagged LC3 (tfLC3) assays and Western blot analyses were performed to analyze the cell function and cell signaling changes following APS treatment in cardiomyocytes. First, doxorubicin treatment led to C57BL/6J mouse heart failure and increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, with a disturbed cell autophagic flux. Second, APS restored autophagy in doxorubicin-treated primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes and in the doxorubicin-induced heart failure mouse model. Third, APS attenuated doxorubicin-induced heart injury by regulating the AMPK/mTOR pathway. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin significantly abrogated the protective effect of APS. These results suggest that doxorubicin could induce heart failure by disturbing cardiomyocyte autophagic flux, which may cause excessive cell apoptosis. APS could restore normal autophagic flux, ameliorating doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by regulating the AMPK/mTOR pathway.",

        "abstract": "Increased levels of plasma cholesterol are a common feature of patient of type 2 diabetes. However, the links between elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and dysfunction of \u03b2-cells are still unclear.The apoE(-/-)mice were fed with a high-fat, cholesterol-rich diet for 8 weeks. Blood samples were collected from the mice for measurement of plasma glucose, lipids. The pancreas were embedded in OCT compound and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen for further analysis. To examine the effects of LDL on \u03b2-cell function, insulin content, cell apoptosis and ROS production were measured in pancreatic islets of apoE(-/-)mice and mouse pancreatic \u03b2-cell line NIT-1. Relative cell signal pathways were determined by Western blot.Decreased insulin content and increased apoptosis and ROS production were found in pancreatic islets of apoE(-/-)mice, accompanied by elevated plasma LDL. The ROS levels were significantly enhanced in NIT-1 cells exposed to LDL. Reduced insulin synthesis and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and elevated apoptosis were reversed by suppression of NOX2 expression. Moreover, LDL induced dysfunction and apoptosis of pancreatic NIT-1 cells through JNK and p53 pathways, which were rescued by siRNA-mediated NOX2 reduction.NOX2-derived ROS may play a key role in LDL-induced dysfunction and apoptosis of pancreatic \u03b2-cells through JNK and p53 pathways.",

Among the films with x between 0 and 0.25, the lowest coercivity of 0.56 kA/m was achieved in the (Fe 65Co 35) 0.82(Al 2O 3) 0.18 film. This is ascribed to the strongest exchange interactions between the Fe 65Co 35 nanoparticles in this film. Combined with the microstructure analysis of the (Fe 65Co 35) 1 - x(Al 2O 3) x films, the modified Herzer's model was extended to interpret the variation of the coercivity with x and analyze the effect of the exchange interactions between the Fe 65Co 35 nanoparticles on the magnetic softness. The remanence curves confirm the existence of the exchange interactions and reveal the evolution of the exchange interaction strength with Al 2O 3 content. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Intracellular ice formation (IIF) was observed as abrupt ''flashing''. Two types of flashing or IIF were observed in this study. Extracellular freezing occurred at a mean of\u00a0-7.7\u00a0\u00b0C. In morulae, about 25% turned dark within \u00b11\u00a0\u00b0C of extracellular ice formation (EIF). These we refer to as \"high temperature'' flashers. In zygotes, there were no high temperature flashers. All the zygotes flashed at temperatures well below the temperature for EIF. Presumably high temperature flashers were a consequence of membrane damage prior to EIF or damage from EIF. We shall not discuss them further. In the majority of cases, IIF occurred well below\u00a0-7.7\u00a0\u00b0C; these we call ''low temperature'' flashers. None flashed with cooling rate (CR) of 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C/min in either zygotes or morulae. Nearly all flashed with CR of 4\u00a0\u00b0C/min or higher, but the distribution of temperatures is much broader with morulae than with zygotes. Also, the mean flashing temperature is much higher with morulae (-20.9\u00a0\u00b0C) than with zygotes (-40.3\u00a0\u00b0C). We computed the kinetics of water loss with respect to CR and temperature in both mouse zygotes and in morulae based on published estimates of Lp and it is Ea. The resulting dehydration curves combined with knowledge of the embryo nucleation temperature permits an estimate of the likelihood of IIF as a function of CR and subzero temperature. The agreement between these computed probabilities and the observed values are good.",

Northern Blot analysis detected a signal about 1.5 kb that suggests it is a full-length cDNA. Reverse transcription-PCR demonstrates that the transcripts are high in adult brain, testis, ovary, spleen, and fetal brain. Comparing the cDNA with the human genome database identifies a contig that reveals that the gene contains six exons and is located on human chromosome 20p11. The gene encodes a putative protein with an unknown domain conserved in many species and is similar to bacterial histidyl-tRNA synthetase, and so it is named human histidyl-tRNA-synthetase-related gene.",

The heat transfer characteristics of the ITSS were investigated through theoretical and experimental approaches. A quasi-steady one-dimensional mathematical model for predicting the transient discharging power was proposed. On this basis, a control strategy was proposed to fulfill the minimum cooling requirement in consideration of both effective discharging time and human comfort. The minimum required velocity of the ITSS was analyzed; from this, the effective working time of the ITSS was determined to be 64.57\u00a0h. Additionally, the heat load inside the chamber was found to be the main factor that affected the effective temperature control duration and the utilization ratio of the ice. Thus, a reserve factor, which is defined as a function of rated heat load and determined by the discharging performance model, is suggested for consideration during optimization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To provide an optimal aerodynamic sealing solution for an alternative refuge in underground mine, a commercial air knife was selected as the air curtain device (ACD) for its lower compressed air use and uniform airflow. A series of simulated chamber model experiments were then performed to evaluate the sealing efficiency of different ACD configurations and the influence of interruption by transiting personnel on ACD performance. By considering the overall sealing efficiency, stability and air consumption, a double-sided ACD equipped with a baffle on the side exposed to harmful gases inside the entrance of the protected door is proposed as the most suitable configuration. This requires compressed air to be supplied at a pressure of 0.10\u20130.20\u00a0MPa to generate an air barrier, which means that a standard compressed air cylinder (40\u00a0L, 15\u00a0MPa) can provide suitable sealing conditions for a period of about 3.5\u00a0min.",

A combination of a mononuclear non-heme iron enzyme-catalyzed oxidative C-S bond formation and a subsequent pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-mediated C-S lyase reaction leads to the net transfer of a sulfur atom from a cysteine to a histidine. In this study, we structurally and mechanistically characterized a PLP-dependent C-S lyase Egt2, which mediates the sulfoxide C-S bond cleavage in ergothioneine biosynthesis. A cation-\u03c0 interaction between substrate and enzyme accounts for Egt2's preference of sulfoxide over thioether as a substrate. Using mutagenesis and structural biology, we captured three distinct states of the Egt2 C-S lyase reaction cycle, including a labile sulfenic intermediate captured in Egt2 crystals. Chemical trapping and high-resolution mass spectrometry were used to confirm the involvement of the sulfenic acid intermediate in Egt2 catalysis.",

The non-heme iron enzyme OvoA catalyzed oxidative coupling be-tween cysteine and histidine is one of the key steps. Besides catalyzing the oxidative coupling between cysteine and histidine, OvoA also catalyzes the oxi-dation of cysteine to cysteine sulfinic acid (cysteine dioxygenase activity). Thus far, very little mecha-nistic information is available for OvoA-catalysis. In this report, we measured the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) in OvoA-catalysis using the isotopically sensitive branching method. In addition, by replac-ing an active site tyrosine (Tyr417) with 2-amino-3-(4-hydroxy-3-(methylthio) phenyl) propanoic acid (MtTyr) through the amber suppressor mediated unnatural amino acid incorporation method, the two OvoA activities (oxidative coupling between cysteine and histidine, and cysteine dioxygenase activity) can be modulated. These results suggest that the two OvoA activities branch out from a common intermediate and that the active site tyro-sine residue plays some key roles in controlling the partitioning between these two pathways.",

        "abstract": "A growing number of research results demonstrate that copper is an important trace element to life. In this study, whole-cell recording made from acutely dissociated rat hippocampal CA1 neurons was employed to investigate the actions of copper (Cu(2+)) on the delayed rectifier K(+) currents (I(K)). External application of various concentrations of Cu(2+) (1-1000microM) reduced the amplitude of I(K) in a dose-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 100microM and a Hill coefficient of 0.4. 300microM of Cu(2+) depolarized the I(K) activation curves by 12.5mV and hyperpolarized the I(K) state-inactivation curves by 17.4mV, respectively. At this concentration, Cu(2+) also significantly increased the value of the fast decay time constant (tau(1)), but had no effect on the I(K) recovery from inactivation. These results suggest that relevant concentrations of copper at physiological and pathological level can influence the neuronal excitability of rat hippocampal CA1 neurons by voltage-gated delayed rectifier K(+) channels, and such actions are likely involved in the pathophysiology of Cu-related Wilson's disease.",

A novel method named magnitude weighting selection (MWS) for PAPR reduction in TDCS is proposed. The method is based on multiplying used subcarriers by magnitude weights which are determined by the modified backtracking search optimisation algorithm. The MWS algorithm can significantly reduce the computational complexity with a low PAPR. Furthermore, it guarantees the normality of transmission signals and reduces the multiple-user interference. Analytic and simulation results demonstrate that the MWS method makes a good tradeoff between PAPR reduction and bit error rate degradation in a specified magnitude weighting range.",

The proposed method without CSI is based on a modified joint approximate diagonalization of eigen-matrices algorithm, which eliminates permutation indetermination and phase ambiguity, as well as the minimum description length algorithm, which blindly estimates the number of secret data sources.

In addition, the proposed method without legitimate users\u2019 CSI performs well in terms of robustness and computational complexity.",

Due to its memory ability and simple structure, BSA has powerful capability to find global optimal solutions. However, the algorithm is still insufficient in balancing the exploration and the exploitation. Therefore, an improved adaptive backtracking search optimization algorithm combined with modified Hooke-Jeeves pattern search is proposed for numerical global optimization. It has two main parts: the BSA is used for the exploration phase and the modified pattern search method completes the exploitation phase. In particular, a simple but effective strategy of adapting one of BSA\u2019s important control parameters is introduced. The proposed algorithm is compared with standard BSA, three state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms and three superior algorithms in IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2014(IEEE CEC2014) over six widely-used benchmarks and 22 real-parameter single objective numerical optimization benchmarks in IEEE CEC2014. The results of experiment and statistical analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

This dimension tolerance is enough for some applications. However, higher precision is necessary in order to use AWJ in some other applications. To get higher precision in an AWJ cutting process, controlling AWJ beam more accurately is needed, and this further leads to understanding AWJ cutting front more accurately. This paper compared the current cutting front profile exploration methods and then provided a new method to collect AWJ cutting front information accurately. With this new method, a better understanding of the cutting front profile is possible, which further leads to higher precision cutting of AWJ. This paper also demonstrated that the AWJ cutting front profile could be fitted by parabolic curves accurately.",

        "abstract": "As the only cold high-energy beam machining technology, abrasive water-jet (AWJ) is one of the most rapidly developed techniques in material manufacturing industry. However, the application of AWJ is limited by the cutting accuracy it can achieve. Kerf profile generated by AWJ is different as the cutting parameters change. As a result, it has become a major factor which affects the cutting accuracy when AWJ is used as a machining tool. Researchers used taper error to characterize kerf profile error generated by AWJ in the past years. And many efforts have been put on how to eliminate taper error by using a tilting cutting head of a 5-axis AWJ machine. However, using taper error to characterize the kerf profile error generated by AWJ is not accurate since kerf profile error might appear in different styles. And using a 5-axis AWJ machine to eliminate taper error is only effective in some special cases. To effectively eliminate taper error, the first thing needs to do is to find out whether the kerf profile error can be compensated or not. Based on research, a key parameter, named kerf profile coefficient O, which can be used to characterize kerf profile error and further to guide people to use different ways to compensate kerf profile error, has been defined in this paper. To further illustrate the efficiency of this coefficient, a series of cutting experiments have been carried out and the experimental results have been discussed.",

        "abstract": "As the only cold high-energy beam machining technology, abrasive water-jet (AWJ) is one of the most rapidly developed techniques in material manufacturing industry. However, the application of AWJ is limited by the cutting accuracy it can achieve. To achieve higher accuracy, better understanding in jet lag is very important. Though different methods had been explored to obtain jet lag information in the past, some inherent defects in those methods led to some inaccuracy for jet lag information. This paper have investigated a new method to obtain jet lag information, which would achieve higher accuracy for jet lag information. To further illustrate the efficiency of this method, a series of cutting experiments have been carried out and the experimental results have been discussed. Based on the experimental results, cutting front profile can be well fitted by a parabolic curve.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, various fouling characteristics on the surface of a commercial reverse osmosis (RO) membrane were identified, in terms of different organic and inorganic components. Specifically, a practical secondary wastewater of coal chemical industry was used as the feed solution, and was fractionated into six hydrophobic/hydrophilic acid/base/neutral portions. RO membrane fouling behaviors at different stages were critically described using two characteristic parameters, i.e., initial flux decline rate and final steady-state flux. These parameters were quantified using Michaelis-Menten relation as a model fitting method. In general, the hydrophilic neutral (HIN) and hydrophobic neutral (HON) fractions had the fastest initial fouling rate and the lowest steady-state flux, mainly due to their high contents of polysaccharide. Among the organic constituents (polysaccharide/protein/humic acid), polysaccharide was the most responsible for rapid initial flux decline and low final steady-state flux, as proved by Kendall\u2019s correlation. Among the inorganic constituents (Ca/Mg/Si), Si was found to exert the greatest influence on the final steady-state flux. This indicates that polysaccharide and Si played a combined role in determining the foulant layer permeability at the prolonged fouling stage, and a possible mechanism is that Si might alter the structure of polysaccharide gel layer. Further information on the fouling layers was systematically provided by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy with fractal dimension analysis.",

        "abstract": "The quantitative response of yield to density in plant populations has been an important focus of both theoretical research and empirical research. Most studies on yield\u2013density effects have focused mainly on aboveground plant parts, and rarely on various plant organs and belowground parts. We tested the hypothesis that yield-density effects of belowground parts are different from those for aboveground parts. Bulbs of Allium cepa var. aggregatum were sown at five densities at the Pasture Ecology Research Station, western Jilin Province, China. We harvested populations at four different points in time and analyzed yield\u2013density relationships of above- versus belowground parts and component organs. A hyperbolic model provided a very good fit to above- and belowground biomass, as well as the biomass of specific organs throughout the experiment. Aboveground and leaf biomass achieved constant final yield, but stand stem and root biomass increased monotonically with increasing sowing density. Belowground and specifically bulb yield was highest at intermediate densities at the later harvests. Constant final yield may be widely applicable to total biomass production by a population, but it does not apply to specific organs, such as stems, roots, or bulbs. Asymptotic leaf biomass reached its asymptote earlier than that of other aboveground parts. The effect of density on A. cepa var. aggregatum organs is a consequence of allocation of photosynthate to different organs in response to competition. Yield\u2013density effects are different above- and belowground as a result of the different mechanisms of competition, constrained by the functional relationship between above- and belowground organs.",

Phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) can convert the insoluble phosphates into plant-available forms and may have the potential for use in sustainable agricultural practices. This study examined the effects of two native PSB, namely Bacillus aryabhattai (JX285) and Pseudomonas auricularis (HN038), and a mixture of both strains (1:1) on the growth of Camellia oleifera Abel. seedlings. The results showed a significant promotion of the growth of C. oleifera plants by three inoculation treatments. All the PSB inoculation treatments could improve the leaf nitrogen (N) and P content and had positive effects on the available N, P, and potassium (K) content of rhizosphere soil. A co-inoculation of the two native PSB strains caused a synergistic effect and achieved the best benefit. In conclusion, B. aryabhattai and P. auricularis could be used as biological agents instead of chemical fertilizers for agricultural production to reduce environmental pollution and increase the yield of tea oil.",

The whole genome sequence includes 5948 protein-coding genes, 124 tRNAs, and 29 rRNAs, and has been deposited at Genbank/EMBL/DDBJ with accession numbers CP018874-CP018881. We detected genes associated with organic acid production, which may be vital for phosphate conversion. Furthermore, phosphatase-encoding genes were also detected. The information embedded in the genome will assist in studying the mechanisms of phosphate solubilization.

The importance of plant plasticity in coping with such experiences is widely recognized, but little is known about how plastic responses to current conditions are affected by prior environmental experiences.Our objectives were to investigate the effects of early inundation or drought on the subsequent responses of plant species to the same, opposite or more favourable conditions.To address these questions, we subjected four invasive and four native herbaceous perennial species from different habitats (xeric, mesic, hydric) to two rounds of hydrological treatments (drought, moderate water, inundation) and analysed the effects of the early treatments on survival and performance (total biomass and relative growth) of individuals in the later treatments.In general, (i) early drought reduced the performance of more species than did early inundation, and decreased the final total mass of all species; (ii) early inundation and early drought did not lead to lower survival immediately or later, but improved the relative growth of survivors across all late conditions; (iii) late drought resulted in the highest mortality and lowest performance after any early treatment.With respect to habitat of origin: (i) early inundation was more beneficial for species from wet habitats than for other species; (ii) species from xeric habitats had the strongest drought tolerance after early drought; (iii) mesic species were more likely to suffer reduced later growth after either inundation or drought experience. Invasive species benefitted more from early inundation than did native species, but native species grew better after experiencing early drought.Results indicate that early exposure to inundation or drought conditions alters how plants respond to later conditions and suggest that exposure to extreme events can induce physiological or morphological changes that improve tolerance for either extreme conditions later. This increased tolerance can be at the cost of poorer performance under more benign conditions.Synthesis. Early inundation or drought experience may be harmful immediately, but can be beneficial for the later growth of plants. The ability of species to utilize early hydrological experiences was associated with the water range of their habitats and whether the species is invasive or native. The ability to modulate future plastic responses may be as important as short-term plasticity in adapting to temporal environmental heterogeneity. Such \u2018metaplasticity\u2019 can optimize current performance, while avoiding the potential costs of maintaining a high degree of plasticity throughout life.",

        "abstract": "The complexity of plant response to density in nature has been recognized, but seldom interpreted, especially in the context of various abiotic environments or plant ontogeny. Our objective was to investigate whether and how soil conditions and plant growth stage affected plant responses to density in a variety of traits under field conditions. Abutilon theophrasti (annual species) was planted at low, medium, and high densities (13.4, 36, and 121 plants m\u22122, respectively) under good or poor soil conditions and harvested 30, 50, or 70 days after seedling emergence. Responses of many traits to density varied with soil conditions and growth stages. Initially, leaf size, petiole angle, and stem diameter were decreased by high density in good soil, but not in poor soil. After 50 days, high density induced extra stem elongation and stem mass increment in both soil conditions; this was at the cost of biomass allocated to other organs in good soil. In contrast, in poor soil, high density decreased more morphological traits, with less effects on allocation patterns. At 70 days, there were decreases in more traits in response to density in poor soil, whereas most traits remained stable in good soil. Results demonstrated that density\u2013plasticity was inherently complex, including multiple responsive trends within and among traits, and revealed that the ability of the plants to adapt to variation in density via responses of various modular traits has been underestimated. Soil conditions and growth stage may affect these responses, either directly through effects on plant size and competition strength, or indirectly through effects on strength of stem response. Contrasting stage-dependent plasticity to density under two soil conditions also revealed different growth strategies of plants in dealing with biotic environmental challenges. These findings highlighted the importance of considering roles of abiotic environmental factors and growth stage in modulating plasticity to biotic environments.",

        "title": "Analysis of Output Voltage Ripple of AGPS for CFETR N-NBI Prototype",
        "abstract": "The planned China fusion engineering test reactor (CFETR) needs one or more negative-ion-based neutral beam injectors (N-NBIs) with a beam energy of 500 or even 1000 keV. In order to prepare for CFETR, a prototype of CFETR N-NBI is being designed. The prototype needs an acceleration grid power supply (AGPS) rated at 200 kV/25 A with a maximum pulselength reaches to 3600 s. The AGPS adopted a single-stage inverter-type high-voltage power supply (HVPS). The output voltage ripple is an important specification of the AGPS, which can affect the efficiency and stability of N-NBI system by influencing the beam divergence. However, the conventional methods cannot be used to limit the output voltage ripple of the inverter-type HVPS used as AGPS of CFETR N-NBI prototype. This paper simplified the AGPS to an insulated three-phase three-level (TPTL) dc\u2013dc converter connected with a dual dc link. The working process of the TPTL dc\u2013dc converter with duty-cycle modulation has been analyzed, and two main continuous conduction modes are described. The influence of key parameters such as duty cycle of inverter, leakage inductance of transformer, and output current on output voltage ripple is analyzed. Based on the analysis results, a so-called combined control strategy was proposed to keep the output voltage ripple at a level. The proposed strategy is suitable for the cases where the object output voltage is below 175 kV. Some simulations were carried out by using MATLAB/Simulink. The results showed that the analysis in this paper is reliable and the proposed control strategy has a good performance.",

        "abstract": "High-redshift quasars are important tracers of structure and evolution in the early universe. However, they are very rare and difficult to find when using color selection because of contamination from late-type dwarfs. High-redshift quasar surveys based on only optical colors suffer from incompleteness and low identification efficiency, especially at z greater than or similar to 4.5. We have developed a new method to select 4.7 less than or similar to z less than or similar to 5.4 quasars with both high efficiency and completeness by combining optical and mid-IR Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) photometric data, and are conducting a luminous z similar to 5 quasar survey in the whole Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) footprint. We have spectroscopically observed 99 out of 110 candidates with z-band magnitudes brighter than 19.5, and 64 (64.6%) of them are quasars with redshifts of 4.4 less than or similar to z less than or similar to 5.5 and absolute magnitudes of -29 less than or similar to M-1450 less than or similar to -26.4. In addition, we also observed 14 fainter candidates selected with the same criteria and identified 8 (57.1%) of them as quasars with 4.7   4.5, which will set strong constraints on the bright end of the quasar luminosity function. We also expand our method to select quasars at z greater than or similar to 5.7. In this paper we report the discovery of four new luminous z greater than or similar to 5.7 quasars based on SDSS WISE selection.",

        "title": "The acute stresses role of the atypical 2-cys peroxiredoxin PmPrx5 in black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) from biological immunity and environmental toxicity stress.",
        "abstract": "As a unique atypical 2-Cys Peroxiredoxin (Prx) of the Prx-like superfamily, Peroxiredoxin5 (Prx5) possesses special properties, such as its enzymatic mechanism, wide subcellular distribution and high affinity for peroxides and peroxynitrite. Prx5 plays a crucial role in oxidative stress, immune responses, cell apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, intracellular signaling, the modulation of gene expression, ecdysis, etc. In this paper, we obtained a full-length Prx5 cDNA sequence (designated PmPrx5) from black tiger shrimp (P. monodon). The full-length PmPrx5 cDNA sequence was 1686 bp containing a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 76 bp with two nucleotide sequences (AAA), a 3' UTR of 1040 bp with a poly (A) tail and two canonical polyadenylation signal sequences (AATAAA), and an open reading frame of 570 bp encoding 189 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 20\u202fkDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 6.29. Phylogenetic trees and multiple sequence alignment showed that the PmPrx5 had strong homology with Prx5 proteins from other species, such as similarity with Palaemon carinicauda (69%) and Macrobrachium rosenbergii (69%), containing the highly conserved functional domain. PmPrx5 mRNA was ubiquitously detected in all tested tissues. After P. monodon was exposed to pathogenic bacteria, osmotic pressure, acidity and alkalinity and the heavy metal, the mRNA expression of PmPrx5 in the gills and hepatopancreas was significantly enhanced (P\u202f<\u202f0.01) because of the immune response and declined with heavy metal copper and cadmium challenges as time progressed. The recombinant PmPrx5 protein purified in E. coli (DE3) was further confirmed to exhibit antioxidant activity and antibacterial properties to a certain extent using a bacterial growth inhibition test in both liquid and solid cultures in vitro. E. coli transformed with pRSET-PmPrx5 were dramatically protected in response to metal toxicity stress. Thus, PmPrx5 may be developed as a potential therapeutic drug against pathogenic bacteria and as a biomarker for pollutant levels. This work offers useful clues to further explore the functional mechanism of Prx5 in marine shrimp immunity.",

        "abstract": "Chk1 is a cell-cycle regulator. Chk1 has been identified in organisms ranging from yeast to humans, but few researchers have studied Chk1 in shrimps. We cloned Chk1 from the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon). The full-length cDNA sequence of PmChk1 had 3,334 base pairs (bp), with an open reading frame of 1,455 bp. The complete genomic sequence of PmChk1 (11,081 bp) contained 10 exons separated by nine introns. qRT-PCR showed that PmChk1 was highly expressed in the ovaries and gills of P. monodon. The lowest PmChk1 expression was noted in stage III of ovarian development in P. monodon. PmChk1 expression decreased significantly after injection of 5-hydroxytryptamine and eyestalk ablation in P. monodon ovaries. RNA interference experiments were undertaken to examine the expression of PmChk1, PmCDC2, and PmCyclin B. PmChk1 knockdown in the ovaries and hepatopancreas by dsRNA-Chk1 was successful. The localization and level of PmChk1 expression in the hepatopancreas was studied using in situ hybridization, which showed that data were in accordance with those of qRT-PCR. The Gonadosomatic Index of P. monodon after dsRNA-Chk1 injection was significantly higher than that after injection of dsRNA-GFP or phosphate-buffered saline. These data suggest that PmChk1 may have important roles in the ovarian maturation of P. monodon.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The purpose of this paper is to study dynamic characteristics of the AP1000 reactor during control rod sequence exchange (CRSE) operations under the Mechanical Shim (MSHIM) control strategy so as to assess the feasibility of and further optimize the CRSE logic. For this purpose, a dynamic simulation platform was developed in MATLAB/Simulink environment first, with implementation of a one-dimensional nodal core model and the reactor power control system integrating the basic MSHIM control logic and the CRSE logic. Based on the platform, simulation studies of typical CRSE transients of the AP1000 reactor at the beginning of cycle life (BOC), middle of cycle life (MOC) and end of cycle life (EOL) have been performed to determine the performance of the current CRSE design. From the simulation results, impacts of the CRSE operations on the reactor power and axial power difference have been analyzed. It shows that the AP1000 reactor can accomplish the CRSE operations smoothly and safely implementing the CRSE logic. To further improve the control performance of the reactor during CRSE operations, the trigger rod position, a key factor in the CRSE design, has been optimized with the optimization results assessed through dynamic simulations against the above CRSE transients. The simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the optimization.",

        "abstract": "Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) is part of the enzymatic antioxidant system that can eliminate the peroxides produced as effect of reactions of molecules with reactive oxygen species (ROS). We cloned two different GPx genes from Penaeus monodon (black tiger shrimp). Bioinformatics sequence analysis showed that PmGPx1 and PmGPx7 encoded polypeptides of 207 and 208 amino acids, respectively. PmGPx1 has a selenocysteine residue that is encoded by an opal codon 187TGA189. The PmGPx1 and PmGPx7 expression profiles were detected in the gills and hepatopancreas of the shrimps under osmotic stress, heavy metal exposure and bacterial infection, and the results suggested that PmGPx1 and PmGPx7 are involved in the responses to these stimuli. The recombinant PmGPx1 and PmGPx7 protein was expressed and purified through affinity chromatography and was refolded successfully using ion-exchange chromatography, which were used to measure antioxidant activity, and the results revealed that the rPmGPx1 and rPmGPx7 protein could catalyze the redox reaction between GSH and HO. This study provides useful information to help further understand the functional mechanism of the GPx family in the immunity of P. monodon.",

The accuracy, practicality, and timeliness of the driving intention identification model are its key issues. In this paper, a novel driver\u2019s braking intention identification model based on the Gaussian mixture-hidden Markov model (GHMM) and generalized growing and pruning radial basis function neural network (GGAP-RBFNN) is proposed to improve the identification accuracy of the model. The simplest brake pedal and vehicle speed data that are easily obtained from the vehicle are used as an observation sequence to improve practicality of the model. The data of the pressing brake pedal stage are used to identify the braking intention to improve the timeliness of the model. The experimental data collected from real vehicle tests are used for off-line training and online identification. The research results show that the accuracy of driver\u2019s braking intention identification model based on the GHMM/GGAP-RBFNN hybrid model is 94.69% for normal braking and 95.57% for slight braking, which are, respectively, 26.55% and 17.72% higher than achieved by the GHMM. In addition, the data of the pressing brake pedal stage are used for intention identification, which is 1.2\u00a0s faster than that of the existing identification model based on the GHMM.",

        "abstract": "The vehicle stability control system is the important technology in the field of automotive active safety and is a difficult issue and hot-point in the vehicle dynamics control research. The dual-motor drive electric vehicle (EV) is greatly different from traditional fuel vehicles in the dynamic characteristics, the complexity of actuator and the actuator response characteristics. Therefore, it is of great significance to study on the control strategy of the stability control system in the dual-motor drive EV to make it more efficient and stable. A hierarchical control strategy for the stability of dual-motor drive EV is proposed in this paper. The upper layer of controller, the decision of additional yaw moment, is constructed by using the model predictive control (MPC). And the lower layer of controller, the additional yaw moment distribution layer, is constructed basing on the optimization theory. Finally, a test is carried under the condition of double lane change on the platform of the dual-motor drive EV which is based on A&D5435. The results show that the maximum yaw rate with stability control decreases by 44.78%, and the maximum sideslip angle with stability control decreases by 48.75%. It can be concluded that the stability control system can work in normal using this control strategy, which effectively improve the stability of the vehicle.",

The 40NSCO\u201360CNO oxygen permeable membrane was prepared via an in situ one-pot one-step EDTA\u2013citric acid method. The crystal structure of the 40NSCO\u201360CNO dual phase material was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in situ XRD. The microstructure was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). The results show that the 40NSCO\u201360CNO composite represents a micro-scale mixture of only the two pure phases NSCO and CNO. The oxygen permeation fluxes through the 40NSCO\u201360CNO dual phase membrane were measured at elevated temperatures (900\u20131000 \u00b0C) with one side of it exposed to synthetic air and the other side to a flowing He gas stream. A stable oxygen permeation rate of 0.90 mL cm\u22122 min\u22121 was obtained with a 0.4 mm thick membrane under an air/He oxygen partial pressure gradient at 1000 \u00b0C. The 40NSCO\u201360CNO dual phase membrane with a thickness of 0.6 mm showed a stable oxygen flux of 0.55 mL cm\u22122 min\u22121 at 950 \u00b0C for 100 h under pure CO2 sweeping.",

Private information leakage from loudspeaker sound is often assumed to be preventable using sound-proof isolators like walls. In this paper, we explore a new acoustic eavesdropping attack that can subvert such protectors using radio devices. Our basic idea lies in an acoustic-radio transformation (ART) algorithm, which recovers loudspeaker sound by inspecting the subtle disturbance it causes to the radio signals generated by an adversary or by its co-located WiFi transmitter. ART builds on a modeling framework that distills key factors to determine the recovered audio quality. It incorporates diversity mechanisms and noise suppression algorithms that can boost the eavesdropping quality. We implement the ART eavesdropper on a software-radio platform and conduct experiments to verify its feasibility and threat level. When targeted at vanilla PC or smartphone loudspeakers, the attacker can successfully recover high-quality audio even when blocked by sound-proof walls. On the other hand, we propose several pragmatic countermeasures that can effectively reduce the attacker's audio recovery quality by orders of magnitude.",

        "abstract": "Full-duplex radio technology is becoming mature and holds potential to boost the spectrum efficiency of a point-to-point wireless link. However, a fundamental understanding is still lacking, with respect to its advantage over half-duplex in multi-cell wireless networks with contending links. In this paper, we establish a spatial stochastic framework to analyze the mean network throughput gain from full-duplex, and pinpoint the key factors that determine the gain. Our framework extends classical stochastic geometry analysis with a new tool-set, which allows us to model a trade-off between the benefit from concurrent full-duplex transmissions and the loss of spatial reuse, particularly for CSMA-based transmitters with random backoff. The analysis derives closed-form expressions for the full-duplex gain as a function of link distance, interference range, network density, and carrier sensing schemes. It can be easily applied to guide the deployment choices during the early stage of network planning.",

        "abstract": "The phytohormone cytokinin (CK) is not only essential for plant growth and development but also impacts plant immunity. A mutant screen in a constitutively active plant immune receptor mutant snc1 (suppressor of npr1, constitutive1) identified a suppressor mutation of SNC1-induced defense responses in an ABC transporter coding gene ABCG14. ABCG14 transports CK from roots to the shoots, and the suppression of the SNC1-mediated defense response by the loss of ABCG14 is due to a deficiency of trans-zeatin (tZ)-type CK in the shoot. In addition, exogenous application of the tZ-type CK enhances disease resistance associated with increased expression of the plant immune receptor gene SNC1. Taken together, this study further established the role of tZ-type CK in disease resistance and suggests a new intersection of CKs with plant immunity at the expression regulation of a plant immune receptor gene.",

        "abstract": "The bulbs of plants belonging to the  Fritillaria cirrhosa- group have been used as antitussive and expectorant herbs in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. In this study, we isolated two isomers of verticinone and imperialine, steroidal alkaloids belonging to the cevanine group, from bulbs of  Fritillaria wabuensis , which is a part of the  Fritillaria cirrhosa  group, and investigated their anti-inflammatory effects and relative mechanisms on lipopolysaccharide - stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Our results clearly demonstrate that verticinone or imperialine could dose-dependently inhibit nitric oxide production and also suppress inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expressions. In addition, verticinone or imperialine suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a dose dependent manner, such as tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1  and interleukin-1 \u03b2 . The effect of verticinone and imperialine on the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB was also evaluated. The phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappaB stimulated with LPS is also down-regulated by verticinone or imperialine in a concentration dependent manner, which coincided with the inhibition of phosphorylation forms of inhibitory kappaB- \u03b1 , a crucial inhibitory factor of nuclear factor-kappaB. Generally, the anti-inflammatory effects and mechanisms of verticinone and imperialine are mediated by the inhibition of the nuclear factor-kappaB activation signaling pathway. According to the results of our researches, verticinone and imperialine may present great potentials to be developed as therapeutics for inflammatory diseases.",

PEF treated samples improved meat tenderness and colour. However increased fat oxidation and increased saturated fatty acids were evident in PEF processed frozen samples.

These flows usually occur in the southwestern mountainous area of China during the rainy season, causing tangible and non-tangible damages; therefore, it is crucial to study their dynamic characteristics. An experimental campaign was conducted to replicate three processes typical of debris flows: (i) formation; (ii) propagation; and (iii) accumulation. Different flow rates, soil composition and flume slopes were applied. Multiple experimental parameters were quantified for each test conducted such as pore water pressure and velocity and a series of regression analyses were used to determine the relative impact of each experimental variable on these recorded parameters. The results showed that the flowrate and the vertical grading coefficient associated with the soil composition have the maximum and the minimum influence on the formation of debris flows and propagation velocities measured, respectively. This result is significant and needs to be considered when planning or designing control measures to reduce the impacts of debris flows.",

Unfortunately, riverbank degradation can cause societal impacts such as property loss and sedimentation of in-stream structures, as well as environmental impacts such as water quality impact. The frequency, magnitude, and impact of riverbank collapse events in China and worldwide are forecasted to increase under climate change. To understand and mitigate the risk of riverbank collapse, experimental/field data in real conditions are required to provide robust calibration and validation of hydraulic and mathematical models. This paper presents an experimental set of tests conducted to characterize riverbank erosion and sediment transport for banks with slopes of 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 75\u00b0, and 90\u00b0 and quantify the amount of sediments transported by the river, deposited within the bank toe or settled in the riverbed after having been removed due to erosion. The results showed interesting comprehension about the characterization of riverbank erosion and sediment transport along the river. These insights can be used for calibration and validation of new and existing numerical models.",

        "abstract": "Glucuronidation by uridine 5-diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase enzymes (UGTs) is a cause of intrinsic drug resistance in cancer cells. Glucuronidation of combretastatin A-4 (CA-4) was previously identified as a mechanism of resistance in hepatocellular cancer cells. Herein, we propose chemical manipulation of \u03b2-lactam bridged analogues of Combretastatin A-4 as a novel means of overcoming drug resistance associated with glucuronidation due to the expression of UGTs in the CA-4 resistant human colon cancer HT-29\u00a0cells. The alkene bridge of CA-4 is replaced with a \u03b2-lactam ring to circumvent potential isomerisation while the potential sites of glucuronate conjugation are deleted in the novel 3-substituted-1,4-diaryl-2-azetidinone analogues of CA-4. We hypothesise that glucuronidation of CA-4 is the mechanism of drug resistance in HT-29\u00a0cells. Ring B thioether containing 2-azetidinone analogues of CA-4 such as 4-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)-3-phenyl-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)azetidin-2-one (27) and 3-hydroxy-4-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)azetidin-2-one (45) were identified as the most potent inhibitors of tumour cell growth, independent of UGT status, displaying antiproliferative activity in the low nanomolar range. These compounds also disrupted the microtubular structure in MCF-7 and HT-29\u00a0cells, and caused G/M arrest and apoptosis. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential of chemical manipulation as a means of overcoming glucuronidation attributed drug resistance in CA-4 resistant human colon cancer HT-29\u00a0cells, allowing the development of therapeutically superior analogues.",

A series of 3-vinyl-\u03b2-lactams (2-azetidinones) were designed, synthesized and evaluated as potential tubulin polymerization inhibitors, and for their antiproliferative effects in breast cancer cells. These compounds showed potent activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells with an IC value of 8 nM for compound  4-[3-Hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl]-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-vinylazetidin-2-one) which was comparable to the activity of Combretastatin A-4. Compound  had minimal cytotoxicity against both non-tumorigenic HEK-293T cells and murine mammary epithelial cells. The compounds inhibited the polymerisation of tubulin in vitro with an 8.7-fold reduction in tubulin polymerization at 10 \uf06dM for compound  and were shown to interact at the colchicine-binding site on tubulin, resulting in significant G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Immunofluorescence staining of MCF-7 cells confirmed that \u03b2-lactam  is targeting tubulin and resulted in mitotic catastrophe. A docking simulation indicated potential binding conformations for the 3-vinyl-\u03b2-lactam  in the colchicine domain of tubulin.

A numerical simulation model established from laboratory experimental results was used to predict fluid behaviour and influence factors of immiscible CO2 flooding in thick reservoirs with positive rhythm to enhance oil recovery after water flooding. Injection and confining pressure conditions are both important to the displacement process and results.",

This study investigated the four main aspects of rice-grain quality, namely, milling (brown-rice, milled-rice, and head-rice percentage), appearance (length/width ratio, chalky-kernel percentage, and chalkiness), nutrition (protein content), and cooking and eating quality (apparent amylose content, gel consistency, and pasting viscosities) of two rice cultivars (Shendao 47 and Jingyou 586) under four N rates (0, 140, 180, and 220 kg ha\u22121), and three planting densities (25 \u00d7 104, 16.7 \u00d7 104, and 12.5 \u00d7 104 hills ha\u22121) in a field trial from 2015 to 2016. The four main aspects of rice-grain quality were significantly influenced by cultivar. Several aspects were affected by the interactions of N rate and cultivar. No significant interaction between N rate and plating density was detected for all grain-quality parameters. A higher N rate increased the percentages of brown rice and head rice, chalky-kernel percentage, and setback and peak time values, but reduced the length/width ratio, chalkiness, apparent amylose content, gel consistency, and peak-, trough-, and final-viscosity values. These results indicate that the N rate has a beneficial effect on milling and nutritional quality, but a detrimental effect on appearance and cooking and eating quality. Jingyou 586 and Shendao 47 had different responses to planting density in terms of grain quality. Our study indicates that low planting density for Jingyou 586, but a medium one for Shendao 47, is favorable for grain quality.",

        "abstract": "With three panicle types of rice varieties and hybrids in Liaoning as entries, the effects of spacing of Japonica rice on light interception capacity, population light distribution, light conversion efficiency at full heading stage and yield were studied. The results showed that the leaf area indices at full heading stage, closely related to light interception, increased first and then decreased with the decrease of transplanting density. The extinction coefficient in one day increased first and then decreased, and the K value increased with the increase of planting density. Yield was positively correlated with canopy extinction coefficient and inclinations of the upper three leaves. In terms of energy efficiency, the yields were positively correlated to flag leaf stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration and transpiration rate. At the configuration of high (15 cm x 25 cm) and low (20 cm x 30 cm and 20 cm x 35 cm) densities, Japonica rice could increase light interception capability and optical conversion efficiency, but could not obtain high and stable yields due to limitation by lodging and panicles of per unit area, respectively. At the configurations of 15 cm x 30 cm and 20 cm x 25 cm, it was easy to get adequate panicles, optimize the structure of the canopy, reduce lodging risk, and obtain high yield.",
