        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the regulatory effect of a realtime insulin titration model on comatose stroke patients complicated with hyperglycemia.Methods A total of 110 stroke patients with coma whose blood glucose (BG) levels were >10.0 mmol/L detected more than twice within 12 hours after admission were randomly assigned into control group (n=35), treatment group\u2160 (n=37, every one-hour titration group) and treatment group\u2161 (n=38, every 2-hour titration group). Humulin 70/30, a premixed insulin, was injected subcutaneously in the control group. Novolin R was given intravenously by minipump in both treatment group\u2160and\u2161, the dose was according to the BG values.The incidence of nosocomial infection and its effect on neurological prognosis in each group were analyzed.Results The mean values of BG in treatment group was lower than that of the control group(8.9\u00b12.5 mmol/L vs. 12.7\u00b13.1 mmol/L([P=0.000]). The success rate of maintaining ideal BG level was higher than the control group(57.8% vs. 17.5%[P=0.000]), the incidence of hypoglycemia (<3.9mmol/L) were all 1.5% (P=0.719). The mean BG value of group \u2160 was lower than that of group\u2161,(7.9\u00b11.7 mmol/L and 9.3\u00b12.7mmol/L[P=0.000]); The success rate of maintaining ideal BG level of group \u2160 was higher than that of group\u2161(65.5% vs. 42.6%[P=0.000]); the rate of hypoglycemia of group \u2160 was lower than that of group\u2161(1.1% vs. 2.2%[P=0.003]). The nosocomial infection rate in the treatment groups was significantly lower than that in the control group (10.7% vs. 25.7%[\u03c72=4.135,P=0.042]), while there was no significant difference between the group\u2160and \u2161 (8.1% vs. 13.2%[\u03c72=0.113,P>0.05]). The neurological prognosis of treatment group was better than the control group. The modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores in the control group were higher than those in the 2 treatment groups(F=4.377, P=0.015), indicating that the neurological prognosis in both treatment groups was better than that in the control group.Conclusions The continuous monitoring and regulation of BG level with every one-hour titration model is effective and superior to the two-hour titration group.The realtime insulin titration model may promptly, effectively and continuously regulate the BG level of comatose stroke patients with hyperglycemia.The realtime insulin titration model is also beneficial to reduce the nosocomial infection rate and improve neurological recovery.",

[Method] 80 aneurysmal SAH patients were divided into two groups according to their Fisher Grade:minor SAH group (Fisher Grade 1~2) and severe SAH group(Fisher Grade 3-4).Early ECG changes and myocardial enzyme and structural protein abnormality were monitored and recorded to evaluate severity of heart damage. [Result] In 38 cases with minor SAH, 24 showed early ECG abnormolity (10 with ST-T change) and 13 showed abnormality of myocardial enzyme or structural protein. While in 42 cases with severe SAH, 37 showed early ECG abnormolity (26 with ST-T change), 24 showed abnormality of myocardial enzyme or structural protein. The rate of ECG and myocardial enzyme or structural protein abnormality are signifcantly different between the two groups (P <0.05).

        "abstract": "Traumatic intracranial aneurysms present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Owing to their fragile nature, endovascular intervention has become the first-line treatment; however, direct surgery has an advantage in certain cases.A 34-year-old man in coma was admitted after a motor vehicle accident. Brain computed tomographic scans revealed deep bifrontal, left intraventricular, and subarachnoid hemorrhages. Three-dimensional computed tomographic angiography and digital subtraction angiography revealed an aneurysm arising from the left pericallosal artery.A massive intracerebral hematoma prompted us to perform emergency surgical intervention. We immediately removed the hematoma and extirpated the aneurysm. After hematoma evacuation via the interhemispheric approach, a pulsating red sphere projecting from the pericallosal artery, with no obvious solid wall or neck, was encountered. While retracting the frontal lobe, it suddenly ruptured. Under temporary trapping of the parent artery, the point of bleeding was identified. No aneurysm wall or fibrous tissue was present, whereas a 1.5-mm laceration was observed at the pericallosal artery close to its branching point. The laceration was sutured with 10-0 nylon. Postoperative digital subtraction angiography confirmed patency of the pericallosal artery.Although recent technologic advances of intravascular surgery have enabled successful treatment of traumatic pseudoaneurysms, open surgical intervention still has some advantages of providing definitive hemostasis, allowing for parent artery reconstruction, and facilitating mass reduction. The case in the current study was quite unusual in that angiographic aneurysm had disrupted easily, leaving arterial laceration. This finding implies the probability of unavoidable parent artery occlusion when endovascular treatment is applied.",

        "abstract": "\u3010Objective\u3011To observe the dynamic changes of the activities of serum inflammatory cytokines in comatose intracerebral hemorrhagic patients at early stage after onset and their relationship with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome(MODS).\u3010Methods\u3011Eighty three comatose patients with intracerebral hemorrhage(ICH) were enrolled as ICH group in this prospective case control study from June 2010 to Dec 2011.Serum IL-1,IL-6 and IL10 activities in these patients were measured at days1,2,3 and 4 after admission to ICU,and the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome(SIRS),MODS during hospital stay were monitored and analyzed.Meanwhile,37 healthy elderly health-examinees from Punan Health Check Centre were also enrolled as control group.\u3010Results\u3011The serum activities of IL-1,IL-6 and IL-10(mmol/L) were significantly higher in ICH group at the day of admission than in the control group,47.8(36.3\uff5e77.8) versus(37.1\u00b11.4),25(16.2\uff5e69.2) versus(10.1\u00b11.8) and 8.4(7.0\uff5e9.8) versus(4.5\u00b11.8),respectively,all P values were 0.000.The serum activities of both IL-1 and IL-10 rose to peak at day 2,and decreased at day 4 after admission,while IL-6 activity remained less changed.The incidence of MODS was positively correlated with blood glucose level,APACHE-II scores,as well as serum IL-10 activity,and negatively with IL-6 activity.The Logistic regression equation was: Y =logit(odds)=-8.805-0.024\u00d7IL-6(pg/mL)+ 0.380\u00d7IL-10(pg/mL)+1.917\u00d7blood glucose(mmol/L)+0.290\u00d7APACHE-II score(points).\u3010Conclusions\u3011The activities of serum IL-1,IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly increased with dynamic kinetics in comatose patients with intracerebral hemorrhage at early stage after onset.Hyperglycemia,APACHE-II scores and serum IL-10 activity are predisposing factors for the incidence of MODS.",

Presently the evaluation of overall energy efficiency of the internal shading is perceptual and qualitative. Therefore, the tests of the internal surface temperatures of house envelopes and the daylighting illuminance were carried out. It is shown that the surface temperature of interior walls with internal shading are 0.6\u00b0C~1\u00b0C lower than those without; however, the surface temperature of internal shading is 3\u00b0C~5\u00b0C higher than that of the interior walls. It can be seen that internal shading also forms an indoor heat source. The energy consumption of air-conditioning with internal shading decreases by 17.24% than that without, which indicates the internal shading can certainly reduce the indoor air conditioning load; however, the daylighting illuminance declines by 81%, with the results that the artificial lighting energy consumption is 1.88 times as much as that without the internal shading.",

On the other hand, contracted with the measured values, because of the calculated value often based on some assumptions and neglect of conditions, it has to have some bias which has great influence on the practical applications. To solve the above problems, the ground heat exchanger measure apparatus that researched and developed by authors was used for the test of input conditions of calculation and the test of the heat transfer rate of ground heat exchanger. Test results show that the use of test equipment can effectively resolve the input conditions in calculation and the requirement of the comparison of calculated values and measured value, and it is the effective methods for obtaining key parameters of ground-source heat pump system design. \u00a92010 IEEE.",

Then, the amount of infrared energy that penetrated the atmospheric infrared window was determined, based on the coupling analysis of urban radiation energy and atmospheric transmittance. Six typical urban surface materials were researched in this case study. The results showed that the transmittance was changed under different weather conditions and different urban surface materials had different infrared energy penetration of the atmospheric infrared window, which indicated different urban surface materials may have potentially different effects on the urban thermal environment. The results also indicated that the transmittance for different materials was affected not only by atmospheric transmittance but also by the distribution of emitted infrared energy along wavelengths, which provides a new perspective for related researchers to understand the phenomenon.",

Two buildings were monitored during the day over two weeks in the summer period. One was a completed building that had been fully operational for several years. This building is termed the \u2018non-renovated\u2019 building. The other was a commercial building of similar age that was currently undergoing renovation on one of the main retail floors. This building is termed the \u2018partial renovation\u2019 building. The results of the study show that indoor TVOC pollution is a prominent issue in commercial buildings with typical pollution rates exceeding recommended standard levels by 58.9% (partial renovation) and 19.6% (non-renovated), respectively. There were significant correlations between indoor environmental parameters, especially the three indoor air pollutants (pu003c0.05, Spearman). The three main factors i...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Thermal parameters and concentrations of CO 2 , TVOC and formaldehyde were monitored in shopping malls in four western cities in China during summer. Simultaneously, questionnaire subjective surveys were carried out to investigate the indoor perception of air quality and Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) among staffs in the shopping malls. It was found that stuffy odor had significant correlation with the overall odors perception and staff in the shopping malls had noticeable SBS. Instrument measurement showed that mall C had higher pollution levels of TVOC, while formaldehyde concentrations were higher in mall X and L. Pollution level in the malls is influenced by many factors, and three factors (customer density, ventilation conditions, emission characteristic of merchandise) were discussed in the analysis of data from the four malls. For customer density, the concentrations of CO 2  on weekends were higher than on weekdays. Daily CO 2  concentration was positively correlated with customer flow rate, but there was no significant strong correlation between customer flow rate and TVOC/formaldehyde concentrations. Underground floors had poorer indoor air quality than over-ground because of lack of fresh air. As for the merchandise sections, the formaldehyde in the home textile section in mall X reached 1.15\u00a0mg/m 3  with an over standard rate of 83.3% due to the new merchandise added. This paper makes a contribution to knowledge relating to the reasons for discomfort in shopping malls by contributing multiple investigations on contaminants together with information on human perception and the operation of air conditioning systems within the stores.",

Ordovician reservoir, as the main reservoir bed in the Tahe oilfield, accounts for 75% of total production. Hercynian and Middle Caledonian karstification had a great control on the Ordovician carbonate reservoirs of the Tahe oilfield. Hercynian or middle Caledonian karstification can be distinguished by plane distribution of karst reservoirs, fillings of fracture and cavity, paleontology, strontium isotope composition, carbon\u2014oxygen stable isotope composition, rare earth elements content, homogenization temperature and fluorescence of fluid inclusion, etc. Tectonic movements, unconformity, ancient physiognomy and lithology are the controlling factors of Hercynian karst, among which tectonic movements is the most important factor. Tectonic movements, unconformity and lithology are the controlling factors of Middle Caledonian karst. Hercynian ancient physiognomy varied greatly and played an important role in the development of Ordovician carbonate reservoirs, while middle Caledonian ancient physiognomy varied slightly and did not control Ordovician carbonate reservoirs obviously. Hercynian and Middle Caledonian Ordovician reservoirs are evaluated respectly based on the controlling factors of karst reservoirs.",

A shallow acceptor level of \u223c140 meV Is identified by temperaturedependent photoluminescence. A piezoelectric output of 60 mV on average has been received using the doped NWs. Besides a control on NW aspect ratio and density, band gap engineering has also been achieved by alloying with Mg to a content of x = 0.23. The alloyed NWs with controllable conductivity type have potential application In high-efficiency all-ZnO NWs based LED, high-output ZnO nanogenerator, and other optical or electrical devices. \u00a9 2009 American Chemical Society.",

The detailed physical and chemical growth processes regarding the formation of the nanowires have been investigated using mass spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry analysis, as well as structure analysis by electron microscopy. In reference to Gibbs energy calculation, our study reveals that the growth relies on the decomposition of MoO2 vapors through condensation of its vapor at high substrate temperatures. The aligned growth is a result of competing growth with the nanowires normal to the substrate surface reaching the final growth front. The field emission measurement and the vacuum luminescent tube study show that the Mo nanowires have potential application as electron emitters.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic magnetite (Fe3O4) nanocrystals have been synthesized by combining nonhydrolytic reaction with seed-mediated growth. The shape of these magnetite nanocrystals can be controlled either as pure spheres or a mixture of mainly faceted nanocrystals. Faceted magnetite nanocrystals consist of truncated tetrahedral platelets (TTPs), truncated octahedrons (TOs), and octahedrons (OTs). Transmission electron microscopy analysis indicates that the faceted nanocrystal mixture tends to self-segregate based upon the shape in a self-assembly process, and each shape forms its own distinct crystallographic orientation-ordered superlattice assemblies. Self-assemblies of the Fe3O4 nanocrystals in the shapes of TTP, TO, and OT show hexagonal, primitive cubic, and distorted body-centered cubic (bcc) superlattice structures, respectively. The possible mechanism for the formation of different superstructures is attributed to van der Waals interactions. Nanocrystals with different shapes provide diverse building blocks for bottom-up approaches in building nano- and mesosystems. Furthermore, the self-segregation phenomenon of different shaped nanocrystals in self-assembly processes could be very important in envisioning efficient assembly strategies for nanoscience- and nanotechnology-based devices.",

We report here on a novel yet simple method to synthesize in large yields a very active platinum nanocatalyst; the multiarmed nanostar single crystal. We utilize a seed mediated method using tetrahedral nanoparticles that are also synthesized by a new and simple technique. High-resolution TEM shows that the nanostar has many arms, varying from a few to over 30, whereby even the largest ones are found to have single-crystal structures. This strongly suggests that they are formed by a growth mechanism of the seed crystals and not by the aggregation of seed crystals, which should produce twinning planes. Due to the reduction reaction of ferrricyanide by thiosulfate, the nanostars are found to have an activation energy, which is nearly 60% of that of the tetrahedral seeds themselves, both having the same PVP capping agent. This is undoubtedly due to the multiarms with edges, corners, and the presence of high indexed facets in the nanostar catalyst.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a controlled, large scale fabrication of mesoporous ZnO thin films. The entire ZnO mesoporous film is one piece of a single crystal, while high porosity made of nanowalls is present. The growth mechanism was proposed in comparison with the growth of ZnO nanowires. The ZnO mesoporous film was successfully applied as a gas sensor. The fabrication and growth analysis of the mesoporous ZnO thin film give general guidance for the controlled growth of nanostructures. It also provides a unique structure with a superhigh surface-to-volume ratio for surface-related applications. and nanohelices.3-7 Among them, aligned ZnO NWs with controlled size, growth direction, and surfaces have shown great potential for building nanodevices with superior mechanical, electrical, optical, and piezoelectric properties. It has been discovered that the aligned ZnO NWs sometimes came with a continuous sheet-like structure connecting the bottom of the NWs. Once the sheet became dominant, a new morphology called nanowalls appeared.8,9 As a quasi-two-dimensional nano- structure with a high porosity, the vertically aligned ZnO nanowalls exhibit great promise for sensors, fuel cells, solar cells, and catalysts.10 Although formation mechanisms have been proposed, lack of rational control makes the nanowall often be accompanied by aligned ZnO NWs that stand directly above, and receiving a single-phased nanowall structure becomes more or less unpredictable In this paper, we report a controlled growth of single crystal mesoporous ZnO thin films composed of vertically aligned ZnO walls. After analyzing the growth condition and structure of the mesoporous films, we present a general understanding on the vapor concentration-induced growth orientation selection. Guided by this discovery, formation of NWs with the nanowall structure can be intentionally turned on and off so that a single- phased nanowall structure was observed repetitively. A potential application of the film as a gas sensor has also been demonstrated. 2. Experimental Section The mesoporous ZnO film was fabricated in a double tube system. In this system, an alumina tube with 2-in. inner diameter (ID) was place inside a tube furnace with both ends sealed by a metal cap. Then a 95% Ar/5% O2 mixture was introduced into the tube as carrying and reactive gases at a total flow rate of 50 sccm. The source materials (a mixture of 0.3 g of ZnO powder and 0.3 g of graphite power) were loaded at the center of a 20 cm long quartz tube with 0.5-in. inner diameter. The substrate used for the growth is a GaN epitaxial film grown on single crystal alumina substrate. The substrate was covered by a layer of 0.4 nm thick Au as catalyst and was placed at one end of the small tube. The small quartz tube was then positioned inside the alumina tube with both tube centers aligned together and the substrate pointing downstream of the gas flow. At a tube vacuum of 20 torr, the tube furnace was heated up to 950 \u00b0C at a rate of 50 \u00b0C /min and the substrate was located in the \u223c700 \u00b0C temperature zone. The temperature and vacuum were held steady for 2 h for ZnO deposition. Then the furnace was turned off, and the tube was cooled to room temperature with the vacuum unchanged.",

        "title": "Profile imaging of reconstructed polar and non-polar surfaces of ZnO",
        "abstract": "The atomic scale surface structures of ZnO ( 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ) non-polar as well as ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) and \u00b1(0 0 0 1) polar surfaces have been directly imaged by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The observations were made on clean surfaces created by irradiating a single ZnO nanobelt using 400 keV electron beam in TEM, under which ZnO dots were grown epitaxially and in situ on the surface of the nanobelt. A technique is demonstrated for directly distinguishing the surface polarity of the \u00b1(0 0 0 1) polar surfaces. For the ( 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ) non-polar surface, HRTEM images and simulation results indicate that the Zn ions in the first and second layer suffer from inward and outward relaxation, respectively; the oxygen ions in the first and second layer prefer shifting to vicinal Zn ions to shorten the bonding distance. For the oxygen-terminated ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) polar surface, the oxygen ions at the outmost top layer were directly imaged. a \u00d7 2 reconstruction has also been observed at the ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) surface, and its atomic structure has been proposed based on image simulation. Oxygen-terminated ( 0 0 0 1 \u00af ) polar surface is flat and shows no detectable reconstruction. For the Zn-terminated (0 0 0 1) polar surface, HRTEM may indicate the existence of Zn vacancies and a possibly c -axis, random outward displacement of the top Zn ions. Our data tend to support the mechanism of removal of surface atoms for maintaining the stability of (0 0 0 1) polar surfaces. Keywords Surface structure High-resolution transmission electron microscopy Profile image Zinc oxide Polar surface 1 Introduction ZnO is an interesting and important II\u2013VI semiconductor for both applications and basic researches owing to its unique physical and chemical properties [1] . The electronic properties of the ZnO surfaces are particularly important for its application as chemical and gas sensor as well as catalyst for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation [2,3] . More importantly, ZnO has attracted considerable attention in nanotechnology for the unique structures and devices that it has offered [4\u20138] . For the ZnO nanostructures, with the increased surface-to-bulk ratio, the effect played by the surfaces, especially the polar surfaces, is critically important. As a result, various polar surface dominated nanostructure [9] such as nanobelts [10] , nanorings [11] , nanosprings [12,13] , and nanohelices [14] , have been found for wurtzite ZnO. The formation mechanism was attributed to the minimization of electrostatic interaction energy contributed by the ionic charges on the polar surfaces. From the crystal structural point of view, ZnO takes the hexagonal wurtzite structure with space group as P 6 3 mc [15] . Close-packed oxygen and zinc layers stack along the c -axis with alternating distances 0.69 \u00c5 and 1.99 \u00c5, respectively [16] . The exposed (0 0 0 1) and ( 0 0 0 1 \u00af ) surfaces are composed uniquely by Zn 2+ and O 2\u2212 ions, respectively, to form polar surfaces, while { 0 1 1 \u00af 0 } surfaces perpendicular to the c -axis are composed by Zn\u2013O dimers with neutral charge, forming the non-polar surfaces. The dangling bonds on such surfaces make the system unstable [17] . It was considered that the Zn\u2013O surface dimers on non-polar ( 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ) surface are energetically favorable after a slight tilting and an inward displacement into the volume [18] . However, the detailed configuration about the relaxation of the surface atoms is still controversial [19,20] . Furthermore, in contrast to most known oxides with polar surfaces, ZnO \u00b1(0 0 0 1) polar surfaces are quite stable without faceting or exhibiting massive surface reconstructions [21\u201323] . Electrostatic consideration as well as electronic structure calculation suggests that a rearrangement of charges on both outmost layers of a ZnO crystal may cancel the polarity [24] . The reduced surface charge density may occur through three possible mechanisms: (1) creation of surface state and transfer of negative charges from oxygen sites to Zn sites; (2) removal of surface atoms and (3) presence of positively or negatively charged impurity atoms on the oxygen or Zn-terminated surfaces [16] . It is still being debated which mechanism is the dominant one. Many works have been carried out to investigate ZnO surface reconstruction and the electronic structure by first principle calculations [25\u201329] and low-energy positron diffraction [30] , reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) [31] , low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) [32] , electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) [33] , He-atom scattering [34] , surface X-ray diffraction [20] , scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) [35] , and more [36\u201338] . Considering that high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) can provide real-space information about surface steps, terraces, and defects at atomic resolution, and it has been successfully applied in the study of surface reconstruction of many materials, such as CdTe and silicon [39\u201341] , in this paper, we use HRTEM to study the reconstruction of clean ZnO surfaces formed in situ in TEM. By comparing the experimental images with simulated images based on the proposed models, the reconstruction and relaxation of surface atoms have been identified, providing direct evidence about the structural configuration of surface atoms. 2 Experimental The original sample was from the ZnO nanobelts prepared by a technique reported previously [10] . The suspended nanobelt has a growth direction of [ 01 1 \u00af 1 ] with large top and bottom surfaces of \u00b1 ( 2 1 \u00af 1 \u00af 0 ) ( Fig. 1 ). By irradiating a ZnO nanobelt with a 400 keV electron beam in a JEOL 4000EX HRTEM, ZnO quantum dots of \u223c5 nm in size with clean surfaces were formed in situ epitaxially on the ZnO nanobelt surfaces, as shown at the lower bottom part of the TEM image presented in Fig. 1 . The thickness of the quantum dots (QDs) is less than 3 nm and the surface is clean as formed in situ in an environment of 10 \u22128 Torr, providing an ideal sample for profile imaging of its surfaces. The HRTEM images of the ZnO quantum dots were recorded with the electron beam along [ 2 1 \u00af 1 \u00af 0 ] . The experimentally recorded images were compared to the simulated images for quantifying the surface reconstruction. The image simulation and processing were done using Cerius2 [42] and Gatan Digital Micrograph software, respectively. 3 Results and discussion For the understanding of the observed data, the atomic structure of ZnO is described in Fig. 2 , where the left- and right-hand sides correspond to the projections of the atomic model along [ 2 1 \u00af 1 \u00af 0 ] and [0 0 0 1] directions, respectively. Three types of surface plane are emphasized in Fig. 2 , ( 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ) , \u00b1(0 0 0 1) and \u00b1 ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) . The non-polar ( 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ) surface is composed of Zn\u2013O dimers. The oxygen-terminated polar surfaces are ( 0 0 0 1 \u00af ) and ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) , and the Zn-terminated polar surfaces are (0 0 0 1) and ( 0 1 1 \u00af 1 \u00af ) . To investigate the reconstructions of polar surfaces, the first step is to identify the Zn-terminated (0 0 0 1) and the oxygen-terminated ( 0 0 0 1 \u00af ) . In general, converged-beam electron diffraction (CBED) pattern has been used to identify the polarity of ZnO nanobelts [43,44] , but CBED works only when the sample thickness is rather thick in the range of >100 nm, which is too thick for HRTEM imaging. For the purpose of this study, we must find a way of identifying the polarity for samples of thinner than 5 nm. 3.1 Identification of the polar direction [0 0 0 1] By carefully examining the atomic model shown in Fig. 2 and high quality HRTEM images recorded along [ 2 1 \u00af 1 \u00af 0 ] in Fig. 3 , we found a way of uniquely identifying the positive c -axis in the HRTEM images. Fig. 3 a and b are two experimental HRTEM images recorded from the two side surfaces of the same belt shown in Fig. 1 . The top surface in Fig. 3 a and the bottom surface in Fig. 3 b belong to { 0 1 1 \u00af 0 } family planes. The polar direction should be along horizontal direction. Based on the model shown in Fig. 2 , the ideal projected distance between Zn1 and O2, O1 and Zn2 is a / 6 \u2248 1.33 \u00c5 which is beyond the resolution limit of the HRTEM (\u223c1.7 \u00c5). But the distance between the Zn1 and O1 atoms is 0.3826 c \u2248 1.99 \u00c5, within the resolution power of the microscope. It means that the Zn1 and O1 can have separated contrast in the HRTEM images, while Zn1\u2013O2 and O1\u2013Zn2 dimers will just show a connected contrast like the distorted dark rods displayed in the images in Fig. 3 , which were recorded under Scherzer focus. In the experimental HRTEM images in Fig. 3 , the centers of the two nearby dark rods are located at the two sides of a horizontal line parallel to the ( 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ) surface. With considering the different scattering powers of heavy atom Zn and light atom O in mind, each of these dark rods are formed by a Zn\u2013O dimer, the two Zn atoms in the two nearby dimers like the Zn1 and Zn2 shown in Fig. 2 , are not aligned along a horizontal line parallel to ( 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ) plane, the contrast in the dark rods mostly comes from the heavy Zn atom, but the O does introduce a longer tail. Using this phenomenon, we can uniquely identify the Zn and oxygen sites in each dark rod or dimer as indicated by the inserted atomic model. For the Zn\u2013O dimer, if we define the Zn site to be the head and O being the tail, then the two adjacent dimers parallel to ( 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ) are oriented upward but towards each other with a head-to-tail configuration. In reference to the atomic model shown in Fig. 2 , it is clear that the head-to-tail direction is the [0 0 0 1]. Using this method, the polar directions [0 0 0 1] in Fig. 3 a and b has been marked. Fig. 3 a and b should have the same polar direction for they were recorded from opposite surfaces of the same belt as shown in Fig. 1 . The determination of positive and negative [0 0 0 1] directions makes the investigation on the reconstructions of oxygen and Zn-terminated polar surfaces possible. We need to emphasize that the quality of the recorded HRTEM images is critical to the polar direction identification; a small angle misalignment of the crystal can blur out the image and make it ambiguous for determining the polar direction. 3.2 The non-polar ( 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ) surface Fig. 4 a is a duplication of Fig. 3 a, in which some centers of the dark rods are marked by \u201c+\u201d. The two different distances h 1 \u2032 and h 2 \u2032 between the dark rod centers along [ 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ] direction have been labeled in Fig. 4 a. As mentioned above, the short dark rods also contain the contribution from oxygen ions. Therefore, the planar distance h 1 \u2032 in Fig. 4 a is smaller than h 1 as denoted in Fig. 2 , while h 2 \u2032 is larger than h 2 as denoted in Fig. 2 . The smaller distance h 1 \u2032 at surface compared to those underneath the surface and in the volume shows the possibility of surface reconstruction. The first layer Zn ions moving inward, the Zn ions in the second layer moving outward, or the combination of above two movements are the possibilities of the reconstruction. In order to clarify the detailed reconstruction configuration, HRTEM simulation has been carried out. The simulation conditions were sample thickness of 21.66 \u00c5 and Scherzer defocus: \u2212286.7 \u00c5, and Cs = 0.5 mm. The best matched simulation result shown in Fig. 4 b was based on the atomic model shown in Fig. 4 c, in which the Zn ions located in the first layer move inward and the Zn ions in the second layers move outward as the vertical arrowheads indicated. Such relaxation can give smaller h 1 and larger h 2 (planar distance) among the first three atomic layers. Compared the HRETM images in Fig. 3 a and b, the two dark short rods of the Zn\u2013O dimers at the surfaces are well separated in Fig. 3 a but not in Fig. 3 b. Two reasons may account for such a contrast change, crystal tilting and a shrinking in bonding distance for the Zn head and O tail dimer. The well-separated dark short rods in the volume rule out the first possibility. Based on the assumption of shrunk bonding distance for the Zn\u2013O surface dimers, the modified surface relaxation model is depicted in Fig. 5 c. Not only the Zn ions, but also the O ions in the first and second layer shift away from the ideal positions. Arrowheads in Fig. 5 c denote the shifting orientation of each surface ion. The best match between the simulated image displayed in Fig. 5 b and the experimental image in Fig. 5 a, which is a duplicated image of Fig. 3 b, supports our assumption. Based on the best fitted model in Fig. 5 c, the displacement of the Zn ions in the first and second surface layer can be estimated as \u221213% (inward) and 17% (outward) of d ( 01 1 \u00af 0 ) . The [0 0 0 1] direction displacement of the O at surface can be estimated to be 0.1 c \u223c 0.5 \u00c5 based on the simulated image. Because of the instrument resolution and the difficulty in locating the dark centers in the HRTEM images, the displacement of the relaxed ions may suffer from larger error, but the inward and outward movement of the Zn ions located in the first and second surface layers is confirmed. Our experimental results can help to build reasonable model for future theoretical calculation. In our HRTEM images of ( 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ) non-polar surface, there is no detectable relaxation beneath the second Zn\u2013O surface layer. From experimental point of view, only the relaxations of Zn and O ions in the first layer of ( 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ) non-polar surface were reported in the literatures. Duke et al. [18] concluded from their best LEED analysis that the first layer Zn ions were displaced downwards by \u22120.45 \u00b1 0.1 \u00c5 and the first layer O 2\u2212 by \u22120.05 \u00b1 0.1 \u00c5. The inward displacement of first layer Zn ions observed by G\u00f6pel et al. [19] was \u22120.4 \u00c5 in an angle-resolved photoemission experiment. In contrast Jedrecy et al. [20] found that the inward displacement of the first layer Zn ions was only \u22120.06 \u00b1 0.02 \u00c5 after fitting their grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) data. From the theoretical point of view, Wang and Duke [45] found a large displacement of Zn of \u22120.57 \u00c5, while Ivanov and Pollmann [28] obtained no displacement. The calculation based on shell model [46] predicted the displacement of Zn in the first layer and second layer were \u22120.25 \u00c5 and 0.165 \u00c5, respectively. The density-functional study by Meyer and Marx [25] gave the displacement of Zn in the first layer being \u22120.36 \u00c5. Different from the techniques used in above experiments, the HRTEM profile imaging in our study can observe the relaxation not only in first layer but also in the layers beneath the surface. Our HRTEM profile images reveal that the Zn ions inward and outward displacements in first and second layer were estimated around \u221213% d ( 01 1 \u00af 0 ) \u2248 0.37 \u00c5 and 17% d ( 01 1 \u00af 0 ) \u2248 0.48 \u00c5 , respectively and the in-plane movement of the Zn ions in surface is not detectable in our profile images. Our result on the displacement of Zn ions in the first layer has good agreement with the LEED results by Duke et al. [18] and the density-functional calculation by Meyer and Marx [25] . Due to the weak contrast of oxygen ions in HRTEM images, it is difficult to measure the displacement of oxygen ions directly from the HRTEM images. Based on the simulated results, two different relaxation cases on oxygen ions have been observed in our HRTEM profile images. There is no clear relaxation for the oxygen ions in Fig. 4 . In addition, in Fig. 5 , the relaxation on oxygen ions was confirmed. The best fitting HRTEM simulated image suggests the displacement of the oxygen ion in the first layer is around - 0.1 d ( 01 1 \u00af 0 ) + 0.1 c and to the oxygen ions in the second layer is \u223c0.1 c . 3.3 The ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) polar surface The ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) is another polar surface of the wurtzite ZnO. Fig. 6 a gives a HRTEM profile image of oxygen-terminated ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) polar surface. The head-to-tail arrangement of the dark rods directs the positive [0 0 0 1] direction. Therefore, the inclined surface at the right-hand side should be the oxygen-terminated ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) polar surface. The positions of the Zn corresponded dark contrast centers at surface remain the right stacking sequence as extended from the quantum dot volume. Besides the dark rods, several weak rods pointed by arrowheads appear at the outmost layer. In order to find out what corresponds to this contrast, we carried out HRTEM image simulation. The atomic model of a perfect ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) polar surface is displayed in Fig. 6 c. Although the surface is uniquely composed of oxygen ions, the oxygen ions at the surface can be divided into two groups, the oxygen ions in group \u201c2\u201d are pointed by arrowhead, oxygen ions in group \u201c1\u201d are those located in between the arrowheads (see Fig. 6 c). The [ 2 1 \u00af 1 \u00af 0 ] projected distances between these oxygen ions with their nearest Zn ions are 0.3826 c \u2248 1.99 \u00c5 (group 2) and a / 6 \u2248 1.33 \u00c5 (group 1). If there is no surface reconstruction, we are supposed to see the image of the oxygen ions belonging to group \u201c2\u201d at the surface in the HRTEM profile image, for the Zn\u2013O distance is beyond the instrument resolution (of 1.7 \u00c5). The simulated image based on the non-reconstructed surface model shown in Fig. 6 c is displayed in Fig. 6 b. The week rods pointed by arrowheads give the image of the oxygen ions. Comparing the simulated image in Fig. 6 b with the experimental one in Fig. 6 a, it is clear that the weak rods pointed by arrowheads in Fig. 6 a correspond to the image of surface oxygen ions. The direct observation of the oxygen ion image, on the other hand, reveals that there is no surface reconstruction occurred. The projected length of the ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) polar surface in Fig. 6 a is less than 3 nm, the surface reconstruction may be unnecessary for balancing the polar surface induced electrostatic energy due to the strong influence from the corners or edges. With expanding in surface area, the reconstruction of the ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) polar surfaces have been observed, as shown in Fig. 7 a and b. The positive [0 0 0 1] direction is identified following the rule discussed above. Then the inclined surfaces in Fig 7 a and b are determined as oxygen-terminated ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) polar surfaces. Instead of the periodically zig-zag shaped non-reconstructed surface, the surfaces in Fig. 7 a and b are rather flat. A new phenomenon of the reconstructed surface is the regularly arranged dips, which are indicated by arrowheads. The distance between the two adjacent dips in Fig. 7 b is twice of the size of the unit cell as shown in Fig. 6 c. Thus, the new surface shown in Fig. 7 b can be defined as a \u00d7 2 reconstruction. In order to retrieve the relaxed positions of Zn and oxygen ions at the surface, several surface models have been built. The best-fitting one is displayed in Fig. 8 . Taking the sample thickness as 21.66 \u00c5 and defocus \u2212286.7 \u00c5, the simulated HRTEM profile image is shown in Fig. 7 c. Same as the surface oxygen ions, the Zn ions just beneath the exposed oxygen layer can also be divided into two groups based on the [ 2 1 \u00af 1 \u00af 0 ] projected Zn\u2013O bonding distances. We use \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d to represent the Zn ions in Figs. 6 c and 8 .The Zn ions with shorter projected bonding distance belong to group \u201cA\u201d, and the Zn ions with longer projected bonding distance belong to group \u201cB\u201d. The reconstruction on the ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) polar surface is mainly related to the Zn ions of type B and its linked oxygen ions of type 2. If the type B Zn ion does not relax, the linked oxygen ion of type 2 will be displaced inward. If the oxygen ion of type 2 dose not shift, the connected Zn of type B will move outward. The real case in Fig. 7 a and b is that the Zn ions are displaced inward every other one. Although small inward displacement of oxygen ions of type 1 was observed in Fig. 8 , the displacement of type B Zn ions and type 2 oxygen ions is dominant. The outward displacement of Zn ions and the inward displacement of oxygen ions tend to minimize the electrostatic interaction energy introduced by the polar charges on the ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) surface. It is important to note that only oxygen-terminated ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) polar surfaces were observed in our experiments. We did not find Zn-terminated ( 0 1 1 \u00af 1 \u00af ) polar surface from the quantum dots. It may be related to its higher surface energy. To our knowledge, there is little study about the { 0 1 \u00af 1 1 } polar surface reconstruction. Our HRTEM profile images of the ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) polar surface may help understanding of the growth mechanism of \u00b1 ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) polar surface induced nanostructures, such as spring and helix shapes [47] . 3.4 The \u00b1(0 0 0 1) polar surfaces The faceted quantum dot in Fig. 9 gives the (0 0 0 1) and ( 0 0 0 1 \u00af ) polar surfaces. Checking the head-to-tail arrangement of the dark rods, the top surface can be identified as Zn-terminated (0 0 0 1) polar surface, while the bottom is the oxygen-terminated ( 0 0 0 1 \u00af ) polar surface. The [ 2 1 \u00af 1 \u00af 0 ] projected O\u2013Zn bonding distance in the (0 0 0 1) and ( 0 0 0 1 \u00af ) polar surfaces is around 1.33 \u00c5 for the non-reconstructed case, beyond the resolution of our instrument. Thus, we cannot distinguish the oxygen or Zn ions at the outmost surface layers. The contrast of short dark rods observed in HRTEM images contains the contributions from both oxygen and Zn ions. The contrast centers of the dark rods are picked up and represented by dots in Fig. 9 b using the Gatan Digital Micrograph software. The c -plane inter-planar distance does not show relaxation. However, compared to the flat ( 0 0 0 1 \u00af ) polar surface, the dark centers of the rods for the (0 0 0 1) polar surface may show a larger error bar. Fig. 10 shows two other HRTEM profile images of Zn-terminated (0 0 0 1) polar surface. The contrast centers of the Zn ion corresponded dark rods in Fig. 10 a are reproduced in Fig. 10 c. The contrast centers of the top layer have a larger height variation (around 0.7 \u00c5), while in the second and third layers, the variation just between 0.1 \u223c 0.3 \u00c5. Compared to the uniform contrast of the dark rods at ( 0 0 0 1 \u00af ) -O polar surface, the contrast of the dark rods at (0 0 0 1)-Zn polar surface displays a large difference. It has also been found that the shape of the dark rods at the (0 0 0 1)-Zn surface is different from that of the ( 0 0 0 1 \u00af ) -O, as indicated by an arrowhead in Fig. 9 a. More examples of such cases are presented in Fig. 10 as indicated by arrowheads, where the rod exhibits a longer tail for the (0 0 0 1)-Zn surface, while the one on ( 0 0 0 1 \u00af ) -O shows a rounded shape. We now use image simulation to find a possible clue for this difference. We now assumed a few cases as presented below. At the surface point \u201c1\u201d in Fig. 11 a, the Zn ion occupancy was decreased to 50%; at point \u201c2\u201d the Zn ions were shift outward for about 0.1 c ; at point \u201c3\u201d, the overlapped Zn ions suffer different shifted amplitudes (outward) away from the ideal position; at point \u201c4\u201d, the Zn ions were shift inward for about 0.1 c ; at point \u201c5\u201d, oxygen ions move outward; at point \u201c6\u201d, the Zn ions move inward while oxygen ions move outward. The simulated image for these models is displayed in Fig. 11 b by taking the sample thickness as 2 nm and focus as \u2212286.7 \u00c5. It is obvious that the low occupancy can introduce weak contrast at area \u201c1\u201d in Fig. 11 b. The contrast center is only sensitive to the shift of Zn, disregards the position of the oxygen (like the areas of \u201c4\u201d, \u201c5\u201d and \u201c6\u201d). The overlapped Zn ions suffering from different outward displacement produces a longer tail in the rod contrast like the area \u201c3\u201d in Fig. 11 . At the same time, the contrast center do not shift outward as much as the point \u201c2\u201d case. Thus, our data may suggest the \u201crandom\u201d outward displacement of the Zn ions in the top layer. Furthermore, the variation of the contrast at outmost layer may indicate the existence of Zn vacancies at (0 0 0 1) polar surface. For the Zn-terminated (0 0 0 1) surface, some experiments gave the evidence of the existence of the Zn vacancies [16,48] , but some are not [49] , The calculated displacement of the surface Zn ions was inward [25,27] , but the reported X-ray photo-diffraction [50] and coaxial impact-collision ion-scattering spectroscopy [31] suggested it is outward, which is consistent to our HRTEM result. Considering the three principal mechanisms [16] for the reduction in surface charge density as presented in the introduction section, the third mechanism of impurity atoms on the surface may not be the choice, for we grow ZnO quantum rod in TEM chamber in high vacuum condition and there are no detectable impurities. If the negative charges were transferred from O to Zn, the Zn ions should take inward displacement, which is in contrast to our experimental result. The variation of the Zn ion contrast was observed in our HRTEM images, the mechanism based on removal of surface atoms is comparatively consistent to our experimental data. For the oxygen-terminated ( 0 0 0 1 \u00af ) surface, low-energy alkali-metal ion scattering (LEIS) did not observe clear surface relaxation [49] while surface X-ray diffraction revealed \u22120.24 \u00b1 0.06 \u00c5 inward displacement of the surface oxygen ion [22] . Based on our HRTEM profile images, we cannot determine if there is an oxygen relaxation at the ( 0 0 0 1 \u00af ) polar surface, because it is impossible for us to separate the Zn and oxygen ions at surfaces. In addition, the contrast of oxygen ion is very weak in HRTEM profile images; therefore, there is a large measurement error when we face the profile images of ( 0 0 0 1 \u00af ) polar surface. 4 Summary In this paper, using the profile imaging of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), the surfaces of the small quantum dots of ZnO produced by irradiating a ZnO nanobelt in TEM have been studied. By comparing the observed image and the theoretically simulated images, the models of the surface structures are proposed. The main results are summarized as follows: 1. A technique has been demonstrated for identifying the positive and negative [0 0 0 1] directions of ZnO directly from HRTEM images with electron beam along [ 2 1 \u00af 1 \u00af 0 ] . This provides a lot of convenience for the identification of polar surfaces. 2. For the ( 0 1 1 \u00af 0 ) non-polar surface, surface reconstruction has been observed. The Zn ions in the first and second layers have an inward (\u223c\u221213% of d ( 01 1 \u00af 0 ) ) and outward (\u223c17% of d ( 01 1 \u00af 0 ) ) relaxation, respectively. The oxygen ions in the first and second surface layer prefer to shift towards vicinal Zn ions to shorten the bonding distance. 3. For the unreconstructed, oxygen-terminated ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) polar surface, the oxygen ions at the top layer have been directly imaged. In the reconstructed ( 0 1 \u00af 1 1 ) surfaces, a \u00d7 2 reconstruction has been identified and its structure model has been proposed. 4. The oxygen-terminated ( 0 0 0 1 \u00af ) polar surface shows no detectable reconstruction. For the Zn-terminated (0 0 0 1) polar surface, our data may possibly indicate the existence of Zn vacancies in the surface and a random outward shift of the Zn ions. 5. Our data tend to support the mechanism of removal of surface atoms for maintaining the stability of (0 0 0 1) polar surfaces. Acknowledgements The authors wish to thank Dr. C.L.

The amount of Pt and Pd used is extremely small, yet they show unusually high activity for electrooxidation of formic acid. The optimized structure has only 2 atomic layers of Pd and a half-monolayer equivalent of Pt (\u03b8Pt \u2248 0.5) but a further increase in the loading of Pd or Pt will actually reduce catalytic activity, inferring that a synergistic effect exists between the three different nanostructure components (sphere, shell and islands). A combined electrochemical, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and density functional theory (DFT) study of formic acid and CO oxidation reveals that our core-shell-cluster trimetallic nanostructure has some unique electronic and morphological properties, and that it could be the first in a new family of nanocatalysts possessing unusually high chemical reactivity. Our results are immediately applicable to the design of catalysts for direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs). \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.",

        "abstract": "Heterostructured metal-semiconductor Zn-ZnO core-shell nanobelts and nanotubes have been synthesized. The core is a belt-shaped Zn single crystal, and the shell is an epitaxially grown ZnO layer of 5n m in thickness. The composite nanobelt grows along (21 h1 h0), its top/bottom being ((0001), and side surfaces ((011 h0). The Zn core is a single crystal, and the ZnO shell has an epitaxial orientation relationship with the core. The metal-based nanobelts have a distinct morphology from the nanowires reported in the literature. A growth mechanism is proposed on the basis of growth kinetics and thermodynamics. Sublimation of the Zn core results in the formation ZnO nanotubes. Since the discovery of oxide semiconducting nanobelts,1 one- dimensional (1-D) facet controlled nanomaterials have attracted much attention due to their potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices in nanoscale.2 The terminology of \"nanowires\" is fairly popular in the literature, but nanowires represent quasi-one-dimensional nanomaterials that grow along a specific axial direction, whereas their side surfaces may not be well-defined. For nanobelts, it should be emphasized that they represent the 1-D nanomaterials that have specific growth direction and well-defined side facets. Analogous to carbon nanotubes, whose properties depend strongly on the helical angle at which the graphitic layer is rolled up, the properties of the nanowires and nanobelts should also depend on the anisotropic structure of their facet surfaces. Therefore, it is a critical step in materials synthesis to control the anisotropic growth of the side surfaces, which may lead to unique properties and selectiv- ity.",

        "abstract": "Although butterfly wings and water strider legs have an anti-wetting property, their working conditions are quite different. Water striders, for example, live in a wet environment and their legs need to support their weight and bear the high pressure during motion. In this work, we have focused on the importance of the surface geometrical structures in determining their performance. We have applied an atomic layer deposition technique to coat the surfaces of both butterfly wings and water strider legs with a uniform 30 nm thick hydrophilic Al(2)O(3) film. By keeping the surface material the same, we have studied the effect of different surface roughness/structure on their hydrophobic property. After the surface coating, the butterfly wings changed to become hydrophilic, while the water strider legs still remained super-hydrophobic. We suggest that the super-hydrophobic property of the water strider is due to the special shape of the long inclining spindly cone-shaped setae at the surface. The roughness in the surface can enhance the natural tendency to be hydrophobic or hydrophilic, while the roughness in the normal direction of the surface is favorable for forming a composite interface.",

For example, Ge/Si core/shell nanowires have exhibited substantially higher performance as field-effect transistors and low-temperature quantum devices compared with homogeneous materials, and nano-roughened Si nanowires were recently shown to have an unusually high thermoelectric figure of merit. Here, we report the first multi-quantum-well (MQW) core/shell nanowire heterostructures based on well-defined III-nitride materials that enable lasing over a broad range of wavelengths at room temperature. Transmission electron microscopy studies show that the triangular GaN nanowire cores enable epitaxial and dislocation-free growth of highly uniform (InGaN/GaN)n quantum wells with n=3, 13 and 26 and InGaN well thicknesses of 1-3 nm. Optical excitation of individual MQW nanowire structures yielded lasing with InGaN quantum-well composition-dependent emission from 365 to 494 nm, and threshold dependent on quantum well number, n. Our work demonstrates a new level of complexity in nanowire structures, which potentially can yield free-standing injection nanolasers.",

        "abstract": "Silicon photonics is now widely accepted as a key technology in a variety of systems. But owing to material limitations, now it is challenging to greatly improve the performance after decades of development. Here, we show a high-performance broadband photodetector with significantly enhanced sensitivity and responsivity operating over a wide wavelength range of lights from near-ultraviolet to near-infrared at low power consumption. The special designed textured top ceiling electrode works effectively as an antireflection layer to greatly improve the absorption of near-infrared light, thereby overcoming the absorption limitation of near-infrared light. Instead of the conventional p-n junction and p-intrinsic-n junction, we introduce a ~15 nm thick alumina insulator layer between a p-type Si substrate and n-type ZnO nanowire (NW) arrays, which are found that the charge carriers separation and collection efficiency have significantly enhanced. The photo-sensing responsivity and sensitivity are found to be nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of a reference device of p-Si/n-ZnO NW arrays, significantly higher than the commercial silicon photodiodes as well. The light-induced charge carriers flow across the appropriate thickness of insulator layer via the quantum mechanical Fowler-Nordheim tunneling mechanism. By virtue of the piezo-phototronic effect, the charge density at the interfaces can be tuned to alter the energy bands and the potential barrier distance for tunneling. Additionally, along with the use of incident light of different wavelengths, the influence of the insulator layer on the transport of electrons and holes separately is further investigated. The demonstrated concepts and study would lead to sensitivity improvement, quality enhancement of data transfer, decrease of power consumption and cost-deduction of silicon photonics.",

        "abstract": "Using a two-step seed-mediated growth method, we synthesized bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) having a gold octahedron core and a palladium epitaxial shell with controlled Pd-shell thickness. The mismatch-release mechanism between the Au core and Pd shell of the NPs was systematically investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. In the NPs coated with a single atomic layer of Pd, the strain between the surface Pd layer and the Au core is released by Shockley partial dislocations (SPDs) accompanied by the formation of stacking faults. For NPs coated with more Pd (>2 nm), the stacking faults still exist, but no SPDs are found. This may be due to the diffusion of Au atoms into the Pd shell layers to eliminate the SPDs. At the same time, a long-range ordered L1(1) AuPd alloy phase has been identified in the interface area, supporting the assumption of the diffusion of Au into Pd to release the interface mismatch. With increasing numbers of Pd shell layers, the shape of the Au-Pd NP changes, step by step, from truncated-octahedral to cubic. After the bimetallic NPs were annealed at 523 K for 10 min, the SPDs at the surface of the NPs coated with a single atomic layer of Pd disappeared due to diffusion of the Au atoms into the surface layer, while the stacking faults and the L1(1) Au-Pd alloyed structure remained. When the annealing temperature was increased to 800 K, electron diffraction patterns and diffraction contrast images revealed that the NPs became a uniform Au-Pd alloy, and most of the stacking faults disappeared as a result of the annealing. Even so, some clues still support the existence of the L1(1) phase, which suggests that the L1(1) phase is a stable, long-range ordered structure in Au-Pd bimetallic NPs.",

        "abstract": "Owing to the compatibility with the traditional integrated circuit technology, it is of great significance to enhance the photoresponse performance of Silicon (Si)-based photodetectors (PDs) in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength. Here, by introducing the piezo-phototronic effect, the photoresponsivity and the specific detectivity of the p-Si/n-CdS heterojunction NIR PD are enhanced by 966 times and two orders of magnitude with a 1064 nm illumination of 0.35 mW cm\u22122 power density under -0.50\u2030 compressive strain, which is even better than those of commercial Si PDs. The piezo-phototronic effect is a three-way coupling effect of piezoelectricity, semiconductor and optical excitation in piezoelectric semiconductors, such as wurtzite structured CdS. Alternatively, the performance enhancement of the n-Si/n-CdS heterojunction PD by the piezo-phototronic effect is much less than that of the p-n heterojunction PD under the same compressive straining conditions, due to their different energy band structures near the Si/CdS heterojunction. This work provides not only a facile solution-processed fabrication for high-performance Si-based NIR PDs, but also a deep understanding about the piezo-phototronic effect on the performance enhancement of Si/CdS heterojunction NIR PDs.",

The nanoring appeared to be initiated by circular folding of a nanobelt, caused by long-range electrostatic interaction. Coaxial and uniradial loop-by-loop winding of the nanobelt formed a complete ring. Short-range chemical bonding among the loops resulted in a single-crystal structure. The self-coiling is likely to be driven by minimizing the energy contributed by polar charges, surface area, and elastic deformation. Zinc oxide nanorings formed by self-coiling of nanobelts may be useful for investigating polar surface\u2013induced growth processes, fundamental physics phenomena, and nanoscale devices.",

        "abstract": "Vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) is a well-established process in catalyst-guided growth of nanowires. The catalyst particle is generally believed to be in liquid state during growth, and it is the site for adsorbing incoming molecules; the crystalline structure of the catalyst may not have any influence on the structure of the grown one-dimensional nanostructures. In this paper, using tin particle guided growth of ZnO nanostructures as a model system, we show that the interfacial region of the tin particle with the ZnO nanowire/nanobelt could be ordered (or partially crystalline) during the VLS growth, although the local growth temperature is much higher than the melting point of tin, and the crystallographic lattice structure at the interface is important in defining the structural characteristics of the grown nanowires and nanobelts. The interface prefers to take the least lattice mismatch; thus, the crystalline orientation of the tin particle may determine the growth direction and the side surfaces of the nanowires and nanobelts. This result may have important impact on the understanding of the physical chemical process in the VLS growth.",

In this paper, we report a systematic study of the vapor deposition kinetics of ZnO nanomaterials under controlled atmosphere and properly refined deposition conditions. The experiments clearly evidenced the self-catalyzed growth of ZnO NWs via the formation of ZnO nanoflowers. This result illustrated how ZnO morphologies were associated with the discrepancy between oxidation rate and condensation rate of Zn. The capability of switching the NW morphologies and possibly mechanisms was demonstrated by kinetically controlling the deposition system. The high Zn composition during the deposition resulted in strongly luminescent NWs, which can be used for optical imaging applications. This research discovered a fundamental kinetics that governs the mechanisms and morphology selection of nanostructures in a non-catalyst growth system.",

        "abstract": "Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a powerful spectroscopy technique that can provide non-destructive and ultra-sensitive characterization down to single molecular level, comparable to single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. However, generally substrates based on metals such as Ag, Au and Cu, either with roughened surfaces or in the form of nanoparticles, are required to realise a substantial SERS effect, and this has severely limited the breadth of practical applications of SERS. A number of approaches have extended the technique to non-traditional substrates14, 16, 17, most notably tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS)18, 19, 20 where the probed substance (molecule or material surface) can be on a generic substrate and where a nanoscale gold tip above the substrate acts as the Raman signal amplifier. The drawback is that the total Raman scattering signal from the tip area is rather weak, thus limiting TERS studies to molecules with large Raman cross-sections. Here, we report an approach, which we name shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, in which the Raman signal amplification is provided by gold nanoparticles with an ultrathin silica or alumina shell. A monolayer of such nanoparticles is spread as \u2018smart dust\u2019 over the surface that is to be probed. The ultrathin coating keeps the nanoparticles from agglomerating, separates them from direct contact with the probed material and allows the nanoparticles to conform to different contours of substrates. High-quality Raman spectra were obtained on various molecules adsorbed at Pt and Au single-crystal surfaces and from Si surfaces with hydrogen monolayers. These measurements and our studies on yeast cells and citrus fruits with pesticide residues illustrate that our method significantly expands the flexibility of SERS for useful applications in the materials and life sciences, as well as for the inspection of food safety, drugs, explosives and environment pollutants.",

        "abstract": "Ceria nanoparticles are one of the key abrasive materials for chemical-mechanical planarization of advanced integrated circuits. However, ceria nanoparticles synthesized by existing techniques are irregularly faceted, and they scratch the silicon wafers and increase defect concentrations. We developed an approach for large-scale synthesis of single-crystal ceria nanospheres that can reduce the polishing defects by 80% and increase the silica removal rate by 50%, facilitating precise and reliable mass-manufacturing of chips for nanoelectronics. We doped the ceria system with titanium, using flame temperatures that facilitate crystallization of the ceria yet retain the titania in a molten state. In conjunction with molecular dynamics simulation, we show that under these conditions, the inner ceria core evolves in a single-crystal spherical shape without faceting, because throughout the crystallization it is completely encapsulated by a molten 1- to 2-nanometer shell of titania that, in liquid state, minimizes the surface energy. The principle demonstrated here could be applied to other oxide systems.",

The texture of the film can be set either in c -axis or a -axis direction, thereby achieving polar or nonpolar film surfaces as desired. The GaN film and Si substrate were found to be separated by a thin amorphous interface layer consisting of Si, Ga, and O atoms, that can enhance the bonding between GaN and Si. This study shows the possibility of depositing GaN films on Si wafers at low cost and the potential of integrating Si based electronics with GaN based optoelectronics.",

The presence of spherical gold catalyst particles at the tips of the nanostructures indicates selective growth via the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. Through a series of experiments, we have produced a primitive \"phase diagram\" for growing these structures based on several designed pressure and temperature parameters. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis has shown that the rods, wires, and belts are single-crystalline and grow along <111>m or <110>h directions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements confirm phase and structural analysis. Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements show that the iron oxide structures exhibit interesting magnetic behavior, particularly at room temperature. This work is the first known report of magnetite 1D nanostructure growth via the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism without using a template, as well as the first known synthesis of long epsilon-Fe2O3 nanobelts and nanowires.",

This Letter investigates the conditions under which the formed phase can be controlled between zinc blende and wurtzite in nanomaterials synthesis. The formation of pure zinc blende structured ZnS nanobelts is related not only to the lower deposition temperature (680\u2013750 \u00b0C), but also to the size of the Au catalyst particle (<50 nm). Pure wurtzite structured ZnS nanobelts are synthesized in a relatively high deposition temperature (>750 \u00b0C) disregard the size of the Au catalyst particles.",

The average of piezoelectric output voltage was about -20 mV, while 5-10% of the NWs had piezoelectric output voltages exceeding -(0.15-0.35) V.

From structure point of view, a common characteristic of ZnO nanostructures is that they are mostly dislocation-free. However, planar and point defects do frequently exist in such nanostructures. The objective of this paper is to present detailed electron microscopy study about the structures of planar defects, such as stacking faults, twins, inversion domain walls that existed in 1D ZnO nanostructures. These planar defects are important for understanding the growth mechanism and relevant physical and possibly chemical properties of 1D ZnO nanostructures.",

The results reveal that the formation of amorphous nuclear/surfactant complex and the electrostatic field within the reverse micelles maintain the unidirectional, irreversible fusion of reverse micelles, leading to the growth of nanowires in one direction.

Utilizing strain-induced piezoelectric polarization charges to modulate the energy band structures and thus to tune/control the transport processes of charge carriers is referred to as the piezotronic effect. Distinct from the previous studies of c-axis GaN nanowires, here we systematically study the piezotronic-effect-induced modifications of energy band structures and the corresponding influence on electronic transport properties of a-axis GaN nanobelts. The physical mechanism is carefully illustrated and further confirmed by theoretical simulations via finite element analysis. The spatial distributions of local carrier concentration and the energy band diagrams of a-axis GaN under various straining conditions are calculated. This work provides a thorough understanding of strain-gated transport properties of a-axis...",

Wide-band ternary semiconductors are a great class of materials with potential application in nano/microdevices, because of their continuously tunable physical properties with composition. Here, we first demonstrate the piezo-photronics effect of ternary wurtzite structured nanowires (NWs), opening an innovative materials system. Single-crystal ternary CdSxSe1\u2013x (x = 0.85, 0.60, and 0.38) NWs were synthesized with site-controlled compositions via a chemical vapor deposition process, and high-performance visible photodetectors (PDs) with fast response speed (u003c2 ms), high photosensitivity, high responsivity, and broadened photoresponse region (than CdS NW) were fabricated based on these ternary materials. By introducing an external tensile strain, the performance of PDs is enhanced by 76.7% upon 0.2 mW/cm2 442 nm light illumination for CdS0.85Se0.15 by the piezo-phototronic effect....",

Using this growth system, bulk homojunction films of core\u2013shell ZnO nanowires were synthesized with either n or p-type cores and the oppositely doped shell. Extensive transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization showed that the nanowires remain single crystalline, and the previously reported signs of doping remain intact. The electronic properties of these films were measured, and ultraviolet photodetection was observed. This growth technique could serve as the basis for other optoelectronic devices based on ZnO such as light emitting diodes and photovoltaics.",

        "abstract": "Two of the most important research directions in the prepa- ration of nanocrystals are the growth of non-spherical quan- tum-confined structures and nanocrystal heterostructures. Non-spherical structures provide a means of understanding the effect of dimensionality and structural anisotropy on quan- tum-confined optoelectronic behavior and also introduce new degrees of freedom in engineering nanocrystal-based devices. Semiconductor nanorods have potential technological advan- tages over spherical nanocrystals in applications such as polar- ized light emitters(1) and photovoltaics.(2) Preparation of nano- crystal heterostructures enables new combinations of material properties, such as photonic and magnetic properties, to be achieved. This opens up new possibilities for investigating in- teractions between nanoscale components of different materi- als, and new technological applications based on combinations of material properties not attainable in homogeneous nano- crystals. Colloidal chemistry provides the basis of a modular approach for integrating different materials and, therefore, different functionalities in these nanocrystal heterostructures. Anisotropic growth of semiconductors with the wurtzite crystal structure has been achieved using multiple surfactants, exploiting inherent differences in growth rates between differ- ent crystal directions,(3,4) which are modulated by differences in the affinity of surfactants for the different crystal faces. In other cases, a solution-liquid-solid (SLS) method that employs molten metal particles as seeds for heterogeneous nucleation and growth of semiconductor wires has been used.(5-13) For groups IV, II-VI, and III-V materials, there is a substantial body of knowledge on the growth of anisotropic nanostruc-",

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional 3D tungsten oxide nanowire networks have been demonstrated as a high-surface area material for building ultrasensitive and highly selective gas sensors. Utilizing the 3D hierarchical structure of the networks, high sensitivity has been obtained towards NO2, revealing the capability of the material to detect concentration as low as 50 ppb parts per billion. The distinctive selectivity at different working temperatures is observed for various gases. The results highlight that the nanobelts nanowires technology can be adopted for the development of gas sensors with performances suitable for practical applications. \u00a9 2006 American Institute of Physics. DOI: 10.1063/1.2203932 The performance of a solid-state gas sensor is character- ized by its sensitivity, stability, and selectivity. The working principle relies on modulation of electrical conductivity due to surface oxidation reduction caused by gas exposure. Be- cause only the surface layer is affected by such reactions, the sensitivity is strongly dependent on the surface-to-volume ratio of the material used. This purpose has been pursued by synthesizing layers with a porous morphology to enhance the material surface area. Porosity is enhanced by means of the thick film synthesis approach typically adopted in the gas sensing field. Such high porosity is not easy to achieve by thin film approach. Another approach largely used in the field is the rheotaxial growth and its thermal oxidation RGTO method, which allows synthesizing a porous thin film mono- layer composed of nanosized grains.1,2 As far as grain size is concerned, it has to be kept in the order of or lower than the debye length, which is the depth into the surface that the chemisorption process can effec- tively modify the electrical properties of the metal oxide material.3 Although many studies have been presented about this,4-6 the primary difficulty still remains in preparation of a sensing material with small crystallite size but stable when operated at higher temperatures for a long period of time. The quality and stability of the small grain size determine the stability of the sensor. Semiconductor nanowires, nanobelts, and related nano- structures are unique for sensor applications because of their single-crystalline structure, large surface-to-volume ratio, and high stability.7 Nanowire based sensors have been dem-",

        "abstract": "One-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and 2D single-atomic layer graphene have superior thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties. However, these nanomaterials exhibit poor out-of-plane properties due to the weak van der Waals interaction in the transverse direction between graphitic layers. Recent theoretical studies indicate that rationally designed 3D architectures could have desirable out-of-plane properties while maintaining in-plane properties by growing CNTs and graphene into 3D architectures with a seamless nodal junction. However, the experimental realization of seamlessly-bonded architectures remains a challenge. We developed a strategy of creating 3D graphene-CNT hollow fibers with radially aligned CNTs (RACNTs) seamlessly sheathed by a cylindrical graphene layer through a one-step chemical vapor deposition using an anodized aluminum wire template. By controlling the aluminum wire diameter and anodization time, the length of the RACNTs and diameter of the graphene hollow fiber can be tuned, enabling efficient energy conversion and storage. These fibers, with a controllable surface area, meso-/micropores, and superior electrical properties, are excellent electrode materials for all-solid-state wire-shaped supercapacitors with poly(vinyl alcohol)/H2SO4 as the electrolyte and binder, exhibiting a surface-specific capacitance of 89.4 mF/cm(2) and length-specific capacitance up to 23.9 mF/cm, - one to four times the corresponding record-high capacities reported for other fiber-like supercapacitors. Dye-sensitized solar cells, fabricated using the fiber as a counter electrode, showed a power conversion efficiency of 6.8% and outperformed their counterparts with an expensive Pt wire counter electrode by a factor of 2.5. These novel fiber-shaped graphene-RACNT energy conversion and storage devices are so flexible they can be woven into fabrics as power sources.",

In this study, cubic structure BaGdF5:Tb nanocrystals embedded in an aluminosilicate glass matrix are reported for potential high performance MeV imaging applications. Scintillator samples with systematically varied compositions were prepared by a simple conventional melt-quenching method followed by annealing. Optical, structural and scintillation properties were characterized to guide the design and optimization of selected material systems, aiming at the development of a system with higher crystal volume and larger crystal size for improved luminosity. It is observed that enhanced scintillation performance was achieved by tuning the glass matrix composition and using GdF3 in the raw materials, which served as a nucleation agent. A 26% improvement in light output was observed from a BaGdF5:Tb glass ceramic with addition of GdF3.",

In this work, an efficient CaF2:Eu glass ceramic neutron scintillator was prepared by forming CaF2:Eu nanocrystals in a 6Li-containing glass matrix. Through appropriate thermal treatments, the scintillation light yield of the transparent glass ceramic was increased by a factor of at least 46 compared to the as-cast amorphous glass. This improvement was attributed to more efficient energy transfer from the CaF2 crystals to the Eu2+ emitting centers. Further light yield improvement is expected if the refractive index of the glass matrix can be matched to the CaF2 crystal.",

        "abstract": "The structures and band structures of Sn doped ZnO were investigated by density functional theory (DFT). Sn-doped ZnO quantum dots were also synthesized via an ultrasonic sol\u2013gel method. The charge of Sn ions was also taken into consideration and Sn2+ and Sn4+ were employed. UV-Vis absorption spectra and photoluminescence excitation spectra were used to elucidate the band gap of Sn-doped ZnO QDs. Photoluminescence spectra were employed to study the change in the defects of Sn-doped ZnO QDs. Sn doping reduced the symmetry of the ZnO cell and stretched the cell. Furthermore, it also could change ZnO from a direct gap semiconductor to an indirect gap semiconductor. The experimental results and DFT calculations matched quite well. Both the DFT calculations and experimental results showed that with an increasing Sn content, the band gap of Sn-doped ZnO first decreased and then increased, whereas the band gap of the ZnO base only increased. Sn doping also changed the optical defects of the quantum dots from  defects to OZn and Oi defects.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Rechargeable Zn-based batteries are a safe alternative to Li-ion for compatibility with aqueous electrolyte. Also, theoretical volumetric energy density of Zn-based batteries (e.g. Zn-air) is ~85% of lithium-sulfur battery. However, the rechargeability and specific capacity of Zn anodes are limited by passivation and dissolution. Here we report a ZnO@TiN x O y  core/shell nanorod structure for deeply rechargeable Zn anodes. The small diameter ( x O y  coating mitigates Zn dissolution in alkaline electrolyte, mechanically maintains the nanostructure, and delivers electron to nanorods. As a result, the ZnO@TiN x O y  core/shell nanorod anode achieves superior specific capacity and cycle life compared with bulk Zn foil and uncoated ZnO nanorod anodes. The discharge capacity of this anode is twice as large as that of the uncoated ZnO nanorod anode. Remarkably, our ZnO@TiN x O y  nanorod anode achieves a much higher specific discharge capacity of 508 mA\u00a0h/g(Zn) than that of many previously reported zinc anodes. It can deeply cycle u003e640 times (64 days) in a beaker cell and deliver excellent long-term electrochemical performance (more than 7500 cycles) when cycled under start-stop conditions. The nanoscale design principles reported here is an important step towards practical deeply rechargeable Zn anodes, and can potentially be applied to overcome intrinsic limitations of other battery materials that involve soluble intermediates or insulating discharge products.",

Herein, a general amphiphilic star-like block copolymer nanoreactor strategy for in situ crafting a set of hairy perovskite QDs with precisely tunable size and exceptionally high water and colloidal stabilities is presented. The selective partition of precursors within the compartment occupied by inner hydrophilic blocks of star-like diblock copolymers imparts in situ formation of robust hairy perovskite QDs permanently ligated by outer hydrophobic blocks via coprecipitation in nonpolar solvent. These size- and composition-tunable perovskite QDs reveal impressive water and colloidal stabilities as the surface of QDs is intimately and permanently ligated by a layer of outer hydrophobic polymer hairs. More intriguingly, the readily alterable length of outer hydrophobic polymers renders the remarkable control over the stability enhancement of hairy perovskite QDs.",

        "abstract": "Hollow nanofibers of PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+\u03b4 (PBSC), created by an electrospinning process, are assembled into a three dimensional (3D) fibrous porous electrode, providing facile pathways for gas transport and excellent electrical conductivity for efficient charge transfer and, thus, greatly enhancing the rate of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), as confirmed by the small electrode polarization resistance and low activation energy. A simple geometric modeling suggests that an electrode with longer fibers tends to be more efficient in facilitating mass and charge transfer under the conditions studied. A solid oxide fuel cell based on this 3D fibrous cathode demonstrates a peak power density of 1.11 W cm\u22122 at 550 \u00b0C when humidified H2 was used as fuel and ambient air as oxidant. The fibrous architecture also shows excellent stability under the operating conditions. Further and in particular, the high-performance hollow-fiber electrodes are also applicable to other energy storage and conversion systems.",

        "abstract": "In this report, a series of diamine/traimine molecules were selected to make different functionalized graphene networks using a facile two-step hydrothermal method. The molecular level grafting of amines to graphene surface via covalent bonds was confirmed by FTIR and XPS. XRD patterns revealed that these amine molecules served as molecular spacers to enlarge the interlayer spacing and the specific surface area. Upon functionalization, the interlayer spacing values varied from 0.84 to 1.23 nm, and the spacing was found to change negligibly after the GO reduction, implying the high stability of the 3D graphene nanostructure. The influence of chain conformation and degree of functionalization on molecular spacing was also discussed. The as-fabricated graphene composite exhibited an improved capacitance in aqueous and organic electrolytes with less than 10% capacitance decay during 10,000 charge/discharge cycles and fast ionic diffusion features. The composite also delivered a maximum capacitance of 119 F/g in ionic liquid electrolyte with an ultrahigh energy density of 51 Wh/kg and slow self-discharge rate. Furthermore, computational study was performed to model the electron distribution and band gap structures of graphene networks. The use of aliphatic amine spacers could better elucidate the correlation between spacing effect and electrical double-layer capacitance.",

Here we report our findings in unraveling the mechanism of Cr poisoning of La.6Sr.4Co.2Fe.8O3 (LSCF) cathodes using our unique in situ/operando surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Further, we present an effective strategy to enhancing the tolerance to contaminants poisoning of LSCF cathode through infiltration of a hybrid catalyst coating, which is composed of a conformal film of perovskite PrNi.5Mn.5O3 (PNM) and exsoluted PrOx nano-particles. The coating is catalytically active to oxygen reduction reaction but inert to contaminant poisoning. When subjected to an accelerated Cr-poisoning test, the cells with a hybrid catalyst-coated LSCF cathode show excellent peak power density (Pmax of 0.71 Wcm\u22122) and significantly enhanced durability (degradation rate of 0.0434% h\u22121 at 0.7\u202fV), much better than those of cells with a bare LSCF cathode (Pmax of ~0.46 Wcm\u22122 and degradation rate of 0.4% h\u22121 at 0.7\u202fV). The results suggest that surface modification of electrodes with a coating of rationally designed catalysts is a cost-effective approach to dramatically reducing electrode degradation caused by contaminations.",

        "abstract": "Owing to the excellent mixed-ionic and electronic conductivity and fast oxygen kinetics at reduced temperature (<800\u202f\u00b0C), double-perovskite oxides such as PrBaCoO exhibit excellent properties as an oxygen electrode for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we revealed high-density antiphase domain boundaries (APBs) and 90\u00b0 domain walls in PrBaCoO grains. Besides the regular lamellar 90\u00b0 domain walls in {021} planes, irregular fine 90\u00b0 domains are attached to the curved APBs. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) reveals the composition variation across some of the 90\u00b0 domain walls. There are fewer Co and more Ba ions approaching the 90\u00b0 domain walls, while the changes in Pr and O ions are not detectable. We assume that the extra Ba cations replace the Pr cations, while the Pr cations go to the Co site to form Pr antisite point defects and become Pr. In this case, the Pr cations will help to balance the local charges and have compatible ionic radius with that of Co. The local strain field around the 90\u00b0 domain walls play a crucial role in the stabilization of such Pr antisite point defects. The antisite point defects have been observed in our high-resolution TEM images and aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning TEM images. After Ca doped into PrBaCoO to improve the structure stability, we observed tweed structures in the PrBaCaCoO grain. The tweed structure is composed of high-density intersected needle-shaped 90\u00b0 domain walls, which is linked to a strong local strain field and composition variation. Even when the temperature is increased to 750\u202f\u00b0C, the domain structures are still stable as revealed by our in situ TEM investigation. Therefore, the influence of the domain structures and the Pr antisite defects on the ionic and electric conductivities must be considered.",

Here, we report our findings in investigating into the redox processes of undoped and Sm-doped CeO2 ceramics stimulated by high-energy electron beam irradiation within a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The reduced structure with oxygen vacancy ordering has been identified as the CeO1.68 (C-Ce2O3+\u03b4) phase via high-resolution TEM. The reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ has been monitored by electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The decreased electronic conductivity of the Sm-doped CeO2 (Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9, SDC) is revealed by electron holography, as positive electrostatic charges accumulated at the surfaces of SDC grains under electron beam irradiation, but not at CeO2 grains. The formation of the reduced CeO1.68 domains corresponds to lattice expansion compared to the CeO2 matrix. Therefore, the growth of CeO1.68 nuclei builds up strain inside the matrix, causing annihilation of ...",

However, the commercialization of hybrid supercapacitors is still hampered by lacking of proper electrode materials of desired nanostructures. Here we report a class of nanocomposite electrodes composed of Co x Ni 1-x (OH) 2  and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), derived from a facile process at room temperature using hydrous hydrazine and proper ratios of Co(II) to Ni(II) to tune the composition and morphology. In particular, an architectural composite electrode consisting of porous Co x Ni 1-x (OH) 2  disks wrapped by rGO achieves large capacity, high rate capability (743 and 545\u00a0C\u00a0g -1  at 1 and 20\u00a0A\u00a0g -1 , respectively), and long cycling life.

Here we report our findings in dramatically enhancing the ORR kinetics and durability of the state-of-the-art La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) cathode using a hybrid catalyst coating composed of a conformal PrNi0.5Mn0.5O3 (PNM) thin film with exsoluted PrOx nanoparticles. At 750 \u00b0C, the hybrid catalyst-coated LSCF cathode shows a polarization resistance of \u223c0.022 \u03a9 cm2, about 1/6 of that for a bare LSCF cathode (\u223c0.134 \u03a9 cm2). Further, anode-supported cells with the hybrid catalyst-coated LSCF cathode demonstrate remarkable peak power densities (\u223c1.21 W cm\u22122) while maintaining excellent durability (0.7 V for \u223c500 h). Near Ambient X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Near Edge X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) analyses, together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, indicate that the oxygen-vacancy-rich surfaces of the PrOx nanoparticles greatly accelerate the rate of electron transfer in the ORR whereas the thin PNM film facilitates rapid oxide-ion transport while drastically enhancing the surface stability of the LSCF electrode.",

        "abstract": "Summary  This work demonstrates that a multi-phase catalyst coating (\u223c30\u00a0nm thick), composed of BaCoO 3\u2212x  (BCO) and PrCoO 3\u2212x  (PCO) nanoparticles (NPs) and a conformal PrBa 0.8 Ca 0.2 Co 2 O 5+\u03b4  (PBCC) thin film, has dramatically enhanced the rate of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). When applied to a state-of-the-art La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3  (LSCF) cathode in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), the catalyst coating reduced the cathodic polarization resistance from 2.57 to 0.312\u00a0\u03a9 cm 2  at 600\u00b0C. Oxygen molecules adsorb and dissociate rapidly on the NPs due to enriched surface oxygen vacancies and then quickly transport through the PBCC film, as confirmed by density functional theory-based computations. The synergistic combination of the distinctive properties of the two separate phases dramatically enhances the ORR kinetics, which is attractive not only for intermediate-temperature SOFCs but also for other types of energy conversion and storage systems, including electrolysis cells and membrane reactors for synthesis of clean fuels.",

Here we report a double perovskite PrBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O5+\u03b4 (PBCC) cathode with excellent ORR activity and remarkable CO2 tolerance under realistic operation conditions. When tested in a symmetrical cell in air with \u223c1 vol% CO2 at 750 \u00b0C, the PBCC electrode shows an area specific resistance of \u223c0.024 \u03a9 cm2, which increases to 0.028 \u03a9 cm2 after 1000 h operation. The degradation rate is \u223c1/24 of that of the state-of-the-art La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) cathode under the same conditions. Impedance spectroscopy and in situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy analyses indicate that the surface of the PBCC electrode is much more active for oxygen exchange and more robust against CO2 than that of LSCF, as confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The fast ORR kinetics and excellent durability of PBCC in air with CO2 highlight the potential of PBCC as a highly promising material for devices involving oxygen electrochemistry such as solid oxide fuel cells, electrolysis cells, or gas separation membranes.",

When tested as a catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an La0.6Sr0.4Co0.6Fe0.4O3\u2013\u03b4 (LSCF6464) nanofiber catalyst (with a specific surface area of 24.2 m2 g\u22121) exhibits a potential (vs Ag/AgCl) of 647 mV at 10 mA cm\u22122disk, which is much smaller than that of a powder-type commercial LSCF (786 mV) and also smaller than that of the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalysts (660 mV). The LSCF6464 nanofiber catalyst further delivers an outstanding durability, with almost no observable change in potential at a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122disk for more than 3 h. In contrast, the performance of an IrO2 catalyst degrades continuously under the same testing conditions. The findings suggest that the LSCF nanofiber is a promising OER electrocatalyst for metal\u2013air batteries and water electrolysis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Owing to the excellent mixed-ionic and electronic conductivity and fast oxygen kinetics at reduced temperature (  \u00b0C), double-perovskite oxides such as PrBaCo 2 O 5+\u03b4  exhibit excellent properties as an oxygen electrode for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we revealed high-density antiphase domain boundaries (APBs) and 90\u00b0 domain walls in PrBaCo 2 O 5+\u03b4  grains. Besides the regular lamellar 90\u00b0 domain walls in {021} planes, irregular fine 90\u00b0 domains are attached to the curved APBs. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) reveals the composition variation across some of the 90\u00b0 domain walls. There are fewer Co and more Ba ions approaching the 90\u00b0 domain walls, while the changes in Pr and O ions are not detectable. We assume that the extra Ba 2+  cations replace the Pr 3+  cations, while the Pr 3+  cations go to the Co site to form Pr Co  antisite point defects and become Pr 4+ . In this case, the Pr 4+  cations will help to balance the local charges and have compatible ionic radius with that of Co 3+ . The local strain field around the 90\u00b0 domain walls play a crucial role in the stabilization of such Pr Co  antisite point defects. The antisite point defects have been observed in our high-resolution TEM images and aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning TEM images. After Ca 2+  doped into PrBaCo 2 O 5+\u03b4  to improve the structure stability, we observed tweed structures in the PrBa 0.8 Ca 0.2 Co 2 O 5+\u03b4  grain. The tweed structure is composed of high-density intersected needle-shaped 90\u00b0 domain walls, which is linked to a strong local strain field and composition variation. Even when the temperature is increased to 750  \u00b0C, the domain structures are still stable as revealed by our  in situ  TEM investigation. Therefore, the influence of the domain structures and the Pr Co  antisite defects on the ionic and electric conductivities must be considered.",

        "abstract": "Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are potentially the most efficient technology for direct conversion of hydrocarbons to electricity. While their commercial viability is greatest at operating temperatures of 300\u2013500\u2009\u00b0C, it is extremely difficult to run SOFCs on methane at these temperatures, where oxygen reduction and C\u2013H activation are notoriously sluggish. Here we report a robust SOFC that enabled direct utilization of nearly dry methane (with ~3.5% H2O) at 500\u2009\u00b0C (achieving a peak power density of 0.37\u2009W\u2009cm\u22122) with no evidence of coking after ~550\u2009h operation. The cell consists of a PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+\u03b4 nanofibre-based cathode and a BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3\u2013\u03b4-based multifunctional anode coated with Ce0.90Ni0.05Ru0.05O2 (CNR) catalyst for reforming of CH4 to H2 and CO. The high activity and coking resistance of the CNR is attributed to a synergistic effect of cationic Ni and Ru sites anchored on the CNR surface, as confirmed by in situ/operando experiments and computations.",

In this work, a diffusion-controlled metal-assisted chemical etching method is developed to fabricate Si zigzag NWs. By tailoring the composition of etchant to change its diffusivity, etching direction, and etching time, various zigzag NWs can be easily fabricated. In addition, it is also found that a critical length of NW (u003e1 \u03bcm) is needed to form zigzag nanowires. Also, the amplitude of zigzag increases as the location approaches the center of the substrate and the length of zigzag nanowire increases. It is also demonstrated that such zigzag NWs can help the silicon substrate for self-cleaning and antireflection. This method may provide a feasible and economical way to fabricate zigzag NWs and novel structures for broad applications.",

However, due to earth-scarcity and high cost of noble metals, finding replacements presents a great economic benefit. Besides, high temperature and harsh environment sensor applications demand material stability under conditions approaching thermal and chemical stability limits of noble metals. In this study, we employed thermally stable perovskite-type La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 (LSFO) nanoparticle surface decoration on Ga2O3 nanorod array gas sensors and discovered an order of magnitude enhanced sensitivity to carbon monoxide at 500 \u00b0C. The LSFO nanoparticle catalysts was of comparable performance to that achieved by Pt nanoparticles, with a much lower weight loading than Pt. Detailed electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies suggested the LSFO nanoparticle sensitization effect is attributed to a spillover-like effect associated with the gas-LSFO-Ga2O3 triple-...",

        "abstract": "Supported metal catalysts are one of the major classes of heterogeneous catalysts, which demand good stability in both the supports and catalysts. Herein, layered protonated titanate derived TiO2 (LPT-TiO2) nanowire arrays were synthesized to support platinum catalysts using different loading processes. The Pt ion-exchange loading on pristine LPTs followed by thermal annealing resulted in superior Pt catalysts supported on the LPT-TiO2 nanoarrays with excellent hydrothermal stability and catalytic performance toward CO and NO oxidations as compared to the Pt catalysts through wet-impregnation on the anatase TiO2 (ANT-TiO2) nanoarrays resulted from thermal annealing of LPT nanoarrays. Both loading processes resulted in highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles (NPs) with average sizes smaller than 1 nm at their pristine states. However, after hydrothermal aging at 800\u00b0C for 50 h, highly dispersed Pt NPs were only retained on the ion exchanged LPT-TiO2 nanoarrays with the support structure consisting of a mixture of 74% anatase and 26% rutile TiO2. For the wet-impregnation loading directly on anatase TiO2 nanoarrays derived from LPT, the Pt catalysts experienced severe agglomeration after hydrothermal aging, with the nanoarray supports consisting of 86% anatase and 14% rutile TiO2. Spectroscopy analysis suggested that Pt2+ cations intercalated into the interlayers of the titanate frameworks through ion-exchange impregnation procedure, which altered the chemical and electronic structures of the catalysts, resulting in the shifts of the electronic binding energy, Raman bands and optical energy bandgap. The ion-exchangeable nature of LPT nanoarrays clearly provides a structural modification in Pt doped LPT that has resulted in a strong interaction between the Pt catalysts and LPT-TiO2 nanoarray supports, leading to the enhanced hydrothermal stability of the catalysts. Considering the wide applications of the LPT and TiO\u00ac2 nanomaterials as supports for catalysts, this finding provides a new pathway to design highly stable supported metal catalysts for different reactions.",

        "abstract": "Explosive shock compaction was used to consolidate powders obtained from melt-spun Pr2Fe14B/-Fe nanocomposite ribbons, to produce fully dense cylindrical compacts of 17-41-mm diameter and 120-mm length. Characterization of the compacts revealed refinement of the nanocomposite structure, with approximately 15 nm uniformly sized grains. The compact produced at a shock pressure of approximately 1 GPa maintained a high coercivity, and its remanent magnetization and maximum energy product were measured to be 0.98 T and 142 kJ/m3, respectively. The compact produced at 4-7 GPa showed a decrease in magnetic properties while that made at 12 GPa showed a magnetic softening behavior. However, in both of these cases, a smooth hysteresis loop implying exchange coupling and a coercivity of 533 kA/m were fully recovered after heat treatment. The results illustrate that the explosive compaction followed by post-shock heat treatment can be used to fabricate exchange-coupled nanocomposite bulk magnets with optimized magnetic properties.",

        "abstract": "We predict, from computer modeling and simulation in partnership with experiment, a general strategy for synthesizing spherical oxide nanocrystals via crystallization from melt. In particular we \"simulate synthesis\" to generate full atomistic models of undoped and Ti-doped CeO2 nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanoporous framework architectures. Our simulations demonstrate, in quantitative agreement with experiment [Science 2006, 312, 1504], that Ti (dopant) ions change the shape of CeO2 nanocrystals from polyhedral to spherical. We rationalize this morphological change by elucidating, at the atomistic level, the mechanism underpinning its synthesis. In particular, CeO2 nanocrystals can be synthesized via crystallization from melt: as a molten (undoped) CeO2 nanoparticle is cooled, nucleating seeds spontaneously evolve at the surface and express energetically stable {111} facets to minimize the energy. As crystallization proceeds, the {111} facets grow, thus facilitating a polyhedral shape. Conversely, when doped with Ti, a (predominantly) TiO2 shell encapsulates the inner CeO2 core. This shell inhibits the evolution of nucleating seeds at the surface thus rendering it amorphous during cooling. Accordingly, crystallization is forced to proceed via the evolution of a nucleating seed in the bulk CeO2 region of the nanoparticle, and as this seed grows, it remains surrounded by amorphous ions, which \"wrap\" around the core so that the energies for high-index facets are drastically reduced; these amorphous ions adopt a spherical shape to minimize the surface energy. Crystallization emanates radially from the nucleating seed, and because it is encapsulated by an amorphous shell, the crystallization front is not compelled to express energetically favorable surfaces. Accordingly, after the nanoparticle has crystallized it retains this spherical shape. A typical animation showing the crystallization (with atomistic detail) is available as Supporting Information. From this data we predict that spherical oxide nanocrystals can be synthesized via crystallization from melt in general by suppressing nucleating seed evolution at the surface thus forcing the nucleating seed to spontaneously evolve in the bulk. Nanospheres can, similar to zeolitic classifications, constitute Secondary Building Units (SBUs) and can aggregate to form nanorods and nanoporous framework architectures. Here we have attempted to simulate this process to generate models for CeO2 and Ti-doped CeO2 nanorods and framework architectures. In particular, we predict that Ti doping will \"smooth\" the surfaces: hexagonal prism shaped CeO2 nanorods with {111} and {100} surfaces become cylindrical, and framework architectures change from facetted pores and channels with well-defined {111} and {100} surfaces to \"smooth\" pores and channels (expressing both concave and convex curvatures). Such structures are difficult to characterize using, for example, Miller indices; rather we suggest that these new structural materials may be better described using minimal surfaces. \u00a9 2007 American Chemical Society.",

The temperature range was 585 \u00b0C~605 \u00b0C and the strain rate range was 0.01/s~10/s. The results show that flow stress decrease with the increase of deformation temperature and decrease of strain rate. Based on the experimental data of semi-solid 6061, the constitutive equation was established to describe the relationship between the processing parameters and flow stress with the help of regression analysis. Regression results show that the model had high regression precision. The suitable temperature range of this model for 6061 aluminum alloy is 585 \u00b0C~605 \u00b0C, and the strain rate is 0.01/s~10/s.",

The results showed that the flanges occurred during dies closing when Y is 0.83D and B is 0.73D (D is the outer diameter of the tube) or Y is 0.78D and B is 0.78D, respectively. However, the bursting occurred during hydroforming when Y is 0.73D and B is 0.73D or Y is 0.78D and B is 0.68D, respectively. The hydroforming process can be successfully conducted and qualified parts can be obtained with the preform shape when Y is 0.78D and B is 0.73D. The preform shape is the most important factor on hydroforming of a torsion beam with complicated sections, and the defects can be avoided by changing the dimensions and shapes of the preform.",

The results show that flow stress of semi-solid aluminum alloy is decreased with increasing in deformation temperature and it is increased with increasing in strain rate. The deformation temperature and strain rate have the significant effects on the peak stress of 6063 alloy rather than steady flow stress. The natural log-arithm of the sine equation of alloy flow stress and reciprocal of absolute temperature meets linear relationship, and relationship between flow stress and strain rate meets hyperbolic sine equation. On the basis of the experimental data from semi-solid 6063, a constitutive equation was established by means of the multi-variable regression to describe the relation between the processing parameters and flow stress. The model exhibits desirable precision by comparing calculated results with experimental ones.",

        "abstract": "Bilingual deaf education is an emerging concept that has gained widespread attention in deaf education all over the world. The fundamental emphasis of bilingual education is to accommodate the needs of deaf children, for whom sign language should be the first language, with the mainstream language as the second language. In bilingual deaf education, it is also important to cultivate all aspects of deaf children's development, including children's language ability, as well as cognitive and social skills. During the course of the five-year joint Sino-Norwegian SigAm Bilingual Deaf Education Project, the program has exhibited great progress in the development of deaf children, deaf education teachers, and project schools. The following article describes the basic theories and policies used in the implementation of this project. The article also discusses how the project is carried out and evaluated, as well as some achievements and experiences in the last five years. Finally, the article presents some problems that exist in the project's current form, and offers some conclusions and suggestions for further development.",

        "abstract": "An efficient quality-of-service (QoS) method for network-on-chip was proposed to meet the low latency and low jitter transmission requirements of real-time applications in MPSoC (multiprocessing system-on-chip). The method utilizes pre-applying and dynamic scheduling mechanism to appropriately make use of bypass channels in routers. It allocates resources and handles conflicts sensibly according to communication tasks' requirements and priorities. Concretely, the mechanism for low latency transmission service uses flexible bypass and specific virtual channels to forward latency critical messages as soon as possible, while the mechanism for low jitter transmission service employes virtual channel reservation and adaptive routing algorithm to maintain successive transmission and low latency variation of jitter critical messages. Experimental results showed that the average delay of latency-critical messages was reduced by 41% and the average latency difference of burst data was reduced by 39%, compared to the conventional QoS method which only based on priority and specific virtual channel. Thus the proposed method can provide high-quality differentiated service for QoC applications.",

        "abstract": "The pervasion of 3-D technologies over the years gives rise to the increasing demands of accurate and efficient stereoscopic image quality assessment (SIQA) methods, designed to automatically supervise and optimize 3-D image and video processing systems. Though 2-D IQA has attracted considerable attention, its 3-D counterpart is yet to be well explored. In this paper, a no-reference SIQA method using convolution neural network (CNN) for feature extraction is proposed. In the proposed method, a CNN model is trained from scratch to classify images according to their perceptual quality, with quality-aware monocular features extracted from a higher level layer of the network. Then, visual saliency models are utilized to fuse the captured monocular features. In the meanwhile, multi-scale statistical features are derived from the binocular disparity maps. Finally, the fused CNN features and the disparity features are synthesized by support vector regression into the objective quality score of the stereoscopic image. Experimental results on two public databases demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art methods, in terms of its accuracy in predicting stereoscopic image quality as well as its robustness across different databases and distortion types.",

However, the study on SIQA remains immature due to the complexity of the human visual system (HVS) and binocular effects that binocular vision brings about. To overcome the difficulties, a novel method is proposed that extracts and quantifies image quality-aware features related to cortex areas in charge of visual quality perception, rather than attempting to rigorously simulate the biological processing in HVS, so that the predicting accuracy is preserved while the computational complexity remains moderate. Meanwhile, binocular effects including binocular rivalry and visual discomfort are taken into consideration. Moreover, the proposed method can be operated completely without the assistance of reference images, indicating its wide practical usages.

The results show that the optical quality of the MQWs improves significantly after RTA. With increasing RTA temperature, PL peak energy of the MQWs redshifts below 1023\u202fK, while it blueshifts above 1023\u202fK. Two competitive processes which occur simultaneously during RTA result in redshift at low temperature and blueshift at high temperature. It is also found that PL peak energy shift can be explained neither by nitrogen diffusion out of quantum wells nor by nitrogen reorganization inside quantum wells. PL peak energy shift can be quantitatively explained by a modified recombination coupling model in which redshift nonradiative recombination and blueshift nonradiative recombination coexist. The results obtained have significant implication on the growth and RTA of GaNAs material for high performance optoelectronic device application.",

In this paper, a four-stage perceptual approach for full reference IQA is presented. In the first stage, the visual features are extracted by 2-D Gabor filter that has the excellent performance of modeling the receptive fields of simple cells in the primary visual cortex. Then in the second stage, the extracted features are post-processed by the divisive normalization transform to reflect the nonlinear mechanisms in human visual systems. In the third stage, mutual information between the visual features of the reference and distorted images is employed to measure the visual quality. And in the last pooling stage, the mutual information is converted to the final objective quality score. Experimental results show that the proposed metic has a high correlation with the subjective assessment and outperforms other state-of-the-art metrics.",

        "abstract": "Serving as quality monitor and evaluator, image quality assessment (IQA) plays an important role in various image processing systems. With humans on the receiving end of these systems, it is evident that desirable IQA methods should correlate well with subjective sensations. Yet traditional methods are usually either inaccurate for lack of consideration on human visual system (HVS) or too complex due to excessive effort on HVS simulation. To the pursuit of both accuracy and efficiency, we propose a method based on the exploitation of features closely related to image inherent quality. Specifically, in the novel method, Sobel operator, log Gabor filter and local pattern analysis are employed for complementary representation of image quality to make use of the properties of the primary and secondary visual cortex in HVS. Finally, support vector regression is implemented for the synthesis of the multiple distortion indices and mapping the quantification into an objective quality score. Experiments conducted on four large-scale databases, i.e. LIVE, TID2008, TID2013, and CSIQ prove that the objective evaluation of image quality by our method is highly consistent with subjective perception, and it is robust across different databases and distortion types. A full reference image quality assessment method is proposed.Multiple features that human visual system is interested in are captured.Feature synthesis are operated with the help of support vector machine.The method shows good and consistent performance comparatively.",

However, their utilization in stereoscopic image quality assessment (SIQA) remains limited. To better simulate how HVS senses 3D images under a no-reference situation, a novel SIQA method based on multiple JND models is proposed in this paper. In our metric, the stereoscopic image pairs are decomposed into multi-scale monocular views and binocular views. Then, texture and edge information of these multi-scale images is extracted. Next, a monocular JND model, a binocular JND model, and a depth JND model are separately applied to the extracted features and the depth map. Finally, these features are synthesized and mapped to objective scores. Through experiment and comparison on public 3D image databases, the proposed method shows a competitive advantage over most state-of-the-art SIQA methods, which indicates that it has a promising prospect in practical applications.",

By assuming that GOS are completely independent, the defect density of GOS is extracted from the layout attributes and yield with PTM as a test vehicle to collect mass of testing data.

In this paper, a novel stereoscopic image quality assessment method is proposed by jointly exploring binocular fusion and rivalry models. In the quality-aware feature extraction stage, multi-scale binocular combination and binocular rivalry energy responses are first generated from reference and distorted stereopairs. In addition, considering that the changes of luminance affect the quality of stereoscopic image greatly, multi-scale visual features relating to image quality are obtained from its luminance maps as another binocular combination and rivalry features. Then, the dissimilarity of quality-aware features between the reference stereopair and its distorted version is quantified. Finally, such dissimilarities are mapped into an objective score to represent the perceptual quality of stereoscopic image through the pooling strategy of support vector regression. Experiments conducted on LIVE 3-D databases demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 96.61% and 96.03% in terms of Pearson\u2019s linear correlation coefficient on Database Phase I and Phase II, respectively, outperforming most of the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Image quality assessment (IQA) is desired to evaluate the perceptual quality of an image in a manner consistent with subjective rating. Considering the characteristics of hierarchical visual cortex, a novel full reference IQA method is proposed in this paper. Quality-aware features that human visual system is sensitive to are extracted to describe image quality comprehensively. Concretely, log Gabor filters and local tetra patterns are employed to capture spatial frequency and local texture features, which are attractive to the primary and secondary visual cortex, respectively. Moreover, images are enhanced before feature extraction with the assistance of visual saliency maps since visual attention affects human evaluation of image quality. The similarities between the features extracted from distorted image and corresponding reference images are synthesized and mapped into an objective quality score by support vector regression. Experiments conducted on four public IQA databases show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness; that is, it is highly consistent with subjective evaluation and is robust across different databases.",

        "abstract": "To match human perception, extracting perceptual features effectively plays an important role in image quality assessment. In contrast to most existing methods that use linear transformations or models to represent images, we employ a complex mathematical expression of high dimensionality to reveal the statistical characteristics of the images. Furthermore, by introducing kernel methods to transform the linear problem into a nonlinear one, a full-reference image quality assessment method is proposed based on high-dimensional nonlinear feature extraction. Experiments on the LIVE, TID2008, and CSIQ databases demonstrate that nonlinear features offer competitive performance for image inherent quality representation and the proposed method achieves a promising performance that is consistent with human subjective evaluation.",

However, current quality-Aware feature extraction methods for IQA can hardly balance accuracy and complexity. This paper introduces multi-order local description into image quality assessment for feature extraction. The first-order structure derivative and high-order discriminative information are integrated into local pattern representation to serve as the quality-Aware features. Then joint distributions of the local pattern representation are modeled by spatially enhanced histogram. Finally, the image quality degradation is estimated by quantifying the divergence between such distributions of the reference image and those of the distorted image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-The-Art approaches in consideration of not only accuracy that is consistent with human subjective evaluation, but also robustness and stability across different distortion types and various public databases.

The multi-scale method was used to get the amplitude-frequency response equation and characteristic equation of singular point under the primary resonance of the ship's nonlinear rolling controlled system. The bifurcation characteristics of this nonlinear system were analyzed by singularity theory. Further the control method for restraining or delaying generation of bifurcation movement was proposed, and the influence of different control methods on the ship's rolling movement and stability was analyzed.

Applying the NURBS method, a deep-vee trimaran hull surface model was designed, and corresponding grid division was used to show the transformation process from traditional 2-dimensional drawing lines to 3-dimensional representation of the deep-vee trimaran hull. A Fortran (Formula transformation) program was developed to calculate and analyze the intact stability of the deep-vee trimaran. The research shows that the deep-vee trimaran has better stability performance than the round-bilge trimaran with the same displacement. As the side hull transverse position or displacement increases, the trimaran's stability increased. The result also shows that proper deadrise angle has a certain influence on the deep-vee trimaran's intact stability.",

To address this issue, a method of neighborhood formation, two-phase neighbor selection method (TPNS), is proposed. The definition of neighbor tendency is given. Based on the neighbor tendency, the preliminary neighborhood is formed. Then, the equivalence relation similarity is applied to modify the preliminary neighborhood, which makes the neighborhood formation more accurate. Experimental results on MovieLens dataset show that compared with the existing algorithms, TPNS performs better in the application of personalized recommendation.",

To ensure the complement of decision, first of all, a reasonable method is developed for comparing two values by introducing the geometric meaning of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Then, a normalization method of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy matrix is defined, and some of its desirable properties are investigated in detail. Through this method, not only maintain the form of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, but also can diminish loss of information at large scale. Next, a method based on maximizing entropy values of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers to ensure unknown attribute weights is developed. Finally, apply this method in ERP choosing group decision-making problem, a practical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the developed approach.",

The results showed that the effect of Withering and drying technics on hydrolysates, polyphenols and its oxide of Keemun black tea wasn\u2019t obvious, through analyzing the experimental data of Withering and First drying research showed that available equipments had better suitability to regulation and control of tea processing. Withering way of high wind worked more efficiently, but ydrolysis weaker,the hydrolysates such as pectic substances, freeaminoacid and soluble sugar is slightly lower than others, withering way of low wind worked less inefficient, hydrolysis stronger, withering way of medium wind worked more inefficient, hydrolysis stronger. Enzyme reaction and hyther on slight treatment of first drying degree was stronger and had longer time, the major biochemical components such as soluble sugar, freeaminoacid and polyphenols is slightly lower than others. Medium treatment of first drying degree had higher contents of the major biochemical components, the proportion of theaflavins, thearubigins and Theabrowns was proportional. It was less beneficial to the formation of aroma while first drying degree located on high treatment.",

We prove further that, when the variable kernel \u03a9 satisfies a class of integral Dini condition, \u03bc \u03a9 is a bounded operator from the Hardy space H 1 (\u211d n) to L 1 (\u211d n) and from the weak Hardy space H 1,\u221e (\u211d n) to the weak L 1 space L 1-\u221e(\u211d n), respectively. As corollaries of the above conclusions, we show that \u03bc \u03a9 is also of the weak type (1, 1) and of type (p, p) for 1 < p < 2. Moreover, the L 2 boundedness of a class of the Littlewood-Paley type operators with variable kernels also are obtained, which are related to the Littlewood-Paley g* \u03bb-function and Lusin area integral, respectively.",

If b = 1 , then the pointwise estimates are particularly consistent with the sharp results of the nondegenerate cases. Moreover, as an application of the L p \u2013 L q estimates, we also show that higher-order differential operator i P ( D ) + V ( x , D ) generates a fractionally integrated group on some L p ( R n ) , from which certain L p -estimates for the solutions of generalized Schr\u00f6dinger equations are obtained.",

First we establish the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequalities for T on anisotropic Hardy spaces associated with dilation A, which show that T is bounded from H\n \n p\n  to H\n \n q\n , or from H\n \n p\n  to L\n \n q\n , where 0 p \u2264 1/(1 + \u03b1) and 1/q = 1/p \u2212 \u03b1. Then we give anisotropic Hardy spaces estimates for a class of multilinear operators formed by fractional integrals\n or Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund singular integrals. Finally, we apply the above results to give the boundedness of the commutators of\n T and a BMO function.",

Furthermore, an endpoint homogeneous Strichartz estimates on BMO x (\u211d n ) and a parabolic homogeneous Strichartz estimate are proved. Meanwhile, the Strichartz estimates to the Sobolev spaces and Besov spaces are generalized. Secondly, the local well-posedness and small global well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for the semilinear parabolic equations with elliptic operators of order 2m, which has a potential V (t, x) satisfying appropriate integrable conditions, are established. Finally, the local and global existence and uniqueness of regular solutions in spatial variables for the higher order elliptic Navier-Stokes system with initial data in L  r (\u211d n ) is proved.",

For this purpose, we also show jump and variational inequalities for para-products and commutators from pseudo-differential calculus, which are of independent interest. New ingredients in the proofs involve identifying Carleson measures constructed from sequences of stopping times, in addition to many Littlewood-Paley type estimates with gradient.",

        "abstract": "The ring-opening polymerization of cyclic (aromatic disulfide) oligomers derived from 4,4\u2032-isopropylidene bisthiophenol was studied both in diphenyl ether solution and in the melt. The polymers formed were soluble in solvents such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, DMF, NMP and characterized by n.m.r., g.p.c., d.s.c. and t.g.a. techniques. The ring-opening polymerization began at about 150\u00b0C in solution, but did not begin until around 200\u00b0C in the melt, as determined by the melting point of the cyclic oligomers. A 13 C-n.m.r. study indicated that structurally regular polydisulfides were formed below 250\u00b0C, however, structural irregularity occurred above this temperature. There were no cross-linking reactions observed below 300\u00b0C for short times, although cross-linking was very serious above 300\u00b0C.",

The significantly lower melt visicosity of cyclomers faciliates\n the processing which should be attractive for fabrication of advanced composite structures free of voids and residual stresses.\n Synthesis of block copolymers by ROP is still an unexploited area.

Keywords Molybdotungstophosphoric acids Cyclopentene Hydrogen peroxide PMW/CPB PW 12 /CPB 1 Introduction Epoxidation of alkenes is among the most important reactions in organic synthesis, because epoxide compounds are valuable precursors for the synthesis of drugs, agrochemicals and food additives. Polyoxometalates, as the effective catalysts for epoxidation, have drawn wide attention in the last two decades [1\u201324] . In 1983, Venturello et al. [7\u20139] discovered that the complex consisting of tungstate and phosphate can catalyze the epoxidation of different alkenes with dilute H 2 O 2 solution (15%) as oxidant. In 1988, Ishii and co-workers [10,11] reported that the system composed of H 3 PW 12 O 40 and cetylpyridinium chloride can catalyze epoxidation of alkenes with commercially available H 2 O 2 solution (35%) as oxidant. In recent years, the epoxidation mechanism on these catalysts has been investigated by many groups [12\u201317] . It has been proved that {PO 4 [WO(O 2 ) 2 ] 4 } 3\u2212 is the active species in the olefin epoxidation in the Venturello\u2013Ishii system. Heteropolyacids with the Keggin structure, H 3 PW 12 O 40 , are degraded in the presence of excess H 2 O 2 to form peroxo species {PO 4 [WO(O 2 ) 2 ] 4 } 3\u2212 and [W 2 O 3 (O 2 ) 4 (H 2 O) 2 ] 2\u2212 , which are the true catalytic-active intermediate. When we used H 3 PMo 12\u2212 n W n O 40 combined with cetylpyridinium bromide (abbreviated CPB) as a phase transfer reagent with 50 equiv of H 2 O 2 solution (30%) to catalyze epoxidation of cyclopentene in acetonitrile, we found a new phenomenon. The epoxidation was more efficiently catalyzed by H 3 PMo 6 W 6 O 40 combined with CPB (abbreviated as PMW/CPB system) than by H 3 PW 12 O 40 combined with CPB (abbreviated as PW 12 /CPB system). At first sight, the poor reactivity of the PW 12 /CPB system compared with the PMW/CPB system is difficult to understand. It seems that more active species resulted from H 3 PW 12 O 40 than from H 3 PMo 6 W 6 O 40 . In an attempt to interpret these results, we characterized the fresh catalysts and the catalysts under reaction condition by UV\u2013vis, FT-IR and 31 P NMR spectroscopy. It was found that the Keggin-type H 3 PMo 6 W 6 O 40 is degraded completely in the presence of 50 equiv of H 2 O 2 to form a considerable amount of phosphorus-containing species. Under the same reaction conditions, H 3 PW 12 O 40 is hardly degraded and no {PO 4 [WO(O 2 ) 2 ] 4 } 3\u2212 is detected by 31 P NMR. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of heteropolyacids All solvent and chemicals were analytical grade, commercially available and used without further purification unless otherwise stated. H 3 PW 12 O 40 \u00b7 n H 2 O was prepared according to Ref. [19] . Na 2 WO 4 \u00b72H 2 O (25 g) and Na 2 HPO 4 \u00b712H 2 O (10 g) were added to 40 ml of decationized water, and the mixture was refluxed at 80 \u00b0C with stirring. Then, 24% HCl (37.5 ml) was added to the solution at 80 \u00b0C. After the solution was concentrated to a volume of 25 ml by evaporation at 50 \u00b0C, it was cooled to room temperature. H 3 PW 12 O 40 was extracted with an equal amount of diethyl ether (with slow agitation after the addition of several drops of 37% HCl). Ether was removed at 50 \u00b0C. Then the residual was dissolved in water and concentrated at 50 \u00b0C. Recrystallization from an aqueous solution and drying in a desiccator for 2 d formed H 3 PW 12 O 40 \u00b7 n H 2 O. H 3 PMo 12 O 40 \u00b7 n H 2 O was prepared according to Ref. [20] . MoO 3 of 14.4 g was placed in a 250 ml flask equipped with a reflux condenser, and 140 ml of water was added. To this was then added 0.96 g of 85% H 3 PO 4 , and the solution was boiled for 3 h under vigorous stirring. The green color that developed was removed by the addition of a few drops of bromine water. At the end of the heating period, the yellow solution was cooled and the white insolubles remaining were filtered. The mother liquor was concentrated to a volume of 10 ml by evaporative boiling for 3\u20134 h. Upon cooling, the concentrate mixture was filtered and air-dried. This crude product was purified by dissolving in 10 ml of water, and was allowed the clear yellow solution to crystallize in air. The large yellow crystals formed were filtered and air-dried. H 3 PMo 6 W 6 O 40 \u00b7 n H 2 O was prepared as follows [19] . Na 2 WO 4 \u00b72H 2 O (15.0 g), Na 2 MoO 4 \u00b72H 2 O (11.0 g) and NaH 2 PO 4 \u00b72H 2 O (2.38 g) were dissolved in 66.7 ml of decatioinized water. The solution was kept at 80 \u00b0C for 3 h with agitation and then concentrated to 27 ml by evaporation. Then, 33.3 ml of 24% HCl was added (the solution was yellow). After extraction with ether at room temperature, crystals were obtained. Anal. found: P:Mo:W = 1.1:6:6.6, Calc. for H 3 PMo 6 W 6 O 40 : P:Mo:W = 1:6:6; yield: 57.7%. Other H 3 PMo 12\u2212 n W n O 40 \u00b7 n H 2 O heteropolyacids were similarly prepared. 2.2 Synthesis of peroxo complexes 2.2.1 Preparation of (CTP) 3 {PO 4 [WO(O 2 ) 2 ] 4 } This was based on the method described by Ishii et al. [10] . To a solution of cetylpyridinium chloride (0.55 g, 1.55 mmol) in 35% H 2 O 2 (20 ml) was added H 3 PW 12 O 40 (1.5 g, 0.55 mmol) in 35% H 2 O 2 (5 ml), and the mixture was stirred at 40 \u00b0C for 4.5 h. The suspended mixture was cooled to room temperature until a white precipitate was produced. After centrifugation, the precipitate was washed repeatedly with water and dried in vacuum. IR (KBr): 3431, 2918, 2850, 1708, 1633, 1486, 1468, 1374, 1175, 1132, 1080, 1057, 982, 906, 836, 771, 721, 682, 648, 571, 548, and 525 cm \u22121 . 2.2.2 Preparation of (Bu 4 N) 3 {PO 4 [MoO(O 2 ) 2 ] 4 } This was based on the method described by Aubry [13] . 30% H 2 O 2 (15 ml, 150 mmol) was added to a solution of H 3 PMo 12 O 40 (1.91 g, 1 mmol in 5 ml of water). After a few minutes of stirring, an insoluble fraction was removed by filtration. The clear yellow solution was left to stand for 15 min before an aqueous solution of tetrabutylammonium bromide (0.903 g, 2.8 mmol) was slowly added. The resulting yellow precipitate was filtered out, washed thoroughly with water, and air-dried. IR (KBr): 1071, 1039, 964, 872, 739, 660,590, 543, and520 cm \u22121 . 2.3 Catalytic reactions The catalytic reactions were performed in a 10 ml two-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a septum, a magnetic stirring bar, and a reflux condenser. Typically, cyclopentene (3 mmol) and 0.52 mmol of n -butyl ether as an internal standard were added to an acetonitrile solution (3 ml) of catalyst (0.015 mmol), cetylpyridinium bromide (0.045 mmol) and 30% hydrogen peroxide (0.75 mmol). The flask was then placed in a hot oil bath at 60 \u00b0C and the mixture was stirred vigorously for 3.5 h. The reaction solution was periodically sampled by a syringe and analyzed by a Perkin-Elmer XL gas chromatograph equipped with a 15 m SE-54 capillary column and a FID detector. Assignments of products were made by comparison with authentic samples. Selected samples were also analyzed by GC/MC (Agilent-6890/5973N). 2.4 UV\u2013vis measurement 2.4.1 UV\u2013vis spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-spectrometer Samples without H 2 O 2 added were treated as follows: heteropolyacid (0.015 mmol) and cetylpyridinium bromide (0.045 mmol) (abbreviated as the HPA/CPB system) were dissolved in acetonitrile (3 ml), and the UV spectra of these samples were recorded after 1 h. Samples with H 2 O 2 added were treated as follows: heteropolyacid (0.015 mmol) and cetylpyridinium bromide (0.045 mmol) were dissolved in 3 ml of acetonitrile, and then H 2 O 2 (0.75 mmol) was added with stirring. The UV spectra of these samples were recorded after 1 h. 2.5 FT-IR spectra IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet AVATAR 360 FT-IR spectrometer. The fresh solid catalyst was measured using KBr pellets containing 2.5 mass% samples and prepared by manual grinding using a mortar and pestle. The spectra of solution were recorded as follows: heteropolyacid (0.015 mmol) and cetylpyridinium bromide (0.045 mmol) were dissolved in H 2 O 2 (0.75 mmol). Then a small amount of solution was spreaded on the surface of a standard KBr flake and immediately subjected to FT-IR measurement. 2.6 31 P NMR spectra A 10 ml two-necked round-bottomed flask was charged with heteropolyacid (0.015 mmol), cetylpyridinium bromide (0.045 mmol), N , N -dimethylformamide (3.0 ml), and H 2 O 2 (0.75 mmol). The reaction system was maintained at 60 \u00b0C and stirred vigorously for 3 h. Then the solution sample was taken and immediately analyzed by 31 P NMR. 31 P NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 300 MHz NMR spectrometer, 31 P chemical shifts are referenced to 85% H 3 PO 4 as an external standard, and the times of scan was 380. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization IR ( Table 1 ), UV\u2013vis ( Table 4 ), 31 P NMR, and elemental analysis data of the 13 HPAs were compared with those of authentic samples and related literature data, clearly indicating that they do have the Keggin structure. Comparison of the IR spectra of the two peroxo complexes with the literature data showed that they were the target compounds. 3.2 Optimization of reaction condition The results of epoxidation of cyclopentene catalyzed by H 3 PMo 12\u2212 n W n O 40 combined with CPB with different solvents, temperature, and oxidants are summarized in Tables 2 and 3 . The epoxidation catalyzed by the PMW/CPB system, which was carried out in acetonitrile at 60 \u00b0C with H 2 O 2 or urea\u2013hydrogen peroxide adduct (UHP) as oxidant was the optimum. The PMW/CPB system is more active than the PW 12 /CPB system in the epoxidation of cyclopentene. To clarify the mechanism of these reactions, the fresh catalysts and the catalysts under reaction condition were characterized by UV\u2013vis, FT-IR and 31 P NMR spectroscopies. 3.3 UV\u2013vis absorption spectroscopy A UV\u2013vis study was performed, since most of the heteropolyacids have characteristic spectra in the middle of the ultraviolet range. Table 4 shows the UV spectra data of some H 3 PMo 12\u2212 n W n O 40 heteropolyacids combined with CPB measured under the conditions without and with H 2 O 2 in acetonitrile. Fig. 1 depicts the UV\u2013vis spectra of PW 12 /CPB (a) and PW 12 /CPB treated with an excess of H 2 O 2 ([H 2 O 2 ]/[H 3 PW 12 O 40 ] = 50 mol/mol (b) in acetonitrile. For Fig. 1 a of the fresh catalyst, the absorption bands appeared at 265 and 216 nm, respectively. When 50 equiv of H 2 O 2 was added, the peak at 216 nm shifted to 210 nm. Though the peak at 265 nm still remained, its peak intensity decreased. Comparison between the curves a and b reveals that the structure of H 3 PW 12 O 40 has changed and the degradation happened by the addition of 50 equiv of H 2 O 2 . Fig. 2 depicts the UV\u2013vis spectra of PMW/CPB (a) and PMW/CPB treated with 50 equiv of H 2 O 2 (b) in acetonitrile. When no H 2 O 2 was added, two absorption bands appeared at 225 and 259 nm; the peak intensity of the latter is low. When H 2 O 2 was added, the peak intensity of the 259 nm band increased and shifted to 265 nm. Though the peak at 225 nm changed little in intensity, but it shifted to 214 nm. These changes indicate the Keggin structure of H 3 PMo 6 W 6 O 40 has been lost by the action of H 2 O 2 and to be converted to some new species, which is likely to be the mixture of peroxo anions and undegraded PMo 6 W 6 O 40 3\u2212 . Other H 3 PMo 12\u2212 n W n O 40 ( n = 1\u201311) heteropolyacids showed similar changes in UV absorption bands to H 3 PMo 6 W 6 O 40 when 50 equiv of H 2 O 2 was added, revealing that these H 3 PMo 12\u2212 n W n O 40 are also degraded under the action of hydrogen peroxide. 3.4 FT-IR spectroscopy The FT-IR spectrum of H 3 PMo 6 W 6 O 40 ( Fig. 3 a) exhibits four bands at 790, 877, 972, and 1072 cm \u22121 in the fingerprint region. The strong and broad bands at 1072 and 972 cm \u22121 can be ascribed to the stretching mode of the P O and M O (Mo or W) bands, respectively. The bands at 877 and 790 cm \u22121 can be attributed to the \u03bd (M O b M) (corner-sharing), and \u03bd (M O c M) (edge-sharing) bands, respectively. After the addition of 50 equiv of H 2 O 2 ([H 2 O 2 ]/[H 3 PMo 12\u2212 n W n O 40 ] = 50 mol/mol) to the H 3 PMo 6 W 6 O 40 , obvious changes in the origin FT-IR spectrum were observed ( Fig. 3 b). All the four characteristic bands disappeared and five new bands appeared at 829, 859, 921, 956, and 1063 cm \u22121 . The results show that the Keggin structure of H 3 PMo 6 W 6 O 40 was lost under the action of an excess of H 2 O 2 and new molybdotungstophosphate species were formed. Comparison of the spectrum with that of (CTP) 3 {PO 4 [WO(O 2 ) 2 ] 4 } in Fig. 3 d indicates that the species degraded from H 3 PMo 6 W 6 O 40 is obviously not the peroxide. The FT-IR spectrum of H 3 PW 12 O 40 shows four bands at 809, 890, 984, and 1080 cm \u22121 in the fingerprint region. The strong and broad bands at 1080 and 984 cm \u22121 can be ascribed to the stretching mode of the P O and the W O bands, respectively. The bands at 890 and 809 cm \u22121 can be attributed to the \u03bd (W O b W) (corner-sharing), and \u03bd (W O c W) (edge-sharing) bands, respectively. After the addition of 50 equiv of H 2 O 2 to H 3 PW 12 O 40 , similar changes happened ( Fig. 3 c). All the four characteristic bands disappeared and four new bands appeared at 832, 868, 920, and 1062 cm \u22121 , suggesting that the Keggin structure of H 3 PW 12 O 40 has degraded to form new tungstophosphate species, which is different from (CTP) 3 {PO 4 [WO(O 2 ) 2 ] 4 } as shown by comparison with the spectrum of (CTP) 3 {PO 4 [WO(O 2 ) 2 ] 4 } ( Fig. 3 d). The IR spectra of other H 3 PMo 12\u2212 n W n O 40 heteropolyacids changed when 50 equiv of H 2 O 2 was added, revealing H 3 PMo 12\u2212 n W n O 40 heteropolyacids were degraded to form new molybdotungstophosphate species under the action of hydrogen peroxide. 3.5 31 P NMR spectroscopy The crystal of H 3 PMo 6 W 6 O 40 has the \u03b1-Keggin structure based on a central PO 4 tetrahedron surrounded by 12MO 6 octahedral arranged in four groups of three edge-shared octahedral M 3 O 13 . The groups of M 3 O 13 are linked by sharing corners to each other and to the central PO 4 tetrahedron. Mo and W are crystallographically disordered, each M = 1/2Mo + 1/2W, statistically occupying in the crystal [24] . 31 P NMR spectrum of H 3 PMo 6 W 6 O 40 exhibits a single line at 1.3 ppm ( Fig. 4 a). When the catalyst of H 3 PMo 6 W 6 O 40 combined with cetylpyridinium bromide was treated with 50 equiv of H 2 O 2 in the absence of substrate, three peaks at 8.1, 7.1, 6.1 ppm (see Fig. 4 e) appeared and the peak at 1.3 ppm disappeared. The results show that H 3 PMo 6 W 6 O 40 has degraded to three phosphorus-containing species. The line at 8.1 ppm can be attributed to {PO 4 [MoO(O 2 ) 2 ] 4 } 3\u2212 , the other two lines cannot be assigned at present. The 31 P NMR chemical shift of (Bu 4 N) 3 {PO 4 [MoO(O 2 ) 2 ] 4 } is located at 8.1 ppm ( Fig. 4 b). 31 P NMR spectrum of H 3 PW 12 O 40 shows a single line at \u221214.2 ppm. After 50 equiv of H 2 O 2 was added, a new peak at 0.92 ppm appeared ( Fig. 4 d). The peak intensity of [PW 12 O 40 ] 3\u2212 (\u221214.2 ppm) is much stronger than that of the new peak, implying that most of [PW 12 O 40 ] 3\u2212 is kept and only a small part has degraded. Comparison with the 31 P NMR spectrum of (CTP) 3 {PO 4 [WO(O 2 ) 2 ] 4 }(2.5 ppm) ( Fig. 4 c) revealed that the new peak at 0.92 ppm is not the active species of {PO 4 [WO(O 2 ) 2 ] 4 } 3\u2212 . In the above experiments, the sequence of adding reactants was that H 2 O 2 was added to the mixture of H 3 PW 12 O 40 and CPB. Now the sequence was changed as follows: first H 3 PW 12 O 40 (0.015 mmol) was treated with H 2 O 2 (0.75 mmol), followed by the addition of CPB (0.045 mmol). After 5 min of stirring, DMF (3.0 ml) was added to the mixture, which was stirred for 30 min. Then the solution sample was taken and measured by 31 P NMR. 31 P NMR spectroscopy of thus treated sample exhibits three peaks at \u221214.2, 0.92, and 2.5 ppm (see Fig. 5 ). The signal of {PO 4 [WO(O 2 ) 2 ] 4 } 3\u2212 (2.5 ppm) appears, but the peak intensity of [PW 12 O 40 ] 3\u2212 (\u221214.2 ppm) is still stronger than that of the new peaks. This experiment showed that different experimental procedures lead to different phosphorus-containing species. Under the action of 50 equiv of H 2 O 2 , [PMo 6 W 6 O 40 ] 3\u2212 can be degraded completely to form three new phosphorus-containing species, which may be the catalytic-active species in this reaction system. When H 2 O 2 was added to the mixture of H 3 PW 12 O 40 and CPB, [PW 12 O 40 ] 3\u2212 did not degrade to form the active species of {PO 4 [WO(O 2 ) 2 ] 4 } 3\u2212 . These findings may explain the poor activity of [PW 12 O 40 ] 3\u2212 in the epoxidation of cyclopentene compared with [PMo 6 W 6 O 40 ] 3\u2212 . The 31 P NMR spectra of other H 3 PMo 12\u2212 n W n O 40 heteropolyacids are shown in Fig. 6 . When H 3 PMo 11 W 1 O 40 , H 3 PMo 1 W 11 O 40 , and H 3 PMo 4 W 8 O 40 were treated with 50 equiv of H 2 O 2 , all of them were degraded to several phosphorus-containing species ( Fig. 6 a\u2013c). A common character is that the species with the Keggin structure were still kept, accompanied with the appearance of new phosphorus-containing species. The 31 P NMR spectrum of the treated sample of H 3 PMo 11 W 1 O 40 exhibits three new peaks at 7.1, 4.6, and 2.8 ppm ( Fig. 6 a), H 3 PMo 1 W 11 O 40 exhibits three new peaks at 7.4, 4.2, and 3.6 ppm ( Fig. 6 b), and H 3 PMo 4 W 8 O 40 exhibits three new peaks at 8.1, 5.5, and 4.2 ppm ( Fig. 6 c). In the epoxidation system of H 3 PMo 12\u2212 n W n O 40 ( n = 1\u201311) combined with CPB, PMW/CPB shows the highest activity. The reasons why PMW/CPB has the highest activity may be explained as follows: when PMW/CPB was treated with 50 equiv of H 2 O 2 , three new phosphorus-containing species produced (the chemical shifts are 8.1, 7.1, and 6.1 ppm). Because the activity of PMW/CPB ranks first, these phosphorus-containing species should be the true active species in the epoxidation. Among the new phosphorus-containing species degraded from H 3 PMo 11 W 1 O 40 (the chemical shifts are 7.1, 4.6, and 2.8 ppm), H 3 PMo 1 W 11 O 40 (the chemical shifts are 7.4, 4.2, and 3.6 ppm) and H 3 PMo 4 W 8 O 40 (the chemical shifts are 8.1, 5.5, and 4.2 ppm), only one is identical with the species from H 3 PMo 6 W 6 O 40 . Thus the effective active species degraded from H 3 PMo 11 W 1 O 40 , H 3 PMo 1 W 11 O 40 , and H 3 PMo 4 W 8 O 40 are fewer than that of the PMW/CPB system, leading to the reaction activities of these catalysts inferior to the latter. 3.6 Epoxidation of other olefins The epoxidation of cyclicolefins was carried out in the PMW/CPB and PW 12 /CPB system. All the reactions catalyzed by PMW/CPB system show higher conversion compared with those catalyzed by the PW 12 /CPB system ( Table 5 ). These results further indicate that the species degraded from the PMW/CPB system, whose chemical shifts are 8.1, 7.1, and 6.1 ppm are the true active species under these reaction conditions. The epoxidation of various alkenes including cyclic, chain linear terminal ones and with an electron-withdrawn group were conducted in the PMW/CPB/H 2 O 2 /CH 3 CN catalytic system and the results are listed in Table 6 . Though the conversion of the chain linear terminal alkenes were low compared with cyclic ones, the selectivity for the desired epoxides were high (\u223c90%). 4 Conclusions The epoxidation of cyclopentene with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by 12-heteropolyacids of molybdenum and tungsten (H 3 PMo 12\u2212 n W n O 40 , n = 1\u201311), H 3 PW 12 O 40 and H 3 PMo 12 O 40 combined with cetylpyridinium bromide as a phase transfer reagent was investigated in acetonitrile. The H 3 PMo 6 W 6 O 40 combined with the CPB system shows the highest activity compared with all the 13 catalytic system. The fresh catalysts and the catalysts under reaction condition were characterized by UV\u2013vis, FT-IR and 31 P NMR spectroscopy, and it is found that the catalyst H 3 PMo 6 W 6 O 40 was degraded to three phosphorus-containing species upon the action of 50 equiv of H 2 O 2 , which may be the catalytically active species in these reaction conditions, while most of H 3 PW 12 O 40 still keep the Keggin structure. Only part of H 3 PW 12 O 40 degraded to form a phosphorus-containing species, which is not the {PO 4 [WO(O 2 ) 2 ] 4 } 3\u2212 species known as the active species in the Venturello\u2013Ishii system. Different phosphorus-containing species cause the different activity in epoxidation of cyclopentene. References [1] M.T. Pope A. M\u00fcller Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 30 1991 34 [2] X. Zhang T.M.

By optimizing the reaction conditions, 80% conversion of cyclohexene and 97% selectivity for cyclohexene oxide could be achieved in the UHP/CH 3 CN system. When aqueous 30% hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 , HP) was used, the cyclohexene conversion and cyclohexene epoxide selectivity were inferior to those obtained with the UHP/CH 3 CN system. The reaction of UHP with CWP has been studied by UV-Vis and 31 P NMR spectroscopy, which has revealed that the Keggin-type heteropoly compounds CWP is degraded in the presence of excess UHP to form a considerable amount of phosphorus-containing species.",

By this method, a variety of water-insoluble unactivated alkenes, internal or terminal, open chain or cyclic and isolated, were epoxidised under mild conditions and after relatively short reaction times. The state of the H3PMo3W9O 40/CPB/H2O2/CH3CN system was studied using UV, IR, and 31P NMR spectroscopies with the [H 2O2]: [HPA] ratio = 50. Several peroxo species were observed by 31P NMR spectroscopy at a lower field than the original heteropolyacids. Their composition varied regularly with that of the starting catalyst. The P-containing peroxo species formed were deduced as [(PO 4){Mo4-xWxO20}]3- (x= 0-4), which are the true catalytically active species under the reaction conditions.",

Especially, when H 7 P 2 Mo 17 VO 62 was used to catalyze the reaction between acetone and epoxypropane, the selectivity to 1,3-dioxolane reached to 93.3% with nearly complete conversion of epoxide and 1.1 \u00d7 10 4 h \u22121 of TOF. Graphical abstract Wells\u2013Dawson Heteropoly acids (H 6+ n P 2 Mo 18\u2212 n V n O 62 ) ( n = 0\u20132, 4) have proved to be efficient heterogeneous catalysts for the reaction of epoxides with carbonyl compounds to form 1,3-dioxolane derivatives. Keywords Cycloaddition Wells\u2013Dawson type molybdovanadophosphoricacids Epoxides Carbonyl compound 1,3-Dioxolane 1 Introduction Epoxides are important intermediates in organic synthesis [1] and their reactions with different nucleophiles under both nonsolvolytic [1,2] and solvolytic conditions have been the subject of extensive studies [3] . Direct conversion of epoxides into 1,3-dioxolanes with carbonyl compounds instead of adding water to form a diol with subsequent elimination is a subject of interest due to the importance of 1,3-dioxolanes as widely used protecting groups for diols and particularly for carbohydrates and steroid chemistry [4] . In addition, compounds with 1,3-dioxolanes structure or moiety are of interest in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and fragrances. 1,3-Dioxolanes were usually prepared from oxiranes with carbonyl compounds in the presence of Lewis or Br\u00f8nsted acid catalysts [5] . The use of BF 3 \u00b7OEt 2 , SnCl 4 , TiCl 4 [6] , KSF clay [7] , HBF 4 [8] and some other Lewis acids has been investigated for this transformation. Among these Lewis acids, BF 3 \u00b7OEt 2 has been successfully used for conversion of different types of carbonyl compounds to their corresponding 1,3-dioxolane derivatives with only ethylene and propylene oxides [6] , whereas SnCl 4 and TiCl 4 gave little or no acetal [5] . TiO(TFA) 2 , TiCl 3 (OTf) [9] , RuCl 3 [10] were also very effective catalysts for this reaction. The achieved yields were comparable to those observed with BF 3. Anhydrous copper sulfate [11] was also shown to be a suitable catalyst for the reaction of acetone and expoxides, resulting in convenient rates and good yields [11] . Noble metal catalysts such as [Cp * Ir(NCMe) 3 2+ ] [12] and CH 3 ReO 3 [13] and N -benzylpyridium hexafluoroantimonates [14] can also catalyze the title reaction. Some solid materials, zeolites (ZSM-5, Y and ultra stabilized HUSY)K10 montmorillonite [5] , can also be used to produce the dioxolanes derivatives from expoxides and carbonyl compounds. Heteropoly compounds have many advantages as catalysts that make them economically and environmentally attractive both in academic and industrial chemistry. Heteropoly compounds are effective catalysts for various reactions and have high capability in practical uses, because their redox and acidic properties can be controlled at the atomic/molecular levels by changing the constituent elements as per the needs of the chemical process [15] . Keggin-type heteropolyacids have been investigated for conversion of epoxides with acetone to give 1,3-dioxolanes, but polymerization and isomerization of epoxides greatly inhibit the formation of 1,3-dioxolanes [13] . Recently, Habibi [16] and Mirkhani [17] have reported the conversions of epoxides to 1,3-dioxolanes in the presence of K 5 CoW 12 O 40 \u00b73H 2 O and (NH 4 ) 8 [CeW 10 O 36 ]\u00b720H 2 O, respectively. Although the substrate could also be completely consumed over (NH 4 ) 8 [CeW 10 O 36 ]\u00b720H 2 O, the prolonged reaction time (1.5\u20135 h) or/and the high temperature (reflux conditions) are needed. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a more effective and convenient catalytic system for this reaction. Here, we first report a novel and extremely efficient method for conversion of epoxides to their corresponding 1,3-dioxolanes using Wells\u2013Dawson heteropoly acids as catalysts ( Scheme 1 ). 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and reagents All reagents used were highest purity commercial products (99%), and applied to the reaction without further purification. Keggin-type heteropolyacids, such as 12-tungstophoric acid (H 3 PW 12 O 40 \u00b725H 2 O), 12-tungstosilicic acid (H 4 SiW 12 O 40 \u00b726H 2 O) and 12-molybdophosphoric acid (H 3 PMo 12 O 40 \u00b728H 2 O), were purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagent Co. with CP. Before use, these reagents were dried at 60 \u00b0C for 48 h. 2.2 Preparation of catalysts The catalyst H 6 P 2 W 18 O 62 was prepared according to previous method [18] . H 7 P 2 W 17 VO 62 was prepared from an aqueous solution of \u03b1 2 -K 7 P 2 W 17 VO 62 [19] . H 6 P 2 Mo 18 O 62 was prepared according to the report of Wu [20] . H 6+ n P 2 Mo 18\u2212 n V n O 62 (n = 1, 2, 4) was synthesized according to Ref. [21] . H 4 PMo 11 VO 40 were prepared according to Ref. [22] . The structure of the prepared catalysts was confirmed by FTIR, UV\u2013vis, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and elemental analysis, and the results were all satisfactory. Purities of all prepared heteropolyacid catalysts are >98% according to the above-mentioned analysis. 2.3 Catalytic reactions 2.3.1 Reaction procedure All reactions were carried out in a magnetically stirred flask equipped with a dropping funnel and a condenser. The heteropolyacid 0.1 mol% based on the oxirane was used. The oxirane was added to a mixture of the catalyst and the carbonyl compound through a dropping funnel within 5 min at room temperature. 2.3.2 Products analysis Quantitative and qualitative analysis of organic components were conducted with a HP6890/5973 GC/MS and a Techcomp GC-7890 II equipped with an FID detector. The concentration of reactant and product was directly given by the system of GC chemstation according to the area of each chromatograph peak. The GC yield was obtained in a Perkin-Elmer AutoSystem XL GC equipped with an FFAP (50 m \u00d7 0.25 mm column) using chlorobenzene as internal standard. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of catalysts on the cycloaddition of epoxides with carbonyl compound Table 1 shows the results of the cycloaddition reaction of 1,2-epoxypropane with acetone over various types of heteropolyacids. The selectivity to 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-dioxolane was strongly dependent on the kinds of the HPA catalysts while the conversions of 1,2-epoxypropane were not sensitive and are all higher than 95% in the presence of catalysts (Entries 1\u20139). No reaction was observed in the absence of catalyst (Entry 10). Compared with Wells\u2013Dawson type heteropolyacids (H 6+ n P 2 Mo 18\u2212 n V n O 62 ) ( n = 0\u20132, 4) were preferable to Keggin type heteropolyacids, which were less selective to 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-dioxolane. Especially, when H 7 P 2 Mo 17 VO 62 was used, the selectivity was as high as 93.3% with a nearly complete conversion of 1,2-epoxypropane. It is worthy to be noted that the TOF of H 6+ n P 2 Mo 18\u2212 n V n O 62 ( n = 0\u20132, 4) in this reaction was all greater than 1.0 \u00d7 10 4 h \u22121 . The ring-opening oligomerization products of 1,2-epoxypropane were also detected by GC/MS analyses. Interestingly, 2-ethyl-4-methyl-1,3-dioxolane (less than 1% in entry 2), which is derived from the cycloaddition reaction between acetaldehyde and 1,2-epoxypropane, was also detected although its amount was negligible. It demonstrates the isomerization of 1,2-epoxypropane to acetaldehyde was also possible under acidic conditions. Environmental and economical consideration prompts an urgent need to redesign commercially important processes. In this context, heterogeneous catalysts play a dramatic role [23] . The use of heterogeneous catalysts in different areas of the organic synthesis has now reached significant levels, not only for the possibility to perform environmentally benign synthesis, but also for the good yields, accompanied by excellent selectivity that can be achieved. In fact, the advantages of these catalysts are: (i) the easy workup (separation of the catalyst simply by filtration); (ii) the high level of purity of the products; (iii) and the possibility of recycling catalysts, as well as avoiding the use of noxious substances [17] . In this case, we have found that H 7 P 2 Mo 17 VO 62 is immiscible with reaction mixture and could be reused four times without visible loss of the activity in the reaction between 1,2-epoxypropane and acetone ( Table 1 , Entry 11), simply by filtering the catalyst, washing with acetone, drying and immediately reusing. Therefore, this catalyst can be used as a stable and recyclable catalyst. 3.2 Reactions of various epoxides with acetone catalyzed by H 7 P 2 Mo 17 VO 62 The results of cycloadditions of different epoxides with acetone over H 7 P 2 Mo 17 VO 62 are shown in Table 2 . This catalyst proved to be very active toward all examined epoxides (Entries 1, 2, 4\u20139), catalyst loads as low as 0.1 mol% leading to high epoxide conversion within 5 min at room temperature. For the purpose of comparison, a reported result was also listed in Table 2 (Entry 3). In our H 7 P 2 Mo 17 VO 62 catalytic system, epichlorohydrin could be completely converted to the corresponding desired product within 5 min whereas the same reaction has to be carried out at reflux conditions for 7 h over K 5 CoW 12 O 40 \u00b73H 2 O with a slight inferior yield [16] . Although, at worst, the selectivity to 1,3-dioxolane was 90.4% (Entry 5), it presents a potential advantage over conventional catalytic systems. Using H 7 P 2 Mo 17 VO 62 as catalyst, we found that 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-dioxolane was formed with a TOF of 1.1 \u00d7 10 4 which is much greater than that of conventional catalytic systems. It clearly indicates the high efficiency of this catalyst. Therefore, we have introduced Wells\u2013Dawson type heteropolyacids (H 6+ n P 2 Mo 18\u2212 n V n O 62 ) ( n = 0\u20132, 4), especially H 7 P 2 Mo 17 VO 62 , as more suitable, nonhygroscopic, nontoxic, available, stable, reusable and heterogeneous catalysts for the title reactions. In addition, the advantages, such as mild reaction conditions, ease of preparation, simple filtration at the end of reaction and high yields, give a new synthetic application of H 7 P 2 Mo 17 VO 62 in organic synthesis. 3.3 Reactions of different carbonyl compounds with 1,2-epoxypropane over H 7 P 2 Mo 17 VO 62 Table 3 shows the results of H 7 P 2 Mo 17 VO 62 catalyzed reactions between 1,2-epoxypropane and ketones or aldehydes. All the ketones with the exception of diisopropyl ketone, which gave the corresponding 1,3-dioxolane with 85.2% epoxide conversion, reacted with 1,2-epoxypropane in almost quantitative epoxide conversion and good selectivity to the 1,3-dioxolanes at room temperature within 5 min. The poor reactivity of diisopropyl ketone may be caused by its steric hindrance. When using aliphatic aldehydes as substrate, the epoxide conversions are all satisfactory. However, the selectivity of 1,3-dioxolanes slightly declined with formations of a few unidentified by-products. When benzaldehyde was used as substrate, the corresponding 1,3-dioxolane was formed in 98.9% epoxide conversion and 96.3% selectivity. In view of the foregoing, H 7 P 2 Mo 17 VO 62 has a good generality as catalyst for the reactions of epoxides with carbonyl compounds. It is worthy to be noted that TOF of this catalyst in Table 3 was all greater than 0.9 \u00d7 10 4 , indicating the effectiveness of our catalytic system. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, Wells\u2013Dawson type heteropoly acids (H 6+ n P 2 Mo 18\u2212 n V n O 62 ) ( n = 0\u20132, 4) proved to be effective catalysts for the reactions between epoxides and aldehydes or ketones to afford 1,3-dioxolanes. Various epoxides could be efficiently converted to 1,3-dioxolanes over H 7 P 2 Mo 17 VO 62 catalyst within 5 min. Short reaction time, simple work up, mild reaction conditions and reliable reusability are the features obtained in the Wells\u2013Dawson type heteropoly acids catalytic systems. References [1] J.G.

The TS-1 synthesized from the inorganic reactant system has been demonstrated to have the same characteristics with the standard TS-1 from organic synthesis system by XRD, IR, UV-vis, SEM, elemental analysis and N2 adsorption/desorption. The influence of various synthesis parameters such as base source, SiO2/TiO2 ratio, N2 protection, seed crystals, amounts of template, silicon source and crystallization time has been investigated in detail. It has been shown that the control of basicity of the reaction mixture is critical for the synthesis; N2 protection is essential when reactants were mixed; adding seeds can greatly facilitate the formation of the TS-1 crystal; there is a critical value for the minimum amount of TBABr required to crystallize TS-1; TS-1 crystals obtained with colloidal silicon are usually large.",

The samples were characterized by multiple experiments to confirm their uniform morphology, which belongs to the spinel structure (Fd3m space group). The catalytic activity of ACo 2 O 4  samples was investigated under photochemical, chemical, and electrochemical conditions; it follows the catalytic activity order NiCo 2 O 4 \u00a0u003e\u00a0CuCo 2 O 4 \u00a0u003e\u00a0ZnCo 2 O 4 . This activity sequence results from different doping metal ions in {Co 4 O 4 } motifs, which act as the active sites of water oxidation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and other experimental data demonstrate that ACo 2 O 4  samples doped with different metal ions may influence the rate of charge and electron transport. Therefore, the catalytic activity of water oxidation followed the above order.",

Here, doping with Mn element and coating with NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) have been applied to enhance the charge separation efficiency and charge injection efficiency of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3  as a water oxidation catalyst in the PEC water splitting process. The Mn doping improves the charge separation efficiency from 20% to 35% at high potential. The coating amount of NiFe-LDH, which can be controlled by hydrothermal conditions, has a significant effect on the performance of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 . At low precursor concentrations, the formed thin NiFe-LDH has little effect on the light absorption of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 , while NiFe-LDH fabricated at high precursor concentrations forms a thick layer that affects the light absorption of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 . The thin NiFe-LDH layer shifts the onset potential negatively and enhances the charge injection efficiency to 90% at high potential.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To analyze the dynamic impact induced by a heavy vehicle crossing a modular type expansion joint and its effect on the bridge response, a numerical method based on a distributed spring-damper element is presented, in which the contact patch between the tire and the road is considered. The dynamic response of the vehicle and bridge can be obtained by dynamic finite element analysis of the vehicle-bridge system taking into account the bumpy ride of vehicle at the expansion joint. The reduced support to the parts of tire structure over the cavities of the modular expansion joint is considered, and the vertical tire load can be obtained by an iteration procedure. To assess the dynamic impact at the expansion joint on bridge design, the impact factors associated with the vehicle tire loads, and the bearing reactions, shear forces and bending moments of the bridge are evaluated. The multi-gap modular expansion joints leads to lower impact factors than single-gap expansion joints. The effects of dynamic impact at expansion joint on the bearing reactions and shear forces are greater than that on the bending moments of the bridge. Numerical results also show that the impact effects of vehicle axle load and internal forces of the bridge may be higher than those recommended by bridge codes, and they may affect the durability of components in the vicinity.",

These catalysts were investigated simultaneously for electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water oxidation for the first time. Among them, Cu-ZIF-400 can act as the best electrochemical water oxidation catalyst with a low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 342\u00a0mV at 10.0\u00a0mA\u00a0cm \u22122  in alkaline electrolyte.

The quite high catalytic turnover number (TON 925), turnover frequency (TOF 7.0\u00a0s \u22121 ) and 24% quantum yield of [Co 2 (\u03b2-SiW 8 O 31 ) 2 ] 16\u2212  (Co-POM) for oxygen evolution are achieved at pH 9.0 using [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+  as photosensitizer and persulfate as sacrificial electron acceptor. Various experiments including laser flash photolysis, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), UV\u2013vis spectra and IR confirm that Co-POM is the dominant catalyst during water oxidation process. The results offer a utile insight into the design of water oxidation catalysts.",

The valence band edge of WO 3  located at \u223c3\u00a0V  vs.  normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), which can offer enough potential to kinetically oxidize water for oxygen evolution reaction. However, water oxidation reaction kinetics is sluggish when only WO 3  is used as the photoanode. It is highly desirable to use cocatalyst to promote the kinetics. MnO x  loaded on the WO 3  photoanode through photodeposition methods improves the photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance. A maximum photocurrent density of composite photoanode is achieved with a deposition time of 3\u00a0min, which is higher than that of pristine WO 3  photoanode around 40%. MnO 2  is not only a cocatalyst for water splitting but also for improving oxidation selectivity. We tried to use two means to load MnO x  on WO 3  photoanode material. It is observed that loading a moderate amount of MnO x  on the WO 3  by photodeposition can promote the performance of the WO 3  photoanode.",

Through careful characterization and analysis of selected-area, highly selective in-situ photo-deposition of Fe 11 POM into ultrathin nanofilm on the decisive 110 facet of BiVO 4  under ultrapure water is clearly observed, and an intimate connection between nanofilm and hole-rich 110 facet is obtained in favor of enhancing surface catalytic efficiency. The exquisite decoration of ultrathin nanofilm can be further clarified as FeO x  decomposed from Fe 11 POM, which could effectively capture the photogenerated holes and suppress the recombination of electron\u2013hole pairs for promoting water oxidation performance through fast interfacial hole transfer process.",

Here, facet effect of model spinel Co 3 O 4  on water oxidation driven by visible-light is investigated in a well-established [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ -S 2 O 8  2\u2212  (bpy\u202f=\u202f2,2-bipyridine) biomimetic system to unveil the internal water oxidation mechanism for the first time. Spinel Co 3 O 4  catalysts in the morphologies of nanocube, nanorod and nanosheet are synthesized successfully by bottom-up nanotechnologies, and they predominantly expose the well-defined crystal planes of {100}, {110} and {112}, respectively. Using time-resolved laser \ufb02ash photolysis approach, the dynamically electronic transfer in photocatalytic courses of three Co 3 O 4  catalysts are distinguished in the nanosecond scale. The three model catalysts show a facet-dependent activity rule that the water oxidation performance of {112} is similar with that of {110} and much better than that of {100}. The Co 2+ -Co 2+  active sites with an ionic distance of 3.495\u202fA for catalyzing water oxidation only appear in {112} and {110} planes except for {100}, which is possibly responsible for the unique activity order of three Co 3 O 4  catalysts. Furthermore, the Co 2+  ions in the tetrahedral sites of spinel Co 3 O 4  are confirmed to be more active than the Co 3+  ions in the octahedral sites under visible-light driven water oxidation. The new insights shed a light on developing advanced nanocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal-based phosphides have been increasingly developed as catalysts for efficient water splitting. However, their catalytic performance for oxygen evolution still needs further improvement through incorporating new physical and chemical effects. Herein, for the first time, we constructed phosphorus vacancies in cobalt phosphide integrated with reduced graphene oxide (R-CoPx/rGO) as a precursor template for defect engineering for efficient water oxidation. This template in situ transforms into the defect- and lattice distortion-enriched \u03b2-CoOOH integrated with rGO (R-CoPx/rGO(O)), which simultaneously results in significantly enhanced oxygen evolution activity and stability. This catalyst with a 3D hierarchical nanostructure and defect-enriched surface exhibits a small overpotential of 268 mV (10 mA cm\u22122) and high current density of 311 mA cm\u22122 at 1.8 V vs. RHE for oxygen evolution, outperforming the precious metal RuO2 catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the oxygen defects induced by phosphorus vacancies can promote the electrical conductivity of \u03b2-CoOOH. Furthermore, we prove the essential role of the unique \u03b2-CoOOH for efficient water oxidation via a carbon layer coating strategy. This study provides a new path for the development of metal phosphides as precursors for high performance OER catalysts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Water oxidation reaction is the bottleneck process of water splitting. The exploration of efficient water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) is of great importance for accelerating this reaction. Herein, a cobalt(II)-containing complex {K 2 [CoO 3 PCH 2 N(CH 2 CO 2 ) 2 ]} 6  (K 12  1 ) with symmetrical hexameric ring structure and polynuclearity as an efficient visible light-driven WOC is reported. Using [Ru(bpy) 3 ](ClO 4 ) 2  as photosensitizer and Na 2 S 2 O 8  as sacrificial electron acceptor, an optimal oxygen yield of 62.6%, turnover number (TON) of 4350 and turnover frequency (TOF) of 162.6 s \u22121  are obtained. To the best of our knowledge, this TON and TOF are the highest value among all the catalyst for light driven water oxidation. In addition, a high quantum yield of 60.6% is achieved. Investigation including UV\u2013vis absorption, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and other techniques confirm that  1  is a stable and efficient catalyst for visible light-driven water oxidation. Collective experiments demonstrate that  1  catalyses visible light-driven water oxidation via water nucleophilic attack (WNA) process and its high activity may be originated from the multiple sites water oxidation catalysis.",

By changing the calcination temperature, we investigated the correlation between the nanostructure and catalytic performance of mesoporous Mn 1.8 Fe 1.2 O 4  catalysts. Mesoporous Mn 1.8 Fe 1.2 O 4  exhibited high oxygen evolution activity in both the photochemical and cerium (IV)-driven water oxidation systems. The highest initial turnover frequency (TOF) of 4.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22124 \u00a0s \u22121  per metal atom is obtained at neutral pH in photocatalytic water oxidation reaction, compared with those nonporous MnFe 2 O 4 , Fe 3 O 4 , and Mn 3 O 4 .

Herein, a Co-based POM was investigated for modifying Fe2O3 photoanodes. The photogenerated carriers of Fe2O3 have a fundamental effect on Co8POM. Ultrathin CoOx overlayer derived from Co8POM is confirmed as the true active species, which was prepared by a simple photodeposition method. This CoOx nanolayer effectively restrains the surface states on the hematite nanorod and reduces the water oxidation overpotential. Our CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 composite photoanode affords the best PEC performance and the highest photovoltage when compared with pristine Fe2O3 photoanode and CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 photoanode prepared by a simple cobalt salt. The photocurrent density of CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanode is 2.2 times higher than that of pristine Fe2O3 photoanodes. Meanwhile, the CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 composite photoanode achieves faster transient photoresponse and an improved charge injection efficiency of 80%.",

Herein, a series of cobalt-based oxides, MnCoO (M = Mn, Fe, Co) samples, were synthesized through changing the metal sources by a low-temperature coprecipitation method. These catalysts were investigated under photochemical and electrochemical water oxidation conditions. And they all exhibited efficient activity for water oxidation under alkaline, acidic and neutral conditions under visible light irradiation. An excellent O yield of 90.4% for Fe-Co bimetal oxide (FeCoO) nanorods was obtained under optimal conditions (photoirradiation at \u03bb \u2265 420 nm, [Ru(bpy)](ClO) as the photosensitizer, NaSO as the oxidant in borate buffer at pH = 9.0, bpy = 2,2-bipyridine). Among MnCoO samples, FeCoO nanorods were proved to be the optimal electrocatalytic water oxidation catalyst as well. Multiple experiments (SEM, FT-IR, XRD, XPS, Bulk electrolysis) were used to test the stability of FeCOO and these results indicate that FeCOO nanorods are highly stable. Furthermore, based on Mott-Schottky and cyclic voltammetry analysis, the best balanced flat-band potential of FeCOO nanorods is just located at the middle position between the oxidation potential of O/HO and the half-wave potential of [Ru(bpy)], which was probably responsible for their superior photocatalytic water oxidation performance.",

        "abstract": "A novel material of porous Co3O4/CuO hollow polyhedral nanocages (HPNCs) derived-from metal-organic frameworks (MOF) for photocatalytic water oxidation was reported for the first time and the molar ratio of Co/Cu in this kind material was optimized. The Co3O4/CuO HPNCs composites were characterized by multiple experiments (FETEM, HRTEM, SEM, TGA, PXRD, EDX, ICP-AES, BET, XPS) to confirm the structure and the component. A high turnover frequency (TOF) of 4.9 x 10(-3) s(-1) per metal atom was obtained over Co3O4/CuO-3 HPNCs, which is comparable to those published cobalt based catalysts. At the same time, Co3O4/CuO-3 HPNCs showed a maximum oxygen yield of 50% and quantum yield of 49%. This composite of Co3O4/CuO HPNCs containing heterojunctions may enhance the photocatalytic performance of water oxidation.Various characterization methods prove that Co3O4/CuO HPNCs composites are stable and robust heterogeneous photocatalytic catalysts that can be used repeatedly without any loss in activity. According to the experimental results, we speculate that there are two kinds of reaction mechanisms in this light-driven water oxidation system. One mechanism is widely accepted that high valence metal species play a role in the reaction system. The other one is that the heterojunctions of Co3O4/CuO HPNCs make a great contribution to improve the activity of photocatalytic water oxidation. Meanwhile, we put forward a new idea to design a series of metal oxide catalysts with heterojunctions derived from MOF for light-driven water oxidation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Water oxidation catalysts have been usually used to enhance the charge injection efficiency of WO3 anodes. Herein, we simultaneously improve the charge separation efficiency and charge injection efficiency, as well as the oxidation selectivity of WO3 for photoelectrochemical water oxidation by loading CoOx nanoparticles in a neutral electrolyte. The produced oxygen is monitored by a Clark electrode, which shows a high Faradaic efficiency on CoOx/WO3. In an effort to gain insight into the role of CoOx on the high Faradaic efficiency, the rotating ring\u2013disk electrode system was used to detect the products of the CoOx/WO3 heterojunction in the photoelectrochemical water oxidation process. The results show that the loading of CoOx nanoparticles can improve oxidation selectivity of WO3 and therefore improve the Faradaic efficiency of WO3.",

Based on Pourbaix slope analysis, a two proton-one electron transfer is discovered in the amorphous Ni0.75Fe0.25(OH)x catalyst.

        "abstract": "The development of efficient and stable catalyst systems using low-cost, abundant, and nontoxic materials is the primary demand for photocatalytic water oxidation. Distinguishing the true active species in a heterogeneous catalytic system is important for construction of efficient catalytic systems. Herein, hydrothermally synthesized Ti self-doped TiO, labeled as Ti/TiO, was first used as a light absorber in a powder visible light-driven photocatalytic water oxidation reaction. When an iron-containing polyoxometalate Na[Fe(HO)(OH)(WO)(\u03b1-SbWO)] (Fe11) was used as a cocatalyst, an amorphous layer of active species was wrapped outside the initial Ti/TiO nanorod and the in situ formed composite was labeled as F/Ti/TiO. When the composite F/Ti/TiO was tested as a photocatalytic water oxidation catalyst, dramatically improved oxygen evolution performance was achieved. The composite F/Ti/TiO showed an oxygen evolution rate of 410 \u03bcmol/g/h, which was about 11-fold higher than that of prism Ti/TiO. After 24 h of illumination, an O yield of 36.4% was achieved. The contrast experiments, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization demonstrated that FeO  is the true cocatalyst that enhanced the oxygen evolution activity of TiO. A recycling experiment proved that the composite F/Ti/TiO has favorable stability in the oxygen production process.",

This structure of the NiO/CoO/Fe2O3 composite may enhance the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic performance for water oxidation. Compared with NiO, CoO and Fe2O3, the NiO/CoO/Fe2O3 composite exhibits a lower overpotential and a much smaller Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1) for water oxidation. At the same time, the composite possesses beneficial ferromagnetic properties and superior stability; thus, it can be used repeatedly without any loss in activity. ",

However, the intrinsically high electron\u2013hole recombination and low charge mobility greatly diminish the PEC efficiency. Herein, we demonstrated that metal organic framework MIL-53(Fe) could serve as an efficient hole-transfer co-catalyst to significantly improve the PEC performance of Mo-doped BiVO4 photoanodes toward water oxidation under solar irradiation, which is much higher than that of the traditional FeOOH co-catalyst under the same conditions. More specifically, owing to the unique 3D interlinked nanochannel and confinement effect of Fe atom sites, the charge separation, hole transport at the interface, and interactions with H2O molecules have been effectively facilitated, which thus allows for enhancing PEC water oxidation properties.",

Herein, a facile solution impregnation method is developed for growing highly crystalline \u03b2-FeOOH nanolayers with ultrathin thickness (2 nm) and abundant oxygen vacancies on BiVO4 photoanodes, which exhibited a remarkable photocurrent density of 4.3 mA\u2009cm-2 at 1.23 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), AM 1.5\u2009G), approximately 2-fold higher than that of amorphous FeOOH fabricated by electrodepositions. Systematic studies reveal that the excellent PEC activity should be attributed to their ultrathin crystalline structure and abundant oxygen vacancies, which could effectively facilitate the hole transport/trapping and provide more active sites for water oxidation.",

In this work, four kinds of stable magnetic Co@CoO core-shell nanocrystals were fabricated through a one-pot toluene-water two-phase interfacial reaction with oleic acid as a surfactant. The size and shape of the as-prepared crystals can be carefully adjusted through dynamically coating the closely packed monolayer of coordinating ligand onto the growing crystals. It is notable that spherical pine-nut-like hierarchical assemblies of Co@CoO core-shell nanoplates exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity (the maximum value of O 2  yield is over 96%). Even after the sixth run, the high catalytic activity of the recovered Co@CoO core-shell nanoplates remained.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Transition-metal complexes, especially cobalt complexes, are used as precatalysts in homogeneous water oxidation catalysis. However, a practical method of identifying the effective active species in cobalt-complex homogeneous catalysts under highly oxidizing conditions have not yet been established. In this work, (H 3 O) 6 \u00b7[Co 4 (H 2 O) 4 (HPMIDA) 2 (PMIDA) 2 ]\u00b72H 2 O ( 1 ) was introduced, and its photocatalytic performance was evaluated. The compound exhibited effective water oxidation catalysis, with a turnover number of 661.5 at pH 9.0 using [Ru(bpy) 3 ](ClO 4 ) 2  as photosensitizers and sodium persulfate as sacrificial electron acceptor. Accordingly,  1  was used as target catalysts, and the active species was thoroughly investigated under catalytic conditions. The stability of  1  was further tested and confirmed by a series of experiments (cyclic voltammetry (CV), ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013vis) spectrometry, dynamic light-scattering (DLS), aging experiments, and extraction techniques). Results showed that  1  maintained its structural integrity under the given photocatalytic conditions. Furthermore, cathodic adsorptive stripping voltammetry and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry were used to quantify the amount of Co 2+  ions released from  1  into borate buffer after oxidation. The pH dependence of the oxygen-evolution performance of  1  and other cobalt species were then compared. Data collectively revealed that  1  was stable during water oxidation; it did not release free Co 2+  ions and was not hydrolyzed to cobalt oxide or hydroxide, thereby confirming that  1  was the effective active species in water-oxidation catalysis.",

A careful physical investigation of this molecule reveals that VB=\u22126.34 eV/CB=\u22124.39 eV, this unique physical properties ensures that 1 can be defined as a new type of nanoscale molecular semiconductor. This compound showed remarkable catalytic property for light driven H2 evolution activity.

        "abstract": "Water-soluble K7[CoIIICoII(H 2O)W11O39] (1) was tested as the first cobalt-containing Keggin polyoxometalate catalyst for efficient O2 production via both visible-light driven and thermal water oxidation. Under the optimal photocatalytic conditions [photoirradiation at \u03bb \u2265 420 nm, [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 as the photosensor, Na2S 2O8 as the oxidant in borate buffer (pH = 9.0)],the turnover number (TON) can reach as high as 360, the initial quantum yield and the initial turnover frequency (TOF) for the first 60 seconds was 27% and 0.5 s-1, respectively. Variables of the photocatalytic reaction, including catalyst concentrations, buffer types and concentrations, pHs, dye concentrations, oxidant concentrations, etc., were systemically studied. The oxygen atoms of the evolved oxygen came from water, as confirmed by isotope-labeled experiments. In the thermal water oxidation, the TON and oxygen yield were measured to be 15 and 60%, respectively. The stability of 1 was tested and confirmed with multiple experiments (laser flash photolysis, DLS, CV, FT-IR, EDX, and catalyst recycling) within the photocatalytic water oxidation duration, which ruled out the possibility that neither the free Co2+ ions were present in the reaction solution nor were cobalt oxide/hydroxide nanoparticles in situ formed from the assumed decomposition of 1. All the evidence stated here collectively supports that 1 is the true molecular catalyst. In addition, the recycled sample was reused for water oxidation catalysis and showed similar catalytic behaviors (kinetics and activity) to that of the freshly prepared catalyst. No insoluble forms where found when the borate buffer solution of 1 was aged for 2 months, whereas its analogue, K 8[CoIICoII(H2O)W11O 39] (4), is rapidly decomposed to a blue-purple cobalt oxide precipitate in borate buffer. The stability difference between 1 and 4 indicates that the +3 oxidation state of the central cobalt in 1 plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity. A series of other Keggin-type POMs, such as K6[CoIIW12O40] (2), K 5[CoIIIW12O40] (3), K 6[SiCoII(H2O)W11O39] (5), and K5[PCoII(H2O)W11O39] (6), were also evaluated for their catalytic activity by comparison with 1. Our study demonstrates that the unique structural features of the mixed-valent central and peripheral cobalt atoms are essential for 1 to maintain both catalytic stability and efficiency.

The structures of the new compounds were characterized by IR spectroscopy, MS, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Assay of the newly prepared compounds for bioactivity against tumor cells revealed that the most of the compounds had good to excellent inhibitory activity against CDC25B (99.70 % inhibition). The 4-amino-5-[4-bi-(4-fluorophenyl) methylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl]-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione group was found to be beneficial group improving anti-tumor activity to some extent.",

        "abstract": "Although there are many smart devices and networked embedded object applications using World Wide Web technologies, it is still a big step to go towards a true Web of Things. It is e.g. difficult to build ubiquitous WoT applications that work in and accross multiple environments. Approaches which aggregate WoT ressources by centralizing all the resource information, have problems: total dependency on external infrasture, lack of private WoT management, inflexible communication patterns and limited dynamic ressource discovery and mapping. To solve these problems, we propose uBox, a local WoT platform which can be a stand-alone server to make your WoT environment, with interfaces to connect the other local WoT platforms. This way, which we call uBoXing, we can create World Wide WoT platform with a distributed architecture. This paper describes the concept of a distributed resource management architecture, and how we implement the concept into software. Also, we will discuss the platform with the example application in SmartTecO environment.",

Combining real-world measuring applications with web-based applications opens new opportunities to the smart grid. For this purpose, we propose a Web of Things framework for a novel load forecasting process at the appliance level. Firstly, we illustrate the concept design of the Web of Things framework consisting of the sensing infrastructure, the activity recognition and the load forecasting modules. Secondly, we show how we guarantee the modularity and flexibility for implementing all the three modules in a web-based manner. On top of our infrastructure, we propose an extended Web of Things use case by integrating our load forecasting approach into a demand response concept.",

Besides the prediction methods, forecasting performance also depends on the quality of training data. This is addressed by two characteristics of our framework on data collection and preprocessing. The first one is to introduce a human activity variable as an additional load influencing factor which reflects anomalous load patterns by aperiodic human activity. The second characteristic is to wavelet transform training data during the preprocessing stage to better extract redundant information from meter data. To investigate the feasibility of the proposed framework, a preliminary case study for predicting daily power consumption of several individual smart meters, using real-world data, is presented. The results indicate that, in general, the aggregation level of meter data and activity data matters.",

In comparison with the current traffic sensing systems, our light-weight technique has simpler structure in both terms of hardware and software. An antenna installed to the roadside or the inside of a car receives the signal generated during electrical activity of the vehicles' sub-systems. This signal feeds the feature extraction and classification blocks which recognize different classes of traffic situation in terms of density, flow and location. Different classifiers like naive Bayes, Decision Tree and k-Nearest Neighbor are applied in real-world scenarios and performances for instance of traffic situation detection are reported with higher than 95%. Although the electrical noises of the various vehicles do not have the same statistical characteristics, results from two experiments with an implementation on RF receiver illustrate that our approach is practically feasible for traffic monitoring goals. Due to the acceptable classification results and the differences between the proposed and current traffic monitoring techniques in terms of interfering factors, advantages and disadvantages, we propose it to work in parallel with the current systems to improve the coverage and efficiency of the traffic control network.",

The PaaS is hosted by a cloud of dinam-mite nodes which facilitates the on-demand development, deployment and integration of WSN applications. We introduce the dinam Cloud architecture and focus, in this paper, on the PaaS layer established by the dinam-mite nodes. In addition to the description of this so-called dinam PaaS, a performance analysis of the dinam-mite node towards its applicability to forming a dinam PaaS layer is demonstrated. We then present the MASON mobile vehicular network as an example of such a WSN which delivers spatially and temporally fine-grained environmental measurements within the city of Beijing, and illustrate how to utilize the dinam PaaS for integrating the data from the MASON network into its back-end business system. Finally, we discuss the five essential properties of the Cloud Computing stack, according to the NIST definition, with respect to the dinam PaaS and illustrate the benefits of the dinam PaaS for system integration as well as WSN application development.",

Using these requirements, related work is evaluated for applicability, indicating no adequate solutions.

In order to develop a smart-grid-ready power market with a high penetration of renewable energy, we need to decide what kind of pricing mechanisms or how to expand the grid is the right choice for the smart grid. We propose a real-time market-grid coupling, in order to analyze the mutual influence between the market and the grid. To support the investigation of the coupling concept in terms of the interoperability, we present in this paper a co-simulation framework that incorporates a market simulator and a grid simulator. The main contribution of this paper is the system design of the co-simulation framework. Based on the framework, we demonstrate the nodal price analysis as a use case to verify that Locational Marginal Pricing as a grid-driven pricing scheme that reflects the real-time load situation and power supply availability.",

In this paper, we extend our feedback control framework with a distributed model predictive control approach for coupling distributed power markets and grids, in order to investigate the mutual influence between them with respect to both price and supply-demand-balance stability. The main contribution of the paper focuses on the mathematical model of a distributed feedback control system for an interoperable control between distributed market and grid units. The controller objective refers to a concurrent market price and power dispatch stabilization through maximizing the total social welfare. Finally, we demonstrate simulation-based numerical results to show the capability of proposed collaborative model predictive control feedback loops towards the impact of an optimal dynamic dispatch on the market price stability.",

Machine generated event logs are a abundant source of information for understanding the causes and events that led to a critical event in the machine. In this work, we present a Sequence-Mining based technique to automatically extract sequential patterns of events from machine log data for understanding and predicting machine critical events. By experiments using real data with millions of log entries from over 150 industrial computer numerical control (CNC) cutting machines, we show how our technique can be successfully used for understanding the root causes of certain critical events, as well as for building monitors for predicting them long before they happen, outperforming existing techniques.",

However, experts are rare and expensive for companies and cannot be aware of all dependencies in the master data sets. In this paper, we introduce a complete process which applies association rule mining in the area of master data to extract such association dependencies for quality assessment. It includes the application of the association rule mining algorithm to master data and the classification of interesting rules (from the perspective of domain experts) in order to reduce the result association rules set to be analyzed by domain experts. The model can learn the knowledge of the domain expert and reuse it to classify the rules. As a result, only a few interesting rules are identified from the perspective of domain experts which are then used for database quality assessment and anomaly detection.",

Either the shear flow remains constant or the shear strain stays equal between the web and flange depends on the state of the corrugated steel web is in unyielding or yielding when the hybrid box-girder is in ultimate state. The effect of locations of prestressed tendons to torsional strength of the hybrid box-girder was also taken into consideration. The analytical model proposed in this paper was validated by four specimens subjected to cyclic pure torque. The results show that not only the torsional strength but also the torque-twist curve can be obtained through the analytical model developed in this paper.",

        "abstract": "Aiming at the tradeoff between tracking accuracy and energy consumption for target tracking in wireless sensor networks, a kind of energy-efficient dynamic collaborative self-organizing algorithm(E-DCS)is proposed, in which the comprehensive performance index is established based on the information utility, communication overhead and the residual energy of the nodes. And the AHP is adopted to determine the weight coefficients of the elements within performance index. In order to judge whether to switch the cluster head and select task nodes, this adaptive dynamic clustering strategy set the switching accuracy threshold of cluster head and the node selection accuracy threshold respectively. Cluster head uses the sequential EKF for state estimation according to the measurements provided by the nodes in the cluster. Compared with information-driven sensor query(IDSQ)and adaptively dynamic collaborative self-organizing algorithm(A-DCS), the proposed algorithm can reduce the energy consumption and prolong the life time of the network while meeting the precision requirement.",

        "abstract": "Morphology regulation is vital to obtain high-performance perovskite films. Vapor-assisted deposition provides a simple approach to prepare perovskite films with controlled vapor-solid reaction. However, dense PbI2 precursor films with large crystal grains make it difficult for organic molecules to diffuse and interact with inner PbI2 frame. Here, a surface modification process is developed to optimize the surface layer morphology of PbI2 precursor films and lower the resistance of induced period in crystallization. The vapor optimization time is shortened to several-second level and the intermediate phase forms on the surface layer of PbI2 films. We achieve porous PbI2 surface with smaller grains through dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vapor treatment, which promotes migration and reaction rate between CH3NH3I vapor and PbI2 layer. The PbI2 precursor films emerge dramatic morphological evolution, due to the formed intermediate phase on PbI2 surface layer. Taking advantage of the proposed surface modification process, we achieve high quality uniform perovskite films with larger crystal grains and without residual PbI2. The repeatable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with modified films exhibit power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 18.43% for planar structure. Moreover, the devices show less hysteresis because of improved films quality and reduced films density states. Our work expands the application of morphology control through forming intermediate phase and demonstrates an effective way to enhance the performance of the PSCs.",

        "abstract": "In order to achieve high quality perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the morphology and carrier transportation of perovskite films need to be optimized. Herein, C60 is employed as nucleation sites in PbI2 precursor solution to optimize the morphology of perovskite films via vapor-assisted deposition process. Accompanying with the homogeneous nucleation of PbI2, the incorporation of C60 as heterogeneous nucleation sites can lower the nucleation free energy of PbI2, which facilitates the diffusion and reaction between PbI2 and organic source. Meanwhile, C60 could enhance carrier transportation and reduce charge recombination in perovskite layer due to its high electron mobility and conductivity. In addition, the grain sizes of perovskite get larger with C60 optimizing, which can reduce the grain boundaries and voids in perovskite and prevent the corrosion of moisture. As a result, we obtain PSCs with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.33% and excellent stability. The PCEs of unsealed devices drop less than 10% in dehumidification cabinet after 100 d and remain 75% of the initial PCE during exposure to ambient air (humidity>60% RH, temperature>30\u00baC) for 30 d.",

        "abstract": "For PIN-type perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the hydroscopicity and acidity of PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer (HTL) perform critical influences on the device stability. To eliminate these problems, Nafion, the hydrophobic perfluorosulfonic-copolymer, is incorporated into PEDOT:PSS by simple spin-coating process. For the modified film, Nafion/PSSH acts as electron blocking layer on the surface and PEDOT-rich domain tends to gather into larger particles with better inter-chain charge transfer inside the film. Consequently, the modified-PEDOT:PSS HTL shows enhanced conductivity and light transmittance as well as more favorable work function, ending up with the increased short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of device. Finally, PSCs with Nafion-modified HTLs achieve the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.72%, with 23.76% improvement compared with PEDOT:PSS-only devices (13.51%). Most importantly, the device stability is obviously enhanced due to the hydrophobicity, chemical and mechanical stability of Nafion polymer that enriched on the surface of PEDOT:PSS film.",

Here, 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) was introduced into the CH3NH3PbI3 antisolvent to obtain high quality perovskite layers. In situ optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction patterns were used to prove that tBP significantly suppressed the perovskite nucleation by forming the intermediate phase. In addition, a gradient perovskite structure was obtained by this method, which greatly improved the efficiency and stability of perovskite. A champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.41% was achieved via tBP treatment and the high-efficiency device could maintain over 89% of the initial PCE after 30 days at room temperature.",

        "abstract": "Organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most attractive and efficient emerging thin film photovoltaic technologies. The perovskite films have been fabricated via lots of deposition methods, while these laboratory based fabrication methods are not well matched with large area manufacture. Herein, spray coating as a deposition technique is explored to prepare perovskite films to break the bottleneck that plagued large scale production. However, it is difficult to avoid the notorious \"coffee ring effect\" during the process of spraying perovskite films especially in one step spray method (OSSM). Thus, the vapor assisted spraying method (VASM), namely, fabricating perovskite films through vapor-solid in-situ reaction between CH3NH3I (MAI) vapor and sprayed PbI2 films, is creatively applied to the preparation of dense and uniform perovskite films. The surfaces of sprayed PbI2 films are optimized by adjusting the wettability, viscosity, and contact quality via various methods such as the selection of solvent, precursor solution concentration, and substrate temperature to inhibit the capillary flow and release the pinning contact line. The application of component solvent could effectively crush the dense structure of PbI2 layer, improving the morphology of PbI2 films as well as the reducing of coffee ring effect. Integrating the above aspects, the optimized PbI2 films could form uniform perovskite films via in-situ reaction with MAI vapor and a best PCE of 17.56% is achieved for planar structure PSCs, which is high among the PSCs fabricated by spraying method. In addition, the VASM could be applied in the actual condition for mass production, exhibiting excellent optical and electrical properties, and paving the way of the commercialization of PSCs.",

        "abstract": "Researchers working in the field of photovoltaic are exploring novel materials for the efficient solar energy conversion. The prime objective of the discovery of every novel photovoltaic material is to achieve more energy yield with easy fabrication process and less production cost features. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) delivering the highest efficiency in the passing years with different stoichiometry and fabrication modification has made this technology a potent candidate for future energy conversion materials. Till now, many studies have shown that the quality of active layer morphology, to a great extent, determines the performance of PSCs. The current and potential techniques of solvent engineering for good active layer morphology are mainly debated using primary solvent, co-solvent (Lewis acid-base adduct approach) and solvent additives. In this review, the dynamics of numerously reported solvents on the morphological characteristics of PSCs active layer are discussed in detail. The intention is to get a clear understanding of solvent engineering induced modifications on active layer morphology in PSC devices via different crystallization routes. At last, an attempt is made to draw a framework based on different solvent coordination properties to make it easy for screening the potent solvent contender for desired PSCs precursor for a better and feasible device.",

        "abstract": "Herein, we employ a simple star-shaped hole-transporting material (HTM) consisting of a carbazole core and triphenylamine side arms, termed LD29, in mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). LD29 exhibits a deep HOMO level of \u22125.24 eV, a high hole mobility of 1.72 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, and a relatively high glass-transition temperature of 121 \u00b0C, as well as good film-forming ability. PSCs using dopant-free LD29 as the HTM layer exhibit a maximum efficiency of 14.29%. Promisingly, when LD29 is doped, a champion efficiency over 18% has been achieved, which is even comparable with that of the conventional doped spiro-OMeTAD. Moreover, the laboratory synthesis cost for LD29 is significantly lower than that for spiro-OMeTAD. Importantly, the PSC performance does not change greatly with the concentration of LD29 regardless of whether the dopants are used, which has the potential to further reduce material usage. The device employing LD29 also shows comparable stability to that employing spiro-OMeTAD. Consequently, our results provide an important step forward for the commercialized application of PSCs.",

Here, interlaced ultrathin MnO 2  nanoflakes were vertically aligned on the carbon cloth (CC)  via  a facial potentiostatic electrochemical deposition method. A stable WPW for the MnO 2 /CC electrodes in three electrolytes of 0.5\u202fM A 2 SO 4  (A\u202f=\u202fLi, Na, K) was defined as 0\u20131.1\u202fV, which was attributed to the nanoporous morphology of the MnO 2  nanosheets and high content of structure water within it. Furthermore, the MnO 2  nanoflakes with 0.5\u202fM Na 2 SO 4  have achieved a high specific capacitance of 272.2\u202fF/g at 2\u202fmV/s, and the retention of the performance was 83.8% (5\u202fA/g) after 5000 cycling tests. As for the flexible asymmetric MnO 2  supercapacitors (FAMSC), the MnO 2 /CC electrode was used as a cathode and a self-assembled rGO film was developed as an anode. Working in an extended WPW of 0\u20132.2\u202fV, the FASMC exhibited a large energy density of 49.8\u202fWh/kg and the retention of the performance was 88.7% at 5\u202fA/g after 5000 cycles. This work provides a stable WPW for the MnO 2  electrodes, which may promote further development of the high-voltage neutral aqueous supercapacitors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are among the most attractive and efficient emerging thin film photovoltaic technologies. The perovskite films have been fabricated by lots of deposition methods, including one-step/two-step spin coating, thermal evaporation and vapor assisted processes. However, the laboratory-based fabrication methods are not well matched with large area manufacture for actual use. Spray coating deposition technique is being explored to prepare perovskite films to break the bottleneck plaguing large scale production. Herein, a comprehensive study is conducted in fabricating perovskite films by air-brush spraying method. The spraying process is classified into three stages, namely, 1) atomization process, 2) droplet flight and 3) film deposition. Each of them is discussed in detail from principles to parameters. Integrating the three aspects above, high quality perovskite films comparable to spin coated films are obtained. A best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.68% is achieved for planar structure PSCs, which is prominent among the PSCs fabricated by spraying method. In addition, devices with spraying method show excellent optical and electrical properties. The principles we discuss here could be applied in the actual condition for mass production.",

        "title": "Low Temperature Annealed Perovskite Films: A Trade-Off Between Fast and Retarded Crystallization Via Solvent Engineering.",
        "abstract": "In the current field of photovoltaic, researchers are working hard to produce efficient, stable and commercially feasible devices. The prime objective behind the innovation of any photovoltaic device is to yield more energy with the easy manufacture and less process cost. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are prominent in the field of photovoltaic, owing to its low material cost, simple fabrication process, and ideal optoelectronic properties. Despite rapid augmentation in progress of PSCs, it is still a bottleneck to produce high-quality perovskite layer at low temperature in a short time. Herein, a facile solvent engineering technique is used to produce high-quality perovskite layer at 50 \u00b0C in just 30 mins. We employed solvents coordination strength to form intermediate state as well as their sensitive behavior against anti-solvent to establish a trade-off between fast and retarded crystallization. Dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), a traditional co-solvent is used as an additive instead of co-solvent, in contrast, the mixed 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) and dimethylacetamide (DMAC) are employed as principal solvents for perovskite precursors. Different volume ratios of DMSO as a fraction of NMP are added to examine the evolution of the perovskite layer at low temperature. It is noted that the mixed solvent with 30% DMSO shows a pin-hole free, uniform and compact layer with strong absorption spectrum. Promisingly, the corresponding device with 30% DMSO shows a high efficiency reached to 18.19%, which is even comparable to traditionally high temperature annealed PSCs. These findings may provide a way to produce low-temperature annealed, high-quality perovskite films and subsequently facilitate the production of cost-effective and efficient devices.",

More importantly, the concentration of LD22 has little influence on the PSC performance regardless of the existence of dopants, which shows good repeatability. As a reference, the device with doped 2,2\u2032,7,7\u2032-tetrakis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)-9,9\u2032-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) shows a PCE of 17.73%. On the other hand, the laboratory synthesis cost of LD22 is much lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD.

The radical-mediated photopolymerization is a cross-linking polymerization process induced by the UV light to motivate the photoinitiator from the ground state to the excited state, which makes it possible to realize the rapid transformation of liquid monomers into solid polymer. After calcination to remove the solid polymer, pierced ZnO nanosheets show a well-defined interconnected architecture with large specific surface area and various pore sizes from mesopores to macropores. Additionally, the morphology and size of pores can be adjusted by changing the components of W/O microemulsion. Merited by the unique porous structure and high specific surface area, the pierced ZnO nanosheets demonstrate intended performance as an anode of lithium ion batteries. Moreover, this strategy is a well-designed and attractive method for producing other porous nanomaterials.",

        "abstract": "Even though organic\u2013inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as one of the most promising candidates for photovoltaic applications, simultaneously achieving a controlled microstructure and subdued trap states has proven to be challenging. In this work, ammonium benzenesulfonate (ABS) is introduced as a coordination and passivation molecule into a perovskite to improve the film quality and reduce defect densities. ABS can not only form the intermediate phase with precursor materials to decrease the crystallization rate, but also passivate both cationic and anionic defects at grain boundaries due to its zwitterionic structure. The trap density is significantly reduced, as demonstrated qualitatively by the confocal photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) mapping images and quantitatively by trap density of states measurement, leading to suppressed trap-induced non-radiative recombination and elongated carrier lifetimes. The highest device efficiency of 20.62% is achieved by the introduction of ABS, mainly originating from the improvement of Voc and FF. The moisture and oxygen tolerance of unencapsulated devices are also enhanced, with only 15% degradation of the initial efficiency after storage for 1400 h in an ambient environment with \u224830% humidity. This strategy offers a simple method to fabricate high-quality and low-defect perovskite films, demonstrating the potential of these high-performance PSCs for large-scale production.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   As a promising photocatalyst, the large band gap of TiO 2  imposes restriction on its light absorption in the visible region, making it less application in industrial fields. Herein, we design a facile solvothermal method to fabricate colorful defective TiO 2-x  microspheres with controllable morphological and porous structure, large specific surface area and tunable band gap on the basis of the Schiff base reaction between acetylacetone and ethylenediamine which produce bis(acetylacetone)ethylenediamine (acacen). The acacen, as a tetradentate Schiff-base ligand, has four binding sites which can stabilize titanium centers to produce titanium Schiff base complexes. The color of TiO 2-x -Ti(acacen) y  complexes changes from yellowish to brown and red with the variation of the acacen ligand, and the corresponding bandgap narrows from 3.25 eV to 2.16 eV as a result of the newly formed Ti 3+  and oxygen vacancies (Vo) in the TiO 2  lattice. In addition, red TiO 2-x  microspheres cooperating with titanium Schiff base complex demonstrate high photocatalytic efficiency in methylene blue under visible light as well as hydroxyl radical generation in contrast to yellowish TiO 2  microspheres, revealing the significance of this strategy for morphological and bandgap manipulation in defective TiO 2-x  nanomaterials for high-performance photocatalysis.",

        "abstract": "Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been widely studied and such research resulted in high power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, stability remains a great challenge when TiO2 or other wide bandgap n-type oxide semiconductors are used as the electron transport layer (ETL). The use of carbon such as fullerene (C60) as an ETL has shown promise with much improved UV stability. But there are two major obstacles to overcome: the first is the difficulty to fabricate C60 films with full coverage mainly due to the low solubility of fullerene in dichlorobenzene and the second is the hydrophobicity of C60 that hinders the deposition of pin hole free perovskite films with high crystallinity, intimate contact, and a desired columnar microstructure. In this work, a C60/ultrathin-TiOx (u-TiOx) bilayer is designed and fabricated as a compact ETL, which restrains the charge recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface and significantly enhances the PSC UV stability. Not only does the introduction of TiOx on top of the C60 film fill the holes or gaps in the C60 film, but also it enhances the surface energy benefiting the growth of perovskite with an intimate contact between the ETL and perovskite, which results in an enhanced perovskite crystallization and a reduced charge recombination at the interface. Both the open-circuit voltage and fill factor were largely improved to obtain a PCE of 19.38% with a rigid device. The highest efficiency 14.74% of a larger-area flexible PSC (1.0 cm2) based on the bilayer was obtained due to the superior homogeneity of the films. More importantly, by eliminating the negative charge accumulation at the perovskite/ETL interface and suppressing the irreversible moisture-driven decomposition of perovskite materials, the C60/u-TiOx bilayer-based PSC shows outstanding stability, retaining 83% and 90% of its initial performance after 312 h UV irradiation and 1000 h exposure to ambient air, respectively.",

However, most lead-free absorber has limited light absorption range as well as poor morphology. In this work, the vertically oriented BiI3 template induced by Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) dopant is intimately integrated with the light-absorbing polymer to form organic-inorganic BiI3/polymer heterojunction absorber in solar cells. Compared with the dopant-free BiI3/polymer, the broaden light absorption of the doped BiI3/polymer enhances the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of device beyond 500 nm, as well as extending EQE edge from 650 nm to 750 nm, which significantly increase the short-circuit current (Jsc) of the device from 1.3 to 3.7 mA cm-2. The polymer top layer is further optimized to improve the charge extraction, which achieved the highest Jsc record (7.8 mA cm-2) of BiI3-based solar cells and efficiency of 1.03 %. Moreover, the encapsulated device shows no degradation after storage in ambient condition for nearly 2 years.",

        "abstract": "A facile inside-out Ostwald ripening route to the morphology-controlled preparation of TiO2 microspheres is developed. Here, TiO2 hollow microspheres (HM) and solid microspheres (SM) are prepared by adjusting the volume ratio of isopropanol (IPA) to acetylacetone (Acac) in the solvothermal process. During the formation process of HM, precipitation of solid cores, subsequent deposition of outer shells on the surface of cores, and simultaneous core dissolution and shell recrystallization are observed, which validate the inside-out Ostwald ripening mechanism. Design and optimization of the properties (pore size, surface area, and trap state) of TiO2 microspheres are vital to the high performance of dyesensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The optimized TiO2 microspheres (rHM and rSM) obtained by post-processing on recrystallization, possess large pore sizes, high surface areas and reduced trap states (Ti3+ and oxygen vacancy), and are thus ideal materials for photovoltaic devices. The power conversion efficiency of DSSCs fabricated using rHM photoanode is 11.22%, which is significantly improved compared with the 10.54% efficiency of the rSM-based DSSC. Our work provides a strategy for synthesizing TiO2 microspheres that simultaneously accommodate different physical properties, in terms of surface area, crystallinity, morphology, and mesoporosity.",

The morphology of the resultant TiO2 micro/nanoarchitectures, along with the micro/nanostructural shape, size and crystallinity, can be controlled by varying the concentration of the reactants. It was found that the formation process of TiO2 hollow microspheres might include the hydrolysis of titanium alkoxide with water from the Mannich reaction, the aggregation of TiO2 nanocrystals, the anisotropic crystal growth, and the Ostwald ripening. In addition, we have performed systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the adsorption energy of ethylenediamine molecules on the exposed surfaces and investigated the formation mechanism of single-crystalline nanocrystals. Furthermore, the three TiO2 micro/nanoarchitectures (SM, HM, and NR) were used as photoanode materials in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and demonstrated improved light harvesting efficiency and electron collection efficiency, which were much greater than conventional TiO2 nanoparticles under the same conditions. Combined with the large specific surface area and high light scattering ability, the HM-based photoanode achieves the highest power conversion efficiency of 10.66%.

        "abstract": "Abstract   TiO 2  submicrospheres were often used as photoanodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) due to the high internal surface area and great scattering properties. However, surface states in TiO 2  submicrospheres limit the electron transport process. In this paper, an investigation of surface states in TiO 2  submicrospheres and traditional TiO 2  nanoparticles was conducted by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The chemical capacitance, electron transport resistance and recombination resistance were interpreted in a consistent framework. The electron transport and recombination behavior were also studied by open-circuit voltage decay measurements (OCVD) and intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS). The results show that the TiO 2  submicrospheres based films possess a larger number of surface states and a shallow energy distribution than TiO 2  nanoparticles under the same film thickness. Furthermore, the fitted data indicate that the electron transport in TiO 2  submicrospheres film was faster than in traditional nanoparticles film owing to their high electron concentration and shallow surface states energy distribution. The discussion highlights the location of surface states in the band gap region of TiO 2  film, which plays an important role in electron transport and charge recombination in DSSCs.",

        "abstract": "Due to its good pore-filling and morphology control, a two-step deposition technique has been widely used in perovskite film preparation. However, the initial PbI2 film used for the two-step deposition method is usually dense, crystalline and layered, leading to a poor quality perovskite film with a certain amount of PbI2 residue, thus resulting in an inferior stability and low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device. In this work, we developed an in situ pre-wetted PbI2 nano-sheet array film to achieve high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite films via a two-step deposition method. By introducing a small amount of hydrogen chloride isopropanol solution (IPA HCl) into the PbI2 precursor solution, an in situ pre-wetted PbI2 nano-sheet array film was obtained, and then a smooth, continuous, uniform, dense, and PbI2-free perovskite film was formed through a reaction with CH3NH3I. After optimization, the device prepared using the in situ pre-wetted PbI2 nano-sheet array film achieved a promising PCE of 19.19%. Moreover, it also had good reproducibility and long term stability, as the devices based on the in situ pre-wetted PbI2 nano-sheet array film retained over 80% of the initial PCE after exposing to ambient air for two months.",

        "abstract": "Owing to their special three-dimensional network structure and high specific surface area, TiO2 submicrospheres have been widely used as electron conductors in photoanodes for solar cells. In recent years, utilization of TiO2 submicrospheres in solar cells has greatly boosted the photovoltaic performance. Inevitably, however, numerous surface states in the TiO2 network affect electron transport. In this work, the surface states in TiO2 submicrospheres were thoroughly investigated by charge extraction methods, and the results were confirmed by the cyclic voltammetry method. The results showed that ammonia can effectively reduce the number of surface states in TiO2 submicrospheres. Furthermore, in-depth characterizations indicate that ammonia shifts the conduction band toward a more positive potential and improves the interfacial charge transfer. Moreover, charge recombination is effectively prevented. Overall, the cell performance is essentially dependent on the effect of the surface states, which affects the electron transfer and recombination process.Open image in new window",

        "abstract": "Surface plasmon resonance using noble metal nanoparticles is regarded as an attractive and viable strategy to improve the optical absorption and/or photocurrent in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). However, no significant improvement in device performance has been observed. The bottleneck is the stability of the noble-metal nanoparticles caused by chemical corrosion. Here, we propose a simple method to synthesize high-performance DSSCs based on polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated Au-TiO2 microspheres that utilize the merits of TiO2 microspheres and promote the coupling of surface plasmons with visible light. When 0.4 wt\u2009% Au nanoparticles were embedded into the TiO2 microspheres, the device achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 10.49%, a 7.9% increase compared with pure TiO2 microsphere-based devices. Simulation results theoretically confirmed that the improvement of the PCE is caused by the enhancement of the absorption cross-section of dye molecules and photocurrent.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Due to the excellent light scattering and dye loading ability, mesoporous TiO 2  microspheres are vastly utilized in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) to serve as photoanode. Despite of the good electron transport properties due to the unique geometry of mesoporous TiO 2  microspheres, the existence of large holes between adjacent microspheres limits the formation of necking and deteriorates the device performance. In this work, we report a simple 2-step process to synthesize symbiotic structured TiO 2  microspheres treated with different ammonia concentrations. Meanwhile, the nitrogen doping of TiO 2  microspheres is also introduced while ammonia treatment is performed and as a result, the charge transport property is greatly improved. By using the symbiotic structured TiO 2  to substitute pure TiO 2  microspheres photo anode, the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs was greatly improved from 8.77% to 9.58%. It is demonstrated that the improvement is mainly due to the improved charge transportation property of symbiotic structured TiO 2  photoanodes and the effective suppression of carrier recombination. The results give us a comprehensive understanding of electron transport and recombination mechanism in mesoporous TiO 2  microspheres, which will provide significant information for the optimization of TiO 2  structures for DSSC and other optoelectrical applications.",

        "abstract": "TiO2 microspheres are of great interest for a great deal of applications, especially in the solar cell field. Because of their unique microstructure and light-scattering effect, TiO2 microsphere-based solar cells often exhibit superior photovoltaic performance. Hence, exploring new suitable TiO2 microspheres for high-efficiency solar cells is essential. In this work, we demonstrate a facile one-pot solvothermal approach for synthesis of TiO2 microspheres using acetone as solvent. The as-prepared TiO2 microspheres are composed of densely interconnected nanocrystals and possess a high specific surface area up to 138.47 m2 g\u20131. As the photoanode, the TiO2 microsphere-based DSSC gives higher dye loading and light adsorption ability as well as longer electron lifetime, resulting in higher short-circuit current value and superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared with Dyesol 18 nm TiO2 nanoparticle paste. Finally, the TiO2 microsphere-based DSSC were optimized by adding a TiO2 nanocrystal underlayer an...",

        "title": "Effects of donors of bodipy dyes on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells",
        "abstract": "Abstract   A new series of donor-acceptor-\u03c0-linker-acceptor (D\u2013A\u2013\u03c0\u2013A) featured organic dyes containing Bodipy derivative as the auxiliary acceptor, furan unit as the \u03c0 conjugated spacer, and 2-cyanoacrylic acid as the anchor group were synthesized and applied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The incorporated electron-withdrawing unit of Bodipy enhances light harvesting by decreasing the molecular energy gap and red-shifting absorption spectra. For comparison, three different arylamine chromophores namely 3-methoxy-9 H -carbazole ( CBZ-B ), triphenylamine ( TPA-B ) and phenoxazine ( POZ-B ) were separately appended onto the 6-position of Bodipy unit to study the effect of the electron donating groups on device performance. The UV\u2013vis absorption spectra, electrochemical properties, density functional theory calculation, photovoltaic properties and electrochemical impedance measurements of DSSCs with these three dyes were systematically investigated. The Bodipy dyes have broad absorption spectra covering the range of 250\u2013700\u00a0nm with the highest molar extinction coefficient up to u003e55\u00a0000\u00a0M \u22121 \u00a0cm \u22121 . The molecular energy level tuning can be conveniently accomplished by alternating the donor moiety. The DSSCs based on  TPA-B  showed the best photovoltaic performance: a maximum monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 70%, a short-circuit photocurrent density ( J   sc  ) of 13.95\u00a0mA\u00a0cm \u22122 , an open-circuit photovoltage ( V   oc  ) of 557\u00a0mV, and a fill factor ( ff ) of 0.61, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 4.76% under standard global AM 1.5G solar light conditions. Our research demonstrates that Bodipy based D\u2013A\u2013\u03c0\u2013A molecular architecture is a highly promising class for the improvement of the performance of DSSCs in the future.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A supramolecular gel electrolyte ( T  gel \u00a0u003e\u00a0100\u00a0\u00b0C) is formed from  N,N \u2032-1,8-octanediylbis-dodecanamide and iodoacetamide as two-component co-gelator, and introduced into the quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (QS-DSSCs). The different morphologies of microscopic network between two-component and single-component gel electrolytes have influence on the diffusion of redox couple in gel electrolytes and further affect the electron kinetic processes in QS-DSSCs. Compared with the single-component gel electrolyte, the two-component gel electrolyte has less compact gel network and weaker steric hindrance effect, which provides more effective charge transport channel for the diffusion of I 3 /I \u2212  redox couple. Meanwhile, the  NH 2  groups of iodoacetamide molecules interact with Li +  and I 3  \u2212 , which also accelerate the transport of I 3  \u2212 /I \u2212  and decrease in the I 3  \u2212  concentration in the TiO 2 /electrolyte interface. As a result, nearly a 12% improvement in short-circuit photocurrent density ( J  sc ) and much higher open circuit potential ( V  oc ) are found in the two-component gel electrolyte based QS-DSSC. Consequently, the QS-DSSC based on the supramolecular gel electrolyte obtains a 17% enhancement in the photoelectric conversion efficiency (7.32%) in comparison with the QS-DSSC based on the single-component gel electrolyte (6.24%). Furthermore, the degradations of these QS-DSSCs are negligible after one sun light soaking with UV cutoff filter at 50\u00a0\u00b0C for 1000\u00a0h.",

        "abstract": "In this work, four D\u2013A\u2013\u03c0\u2013A sensitizers PDPP-I\u2013IV based on pyridine-flanked DPP moieties (PDPP) were designed and synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells. Remarkably, the incorporated electron-withdrawing unit of pyridine-flanked DPP improves the light-harvesting ability and modifies the electrochemical and absorption properties, generating a broader IPCE wavelength responding region. The electrochemical experiments and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements indicate the ability of electron-injection into the TiO2 conductive band from the excited sensitizer. The transient absorption spectra were measured to investigate the feasibility of the dynamics for oxidized-state sensitizer regeneration. The IPCE spectra demonstrate the broad spectral response region of these sensitizers. Especially, the IPCE of PDPP-III reached the near infrared (NIR) region (u003e800 nm) with the highest short-circuit current of 16.17 mA cm\u22122 in these sensitizers. Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments suggest that the electron-lifetime and charge recombination resistance increased when attaching the stereo substituted groups (R2) on the PDPP moiety, resulting in a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc). It can be found that PDPP-II based DSSCs with liquid electrolyte exhibited the highest Voc (523 mV) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.26%.",

        "abstract": "Accurate forecasting of short-term wind speed is a key technology to enable efficient and reliable operation of microgrids with wind generators. Results of wind speed prediction (WSP) methods in the current literature are subject to errors due to the random nature of wind speed and the limited generalization of forecast algorithms. In this paper, a short-term WSP method based on a model of forecast, error correction, wind power generation, support vector machines (SVMs), and prediction algorithms is proposed. In the proposed method, the error model is built to predict the errors of the original predicted wind speed. Subsequently, the predicted errors are incorporated into the original predicted sequence to produce the final forecasts. The final predicted results can be brought to the system operator step by step for use in scheduling strategies. Using SVM and back propagation (BP) prediction algorithm as examples for the basic prediction algorithm, the proposed method is applied to a day-ahead WSP with five daily deliveries and compared with the results by a single SVM or a BP prediction algorithm. The test results demonstrate significant improvement in prediction accuracy using the proposed short-term WSP based on a model of forecast error correction method, independent of the basic prediction algorithm.",

Considering the differences of initial state of charge (SOC) and the inherent randomness in charge/discharge demands from the various EVs connected to the MMC, it becomes challenging to control the MMC in order to satisfy the network and EV fleet requirements. This paper proposes a multi-objective power management strategy for a MMC-Based EV fleet to be integrated into the smart grid using a virtual SOC model and coordinated control of the power flow among the arms of the same and different phase-units by taking advantage of circulation current. The model of the MMC-based EV fleet system is developed in MATLAB/Simulink and simulation results show that the multi-objectives of differential charging/discharging power control and interactive power management between EVs and utility can be effectively realized, while the three-phase output power of MMC is kept in balance and circulation current is controlled, thus, mitigating the negative impact of large-scale application of EVs on the utility grid.",

In order to address the mentioned control objectives, this paper proposes a multi-objective power management strategy for MMC-Based EV fleet to be integrated into smart grid friendly based on virtual SOC model. A MMC-based EV fleet system model is established in Matlab/Simulink to verify the availability and feasibility of the proposed system and multi-objective power management strategy. The results show the proposed strategy is able to realize the charging/discharging power differential control and interactive power management between EVs and utility as well as to reduce the negative impact of large-scale application of EVs on utility.",

The charging/discharging power differential control strategy considering EV usersu0027 requirements in the same arm has been proposed in the previous work. However, it is also important that the balance among the power of three phase-units should be met up with meanwhile circulation current should be controlled to ensure the system operation stably. This paper proposes the control strategy of balancing power among three phase-units for MMC-Based EV fleet integrated into smart grid based on virtual SOC concept to realize the control objectives considering both EV usersu0027 requirements and utility demands. In addition, a circulation current suppressor is designed for contributing to the power balance control. Detailed system structure and control scheme are presented and a MMC-based EV integration system model is established in Matlab/Simulink to verify that the power of three phase-units can be controlled differentially considering both EV usersu0027 requirements and utility demands without affecting the output powers and currents waveforms of the system and the circulation current can be restrained.",

On basis of instantaneous power theory of Current Source Inverter (CSI) under unbalanced grid voltage condition, this paper proposes a novel Quasi Direct Power Control (QDPC) strategy which adopts proportional resonant (PR) controller in \u03b1\u03b2 stationary frame. Compared with conventional control methods in dq rotating frame, the proposed method can eliminate the fluctuation of DC-link current and realize unity power factor without decoupling control or rotating transformation.

However, due to the particularity of EV, the optimal design of the main parameters of power stage, such as the ACu0026DC voltage level and the cascaded module number of each arm and alike, is important to the safe and reliable operation of the system. Based on the multi-objective power management strategy, the optimal design criteria for main parameters including MMC modulation index, maximum arm current and peak charging power coefficient are put forward to obtain the security region for system operation in this paper. Detailed optimal configuration process is discussed. And a medium-sized MMC-EVIS model with rated power of 480kW, 1kV AC voltage and 48 EVs is developed in Matlab/Simulink. Simulation results indicate that the system parameter optimization is reasonable and necessary, which provides a reference for the construction and operation of the MMC-EVIS.",

        "abstract": "Because effective influencers in an online social network (OSN) can significantly affect consumers' purchasing decisions via trust among users in electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) marketing, identifying these influencers with respect to user trust relationships has become increasingly important. However, many existing studies overlook the domain attribute of trust and the time-varying nature of social networks and only analyze a static snapshot of a user trust network (UTN). To address these issues and investigate this topic in the e-commerce context, this study proposes a research framework that takes into account the dimensions of trust, domain, and time. A time-varying hypergraph is developed to model the OSN using the time-varying features of multi-type relationships, and an algorithm is developed to extract a domain-aware UTN based on the time-varying hypergraph and user trust relationships. Reinforced by the dimensions of trust, domain, and time, a novel product review domain-aware (PRDA) approach is conceived that identifies effective influencers and categorizes them into three types, i.e., emerging influencers, holding influencers, and vanishing influencers, based on their popularity status across the life cycle. The experimental results from the Epinions dataset show that the PRDA approach outperforms both the social network-based influence-evaluating approach and the \\\"popular author\\\" approach.",

In this study, we propose a novel behavioral scoring model based on a mixture survival analysis framework to predict the dynamic probability of default over time in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. A random forest is utilized to identify whether a borrower will default, and a random survival forest is introduced to model the time to default. The results of an empirical analysis on a Chinese P2P loan dataset show that the proposed  ensemble mixture random forest  (EMRF) has a better performance in terms of predicting the monthly dynamic probability of default, while compared with standard mixture cure model, Cox proportional hazards model and logistic regression. It is also concluded that the proposed EMRF model provides a meaningful output for timely post-loan risk management.",

        "abstract": "Predicting whether a borrower will default on a loan is of significant concern to platforms and investors in online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. Because the data types online platforms use are complex and involve unstructured information such as text, which is difficult to quantify and analyze, loan default prediction faces new challenges in P2P. To this end, we propose a default prediction method for P2P lending combined with soft information related to textual description. We introduce a topic model to extract valuable features from the descriptive text concerning loans and construct four default prediction models to demonstrate the performance of these features for default prediction. Moreover, a two-stage method is designed to select an effective feature set containing both soft and hard information. An empirical analysis using real-word data from a major P2P lending platform in China shows that the proposed method can improve loan default prediction performance compared with existing methods based only on hard information.",

Thus, a large number of reviews available on social media become an effective information source for quality management. In this study, we attempt to identify reviews that are helpful from the perspective of total quality management, called Helpful Quality-related Reviews (HQRs). First, we propose a definition and taxonomy of HQRs based on attractive quality theory. Then, we construct a Helpful Quality-related Review Identification (HQRI) model to mitigate the information overload represented by social media reviews. The HQRI model incorporates an imbalanced data classification method and a multi-label classification method based on the characteristics of HQRs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the HQRI model in terms of six performance metrics in comparison with three state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we employ the Latent Dirichlet Allocatio...",

However, because helpful quality-related reviews may involve various aspects of product quality, previous studies confusing these aspects cannot provide targeted information regarding different aspects of product quality and production system improvement. In this paper, we propose a method of multi-class classification for helpful quality-related reviews corresponding to different aspects of product quality and production systems. Furthermore, the efficient and accurate identification of helpful quality-related reviews remains a critical challenge because of the sparseness of such reviews, which significantly influences classifier performance. To address these problems, we develop a model for the identification of helpful reviews called Helpful Quality-related Review Mining (HQRM) that incorporates a multi-class classification architecture and imbalanced data classification method...",

        "abstract": "Online word-of-mouth (eWOM) disseminated on social media contains a considerable amount of important information that can predict sales. However, the accuracy of sales prediction models using big data on eWOM is still unsatisfactory. We argue that eWOM contains the heat and sentiments of product dimensions, which can improve the accuracy of prediction models based on multiattribute attitude theory. In this paper, we propose a dynamic topic analysis (DTA) framework to extract the heat and sentiments of product dimensions from big data on eWOM. Ultimately, we propose an autoregressive heat-sentiment (ARHS) model that integrates the heat and sentiments of dimensions into the benchmark predictive model to forecast daily sales. We conduct an empirical study of the movie industry and confirm that the ARHS model is better than other models in predicting movie box-office revenues. The robustness check with regard to predicting opening-week revenues based on a back-propagation neural network also suggests that the heat and sentiments of dimensions can improve the accuracy of sales predictions when the machine-learning method is used.",

Previously, it was proved that LWE with one equation (first-is-errorless LWE) can be made as hard as the standard \\(\\hbox {LWE}_{n,q,\\chi }\\), given a large lattice dimension n. We show that the some-are-errorless LWE problem can also be made equivalently hard as long as n is big enough and \\(n \\gg l\\) (A similar conclusion was given using fuzzy extrators by Fuller). A second work in this paper is to construct a multi-key secure multi-party computation (SMC) protocol, whose security relies on LWE and the some-are-errorless LWE problem in semi-honest and semi-malicious environments assuming the common random string model. We study the Gentry\u2013Sahai\u2013Waters (GSW13) fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme and its key homomorphism, which is essential for the construction of our multi-key SMC protocol. The proposed protocol naturally constitutes a multi-key FHE scheme in the same settings. Finally, we show the excellence of the proposed SMC protocol in time and space complexity by comparisons with existing relative schemes.",

        "abstract": "The connected vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) and cloud computing technology allows entities in VANET to enjoy the advantageous storage and computing services offered by some cloud service provider. However, the advantages do not come free, since their combination brings many new security and privacy requirements for VANET applications. In this paper, we investigate the cloud-based road condition monitoring (RCoM) scenario, where the authority needs to monitor real-time road conditions with the help of a cloud server so that it could make sound responses to emergency cases timely. When some bad road condition is detected, e.g., some geologic hazard or accident happens, vehicles on site are able to report such information to a cloud server engaged by the authority. We focus on addressing three key issues in RCoM. First, the vehicles have to be authorized by some roadside unit before generating a road condition report in the domain and uploading it to the cloud server. Second, to guarantee the privacy against the cloud server, the road condition information should be reported in ciphertext format, which requires that the cloud server should be able to distinguish the reported data from different vehicles in ciphertext format for the same place without compromising their confidentiality. Third, the cloud server and authority should be able to validate the report source, i.e., to check whether the road conditions are reported by legitimate vehicles. To address these issues, we present an efficient RCoM scheme, analyze its efficiency theoretically, and demonstrate the practicality through experiments.",

This scheme supports fine-grained cum flexible access control along with Query-Response mechanism to enable users to efficiently retrieve desired data from cloud servers. In addition, the scheme should support considerable flexibility to revoke system privileges from users without updating the key client, it reduces the pressure of the client greatly. Finally, security analysis illustrates that the scheme can resist collusion attack. A comparison of the performance from existing CP-ABE scheme, indicates that our scheme reduces the computation cost greatly for users.",

The Lane Departure Warning system is one of the most important parts of ADAS. However, fast and stable lane marking detection is the precondition of it under complex background. In this paper, we proposed a new lane detection method through birdu0027s eye view and improved RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithm based on the inspiration that extraction of road features from remote sensed images. According to the birdu0027s eye view of the road image, we can recognize the line marking through Progressive Probabilistic Hough transform instead of lane detection. Then, the detected lines are grouped by a new distance-based weighting scheme and we can get the fields of candidate lanes. For each of the fields, lanes are refined through improved RANSAC algorithm and fitted by double models. Hence, the road orientation can be predicted by the curvature and straight lineu0027s slope. At last, our experimental results indicated that the lane detection algorithm has good robustness and real-time under various road environment.",

A new secure outsourcing of modular exponentiations scheme is proposed under this model. In this scheme, a new logical split method about modular exponentiation is put forward. The modular exponentiation is divided into several parts and a random value is kept for verification. The exponent and the base of modular exponentiations are keeping privacy in the process of outsourcing. The computational burden for users in the process of outsourcing is small, and the users can verify the results with high checkability.",

In this paper, we attempt to answer the fundamental question of \u201chow much information regarding the dynamic property of the original time series can be extracted from these networks.\u201d To this end, we propose a new method for reconstructing time series from the networks. We compare the reconstructed time series from these networks and that from the recurrence plot. We find that these networks contain topological information of the embedded time series to a certain degree. In general, they are more powerful than the recurrence plot method in the reconstruction of embedded time series. In addition, we study a new generalized projective synchronization (GPS) of coupled complex dynamical networks with different sizes via feedback control and impulsive control. Based on the stability analysis of impulsive system, a network synchronization criterion is established. These works may find potential application for secure communication via networks.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, it is very popular to make friends, share photographs, and exchange news throughout social networks. Social networks widely expand the area of people\u2019s social connections and make communication much smoother than ever before. In a social network, there are many social groups established based on common interests among persons, such as learning group, family group, and reading group. People often describe their profiles when registering as a user in a social network. Then social networks can organize these users into groups of friends according to their profiles. However, an important issue must be considered, namely many users\u2019 sensitive profiles could have been leaked out during this process. Therefore, it is reasonable to design a privacy-preserving friends-finding protocol in social network. Toward this goal, we design a fuzzy interest matching protocol based on private set intersection. Concretely, two candidate users can first organize their profiles into sets, then use Bloom filters to generate new data structures, and finally find the intersection sets to decide whether being friends or not in the social network. The protocol is shown to be secure in the malicious model and can be useful for practical purposes.",

Therefore, through modifying the re-linearization technique proposed by the above scheme, a technique called non-matrix key switching is presented, which includes key switching with re-linearization and pure key switching. The complex matrix operations of existing key switching technique are removed. Combining this technique with modulus switching, a (leveled) fully homomorphic encryption scheme without bootstrapping from LWE is constructed. In order to make circuit layer structure clear, the scheme gives detailed refresh door operation. Finally, we use bootstrapping to upgrade arithmetic circuit to any layer, and make the homomorphic computing capability of the scheme have nothing to circuit depth.",

        "abstract": "Identifying the most influential spreaders in complex networks is crucial for optimally using the network structure and designing efficient strategies to accelerate information dissemination or prevent epidemic outbreaks. In this paper, by taking into account the centrality of a node and its neighbors\u2019 centrality which depends on the diffusion importance of links, we propose a novel influence measure, the weight neighborhood centrality, to quantify the spreading ability of nodes in complex networks. To evaluate the performance of our method, we use the Susceptible\u2013Infected\u2013Recovered (SIR) model to simulate the epidemic spreading process on six real-world networks and four artificial networks. By measuring the rank imprecision and the rank correlation between the rank lists generated by simulation results via SIR and the ones generated by centrality measures, it shows that in general the weight neighborhood centrality can rank the spreading ability of nodes more accurately than its benchmark centrality, especially when using the degree k or coreness ks as the benchmark centrality. Further, we compare the monotonicity and the computational complexity of different ranking methods, which show that our method not only can be better at distinguishing the spreading ability of nodes but also can be used in large-scale networks due to the high computation efficiency.",

        "abstract": "When executing a program or storing data in a medical Internet of Things (mIoT) system, physical side-channels analysis, such as recent-timing, cold-reboot, and virtual-machine attacks, might obtain partial information about internal sensitive medical data/states in memory that the attacker can gain partial privacy information. Leakage-resilient cryptography has led to better implementation of many cryptographic primitives that can be proven secure against attackers who can obtain limited sensitive information about  private keys ,  randomness , and other  internal states , and therefore prevents from breaking the security. In this paper, to tolerate the sensitive information leakage in mIoT, we first present a leakage-resilient public-key encryption mechanism that is semantically secure against adaptively chosen-ciphertext attacks in the presence of key leakage under standard decisional Diffie\u2013Hellman assumption. Our construction employs a special universal hashing in multiplicative group to provide an efficient strong extractor, and a key derivation function to derive one or more symmetric keys from a single value. Also, the plaintext space of the scheme is extended to the full domain field of group so as to provide a larger space for the message. We emphasis that our scheme can be deployed in mIoT since the limited power and energy budgets, the communication and computation cost, and the leakage attack are taken into account. Using the first scheme as a building block, we also give a protocol construction to achieve the security resilient to randomness leakage and key leakage. Our schemes feature with a shorter key size and a larger plaintext space. Concretely, the private-key contains only four elements in the finite field, and the allowable key-leakage rate is 25%, which provides a higher leakage rate than Naor Segev (leakage rate is 16.7%) and its variants. It is worth highlighting of the construction resilient to both key leakage and randomness leakage, simultaneously, and is flexible to deploy in easy-to-attack outdoor nodes such as in medical IoT and smart grids, since in these nodes the private keys and randomness are either stored or generated in outdoor privacy-aware environments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Bitcoin has recently received considerable attentions in both academia and industrial areas. It is an appealing anonymous electronic cash system-based peer-to-peer computer networks and does not rely on any centralized trusted authority. The Bitcoin is associated with a public/secret key pair where the security key is only known by its Bitcoin account owner. It is usually hosted on some platform and can only be spent after its owner and the platform sign on it. In this paper, we investigate how to jointly manage the Bitcoin trading when the Bitcoin account is possessed by multiple participants and how to simultaneously guarantee the anonymity of the multiple owners. We first consider the scenario where a single dealer possesses the Bitcoin account but authorizes multiple participants to jointly manage it. For instance, a company authorizes its several departments to manage its account. We next consider the scenario where the Bitcoin account is shared by some peers, e.g., joint investigators each of whom independent possesses a part of the account. The main challenge is that the signers are uncertain in different transactions. We propose partially blind threshold signatures with uncertain signers and their extensions to address this challenge. Analysis shows that our proposals are secure and efficient.",

In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme that supports any monotone access structures and show its unforgeability and robustness under the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption in the standard model. For 192-bit security, its secret key shares and signature fragments are as short as 511 bits and 1022 bits, which are shorter than existing schemes assuming random oracle. We then propose two extensions. The first one allows new participants to dynamically join the system without any help from the dealer. The second one supports a type of multipartite access structures, where the participant set is divided into multiple disjoint groups, and each group is bounded so that a distributed signature cannot be generated unless a pre-defined number of participants from multiple groups work together. Finally, we present a fully distributed signature scheme such that the centralized trusted dealer can be removed from the system, and the secret keys (shares) can be jointly computed by the involved participants. We propose a CDH-based distributed signature scheme in the standard model.We provide two extensions of the basic distributed signature scheme.We propose a distributed key generation protocol over bilinear group.We provide a CDH-based fully distributed signature scheme in the standard model.",

        "abstract": "We introduce the concept of optimistic fair exchange of distributed signatures (OFEDS) which allows two groups of parties to fairly exchange digital signatures. Specifically, an authorized set of parties from each group can jointly take part in the protocol on behalf of the affiliated group to fulfill obligation, and a semi-trusted arbitrator will intervene in the protocol only when there are disputes between two sides. Our OFEDS extends the functionality of optimistic fair exchange of threshold signatures to a more generic case. We formalize the security model of OFEDS, in which besides the standard security requirements for existing optimistic fair exchange protocols, robustness is incorporated so that OFEDS can be successfully performed even when there exist some dishonest signers. We propose a non-interactive construction of OFEDS based on the well-established Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption. Our proposal shows that there exists CDH-based OFEDS for any general monotone access structure. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate our OFEDS construction has reasonable efficiency for real applications. We model optimistic fair exchange between two groups.We define security in optimistic fair exchange of distributed signatures (OFEDS).OFEDS supports most generic access structure.The first OFEDS scheme is presented with robustness and non-interactive properties.Our scheme is proven secure under standard assumption.",

        "abstract": "Proxy re-encryption (PRE) enables an authorized proxy to convert a ciphertext under Alice's public key into a ciphertext under Bob's public key without exposing the encrypted message. In existing PRE systems, the original ciphertexts and the re-encrypted ones are both required to be in the same cryptosystem, which limits their applications in cloud computing systems. In this paper, we propose a new proxy re-encryption pattern, referred to as an identity-based proxy re-encryption version 2 (IBPRE2). It allows an authorized proxy to convert a ciphertext of an identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) scheme into a ciphertext of an identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme. With IBPRE2, one can take advantage of IBBE to securely share data with a set of recipients, and then incorporate an additional one into the authorized set through the re-encryption mechanism, without decrypting the IBBE ciphertext nor leaking any sensitive information. We formalize the security requirements in IBPRE2 and propose a provably CCA-secure scheme. The unique feature of ciphertext transformation from a complicated cryptosystem to a simple one makes our IBPRE2 a versatile cryptographic tool to secure outsourced data in cloud computing. We propose a framework of identity-based proxy re-encryption (IBPRE2) system for cloud computing.We formally define the CCA (chosen-ciphertext attack) security of the IBPRE2.We construct an IBPRE2 scheme and prove its CCA-security assuming that the underlying cryptographic primitives are secure.",

        "abstract": "A Public Key Cryptosystem (PKC) is a fundamental tool to protect data security. Most PKC schemes involve complicated operations, e.g., modular exponentiations, which are expensive for cloud environment where enormous data are collected from capability-limited devices, e.g., wireless sensors, mobile phones and tablets. To address this problem, this paper investigate how to reduce the laborious computations of a large number of exponentiations in public key encryption and decryption systems. Firstly, we propose algorithms to speed up batch multi-exponentiation in different configurations. Our algorithms improve the existing multi-exponentiation and batch single-base exponentiations by allowing a large number of multi-base exponentiations to be processed in batch. Secondly, we build a batch PKC scheme from the famous Cramer-Shoup cryptosystem by allowing batch encryption and batch decryption. For batch encryption, we exploit our proposed batch multi-exponentiation approach so that multiple messages can be encrypted in batch to reduce the computation overhead; and for batch decryption, we further incorporate techniques derived from batch signature verification so that the received ciphertexts can be decrypted in batch. We conduct thorough theoretical and experimental performance analysis of the proposed batch cryptosystem. The analyses show that the batch multi-exponentiation algorithms greatly accelerate calculation speed of the Cramer-Shoup system, compared with the naive implementations with existing multi-exponentiation approaches, by more than 40% in encryption and 80% in decryption. We also provide optimal batch size configurations in the case that some ciphertexts are erroneous. This work will help make PKC towards practical applications in the cloud environment. We propose a Basic Batch Multi-exponentiation algorithm and a Simultaneous Batch Multi-exponentiation algorithm.We propose batch public-key encryption and decryption.We conduct extensive experiments on the proposal.",

        "abstract": "Bitcoin has recently received considerable attentions in both academia and industrial areas. It is an appealing anonymous electronic cash system-based peer-to-peer computer networks and does not rely on any centralized trusted authority. The Bitcoin is associated with a public/secret key pair where the security key is only known by its Bitcoin account owner. It is usually hosted on some platform and can only be spent after its owner and the platform sign on it. In this paper, we investigate how to jointly manage the Bitcoin trading when the Bitcoin account is possessed by multiple participants and how to simultaneously guarantee the anonymity of the multiple owners. We first consider the scenario where a single dealer possesses the Bitcoin account but authorizes multiple participants to jointly manage it. For instance, a company authorizes its several departments to manage its account. We next consider the scenario where the Bitcoin account is shared by some peers, e.g., joint investigators each of whom independent possesses a part of the account. The main challenge is that the signers are uncertain in different transactions. We propose partially blind threshold signatures with uncertain signers and their extensions to address this challenge. Analysis shows that our proposals are secure and efficient.",

        "abstract": "Cloud computing and cluster computing are user-centric computing services. The shared software and hardware resources and information can be provided to the computers and other equipments according to the demands of users. A majority of services are deployed through outsourcing. Outsourcing computation allows resource-constrained clients to outsource their complex computation workloads to a powerful server which is rich of computation resources. Modular exponentiation is one of the most complex computations in public key based cryptographic schemes. It is useful to reduce the computation cost of the clients by using outsourcing computation. In this paper, we propose a novel outsourcing algorithm for modular exponentiation based on the new mathematical division under the setting of two non-colluding cloud servers. The base and the power of the outsourced data can be kept private and the efficiency is improved compared with former works.",

Field tests of a 4-in.-diameter module with activated methyldiethanolamine (aMDEA) solvent demonstrated greater than 90% CO 2  removal. The mass transfer coefficient in the absorption step was 1.2 (s) \u22121 , which is over an order of magnitude greater than that of conventional column contactors. The membrane module was further scaled up from 4\u00a0in. to 8\u00a0in. diameter (a factor of 3 increase in membrane area). Single-gas permeation measurements indicated that 8-in. modules have an intrinsic CO 2  permeance as high as 2150\u20132670 GPU. One 8-in.-diameter module was tested in membrane contactor mode for CO 2  capture using a simulated flue gas. Carbon dioxide removal rate of 91.3% was achieved with a mass transfer coefficient of 1.5 (s) \u22121 . Parametric tests indicated CO 2  flux and capture rate increased with increasing feed pressure, solvent flow velocity and solvent temperature. PEEK hollow fiber membrane contactor is effective in capturing CO 2  from low CO 2 -concentration feeds, showing its high potential for coal or natural gas flue gas CO 2  capture.",

        "abstract": "Soil represents the largest terrestrial organic carbon pool. To address global climate change, it is essential to explore the soil organic carbon storage patterns and their controlling factors. We investigated the soil organic carbon density (SOCD) in 48 grassland sites along the Eurasian steppe eastern transect (ESET) region, which covers the Inner Mongolia grassland subregion and Mongolia grasslands subregion. Specifically, we analyzed the SOCD in the top 30 cm soil layer and its relationships with climatic variables, soil texture, grazing intensity and community biomass productivity. The results showed that the average SOCD of the ESET was 4.74 kg/m2, and the SOCD of the Inner Mongolia grassland subregion (4.11 kg/m2) was significantly lower than that of the Mongolia grassland subregion (5.79 kg/m2). Significant negative relationships were found between the SOCD and the mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP) and grazing intensity in the ESET region. The MAT and grazing intensity were identified as the major factors influencing the SOCD in the ESET region; the MAP and MAT were the major factors influencing the SOCD in the Inner Mongolia grassland subregion; and the MAT and soil pH were the major factors influencing the SOCD in the Mongolia grassland subregion.",

        "abstract": "Stipa grandis P. Smirn. is a dominant plant species in the typical steppe of the Xilingole Plateau of Inner Mongolia. Selection of suitable reference genes for the quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is important for gene expression analysis and research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the stress responses of S. grandis. In the present study, 15 candidate reference genes (EF1 beta, ACT, GAPDH, SamDC, CUL4, CAP, SNF2, SKIP1, SKIP5, SKIP11, UBC2, UBC15, UBC17, UCH, and HERC2) were evaluated for their stability as potential reference genes for qRT-PCR under different stresses. Four algorithms were used: GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. The results showed that the most stable reference genes were different under different stress conditions: EF1beta and UBC15 during drought and salt stresses; ACT and GAPDH under heat stress; SKIP5 and UBC17 under cold stress; UBC15 and HERC2 under high pH stress; UBC2 and UBC15 under wounding stress; EF1beta and UBC17 under jasmonic acid treatment; UBC15 and CUL4 under abscisic acid treatment; and HERC2 and UBC17 under salicylic acid treatment. EF1beta and HERC2 were the most suitable genes for the global analysis of all samples. Furthermore, six target genes, SgPOD, SgPAL, SgLEA, SgLOX, SgHSP90 and SgPR1, were selected to validate the most and least stable reference genes under different treatments. Our results provide guidelines for reference gene selection for more accurate qRT-PCR quantification and will promote studies of gene expression in S. grandis subjected to environmental stress.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Studying the changes in nutrient use strategies induced by grazing can provide insight into the process of grassland degradation and is important for improving grassland quality and enhancing ecosystem function. Dominant species in meadow steppe can optimize their use of limiting resources; however, the regulation of nutrient use strategies across grazing gradients is not fully understood. Therefore, in this study, we report an  in situ  study in which the impact of grazing rates on nutrient use strategies of  Leymus chinensis,  the dominant plant species in eastern Eurasian temperate steppes, was investigated. We conducted a large randomized controlled experiment (conducted continuously for five years in grassland plots in a natural pasture in Hailar, eastern Mongolia Plateau, China) to assess the effects of grazing rate treatments (0.00, 0.23, 0.34, 0.46, 0.69, and 0.92 adult cattle unit (AU) ha \u22121 ) on  L. chinensis  along a grazing gradient and employed a random sampling approach to compare the accumulation, allocation, and stoichiometry of C, N, and P in leaves and stems. Our findings demonstrated the follows: (i) The height of L.  chinensis  decreased with an increase in the grazing gradient, and the concentrations of C, N, and P significantly increased; (ii) the accumulation of C, N, and P per individual was negatively correlated with the concentration of aboveground tissues, suggesting that there was a tradeoff in L.  chinensis  between nutrient accumulation and concentration at the individual scale; (iii) the leaf-to-stem ratio of C, N, and P accumulation increased with grazing intensity, indicating a tradeoff in nutrient allocation and plant size at the individual plant level; and (iv) grazing rates were negatively correlated with the ratios of C:N and C:P in the stem; however, these ratios in leaves significantly increased with grazing intensity. Our findings suggest that L.  chinensis  in meadow steppe adapts to grazing disturbance through tradeoffs between plant size and nutrient use strategies. Moreover, our results imply that grazing produces a compensatory effect on nutrient use efficiency between the stems and leaves of  L. chinensis.",

        "abstract": "Understanding changes in topsoil water balance induced by grazing is of great interest for both theoretical and applied reasons. It can elucidate the processes involved in grassland degradation and is of practical importance to enhancing ecosystem functions. Unfortunately, the lack of studies on how litter and soil in grazed grassland affect soil water evaporation leaves a major gap in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying water availability and vegetation dynamics. Here, we report controlled experiments conducted to determine the impact of long-term overgrazing on topsoil water-retention capacity and evaporation rates in semiarid grasslands. Additional consideration is given to grassland ecosystem composition (i.e., litter, soil structure, and presence of plant roots). The data used correspond to typical steppe ecosystems in Inner Mongolia, northern China, where the grassland utilization consists of long-term grazing and long-term enclosure (since the 1980s). We examined soil from grazed and ungrazed land under three experimental treatments (litter exclusion, structural soil damage, and root exclusion) and a control treatment (undisturbed soil). Water capacity of the grassland soil decreased significantly (by 23.53%) after long-term overgrazing. Litter exclusion, structural soil damage, and root exclusion, however, had no effects on water-retaining capacity compared with undisturbed soil. Additionally, long-term-grazed soil had significantly lower water-retaining capacity compared with ungrazed soil. Litter exclusion, soil damage, and root exclusion significantly increased evaporation rates relative to undisturbed soil. Relative to the litter treatment, soil structure and roots had reduced effects on water-retaining capacity. The relative evaporation rate was significantly increased by temperature and wind speed and decreased by relative humidity. However, of all external meteorological factors, temperature most strongly governed grassland soil water evaporation. Overall, the combined effects of overgrazing and climate warming on soil water evaporation will accelerate soil water loss in grassland regions. This has significant implications for the management of degraded grasslands.",

        "title": "Patterns of herders\u2019 adaptation to changes in social\u2013ecological systems across northern China\u2019s grasslands over the past three decades",
        "abstract": "Understanding the changes in herders\u2019 adaptation to environmental change can provide insight into humans\u2019 adaptive mechanisms to different social\u2013ecological systems, and is also important for the optimal management of grasslands. However, the existing and emerging patterns of herders\u2019 adaptation to changes in social\u2013ecological systems across different types of grasslands are poorly understood. This paper presents a systematic participatory investigation that was conducted to comprehensively understand herders\u2019 adaptation in this context over the past three decades. Three counties in Inner Mongolia grasslands were selected as the case study sites, located in meadow steppe, typical steppe and desert steppe respectively. Our results indicate that herders\u2019 perceptions partly fit with the reality of the actual changes. The majority of herders attributed their pasture\u2019s quality degradation to reduced precipitation rather than overgrazing, a contradictory perception to previous scientific observations (overgrazing\u2009u003e\u2009climate change). Moreover, herders\u2019 behaviour in relation to herbage storage and livestock structure had dramatically changed in terms of spatial and temporal patterns in Inner Mongolia, which benefited herders in production efficiency. Lambing time of sheep and goats occurred earlier than it did several decades ago across the three grassland types. This was attributed to a rise in temperature, increasing marketisation and developing infrastructure. In addition, there became evident a transformation in the animal husbandry production cycle from a two-year to one-year cycle. Our results highlighted that the transformation of herders\u2019 behavioural strategies resulted from variations in spatial and temporal patterns of climate change, pasture degradation, new policies and marketisation in pastoral areas. These strategies can be seen as key mechanisms in long-term adaptation to changes in social\u2013ecological systems, which benefit herders\u2019 efficiency in grassland management.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the carbon storage is necessary to understand how grassland ecosystems would respond to natural and anthropogenic disturbances under different management strategies. Carbon storage was investigated in aboveground biomass, litter, roots and soil organic matter (SOM) in eight sites that were floristically and topographically similar, but had been subjected to different years of grazing exclusion and different grazing intensities. The primary objective of this study was to ascertain the effect of different grazing management regimes on carbon storage in the typical steppe ecosystem of China. The results revealed that the total carbon stored in aboveground biomass, litter, roots and SOM (the top 100cm soil layer) varied from 9.29 to 18.51 kg m2. Over 94% of the carbon stored in the SOM, with minor storage in other pools. Soil carbon storage decreased substantially with grazing intensity and the six years of grazing exclusion had a higher storage than 32 and 15 years grazing exclusion. The carbon storage trend observed in these treatments suggests that moderate grazing as well as mowing can improve the carbon sequestration and the longer fencing year is not better for carbon accumulation of typical steppe in China.",

Conversely,  showed increased leaf and stem growth, but suffered nutrient and biomass loss as a result of excessive foraging by livestock, which severely affected its ability to colonize. Root enzymes coupled with soil nutrients can regulate plant nutrients and stoichiometric ratios as an adaptive response to grazing. Thus, we demonstrated that stoichiometric ratios allow species to better withstand grazing disturbances. This study provides a new understanding of the mechanisms involved in grazing-resistance within a plant-soil system.",

The research explored the different effects of mowing and grazing on organic carbon, total nitrogen, available nitrogen, total phosphorus and available phosphorus in rhizosphere and bulk soil. The results showed that: Both mowing and grazing inhibited assemble and storage capacity of rhizosphere, and decreased the organic carbon, total nitrogen, and available nitrogen contents in rhizosphere soil. The rhizosphere effect on total phosphorus in soil was found to be insignificant because of its high immobility. Available phosphorus in soil was distributed heterogeneously. Available soil phosphorus under mowing and grazing changed but the difference was not significant between rhizosphere and bulk soil. Grazing drastically reduced the number of soil microbes. The availability of soil nutrients was significantly correlated with soil microbial numbers. The status of soil nutrients could be more closely aligned with the change in bacteria and fungi. Grazing brought about greater soil nutrient loss and soil microbe loss than did mowing.",

        "abstract": "Climate change has significant effects on primary productivity and ecosystem function. To assess these effects in the Inner Mongolia Plateau of China, we analysed the 8 km normalized difference vegetation index NDVI time-series from the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling System GIMMS data set and characterized vegetation productivity between 1981 and 2011. We used canonical correspondence analysis CCA to elucidate the relationship between productivity and climatic factors for different vegetation types and model the response of productivity to climate change. We found the following. 1 Productivity in the study area exhibits high spatial heterogeneity while generally decreasing from northeast to southwest, which is mainly driven by precipitation patterns. 2 Most of the total variation 88.35% of NDVI can be explained by precipitation and temperature. Around 46.19% of the total variation is explained solely by precipitation, 31.85% by temperature, and 10.31% by the precipitation and temperature interaction term. 3 Productivity of most ecosystems of the area increased gradually between 1981 and 2011. The central region of the Plateau is characterized by the high annual coefficient of variation CV of NDVI, which is mainly attributable to the desert steppe, the most sensitive ecosystem of the area. 4 Climate factors influence primary productivity differently in different vegetation zones of our study area. Primary productivity of forest and agricultural areas is explained mainly by temperature and steppe vegetation by precipitation. Desert vegetation is closely related to both precipitation and temperature. Not only did the study quantitatively assess the effects of climate changes on primary production, but it also provided an important basis for a comprehensive analysis of climate change on ecosystem function in the Inner Mongolia Plateau.",

However, the relative importance of taxonomic diversity and functional characteristics (including functional dominance and functional diversity) in maintaining community productivity and the underlying mechanisms (including selection and complementarity effects) of the relationship between diversity and community productivity have been widely controversial. In this study, 194 sites were surveyed in five grassland types along a precipitation gradient in the Inner Mongolia grassland of China. The relationships between taxonomic diversity (species richness and the Shannon-Weaver index), functional dominance (the community-weighted mean of four plant traits), functional diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy), and community aboveground biomass were analyzed. The results showed that (1) taxonomic diversity, functional dominance, functional diversity, and community aboveground biomass all increased from low to high precipitation grassland types; (2) there were significant positive linear relationships between taxonomic diversity, functional dominance, functional diversity, and community aboveground biomass; (3) the effect of functional characteristics on community aboveground biomass is greater than that of taxonomic diversity; and (4) community aboveground biomass depends on the community-weighted mean plant height, which explained 57.1% of the variation in the community aboveground biomass. Our results suggested that functional dominance rather than taxonomic diversity and functional diversity mainly determines community productivity and that the selection effect plays a dominant role in maintaining the relationship between biodiversity and community productivity in the Inner Mongolia grassland.",

Furthermore, we analyzed the relationships among ecosystem services and the responses of the services to the impact of land use intensity. The primary conclusions were as follows: (1) All five ecosystem services gradually diminished from the upper to the lower reaches of the Tabu River Basin; (2) Water conservation exhibited a trade-off relationship with soil conservation, NPP, and crop production, but it exhibited a synergistic relationship with carbon storage. There were also synergistic relationships between soil conservation, carbon storage, NPP, and crop production; (3) As land use intensity increased, soil conservation, NPP and crop production monotonically increased. In contrast, water conservation exhibited a monotonically decreasing trend, and carbon storage followed a unimodal curve; (4) In this region, suitable ecosystem services were sustained at a land use intensity of approximately 3.95.",

In this study, the phylogeny of 20 Stipa species (extensively distributed in Chinese grassland) was established to explore the origin and dispersal routes of Chinese grassland. It showed that Stipa species originated at 28\u2009MaBP and they started to differentiate in central Inner Mongolia at 22\u2009MaBP. Then, Stipa species expanded along four routes: (1) they expanded from central Mongolia to the Qilian Mountains, Qinghai, and western Tibet at 16\u2009MaBP. They then gradually expanded from western to eastern Tibet from 11\u20136\u2009MaBP. (2) At 12\u2009MaBP, they expanded from central Inner Mongolia to the Helan Mountains. (3) At 8\u2009MaBP, they expanded from central Inner Mongolia to the Xinjiang area. (4) At 4\u2009MaBP, they expanded from central to eastern Inner Mongolia. Therefore, we could deduce the formation order of Chinese grasslands: central Inner Mongolia u003e Qilian Mountains u003e Qinghai u003e western Tibet u003e Helan Mountains u003e Xinjiang u003e central Tibet u003e eastern Tibet u003e eastern Inner Mongolia.

However, while there is a good understanding of how individual species adapt to drought in this way, the way in which different functional types adapt to drought along a precipitation gradient remains poorly understood. In this study, we sampled 22 sites along a precipitation gradient in the Inner Mongolia grassland and measured eight leaf functional traits across 39 dominant species to determine the adaptive strategies of plant leaves to drought at the species and plant functional type levels. We found that leaf functional traits were mainly influenced by both aridity and phylogeny at the species level. There were four types of leaf adaptations to drought at the functional type level: adjusting the carbon-nitrogen ratio, the specific leaf area, the nitrogen content, and the specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen content simultaneously. These findings indicate that there is the trade-offs relationship between water and nitrogen acquisition as the level of drought increases, which is consistent with the worldwide leaf economics spectrum. In this study, we highlighted that the leaf economic spectrum can be adopted to reveal the adaptations of plants to drought in the Inner Mongolia grassland.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Exploring the underlying mechanisms of community diversity is a key issue in ecology and conservation biology. Community diversity studies typically focus on local processes, but these factors cannot completely explain community diversity. Many previous studies have shown that species richness can be quite different among communities with similar habitats. Therefore, the importance of regional processes has gradually been considered, and many hypotheses based on regional processes have been proposed. The species pool hypothesis developed by Zobel et al. is one of the most important theoretical developments in the field of community diversity. The species pool hypothesis suggests that community diversity is not only associated with contemporary environmental factors and local ecological processes (e.g., competition, predation, resources, spread, and interference), but is also limited by the regional species pool. The regional species pool is the set of species in a certain region that are capable of coexisting in a target community, which is shaped by historical (e.g., glaciation and geological age) and regional processes (e.g., speciation, immigration, dispersion, and extinction). To explore the applicability of the species pool hypothesis to community diversity in the Inner Mongolia grassland, we investigated the species diversity in the grassland region from late July to mid-August in 2012, when the grassland community biomass was at its peak. In this region, precipitation is considered the most important environmental factor affecting species diversity. Therefore, we established 192 field sites in the Inner Mongolia grassland along a gradient of mean annual precipitation. The position of each field site was located using GPS. At each site, an area of 10\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0m was delineated, and 10 plots of 1\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0m were randomly placed in the delineated area to survey all plant species. Based on these data, the relationships between regional diversity (gamma diversity) and community diversity (alpha diversity) were analyzed along seven mean annual precipitation (MAP) gradients. Gamma diversity is the total species richness at a site. Alpha diversity is defined as the mean species richness (number) for the 10 plots at a site. The correlation coefficient between these two diversity indices was used to verify the applicability of the species pool hypothesis. A few key results were obtained. (1) Both alpha diversity and gamma diversity increased significantly with MAP in the Inner Mongolia grassland. (2) Gamma diversity and alpha diversity showed a significant positive linear relationship under different gradients of MAP, which reveals that the species pool hypothesis adequately explained community diversity along different precipitation gradients. (3) The effect of the regional species pool on community species diversity weakened as the MAP increased, which explains the decrease in the applicability of the species pool hypothesis as MAP increased. (4) Exploring the relationship between gamma diversity and alpha diversity represents an effective method for determining the impact of the species pool on community diversity. This study contributes to the theory regarding the mechanisms that maintain community diversity. It also has practical applications for the protection of diversity in the Inner Mongolia grassland.",

Unlike previous theoretical investigation of P.Y. 101, our calculated results not only reproduce the absorption and fluorescence spectra reported in the previous experiment, but also were completed with considering solvent effect. It further demonstrates that the TDDFT theory we adopted is very reasonable and effective. The calculations of main bond lengths and bond angles involving in the hydrogen bondings (O1\u2013H2\u22efN3 and O4\u2013H5\u22efN6) as well as the infrared vibrational spectra and as well as the calculated hydrogen bonding energies demonstrated the intramolecular hydrogen bond was strengthened in the S1 state. In addition, qualitative and quantitative intramolecular charge transfer based on the frontier molecular orbitals provided the possibility of the ESIPT reaction. The potential energy surfaces of ground state and the first excited state have been constructed to illustrate the ESIPT mechanism. Based on our calculations, the equilibrium ESIPT process exists in the S1 state. And after the radiative transition, reversed GSIPT can also occur in the S0 state.",

The external electric field controlled electronic coupling and charge transport carrier mobility were quantitatively characterized with first-principles quantum mechanics combined with Marcus-Hush theory. The calculated orders of magnitude agreed well with the experimental values, and the electron mobility was found to be sensitive to the external electric field, while hole mobility revealed opposite result. When combining the rates of exciton dissociation and charge recombination in the electron transfer process with charge carrier mobility, vibrational relaxation and external electric field influences must be considered to obtain an accurate simulation of the charge transport process in solar cell photoactive materials.",

Density functional theory and visualization techniques were used to analyze the nature of the charge transfer excited states and to calculate the electronic coupling matrix, reorganization energy, free energy change, and other related data. Our simulated results reveal that, for this system, the efficiency of charge transfer is controlled by the external electric field. And the external electric field mainly affects the charge transfer integral. The mechanism of this ultrafast charge separation still needs for more in-depth researches.",

Firstly, the optical absorption properties of graphene and the boron nitride are investigated theoretically, respectively. It is found that there is a strong optical absorption in the visible and SW-NIR regions for graphene; while the optical absorption of boron nitride is in the deep-ultraviolet region. For the two layer complex of graphene on the boron nitride, theoretical calculations further reveal that the optical property of graphene in the visual region is almost not influenced by boron nitride. The three dimensional charge difference densities reveal the optical properties of electron\u2013hole distribution on the optical excitation for the single layer graphene. The ground state interaction between the graphene and the boron nitride is mainly the van der Waals interactions via edge atoms between two layers. Furthermore, charge difference density reveals that there is no charge transfer between graphene and boron nitride in the visual region on electronic transitions. So, the optical properties of graphene are not influenced by boron nitride in the visible region, which reveals that the boron nitride is one of the best substrates for graphene-based nano-photonic devices.",

        "abstract": "Recently, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have received much attention for cellular delivery of therapeutic molecules. However, in the case of CPPs as carriers for siRNA delivery, their utility is often restricted by low cellular uptake and/or entrapment in endosomes. Here, in order to deliver siRNAs with high efficiency, oligoarginine, a prominent member in CPPs, is rationally modified with oligohistidine and stearyl moieties (STR-) by fully taking into account the formation of nanoparticles, uptake and intracellular trafficking. We show that when the ratio of histidine/arginine in a peptide sequence is > 1.5, pronounced gene silencing is induced. Following this rule, STR-HnR8 (n = 16 and 20) are developed, which show a high knockdown efficiency rarely reported before. Finally, we find that endosomal escape of siRNA induced by stearylated and oligohistidylated oligoarginine is only from \u201cproton-sponge\u201d effect. Taken together, our results suggest a new strategy for the improvement of CPP-based siRNA delivery systems. From the Clinical Editor This study present a novel cell penetrating peptide-based siRNA delivery system utilizing modified oligo-arginine demonstrating a successful siRNA delivery approach.",

In this study, a series of four ionic complementary peptides, EAR16-II, EAR8-II, EAR8-IIa and ELR8-IIa, is derived from the most studied ionic complementary peptide EAK16-II. The purpose is to investigate the impact of peptide sequence on nanostructure formation, delivery efficacy and cell specificity of the peptide-drug complex. We show that the peptide length has a pronounced impact on the morphology of peptide complex with the anticancer drug ellipticine (EPT), and the amino acid arrangement affects the complex size. Cytotoxicity studies show that the complexes are effective at inhibiting the growth of A549 lung cancer cells and EAR16-II-EPT is the most effective. Interestingly, the complexes formulated with EAR16-II and EAR8-II become less active against MCF-7 breast cancer cells, but more hemolytic than the other two complexes.

Understanding the mechanisms of cellular internalization of CPPs facilitate their development of CPPs as gene delivery vectors. In the present study, we evaluated the internalization process of a previously designed CPP, STR-KV, complexed with small interference RNA (siRNA) targeting at the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene. Using heparin treatment and chemical endocytic inhibitors, we elucidated that the electrostatic interaction of STR-KV/siRNA complex with heparin sulfate proteoglycans at the cell membrane surface triggered the energy-independent uptake of the majority of the complexes, which most likely through a direct translocation pathway. The intracellular trafficking and internalization kinetics observed by confocal microscopy also confirmed that the complex was uptaken through a nonendocytic pathway.",

The Dox loaded PA system (Palm-CR3\u2013Dox) formed fibrous particles with a pH-triggered Dox release profile. Palm-CR3\u2013Dox enhanced the cellular uptake of Dox and showed drug resistance reversal potential. Both the membrane disruptive activity of Palm-CR3 and the conjugation of Dox with PA were suggested to contribute to the drug resistance reversal effect. This work explored the potential of the self-assembling PA system as a versatile drug delivery platform for cancer treatment.",

        "abstract": "At the forefront of medicine, gene therapy provides an effective way to treat a range of diseases by regulating defective genes at the root of the disease. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) hold great promise as therapeutic agents in this domain; however, intracellular delivery remains a major obstacle to clinical applications of therapeutic siRNAs. Here we report a peptide designed to mediate siRNA delivery. This peptide, C6M1, is rationally designed to promote the endosomal escape ability of an existing peptide sequence. Formed C6M1-siRNA nanoscale complexes are able to deliver siRNA into cells and induce specific gene knockdown with low toxicity. The increased membrane disruption ability under acidic conditions of the peptide with tryptophan residue substitution may contribute to the enhanced gene silence efficacy. Intratumoral injection of the complexes results in a marked reduction of tumor growth through downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein in mice. In addition, the C6M1-siRNA complex was proven safe at transfection concentration by cytotoxicity assay. These results demonstrate that the C6M1-siRNA complex is a potent system for efficient gene delivery in vitro and in vivo.",

Here, a systematically designed histidine-rich lipidated peptide (NP1) is presented to encapsulate and deliver an anti-cancer drug ellipticine (EPT) into two model cells: non-small cell lung carcinoma and Chinese hamster ovary cells. The mechanism of pH-responsive peptide self-assembly and -disassembly involved in the drug encapsulation and release process are extensively investigated. We found that NP1 could self-assemble as a spherical nano-complex (diameter = 34.43nm) in a neutral pH environment with EPT encapsulated and positively charged arginine amino acids aligned outward; and EPT is released in an acidic environment due to the pH-triggered disassembly. Furthermore, the EPT-encapsulating peptide could achieve a mass loading ability of 18% (mass of loaded-EPT/mass of NP1) with optimization. More importantly, it is revealed that the positively charged arginine on the periphery of the NP1 peptides could greatly facilitate their direct translocation through the negatively charged plasma membrane via electrostatic interaction; instead of via endocytosis, which provides a more efficient uptake pathway.",

In this work, we used a CLP, C6, as a nanocarrier for a hydrophobic anticancer agent, ellipticine (EPT). The size of the resulting C6-EPT complex was \u223c190 nm. The in vitro studies using A549 lung cancer cells showed an enhanced anticancer activity of the C6-EPT complex compared to that of C6 or the EPT control. This enhancement was found to correlate with the membrane disruption induced by C6, which facilitated the entry of EPT into cells. More importantly, the C6-EPT complex showed a higher selectivity than that of C6 towards cancer cells upon comparison of their cytotoxicities against A549 cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells. The enhanced therapeutic activity was also found in in vivo studies using an A549 tumor-bearing BALB/c nude mice model.

        "abstract": "Peptide based vaccine that incorporates one or several highly conserved CD8+ T cells epitopes to induce potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response is desirable for some infectious diseases, such as HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus-1), and cancers. However, the CD8+ T cells epitope is often weakly immunogenic, and thus requires a specific adjuvant or delivery system to enhance the efficiency. Here we investigated the use of self-assembling peptide EAK16-II based platform to achieve the co-delivery of CD8+ T cells epitope and TLR7/8 agonists (R848 or R837) for augmenting DCs maturation and HIV-1 specific CTL response. HIV-1 CTL epitope SL9 was conjugated with EAK16-II to obtain SL9-EAK16-II, which further spontaneously co-assembled with R848 or R837 in aqueous solution, forming co-assembled nanofibers. Fluorescence spectra and calorimetrical titration revealed the interaction between SL9-EAK16-II assemblies and R848 or R837 via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction, with the binding affinity (dissociation constant Kd) of 0.62 \u03bcM or 0.53 \u03bcM, respectively. Ex vivo generated DCs from HIV-1 + patients pulsed with the SL9-EAK16-II/R848 nanofibers stimulated significantly more polyfunctional SL9 specific CTLs, compared to the DCs pulsed with SL9 alone or the mixture of SL9 and TLR agonist. Furthermore, the nanofibers elicited stronger SL9 specific CTL response in vaccinated mice. Our findings suggest the self-assembling peptide EAK16-II might be used as a new delivery system for peptide based vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Multicast is a key technology that provides efficient data communication among a set of nodes for wireless multi-hop networks. In sensor networks and MANETs, multicast algorithms are designed to be energy efficient and to achieve optimal route discovery among mobile nodes, respectively. However, in wireless mesh networks, which are required to provide high quality service to end users as the \"last-mile\" of the Internet, throughput maximization conflicting with scarce bandwidth has the paramount priority. We propose a level channel assignment (LCA) algorithm and a multi-channel multicast (MCM) algorithm to optimize throughput for multi-channel and multi-interface mesh networks. The algorithms first build a multicast structure by minimizing the number of relay nodes and hop count distances between the source and destinations, and use dedicated channel assignment strategies to improve the network capacity by reducing interference. We also illustrate that the use of partially overlapping channels can further improve the throughput. Simulations show that our algorithms greatly outperform the single-channel multicast algorithm. We observe that MCM achieves better throughput and shorter delay while LCA can be realized in distributed manner.",

However, unlike other wireless networks, such as sensor networks and MANETs, where multicast algorithms are designed to be energy efficient and to achieve optimal route discovery among mobile nodes, wireless mesh networks need to maximize throughput. This paper proposes two multicast algorithms: the Level Channel Assignment (LCA) algorithm and the Multichannel Multicast (MCM) to improve the throughput for multichannel and multi-interface mesh networks. The algorithms build efficient multicast trees by minimizing the number of relay nodes and total hop count distances of the trees. The algorithms use dedicated channel assignment strategies to reduce the interference to improve the network capacity. We also demonstrate that using partially overlapping channels can further diminish the interference. Furthermore, additional interfaces help to increase the bandwidth, and multiple gateways can further shorten the total hop count distance. Simulations show that those algorithms greatly outperform the single-channel multicast algorithm. We also observe that MCM achieves better throughput and shorter delay while LCA can be realized in distributed manner.",

        "abstract": "Formation of macrophage-derived foam cells may mark the initial stages of atherosclerosis. We investigated the association between the expression of the leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LAIR-1) in macrophages and foam cell formation. A foam cell model was established by incubating THP-1-derived macrophages and bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). The role of LAIR-1 in foam cell formation was evaluated via Oil Red O staining and Dil-ox-LDL fluorescence intensities. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), cholesterol metabolism-related genes, and the role of LAIR-1 in activating classically activated (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages were evaluated by qPCR. Additionally, activation of protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) were detected by western blotting. Results indicated that silencing LAIR-1 in macrophages modulated the SHP-1/CREB/PPAR\u03b3 pathway, thereby promoting M2 macrophage polarization and increasing foam cell formation. Therefore, Inhibition of LAIR-1 in macrophages may promote foam cell formation and atherosclerosis.",

Dami (megakaryocyte line) cell maturation was induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. CD226 was silenced by infection with a CD226-specific shRNA lentiviral vector. The mRNA level of CD226 was detected by qRT-PCR. The expressions of Dami cells surface CD226, MK specific markers CD41 and CD62P, and DNA ploidy in Dami cells and CD226 knockdown (KD) cells were evaluated by flow cytometry. The effect of CD226 on the expression of megakaryocyte-associated transcription factors was measured by western blot and confocal analysis. Transfection with CD226 shRNA lentivirus dramatically decreased the level of CD226 and expression of CD62\u2009P in Dami cells. Silencing of CD226 caused morphological changes and differentiation retardation in low-ploidy MK. Furthermore, CD226 knockout (KO) mice exhibited increased 2N-4N low-ploidy MK and decreased \u22658N polyploidy. Interestingly, silencing of CD226 in megakaryocytic cells down-regulated the expression of early stage transcription factors includes GATA-binding factor 1 (GATA-1) and friend leukemia integration 1 (FLI-1), but not late-stage nuclear factor, erythroid 2 (NF-E2).

        "abstract": "This study examined the expression of the inhibitory receptor, leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptor-1 (LAIR-1) in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients to investigate its potential role in the modulation of inflammatory cytokines, metalloproteinases (MMPs), and invasiveness of synoviocytes. LAIR-1 expression in synovial tissues from RA patients, osteoarthritis patients, and healthy donors was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The membrane-bound form (mLAIR-1) was detected by flow cytometry. Factors involved in inflammation and MMP activity in FLS were analyzed by qPCR. LAIR-1 expression was higher in the synovia of the RA patients than those of the osteoarthritis patients. Co-immunostaining of vimentin/LAIR-1 demonstrated that LAIR-1 was mainly localized in FLS in the RA patients. Surprisingly, primary FLS isolated from the RA patients had low levels of mLAIR-1 expression, with cytoplasmic distribution. The extracellular domain of LAIR-1 was shed from the cell surface in response to TNF-\u03b1, and this process could be blocked by serine protease inhibitors. Additional experiments indicated that LAIR-1 overexpression considerably reduced FLS invasion, which simultaneously reduced the mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-8, and MMP-13 in the presence of TNF-\u03b1. Our study demonstrated that LAIR-1 is an anti-inflammatory molecule, and it was upregulated in FLS in the RA patients; however, cell-surface LAIR-1 could be shed from cells in the inflammatory microenvironment in RA. This may weaken the interaction of LAIR-1 with its ligand, thus reducing the anti-inflammatory effects of LAIR-1. These findings suggested that LAIR-1 may be an important factor involved in the mediation of the progressive joint destruction in RA. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Osteogenic differentiation is crucial for the maintenance of bone homeostasis. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), a member of sirtuins family, functions as a critical deacetylase that regulates many key proteins. In the current study, we aimed to clarify the role of SIRT3 in osteogenic differentiation and the possible mechanisms, using mouse pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Expression of SIRT3 was substantially increased in differentiated MC3T3-E1 cells. Knock down of SIRT3 significantly decreased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, and mRNA expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and collagen type I \u0251 1 (Col1\u02511), and osteocalcin in differentiated MC3T3-E1 cells. Overexpression of wild type but not mutant SIRT3 could reverse SIRT3 knockdown-resulted decrease of ALP staining. Complex I, II, III, IV, and V activities, oxygen consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential were significantly decreased by SIRT3 knockdown. Moreover, SIRT3 knockdown reduced mitochondrial density, increased mitochondrial size and decreased the expression of NRF1 and TFAM. Knock down of SIRT3 decreased mRNA and protein expression of SOD2 and increased ROS level. Overexpression of SOD2 significantly suppressed SIRT3 knockdown-induced decrease of mitochondrial function and osteogenic differentiation. SIRT3 knockdown resulted in a significant decrease of PGC-1\u0251 protein expression but not mRNA expression. Overexpression of wild type but not mutant SIRT3 could reverse SIRT3 knockdown-resulted decrease of PGC-1\u0251 protein expression. Moreover, we detected a direct interaction between SIRT3 and PGC-1\u0251 and SIRT3 knockdown reduced SIRT3 and PGC-1\u0251 interaction, resulting in a reduction of PGC-1\u0251 protein stability and PGC-1\u0251-binding in the promoters of SOD2. Overexpression of PGC-1\u0251 blocked SIRT3 knockdown-induced decrease of SOD2 expression, increase of ROS level, and decrease of mitochondrial function and biogenesis, leading to improvement of osteogenesis. Overall, the data provide a better understanding of the role of SIRT3 in osteogenic differentiation.",

        "abstract": "Triacylglycerols (TAGs) is stored in seeds as a nutrient for germination and postgerminative growth of seedlings. TAGs storage is confined to discrete spherical organelles called oil bodies. Plant seed oil bodies comprise a matrix of TAGs sur- rounded by a monolayer of phospholipids embedded with abundant oleosins and some minor proteins. Three minor proteins, temporarily termed caleosin (Sop1), steroleosin (Sop2) and Sop3, have been identified in oil bodies of diverse species. With the rapid development of molecular biology, the more wide application of rape seed oil bodies on genetic engineering, the more attention to Sops 1\u20133. To reveal the biological function and provide scientific basis of application on plant genetic engineering for rape caleosin proteins, a gene BnClo1 encoding caleosin protein was isolated by homology-based candidate gene method com- bined with RT-PCR and RACE-PCR from B. nupus. The full-length cDNA clone (accession No. AY966447 in GenBank) com- prised 1058 nucleotides consisting of a 36-nucleotide 5\u2032-untranslated region, an open reading frame of 738 nucleotides, and a 284-nucleotide 3\u2032-untranslated region. The open reading frame encoded a putative caleosin protein. The corresponding genomic sequence (1 676 nucleotides) of BnClo1 was also obtained by PCR cloning (accession No. DQ140380 in GenBank). Rapeseed genomic sequence of BnClo1 comprised six exons with five introns conservatively inserted in their coding regions. The splicingmodel of introns accords with the GT/AG rule in eukaryotes. In B. napus, BnClo1 was expressed in a spatially co-cordinated and temporally regulated manner. BnClo1 expression appeared to be highly regulated through embryogenesis. Northern blot demon- strated that BnClo1 mRNA was not detected in the earliest embryos, i.e. 20 DAF (day after flower) and presented in maturing rapeseeds at approximately 25 DAF. BnClo1 expression increased dramatically in the latter stages of embryogenesis, and this mRNA maintained a substantial level thereafter until the rapeseeds started to desiccate in a mode similar to oleosin mRNA. There was a single size class of BnClo1 transcript whose expression was regulated through embryogenesis. Semi-quantitative PCR showed that caleosin mRNA was only detected in the stem at two days after germination of rapeseeds. It is presumably revealed that BnClo1 is transcribed along with oleosin and steroleosin genes during seed maturation when oil bodies are actively assembled in diverse species. The deduced polypeptide of the rapeseed clone comprises 245 amino acid residues with molecular weight of 28.1 kD. Caleosin protein documented GenBank with accession No. AAY40837 might be an amphipathic protein associated with rapeseed oil bodies. Hydropathy plot and secondary structure analysis suggested that caleosin is comprised of three distinct struc-tural domains: an N-terminal hydrophilic domain with a single Ca2+-binding EF-hand motif, a central hydrophobic anchoring do- main of some 40 residues, and a C-terminal hydrophilic domain with conserved protein kinase phosphorylation sites. In addition, the central hydrophobic domain of caleosin also contained a proline-rich region with the potential to form a proline knot motif of the type that appears to be important in the lipid-body targeting. A potential amphipathic alpha helix, e.g. residues 92\u2013114 of caleosin might play a role in their binding both of single layer membrane and lipid bodies. Caleosin protein closely integrating with lipid bodies through embryogenesis plays an important role in the biogenesis process of oil bodies. With calcium-binding, the physiological function of caleosin protein may be responsible for decomposition of oil bodies and mobilization of triglycerides during seed germination.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the effect of pingyangmycin combined with dexamethasone infusing therapy on hemangioma at pecu-liar site in children. Methods From Jan.2005 to Dec.2010,27 cases with hemangioma at peculiar site were treated in Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College by injecting pingyangmycin combined with dexamethasone.Eight mg of pingyangmycin,5 mg of dexamethasone and 1-2 mL of 9 g\u00b7L-1 20 g\u00b7L-1 lidocaine were dissolved in 6-8 mL of 9 g\u00b7L-1 saline.The concentration of pingyangmycin was 1 g\u00b7L-1 and the treatment dosage was based on the size of the hemangioma.The therapeutic dosage was 1 mL per cm2.Pingyangmycin was applied to inject into hemangioma from different directions through the same puncture points and local pressure was induced to prolong the action time in tumor.And then the larger hemangioma was performed in several points and 2 to 3 points were appropriate.Pingyangmycin solution was injected into children hemangioma at peculiar site until it began to swell and got pale with a dose less than 8 mg.Hardness and color of tumor lesion indicated whether it needed to be injected once again till it began to shrink or get flatter in 2 weeks with a total dose less than 40 mg. Results Twenty-seven cases of children hemangioma at peculiar site were treated with pingyangmycin combined with dexamethasone infusing therapy.Among them,2 cases occurred low-grade fever,1 case occurred mild gastrointestinal reactions and recovered after 1-2 days without any treatment.Only 1 case occurred mucosa ulceration by injection 2 times and was cured by dressing change.Twenty-two cases were cured(81.5%),5 cases were relieved(18.5%),and the total efficiency rate was 100%.All patients were followed up for 1-2 years without recurrence. Conclusions Pingyangmycin combined with dexamethasone infusing therapy on children hemangioma at peculiar site may decrease the damage to tissue and keep the integrity of appearance and function as far as possible.The kind of treatment is a safe,convenient and efficient method.",

        "abstract": "Effects of surfactant concentration, antioxidants with different polarities, and chelator type on the oxidative stability of water-in-stripped walnut oil (W/O) emulsions stabilized by polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) were evaluated. The formation of primary oxidation products (lipid hydroperoxides) and secondary oxidation products (hexanal) decreased with increasing PGPR concentrations (0.3\u20131.0 wt% of emulsions). Excess surfactant might solubilize lipid hydroperoxides out of the oil\u2013water interface, resulting in the decreased lipid oxidation rates in W/O emulsions. At concentrations of 10\u20131000\u00a0\u03bcM, the polar Trolox demonstrated concentration-dependent antioxidant activity according to both hydroperoxide and hexanal formation. The antioxidant efficiency of the non-polar \u03b1-tocopherol was slightly reduced at the higher range of 500\u20131000\u00a0\u03bcM based on hydroperoxide formation. Both ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and deferoxamine (DFO) at concentrations of 5\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcM reduced the rates of lipid oxidation at varying degrees, indicating that endogenous transition metals may promote lipid oxidation in W/O emulsions. EDTA was a stronger inhibitor of lipid oxidation than DFO. These results suggest that the oxidative stability of W/O emulsions could be improved by the appropriate choice of surfactant concentration, antioxidants, and chelators.",

The activation of flowering requires histone methylation, but the roles of tri-methylation of lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me3) in modulating heading date and panicle development are unclear. Here, we showed that the COMPASS-like complex promotes flowering and panicle branching. The rice WD40 protein OsWDR5a interacts with the TRITHORAX-like protein OsTrx1/SDG723 to form the core components of the COMPASS-like complex. Plants in which OsWDR5a or OsTrx1 expression was decreased by RNA interference produced fewer secondary branches and less grain, and exhibited a delayed heading date under long-day and short-day conditions, whereas loss of OsWDR5a function resulted in embryo lethality. OsWDR5a binds to Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) to regulate its H3K4me3 and expression levels. Together, our results show that the COMPASS-like complex promotes flowering and panicle development, and suggest that modulation of H3K4me3 levels by the COMPASS-like complex is critical for rice development.",

The levels of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) modulated by TRITHORAX-like proteins regulate gene transcription, flowering time and environmental stress responses. However, plant TRITHORAX-like proteins have no known DNA-binding domain, and therefore the mechanism that gives sequence specificity to these proteins remains unclear. Here, we show that the rice TRITHORAX-like protein OsTrx1 is recruited to its target, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), by the C2H2 zinc finger protein SDG723/OsTrx1/OsSET33 Interaction Protein 1 (SIP1). SIP1 binds to the promoter of Ehd1 and interacts with OsTrx1. Mutations in SIP1 led to a late heading date under long-day and short-day conditions. Defects in OsTrx1 or SIP1 led to reduced H3K4me3 levels at Ehd1, thus reducing Ehd1 expression. Together, our results show that the transcription factor SIP1 interacts with OxTrx1, allowing OsTrx1 to specifically target Ehd1, altering H3K4me3 levels, increasing Ehd1 expression and thereby promoting flowering.",

        "title": "Phosphorylation of SPT5 by CDKD;2 is required for VIP5 recruitment and normal flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana",
        "abstract": "The elongation factor suppressor of Ty 5 homolog (Spt5) is a regulator of transcription and histone methylation. In humans, phosphorylation of SPT5 by P-TEFb, a protein kinase composed of Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and cyclin T, interacts with the RNA polymerase II-associated factor1 (PAF1) complex. However, the mechanism of SPT5 phosphorylation is not well understood in plants. Here, we examine the function of SPT5 in  Arabidopsis thaliana  and find that  spt5  mutant flowers early under long-day and short-day conditions. SPT5 interacts with the CDK-activating kinase 4 (CAK4; CDKD;2) and is specifically phosphorylated by CDKD;2 at threonines. The phosphorylated SPT5 binds VERNALIZATION INDEPENDENCE5 (VIP5), a subunit of the PAF1 complex. Genetic analysis showed that  VIP5  acts downstream of  SPT5  and  CDKD;2 . Loss of  SPT5  or  CDKD;2  function results in early flowering because of decreased amounts of  FLOWERING LOCUS C  ( FLC ) transcript. Importantly,  CDKD;2  and  SPT5  are required for the deposition of VIP5 and the enhancement of trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 4 in the chromatin of the  FLC  locus. Together, our results provide insight into the mechanism by which the Arabidopsis elongation factor SPT5 recruits the PAF1 complex via the posttranslational modification of proteins and suggest that the phosphorylation of SPT5 by CDKD;2 enables it to recruit VIP5 to regulate chromatin and transcription in Arabidopsis.",

        "abstract": "The endogenous messenger, the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a major role in plant's adaption to drought, salinity, cold and other abiotic stresses. In addition to abiotic stress signaling, ABA is involved also in developmental regulation and in responses to diverse biotic stresses. Dehydration stress results in a strong increase in endogenous ABA levels, which can be perceived by RCAR/PYR1/PYL receptors, initiating the ABA signaling pathway to coordinate the genome-wide gene expression, and plants adaptive physiological responses. ABA biosynthesis triggered by environmental cues as well as developmental signals occurs predominantly in vascular parenchyma cells. The measurement of ABA content in different organ/tissues is required to understandings how ABA is produced and delivered within the plants upon various stress conditions and to elucidate its regulatory role in both physiological and transcriptional responses. Quantitation of ABA can be achieved by two approaches: 1) the use of gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and 2) the use of immunoassays. Both methods are sensitive to trace amount of ABA down to the low pico-gram (10-12 g/ml FW) range. The GC-MS method needs special facilities, however the antibody based method is relatively simple and can be carried out in laboratory. Here we describe an easy method for ABA extraction from Arabidopsis seedlings, and further determination of ABA levels by competitive ELISA kit.",

        "abstract": "Low molecular weight fucoidan (LMWF) is a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from Saccharina Japonica that presents high affinity for P-selectin and abolish selectin-dependent recruitment of leukocytes. We hypothesized that dietary intake of LMWF, as a competitive binding agent of P\u2011selectin, could limit the inflammatory infiltration and aneurysmal growth in an Angiotensin\u00a0II\u2011induced abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) mouse model. The Gene Expression Omnibus database was used for gene expressions and gene set enrichment analysis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis showed that focal adhesion was involved in the development of AAA. However, dietary intake of LMWF could limit the enlargement of AAA, decreasing maximal aortic diameter and preserving elastin lamellae. Although LMWF did not decrease the circulatory monocytes count and lower the expression of P\u2011selectin in endothelium, it reduced macrophages infiltration in media and adventitia. Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinase expression was markedly downregulated, accompanied with reduced expression of inflammatory mediators, including interleukin\u00a01\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor\u2011\u03b1 and monocyte chemotactic protein\u20111.

        "abstract": "Abstract   In order to guarantee the safety and prolong the lifetime of lithium-ion power battery within electric vehicles, thermal management system is essential. A new type of thermal management system based on flow boiling in mini-channel utilizing dielectric hydrofluoroether liquid which boiling point is 34\u00a0\u00b0C is proposed. The cooling experiments for battery module are carried out at different discharge rates and flow  Re  number. The cooling effect and the influence of battery cooling on the electrochemical characteristics are concerned. The experimental results show that the thermal management can efficiently reduce maximum temperature of battery module and surface maximum temperature difference. A relatively uniform temperature and voltage distributions are provided within the battery module at higher discharge rate benefit from the advantage of boiling heat transfer with uniform temperature distribution on cold plate. It is shown that the voltage decreases with the increase of  Re  number of fluid due to the reducing of temperature. There exist slight fluctuations of voltage distribution because of the non-uniformity of temperature distribution within the battery module at higher discharge rates. For different discharge rate, there also exists an appropriate  Re  number range during which the mode of heat transfer is mainly in boiling heat transfer mode and the cooling result can be greatly improved.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A visualization experimental investigation on the condensation heat transfer of refrigerant R410a in a rectangular micro-channel with hydraulic diameter of 0.67\u00a0mm is conducted in this paper. Experiments are conducted with saturation temperatures of 36\u201341\u00a0\u00b0C, and the refrigerant mass fluxes is in the range of 109\u20131042\u00a0kg/(m 2 \u00a0s) over the entire range of vapor qualities. One-dimension annular flow model is established to study the condensation heat transfer characteristics inside micro-channel. The condensate film thickness, dimensionless condensation liquid flow velocity, local heat transfer coefficient and average heat transfer coefficient are obtained to analyze the condensation heat transfer mechanism in micro-channel. The predicted value of heat transfer coefficient has great agreement with experimental data in this study. Visualization experimental results agree with condensation flow patterns map in micro-channel proposed by other researcher. Annular flow, wavy-annular flow, slug flow and bubble flow are observed along the flow direction in micro-channel under the low mass flux. Saturation pressure, mass flux, sub-cooled and vapor quality of R410a are considered. The results show that the heat transfer coefficient increases with mass fluxes and vapor quality remarkably. Experiment results are 17% higher than other research results, especially in high mass flux and vapor quality. In addition, the significant influence of sub-cooled is proposed and discussed in micro-channel condensation study. The lower sub-cooled will bring higher heat transfer coefficient.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A three-dimensional theoretical model of the annular flow for R410a convective condensation in a rectangular microchannel with the hydraulic diameter of 0.67\u202fmm is established in this investigation. The concurrent vapor-liquid two-phase flow field is divided into three regions: the liquid flow in the thin film region on the sidewall, the condensate liquid flow in the meniscus region at corners, and the vapor flow in the vapor core region. This model takes into account the effects of surface tension at the corner, the interfacial shear stress induced by the vapor flow, the momentum transfer on the vapor-liquid interface, and the turbulence of condensate liquid flow in meniscus region. Uniform wall temperature is adopted as a boundary condition in this analytical model, and the computational results are validated against experimental data. The mass fluxes ranging from 100\u202fkg/(m 2 \u202fs) up to 1000\u202fkg/(m 2 \u202fs) are considered in a rectangular microchannel with the aspect ratio of 0.5. The distribution of the liquid film thickness, the mass flow rate along the sidewall induced by the surface tension, the condensate liquid flow velocity in the meniscus region, the local heat transfer coefficient at each cross section and the average heat transfer coefficient are obtained to analyze the mechanism of condensation flow and heat transfer in a microchannel. Remarkably, the importance of condensate liquid turbulence in the meniscus region is validated by the great agreement between computational results and experimental data.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this work is to report our experience with (131)I therapy without recent antithyroid drug (ATD) pretreatment for refractory severe hyperthyroidism complicated by hyperbilirubinemia due to hepatic dysfunction.Five patients with refractory severe hyperthyroidism were treated with(131)I at 90 &mu;Ci-120 &mu;Ci/g of thyroid (total activities, 6.2mCi -10.1mCi). The patients previously had received ATD treatment from 2 months to 12 years and discontinued ATDs, from 2 months to 4 years before (131)I treatment, because of treatment failure or severe jaundice. Prior to (131)I therapy, the patients were asked to take a low-iodine diet, and treated with bisoprolol fumarate, digoxin, furosemide, s-adenosyl methionine, polyene phosphatidylcholine and plasma exchanges as supportive treatment for related clinical conditions. Four of the patients also received lithium carbonate in conjunction with their (131)I treatment.The patients were followed up for 4 to 9 years after (131)I therapy.After (131)I treatment, jaundice disappeared completely within 3 to 4 months in all patients, and liver function tests returned to normal. Concurrent atrial fibrillation and heart failure, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia, or thrombocytopenia and left cardiac enlargement improved remarkably in 3 patients during the follow-up period. Three to 45 months after (131)I treatment, hypothyroidism was noted in the patients and they were treated with L-thyroxine replacement therapy.(131)I therapy without recent ATD pretreatment for refractory severe hyperthyroidism complicated by serious jaundice appears to be safe and effective, with good long-term results. It may be the preferred therapy for such patients and should be used as early as possible.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and long-term results of (131)I therapy alone for patients with refractory severe hyperthyroidism without antithyroid drug pretreatment. From January 2002 to December 2012, 408 patients with refractory severe hyperthyroidism were treated with (131)I alone. Among them, 345 were followed up for 1 to 10 years for physical examination, thyroid function, and thyroid ultrasound. Complete Blood Count (CBC) liver function, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and Emission Computed Tomography (ECT) thyroid imaging were performed as indicated. The 345 patients had concomitant conditions including thyrotoxic heart disease, severe liver dysfunction, enlarged thyroid weighing 80 to 400\u2009g, severe cytopenia, and vasculitis. One to two weeks prior to (131)I therapy, all patients were given low-iodine diet. The dose of (131)I therapy was 2.59 to 6.66\u2009MBq (70 to180 \u00b5Ci) per gram of thyroid with an average of 3.83\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u2009MBq (103.6\u2009\u00b1\u200916.4\u2009\u00b5Ci); and the total (131)I activity administrated for the individuals was 111 to 3507.6\u2009MBq (3.0 to 94.8\u2009mCi, mean 444\u2009\u00b1\u2009336.7\u2009MBq (12.0\u2009\u00b1\u20099.1\u2009mCi)). Out of the 408 patients, 283 were cured, 15 with complete remission, and 47 with incomplete remission. No treatment failure or significant clinical worsening was noted in these patients. Our data indicated that (131)I therapy alone for patients with refractory severe hyperthyroidism without antithyroid drug pretreatment is safe and effective. ",

Methods \u3000Clinical data of 637 patients with SH, admitted in the Department of Nuclear Medicine, the former 307th Hospital of Chinese PLA from Jan. 1975 to Dec. 2014, treated with 131I without ATD pretreatment and followed up for more than one year, were recruited in present study. SPSS 20.0 software was used to analyze the therapeutic efficacy, serum levels of thyroid hormone (TH) and thyroid therapeutic activity, etc. Results \u3000Based on the clinical characteristics, the 637 patients were divided into seven groups: severe thyroid dysfunction, thyrotoxic heart disease, complicated with severe liver dysfunction, complicated with large goiter, complicated with huge goiter, complicated with severe cytopenia, and complicated with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, etc. Five hundred and Forty cases (84.8%) were cured, 53 cases (8.3%) with complete remission, and 44 cases (6.9%) with incomplete remission. Hypothyroidism was noted in 363 cases (57.0%). No significant clinical worsening was found in 637 patients after 131I therapy. The thyroid hormones (TH) level returned to normal within 12 months after 131I therapy in 510 patients (80.1%). The efficacy of 131I therapy was closely correlated to the administered activity of 131I. The dose of 131I therapy was 2.59 to 11.11MBq per gram of thyroid with an average of (3.82\u00b10.80)MBq, and the total 131I activity administrated for the individuals was 85.1-3496.5MBq with an average of (447.7\u00b1407.0)MBq. The cure rate after one dose of 131I therapy was 81.8%. The serum TH level was decreased significantly in patients with severe jaundice by lithium carbonate prescribed shortly before and after 131I therapy. The 131I therapy instead of surgical treatment is safe and effective for those patients complicated with huge goiter and heart disease and unsuitable for surgery. 131I therapy does not affect fertility, and there have been 57 patients who have given birth of 59 healthy babies. Conclusion \u3000131I therapy without ATD pretreatment is safe and effective for patients with SH. Based on comprehensive treatment, the individualized 131I therapy for such patients should be considered as early as possible.    DOI: 10.11855/j.issn.0577-7402.2019.02.09",

        "abstract": "In a previous study in patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), we found an association between high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) with poor short-term mortality. In the current study, this preliminary finding was validated using an independent patient cohort. A total of 181 ICH patients (from January 2016 to December 2017) were included. Diagnosis was confirmed using computed tomography (CT) in all cases. Patient survival (up to 30\u00a0days) was compared between subjects with high NLR (above the 7.35 cutoff; n\u2009=\u200974) versus low NLR (\u2264\u20097.35; n\u2009=\u2009107) using Kaplan-Meier analysis. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify factors that influenced the 30-day mortality. Correlation between NLR with other relevant factors (e.g., C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen) was examined using Spearman correlation analysis. The 30-day mortality was 19.3% (35/181) in the entire sample, 37.8% (28/74) in the high-NLR group, and 6.5% (7/107) in the low-NLR group (P\u2009<\u20090.001). In comparison to the low-NLR group, the high-NLR group had higher rate of intraventricular hemorrhage (29.7 vs. 16.8%), ICH volume (median 23.9 vs. 6.0\u00a0cm) and ICH score (median 1.5 vs. 0), and lower GCS score (9.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5 vs. 12.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2). An analysis that divided the samples into three equal parts based on NLR also showed increasing 30-day mortality with incremental NLR (1.6, 15.0, and 41.7% from lowest to highest NLR tertile, P for trend <\u20090.001). Kaplan-Meier curve showed higher 30-day mortality in subjects with high NLR than those with low NLR (P\u2009<\u20090.001 vs. low-NLR group, log-rank test). High NLR (>\u20097.35) is associated with poor short-term survival in acute ICH patients.",

        "abstract": "Objective This study aimed to examine the relationship between serum iron levels and in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients. Methods We retrospectively studied 250 critically ill patients who received treatment at the intensive care unit between June 2015 and May 2017. Blood chemistry and hepatic and renal function were measured. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted according to serum iron levels. Correlations between serum iron levels and other variables were analyzed. Results A total of 165 (66.0%) patients had abnormally low serum iron levels (<10.6 \u03bcmol/L). Patients who died during hospitalization had markedly higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores and significantly lower serum iron levels compared with those who survived. Cumulative survival was significantly lower in patients with low serum iron levels than in those with normal serum iron levels in subgroup analysis of older patients (n\u2009=\u2009192). Multivariate regression analysis showed that, after adjusting for relevant factors, low serum iron levels remained an independent risk for in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 2.014; 95% confidence interval 1.089, 3.725). Conclusions Low serum iron levels are present in a significant proportion of critically ill patients and are associated with higher in-hospital mortality, particularly in older patients.",

Based on the properties of the semi-tensor product (STP) of matrices, a technique is proposed to merge the switching signal and all inputs of subnetworks into a single input variable. This technique allows us to transfer a SBCN to an equivalent non-switching logical control network (LCN) and eases the analysis and design process significantly. So long as a state-feedback stabilizer is obtained for the resulting non-switching LCN, it can then be decomposed uniquely into the respective state feedbacks of the sub-networks and the state-dependent switching law. Based on this technique, the controllability and stabilisability of such SBCNs are solved and an algorithm for finding all time-optimal switching state feedbacks is proposed. An example is described to illustrate the main results and the design process proposed in this paper.",

Surface stabilizers with different chain length and charged group were designed to reveal the influence of electrostatic and van der Waals forces between silica and stabilizer on the dispersion of silica particles in aqueous medium. Results showed surface stabilizer with longer alkyl chain and charged group exerted best ability to deaggregate silica, leading to a hydrodynamic size of 51.1 nm. Surface stabilizer designing with rational structure is a promising solution for deagglomerating and reducing process time and energy. Giving the designability and adaptability of surface stabilizer, this method is of potential for dispersion of other inorganic nanoparticles.",

        "abstract": "The application of composite microspheres closely lies on their morphology and properties. In this work, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) reinforced composite microspheres were prepared via in situ polymerization: methyl methacrylate was selected as matrix to copolymerize with cationic comonomer 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride, using CNTs as nanofillers to fabricate composite microspheres. The morphology, molecular weight, and thermal properties of obtained composite microspheres with different monomer feeding ways (batch polymerization and dropwise monomer feeding procedure) and reaction time (1\u20136 h) were investigated. The results revealed that dropwise monomer feeding procedure leaded to remarkably decreased diameter of composite microspheres. Compared with polymer microspheres, the addition of CNTs resulted in earlier formation of composite microspheres. When the reaction time was controlled for 1\u20136 h, the morphology of the composite microspheres underwent a shape change from deformed particles to spherical structure. Although reaction time had no significant effect on molecular weight, the thermal property was gradually improved with increase of reaction time. For ensuring the effectiveness of the produced composite microspheres and tailoring them for any specific application, our investigation shows significant reference value on choosing feeding ways and controlling reaction time to obtain different morphology microspheres. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "abstract": "In this work, a different polymer chain structure was synthesized to study \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between polymer and reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Polymers with different chain structures were obtained from free radical copolymerization of styrene with 4-cyanostyrene (containing substituted phenyl rings) and 2-vinylnaphthalene (containing naphthalene rings). In this work, the polystyrene, poly(styrene--4-cyanostyrene) and poly(styrene--2-vinylnaphthalene) were named as PS, PSCN and PSNP, respectively. RGO was prepared through modified Hummers' method and further thermal reduction, and nanocomposites were prepared by solution blending. Thus, different \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions were formed between polymers and RGO. Raman and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to characterize the interfacial interaction, showing that the trend of the interfacial interaction should be in the order of RGO/PSCN, RGO/PS, and RGO/PSNP. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement showed that, compared with polymer matrix, the glass transition temperature (T) of RGO/PS, RGO/PSCN and RGO/PSNP nanocomposites with the addition of 4.0 wt% RGO are increased by 14.3 \u00b0C, 25.2 \u00b0C and 4.4 \u00b0C, respectively. Compared with \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction only formed through aromatic rings, substituent groups changed the densities of electron clouds on the phenyl rings. This change resulted in the formation of donor-acceptor interaction and reinforcement of the \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction at the interface, which leads to increased value of T. This comparative study can be useful for selecting appropriate interaction groups, as well as suitable monomers, to prepare high performance nanocomposites.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Dispersing nanoparticles in polymers is a key requirement for the development of polymer-matrix composites. In this study, cationic ligand and anionic ligand were designed to serve as dispersant, emulsifier and comonomer in different stages of nanocomposites preparation. Commercial BaTiO 3 , TiO 2 , Ag and Al 2 O 3  nanoparticles were incorporated and dispersed uniformly in polystyrene (PS) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrices by designed cationic/anionic ligand. As dispersants, the sizes of nanoparticles aggregates were reduced from thousands of nanometers to dozens of nanometers by cationic/anionic ligand. Then ligands served as emulsifiers to prepare polymer nanocomposites. At the end of emulsion polymerization, the ligands copolymerized with polymer matrices. At this stage, the sizes of nanoparticles in polymer matrices fell to several nanometers. After hot-pressing, nanoparticles maintained the stable dispersion state in polymer matrices. The tensile strength of P(MMA-co-VDAC)/BaTiO 3  increased by 77% compared with PMMA. The thermal decomposition temperature of P(St-co-MAMS)/Al 2 O 3  was improved by 24\u202f\u00b0C compared with PS. A facile and efficient approach was exhibited for preparing polymer nanocomposites with a large variety of chemically different nanoparticles in diversified polymer matrices.",

The auxiliary inverter in this paper uses a split-capacitor inverter topology with a midline inductor to suppress the effect of unbalanced load. In this paper, the auxiliary inverter is split into three independent single-phase inverters, respectively, to control the fundamental impedance of each single-phase inverter to obtain excellent output voltage waveform. Each single-phase inverter control system uses voltage and current double-loop control strategy, the voltage outer ring with a new resonant controller, not only can inhibit the unbalanced load on the auxiliary inverter output voltage distortion, and can balance the split capacitor voltage. Finally, a virtual DSP system based on S-Function is constructed. The simulation results show that the new resonant controller can suppress the effect of unbalanced load on the output voltage distortion of the auxiliary inverter.",

Recent studies have reported the relationship of  promoter methylation with clinicopathological significance of gastric cancer. However, the results remain unclear due to small size of sample. We pooled 15 studies including 827 gastric cancer patients and conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the clinicopathological significance of  promoter methylation in gastric cancer. Our data revealed that the frequency of  promoter methylation was higher in gastric cancer than in normal gastric tissue, Odd Ratio (OR) was 10.12 with 95% CI 5.17-19.79,  < 0.00001. Additionally, the rate of  promoter methylation was significantly increased in high grade of gastric cancer compared to low grade, OR was 1.64 with 95% CI 1.00-2.68,  = 0.05.  methylation was significantly associated with the positive lymph node metastasis, OR was 1.56 with 95% CI 1.05-2.32,  = 0.03. We concluded that  could serve as a biomarker for diagnosis of gastric cancer, and a drug target for development of gene therapy in gastric cancer.  promoter methylation is associated with tumor poor differentiation and lymph node metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Background  C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) protein level was highly detected in a number of cancer types including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The correlation of CXCR4 expression in PDAC and its clinicopathological characteristics remains inconclusive. This study aims at investigating the relationship of CXCR4 expression and clinicopathological characteristics of PDAC patients using a meta-analysis.    Methods  PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and EBSCO databases and Google Scholar from January 2000 to August 2018 were searched. The Review Manager 5.2 was used in the analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were measured. This study included a total of 11 relevant articles which involved 1439 PDAC patients.    Results  CXCR4 was more frequently overexpressed in PDAC tissues than normal pancreatic samples, OR\u202f=\u202f132.07, P\u202f=\u202f0.03. The frequency of high CXCR4 expression significantly increased in high grade PDAC than low grade, OR was 1.50, P\u202f=\u202f0.03. High CXCR4 expression was more frequently observed in late stage of PDAC than those in early stage, OR was 2.82, P\u202f=\u202f0.0009. High CXCR4 expression significantly increased the risk of lymph node and distant metastases in PDAC, OR\u202f=\u202f2.69, p\u202f    Conclusions  CXCR4 overexpression is a valuable risk factor for PDAC. CXCR4 overexpression is a strong prognostic marker correlated with the risk of lymph node involvement and distant metastasis in PDAC patients.",

        "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is a serious disease with high incidence rate and high mortality. Geniposide (GEN) exhibits multiple biological properties including anti-tumor function. However, effect of GEN on GC is not well studied. Hence, the effects of GEN on GC were investigated in our study. HULC expression in GC tissue and GC cell lines (MKN45, SGC-7901, MKN28, AGS) was detected by qRT-PCR. Cell viability, colony formation, migration, invasion and cell apoptosis were examined by CCK-8 assay, survival fraction assay, modified two-chamber migration assay, Millicell Hanging Cell Culture and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 and vimentin was detected by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. The expression of PI3K/AKT and JNK was measured by western blot. The expression of HULC was up-regulated both in GC tissue and cell lines (P\u202f<\u202f.05, P\u202f<\u202f.01 or P\u202f<\u202f.001). GEN negatively regulated the expression of HULC in MKN45 cells (P\u202f<\u202f.05 or P\u202f<\u202f.01). GEN decreased cell viability (P\u202f<\u202f.05), colony formation (P\u202f<\u202f.01), migration (P\u202f<\u202f.05) and invasion (P\u202f<\u202f.05) while HULC overexpression led to the opposite results in GEN-treated cells. The expression of phosphatidylinositol 3' -kinase (PI3K)/ protein kinase B (AKT) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was down-regulated by GEN (all P\u202f<\u202f.05) while reversed by HULC overexpression. HULC was up-regulated in GC. GEN inhibited MNK45 cell viability, colony formation, migration and invasion while induced cell apoptosis by down-regulation of HULC in MKN45 cells. GEN inactivated PI3K/AKT and JNK signal pathways through down-regulation of HULC.",

We synthesized g-CN nanofibers by directly hydrolyzing bulk g-CN in the alkaline atmosphere (3\u202fM NaOH). The obtained ultrathin g-CN nanofibers were verified by characterizations of Transmission electronic microscope (TEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Fourier transformation-infrared (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that the fluorescence intensity of g-CN nanofibers was obviously quenched by DA. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between DA and g-CN nanofibers led to the fluorescence reduction of g-CN nanofibers. The fluorescent probe based on g-CN nanofibers exhibits linear responses to the concentration of DA in the range from 0 to 4\u202f\u03bcM and 4 to 20\u202f\u03bcM, the limit of detection is 17\u202fnM. The fluorescent probe shows excellent stability, good selectivity with its application in serums.",

The PPy/ERGO modified electrode (PPy/ERGO/GCE) was used as a platform of electrochemical sensor to detect imidacloprid (IMI) insecticide. CV and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were chosen as the methods to investigate of the electrochemical behavior of IMI on PPy/ERGO/GCE surface. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectra were utilized to describe the morphology and structure of the modified electrode. Experimental parameters were optimized, such as the number of polymerization cycles, scan rate and the pH value of electrolyte. Under the optimized conditions, when the concentration of IMI was in the range of 1-10 \u03bcM and 10-60 \u03bcM, the increase of reduction peak current was linear with the concentration of IMI, and the low detection limit was found to be 0.18 \u03bcM (S/N\u00a0= 3). Results showed that PPy/ERGO/GCE demonstrated satisfactory reproducibility and stability, and has great potential in actual sample testing.",

AMX response at PGA/3D-GE/GCE involving the transfer of one electron and an equal number of protons were determined using electrochemical approaches. Density functional theory simulations were performed to give insights on the reaction mechanism of AMX on the surface of the modified electrode. When the optimization of the experimental conditions was completed, the linear range of AMX was 2-60\u202f\u03bcM. Besides, the detection limit was calculated as 0.118\u202f\u03bcM\u202f(S/N\u202f=\u202f3). And the modified electrode could detect the concentration of the AMX in human urine samples. Overall, the developed PGA/3D-GE/GCE for determination of AMX shows great potentials in practice.",

The method is used for sensors which are made of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) as the sensing element, where the front side is under soil pressure, and the back is under the water pressure. It can accurately monitor the lateral earth pressure by measuring the front and back of the pressure difference. The pressure in the horizontal direction is only water pressure in water, while it consists of lateral earth pressure and pore water pressure in the soil. Therefore the depth of the mud surface can be calculated by a plurality of sensors at different depth. The method can feedback erosion and siltation of hydraulic structure in time, and provide reliable data support for the safe operation of the hydraulic structure.",

But the resistance of these concrete can not be monotonically changed, which makes it difficult to be used as a sensing material. In order to solve the above problems, this paper has prepared a new type of smart polymer concrete block by adding graphite and steel slag in the epoxy resin concrete to test the pressure-sensitive characteristics under uniaxial compression. The results show that the resistance of the concrete with complex graphite and steel slag increases with the increase of strain under uniaxial compression, and the process shows the concordant monotonicity. In this paper, the concept of \u201cinterfacial contact effect\u201d is proposed to explain the phenomenon, that is, the steel slag and sand are similar to the \u201cisland\u201d in the form of conductive adhesive matrix \u201cocean\u201d, and the steel slag in the smart polymer concrete provide conductive interface layer. The pressure sensitivity of the block is mainly due to the interfacial contact effect between the interfacial surface and the conductive adhesive matrix.",

This article further investigates the effect of configuration details on seismic performance of buckling-restrained braces with H-section steel core and compares two half-wavelength calculation methods for higher-order local buckling of H-section steel core. First, quasi-static cyclic tests are described on two newly designed buckling-restrained braces with H-section steel cores and another buckling-restrained brace with flat steel core. Then, Bleich\u2019s and Lundquist\u2019s methods are reviewed for evaluating half wavelength of higher-order local buckling based on elastoplastic buckling theory of plates and compared with the test results of four buckling-restrained braces with H-section steel core including the two from a previous test. It is found from the test results that due to H-section steel core\u2019s higher self-s...",

        "abstract": "Bang-bang phase detector based PLLs are simple to design, suffer no systematic phase error, and can run at the highest speed a process can make a working flip-flop. For these reasons designers are employing them in the design of very high speed Clock Data Recovery (CDR) architectures. The major drawback of this class of PLL is the inherent jitter due to quantized phase and frequency corrections. Reducing loop gain can proportionally improve jitter performance, but also reduces locking time and pull-in range. This paper presents a novel PLL design that dynamically scales its gain in order to achieve fast lock times while improving jitter performance in lock. Under certain circumstances the design also demonstrates improved capture range. This paper also analyses the behaviour of a bang-bang type PLL when far from lock, and demonstrates that the pull-in range is proportional to the square root of the PLL loop gain.",

Its hierarchical structure is sorted in layer and divided in tier by the component function and domain. The class library extension and edition upgrade problems are solved by providing a kind of homology mechanism. By defining a kind of formal description language, the class component attribute, method, relation and other relevant information are described which facilitate the maintenance and management of the class library. The development of the prototype system of ERP class library shows that the method improves the efficiency of software reuse and shortens the cycle of software development.",

The characteristics of mobile agents make them ideal for electronic commerce applications in open networks. Security is a fundamental precondition for the acceptance of mobile agent systems.
