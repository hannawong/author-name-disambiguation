        "abstract": "In genome-wide association (GWA) studies, test statistics that are efficient and robust across various genetic models are preferable, particularly for studying multiple diseases in the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC, 2007, Nature 447, 661-678). A new test statistic, the minimum of the p-values of the trend test and Pearson's test, was considered by the WTCCC. It is referred to here as MIN2. Because the minimum of two p-values is no longer a valid p-value itself, the WTCCC only used it to rank single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) but did not report the p-values of the associated SNPs when MIN2 was used for ranking. Given its importance in practice, we derive the asymptotic null distribution of MIN2, study some of its analytical properties related to GWA studies, and compare it with existing methods (the trend test, Pearson's test, MAX3, and the constrained likelihood ratio test [CLRT]) by simulations across a wide range of possible genetic models: the recessive (REC), additive (ADD), multiplicative (MUL), dominant (DOM), and overdominant models. The results show that MAX3 and CLRT have greater efficiency robustness than other tests when the REC, ADD/MUL, and DOM models are possible, whereas Pearson's test and MIN2 have greater efficiency robustness if the possible genetic models also include the overdominant model. We conclude that robust tests (MAX3, MIN2, CLRT, and Pearson's test) are preferable to a single trend test for initial GWA studies. The four robust tests are applied to more than 100 SNPs associated with 11 common diseases identified by the two WTCCC GWA studies.",

        "abstract": "To test for genetic association between a marker and a complex disease using a case-control design, Cochran-Armitage trend tests (CATTs) and Pearson's chi-square test are often employed. Both tests are genotype-based. Song and Elston (Statist. Med. 2006; 25:105-126) introduced the Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium trend test and combined it with CATT to test for association. Compared to using a single statistic to test for case-control genetic association (referred to as single-phase analysis), two-phase analysis is a new strategy in that it employs two test statistics in one analysis framework, each statistic using all available case-control data. Two such two-phase analysis procedures were studied, in which Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the population is a key assumption, although the procedures are robust to moderate departure from HWE. Our goal in this article is to study a new two-phase procedure and compare all three two-phase analyses and common single-phase procedures by extensive simulation studies. For illustration, the results are applied to real data from two case-control studies. On the basis of the results, we conclude that with an appropriate choice of significance level for the analysis in phase 1, some two-phase analyses could be more powerful than commonly used test statistics.",

        "abstract": "A two-stage design is cost-effective for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) testing hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this design, each SNP is genotyped in stage 1 using a fraction of case-control samples. Top-ranked SNPs are selected and genotyped in stage 2 using additional samples. A joint analysis, combining statistics from both stages, is applied in the second stage. Follow-up studies can be regarded as a two-stage design. Once some potential SNPs are identified, independent samples are further genotyped and analyzed separately or jointly with previous data to confirm the findings. When the underlying genetic model is known, an asymptotically optimal trend test (TT) can be used at each analysis. In practice, however, genetic models for SNPs with true associations are usually unknown. In this case, the existing methods for analysis of the two-stage design and follow-up studies are not robust across different genetic models. We propose a simple robust procedure with genetic model selection to the two-stage GWAS. Our results show that, if the optimal TT has about 80% power when the genetic model is known, then the existing methods for analysis of the two-stage design have minimum powers about 20% across the four common genetic models (when the true model is unknown), while our robust procedure has minimum powers about 70% across the same genetic models. The results can be also applied to follow-up and replication studies with a joint analysis.",

Numerical\n analysis results indicate that the underlying tunnels at different locations under the excavation will experience convergence\n and divergence due to overlying excavation. Moreover, the tunnel located below base of diaphragm wall will experience distortion.\n The deformation is mainly due to the uneven changes of ground contact pressure on tunnel linings. Both the vertical and horizontal\n displacement of the tunnel decrease with the increase of the tunnel embedded depth beneath the formation of excavation.",

METHODS: PC12 cell cultures were exposed to MnCl_2 within the range of 100-900 μmol/L. The inhibiti on of the cells during 7 d was determined by MTT assay and plate clone formation test, and ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 were determined by Western blot. RESULTS: MnCl_2 at different concentrations (100, 300, 500, 700 and 900 μmol/L) could inhibit the growth and proliferation of PC12 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner and the cell growth curves were changed accordingly (P<0.05). Western blot showed that MnCl_2 decreased p-ERK1/2 expression in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: MnCl_2 can significantly inhibit the growth and proliferation of PC12 cells, possibly by downregulating p-ERK1/2 expression.",

        "abstract": "Children are known to be venerable to lead (Pb) toxicity. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) in immature brain is particularly vulnerable to Pb insults. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that Pb exposure damaged the integrity of the BBB in young animals and iron (Fe) supplement may prevent against Pb-induced BBB disruption. Male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups. Three groups of rats were exposed to Pb in drinking water containing 342 microg Pb/mL as Pb acetate, among which two groups were concurrently administered by oral gavage once every other day with 7 mg Fe/kg and 14 mg Fe/kg as FeSO(4) solution as the low and high Fe treatment group, respectively, for 6 weeks. The control group received sodium acetate in drinking water. Pb exposure significantly increased Pb concentrations in blood by 6.6-folds (p<0.05) and brain tissues by 1.5-2.0-folds (p<0.05) as compared to controls. Under the electron microscope, Pb exposure in young animals caused an extensive extravascular staining of lanthanum nitrate in brain parenchyma, suggesting a leakage of cerebral vasculature. Western blot showed that Pb treatment led to 29-68% reduction (p<0.05) in the expression of occludin as compared to the controls. Fe supplement among Pb-exposed rats maintained the normal ultra-structure of the BBB and restored the expression of occludin to normal levels. Moreover, the low dose Fe supplement significantly reduced Pb levels in blood and brain tissues. These data suggest that Pb exposure disrupts the structure of the BBB in young animals. The increased BBB permeability may facilitate the accumulation of Pb. Fe supplement appears to protect the integrity of the BBB against Pb insults, a beneficial effect that may have significant clinical implications.",

        "abstract": "Assessing the insulator surface contamination condition can be described as multi-pattern recognition.The traditional methods for assessing this can not achieve the required accuracy for some engineering application due to the limited sample data sets and the complex factors that affect the surface contamination condition of insulator.In the research,based on the full advantage of SVM's ability to solve the problem with relatively few samples and nonlinear and high dimensions,the DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph) SVMs model for multi-pattern recognition is used to assess the contamination condition of the high voltage insulator.The model is easily realized and can find out the super-plane between patterns without local minima,and has strong universal ability.The nonlinear relationship between the electrical characteristics of different contamination condition insulators,the environment factors and the contamination condition is considered synthetically by the SVM method,and the surface contamination condition of insulator is assessed.The results show that the model is suitable to the contamination assessment.",

        "abstract": "The main challenge for RNAi therapeutics lies in systemic delivery of siRNA to the correct tissues and transporting them into the cytoplasm of targeted cells, at safe, therapeutic levels. Recently, we developed a high-density lipoprotein-mimicking peptide-phospholipid scaffold (HPPS) and demonstrated its direct cytosolic delivery of siRNA in vitro, thereby bypassing endosomal trapping.We investigate the in vivo implementation of HPPS for siRNA delivery.After systemic administration in KB tumor-bearing mice, HPPS prolonged the blood circulation time of cholesterol-modified siRNA (chol-siRNA) by a factor of four, improved its biodistribution and facilitated its uptake in scavenger receptor class B type I overexpressed tumors. For therapeutic targeting to the bcl-2 gene, the HPPS-chol-si-bcl-2 nanoparticles downregulated Bcl-2 protein, induced enhanced apoptosis (2.5-fold) in tumors when compared with controls (saline, HPPS, HPPS-chol-si-scramble and chol-si-bcl-2) and significantly inhibited tumor growth with no adverse effect.HPPS is a safe, efficient nanocarrier for RNAi therapeutics in vivo.",

        "abstract": "High thermoelectric performance of mechanically robust p-type Bi2Te3-based materials prepared by melt spinning (MS) combined with plasma-activated sintering (PAS) method can be obtained with small, laboratory grown samples. However, large-size samples are required for commercial applications. Here, large-size p-type Bi2Te3-based ingots with 30, 40, and 60 mm in diameter are produced by MS-PAS, and the influence of temperature distribution during the sintering process on the composition and thermoelectric properties is systematically studied for the first time. Room-temperature scanning Seebeck Microprobe results show that the large-size ingot is inhomogeneous, induced by ellipsoidal-shape-distributed temperature field during the sintering process, which is verified by finite-element analysis. Although some temperature differences are unavoidable in the sintering process, homogeneity and mechanical properties of ingots can be improved by appropriately extending the sintering time and design of graphite die. Samples cut from ingots attain the peak ZT value of 1.15 at 373 K, about 17% enhancement over commercial zone-melted samples. Moreover, the compressive and bending strengths are improved by several times as well. It is important to ascertain that large-size p-type Bi2Te3-based thermoelectric materials with high thermoelectric performance can be fabricated by MS-PAS.",

        "abstract": "Optically active nanomaterials promise to advance a range of biophotonic techniques through nanoscale optical effects and integration of multiple imaging and therapeutic modalities. Here, we report the development of porphysomes; nanovesicles formed from self-assembled porphyrin bilayers that generated large, tunable extinction coefficients, structure-dependent fluorescence self-quenching and unique photothermal and photoacoustic properties. Porphysomes enabled the sensitive visualization of lymphatic systems using photoacoustic tomography. Near-infrared fluorescence generation could be restored on dissociation, creating opportunities for low-background fluorescence imaging. As a result of their organic nature, porphysomes were enzymatically biodegradable and induced minimal acute toxicity in mice with intravenous doses of 1,000mgkg1. In a similar manner to liposomes, the large aqueous core of porphysomes could be passively or actively loaded. Following systemic administration, porphysomes accumulated in tumours of xenograft-bearing mice and laser irradiation induced photothermal tumour ablation. The optical properties and biocompatibility of porphysomes demonstrate the multimodal potential of organic nanoparticles for biophotonic imaging and therapy. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

But the piles are subjected to compressive load during dewatering after excavation for foundation pit, which is usually the self-weight of underground structure. Since the piles are firstly compressed and then uplifted, the effect of compressive loading on the bearing capacity against uplifting needs to be investigated. In this study full scale loading tests were carried out. And based on the theory of particle flow code in 2 dimensions, a pile with expanded diameter that was firstly compressed and then uplifted in a loading test was studied through numerical simulation, and was compared with the results of actual pile loading tests. By using PFC2D, the time step-displacement curve, the change of particle position and the displacement of particles at different loading stages were also studied. And the load and displacement relations were obtained. The failure behavior of the piles subjected to uplift after compression and only uplift was investigated and compared. For the pile that was subjected to uplift after compression, its pullout bearing capacity was found to be affected significantly due to the breakage of structure of soil during the compressive loading process.",

The goal of the genome-wide scan is to rank all the SNPs based on their association tests or p-values and select the top SNPs. A good ranking procedure ranks the SNPs with true associations as near to the top as possible. This enhances the probability of selecting at least one SNP with a true association. However, if the disease-associated SNPs have moderate genetic effects, the probability that a large number of null SNPs will have extremely small p-values (or large test statistics) is high when screening more than 300K SNPs. Therefore, when selecting a small fraction of top SNPs (usually less than 5%), the probability of select- ing at least one SNP with a true association is usually less than 80% unless the sample size is large. Robust statistics have been proposed to rank all the SNPs (e.g., MAX3 and MIN2). In this article we consider genome-wide scans with a genetic model selection and compare this proposed method to the existing approaches. Results from simulation studies are presented.",

When independent replication samples are not available, the training-testing sets approach is used to validate this procedure and a permutation method is used to obtain its P-value. We applied this method to the X chromosome (with 1804 SNPs) for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We found a window of five SNPs over a 272 kb region associated with AMD after Bonferroni correction. An examination of the odds ratio and the population attributable risks revealed a disease-preventive haplotype, ATGAC, on these five SNPs. For elderly females without this haplotype, the likelihood of AMD is increased by a factor of 4.75 with a 95% confidence interval (1.43, 15.82). The frequency of ATGAC in HapMap CEU is 0.276. These five SNPs are covered by the gene DIAPH2, which is known to cause premature ovarian failure (POF) in females. Our results indicated that DIAPH2 may be a polygenic pleiotropy for POF and AMD.",

Our objective is to evaluate the contribution of functional neuronavigation combined with fMRI and DTT results to surgical outcomes.we investigated 11 patients with small meningiomas located in the atrium of the lateral ventricle who underwent surgery with the aid of functional neuronavigation via the paramedian parieto-occipital approach. The patients willingly underwent assessments of neurologic deficits preoperatively and postoperatively at discharge and at three months after surgery.Gross total resection was achieved in all patients, and no residual or recurrent tumors were observed on follow-up imaging. There was no mortality. Only one patient suffered from transient postoperative aphasia (mild to moderate) that was resolved one week after surgery. No novel neurologic deficits were present in any of the other patients, and no new-onset epileptic attacks were observed.With the aid of the neuronavigation that incorporates fMRI and DTT results, small meningiomas located in the atrium of the lateral ventricle can be safely resected through the paramedian parieto-occipital approach.",

        "abstract": "Selective inversion/excitation based solvent signal suppression techniques are widely used in various NMR experiments because of their high efficiency and general applicability. However, these techniques generate a 'null'/suppression region containing (non-quantitatively) degraded solvent and desired resonances because of their reliance on the rejection of the coherence transfer pathway corresponding to all the resonances within the suppression region. To address this issue, the WaterControl technique was developed by inserting a (pulsed gradient - selective inversion pulse - pulsed gradient) unit into each 'transverse' period of a standard stimulated echo pulse sequence so that the coherence transfer pathways corresponding to both the suppression and non-suppression regions can be selected in one transient. The new sequence affords a diffusion based and quantifiable solvent signal suppression with no or minimal loss of features of interest. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "EB1089 exhibits a high level of antiproliferative activity against various tumors. However, it is not known whether the mechanism of EB1089 induced the growth inhibition in human hepatic-carcinoma. Here we found that EB1089 significantly reduced cell growth in human hepatoma cells (Hep-G2) and blocked Hep-G2 cell-associated tumor formation in nude mice. The growth inhibition was linked to cell cycle G1 phase arrest by the accumulation of p27 and a reduction of Skp2. Knockdown of Skp2 reversed the p27 induction and G1 arrest. Taken together, our data indicate that EB1089 inhibitory activity is associated with alteration of cell cycle checkpoints through Skp2-dependent p27 induction in Hep-G2 cells.",

        "abstract": "The traditional zone melting (ZM) method for the fabrication of state of the art Bi2Te3-based thermoelectric materials has long been considered a time and energy intensive process. Herein, a combustion synthesis known as the thermally induced flash synthesis (TIFS) is employed to synthesize high performance p-type BiSbTe alloys within 20 min compared to tens of hours for the ZM samples. The thermodynamic parameters and phase transformation mechanism during the TIFS process were systematically studied for the first time. TIFS combined with plasma activated sintering (PAS) results in a single phase homogeneous material with excellent repeatability, high thermoelectric performance (maximum ZT ∼ 1.2 at 373 K) and robust mechanical properties in a very short time of less than 20 min. The technologically relevant average ZT value of TIFS-PAS fabricated Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 from 298 K to 523 K is 0.86, about a 46% improvement over the ZM sample. The compressive and bending strength of TIFS-PAS Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 are also improved by about 5 fold compared with those of the ZM samples. Thermoelectric power generation modules assembled using the TIFS-based high performance n and p type materials show the largest thermoelectric conversion efficiency of 5.2% when subjected to a temperature gradient of 250 K, representing about 42% enhancement compared with the commercial ZM-based module. Because of the simplicity and scalability of the process and short synthesis time, the TIFS-PAS technology provides a new and efficient way for large-scale, economical fabrication of Bi2Te3-based thermoelectrics.",

When the data are sampled from families, this trend test can be adjusted to take into account the correlations among family members in complex pedigrees. However, the test depends on the scores based on the underlying genetic model and thus it may have substantial loss of power when the model is misspecified. Since the mode of inheritance will be unknown for complex diseases, we have developed two robust trend tests for case-control studies using family data. These robust tests have relatively good power for a class of possible genetic models. The trend tests and robust trend tests were applied to a dataset of Genetic Analysis Workshop 14 from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism.",

The test results shown that all load is carried by soil until cap was in contact with pile head due to the settlement of cap.Based on that, combined preloading compaction and composite ground method, a new kind of method termed by the author, is presented in this paper. Then numerical analysis was conducted and analysis results shown the gap in this method can make the subgrade soil carry the load first, during this process the subgrade soil beneath the embankment is undergoing preloading, the weight of embankment can be regarded as preload. Then piles join the soil to carry subsequent load after the top-plate settle to be in contact with pile top. The consolidation and the increase of bearing capacity of subgrade consequently can reduce post construction settlement. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNA detection is a valuable method for determining cell identity. Molecular beacons are elegant sensors that can transform intracellular microRNA concentration into a fluorescence intensity. While target binding enhances beacon fluorescence, the degree of enhancement is insufficient for demanding applications. The addition of specialty nucleases can enable target recycling and signal amplification, but this process complicates the assay. We have developed and characterized a class of beacons that are susceptible to the endogenous nuclease Argonaute-2 (Ago2). After purification of the complex by co-immunoprecipitation, microRNA:Ago2 cleavage (miRACle) beacons undergo site- and sequence-specific cleavage, and show a 13-fold fluorescence enhancement over traditional beacons. The system can be adapted to any microRNA sequence, and can cleave nuclease-resistant, non-RNA bases, potentially allowing miRACle beacons to be designed for cells without interference from non-specific nucleases.",

        "abstract": "Top structure and basement will confront the risk of being damaged on account of large stress and strain fields incurred by differential uplift and settlement between inner column and diaphragm wall in top-down method. Top-down excavation of the Metro Line 10 in Shanghai was modeled with finite element analysis software ABAQUS and parameters of subsoil were obtained by inverse analysis. Based on the finite element model and parameters, changes in the following factors were made to find more effective methods to restrain differential uplift and settlement: length of diaphragm wall, thickness of jet-grouting reinforcement layer, ways of subsoil reinforcement, sequence of pit excavation, connection between slabs and diaphragm wall or column and width of pit. Several significant results are acquired. The longer the diaphragm wall is, the greater the differential uplift between column and diaphragm wall is. Rigidity of roof slab is in general not strong enough to keep diaphragm wall and column undergoing the same uplift during excavation; Uplift at head of column and differential uplift between column and diaphragm wall decrease when subsoil from −16.6 to −43 m in pit is reinforced through jet-grouting. But, as excavation proceeds to a lower level, benefit from soil reinforcement diminishes. During the process applying vertical load, the larger the depth of diaphragm wall is, the smaller the settlement is at head of column and diaphragm wall, and the greater the differential settlement is between column and diaphragm wall. When friction connection is implemented between column, diaphragm wall and floor slabs, uplifts at head of column and diaphragm wall are larger than those of the case when tie connection is implemented, and so does differential uplift between column and diaphragm wall. The maximum deflection of diaphragm wall decreases by 58% on account of soil reinforcement in pit. The maximum deflection of diaphragm wall decreases by 61.2% when friction connection is implemented instead of tie connection.",

Current biomimetics for medical applications use a single biomimetic approach to imitate natural structures, which can be insufficient for reconstructing structurally complex natural systems. Multi-pronged efforts may resolve these complexities. To achieve interesting nanostructure-driven optical properties, we engineered a dual-biomimetic system contained within a single nanoagent to recapitulate the efficient light-harvesting organelles, chlorosomes, which have unique dye assemblies and tunable photonic properties. We synthesized a series of chlorin dyes and stabilized these hydrophobic assemblies inside high-density lipoprotein, a second biomimetic that also enabled in vivo utility. This system resulted in tunable tumor imaging of intact (photoacoustic) and disrupted (activatable fluorescence) nanostructures. The successful demonstration of this multi-pronged biomimetic approach opens the door for reconstruction of complex natural systems for biomedical applications.",

But the foundation pit heave often produces adverse effect on the supporting system, for example, it can bring about additional axial force of the solider beam and additional bending moment of the supporting system. The floor slab will collapse if the solider beam loses stability, while the beam and floor slab will crack due to the excessive additional bending moment. Because of the above reasons it is important to predict heave and its effect on the supporting system. By FEM and field measurement, the foundation pit bottom heave and its effect on the floor slab and solider beam were studied. Results showed that the maximal vertical displacement occurred between the retaining structure and the first solider beam away from the retaining structure, and additional bending moment of floor slab was greater when the retaining structure and floor slab were of rigid connection, thus the connection should be strengthened.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In response to the worsening environmental problems, great efforts in photocatalysis degradation of pollutants have been made. Semiconductor nanomaterials are intensively exploited, and variety strategies to achieve efficient charge separation by constructing hybrid nanostructures have been reported. In this work, we propose a new mechanistic strategy to tune the charge transition process of rare-earth compounds that enables substantial improvements in charge separation efficiency. We further elucidates the prospect of applying the hybrid nanostructures of rare-earth compounds and plasmonic metals in photocatalysis. By coupling Eu 2 O 3  nanorods (NRs) with plasmonic metal nanoparticles (NPs), specifically Ag NPs, we observed a dramatically increased photocurrent and evident enhancement in photocatalytic degradation efficiency of RhB, which were attributed to the alternation of charge transition route caused by Agu0027s synergetic effect and the establishment of electromagnetic field induced by the surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) effect. The preparation of Eu 2 O 3  NRs and Eu 2 O 3 /Ag hybrid NRs were conducted under facile and modified synthesis routes. The structures, morphologies and optical properties of as-prepared compounds were intensively characterized.",

It enables doctors to locate sites of cancer/disease, track drug delivery, and guide operative planning, thus enhancing the treatment efficacy. Recently, we developed a multimodal theranostic lipid nanoparticles, named HPPS(NIR)-chol-siRNA with its built-in near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe core as a useful surrogate for tracking small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery. By using the image co-registration of computed tomography (CT) and fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT), we achieved noninvasive assessment and treatment planning of siRNA delivery into the orthotopic tumor, thus enabling efficacious RNA interference (RNAi) therapy. In this chapter, we introduce this method to illustrate the use of CT-FMT co-registration for tracking drug delivery and guiding treatment planning in vivo. ",

Then coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian analyses were performed to gain further insights into the ground movements near a pressurised tunnel front. The simulation results showed good agreements with the test data, and the ground response mechanism was finally made clear.",

        "abstract": "Based on the experimental tests completed before,a concept of piled raft with gap or compressible block (PRGCB) at pile top is developed with conventional piled raft (CPR). PRGCB is expected to reduce post-construction settlement by using part of the embankment as preloading to consolidate the soils surrounding and beneath the piles. FEM simulation of the CFG piled composite ground of the Jing-Jin high speed railway is carried out first,and then piled raft with gap between pile head and raft is analyzed. The interaction between pile and soil and the development of settlement of piled raft with and without gap between pile head and raft are comparatively studied. Experimental tests and numerical results show that with the gap,soil may carry most of the load applied before pile head and raft get in contact. As a result,soils surrounding the upper part of the piles and beneath pile tips may be compacted before the piles start to carry significant load,and thus post-construction settlement may be reduced.",

The sequence was tested on two water-alcohol solvent systems, and a standard lysozyme sample, and with suppression of three or four regions (though it is extendable to any number of regions). The suppression of all solvent signals was possible in the alcohol-water systems tested with both long and short recycle delays, and without the requirement for lengthy pre-saturation pulses. Such a sequence holds promise not only for LC-NMR applications and solvent suppression but for multiple suppression applications in general (e.g., analysis of impurities/components).",

Variation of the substituents at peripheral positions made a significant difference in in vivo efficacy. Among the ether and carbon-carbon linked dimers, the divinyl analogs were found to be most effective. The preliminary in vivo results also suggest that the position(s) of the hydrophilic substituents in the molecules make a remarkable difference in photosensitizing activity.

In this paper, we propose a dynamical approach to SR, which is highly efficient and with finite-time convergence property. First, instead of solving the   $ell _1$   regularized optimization programs that requires exhausting iterations, which is computer-oriented, the solution to SR problem in this paper is resolved through the evolution of a continuous dynamical system which can be realized by analog circuits. Moreover, the proposed dynamical system is proved to have the finite-time convergence property, and thus more efficient than locally competitive algorithm (LCA) (the recently developed dynamical system to solve SR) with exponential convergence property. Consequently, our proposed dynamical system is more appropriate than LCA to deal with the time-varying situations. Simulations are carried out to demonstrate the superior properties of our proposed system.",

The results indicate that embankment stability can be highly overestimated when using the traditional method and the equivalent shear strength method can better reflect the failure mechanism of embankment reinforced with rigid piles. The safety factors by the equivalent load method and the equivalent sand pile method are fairly close to that by the equivalent shear strength method. The pile-soil stress ratio has great influence on the safety factors with the BS 8006 method, the equivalent load method and the friction contact method. It is suggested that more than one simplified method be used when performing the overall stability analysis for embankment supported on composite ground reinforced with unreinforced rigid piles in order to ensure the redundancy of the design.",

A hybrid automaton with delay (HAD) is proposed to model a class of networked control systems with multiple continuous dynamical regimes. Based on the HAD model, the stability for the equilibrium of a networked control system is analyzed, and the sufficient condition of the stability for the equilibrium is also presented, in which, multiple Lyapunov functionals, with respect to the discrete states of the HAD, are non-increasing across the time instants when discrete transitions happen. Furthermore, for the case where the continuous dynamics in the HAD is denoted by a linear time invariant system with delay, the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique is employed to search for a common Lyapunov functional of different discrete states in the HAD and to obtain the upper bound on the system delay remaining stable. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the analysis results.",

        "abstract": "Photothermal therapy (PTT) is enhanced by the use of nanoparticles with a large optical absorption at the treatment wavelength. However, this comes at the cost of higher light attenuation that results in reduced depth of heating as well as larger thermal gradients, leading to potential over- and under-treatment in the target tissue. These limitations can be overcome by using photothermal enhancing auto-regulating liposomes (PEARLs), based on thermochromic J-aggregate forming dye–lipid conjugates that reversibly alter their absorption above a predefined lipid phase-transition temperature. Under irradiation by near-infrared light, deeper layers of the target tissue revert to the intrinsic optical absorption, halting the temperature rise and enabling greater light penetration and heat generation at depth. This effect is demonstrated in both nanoparticle solutions and in gel phantoms containing the nanoparticles.",

        "title": "Model test and numerical analysis of diaphragm wall with hinged joints on both sides",
        "abstract": "When diaphragm is used in the deep excavation with complicated plan as retaining wall, three dimensional behaviors instead of two dimensional behaviors, which is often considered in empirical simplified methods, has two be considered to account for the interaction of neighbor diaphragm wall panels. By using 3D FEM to consider the interaction of neighbor diaphragm wall along with the interaction between wall and soil, the influences of different types of connection between neighbor walls including hinged joints and free end on both sides of the diaphragm wall to the bending moment and displacement of the wall with invariable and changed stiffness is studied. The analyzed results using the method presented in this paper agree well with the experimental test results. The shortages of the empirical methods using 2D FEM are pointed out by comparing the numerical analysis results with model test results. The transverse moment of the wall with hinged joints is analyzed emphatically and calculated results show that significant transverse moment can be generated under such situation and can't be ignored.",

        "abstract": "Flexible (stone columns, sand compaction piles, etc.), semi-rigid [deep mixed (DM) columns, jet-grouted columns, etc.], and rigid (vibro-concrete columns, etc.) columns have been increasingly used to support embankments over soft soils by increasing bearing capacity and stability and reduce total and differential settlements. Field and theoretical studies have demonstrated that columns, no matter whether they have high or low drainage characteristics, can accelerate the rate of consolidation of the composite foundation formed by soft soil and columns. In addition to the permeability of the column, the stiffness of the column contributes to the increased rate of consolidation. This research letter summarizes a three-dimensional numerical study to investigate the consolidation of stone column, DM column, and composite column-reinforced soft foundations. The effects of the modulus, permeability, plastic behavior, and partial penetration of columns on the rate of consolidation were studied. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

MAX was designed specifically to achieve such robustness. In this work, we derived the power calculation formula for MAX and conducted a comprehensive power comparison between MAX and two other commonly used single-marker tests,the one-degree-of-freedom (1-df) Cochran-Armitage trend test and the 2-df Pearson chi2 test. We used a single-marker disease risk model and a two-marker haplotype risk model to explore the performances of the above three tests. We found that each test has its own \"sweet\" spots. Among the three tests considered, MAX appears to have the most robust performance.",

With introduction of Pb at Zn sites, the lattice parameters show an anomalous decrease which can be interpreted by preferential occupation of Pb at interstitial Zn sites. The exciting simultaneous enhancements of both electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient lead to a significant improvement in power factor for samples with low doping content. This improvement is mainly ascribed to the abnormal increase in hole mobility, which is realized by a decreased degree of disorder following introduction of heavier and larger Pb atoms, hampering the migration of “liquid” Zn in local disordered structure. Therefore, the improved power factors combined with intrinsic low thermal conductivity result in  >1.1 for lightly doped samples for  > 600 K, with peak  of 1.2 for the sample doped with 0.5 at.% Pb, representing an approximately 20% improvement compared with the undoped sample. What is more important here is the apparent improvement of high-temperature thermal stability by light Pb-doping, which is beneficial for commercial applications of this promising and cheap material for intermediate-temperature waste heat recovery.",

        "abstract": "Inhibiting specific gene expression with siRNA provides a new therapeutic strategy to tackle many diseases at the molecular level. Recent strategies called high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-mimicking peptide-phospholipid nanoscaffold (HPPS) nanoparticles have been used to induce siRNAs-targeted delivery to expressing cancer cells with high efficiency. Here, eight ideal therapeutic target genes were identified for advanced lung cancer throughout the screenings using endobronchial ultrasonography-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) and the establishment of a personalized siRNA-nanoparticle therapy. The relevance of these genes was evaluated by means of siRNA experiments in cancer cell growth. To establish a therapeutic model,  was selected as a target gene. A total of 356 lung cancers were analyzed immunohistochemically for its clinicopathologic significance. The antitumor effect of HPPS-conjugated siRNA was evaluated  using xenograft tumor models. Inhibition of gene expression for these targets effectively suppressed lung cancer cell growth. SCARB1 was highly expressed in a subset of tumors from the lung large-cell carcinoma (LCC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. High-level KIF11 expression was identified as an independent prognostic factor in LCC and squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) patients. Finally, a conjugate of siRNA against  and HPPS nanoparticles induced downregulation of KIF11 expression and mediated dramatic inhibition of tumor growth  This approach showed delivering personalized cancer-specific siRNAs via the appropriate nanocarrier may be a novel therapeutic option for patients with advanced lung cancer.

We hypothesized that the analysis of gene expression in peripheral\n blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) would demonstrate differences in transcript expression between individuals who develop ISR\n and those who do not.\n \n \n \n \n Methods and Results  We determined and investigated PBMC gene expression of 358 patients undergoing an index procedure to treat in de novo coronary\n artery lesions with bare metallic stents, using a novel time-varying intercept model to optimally assess the time course of\n gene expression across a time course of blood samples. Validation analyses were conducted in an independent sample of 97 patients\n with similar time-course blood sampling and gene expression data. We identified 47 probesets with differential expression,\n of which 36 were validated upon independent replication testing. The genes identified have varied functions, including some\n related to cellular growth and metabolism, such as the NAB2 and LAMP genes.\n \n \n \n \n Conclusions  In a study of patients undergoing bare metallic stent implantation, we have identified and replicated differential gene expression\n in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, studied across a time series of blood samples. The genes identified suggest alterations\n in cellular growth and metabolism pathways, and these results provide the basis for further specific functional hypothesis\n generation and testing of the mechanisms of ISR.",

        "abstract": "Low bilirubin levels are significantly associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In previous genome-wide linkage studies we identified a major locus on chromosome 2q harboring the candidate gene UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1). The activity of this enzyme is significantly influenced by a TA-repeat polymorphism in the promoter of the gene. In a prospective study individuals with genotype (TA)7/(TA)7 had significantly higher bilirubin levels and approximately one-third the risk of CVD as carriers of the wildtype (TA)6 allele. In the present study we performed a conditional linkage study to investigate whether this polymorphism explains the observed linkage peak and extended our analysis by a genome-wide association study on bilirubin levels in 1345 individuals.After adjustment for the bilirubin variance explained by this polymorphism, the LOD score on chromosome 2q dropped from 3.8 to 0.4, demonstrating that this polymorphism explains the previous linkage result. For the genome-wide association study, the closest marker to UGT1A1 was in the top ranking SNPs. The association became even stronger when we considered the TA-repeat polymorphism in the analysis (p=2.68 x 10(-53)). Five other SNPs in other regions reached genome-wide significance without obvious connection to bilirubin metabolism.Our studies suggest that UGT1A1 may be the major gene with strong effects on bilirubin levels and the TA-repeat polymorphism might be the key polymorphism within the gene controlling bilirubin levels. Since this polymorphism has a high frequency and a substantial impact on the development of CVD, the gene might be an important drug target.",

        "abstract": "The basic concept and procedure of digital in-line holography are shown mainly for particle diameter measurement. The result of the reconstructed image and the particle diameter measurement are affected by some recording parameters, i.e. recording distance, particle density, the size of CCD chip and the pixel size, etc. These recording parameters may even determine the success or failure of the measurement. Two parameters, recording distance and particle density, are mainly discussed for particle diameter measurement through computer simulation. The range of recording distance is given by formula. Simultaneously, a kind of method for particle diameter measurement based on gray gradient by extracting particle edge is put forward and verified by experiment.",

        "abstract": "Chlorosomes are vesicular light-harvesting organelles found in photosynthetic green sulfur bacteria. These organisms thrive in low photon flux environments due to the most efficient light-to-chemical energy conversion, promoted by a protein-less assembly of chlorin pigments. These assemblies possess collective absorption properties and can be adapted for contrast-enhanced bioimaging applications, where maximized light absorption in the near-infrared optical window is desired. Here, we report a strategy for tuning light absorption towards the near-infrared region by engineering a chlorosome-inspired assembly of synthetic metallochlorins in a biocompatible lipid scaffold. In a series of synthesized chlorin analogues, we discovered that lipid-conjugation, central coordination of a zinc metal into the chlorin ring and a 3(1)-methoxy substitution were critical for the formation of dye assemblies in lipid nanovesicles. The substitutions result in a specific optical shift, characterized by a bathochromically-shifted (74 nm) Qy absorption band, along with an increase in absorbance and circular dichroism as the ratio of dye-conjugated lipid was increased. These alterations in optical spectra are indicative of the formation of delocalized excitons states across each molecular assembly. This strategy of tuning absorption by mimicking the structures found in photosynthetic organisms may spur new opportunities in the development of biophotonic contrast-agents for medical applications.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinicopathologic factors associated with false-negative rate of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer, and to explore how to reduce the false-negative rate of SLNB.The clinicopathological data of 2265 patients with invasive breast carcinoma who underwent sentinel lymph nodes biopsy (SLNB) in Shandong Cancer Hospital between November 1999 and December 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. We screened 1228 patients who received axillary lymph node dissection after SLNB, and studied the clinicopathological factors that could be associated with false-negative rate of SLNB.The false negative rate of this group was 10.7% (73/683), accuracy rate was 94.1% (1155/1228), and negative predictive value was 88.2% (545/618). Clinical tumor size (all P < 0.05), calendar year of surgery (all P < 0.05) and numbers of detected SLNs (all P < 0.05) were significantly related with false negative rate and accuracy rate of SLNB, determined by single factor analysis. Logistic regression model analysis showed that calendar year of surgery (P = 0.034) and numbers of detected SLNs (P = 0.012) were independent predictive factors for the false negative rate of SLNB.False negative rate and accuracy rate of SLNB are significantly related to the calendar year of surgery and number of detected SLNs. Strict case selection, standard operation procedure, increaseing numbers of detected SLNs, and improvement of the skill of operators are effective measures to reduce the false negative rate of SLNB.",

        "abstract": "When the earth pressure balance shield machine(EPBM) advances through in soft ground，it is essential to optimize the driving parameters so that the surface settlement induced by tunneling meets the requirement of deformation. The EPBM driving parameters including advance speed，ground surface settlement were measured from a greenfield site of the shield tunneling section between Jianguo road station and Tianjin railway station of metro line 2. Based on the field measured data，a 3D finite element model was established to analyze the tunneling impact on the surrounding soil. The numerical results agreed well with the measure data of the greenfield site and thus the model was verified. Furthermore，the sensitivity analysis of the ground settlement to the parameters was conducted under the normal construction condition. Fault tree basic events were derived from the key driving parameters during tunneling and then the quantitative risk analysis was performed. The results showed that the value of the key driving parameters varied with the shield advance speed. The parameters were also related with each other. Moreover，the risk factors were ordered based on the sensitivity and risk of the ground settlement，under the condition that the normal advance speed was approximately 30 mm/min. Therefore，the ground settlement induced by tunneling could be fine controlled according to the order of the risk factors.",

In order to obtain the optimal regularization parameter, according to regularization parameter selection strategy of Morozov discrepancy principle and based on differential evolution algorithm, an optimization method of regularization parameter within the global range is proposed. This method begins from a solution set of regularization parameter, iteratively calculated by three kinds of operation rules. According to the objective function value of each solution, gradually the search process is guided to approach the optimal solution. Computer simulation data of unimodal, bimodal and wide distribution particles were inversed by this method respectively. The results show that this method has strong tolerance of noises, when the noise level is 0.0000-0.0010, results of unimodal and wide distribution particles agree with the theory distribution, the double-peak feature of bimodal distribution particles is clear, and the maximum error of the inversion peak is less than 5%. Therefore, it is an effective optimization method for regularization parameter in particle size inversion of PCS.",

Methods Hemoglobin(Hb) level,plasma EPO level and urine Albumin/creatinine ratio(ACR) were determined and glomerular filtration rate(GFR) was estimated by simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease(MDRD)equation in 72 AMI patients and in 44 controls which had no heart diseases. Results The prevalence of anemia in AMI patients was significantly higher than in controls(44.4% vs.13.6%,P<0.001).Anemia was more common in female,small body mass index,pre-existing diabetes mellitus,hypertension heart and renal failure AMI patients.EPO levels were significantly higher in anemic subjects than in non-anemic subjects [(25.12±2.19)U/L vs.(15.84±1.91)U/L,P<0.05],while the difference of observed/predicted lgEPO(O/P) ratio between these two groups was not significant.Correlation was observed between Hb and Killip class(r=-0.447,P<0.001),serum Creatine(r=-0.448,P<0.01),GFR(r=0.603,P<0.001) and lgACR(r=-0.502,P<0.01). Conclusions Anemia is common in AMI patients,hemoglobin level could be considered on as a severity index of AMI.Renal disfunction can aggravate anemia,but the reduced EPO level is not a main cause of anemia in AMI patients.",

In practice, piles are increasingly introduced to reinforce the soft soil to achieve the stability of the embankment. Limited research has been conducted so far on the stability of piled-embankments on soft soil especially the failure mechanism. Three-dimensional FDM numerical analyses were performed in this study for an embankment supported by rigid piles. The lateral behavior of piles at different locations relative to the toe of the embankment was investigated. To evaluate possible soil flow, a single pile was placed under the embankment subjected to an additional load up to a limit equilibrium state. The numerical results showed that an increase of the applied load on the top of the embankment increased the soil deformation under the embankment, and eventually caused the soil flow around the pile.",

        "abstract": "Four different extraction processes, namely sulfuric acid treatment, sodium hydroxide treatment, sequential treatment with sulfuric acid followed by sodium hydroxide and sequential treatment with trypsin followed by sulfuric acid were used to obtain total dietary fiber (TDF) from tomato skin, a byproduct of the tomato paste industry. The physicochemical properties (water-holding capacity, oil-holding capacity, swelling capacity, cation-exchange capacity and bile salt adsorption capacity) of the obtained TDF products were determined. Among the four extraction processes, sequential treatment with trypsin followed by sulfuric acid gave the best removal of impurities and the resultant product presented the highest soluble dietary fiber content and the best color. The proximate chemical composition and physico-chemical properties of the TDF products obtained using the four extraction processes were obviously different from those of the raw material. Both the TDF products obtained by sodium hydroxide treatment alone and in combination with sulfuric acid treatment had higher water-holding capacity (7.85 g/g and 8.7 4 g/g, respectively) and swelling capacity (4.9 mL/g and 5.5 mL/g, respectively), and the oil-holding and bile salt adsorption capacities of those obtained by sulfuric acid treatment alone and in combination with trypsin treatment were both high, reaching up to 5.49 g/g and 5.91 g/g, and 297.3 mg/g and 329.4 mg/g, respectively. Except sequential treatment with trypsin followed by sulfuric acid, all the three other extraction processes yielded TDF products with a cation exchange capacity higher than that of the raw material.",

        "abstract": "A recent metaanalysis shows that 0.7% of nanoparticles are delivered to solid tumors. This low delivery efficiency has major implications in the translation of cancer nanomedicines, as most of the nanomedicines are sequestered by nontumor cells. To improve the delivery efficiency, there is a need to investigate the quantitative contribution of each organ in blocking the transport of nanoparticles to solid tumors. Here, we hypothesize that the removal of the liver macrophages, cells that have been reported to take up the largest amount of circulating nanoparticles, would lead to a significant increase in the nanoparticle delivery efficiency to solid tumors. We were surprised to discover that the maximum achievable delivery efficiency was only 2%. In our analysis, there was a clear correlation between particle design, chemical composition, macrophage depletion, tumor pathophysiology, and tumor delivery efficiency. In many cases, we observed an 18-150 times greater delivery efficiency, but we were not able to achieve a delivery efficiency higher than 2%. The results suggest the need to look deeper at other organs such as the spleen, lymph nodes, and tumor in mediating the delivery process. Systematically mapping the contribution of each organ quantitatively will allow us to pinpoint the cause of the low tumor delivery efficiency. This, in effect, enables the generation of a rational strategy to improve the delivery efficiency of nanoparticles to solid tumors either through the engineering of multifunctional nanosystems or through manipulation of biological barriers.",

The axial forces of piles are measured. The detailed displacement fields of soil and piles are obtained by analyzing the digital pictures. Based on this, the failure mode and deformation behavior of the piled raft are studied. The effect of pile spacing and pile length on the settlement beneath pile tip and shaft resistance of pile is analyzed. Test results show that pile spacing is the major factor which has significant effect on the slip at the interface of pile shaft and surrounding soil. The piled foundation with bigger pile spacing produces larger pile – soil slip and pile tip penetration. The central pile under comparatively flexible raft can produce larger pile – soil slip and pile tip penetration than that of edge piles when pile spacing is large enough. The pile tip penetration accounts for most part of the settlement of piled raft with larger pile spacing. This implies that it’s necessary to construct a theory, where the pile tip penetration should be taken into account, to calculate the settlement of piled raft with large pile spacing. By laying a layer of sand cushion, compressible block, or simply a gap between raft and pile head to make it possible for the soil beneath raft to carry load first, the soil beneath the raft can be compacted before piles begin to carry load significantly and thus can reduce the pile-soil slip and pile tip penetration and even change the failure mode.",

        "abstract": "Chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) is a widespread natural mineral, composed of earth-abundant and nontoxic elements. It has been considered a promising n-type material for thermoelectric applications. In this work, a series of Zn-doped Cu1–xZnxFeS2 (x = 0–0.1) compounds are synthesized by vacuum melting combined with the plasma activated sintering process. The role of Zn in the chalcopyrite and its different effects on thermoelectric properties, depending on its concentration and location in the crystal lattice, are discussed. It is found that Zn is an effective donor which increases the carrier concentration and improves the thermoelectric properties of CuFeS2. When the content of Zn exceeds the solubility limit, Zn partially enters the Cu sites and forms in situ ZnS nanophase. This, in turn, shifts the balance between the anion and cation species which is re-established by the formation of antisite Fe/Cu defects. Beyond maintaining charge neutrality of the structure, such antisite defects relieve the lattice strain in the matrix and increase the solubility of Zn further. The highest ZT value of 0.26 is achieved at 630 K for Cu0.92Zn0.08FeS2, which represents an enhancement of about 80% over that of the pristine CuFeS2 sample.",

The mathematical model of the quadrotor is derived using the Euler-Newton formalism with extended assumptions on disturbing aerodynamical forces (not necessary uniformly bounded). The proposed control demonstrates an enhanced robustness against such disturbances. The comparison between the classical controller and the proposed one is demonstrated analytically, through Lyapunov theory, and in simulations to validate the proposed sliding mode control algorithm.",

        "abstract": "As the structural basis of blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCB), epithelial cells in the choroid plexus (CP) are targets for lead (Pb). Pb is known to accumulate in the CP; however, the mechanism of Pb uptake in the choroidal epithelial cells remains unknown. Recently, hemichannels of Connexin 43 (Cx43), the most ubiquitously expressed gap junction proteins in the CP, were found to be important pathways for many substances. This study was designed to investigate the roles of Cx43 in Pb uptake in the epithelial cells. Autometallography was used to outline Pbu0027s subcellular location, and the characteristics of Pb transport into CP cells, including concentration- and time-dependence were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Knockdown/overexpression of Cx43 with transient siRNA/plasmids transfections before Pb exposure diminished/increased the Pb accumulation. In the Z310 cell-based doxycycline-inducible Cx43 expression cell line (iZCx43), doxycycline induced a significant increase (3-fold) in Pb uptake, corresponding to the increased Cx43 levels. Activation of Cx43 hemichannels by reduced serum conditions caused an increase of Pb concentrations. Cx43-induced Pb uptake was attenuated after blockage of Cx43 hemichannels with its inhibitor, carbenoxolone. Additionally, down-regulation of Cx43 protein levels by Pb exposure paralleled cellular Pb concentrations in the time study. Concomitantly, expressions of phosphor-Src and phosphor-Erk were both significantly increased by Pb. However, inactivation of Erk, not Src pathway, reversed Pb-induced downregulation of Cx43. Taken together, these data establish that Pb can accumulate in the BCB and validate the role of Cx43 hemichannel in Pb uptake and its regulations through Erk phosphorylation.",

The minimal distance between the AF and the lesion (D(1)), preoperative AQ (AQ(1)), the minimal distance between the AF and the surgical cavity (D(2)), and the postoperative AQ (AQ(2)) were measured. Linear correlation analysis was conducted between D(1) or D(2) and the corresponding AQ(1) or AQ(2) to assess the relationship between the AF and language function. The language function of each patient was evaluated postoperatively.The AF was successfully reconstructed in all the cases. The tractography results of the identical AF generated by 3 different users showed good congruency. A positive linear correlation was demonstrated between D(1) and AQ(1) (P<0.001) and between D(2) and AQ(2) (P=0.001). Only two patients (4.7%) showed language deficits at postoperative follow-up.AF navigation is a reliable and accurate technique for AF reconstruction and localization and helps to preserve the language function after surgical removal of lesions in the language area of the brain.",

        "abstract": "Lead (Pb) has long been recognized as a neurodevelopmental toxin. Developing blood-brain barrier (BBB) is known to be a target of Pb neurotoxicity; however, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Recent evidence suggests that intracellular nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase Src regulates tight junctional proteins (TJPs). This study was designed to investigate whether Pb acted on the Src-mediated cascade event leading to an altered TJP expression at BBB. Rats aged 20-22 days were exposed to Pb in drinking water (0, 100, 200, and 300 ppm Pb) for eight weeks. Electron microscopic and Western blot analyses revealed a severe leakage of BBB and significantly decreased expressions of TJP occludin and ZO-1. When cultured brain endothelial RBE4 cells were exposed to 10μM Pb for 24 h, expressions of phosphor-Src and an upstream regulator GRP78 were significantly increased by 6.42-fold and 8.29-fold (p < 0.01), respectively. Inactivation of Src pathway by a Src-specific inhibitor reversed Pb-induced downregulation of occludin, but not ZO-1; small interfering RNA knockdown of GRP78 attenuated Pb-induced Src phosphorylation and occludin reduction. Furthermore, Pb exposure caused redistribution of GRP78 from endoplasmic reticulum to cytosol and toward cell member. However, the data from immunoneutralization studies did not show the involvement of cell-surface GRP78 in regulating Src phosphorylation upon Pb exposure, suggesting that the cytosolic GRP78, rather than cell-surface GRP78, was responsible to Pb-induced Src activation and ensuing occludin reduction. Taken together, this study provides the evidence of a novel linkage of GRP78, Src activation to downregulation of occludin, and BBB disruption during Pb exposure.",

Three possible scenarios that may arise are investigated here: (i) heterogeneity of genotype frequencies across unidentified subpopulations (PSI), (ii) heterogeneity of genotype frequencies and disease risk across unidentified subpopulations (PSII), and (iii) cryptic correlations within unidentified subpopulations. A unified approach is presented for deriving the bias and variance distortion under the three scenarios for any CATT in a general family. Using these analytical formulas, we evaluate the excess type I errors of the CATTs numerically in the presence of population substructure. Our results provide insight into the properties of some proposed corrections for bias and variance distortion and show why they may not fully correct for the effects of population substructure.",

        "abstract": "We report a new class of photodynamic molecular beacon (PMB) with tumor specific mRNA-triggered control of singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) production. The beacon contains a single-stranded oligonucleotide linker that forms a stem-loop structure (hairpin) in which the sequence is an antisense oligonucleotide (AS-ON) complementary to a target mRNA. The stem is formed by the annealing of two complementary arm sequences that are on either side of the loop sequence. A photosensitizer molecule (PS) is attached to the end of one arm and a quencher (Q) is similarly attached to the other end. The conformationally-restricted hairpin forces Q to efficiently silence the photoreactivity of PS. In the presence of target mRNA, the hairpin opens and the PS is no longer silenced. Upon irradiating with light, the PS then emits fluorescence and generates cytotoxic (1)O(2). To show proof of concept, we have synthesized a c-raf-1 mRNA-triggered PMB using pyropheophorbide (Pyro) as PS, carotenoid as Q and c-raf-1 mRNA-targeted AS-ON as the loop sequence. We show that the (1)O(2) production of Pyro is quenched in its native state by 15-fold and is restored 9-fold by the addition of the target RNA. Comparing this to our recently reported self-folding peptide linker-based PMB, the hairpin effect results in an enhanced (1)O(2) quenching efficiency that decreases the residual (1)O(2) production by over 3-fold, thus providing enhanced control of (1)O(2) production upon target-linker interactions. When incubated with c-raf-1 expressing MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, the PMB displayed efficient cellular uptake and subsequently effective PDT activation in targeted cells.",

By using a recursive algorithm, sufficient conditions (easy testable) are proposed for guaranteeing the backward and the algebraic observability of the system. This condition implies that the trajectories of the system can be reconstructed by using the actual and past values of the system output.",

        "abstract": "A new type of piled raft was developed with the gap between pile top and raft. It could be adopted to adjust the raft-pile-soil interaction and to reduce differential settlement of buildings. Model tests on piled raft in sand with and without the gap between pile top and raft were carried out. It was shown that the sand among piles with the gap between pile top and raft was compacted earlier than that of conventional piled raft foundation under the same load. The compaction of sand among piles could increase the load carried by soil and at the same time reduce the penetration of pile tip. This would make piles and soil settle together. Piled raft with the gap between pile top and raft could mobilize the bearing capacity of soil effectively, in the meantime reduce the stress concentration at pile top and enhance the bearing resistance of pile tip.",

        "abstract": "In genetic studies of complex diseases, the underlying mode of inheritance is\noften not known. Thus, the most powerful test or other optimal procedure for\none model, e.g. recessive, may be quite inefficient if another model, e.g.\ndominant, describes the inheritance process. Rather than choose among the\nprocedures that are optimal for a particular model, it is preferable to see a\nmethod that has high efficiency across a family of scientifically realistic\nmodels. Statisticians well recognize that this situation is analogous to the\nselection of an estimator of location when the form of the underlying\ndistribution is not known. We review how the concepts and techniques in the\nefficiency robustness literature that are used to obtain efficiency robust\nestimators and rank tests can be adapted for the analysis of genetic data. In\nparticular, several statistics have been used to test for a genetic association\nbetween a disease and a candidate allele or marker allele from data collected\nin case-control studies. Each of them is optimal for a specific inheritance\nmodel and we describe and compare several robust methods. The most suitable\nrobust test depends somewhat on the range of plausible genetic models. When\nlittle is known about the inheritance process, the maximum of the optimal\nstatistics for the extreme models and an intermediate one is usually the\npreferred choice. Sometimes one can eliminate a mode of inheritance, e.g. from\nprior studies of family pedigrees one may know whether the disease skips\ngenerations or not. If it does, the disease is much more likely to follow a\nrecessive model than a dominant one. In that case, a simpler linear combination\nof the optimal tests for the extreme models can be a robust choice.",

Current HNC staging has inadequate accuracy and low sensitivity for effective diagnosis and treatment management. The multimodel porphyrin lipoprotein-mimicking nanoplatform (PLP), intrinsically capable of positron emission tomography (PET), fluorescence imaging, and photodynamic therapy (PDT), shows great potential to enhance the accuracy of HNC staging and potentially HNC management.Using a clinically relevant VX-2 buccal carcinoma rabbit model that is able to consistently develop metastasis to regional lymph nodes after tumor induction, we investigated the abilities of PLP for HNC diagnosis and management.PLPs facilitated accurate detection of primary tumor and metastatic nodes (their PET image signal to surrounding muscle ratios were 10.0 and 7.3, respectively), and provided visualization of the lymphatic drainage from tumor to regional lymph nodes by both pre-operative PET and intra-operative fluorescence imaging, allowing the identification of unknown primaries and recurrent tumors. PLP-PDT significantly enhanced cell apoptosis in mouse tumors (73.2 % of PLP-PDT group versus 7.1 % of PLP alone group), and demonstrated complete eradication of primary tumors and obstruction of tumor metastasis in HNC rabbit model without toxicity in normal tissues or damage to adjacent critical structures.PLPs provide a multimodal imaging and therapy platform that could enhance HNC diagnosis by integrating PET/CT and fluorescence imaging, and improve HNC therapeutic efficacy and specificity by tailoring treatment via fluorescence-guided surgery and PDT.",

        "abstract": "The underconsolidated soils in reclaimed land have low strength and high compressibility, resulting in susceptibility to excessive settlement and associated negative effects, which can be controlled by grouting. However, there is little research on the mechanism of grouting in underconsolidated soil, compared with the normally consolidated or overconsolidated soil. In this study, we present a series of laboratory grouting tests to investigate the grouting mechanism and the effect of degree of consolidation, soil type, load increment ratio and initial overlying load on the grouting performance. The results showed that the influence of grouting on primary consolidation settlement for underconsolidated soil included the heave effect, the additional settlement due to the dissipation of excess pore water pressure induced by grouting and the reduced settlement due to the increased modulus induced by grouting. However, grouting in underconsolidated soil had no influence on the secondary consolidation settlement. Grouting in underconsolidated soil with low degree of consolidation could obtain a shorter time of primary consolidation and a higher final grouting efficiency in primary consolidation stage. The final grouting efficiency in primary consolidation stage increased linearly with increasing load increment ratio, but decreased with increasing initial overlying load. As the overconsolidation ratio increased, the final grouting efficiency in primary consolidation stage decreased for underconsolidated soil, dropping to the lowest value for normally consolidated soil and then increased for the overconsolidated soil, reaching a limit. Moreover, the peak grouting pressure was proportional to the vertical effective stress at the beginning of grouting.",

In this study, we show that thiol-water proton exchange can also generate quantifiable CEST effects under near-physiological conditions (pH = 7.2 and 37°C) through the characterization of the pH dependence of thiol proton exchange in phosphate-buffered solutions of glutathione, cysteine, and N-acetylcysteine. The spontaneous, base-catalyzed, and buffer-catalyzed exchange contributions to the thiol exchange were analyzed. The thiol-water proton exchange of glutathione and cysteine was found to be too fast to generate a CEST effect around neutral pH due to significant base catalysis. The thiol-water proton exchange of N-acetylcysteine was found to be much slower, yet still in the fast-exchange regime with significant base and buffer catalysis, resulting in a 9.5% attenuation of the water signal at pH 7.2 in a slice-selective CEST NMR experiment. Furthermore, the N-acetylcysteine thiol CEST was also detectable in human serum albumin and agarose phantoms.",

Although there is substantial literature on the effects of stress on memory from behavioral and pharmacologic perspectives, the effects of cold stress on learning and memory were little addressed. The aims of the present work were to investigate the effects of acute cold exposure on Y-maze learning and the activation of cerebral MAPK cascades of rats. We found that the 2-hour cold exposure (-15 degrees C) and a subsequent 30-min rewarming significantly increased the performance of the rats in the Y-maze test. Serum corticosterone (CORT) level was increased after the cold exposure. After a transient reduction following the cold exposure, the P-ERK levels in the hippocampus and PFC drastically increased 30 min later. The levels of P-JNK increased gradually after the cold exposure in all the three brain regions we investigated, but the level of P-p38 only increased in the PFC. The levels of GABAA receptor alpha1 subunit remained unchanged after the cold exposure. Furthermore, the performance of rats treated with cold plus muscimol or bicuculline in the Y-maze test was similar to that of the rats treated with those GABAergic agents alone. These results demonstrated that acute cold exposure and the subsequent rewarming could result in enhanced performance of spatial learning and memory, and the activation of MAPKs in the brain. However, GABAA receptor may not be involved in the acute cold exposure-induced enhancement of memory.",

The simulation signal of the dynamic light scattering can be acquired by this method. The light scattering signals of 10 nm and 90 nm, 200 nm and 1000 nm with bimodal distribution particles are respectively simulated by the computer. The autocorrelation function of the simulated light intensity is nearly identical to its theory autocorrelation function. The relative error of inverting particle size by double exponential is less than 3.55%. Analyzing influence of parameters such as the module order, sample time, sample frequency, simulation data length on simulation precision, the relation of simulation precision and parameters can be drawn. When the order is lower than the threshold order, the simulation precision is highly affected by the module order. The simulation precision will increase with the increase of the module. When the order is higher than the threshold order, the simulation precision is lowly affected by the module order. Therefore, the threshold order can be used in simulation. Selecting the certain sample time, the simulation date length and simulation percision will increase with the increase of the sample freguency.",

        "abstract": "The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-guided focal laser therapy has shown early promise in Phase 1 trial treating low/intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer (PCa), but the lack of tumor selectivity and low efficiency of heat generation remain as drawbacks of agent-free laser therapy. Intrinsic multifunctional porphyrin-nanoparticles (porphysomes) have been exploited to treat localized PCa by MRI-guided focal photothermal therapy (PTT) with significantly improved efficiency and tumor selectivity over prior methods of PTT, providing an effective and safe alternative to active surveillance or radical therapy.The tumor accumulation of porphysomes chelated with copper-64 was determined and compared with the clinic standard (18) F-FDG in an orthotropic PCa mouse model by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, providing quantitative assessment for PTT dosimetry. The PTT was conducted with MRI-guided light delivery and monitored by MR thermometry, mimicking the clinical protocol. The efficacy of treatment and adverse effects to surround tissues were evaluated by histology analysis and tumor growth in survival study via MRI.Porphysomes showed superior tumor-to-prostate selectivity over (18) F-FDG (6:1 vs. 0.36:1). MR thermometry detected tumor temperature increased to ≥55°C within 2 min (671 nm at 500 mW), but minimal increase in surrounding tissues. Porphysome enabled effective PTT eradication of tumor without damaging adjacent organs in orthotropic PCa mouse model.Porphysome-enabled MRI-guided focal PTT could be an effective and safe approach to treat PCa at low risk of progression, thus addressing the significant unmet clinical needs and benefiting an ever-growing number of patients who may be over-treated and risk unnecessary side effects from radical therapies.

        "abstract": "The inclined pile under vertical load may yield large horizontal displacement, deflection and bending moment. Consequently, bending failure may happen before the ultimate bearing capacity of vertical pile provided by soils is fully mobilized. Based on the field test results, numerical simulations are carried out to analyze the influence of surface soil improvement on the behavior and capacity of inclined piles. The results indicate that the depth, area and location relative to the pile of the treated soil may affect the behavior and failure mechanism of inclined piles under vertical load. The improvement of shallow soils can provide significant lateral support to piles and thus reduce their horizontal displacement. In addition, the treated soils can reduce the rotation and deflection of piles. Both of the two effects can prevent the inclined piles from bending failure before penetration failure happens. Large elastic modulus of the treated soils can better reduce the horizontal displacement, deflection and bending moment of piles under vertical load. However, there is an optimum value, i.e., when the elastic modulus is larger than it, the reinforcement effect no longer increases.",

This approach may not be appropriate if the trait, on its original or transformed scales, does not follow a normal distribution. A rank-based nonparametric approach that does not rely on any distributional assumptions can be an attractive alternative. Although several nonparametric tests exist in the literature, their performance in the genetic association setting is not well studied. We evaluate various nonparametric tests for the analysis of quantitative traits and propose a new class of nonparametric tests that have robust performance for traits with various distributions and under different genetic models. We demonstrate the advantage of our proposed methods through simulation study and real data applications.",

        "abstract": "For the globally inclined piles without initial bending stress, the bearing capacity behaviors of inclined piles with different inclinations under vertical load were studied with the model tests. The test results show that when the degree of inclination of pile is not larger than 4%, the settlement of the inclined pile is smaller than that of the vertical pile under the same vertical load, and the bearing capacity of the inclined pile is not smaller than that of the vertical pile. However, when the degree of inclination of pile reaches 8%, the settlement of the inclined pile is larger than that of the vertical pile under the same vertical load and the loading has to be stopped due to the bending failure of pile. The similar results were obtained by performing numerical analysis. Further numerical analysis indicates that there are two thresholds, namely settlement threshold and failure mode threshold, of degree of inclination of pile in terms of settlement and failure mode, respectively. When the degree of inclination of pile is larger than settlement threshold, the settlement of the inclined pile is larger than that of the vertical pile under the same vertical load. When the degree of inclination of pile is not larger than failure mode threshold, the bearing capacity of inclined pile is mainly determined by lateral resistance and tip resistance of pile. When the degree of inclination of pile is larger than failure mode threshold, pile will be subjected to bending failure due to excessive bending moment yielded in pile. The soil conditions, bending stiffness and strength of the inclined pile, constraint conditions at pile top, etc, can all affect the value of thresholds.",

In order to reduce the impact of DOF, an auto-focusing algorithm for accurate location of particle was proposed based on the most gradient. In the focus window containing particle, the gradients in all possible directions were calculated. Then, all of the possible gradients were compared, and the largest gradient was chosen as the result. At the same time, in order to improve the precision and stability of auto-focusing algorithm, another threshold parameter was introduced to eliminate the interference caused by background information and noise. Through experiments, we find out that the auto-focusing algorithm has the strong single peak feature and good stability.",

The nanoparticles were J-aggregating porphysomes (JNP) comprising self-assembling, all-organic porphyrin-lipid micelles with a molar absorption coefficient of 8.7×108  cm−1 M−1 at this wavelength. The PA signal intensity versus JNP areal concentration followed a sigmoidal curve with a reproducible linear range of ∼17  fmol/mm2 to 11  pmol/mm2, i.e., ∼3 orders of magnitude with ±34% error. For physiologically-relevant conditions (i.e., optical scattering-dominated tissues: transport albedo >0.8) and JNP concentrations above ∼330  fmol/mm2, the PA signal depends only on the nanoparticle concentration. Otherwise, independent measurement of the optical absorption and scattering properties of the underlying tissue is required for accurate quantification. The implications for surface PA imaging, such as in the use of targeted nanoparticles applied topically to tissue as in endoscopic diagnosis, are considered.",

The auditory nerve-brainstem evoked responses (ABR) was recorded and the morphological changes of the outer hair cells (OHCs) were observed with Phallodin-FITC staining. In addition, the integrity of the blood-labyrinth barrier was observed by TEM and the expression of tight junction proteins (TJPs) in the cochlear stria vascularis was determined by immunofluorescence. Our results showed that Pb(2+) exposure resulted in increased ABR threshold in both rats and guinea pigs. Abnormal shapes and loss of OHCs were found in the cochlear basilar membrane following the Pb(2+) exposure. TEM study showed that the tight junctions between the endothelial cells and the border cells were lost and disrupted. Down-regulation of the occludin, ZO-1 and claudin-5 in the stria vascularis suggested that the increased permeability of the blood-labyrinth barrier may attribute to the Pb(2+)-induced decrease of TJPs' expression. Additionally, Fe(2+) supplement partly reversed the Pb(2+)-induced hearing loss and down-regulation of TJPs. Taken together, these data indicate that the disruption of blood-labyrinth barrier by down-regulating the expression of TJPs plays a role in the Pb(2+)-induced hearing loss, and Fe(2+) supplement protects the auditory system against Pb(2+)-induced toxicity and may have significant clinical implications.",

        "abstract": "Targeted molecular probes offer the potential for greater specificity in cancer imaging with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). We investigate a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) nanoparticle loaded with poly-iodinated triglyceride (ITG) in a proof of concept study of targeted x-ray imaging. LDLs are targeted to the LDL cell surface receptor (LDLR), which is overexpressed in several tumor types. The LDL-LDLR pathway presents a high-capacity and self-renewing transport system for molecular imaging in CT.ITG was synthesized and loaded into the core of LDL particles to form a reconstituted nanoparticle, hereafter referred to as (rITG)LDL. Particle size was measured by dynamic light scattering. The x-ray attenuation of the (rITG)LDL solution was measured with CT imaging and signal enhancement was calibrated for equivalent iodine concentration. Cultured human hepatoblastoma G2 (HepG2) cells, which overexpress LDLR, were incubated with (rITG)LDL with or without native LDL. The cells were imaged with CT to characterize particle sequestration.Reconstitution of LDL with ITG was successful and did not compromise the targeting function of the particle. Measurement of the x-ray attenuation properties of the (rITG)LDL solution revealed an effective iodine concentration of 0.78 mg/mL. In vitro studies of HepG2 cells demonstrated a significant increase in CT image intensity over control cells when incubated with (rITG)LDL.The in vitro results of this study suggest that (rITG)LDL can provide adequate image enhancement for CT molecular imaging. Potential applications include breast imaging and small animal imaging at low x-ray energies. In vivo experiments will be required to verify that tumor uptake of (rITG)LDL is sufficient for enhanced detection. Use at higher x-ray energies, as used in conventional CT, will require a further increase in iodine loading.",

We report herein a novel FAP-triggered photodynamic molecular beacon (FAP-PPB) comprising a fluorescent photosensitizer and a black hole quencher 3 linked by a peptide sequence (TSGPNQEQK) specific to FAP. FAP-PPB was effectively cleaved by both human FAP and murine FAP. By use of the HEK293 transfected cells (HEK-mFAP, FAP(+); HEK-vector, FAP(-)), systematic in vitro and in vivo experiments validated the FAP-specific activation of FAP-PPB in cancer cells and mouse xenografts, respectively. FAP-PPB was cleaved by FAP, allowing fluorescence restoration in FAP-expressing cells while leaving non-expressing FAP cells undetectable. Moreover, FAP-PPB showed FAP-specific photocytotoxicity toward HEK-mFAP cells whereas it was non-cytotoxic toward HEK-Vector cells. This study suggests that the FAP-PPB is a potentially useful tool for epithelial cancer detection and treatment.",

A field measurement was performed and measurement data shown the deep excavation could produce significant effect on adjacent piles. It was shown that the lateral displacement of DMM wall behind the contiguous retaining piles could be larger than that of contiguous retaining piles with large pile spacing. Great attention should be paid to this phenomenon. Based on the field observation, the influences of various parameters on pile response due to adjacent excavation were studied with three-dimensional finite element model taking into account the distances between diaphragm walls and piles, pile rigidity, vertical load on pile-head and constraint condition of pile-head. Some suggestions for the design and construction were given.",

        "abstract": "Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common type of cancer worldwide and remains challenging for effective treatment due to the proximity to critical anatomical structures in the head and neck region, which increases the probability of toxicity from surgery and radiotherapy, and therefore emphasizes the importance of maximizing the targeted ablation. We have assessed the effectiveness of porphysome nanoparticles to enhance fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging of head and neck tumors in rabbit and hamster models. In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness of this agent for localized photothermal ablative therapy of head and neck tumors. We have demonstrated that porphysomes not only enabled fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging of buccal and tongue carcinomas, but also allowed for complete targeted ablation of these tumors. The supremacy of porphysome-enabled photothermal therapy over surgery to completely eradicate primary tumors and metastatic regional lymph node while sparing the adjacent critical structuresu0027 function has been demonstrated for the first time. This study represents a novel breakthrough that has the potential to revolutionize our approach to tumor diagnosis and treatment in head and neck cancer and beyond.",

        "abstract": "A new 8-pulse Phase Modulated binomial-like selective inversion pulse sequence, dubbed '8PM', was developed by optimizing the nutation and phase angles of the constituent radio-frequency pulses so that the inversion profile resembled a target profile. Suppression profiles were obtained for both the 8PM and W5 based excitation sculpting sequences with equal inter-pulse delays. Significant distortions were observed in both profiles because of the offset effect of the radio frequency pulses. These distortions were successfully reduced by adjusting the inter-pulse delays. With adjusted inter-pulse delays, the 8PM and W5 based excitation sculpting sequences were tested on an aqueous lysozyme solution. The 8 PM based sequence provided higher suppression selectivity than the W5 based sequence. Two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments were also performed on the lysozyme sample with 8PM and W5 based water signal suppression. The 8PM based suppression provided a spectrum with significantly increased (~ doubled) cross-peak intensity around the suppressed water resonance compared to the W5 based suppression.

When obtaining the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of θ in the presence of λ requires intensive computation, the pseudo MLE of θ, based on a pseudo likelihood function, can be used. Gong and Samaniego (Ann. Stat. 9:861–869, 1981) proposed a pseudo MLE (PMLE) based on simple random samples. Ranked set sampling has been applied to the bivariate variables\n (X,Y) where measuring one of the variables is difficult or costly. In this paper, we obtain the pseudo MLE of the correlation\n coefficient from a bivariate normal distribution (X,Y) based on ranked set samples, assuming that Y is difficult or more expensive to measure and that the mean and variance of Y are the nuisance parameters. The PMLE is compared with three other estimators of the correlation coefficient. Simulations\n show that the PMLE is more (less) efficient than other estimators, depending on value of ρ. Testing of soil contamination provides an example of the use of the methods.",

        "abstract": "The two-stage design is a common cost-effective approach for genome- wide association studies. The first stage serves as a screening to identify a subset of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 100,000 to 500,000 SNPs using a fraction of case-control samples. In the second stage, only the selected SNPs are genotyped using the remaining case-control samples. On the other hand, DNA pooling is another common strategy to save genotyping cost. In this article, we propose a method using DNA pooling in the first stage and genotype-based analysis in the second stage. A joint analysis to combine both stages is applied to a two-stage design with DNA pooling when the underlying genetic model is known. When the genetic model is unknown, we use a robust procedure in the joint analysis by applying genetic model selection in the second stage based on the difference of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium coefficients between cases and controls. Performance of our method and comparison with other approaches are investigated by simulation studies.",

        "abstract": "Process of shield driven in Tianjin Metro Line No.1 project is simulated by means of finite element method. Pressures and shearing forces are enforced on the soils to simulate the real reactions between shield driven machine and the surrounding soil during tunneling. Results from the model adopted here by the finite element method are fine agreement with those acquired in the Tianjin Metro Line No.1 project. Researches on the effects of shield driven tunneling on the pile foundation nearby are carried out with this model. The settlement at pile top and displacement along pile caused by shield driven tunneling nearly reach their maximum values during the process when the shield driven machine is approaching the pile; when it is leaving away from the pile, the increments of settlement and displacement are small. Under the same conditions, settlement at the top of long pile is small because the side resistances at the lower part of long pile can be exploited to a great extend. During the process of tunneling, pile with the length of 12 m inclines while piles with the length of 16m and 19 m bend and the maximum moments are at the position 12-13 m below the ground. During tunneling, there are back and forth displacements at pile top along the direction in which the tunnel is pushed forward. The greater the load applied at pile top, the larger the settlement caused by tunneling at pile top.",

        "abstract": ": To investigate Porphysome fluorescence image-guided resection (PYRO-FGR) for detection of uterine tumour, metastatic lymph nodes and abdominal metastases in a model of endometrial cancer. : White New Zealand rabbits were inoculated with VX2 cells via intra-myometrial injection. At 30 days, Porphysomes were administered intravenously. At 24 h the abdomen was imaged and fluorescent tissue identified (PYRO-FGR). After complete resection of fluorescent tissue, fluorescence-negative lymph nodes and peritoneal biopsies were removed. Histopathology including ultra-staging and analysis by a pathologist was used to detect tumour. Fluorescence signal to background ratio (SBR) was calculated and VX2 (+) tissue compared to VX2 (-) tissue. Biodistribution was calculated and Porphysome accumulation in fluorescent VX2 (+) tissue compared to fluorescent VX2 (-) and non-fluorescent VX2 (-) tissue. : Of 17 VX2 models, 10 received 4 mg/kg of Porphysomes and 7 received 1 mg/kg. Seventeen tumours (UT), 81 lymph nodes (LN) and 54 abdominal metastases (AM) were fluorescence-positive and resected. Of these, 17 UT, 60 LN and 45 AM were VX2 (+), while 16 LN and 5 AM were VX2 (-). Nine specimens were excluded from analysis. Thirty-one LN and 53 peritoneal biopsies were fluorescence-negative and resected. Of these, all LN and 51/53 biopsies were VX2 (-) with only 2 false-negative biopsies. Sensitivity and specificity of PYRO-FGR for VX2 (+) tissue was 98.4% / 80.0% overall, 100% / 100% for UT, 100% / 66.0 % for LN and 95.7% / 91.4% for AM. Increased SBR and biodistribution was observed in VX2 (+) tissue vs. VX2 (-) tissue. : Porphysomes are a highly sensitive imaging agent for intra-operative detection and resection of uterine tumour, metastatic lymph nodes and abdominal metastases.",

We combined therapeutic and imaging functions in one agent, choosing photodynamic therapy (PDT) as an appropriate cancer treatment modality. This agent induces photodamage in irradiated cells and simultaneously identifies apoptotic cells by near-infrared fluorescence. This photodynamic therapy agent with a built-in apoptosis sensor (PDT-BIAS) contains a fluorescent photosensitizer used as an anticancer drug, connected to a fluorescence quencher by a caspase-3 cleavable peptide linker. We demonstrated that cleavage of the peptide linker by caspase-3, one of the executioner caspases involved in apoptosis, results in a detectable increase of fluorescence in solution and in cancer cells after PDT treatment. The apoptosis involvement and drug effectiveness were confirmed by Apoptag and cell viability (MTT) assays supporting the ability of PDT-BIAS to induce and image apoptosis in situ.",

        "abstract": "Core peptide is a hydrophobic peptide derived from the T-cell antigen receptor-alpha chain (TCR-alpha) transmembrane region with therapeutic potential. The mechanism by which the peptide inserts into the membrane, including any requirements to change conformational or association states during the insertion, is unclear. Here, the self-association and secondary structure of Core peptide in aqueous solution and in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles were examined using various nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. NMR diffusion measurements were performed on 0.05, 1, and 5 mM Core peptide in D2O. These samples had pH values varying from 3 to 4. A constant measured diffusion coefficient of 2 X 10(-10) m2 s(-1) was observed in these samples indicating that Core peptide was monomeric. Multidimensional NMR experiments (i.e., TOCSY and NOESY) revealed the formation of beta-strands in water at low pH and random coil in DPC micelles. The results of this study reveal that at relatively low pH, the insertion mechanism must involve Core peptide in the monomeric state but it undergoes a conformational transition during membrane insertion.",

In practice, leaky aquifers are more and their flow to well will reach steady soon, while the pump discharge often is unsteady after begin. The discharge in the steady flow is substitute into Hantush-Jacob leaky aquifer model; then the extended Kalman filter is used to compute the parameters such as transmissivity, storage coefficient and leakage coefficient.

        "abstract": "The effect of lead (Pb) on spatial memory and hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) as a key risk factor has been widely recognized and the oxidative damage has been proposed as a possible mechanism of lead neurotoxicity. Selenium (Se) is a nutritionally essential trace element with known antioxidant potential. In this study we investigated the effect and the underlying mechanisms of Se supplementary on Pb induced cognition and synaptic plasticity impairment. Lactating Sprague-Dawley rats (SD rats) were randomly divided to four groups: 0ppm lead acetate (Pb); 0ppm Pb and 0.2ppm sodium selenite (Se); 100ppm Pb; 100ppm Pb and 0.2ppm Se. Lactating rats were treated with or without Pb and/or Se throughout lactation until weaning. The levels of hippocampal LTP, the spatial memory, the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and the serum level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were assayed. It had been observed that in Pb group the spatial memory, the induce level of LTP, the serum SOD level decreased, the LDH release level, the neurons apoptosis level, the serum MDA level increased, while in the Se supplements groups, the spatial memory, the induce level of LTP increased significantly. Compared with the Pb group, Se supplements shown down regulated the level of LDH, the neurons apoptosis and the serum MDA, and up regulated the level of serum SOD. We could draw the conclusion that Se supplements could alleviate toxic effect of lead on hippocampal LTP and spatial memory. The treated with selenium around 0.2ppm may protect against spatial memory dysfunction induced by lead exposure.",

        "abstract": "Case-control studies are commonly used to study whether a candidate allele and a disease are associated. However, spurious association can arise due to population substructure or cryptic relatedness, which cause the variance of the trend test to increase. Devlin and Roeder derived the appropriate variance inflation factor (VIF) for the trend test and proposed a novel genomic control (GC) approach to estimate VIF and adjust the test statistic. Their results were derived assuming an additive genetic model and the corresponding VIF is independent of the candidate allele frequency. We determine the appropriate VIFs for recessive and dominant models. Unlike the additive test, the VIFs for the optimal tests for these two models depend on the candidate allele frequency. Simulation results show that, when the null loci used to estimate the VIF have allele frequencies similar to that of the candidate gene, the GC tests derived for recessive and dominant models remain optimal. When the underlying genetic model is unknown or the null loci and candidate gene have quite different allele frequencies, the GC tests derived for the recessive or dominant models cannot be used while the GC test derived for the additive model can be.",

However, the natural sedimentary soils generally behave differently from reconstituted soils due to the effect of soil structure. A series of laboratory grouting tests were conducted to research the effect of soil structure on the performance of compensation grouting. The effects of grouting volume, overlying load and grouting location on the performance of compensation grouting under different soil structures were also studied. Reconstituted soil was altered with added cement to simulate artificial structured soil. The results showed that the final grouting efficiency was positive and significantly increased with the increase of stress ratio within a certain range when grouting in normally consolidated structured clay. However, in the same low yield stress situation, the artificial structured soil had a lower final grouting efficiency than the overconsolidated reconstituted soil. The larger of normalized grouting volume could increase the final grouting efficiency for both reconstituted and artificial structured soils. Whereas, the effect of the overlying load on final grouting efficiencies was unfavourable, and was independent of the stress ratio. As for the layered soil specimens, grouting in the artificial structured soil layer was the most efficient. In addition, the peak grouting pressure was affected by the stress ratio and the overlying load, and it could be predicted with an empirical equation when the overlying load was less than the yield stress. The end time of primary consolidation and the proportion of secondary consolidation settlement varied with the different soil structures, grouting volumes, overlying loads and grouting locations.",

To characterize FRET deactivation of singlet oxygen generation, we attached various quenchers to the photosensitizer pyropheophorbide-alpha (Pyro) using a lysine linker. The linker did not induce major changes in the properties of the photosensitizer. Absorbance and emission wavelength maxima of the quenched constructs remained constant, suggesting that quenching by ground-state complex formation was minimal. All quenchers sharing moderate spectral overlap with the fluorescence emission of Pyro (J > or = 5.1 x 10(13) M(-1) cm(-1) nm4) quenched over 90% of the singlet oxygen, and quenchers with weaker spectral overlap displayed minimal quenching. A self-quenched double Pyro construct exhibited intermediate quenching. Consistent with a FRET deactivation mechanism, extension of the linker to a 10 residue polyproline peptide resulted in only the quenchers with spectral overlap almost 2 orders of magnitude higher (J > or = 3.7 x 10(15) M(-1) cm(-1) nm4) maintaining high quenching efficiency. Overall, there was good correlation (0.98) between fluorescence quenching and singlet oxygen quenching, implying that fluorescence intensity can be a convenient indicator for the singlet oxygen production status of activatable photosensitizers. Uniform singlet oxygen luminescence lifetimes of the compounds, along with minimal triplet state transient absorption were consistent with quenchers primarily deactivating the photosensitizer excited singlet state. In vitro, cells treated with well-quenched constructs demonstrated greatly reduced PDT induced toxicity, indicating that FRET-based quenchers can provide a level of quenching useful for future biological applications. The presented findings show that FRET-based quenchers can potently decrease singlet oxygen production and therefore be used to facilitate the rational design of activatable photosensitizers.",

Cement–fly ash–gravel piles were used in this project. A coupled two-dimensional mechanical and hydraulic numerical model was used for this analysis and the results are compared with the field measurements including settlement, load distribution between soil and pile, and excess pore pressure. The numerical model calculated the settlement profile close to that measured in the field. The proportion of the load carried by the soil was small thus significantly reducing the settlement. The stress transfer from the soil to the piles reduced the excess pore pressure effectively. A parametric study was conducted to investigate the influence of three key factors on the performance of the embankment. The parametric study indicated that the existence of a cushion reduced the shear force in the slab. The increase in slab thickness and pile stiffness increased the shear force and bending moment in the slab. An increase in pile stiffness reduced the settlement and lateral displacement of the embankment.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to define and characterize carbocyanine labeled low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to be used in the optical imaging of LDL receptor (LDLr)-overexpressing tumor models.1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) was used to label LDL (DiI-LDL). Scatchard plots were generated to determine the maximum binding capacity B(max) and dissociation constants K(D) of DiI-LDL in B16 melanoma (B16) and hepatoblastoma G(2) (HepG(2)) cell lines. Selective uptake of DiI-LDL into both tumor cells and corresponding subcutaneous tumors in mice were demonstrated by confocal microscopy and three-dimensional Cryo-imaging, respectively.The labeling efficiency of DiI-LDL was 61 ng DiI/microg LDL protein (34 mol DiI/mol LDL protein). B(max) and K(D) for B16 cells were 6.311 ng LDL/mg cell protein and 60.38 microg protein/mL (117 nM), respectively. B(max) and K(D) were 7.573 ng LDL/mg cell protein and 26.79 microg protein/mL (52 nM) for HepG(2) cells, respectively. Confocal microscopic images showed specific uptake of DiI-LDL throughout the cytoplasm in the B16/HepG(2) cells. Cryo-imaging demonstrated preferential accumulations of DiI-LDL in the viable tumor regions of both B16 and HepG(2) tumors compared with their adjacent normal tissues and corresponding necrotic tumor regions. In addition, uptake of DiI-LDL by the HepG(2) tumor was much higher than that of the B16 tumor, consistent with the fact that the probe binding affinity for LDLrs of HepG(2) cells is 2.3 times that of B16 cells.This study suggested that carbocyanine labeled LDL could be used for optical imaging of tumors overexpressing LDLr.",

When the J columns are nominal, Pearson's test should be considered. On the other hand, when the J columns are ordinal and the ordering is well defined, the trend test should be used. In practice, however, the columns are often ordered but the ordering may not be uniquely defined, especially the J categories may be ordered in multiple ways according to several different factors. We assume that the columns could be either singly or multi-ordered, either being scientifically plausible, and consequently different scores could be assigned to the columns by the different ordering systems. Then the trend test, if applied, may lose substantial power when the orderings are misspecified. To guard against misspecifications of the scores for the columns, we propose a robust test by combining strengths of both Pearson's test and the trend test. In the trend test, we allow several different score specifications according to different ordering criteria and the scores are chosen to be robust enough. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the efficiency robustness of the proposed approach. The proposed method is applied to two data sets from the Genetic Association Workshop 15 and an experiment on the use of sulfones and streptomycin drugs in the treatment of leprosy.",

        "abstract": "Problems continue to be encountered concerning the traditional vacuum preloading method in field during the treatment of newly deposited dredger fills. In this paper, an improved multiple-vacuum preloading method was developed to consolidate newly dredger fills that are hydraulically placed in seawater for land reclamation in Lingang Industrial Zone of Tianjin City, China. With this multiple-vacuum preloading method, the newly deposited dredger fills could be treated effectively by adopting a novel moisture separator and a rapid improvement technique without sand cushion. A series of model tests was conducted in the laboratory for comparing the results from the multiple-vacuum preloading method and the traditional one. Ten piezometers and settlement plates were installed to measure the variations in excess pore water pressures and moisture content, and vane shear strength was measured at different positions. The testing results indicate that water discharge–time curves obtained by the traditional vacuum preloading method can be divided into three phases: rapid growth phase, slow growth phase, and steady phase. According to the process of fluid flow concentrated along tiny ripples and building of larger channels inside soils during the whole vacuum loading process, the fluctuations of pore water pressure during each loading step are divided into three phases: steady phase, rapid dissipation phase, and slow dissipation phase. An optimal loading pattern which could have a best treatment effect was proposed for calculating the water discharge and pore water pressure of soil using the improved multiple-vacuum preloading method. For the newly deposited dredger fills at Lingang Industrial Zone of Tianjin City, the best loading step was 20 kPa and the loading of 40–50 kPa produced the highest drainage consolidation. The measured moisture content and vane shear strength were discussed in terms of the effect of reinforcement, both of which indicate that the multiple-vacuum preloading method has a better treatment effect not only in decreasing the moisture content and increasing the bearing capacity, but also in increasing the process uniformity at different depths of foundation.",

        "abstract": "Manganese is an essential trace element required for normal development and bodily functions. However, exposure of the brain to excessive amounts of manganese results in neurotoxicity. Although previous studies examining manganese neurotoxicity have focused on neuronal injury, especially direct injury to dopaminergic neurons, the effects of manganese-induced neurotoxicity on glial cells have not been reported. The current study was designed to examine the effect of manganese on microglial activation, and the underlying mechanism of manganese-induced dopaminergic neuronal injury in vivo. We established an animal model of manganism by intrastriatal injection of MnCl(2).4H(2)O into male Sprague-Dawley rats. One day after administration of manganese, a few microglial cells in the substantia nigra (SN) were activated, although the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive neurons in the SN was unaffected. Seven days after administration of manganese, a marked reduction in the number of TH-immunoreactive neurons was observed in the SN, and the majority of microglial cells were activated. We found that manganese upregulated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene expression, as well as iNOS, TNF-alpha, and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) protein levels in the SN. Furthermore, treatment with minocycline, an inhibitor of microglial activation, attenuated microglial activation and mitigated IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and iNOS production as well as dopaminergic neurotoxicity induced by manganese. These results suggested that dopaminergic neurons could be damaged by manganese neurotoxicity, and that the activated microglial cells and their associated activation products played an important role in this neurodegenerative process.",

Materials & methods: Bchl-BOA was encapsulated in the nanoparticle low-density lipoprotein (LDL), a native particle whose receptor's overexpression is a cancer signature for a number of neoplasms. Evaluation of r-Bchl-BOA-LDL as a potential photosensitizer was performed using a tumor response and foot response assay. Results & discussion: When compared with controls, tumor regrowth was significantly delayed at injected murine doses of 2 μmole/kg r-Bchl-BOA-LDL after illumination at fluences of 125, 150 or 175 J/cm2. Foot response assays showed that although normal tissue toxicity accompanied the higher fluences it was significantly reduced at the lowest fluence tested. Conclusion: This research demonstrates that r-Bchl-BOA-LDL is an effective photosensitizer and a promising candidate for further investigation. © 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.",

Materials are playing a central role in the development of biophotonics. New materials, fabrication methods, and structures are enabling new biosensors, contrast agents, imaging strategies, and assay methods. Similarly, biologic materials themselves can be used in photonic devices.

Moreover, the size of LDL particle is precisely controlled (approximately 22 nm) by its apoB-100 component, setting them apart from liposomes and lipid micelles. LDL particles have long been proposed as a nanocarrier for targeted delivery of diagnostics and therapeutics to LDL receptor (LDLR)-positive cancers. Here, we report the design and synthesis of a novel naphthalocyanine (Nc)-based photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent, SiNcBOA, and describe its efficient reconstitution into LDL core (100:1 payload). Possessing a near-infrared (NIR) absorption wavelength (> 800 nm) and extremely high extinction coefficient (> 10(5) M(-1)cm(-1)), SiNcBOA holds the promise of treating deeply seated tumors. Reconstituted LDL particles (r-Nc-LDL) maintain the size and shape of native LDL as determined by transmission electron microscopy, and also retain their LDLR-mediated uptake by cancer cells as demonstrated by confocal microscopy. Its preferential uptake by tumor vs normal tissue was confirmed in vivo by noninvasive optical imaging technique, demonstrating the feasibility of using this nanoparticle for NIR imaging-guided PDT of cancer.",

        "abstract": "Test statistics for association between markers on autosomal chromosomes and a disease have been extensively studied. No research has been reported on performance of such test statistics for association on the X chromosome. With 100,000 or more single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) available for genome-wide association studies, thousands of them come from the X chromosome. The X chromosome contains rich information about population history and linkage disequilibrium. To identify X-linked marker susceptibility to a disease, it is important to study properties of various statistics that can be used to test for association on the X chromosome. In this article, we compare performance of several approaches for testing association on the X chromosome, and examine how departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium would affect type I error and power of these association tests using X-linked SNPs. The results are applied to the X chromosome of Klein et al. [2005], a genome-wide association study with 100K SNPs for age-related macular degeneration. We found that a SNP (rs10521496) covered by DIAPH2, known to cause premature ovarian failure (POF) in females, is associated with age-related macular degeneration.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Constructing a tunnel by means of an Earth Pressure-Balanced Machine (EPBM) requires an appropriate definition of the relevant variables to minimize the environmental impact. Because of the complexities and uncertainties of underground engineering, however, the values of the EPBM variables assumed in the design stage are often inappropriate, and adjustments are required based on  in situ  observations. In this paper, the Multistage Regulation Strategy is applied to the displacement control during the construction of two overlapped tunnels in Tianjin Metro line 5 underneath a pre-existing railway line, and the EPBM variables are continuously adjusted based on works in progress. The core of the Multistage Regulation Strategy is the so-called target decomposition (as each tunnelling stage requires its control target), which is accomplished based on the tunnelling work at a nearby site (test zone, beside the railway line), whose instrumentation is presented in detail. By rigorously applying MRS, the surface settlements along the railway line passing over the two metro tunnels can be successfully controlled through a step-by-step adjustment of EPBM variables, and the requirements concerning the accumulated surface settlements specified by the current design standards can easily be fulfilled.",

Three-dimension surface morphology, surface wettability, bovine serum albumin adsorption rate, cell morphology, cell proliferation and ALP activity of three tested materials were measured. There were no significant differences in surface roughness, contact angle among the three materials. The ALP expression of NANOZR was higher than CpTi and 3Y-TZP at 14 and 21 days although bovine serum albumin adsorption rate, cell morphology; and cell proliferation was not different among the three materials. These results suggest that the three test materials basically had similar surface characterization and bioactivity. Within the limitations of this study, our results show that the three test materials were biologically similar bio-inert materials.",

When the linear estimation and nonlinear least squares method are combined, double exponential algorithm is improved. By improving algorithm the initialization parameters are reduced and four parameters optimization problem are changed into two parameters optimization problem so that fitness results is more stability, higher accuracy. Therefore the inverted results of particle size are more accurate. The autocorrelation function of light scattering signal of 100 nm and 1000 nm with two-peak distribution particles is inverted. Inverted error of improving algorithm for noise-free autocorrelation function is zero, which is superior to double exponential algorithm of at least 1.708%. For inversion of noise autocorrelation function, improving algorithm reduces the error of 0.558%~5.738%. The results show that the improving algorithm is better than double exponential algorithm in the capability of optimization and tolerance of noises.",

The method could be used to compute beams on Winkler foundation under complex conditions, such as variable Young's modulus and section, complex foundation conditions, namely variable bedding modulus, and complex load consisting of concentrated force, moment and randomly distributed load. The displacement equations both for beam elements and for the whole beam, which had the same structure with the classic solution by Winkler, could be derived from the proposed method. Therefore, the equations for angular rotation, moment and shear of the beams could also be obtained from their differential relationship with displacement equation. It was shown by the computation of an example that the results obtaind by the proposed method were consistent with those by the classic finite element method when the elements were small enough. Furthermore, the element partition in the proposed method was thoroughly different from that in the classic finite element method.",

The factors that how distribution of soil layers influences the basal stability in layered soils are investigated. Two correction methods for the traditional basal stability analysis methods based on homogeneous ground assumption in layered soils are proposed, i.e. weighted average method considering arc length and weighted average method considering arc length and normal stress. Through the calculations of engineering examples, it is found that the results of the weighted average method considering soil layer thickness are far from the actual condition, but the two correction methods, especially the latter, can obtain a result that is close to that predicted by the layered integration method, and can better reflect the effect of soil layers beneath formation of excavation on the basal stability, and what's more, the calculation process is simple and convenient. The calculated results indicate that the lower layer of sliding surface is extremely important for basal stability, so it's better to embed the supporting structure fully or partially to the comparatively hard soil layer.",

To further study the extrinsic probe Pyro-2DG, the characteristic of Pyro-2DG uptake by the liver tissue of rats and the distribution of Pyro-2DG in various tissues were detected using the Cryo-Imager. The result indicated that Pyro-2DG uptake by the liver resulted in the metabolic state shift towards an increased concentration of oxidized electron carriers and it completely recovered after 24hrs. Pyro-2DG with infusion injection could avoid the oxidized damage of the normal tissue induced by Pyro-2DG uptake. The distribution of Pyro-2DG in various normal tissues indicated that Pyro-2DG could be as a tumor special near infrared ray (NIR) probe besides the hepatic tumor and lymph system tumor.",

        "abstract": "Local disease control is a major challenge in pancreatic cancer treatment, because surgical resection of the primary tumor is only possible in a minority of patients and radiotherapy cannot be delivered in curative doses. Despite the promise of photothermal therapy (PTT) for focal ablation of pancreatic tumors, this approach remains underinvestigated. Using photothermal sensitizers in combination with laser light irradiation for PTT can result in more efficient conversion of light energy to heat and improved spatial confinement of thermal destruction to the tumor. Porphysomes are self-assembled nanoparticles composed mainly of pyropheophorbide-conjugated phospholipids, enabling the packing of ∼ 80,000  porphyrin photosensitizers per particle. The high-density porphyrin loading imparts enhanced photonic properties and enables high-payload tumor delivery. A patient-derived orthotopic pancreas xenograft model was used to evaluate the feasibility of porphysome-enhanced PTT for pancreatic cancer. Biodistribution and tumor accumulation were evaluated using fluorescence intensity measurements from homogenized tissues and imaging of excised organs. Tumor surface temperature was recorded using IR optical imaging during light irradiation to monitor treatment progress. Histological analyses were conducted to determine the extent of PTT thermal damage. These studies may provide insight into the influence of heat-sink effect on thermal therapy dosimetry for well-perfused pancreatic tumors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) materials are promising for a wide range of applications from templating nanomaterials to drug delivery and separations technologies. Hexagonal phases of LLCs are made of cylindrical aggregates arranged on a hexagonal lattice. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) or small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) are typically used to measure the cylinder radius and hexagonal lattice parameter and hence a characteristic dimension ratio, e.g., ratio of hexagonal lattice parameter to the cylinder radius. Unlike SAXS or SANS, pulsed gradient spin-echo nuclear magnetic resonance (PGSE NMR) diffusion measurements probe much larger length scales. Probing porous systems via restricted diffusion (i.e., diffusion diffraction) is limited to μm dimensions by available gradient strengths, but analysis of diffusion obstruction and anisotropy permit probing smaller dimensions. PGSE NMR measurements of self-diffusion coupled with simple random walk simulations and obstruction models can be used to find a ‘diffusion-averaged’ characteristic dimension ratio to better represents diffusive properties in macroscopically aligned samples. Random walk simulations and experimental diffusion ellipsoids were used with structural obstruction models to determine ‘diffusion-averaged’ characteristic dimension ratios for aligned LLC hexagonal phases of non-ionic surfactants using different probe molecules and these were compared to SAXS obtained values presented elsewhere.",

The new sequence provides a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the (Hahn spin-echo based) MAXY-D sequence at long diffusion times, and thus potentially affords better diffusion measurements on macromolecule samples. Based on multi-quantum coherence encoding, the MQ-PGSTE sequence needs considerably lower gradient strengths for diffusion characterization compared to standard single quantum pulsed gradient spin-echo sequences. By using the new sequence, the diffusion coefficient of l-[3-(13)C]-alanine was found to be 8.1+/-0.1 x 10(-10)m(2)s(-1), which is in line with the value obtained by the use of the standard stimulated echo based pulsed gradient spin-echo sequence.",

In the analysis of genome-wide association (GWA) studies, extreme BF values support the associations detected based on significant p-values. Results from recent GWA studies are presented, which show that existing BFs may not be consistent withp-values when a robust test is used due to using different genetic models in the BF and p-value approaches and this may result in misleading conclusions. Two hybrid BFs, which combine the advantages of both the frequentist and Bayesian methods, are then proposed for the markers showing at least moderate associations (p-value",

The case when the matrix pencil is non-regular is comprised (i.e., more than one solution for the differential equation is allowed). It is shown that, under suitable assumptions, the original problem can be studied by means of a regular (non-singular) linear system with unknown inputs and algebraic constraints. Thus, it is shown that for purposes of analysis, the algebraic equations can be included as part of an extended system output. Based on this analysis, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing the observability (or detectability) of the system in terms of the zeros of the system matrix. Corresponding algebraic conditions are given in order to test the observability and detectability. A formula is provided that expresses the state as high order derivative of a function of the output, which allows for the reconstruction of the actual state vector. It is shown that the unknown inputs may be reconstructed also.",

        "abstract": "This article proposes a simple Ku-band wind and rain backscatter model at low-incidence angles for describing sea surfaces where rain is present. The data used consisted of the sea surface backscatter and averaged rain rates from Tropical Rainfall Mapping Mission precipitation radar TRMM PR measurements and the collocated 10 m height numerical prediction wind speeds from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. From the rain effect analysis, it was found that the surface backscatter decreases with increases in the averaged rain rate. The rain-induced backscatter was clearly dependent of the wind speed and was slightly dependent of the incidence angle. On the basis of the analysis, the wind and rain backscatter model was simply defined as the sum of a wind backscatter model and a rain backscatter model. The wind backscatter model was provided with the given Ku-band low-incidence backscatter model. The rain-induced backscatter for specific incidence angles and wind speeds was modelled as a simple quadratic polynomial function of the averaged rain rate by using the collocated datasets. The wind and rain backscatter model was validated by other parts of the collocated datasets. Results showed that the new model-predicted total backscatter had a root mean square error of 1.02 dB and a correlation coefficient r of 0.73 with the collocated TRMM PR-measured rain-affected surface backscatter. Compared to the single wind backscatter model, the wind and rain backscatter model significantly improved the prediction accuracy for the surface backscatter in rain.",

Since part of the railway is over soft marine clay, appropriate ground improvement, cement-fly ash-gravel piles, was selected to improve the soft marine clay to meet technical requirements for the high-speed railway. This article presents the field measurements in the railway embankment project including the load distribution between soils and piles, excess pore pressure, and settlement and lateral displacement. The test results show that the stress concentration to the piles reduced the excess pore pressure effectively. The proportion of the load carried by soils was small, and thus the settlement was significantly reduced. The compression of the rigid piles contributed to less than 21% of the total settlement. The majority of the settlement was contributed by the penetration of the piles and the compression of the soft soil below the pile tips. The average compression thickness below the pile tips was 22m, which is equivalent to one times the width of the treated area. The measured differential settlement of the embankment was approximately 3mm. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Afterward, pedigree cluster method and corresponding process for clay micro-structure parameters are put forward to classify geometrical characters, and anisotropy coefficient is defined to evaluate significance of geometrical anisotropy. Studies on some SEM photos, taken in horizontal, vertical and 45° inclined planes from a layered soil sample, show that the anisotropy coefficient calculated by the average distance method is almost the same as that by the centrobaric distance method. In addition, the conclusion drawn by the pedigree cluster method is consistent with that by the principal component analysis method, and it illustrates that the geometrical anisotropy of the layered soil is distinct.",

        "abstract": "Kraft et al. [2005] proposed a method for matched haplotype-based association studies and compared the performances of six analytic strategies for estimating the odds ratio parameters using a conditional likelihood function. Zhang et al. [2006] modified the conditional likelihood and proposed a new method for matched haplotype-based association studies. The main assumptions of Zhang et al. were that the disease was rare, the population was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), and the haplotypes were independent of the covariates and matching variable(s). In this article, we modify the estimation procedure proposed by Zhang et al. and introduce a fixation index so that the assumption of HWE is relaxed. Using the Wald test, we compare the current modified method with the procedure developed by Kraft et al. through simulations. The results show that the modified method is uniformly more powerful than that described in Kraft et al. Furthermore, the results indicate that the modified method is quite robust to the rare disease assumption.",

        "abstract": "A first example of spirochlorin-chlorin dimer with fixed distances and orientations as potential model for the \"special pair\" of the photosynthetic reaction center is discussed. For the preparation of such a novel structure, the Wittig reagent of the desired \"spacer\" 5 was reacted with photoprotoporphyrin IX dimethyl ester 3 to produce the intermediate dimer 6, which on intramolecular [4 + 2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition gave an unexpected spirochlorin-chlorin dimer 9. Dehydration of dimer 6 under acid-catalyzed conditions generated the corresponding spirochlorin-porphyrin dimer 16 in quantitative yield. The asymmetry in dimer 6 caused by the biphenyl-type anisotropic effect was confirmed by NMR and model studies. The formation of dihydrobenzoporphyrin 14 by reacting chlorin 3 with the phosphonium salt of p-methylbenzylbromide 10 and isolation of 8-phenanthrenevinylporphyrin 19 from chlorin 7 further confirmed our proposed mechanism for the formation of a spirochlorin-chlorin dimer 9. Following a similar approach, chlorin 3 on reacting with bis-phosphonium salt of 4, 4'-bischloromethylbiphenyl produced conjugated chlorin dimer 25. The spectroscopic data obtained from these dimers suggest that, in these compounds, the individual chromophores are not behaving as an individual molecule, but as a single macrocycle. To examine whether the pi-pi interaction exhibited by dimer 9 resembles the structural arrangement of bacteriochlorophylls in reaction center (RC), we investigated the geometrical parameters used to characterize the pi-pi interactions in tetrapyrrolic macrocycles. Starting from the crystallographic coordinates of 9, the molecular mechanics energy minimization was performed to obtain the model dimer structure. The geometrical parameters that measure the single pyrrole ring overlap were used to compare the model structure with the crystallographic coordinates of the special pair in photosynthetic reaction center. The results indicated that the ring A of spirochlorin and the ring C of chlorin in our model dimer 9 mimic the ring A-ring A interaction found in the crystallographic special pairs, which are strategically placed by the surrounding photosynthetic reaction center protein matrix.",

The disturbances are considered additive on the inputs and the solution is based on the supervisory control framework, finite-time stability and a robust multi-output regulation. The effectiveness of the solution is proved, supported by experiments and finally compared with the dynamic window approach to show how the proposed method can perform better than standard methods.",

The relationship among stress, strain, void ratio and time is obtained, and the characteristics of the secondary consolidation and its influencing factors are compared. The results show that the secondary consolidation coefficient first increases with the increase of load and then decreases. In contrast, the value in unprocessed site is more than that in processed site. It also increases with the increases of moisture content, and the relationship curve is a concave. It keeps a linear increase with the compression index, at the same time, it keeps a logarithmic downtrend with the increasing time. The characteristics of the secondary consolidation are obviously influenced by the height and the drainage condition of soil samples. Based on the results, a simple and practical secondary consolidation coefficient model and deformation forecast method, which are suitable for the characteristics of dredger fill sites, are proposed. Compared with the experimenta; results, the proposed model can be employed to predict the deformation characteristics of the dredger fill sites.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNA detection is a valuable method for determining cell identity. Molecular beacons are elegant sensors that can transform intracellular microRNA concentration into a fluorescence intensity. While target binding enhances beacon fluorescence, the degree of enhancement is insufficient for demanding applications. Addition of specialty nucleases can allow target recycling and amplify the signal, but this process complicates the assay. We develop and characterize a novel class of beacons susceptible to the endogenous nuclease Argonaute-2 (Ago2). After purifying the complex via co-immunoprecipitation, microRNA:Ago2 cleavage (miRACle) beacons undergo site- and sequence-specific cleavage, and show a 13-fold fluorescence enhancement distinct over traditional beacons. The system can be adapted to any microRNA sequence, and can cleave nuclease resistant, non-RNA bases, potentially allowing miRACle beacons to be designed for cells without interference from non-specific nucleases.",

Considering the characteristics of EST element and the explicit solution of sheet forming simulation, the smallest computation units are mapped to the threads and the parallel reduction technique is adopted to calculate the single values to realize the fine-grain parallelism of whole computing processes. Compute unified device architecture (CUDA) is used as a GPU programming environment to program our application. The CPU is used to control the program action and the GPU is used to do the numerical solutions in this application to suit to the characteristics of GPU parallel computing system. The numerical examples show that this parallel computing algorithm based on GPU can dramatically reduce the simulation time of sheet forming that it obtained about 35X speedup compare to the traditional serial algorithm based on CPU with the same computing result. © 2012 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.",

        "abstract": "We have developed a noninvasive imaging method to quantify  drug delivery pharmacokinetics without the need for blood or tissue collection to determine drug concentration. By combining the techniques of hyperspectral imaging and a dorsal skinfold window chamber, this method enabled the real-time monitoring of vascular transport and tissue deposition of nanoparticles labeled with near-infrared (NIR) dye. Using this imaging method, we quantified the delivery pharmacokinetics of the native high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted HDL nanoparticles and demonstrated these HDLs had long circulation time in blood stream (half-life >12 h). These HDL nanoparticles could efficiently carry cargo DiR-BOA to extravasate from blood vessels, diffuse through extracellular matrix, and penetrate and be retained in the tumor site. The EGFR targeting specificity of EGFR-targeted HDL (EGFR-specific peptide conjugated HDL) was also visualized  by competitive inhibition with excess EGFR-specific peptide. In summary, this imaging technology may help point the way toward the development of novel imaging-based pharmacokinetic assays for preclinical drugs and evaluation of drug delivery efficiency, providing a dynamic window into the development and application of novel drug delivery systems.",

        "abstract": "This study imaged the metabolic state of a growing tumor and the relationship between energy metabolism and the ability of glucose uptake in whole tumor tissue with cryo-imaging at 77°K. A MTB/TOM mouse model, bearing c-MYC-induced mammary tumor, was very rapidly freeze-trapped 2 hrs post Pyro-2DG injection. The fluorescence signals of oxidized flavoprotein (Fp), reduced pyridine nucleotide (PN), pyro-2DG, and the reflection signal of deoxy-hemoglobin were imaged every 100 μm from the top surface to the bottom of the tumor sequentially, 9 sections in total. Each of the four signals was constructed into 3D images with Amira software. Both Fp and PN signals could be detected in the growing tumor regions, and a higher reduction state where was shown in the ratio images. The necrotic tumor regions displayed a very strong Fp signal and weak PN signal. In the bloody extravasation regions, Fp and PN signals were observably diminished. Therefore, the regions of high growth and necrosis in the tumor could be determined according to the Fp and PN signals. The content of deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) in the tumor was positively correlated with the reduced PN signal. Pyro-2DG signal was only evident in the growing condition region in the tumor. Normalized 3D cross-correlation showed that Pyro-2DG signal was similar to the redox ratio. The results indicated that glucose uptake in the tumor was consistent with the redox state of the tumor. And both Pyro-2DG and mitochondrial NADH fluorescence showed bimodal histograms suggesting that the two population of c-MYC induced mammary tumor, one of which could be controlled by c-MYC transgene.",

On the basis of Generalized Mie theory, adopting the relation between the spherical vector wave functions belonging to a rotating Cartesian coordinate system, the electromagnetic fields of Gaussian beam with spherical vector wave functions was deduced at any right coordinates system. Then taking advantage of the cylindrical vector wave functions given by Stratton, the relationship of the spherical vector wave functions expressed in cylindrical vector wave functions was deduced. Finally the electromagnetic fields of infinitely long cylinder was expanded by the cylindrical vector, and the approximate expression of the cylinder to the far zone scattered field was solved. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

        "abstract": "The Masquelet's induced membrane (IM) technique is widely used to treat large segmental bone defects due to its physical priority and biological function. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of the IM on bone formation remains unknown. In the present study, rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were used as an  model and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) was used as a positive control to evaluate the effects of the IM on the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Although the IM group did not exhibit a significant increase in the expression of Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), Collagen I (Col I), osteocalcin (OCN) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) relative to the BMP-2 administration, the IM was considerably effective compared with the untreated group. Mechanistically, we found that the IM activated the Smad and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which was further confirmed by application of specific inhibitors of Smad1/5/8 (LDN-193189) and ERK1/2 (U0126). After the combined treatment of the IM and LDN-193189 as well as U0126, the IM-induced increase in Runx2, Col I, and OCN expression was significantly inhibited. These results suggest that IM promotes the osteogenic differentiation of rat BMSCs by activating the Smad1/5/8 and MAPK pathways.",

METHODS: Thirty-two adult male SD rats weighing 180-220 g were randomly divided into control group (n=16) and stress group (n=16). Rats of stress group received 30-min acute stress including white noise, and foot shock, and then the spatial learning and memory performance was measured by Morris water maze. The hormone levels in plasma and brain were determined by spectrophotofluorometry and radioimmunoassay kit. RESULTS: In water maze task, the time taken for fear-stressed rats to find the platform (latency) for spatial bias was prolonged(P<0.05), and the frequency of crossing over the platform location was decreased in the probe trail (P<0.01). The stress also resulted in significantly higher plasmic and cerebral noradrenaline, corticosteroid, 5-hydroxytryptamine levels, and lower adrenomedulin level in comparison with the controls (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Acute fear stress leads to abnormalities of learning and memory of rats, and the alteration of hormone levels in this process may be a significant mechanism underlying the effect.",

In this paper, this coverage problem was solved by data fusion. The whole procedure includes the following steps. First, SST data within 200km of the coastline were removed, and so were outliers. Second, the HY-2A SST data were gridded, filtered and corrected. Third, the inverse distance weighted (IDW) method was used to merge the HY-2A SST data into those from an operational, high-resolution, combined sea surface temperature and sea ice analysis (OSTIA) system. The Global 1-km Sea Surface Temperature (G1SST) data were used as the reference data. The root mean square (RMS) difference between the along-track SST data of HY-2A and the G1SST SST data is 1.3°C. The HY-2A SST data were about 83% left and the RMS is 0.7°C after preprocessing. The along-track SST data of HY-2A can be well used for data fusion. The RMS for the fusion results is 0.6°C, and the gaps between tracks were filled up.",

        "abstract": "CuFeS2 is an environmentally friendly n-type thermoelectric material composed of earth-abundant, inexpensive and nontoxic elements. However, its rather undistinguished electronic properties combined with a high thermal conductivity lead to a low thermoelectric performance. In this work, an attempt is made to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of CuFeS2 by In substituting on the Fe site. A series of CuFe1–xInxS2 (x = 0–0.08) compounds was synthesized by vacuum melting combined with the plasma activated sintering (PAS) process, and the effect of substituting In atoms on the band structure and thermoelectric properties of CuFeS2 has been investigated. The results show that the solubility limit of In in CuFeS2 is more than 8%. For the In content of 0.08, the lattice thermal conductivity of room temperature and at 630 K was reduced by 60% and 37%, respectively, indicating that substituting In for Fe is an effective method to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of CuFeS2.

The volume loss, maximum vertical loss, surface roughness (R(a)) and surface morphology [Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)] were determined after wear. The inorganic filler content was determined by thermogravimetric analysis. The result showed that the volume loss and vertical loss varied among the materials. The coefficients of determination (R(2)) of wear volume loss and filler content (wt%) was 0.283. SEM micrographs revealed nanofilled composites displayed a relatively uniform wear surfaces with nanoclusters protrusion, while the performance of nanohybrid composites varied. The abrasive wear resistance of contemporary dental composite resins is material-dependent and cannot be deduced from its category, filler loading and composite matrix; The abrasive wear resistance of some flowable composites is comparable to the universal/posterior composite resins.",

Dewatering lowing the hydraulic pressure and bring the volume force:seepage force,classification for the seepage failures was made by the essence of the force,boiling and piping because of plane force,bursting because of volume force. At present the formula to check bursting safety only compare the gravity of soil body and hydraulic pressure under the soil body,doesn’t consider the shearing strength. Taking the shearing strength into consideration,using the typical excavation engineering data in Tianjin's metro station pit,after calculating the balance of upward force and downward force,it is found that the shearing strength surrounding the soil body is about quarter to half by portion of upward hydraulic pressure. Especially for lenticular interbed,the shearing strength is more safe against the upward hydraulic pressure.",

        "abstract": "Lead (Pb) is known to impair children's cognitive function. It has been previously shown that developmental Pb exposure alters dendritic spine formation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. However, the underlying mechanism has not yet been defined. In this study, a low-level gestational Pb exposure (GLE) rat model was employed to investigate the impact of Pb on the spine density of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons and its regulatory mechanism. Pb exposure resulted in impaired performance of the rats in the Morris water maze tasks, and in decreased EPSC amplitudes in hippocampal CA3-CA1 regions. With a 3D reconstruction by the Imaris software, the results from Golgi staining showed that the spine density in the CA1 region was reduced in the Pb-exposed rats in a dose-dependent manner. Decreased spine density was also observed in cultured hippocampal neurons following the Pb treatment. Furthermore, the expression level of NLGN1, a postsynaptic protein that mediates synaptogenesis, was significantly decreased following the Pb exposure both in vivo and in vitro. Up-regulation of NLGN1 in cultured primary neurons partially attenuated the impact of Pb on the spine density. Taken together, our resultssuggest that Pb exposure alters spine plasticity in the developing hippocampus by down-regulating NLGN1 protein levels.",

The favorable effect of vertical load and the distribution of lateral soil resistance along pile under inclined load in layered soil are analyzed. The shaft resistance along pile under inclined load is greater than that of pile under lateral load within a certain depth below ground surface. Significant changes of lateral soil resistance at the surfaces of different soil layers along piles are observed. To a certain depth below ground surface, lateral soil resistance is nearly equal to the static soil pressure. Pile cap can reduce lateral displacement of pile efficiently. The free length of pile above the ground surface discussed herein is rather small, thus the P-Δ effect caused by vertical component of inclined load is small. The larger the shaft resistance along pile under inclined load, the bigger the vertical stress in the soil surrounding the pile. The vertical component of inclined load will increase the lateral bearing capacity of pile.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Most catastrophic failure in underground engineering is caused by soil and water loss. However, few studies have focused on the evolution of ground deformation during such a process. In this study, model tests were conducted to investigate the flow channel boundary (the interface between the flowing and stationary ground) and ground settlement profile during the flow process of sandy soil and water, and a simplified model was proposed based on the experiment results. The model was validated against measurements from laboratory model tests with fine and medium sand, and the tendency of the simplified model to predict the subsurface ground movement boundary was verified with case records of tunneling, which can also lead to similar soil loss. Finally, parameter analysis was performed according to the simplified model. The study showed that the flow channel boundary could be described by an ellipse for a planar problem (i.e., loosening ellipse). Furthermore, the flow channel boundary was related to the soil loss volume, buried depth of soil extraction location, and eccentricity of the loosening ellipse. The eccentricity of the loosening ellipse decreased with increasing average particle diameter. Peck’s curve could be used to describe the profile of the settlement trough when the mass loss ratio was not u003e20 %. The ground surface settlement profile changed to the shape of an “inverted triangle” with increased soil loss. The goodness of fit of Peck’s curve to subsurface settlement increased with depth before the deep ground flowed out from the opening. The effect of groundwater flow was considered in the model tests and simplified model to analyze the disaster mechanism, which can provide a reference for the further research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   An increasing number of catastrophic progressive collapses of deep excavations have occurred throughout the world. However, the mechanism by which partial failures evolve into large-scale progressive collapses has rarely been studied. In this paper, long-strip excavations and square excavations retained by cantilever contiguous piles under partial failure were simulated using the explicit finite difference method (FDM). The results show that a partial collapse can cause sharp increases in the internal forces in adjacent intact piles through the horizontal arching effect. Therefore, the concept of a load transfer coefficient is proposed, which is equal to the ratio of increase of the internal force in an intact pile. The relationship between the maximum load transfer coefficient  T  max  and the safety factor of the piles determines whether progressive collapse will occur. Furthermore, the influences of a number of important factors on the load transfer mechanism, such as the capping beam, the extent of partial failure, the soil strength, the excavation depth and the corner effect, were examined. A continuous capping beam can reduce the maximum load transfer coefficient  T  max . Within a certain range of the extent of partial collapse, a larger partial collapse extent will produce larger load transfer coefficients and have a greater influence over a larger area. For the same retaining structure, a higher soil strength will result in larger load transfer coefficients. Moreover, when the lateral stiffness of the retaining piles is lower, the maximum load transfer coefficient will be smaller and the range of influence will be larger. In an excavation with a corner effect, when the number of failed piles is above a certain threshold, the maximum load transfer coefficient decreases with an increasing number of failed piles. Therefore, the progressive collapse evolving toward the corner will terminate when the maximum load transfer coefficient decreases below the safety factor. The corner effect can be recognized as a cause of the natural termination of progressive collapse.",

        "abstract": "Stress exerts complex effects on learning and memory; however, the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in stress effects on brain and behavior is rather limited. In this study, we investigated the regulation of the activation of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascades in the rat brain by GABAA receptor in a learning and memory task under acute restraint stress conditions. We found that the acute restraint stress improved the performance of the rats in the Morris water maze. Furthermore, the acute restraint stress significantly increased the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC), but not in the striatum. The increase paralleled the time course of the decrease of the level of GABAA receptor alpha1 subunit. The increase of P-ERK levels was inhibited by the agonist of GABAA receptor, muscimol, and further increased by the antagonist of the receptor, bicuculline. However, neither muscimol nor bicuculline affected the levels of P-JNK and P-p38. Finally, injection of muscimol partly reversed the acute restraint stress-induced enhancement of performance in the Morris water maze, and injection of bicuculline improved it. These results demonstrated that the changes in ERK phosphorylation in hippocampus and PFC were regulated by GABAA receptor in a learning and memory paradigm under acute restraint stress conditions.",

        "abstract": "The Cochran-Armitage trend test has been used in case-control studies for testing genetic association. As the variance of the test statistic is a function of unknown parameters, e.g. disease prevalence and allele frequency, it must be estimated. The usual estimator combining data for cases and controls assumes they follow the same distribution under the null hypothesis. Under the alternative hypothesis, however, the cases and controls follow different distributions. Thus, the power of the trend tests may be affected by the variance estimator used. In particular, the usual method combining both cases and controls is not an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the null variance when the alternative is true. Two different estimates of the null variance are available which are consistent under both the null and alternative hypotheses. In this paper, we examine sample size and small sample power performance of trend tests, which are optimal for three common genetic models as well as a robust trend test based on the three estimates of the variance and provide guidelines for choosing an appropriate test.",

To overcome these two problems, a new double functional NMR diffusion sequence, double echo PGSTE-WATERGATE, is presented. The new sequence provides excellent convection compensation and solvent suppression (with a suppression factor in excess of at least 10(5) in a single scan) in biomolecular NMR diffusion experiments. Due to its stimulated echo nature, the new sequence is much less susceptible to spin-spin relaxation than Hahn spin-echo based sequences. Furthermore, the new sequence is not susceptible to spin diffusion due to the application of bipolar pulsed gradients. The new sequence is also much easier to set up compared to previously developed stimulated echo based convection compensation and solvent suppression sequence. The utility of the new sequence is demonstrated on an aqueous lysozyme sample.",

        "abstract": "Insular lesions remain surgically challenging because of the need to balance aggressive resection and functional protection. Motor function deficits due to corticospinal tract injury are a common complication of surgery for lesions adjacent to the internal capsule and it is therefore essential to evaluate the corticospinal tract adjacent to the lesion. We used diffusion tensor imaging to evaluate the corticospinal tract in 89 patients with insular lobe lesions who underwent surgery in Chinese PLA General Hospital from February 2009 to May 2011. Postoperative motor function evaluation revealed that 57 patients had no changes in motor function, and 32 patients suffered motor dysfunction or aggravated motor dysfunction. Of the affected patients, 20 recovered motor function during the 6-12-month follow-up, and an additional 12 patients did not recover over more than 12 months of follow-up. Following reconstruction of the corticospinal tract, fractional anisotropy comparison demonstrated that preoperative, intraoperative and follow-up normalized fractional anisotropy in the stable group was higher than in the transient deficits group or the long-term deficits group. Compared with the transient deficits group, intraoperative normalized fractional anisotropy significantly decreased in the long-term deficits group. We conclude that intraoperative fractional anisotropy values of the corticospinal tracts can be used as a prognostic indicator of motor function outcome.",

        "abstract": "Highly selective and efficient water signal suppression is indispensable in biomolecular 2D nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments. However, the application of conventional water suppression schemes can cause a significant or complete loss of the biomolecular resonances at and around the water chemical shift (ω). In this study, a new sequence, NOESY-WaterControl, was developed to address this issue. The new sequence was tested on lysozyme and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), demonstrating its efficiency in both water suppression and, more excitingly, preserving water-proximate biomolecular resonances in ω. The 2D NOESY maps obtained using the new sequence thus provide more information than the maps obtained with conventional water suppression, thereby lessening the number of experiments needed to complete resonance assignments of biomolecules. The 2D NOESY-WaterControl map of BPTI showed strong bound water and exchangeable proton signals in ω but these signals were absent in ω, indicating the possibility of using the new sequence to discriminate bound water and exchangeable proton resonances from non-labile proton resonances with similar chemical shifts to water.",

A nanocarrier should possess long circulation time yet be small and stable enough to freely navigate through interstitial space to deliver its cargo to targeted cells. Herein, it is shown that by adding targeting ligands to nanoparticles that mimic high-density lipoprotein (HDL), tumor-targeted sub-30-nm peptide-lipid nanocarriers are created with controllable size, cargo loading, and shielding properties. The size of the nanocarrier is tunable between 10 and 30 nm, which correlates with a payload of 15-100 molecules of fluorescent dye. Ligand-directed nanocarriers targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. The nanocarriers show favorable circulation time, tumor accumulation, and biodistribution with or without the targeting ligand. The EGFR targeting ligand is proved to be essential for the EGFR-mediated tumor cell uptake of the nanocarriers, a prerequisite of intracellular delivery. The results demonstrate that targeted HDL-mimetic nanocarriers are useful delivery vehicles that could open new avenues for the development of clinically viable targeted nanomedicine.",

MAX3 is the maximum of three trend tests derived under the recessive, additive and dominant genetic models, respectively. The proposed Bayes factor, denoted as BFM, models the asymptotic distributions of MAX3 under the null and alternative hypotheses. It is compared to an existing Bayes factor based on Bayesian model averaging (BMA). Through simulation studies, we show that both BFM and BMA are robust under genetic model uncertainty. They both depend on specifying the prior distribution for the genetic model, and have similar performance when common objective priors are used. When the prior places a large probability on the true (wrong) genetic model, BMA (BFM) is more powerful. Applications to real data from a genome-wide association study are presented to illustrate their use and show their sensitivity under genetic model uncertainty. © 2012 International Biometric Society.",

        "abstract": "For the low accuracy of single-level inversion methods to dynamic light scattering, a novel Multi-level Tikhonov regularization inversion (ML-TIK) method combining the Tikhonov regularization method with cascadic multi-grid technique was developed. Firstly, this method divided the original problem into several sub-inversion problems with different grid spaces by a multi-grid technique. Then, from the coarsest scale to the finest scale, each sub-inversion problem was inverted by single-level Tikhonov regularization (TIK) method. Finally, the Particle Size Distribution (PSD) was successively obtained by solving several sub-inversion problems. This method effectively reduces the ill-condition of the original equations. At noise levels 0, 0.005 and 0.01, the simulation data of 200~650 nm bimodal distribution particles were respectively inverted by the TIK and ML-TIK. The results indicate that the inversion PSD of ML-TIK is more consistent with that of the theoretical one and it has better smoothness. Comparing to TIK, the ML-TIK can reduce the peak value error by 8.19% and relative error by 0.4482. However, when the noise level is 0.005 and 0.01, the PSD of TIK has not obvious bimodal features. Therefore, the ML-TIK has improved the inversion accuracy and noise immunity. Inversion results of 60 and 200 nm experimental data verify above conclusions.",

        "abstract": "There is a lack of research on the mechanisms by which isolation piles affect displacements in deep soil layers and the use of isolation piles to control the displacement and deformation of the existing tunnels adjacent to deep excavations. This paper examines a large, deep excavation project in which isolation piles were used to protect a nearby existing tunnel. A finite-element model that considers the small-strain characteristics of the soil was used to simulate this project. After the numerical model is verified, it is used in a parametric analysis of the mechanisms by which isolation piles control the displacement of deep soil layers and the deformation of tunnels near excavations. The results show that isolation piles have both a barrier effect and a traction effect on the surrounding soil and adjacent tunnels. When the traction effect is larger, isolation piles can exacerbate the horizontal displacement of the soil and tunnel within a certain depth range and actually increase tunnel deformation. Burying the isolation piles reduces this traction effect and improves their ability to isolate tunnels from displacement. All else being equal, isolation piles more efficiently control deformation if they are near the tunnel.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper presents a decentralized solution to control a leader-follower formation of unicycle wheeled mobile robots allowing collision and obstacle avoidance. It is assumed that only positions and orientations of the robots can be measured and that each robot is influenced by an additive input disturbance. To guarantee the problem solution a supervisory control algorithm is designed and finite-time differentiators are used to estimate the leader velocity. The supervisor orchestrates three control algorithms responsible for the following, rendezvous and collision avoidance manoeuvres. All controls ensure a finite-time regulation for the robots orientation and a practically finite-time fulfilment of the required performance constraints.",

        "abstract": "We have developed a high sensitivity near-infrared (NIR) optical imaging system for non-invasive cancer detection through molecular labeled fluorescent contrast agents. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging can probe tissue deeply thus possess the potential for non-invasively detection of breast or lymph node cancer. Recent developments in molecular beacons can selectively label various pre-caner/cancer signatures and provide high tumor to background contrast. To increase the sensitivity in detecting fluorescent photons and the accuracy of localization, phase cancellation (in- and anti-phase) device is employed. This frequency-domain system utilizes the interference-like pattern of diffuse photon density wave to achieve high detection sensitivity and localization accuracy for the fluorescent heterogeneity embedded inside the scattering media. The opto-clcctronic system consists of the laser sources, fiber optics, interference filter to select the fluorescent photons and the high sensitivity photon detector (photomultiplier tube). The source-detector pair scans the tissue surface in multiple directions and the two-dimensional localization image can be obtained using goniometric reconstruction. In vivo measurements with tumor-bearing mouse model using the novel Cypate-mono-2-deoxy-glucose (Cypate-2-D-Glucosamide) fluorescent contrast agent, which targets the enhanced tumor glycolysis, demonstrated the feasibility on detection of 2 cm deep subsurface tumor in the tissue-like medium, with a localization accuracy within 2-3 mm. This instrument has the potential for tumor diagnosis and imaging, and the accuracy of the localization suggests that this system could help to guide the clinical fine-needle biopsy. This portable device would be complementary to X-ray mammogram and provide add-on information on early diagnosis and localization of early breast tumor.",

PDT provides additional tissue selectivity versus conventional chemotherapy in that singlet oxygen is generated only in areas with both accumulated PS and simultaneous illumination by a light source with sufficient irradiance and dose. Early photodynamic therapy beacons built on this concept by adding an analyte-responsive element that simultaneously \"turns-on\" PDT and fluorescence, providing both an additional layer of selectivity and real-time feedback of the PS's activation state. More recent photodynamic therapy beacons have expanded this idea, with new methods now available for sensing analytes, generating singlet oxygen, and reporting treatment status. In this review, we consider developments in advanced activation strategies implemented in therapeutic and theranostic beacons.",

Herein, we reported the remarkable role of Cl doping in SnSe2/SnSe nanocomposites. Doping with Cl in the system not only increases the carrier concentration by an order of magnitude, but it also modifies the heterojunction from that of the Schottky junction type (p–n junction) in undoped samples to junctions having an ohmic contact (n–n junction) when the samples are doped with Cl, increasing their carrier mobility in the process. On account of the simultaneously boosted carrier concentration and carrier mobility upon Cl doping, the electrical conductivity and the power factor are greatly increased. Moreover, the enhanced point defect phonon scattering induced by Cl doping, coupled with the interface phonon scattering, results in a suppression of the thermal conductivity....",

        "abstract": "Molecular imaging has emerged as an indispensable technology in the development and application of drug delivery systems. Targeted imaging agents report the presence of biomolecules, including therapeutic targets and disease biomarkers, while the biological behaviour of labelled delivery systems can be non-invasively assessed in real time. As an imaging modality, fluorescence offers additional signal specificity and dynamic information due to the inherent responsivity of fluorescence agents to interactions with other optical species and with their environment. Harnessing this responsivity is the basis of activatable fluorescence imaging, where interactions between an engineered fluorescence agent and its biological target induce a fluorogenic response. Small molecule activatable agents are frequently derivatives of common fluorophores designed to chemically react with their target. Macromolecular scale agents are useful for imaging proteins and nucleic acids, although their biological delivery can be difficult. Nanoscale activatable agents combine the responsivity of fluorophores with the unique optical and physical properties of nanomaterials. The molecular imaging application and overall complexity of biological target dictate the most advantageous fluorescence agent size scale and activation strategy.",

        "abstract": "Metro is an effective way to solve the traffic problem in downtown around the world. It happens occasionally that metro tunnel is constructed near building foundation such as pile foundation. It is a difficult job to evaluate the effect of tunneling on piles nearby. Finite element method is adopted to fully understand the effect. Pressures and shearing forces are enforced on the soils in the finite element models to simulate the real reactions between shield driven machine and the soil surrounded during tunneling. Results from the model adopted here in the finite element method show fine agreement with those measured in the Tianjin metro line project No.1. Researches on the effects of shield driven tunneling on the adjacent single pile are carried out considering the buried depth, number of tunnels and the sequence of tunnel construction. When the horizontal distance between pile and tunnel is kept unchanged, there is a critical depth of tunnel; when the tunnel is located at this critical depth, the settlement at pile top and the deformation of pile reach the maximum value. When the depth of tunnel is small, pile may move upwards during tunneling. The smaller the buried depth of tunnel, the greater the increment of settlement at pile top when the lateral horizontal distance between pile and tunnel is reduced by the same amount. Settlements at pile top caused by twin tunnels are always greater than those caused by single tunnel. Settlement and deformation of pile arisen from twin tunnels driven together are greater than those when the two tunnels are driven separately. Whether the twin tunnels are driven together or not, settlements at pile top caused by twin vertical-tunnels are smaller than those caused by twin parallel-tunnels.",

        "abstract": "The development of curative glioblastoma treatments and tumour-specific contrast agents that can overcome the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and infiltrative tumour morphology remains a challenge. Apolipoprotein E3 (apoE3) is a high density lipoprotein apolipoprotein that chaperones the transcytosis of nanoparticles across the BBB, and displays high-affinity binding with the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), a cell-surface receptor overexpressed by glioblastoma cells. This LDLR overexpression and apoE3 binding capacity was exploited for the development of glioblastoma-targeted porphyrin-lipid apoE3 lipid nanoparticles (pyE-LNs) with intrinsic theranostic properties. Size-controlled discoidal and cholesteryl oleate (CO)-loaded spherical pyE-LNs were synthesized through the systematic variation of particle composition, which dictated nanoparticle size and morphology. Composition optimization yielded 30 nm pyE-LNs with stable loading of apoE3 and porphyrin-lipid that simultaneously conferred the nanoparticles with glioblastoma targeting and activatable near-infrared fluorescence imaging functionalities. A 4-fold higher uptake of pyE-LNs by LDLR-expressing U87 glioblastomas cells relative to minimally expressing ldlA7 cells was observed in vitro. This uptake was a result of receptor-mediated endocytosis, which could be inhibited through LDL competition and acetylation of particle apoE3 moieties. ApoE3-dependent delivery of pyE-LN to glioblastomas was also demonstrated in orthotopic U87-GFP tumour-bearing animals. Quantification of CO-loaded pyE-LN biodistribution demonstrated successful selective uptake of porphyrin by malignant tissue, with a 4 : 1 tumour : healthy tissue particle specificity. This allowed for the detection of strong, tumour-localized porphyrin fluorescence, which was diminished when apoE3-devoid py-LN particles were administered. Furthermore, this selective uptake yielded cell-specific potent PDT sensitization in vitro, resulting in an 83% reduction in glioblastoma cell viability. These results highlight the promising capacity of pyE-LNs to target porphyrin delivery to glioblastoma tumours for theranostic applications.",

        "abstract": "Genome-wide association study (GWAS), typically involving 100,000 to 500,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), is a powerful approach to identify disease susceptibility loci. In a GWAS, single-marker analysis, which tests one SNP at a time, is usually used as the first stage to screen SNPs across the genome in order to identify a small fraction of promising SNPs with relatively low p-values for further and more focused studies. For single-marker analysis, the trend test derived for an additive genetic model is often used. This may not be robust when the additive assumption is not appropriate for the true underlying disease model. A robust test, MAX, based on the maximum of three trend test statistics derived for recessive, additive, and dominant models, has been proposed recently for GWAS. But its p-value has to be evaluated through a resampling-based procedure, which is computationally challenging for the analysis of GWAS. Obtaining the p-value for MAX with adjustment for the covariates can be even more time-consuming. In this article, we provide a simple approximation for the p-value of the MAX test with or without adjusting for the covariates. The new method avoids resampling steps and thus makes the MAX test readily applicable to GWAS. We use simulation studies as well as real datasets on 17 confirmed disease-associated SNPs to assess the accuracy of the proposed method. We also apply the method to the GWAS of coronary artery disease.",

The tensile stress developed in the geotextile during filling the tube is the dominant factor for construction of a safe dike. The existing design methods are good for designing sausage shaped tubes and can not be directly applied for designing flat tubes, which are commonly used in dike construction. This paper presents a procedure that can determine the relationship among the tube size, the pumping pressure, the unit weight of the slurry, and the tensile stress developed in the geotextile during the tube filing. When the tubes are piling up to form the dike, the tubes in the bottom will sustain the load from the weight of the upper ones. A procedure is also developed to calculate the changes of the mechanical and geometrical behavior of the tubes under the load with a similar method. All these approaches have been programmed, which can help dike designers to select the suitable geotextile and determine the profile of the dike.",

        "abstract": "In this article, five typhoon cases observed by quasi-concurrent satellite-based synthetic aperture radar SAR and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS were studied with a feature-tracking technique. The rainband features around typhoon eyes were first delineated using wavelet analysis, and then the wind speeds were estimated by feature tracking using quasi-concurrent multi-sensor images. It was found that the feature tracking-estimated wind speeds are reasonable compared with the maximum wind speed reported by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center JTWC, which accounts for the radial dependence of wind speed using the Rankine combined vortex approximation. In a specific case, with the aid of Doppler radar observations near the northern coast of Taiwan, wind speed estimation based on the multi-sensor also shows consistent results. This study demonstrates that the local wind distribution of cyclonic winds around typhoon eyes at different radial distances from the typhoon centres may be derived from rainband feature tracking using quasi-concurrent multi-sensor images. This technique may offer useful wind information for typhoon simulations and forecasting.",

        "abstract": "Meso-to-meso ethyne-bridged tris[(porphinato)zinc(II)] (PZn(3)) near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores (lambda(em)(max) approximately 800 nm) can be rendered sufficiently amphiphilic to enable their facile incorporation into the hydrophobic core of the apo form of low-density lipoprotein (apo-LDL). These NIR fluorophores are notable in that they manifest low energy excited states polarized exclusively along the long axis of the supermolecule, broad spectral coverage of the visible and high energy NIR spectral domains, intense S(0)-->S(1) transition moments, and comparably large S(1)-->S(0) emission dipole strengths. The reconstituted LDL(PZn(3)) proteins can be used to deliver rapidly hundreds of copies of PZn(3) to a given murine B16 melanoma cell via LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis. PZn(3)-based NIRFs and their corresponding LDL(PZn(3)) proteins have been shown to display minimal cytotoxicity. Confocal NIR fluorescence microscopy evinces that B16 cells can be imaged at very low doses (approximately nM) of NIRF. The highly attractive photophysical properties of PZn(3) and closely related chromophores, coupled with their lack of toxicity and compatibility with uptake into apo-LDL and subsequent rapid delivery to B16 cells via LDLr-mediated endocytosis, suggest the potential utility of this platform for NIR optical imaging of cancer cells in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear magnetic resonance diffusion studies can be used to identify different compounds in a mixture. However, because the diffusion coefficient is primarily dependent on the effective hydrodynamic radius, it is particularly difficult to resolve compounds with similar size and structure, such as isomers, on the basis of diffusion. Differential solution interactions between species in certain solutions can afford possibilities for separation. In the present study, the self-diffusion of the three isomers of dihydroxybenzene (i.e., (1,2-) catechol, (1,3-) resorcinol, and (1,4-) hydroquinone) was studied in water, aqueous monohydric alcohols (i.e., ethanol, 1-propanol, tert-butanol), and aqueous ethylene glycol. These systems allowed the effects of isomerism and differential solvent interactions on diffusion to be examined. It was found that, while in aqueous solution these isomers had the same diffusion coefficient, in water-monohydric alcohol systems the diffusion coefficient of catechol differed from those of resorcinol and hydroquinone. The separation was found to increase at higher concentrations of monohydric alcohols. The underlying chemical reasons for these differences were investigated. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",

The differences between the finite element analysis results were compared,and the basic disciplines of bottom rebound were summarized.The influencing factors of bottom rebound due to deep excavation in soft soil area were analyzed.The conclusion is that soil is compacted during dewatering and the position of the largest bottom rebound moves to the concrete diaphragm walls due to excavation and dewatering.From the above analysis,dewatering is beneficial to the stability of the foundation pits. At the same time,the results of empirical formula were compared with those of FE analysis,indicating that the results of FEM analysis are referable.",

The fixed-time differentiator estimates outputs’ derivatives in a predefined convergence time, largely compensating for initial condition problems and solving the delay problem. Combined with a state reconstruction step, a whole observer–estimator–controller scheme can be constructed for quadrotors to solve the trajectory tracking problem. Also, an Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) optimisation-based algorithm to tune parameters of the differentiator is developed here. The high performance of the proposed model is illustrated by numerical simulations.",

        "abstract": "Based on the framework of critical state soil mechanics, a new bounding surface constitutive model for sand, being applicable to cyclic loading, is proposed. No pure elastic region hypothesis is given in this model. Elastic region of sand reduces to a point. Reverse bullet-shaped yielding surface is adopted. No unique relationship between void ratio and the mean normal stress for sand prevents the direct coupling of yield surface size to void ratio. Incremental deviatoric strain is used as a hardening parameter, instead of adopted plastic volumetric strain as hardening parameter in Original Cam-clay model. The model combines the concept of state-dependent dilatancy by incorporating state parameter concept in Rowe's stress dilatancy equation. Bounding surface magnitude ratio β to loading surface gives plastic modulus evolvement. Formulation of dβ is deducted. A single set of model constants, once calibrated, can simulate cyclic stress-strain response under different initial void ratios and different confining pressures.",

        "abstract": "Several prominent mechanisms for reduction in thermal conductivity have been shown in recent years to improve the figure of merit for thermoelectric materials. Such a mechanism is a hierarchical all-length-scale architecturing that recognizes the role of all microstructure elements, from atomic to nano to microscales, in reducing (lattice) thermal conductivity. In this context, there have been recent claims of remarkably low (lattice) thermal conductivity in BiSbTe that are attributed to seemingly ordinary grain boundary dislocation networks. These high densities of dislocation networks in BiSbTe were generated via unconventional materials processing with excess Te (which formed liquid phase, thereby facilitating sintering), followed by spark plasma sintering under pressure to squeeze out the liquid. We reproduced a practically identical microstructure, following practically identical processing strategies, but with noticeably different (higher) thermal conductivity than that claimed before. We show that the resultant microstructure is anisotropic, with notable difference of thermal and charge transport properties across and along two orthonormal directions, analogous to anisotropic crystals. Thus, we believe that grain boundary dislocation networks are not the primary cause of enhanced  through reduction in thermal conductivity. Instead, we can reproduce the purported high  through a favorable but impractical and incorrect combination of thermal conductivity measured along the pressing direction of anisotropy while charge transport measured in the direction perpendicular to the anisotropic direction. We believe that our work underscores the need for consistency in charge and thermal transport measurements for unified and verifiable measurements of thermoelectric (and related) properties and phenomena.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The unique properties of carbon dots make it have wide potential applications. The combustion process is, thus far, the most representative and common technological path. In this very paper, carbon dots were prepared by burning flammable organic materials such as ethanol, n-butanol, domestic candle and benzene. A series of characterizations were carried out to reveal the structure and photo luminescence of the prepared carbon dots. It is found that the size of carbon dots was at 2–4 nm. More than half disordered graphitic phase was involved in carbon dots. With the length of carbon chain of the precursors grew, the content of disordered graphitic phase has increased. FT-IR revealed that there were C˭C bonds and oxygen containing group on the surface of carbon dots. Different precursors could change the surface groups and surface states of CDs slightly. As one dispersed the prepared carbon dots in the organic solvents, it is found that there would be the dependent photo fluorescence emission bands excited with the UV light of 330–400 nm. This dependent photo fluorescence emission bands relied on the length of carbon chain of the precursors, the aromatic framework in the carbon dots. The emission spectrum of carbon dots prepared with ethanol and n-butanol had good stability and can be used in a variety of solvent systems.",

        "abstract": "For the building adjacent to the excavation corner, the differential settlement caused by excavation will lead to the deflection deformation and torsion deformation of the building. The trend and degree of deflection depends on the characteristics of ground surface settlement over the cross zone of the building, and torsion deformation is closely related to the relative location between the building and the excavation corner. The impacts of the deflection deformation and torsion deformation on the tensile strain of the building are obviously influenced by corner effect. The results show that when the longitudinal walls of the building are parallel to the retaining wall and the distance between them is smaller than the excavation depth, corner effect has a negative influence on the controlling of deformation of the building. The building is in the most adverse situation in this case. When the longitudinal walls of the building are perpendicular to the retaining wall and the distance between them is smaller than the excavation depth, corner effect has a positive influence on the controlling of deformation of the building, obviously reducing the tensile strain of the wall. When the distance between the building and the corner is larger than the excavation depth, the effect on the deformation of the building can be neglected. However, the building is in the most adverse situation when the tensile strain reaches the maximum value.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a network coding-aware opportunistic routing protocol called NCAOR to overcome the inefficiency of COPE with passive coding. By integrating the advantages of both opportunistic routing and network coding, the protocol can achieve the efficient packet delivery. For one-hop forwarding, the node chooses multiple redundancy neighbors called opportunistic node set to assist the packet transmission. After reception, the opportunistic node uses the knowledge of local topology and neighbor reception information to judge the coding opportunity of the received packet. The node then uses the utility function to evaluate the forwarding utility of the packet in consideration of both the distance to destination and the network coding gain, and sets the forwarding time of the packet intelligently. Simulation results show that the protocol can provide larger throughput, lower energy consumption, and more network coding chances of nodes than the COPE which uses the shortest path routing protocol.",

A key challenge arising from the creation of nanomedicines consolidating multiple desirable functionalities into a ‘all-in-one’ platform is that the layering of functionalities into a single agent introduces novel complexities that significantly impede clinical translation. An alternative design approach seeks to exploit intrinsically multi-functional building block to assemble nanomedicines from the bottom-up, yielding agents with a multiplicity of radiologic, pharmacologic, and therapeutic properties derived from a single constituent. Herein are highlighted recent developments in the formulation, multi-modal imaging, and targeting of an exemplary ‘one-for-all’ nanomaterial — the Pyropheophorbide Porphysome — treated from a hitherto unexplored clinical design and development perspective.",

The settlement of raft, soil beneath the raft and soil surrounding the piles groups at different depths under different load levels are measured. Also, the axial forces of the pile and the raft-soil contact pressure are recorded through the whole loading process. Based on the analysis of the measured data, the load transfer mechanism and settlement characteristics of piled raft concerned are studied. Compared with the working behaviors of RPCD and CPR, the test results show that the working behaviors of PRGPR are quite similar to those of RPCD before the raft and pile top are contacted. However, it will start to work similarly to CPR after the raft and pile top are contacted. The different connection forms between the pile top and raft can significantly affect the compaction of soil among piles and thus can affect the slip at the interface between the piles and surrounding soil. For piled raft with each of the three types of raft-pile top connection respectively, the PRGPR will yield the largest pile end penetration and the CPR will yield the smallest.",

The cohort consisted of 43 male and 33 female patients, with a mean age of 49 years (range: 14-79 years). Rates of gross total resection (GTR) and extent of resection (EoR) were calculated at first and final iMRI scans.Pearson χ(2) test was used to compare the rates of GTR.iMRI and multimodal navigation were successfully implemented in all cases. Rates of GTR were misestimated by neurosurgeons in 24 cases (31.6%), which were confirmed by first iMRI. Total tumor resection were achieved in 20 cases (26.3%) as a result of iMRI scan, increasing the rates of gross total resection from 52.6% to 78.9% (χ(2) = 11.692, P = 0.001). Extent of resection in 28 patients who underwent further tumor resection were increased from 81.5% to 98.1%, leading to the overall extent of resection improved from 92.3% to 98.4%. At 3-month follow-up, 3 cases (3.9%) developed permanent neurologic deficits. The mean clinical follow-up was 15.6 months (range 3.0-45.0 months). The 2-year overall survival rate was 19.7%. The median progression-free survival of gross total resection group was 12 months (95% CI: 10.1-13.9 months), compared with 9 months (95%CI: 7.9-10.1 months) of the subtotal resection group (χ(2) = 4.756, P = 0.029). The overall survival of gross total resection group was 16 months (95% CI: 13.7-18.3 months), compared with 12 months (95% CI: 9.7-14.3 months) of the subtotal resection group (χ(2) = 7.885, P = 0.005).Combined with multimodal navigation, iMRI helps maximize surgical resection of glioblastoma, preserving neurological function while increasing progression-free survival and overall survival.",

        "abstract": "Oxidative stress-related apoptosis and autophagy play crucial roles in the development of osteoarthritis (OA), a progressive cartilage degenerative disease with multifactorial etiologies. Here, we determined autophagic flux changes and apoptosis in human OA and tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)-treated chondrocytes. In addition, we explored the potential protective effects of trehalose, a novel Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR)-independent autophagic inducer, in TBHP-treated mouse chondrocytes and a destabilized medial meniscus (DMM) mouse OA model. We found aberrant p62 accumulation and increased apoptosis in human OA cartilage and chondrocytes. Consistently, p62 and cleaved caspase-3 levels increased in mouse chondrocytes under oxidative stress. Furthermore, trehalose restored oxidative stress-induced autophagic flux disruption and targeted autophagy selectively by activating BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) and Phosphoglycerate mutase family member 5 (PGAM5). Trehalose could ameliorate oxidative stress-mediated mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, ATP level decrease, dynamin-related protein 1 (drp-1) translocation into the mitochondria, and the upregulation of proteins involved in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related apoptosis pathway. In addition, trehalose suppressed the cleavage of caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and prevented DNA damage under oxidative stress. However, the anti-apoptotic effects of trehalose in TBHP-treated chondrocytes were partially abolished by autophagic flux inhibitor chloroquine and BNIP3- siRNA. The protective effect of trehalose was also found in mouse OA model. Taken together, these results indicate that trehalose has anti-apoptotic effects through the suppression of oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial injury and ER stress which is dependent on the promotion of autophagic flux and the induction of selective autophagy. Thus, trehalose is a promising therapeutic agent for OA.",

        "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Aβ) and its aggregation forms in the brain have been suggested as key targets for the therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the development of nanocarriers which possess both blood-brain barrier permeability and Aβ-targeting ability is of great importance for the intervention of AD. Here we constructed a biomimetic nanocarrier named apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-reconstituted high density lipoprotein nanocarrier (ANC) from recombinant ApoE and synthetic lipids to achieve the above goals. α-mangostin (α-M), a polyphenolic agent which can inhibit the formation of Aβ oligomers and fibrils and accelerate Aβ cellular degradation, was used as the model drug. Compared with the control liposome, ANC demonstrated about 54-fold higher cellular uptake in brain endothelia cell line in vitro in an ApoE-dependent manner, and much higher brain delivery efficiency in vivo. Confocal microscopy analysis witnessed the penetration of ANC across the brain vessels and its accumulation at the surrounding of Aβ aggregates. Following the loading of α-M, the Aβ-binding affinity of the nanoformulation (ANC-α-M) was not reduced but even enhanced. The effect of ANC-α-M on facilitating the microglia-mediated uptake and degradation of Aβ1-42 was enhanced by 336% and 29-fold when compared with that of the non-treated control, and also much higher than that of blank ANC. Following intravenous administration for two to four weeks, ANC-α-M exhibited the most efficient efficacy in decreasing amyloid deposition, attenuating microgliosis and rescuing memory defect in SAMP8 mice, an AD mouse model. Taken together, the findings of this work provided strong evidences that the ApoE-based biomimetic nanocarrier could provide a promising platform for brain drug delivery towards the treatment of AD.",

        "abstract": "Nanoparticles can provide significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. How nanoparticle size, shape, and surface chemistry can affect their accumulation, retention, and penetration in tumors remains heavily investigated, because such findings provide guiding principles for engineering optimal nanosystems for tumor targeting. Currently, the experimental focus has been on particle design and not the biological system. Here, we varied tumor volume to determine whether cancer pathophysiology can influence tumor accumulation and penetration of different sized nanoparticles. Monte Carlo simulations were also used to model the process of nanoparticle accumulation. We discovered that changes in pathophysiology associated with tumor volume can selectively change tumor uptake of nanoparticles of varying size. We further determine that nanoparticle retention within tumors depends on the frequency of interaction of particles with the perivascular extracellular matrix for smaller nanoparticles, whereas transport of larger nanomaterials is dominated by Brownian motion. These results reveal that nanoparticles can potentially be personalized according to a patient’s disease state to achieve optimal diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Based on the analysis of field measured data of test piles, the load transfer mechanism from short piles to overlength piles in deep soft soil was analyzed by numerical analysis. The results show that Q-s curves of non-socked overlength piles are possibly steep. Non synchronous phenomena in shaft and tip resistance of overlength piles are more outstanding than shorter piles due to compression of pile shaft. The tip resistance ratios are not more than 10% under ultimate loads and characteristic value of the vertical bearing capacity. Moreover, under working loads, the load of short piles is mainly undertaken on the lower piles shaft, while that of long piles is carried by middle and upper piles shaft. Besides, the shaft resistance distributes in a triangle pattern and a single-hump pattern for short and long piles, respectively. The assumption of triangle-patterned distribution of shaft resistance may result in error in settlement calculation of overlength piles.",

Indeed, it highlights an auxiliary dynamics that is added to the PMSM model. Thereby, it supplies a change of coordinates that transforms the extended model (PMSM model together with the auxiliary dynamics) into the so-called extended non-linear observer forms. It turns out that the obtained form provides two observer normal forms. One of them supports the well-known high-gain observer which is used to estimate the speed and the unknown load torque. The second one which is affine in the parameters enables us to estimate simultaneously the states and motor parameters by means of an adaptive observer. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by the simulations results.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a joint method to simultaneously retrieve wave spectra at different scales from spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and wave spectrometer data. The method combines the output from the two different sensors to overcome retrieval limitations that occur in some sea states. The wave spectrometer sensitivity coefficient is estimated using an effective significant wave height (SWH), which is an average of SAR-derived and wave spectrometer-derived SWH. This averaging extends the area of the sea surface sampled by the nadir beam of the wave spectrometer to improve the accuracy of the estimated sensitivity coefficient in inhomogeneous sea states. Wave spectra are then retrieved from SAR data using wave spectrometer-derived spectra as first guess spectra to complement the short waves lost in SAR data retrieval. In addition, the problem of 180° ambiguity in retrieved spectra is overcome using SAR imaginary cross spectra. Simulated data were used to validate the joint method. The simulations demonstrated that retrieved wave parameters, including SWH, peak wave length (PWL), and peak wave direction (PWD), agree well with reference parameters. Collocated data from ENVISAT advanced SAR (ASAR), the airborne wave spectrometer STORM, the PHAROS buoy, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) were then used to verify the proposed method. Wave parameters retrieved from STORM and two ASAR images were compared to buoy and ECMWF wave data. Most of the retrieved parameters were comparable to reference parameters. The results of this study show that the proposed joint retrieval method could be a valuable complement to traditional methods used to retrieve directional ocean wave spectra, particularly in inhomogeneous sea states.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes two simple models, look-up table (LUT) model and empirical model, to directly retrieve significant wave height ( ) using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) azimuth cutoff ( ). Both models aim at C-band VV, HH, VH, and HV single-polarization SAR images. The LUT model relates   to  , while the empirical model relates   to both   and SAR range-to-velocity (). The LUT model coefficients are derived by simulation under different sea states and observation conditions, which depend on incidence angle (), wave direction ( ), and  but are independent of polarization. The empirical model coefficients are obtained by fitting the collocated data, which only depend on polarization. To fit empirical model coefficients and validate the two models, C-band RADARSAT-2 fine quad-polarization (VV+HH+VH+HV) single-look complex (SLC) SAR images and collocated buoy data are collected. Retrieved  , using Yang model and the two models proposed in this paper from four kinds of polarization SAR data, are compared with buoy  . Results show that both LUT and empirical models have the capacity of retrieving   from C-band RADARSAT-2 co-polarization SAR data, while Yang model is not suitable for these kinds of SAR data. Moreover, the empirical model is also valid for cross-polarization SAR data showing clear ocean wave stripes.",

METHODS: Fifty-four representative journals related to breast cancer in China were chosen and analysed. With the CBMdisc database, breast neoplasms as subject words and breast cancer as key words, the papers (without review) from May, 2003 to Apr, 2005, were picked out, categorized and numbered, then analysed with SPSS 12.0 software. RESULTS: There were 42 333 papers at the period totally, and 1 156 of which fulfiled the terms. There were 415 papers (35.9%) in foundational research, and 741(64.1%) in clinical research. CONCLUSIONS: The breast cancer research goes actively generally. Clinical research is more advanced in number. However, there is still lack of high level multicenter randomized controlled Ⅲ phase clinical trials. There are many repeated works in foundational research, and the sample numbers are relatively small.",

The proposed observer allows the reconstruction of the states in two steps. In the first step, an impulsive observer provides an estimation of the delayed states. In the second step, the actual states is estimated by the second observer using a predictive method. The finite time reconstruction is achieved for two different cases: constant and piece-wise constant time delays. The problem of the residual error in the case of piece-wise delay is solved. A numerical example is provided in order to show the efficiency of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "The population-based case-control design is a powerful approach for detecting susceptibility markers of a complex disease. However, this approach may lead to spurious association when there is population substructure: population stratification (PS) or cryptic relatedness (CR). Two simple approaches to correct for the population substructure are genomic control (GC) and delta centralization (DC). GC uses the variance inflation factor to correct for the variance distortion of a test statistic, and the DC centralizes the non-central chi-square distribution of the test statistic. Both GC and DC have been studied for case-control association studies mainly under a specific genetic model (e.g. recessive, additive or dominant), under which an optimal trend test is available. The genetic model is usually unknown for many complex diseases. In this situation, we study the performance of three robust tests based on the GC and DC corrections in the presence of the population substructure. Our results show that, when the genetic model is unknown, the DC- (or GC-) corrected maximum and Pearson's association test are robust and have good control of Type I error and high power relative to the optimal trend tests in the presence of PS (or CR).",

The current study sought to investigate changes in the ventral language pathways in patients with low-grade glioma located in regions likely to affect the dorsal language pathways. The results revealed no significant difference in fractional anisotropy values in the arcuate fasciculus between groups or between hemispheres. However, fractional anisotropy and lateralization index values in the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus and lateralization index values in the left inferior fronto-occpital fasciculus were higher in patients than in healthy subjects. These results indicate plasticity of language pathways in patients with low-grade glioma. The ventral language pathways may perform more functions in patients than in healthy subjects. As such, it is important to protect the ventral language pathways intraoperatively.",

Methods Clinical data of 186 hospitalized cases from 1997 to 2011 were collected and analyzed.Results Complications were found among 173 cases(93%,173/186),and the complications,in the order of frequency,were:electrolyte disturbances(78.5%, 146/186),secondary infections(61.3%,114/186),ocular lesions(30.6%,57/186),anemia(19.9%,37/186),diabetes mellituses (19.4,36/186),drug eruptions(18.8%,35/186),hypoglycemia(18.8%,35/186),bleedings(18.3%,34/186) and thrombocytopenia (17.2%,32/186).The stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that:1 ) there was a correlation between occurrence of complications and the improper therapy of glucocorticoid;2) the total dosage of glucocorticoid was an independent risk factor for secondary infections,electrolyte disturbances and ENT lesions;3) pulse glucocorticoid therapy was an independent risk factor for bleedings;4) both the pulse therapy and the first dosage of glucocorticoid were the independent risk factors for diabetes mellitus. The fatality rate of these cases was 7.5%(14/186),9 cases due to acute hepatic failure,4 cases due to severe infection and 1 due to fall injury.Conclusion The incidence of complications of these disease was high,which would be the leading cause of death among these cases.Standardized glucocorticoid therapy as well as the correct and timely diagnosis of the complications contributed to reduce the fatality of the disease.",

While many statistical methods have been developed for measurement error or misclassification of exposure variables in epidemiological studies, no studies have been reported on the effect of errors in diagnosing disease on testing genetic association in case-control studies. We study the impact of using the original Cochran-Armitage trend test assuming no diagnostic error when, in fact, cases and controls may be clinically diagnosed by an imperfect gold standard or a reference test. The type I error, sample size and asymptotic power of trend tests are examined under a family of genetic models in the presence of diagnostic error. The empirical powers of the trend tests are also compared by simulation studies under various genetic models.",

        "abstract": "Accidental deaths due to exposure to extremely low natural temperature happen every winter. Exposure to extreme cold causes injury of multiple organs. However, early responses of the bodies to acute extreme cold exposure remain incompletely understood. In this study, we found that hepatic glycogen was rapidly reduced in rats exposed to -15°C, and the key enzymes required for glycogenesis were upregulated in the livers of the cold-exposed rats. In line with the rapid consumption of glycogen, acute cold exposure induced a transient elevation of cellular ATP level, which lasted about one hour. The ATP level went back to basal level after two hours of cold exposure. Four hours of cold exposure resulted in cellular ATP depletion and cell apoptosis. The dynamic change of cellular ATP levels was well associated with Akt activation in cold-exposed liver cells. The activation of Akt was required for cold exposure-induced ATP elevation. Blockade of Akt activation diminished the transient increase of intracellular ATP content and exacerbated cell apoptosis during acute cold exposure. These results suggest that Akt activation plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular bioenergy balance and promoting liver cell survival during acute cold exposure.",

        "abstract": "Although small interfering RNA (siRNA) can silence the expression of disease-related genes, delivery of these highly charged molecules is challenging. Delivery approaches for siRNAs are actively being pursued, and improved strategies are required for nontoxic and efficient delivery for gene knockdown. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) is a natural and endogenous nanoparticle that has a rich history as a delivery vehicle. Here, we examine purified LDL nanoparticles as carriers for siRNAs. When siRNA was covalently conjugated to cholesterol, over 25 chol-siRNA could be incorporated onto each LDL without changing nanoparticle morphology. The resulting LDL-chol-siRNA nanoparticles were selectively taken up into cells via LDL receptor mediated endocytosis, resulting in enhanced gene silencing compared to free chol-siRNA (38% gene knock down versus 0% knock down at 100 nM). However, silencing efficiency was limited by the receptor-mediated entrapment of the LDL-chol-siRNA nanoparticles in endolysosomes. Photochemical internalization demonstrated that endolysosome disruption strategies significantly enhance LDL-mediated gene silencing (78% at 100 nM).",

        "abstract": "Nanobubbles hold potential for expanding utility of ultrasound contrast-based applications to extravascular targets, but their acoustic response and the effects of the surrounding environment remain relatively unexplored. Here we investigate the dynamics of porphyrin-encapsulated nanobubbles (diameter &lt;0.4 µm; 10^6 mL-1) at clinically relevant frequencies (2.5 MHz and 8 MHz) as a function of pressure (0.2 - 1.0 MPa) in vessel- and tissue-mimicking phantoms to gain an understanding of nanobubble behaviour in intra- and extravascular compartments. The results provide the first direct observation that nanobubbles can initiate nonlinear scattering, and that they do so in a pressure-dependent manner. It is further demonstrated that while nanobubbles in confining media require higher pressures for nonlinearities and demonstrate reduced scattering, they can exhibit sustained and non-destructive cavitation. Bubble models are then used to gain mechanistic insights into experimentally observed nanobubble dynamics and confirm sensitivity to nonlinear shell rheology, particularly to radially-dependent surface tension and the characteristic time constant for shear-thinning.",

Long-circulating pyropheophorbide (LC-Pyro) was synthesized with three functional building blocks: 1) a porphyrin photosensitizer for positron-emission tomography (PET)/fluorescence imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT), 2) a urea-based prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting ligand and 3) a peptide linker to prolong the plasma circulation time. With porphyrin's copper-64 chelating and optical properties, LC-Pyro demonstrated its dual-modality (fluorescence/PET) imaging potential for selective and quantitative tumor detection in subcutaneous, orthotopic and metastatic murine models. The peptide linker in LC-Pyro prolonged its plasma circulation time about 8.5 times compared to its truncated analog. High tumor accumulation of LC-Pyro enabled potent PDT, which resulted in significantly delayed tumor growth in a subcutaneous xenograft model. This approach can be applied to improve pharmacokinetics of the existing and future targeted PDT agents for enhanced tumor accumulation and efficacy.",

Easy methods for assessing glucose utilization in vitro and in vivo should find widespread application in biological and biomedical studies, as illustrated by the adoption of FDG PET imaging in medicine. We have recently synthesized a new NIR fluorescent pyropheophorbide conjugate of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), Pyro-2DG, as a GLUT-targeted photosensitizer. In this study, we have evaluated the in vivo uptake of Pyro-2DG and found that Pyro-2DG selectively accumulated in two tumor models, 9L glioma in the rat and c-MYC-induced mammary tumor in the mouse, compared to surrounding normal muscle tissues at a ratio of about 10:1. By simultaneously performing redox ratio and fluorescence imaging, a high degree of correlation between the PN/(Fp+PN) redox ratio, where PN denotes reduced pyridine nucleotides (NADH) and Fp denotes oxidized flavoproteins, and the Pyro-2DG uptake was found in both murine tumor models, indicating that Pyro-2DG could serve as an extrinsic NIR fluorescent metabolic index for the tumors. The fact that only a low level of correlation was observed between the redox ratio and the uptake of Pyro-acid (the free fluorophore without the 2-deoxyglucose moiety) supports the hypothesis that Pyro-2DG is an index of the mitochondrial status (extent of PN reduction) of a tumor.",

Modest therapeutic performance of FDA-approved nanomedicines combined with multiple disappointing clinical trials (such as phase III HEAT trial) have raised questions about the future of nanomedicine. Encouraging breakthroughs, however, have been made in the last few years towards the development of new classes of nanoparticles that can respond to tumor microenvironmental conditions and successfully deliver therapeutic agents to cancer cells. Concurrently, a great deal of effort has also been devoted to alter various parameters of tumor pathophysiology to pre-treat tumors before nanoparticles are administered. Such 'priming' treatments improve access of the systemically administered agents to the tumor and promote drug penetration into the deeper layers of tumor tissue. This review will highlight recent advances in cancer nanomedicine exploiting both nanoparticle design and tumor microenvironment modification; and provide a critical perspective on the future development of nanomedicine delivery in oncology.",

The NewPS has ~100 nm spherical structure with excellent colloidal stability against radical changes in temperature, mechanical agitation, pH and in serum. The NewPS system is amenable to different porphyrin salts (mono-sodium or tris-sodium salt) and oils (low or high density), and is capable of co-loading with chemotherapeutics (paclitaxel). The porphyrin salt shell is essential for the nanostructure construction and enables porphyrin-dependent optical tunability. NewPS consisting of pyropheophorbide a mono-salt (PyroNewPS) has an ordered J-aggregates of porphyrin shell, which produced a narrow, red-shifted (from 671nm to 715nm) Q-band with increased absorbance. Upon nanostructure dissociation, fluorescence and photodynamic reactivity of porphyrin monomers are restored. As a result of the spectrally distinct photoacoustic imaging (at 715nm by intact NewPS) and fluorescence increase (at 671nm by dissociated NewPS), we could track NewPS accumulation and disruption in mice bearing KB tumors to guide effective photodynamic therapy. Substituting the oil core with lipiodol® affords additional CT contrast, whereas loading paclitaxel into NewPS facilitates drug delivery. This simple two-component NewPS offers a new nanoplatform for multimodal cancer imaging, phototherapy and image-guided drug delivery.",

        "abstract": "In whole-genome association studies, at the first stage, all markers are tested for association and their test statistics or p-values are ranked. At the second stage, some most significant markers are further analyzed by more powerful statistical methods. This helps reduce the number of hypotheses to be corrected for in multiple testing. Ranks of true associations in genome-wide scans using a single test statistic have been studied. In a case-control design for association, the trend test has been proposed. However, three different trend tests, optimal for the recessive, additive, and dominant models, respectively, are available for each marker. Because the true genetic model is unknown, we rank markers based on multiple test statistics or test statistics robust to model mis-specification. We studied this problem with application to Problem 3 of Genetic Analysis Workshop 15. An independent simulation study was also conducted to further evaluate the proposed procedure.",

The polarized light of 0° to 180° direction is obtained by the He-Ne laser through the polarizer. The intensity and polarization ratio and the particle size are measured, and the corresponding average, error, and standard deviation of the measurement value are calculated. Furthermore, the results are compared with those measured by non-polarized He-Ne laser. The experiment results indicate that, when the laser is linearly polarized light, the best measurement is acquired under the polarization direction perpendicular to the scattering surface. On the other hand, the reduction of the degree of polarization of the scattering because of the superposition of the scattering particle results in no significant difference in the degree of polarization between linearly polarized light and non-polarized light, which can be used in the measurement with non-polarization He-Ne laser instead.",

        "abstract": "The mechanism of effects for isolation piles on reducing displacements of soil and tunnel below the ground surface needed to be studied. Field measurements were carried out in a deep excavation project in Tianjin，which adopted the isolation piles to protect the adjacent existing tunnel. The deformations of the diaphragm wall，soil outside the excavation，isolation piles and the tunnel were obtained and analyzed. Based on the measured data，a parametric study of isolation piles using finite element method considering the small strain of soil was conducted to investigate the horizontal displacements of the tunnel and the soil below the ground surface adjacent to a deep excavation. It was shown that isolation piles had both effects of isolation and drag on the tunnel adjacent to the deep excavation. The deformation of adjacent tunnel from deep excavation can be increased when the drag effect was more remarkable. The buried isolation pile could be used to minimize the effect of drag and the horizontal displacement of tunnel. Moreover，the isolation piles had higher efficiency in reducing the tunnel displacement when the piles were located closer to the tunnel.",

The data set consisted of TRMM PR observations and collocated National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) and Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere program buoy-measured wind and wave data. The TRMM PR data properties were analyzed with regard to their dependence on spatial resolution, wind speed, relative wind direction, and significant wave height. The KuLMOD model was developed using incidence angles (0.5 to 6.5 deg) and wind speeds (1.5 to  16.5  m/s ) as inputs. The model coefficients were derived by fitting the collocated data. The KuLMOD-derived normalized radar cross section,   σ  0  , was compared with those obtained from the TRMM PR observations and a quasi-specular theoretical model and showed good agreement. With the KuLMOD, the wind speeds were retrieved from the TRMM PR data using the least squares method and validated with the buoy measurements, yielding a root mean square error of  1.45  m/s . The retrieval accuracies for the different incidence angles, wind speeds, and spatial resolutions were obtained.",

The formation mechanism of the CoSb3 phase and the effects of the current and pressure fields on the phase transformation and microstructure evolution are studied in the one-step PAS process. The application of the panoscopic approach to this system and its effect on the transport properties are investigated. The results show that the hierarchical structure forms during the formation of the skutterudite phase under the effects of both current and sintering pressure. The samples fabricated by the OS-PAS technique have defined hierarchical structures, which scatter phonons more intensely over a broader range of frequencies and significantly reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. High-performance bulk Te-doped skutterudite with the maximum ZT of 1.1 at 820 K for the composition CoSb2.875Te0.125 was obtained. Such high ZT values rival those obtained from single filled skutterudites. This newly developed OS-PAS technique enhances the thermoelectric performance, dramatically shortens the synthesis period and provides a facile method for obtaining hierarchical thermoelectric materials on a large scale.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This investigation aimed to develop a simplified semi-empirical method of assessing the deformation of tunnels laterally adjacent to excavations. A finite element analysis using the hardening soil model with small-strain stiffness (HSS model) was performed to study the influence of the excavation depth, the horizontal displacements of retaining structures, and the relative tunnel locations on the responses of existing tunnels. A simplified model was developed based on the numerical results, and a database comprising 14 case histories was collected. Comparisons were made with the generated artificial data and the collected case histories to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model.",

After testing the particle diameter in different measurement area,its mean value and repeatability were analyzed. A conclusion is drawn that a bigger variance will be induced by smaller measurement area in the low concentration solution. On the other hand,smaller mean diameter will be induced by large larger area in the high concentration solution.",

Imaging agents or drugs can be attached to LDL through surface loading, protein loading or core loading methods. The LDL delivery system has received considerable attention particularly among cancer biologists as it was observed that numerous cancers over-express the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). In this paper we investigate the utility of LDL to transport optical imaging contrast agents for caner detection. The method of loading fluorophores into the core of LDL is attractive as it behaves like an activatable contrast agent. Surface and protein labeled methods also prove to be effective strategies for tracing LDL nanoparticle activity. The strengths and limitations of the LDL carrier system are discussed and novel approaches for imaging cancer with LDL nanoparticles are highlighted.",

When they are, their limiting distributions are often Gaussian and easy to use. When they are not, their limiting distributions, if exists, are often non-Gaussian and difficult to evaluate. Thus it is important to have some preliminary assessments of the root-n estimability in these models. In this article, we study this problem for four missing data models: two-point interval censoring, double censoring, interval truncation, and a case-control genetic association model. For the first three models, we identify some parameters which are not root-n estimable. For some root-n estimable parameters, we derive the corresponding information bounds when they exist. Also, as the Cox regression model is commonly used for such data, we give asymptotic efficient information for these regression parameters. For the case-control genetic association model, we compute the asymptotic efficient information and relative efficiency, in relation to that of the full data, when only the case-control status data are available, as is often the case in practice.",

        "abstract": "For a given excavation depth, the deformation forms of the retaining walls are different owing to various retaining structures and bracing systems. Thus the settlement of the soil and the deformation of the adjacent buildings can be considerably different. The responses of buildings adjacent to excavations with different deformation modes of retaining walls are analyzed. The results show that when the retaining walls exhibit kick-in, convex and composite deformation, for the buildings close to the excavations, sagging deformation occurs and its magnitude depends on the settlement of the soil near the retaining walls. Especially for the kick-in and convex deformation modes of the retaining walls, the sagging deformation is the most significant and the tensile strain on the buildings is severe. In this case, the buildings are in the most adverse situation. For any deformation modes of the retaining walls, when the relative distance between the buildings and the excavations is about (1~1.5) times the excavation depth, the excavations will cause obvious hogging deformation and the tensile strain of the buildings. All the buildings at that location are in most adversity.",

The initial viscosity was measured using a controlled-stress rheometer. The adhesive strength was measured according to ISO-10873 recommended procedures. All data were analyzed independently by one-way analysis of variance combined with a Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test at a 5% level of significance.The initial viscosity of all the cream-type denture adhesives was lower than the powder-type adhesives. Before immersion in water, all the powder-type adhesives exhibited higher adhesive strength than the cream-type adhesives. However, the adhesive strength of cream-type denture adhesives increased significantly and exceeded the powder-type denture adhesives after immersion in water. For powder-type adhesives, the adhesive strength significantly decreased after immersion in water for 60 min, while the adhesive strength of the cream-type adhesives significantly decreased after immersion in water for 180 min.Cream-type denture adhesives have lower initial viscosity and higher adhesive strength than powder type adhesives, which may offer better manipulation properties and greater efficacy during application.",

Using this novel strategy, SiPcBOA reconstituted LDL (r-SiPcBOA-LDL) with a very high payload (SiPcBOA to LDL molar ratio >3000 to 35001:1) is obtained. Using electron microscopy, we find reconstituted LDL (rLDL) with such a high payload essentially retains the mean particle size of native LDL. Since acetylated LDL binds to scavenger receptors of endothelial and microglial cells instead of LDLR, SiPcBOA reconstituted acetylated LDL (r-SiPcBOA-AcLDL) is also prepared to serve as a negative control to validate the LDL receptor (LDLR) targeting specificity. Confocal microscopy studies demonstrate that the internalization of r-SiPcBOA-LDL by human hepatoblastoma G2 (HepG2) tumor cells is mediated by LDLR pathway. The in vitro photodynamic therapy (PDT) response of HepG2 cells to r-SiPcBOA-LDL is compared to SiPcBOA (free drug control) using a clonogenic assay. The slopes of the linear regression fit to the logarithmic data for these two plots are significantly different from each other (p=0.0007), indicating greatly enhanced efficacy of LDLR-targeted PDT.",

A published\n case history was used to verify the proposed methodology. By simulating the case history, the determination of parameters\n needed were verified. Then three embankments constructed on different ground conditions with different soil-pile relative\n stiffnesses were analyzed to study pile lateral behaviors including pile deflection and bending moment. The results show that\n pile deflections and bending moments induced by soil lateral deformation and embankment vertical load are different for piles\n at different positions under the same embankment. The relative stiffness between pile and soil affected by the properties\n of different reinforcing piles such as concrete pile and deep mixing method pile exert important effects on the pile lateral\n behavior and the pile’s failure modes. Consequently, it is necessary to consider the different piles lateral behaviors and\n possible failure modes at different positions and the different piles proprieties with different reinforcing methods in the\n embankment stability analysis.",

        "abstract": "Pile tip grouting has been widely adopted in engineering in recent years. However, the improvement effect on piles with different lengths is rarely studied. Based on the parameters verified by finite element of a project in Tianjin and considering the enhancement of grouting, the bearing capacity of piles with different lengths is analyzed. The finite element analysis shows that the ultimate load raises 25%~71% for single piles with length of 20~100 m after grouting. The improvement effect of grouting is very significant for short piles, while that for super-long piles is not the same as that for short piles especially on tip resistance. Tip grouting is propitious to the load transformation to the lower part of the pile, and it is also helpful for the exerting of the tip resistance and the shaft resistance of the lower part of the pile.",

Seismic loading may impact both the critical failure mechanism and its associated bearing capacity. The existing approaches for analyzing the seismic bearing capacity of footings near slopes typically employ coefficients developed to fit the conventions of Terzaghi’s bearing capacity equation, herein referred to as the “superposition method”. In this study, a rigorous assessment of the seismic bearing capacity is performed using an upper-bound limit state plasticity framework known as discontinuity layout optimization (DLO), which makes few prior assumptions concerning the failure geometry. The results show that soil properties, slope configuration, and pseudostatic seismic loading all influence the realized failure mechanism and associated bearing capacity. The use of bearing capacity coefficients that fit within the conventional superposition m...",

This paper introduces the principle of the integrative evaluation on the on-line detection results about the surface contamination states of the transmission line insulators by using fuzzy neural network method. The r.m.s value, the peak value, the amplitude and times of the pulses of leakage current, the environmental temperature and humidity are chosen as input variables. The model establishment of the contamination evaluation based on fuzzy neural network method is recommended emphatically, and the feasibility of method is proved by experiments in laboratory.",

As an example, two jump-and-return sandwich 10-pulse sequences achieved 95% inversion at offsets corresponding to 9.4% and 10.3% of the non-inversion band spacing, compared to 14.7% for the binomial-like W5 inversion sequence, i.e., they afforded non-inversion bands about two thirds the width of the W5 non-inversion band.",

        "abstract": "Based on load distribution of raft foundation of high-rise buildings, it is suggested to arrange piles with a pattern where more piles are located near the center. Through reduced scale (1:10) model test, the composite foundation and composite pile foundation were studied with the presence of model super structure. The studies include the raft settlement, subgrade settlement under pile bottom plane, ground settlement beside raft, reaction force distribution of soil and pile top, axis force and skin friction distribution of pile, and ratio of loads shared by pile and soil under raft. The behavior of composite foundation and composite pile foundation under working load condition were studied. Comparing with composite pile foundation, the experimental results showed that for composite foundation, the total settlement of subgrade is large, the different settlement of raft and the settlement of subgrade are small under pile bottom plane, the skin friction of pile is negative near pile top, and the soil shared more load than the pile. The composite foundation could make use of shallow layer subgrade bearing capability and composite pile foundation could make use of deep layer subgrade bearing capability. The conclusions of this paper may be useful for further theoretical studies and practical design.",

        "abstract": "Since Notch signaling plays a critical role in stem cells and oncogenesis, we hypothesized that Notch signaling might play roles in cancer stem cells and cancer cells with a stem cell phenotype. In this study, we accessed potential functions of the Notch pathway in the formation of cancer stem cells using human glioma. Using RT-PCR, we found that most human astrogliomas of different grades expressed moderate to high level of Notch receptors and ligands. mRNA of Hes5 but not Hes1, both of which are major downstream molecules of the Notch pathway, was also detected. In human glioma cell lines BT325, U251, SHG-44, and U87, mRNA encoding different types of Notch receptors were detected, but active form of Notch1 (NIC) was only detected in SHG-44 and U87 by Western blot. Interestingly, proliferation of these two glioma cell lines appeared faster than that of the other two lines in which NIC was not detected. We have over-expressed NIC of Notch1 in SHG-44 cells by constitutive transfection to evaluate the effects of Notch signaling on glioma cells. Our results showed that over-expression of NIC in SHG-44 cells promoted the growth and the colony-forming activity of SHG-44 cells. Interestingly, over-expression of NIC increased the formation neurosphere-like colonies in the presence of growth factors. These colonies expressed nestin, and could be induced to cells expressing neuron-, astrocyte-, or oligodendrocyte-specific markers, consistent with phenotypes of neural stem cells. These data suggest that Notch signaling promote the formation of cancer stem cell-like cells in human glioma.",

Results show that the pressure difference of spool ends has a nearly linear relationship with the flapper displacement. Through the study of motion characteristics and force status of feedback rod, the steady state force equilibrium equation is established. Considering overall forces and constraint conditions on the components consisting of feedback rod and spool, the steady state finite element model is subsequently established. Steady-state responses of the servo valve with different feedback rods matched can be obtained when the input displacement from the actuator has been given to the software calculation. A suitable feedback rod is selected to meet the design requirements. Finally, a discussion focused on the simplified model which is used in finite element software calculation has been carried out. Results show that the finite element analytic solution equals the software solution well.",

In received nodes,original data can be obtained after enough combined packets are received and decoded.The proposed scheme can effectively reduce the number of retransmission as well as improve the throughput of broadcast system.Based on the Gilbert-Elliott channel model,a multi-state Markov model is generated by uniting the channel state with the reception mode of received nodes. The closed-form expressions are derived for the throughput of RNC-ARQ.Finally,NS-2 simulator is used to evaluate the performance of the propsed scheme.The results show that the proposed RNC-ARQ scheme is better than the SR-ARQ and XOR-ARQ scheme in terms of the throughput.",

A total of 88 manuscripts were selected with 2 new reports of SLNB. The successful rate, accuracy, false-negative rate and sensitivity of SLNB were analyzed by SPSS 10.0 statistical analysis software.Among a total of 6282 patients, the detection rate of SLNB was 90.82% (5705/6282) and the overall false-negative rate 9.69% (259/2671). The prediction sensitivity, specificity, false positive rate, accuracy, negative and positive predictive value of SLN for axillary lymph nodes status were 90.30%, 99.64%, 0.41%, 86.52%, 92.11% and 99.55% respectively.SLNB can accurately predict the axillary lymph node metastasis. And its detection rate is correlated with patient age and tumor location. The detection rate and false-negative rate has nothing to do with the tracer injection site. A combined regimen has a higher detection rate and a low false negative rate. Affecting the whole breast, SLN is not correlated with a particular area of breast. The validation phase of SLNB in breast cancer is currently feasible in China.",

        "abstract": "In-line digital holography is presented for the particles analysis in 3-D. Since the effects of zero order waves, conjugate image and defocused particle images degrade the reconstructed image quality of the focused particles during the reconstruction of in-line digital holography containing small particles at different depths, a numerical method for reducing these effects was proposed. A new subtraction method of reconstructed wave fields was presented for particles analysis. The effects of zero order term, conjugate image and the defocused particle images were simultaneously minimized. Therefore, the contrast of reconstructed amplitude images was improved. This method is useful to slice in-line digital holograms to display only in-focus particles at any particular plane. Furthermore, this process is accomplished from a single hologram without additionally required pre or post processing. The theory, simulation results and experimental examples were also given.",

Countermeasures include ground sleeve valve pipe grouting, top-down method of metro station excavation, diaphragm cut-off wall of confined water, freezing method outside the end well, and optimized parameters of shield tunneling. The settlements of the historic buildings induced by underlying tunneling, dewatering and excavation of nearby underground metro station, freezing and grouting outside end well are measured and analyzed. The field measured data show that the settlements of buildings can be minimized by applying the optimized shield tunneling parameters. Leakage during the construction of horizontal freezing hole and tunneling may cause significant settlement of overlying buildings. The building with large weight can hardly be lifted by grouting when there is soft clayey soil layer between building foundation and grouting. While the building with small weight can be lifted under such conditions. However, the rise of the building can be part offset by the consolidation of soft clayey soil due to the dissipation of the excessive pore water pressure generated during grouting. Freezing zone is vital to leakage prevention during tunneling in the freezing zone before the shield enters the end well. The effect must be evaluated, especially before the large jack force is adopted to advance the shield.",

        "abstract": "The transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) is a standard method to detect association using family trio design. It is optimal for an additive genetic model. Other TDT-type tests optimal for recessive and dominant models have also been developed. Association tests using family data, including the TDT-type statistics, have been unified to a class of more comprehensive and flexable family-based association tests (FBAT). TDT-type tests have high efficiency when the genetic model is known or correctly specified, but may lose power if the model is mis-specified. Hence tests that are robust to genetic model mis-specification yet efficient are preferred. Constrained likelihood ratio test (CLRT) and MAX-type test have been shown to be efficiency robust. In this paper we propose a new efficiency robust procedure, referred to as adaptive TDT (aTDT). It uses the Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium coefficient to identify the potential genetic model underlying the data and then applies the TDT-type test (or FBAT for general applications) corresponding to the selected model. Simulation demonstrates that aTDT is efficiency robust to model mis-specifications and generally outperforms the MAX test and CLRT in terms of power. We also show that aTDT has power close to, but much more robust, than the optimal TDT-type test based on a single genetic model. Applications to real and simulated data from Genetic Analysis Workshop (GAW) illustrate the use of our adaptive TDT.",

        "abstract": "In genome-wide association studies (GWAS), single-marker analysis is usually employed to identify the most significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The trend test has been proposed for analysis of case-control association. Three trend tests, optimal for the recessive, additive and dominant models respectively, are available. When the underlying genetic model is unknown, the maximum of the three trend test results (MAX) has been shown to be robust against genetic model misspecification. Since the asymptotic distribution of MAX depends on the allele frequency of the SNP, using the P-value of MAX for ranking may be different from using the MAX statistic. Calculating the P-value of MAX for 300,000 (300 K) or more SNPs is computationally intensive and the software and program to obtain the P-value of MAX are not widely available. On the other hand, the MAX statistic is very easy to calculate without complex computer programs. Thus, we study whether or not one could use the MAX statistic instead of its P-value to rank SNPs in GWAS. The approaches using the MAX and its P-value to rank SNPs are referred to as MAX-rank and P-rank. By applying MAX-rank and P-rank to simulated and four real datasets from GWAS, we found the ranks of SNPs with true association are very similar using both approaches. Thus, we recommend to use MAX-rank for genome-wide scans. After the top-ranked SNPs are identified, their P-values based on MAX can be calculated and compared with the significance level.",

        "abstract": "Experimental and occupational exposure to methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) has been reported to induce neurotoxicological and neurobehavioral effects, such as headache, nausea, dizziness, and disorientation, etc. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in MTBE-induced neurotoxicity are still not well understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of MTBE on spatial memory and the expression and function of GABA(A) receptor in the hippocampus. Our results demonstrated that intraventricular injection of MTBE impaired the performance of the rats in a Morris water maze task, and significantly increased the expression of GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit in the hippocampus. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 decreased after the MTBE injection. Furthermore, the decreased ability of learning and the reduction of phosphorylated ERK1/2 level of the MTBE-treated rats was partly reversed by bicuculline injected 30 min before the training. These results suggested that MTBE exposure could result in impaired spatial memory. GABA(A) receptor may play an important role in the MTBE-induced impairment of learning and memory by regulating the phosphorylation of ERK in the hippocampus.",

        "abstract": "To employ a laser triangulation method for measuring the dynamic shrinkage of composite resins during polymerization, and to investigate the maximum shrinkage rate (S(max)) and the time at maximum shrinkage rate (t(max)).A novel experimental set-up based on laser triangulation was utilized which was capable of real-time shrinkage strain measurements. Uncured composite was condensed into a PTFE mould and irradiated for 40 s. The laser signals obtained from lateral composite surfaces were monitored using a laser triangulation measuring system and were converted into the displacement of the tested surface. The volumetric shrinkage derived from the linear shrinkage was calculated by multiplying 3. Total volumetric shrinkage (%S) of the five restorative materials (AP-X, Charmfill, Charisma, Durafill VS, and Herculite Precis) was measured using three methods (laser triangulation method, Acuvol, and buoyancy method). S(max) and t(max) were measured using the laser triangulation method. Statistical analyses were done using the two-way ANOVA (P<0.05) and post hoc test.The highest shrinkage value was measured by Acuvol, followed by laser method, and the lowest was by buoyancy method. All the three methods of measuring %S generated the same, statistically secured ranking for the five light-cured restorative materials: DurafillVS < AP-X < Herculite Precis < Charisma < Charmfill. %S measured by laser triangulation method varied between 2.06% and 3.37%. S(max) varied between 4.39 μm/s and 29.25 μm/s. t(max) varied between 0.77 s and 1.59 s. Significant differences in S(max) (F=734.87,P<0.01) and t(max) (F=53.24,P< 0.01) for five composite resins were found.Laser triangulation method offers several advantages over the conventional methods of measuring polymerization shrinkage. It is simple, compact, non-invasive and suitable for measuring the dynamic polymerization shrinkage in real time without delay. Therefore, it can be used to characterize the shrinkage kinetics in a wide range of visible-light-cure materials.",

The adopted method is a recent algebraic method originally introduced by Fliess and Sira-Ramirez. Firstly, the fractional derivative of the output of an arbitrary order is exactly given by a new algebraic formula in continuous noise free case without knowing the initial conditions of the considered system. Secondly, a digital fractional order differentiator is introduced in discrete noisy cases, which can provide robust estimations in finite-time. Then, some error analysis is given, where an error bound useful for the selection of the design parameter is provided. Finally, numerical examples illustrate the accuracy and the robustness of the proposed fractional order differentiator.",

        "abstract": "The receiver area of Photomultipier Tube(PMT) must be smaller than the coherence area,which is the only criterion of detector aperture in Dynamic Light Scattering(DLS) system,other than a definite size of receiver aperture.The noise of the DLS system is analysed,the Poisson Noise of PMT is the main noise of the system under the condition that the temperature of the surrounding is invariable and the PMT is cooled well.The signal-to-noise power ratio(S2/N2) of the PMT is deduced based on spatial coherence and statistics of photon and the best receiver aperture ratio is calculated under the condition that S2/N2 is the biggest.Furthermore,with two given pin holes,the biggest S2/N2 can be reached by adjusting the distance between them.Finally,the theory conclusion is proved through the test of autocorrelation curve with different receive aperture ratio.",

        "abstract": "In order to simulate the dynamic light scattering signal of superfine particles, an auto-regressive (AR) model of the random process is made by analyzing the character of dynamic light scattering signal. The module parameter is identified by Levison-Durbin algorithm and the method of selecting module order is given when scattering signal of unimodal and bimodal distribution particles is simulated. Thus a simulative method of dynamic light scattering signal based on AR module is put forward. By this method, the scattered signal of 50 nm, 300 nm, 1000 nm and scattered signal of 50 nm and 1000 nm, 100 nm and 500 nm, 300 nm and 1000 nm were respectively simulated when the module order was 1, 1, 1, 57, 28, 40. Their simulative autocorrelation function of light intensity accords with their theoretical autocorrelation function. The unimodal distribution's relative error of inverting particles size by cumulants and the bimodal distribution's relative error of inverting particles size by double exponential were respectively less than 0.58%, 3.7%. The results show that the signal simulation of unimodal distribution particles need one order module, and the signal simulation of bimodal distribution particles with different sizes need different order module.",

        "abstract": "The matched trend test (MTT), developed using a conditional logistic regression, has been proposed to test for association in matched case-control studies to control the bias of known confounding effects and reduce the potential impact of population stratification. The MTT requires a known genetic model. When the genetic model is unknown, a Monte Carlo robust test, MAX, has been proposed for the analysis of matched case-control studies. The MAX statistic takes the maximum of three MTTs optimal for three common genetic models. We derive the asymptotic power for MTTs and robust tests. In particular, we derive the asymptotic p-value for MAX. Using these analytical results, we conduct simulation studies to compare the performance of MAX and the two-degree-of-freedom Chi-square test for matched case-control studies, where the latter is implemented in most computing software. Our simulation results show that MAX is always asymptotically more powerful than the two-degree-of-freedom Chi-square test under common genetic models. Our results provide guidelines for the analysis of genetic association using matched case-control data. An illustration of our results to a real matched pair case-control etiologic study of sarcoidosis is given.",

Porphyrin incorporation into biomimetic lipoproteins allows one to take advantage of the inherent multimodal photophysical properties of porphyrin, yielding various fluorescence, photoacoustic as well as photodynamic agents. To facilitate their incorporation into a lipoprotein structure, porphyrins have been conjugated through a variety of strategies. However, the effects of the conjugate structure on the associated nanoparticle's phototherapeutic properties warrants further investigation. Herein, we systemically investigated the effects of two widely utilized porphyrin conjugates - oleylamide and lipid, on biophotonic properties of their resultant porphyrin-lipoprotein nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, we demonstrated that incorporation of the porphyrin moiety as an oleylamide conjugate leads to a highly stable J-aggregate with strong photoacoustic contrast, while incorporation as an ampiphilic lipid moiety into the lipid shell yields an effective fluorescent and photodynamic agent. The current study proposes a rational design strategy for next-generation lipoprotein-based phototheranostic agents, where nanoassembly-driven biophotonic and therapeutic properties can be tailored through the specific selection of porphyrin conjugate structures.",

        "abstract": "A power calculation is crucial in planning genetic studies. In genetic association studies, the power is often calculated using the expected number of individuals with each genotype calculated from an assumed allele frequency under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Since the allele frequency is often unknown, the number of individuals with each genotype is random and so a power calculation assuming a known allele frequency may be incorrect. Ambrosius et al. recently showed that the power ignoring this randomness may lead to studies with insufficient power and proposed averaging the power due to the randomness. We extend the method of averaging power in two directions. First, for testing association in case-control studies, we use the Cochran-Armitage trend test and find that the time needed for calculating the averaged power is much reduced compared to the chi-square test with two degrees of freedom studied by Ambrosius et al. A real study is used for illustration of the method. Second, we extend the method to linkage analysis, where the number of identical-by-descent alleles shared by siblings is random. The distribution of identical-by-descent numbers depends on the underlying genetic model rather than the allele frequency. The robust test for linkage analysis is also examined using the averaged powers. We also recommend a sensitivity analysis when the true allele frequency or the number of identical-by-descent alleles is unknown.",

For example, the upper part of a pile inclines due to flexural deformation while the lower part still remains vertical. Based on the results from load-tests on totally inclined piles and finite element analyses, finite element models are constructed to analyze the bearing capacity of partially inclined pile. Finite element analyses show that under the same vertical load, settlement of partially inclined pile with the degree of inclination within 5 % is smaller than that of vertical pile. When it is above 5 %, settlement of partially inclined pile is greater than that of vertical pile. Under the same vertical load, settlement of partially inclined pile with the degree of inclination within 7 % is smaller than that of totally inclined pile with the same degree of inclination, while when it is above 7 %, the trend reverses. For partially inclined pile, axial load transferred to the top of lower part of inclined pile will produce a lateral force on the lower part, which will lead to larger inflection deformation and moment in the lower part of the partially inclined pile especially when the joining point is below the point of inflection. The deeper the joining point, is the greater the lateral displacement is at partially inclined pile top, which will certainly make it easier for the inclined pile to fail due to excessive flexural deformation.",

        "abstract": "We designed and synthesized a folate receptor-targeted, water-soluble, and pharmacomodulated photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent that selectively detects and destroys the targeted cancer cells while sparing normal tissue. This was achieved by minimizing the normal organ uptake (e.g., liver and spleen) and by discriminating between tumors with different levels of folate receptor (FR) expression. This construct (Pyro-peptide-Folate, PPF) is composed of three components: (1) pyropheophorbide a (Pyro) as an imaging and therapeutic agent, (2) peptide sequence as a stable linker and modulator improving the delivery efficiency, and (3) Folate as a homing molecule targeting FR-expressing cancer cells. We observed an enhanced accumulation of PPF in KB cancer cells (FR+) compared to HT 1080 cancer cells (FR-), resulting in a more effective post-PDT killing of KB cells over HT 1080 or normal CHO cells. The accumulation of PPF in KB cells can be up to 70% inhibited by an excess of free folic acid. The effect of Folate on preferential accumulation of PPF in KB tumors (KB vs HT 1080 tumors 2.5:1) was also confirmed in vivo. In contrast to that, no significant difference between the KB and HT 1080 tumor was observed in case of the untargeted probe (Pyro-peptide, PP), eliminating the potential influence of Pyro's own nonspecific affinity to cancer cells. More importantly, we found that incorporating a short peptide sequence considerably improved the delivery efficiency of the probe--a process we attributed to a possible peptide-based pharmacomodulation--as was demonstrated by a 50-fold reduction in PPF accumulation in liver and spleen when compared to a peptide-lacking probe (Pyro-K-Folate, PKF). This approach could potentially be generalized to improve the delivery efficiency of other targeted molecular imaging and photodynamic therapy agents.",

        "abstract": "Local disease control is a major problem in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, because curative-intent surgery is onlypossible in a minority of patients, and radiotherapy cannot be delivered in curative doses. Despite the promise ofphotothermal therapy (PTT) for ablation of pancreatic tumors, this approach remains under investigated. Usingphotothermal sensitizers in combination with laser light for PTT can result in more efficient conversion of light energyto heat, and confinement of thermal destruction to the tumor, thus sparing adjacent organs and vasculature. Porphyrinshave been previously employed as photosensitizers for PDT and PTT, however their incorporation in to “porphysomes”,lipid-based nanoparticles each containing ~80,000 porphyrins through conjugation of pyropheophorbide tophospholipids, carries two distinct advantages: 1) high-density porphyrin packing imparts the nanoparticles withenhanced photonic properties for imaging and phototherapy; 2) the enhanced permeability and retention effect may beexploited for optimal delivery of porphysomes to the tumor region thus high payload porphyrin delivery. The feasibilityof porphysome-enhanced PTT for pancreatic cancer treatment was investigated using a patient-derived orthotopicpancreas xenograft tumor model. Uptake of porphysomes at the orthotopic tumor site was validated using ex vivofluorescence imaging of intact organs of interest. The accumulation of porphysomes in orthotopic tumor microstructurewas also confirmed by fluorescence imaging of excised tissue slices. PTT progress was monitored as changes in tumorsurface temperature using IR optical imaging. Histological analyses were conducted to examine microstructure changesin tissue morphology, and the viability of remaining tumor tissues following exposure to heat. These studies may alsoprovide insight as to the contribution of heat sink in application of thermal therapies to highly vascularized pancreatictumors.",

One of these conjugates, TCL17, was successfully used to label LDL to give a new NIRF, TCL17-LDL. Ex vivo biological studies on an LDLr overexpressing tumor model, human hepatoblastoma G(2) (HepG(2)), confirmed that this NIRF were internalized selectively by the tumor and detected with high sensitivity by a low-temperature 3-D redox scanner.",

        "abstract": "In order to conquer the deficiency of the multicast service provided by IEEE 802.11, a multicast MAC protocol called MPNC based on network coding was proposed for the wireless local area network (WLAN). By extending the previous proposed ELBP protocol, MPNC exploited network coding group to transmit multicast data frames. In multicast source node, the data frames were combined with random linear codes to transmit. In received nodes, the data frames were decoded after receiving enough combined frames. The scheme can effectively reduce the number of transmission and improve the throughput efficiency. Based on the 2-dim Markov chain model for the channel contention of terminals, analytic solutions were derived for the saturation throughput of MPNC under the error-prone channels. Finally, NS-2 simulator was used to evaluate the performance of MPNC under the condition of different bit error rates and the number of multicast users. The results show that MPNC can achieve better performance than LBP and ELBP protocols in terms of throughput. Further, the results validate the conclusion of the theory analysis.",

The construction of underground Passenger Transfer Center of Tianjin Transport Hub was carried out by top-down method. The vertical displacement of steel pipe columns supported by the piles beneath the bottom of excavation was measured. The corresponding numerical analysis was also conducted. The measured data and numerical analysis show that excavation can induce a large heave of piles, which is 33, mm in this project until the bottom slab is finished. Considerable differential heave occurred among steel pipe columns and between steel pipe columns and diaphragm walls. The heave of steel pipe columns developed with fluctuation during staged dewatering, excavation and slab casting. The basal heave of soil also induced considerable tensile force in the piles. At different locations of excavation, the tension stress in the piles and the shaft friction of the piles are obviously different. This difference is partly due to the fact that the piles near the diaphragm wall were affected by the deformation of diaphragm walls. Although there was a large load on the top of the piles, large tensile force still occurred in the middle and lower part of the piles after excavation, which should be considered in the design.",

Cumulative evidences indicate that lead (Pb) exposure alters cerebral Cu homeostasis, which may underlie the development of neurodegenerative diseases. This study investigated the roles of Cu transporter 1 (CTR1) and ATP7A, two Cu transporters, in Pb-induced Cu accumulation in the choroidal epithelial cells. Pb exposure resulted in increased intracellular (64)Cu retention, accompanying with up-regulated CTR1 level. Knockdown of CTR1 using siRNA before Pb exposure diminished the Pb-induced increase of (64)Cu uptake. The expression level of ATP7A was down-regulated following the Pb exposure. ATP7A siRNA knockdown, or PCMB treatment, inhibited the (64)Cu efflux from the cells, while the following additional incubation with Pb failed to further increase the intracellular (64)Cu retention. Cu exposure, or intracellular Cu accumulation following the tetracycline (Tet)-induced overexpression of CTR1, did not result in significant change in ATP7A expression. Taken together, these data indicate that CTR1 and ATP7A play important roles in Cu transport in choroidal epithelial cells, and the Pb-induced intracellular Cu accumulation appears to be mediated, at least in part, via the alteration of CTR1 and ATP7A expression levels following Pb exposure.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the photocatalytic applications of silver chloride have been paid closed attention for the excellent ability to photodegrade organic pollutants. Comparing with other catalysts, the silver chloride presents outstanding photocatalytic activity. However, it also suffers from the poor photocatalytic stability. This very paper is focusing on the one-step wet chemical process of preparing Ag/AgCl/GO photocatalyst with high photocatalytic activity and stability. The detailed characterizations were particularly carried out in order to investigate the photo-catalytic activity and stability. Meanwhile the morphology, chemical composition as well as crystalline structure were investigated. It is found that the as-prepared Ag/AgCl/GO composite exhibited an ultrahigh photocatalytic activity and stability in the process of photodegrading RhB. The unique catalytic activity has been discussed based on the SPR effect in Ag nanoparticles on AgCl surface and the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, the primary benefit of the stability owes a great deal to GO which can capture the photo-generated electrons in case they reduce Ag ion or recombine the excited holes.",

Combining two regularization parameter criterions of GCV and L-curve, two non-negative regularization methods are studied. The study results show that, compared with TIK, TSVD has bigger truncation effect, poorer smoothness and narrower distribution width of inversion PSD, in the case of noise, TSVD has smaller relative error and peak value error of PSD, better capacity to discriminate bimodality and stronger anti-noise, but at noise-free case, TSVD hasn't obvious advantages, TIK and TSVD are respectively more suitable for using GCV and L-curve criterion to determine the regularization parameter. © 2005 - 2013 JATIT & LLS.

After given a formal definition of functional backward observability (BO), an easily testable condition is found. The fulfillment of the obtained condition allows for the reconstruction of the trajectories of the system under consideration using the actual and past values of the system output and some of its derivatives. The methodology we follow consists in an iterative algorithm based upon the classical Silverman algorithm used for inversion of linear systems. By using basic module theory we manage to prove that the proposed algorithm is convergent. A direct application of studying functional observability is that a condition can be derived for systems with distributed delays also, we do this as a case of study. The obtained results are illustrated by two examples, one is merely academic but illustrates clearly the kind of systems which the proposed methodology works for and the other is a practical system with distributed delays.",

        "abstract": "The analysis was conducted on the monitoring data of the excavation for section 2 of Tianjin railway station underground transfer centre. The data included horizontal displacement of diaphragm wall, heave and differential displacement of columns and earth pressure in the passive zone. It was shown that the position of the maximum horizontal displacement of normal diaphragm wall occurred at the exaction bottom when the excavation was completed. However, for the T-shaped diaphragm wall the maximum horizontal displacement occurred at the middle of the wall above the excavation bottom even through the fourth underground story had been completed. The horizontal displacement of diaphragm wall during the excavation would be reduced due to the spatial effect of excavation. The heave of columns had an obvious space-time effect. The heave was closely related to distance between the column and the diaphragm wall, slab pouring, excavation sequence, etc. Although the maximum heave exceeded the control value, the differential deformation was still in the control range and the structure was not damaged yet. So the request of heave alarm value for columns could be relaxed appropriately and the differential deformation could be chosen as the key control criterion. The earth pressure in the active zone, the distribution and variation of which being related to the flexure form and lateral displacement trend, presented curve distribution and changed slightly during the construction.",

Through the minimum distance method,a solution with best forming approach is obtained from the pareto optimal solutions,and it is used as the center point of the next region of interest.The optimal drawbead restraint force will be obtained by the iterative procedure.The optimal design geometric parameters of drawbead can be obtained using the optimal drawbead restraint force and genetic algorithm.These optimal parameters can be efficiently used to improve the forming properties of sheet.Numerical examples indicate that the present method has higher precision and practicability compared with the existing techniques.",

The simulative autocorrelation functions(ACFs) of unimodal size distribution particles of 200~600 nm and bimodal size distribution particles of 200~900 nm were inversed by the inverse range fixed and self-adaptive algorithms. Compared to the fixed algorithm, the self-adaptive algorithm is more precise and noise-tolerant. For unimodal distribution particles, it can reduce peak value error by 4.73% and peak width error by 185 nm at most. For bimodal distribution particles, when the noise level is 0~0.001, its peak value errors are less than by 11.33%, by 12.45%, and its peak width errors are less than 35 nm, 160 nm. While, the fixed algorithm cannot get reasonable results when the noise level is greater than 0.0001. Therefore, this self-adaptive adjustment method of inverse range can effectively optimize the inverse results.",

        "abstract": "To detect association between a genetic marker and a disease in case-control studies, the Cochran-Armitage trend test is typically used. The trend test is locally optimal when the genetic model is correctly specified. However, in practice, the underlying genetic model, and hence the optimal trend test, are usually unknown. In this case, Pearson's chi-squared test, the maximum of three trend test statistics (optimal for the recessive, additive, and dominant models), and the test based on genetic model selection (GMS) are useful. In this article, we first modify the existing GMS method so that it can be used when the risk allele is unknown. Then we propose a new approach by excluding a genetic model that is not supported by the data. Using either the model selection or exclusion, the alternative space is reduced conditional on the observed data, and hence the power to detect a true association can be increased. Simulation results are reported and the proposed methods are applied to the genetic markers identified from the genome-wide association studies conducted by the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium. The results demonstrate that the genetic model exclusion approach usually performs better than existing methods under its worst situation across scientifically plausible genetic models we considered.",

Thus, the development of combination therapeutics that can not only accelerate Aβ clearance but also simultaneously protect neurons or inhibit other subsequent pathological cascade represents a promising strategy for AD intervention. Here, we designed a nanostructure, monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1)-modified reconstituted high density lipoprotein (GM1-rHDL), that possesses antibody-like high binding affinity to Aβ, facilitates Aβ degradation by microglia, and Aβ efflux across the blood–brain barrier (BBB), displays high brain biodistribution efficiency following intranasal administration, and simultaneously allows the efficient loading of a neuroprotective peptide, NAP, as a nanop...",

Key management is the bottleneck. To solve this problem, a new scheme named Satellite Multiple Group Key Management (SMGKM) is proposed in this paper. Users are divided into subgroups according to their access ability to the resources. Subgroup controllers are set in each subgroup. Multiple group key management is carried out by the construction of group key management graph and subgroup key management structure. The proposed scheme has forward and backward secrecy. In contrast with the existing schemes, SMGKM decreases the amount of keys stored in the satellite and the rekeying amount of the satellite efficiently. It is suited for multiple group key management under large and dynamic satellite multicast environment.",

PDT is performed using the photosensitizer pyropheophorbide-2-deoxyglucosamide (Pyro-2DG), which utilizes the glucose import pathway. It is found that Pyro-2DG-induced PDT resulting in a highly oxidized state of tumor mitochondria. This is determined from the redox ratio changes derived from the intrinsic oxidized flavoprotein (Fp) and reduced pyridine nucleotide (PN) [i.e., reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)] fluorescence signals observed using a cryoimager. Thus, the redox ratio is a sensitive indicator for providing reliable and informative measurements of PDT-induced tissue damage. In the PDT treated region of the tumor, highly oxidized flavoprotein and diminishing NADH fluorescence is detected, suggesting that flavoprotein and NADH are oxidized by singlet oxygen produced in the photosensitization process.",

However, less attention has been given to minimizing drug toxicity to non-targeted cells to enhance therapeutic selectivity.Herein, we report on the use of a newly developed high-density lipoprotein-mimicking peptide-phospholipid nanoscaffold (HPPS) to deliver a lipophilic drug, paclitaxel oleate (PTXOL).The formulated PTXOL HPPS (120:1) drastically increased therapeutic selectivity by reducing cytotoxicity of PTXOL to nontargeted cells. Using mice bearing targeted (KB) and nontargeted (HT1080) tumors as models, we demonstrated that tumor volume of nontargeted cells was decreased to 57% by PTXOL treatment but increased to 1220% by PTXOL HPPS treatment. However, upon treatment of paclitaxel, PTXOL and PTXOL HPPS, tumor volumes of targeted groups were reduced to 85, 50 and 63%, respectively.These data strongly suggest that HPPS can attenuate toxicity of anticancer drugs to nontargeted cells, resulting in cell-killing efficacy only on targeted cells.",

Although peak phase distortions can be lessened by the incorporation of anti-phase purging sequences, the sensitivity is substantially decreased. Techniques for lessening the effect of homonuclear J-coupling evolution in spin-echo-based experiments have been investigated. Two potentially useful candidates include a J-compensated inversion sequence that is efficient over a wide range of J-coupling values and a pulse sequence that refocuses homonuclear J-evolution during the spin-echo. The latter was found to work superbly on samples containing two spin (AX or AB) systems and still provided significant advantage over the standard method on samples containing more complicated spin systems. Implementation of this J-refocusing technique into a PGSE-type experiment (J-PGSE) leads to dramatic improvement of spectra and easier data analysis. The J-PGSE sequence should find applications in many diffusion studies where the PGSE-type method is required and should be a viable alternative to PGSTE especially in dilute samples due to its enhanced sensitivity.",

The promise of nanomedicine lies in the tumor microenvironment in which solid tumors are characterized by a leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage. This microenvironment enables the permeation of nano-sized particles from blood vessels to the tumor interstitial space and the retention of the particles within the tumor. This phenomenon, termed ‘the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect’ [1], is used to deliver high payloads of drugs or imaging agents with tumor specificity, better than small molecules.;While the distinctive tumor microenvironment enabling the EPR effect is hailed as the cornerstone of cancer nanomedicine, the tumor microenvironment is also one of its greatest barriers. The tumor microenvironment has abnormal vasculature, elevated interstitial fluid pressure and deregulated extracellular matrix components, which disfavor the EPR effect. These characteristics limit the ability to effectively deliver nanomedicines in sufficient quantities and homogenously throughout the tumor, thus impacting imaging sensitivity and specificity, and therapeutic efficacy [2].;To address this issue, there has been a movement in the field to improve the delivery of nanoparticles to tumors. A number of strategies have been reported and can be organized into two categories: improving the EPR effect and bypassing the EPR effect. Improving the EPR effect involves modifying biological conditions, whether through altering the overall physiological condition or specifically the tumor microenvironment. Alternatively, bypassing the EPR effect refers to strategies that do not heavily rely on the leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage of tumors for delivery. By developing these new methods, researchers hope to increase accumulation and improve the intratumoral distribution of nanoparticles.;Tumor vasculature is not only leaky but also irregular in diameter, shape and density, and contains discontinuous vessels. This results in poor and heterogeneous perfusion in the tumor, elevated interstitial fluid pressure from the extravasation of fluid, and can also create hypoxic and acidic conditions. This environment prevents the penetration of nanoparticles and also contributes to tumor progression, metastasis and drug resistance [3].;To improve perfusion in the tumor, the overall physiological condition of the patient can be altered. For example, Nagamitsu et al. induced systemic hypertension in patients with solid tumors using angiotensin II during infusion of nanoparticles [4]. They found that this strategy increased the accumulation of nanoparticles and resulted in improved therapeutic response, less toxicity and a shorter time to achieve tumor regression [5].;While inducing hypertension has shown to be a promising approach clinically, augmenting the EPR effect through a strategy that alters the physiological condition of the patient has challenges since it may have a whole body effect. In the case of inducing hypertension, the patient population that may undergo this treatment is limited to those who are not already on antihypertensive medication. While in some countries hypertension is not prevalent, such as Japan where the current study was conducted, in other countries such as the USA, where approximately a third of the population have hypertension [6], fewer patients may be eligible for this treatment. Therefore, strategies augmenting the EPR effect that may have a whole body effect will have to take into consideration the demographic of the population in its eligibility to alter the standard of care for cancer treatment.;Another strategy to improve the EPR effect is to target the tumor microenvironment. It has been shown that repairing the abnormal vasculature in tumors can increase the accumulation of small nanoparticles by reducing the interstitial fluid pressure in the tumor [7]. Furthermore, other approaches utilize external stimuli to promote the vascular supply, increase perfusion and permeability of nanoparticles using methods such as hyperthermia [8] and radiation therapy [9]. Combination therapies have also been explored with nanomedicine in which a therapy primes the tumor region for nanoparticles by targeting cancer cells in the perivascular region which are a barrier to nanoparticle penetration [10]. Sano et al. used photoimmunotherapy targeted to destroy perivascular cancer cells prior to injection of nanoparticles and observed an enhanced uptake of nanoparticles in the tumor and distribution of the nanoparticle throughout the tumor [11]. Another study used radiation therapy targeted to the perivascular cells prior to administration of nanoparticles and also observed enhanced uptake of nanoparticles and improved therapeutic responses [12]. Combined therapies have shown to be effective in improving the uptake and distribution of nanoparticles in tumors. These are promising approaches, although since the enhancement effect is temporary, the optimal time frame for nanoparticle administration needs to be identified. Furthermore, many of these therapies target the perivascular cells in tumors in which overtreatment may result in vascular shut down and limited delivery of nanoparticles.;While the field of cancer nanomedicine has been working vigorously toward improving the EPR effect, more recently, attention has been drawn to whether or not the EPR effect is actually clinically relevant or predominantly observed in animal models. This controversy stems from the lack of data from patients showing improved therapeutic efficacy, despite the successes observed in animal models [13]. This has led to some research groups working toward delivering nanomedicines without relying on the EPR phenomenon, which we refer to as bypassing the EPR effect.;Strategies have been developed to deliver nanoparticles without reliance on the permeability of the tumor vasculature. Ye et al. developed a fluorescent peptide that could form nanoparticles in situ in tumors. They proposed this strategy for imaging the detection of treatment response. The fluorescent peptide would penetrate tumors due to its small size and then would be activated to form nanoparticles by cleavage of the peptide by enzymes present in the apoptotic cells [14]. Perrault and Chan also used a similar approach in which gold nanoparticles and a fluorescent contrast agent were assembled in vivo for the detection of tumors [15]. In situ assembly of the nanoparticle components harnesses the advantages of small molecules (rapid influx) and nanoparticles (prolonged retention).;Microbubbles have been developed for drug delivery as well as the delivery of nanoparticles by either encapsulating or tethering nanoparticles to the surface of the microbubbles. Microbubbles have been shown to induce transient vascular permeability when they are burst by ultrasound which allows the delivery of these particles from the blood stream into the tumor [16]. In a work reported in Nature Nanotechnology in 2015, Huynh et al. discovered that porphyrin-based microbubbles could be converted into nanoparticles in situ by ultrasound [17,18]. After systemic injection, bursting the microbubbles with ultrasound would increase the permeability of the vasculature, while forming and delivering porphyrin nanoparticles to the tumor, then used for imaging or therapy. The porphyrin microbubble not only serves the role of carrying the components to form the nanoparticle but is also the instrument by which the nanoparticle is able to enter the tumor. Therefore, using this micro-to-nano strategy, there is no dependence on the tumor microenvironment to deliver the nanoparticle. The emergence of these strategies that do not rely on the permeability of the EPR effect may have great clinical impact due to the ability to deliver high payloads of imaging agent or drug, while minimizing the reliance on aspects of the tumor microenvironment for delivery.;The development of nanomedicines rely heavily on the preclinical models on which they are tested. It is well established that these models, especially tumor xenografts, display the EPR effect regardless of tumor subtypes [19], which has led to nanomedicines demonstrating exciting leaps forward in cancer imaging and therapy. Unfortunately, the successes preclinically are not observed, or to the same extent, clinically in patients. It is unknown, and requiring further studies, to determine whether preclinical models accurately represent all aspects of the EPR effect and if they are also present in patients with various cancer types and stages. A better clinical understanding of the EPR effect is needed to determine why certain nanomedicines have failed clinically, and how these issues can be addressed. Furthermore, how the EPR effect changes with tumor heterogeneity intratumorally and between different tumor types and stages is also necessary to develop clinically relevant animal models and nanomedicines for those particular scenarios.;There will not be one universal strategy for all tumors or even for the same tumor type. The heterogeneity experienced in each tumor identifies a need for personalized treatment plans. This could include a method of identifying or characterizing patient tumors that will respond to certain nanomedicine therapeutic strategies prior to treatment. Therefore, the field of nanomedicine extends far beyond the chemists who create the nanoparticles. It requires biologists who will investigate the effects of nanomedicine and develop preclinical models that will translate into patient tumor scenarios. It needs physicists who will develop imaging tools to noninvasively understand the tumor microenvironment to predict nanomedicine responses in patients. The field of nanomedicine is the crossroad of an interdisciplinary effort to develop strategies to combat cancer, demanding the strengths of each discipline.",

        "abstract": "The Masquelet's induced membrane technique for repairing bone defects has been demonstrated to be a promising treatment strategy. Previous studies have shown that the vessel density of induced membrane is decreased in the late stage of membrane formation, which consequently disrupts the bone healing process. However, relatively little is known about certain mechanisms of vessel degeneration in the induced membrane tissue and whether promotion of angiogenesis in induced membranes can improve bone regeneration. Here, we showed that the Delta-like ligand 4/ Notch homolog 1 (Dll4/Notch1) pathway was relatively activated in the late stage of induced membrane, especially at the subcutaneous site. Then, DAPT, a classical γ-secretase inhibitor, was applied to specifically inhibit Notch1 activation, followed by up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and CD31 expression. DAPT-modified induced membranes were further confirmed to contribute to bone regeneration after autogenous bone grafting. Finally, in vitro experiments revealed that knocking down Notch1 contributed to the functional improvement of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and that DAPT-treated induced membrane tissue was more favorable for angiogenesis of EPCs compared with the vehicle group. In conclusion, the present findings demonstrate that Dll4/Notch1 signaling is negatively associated with the vessel density of induced membrane. Pharmacological inhibition of Notch1 attenuated the vessel degeneration of induced membrane both in vitro and in vivo, which consequently improved bone formation at the bone defect site and graft resorption at the subcutaneous site.",

Mouse tumor model immersed in appropriate scattering/absorbing medium is used for animal test. Intra-tumor injection of ICG demonstrates the localization of the tumor (5 mm in diameter) submerged 3 cm deep inside the highly scattering medium with 2 mm position error. Results with NIR804-D-Glucosamide on the AR42J tumor bearing nude mouse are also presented with 3 mm localization error.

        "abstract": "One of the greatest obstacles nanoscale drug delivery systems face is the high nonspecific uptake by the reticular endothelial system (RES). Currently, PEGylation is the method of choice to address this problem. Herein we introduce an engineered high density lipoprotein-based nanocarrier (eHDL) as an enhanced cancer-targeted delivery system. eHDLs are high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-like nanoparticles consisting of a tumor ligand-conjugated apoA-I scaffold capable of carrying versatile payloads of cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. Similar to native HDL, eHDLs are biocompatible, precisely controlled ultra small particles (∼10 nm) with RES mitigating properties. In this study, we describe the preparation and characterization of eHDL and confirm that incorporation of exogenous agents do not compromise the structural or functional integrity of the particle. We further demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that eHDL can be efficiently targeted to cancer cells. Proof of the efficacy of this procedure was demonstrated using a proto-type near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent-labeled folate receptor-targeted eHDL. This eHDL displayed exceptional in vivo performance in tumor-bearing mice. High levels of the particles were selectively localized within the targeted tumor while minimal uptake by RES was detected. This study demonstrates that eHDL particles are highly efficient carriers that provide a viable non-PEGylated approach for addressing the non-specific uptake of most nanoparticle-based delivery systems.

        "abstract": "The incidence of differentiated thyroid cancer has increased significantly during the last several decades. Surgical resection is the primary treatment for thyroid cancer and is highly effective, resulting in 5-year survival rates greater than 98%. However, surgical resection can result in short and long-term treatment related morbidities. Additionally, as this malignancy often affects women less than 40 years of age, there is interest in more conservative treatment approaches and, an unmet need for therapeutic options that minimize the risk of surgery related morbidities while simultaneously providing an effective cancer treatment. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has the potential to reduce treatment related side effects by decreasing invasiveness and limiting toxicity. Owing to multiple advantageous properties of the porphyrin-HDL nanoparticle (PLP) as a PDT agent, including preferential accumulation in tumor, biodegradability and unprecedented photosensitizer packing, we evaluate PLP mediated PDT as a minimally invasive, tumor specific treatment for thyroid cancer. On both a biologically-relevant human papillary thyroid cancer (K1) mouse model and an anatomically-relevant rabbit squamous carcinoma (VX2) implanted rabbit thyroid model, the intrinsic fluorescence of PLP enabled tracking of tumor preferential accumulation and guided PDT. This resulted in significant and specific apoptosis in tumor tissue, but not surrounding normal tissues including trachea and recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN). A long-term survival study further demonstrated that PLP-PDT enabled complete ablation of tumor tissue while sparing both the normal thyroid tissue and RLN from damage, thus providing a safe, minimally-invasive, and effective alternative to thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer therapies.",

        "abstract": "Population-based case-control studies are a useful method to test for a genetic association between a trait and a marker. However, the analysis of the resulting data can be affected by population stratification or cryptic relatedness, which may inflate the variance of the usual statistics, resulting in a higher-than-nominal rate of false-positive results. One approach to preserving the nominal type I error is to apply genomic control, which adjusts the variance of the Cochran-Armitage trend test by calculating the statistic on data from null loci. This enables one to estimate any additional variance in the null distribution of statistics. When the underlying genetic model (e.g., recessive, additive, or dominant) is known, genomic control can be applied to the corresponding optimal trend tests. In practice, however, the mode of inheritance is unknown. The genotype-based chi (2) test for a general association between the trait and the marker does not depend on the underlying genetic model. Since this general association test has 2 degrees of freedom (df), the existing formulas for estimating the variance factor by use of genomic control are not directly applicable. By expressing the general association test in terms of two Cochran-Armitage trend tests, one can apply genomic control to each of the two trend tests separately, thereby adjusting the chi (2) statistic. The properties of this robust genomic control test with 2 df are examined by simulation. This genomic control-adjusted 2-df test has control of type I error and achieves reasonable power, relative to the optimal tests for each model.",

Compared with those just considering the effect of excavation, the following conclusions can be drawn. First, the deformation properties of the soil in the excavation base with different horizontal locations under the alternate effect of dewatering and excavation are all significantly improved and the initial unloading modulus is remarkably increased compared with that just considering the effect of excavation. The total heave of the soil in all the horizontal locations is also decreased. However, the dewatering will increase the soil heave in each excavation step compared with that just considering the effect of excavation, as the soil stress relief in each excavation step is significantly increased due to the effect of dewatering. The test results also show that the heave of soil elements close to diaphragm wall under the alternate effect of excavation and dewatering is remarkably larger than that in the center of excavation. The total heave of the soil elements close to diaphragm walls under the alternate effect of excavation and dewatering is even larger than that just considering the effect of excavation. The influences of dewatering inside the pit on the deformation properties and soil heave are closely related to the dewatering time, dewatering depth, the coefficient of permeability of pore water and so on and should be considered in deep pit excavation under the groundwater level.",

        "abstract": "Case-control association studies using unrelated cases and controls may suffer from potential confounding due to population stratification. Bias and variance distortion caused by population stratification in the commonly used allele-based tests can considerably inflate the Type I error rate. It is shown that the bias vanishes in the absence of disease rate heterogeneity. If only population stratification exists, a proper estimate of the variance of the allele-based test statistic is developed. Using this estimated variance yields a valid Type I error. However, when the frequencies of the allele under study and the disease rates differ among the subpopulations, it is difficult to correct for this bias. Explicit expressions for the excess false positive rate (EFPR) of the test due to bias and variance distortion are derived. It turns out that the bias created when both population stratification and disease rate heterogeneity are present usually has a greater effect on the EFPR than variance distortion. Comprehensive simulation studies strongly support these results.",

Potential applications include breast imaging and small animal imaging at low x-ray energies. In vivo experiments will be required to verify that tumor uptake of (rITG)LDL is sufficient for enhanced detection. Use at higher x-ray energies, as used in conventional CT, will require a further increase in iodine loading.",

Methods: Sentinel lymph nodes biopsy was performed on 53 patients with cN0 breast cancer by combination using of 99mTc labeled sulfur colloid and blue dye. 99mTc labeled sulfur colloid was injected subcutaneously or into intraparenchymal tissue around primary tumor, whereas, methylene blue or Kanalin was injected in the diagonal quadrant region (30 cases) or sub-areola (23 cases). Axillary lymph node dissection was performed following sentinel lymph node biopsy. Results: The success rate of sentinel lymph node biopsy was 100% by combination method, and 96.23% by single isotope tracer or by single blue dye. The sentinel lymph nodes were both \"hot\" and blue in 49 patients. Conclusion: The identification of sentinel lymph nodes was independent of injection site of tracer. And it is suggested that sentinel lymph nodes were related to whole breast rather than the site of primary tumor.",

In this first proof-of-concept report, a model photosensitizing beacon was synthesized containing a pyropheophorbide as the PS and a carotenoid as the 1O2 quencher. These were kept in close proximity by the self-folding of a caspase-3-specific peptide sequence. Upon caspase-3-induced cleavage, the 1O2 production increased markedly, as measured directly by 1O2 near-infrared luminescence and lifetime measurements.",

        "abstract": "When measuring units are expensive or time consuming, while ranking them can be done easily, it is known that ranked set sampling (RSS) is preferred to simple random sampling (SRS). Available results for RSS are developed under specific parametric assumptions or are asymptotic in nature, with few results available for finite size samples when the underlying distribution of the observed data is unknown. We investigate the use of resampling techniques to draw inferences on population characteristics. To obtain standard error and confidence interval estimates we discuss and compare three methods of resampling a given ranked set sample. Chen et al. (2004. Ranked Set Sampling: Theory and Applications. Springer, New York) suggest a natural method to obtain bootstrap samples from each row of a RSS. We prove that this method is consistent for a location estimator. We propose two other methods that are designed to obtain more stratified resamples from the given sample. Algorithms are provided for these methods. We recommend a method that obtains a bootstrap RSS from the observations. We prove several properties of this method, including consistency for a location parameter. We define two types of L-estimators for RSS and obtain expressions for their exact moments. We discuss an application to obtain confidence intervals for the Winsorized mean of a RSS.",

        "abstract": "The problem of output control for linear uncertain systems with external perturbations is studied. Instead of the commonly used assuption that the state variable is mesurable, here it is assumed that the output available for measurements is the higher order derivative of the state only (for example, the acceleration for a second order plant), which is also corrupted by noise. Then via series of integration an identification algorithm is proposed for identification of values of all parameters and unknown initial conditions for the state vector. Finally, two control algorithms are developed, adap-tive and robust, providing boundedness of trajectories for the system. Efficiency of the obtained solutions is demonstrated by numerical experiments. 1 Introduction The problem of output control for uncertain linear systems with external perturbations is one of the most important problems in the control theory. A model-based controller design requires an identification process of the uncertain system , for which full state variables need to be either measured or estimated. Usually observers for such systems are designed under assumption that only the outputs are available for measurement but not their derivatives [1]. However, there are cases where measurement of high-order derivatives of the output state can be more convenient than that of output state itself, for example, it is much more easier for an individual to attach an accelerometer to the end-effector of a robot manipulator than to mount a position decoder to the motor rotor inside the robot body. This paper addresses the mentioned problem under assumption that only the higher order derivative of the state is measurable. In the present work, we are mainly motivated by identification , estimation and control in a robot manipulator application , when sensors are installed in the robot motors at the basements of joints, but due to flexibility of joints, the end-point position of the joint does not always coincide with the value given by motor sensor under rigid geometry of the robot. In order to improve accuracy of estimation and control in such a case, an accelerometer can be installed at the",

        "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) following lung-sparing extended pleurectomy for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) has been investigated as a potential means to kill residual microscopic cells. High expression levels of folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) have been reported in MPM; therefore, targeting FOLR1 has been considered a novel potential strategy. The present study developed FOLR1‑targeting porphyrin-lipid nanoparticles (folate-porphysomes, FP) for the treatment of PDT. Furthermore, inhibition of activated epidermal growth factor (EGFR)-associated survival pathways enhance PDT efficacy. In the present study, these approaches were combined; FP-based PDT was used together with an EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). The frequency of FOLR1 and EGFR expression in MPM was analyzed using tissue microarrays. Confocal microscopy and a cell viability assay were performed to confirm the specificity of FOLR1‑targeting cellular uptake and photocytotoxicity in vitro. In vivo fluorescence activation and therapeutic efficacy were subsequently examined. The effects of EGFR-TKI were also assessed in vitro. The in vivo combined antitumor effect of EGFR-TKI and FP-PDT was then evaluated. The results revealed that FOLR1 and EGFR were expressed in 79 and 89% of MPM samples, respectively. In addition, intracellular uptake of FP corresponded well with FOLR1 expression. When MPM cells were incubated with FP and then irradiated at 671 nm, there was significant in vitro cell death, which was inhibited in the presence of free folic acid, thus suggesting the specificity of FPs. FOLR1 targeting resulted in disassembly of the porphysomes and subsequent fluorescence activation in intrathoracic disseminated MPM tumors, as demonstrated by ex vivo tissue imaging. FP-PDT resulted in significant cellular damage and apoptosis in vivo. Furthermore, the combination of pretreatment with EGFR-TKI and FP-PDT induced a marked improvement of treatment responses. In conclusion, FP-based PDT induced selective destruction of MPM cells based on FOLR1 targeting, and pretreatment with EGFR-TKI further enhanced the therapeutic response.",

The mechanical studies show that the functions of earth berm for unsaturated pit include two aspects. The first one is that the necessary embedded depth of the retaining structure can be reduced because of the longer force arm of the horizontal resisting force. And the second one is that the displacement and inner force of the retaining structure can be reduced for its horizontal elastic ssupporting. Analysis on an example illustrates that the construction method using earth berm in pit excavation together with lowering groundwater can decrease the embedded depth, displacement and inner force of retaining structure remarkably. Therefore, the construction method is economical due to sparing horizontal supporting structure as well as reducing project time.",

        "title": "Rationale and study design of the CardioGene Study: genomics of in-stent restenosis.",
        "abstract": "in-stent restenosis is a major limitation of stent therapy for atherosclerosis coronary artery disease. The CardioGene Study is an ongoing study of restenosis in bare mental stents (BMS) for the treatment of coronary artery disease. The overall goal is to understand the genetic determinants of the responses to vascular injury that result in the development of restenosis in some patients but not in others. Gene expression profiling at transcriptional and translational levels provides global assessment of gene activity after vascular injury and mechanistic insight. Furthermore, the delineation of genetic biomarkers would be of value in the clinical setting of risk-stratify patients prior to stent therapy. Prospective risk stratification would allow for the rational selection of specialized treatments against the development of in-stent restenosis (ISR), such as drug-eluting stents.Patients are enrolled at two sites in the US with high-volume cardiac catheterization facilities: the William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, MI, USA, and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, USA.Two complementary study designs are used to understand the molecular mechanisms of restenosis and the genetic biomarkers predictive of restenosis. First, 350 patients are enrolled prospectively at the time of stent implantation. Blood is sampled prior to stent placement and afterwards at 2 weeks and 6 months. The clinical outcome of restenosis is determined 6 and 12 months after stent placement. The primary outcome is clinical restenosis at 6 months. The major secondary outcome is clinical restenosis at 12 months. Second, a corollary case-control analysis will be carried out with the enrollment of an additional 250 cases with a history of recurrent restenosis after treatment with BMS. Controls for this analysis are derived from the prospective cohort.Consecutive patients presenting to the cardiac catheterization laboratory are screened, informed about the study and enrolled after signing the consent form. Enrollment has been completed for the prospective cohort, and enrollment of the additional group is ongoing. A standardized questionnaire is used to collect clinical data primarily through direct patient interview to assess medical history, medication use, functional status, family history, environmental factors, and social history. Further data are abstracted from the medical charts and catheterization reports. A total of 276 clinical variables are collected per individual at baseline, and 49 variables are collected at each of the 6- and 12-month follow-up visits. A Clinical Events Committee adjudicates clinical outcomes. Blood samples are processed at each clinical enrollment site using standardized operating procedures. From each blood sample, several aliquots are prepared and stored of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, granulocytes, platelets, serum, and plasma. Additionally, a portion of each patient's leukocytes is cryopreserved for future cell-line creation. Samples are frozen and shipped to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Additional materials generated in the analysis of the samples at the NHLBI are frozen and stored, including isolated genomic DNA, total RNA, reverse transcribed cDNA libraries and labeled RNA hybridization mixtures used in microarray analysis. Per individual in the prospective cohort, high-quality transcript profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells at each time of blood sampling are obtained using Affymetrix U133A microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Per chip, this yields 495,930 features per individual per time of sampling. This represents expression levels for 22,283 genes per patients oer time of blood sampling, including 14,500 well-characterized human genes. Proteomics of plasma is performed with multidimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Protein expression is examined similarly to mRNA expression as a measure of gene expression. Genotyping is performed in two manners. First, those genes showing differential expression at the levels of mRNA and protein are investigated using a candidate gene approach. Specific variants in known gene regulatory regions, such as promoters, are sought initially, as those variants may explain differences in expression level. Second, a genome-wide scan is used to identify genetic loci that are associated with ISR. Those regions identified are further examined for genes that show differential expression in the mRNA microarray profiling or proteomics investigations. These genes are finely investigated for candidate SNPs and other gene variants. Complementary genomic and proteomic approaches are expected to be robust. Integration of data sets is accomplished using a variety of informatics tools, organization of gene expression into functional pathways, and investigation of physical maps of up- and downregulated sets of genes.The CardioGene Study is designed to understand ISR. Global gene and protein expression profiling define molecular phenotypes of patients. Well-defined clinical phenotypes will be paired with genomic data to define analyses aimed to achieve several goals. These include determining blood gene and protein expression in patients with ISR, investigating the genetic basis of ISR, developing predictive gene and protein biomarkers, and the identification of new targets for treatment.",

        "abstract": "The homeostasis of copper (Cu) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is partially regulated by the Cu transporter-1 (CTR1) and divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1) at the blood-CSF barrier (BCB) in the choroid plexus. Data from human and animal studies suggest an increased Cu concentration in blood, CSF, and brains following in vivo manganese (Mn) exposure. This study was designed to investigate the relative role of CTR1 and DMT1 in Cu transport under normal or Mn-exposed conditions using an immortalized choroidal Z310 cell line. Mn exposure in vitro resulted in an increased cellular 64Cu uptake and the up-regulation of both CTR1 and DMT1. Knocking down CTR1 by siRNA counteracted the Mn-induced increase of 64Cu uptake, while knocking down DMT1 siRNA resulted in an increased cellular 64Cu uptake in Mn-exposed cells. To distinguish the roles of CTR1 and DMT1 in Cu transport, the Z310 cell-based tetracycline (Tet)-inducible CTR1 and DMT1 expression cell lines were developed, namely iZCTR1 and iZDMT1 cells, respectively. In iZCTR1 cells, Tet induction led to a robust increase (25 fold) of 64Cu uptake with the time course corresponding to the increased CTR1. Induction of DMT1 by Tet in iZDMT1 cells, however, resulted in only a slight increase of 64Cu uptake in contrast to a substantial increase in DMT1 mRNA and protein expression. These data indicate that CTR1, but not DMT1, plays an essential role in transporting Cu by the BCB in the choroid plexus. Mn-induced cellular overload of Cu at the BCB is due, primarily, to Mn-induced over-expression of CTR1.",

Utilizing one of the most important cancer signatures, the overexpression of glucose transporters (GLUT), we have developed a series of 2-deoxygiucose conjugated NIR dyes (NIRF-2DGs) to enhance tumor selectivity. This uptake mechanism was confirmed in vitro by confocal microscopy on various cancer cells.

Fluorescence imaging studies demonstrate that Pyro-2DG is selectively accumulated in the tumor. Upon its photoactivation, we demonstrate that this agent efficiently causes selective mitochondrial damage to the region of a tumor that was photoirradiated after administration of this agent, but does not affect tissues photoirradiated in the absence of the agent or tissues treated with the agent that are not photoirradiated. Preliminary confocal microscopy studies suggest that Pyro-2DG is delivered and trapped in tumor cells via the GLUT/hexokinase pathway and therefore is useful both as a tumor-targeted NIR fluorescence imaging probe and as a PDT agent for the destruction of cancer.",

        "abstract": "Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element. It is known to have various functions, such as participating in enzymatic synthesis, and promoting hematopoiesis. On the other hand, it can cause toxic injury upon excess intake. However, toxic effects and its mechanism on glial cells are unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that MnCl(2) can activate microglia, and that this can cause dopaminergic neuronal injury. Investigation of the underlying mechanisms showed that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) was induced and highly expressed following Mn treatment. Moreover, pretreatment with S-methylisothiourea (SMT. iNOS inhibitor), Mn-induced iNOS expression and dopaminergic neuronal injury were partly reverse. Pretreatment with minocycline (microglia activation inhibitor), Mn-induced activation of microglia and dopaminergic neuronal injury was partly reverse. Taken together, our results showed that Mn can cause microglia activation, which can up-regulate the level of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and iNOS, and these inflammatory factors can cause dopaminergic neuronal injury. SMT and minocycline prevent Mn-induced dopaminergic neuronal injury.",

The model can be used to describe strain softening behaviour of sand under monotonic loading\n when the similarity-ratio equals to unity. The characteristics of the model are as follows: 1) A reverse bullet-shaped yield\n surface is adopted to ensure accurate prediction of the behavior of sand, instead of bullet-shaped or elliptical yield surface\n in Cam-Clay model. 2) No unique relationship between void ratio and the mean normal stress for sand prevents the direct coupling\n of yield surface size to void ratio, so incremental deviatoric strain hardening rule is used. 3) The model combines the concept\n of state-dependent dilatancy by incorporating state parameter in Rowe’s stress dilatancy equation, which accounts for the\n dependence of dilatancy on the stress state and the material internal state. A single set of model constants, which is calibrated,\n can simulate stress—strain response under different initial void ratios and different confine pressures. The model is validated\n true by comparing predicted results with experimental results under monotonic and cyclic loading conditions.",

Self-diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution were estimated from measurements of self-diffusion at 25 °C in deuterated chloroform and in the dilute regime using pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Scaling laws were observed but unexpectedly these star polymers showed slightly larger hydrodynamic radii than the linear equivalents. Hydrodynamic radii were calculated for different Perrin or shape factors (i.e. spherical, cylindrical and ellipsoidal), and the equivalent hydrodynamic radii for the cylinders and ellipsoids were compared to those obtained for a spherical shaped molecule. These were also compared to an approximate equivalent hydrodynamic radius estimated using approximate dimensions of the polymers at maximum extension for the cylinder/ellipsoid molecular shapes.

        "abstract": "To study the effect of acute fear stress on emotional behaviors, Hormone levels, and the expression and activation of cerebra Erk1/2 of rats in vivo.Fourty eight male SD rats were divided randomly into control group and stress group. Rats of stress group received 30 min' s acute stress including foot shock and white noise, and then the emotional behaviors were observed. The hormone level in plasm and brain was determined by spectrophotofluorometry and radioimmunoassay kit. In the following experiments, Western blot was performed to determine the expression and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (Erk) of four different regions of the brain.Rats tested after acute fear stress displayed substantial decreases in open-field activity, increases in resistance to capture, and increases in fright reaction (P < 0.01). The stress also resulted in significantly higher plasmic and cerebral noradrenaline, corticosteroid, 5-hydroxytryptamine levels, and lower adrenomedulin level in comparison with the control (P < 0.01) after stress. At the time point of 0 min and 30 min after stress, the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 were increased in all four brain regions examined (hippocampus, striatum, prefrontal cortex and cerebellum).Acute fear stress can induce abnormalities of emotional behaviors, such as behavioral habits, anxiety and defense, startle and delayed adaptation to startle, as well as the alteration of hormone levels. The phosphorylation of Erk1/2 may play a role in the abnormality of emotional behaviors of rats induced by acute fear stress.",

Before the axial strain reaches\n 15%, the axial strain computed from the model is smaller than that from the test under the drained condition. Under the undrained\n condition, after the axial strain reaches 1%, the axial strain increases quickly because of the complete loss of structure\n and stiffness; and the result computed from the model is nearly equal to that from the model without the incorporation of\n the damage function due to less plastic strain under undrained condition test.",

The system by G-APD is systematically tested using suspensions of latex spheres of various diameters.

        "abstract": "We recently introduced the concept of photodynamic molecular beacons (PMB) for selective control of photodynamic therapy (PDT). The PMB consists of a peptide linker that is sequence specific to a cancer-associated protease. A photosensitizer (PS) and a singlet oxygen (1O2) quencher are conjugated to the opposite ends of this linker. Proximity of the PS and quencher can efficiently inhibit 1O2 generation. In the presence of a targeted protease, the substrate sequence is cleaved and the PS and quencher will separate so that the PS can be photo-activated. There are two ways to optimize the PMB selectivity to cancer cells. The first is to increase the protease specificity to targeted cells and the second is to minimize the phototoxicity of intact (uncleaved) PMBs in non-targeted (normal) cells. Carotenoids (CARs) are well known in nature for their role in quenching excited states of PS and in directly scavenging 1O2. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the CAR with dual quenching modes (PS excited states deactivation and 1O2 scavenging) can be used to minimize the photodamage of intact PMBs to non-targeted cells. Thus, we synthesized a beacon (PPC) with a caspase-3 cleavable peptide linking a PS and a CAR quencher. It was confirmed that CAR deactivates the PS excited states and also directly scavenges 1O2. Moreover, the in vitro PDT response showed that CAR completely shuts off the photodynamic effect in non-targeted HepG(2) cells, while PS without CAR (control) remains highly potent even at a much lower (30-fold) dose.",

The approaches adopted to determine the bearing capacity of a single pile in extra-deep foundation still employ conventional pile load tests on ground surface first and then deduct the skin friction along the pile shaft in the range of excavation from the results obtained by the conventional tests, where the effect of deep excavation is not taken into account. Here three different methods of pile load tests are simulated through the axisymmetric finite element model of a pile in homogeneous soil adopting parameters of soil, pile material and soil-pile interface verified by a case history. Through the simulation of deep excavation, its effect on the pile is investigated and on this basis the mechanism of load transfer and the settlement of the pile loaded after deep excavation are studied. Compared with the conventional load tests and load tests with sleeve, the bearing capacity and vertical stiffness of the pile loaded after excavation are reduced. Under the same load the pile experiencing deep excavation has a larger settlement and a larger proportion of pile rigid penetration in settlement than that of piles in the other two tests. Deep excavation also leads to a large pile-soil relative displacement when the skin friction is totally mobilized. In addition, deep excavation can cause considerable tension force in the pile, which means that the reinforcing steel bars in the lower part of the pile should not be reduced at discretion.",

On this basis, the effects and the effectiveness of the soil reinforcement alongside the existing tunnel, a protection hoop formed by the slab and anti-floating piles and the reverse heap-loading on the track deformation of the existing tunnel are analyzed. It is found out that the above protection measures adopted synthetically can timely and effectively control the uplift of the track in the existing tunnel and ensure the safe operation of metro. Furthermore, the effect law of the different reinforcement parameters on the track deformation of the existing tunnel are studied. The results show that the increase in the different reinforcement parameters can reduce the up lift of the track in the tunnel and the different deformations between the two adjacent boxes of deformation joint, but the reinforcement effect decreases with increase of the parameters; and there exists a reasonable scope of the reinforcement. The results can provide evidence for the optimization of the construction design.",

        "abstract": "Dietary fiber was extracted from fresh residue of soybean milk,and then subjected to high-pressure heating,and the changes of composition and physicochemical property of dietary fiber after the treatment were investigated. The original and the high-pressure heated dietary fibers were subjected to in vitro fermentation and animal test,and the formation of short chain fatty acids were analyzed.Results:After high-pressure heated for 30 min,the fraction of soluble dietary fiber increase by 69.4%,water-holding capacity and water-binding capacity decrease, and swelling capacity changes little.Compared with mice fed untreated soybean residue,the contents of propionic and butyric acids of the mice faces are increased significantly by feeding high-pressure heated dietary fiber.Furthermore, the in vitro fermentation shows that the high-pressure heating accelerates the generation of acetic and propionic acids,but not effective for generation of butyric acid.The difference of short chain fatty acids reflects the difference of microbial flora between in vivo and in vitro.",

Usually, the true model is unknown, but knowledge from previous genome-wide association studies for the disease under investigation is available and provides information about the underlying model. We study how to incorporate this prior information about plausible genetic models to achieve better efficiency robustness in genetic association studies. Two procedures are proposed and studied. The first one reduces the set of genetic models using the prior information. The second one derives posterior probabilities for the plausible genetic models using trend tests. Then the trend test based on the posterior mean of the genetic model or a weighted trend test over various genetic models can be employed, similar in spirit to the efficiency robustness approach. In the proposed procedures, the strong Hardy–Weinberg disequilibrium in cases is studied. Simulations are conducted to compare the proposed methods with existing ones. The usefulness of the results for the analysis of data collected in replication studies is investigated, the proposed methods are shown to have better overall performance than existing one, and the methods are applied to analyze the real data.",

Rats in stress group were stressed everyday by one of the seven stressors including cold exposure, foot shock, white noise, restraint, tail hung up, sleep deprivation, and level shake, and then the ability of learning and memory was determined by Morris water maze test. Serum corticosterone (CORT) level was determined by radioimmunoassay kit. Western blot was performed to determine the expression and phosphorylation of ERK in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of the brain.The escape latencies of stressed rats were substantially longer than those of the controls in the water maze test (P < 0.01) except a transient recovery at the end of the third week after the stress. The stress also resulted in significantly higher serum CORT level and decreased P-ERK level in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) (P < 0.01). Similarly, transient elevation of both CORT and P-ERK levels were observed at the end of the third week.Chronic multiple stress can lead to impaired learning and memory by decreasing the phosphorylation of ERK in the hippocampus and PFC. The partial recovery of learning and memory, CORT and P-ERK levels at the end of the third week may due to the adaptation of the rats to stressors.",

To overcome these limitations, this paper presents an Eulerian FE model, developed to evaluate the stability of circular tunnels in undrained clay. An application example was first presented in detail to illustrate both the approaches and principles for the simulation. Then parametric analyses of tunnel stability using the Eulerian FE method were performed to verify the validity of the developed model. The computed limit support pressures showed good agreements with the solutions from the finite element limit analysis, demonstrating that it is applicable in the stability analysis of a circular tunnel. Meanwhile, Lagrangian FE analysis was also performed for a comparison of performance with the developed Eulerian FE model. The computed results by Lagrangian FE models were shown significantly overestimating the stability of the circular tunnels, which was found to be caused by the decrease of tunnel diameter during the analysis. The Eulerian FE method developed in this paper can inherently avoid this problem, highlighting its advantage in the stability analysis of circular tunnels.",

In practice, however, genetic models for many complex diseases are usually unknown. Using a single test statistic optimal for one genetic model may lose substantial power when the model is mis-specified. When a family of genetic models is scientifically plausible, the maximum of several tests, each optimal for a specific genetic model, is robust against the model mis-specification. This robust test is preferred over a single optimal test. Recently, cost-effective group sequential approaches have been introduced to genetic studies. The group sequential approach allows interim analyses and has been applied to many test statistics, but not to the maximum statistic. When the group sequential method is applied, type I error should be controlled. We propose and compare several approaches of controlling type I error rates when group sequential analysis is conducted with the maximum test for family-based candidate-gene association studies. For a two-stage group sequential robust procedure with a single interim analysis, two critical values for the maximum tests are provided based on a given alpha spending function to control the desired overall type I error.",

The tumors were imaged using the 3D low temperature scanner to produce images throughout several sliced sections of each tumor. The fluorescence signal of the pyropheophorbide was detected at 720nm when excited at 670nm in the tumor tissue. The uniform distribution of the signal in the HepG2 tumor shows extravasation of the beacon from the blood vessels.

Surgical resection is the standard of care, but accurate delineation of the tumor boundaries is challenging, resulting in either under-resection with risk of local recurrence or over-resection with increased functional loss and negative impact on quality of life. This study evaluates, in two pre-clinical in vivo tumor models, the potential of fluorescence-guided resection using molecular beacons activated by metalloproteinases, which are frequently upregulated in human oral cancer. In both models there was rapid (<15 min) beacon activation upon local application, allowing clear fluoresecence imaging in vivo and confirmed by ex vivo fluorescence microscopy and HPLC, with minimal activation in normal oral tissues. Although the tissue penetration was limited using topical application, these findings support further development of this approach towards translation to first-in-human trials.",

        "abstract": "Many epidemiological studies and in vitro experiments have found that chronic arsenic exposure may influence memory formation. The goal of this study was to create an animal model of memory impairment induced by chronic arsenite exposure and to study the underlying mechanisms. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rats were randomly divided into a control group, a low-dose sodium arsenite exposure group and a high-dose sodium arsenite exposure group. Sodium arsenite was administered by adding it to drinking water for 3 months. Then, the spatial memory of the rats was examined with Morris water maze and Y maze. The concentration of arsenic in the blood and the brain was determined by an atomic fluorescence absorption spectrometer. The ultra-structure of hippocampal neurons was observed by an electron microscope. Timm staining was used for observing mossy fibers. We found that the concentration of arsenic in the blood and the brain increased in a dose-response manner (P<0.05). The performance of rats in the arsenite exposed group (15 mg/kg) was significantly impaired in the Morris water maze and Y maze tasks than those in the control group (P<0.05). Sodium arsenite exposure resulted in abnormal structural changes in the myelin sheaths of nerve fibers and decreases in the terminals of mossy fibers. Together, chronic sodium arsenite exposure through drinking water results in detrimental changes in the neuronal synapses, which may contribute to the arsenite-induced impairment of spatial memory.",

        "abstract": "Despite the significant advancement achieved in understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for cancer transformation and aberrant proliferation, leading to novel targeted cancer therapies, significant effort is still needed to \"personalize\" cancer treatment. Molecular imaging is an emerging field that has shown the ability to characterize in vivo the molecular pathways present at the cancer cell level, enabling diagnosis and personalized treatment of malignancies. These technologies, particularly SPECT and PET also permit the development of novel radiotheranostic probes, which provide capabilities for diagnosis and treatment with the same agent. The small therapeutic index of most anticancer agents is a limitation in the drug development process. Incorporation of molecular imaging in clinical research may help in overcoming this limitation and favouring selection of patient populations most likely to achieve benefit from targeted therapy. This review will focus on two of the most advanced theranostic approaches with promising potential for application in the clinic: 1) therapeutic monoclonal antibodies which may be linked to a radionuclide for SPECT or PET imaging to guide cancer diagnosis, staging, molecular characterization, and assessment of the response to treatment and 2) multifunctional nanotechnology that allows image guided drug delivery through encapsulation of multiple therapeutic, targeting and imaging agents into a single nanoparticle. Porphysome, a liposome-like nanoparticle, is an example of a novel and promising application of nanotechnology for cancer diagnosis and treatment. These technologies have proven to be effective in preclinical models, warranting further clinical investigation to advance their application for the benefit of cancer patients.",

Current biomimetics for medical applications use a single biomimetic approach to imitate natural structures, which can be insufficient for reconstructing structurally complex natural systems. Multi-pronged efforts may resolve these complexities. To achieve interesting nanostructure-driven optical properties, we engineered a dual-biomimetic system contained within a single nanoagent to recapitulate the efficient light-harvesting organelles, chlorosomes, which have unique dye assemblies and tunable photonic properties. We synthesized a series of chlorin dyes and stabilized these hydrophobic assemblies inside high-density lipoprotein, a second biomimetic that also enabled in vivo utility. This system resulted in tunable tumor imaging of intact (photoacoustic) and disrupted (activatable fluorescence) nanostructures. The successful demonstration of this multi-pronged biomimetic approach opens the door for reconstruction of complex natural systems for biomedical applications.",

All methods to correct for hidden PS have been focused on classical hypothesis testing, and cannot be directly applied to Bayesian analysis. In this paper, to study the impact and the correction of hidden PS on Bayes factor (BF), we use a simple approximation of BF in terms of the maximum likelihood estimates of the odds ratio (OR) and its asymptotic variance. One advantage is that the commonly used principal components analysis method with a large panel of null markers scanned from existing genome-wide association studies can be directly employed to correct for hidden PS in estimating the OR and its asymptotic variance, through which a correction to BF for hidden PS can be achieved. Using simulations, we examine the impact of ignoring hidden PS on BF and show that the proposed method yields an appropriate correction in Bayesian analysis.",

        "abstract": "Extensive research has investigated the bearing capacity of footings placed on leveled ground improved by deep mixed (DM) columns. However, few studies have focused on the effects of the embedment on the bearing capacity of footings on ground reinforced with DM columns. In geotechnical engineering practice underestimation of the limit load has occurred in China because of the increased use of conventional design methods for reinforced ground with embedment. In this investigation, a numerical model using a rigorous limit analysis tool, known as discontinuity layout optimization (DLO), is established. An equivalent area model is employed with an appropriate stress concentration ratio. Subsequently, a set of design charts of bearing capacity coefficients is produced with a special focus on the bearing capacity coefficient Nq and the failure mechanism. The results show that three failure patterns exist in the composite ground reinforced by DM columns. For cases without embedment, the bearing capacity coefficient Nc increases with the area replacement ratio to a certain value due to the occurrence of general shear failure mechanism. The bearing capacity coefficient Nγ decreases with the area replacement ratio, as the equivalent frictional strength of the reinforced region is reduced. When the embedment is considered, the failure mechanism of composite foundation has a significant influence on the coefficient Nq. Specifically, increase of column length leads to a larger value of Nq when block failure is observed. When a general shear failure pattern occurs, the effect of additional column lengths on the coefficient Nq can be neglected.",

        "abstract": "Incorporating a biomimetic coating and integrating osteoinductive biomolecules into basic bone substitutes are two common strategies to improve osteogenic capabilities in bone tissue engineering. Currently, the underlying mechanism of osteoporosis (OP)-related deficiency of osteogenesis remains unclear, and few treatments target at OP-related bone regeneration. Herein, we describe a self-assembling polyelectrolyte multilayered (PEM) film coating with local immobilisation of calcitriol (Cal) in biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) scaffolds to promote osteoporotic bone regeneration by targeting the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR). : The ovariectomy-induced functional changes in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), protective effects of Cal, and the potential mechanism were all verified. A PEM film composed of hyaluronic acid (HA) and chitosan (Chi) was prepared through layer-by-layer self-assembly. The morphology, growth behaviour, and drug retention capability of the composite scaffolds were characterised, and their biocompatibility and therapeutic efficacy for bone regeneration were systematically explored  and  : The osteogenic differentiation, adhesion, and proliferation abilities of ovariectomised rat BMSCs (OVX-rBMSCs) decreased, in accordance with the deficiency of CaSR. Cal effectively activated osteogenesis in these OVX-rBMSCs by binding specifically to the active pocket of the CaSR structure, while the biomimetic PEM coating augmented OVX-rBMSCs proliferation and adhesion due to its porous surface structure. The PEM-coated scaffolds showed advantages in Cal loading and retention, especially at lower drug concentrations. HA/Chi PEM synergised with Cal to improve the proliferation, adhesion, and osteogenesis of OVX-rBMSCs and promote bone regeneration and BCP degradation in the critical-size calvarial bone defect model of OVX rats. : A composite scaffold based on BCP, created by simply combining a biomimetic PEM coating and Cal immobilisation, could be clinically useful and has marked advantages as a targeted, off-the-shelf, cell-free treatment option for osteoporotic bone regeneration.",

        "abstract": "Targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) combined with image-guided surgical resection is a promising strategy for precision cancer treatment. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an attractive target due to its pronounced overexpression in a variety of tumours, most notably in prostate cancer. Recently, we reported a pyropheophorbide-based PSMA-targeted agent, which exhibited long plasma circulation time and effective tumor accumulation. To further advance PSMA-targeted photodynamic therapy by harvesting tissue-penetrating properties of the NIR light, we developed a bacteriochlorophyll-based PSMA-targeted photosensitizer (BPP), consisting of three building blocks: 1) a PSMA-affinity ligand, 2) a peptide linker to prolong plasma circulation time, and 3) a bacteriochlorophyll photosensitizer for NIR fluorescence imaging and photodynamic therapy (Qy absorption maximum at 750 nm). BPP exhibited excellent PSMA targeting selectivity in both subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse models. The nine D-peptide linker in BPP structure prolonged its plasma circulation time (12.65 hours). Favorable pharmacokinetic properties combined with excellent targeting selectivity enabled effective BPP tumor accumulation, which led to effective PDT in a subcutaneous prostate adenocarcinoma mouse model. Overall, bright NIR fluorescence of BPP enables effective image guidance for surgical resection, while the combination of its targeting capabilities and PDT activity allows for potent and precise image-guided photodynamic treatment of PSMA-expressing tumors.",

        "abstract": "It was a common practice to determine the vertical bearing capacity and lateral bearing capacity separately in the design of pile foundations without consideration of the interaction between the vertical load and the lateral load. It would certainly not reflect the real conditions. Piles with the length of 80 m or even longer were usually adopted in the foundations of super-high building in the soft soil area. At present, there were few documents about the interaction between the vertical load and the lateral load for the unusually long piles. Based on modeling the vertical and lateral load-test results of a pile with the length of 79 m, the necessary characteristics of soil for FEM analysis were obtained, and then the bearing capacity and deformation of extra-long piles under the vertical and lateral loads were studied. For piles under the vertical and lateral roads, effects of the vertical loads on the lateral bearing capacity and the deformation varied with the loading sequence of the vertical and lateral loads, the load level and the strength of soil. As far as the piles and loading condition being concerned, there was a critical vertical load under which the lateral deformation was reduced mostly at high loading level when the vertical load was applied before the lateral one. The weaker the soil, the greater the effect of the vertical load on the lateral displacement at the pile top. The vertical load did not help to reduce the lateral displacement at the pile top anymore when it was applied after the lateral load. The effect of loading sequence of the vertical load and lateral loads on the lateral bearing capacity was larger than that on the vertical one.",

METHODS: Adult male SD rats were placed in the refrigerator(6 h for 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 d, respectively) and the exposure temperature was(-15±1)℃. The impairment of liver was observed by HE staining(hematoxylin and eosin stain) and the expression and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase(JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase(ERK) were determined by Western blot. RESULTS: Cold stress induced significant pathological impairment of the rat liver. Although partially recovered at 7 d, the impairment aggravated again thereafter. Western blot showed that the level of phosphorylated JNK increased after the cold exposure and the increase was significantly correlated to the impairment of the rat liver. But no significant changes were observed in the expression and activation of ERK. CONCLUSION: Cold stress leads to impairment of the rat liver and the increased phosphorylation of JNK may contribute to the cold-induced liver impairment.",

Methods A total of 148 suspective patients(aged 30 ～ 81 years,male 103,female 45) were performed coronary artery angiography and then divided into coronary heart disease group(CHD group,n = 102) and non- coronary heart disease group(control group,n = 46). According to the intensity of coronary artery disorder,CHD group was subdivided into 3 subgroups:single branch lesion,2 branch lesions and 3 branch lesions. The levels of hs-CRP and serum uric acid,glucose and cholesterol were measured and the blood pressure,history of cigarette smoking,hypertension and diabetes were recorded in each group. Results ①The level of hs-CRP in CHD group was markedly higher than that in NCHD group(P < 0.05);②The levels of hs-CRP in 2 branch and 3 branch lesions subgroup were markedly higher than that in single branch subgroup(P < 0.05).Conclusion Serum hs-CRP is not only a strong independent risk factor of CHD,but also a sensitive index of coronary artery angiographic lesion intensity.",

        "abstract": "A novel class of all-organic nanoscale porphyrin nanodroplet agents is presented which is suitable for multimodality ultrasound and photoacoustic molecular imaging. Previous multimodality photoacoustic-ultrasound agents are either not organic, or not yet demonstrated to exhibit enhanced accumulation in leaky tumor vasculature, perhaps because of large diameters. In the current study, porphyrin nanodroplets are created with a mean diameter of 185 nm which is small enough to exhibit the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Porphyrin within the nanodroplet shell has strong optical absorption at 705 nm with an estimated molar extinction coefficient >5 × 10(9) m(-1) cm(-1) , allowing both ultrasound and photoacoustic contrast in the same nanoparticle using all organic materials. The potential of nanodroplets is that they may be phase-changed into microbubbles using high pressure ultrasound, providing ultrasound contrast with single-bubble sensitivity. Multispectral photoacoustic imaging allows visualization of nanodroplets when injected intratumorally in an HT1080 tumor in the chorioallantoic membrane of a chicken embryo. Intravital microscopy imaging of Hep3-GFP and HT1080-GFP tumors in chicken embryos determines that nanodroplets accumulated throughout or at the periphery of tumors, suggesting that porphyrin nanodroplets may be useful for enhancing the visualization of tumors with ultrasound and/or photoacoustic imaging.",

        "abstract": "SnSe2 is a wide band gap semiconductor (Eg = 1.05 eV) with a typical two-dimensional hexagonal crystal structure of the prototype CdI2 phase, resulting in an intrinsically low thermal conductivity, which is favorable for thermoelectrics. Herein, we reported the remarkable role of Cl doping in SnSe2/SnSe nanocomposites. Doping with Cl in the system not only increased the carrier concentration by an order of magnitude but it also modified the heterojunction from that of the Schottky junction type (p-n junction) in undoped samples to junctions having an Ohmic contact (n-n junction) when the samples were doped with Cl, increasing their carrier mobility in the process. On account of the simultaneously boosted carrier concentration and carrier mobility upon Cl doping, the electrical conductivity and the power factor were greatly increased. Moreover, the enhanced point defect phonon scattering induced by Cl doping, coupled with the interface phonon scattering, resulted in a suppression of the thermal conductivity. As a consequence, the maximum ZT value of 0.56 at 773 K was achieved in the 6% Cl-doped SnSe2/SnSe nanocomposite measured in the direction parallel to the pressing direction. This is an almost 6 times larger value than measured on the undoped composite. In addition, unlike the conventional layered compounds (Bi2Te3, SnSe), the ZT value parallel to the pressing direction is much higher than the one measured perpendicular to the pressing direction. This study provides a new way for optimizing the thermoelectric properties of materials through interface regulation.",

It is known that population stratification (PS) often affects population-based association studies. However, how it would affect the inverted regression for pleiotropic association, especially with the mixed types of traits (binary and quantitative), is not examined and the performance of existing methods to correct for PS using the inverted regression analysis is unknown. In this paper, we focus on the methods based on genomic control and principal component analysis, and investigate type I error of pleiotropic association using the inverted regression model in the presence of PS with allele frequencies and the distributions (or disease prevalences) of multiple traits varying across the subpopulations. We focus on common alleles but simulation results for a rare variant are also reported. An application to the HapMap data is used for illustration.",

        "abstract": "Chronic stress is considered to be a major risk factor in the development of psychopathological syndromes in humans. Cognitive impairments and long-term potentiation (LTP) impairments are increasingly recognized as major components of depression, anxiety disorders and other stress-related chronic psychological illnesses. It seems timely to systematically study the potentially underlying neurobiological mechanisms of altered cognitive and synaptic plasticity in the course of chronic stress. In the present study, a rat model of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) induced a cognitive impairment in spatial memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) test and a hippocampal LTP impairment. CUS also induced hippocampal microglial activation and attenuated phosphorylation of glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1 or GluA1). Moreover, chronic treatment with the selective microglial activation blocker, minocycline (120 mg/kg per day), beginning 3 d before CUS treatment and continuing through the behavioral testing period, prevented the CUS-induced impairments of spatial memory and LTP induction. Additional studies showed that minocycline-induced inhibition of microglia activation was associated with increased phosphorylation of GluR1. These results suggest that hippocampal microglial activation modulates the level of GluR1 phosphorylation and might play a causal role in CUS-induced cognitive and LTP disturbances.",

The trend test is another one which assumes a dose-response model between the risk of the disease and genotypes. To apply the trend test, a set of ordered scores is assigned a priori based on the underlying genetic model. Pearson's test is model-free and robust, but is less powerful for common genetic models. MAX is another robust test statistic, which takes the maximum of the trend tests over a family of scientifically plausible genetic models. We show that the three test statistics are all trend tests but with different types of scores; whether the scores are prespecified or data-driven, or whether the scores are ordered (restricted) or not ordered (unrestricted). We then provide insights into power performance of the three tests when the underlying genetic model is unknown and discuss which test to use for the analyses of case-control genetic association studies.",

        "abstract": "The electro-magnetic mechanism and chemical transfer mechanism coexist in the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) procedure. However, the latter is regretfully neglected due to the poor chemical transfer efficiency without the aid of a direct chemical bond. Herein, to further explore the CM Raman enhancement and understand the mechanism of SERS, Raman testing and the adsorption experiment have been carried out with respect to the exploration and application of metal-free SERS substrate. Thus, functional organic group-modified MoS2 nanosheets have been prepared via the hydrothermal method, and this as-prepared MoS2 shows an apparent Raman signal enhancement effect when serving/as the Raman substrate. Compared with those without organic groups (purchased MoS2) and those with one organic group removed (annealed MoS2), it is found that the minimum detection concentration of Rhodamine B (RhB) with the as-prepared functional MoS2 nanosheets could be 0.1 ppm, while the detection limit of annealed as-prepared MoS2 nanosheets and commercially purchased MoS2 powders were only 1 ppm and 10 ppm, respectively. Fourier transition infrared spectroscopy has revealed that the surface of the as-prepared MoS2 nanosheets was passivated by –NH2 and CC and CO groups. The lone pair electrons in –NH2 and the p-bond electrons in CC and CO groups would coordinate the nitrogen ethyl of RhB, forming a direct chemical bond, which could significantly contribute to the charge transfer. This led to efficient adsorption of the RhB molecule, which is key to achieving the SERS effect with the prepared MoS2 nanosheets substrate.",

        "abstract": "Melatonin is reportedly associated with intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). Endplate cartilage is vitally important to intervertebral discs in physiological and pathological conditions. However, the effects and mechanism of melatonin on endplate chondrocytes (EPCs) are still unclear. Herein, we studied the effects of melatonin on EPC apoptosis and calcification and elucidated the underlying mechanism. Our study revealed that melatonin treatment decreases the incidence of apoptosis and inhibits EPC calcification in a dose-dependent manner. We also found that melatonin upregulates Sirt1 expression and activity and promotes autophagy in EPCs. Autophagy inhibition by 3-methyladenine reversed the protective effect of melatonin on apoptosis and calcification, while the Sirt1 inhibitor EX-527 suppressed melatonin-induced autophagy and the protective effects of melatonin against apoptosis and calcification, indicating that the beneficial effects of melatonin in EPCs are mediated through the Sirt1-autophagy pathway. Furthermore, melatonin may ameliorate IDD in vivo in rats. Collectively, this study revealed that melatonin reduces EPC apoptosis and calcification and that the underlying mechanism may be related to Sirt1-autophagy pathway regulation, which may help us better understand the association between melatonin and IDD.",

We examined various test statistics that can be utilized in testing disease association and also reviewed several multiple testing procedures that can properly control the family-wise error rates when the univariate approach is applied to multiple markers. The set association methods were then briefly reviewed. Finally, we applied these methods to the data from Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA).",

        "abstract": "Centrifuge tests are carried out to study the embankment supported on the rigid pile composite ground. For all the test models, the upper layer of the ground is soft clay and the lower layer is stiff sand. The cases of using single-row piles and group piles are considered. The deformation behavior, load transfer and failure mechanisms of the piles and embankment are investigated with different pile bending stiffnesses and strengths, piles locations, pile spacings and embedded depth of pile toe into stiff stratum. The centrifuge tests show that in all the cases, the maximum bending moment of piles is located near the interface of soft and stiff strata. For the embankment on group piles, the closer to the embankment center the pile is, the smaller the bending moment is. When the piles have a high bending stiffness and strength, a large spacing, and a sufficient embedded depth into stiff stratum, soil may flow around the piles, which will lead to the overall failure of embankment. In contrast, for the single-row piles with a low bending stiffness and strength, the piles will fail firstly by bending failure mode at the interface of the soft and stiff strata, and then the secondary bending failure may occur at the upper part of the pile before the embankment failure. For the group piles with a low bending stiffness and strength, some piles near the embankment toe would also fail firstly by bending failure mode at the interface of the soft and stiff strata. Besides, the tensile failure may break the pile into two parts. In the final stage, the collapse failure or the secondary bending failure of the pile upper part will lead to the overall failure of embankment. According to the failure mechanisms of embankment, the embankment stability may be enhanced by the measures of increasing pile bending strength, decreasing pile spacing or increasing the embedded depth of pile toe into stiff stratum.",

The physical and chemical properties of UHP-treated and non-UHP-treated dietary fiber were measured. Little effect of UHP treatment was observed on the chemical structure of sweet potato dietary fiber, while the proportion of fiber type was changed: the content of water soluble fiber was reduced while that of insoluble fiber was changed reversely. Higher glucose absorption and sodium cholate binding capacities were found in UHP-treated fiber in comparison with non-UHP-treated fiber, especially in 500 MPa-treated fiber. Therefore, the conclusion was made that the glucose concentration in blood of animals or humans can be controlled at a relatively low level by the intake of UHP-treated sweet potato fiber which is able to inhibit the rapid rise in postprandial blood glucose level.",

        "abstract": "Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is one of the major causes of low back pain. Polydatin (PD) has been shown to exert multiple pharmacological effects on different diseases; here, we test the therapeutic potential of PD for IVDD. In in-vitro experiments, we confirmed PD is nontoxic to nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) under the concentration of 400 μmol/L. Furthermore, PD was able to decrease the level of senescence in TNF-α-treated NPCs, as indicated by β-gal staining as well as senescence markers p53 and p16 expression. In the aspect of extracellular matrix (ECM), PD not only reduced metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3), metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) and a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase thrombospondin type 1 motif 4 (ADAMTS-4) expression, but also increased aggrecan and collagen II levels. Mitochondrion is closely related to cellular senescence and ECM homeostasis; mechanistically, we found PD may rescue TNF-α-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, and it may also promote Nrf2 expression and activity. Silencing Nrf2 partly abolished the protective effects of PD on mitochondrial homeostasis, senescence and ECM homeostasis in TNF-α-treated NPCs. Correspondingly, PD ameliorated IVDD in rat model by promoting Nrf2 activity, preserving ECM and inhibiting senescence in nucleus pulposus cells. To sum up, our study suggests that PD exerts protective effects in NPCs against IVDD and reveals the underlying mechanism of PD on Nrf2 activation in NPCs.",

Although the degree of inclination of the inclined pile due to excavation was small(the degree of inclination of 0.15%),the settlement of the inclined pile was larger than that of the plumb pile under the same vertical load.Little increment in the degree of inclination(form 0.07%to 0.15%) would cause a large increment in the lateral displacement at the pile top under the same vertical load.Distributions of side resistances of the inclined piles due to excavation were quite different from those of piles in the two cases mentioned above.Large initial moment may be caused by the pit excavation,which is unfavorable to the vertical bearing capacity of inclined piles.As a result,when deciding the vertical bearing capacity of inclined piles,reasons that cause piles to incline need to be considered so as to make the right assessment.",

In particular, there has been a surge in the fabrication of multimodality US contrast agents and theranostic US agents for cancer imaging and therapy. The unique interaction of US waves with microscale and nanoscale agents has attracted much attention in the development of contrast agents and drug-delivery vehicles. The dimensions of the agent not only dictate how it behaves in vivo, but also how it interacts with US for imaging and drug delivery. Furthermore, these agents are also unique due to their ability to convert from the nanoscale to the microscale and vice versa, having imaging and therapeutic utility in both dimensions. Here, we review multimodality and multifunctional US-based agents, according to their size, and also highlight recent developments in size conversion US agents.

The novel bacteriochlorins, obtained from chlorophyll-a, have long-wavelength absorptions in the range lambda max = 734-758 nm. Preferential migration of ethyl over methyl substituents among ketobacteriochlorins obtained in the pinacol-pinacolone rearrangements of vic-dihydroxybacteriochlorins was confirmed by NOE studies. The bacteriochlorins show relatively low fluorescence quantum yields. Among all the bacteriochlorins the triplet states were quenched by ground state molecular oxygen in a relatively similar manner, yielding comparable singlet oxygen quantum yields. In preliminary in vivo studies (DBA/2 mice, transplanted with SMT/F tumors), ketobacteriochlorins were found to be more photodynamically active than the related vic-dihydroxy analogues. Replacement of the methyl ester functionalities with di-tert-butylaspartic acids enhanced the in vivo efficacy. Site specific human serum albumin (HSA) binding studies indicated a direct correlation between the ability of the compound to bind to the diazepam binding site (albumin site II) and the in vivo photosensitizing efficacy.",

A multi-path routing scheme integrated with network coding was proposed to solve this problem. It is proved that with the same multi-path number and path message loss rate, the scheme outperforms the traditional multi-path routing in terms of message delivery rate. Moreover, the performances of both schemes were evaluated by the extended ns-2 software in terms of message delivery rate under the conditions of different multi-path numbers, link message loss rates and redundancy factors. The result validates the theory analysis and shows that the scheme can efficiently improve the reliability and save the onboard communication resources as well as enhance the error control of multi-path routing with certain ranges of message loss.",

        "abstract": "The Cochran-Armitage trend test is commonly used as a genotype-based test for candidate gene association. Corresponding to each underlying genetic model there is a particular set of scores assigned to the genotypes that maximizes its power. When the variance of the test statistic is known, the formulas for approximate power and associated sample size are readily obtained. In practice, however, the variance of the test statistic needs to be estimated. We present formulas for the required sample size to achieve a prespecified power that account for the need to estimate the variance of the test statistic. When the underlying genetic model is unknown one can incur a substantial loss of power when a test suitable for one mode of inheritance is used where another mode is the true one. Thus, tests having good power properties relative to the optimal tests for each model are useful. These tests are called efficiency robust and we study two of them: the maximin efficiency robust test is a linear combination of the standardized optimal tests that has high efficiency and the MAX test, the maximum of the standardized optimal tests. Simulation results of the robustness of these two tests indicate that the more computationally involved MAX test is preferable.",

Systemically-administered porphysomes accumulated in lung tumors with significantly enhanced disease-to-normal tissue contrast, as confirmed in three subtypes of orthotopic human lung cancer xenografts (A549, H460 and H520) in mice and in an orthotopic VX2 tumor in rabbits. An in-house prototype fluorescence bronchoscope demonstrated the capability of porphysomes for in vivo imaging of lung tumors in the mucosal/submucosal layers, providing real-time fluorescence guidance for transbronchial PTT. Porphysomes also enhanced the efficacy of transbronchial PTT significantly and resulted in selective and efficient tumor tissue ablation in the rabbit model. A clinically used cylindrical diffuser fiber successfully achieved tumor-specific thermal ablation, showing promising evidence for the clinical translation of this novel platform to impact upon non-surgical treatment of early-stage peripheral lung cancer.",

In contrast to many observers, which normally estimate the system state in an asymptotic fashion, this observer estimates the exact system state in predetermined finite time.

This method regards the light intensity fluctuation of DLS as a stationary random process. According to autocorrelation function (ACF) of DLS signal, the stationary random process of DLS can be generated by auto-regressive (AR) model. Signal simulations of several kinds of distribution particles and comparison of simulations and experiment prove that AR model can be used for DLS signal simulation. Moreover, by analyzing effect of simulation parameters on simulation precision, we obtained the relationship between simulation parameters and simulation precision.

        "abstract": "Following cellular delivery, most drugs must escape endosomes and lysosomes and reach the cytosol to be effective. This is particularly significant for nanoparticles, which can carry a large drug payload, but typically accumulate in endosomes and lysosomes. One attractive solution is to use light-triggered release, which can provide efficient endolysosomal membrane disruption and spatiotemporal control of cytosolic release. Here, we demonstrate the cytosolic release of cargo loaded into low density lipoprotein (LDL) nanoparticles using a photochemical internalization (PCI) approach. Three types of cargo-loaded LDL nanoparticles (CLLNPs) were generated by loading fluorescent dyes via (1) intercalation in the phospholipid monolayer exterior (surface loading), (2) conjugation to the amino acids of apoB-100 protein (protein loading) or (3) reconstitution into the hydrophobic core of LDL (core loading). Fluorescence imaging demonstrated the cellular uptake of CLLNPs was mediated by the LDL receptor and resulted in CLLNPs accumulation in endosomes. When cells were co-incubated with CLLNPs and AlPcS2a (a PCI agent), laser irradiation induced efficient cytosolic release of the surface-loaded and protein-labeled cargo, whereas the core-loaded hydrophobic dye could not readily be released. Thus, PCI is a useful cytosolic release method for CLLNPs, although the loading method must be considered.",

The theory of the method was presented. The simulated results and experimental examples were shown. This method is useful to slice in-line digital holograms to display only in-focus particles at a focused plane.

        "abstract": "The metastatic spread of cancer from the primary site or organ is one of its most devastating aspects, being responsible for up to 90% of cancer-associated mortality. Bone is one of the common sites of metastatic spread, including the vertebrae. Regardless of the treatment strategy, the clinical goals for patients with vertebral metastases are to improve the quality of life by preventing neurologic decline, to achieve durable pain relief and enhance local tumor control. However, in part due to the close proximity of the spinal cord, current treatment options are limited. We propose a novel therapeutic strategy with the use of photodynamic molecular beacons (PMBs) for targeted destruction of spinal metastases, particularly to de-bulk lesions as an adjuvant to vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty in order to mechanically stabilize weak or fractured vertebrae. The PDT efficacy of a matrix metalloproteinase-specific PMB is reported in a metstatic model that recapitulates the clinical features of tumor growth within the bone. We demonstrate that not only does tumor cell destruction occur but also the killing of bone stromal cells. The potential of PMB-PDT to destroy metastatic tumors, disrupt the osteolytic cycle and better preserve critical organs with an increased therapeutic window compared with conventional photosensitizers is demonstrated.",

A genetic model is defined in terms of two genetic risk measures: genotype relative risk and odds ratio. The impacts of choosing a risk measure on the resulting genetic models are studied in the power to detect association and deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in cases using genetic relative risk. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the power of a study to detect associations using odds ratio is lower than that using relative risk with the same value when other parameters are fixed. When the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium holds in the general population, the genetic model can be inferred by the deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in only cases. Furthermore, it is more efficient than that based on the deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in all cases and controls.",

        "abstract": "The abundance of low-temperature waste heat necessitates the development of reliable and scalable thermal-to-electric energy conversion technology. The thermoelectric device is one viable option. Commercially available Bi 2Te3-based materials are optimized for near room temperature cooling applications. Currently there are no mass-produced materials available for 400 K to 650 K thermoelectric power generation. We report the successful realization of high performance n-type Bi2(Te 1-xSex)3-based materials for the temperature range of interest, using a commercial zone-melting technique. The introduction of Se effectively increases the band gap, which significantly suppresses the \"turn-over\" in Seebeck coefficient and the appearance of a pronounced bipolar effect, shifting the corresponding temperature of the optimum thermoelectric figure of merit ZT towards a higher temperature range. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the electron concentration of Bi 2(Te0.5Se0.5)3 can be effectively adjusted by iodine doping. The samples with electron concentrations between 3 × 1019 and 4.5 × 1019 cm-3 display optimal thermoelectric performances. The highest ZT value reaches 0.86 at 600 K for the sample with the electron concentration of 4.0 × 1019 cm-3, whose average ZT between 400 K and 640 K is 0.8, making this scalable zone-melted low-Te content Bi2(Te0.5Se 0.5)3 compound a promising candidate for low-temperature power generation.

Sb is an effective doping element for n-type ZrNiSn half-Heuslers alloys. HH thermoelectric materials Hf 0.25 Zr 0.75 NiSn 1−x Sb x  (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.03) were synthesized by induction melting combined with plasma activated sintering (PAS) technique. X-ray diffraction concluded that single-phase HH compounds without compositional segregations were obtained. Presence of bended lamellar structures was revealed by the FESEM. Sb doping significantly enhanced the electrical conductivity, power factor and carrier concentration of the alloys. An increase in the carrier mobility was also observed. Consequently, optimum values of 4.36 × 10 −3  W/mK 2  and 4.7 × 10 20  cm −3  were achieved for power factor and carrier concentration, respectively. As a result, a  ZT  value of 0.83 at 923 K was obtained which is about 67% improvement compared to the un-doped sample.",

        "abstract": "For the static uplift pile load tests,the ideal tension condition is that only the tensile load is applied on the pile head.However,in the conventional uplift tests the reaction system can influence the soil surrounding piles.Also,the Osterberg cell test is also different from the ideal pushing condition where only the compressive force is applied on the pile toe,because the Osterber cell can influence the soil surrounding pile via contact soil or reaction pile beneath the pile toe.In this paper,the field pile load tests and FEM simulation are conducted to investigate the pile load tests under different loading conditions.It is found that the capacity of pile in the conventional uplift tests is closed to that in the Osterberg cell test,while the stiffness in the former is higher than that in the later.The Osterberg cell test,the ideal pushing test and ideal uplift test give similar results,which are regarded to be consistent with the characteristics of load transfer and settlement performance of real single tension piles.Therefore,the conventional uplift tests overestimate the stiffness of pile.It is due to the reaction system which transfers the reaction load to the soil surrounding the upper part of pile.On the one hand,the skin friction and the stiffness of the upper part of pile are increased.On the other hand,the reaction load increases the pile-soil relative displacement.For a given settlement of pile head,the practical tension tests can mobilize larger skin friction than the ideal tension tests and hence increases the stiffness of pile as well.",

        "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of morbidity/mortality from gynecologic malignancy. Early detection of disease is difficult due to the propensity for ovarian cancer to disseminate throughout the peritoneum. Currently, there is no single accurate test to detect primary or recurrent ovarian cancer. We report a novel clinical strategy using PPF: a multimodal, PET and optical, folate receptor (FR)-targeted agent for ovarian cancer imaging. The capabilities of PPF were evaluated in primary human ovarian cancer cells, in vivo xenografts derived from primary cells and ex vivo patient omemtum, as the heterogeneity and phenotype displayed by patients is retained. Primary cells uptake PPF in a FR-dependent manner demonstrating approximately a 5- to 25-fold increase in fluorescence. By both PET and fluorescence imaging, PPF specifically delineated FR-positive, ovarian cancer xenografts, with similar tumor-to-background ratios of 8.91±0.91 and 7.94±3.94, and micro-metastatic studding (<1mm), which demonstrated a 3.5-fold increase in PPF uptake over adjacent normal tissue. Ex vivo patient omentum demonstrated selective uptake of PFF by tumor deposits. The ability of PPF to identify metastatic deposits <1mm could facilitate more complete debulking (currently, optimal debulking is <10mm residual tumor), by providing a more sensitive imaging strategy improving treatment planning, response assessment and residual/ recurrent disease detection. Therefore, PPF is a novel clinical imaging strategy that could substantially improve the prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer by allowing pre-, post- and intra- operative tumor monitoring, detection and possibly treatment throughout all stages of therapy and tumor progression. © Ivyspring International Publisher.",

        "abstract": "Considering the disaster caused by leakage during tunnel construction and operation，finite difference method which takes the stress and pore pressure coupled effect into account is employed to study the influence on surrounding soils and parallel tunnel from different leakage positions. The disaster model of one place of stream-like leakage occurring on unit area of tunnel is established. The analysis shows that different leakage positions have different influence on surrounding soils. With the development of leakage，the lower leakage position causes wider vertical displacement field and deeper horizontal displacement field. The existence of parallel tunnel leads to the dissymmetric deformation and larger curvature distortion of the ground surface. Besides，different leakage positions can cause very different displacement modes of the parallel tunnel. Displacement of parallel tunnel could be larger than the leaky tunnel itself. Finally，influence zones of leakage positions are divided according to the impact of leakage on the leaky tunnel and the parallel tunnel. The research indicates that efficient and pertinent countermeasures according to the different leakage positions are necessary.",

On one hand, the earth berm in a pit can strengthen horizontal resisting force of the soil body in the passive zone owing to its gravity. On the other hand, it can reinforce the stability of the retaining structure due to the horizontal resisting force of itself. Considering the two points aforementioned, a method is constructed to determine embedment depth of retaining structures. And more, a pit excavation is computed by the proposed method for further investigations. The study shows that reinforcement of the earth berm on retaining structure is remarkable because of the large moment arm even the magnitude of the horizontal resisting force is not very great. Therefore, the needed embedment length of the retaining structure in the pit excavation having earth berm can be distinctly cut. It can be concluded that the earth berm method should be recommended in suitable situations for its better economy, higher efficiency and lower pollution.",

Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel aza-BODIPY-lipid building block and its self-assembly into a liposomal nanoparticle (BODIPYsome). We observed optically stable NIR J-aggregation within the BODIPYsome that is likely attributed to J-dimerization. BODIPYsomes with cholesterol showed enhanced colloidal stability while maintaining a high extinction coefficient (128 mM-1 cm-1) and high fluorescence quenching (99.70 ± 0.09%), which enables photoacoustic (PA) properties from its intact structure and recovered NIR fluorescence properties when it is disrupted in cancer cells. Finally, its capabilities for optical imaging (PA/fluorescence) were observed in an orthotopic prostate tumor mouse model 24 h after intravenous administration. Overall, the BODIPYsome opens the door for engineering new building blocks in the design of optically stable biophotonic imaging agents.",

Based on different characteristics of noises and signals, wavelet packet transform is used in the signal denoising, which can improve signal to noise ratio and particle inversion results. The DLS signal of 100 nm particles is denoised by the two methods and the auto correlation functions of the denoised signals are respectively inverted. The inversion error can be improved by 0.88%~6.41% after denoising by wavelet packet. Denoising results of different data amounts by the two methods show that, wavelet packet transform is more effective for short data, and when the data amount is greater than 1 × 106, the effects of the two denoising methods are almost the same.",

Due to hardware restrictions, the altitude control behaviour of blimp is modelled as a switched system with a constant time-delay complemented with uncertain bounded disturbances. In order to achieve state estimation, four differentiators are applied and compared, then HOMD (homogeneous finite-time) differentiator is chosen as an observer for vertical velocity and switching signal estimation. Next, a predictor-based controller is conceived, and in order to compensate the perturbation, the method for disturbance evaluation is designed still with the help of HOMD differentiator. Control scheme is implemented by Matlab Simulink, and finally, the performance of blimp altitude controller is verified in experiments.",

        "abstract": "The stability analysis of embankments reinforced by a single pile carried out by the authors shows that the limit equilibrium method can not consider the failure mechanism of the single pile at different locations and thus will overestimate the embankment stability when the composite shear strength is used. 3D and 2D numerical analyses are performed to study the stability of embankment supported by group rigid piles. The relative soil-pile displacement, internal forces and failure modes of piles are analyzed. The analysis results show that for the piles at different locations related to the embankment, the failure patterns and contribution to the embankment stability are different. The bending failure is more possible to occur than the shear failure. The cut-off mechanism is suggested and introduced into numerical analysis to consider the possible bending failure of piles when the embankment is approaching failure. The allowable shear strength of the piles is suggested when the limit equilibrium method is employed to analyze the stability of rigid piles supported embankment.",

Centrifuge tests and numerical analysis were performed to study the stability failure mechanisms of the embankments on soft soil reinforced with a single-row or group rigid columns. The numerical analysis and centrifuge tests both indicated that the failure modes of rigid columns varied with column bending stiffness and strength, slenderness ratio, and toe embedment and subsoil conditions. The possible failure modes of rigid columns leading the stability failure of embankment include the following types: (1) the primary bending failure of the columns occurred near the interface of soft and hard strata, followed by the secondary bending failure within the upper part of the columns; (2) the primary bending failure of the columns was followed by a collapse of the upper portion of the columns toward the embankment toe; (3) soil flew around columns. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

Normally, PMBs are functionalized with multiple solution-phase labeling and purification steps. Here, we make use of a flexible solid-phase approach for completely automated synthesis of PMBs. This enabled the creation of a new type of molecular beacon that uses a linear superquencher architecture. The 3' terminus was labeled with a photosensitizer by generating pyropheophorbide-labeled solid-phase support. The 5' terminus was labeled with up to three consecutive additions of a dark quencher phosphoramidite. These photosensitizing and quenching moieties were stable in the harsh DNA synthesis environment and their hydrophobicity facilitated PMB purification by HPLC. Linear superquenchers exhibited highly efficient quenching. This fully automated synthesis method simplifies not only the synthesis and purification of PMBs, but also the creation of new activatable photosensitizer designs.",

A simplified method is proposed to consider the effect of earth berm on the retaining pile based on the principle of elastic-reaction method. Calculating results show that with the same earth berm height, the displacement and bending moment of retaining pile can be reduced with the decrease of grade of earth berm or the increase of width of earth berm. But finally they will remain constant when certain grade of earth berm or width of earth berm is reached. The soil condition of earth berm also plays an important role for earth berm to reduce the displacement and bending moment of retaining pile. Well dewatering before excavation, protection of earth berm from being disturbed during excavation and prevention of earth berm from rain during and after excavation are important for earth berm to work. The earth berm can be treated with grouting or DMM when necessary. Case histories show that the results obtained by the suggested method agree fairly well with the field measured data. The application of earth berm in a large excavation project, where horizontal supporting system is no longer necessary, can save considerable cost and reduce construction period.",

        "abstract": "The syntheses of novel near-infrared (NIR) dyes with excellent optical properties in biological tissues have driven the continued improvement of fluorescence imaging of deeply seated tumors. Bacteriochlorophyll a (Bchl), a dye synthesized by the phototrophic bacteria, R. sphaeroids, is particularly suited for deep tissue imaging due to its high absorbance coefficient and good fluorescence quantum yield in the NIR spectrum. However, obstacles that impede the development of this fluorophore are its poor stability and lack of tumor specificity. These issues ultimately limit its utility for tumor detection. Herein we describe a robust synthesis of a novel Bchl analog, bacteriochlorin e(6) bisoleate (BchlBOA), which is chemically stable, has excellent photophysical properties (ex, 752 nm; em, 762 nm) and is tailored for the incorporation into a tumor targetable high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-like nanoparticle (NP). Incorporating BchlBOA into HDL (HDL-BchlBOA) yielded 12 nm sized particles, corresponding well with the diameter of native HDL. Functional cell uptake studies showed that HDL-BchlBOA was taken up by cells expressing the HDL receptor, scavenger receptor B type I (SR-BI), and was inhibited by 25-fold excess native HDL. Furthermore, the NP was successfully detected in KB cancer cells both in vitro and in tumor xenografts. Taken together, these results demonstrate that we successfully synthesized and formulated a stable analog of Bchl that is capable of being incorporated within HDL-like NPs for tumor-targeted imaging.",

The flexural capacity of rigid piles should be checked for the long-term stability of the embankment treated by rigid-pile composite ground. To reduce the difficulty of checking the flexural capacity of rigid piles in the composite ground under the embankment, the studies on simple methods for calculation of the bending moment of rigid piles are needed. First of all, the relationship between the maximum settlement and the maximum lateral deformation of embankments is statistically studied based on experimental and monitoring data of many soft ground and embankment projects of highways, and an empirical equation for the maximum settlement and the maximum lateral deformation of embankments is obtained. Then a simplified model for lateral forces of rigid piles is proposed using the lateral deformation curves of composite ground and rigid piles under embankments, and the relationship between the bending moment and the maximum lateral deformation of rigid piles is derived. The bending moment of rigid piles is suggested to be calculated according to the maximum settlement of embankments. The proposed method is proven to be simple and reasonable by an actual project. It is shown that the lateral deformation of piles is nearly equal to that of the surrounding soils, and the difference of lateral deformation between the piles and the soils can be neglected. The rigid piles can be thought to be fixed at the lower surface of soft stratum if their fixed length in underlying hard stratum is 7 times larger than their diameter.",

Based on the structure and communication features of satellite networks, a key management model was proposed which includes certificates, primary keys and session keys. Firstly, a protocol was designed for updating certificates of satellites and its security was studied. Secondly, a policy was designed for updating primary and session keys and its efficiency and security were analyzed by contrasts with other options. Lastly, the key updating processes were implemented under simulated satellite network environment. Based on test data, further contrast between our model and IBM's hybrid key management model was proposed and important suggestions in designing key updating policies were given.",

        "abstract": "Targeted nanoparticles have the potential to deliver a large drug payload specifically to cancer cells. Targeting requires\n that a ligand on the nanoparticle surface interact with a specific membrane receptor on target cells. However, the contribution\n of the targeting ligand to nanoparticle delivery is often influenced by non-specific nanoparticle uptake or secondary targeting\n mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-targeting specificity of a nanoparticle\n by dual-color fluorescent labeling. The targeted nanoparticle was a fluorescently labeled, EGF-conjugated HDL-like peptide–phospholipid\n scaffold (HPPS) and the cell lines expressed EGF receptor linked with green fluorescent protein (EGFR-GFP). Using LDLA7 cells\n partially expressing EGFR-GFP, fluorescence imaging demonstrated the co-internalization of EGFR-GFP and EGF-HPPS, thus validating\n its targeting specificity. Furthermore, specific EGFR-mediated uptake of the EGF-HPPS nanoparticle was confirmed using human\n non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells. Subsequent confocal microscopy and flow cytometry studies delineated how secondary\n targeting mechanisms affected the EGFR targeting. Together, this study confirms the EGFR targeting of EGF-HPPS in lung cancer\n cells and provides insight on the potential influence of unintended targets on the desired ligand–receptor interaction.",

In the present study, we determined the effect of manganese on the expression of α-synuclein in PC12 cells and its role in manganese-induced cytotoxicity. We also investigated the relationship between α-synuclein expression and the change of ERK1/2 MAPK activity. In our research, manganese exposure induced the overexpression of α-synuclein, while siRNA knockdown of α-synuclein reversed manganese-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, manganese induced the activation of ERK1/2 MAPK. The MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, which inhibits the activation of ERK MAPK, attenuated the overexpression of α-synuclein and the cytotoxicity induced by manganese. In conclusion, our studies show that manganese may induce the overexpression of α-synuclein via ERK1/2 activation, which may play a role in manganese-induced cytotoxicity.",

Molecular imaging techniques such as fluorescence are essential for illuminating the nano-bio interface to guide nanomedicine development. With advances in reliable labelling of nanoparticles with fluorophores, integrated Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) provides responsive fluorescence linked to nanomedicine integrity and function. In this review, we provide an overview of developments in the application of integrated FRET for imaging nanomedicines during nano-bio interactions. Furthermore, we discuss technical considerations and a general methodology for maximizing information from integrated FRET imaging and advancing its use as a routine tool in nanomedicine research.",

The proposed MFTSMC combines a model-free control approach with a sliding-mode technique and makes possible to eliminate the tracking error in a finite time. To demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed MFTSMC, numerical simulation results have been obtained and compared with corresponding results for PID, backstepping and sliding-mode controls.",

        "abstract": "The discovery and synthesis of multifunctional organic building blocks for nanoparticles have remained challenging. Texaphyrin macrocycles are multifunctional, all-organic compounds that possess versatile metal-chelation capabilities and unique theranostics properties for biomedical applications. Unfortunately, there are significant difficulties associated with the synthesis of texaphyrin-based subunits capable of forming nanoparticles. Herein, the detailed synthesis of a texaphyrin-phospholipid building block is reported via a key 1,2-dinitrophenyl-phospholipid intermediate, along with stable chelation of two clinically relevant metal ions into texaphyrin-lipid without compromising their self-assembly into texaphyrin nanoparticles or nanotexaphyrin. A postinsertion methodology to quantitatively insert a variety of metal-ions into preformed nanotexaphyrins is developed and employed to synthesize a structurally stable, mixed  indium-manganese-nanotexaphyrin for dual modal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In vivo dual SPECT/MRI imaging of  In-Mn-nanotexaphyrins in an orthotopic prostatic PC3 mouse model demonstrates complementary signal enhancement in the tumor with both modalities at 22 h post intravenous administration. This result highlights the utility of hybrid metallo-nanotexaphyrins to achieve sensitive and accurate detection of tumors by accommodating multiple imaging modalities. The power of this mixed and matched metallo-nanotexaphyrin strategy can be unleashed to allow a diverse range of multifunctional biomedical imaging.",

The cohort consisted of 16 male and 16 female patients, with a mean age of 45 years (range: 7 - 62 years). Biopsy targets were identified according to PET and (1)H-MRS. Biopsy was performed with Varioguide frameless biopsy system. Diagnostic yield and complications were assessed.Metabolism images-based multimodal neuronavigation and iMRI were successfully implemented in all cases. iMRI confirmed accuracy of biopsy targets. All the specimens obtained pathological diagnosis, the diagnostic yield was 100%. In 1 patient, iMRI found small hematoma (< 5 ml), surgical evacuation wasn't needed with intraoperative complication rate 3.1%. With the help of multimodal neuronavigation, no patients had new or worsened neurologic deficits.Integration of metabolism images into multimodal neuronavigation provide not only anatomical, but also metabolic and functional information for frameless stereotaxy, increasing diagnostic yield and avoiding postoperative neurologic deficits.",

Western blot was performed to determine the level of phosphorylated c-Jun-N-terminal kinase/stress activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPK). The cells were pretreated with SP600125, an inhibitor of JNK pathway, and then the number of apoptotic cells were counted by using TUNEL stain, observing its influence on cell apoptosis seduced by MPP+.MPP+ poisoning can cause the increase of phosphorylation level of JNK1/2 cells.

        "abstract": "This study evaluates the failure modes and the bearing capacity of soft ground reinforced by a group of floating stone columns. A finite difference method was adopted to analyze the performance of reinforced ground under strip footings subjected to a vertical load. The investigation was carried out by varying the aspect ratio of the reinforced zone, the area replacement ratio, and the surface surcharge. General shear failure of the reinforced ground was investigated numerically without the surcharge. The results show the existence of an effective length of the columns for the bearing capacity factors N c and N γ. When certain surcharge was applied, the failure mode of the reinforced ground changed from the general shear failure to the block failure. The aspect ratio of the reinforced zone and the area replacement ratio also contributed to this failure mode transition. A counterintuitive trend of the bearing capacity factor N q can be justified with a shift in the critical failure mode. An upper-bound limit method based on the general shear failure mode was presented, and the results agree well with those of the previous studies of reinforced ground. Equivalent properties based on the area-weighted average of the stone columns and clay parameters were used to convert the individual column model to an equivalent area model. The numerical model produced reasonable equivalent properties. Finally, a theoretical method based on the comparison of the analytical equations for different failure modes was developed for engineering design. Good agreement was found between the theoretical and numerical results for the critical failure mode and its corresponding bearing capacity factors.",
