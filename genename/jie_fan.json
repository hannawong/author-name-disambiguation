In this work, the effects of the arrangement of auxiliary electrode, applied voltage, injection speed, and the distance between the electrode tip and the spinneret tip (ESD) on the jet number and the morphology of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibers were investigated systematically. The results showed that the number of jets firstly increased and then decreased with the increase of applied voltage and ESD, respectively, while increasing with the injection speed in both the auxiliary electrode in the vertical position and parallel position. The average nanofiber diameter decreased with increasing of applied voltage and injection speed, but decreasing in ESD in these two positions. The numerical simulation results revealed that the auxiliary electrode primarily influenced the electric field intensity in the spinning area. This work provides a deep understanding of multiple jets in electrospinning.",

        "abstract": "In elderly patients, bacterial infection often causes severe complications and sepsis. Compared to younger patients, older patients are more susceptible to sepsis caused by respiratory infection. Macrophage (Mϕ) phagocytosis of bacteria plays a critical role in the clearance of pathogens and the initiation of immune responses. It has been suggested that Mϕ exhibit age-related functional alterations, including reduced chemotaxis, phagocytosis, antibacterial defense, and the ability to generate reactive oxygen species. However, the mechanisms behind these changes remain unclear. The present study sought to determine changes in bacterial phagocytosis in aging alveolar Mϕ (AMϕ) and the underlying mechanisms. We show that bacteria initiate cytoskeleton remodeling in AMϕ through interaction with macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO), a bacterial scavenger receptor. This remodeling, in turn, promotes enhanced cell surface expression of MARCO and bacterial phagocytosis. We further demonstrate that Rac1-GTP mediates MARCO signaling and activates actin-related protein-2/3 complex, an F-actin nucleator, thereby inducing F-actin polymerization, filopodia formation, and increased cell surface expression of MARCO, all of which are essential for the execution of bacteria phagocytosis. However, AMϕ isolated from aging mice exhibit suppressed Rac1 mRNA and protein expression, which resulted in decreases in Rac1-GTP levels and actin-related protein-2/3 activation, as well as subsequent attenuation of F-actin polymerization, filopodia formation, and cell surface expression of MARCO. As a result, bacterial phagocytosis in aging AMϕ is decreased. This study highlights a previously unidentified mechanism by which aging impairs Mϕ phagocytosis of bacteria. Targeting these pathways may improve outcomes of bacterial infection in elderly patients.",

Parallel syntheses of MMMOs libraries achieve greater stability, precision, highly dispersion, and uniformity. MMMOs libraries with varied composition, stoichiometrics and self-assembled nanostructures can be prepared by ejecting precursors microdroplets via nozzles with the aid of a computer specification design file and software (>104 samples/day).

        "abstract": "Sepsis and endotoxin (LPS) have been demonstrated to impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. However, the intracellular mechanism responsible for this defect is not fully defined. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether specific elements of the insulin receptor (IR) signaling pathway in skeletal muscle are altered by LPS. In vivo injection of Escherichia coli LPS resulted in a 44% reduction in whole body glucose disposal under euglycemic hyperinsulinemic conditions, which was largely accounted for by a decreased rate of glycogen synthesis. Scatchard analysis indicated that the number and affinity of the high-affinity insulin binding sites in muscle were similar between control and LPS-treated rats. Western blot analysis indicated that under basal conditions, the levels of total and phosphorylated IR, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase were not significantly different between control and endotoxic rats. In control animals, muscle obtained 2 min after intravenous injection of a maximally stimulating dose of insulin demonstrated a marked increase in the amount of phosphorylated IR (approximately 5-fold), IRS-1 (approximately 10-fold), and MAP kinase (approximately 10-fold). Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IR, IRS-1, and MAP kinase was markedly diminished (approximately 75%, 90%, and 78%, respectively) in LPS-treated rats. However, there was no concomitant reduction in the total abundance of these proteins under hyperinsulinemic conditions. These data demonstrate that LPS alters multiple steps in the insulin signal transduction pathway, but not insulin binding, in skeletal muscle that may mediate the observed impairment in glucose uptake.",

        "abstract": "Mesoporous non-silicate oxides (MNSOs), with well-defined organization on the 2-50 nm size scale, may play a pivotal role in advancing vital disciplines such as catalysis, energy conversion and biotechnology. The vast majority of known MNSOs have a pore size less than 16 nm due to the limited dimensions of the organic templates. Herein, we present a simple and general method for the synthesis of MNSOs with extra-large three-dimensional mesoporous structures, which is based on uniform coating of non-silicate oxide nanoparticle precursors onto the surface of mesoporous silica EP-FDU-12. The successful synthesis of MNSOs relies on two key factors: the extra-large, 3-D open mesoporous networks of the EP-FDU-12 hard-template and the stable NSO nanoparticles formed in AcHE solution. Extra-large pore size and window size are prerequisites to avoid the local aggregation and phase separation of the coating metal oxides. The coating thickness can be easily controlled by changing the initial concentration ratio of raw materials. The successful uniform coating of NSOs in the AcHE sol-gel system allows us to synthesize a large variety of EP-NSOs (EP-Al 2O3, EP-TiO2, EP-ZrO2, EP-Ce-TiO2 and EP-K-Ce-TiO2). The EP-Al2O 3 and Pd/EP-Al2O3 catalysts have been investigated in the F-C alkylation and n-hexane combustion reactions, which serve as two examples to show that catalytic reactions can benefit from the extra-large, 3-D open mesoporous networks with improved adsorption and diffusion of reactants and designed metal-to-support interfaces. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

The reason why the single plant location is different with developed country in China rural. This has a number of important effects. First,the transaction costs is now different rural enterprises and city enterprises for different economic institution. The transaction costs that private found a plant is higher in city than in rural in 1980s’The institution environments and consanguinity are able to reduce transaction costs rural industrial enterprises in China rural region. Following from this there is the possibility of effects where the price of land is lower in rural than in city.We consider a simple model with transportation costs, transaction costs, land costs and labor costs. We analyze the process of location change of rural industrial enterprises in China,and find some conclusion. ①The theory of location still work on rural industry in China. ②The industrial enterprises achieve success in Chinese rural is a necessary result that non-state enterprises was restricted by center government in city,however, the restriction was feeble in rural. ③The rural industrial enterprises are centralizing to city and town in China. Transportation cost,centralizing factor, information cost have become main factors that influence location of plant in China.",

The resulted materials' structures were characterized by XRD, TEM, 27Al NMR, NH3-TPD and Py-FT-IR. The amount of surfactant and the Si/Al mole ratio would both affect the materials meso-structure; while, the amount of HAc has little effect on the structure. TEM analysis confirmed that these aluminum silicates with different Si/Al mole ratios have an ordered 2D hexagonal regularity. Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction of anisole and benzyl alcohol was used as the probe reaction to detect the acidic properties of these aluminum silicates. The Si/Al mole ratio played an important role in catalytic activity and the aluminum silicates with nSi/nAl = 10 showed the best acid catalytic activity. NH3-TPD and Py-FT-IR suggested that the aluminum silicates with nSi/nAl = 10 had much more Brõnsted acidic sites than that of other Si/Al ratios.",

        "abstract": "A one-step nanocasting route has been demonstrated to prepare highly ordered single-crystal indium oxide nanowire (IONW) arrays with mesostructured frameworks. Unlike the reported multistep nanocasting process (synthesis of mesoporous materials, and then incorporation of precursors and formation of inorganic frameworks), a highly ordered mesostructured surfactant-silica monolith with low external surface serves as both the template and the reducing agent and makes the formation of single-crystal IONWs in its channels easily in one step by using normal In(NO(3))(3) as an inorganic precursor. After silica is removed, highly ordered uniform single-crystal IONW arrays with hexagonal (p6mm) or cubic (Ia3d) mesostructures are derived. These new materials are studied by XRD, SEM, TEM, N(2) adsoption, and UV spectrum. Furthermore, this one-step nanocasting synthesis route is a generalized method and can be used to synthesized a highly ordered mesoporous silica monolith with metal oxide nanocrystals in its channels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a single crystalline mesostructured In(2)O(3) framework.",

        "abstract": "Abnormal osteoclast formation and osteolysis are the hallmarks of multiple myeloma (MM) bone disease, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we show that the AKT pathway was up-regulated in primary bone marrow monocytes (BMM) from patients with MM, which resulted in sustained high expression of the receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) in osteoclast precursors. The up-regulation of RANK expression and osteoclast formation in the MM BMM cultures was blocked by AKT inhibition. Conditioned media from MM cell cultures activated AKT and increased RANK expression and osteoclast formation in BMM cultures. Inhibiting AKT in cultured MM cells decreased their growth and ability to promote osteoclast formation. Of clinical significance, systemic administration of the AKT inhibitor LY294002 blocked the formation of tumor tissues in the bone marrow cavity and essentially abolished the MM-induced osteoclast formation and osteolysis in SCID mice. The level of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) protein was up-regulated in the BMM cultures from multiple myeloma patients. Adenoviral overexpression of ATF4 activated RANK expression in osteoclast precursors. These results demonstrate a new role of AKT in the MM promotion of osteoclast formation and bone osteolysis through, at least in part, the ATF4-dependent up-regulation of RANK expression in osteoclast precursors.",

        "abstract": "Ecological occupiability refers to the attribute of ecological space when it was occupied by human being.The space is of low occupiability if the whole ecosystem was damaged from the perspective of structure and function for the occupation.The structure,function and its connections with surroundings are of great importance in determining the ecological occupiability.The least cost distance indicated the work or cost from the source to the destination through units with different resistance.The resistance value indicates the suitability of certain landscape units for distribution of ecological space.Adopting Xijiang River Economic Belt(XREB) for a case study,we designed the resistance of different rasters with a size of 90×90 m2 based on land use of XREB and built resistance surface.Using nature reserve as sources,we carried out calculation on minimum cumulative resistance from sources to destination through cost-distance model of ArcGIS.The ecological occupiability of landscape unit and zoning of XREB were calculated and established accordingly.Results indicated that the low-,lower-middle-,middle-,higher-middle-,and high-value zones of ecological occupiability accounted for 12.17%,18.75%,38.55%,28.69% and 1.84% of the whole study area,respectively.Moreover,most of the construction land distributed at higher-middle-value zone,accounted for 55.29%,58.73% and 63.86% of the urban & town land,rural land and industrial & mining land.The distributions of the rest parts of the three types of the construction land were different.Most of the rest of the urban & town land was located in high-value zones;while most of the rest of the rural and industrial & mining lands was located in middle-value zones.Minute quantity of the rural and industrial & mining lands was located in nature reserve.The high-value zone has been already developed intensively,and the optimization of spatial structure and function should be carried out in the future.The higher-middle value zone should be the focus for future urbanization and industrialization,while the middle-value zone could be developed but to a within certain intensity.Ecological construction should be the main task of the lower-middle-and low-value zones.We concluded that the analysis of ecological occupiability based on the least-cost distance model could explain the distribution of various types of construction lands and spatial pattern of ecological space.Although the analysis and corresponding zoning were affected by the spatial distribution of source,extent and scale,it is of great significance for guiding the regional development and establishment of ecological security pattern.",

        "abstract": "Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) is primarily a disease of the elderly, and age-dependent decrease in Ca1.2 and Ca1.3 Ca channels within the sinus node has been shown to play an important role in sinoatrial node (SAN) degeneration; however, posttranscriptional mechanisms regulating decrease in Ca1.2 and Ca1.3 Ca channels remain unclear. Some studies have reported that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in age-related cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, little is known about the roles of miRNAs in age-related SSS. This study investigated whether miR-1976 was involved in the regulation of SAN degeneration by targeting Ca1.2 and Ca1.3 Ca channels. First, using microarray-based miRNA expression profiling and qRT-PCR, we confirmed that miR-1976 was upregulated in the plasma of patients with age-related SSS relative to healthy controls. By employing target gene prediction software, luciferase assay and western blotting, we further confirmed Ca1.2 and Ca1.3 as direct targets of miR-1976. Furthermore, miR-1976 levels in rabbit SAN tissues were negatively correlated with Ca1.2 and Ca1.3 expression and intrinsic heart rates but positively correlated with corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT). Additionally, miR-1976 transgenic mice displayed attenuated Ca1.2 and Ca1.3 protein expression, which led to sinus node dysfunction. These results suggest that miR-1976 plays an important role in the SAN aging process by targeting Ca1.2 and Ca1.3. Thus, miR-1976 could have great potential as a noninvasive diagnostic tool and therapeutic target for SSS. These findings may reveal important insights into the pathogenesis of SSS.",

        "abstract": "Slope settlement is an important type of mountain settlement.From the perspective of regional development,the slope settlement is always related to mountain settlement with poor ecological and backward economic conditions,as well as the major region for shaking off poverty of the country.As the state functional planning is put into practice,it is very important to fully recognize these problems,such as ecology,poverty,re-settlement,population relocation and so on.The paper took Zhaotong as a study area to adequately explore the spatial characteristics of slope-type settlements and analyze the mechanism from the perspective of regional development.This not only increased the case of mountain settlement study,but also provided some references for construction of residential environment,rural population movement,migration and so forth.The paper revealed the spatial characteristics of slope settlement in Zhaotong by using 50 m grid terrain data in 2005,1 ∶ 100000 topographic map,remote sensing data of land use in 2000,and GIS spatial analysis.The result showed that slope-type settlements in Zhaotong had five distinctive features such as high proportion,high density,scattered layout,high intensity of human activities,and vertical differentiation of national settlements.Besides,from the perspective of regional development,the paper also analyzed the formation mechanism of slope settlement in Zhaotong,and found that the spatial distribution of slope settlements was the result of many factors.Firstly,the steep terrain was the natural background of the development of slope settlements.Secondly,it gathered a lot of people in the historical period,while the topography restricted the improvement of traffic condition,thus limiting the local population to foreign exchange and diffusion.Thirdly,traditional farming industry brought about long-term stable growth of population,which led to high density,decentralized development.Finally,the above-mentioned conditions hindered the process of industrialization and urbanization,which increased the difficulty of reasonable allocation of slope settlements,leading to the co-existence of decentralized and high density,high slope and high intensity of human activities.In conclusion,objectively,the spatial distribution of slope settlements was affected by natural and geographical conditions in Zhaotong,but the fact could not be ignored that irrational regional development and inappropriate regional development path were also the important causes,which not only resulted in worsening slope settlement habitats,but also turned them into the urgent problem of regional development in Zhaotong.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To compare PSAD (PSA density), PSA, free-to total PSA (F/T PSA) ratio used in the prediction of bone metastasis in Chinese pro-static cancer. Methods: A total of 87 patients with histologically diagnosed prostate cancer were treated in our hospital from May 2002 to April 2005. Serum PSA levels were measured using a PROSTATUS™ PSA Free/Total DELFIA kit automatic immunoassay. Prostate volume was estimated by both abdominal and transrectal ultrasound measurements using the prostate ellipse formula (0.52×length × width×height). PSAD (PSA/volume) was calculated by dividing serum PSA level by prostate volume. ECT and MRI were used for detection of bone metastasis. Results: Three groups were stratified by PSA level (<10 μg/L, 10-50 μg/L and >50 μg/L), the correlations were shown between bone metastasis and PSA or PSAD (r=0.45038, p=0.0028 and r=0.64158, p=0.0001 respectively), but not with F/T PSA. With PSAD cutoff of 0.4, the correlation was also shown (r=0.60761, p=0.0006). A sensitivity, a specificity, a positive predictive value and a negative predictive value of PSAD cut-off of 0.4 were 84.44%, 50.00%, 64.41% and 89.47%. A sensitivity, a specificity, a positive predictive value and a negative predictive value of PSA cut-off of 50 μg/L were 70.83%, 64.00%, 79.07% and 21.92%. PSAD cut-off of 0.4 combined with PSA cut-off of 50 μg/L were showed the highest sum of sensitivity and negative predictive value, which gave a sensitivity of 95.45%, a specificity of 39.53%, a positive predictive value of 61.76% and a negative predictive value of 89.47%. Conclusion: Although further studies are needed to determine optimal cut-off value to be used in clinical practice, PSAD cut-off of 0.4 combined with PSA cut-off of 50 μg/L seems to be useful for the prediction of bone metastasis in chinese prostate cancer patients. This would justify its utility in clinical practice reducing unnecessary ECT and MRI examinations, which are relatively expensive for Chinese patients.",

        "abstract": "A new ·CN radical molecular surface chemisorption strategy was developed to modify Pt/C electrocatalysts in a green and facile manner via a photo-Fenton cyanation process. After the surface modification, the Pt/C electrocatalysts display better specific activity for ORR and a significantly enhanced methanol (MeOH)-tolerant property in both alkline and acidic media. The experimental observations and DFT calculations suggest that the unique electrochemical performance of CN–Pt/C might be derived from the covalent nature of the interaction between ·CN and Pt surface. In particular, it hinders the formation of detrimental OHad–K+(H2O)x, CN–K+(H2O)x, or CN–Na+(H2O)x clusters on the surface of PtNPs, which could block the access of oxygen molecules. Meanwhile, the adsorption of MeOH molecules becomes more difficult as compared to unmodified Pt in KOH solution on the basis of the DFT calculations, making CN–Pt/C an efficient cathode electrocatalyst to alleviate the MeOH crossover problem in alkaline DMFCs.

Scanning electron microscopy micrographs showed small amounts of organic montmorillonite addition (u003c3%) and increase in the diameter of polyimide nanofibers. However, higher organic montmorillonite fraction generated microspheres due to the aggregation of clay nanoplatelets. Transmission electron microscopy images indicated that both exfoliated and intercalated organic montmorillonites existed in polyimide nanofibers when low quantity of clay was loaded (u003c3%). As the clay amount increased, exfoliated structure disappeared and stacked clay layers were observed. The optimum concentration of organic montmorillonite is 3%. By incorporating 3% clay, the tensile strength and modulus of membrane increased by 92.1 and 48.6%, respectively. Moreover, the limiting oxygen index value arose from 29.2 to 30.4%.

This article argues that the reasonable evolution of industrial space should be a process that maximizes the comprehensive efficiency which includes spatial pattern, temporal arrangement and systematic organization of an industrial park. This is the aim of industrial park planning. Meanwhile, the planning of industrial park cannot ignore the problems of both quantum binding and disproportion of construction suitability of land resources. In the end, several countermeasures about industrial park planning are advanced from node organization of industry system, requirement of resources and environment, function forming of industrial parks, relation with urbanization and driving forces of market and government etc.",

        "abstract": "Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is essential for bone formation. However, the mechanism of its actions in bone is poorly understood. The present study examined the role for ATF4 in the regulation of proliferation and survival of primary mouse bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and osteoblasts. Results showed that Atf4(-/-) cells display a severe proliferative defect as measured by multiple cell proliferation assays. Cell cycle progression of Atf4(-/-) BMSCs was largely delayed with significant G1 arrest. Expression of cyclin D1 was decreased both at the mRNA and protein level. A similar proliferation defect was observed in Atf4(-/-) calvarial periosteal osteoblasts when compared with wt control. Knocking down Atf4 mRNA by small interfering RNA in MC3T3-E1 subclone 4 preosteoblasts markedly reduced expression of cyclin D1 and cell proliferation. In contrast, overexpression of ATF4 increased cyclin D1 expression as well as cell proliferation in Atf4(-/-) BMSCs. In addition, apoptosis was significantly increased in Atf4(-/-) BMSCs and calvarial periosteal osteoblasts relative to wt controls. Taken together, these results for the first time demonstrate that ATF4 is a critical regulator of proliferation and survival in BMSCs and osteoblasts in vitro and in vivo.",

Taking Beijing City as an example, this paper analyzes supply and demand relationships and upper limits for the growth of land resources during the process of urban development. By analyzing dominant factors and trends in the demand for land resources, this paper gives preliminary estimates on the minimum size of the land demand in Beijing in view of constructing a World City. According to the basic characteristics of supply and demand relationships for land, current land use in Beijing is confronting a grim situation of conflict between supply and demand. We also point out maximum growth and three types of constraints on land resources. Last, we propose solutions to resource and environmental bottlenecks, and urban disease amid urban development.",

        "abstract": "No-commercial energy like firewood and straw is the basic livelihood asset on which the rural households in poverty-stricken and mountainous areas rely. Over-harvesting firewood is one of the dominant factors for soil erosion and deforestation in ecologically frangible region. Mountainous areas of Southwest China are poverty-stricken areas and ecologically frangible region as well. This study investigates the rural energy consumption characteristics by 946 survey questionnaires in the city of Zhaotong, Yunnan Province, Southwest China. Overall, coal is the dominant energy, and the second is by non-commercial or traditional energy such as firewood and straw, followed by electricity and biogas utilization. Meanwhile, energy consumption structure of rural households displays a marked spatial distribution, with coal dominated at flat river valley areas and firewood concentrated in mountainous areas. Moreover, this study also analyzes the factors affecting the proportion of non-commercial and commercial energy consumption by the Tobit model. The results show that (1) Firewood and straw consumption is affected mainly by the per-capita forest land and per-capita arable land, while coal is subject to price, availability and accessibility. (2) With the increase of per-capita income, the proportion of the non-commercial energy would decline while the proportion of coal and electric energy would rise. However, it is difficult for poverty-stricken areas such as mountainous areas of Southwest China to upgrade the energy consumption structure due to living assets shortage and low income. (3) Development of education and expansion of employment in non-agricultural industry are helpful for households in this region to reduce the proportion of traditional energy and increase the proportion of commercial energy consumption. Only in this way can their energy consumption structure be changed.",

        "abstract": "Metal nanodendritic structures have attracted a lot of attention because of their high activity toward catalytic reactions. Herein, we present a facile method for the one-pot synthesis of highly branched PtCu alloy nanodendrites. The composition of the PtCu nanodendrites can be easily tuned by changing the molar ratio of the precursors. The PtCu nanodendrites exhibit efficient catalytic activity toward the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Particularly, the Pt1Cu1 nanodendrites exert 4.6× increase in the specific activity and 3.8× increase in the mass activity compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The mechanism of the enhancement was comprehensively studied. The enhanced catalytic activities can be ascribed to the high index surface of the branched structure and the electronic effect between the alloy metals. Specifically, the addition of Cu downshifts the binding energy of Pt, increasing the CO-tolerance ability of PtCu nanodendrites and, hence, improves their MOR activities. Moreover, the PtCu nano...",

        "abstract": "PurposeBladder carcinoma is the most common urological malignancy in China. Gene mutation may be one of causes of carcinogenesis in the cancer. We therefore investigated the mRNA expression of RTKN gene in clinic malignant bladder carcinoma and explored the relationship between the novel gene and the cancer.MethodsTotal RNA was extracted from 33 surgically resected specimens of bladder carcinoma and 19 specimens of tumor-free bladder tissues. After the optimal reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction condition was established, the mRNA expression levels of the RTKN gene in the lesions and tumor-free bladder tissues were examined semiquantitatively, and the relationships between expression levels of RTKN and clinical pathological features were analyzed.ResultsThe expression of RTKN gene mRNA in 33 human bladder carcinoma tissues was significantly higher than that in 19 human tumor-free bladder tissues (0.937±0.103 vs. 0.350±0.082). The average ratio of RTKN expression in neoplasms to that in tumor-free bladder tissues was 0.350±0.164. Based on this ratio the 33 patients were divided into three groups: a downregulated expression group ( n=2), an upregulated expression group ( n=22), and an unchanged group ( n=9). Although the χ 2 test demonstrated a statistically nonsignificant differences in RTKN expression between tumor stages Ta, T 1, and T 2 overall in the 33 human bladder carcinoma, the t test showed that there were statistically significant differences between solitary and multiple tumors, between the paired group aged younger or older than 70 years in 27 de novo bladder carcinoma patients, and between the groups with tumor larger or smaller than 2.25 cm 3.ConclusionsThese results suggest that the RTKN gene is involved in bladder carcinogenesis and progression in bladder carcinoma, indicating that RTKN gene could be a molecular target in cancer therapy.",

The structure features a drain vertical field plate and a gate vertical field plate (DTDP SOI). The assisted depletion effect of the dual vertical field plate brings two benefits. Firstly, the distribution of electric field in the drift region is modulated and the average electric field strength is enhanced, resulting in the improvement in BV. Secondly, the optimal doping concentration of drift region is significantly increased, which reduces the Ron,sp significantly by reducing the resistance of the drift region in the on-state. The mechanism of the dual vertical field plate is analyzed and the characteristics of BV and Ron,sp are discussed. It is shown that the BV of the DTDP SOI increases from 345 V of the dual trench lateral MOSFET and 152 V of the conventional lateral MOSFET to 485 V, and the highest figure of merit is obtained for the DTDP SOI in the three structures due to its low Ron, sp.",

        "abstract": "Bone mass is controlled through a delicate balance between osteoblast-mediated bone formation and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. We show here that RNA editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is critical for proper control of bone mass. Postnatal conditional knockout of Adar1 (the gene encoding ADAR1) resulted in a severe osteopenic phenotype. Ablation of the Adar1 gene significantly suppressed osteoblast differentiation without affecting osteoclast differentiation in bone. In vitro deletion of the Adar1 gene decreased expression of osteoblast-specific osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein genes, alkaline phosphatase activity, and mineralization, suggesting a direct intrinsic role of ADAR1 in osteoblasts. ADAR1 regulates osteoblast differentiation by, at least in part, modulation of osterix expression, which is essential for bone formation. Further, ablation of the Adar1 gene decreased the proliferation and survival of bone marrow stromal cells and inhibited the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells towards osteoblast lineage. Finally, shRNA knockdown of the Adar1 gene in MC-4 pre-osteoblasts reduced cyclin D1 and cyclin A1 expression and cell growth. Our results identify ADAR1 as a new key regulator of bone mass and suggest that ADAR1 functions in this process mainly through modulation of the intrinsic properties of osteoblasts (i.e., proliferation, survival and differentiation).",

        "abstract": "Hemorrhagic shock (HS) renders patients susceptible to development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) through mechanisms that are, as yet, unclear. Cell necroptosis, a form of regulated inflammatory cell death, is one of the mechanisms that controls cell release of inflammatory mediators from innate immune cells, such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), and critically regulates the progress of inflammation. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of alveolar macrophage (AMϕ) effects on PMN necroptosis following HS. With the use of in vivo and ex vivo HS models, we reveal a novel function of shock-activated AMϕ in promoting PMN necroptosis. We demonstrate that exosomes released from HS-activated AMϕ induce mainly NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) production inside PMNs and subsequent promotion of necroptosis. These findings explore a previously unidentified pathway of AMϕ-PMN cross-talk, which causes enhanced PMN necroptosis and subsequent exaggerated post-HS lung inflammation. The targeting of this PMN death pathway may serve as a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of post-HS SIRS.",

        "abstract": "Manipulation of the intracellular redox state has been shown to alter cell activation pathways with resultant changes in cellular function. Previous studies have suggested that thiol oxidation, using the glutathione-depleting agent diethyl maleate (DEM), was able to inhibit endothelial cell activation. We hypothesized that this agent might exert beneficial effects following endotoxemia in the rat, a model in which transendothelial migration of neutrophils is central to the development of hepatocellular injury. Sprague-Dawley rats treated intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (200 microg/kg) plus D-galactosamine (GalN) (600 mg/kg) developed hepatocellular necrosis, as evidenced by liver enzyme release and morphological changes. Pretreatment with DEM abrogated this injury in a dose-dependent fashion. Histology revealed reduced neutrophil accumulation in both the parenchyma and sinusoids, consistent with reduced neutrophil sequestration and transendothelial migration. This effect appeared to be related to the ability of DEM to prevent LPS-induced up-regulation of both vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) mRNA and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) mRNA in the liver, as well as reducing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mRNA expression. In addition, DEM prevented hepatocyte apoptosis following LPS treatment. The effect was reproduced when TNF was used as an inflammatory stimulus, suggesting a direct protective effect on the hepatocyte. Taken together, these studies show that redox manipulation through thiol oxidation may represent a novel approach to preventing liver necrosis and apoptosis in inflammatory conditions.",

        "abstract": "Base-free hydrogen evolution from formaldehyde solution represents one of the most important reactions in the fuel cell based hydrogen economy. However, limited progresses have been made in the rational design of cheap and efficient heterogeneous catalysts for this reaction. Here, we for the first time propose a Lewis acid–base combination strategy to design efficient heterogeneous catalysts for HER from HCHO/H2O. By utilizing the Lewis acid/base properties of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O/ZnO, we successfully fabricated core–shell structured ZnO@Bi(NO3)3 composites. A strong interfacial electronic interaction between ZnO and Bi(NO3)3·5H2O is evidenced by the unprecedented 3.3 eV upshift of Zn 2p and 0.5 eV downshift of Bi 4f, which boosts the HER activities of inert ZnO and Bi(NO3)3·5H2O. Destroying the interfacial electronic interaction leads to a fast deactivation while increasing interfacial sites proportionally enhances the activity, indicating that interfacial sites are real active sites.

In this work, we present a systematic study of a Pt/ZnO catalyst for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol at room temperature under base-free aqueous conditions. Experimental observations and density functional theory calculations suggest that ZnO as a support can facilitate the adsorption of benzyl alcohol, which subsequently reacts with the activated oxygen species on the Pt catalyst, producing benzaldehyde. The resulting solid achieves a high conversion (94.1 ± 5.1% in 10 h) of benzyl alcohol and nearly 100% selectivity to benzaldehyde with ambient air as the oxidant. In addition, by introducing a small amount of Bi (1.78 wt%) into Pt/ZnO, we can further enhance the activity by 350%.",

        "abstract": "Regional gap is an important problem that the regional development of China is facing. The distribu-tion of economy and population,as an embodiment of the spatial equilibrium process of regional development,has a close relation with the state of regional gap. Using gravity models,it works out the center of economic gravity and population gravity (abbr. CEG and CPG),illustrates the coupling process by measuring the overlap-ping of two centers of gravity and the consistency of their movement,and proves that the coupling process has a high correlation with the evolution of regional gap. Then,a model of the coupling mechanism of CEG and CPG is built. Based on the model,it illustrates the spatial equilibrium process of regional development by the transi-tion of equilibrium location and the conversion of regional potential energy difference,and reveals how the internal and external factors affect the process. Therefore,the authors advance a \"multistage inverted-U-curve evolution law\" of regional gap. Finally,it analyses the mechanism of the periodic variation of regional gap in China since 1952,and brings up a discussion of the path to coordinating the regional development of China.",

The catalytic activity of P-W/CeO 2  was dramatically affected by the preparation methods of CeO 2  supports. Results implied that the incorporation of W species could cause the decease of cell parameter and lattice contraction, resulting in inducing the formation of more Ce 3+  and oxygen vacancies over the Cat-A catalyst, leading to the excellent oxidation ability and SCR activity. Furthermore, the Cat-A catalyst possessed the most amount of Lewis acid sites, resulting in the superior catalytic activity. Besides, the larger specific area and the excellent redox ability were responsible for the outstanding SCR performance. In brief, the favorable activity in NH 3  oxidation, as well as NO oxidation, contributed to the excellent catalytic activity. Therefore, the Cat-A catalyst exhibited the best SCR activity and over 90% NO  x   conversion was obtained at 190–450 °C.",

Through adjusting the dosages of acetate species (KOAc, NHOAc, and HOAc), the sizes of well-defined Pd nanocubes are tuned. The reduction of Pd precursors, a first-order reaction, is influenceable by acetate species, and a quantitative relationship between cubic width and apparent reduction rate constant, which has been found to be an effective parameter to describe the growth process of Pd nanocubes, has been uncovered. The effect of apparent reduction rate constant on the growth of Pd nanocubes has been discussed, and the growth kinetics of Pd nanocubes is quantitatively depicted.",

        "abstract": "Ligand-stabilized metal nanoparticles (MNPs) have attracted much attention due to their promising catalytic applications. Fully/partially removing these ligands is critical to realize their proper functions. The traditional ligand-removing approaches (e.g., thermal annealing) focus on the ligand side. Herein, we demonstrate an electrochemical method that pays attention to the MNPs side. By rationally regulating the potential (oxidizing Pt and hydrogen evolution) to construct robust Pt–O or Pt–H covalent bond to displace Pt–ligand coordination bond, the approach could effectively remove almost all kinds of ligands from Pt NPs. For the oxidizing Pt method, up potential u003e 1.3 V and cycling number (n) u003e 20 are preferred to completely remove the ligands. The water-soluble ligands (such as poly(vinylpyrrolidone), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, sodium acetate) can be removed by just one cycle after thoroughly being washed by water to remove the unattached ligands. However, the oil-soluble ligands (such as oleyl...",

        "abstract": "Effective removal of oil spills or organic pollutant oils from water is of global significance for environmental protection. However, traditional techniques usually suffer from the limits of low efficiency and high cost. In this study, sponge-like polyamide 6/organic montmorillonite (PA 6/OMMT) composite absorbents were fabricated through a large-scale solution foaming method. Aqueous sodium carbonate solution was injected into a PA/formic acid solution with well-dispersed nanoclay to generate CO2 and meanwhile initiate the phase separation of PA molecules from the solvent. Both mesopores and macropores existed in the prepared sponges. The effect of OMMT content on the microstructures and adsorption properties was investigated. Upon increasing the OMMT fraction in composite sponges, the pore size decreased and the fraction of mesopore increased. Better adsorption properties were thus obtained. When OMMT nanoplatelets accounted for 10%, the corresponding sponge had an uptake capacity of 12.5-22.1 g g-1 for diverse oils or organic solvents. Moreover, the composite sponges absorbed oils and organic solvents rapidly and reached saturation in 20 s. When it was coated with methyltrichlorosilane (MTS), the static water contact angle on the surface of the sponge increased from 88° to 115°. The selective absorption of oil from an oil/water mixture was improved. A greatly promising approach is provided to make commercial polyamide into highly porous functional materials for the cleanup of large-scale oil spills.",

        "abstract": "Post evaluation of spatial layout planning has been drawn much attention from many scholars and governments.First,the development of post evaluation is reviewed based on the definition of basic concept of post evaluation of spatial layout planning.But,up to now,most study still focuses on the urban planning and land use planning,and few on the other kinds of spatial layout planning,such as regional planning and major function-oriented zone planning.Second,this paper summarizes the former researches on post evaluation from the objection,standard and contents of evaluation.(1)According to the evaluation objects,researches can be divided into three kinds which are result evaluation,process evaluation and overall evaluation.(2)There are many debates on the standard of evaluation,but the index defined in the planning documents,as a basal standard,is still chosen by most of the study.(3)The un-spatial indexes still play the main role in the post evaluation of spatial layout planning evaluation,even though the importance of spatial indexes has already been realized by most scholars.Finally,this paper reflects the development of post evaluation of China's spatial layout planning from the aspects of time arrangement,contents design,and for rational utilization of space and regional resources in different scale.The authors suggest that post evaluation of regional planning and major function-oriented zone planning should be paid more attention in the future.As for the time arrangement,it should be based on the planning system,while the period of evaluation on small-scale planning should be shorter than on big-scale planning.As for the contents design,since the mainly propose of post evaluation of spatial layout planning is to make the suggestions on how to improve the planning,analysis on causes of failure and success of planning should be the research key-point in the future.",

        "title": "Aging-Impaired Filamentous Actin Polymerization Signaling Reduces Alveolar Macrophage Phagocytosis of Bacteria.",
        "abstract": "In elderly patients, bacterial infection often causes severe complications and sepsis. Compared to younger patients, older patients are more susceptible to sepsis caused by respiratory infection. Macrophage (Mϕ) phagocytosis of bacteria plays a critical role in the clearance of pathogens and the initiation of immune responses. It has been suggested that Mϕ exhibit age-related functional alterations, including reduced chemotaxis, phagocytosis, antibacterial defense, and the ability to generate reactive oxygen species. However, the mechanisms behind these changes remain unclear. The present study sought to determine changes in bacterial phagocytosis in aging alveolar Mϕ (AMϕ) and the underlying mechanisms. We show that bacteria initiate cytoskeleton remodeling in AMϕ through interaction with macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO), a bacterial scavenger receptor. This remodeling, in turn, promotes enhanced cell surface expression of MARCO and bacterial phagocytosis. We further demonstrate that Rac1-GTP mediates MARCO signaling and activates actin-related protein-2/3 complex, an F-actin nucleator, thereby inducing F-actin polymerization, filopodia formation, and increased cell surface expression of MARCO, all of which are essential for the execution of bacteria phagocytosis. However, AMϕ isolated from aging mice exhibit suppressed Rac1 mRNA and protein expression, which resulted in decreases in Rac1-GTP levels and actin-related protein-2/3 activation, as well as subsequent attenuation of F-actin polymerization, filopodia formation, and cell surface expression of MARCO. As a result, bacterial phagocytosis in aging AMϕ is decreased. This study highlights a previously unidentified mechanism by which aging impairs Mϕ phagocytosis of bacteria. Targeting these pathways may improve outcomes of bacterial infection in elderly patients.",

In this study, an N-section lotus-rhizome-node-like non-uniform capillary model was for the first time proposed based on the plane Poiseuille flow and capillary pressure equation to investigate the liquid transport in porous fibrous media. Normalized total flow time of the non-uniform capillary was obtained as a function of the height and width ratio between the converging and diverging nodes and their total number. The results indicated that the velocity of liquid transport greatly depended on the number of nodes in a certain liquid transport length. The non-uniform capillaries with frequent alterations between converging and diverging nodes have low liquid transport efficiency. The thick capillary exhibits fast liquid transport efficiency in those capillaries with the same self-similar geometry. The model was verified using polypropylene filament yarns and different liquids. The results agreed ...",

        "title": "High TXNDC5 expression predicts poor prognosis in renal cell carcinoma.",
        "abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common primary kidney cancer in adults, and the identification of biomarkers involved in the pathogenesis and prognosis of ccRCC is crucial for early diagnosis and anticancer treatment. In this study, we demonstrate that thioredoxin domain-containing protein 5 (TXNDC5) expression is markedly upregulated in ccRCC tissues in comparison with adjacent non-cancerous tissues through quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical analyses. Importantly, TXNDC5 expression is negatively correlated with the overall survival of patients. Knockdown of TXNDC5 by siRNAs inhibits the cell growth, migration, and invasion of ccRCC cells as well as sensitizes ccRCC cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, such as Camptothecin and 5-Fluorouracil. Moreover, we used complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray analyses to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of TXNDC5 in the pathogenesis of ccRCC. We demonstrate that knockdown of TXNDC5 affects the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of numerous important genes associated with tumorigenesis. In summary, our findings indicate that TXNDC5 performs an essential function in ccRCC pathogenesis and can serve as a novel prognostic marker of ccRCC.",

        "abstract": "Ordered large-pore (up to 12 nm) and stable mesoporous aluminophosphates (AlPO) have been synthesized by using block copolymer (EO 106 PO 70 EO 106 , Pluronic F127) as a structure-directing agent. The selection of inorganic precursors is based on an “acid–base pair” route. Three acid–base pair, including AlCl 3 /H 3 PO 4 , AlCl 3 /OP(OCH 3 ) 3 and Al(OC 4 H 9 ) 3 /PCl 3 are confirmed to be efficient for the assembly of periodic mesoporous frameworks. Ordered 2-D hexagonal mesoporous aluminophosphates can be obtained by using AlCl 3 /H 3 PO 4 as precursors, while disordered mesoporous aluminophosphates are produced by using AlCl 3 /OP(OCH 3 ) 3 or Al(OC 4 H 9 ) 3 /PCl 3 as precursors. BET surface areas and pore sizes of the products vary from 261 to 115 m 2 /g and from 9.4 to 12 nm, respectively. The solution and solid state 27 Al and 31 P MAS NMR were used to characterize the chemical environment of aluminium and phosphorus before and after the formation of mesostructured AlPO products, which simultaneously allows us to evaluate the efficiency of inorganic–inorganic (I–I) interactions (Al–O–P) of different acid–base pair. Both 27 Al and 31 P MAS NMR results show that among the three acid–base pair, AlCl 3 /H 3 PO 4 pair interacts more readily with each other than the other two pairs [AlCl 3 /OP(OCH 3 ) 3 , Al(OC 4 H 9 ) 3 /PCl 3 ], and tends to form rigid framework before calcination. The detailed structural characterizations reveal that strong I–I interactions (Al–O–P) between inorganic precursors will lead to a final mesoporous material with high structure regularity. This method can also be applied to synthesize iron-incorporated aluminophosphate (FeAlPO) with highly ordered 2-D hexagonal structure. BET surface area and pore size of FeAlPO prepared with Fe/Al=0.1 (molar ratio) are 181 m 2 /g and 8.9 nm, respectively. Electron spin resonance (ESR) and UV–vis spectra were employed to characterize the chemical state of Fe 3+ ion.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we determined the molecular mechanisms whereby forkhead transcription factor Foxo1, a key downstream signaling molecule of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)/insulin actions, regulates Runx2 activity and expression of the mouse osteocalcin gene 2 (Bglap2) in osteoblasts in vitro. We showed that Foxo1 inhibited Runx2-dependent transcriptional activity and osteocalcin mRNA expression and Bglap2 promoter activity in MC-4 preosteoblasts. Co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that Foxo1 physically interacted with Runx2 via its C-terminal region in osteoblasts or when co-expressed in COS-7 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that Foxo1 suppressed Runx2 binding to its cognate site within the Bglap2 promoter. IGF1 and insulin prevented Foxo1 from inhibiting Runx2 activity by promoting Foxo1 phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion. In contrast, a neutralizing anti-IGF1 antibody decreased Runx2 activity and osteocalcin expression in osteoblasts. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that IGF1 increased Runx2 interaction with a chromatin fragment of the proximal Bglap2 promoter in a PI3K/AKT-dependent manner. Conversely, knockdown of Foxo1 increased Runx2 interaction with the promoter. This study establishes that Foxo1 is a novel negative regulator of osteoblast-specific transcription factor Runx2 and modulates IGF1/insulin-dependent regulation of osteocalcin expression in osteoblasts.",

Tuning catalytic selectivity by integrating the second metal to form an alloy has been well demonstrated in the literature. Here we report a method to tune catalytic selectivity in oxidative catalysis on another category of heterogeneous catalysts, transition-metal oxides. By choosing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene as a probe reaction, we demonstrated that doping nonmetallic atoms to the surface lattice of catalyst of a transition-metal oxide can enhance catalytic selectivity through suppression of complete oxidation of the reactant molecules. Catalysts of Co3O4 with doped silicon atoms (Six-Co3O4) maintaining the spinel structure of pure Co3O4 exhibit much higher selectivity for the production of ethylene through ODH of ethane in comparison to pure Co3O4 at 600 °C by 40%. The suppression of activity of surface lattice oxygen atoms was evidenced by th...",

        "abstract": "Regulator of Cullins-1 (ROC1) is a key subunit in the Cullin-RING ligase (CRL) protein complex. Overexpression of ROC1 protein is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis of non-muscle invasive bladder transitional cell carcinoma (NMIBC). This study was designed to assess the effects of ROC1 knockdown in bladder cancer cells and to determine the potential mechanisms involved. A total of 112 bladder cancer tissue specimens were recruited for immunohistochemical analyses of ROC1 overexpression. Bladder cancer cell lines were used to knockdown ROC1 expression using ROC1 siRNA. Our data showed that ROC1 knockdown remarkably inhibited bladder cancer cell growth, arrested cells at the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and induced the p53-dependent cell senescence. Molecularly, G2 arrest was associated with upregulation of p21, p27, cyclin B1, and Cdc2 proteins. ROC1 knockdown induced-senescence functioned through p53/p21 pathway. Knockdown of p21 expression partially rescued ROC1 knockdown-induced growth inhibition in cancer cells. Furthermore, nude mouse xenograft analyses confirmed these in vitro data. In conclusion, data from the current study indicate that ROC1 plays an essential role in bladder cancer progression and could serve as a novel anticancer target for bladder transitional cell carcinoma (BTCC).",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Pursuit of high catalytic selectivity is paramount in the design of catalysts for green chemical processes toward minimizing the production of undesired products. We demonstrated that catalytic selectivity for production of alkene through oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane on transition metal oxides can be promoted through tailoring the surface lattice of the oxide catalyst. Selectivity for production of ethylene through oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane on Co 3 O 4  nanocrystals can be substantially increased by 30% – 35% via temperature-mediated reconstruction of surface lattice of Co 3 O 4 . Co 3 O 4  nanocrystals formed at 800 °C leads to smooth, flat crystal plane with predominantly exposed (111) facet in contrast to high Miller index (311) facet of Co 3 O 4  formed at ≤700 °C, revealed by environmental transmission electron microscopy. Isotope-labelled experiments suggest that the higher catalytic selectivity on the (111) facet results from the lower activity of its surface lattice oxygen atoms. Consistent with these experimental results, DFT calculations suggest low activity of surface lattice oxygen atoms and high activation barriers for adsorption and dissociation of C–H bond on the (111) surface in contrast to (311). Upon the activation of C–H on (311), the stronger binding of ethylene on more active, under-coordinated surface lattice oxygen atoms of (311) forms a robust “deprotonated ethylene glycol”-like intermediate on (311) with a rate-limiting desorption barrier to the formation of ethylene. Compared to (311), the kinetically favorable desorption of bound ethylene species from (111) surface well rationalized the higher selectivity for production of ethylene on (111) than (311). These findings demonstrate that temperature-mediated tailoring of the surface lattice for a transition metal oxide nanocatalyst is a promising approach in pursuing high selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons.",

        "abstract": "Slopes villages refer to villages locating on the slopes of mountains and hills,which are distributed extensively in mountain settlements and constitute an important type of the village settlements in China.The western mountainous areas,which are the main slope village distributed areas,have faced the resources and ecology bottleneck because the long time population growth pressure have made them in recent years the main areas of population movement,and frequent village migrations.With \"the Main Function of the National Planning\" implemented in the \"Twelfth Five-Year Plan on National Economic and Social Development\" period,the above regions will be faced the new opportunities and challenges.The spatial reorganization and the population migration in the slope village distributed mountainous areas will be also influenced.And finally the rural household livelihood and sustainable development in mountainous area will be affected.These two problems have exactly long puzzled the western rural development. Accessing the villages space evolution and the peasant households,using the multi-time remote sensing images(TM,ETM,and Alos at 2.5 m resolution) and topographic maps of different scales(1 ∶ 50000,1 ∶ 100000 and 1 ∶ 250000),the disperse and concentrate characteristics of the two spatial evolutions types of the slope villages were analyzed by using the GIS spatial analysis tools.The concentration is the slope village households'movements from the slope lands down to the smooth lands under the environmental pressure and driven by most of the benefits.One concentration type is its position located on some bigger river valley plains and some main roads are caused by the spatial difference of the slope village'site conditions.Another nearby bigger markets and the advantageous traffic accesses are caused due to infrastructure reconstruction and market mechanism establishment in western mountainous areas.The dispersion is the slope village households'movements up to hills and developing hill slopes for seeking new lands owing to the population pressure.The main reasons for the slope village's dispersion are the complex terrain,the limited land,the self-sufficient production pattern and the traditional life style of peasants.The rural household questionnaires were prepared in Guyuan and Zhaotong as typical area respectively in the Loess Plateau hilly area and the southwestern mountainous area.The rural livelihoods including the farmlands property,the incomes and the main life style and their changes in the process of the village space evolution and the movement of population are analyzed. The conclusion believed that the spatial concentration and the completely moving out of the slope villages are beneficial to the mountainous area development.The spatial concentration of the slope villages may reduce pressures of resources and environment,enrich livelihood property of the rural households,enhance the income of the indigenous inhabitant,and,by advancing life types of the peasants,build a harmonious developing way between human and environment.However,from another angle,the lower bearing capacity of population and economic activities in the mountainous area limits the slope village's expansion in scale.And more,owing to lack of the outer communication,the decentralization also may be the normal process of the slope villages'spatial evolution in mountainous area.At that time,the moderate scale household properties,the diversifying household livelihoods,the comfortable living environment,the slope villages'spatial system coordinated with environment,which should be concerned on sustainable development in the mountainous area.",

        "abstract": "Fe cations dramatically enhance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity when incorporated substitutionally into Ni or Co (oxy)hydroxides, serving as possible OER active sites. Pure Fe (oxy)hydroxides, however, are typically thought to be poor OER catalysts and are not well-understood. Here, we report a systematic investigation of Fe (oxy)hydroxide OER catalysis in alkaline media. At low overpotentials of ∼350 mV, the catalyst dissolution rate is low, the activity is dramatically enhanced by an AuOx/Au substrate, and the geometric OER current density is largely independent of mass loading. At higher overpotentials of ∼450 mV, the dissolution rate is high, the activity is largely independent of substrate choice, and the geometric current density depends linearly on loading. These observations, along with previously reported in situ conductivity measurements, suggest a new model for OER catalysis on Fe (oxy)hydroxide. At low overpotentials, only the first monolayer of the electrolyte-permeable Fe (oxy)hydro...",

        "abstract": "High-yielding benzyl alcohol-to-benzaldehyde (BA-to-BAD) transformation has been achieved over mesoporous crystalline TiO2 at mild conditions under visible-light irradiation with/without molecular oxygen. DFT calculations show that the antibonding π molecular orbitals (MOs) of BA can hybridize with the O2p atomic orbitals (AOs) of TiO2, leading to the appearance of new energy levels located in the band gap where holes can be generated under visible-light irradiation. However, the oxidative product, BAD, is not stable when adsorbed on TiO2 surface. This fact is supposed to prevent BAD from overoxidation by ceasing the hole formation. As a result, the hole generation becomes controllable in this type of photoreaction system, and a so-labeled \"self-adjustable photo-oxidation system\" (denoted as SAPS) can be established. In addition, we also found that lattice oxygen (O L) and Ti atoms within TiO2 frameworks serve as the efficient reservoir for hydrogen and electrons in anaerobic reaction. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "In response to infection, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) are recruited in the infectious sites, and employ three major strategies to fight against the microbes including phagocytosis, degranulation, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are a meshwork of chromatin fibers mixed with granule-derived antimicrobial peptides and enzymes, which trap and kill the bacteria extracellularly. In this study, by using a mouse sepsis model, we identified a novel mechanism by which NETs induce macrophage (Mϕ) pyroptosis, a caspase-1-dependent regulated cell death. We show that NET-derived HMGB1, acting through RAGE and dynamin-dependent signaling, triggers an intra-Mϕ cascade of molecular events including cathepsin B (CatB) release from the ruptured lysosomes, followed by pyroptosome formation and caspase-1 activation, and subsequent Mϕ pyroptosis. The study further demonstrates that Mϕ pyroptosis augments inflammatory responses following sepsis. These findings shed light on the proinflammatory role of NETs in mediating PMN-Mϕ interaction, which therefore influences the progress of inflammation following infection.",

        "title": "Activation of Pregnane X Receptor Sensitizes Mice to Hemorrhagic Shock Induced Liver Injury.",
        "abstract": "Hemorrhagic shock (HS) is a life-threatening condition associated with tissue hypoperfusion, and often leads to injury of multiple organs including the liver. Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a species-specific xenobiotic receptor that regulates the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) such as the cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). Many clinical drugs, including those often prescribed to trauma patients, are known to activate PXR and induce CYP3A. The goal of this study is to determine whether PXR plays a role in the regulation of DMEs in the setting of HS, and whether activation of PXR is beneficial or detrimental to HS-induced hepatic injury. PXR transgenic, knockout, and humanized mice were subject to HS, and the liver injury was assessed histologically and biochemically. The expression and/or activity of PXR and CYP3A were manipulated genetically or pharmacologically in order to determine their effects on HS-induced liver injury. Our results showed that genetic or pharmacological activation of PXR sensitized wild-type and hPXR/CYP3A4 humanized mice to HS-induced hepatic injury, whereas knockout of PXR protected mice from HS-induced liver injury. Mechanistically, the sensitizing effect of PXR activation was accounted for by PXR-responsive induction of CYP3A and increased oxidative stress in the liver. The sensitizing effect of PXR was attenuated by ablation or pharmacological inhibition of CYP3A, treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA), or treatment with a PXR antagonist. CONCLUSIONS: We have uncovered a novel function of PXR in HS-induced hepatic injury. Our results suggest that the unavoidable use of PXR-activating drugs in trauma patients has the potential to exacerbate HS-induced hepatic injury, which can be mitigated by the co-administration of anti-oxidative agents, CYP3A inhibitors, or PXR antagonists.

Thus, we evaluated the connection between proto-oncogenic c-myc and anti-neoplastic hsa-let-7a (let-7a) in RCC cell lines. The levels of c-myc and let-7a in 3 RCC cell lines (769P, Caki-1 and 786O) were measured after transfecting the cells with let-7a mimics or a negative control. The change in c-myc protein level was confirmed by Western blot. The anti-neoplastic function of let-7a was evaluated using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) for proliferation analysis and cell flow cytometry for cell cycle analysis. The changes of downstream targets of c-myc were measured using reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Our results suggest for the first time that let-7a acts as a tumor suppressor in RCC cell lines by down-regulating c-myc and c-myc target genes such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclin D1 (CCND1) and the miR17-92 cluster, which is accompanied by proliferation inhibition and cell cycle arrest.",

        "abstract": "Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is a critical transcription factor for bone remodeling; however, its role in bone angiogenesis has not been established. Here we show that ablation of the Atf4 gene expression in mice severely impaired skeletal vasculature and reduced microvascular density of the bone associated with dramatically decreased expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in osteoblasts located on bone surfaces. Results from in vivo studies revealed that hypoxia/reoxygenation induction of HIF-1α and VEGF expression leading to bone angiogenesis, a key adaptive response to hypoxic conditions, was severely compromised in mice lacking the Atf4 gene. Loss of ATF4 completely prevented endothelial sprouting from embryonic metatarsals, which was restored by addition of recombinant human VEGF protein. In vitro studies revealed that ATF4 promotion of HIF-1α and VEGF expression in osteoblasts was highly dependent upon the presence of hypoxia. ATF4 interacted with HIF-1α in hypoxic osteoblasts, and loss of ATF4 increased HIF-1α ubiquitination and reduced its protein stability without affecting HIF-1α mRNA stability and protein translation. Loss of ATF4 increased the binding of HIF-1α to prolyl hydroxylases, the enzymes that hydroxylate HIF-1a protein and promote its proteasomal degradation via the pVHL pathway. Furthermore, parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), both well-known activators of osteoclasts, increased release of VEGF from the bone matrix and promoted angiogenesis through the protein kinase C- and ATF4-dependent activation of osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Thus, ATF4 is a new key regulator of the HIF/VEGF axis in osteoblasts in response to hypoxia and of VEGF release from bone matrix, two critical steps for bone angiogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Our recent study has shown that acute fasting produces antidepressant-like effects in male mice. However, there is little evidence regarding the antidepressant-like effects of acute fasting in female mice. Moreover, it is not yet clear whether estrogen produces additive effects with acute fasting. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the antidepressant-like effects of acute fasting plus estrogen treatment. In this study, the acute fasting produced antidepressant-like effects in female mice and the antidepressant-like effects of 9 hours fasting with those of β-estradiol (E2) were additive. Activity of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB)-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HP) was increased, as well as neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. Serum ghrelin and estrogen were also increased by fasting plus E2. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis indicated that fasting and E2 co-regulate similar gene expression pathways, underlying similar neurological functions. Taken together, these data suggest that E2 produces additive antidepressant-like effects with fasting by activating the CREB-BDNF pathway in the PFC and HP. Genome-wide transcriptome mapping suggests that fasting may be used as an adjunct to estrogen replacement therapy for the treatment of depression associated with reduced estrogen function.",

In this paper, we demonstrate that the charge of Au-adsorbed oxygen as well as the length of the O–O bond provides a useful descriptor for predicting effective catalysts for glycerol oxidation under base-free conditions. ZnO was theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed to be the most effective support for Au to activate molecular oxygen and thus to catalyze aerobic oxidation of glycerol. Kinetic studies as well as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra indicate that the as-generated O2− species on the surface of Au/ZnO could selectively abstract protons from the central hydroxyl group of glycerol to form dihydroxyacetone (DHA), resulting in a selectivity to DHA of up to 85%.",

        "abstract": "Employing DEA model and Malmquist productivity index, this paper probes into the urban efficiencies of 24 typical resources-based cities in China and their changes from 2000 to 2008. The research finds that the overall efficiencies of the resources-based cities are just at a general level, and only a few of them reach the optimal level. The scale efficiency is the major determining factor of the achievement of overall efficiency, the effect of which, never-theless, is reducing. From the perspective of classification characteristics, the re-sources-based cities in northeastern region have been in the front rank in terms of overall efficiency, pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency. There is a certain positive correlation between urban population scale and urban efficiency. The analysis of urban efficiency changes shows that the changes in overall efficiency of resources-based cities from 2000 to 2008 had a weak improving tendency. Both the technical change index and productivity change index decreased, indicating that the urban efficiency did not improve during this pe-riod, and the tendency of technical recession and productivity decline was obvious. In terms of the classification of urban efficiency changes, the urban overall efficiency improved in each of the four regions from 2000 to 2008, among which western region witnessed the greatest increase. Cities with different resource types have improved their urban overall efficiencies except steel-based cities. The urban overall efficiency increased in resources-based cities of different scales, with greater improvement in small and medium-sized cities than in big cities.",

        "abstract": "The \"Eleventh Five-year Plan\" divides national functional zones into the basic unit of county administrative division,which is called major function oriented zoning(MFOZ).According to general disposition of national MFOZ,central and provincial governments are implementing MFOZ strategy in the unit of county administrative division.After prefectural and county level governments have implemented national MFOZ,the spatial development sequence should be specified,the development intensity should be limited,oriented zones should be designated and the \"red line\" areas of spatial governance should be made definite.In the view of the above,choosing a typical county area and exploring its functional oriented zoning,its major function will play a big role in the national's spatial planning in \"the Twelfth Five-year Period\",and it will provide experience to study the functional oriented zoning which is the theme of MFOZ for the present academic circles. The paper takes Shangyu as an example to study general principles,the train of thought and index system of county area functional oriented zoning.The oriented function zones of Shangyu should follow five principles,which are general principles of development-optimized county area:(1) area extropism;(2) based on population and industry spatial combined pattern;(3) spatial rational regulation and control,and intensive usage of land resources;(4) ecological preservation and construction of areas' integrality;(5) areas relatively concentrated and give consideration to town administrative units.Oriented function zones are classified into two levels: the first level is fundamental zones to make clear next level's development,as well as to adjust and restrict areas' development limits.The basic unit is town and the final result covers the whole county areas.The second level is zones to implement regional policies.The basic unit is natural landscape or plot,and the result does not cover the whole areas. This paper evaluates land development suitability and analyses the spatial distribution of major natural and human factors.On this basis,it estimates the rational value of Shangyu′s land development intensity according to the arrangment of national MFOZ.Furthermore this paper suggests a functional oriented zoning plan with 2 levels and 4 types.According to land development suitability evaluation of state technological and economic seedtime,the reasonable value of Shangyu′s land development intensity should not exceed 13%.",

        "abstract": "The functionalization of organic ligands on nanoparticles (NPs) to create metal–organic interfaces can tune their activity and selectivity in catalytic reactions. Compared to the well-documented electronic and steric contribution of organic ligands, the coverage of ligands is also a significant factor but has been rarely investigated. Herein, we employ two methods, potential cycling and thermal annealing, to judiciously remove surface ligands from gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and systematically investigate the influence of surface coverage of ligands on the catalytic performance. Potential cycling enables mild removal of ligands without changing the size of AuNPs and thus provides ideal models to identify the intrinsic influence of the surface coverage of ligands on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The ORR activity and selectivity is quantitatively evaluated by plotting the half potential and electron transfer number versus the surface coverage of ligands. Thermal annealing at different temperatures produces differently sized AuNPs with various surface ligand coverages. Compared to the size effect, we found that the surface coverage of ligands played a dominant role in the ORR activity of AuNPs. Most importantly, capping AuNPs with oleylamine and sodium citrate and reverse poisoning clean AuNPs with thiol, butylamine and CTAB further reveal that the difference in the ORR activity/selectivity of the capped AuNPs is directly related to the surface coverage of the ligands regardless of the diverse chemical nature of these ligands. This work highlights that the surface coverage of ligands should be considered as an important factor for catalytic reactions accounting for metal–organic interfaces.",

        "abstract": "Heterostructural engineering and three-dimensional architecture construction are effective strategies to optimize the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors. Herein, we integrate these two strategies and controllably synthesize ZnO-BiOI heterostructures with well-defined architectures. Microstructural and surface analysis reveals that the strong electronic interaction between ZnO and Bi ensures a bounded nucleation and growth of BiOI on the surface of ZnO, which leads to the formation of ZnO-BiOI nanorod heterostructures (ZnO-BiOI-NR) with very high dispersion of BiOI on ZnO nanorods. In contrast, when the nucleation and growth of BiOI occurs before reacting with ZnO nanorods, ZnO-BiOI heterostructures (ZnO-BiOI-NF) are composed of BiOI nanoflowers (NFs) and ZnO nanorods. The precise control over the interfaces of ZnO-BiOI heterostructures provides ideal models to investigate the influence of the interfaces on the catalytic performance of heterostructures. It is important to highlight that the photocatalytic activity of ZnO-BiOI-NR is 12 times higher than that of ZnO-BiOI-NF. Mechanism studies suggest that the abundant ZnO-BiOI interfaces in ZnO-BiOI-NR benefit the generation and separation of hole-electron pairs, which consequently improve the catalytic performance.",

        "abstract": "Corticosterone plays an important role in feeding behavior. However, its mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of corticosterone on feeding behavior. In this study, cumulative food intake was increased by acute corticosterone administration in a dose-dependent manner. Administration of the 5-HT receptor agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazin (mCPP) reversed the effect of corticosterone on food intake. The anorectic effects of mCPP were also blocked by the 5-HT receptor antagonist RS102221 in corticosterone-treated mice. Both corticosterone and mCPP increased c-Fos expression in hypothalamic nuclei, but not the nucleus of the solitary tract. RS102221 inhibited c-Fos expression induced by mCPP, but not corticosterone. In addition, mCPP had little effect on TH and POMC levels in the hypothalamus. Furthermore, mCPP antagonized decreasing effect of the leptin produced by corticosterone. Taken together, our findings suggest that 5-HT receptors and leptin may be involved in the effects of corticosterone-induced hyperphagia.",

The catalytic oxidation is a green-chemistry compatible process with atmospheric O2 as the oxidant at ambient pressure. The high catalytic activity of Pt/Bi2O3−x is ascribed to the synergistic effect between Pt0 and nearby partially reduced Bi2O3−x species. Pt0 acts as a site to cleave the α-C–H bond of alcohols while Bi2O3−x could facilitate the activation of oxygen.",

The average particle size of the entrapped AuNPs after 550 C calcination approaches 25.6 ± 5.2 nm at the gold loading amount of 5.0 wt %, but it greatly reduces into only 5.6 ± 1.2 nm as the metal loading reaches up to 26.1 wt %. It is demonstrated that the unique three-dimensional porous structure of EP-FDU-12 makes particle-migration difficult to occur and thus prevents direct particle-particle aggregation. This further allows two or more AuNPs to be encapsulated in every extra-large cage at high particle concentrations (10-35 wt %), which enables interparticle interactions via significant overlapping of the diffusion-spheres of AuNPs. As a result, atom-migration via vapor from cage to cage is largely shut off and local vapor-particle equilibrium within each cage is possible, leading to a successful stable AuNPs/mesoporous silica system. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",

Under stress conditions, HPCs migrate from BM and egress into circulation to participate in immune response, wound repair, or tissue regeneration. Hemorrhagic shock with resuscitation (HS/R), resulting from severe trauma and major surgery, promotes HPC mobilization from BM, which, in turn, affects post-HS immune responses. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of HS/R regulation of HPC mobilization from BM. Using a mouse HS/R model, we demonstrate that the endogenous alarmin molecule high-mobility group box 1 mediates HS/R-induced granulocyte colony-stimulating factor secretion from macrophages (Mϕ in a RAGE [receptor for advanced glycation end products] signaling-dependent manner. Secreted granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, in turn, induces HPC egress from BM. We also show that activation of β-adrenergic receptors on Mϕ by catecholamine mediates the HS/R-induced release of high-mobility group box 1. These data indicate that HS/R, a global ischemia-reperfusion stimulus, regulates HPC mobilization through a series of interacting pathways that include neuroendocrine and innate immune systems, in which Mϕ play a central role.",

Inflammasome activation involves formation and oligomerization of a protein complex including a NOD-like receptor (NLR), an adaptor protein (ASC) and procaspase-1. This then allows cleavage and activation of caspase-1, followed by downstream cleavage and release of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and IL-18, from innate immune cells. Hyperinflammation caused by unrestrained inflammasome activation is linked with multiple inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. So there is an understandable rush to understand mechanisms that regulate such potent inflammatory pathways. Autophagy has now been identified as a main regulator of inflammasomes. Autophagy is a vital intracellular process involved in cellular homeostasis, recycling and removal of damaged organelles (e.g. mitochondria) and intracellular pathogens. Autophagy is regulated by proteins that are important in endosomal/phagosomal pathways, as well as by specific autophagy proteins coded for by autophagy-related genes. Cytosolic components are surrounded and contained by a double-membraned vesicle, which then fuses with lysosomes to enable degradation of the contents. Autophagic removal of intracellular DAMPs, inflammasome components or cytokines can reduce inflammasome activation. Similarly, inflammasomes can regulate the autophagic process, allowing for a two-way, mutual regulation of inflammation that may hold the key for treatment of multiple diseases.",

In this work, a porous polyamide 6 (PA6) material was prepared by a facile solution foaming strategy. In this approach, a sodium carbonate (SC) aqueous solution acted as the foaming agent that reacted with formic acid (FA), generating CO₂ and causing phase separation of polyamide (PA). The influence of the PA/FA solution concentration and Na₂CO₃ concentration on the microstructures and physical properties of prepared PA foams were investigated, respectively. PA foams showed a hierarchical porous structure along the foaming direction. The mean pore dimension ranged from hundreds of nanometers to several microns. Low amounts of sodium salt generated from a neutralization reaction played an important role of heterogeneous nucleation, which increased the crystalline degree of PA foams. The porous PA materials exhibited low thermal conductivity, high crystallinity and good mechanical properties. The novel strategy in this work could produce PA foams on a large scale for potential engineering applications.",

        "abstract": " Previous studies have indicated the resting-state default mode network (DMN) related connectivity serving as predictor of sustained attention performance in healthy people. Interestingly, sustained attention deficits as well as DMN-involved functional connectivity (FC) alterations are common in both patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Thus, the present study was designed to investigate whether the DMN related resting-state connectivity alterations in these two psychiatric disorders were neural correlates of their sustained attention impairments.  The study included 17 SCZ patients, 35 OCD patients and 36 healthy controls (HCs). Sustained attention to response task was adopted to assess the sustained attention. Resting-state scan was administrated and seed-based whole-brain FC analyses were performed with seeds located in classical DMN regions including bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC).  Both SCZ and OCD patients had poorer sustained attention than HCs. Sustained attention deficits in OCD was negatively correlated with their impaired FC of right mPFC-left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) within DMN, and that in SCZ was significantly correlated with their altered FC of left mPFC-bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) which indicated interaction between DMN and salience network. In addition, the FC between left mPFC and right parietal lobe indicating the interaction between DMN and frontal-parietal network was correlated with sustained attention in both SCZ and OCD.  These findings suggest the importance of DMN-involved connectivity, both within and between networks in underlying sustained attention deficits in OCD and SCZ. Results further support the potential of resting-state FC in complementing information for cognitive deficits in psychiatric disorders.",

        "abstract": "Monocytes are critical effector cells of the innate immune system that protect the host by migrating to inflammatory sites, differentiating to macrophages and dendritic cells, eliciting immune responses, and killing pathogenic microbes. MCP-1, also known as CCL2, plays an important role in monocyte activation and migration. The chemotactic function of MCP-1 is mediated by binding to the CCR2 receptor, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Desensitization of GPCR chemokine receptors is an important regulator of the intensity and duration of chemokine stimulation. GPCR kinases (GRKs) induce GPCR phosphorylation, and this leads to GPCR desensitization. Regulation of subcellular localization of GRKs is considered an important early regulatory mechanism of GRK function and subsequent GPCR desensitization. Chemokines and LPS are both present during Gram-negative bacterial infection, and LPS often synergistically exaggerates leukocyte migration in response to chemokines. In this study, we investigated the role and mechanism of LPS-TLR4 signaling on the regulation of monocyte chemotaxis. We demonstrate that LPS augments MCP-1-induced monocyte migration. We also show that LPS, through p38 MAPK signaling, induces phosphorylation of GRK2 at serine 670, which, in turn, suppresses GRK2 translocation to the membrane, thereby preventing GRK2-initiated internalization and desensitization of CCR2 in response to MCP-1. This results in enhanced monocyte migration. These findings reveal a novel function for TLR4 signaling in promoting innate immune cell migration.",

Their ordered mesostructures were characterized by X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen sorption analysis. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopy (IR) results show that ST-SBA-16 products have large numbers of silanol groups. The mesoscopic ordering of ST-SBA-16 can be greatly improved by the addition of suitable amount of co-surfactants, such as 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB). The effects of the synthesis parameters on the structure properties of ST-SBA-16 have also been systematically investigated. It is shown that the total pore volume can be enlarged from 0.31 to 0.51 cm 3 g −1 by the addition of TMB, pore diameter can be augmented from 2.6 to 4.0 nm by increasing the synthesis temperature from 5 to 40 °C and the surface area can be effectively tailored by changing the hydrothermal treatment time and the calcination temperature.",

        "abstract": "Although the chemical diversity of ordered composite mesoporous materials has been expanding during the past decade, progress has been limited by the need for a general synthetic approach that is predictive and makes use of well developed fundamental chemical principles. Researchers have previously used the interaction of organic-inorganic (OI) species that are present during the nucleation of the composite phase, and several synthesis pathways, such as direct surfactant-inorganic interaction (S+I-, S-I+, S0I0) and mediated interaction (S+X-I+, S-X+I-), have been proposed. Here we describe a new perspective in which the self-adjusted inorganic-inorganic (II) interplay between two or more inorganic precursors is guided by acid-base chemistry considerations, and in this simple way we produce an overall 'framework' for the sophisticated combination of synergic inorganic acid-base precursor pairs. We propose several new routes and demonstrate their versatility and validity through the successful syntheses of a wide variety of highly ordered, large-pore, homogeneous, stable and multicomponent mesostructured minerals, including metal phosphates and metal borates, as well as various metal oxides and mixed metal oxides. We show that the highly ordered mesostructured metal phosphates can be moulded into morphologies of choice, and that they show interesting physicochemical properties.",

        "abstract": "The discovery and design of highly selective, active and stable mesoporous metal oxide catalysts is of vital importance in many applications such as the large-scale production of bulk chemicals, environmental protection, and the generation/distribution of sustainable energy. In this review, we'll discuss our recent research oriented toward the rational synthesis of mesoporous metal oxides (MMOs). The high-degree control over different compositional/structural parameters of MMOs provides a useful material candidate platform to further study their structure-property relationship for the design of better catalyst for a specific reaction. We also introduce a new methodology for the discovery of new catalysts using ink-jet printing (IJP) technology. A general and simple formulation of inorganic inks based on a colloidal, monodispersed in size, nanoparticle system is used for IJP syntheses that enable rapid access to large catalyst libraries (~1,000,000 formulations/hour). In addition, a group testing strategy is used to reduce the number of tests 1600-fold over exhaustive one-by-one searching. This printer approach is extremely efficient and can help accelerate the identification of optimal catalysts.",

Sponge-like architectured macroporous oxides (silica, titania) have been firstly synthesized by using low-cost commercial egg white protein as the template. The pore size of the three dimensional macroporous materials can be tuned from 50 to 400 nm by adding different surfactant. The morphology and the channel of the macroporous materials can also be controlled by the surfactant. The formation of macroporous material is resulted from the phase separation between the protein and inorganic sol.",

        "abstract": "Major function oriented zoning (MFOZ hereafter) is the guideline for optimizing the spatial pattern of regional development in China, which entails both theoretical and methodological innovation in the academic field of economic geography. This study analyzes the basic features of territorial function and puts forward a spatially equilibrium model for regional development. It argues that there exists a trend of regional convergence in almost any indicator measuring the average level of regional development status. Based on this finding, the study illustrates that the formation of functional zone should be conducive to the reduction of regional inequality and that free flow of resources across region is the prerequisite to spatial equilibrium. It also investigates the impact of territorial functional evolution on spatial processes of equilibrium and suggests that the benefit to be derived from zoning proposal is contingent upon the method of regional division and correct understanding of temporal change of territorial function. After that, this study goes to examine the scientific foundation of several issues concerning the reconciliation of contradictory functions of development and protection, the selection of indicators and the spatial and temporal features of MFOZ. It is then followed by an interrogation of the rationality of achieving dual goals of efficiency and equality simultaneously through three-dimensional flow and spatial equilibrium. The paper ends with a discussion of the position, implementation and coordination of MFOZ from the perspective of institutional arrangements of spatial governance including law, planning and government policy.",

        "abstract": "Galactinol synthases (GolSs) are the key enzymes that participate in raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFO) biosynthesis, which perform a big role in modulating plant growth and response to biotic or abiotic stresses. To date, no systematic study of this gene family has been conducted in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). Here, eight MeGolS genes are isolated from the cassava genome. Based on phylogenetic background, the MeGolSs are clustered into four groups. Through predicting the cis-elements in their promoters, it was discovered that all MeGolS members act as hormone-, stress-, and tissue-specific related elements to different degrees. MeGolS genes exhibit incongruous expression patterns in various tissues, indicating that different MeGolS proteins might have diverse functions. MeGolS1 and MeGolS3–6 are highly expressed in leaves and midveins. MeGolS3–6 are highly expressed in fibrous roots. Quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis indicates that several MeGolSs, including MeGolS1, 2, 5, 6, and 7, are induced by abiotic stresses. microRNA prediction analysis indicates that several abiotic stress-related miRNAs target the MeGolS genes, such as mes-miR156, 159, and 169, which also respond to abiotic stresses. The current study is the first systematic research of GolS genes in cassava, and the results of this study provide a basis for further exploration the functional mechanism of GolS genes in cassava.",

        "abstract": "The signals that control skeletogenesis are incompletely understood. Here we show that deleting Kindlin-2 in Prx1-expressing mesenchymal progenitors in mice causes neonatal lethality, chondrodysplasia and loss of the skull vault. Kindlin-2 ablation reduces chondrocyte density by decreasing cell proliferation and increasing apoptosis, and disrupts column formation, thus impairing the formation of the primary ossification center and causing severe limb shortening. Remarkably, Kindlin-2 localizes to not only focal adhesions, but also to the nuclei of chondrocytes. Loss of Kindlin-2 reduces, while the overexpression of Kindlin-2 increases, Sox9 expression. Furthermore, the overexpression of Sox9 restores the defects in chondrogenic differentiation induced by Kindlin-2 deletion in vitro. In addition, Kindlin-2 ablation inhibits TGF-β1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation and chondrocyte differentiation. Finally, deleting Kindlin-2 in chondrocytes directly impairs chondrocyte functions, resulting in progressive dwarfism and kyphosis in mice. These studies uncover a previously unrecognized function for Kindlin-2 and a mechanism for regulation of the chondrocyte differentiation programme and chondrogenesis. In vertebrates, the skeleton not only confers morphology, but also provides essential functions of life, including control of movements and protection of vital organs. During embryonic development, the skeleton is formed from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through two distinct mechanisms—intramembranous and endochondral ossification. In intramembranous ossification, which forms flat bones, including the skull vault and part of the clavicle, MSCs condense and differentiate into osteoprogenitors, and later, osteoblasts1. In endochondral ossification, which forms most of the other bones, including all long bones and vertebrae, an intermediate cartilaginous template is first formed through a process that involves MSC condensation, chondrocyte proliferation, hypertrophy and apoptosis; this is followed by replacement by bone in the adjacent metaphysis through multiple steps, including new blood vessel invasion, osteoclast differentiation and digestion of the calcified cartilage and osteoblastogenesis from the perichondrial cells and bone formation2. Endochondral ossification contributes to the longitudinal growth of the skeleton. A better understanding of molecular mechanisms controlling skeletogenesis and homeostasis is critical for the development of new strategies to treat major skeletal diseases, such as osteoarthritis. During skeletal development and homeostasis, chondrocyte differentiation is tightly controlled by key transcription factors, as well as distinct signalling pathways. Sox9, a transcription factor of the sex-determining region Y (SRY)-related high mobility group box family of proteins, is essential for converting MSCs into chondrocytes and regulates multiple functions of chondrocytes, such as proliferation, survival, differentiation and hypertrophy3, 4, 5, 6. Sox9 controls chondrocyte differentiation by directly activating chondrogenic gene expression (for example, type II collagen or Col2a1)7, 8 and through indirect upregulation of Sox5 and Sox6 (ref. 3), both key transcription factors that regulate chondrocyte differentiation9. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signalling is a fundamental route that controls multiple properties of chondrocytes and skeletal development and homeostasis10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. While the importance of Sox9 and TGF-β signalling in the chondrocyte differentiation programme is well documented in the literature, the mechanism of their modulation during this process is poorly understood. During skeletal development and homeostasis, bone cells or their precursors must migrate to appropriate locations and communicate with their extracellular matrix to form distinct elements of the skeleton. Kindlins are a family of evolutionarily conserved cytoplasmic proteins that are emerging as key regulators of integrin-mediated cell–extracellular matrix adhesion, migration and signalling19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. In mammals, the Kindlin family consists of three members, Kindlin-1, -2 and -3, each of which contains a FERM (F for 4.1 protein, E for ezrin, R for radixin and M for moesin) domain that is responsible for interacting with β-integrin cytoplasmic tails. Mutations in the KINDLIN-1 gene lead to the Kindler syndrome in humans, which is characterized by skin blistering27, 28. Mutations in the KINDLIN-3 gene impair integrin activation in humans and result in leukocyte adhesion deficiency-III, severe bleeding, frequent infections and osteopetrosis29, 30, 31, 32. Global inactivation of Kindlin-2 in mice resulted in early embryonic lethality at E7.5 (ref. 33). Because of this finding, and because there are no human genetic diseases known to be linked to mutations in the KINDLIN-2 gene, functions of Kindlin-2 in regulating the development and homeostasis of specific organs and tissues are largely unknown. To determine the roles of Kindlin-2 during skeletogenesis, we use a conditional knockout strategy to selectively ablate Kindlin-2 expression in two distinct skeletogenic cells at different stages of skeletal development in mice. We perform comprehensive analyses of two mouse models in which Kindlin-2 is ablated in limb and head mesenchymal progenitor cells or chondrocytes. We demonstrate that conditional ablation of Kindlin-2 in Prx1-expressing limb and head mesenchymal progenitors in mice results in neonatal lethality, severe chondrodysplasia and complete loss of the skull vault. Loss of Kindlin-2 inhibits chondrocyte proliferation, increases chondrocyte apoptosis and disrupts the column formation, which together impairs formation of the primary ossification centre (POC) of the long bones and results in limb and digit shortening. Thus, Kindlin-2 expression in mesenchymal progenitors is critical for endochondral ossification. Kindlin-2 expression is also required for control of intramembranous ossification, as demonstrated by a complete loss of the skull vault and severe hypoplastic clavicles in the mutant mice. Of particular significance, we find that Kindlin-2 localizes to not only focal adhesions, but also to the nuclei of chondrocytes where it activates Sox9 expression, a master regulator of chondrogenesis. Overexpression of Sox9 restores the defects in chondrogenic differentiation induced by Kindlin-2 deletion in vitro. We further demonstrate that Kindlin-2 ablation inhibits TGF-β1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation and chondrocyte differentiation. Finally, deleting Kindlin-2 in chondrocytes directly impairs chondrocyte functions, resulting in progressive dwarfism and kyphosis and osteopenic phenotype in mice. Collectively, our results shed important new light on the functions of Kindlin-2 and its mode of action in skeletogenesis. To investigate the potential roles of Kindlin-2 in the regulation of skeletogenesis, we used Cre-Lox technology to conditionally delete Kindlin-2 expression in limb and head mesenchyme. Kindlin-2fl/fl mice, in which exons 5 and 6 of Kindlin-2 gene are flanked by loxP sites, were generated as described in Methods (Supplementary Fig. 1). Crossing the Prx1-Cre transgenic mice34 with the Kindlin-2fl/fl mice generated Prx1-Cre; Kindlin-2fl/+mice. Further cross-breeding of the Kindlin-2fl/fl mice with Prx1-Cre; Kindlin-2fl/+mice successfully produced Prx1-Cre; Kindlin-2fl/fl mice, the limb and head mesenchyme conditional KO mice (referred to as Kindlin-2Prx1cKO hereafter). Prx1-Cre mice, in which the 2.4-kb Prx1 (paired-related homeobox gene-1) gene promoter drives Cre expression in limb and head mesenchyme, have been widely used34. In these mice, Cre expression first appears at E9.5 in the forelimb mesenchyme and E10.5 in the hindlimb bud. These mice also express high levels of Cre protein in the head mesenchyme34. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) and western blot analyses revealed that Kindlin-2 expression was dramatically reduced at both the mRNA and protein levels in Kindlin-2Prx1cKO limbs, compared with those of Cre-negative Kindlin-2fl/fl limbs (referred to as WT hereafter; Fig. 1a,b). Notably, loss of Kindlin-2 did not significantly alter the levels of Kindlin-1 and Kindlin-3 proteins in limbs (Supplementary Fig. 2). Immunohistochemical staining of humeral sections of the two genotypes showed high Kindlin-2 expression in WT chondrocytes, which was strikingly reduced in mutant chondrocytes (Fig. 1c). It is interesting to note that although Kindlin-2 is known as a cytoplasmic protein located at focal adhesion sites, it was strongly detected in the nuclei of chondrocytes (Fig. 1c). Strikingly, all mutant mice (>50) died immediately after birth. As shown in Fig. 1d, all mutants (>100) displayed a haematoma on top of the head, which grew larger over time. Alcian blue and alizarin red double staining of whole-mount skeletons revealed that, although both bone and cartilage were present, all mutants exhibited multiple striking skeletal defects (Fig. 1d–g and Supplementary Fig. 3), including: (1) severe forelimb and hindlimb shortening; (2) impaired digit elongation; (3) shortened, broadened and fused sterna; (4) complete loss of the skull vault, which may have contributed to the neonatal lethality due to lack of protection of brain tissue from damage during birth; and (5) severe hypoplasia of the clavicle, a defect observed in Runx2 haploinsufficiency in mice and the human disorder cleidocranial dysplasia35, 36. Defects (1)–(3) suggest that Kindlin-2 is essential for endochondral ossification and defects (4) and (5) demonstrate that Kindlin-2 is critically involved in the regulation of intramembranous ossification, which forms the skull vault and part of the clavicle. Quantitative analyses revealed that the length of all the long bones (femur, tibia, humerus, radius and ulna) and their respective bony portions  stained red by alizarin red were significantly reduced in mutants (P<0.05, Student’s t-test; Fig. 1g). It should be noted that, although there were striking skeletal phenotypes, the overall body size of the mutants was not markedly different from that of the WT (Fig. 1d). The Kindlin-2 flox heterozygotes that harbour Prx1-Cre (that is, Prx1-Cre; Kindlin-2fl/+) were viable and fertile and did not show any marked skeletal phenotypes (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Fig. 1b,c). In mice, limb mesenchymal condensation occurs at around E11.5–E12.5 (ref. 37). After condensation, the majority of mesenchymal progenitor cells become chondrocytes that go into the proliferation and differentiation programme37. As shown in Fig. 2a, at E14.5, chondrocytes in the centre of the cartilage mould of the WT humerus enlarged and formed a highly organized hypertrophic zone, which was not observed in the mutant. By E16.5, a POC was formed in the middle of WT, but not mutant, humeri (Fig. 2a). At E18.5, the POC was partially formed in the mutant (Fig. 2a). At birth (P0), a significantly shorter POC was formed in the mutant (Fig. 2a,d). Loss of Kindlin-2 similarly delayed formation of ossification centres in digits (Fig. 2f). One major cellular defect in the mutant growth plate was a dramatic reduction of chondrocyte density starting at E14.5 and worsening over time (Fig. 2b,e and Supplementary Fig. 4). Furthermore, loss of Kindlin-2 greatly impacted chondrocyte size, morphology and organization in the growth plate. As shown in Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4, in the proliferative zone of the WT humeral growth plate, chondrocytes were discoid and arranged into regular columns, like stacks of coins, which were parallel to the long axis of the cartilage. In contrast, mutant chondrocytes were large and spherical, and failed to form columns (Fig. 2b,c). Instead of forming the highly organized hypertrophic zone in the middle of long bones, as found in the WT, the large spherical mutant chondrocytes were scattered throughout the growth plate (Fig. 2b). As shown in Fig. 3a, at E12.5, mesenchymal condensation occurred normally and cell density was not reduced in the mutant limb buds. Results from in vivo BrdU (5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine) labelling experiments revealed that the chondrocyte proliferation rate was significantly reduced in the E14.5 mutant relative to WT growth plates (Fig. 3b,c). Indian hedgehog (Ihh) is known to play a critical role in the regulation of chondrocyte proliferation38, 39, 40, 41. In situ hybridization of E14.5 humeral sections showed that Ihh mRNA expression was detected in pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes in WT growth plates, but was markedly reduced in mutant cells (Fig. 3d). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining of E14.5 humeral sections of the two genotypes demonstrated that chondrocyte apoptosis in the proliferative zone was dramatically increased in mutant growth plates (Fig. 3e,f). At E16.5, the apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes was also greatly increased in the mutants (Fig. 3e,f). Note that basal apoptosis levels were increased in E16.5 compared to E14.5 chondrocytes in both genotypes. Consistent with increased cell apoptosis, cleaved (active) caspase-3 was upregulated in mutant chondrocytes compared with that of WT cells (Fig. 3g). Thus, reduced cell proliferation capacity and accelerated cell death could be two major reasons for the reduction of chondrocytes in mutant growth plates. In situ hybridization showed that the mRNA level of Sox9, a master regulator of chondrogenesis, was reduced in mutant humeri and digits compared with that of WT (Fig. 4a,b). Western blot analysis confirmed that Sox9 was reduced at the protein level in mutant limbs (Fig. 4c). qPCR analysis showed that the loss of Kindlin-2 reduced Sox9 and its downstream target Col2a1 mRNA expression without affecting the expression of mRNA for cadherin, a molecule required for mesenchymal chondrogenic condensation10 (Fig. 4d). In contrast, the adenoviral overexpression of Kindlin-2 in ATDC5 chondrogenic cells increased the levels of Sox9 protein (Fig. 4e) and mRNA (Fig. 4f) and activated 2.8-kb mouse Sox9 gene promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4g). Interestingly, although Kindlin-2 is widely recognized as a cytoplasmic protein, it was strongly detected in the nuclei of primary ribcage chondrocytes, as measured by immunofluorescence staining followed by confocal analysis (Fig. 4h). Western blot analysis using nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts showed that Kindlin-2 protein existed in the nuclei of ATDC5 cells (Fig. 4i). The adenoviral overexpression of Sox9 largely restored the defects in Col2a1, but not Runx2, mRNA expression (Fig. 4j,k) and chondrogenic nodule formation in micromass cultures (Fig. 4l). TGF-β signalling is critical for skeletal development11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18. We examined whether the loss of Kindlin-2 in limb mesenchymal progenitor cells impairs TGF-β1 signalling. The results showed that Smad2 phosphorylation (pSmad2) was reduced in mutant limbs, compared to that of WT limbs, starting at E12.5 (Fig. 5a). The levels of total Smad2/3 proteins were not altered by the loss of Kindin-2 (Fig. 5a). The expression of β1 integrin and integrin-linked kinase (ILK), both Kindlin-2-interacting proteins19, 20, 33, 42, were not altered in mutant limbs (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, one of the key downstream effectors of integrin signalling, was not significantly altered in E13.5 Kindlin-2Prx1cKO versus WT limbs (Supplementary Fig. 5). Similarly, the levels of phospho-p38 and total p38 proteins, which belong to non-canonical TGF-β signalling43, were not affected by the loss of Kindlin-2 (Fig. 5a). The signal for pSmad2, but not total Smad2/3, was markedly reduced in both chondrocytes and perichondrial mesenchymal progenitors of mutant limbs (Fig. 5b). Notably, loss of Kindlin-2 did not reduce Tgf-β1 mRNA expression in limbs (Fig. 5c). The levels of TGFβ R1 and TGFβ R2 proteins were similar in E13.5 Kindlin-2Prx1cKO versus WT limbs or cells (Supplementary Fig. 6). In vitro studies using primary mesenchymal progenitors from E12.5 limbs revealed that Kindlin-2 ablation (Supplementary Fig. 7) significantly impaired TGF-β1 induction of Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5d,e). The results from limb micromass cultures showed that Kindlin-2 ablation severely impaired TGF-β1-induced chondrogenic nodule formation (Fig. 5f). Furthermore, the loss of Kindlin-2 significantly decreased the TGF-β1-induced expression of Sox9, Col2, Ihh (Indian hedgehog) and Aggrecan without affecting the levels of Opn (osteopontin) and Alp (alkaline phosphatase) mRNAs (Fig. 5g), two osteoblast markers. Finally, β1 integrin activation was significantly reduced in primary limb mesenchymal progenitor cells lacking Kindlin-2 compared with that in WT cells (Fig. 5h). To determine whether Kindlin-2 plays a direct role in chondrocytes, we conditionally, and selectively, deleted Kindlin-2 in chondrocytes by breeding Col2a1-Cre transgenic mice with Kindlin-2fl/fl mice to obtain Col2a1-Cre; Kindlin-2fl/fl mice (referred to as Kindlin-2Col2a1cKO hereafter). Col2a1-Cre transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the mouse Col2a1 gene promoter are widely used to efficiently drive Cre expression in chondrocytes44. Kindlin-2Col2a1 cKO mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequency. Western blot analysis showed that Kindlin-2 was selectively reduced in mutant limbs (Fig. 6a). Immunohistochemical revealed that Kindlin-2 was essentially abolished in mutant chondrocytes (Fig. 6b). Limbs and vertebrae were shorter and the ribcage was smaller in mutant compared with WT mice (Fig. 6c–e). In contrast to Kindlin-2Prx1 cKO, mice lacking Kindlin-2 in chondrocytes did not exhibit any marked abnormalities in skull vault and clavicle (Fig. 6c–e), suggesting that intramembraneous ossification is unchanged in the mutant. Similar to Kindlin-2Prx1 cKO, ablating Kindlin-2 in chondrocytes disrupted column formation in long bones (Fig. 6f). It should be noted that the reduction of chondrocyte density in the long bone growth plate of Kindlin-2Col2a1 cKO was less severe than in Kindlin-2Prx1 cKO (compare Fig. 2b with Fig. 6f). Similar to Kindlin-2Prx1 cKO, deleting Kindlin-2 expression in chondrocytes downregulated Sox9 mRNA without affecting the expression of the adipogenic gene, Ap2 (adipocyte protein 2; Fig. 6g). However, after birth, all Kindlin-2Col2a1 cKO mice (>50) rapidly developed growth retardation and severe dwarfism (Fig. 6h,i). About 80% of the mice developed progressive kyphosis and died within 1 month of birth because of respiratory distress probably associated with compression of cervical and thoracic vertebrae from the kyphosis (Fig. 6i,j). Alcian blue staining of tibial sections showed delayed formation of the secondary ossification centre (Fig. 6k) and reduced subchondral bone (Fig. 6l) in mutants. Quantitative microcomputerized tomography (μCT) analysis of 1-month-old femur histomorphometric parameters showed that mutant mice have dramatic reductions in both trabecular and cortical bones (Fig. 6m-o). Collectively, these experiments establish that Kindlin-2 expression in chondrocytes plays an intrinsic role in the regulation of chondrocyte functions and chondrogenesis during prenatal and postnatal skeletal development. In the study reported here, we demonstrated that Kindlin-2 functions in skeletal development by controlling endonchondral and intramembranous ossification processes. The severe skeletal abnormalities and biochemical defects in chondrocytes and their progenitors induced by the loss of Kindlin-2 suggest that Kindlin-2 serves as a major controlling factor in the regulation of the chondrocyte differentiation programme and chondrogenesis during prenatal and postnatal skeletal development. This study represents the first systematic investigation into the functions of Kindlin-2 in chondrocyte differentiation and chondrogenesis, processes that are of broad clinical importance. The findings of our study can be summarized as follows. First, Kindlin-2 controls chondrocyte proliferation by regulating, at least in part, the expression of Ihh, a key factor for chondrocyte proliferation. Second, Kindlin-2 protects chondrocytes from apoptosis. Loss of Kindlin-2 greatly accelerates apoptosis of both proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocytes. Reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis contribute to reduced cellularity in the growth plates in the mutant mice. Third, loss of Kindlin-2 increases chondrocyte hypertrophy. Finally, Kindlin-2 is essential for chondrocyte column formation. Chondrocytes lacking Kindlin-2 are scattered throughout the growth plates rather than forming regular columns. Interestingly, deleting β1 integrin in chondrocytes in mice similarly disrupted column formation in growth plates45. Reduced chondrocyte numbers and disrupted chondrocyte organization together contribute to decreased longitudinal growth of long bones and digits, resulting in their shortening in mutants. Importantly, we demonstrated that Kindlin-2 plays a critical role in the regulation of TGF-β signalling. The loss of Kindlin-2 reduced Smad2 phosphorylation, a key downstream molecular event of TGF-β signalling in limb chondrocytes in vivo. Of particular significance, TGF-β-induced Smad2 phosphorylation, chondrocyte differentiation gene expression, and chondrogenic nodule formation were all dramatically reduced in primary mesenchymal progenitor cells lacking Kindlin-2. These results clearly demonstrate that Kindlin-2 is crucial to the control of TGF-β signalling during the chondrogenic differentiation programme. Interestingly, while this study was in progress, Wei et al.46 reported that Kindlin-2 physically interacted with TGFβ R1 and activated Smad3 phosphorylation in human kidney tubular epithelial cells. Furthermore, a more recent study showed that Kindlin-1 controls TGF-β availability to regulate cutaneous stem cell proliferation47. Detailed molecular mechanisms through which Kindlin-2 modulates TGF-β signalling will be an important area of future studies. Several important lines of evidence from this study, and studies by others, support the role of Kindlin-2 in regulating chondrocyte function and chondrogenesis by controlling, at least in part, the expression of Sox9, a master regulator of chondrocyte function. First, we found that the loss of Kindlin-2 dramatically reduced Sox9 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in chondrocytes, as well as in limbs. Second, in our study, the overexpression of Kindlin-2 increased the levels of Sox9 mRNA and protein and activated Sox9 gene promoter transcription. Third, we found that the forced expression of Sox9 through adenoviral vectors in primary mesenchymal progenitor cells largely restored the defects in chondrocyte differentiation gene expression and chondrogenic nodule formation induced by the loss of Kindlin-2. Finally, mice lacking Kindlin-2 in Prx1-expressing mesenchymal progenitors in the current study, and those lacking Sox9 in the same cell type3 share some striking cellular and skeletal abnormalities (for example, reduced chondrocyte proliferation and survival, increased hypertrophy, and severe limb shortening), suggesting that both factors may function in the same pathway. The fact that Kindlin-2 protein exists in the nuclei of chondrocytes and activates the Sox9 gene promoter raises the possibility that Kindlin-2 may function as a transcription activator or co-activator for the Sox9 gene, although it is also possible that Kindlin-2 upregulates the expression of some other protein(s) that in turn affect Sox9 expression. Future study will elucidate these possibilities. Work from this study, and studies by others, suggest that the Kindlin-2-integrin signalling pathway plays an extremely important role in chondrogenesis. The selective deletion of Kindlin-2 in chondrocytes led to progressive dwarfism, severe kyphosis and low bone mass in our study, while, in another study, inactivation of β1 integrin in chondrocytes in mice resulted in a severe chondrodysplasia45. ILK, a Kindlin-2-binding protein, regulated chondrocyte shape and proliferation48 and mice lacking ILK in chondrocytes displayed a similar chondrodysplasia49. However, it is interesting to compare the phenotypes of the deletion of Kindlin-2 in Prx1-expressing mesenchymal progenitor cells (Prx1-Cre; Kindlin-2fl/fl mice) in the current study with those of the deletion of β1 integrin (Prx1-Cre; β1fl/fl mice)50 in the same cell type in mice. First, the skeletal defects exhibited by the Prx1-Cre; Kindlin-2fl/fl mice were much more severe than those of the Prx1-Cre; β1fl/fl mice. Prx1-Cre; Kindlin-2fl/fl mice died immediately after birth while Prx1-Cre; β1fl/fl mice survived at birth and beyond. Second, Prx1-Cre; Kindlin-2fl/fl mice displayed severe defects in both intramembranous and endochondral ossification, while no defects in intramembranous ossification were reported in Prx1-Cre; β1fl/fl mice, although they did exhibit less severe defects in endochondral ossification, including shortened long bones. These findings suggest that Kindlin-2 controls intramembranous ossification independent of β1 integrin activation and/or a functional compensation of β3 integrin for the loss of β1 integrin in the head mesenchyme. Thus, while the current study supports an important role of Kindlin-2 in regulation of the integrin signalling pathway in skeletal development, it suggests that Kindlin-2 also plays pivotal roles in the regulation of other major developmental pathways (for example, Sox9 expression and TGF-β signalling) in the skeleton. The genetic models and findings described in this paper will be instrumental for future studies aimed at dissecting the integrin-dependent and independent functions of Kindlin-2 during different stages of skeletal development and homeostasis. To generate Kindlin-2fl/fl mice, a Kindlin-2 targeting vector was generated as depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1a. This targeting vector was linearized and introduced into R1 embryonic stem (ES) cells via electroporation. G418-resistant ES cell clones were screened for homologous recombination by Southern blotting (Supplementary Fig.1b). Of 180 ES cell clones analysed, 10 had homologous recombination. Two of the ES cell clones were injected into blastocysts from C57BL/6 mice, resulting in generation of chimeric mice, five of which were almost 100% agouti males. We obtained germ-line transmission of the floxed allele (Kindlin-2fl/++neo) by crossing the chimeric mice with C57BL/6 breeders. To avoid potential interference from the pGKneo cassette, we crossed the mice with flippase deleter mice51 to generate floxed (without the neo cassette) heterozygous mice (Kindlin-2fl/+). The Kindlin-2fl/+mice were intercrossed to generate mice that are homozygous floxed (Kindlin-2fl/fl). Both heterozygous and homozygous animals were viable and fertile and showed no noticeable phenotypic changes. All mice used in this study have been crossed with normal C57BL/6 mice for at least eight generations to minimize potential effects of genetic background on skeletogenesis and homeostasis. All research protocols were approved by the respective Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of University of Pittsburgh, University of California, San Diego or Rush University. Embryos and neonates were stained with alcian blue and alizarin red as previously described52. In brief, embryos and neonates were eviscerated and fixed in 100% ethanol for 4 days and transferred to acetone. After 3 days, they were rinsed with water and stained for 10 days in staining solution containing 1 vol 0.1% alizarin red S (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in 95% ethanol, 1 vol 0.3% alcian blue 8GX (Sigma) in 70% ethanol, 1 vol 100% acetic acid and 17 vol ethanol. After rinsing with 95% ethanol, specimens were kept in 20% glycerol/1% KOH at 37 °C for 24 h and then at room temperature until the skeletons became clearly visible. For storage, specimens were transferred into 50%, 80%, and finally, 100% glycerol. For histology, bone tissues were fixed in 10% formalin at 4 °C for 24 h, decalcified in 10% EDTA (pH 7.4) for 10–14 days and embedded in paraffin. Bone sections were used for haematoxylin and alcian blue staining using our standard protocols. Fixed non-demineralized femurs were used for microcomputerized tomography (μCT) analysis in the Department of Biochemistry of Rush University Medical Center using a μCT35 (SCANCO Medical AG), as previously described53. Following killing, femurs were isolated and fixed in 70% ethanol for 2 days. Non-demineralized femurs from each group were scanned and measured by μCT (μCT35, SCANCO Medical AG, Wayne, PA) with an isotropic resolution of 7.0 μm, following the standards of techniques and terminology recommended by the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research54. For trabecular bone parameters, transverse slices were obtained in the region of interest in the axial direction from the trabecular bone 0.1 mm below the growth plate (bottom of the primary spongiosa). Contours were defined and drawn close to the cortical bone. The trabecular bone was then removed and analysed separately. A three-dimensional analysis was performed on 250 trabecular bone slices. A 1.75-mm section was used to obtain mid-femoral cortical bone thickness. The analysis of the specimens involved the following bone measurements—bone volume fraction/total tissue volume (%) and cortical thickness (Cort.Th). For immunohistochemistry, 5-μm sections were stained with antibodies against Kindlin-2 (Abcam, cat#: ab74030, 1:400), active caspase-3 (Abcam, cat# ab2302, 1:300), pSmad2 (Cell Signaling Technology, cat#: 8828S, 1:300), total Smad2/3 (Cell Signaling Technology, cat#: 8685S, 1:500) or control IgG using the EnVision+System-HRP (DAB) kit (Dako North America Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Cells were seeded and cultured on sterile glass cover slips in six-well plates. Twenty-four hours later, cells were fixed in 10% formaldehyde for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X-100 containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The cells were then stained with a primary antibody (mouse anti-Kindlin-2, diluted 1:300) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the cells were incubated with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) secondary antibodies (1:300) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then imaged using a confocal microscope (SP2-AOBS Leica Microsystems). BrdU staining was used to measure cell proliferation as previously described55. In brief, pregnant mice (E14.5) were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μg bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)/12 μg fluorodeoxyuridine per gram of body weight 3 h before killing. After killing, embryos were removed and genotyped. Humeri of WT and Kindlin-2Prx1 cKO mice were isolated and sectioned at 10 μm. To identify actively proliferating chondrocytes, nuclei that have incorporated BrdU were detected using a Zymed BrdU immunostaining kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction. BrdU-positive cells were counted and normalized to the total cell numbers in the same area. Cell survival was evaluated using the ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Millipore) as previously described56, 57. This method is based on the classical TUNEL assay to examine apoptosis by detecting DNA fragmentation. Sections of WT and Kindlin-2Prx1 cKO humeri were prepared and stained using the kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Cells were counterstained with haematoxylin. All positive (brown) and negative (blue) nuclei were counted. Apoptotic cells were normalized to the total cells from the same area. RNA isolation and reverse transcription (RT) have been previously described58. In brief, total RNAs were isolated using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. RT was performed using 1 μg of denatured RNA and 100 pmol of random hexamers (Applied Biosystem, Foster, CA) in a total volume of 25 μl containing 12.5 U MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystem). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed to measure the relative mRNA levels using the SYBR Green kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.). Samples were normalized to Gapdh expression. The DNA sequences of primers used for qPCR are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Western blot analysis was performed as previously described59. In brief, protein extracts were fractionated on a 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). The membrane was blocked in 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 buffer; probed with primary antibodies, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase; and visualized using a Western Blotting Detection Kit (GE Healthcare, cat#: RPN2106). Antibodies used for western blotting in this study were Kindlin-1 (Sigma, SAB4200465, 1:1,000), Kindlin-3 (Cell Signaling, Cat# 13,843, 1:300), TGFβ R1 (Santa Cruz, sc-9048, 1:500), TGFβ R2 (Santa Cruz, sc-400, 1:500), pFAK (Santa Cruz, sc-11765, 1:300), Sox9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-20095, 1:500), pSmad2/3 (Cell Signaling Technology, cat#: 8828S, 1:500), total Smad2/3 (Cell Signaling Technology, cat#: 8685S, 1:500), integrin β1 (BD, cat# 610468, 1:3,000), ILK (Cell Signaling, cat# I0783, 1:1,000), p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling, cat# 9,212, 1:1,000), phospho-p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling, cat# 9,216, 1:1,000), (Sigma-Aldrich, cat#: T-7451, 1:1,000), tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, cat#: T-7451, 1:5,000), β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, cat#: A5316, 1:4,000). The Kindlin-2 antibody (1:1,000) has been previously described19. Secondary anti-rabbit (1:5,000) or anti-mouse (1:5,000) antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Images of western blots are provided as Supplementary Figs 8 and 9. Five-μm bone sections were mounted onto polylysine-treated slides and subjected to in situ hybridization using a protocol provided by the Center for Musculoskeletal Research, University of Rochester (http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/musculoskeletal-research/core-services/histology/protocols.cfm). The vectors for preparing the Sox9 and Ihh probes were kindly provided by Dr Matthew J. Hilton (University of Rochester Medical Center). Antisense riboprobe syntheses were prepared using the DIG RNA Labeling Mix from Roche (Cat#: 11277073910). pCMV/β-gal and pCMV/Kindlin-2 were previously described19. p2.8Sox9-luc was kindly provided by Professor Elazar Zelzer of the Weizmann Institute of Science. For transfection, the cells were plated on 35-mm dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells cm−2. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2,000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each transfection contained 0.25 μg of the indicated reporter plasmids plus 1 ng of pRL-SV40, containing a complementary DNA for Renilla Reformis luciferase to control for transfection efficiency. The cells were harvested and assayed using the Dual Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) on a Module Microplate Multimode Reader (Turner Biosystem, Sunnyvale, CA). For all transfection experiments, the amount of plasmid DNA was balanced as necessary with pCMV/β-gal such that the total DNA was constant for each group. Adenoviral vectors for enhanced green fluorescent protein (Ad/EGFP) and Kindlin-2 (Ad/Kindlin-2) were previously described20. Ad/Cre was kindly provided by Dr Yifan Dai of the Nanjing Medical University. Ad/Sox9 was purchased from Vector BioLabs (Philadelphia, PA). Cells were infected with adenovirus as previously described58. In briefly, virus was added to cells in 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Dishes were rotated every 5 min for the first 15 min to ensure that all of the cells were exposed to virus. After 1 h, media were aspirated, and cultures were rinsed twice with serum-free medium, and then fresh media supplemented with 10% FBS were added to the dishes. The amount of adenovirus was balanced as necessary with Ad/EGFP such that the total amount was constant in each group. Isolation of limb mesenchymal cells was performed as previously described11. In brief, limb buds from E12.5 or E13.5 embryos were isolated, dissociated into single cell suspension by digesting with 1 mg ml−1 collagenase D (Roche Applied Sci., Cat# 11088858001) for 3 h in a 37-°C incubator and filtered to remove undigested tissues. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 r.p.m. for 5 min, resuspended and reconstituted at a density of 1 × 107 cells ml−1 in F12:DMEM (1:1) media supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. For micromass cultures, 1 × 105 cells in 10 μl were dropped into a dish and allowed to attach for 1 h in a 37-°C incubator. The cells were then flooded with the F12:DMEM (1:1) media supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics, 50 μg ml−1 ascorbic acid and 10 mM β-glycerol phosphate for the indicated times, followed by alcian blue staining, western blot or qPCR analyses. Integrin activation was analysed based on a protocol that we have previously described60. In brief, active β1 integrin was detected by incubating the mesenchymal cells isolated from WT and Kindlin-2Prx1 cKO limbs with a rat anti-β1 integrin antibody (9EG7) that specifically recognizes the active form of β1 integrin (BD Pharmingen). The cells were washed three times with PBS containing 5 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin and then incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-rat IgG at 4 °C for 30 min. Total β1 integrin was detected by incubating the cells with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-β1 integrin antibody that recognizes total β1 integrin (BioLegend catalogue number 102,214) at 4 °C for 30 min. The levels of the active and total β1 integrin were quantified using a BD FACS Calibur flow cytometer. The integrin activation index is defined as the mean fluorescence intensities of active β1 integrin divided by the mean fluorescence intensities of β1 integrin. The effect of loss of Kindlin-2 on β1 integrin activation was assessed by comparing the activation index in mutant cells with that of Cre-negative (WT) cells (normalized to 100%). The data were analysed using the GraphPad Prism software (4.0). Student’s’ t-test was used to test for differences between two groups of data. Results were expressed as mean±s.d. Differences with P<0.05 were considered statistically significant. All experiments were repeated at least three times. How to cite this article: Wu, C. et al.

        "title": "Effects of cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor NS-398 on the proliferation and apoptosis of human esophageal carcinoma cell lines",
        "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the biological effects of NS-398, a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitor, on esophageal carcinoma cell lines and the possible mechanism.METHODS: Esophageal carcinoma cell lines Eca-109 and TE-13 were cultured by routine method, and then treated with different concen-trations of NS-398 (5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μmol/L) for 24, 48 and 72 hours. The growths of Eca-109 and TE-13 cells were measured by MTT assay. The expression of COX-2, Bcl-2 and Bax in the cells were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). TUNEL and FCM methods were also used todetect the NS-398-induced apoptosis of the cells. The content of prostaglandin E2 in the superna-tants of cell culture was measured by radioim-munoassay (RIA).RESULTS: NS-398 inhibited the proliferations of Eca-109 and TE-13 cells in concentration- and time-dependent manners, and also decreased the production of PGE2. Meanwhile, NS-398 treatment resulted in an increase of G0/G1-phase cells and a decrease of S-phase ones in both kinds of cells (Eca-109: F = 22.39, P < 0.01; TE-13: F = 46.99, P < 0.01). The apoptosis of Eca-109 and TE-13 cells was also obviously increased after NS-398 treatment. COX-2 and Bcl-2 protein expression were down-regulated, while Bax protein expression was up-regulated in Eca-109 and TE-13 cells after NS-398 treatment. There was a positive correlation between COX-2 and Bcl-2 expression in the two cell lines (Eca-109: r = 0.925, P < 0.01; TE-13: r = 0.925, P < 0.01), but a negative correlation between COX-2 and Bax ex-pression (Eca-109: r = -0.937, P < 0.01; TE-13: r = -0.703, P < 0.01) as well as between Bax and Bcl-2 expression (Eca-109: r = -0.926, P < 0.01; TE-13: r = -0.753, P < 0.01).CONCLUSION: COX-2 selective inhibitor NS-398 may inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of esophageal carcinoma cell lines through the inactivation of COX-2, down-reg-ulation of Bcl-2 expression, and up-regulation of Bax experssion. It may be used in the chemo-prevention or adjuvant treatment of esophageal carcinomas.",

        "abstract": "Metal nanocatalysts hold great promise for a wide range of heterogeneous catalytic reactions, while the optimization strategy of catalytic activity is largely restricted by particle size or shape control. Here, we demonstrate that a reversible microstructural control through the crossover between multiply twinned nanoparticle (MTP) and single crystal (SC) can be readily achieved by solvent post-treatment on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Polar solvents (e.g., water, methanol) direct the transformation from MTP to SC accompanied by the disappearance of twinning and stacking faults. A reverse transformation from SC to MTP is achieved in nonpolar solvent (e.g., toluene) mixed with thiol ligands. The transformation between two different microstructures is directly observed by in situ TEM and leads to a drastic modulation of catalytic activity toward the gas-phase selective oxidation of alcohols. On the basis of the combined experimental and theoretical investigations of alcohol chemisorption on these nanocatalys...",

        "abstract": "Considerable research and development efforts are being devoted to the efficient generation of solar fuels. A solar fuels device couples a solar photoabsorber with catalysts to convert solar energy to chemical energy via reactions such as oxygen evolution (water splitting). Widespread deployment of this technology hinges upon discovery of new materials through efforts such as the high throughput screening of oxygen evolution catalysts, as discussed in this manuscript. We derive an expression for the efficiency of the oxygen evolution catalyst that combines catalytic and optical properties. Using this hybrid efficiency, we screen 5456 samples in a (Fe-Co-Ni-Ti)Ox pseudo-quaternary catalyst library using automated, high throughput electrochemical and optical experiments. The observed compositional trends in this catalyst efficiency lead to the discovery of a new high performance composition region. © 2013 The Electrochemical Society.",

The average operation time was 60 +/- 23.2 (range 30-180) min. The removed prostatic tissue weighed 31 +/- 9 (range 10-56) g on average. The average catheter time was 1.5 d (from 20 h to 4 d). No blood transfusion was performed in all cases. Histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of BPH in all cases. In the 3-month follow up of 32 cases, IPSS dropped from 24 +/- 6.2 to 5.6 +/- 3.6; the peak urinary flow rate(Qmax) went up from 8.5 +/- 3.9 ml/s to 22.0 +/- 7.2 ml/s; the residual volume of urine dropped from 138 +/- 125 ml to 21 +/- 15 ml. No serious complications were found.HoLEP is effective in treating BPH. It can completely enucleate the hyperplastic tissue with little bleeding in operation. The treatment has the advantages of short catheter time and significant clinical improvements.",

The keratin, extracted from human hair, and HA mixture were rapidly frozen with liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized to prepare keratin/HA laminar scaffold. The scaffold was then immersed in PBS for reinforcement treatment, and followed by a second lyophilization to prepare the reinforced keratin/HA scaffold. The morphology, mechanical, chemical, crystal and thermal property of the keratin/HA scaffold were investigated by SEM, FTIR, XRD, DSC, respectively. The results showed that the keratin/HA scaffold had a high porosity of 76.17 ± 3%. The maximum compressive strength and compressive modulus of the reinforced scaffold is 0.778 and 3.3 MPa respectively. Subcutaneous implantation studies in mice showed that  the scaffold was biocompatible since the foreign body reaction seen around the implanted scaffold samples was moderate and became minimal upon increasing implantation time. These results demonstrate that the keratin/HA reinforced scaffold prepared here is promising for biomedical utilization.",

        "abstract": "Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is an important cause of organ dysfunction in the critically ill. With reperfusion, Kupffer cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote endothelial cell (EC) expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, facilitating neutrophil (PMN) infiltration. Studies suggest hypertonic saline (HTS) might exert beneficial effects on development of organ injury following shock on the basis of reduced PMN-EC interactions. We hypothesized that HTS alters expression of EC ICAM-1 and thus minimizes PMN-mediated injury. To test our hypothesis, we used an in vivo model of hepatic I/R and an in vitro model of activated EC. Rats underwent 30 min of hepatic ischemia after pretreatment with HTS (7.5% NaCl, 4cc/kg ia) or normal saline (NS). At 4 h reperfusion, plasma was taken for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and liver tissue was harvested for assessment of hepatic ICAM-1 mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and exposed to hypertonic medium (350-500 mOsM). HUVEC ICAM-1 protein was measured by cell ELISA and ICAM-1 mRNA by Northern blot analysis. HTS prevented hepatic I/R injury as measured by AST. AST of shams was 282.6+/-38.1 IU/L. I/R following NS pretreatment caused significant injury (AST 973.8+/-110.9 IU/L) compared to sham (SM) (P < 0.001). Pretreatment with HTS exerted significant protection following I/R with an AST of 450.9+/-56.3 IU/L (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in AST levels between SM and HTS groups. Reduced hepatic injury after HTS and I/R was accompanied by inhibition of I/R-induced hepatic ICAM-1 mRNA expression compared to NS treated animals (P < 0.01). Similarly, hypertonicity inhibited HUVEC LPS-induced ICAM-1 protein (LPS: 1.86+/-0.19 absorbance units; 400 mOsM +/- LPS: 1.45+/-0.14 absorbance units; 450 mOsM + LPS: 1.02+/-0.19 absorbance units, P < 0.001) and mRNA expression. Thus, hypertonicity modulates endothelial ICAM-1 expression as one possible protective mechanism against I/R injury.",

        "abstract": "Few studies have explored the neurobiological basis of insight level in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), though the salience network (SN) has been implicated in insight deficits in schizophrenia. This study was then designed to investigate whether resting-state (rs) functional connectivity (FC) of SN was associated with insight level in OCD patients. We analyzed rs-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 21 OCD patients with good insight (OCD-GI), 19 OCD patients with poor insight (OCD-PI), and 24 healthy controls (HCs). Seed-based whole-brain FC and ROI (region of interest)-wise connectivity analyses were performed with seeds/ROIs in the bilateral anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). The right AI-right medial orbital frontal cortex (mOFC) connectivity was found to be uniquely decreased in the OCD-PI group, and the value of this aberrant connectivity correlated with insight level in OCD patients. In addition, we found that the OCD-GI group had significantly increased right AI-left dACC connectivity within the SN, relative to HCs (overall trend for groups: OCD-GI > OCD-PI > HC). Our findings suggest that abnormal right AI-right mOFC FC may mediate insight deficits in OCD, perhaps due to impaired encoding and integration of self-evaluative information about OCD-related beliefs and behaviors. Our findings indicate a SN connectivity dissociation between OCD-GI and OCD-PI patients and support the notion of considering OCD-GI and OCD-PI as two distinct disorder subtypes.",

Results:82 cases were treated by MPCNL,the rate of one-time gravel was 96.3%.59 cases were treated by URL, and the rate of one-time gravel was 83.1%.26 cases were treated by RLU,and the success rate of stone remove was 100%.2 cases were obliged to accept the second MPCNL because of blood after puncture.1 case was obliged to accept ureteroscopic lithotripsy because the stone went down.5 cases were obliged to accept the open surgery because the ureteroscopic lithotripsy was failure.5 cases were obliged to MPCNL because the stone moved to the renal pelvis.Conclusions:RLU is an efficient minimally invasive surgical technique,but it needs a comprehensive technical training of laparoscopic.MPCNL is becoming the important technology and the best method for upper ureteral calculi because of its good effect.URL was not suitable for upper ureteral calculi.Although with large trauma,ureterolithotomy is the base of all ureteral operation.",

The present study aimed to confirm the factor model of the Chinese version of TEPS and test measurement invariance of the scale across gender in Chinese university students. Participants were 2977 (51% female) undergraduates aged from 16 to 27 years (Mean age = 18.9 years). Results indicated that the revised four-factor structure of the TEPS had acceptable fit in the total sample and in gender groups. Furthermore, configural, metric and partial scalar invariance across gender were established. Two of the items (item 4 and 8) demonstrated different intercepts and women scored higher than men on both items. With partial scalar invariance demonstrated, test of differences in latent means indicated that men had lower levels of pleasure when compared with women. To our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to test the measurement invariance of the TEPS across gender, which provides support for future research that involves examining hedonic capacity in Chinese men and women.",

It has been proven that aging dysregulates immunity and impairs neutrophil function. However, the influence of aging on the ability to produce NETs has yet to be fully addressed. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a lower level of autophagy in neutrophils from aged mice was responsible for the decrease in NET formation. We demonstrated that a broad range of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) ligands could efficiently induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) -dependent NET release in young mice, but not in aged ones. We further explored that the difference between young and aged mice in TLR2 ligand-induced NETosis is the result of an Atg5 defect and subsequent impaired autophagy. Furthermore, we found that lower autophagy capacity led to not only reduced NET formation, but also increased apoptosis. Our results suggest an important role of Atg5 and autophagy in maintaining the function of NETs formation in response to infection and in regulating neutrophil death. Targeting autophagy-promoted NETs may present a therapeutic strategy to improve infection defence in an aged population.",

        "abstract": "Guangxi Xijiang Economic Belt is an important component of future development axis in southern China.Recently,a tendency of industrial agglomeration has emerged along the Xijiang River.Although the industrial parks in this area have developed rapidly,many negative phenomena have appeared,such as disorders in industrial park development,industrial structure resemble,and low rate of land output.By analyzing the development characteristics and affecting factors of the industrial parks along the Guangxi's Xijiang River,the study finds that regional development basis,industrial park development basis,industrial park development potential and constraint conditions of industrial park development are the main factors affecting the development level and trends of industrial parks.Firstly,regional industrial basis and urban layout are macro factors.Secondly,traffic conditions and government support policies are micro factors.Thirdly,instructing China-ASEAN Free Trade Area(CAFTA),developing Xijiang waterway and undertaking the eastern industrial transfer are the driving factors.Fourthly,resources and environmental pressures are constraints.On this basis,we construct a 4-factor index evaluation system consisting of 13 indexes,classify the industrial parks into three types—development-optimizing type,agglomeration-stengthening type and cultivation-guiding type,and propose different development paths for them.Development-optimizing type should give full play to its leading role in the region and strengthen the growth of new industries,and emphasize industrial association,especially the high-tech and high value-added industrial chains and links.Agglomeration-stengthening type should ensure the development direction of the industrial park,and make the industrial park to be a competitive and influential industrial cluster.Cultivation-guiding type should focus on industrial parks at a certain scale,and promote production concentration.",

        "abstract": "Hypertonic resuscitation fluids are known to be effective in restoring circulating volume in the hypovolemic trauma patient. Previous studies have suggested that hypertonicity might exert effects on immune cells leading to an altered host response. The present studies evaluated the effect of hypertonic resuscitation on the development of lung injury in a hemorrhagic shock model in which antecedent shock primes for increased lung neutrophil sequestration in response to intratracheal LPS. Resuscitation with hypertonic saline significantly reduced albumin leak, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid neutrophil counts, and the degree of histopatho- logic injury compared with resuscitation with Ringer's lactate. Both in vivo and in vitro data suggest that this beneficial effect may be related to altered adhesion molecule expression by the neutrophil. Specifically, hypertonicity induced shedding of L-selectin and prevented LPS-stimulated expression and activation of CD11b, both of which might contribute to reduced sequestration in the lung. Impaired up-regulation of lung ICAM-1 may have also participated, although ex vivo studies suggest that alterations in neutrophils were sufficient to account for the effect. Lung cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant did not differ between animals resuscitated with hypertonic saline vs Ringer's lactate. Considered together, these studies demonstrate a possible novel approach to inhibiting organ injury in disease processes characterized by neutrophil-mediated damage.

Methods BCG Ag85B signal sequence was amplified from the genome of BCG by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned in E.coli-BCG shuttle-vector pMV261 to get pMS. The cDNA fragment encoding human IL-2 was amplified from the plasmid pBIL-2 by using PCR and inserted into the shuttle expression vector pMV261. The recombinant plamid pMSIL-2 was identified by restriction endonuclease digestion, PCR amplification and nucleotide sequencing. pMSIL-2 was electroporated into BCG to get rBCG. The DNA and protein expressions of IL-2 gene in rBCG were determined by PCR and Western blotting respectively. IL-2 in the culture supernatant of rBCG was detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results The recombinant plamid pMSIL-2 was constructed successfully and confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis, PCR detection and nucleotide sequencing analysis. pMSIL-2 was successfully transformed into BCG by eletroporation and were capable of synthesizing and secreting cytokine IL-2. Western blotting revealed that the secretive proteins could specially combine with antibody against human IL-2. the level of IL-2 in the culture supernatant of rBCG was higher than control group by ELISA assay. Conclusions The constructed recombinant BCG strain produce and secrete human IL-2 and it will be used for the treatment of superficial bladder cancer.",

        "abstract": "Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a potent anabolic agent for the treatment of osteoporosis. However, its mechanism of action in osteoblast and bone is not well understood. In this study, we show that the anabolic actions of PTH in bone are severely impaired in both growing and adult ovariectomized mice lacking bone-related activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Our study demonstrates that ATF4 deficiency suppresses PTH-stimulated osteoblast proliferation and survival and abolishes PTH-induced osteoblast differentiation, which, together, compromise the anabolic response. We further demonstrate that the PTH-dependent increase in osteoblast differentiation is correlated with ATF4-dependent up-regulation of Osterix. This regulation involves interactions of ATF4 with a specific enhancer sequence in the Osterix promoter. Furthermore, actions of PTH on Osterix require this same element and are associated with increased binding of ATF4 to chromatin. Taken together these experiments establish a fundamental role for ATF4 in the anabolic actions of PTH on the skeleton.",

        "abstract": "Starting from the factors restricting the regional coordinative development, this paper analyzes the disadvantages of traditional regional developmental models and the misunderstanding towards spatial structure efficiency and discusses the puzzlement over whether reducing regional economic development disparity can be set as the objective of regional developmental strategy. In addition, the paper also analyzes the weakness of Four Macro Regions Strategy (different developmental strategies implemented towards four regions including Western, Northeastern, Central and Eastern areas) and its reasons, and investigates the institutional and mechanism problems related to incomplete spatial planning system. Based on such findings, the study illustrates the significance of carrying out the major function oriented zoning (MFOZ hereafter). As a blueprint of territorial and spatial development with emphasis on humanism and human-nature harmony, MFOZ is a guideline for the government to implement spatial governance and a platform for integrating related resources of spatial planning. It is also the scientific basis on which the regulatory roles of both government and market can be fully played and regional coordinative development can be boosted and the instruction for the whole society leading to correct understanding and rational construction of our living space.",

It is however challenging to develop hemostatic agents or dressings that simultaneously deliver a fast, long-lasting and safe treatment of hemorrhage. Here, we integrate meso-/micro-porosity, blood coagulation and stability into a flexible zeolite-cotton hybrid hemostat. We employ an on-site template-free growth route that tightly binds mesoporous single-crystal chabazite zeolite onto the surface of cotton fibers. This hemostatic material maintains high procoagulant activity after water flow treatment. Chabazite particles are firmly anchored onto the cotton surface with < 1% leaching after 10 min of sonication. The as-synthesized hemostatic device has superior hemostatic performance over most other clay or zeolite-based inorganic hemostats, in terms of higher procoagulant activity, minimized loss of active components and better scalability for practical applications (a hemostatic T-shirt is hereby demonstrated as an example).",

        "abstract": "Hemorrhagic shock renders patients susceptible to the development of acute lung injury in response to a second inflammatory stimulus by as yet unclear mechanisms. We investigated the role of neutrophils (PMN) in alveolar macrophage (AMphi) priming, specifically, the role in mediating Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 and TLR2 cross talk in AMphi. Using a mouse model of hemorrhagic shock followed by intratracheal administration of LPS, we explored a novel function of shock-activated PMN in the mechanism of TLR2 upregulation induced by LPS-TLR4 signaling in AMphi. We showed that antecedent hemorrhagic shock enhanced LPS-induced TLR2 upregulation in AMphi. In neutropenic mice subjected to shock, the LPS-induced TLR2 expression was significantly reduced, and the response was restored upon repletion with PMN obtained from shock-resuscitated mice but not by PMN from sham-operated mice. These findings were recapitulated in mouse AMphi cocultured with PMN. The enhanced TLR2 upregulation in AMphi augmented the expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-2, TNF-alpha, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor in the AMphi in response to sequential challenges of LPS and peptidoglycan, a prototypical TLR2 ligand, which physiologically associated with amplified AMphi-induced PMN migration into air pouch and lung alveoli. Thus TLR2 expression in AMphi, signaled by TLR4 and regulated by shock-activated PMN, is an important positive-feedback mechanism responsible for shock-primed PMN infiltration into the lung after primary PMN sequestration.",

        "abstract": "The coupling of industrial location and urban system distribution is beneficial both to industrial growth and urban development. This paper is a case study discussing the importance and process of coupling industrial location with urban system distribution. Our study indicates that location choices of industrial enterprises have been influencing the evolvement of Luoyang's urban system since 1953 and location orientations of large industrial firms would be the key determinants of urban distribution in the future. We therefore investigate location orientations of different divisions of large industrial firms, mainly by interviews with their executives and questionnaire survey. The result of investigation shows that the intending location choices of industrial firms are mostly short-term benefits oriented and would not couple with the anticipant pattern of urban distribution, which might sabotage the long-term development of both industrial firms and urban system. Therefore, we propose that suppliers of large industrial firms should be located in county towns about 30 km away from Luoyang City, which are the anticipant locations of urban development. In that case, industrial location would be coupled with the ideal pattern of urban distribution, which would maximize the service function of urban system and facilitate long-term urban and industrial development. Our study also shows that it is possible to change the location orientations of supplier of large industrial firms to county towns 30 km away from Luoyang City, if necessary measures were taken by local government, such as building expressways connecting Luoyang City and county towns, reducing the land price of county towns by government subsidies and reinforcing county towns' strengths on service ability and infrastructure conditions.",

Such a microscopy study on surface oxidation, down to the atomic scale, is essential for understanding the structure-property correlations of palladium nanocrystal based catalysts. Herein, we present an in situ atomic scale study on the surface oxidation behavior of palladium nanocrystals, which is induced by electron beam irradiation under low oxygen partial pressure and at room temperature inside an environmental transmission electron microscope. We found that: (i) surface oxidation initially started at the edge sites with atomic steps or vertex sites, which served as active sites for oxidation; (ii) the oxidation reaction proceeded with a much faster rate on the {111} surface, indicating a certain crystallography preference; (iii) nanometer-sized palladium monoxide islands were formed on the surfaces eventually. The results from our in situ studies provide insightful knowledge, and will be of certain importance for the design of improved functional catalysts in future.",

Herein, we for the first time fabricate a AuPdPt ternary nanophase diagram at 800 °C by experimental means. The solid-state synthesis strategy enables a precise synthesis of AuPdPt trimetallic nanoparticles with a full range of compositions and desired size distributions. By studying the phase behavior of those TMNPs, we succeed in mapping out the boundary curve and tie lines. Interestingly, the AuPdPt nanophase boundary shifts obviously to the Au-rich region as compared to the case of the corresponding bulk diagram, likely due to the combination of size and composition effects. Besides, owing to the different solubility of Pd in Au-rich and Pt-rich matrix, some tie lines do not parallel the baseline. These observations greatly improve our basic understanding of nanophase diagrams and are expected to be valuable references for other systems. Moreover, the as-fabricated nanophase diagram is successfully ap...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A series of sulfated CeO 2  catalysts were synthesized by impregnation and sol-gel methods and used for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO  x   by NH 3 . The results showed that the sulfated CeO 2  catalysts prepared by sol-gel method showed excellent catalytic activity at 150–450 °C, and more than 90% NO  x   conversion was obtained at 232–450 °C with a gas hourly space velocity of 60000 h −1 . The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N 2  adsorption, Raman, thermogravimetry (TG), H 2 -temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) and Py-infrared spectroscopy (Py-IR). The excellent SCR performance was associated with the surface acidity and the micro-structure. The introduction of sulfate acid into CeO 2  could increase the amount of Bronsted and Lewis acid sites over the catalysts, resulting in the improvement of the low temperature activity. The sulfated CeO 2  catalysts prepared by sol-gel method possessed lower crystallization degree, excellent redox property and larger specific surface areas, which were responsible for the superior SCR performance.",

        "abstract": "It is a very important measure to realize a healthy urbanization and construct an ecological civilization through optimization on the spatial pattern of urbanization.In order to achieving a people-oriented,comprehensive,coordinated and sustainable,comparative urbanization,the construction of development belt of vertical coastline throughout the coastal islands should be enhanced.Meanwhile,the urbanization mode that formed by multiple regional characteristics should also be concerned and set as one of the focuses of optimization on the spatial pattern of urbanization.Furthermore,the exploration of suitable way for accelerating regional semi-urbanization is another important issue for improving the urbanization mode.The global competitiveness of China could be enhanced through improving the planning system and regional policies,rational allocation of government resources,and cultivation of eastern megalopolis areas(or strip).With respect to the advantage accumulation during regional development,the regional distribution of inland group of towns should be seriously concerned and intervened for achieving regional coordinated development.Regarding to the special situation in China,the urbanization process should be reasonably promoted through collaborative development of industrialization and agricultural modernization,and meanwhile,exploration of suitable urbanization modes for different areas,such as hilly landscape areas,undeveloped areas,and key ecological functional zones.Through practice the key strategies above,the spatial pattern of urbanization in China would be achieved till the year 2030 that can coordinate the urban population distribution with natural environment and resources,coordinate the social economic output with ecological benefits.",

The changes in neural plasticity induced by stress and other negative stimuli play a significant role in the onset and development of depression. Antidepressant treatments have also been found to exert their antidepressant effects through regulatory effects on neural plasticity. However, the detailed mechanisms of neural plasticity in depression still remain unclear. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the recent literature to elaborate the possible mechanistic role of neural plasticity in depression. Taken together, these findings may pave the way for future progress in neural plasticity studies.",

        "abstract": "The design and preparation of efficient, stable and economical metal nanoparticles supported on mesoporous metal oxides (MNPs/MMOs) has been a major direction in many applications especially in the catalysis area. The conventional synthesis methods for MNPs/MMOs are complex and lack high-degree control over different compositional/structural parameters. Herein, we reported a general synthesis of MNP/MMO composites via a one-step, versatile sol-gel process under strongly acidic conditions. The successful introduction of stable, PVP-capped MNPs into the AcHE sol-gel system (Ac, H, and E represent acetic acid, HCl, and EtOH, respectively) allows us to synthesize a large variety of MNPs/MMOs (M = Pt, Au, Pd, and MMOs = TiO2, SiO2, ZrO 2, Al2O3). In addition to the compositional variation, the preformed PVP-capped MNPs in the AcHE sol-gel system decouple the particle nucleation and inorganic-organic co-assembly processes, permitting a stabilization of the MNPs in the nano-scale range over a wide particle concentration. Meanwhile, structural regulation can also be achieved by variation of the block copolymer concentration. The high-degree control over different compositional/structural parameters of MNPs/MMOs provides a useful material candidate platform to further study their structure-property relationship for the design of a better catalyst for a specific reaction. The best Pt/Si-TiO2 catalyst for n-hexane combustion obtained in this study serves as an example to show that the control of the adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products may be achieved by the optimization of composition and structure of the MNP/MMO catalysts, which may provide valuable insights for a detailed understanding of the structure- or composition-dependent chemical reactivity of the catalysts. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "The present work elucidated the effects of structures and surface species on the activity of CeO2 and SO42− doped MCM-41 catalysts toward NO reduction by NH3. The results indicated that the sulfated species were generated over Cat-A (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and H2SO4 simultaneously doped on MCM-41) and Cat-B (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O first immersed to MCM-41 and followed by impregnation of H2SO4) except for Cat-C (H2SO4 first doped onto MCM-41 and followed by Ce(NO3)3·6H2O). The sulfate ion contributed to the formation of Ce3+ concentration, oxygen vacancies, and surface acidity, resulting in improvement of SCR activity. However, the positive influence on SCR activity was overwhelmed by the decomposition of sulfated species. The apparent activation energy of Cat-A (60 kJ mol−1) was much lower compared with that of Cat-B and Cat-C (71 and 78 kJ mol−1, respectively). Pore structures and surface species were responsible for the SCR activity over the CeO2 and SO42− doped MCM-41 catalysts. The best catalytic activity was obtained over Cat-A, followed by Cat-B, and Cat-C exhibited the least catalytic activity.",

However, several components of anhedonia, such as consummatory and anticipatory pleasure, has not been substantially studied in OCD patients.  The Chinese version of the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (CV-TEPS) was used to evaluate both the consummatory and anticipatory pleasure in 130 OCD patients, 89 major depressive disorder (MDD) patients, and 95 healthy controls (HCs). The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were scored for assessing the severity of obsessive and compulsive symptoms and depressive symptoms, respectively. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to compare the differences of anhedonia among the three groups with the severity of depression controlled. Regression analyses were also used to analyze the relationship between consummatory and anticipatory pleasure and clinical variables in OCD patients.  After controlling for the effect of depression, there were significant differences in TEPS scores among the three groups ( < 0.05). Compared with HCs, OCD patients had lower scores on the consummatory subscale, but not the anticipatory subscale, of the TEPS. MDD patients had lower scores on both the consummatory and anticipatory subscales than HCs.  OCD patients exhibit deficits in consummatory but not anticipatory pleasure, which is distinct from MDD patients.",

        "title": "Relationship of level terrace and farmers' income and its causes in Loess Hilly Region:a case study in Guyuan,Ningxia",
        "abstract": "The hilly region of the Loess Plateau in China has always been a hot spot in varied sustainable development researches and practices,because of the highlighted problems of poverty and ecology.For a long period,several measures were created or introduced to this region,in order to promote regional sustainable development.Terracing the loess hills is oqe of them,which indeed works well as a large scale land management project in this region.It has been reported that level terrace has significant ecological and social benefits,primarily in terms of soil and water conservation,as well as providing subsistence and livelihood to local farmers.However,the existing researches have few studies on the economic effects of the level terrace,especially on farmers income,which might have an important impact on the continuity and stability of the whole system.Guyuan,a prefecture located in the southern part of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,northwestern China,is a typical representative of Loess Hilly Region with large amount of level terraces.It has experienced three upsurges of terrace construction since the founding of the P R China in 1949.And the third upsurge,since 1980s-1990s,is the largest,and lasts until right now.As of 2010,the total area of level terrace in Guyuan amounts to 143 200 hm~2,accounting for about 40%of all cultivated land.And dry planting is the main land use type on the terrace in Guyuan.Based on the survey database of all villages in Guyuan, this paper analyses the relationship between current level terrace and fanners incomes via quantitative methods of Spearman' s rank correlation coefficient and geostatistical analysis.The result of rank correlation analysis shows that it has no significant relationship between per-capita income of farmers and per-capita terrace area,proportion of the terrace to the cultivated land,even at the 0.1 significance level.Meanwhile,the analysis on geostatistical interpolation results shows that the spatial correlation coefficient between per-capita income of farmers and per-capita terrace area is only -0.015 7,almost perfectly unrelated.So all these results demonstrates that there is no significant correlation between the two factors,which means the level tenace in current situation cannot increase farmers' income effectively in Guyuan.Further analysis reveals that at least three main causes contributed to the phenomena: (l)excessive population pressure in the region;(2)unreasonable planting structure;(3) outdated land management with low production.Accordingly,several policy suggestions are put forward to maximize the benefit of level terrace, so as to promote regional sustainable development,including:(1) reducing agricultural population through emigration and urbanization;(2)improving planting structure by introducing more economic plants adapted to arid areas in Guyuan;(3) transforming traditional agriculture into industrial and ecological agriculture with local characteristics; (4)looking for new ways of terrace utilizing,such as eco-tourism,etc.",

        "abstract": "Sustainable livelihood theory provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the interactions between livelihoods of\n peasant households and regional environment change in low-income areas. Based on field survey and 946 questionnaires from\n peasant household conducted in the case study area of Zhaotong, Yunnan Province, the paper has analyzed the basic characteristics\n of the rural livelihoods, including the asset base status, the income-generating activities, the energy consumption pattern,\n and the fertility behavior, in the upper reaches of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River. The micro-level findings show the conflicts\n among extensive agricultural development models, rural energy consumption structures heavily relying on biomass and the environment\n protection. The conversion of cropland to forest and grass program (CCFGP) has exerted an important influence on the livelihoods\n of the peasant households, but its design has given little considerations to their long-term livelihood sources, which will\n affect its sustainability to a great extent. From the perspective of sustainable livelihoods framework, the objectives that\n must be addressed in the ecological shelter construction in the upper reaches of the Changjiang River should include, first,\n facilitating access of peasant households to credit, technology and public services, second, encouraging the peasant households\n to adopt agricultural technology with environmental benefits and strengthen resources-conserving investments, and third, paying\n close attention to the rural energy problems and the long-term livelihood sources of the households with CCFGP. Given the\n weak asset base and difficulties of livelihood strategies shift, ecological shelter construction in the upper reaches of the\n Changjiang River will take a long time.",

        "abstract": "Hemorrhagic shock due to major trauma predisposes to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Because lung fibrin deposition is one of the hallmarks of this syndrome, we hypothesized that resuscitated shock might predispose to the development of a net procoagulant state in the lung. A rodent model of shock/resuscitation followed by low-dose intratracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a clinically relevant \"two-hit\" model, was used to test this hypothesis. Resuscitated shock primed the lungs for an increased tissue factor and plasminogen activator (PA) inhibitor-1 gene expression in response to LPS, while the fibrinolytic PA was reduced. These alterations were recapitulated in isolated alveolar macrophages, suggesting their role in the process. LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was also augmented in animals after antecedent shock/resuscitation, and studies using anti-TNF antibodies revealed that TNF expression was critical to the induction of the procoagulant molecules and the reduction in PA. By contrast, TNF did not appear to play an important role in neutrophil sequestration in this model, inasmuch as anti-TNF had no effect on lung neutrophil accumulation or chemokine expression. However, treatment prevented albumin leak by preventing alveolar neutrophil activation. The inclusion of the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine in the resuscitation fluid resulted in prevention of both the development of the net procoagulant state and lung neutrophil sequestration, suggesting a role for upstream oxidant effects in the priming process. These studies provide a cellular and molecular basis for lung fibrin deposition after resuscitated shock and demonstrate a divergence of pathways responsible for fibrin generation and neutrophil accumulation.",

        "abstract": "This paper analyzes quantitatively the land-use type shifts according to the differences comparison of history,present status and the planning with the data from field survey and the administrative authority,and argues the issue that the regional development trend is incompatible to the territorial function,which could contribute to the understanding of scientific issue to harmonize land use and serve the decision-making for future development.The paper analyzes numeric coordination,spatial coordination,main coordination problem and effect between current land use(2010) and function planning,using the overall coordination(C1) and effective coordination(C2) and other indicators,based on the territorial function and pattern perspective,taking Muyun Town of Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan(Chang-Zhu-Tan),combination as an example.It reveals the coordination characteristic and problem of the three types of the function space including ecological space,agricultural space and construction space,and then proposes the coordination policy.The results show that: land for construction grew rapidly in the recent years,while the agricultural land,forest land and countryside land declined dramatically.There were 426.67 hm2 of cultivated land and 359.24 hm2 of forest land decreasing,with the proportion declining by 6.58% and 5.53% respectively,and the growth weight heart of the town moved eastward rapidly and became a new development corridor rapidly as well.The index C1 of ecological space is 54% and the C2 is 69.81%,with a huge ecological space gap,so a larye area of 802.95 hm2 should be added to Muyun Town,the green heart construction should take more and heavier responsibilities and must focus on strengthening the northeast forest ecology and north greenbelt.The index C1 of agricultural space is 38.08% and the C2 is 91.28%,and the space conversion potential is greater,but villages land consolidation and renovation should be strengthened to enhance production efficiency and ecological service function.The index C1 of construction space is 36.11% and the C2 is 82.94%,and the construction land has being grown too fast and occupied a large amount of ecological space,threatening the ecological green heart function and pattern formation.Growth rate and spatial layout of construction space need to be adjusted and optimized.Research suggests that a three-layer security of the function space shoud be executed,population and urban-rural land should be integrated,and moderate complex function space and regional coordination mechanism should be constructed,in order to promote the coordinated development of land use and territorial function.",

        "abstract": "China has been rapidly constructing its major transportation infrastructure such as high-speed railway and highway,waterway,which have great impacts on regional city development and urban system planning,so it is urgently needed to explore the impact evaluation method and to conduct empirical case studies.By taking Xijiang waterway development as a case study with AHP method,this paper firstly puts forward an impact evaluation index system consisting of 13 indexes in 4 aspects such as the improvement of regional economic location,the improvement of water transport capacity,the improvement of regional comprehensive transportation conditions and the potential of industrial development.Then,the differential impacts of Xijiang waterway exploitation on city development in sub-areas have been evaluated by using this index system.The results are shown as follows.(1) The impacts of Xijiang waterway development on city development are strongly concentrated on the axis of Xijiang riverside and are also different in different sub-areas.Thus,different sub-areas within Xijiang economic region should adopt different urbanization development strategies.The eastern sub-area should rapidly develop the city corridor along the Xijiang mainstream,the central sun-area should actively develop the metropolitan areas such as Nanning Metropolis,and the upstream sub-area should mainly develop characteristic cities.(2) Xijiang waterway development also has strong impacts on the regional urban system and its spatial structure planning.By conducting comprehensive comparison among the three spatial models such as the \"Central Radiation\" model,the \"Golden Triangle\" model and the \"Reverse-T\" model pattern,this paper concludes that the \"Central Radiation\" model,which is proposed by the \"Guangxi Urban System Planning(2006-2020) \",is no long suitable,and the latter two models or their combination are more suitable.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale (BABS) is a semi-structured, clinical interview scale measuring insight/delusionality in problems such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The BABS is widely used, but few studies have examined its psychometric properties in OCD patients; and existing studies have small sample sizes. The present study aimed to establish a Chinese version of the BABS and assess its psychometric properties in a relatively large sample of 171 outpatients with OCD. Results showed that the internal consistency as well as the convergent and divergent validity of the Chinese version of the BABS was acceptable. The ICCs demonstrated good interrater reliability and test-retest reliability and a confirmatory factor analysis supported the original one-factor structure. Moreover, the results provided further evidence that OCD patients’ insight varies widely, and that the Chinese version of the BABS could be used to assess insight/delusionality in OCD.",

        "abstract": "Background. In a two-hit model of hemorrhagic shock and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we previously showed that hypertonic saline (HTS) resuscitation reduced lung sequestration of neutrophils and the accompanying injury. This effect was partially attributed to suppressed expression of the surface adhesion molecule CD11b. This study investigates the duration of this protective effect after a single HTS dose and the usefulness of repeated infusions. Material and Methods. The previous two-hit rodent model was used. Neutrophil lung sequestration was measured by bronchoalveolar fluid cell count. CD11b expression was followed by flow cytometry. In vitro studies used isolated human neutrophils. Results. Eighteen hours following resuscitation, the protective effect of HTS was lost. At this time, LPS caused an increase in both neutrophil lung sequestration and CD11b expression, regardless of the resuscitation regimen used. A second infusion of HTS prevented these changes and restored the lung protection observed earlier. In vitro studies showed that the duration of hypertonic pretreatment is an important determinant of cell responsiveness under the isotonic conditions: Four but not 2 h hypertonic exposure was able to prevent upregulation of CD11b induced by LPS added immediately after reestablishing isotonicity. Conclusions. This study demonstrates that HTS resuscitation lessens lung neutrophil sequestration and CD11b surface expression induced by LPS. This protective effect is transient but can be restored by a second HTS infusion suggesting that maintenance of beneficial effect necessitates repeated HTS addition. The reversibility ensures rapid modulation of neutrophil functions, thereby preventing acute tissue damage without causing long-lasting immunosuppression.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To construct a recombinant bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine (BCG) secreting human interferon α-2a (IFNα-2a). Methods: BCG Ag85B signal sequence was amplified from the genome of BCG by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned in E. coli-BCG shuttle-vector pMV261 to get pMS. The cDNA fragment encoding human IFNα-2a was amplified from the plasmid pBIFNα-2a by using PCR and inserted into the shuttle expression vector pMV261. The recombinant plamid pMSIFNα-2a was identified by restriction endonuclease digestion, PCR amplification and nucleotide sequencing. pMSIFNα-2a was electroporated into BCG to get rBCG. The DNA and protein expressions of IFNα-2a gene in rBCG were determined by PCR and Western blotting respectively. IFNα-2a in the culture supernatant of rBCG was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The recombinant plamid pMSIFNα-2a was constructed successfully and confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis, PCR detection and nucleotide sequencing analysis. pMSIFNα-2a was successfully transformed into BCG by eletroporation and were capable of synthesizing and secreting cytokine IFNα-2a. Western blotting revealed that the secretive proteins could specially combine with antibody against human IFNα-2a. the level of IFNα-2a (324.57 pg/ml) in the culture supernatant of rBCG was higher than control group by ELISA assay. Conclusion: The constructed recombinant BCG strain produces and secretes human IFNα-2a and it will be used in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer.",

        "abstract": "A facile confined solid-state seed-mediated alloying strategy is applied for the rational synthesis of supported Au-Ni bimetallic nanoparticles (BMNPs). The method sequentially deposits nickel salts and AuNP seeds into the ordered array of extra-large mesopores (EP-FDU-12 support) followed by a high-temperature annealing process. The size, structure and composition of the AuNi BMNPs can be well tuned by varying AuNP seeds, annealing temperature and feeding ratio of metal precursors. Kinetic studies and DFT calculations suggest that the introduction of Ni component can significantly prompt the O2 activation on AuNPs, which is critical for the selective alcohol oxidation using molecular O2 as the oxidant. The optimal Au-Ni BMNP catalyst showed the highest TOF (59000 h-1, 240 oC) and highest space time yield of benzyl aldehyde (BAD) productivity (9.23 kg·gAu-1·h-1) in the gas-phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA), which is at least about 5-fold as high as other supported Au catalysts.",

Firstly, the data of land use in the Zhujiang River Delta from 1990 to 2000 are processed. Secondly, we get the composite coefficient of land use in the Delta. According to the value of Lc, we put the land use into 4 types. Thirdly, we try to determine the types of land use using the coupling coefficients of the output value of second industry and tertiary industry to GDP and the urbanization with land use respectively (Llc and LUc). And we can see that the two coupling coefficients and land use composite coefficient show a strong consistency through a comparison, i.e., when Llc < 0.10, the land use belongs to the steady type; when 0.10 < Llc < 1.00, the land use belongs to the comparatively steady type; when 1.00 < LIc < 10.0, the land use mainly belongs to the slow change type and drastic change type; when Llc > 10.0, the land use often belongs to the drastic change type and slow change type. And when LUc < 0.01, the land use is of steady type; when 0.01 < LUc < 0.30, the land use is of the comparatively steady type, when 0.30 < LUc < 1.00, of the slow change type and drastic change type; and when LUc > 1.00, the land use is mainly the drastic change type and slow change type.",

        "abstract": "Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are one of three subgroups of innate lymphoid cells (ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3), and the major ILC population detected in the lungs. The function of ILC2 in the regulation of lung inflammation remains unclear. In the current study, we explored an important role of ILC2 in protecting lung endothelial cell (EC) from pyroptosis in sepsis-induced acute lung inflammation and the underlying mechanism. Using a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse sepsis model, we demonstrated that IL-33, which is released in response to sepsis, acting through its receptor ST2 mediates ILC2 expansion in the lungs. We further showed that the increased ILC2 in the lungs secrete IL-9, which in turn prevents lung EC from undergoing pyroptosis, a pro-inflammatory cell death form, by attenuating caspase-1 activation. These findings suggest a previously unidentified innate pathway that negatively regulates lung inflammation following sepsis.",

We detected whether these factors express in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tissues to study their correlations with the clinical and pathological characteristics.The expressions of c-MYC, LIN28, SOX2, KLF4, OCT4 and NANOG in 30 RCC patients and 5 non-RCC patients were detected with quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). The data were analyzed with Wilcoxon signed rank sum test and x2 test.In RCC group, c-MYC expression was significantly higher in RCC tissues compared with normal tissues (P < 0.05). The expression levels of OCT4, KLF4, NANOG and SOX2 were significantly lower in RCC tissues compared with normal tissues (P < 0.05). LIN28 expression level was not significant. No difference was observed when it comes to clinical and pathological characteristics such as gender, age, tumor size, cTNM classification and differentiation status (P > 0.05). Also the expression levels of all above factors were not significantly changed in non-RCC group (P > 0.05).The present analysis strongly suggests that altered expression of several stem cell related factors may play different roles in RCC. C-MYC may function as an oncogene and OCT4, KLF4, NANOG and SOX2 as tumor suppressors.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that hemorrhagic shock followed by resuscitation renders patients more susceptible to lung injury by priming for an exaggerated response to a second stimulus, the so-called \"two-hit\" hypothesis. We investigated the role of C-X-C chemokines in mediating the augmented lung inflammation in response to LPS following resuscitated shock. In a rodent model, animals exposed to antecedent shock exhibited enhanced lung neutrophil sequestration and transpulmonary albumin flux in response to intratracheal LPS. This effect correlated with an exaggerated expression of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC) protein and mRNA, but not macrophage-inflammatory protein 2. Strategies designed to inhibit CINC, both anti-CINC Ab and supplementation with the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine, prevented the enhanced neutrophil sequestration, suggesting that CINC played a central role in the enhanced leukocyte accumulation following shock plus LPS treatment. Shock alone increased lung nuclear factor-kappaB expression and augmented the response to LPS. Prevention of this effect by N-acetylcysteine supplementation of the resuscitation fluid implicates a role for oxidant stress in the priming for lung inflammation following shock. Finally, alveolar macrophages recovered from shock-resuscitated animals released more CINC protein in vitro in response to LPS than macrophages from sham animals. Considered together, these findings show that augmented release of CINC, in part from primed alveolar macrophages, contributes significantly to the enhanced lung leukosequestration and transpulmonary albumin flux in response to LPS following resuscitated shock.",

        "abstract": "Alveolar macrophages (AMs) play an important role in the development of posttrauma lung inflammation through initiating polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) migration by direct interactions with PMN, which is in turn mediated by the expression of chemokines and cytokines. We have recently reported that hemorrhagic shock-activated PMN sensitize AM to bacteria LPS for the up-regulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)2; in turn, this TLR2 up-regulation results in the amplification of expression of cytokines and chemokines in the AM in response to the bacterial products LPS and peptidoglycan, associated with enhanced PMN sequestration in the lung. We sought to address the mechanism underlying the augmentation of TLR2 in AM by shock-activated PMN. We found that hemorrhagic shock/resuscitation (shock) followed by a low dose of i.t. LPS markedly increased TLR2 mRNA expression in AM in wild-type (WT) mice. In contrast, in mice lacking the gp91 subunit of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced form) oxidase (gp91) or in neutropenic WT mice, the increase in TLR2 mRNA was attenuated. Coculture of AM with PMN derived from WT-shocked mice caused a significantly higher level of TLR2 expression in the AM in response to LPS. However, this increase in TLR2 expression was less evident when the AMs were cocultured with PMN derived from gp91 mice subjected to shock. The antioxidant polyethylene glycol catalase markedly decreased MyD88-dependent activation of IL-1 receptor associated kinase 4 and TLR2 expression in the AM in response to LPS. Thus, PMN nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced form) oxidase sensitizes hemorrhagic shock-primed AM to LPS, at least in part via enhancing IL-1 receptor associated kinase 4 activity.",

        "abstract": "We have previously shown that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, in the resuscitation fluid after shock prevents lung injury in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by inhibiting chemokine generation by alveolar macrophages in the lung. However, the protection was short-lived. We hypothesized that liposomal (Lip) NAC delivered intratracheally might be delivered directly to the target cells and exert prolonged effect.Sprague-Dawley rats were bled to a blood pressure of 40 mm Hg for 1 hour and resuscitated with shed blood and equal volume of Ringer's lactate. In some studies 500 mg/kg NAC was included in the resuscitation fluid. Thirty minutes later, 150 microl LipNAC (9.4 mg/kg NAC) was given intratracheally. One hour and 18 hours after resuscitation, LPS (30 microg/kg) or saline was given intratracheally. Lung injury was assessed by permeability to (125)I-albumin, bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophils and lung myeloperoxidase. The cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC) expression in the lung was assessed by Northern blot.At the early time point, both NAC and LipNAC protected the lung with the effects in significantly reducing the increases in transpulmonary albumin flux, neutrophil influx and myeloperoxidase in the lungs of shock/LPS rats. However, by the late time point, only LipNAC retained its salutary effect. This correlated well with persistent ability to prevent CINC increase. In addition, Lipalpha-tocopherol (alpha-T) and LipNAC/alpha-T were tested and determined to be effective to protect the lung.Liposomal encapsulation of antioxidants at low dose provides long lasting protection against acute respiratory distress syndrome after shock. This may represent a novel treatment approach.",

        "abstract": "Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) of the liver occurs in many clinical scenarios including trauma, elective surgery, and transplantation. Events initiated by this process can lead to inflammation in the liver, culminating in local injury as well as distant organ dysfunction. Recent studies have suggested that hypertonic saline exerts anti-inflammatory effects, which may be beneficial in preventing organ injury. In the present study, we examine the effect of hypertonic saline on the development of liver inflammation following I/R in both rat and mouse models. Hypertonic pretreatment was shown to prevent liver enzyme release concomitant with a reduction in liver neutrophil sequestration. Hypertonic saline appeared to exert this effect by inhibiting liver tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) generation, an effect that culminated in reduced liver adhesion molecule expression. Hypertonic saline pretreatment was shown to augment liver interleukin 10 (IL-10) expression following I/R, as a potential mechanism underlying its anti-inflammatory effect. To examine the role of IL-10 in the protective effect of hypertonic saline on liver I/R injury, we used a murine model of I/R. In wild type mice, hypertonic pretreatment similarly prevented liver injury induced by I/R. However, in IL-10 knockout animals, hypertonic pretreatment was unable to prevent the liver enzyme release, TNF-alpha generation, or neutrophil sequestration induced by I/R. In conclusion, these findings define a novel mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of hypertonic saline and also suggest a potential clinical role for hyperosmolar solutions in the prevention of liver injury associated with I/R.",

Most of current designs for proteolytic reactors can improve either protease stability or proteolysis efficiency of individual protein(s). However, the desired features such as rapid digestion, larger sequence coverage, and high sensitivity have not been achieved by a single microreactor design for broad range proteins with diverse physical properties. Here, unlike conventional enzyme immobilization strategies, we describe a novel proteolytic nanoreactor based on the unique three-dimensional nanopore structure of our newly synthesized mesoporous silica (MPS), FDU-12, which integrates substrate enrichment, \"reagent-free\" protein denaturation, and efficient proteolytic digestion. In our design, protein substrates were first captured by MPS nanopore structure and were concentrated from the solution. Following the pH change and applying trypsin, the denaturation and concurrent proteolysis of broad-range proteins were efficiently achieved. In minutes, many more sample peptides from the in-nanopore digestion of protein mixtures were detected by mass spectrometry, resulting in the identifications of a broad range of diverse proteins with high sequence coverage. The unique features of FDU-12 nanostructure that allow rapid, complete proteolysis and resulting enhanced sequence coverage of individual proteins were investigated by using Raman spectroscopy and comparative studies with respect to other MPSs.",

It identified the critical constraints of population capacity and analyzed the spatial differentiations of the post-quake development conditions across different regions. The expected levels of urbanization, family incomes and income structures, levels of land output, and the reliance of agricultural population on arable lands are estimated by regions. With these parameters, the population capacities of townships and cities under several scenarios were estimated. According to the status of over-population, the townships and cities were classified and relevant policy suggestions on post-quake resettlement were presented.",

        "abstract": "Hemorrhagic shock (HS) due to major trauma and surgery predisposes the host to the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), including acute lung injury (ALI), through activating and exaggerating the innate immune response. IL-1β is a crucial proinflammatory cytokine that contributes to the development of SIRS and ALI. Lung endothelial cells (EC) are one important source of IL-1β, and the production of active IL-1β is controlled by the inflammasome. In this study, we addressed the mechanism underlying HS activation of the inflammasome in lung EC. We show that high mobility group box 1 acting through TLR4, and a synergistic collaboration with TLR2 and receptor for advanced glycation end products signaling, mediates HS-induced activation of EC NAD(P)H oxidase. In turn, reactive oxygen species derived from NAD(P)H oxidase promote the association of thioredoxin-interacting protein with the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein NLRP3 and subsequently induce inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion from the EC. We also show that neutrophil-derived reactive oxygen species play a role in enhancing EC NAD(P)H oxidase activation and therefore an amplified inflammasome activation in response to HS. The present study explores a novel mechanism underlying HS activation of EC inflammasome and thus presents a potential therapeutic target for SIRS and ALI induced after HS.",

        "abstract": "Nanopore structures have displayed attractive prospects in diverse important applications such as nanopore-based biosensors and enhanced spectroscopy. However, on the one hand, the fabrication techniques to obtain sub-10 nm sized nanopores so far is very limited. On the other hand, the electromagnetic enhancement of nanopores is still relatively low. In this work, using a facile chemical etching strategy on 2D plasmonic Ag nanoparticle supercrystals, fine nanopore arrays with sub-10 nm pore size have been successfully fabricated and a “nanopore-in-nanogap” hybrid plasmon mode has been investigated. An in situ etching and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) detection indicate that novel hybrid plasmon structure may create an enhanced electromagnetic coupling and increase SERS signal at ≈10× magnification. The breaking of plasmon bonding dipolar mode and generation of antibonding-like plasmon mode contribute to this enhanced electromagnetic coupling. The facile etching strategy, as a common approach, may open the doors for the fabrication of nanopores in various compositions for numerous applications.",

        "abstract": "This paper, using the method of substantial evidence research, studies transformations and effects of China's township and village enterprises in the late 20th century based on the field investigated data for seven towns. The transformations of township and village enterprises in China have influenced the town government revenue, employees' wages and welfare and village labor force migration. Results show that, in this connection, the transformation of collective enterprises has played an important role in the private sector's development since the 1990s. One indication is the dramatic decline of the employees in collective enterprises and the increases of employees in private enterprises. On the other hand, the privatization of industrial enterprises created problems for the town government such as the unemployment in collective enterprises and the private enterprises' reduction of profits to the local government. The process of privatizing collective enterprises together with tax reforms caused the main drop in income for townships; the wages of township and village enterprises' employees containing the growth of different degrees, but the increasing range is not very big. The welfare of township and village enterprises' employees obviously did not change, and most workers are engaged in agricultural activity with their families. Sticking to agricultural activities granted them the security to return to farming in case that they lost their nonagricultural jobs. Because the township and village enterprises have come to slow growth, and the private enterprises increased the production by increasing labor time and intensity, the rural enterprises are absorbing less surplus labor force than before.

        "abstract": "It is commonly believed that so far as countries at the early stage of economic development are concerned, capital usually flows from areas with unfavorable conditions to those with favorable conditions, which leads to the Matthew effect and the widening of regional development gap. Inter-bank credit flows are an important form of inter-regional capital flows. This paper used a measuring method to disclose the direction of the inter-bank credit flows between eastern China which has favorable conditions and central and western China which have unfavorable conditions during the period of widening of regional development gaps (1978-2003), and analyzed the causes. It was found that in the years of inter-regional capital flows, no net credit outflows from the underdeveloped areas to the developed areas but the reverse patterns were found. This indicated that the inter-bank credit flow narrowed rather than widened the regional development gap at least to some extent. Further analysis found that the credit control by the Central Government and the changes of market environments formed two periods of inter-bank credit flows before and after 1994 respectively.",

        "abstract": "Hemorrhagic shock (HS) promotes the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and organ injury by activating and priming the innate immune system for an exaggerated inflammatory response through, as of yet, unclear mechanisms. IL-1β also plays an important role in the development of post-HS systemic inflammatory response syndrome and active IL-1β production is tightly controlled by the inflammasome. Pyrin, a protein of 781 aa with pyrin domain at the N-terminal, negatively regulates inflammasome activation through interaction with nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein (NLRP). Expression of pyrin can be induced by LPS and cytokines, and IL-10 is a known potent inducer of pyrin expression in macrophages. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that HS downregulates IL-10 and therefore decreases pyrin expression to promote inflammasome activation and subsequent IL-1β processing and secretion in the lungs. Our results show that LPS, while activating Nlrp3 inflammasome in the lungs, also induced pyrin expression, which in turn suppressed inflammasome activation. More importantly, LPS-mediated upregulation of IL-10 enhanced pyrin expression, which serves, particularly in later phases, as a potent negative-feedback mechanism regulating inflammasome activation. However, HS-mediated suppression of IL-10 expression in alveolar macrophages attenuated the upregulation of pyrin in alveolar macrophages and lung endothelial cells and thereby significantly enhanced inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion in the lungs. This study demonstrates a novel mechanism by which HS suppresses negative-feedback regulation of Nlrp3 inflammasome to enhance IL-1β secretion in response to subsequent LPS challenge and so primes for inflammation.",

In this paper, the location selection behavior of oligopolistic commercial enterprises is analyzed by using a one-dimensional spatial competition model based on the game theory. The economic mechanisms of spatial concentration of commercial enterprises providing differentiated products are explored. Under the circumstances that consumer has diverse preferences, the market demands of differentiated commercial enterprises are interlinked, which leads to economies of scope in the location decision-making of commercial enterprises. It is proved that market cluster is the equilibrium outcome of commercial enterprises’ reaction to consumers’ shopping behavior. It is also found that the commodity prices are relatively higher in equilibrium. Our model not only reveals the formation mechanisms of market cluster, but also can be applied to many phenomena relating to market clusters.",

        "abstract": "Multiple jets ejection in electrospinning has been a major approach to achieving a high production rate of ultrafine fibers, also known as nanofibers. This work studies the effect of solution parameters-including dielectric constant, polarity, conductivity and surface tension-on the jet number and jet evolution in the auxiliary electrode electrospinning approach. The results show that it is easier to generate 2⁻6 jets with short stable jet length (1.7⁻6.9 mm) under low voltage (5.03⁻7.13 kV) when solutions have higher dielectric constant (32.2⁻78.6) and larger surface tension (31.8⁻41.29 mN/m). The influence of solution properties on stable jet length and the influence of applied voltage to produce multiple jets are discussed in detail. This work provides a new perspective for understanding jet evolution and mass production of nanofibers in electrospinning.",

        "abstract": "Gastric cancer is the fourth most common malignancy globally. In order to decrease the dosage and side effects of conventional chemotherapy, and achieve improved benefits from molecular targeted therapy, novel drug delivery systems were developed in the present study. Oxaliplatin-Au-FeO-Herceptin acts as a dual-functional nanoparticles (NPs) conjugate and possesses the capability of human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeting and oxaliplatin delivery. The 8-20 nm Au-FeO were synthesized by decomposing iron pentacarbonyl on the surfaces of Au NPs in the presence of oleic acid and oleylamine. Following being coated with polyethylene glycol, the NPs possessed a ζ-potential of 13.8±1.6 mV and were demonstrated to exhibit no cytotoxicity when Fe concentration is <100 µg/ml via an MTS assay. Mass spectrometry analysis detected a peak at m/z 148,000, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance indicated peaks at δ 3.51 (8.00H, s, 3-H), 2.97-3.02 (3.80H, t, 2-H) and 2.72-2.76 (3.72H, t, 1-H) following successful loading with Herceptin and oxaliplatin probes. A drug release assay via dialysis cassettes demonstrated that 25% of the oxaliplatin was released at pH 8.0, however >58% was released at pH 6.0 following 4 h incubation, indicating its pH-dependent release characteristic. The active targeting feature of oxaliplatin-Au-FeO-Herceptin was verified in a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model containing SGC-7901 cells via detecting aggregated low intensity in T-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, which was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Therefore, oxaliplatin-Au-FeO-Herceptin is a promising multifunctional platform for simultaneous magnetic traceable and HER2 targeted chemotherapy for gastric cancer.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The effect of Ce or La on the hydrothermal stability of Cu-SAPO-34 catalyst was evaluated by the selective catalytic reduction of NO  x   by ammonia (NH 3 -SCR) reaction after hydrothermal aging at 700 °C in 10 vol% H 2 O/air for 10 h. The hydrothermal stability of Cu-SAPO-34 was dramatically enhanced by introducing small amount Ce or La into Cu-SAPO-34. More than 93% NO  x   conversion was maintained over the aged Ce or La modified Cu-SAPO-34 at 175–350 °C, while extremely poor NH 3 -SCR activity was obtained over the aged Cu-SAPO-34.  In situ  diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform spectrum (DRIFTS) results illustrated that the hydrothermal treatment cut off the intrinsic “E-R” reaction route over the Cu-SAPO-34 and opened the new reaction pathway (“L-H” mechanism) over the La modified Cu-SAPO-34 catalyst. Additionally, the introduction of Ce or La effectively mitigated the dealumination progress and restrained the aggregation of copper species over Cu-SAPO-34 during the hydrothermal aging, further maintaining the relatively large specific surface area and uniform pore size distribution. Meanwhile, the incorporation of Ce or La enhanced the redox property and stabilized the surface acid sites of Cu-SAPO-34, further facilitating the adsorption and activation of reactants.",

Using Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province as a case study, we conducted questionnaires with 620 local residents and a logistic regression model to determine aesthetic perceptions and factors affecting these perceptions. We found that local residents in Nujiang hold a relatively high perception of their residential landscapes. A majority of respondents, 75.81%, believe their residential landscapes are beautiful. Eight factors were found to influence the aesthetic perception. In direct influential factors, administrative village located in the protected areas and the standard deviation of the elevation around the administrative village have positive influence; distance from administrative village to county town, the ecological environment has changed in recent years, whether tourism development has a negative impact and wish to live in the city have negative influence. In indirect influential factors, both residential house type and have a television at home have positive influence. Based on these results, we discussed relevant policy suggestions to maintain the aesthetic perceptions held by local residents of their residential landscapes and promote the protection and sustainable development of this valuable landscape in Nujiang.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to characterize changes in the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system produced by the nonbacterial nonendotoxic inflammatory agent zymosan and to determine whether these changes were mediated by enhanced production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Rats were injected intraperitoneally with either zymosan or saline and studied 18 h later. Animals were pretreated with either nonimmune IgG or neutralizing anti-TNF antibody 2 h before zymosan injection. Zymosan increased the plasma concentration of TNF alpha, and this was associated with a decrease (approximately 40%) in the IGF-I concentration in plasma, liver, heart, and brain. The IGF-I content was not altered in skeletal muscle and kidney. Zymosan also increased the concentration of IGF binding protein (BP)-1 in plasma (120%), liver (90%), and muscle (470%). Circulating TNF alpha was not detectable in rats injected with anti-TNF antibody before zymosan. The neutralizing antibody prevented the zymosan-induced reduction in IGF-I in plasma and blunted the decreased observed in liver, but did not alter the decrease in heart or brain. Anti-TNF antibody also attenuated (40-60%) the increased IGFBP-1 in plasma, liver, and muscle observed in zymosan-treated rats. We conclude that zymosan-induced inflammation not only decreases IGF-I in plasma and selected tissues, but also increases IGFBP-1 in plasma, liver, and muscle, and that these alterations are due in large part to the enhanced production of TNF alpha.",

        "abstract": "Infection is a common clinical complication following tissue damage resulting from surgery and severe trauma. Studies have suggested that cell pre-activation by antecedent trauma/tissue damage profoundly impacts the response of innate immune cells to a secondary infectious stimulus. Cell necroptosis, a form of regulated inflammatory cell death, is one of the mechanisms that control cell release of inflammatory mediators from important innate immune executive cells such as macrophages (Mφ), which critically regulate the progress of inflammation. In this study, we investigated the mechanism and role of trauma/tissue damage in the regulation of LPS-induced Mφ necroptosis using a mouse model simulating long-bone fracture. We demonstrate that LPS acting through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 promotes Mφ necroptosis. However, necroptosis is ameliorated by high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release from damaged tissue. We show that HMGB1 acting through cell surface receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) upregulates caveolin-1 expression, which in turn induces caveolae-mediated TLR4 internalization and desensitization to decrease Mφ necroptosis. We further show that RAGE-MyD88 activation of Cdc42 and subsequent activation of transcription factor Sp1 serves as a mechanism underlying caveolin-1 transcriptional upregulation. These results reveal a previous unidentified protective role of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules in restricting inflammation in response to exogenous pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules.",

Herein, by controllably tuning the surface coverage of pyridine on Pt nanoparticles, we successfully achieve bifunctional catalysis in direct methanol fuel cells with simultaneously improved oxygen reduction and methanol oxidation tolerance. More importantly, by combining the experimental results and density functional theory calculations, we reveal that the variation of the activity with the surface coverage of pyridine in these two reactions is due to the competition or cooperation between the electronic and steric effects. Other ligand experiments further confirmed the above conjecture. The stability of the pyridine ligand on Pt was also systematically studied in this paper.",

        "abstract": "Background: Polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) infiltration is a significant contributor to tissue damage in many disease states and is known to occur through an orderly set of events. The endothelial cell adhesion molecule E-selectin is involved in the initial rolling of PMNs on the endothelium at sites of inflammation. We have previously shown that the glutathione depleting agent diethyl maleate (DEM) attenuates lung injury in a rodent model of intratracheal LPS stimulation. We hypothesized that DEM might attenuate E-selectin in LPS-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells as a mechanism underlying this effect. Further, we investigated the role of delayed treatment with DEM on E-selectin expression. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with DEM (100 to 400 μmol/L) before or after LPS stimulation (1 μg/mL). Surface expression of E-selectin was examined using a cellular enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. E-selectin mRNA transcripts were detected by Northern blot analysis. Nuclear factor–κB (NF-κB) activity was detected with gel shift assays. Results: DEM significantly inhibited LPS-induced E-selectin surface expression and mRNA levels in a dose-dependent fashion, with complete inhibition at 250 μmol/L, without affecting cell viability. This inhibitory effect was seen even if DEM was added up to 60 minutes after LPS. DEM inhibited NF-κB nuclear translocation in a manner that mirrored protein and mRNA levels. Conclusions: Delayed treatment with DEM attenuates NF-κB nuclear translocation and E-selectin expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells up to 60 minutes after the onset of LPS stimulation. Thus, DEM may represent an effective intervention for PMN-mediated organ injury even when given after an inflammatory insult. (Surgery 1999;126:286-92.)",

The difference of the distribution orientation leads to the separation\n of the spatial pattern of banking industry, and the change of the distribution orientation leads to the change of spatial\n pattern. The degree of spatial pattern change is subject to the degree of change of distribution orientation, and the scale\n of bank resources in the regions, which supports the distribution orientation variation. Based on these theoretical frameworks,\n some indicators were designed to analyze the pattern change of China’s banking industry and its effects since 1995 under the\n change of the distribution orientation. This paper finds that the orientation of economic benefit maximization driven by market\n causes the banking industry to concentrate in economically developed regions. The government, which does not follow the orientation\n of economic benefit maximization, plays a role of stabilizer. Since the bank branches in the regions with the greatest change\n in bank branch distribution are too few, and regions with the greatest change in bank loan allocation are the regions with\n lots of loans, the pattern change of the banking industry in physical form is not as notable as that in economic form.",

        "abstract": "In response to infection, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) are recruited in the infectious sites, and employ three major strategies to fight against the microbes including phagocytosis, degranulation, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are a meshwork of chromatin fibers mixed with granule-derived antimicrobial peptides and enzymes, which trap and kill the bacteria extracellularly. In this study, by using a mouse sepsis model, we identified a novel mechanism by which NETs induce macrophage (Mϕ) pyroptosis, a caspase-1-dependent regulated cell death. We show that NET-derived HMGB1, acting through RAGE and dynamin-dependent signaling, triggers an intra-Mϕ cascade of molecular events including cathepsin B (CatB) release from the ruptured lysosomes, followed by pyroptosome formation and caspase-1 activation, and subsequent Mϕ pyroptosis. The study further demonstrates that Mϕ pyroptosis augments inflammatory responses following sepsis. These findings shed light on the proinflammatory role of NETs in mediating PMN-Mϕ interaction, which therefore influences the progress of inflammation following infection.",

The diffraction and feedback of the second-order grating are utilized to achieve wavelength stabilization and surface emitting. In the paper, SE-DFB laser with asymmetric waveguide is designed, and the effect of waveguide structures on slope efficiency is discussed. The results show that the slope efficiency of SE-DFB laser with P-asymmetric waveguide is 1.04 W/A which enhances 0.12 W/A than the device with symmetric waveguide. It provides an idea for SE-DFB laser research.",

Chinese human geography upholds the subject’s designation as being integrated and interdisciplinary. Research focuses on interactions between the natural and human spheres of the Earth’s surface, and it is guided by the understanding and effects of the processes of regional sustainable development at different spatial scales. Chinese human geography has innovatively established the following development paradigm: “To be guided by application requirements, refine key issues of the discipline in the course of solving major issues of human geography in national and regional development, and by solving those key issues, to enhance its ability to provide scientific and technological support to serve national and local needs while promoting its own development.” Results from early Chinese human geography studies on land use and agricultural zoning, recent research results on point-axis system models and T-shaped national spatial development patterns, and current research results on territorial function theory and major function oriented zones have all continued and strengthened the mainstream school of Chinese human geography and have avoided the global tendency for human geography to become rapidly human-oriented, while results have been applied at the highest level of decision-making management. Chinese human geography can provide lessons for developing countries and may play a leading role in the future development of global human geography.",

Among which the alternative multilayer structures with high performance of the strain quantum wells are prerequisite in the quantum cascade lasers and vertical cavity lasers. The periodic structure with an appropriate design strain-balanced MQWs are imperative for high performance devices. In present work, the strain compensated InGaAs/GaAsP multiple quantum well structures are developed. By engineering the composition of phosphorus in the barrier layer, i.e., 0.15 at.%, the best performance was achieved with high crystal quality via modulating the indium and phosphorus. Our systematic theoretical and experimental studies are performed upon the strain-balanced values investigations by complementary atomic force microscope and photoluminescence characterizations. The influence of variables on the measurement results and the internal correlated impact factors are discussed in detail. With tailored strain compensated structure, our developed InGaAs/GaAsP MQW opens new opportunities for innovative applications with optimized integration in next-generation diode lasers field.",

        "abstract": "Molecular hydrogen is one of the essential reactants in the chemical industry, and its generation from renewable sources such as biomass materials and water is of great benefit to the future society. Generally, molecular oxygen should be pre-eliminated in the hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) in order to avoid the reverse hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). Here, we report a highly efficient HER from a formaldehyde/water mixture using MgO supported Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs/MgO) as the catalyst and molecular oxygen as a promoter. The HER rate depends almost linearly on the oxygen partial pressure, and the optimal turnover frequency (TOF) of the silver catalyst exceeds 6,600 h–1. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, a surface stabilized MgO/Ag–•OOH complex is suggested to be the main catalytically active species for the HER.",

        "abstract": "Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into multiple cell types including osteoblasts. How this differentiation process is controlled, however, is not completely understood. Here we show that activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) plays a critical role in promoting bone marrow MSC differentiation towards the osteoblast lineage. Ablation of the Atf4 gene blocked the formation of osteoprogenitors and inhibited osteoblast differentiation without affecting the expansion and formation of MSCs in bone marrow cultures. Loss of ATF4 dramatically reduced the level of β-catenin protein in MSCs in vitro and in osteoblasts/osteoprogenitors located on trabecular and calvarial surfaces. Loss of ATF4 did not decrease the expression of major canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling components such as Wnt3a, Wnt7b, Wnt10b, Lrp5, and Lrp6 in MSCs. Furthermore, shRNA knockdown of ATF4 expression decreased the level of β-catenin protein in MC-4 preosteoblasts. In contrast, overexpression of ATF4 increased β-catenin protein levels in MC-4 cells. Finally, ATF4 and β-catenin formed a protein-protein complex in COS-7 cells coexpressing both factors or in MC-4 preosteoblastic cells. This study establishes a new role of ATF4 in controlling the β-catenin protein levels and MSC differentiation towards the osteoblast lineage.",

This study detected RBX1 expression for association with clinical significance (such as clinicopathological data and survival of the patients) in non-muscle-invasive bladder transitional cell carcinoma (NMIBC).A total of 70 primary NMIBC tissue specimens and 24 normal tissue specimens were recruited and analyzed immunohistochemically for expression of RBX1 protein and associated with clinicopathological data and survival of the patients.RBX1 was highly expressed in NMIBC, but was lowly expressed in the normal tissue. RBX1 expression was associated with high tumor grade and advanced clinical stage (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Moreover, patients with high RBX1 expression had shorter recurrence-free survival and progression-free survival rates (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that RBX1 expression is an independent prognostic factor for tumor recurrence and progression of NMIBC (P < 0.05).Overexpression of RBX1 protein contributes to tumor progression and poor prognosis of NMIBC.",

In this study, the hemostatic performance of NZG-JY (natural zeolite granules from Jinyun, China) was evaluated and compared with Quikclot in a lethal rabbit model of complex groin injury. Fifty-six anesthetized rabbits were randomized to three different groups: (1) NZG-JY (n = 19); (2) Quikclot (n = 19); and (3) medical gauze (n = 18). Survival was recorded three hours after the application of the hemostatic agents. The wound healing properties of the survived animals (n = 4 for each group) were observed a week later. The clotting efficiency is 100% for the animals in the NZG-JY and the Quikclot group, while only 5.6% in the gauze group. The mortality in the NZG-JY group (21.0%) is significantly less than that in the Quikclot group (52.6%) and the gauze group (66.7%). A good healing property was achieved in all animals that survived in the NZG-JY group, while three quarters of the animals in the Quikclot group had serious necrotic tissue.NZG-JY significantly decreases the mortality in a lethal rabbit model of complex groin injury and demonstrates good healing properties. © 2012 by the authors.",

        "abstract": "Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a tropical and subtropical plant and susceptible to chilling injury. In this research, a C-repeat binding factor (CBF)-like gene (GenBank accession number JQ339740) has been isolated from cassava, and named as MeCBF1. The full-length DNA of MeCBF1 is 1,037 base pair (bp), without intron. The 5′ untranslated region is 102 bp, the 3′ untranslated region is 239 bp, and the open reading frame is 696 bp encoding 231 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of MeCBF1 contains two CBF conserved motifs of PKK(P/R)AGRxKFxETRHP and DSxWR. The MeCBF1 shows 83 % homology to the CRT/DRE binding factor 1 from Hevea brasiliensis (Accession no. AAY43213.1). However, in cassava, the MeCBF1 target genes showed low similarity to the CBF/DREB regulated genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that the MeCBF1 was highly expressed in stems and leaves, and lowly expressed in roots. In addition, the expression of the MeCBF1 quickly responded to low temperature stress (4 °C). These results suggest that, the MeCBF1 is functional in cassava. Further studies on the MeCBF1 might be helpful to reveal molecular mechanism of cassava’s high sensitivity to low temperature.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In the previous research, we found that thermal treatment at high temperature could induct the re-dispersion of Ni particles on SBA-15 for dry reforming of methane  ( DRM). Here, we aimed to study the re-dispersion behavior of Ni particles of Ni/SBA-15 at different temperatures. The results indicated that the mean Ni particle size of Ni/SBA-15 catalysts were 16.9 nm, 14.5 nm, 7.1 nm and 18.4 nm after thermal treatment at 700 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C and 1000 °C, respectively. It could be seen the optimal inducing temperature of Ni/SBA-15 was at 900 °C. The relatively lower inducing temperature did not drive the re-dispersion of Ni particles sufficiently, while the large Ni particles were formed by re-aggregation of re-dispersive Ni species at relatively higher inducing temperature. After 34 h DRM reaction, encapsulated carbon was formed over the catalyst induced by low temperature and the catalytic performance decreased. However, a slight amorphous carbon was discovered over the catalyst induced at 900 °C with highly dispersion. Interestingly, in spite of a large amount of carbon deposition, the 1000Ni/SBA-15 still maintained excellent catalytic activity.",

        "abstract": "To present our experience in laparoscopic radical cystectomy with extracorporeal urinary diversion for treatment of Chinese bladder cancer patients.Between January 2003 and November 2005, 41 men and 5 women with organ-confined muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder underwent laparoscopic radical cystectomy with the Bricker-type urinary diversion. The age range was 36-71 years. Laparoscopic radical cystectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy were performed using five fan-shaped ports by a transperitoneal approach. An ileal conduit diversion was created through the site of specimen retrieval which was the second port at the region of the right pararectus.46 radical cystectomies with Bricker-type ileal conduits were performed. No conversion to open surgery was necessary. Mean operating time was 220 min (range 120-249 min) for laparoscopic radical cystectomy and 75 min (range 65-120 min) for creating the ileal conduits. Mean estimated blood loss was 276 ml (range 155-567 ml). Two of the 46 patients needed blood transfusion (400 ml each). Mean days to ambulation and oral intake was 4.1 (range 3-5 days) and 3.5 (range 3-6 days), respectively. Mean hospital stay was 17.6 days (range 12-35 days). Mean follow-up was 6.1 months (range 3-19 months). Histopathological examination of the specimens revealed stage T2N0M0 in 18 cases, T3aN0M0 in 14, T3bN0M0 in 9 and T3bN1M0 in 5 (TNM staging). WHO grading: G1 in 2 cases, G2 in 26 cases and G3 in 18 cases. Pelvic metastases appeared in one case and 44 patients are alive and free of disease. Intravenous pyelogram at 3 weeks postoperatively shows no evidence of upper urinary obstruction in 45 patients.Despite technical difficulties, laparoscopic radical cystectomy with Bricker-type urinary diversion is feasible. With more experience in the surgical technique, laparoscopic radical cystectomy with extracorporeal urinary diversion can become an alternative treatment of choice in the selected patients with organ- confined bladder cancer in China.",

In this study, we developed two novel methods to reconstruct the impaired ureter.After ureteral mucosal avulsion in a canine model, ureteral reconstruction was performed in one of three ways: free tabularized peritoneal grafts (group A, n = 6); bladder mucosal grafts (group B, n = 6); or simple stenting technique (control group [n = 3]). At postoperative week 10, evaluation with intravenous urography (IVU) was followed by harvesting of reconstructed ureter segments for pathologic analysis.IVU showed nonvisualization of the collecting system of the affected side and histologic evaluation showed imperforation or stenosis in all animals in the control group. IVU showed good visualization of the reconstructed ureter without stenosis in group A and in most animals in group B. There was a mild dilation but no obvious stenosis in one animal in group B. Microscopically, all the reconstructed ureteral lumens were uniformly lined with transitional epithelium. Extensive neovascularity was evident in the subepithelial layer with a streaming of fibroblasts toward the neomucosa.Replacing the avulsed mucosa in the injured ureter with tubularized peritoneal free grafts or bladder mucosal grafts may be an optimal method to manage avulsion of the ureteral mucosa.",

        "abstract": "For a long time, China has been focusing primarily on pursuing economic growth, with less concern about social and environmental development issues. This may make China's development unsustainable. In contrast to its current economic-oriented approach predominated by economic growth, this research note presents a newly proposed approach of 'major function-oriented zone' (MFOZ) that is designed by our research team and is largely accepted by the central government and incorporated into its 12th Five-Year Plan. This approach tries to rationalise China's regional development and insists that each region should have its unique functions to perform, determined by its own characteristics, conditions and requirements. With this approach, the central government is able to monitor and coordinate regional and local developments, and hence the 'Planning of MFOZ' is seen by the central government as a tool to steer spatial arrangements for the country's long-turn sustainable development. © 2012 Victoria University of Wellington.",

        "abstract": "Background. Liver injury after ischemia/reperfusion is an important cause of morbidity in surgical patients. We have shown that the preconditioning of animals that were subjected to liver ischemia/reperfusion with hypertonic saline solution (HTS) prevented injury by inhibiting Kupffer cell tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production. We postulated that the induction of anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) by HTS might contribute to protection. Methods. Murine thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal exudative macrophages (PEMs) were used to model the effects of HTS on IL-10 release from Kupffer cells. Cells were preconditioned with 500 mOsm HTS (or isotonic saline medium) for 2 hours and then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 μg/mL) or vehicle for 4 hours under isotonic conditions. TNF-α and IL-10 were measured in the culture supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TNF, IL-10, and SOCS-3 messenger RNA expression were assessed by Northern blot. NF-κB activation was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Western blot for IκB degradation. Results. In the absence of LPS, isotonic medium-and HTS-pretreated PEMs produced little IL-10 (24.9 ± 66.0 and 0 pg/mL, respectively); however, stimulation of PEMs with LPS increased IL-10 (134.9 ± 72.2 pg/mL). Preconditioning with HTS significantly augmented LPS-induced IL-10 production, resulting in a 2-fold increase in IL-10 compared with the isotonic solution LPS group (270.7 ± 106.8 pg/mL; P < .01). HTS alone increased IL-10 mRNA levels and markedly augmented levels induced by LPS alone. To determine whether IL-10 accounted for HTS-induced TNF inhibition, cells from IL-10 knockout animals were studied. A lack of IL-10 did not reverse the inhibitory effect of HTS on LPS-induced TNF. NF-κB activation was the same in HTS-and isotonic solution-pretreated groups after LPS. Conclusions. HTS augments IL-10 induction by LPS at the gene level. Although TNF is reduced, it is not causally related to increased IL-10 or altered NF-κB signaling. HTS might exert its beneficial effects by independently modulating pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules, accounting for the potent immunomodulation exerted by HTS in vivo.

The large floating population from outside Tibet has become\n the driving force for urban expansion and the rising of urbanization rate. After analyzing the changes of urban functions\n and spatial structure of urban system in Tibet, this paper argues that before 1995 the urbanization in Tibet was mainly driven\n by administrative function, resulting in certain population migration, whereas in the past decade economic function has become\n the key factor accelerating urban expansion with the market mechanism creating large-scale inflow of population. The floating\n population-based urbanization and high population growth in the agricultural and pastoral areas of Tibet has promoted the\n regional economic prosperity, but exerted resources and environmental pressure and brought some problems for Tibetan culture\n protection at the same time. The conflicts and contradictions between urbanization and the sustainability of natural resources,\n environment and social development have been intensified. Addressing these problems, this paper proposes some countermeasures\n for improving the sustainability of Tibetan urbanization.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to report the experience with verrucous carcinoma of the penis. Six cases of verrucous carcinoma were concluded. The histological and clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of these patients were discussed and current literature reviewed. All the tumors showed exophytic lesions,ranging from 0.4 to 6 cm in the greatest dimension. The tumor located at glans in 3 cases, 2 cases at prepuce and the other invaded to the shaft of penis. The diagnosis were confirmed by biopsy in 3 cases and misdiagnosised for papilloma in 1 cases. Four patients were performed with partial penectomy and 1 patient circumcised, and the other was treated with local resection. Postoperative follow-up of 0.5 to 8 years showed no recurrence and metastasis in all the cases. Verrucous carcinoma of the penis showed an aggressive behavior locally. Cells for the verrucous carcinoma were mostly well differentiated. In conclusion misdiagnosis can be easy to be made by incorrect biopsy. Excellent treatment outcomes can be gained by surgery alone. Surgery should be aimed at organ preservation, and the patients should be carefully followed for recurrence.",

By analysising the investment data from 2006 to 2009 in Wuzhou city, which is the provincal Development-Prioritized Region of Guangxi province, this paper finds that Wuzhou city undertakes the transfer of labor-intensive and resource-intensive industries, and these industries mostly relay on the local resource endowments, most of that come from Guangdong, Guangxi and Fujian and locate in industrial parks. By further analysising, we come to an inclution. Firstly, improvement of openness, enhancement of resource dependent between regions, and improvement of regional accessibility attrates resource-intensive industrial to agglomerate in Wuzhou city. Secondly, the rising cost in eastern region pushes industrial to relacate in western region, while western region has more relaxed environmental pressure. Thirdly, the lowest overall cost of the enterprise location is the dominant factors of industrial transfer at currently so that the local preferential policies can attract foreign investment. Therefore, industries agglomeration of Development-Prioritized Region is affecting by geographic feature attributes, comprehensive cost and industry characteristics.",

The solid solubility of Au in ZnO was found smaller or equal to 1.00 at.% for the ZnO:Au annealed at 350 C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results suggest that Au exists in ZnO:Au with chemical state of AuZnu0027+ while the Au content is 1.00 at.%, once the Au content is larger than 1.00 at.%, Au exists in the ZnO with chemical state of metallic Au in the grain boundary and AuZn1+ in the ZnO:Au. While the incorporation of Au in the ZnO films seem to quench both the band edge and visible emissions of the ZnO films, and the degree of photoluminescence quenching increases with the increasing Au content. PL quenching of the ZnO:Au is attributed to the substitutional doping of Au in the ZnO films, while the degree of quenching may related to the content of metallic Au in the ZnO:Au.",

However, there is limited understanding of the relationship between the functional proteins in the protein corona and the biological identity of the materials. Here we show that the in situ generated thrombin in the protein corona of a Ca-zeolite surface displays a calcium-dependent, unusually high (∼3,000 NIH U/mg) procoagulant activity, which is even stable against antithrombin deactivation. Removing the encapsulated Ca2+ in the zeolites leads to deactivation by antithrombin. Our observations suggest that the thrombin activity can be regulated by the inorganic surface and cations. Most importantly, our discovery indicates the link between the biomolecules in the protein corona and the procoagulant activity of the materials, providing a new molecular basis for the procoagulant mechanism for zeolite hemostatics.",

        "abstract": "The vascular endothelium plays an important role in the regulation of inflammatory responses after trauma and hemorrhage. Interactions of neutrophils with endothelial cells (ECs) contribute to the activation of specific EC responses involved in innate immunity. We have previously reported that oxidants derived from the neutrophil reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase is a critical regulator to EC activation. Our objective was to test the role of neutrophil NADPH oxidase-derived oxidants in mediating and enhancing hemorrhagic shock (HS)-induced activation of lung endothelial NADPH oxidase. Mice were subjected to HS and neutrophil depletion. The mice were also replenished with the neutrophil from NADPH oxidase-deficient mice. The resultant activation of lung NADPH oxidase was analyzed. The in vivo studies were also recapitulated with in vitro neutrophil-EC coculture system. HS induces NADPH oxidase activation in neutrophils and lung through high-mobility group box 1/Toll-like receptor 4-dependent signaling. In neutropenic mice, shock-induced NADPH oxidase activation in the lung was reduced significantly, but was restored upon repletion with neutrophils obtained from wild-type mice subjected to shock, but not with neutrophils from shock mice lacking the gp91(phox) subunit of NADPH oxidase. The findings were recapitulated in mouse lung vascular ECs cocultured with neutrophils. The data further demonstrate that neutrophil-derived oxidants are key factors mediating augmented High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)-induced endothelial NADPH oxidase activation through a Rac1-dependent, but p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-independent, pathway. Oxidant signaling by neutrophil NADPH oxidase is an important determinant of activation of endothelial NADPH oxidase after HS.",

        "abstract": "Gasdermin D (GsdmD) was recently identified as the executioner of pyroptotic inflammatory cell death, and is a substrate for caspases-1 and 11. GsdmD is detrimental in lethal endotoxemia but protective in bacterial sepsis. However, little is known about its role during noninfectious/sterile injuries. In this study, we examined the contribution of GsdmD using WT and GsdmD mice in two models of noninfectious liver injury: hemorrhagic shock with resuscitation (HS/R) and acetaminophen (APAP) overdose. GsdmD mice had significantly increased liver damage at 6 h after HS/R or APAP vs WT, shown by significantly elevated ALT level and extended areas of cell death in liver. Caspase-8, a mediator of multiple cell death pathways, was highly elevated in GsdmD mice after injury. Significantly increased cleavage of caspase-8 and subsequent high levels of apoptosis were found in livers of GsdmD mice after HS/R, a relatively mild ROS-induced liver injury. However, during more severe APAP-mediated ROS-induced liver injury, caspase-8 cleavage in GsdmD liver was inhibited compared with WT, resulting in accumulation of pro-caspase-8 and increased levels of necroptosis. Our findings indicate a novel hepatoprotective role for GsdmD in noninfectious inflammation models via regulation of caspase-8 expression and downstream cell death pathways. The effects of GsdmD protection are likely injury specific and may also depend on injury severity and levels of ROS produced. These data suggest modulation of GsdmD/caspase-8 may be a novel therapeutic option in ROS-mediated liver injury.",

Here we report a hard-templating synthesis of nanoporous calcium phosphate ceramics, which is based on filling the calcium and phosphorus sources into the nanospaces of rod-like ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3). The removal of the carbon template by combustion leads to rod-like nanoporous calcium phosphate bioceramics. They have disordered three-dimensional (3D) interconnected nanopores with diameter of 20–30 nm. The wall thickness is approximately 20–30 nm. Based on nitrogen sorption isotherms, the pore size, surface area and pore volume of this material is ∼30 nm, 27 m 2 g −1 and 0.27 cm 3 g −1 , respectively. Wide-angle XRD and IR measurements reveal that the inorganic walls of products consist of highly crystalline calcium phosphates with main hydroxyapatite phases. In antibiotic charging experiments, these nanoporous bioceramics show a much higher charging capacity (1621 μg g −1 ) than that of commercially available calcium phosphate (100 μg g −1 ), which does not have any nanoporosity. Keywords Hard-templating Nanoporous calcium phosphate ceramics In vitro drug release 1 Introduction In the past decade, significant research efforts have been devoted to achieve materials with well-defined nanostructures for adsorption, catalytic, electronic, and optical applications [1–4] . Calcium phosphate bioceramics (denoted as CPBs) analogous to the mineral component of bones, their biocompatibility and osteoconductive properties make them desirable as implant materials and delivery agents of drug and DNA molecules [5] . Until now, most researches have been focused on the macrostructure process to obtain these biomaterials with various morphologies (films, spheres, etc. ) or macropores for the intergrowth of natural bones [6–12] . However, there are few reports about CPBs with nano- or meso-structures, which may offer some unique properties not exhibited in bulk CPBs [13,14] . For example, the increase in surface area resulted from the nanoporosity might contribute to a carrier's capacity of charging a drug. “Supermolecular-templating” process has been confirmed to be a valuable route to prepare nanoporous/structured inorganic frameworks with diverse composition (including silicas, metals, metal oxides, metal phosphates, and organosilicates) [2,15,16] . However, this process encounters limitations to form CPBs networks, which may be due to the difficulty of efficient control over the crystallization. Here, we report the synthesis of novel nanoporous (20–30 nm) calcium phosphate ceramics (nano-CPBs) with well-defined rod-like morphology based on filling the calcium and the phosphorus source into the nanospaces of rod-like ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) and subsequent removal of carbon templates by combustion (600 °C/air, 5 h) (see Scheme 1 ). As a carrier for charging antibiotics, the storage capacity of these nanoporous biomaterials is 16 times larger than that of non-porous CPBs (non-CPBs) and commercially available CPBs (com-CPBs). 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis Rod-like mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) was prepared by using rod-like mesoporous silica SBA-15 as a template [17] . Rod-like SBA-15 was synthesized by using the block copolymer Pluronic P123 EO 20 PO 70 EO 20 as the template with the addition of inorganic salt, KCl. For the synthesis of rod-like CMK-3, rod-like SBA-15 was impregnated with sucrose in the presence of sulfuric acid, the resulting mixture was dried at 100 °C and subsequently at 160 °C. The obtained sample was carbonized at 900 °C under N 2 atmosphere and finally the silica template was removed by 10 wt.% HF solution to obtain mesoporous carbon. In a typical synthesis of nanoporous calcium phosphates, 0.25 g of the rod-like carbon template (CMK-3) was suspended in 2.0 g of ethanol. To this solution, 3.0 mmol of calcium chloride and 2.0 mmol of OP(OCH 3 ) 3 was added with vigorous stirring in a crucible for 2 h. This suspension was evaporated at 40 °C in air for 2 days. The sample was then aged at 100 °C for 5 h, and calcined at 600 °C in air for 6 h to obtained the final nanoporous products. 2.2 Antibiotic charging experiment In a typical antibiotic charging experiment, norfloxacins were dissolved in a simulated body fluid (SBF) to make a stock solution (30 μg ml −1 ). SBF was prepared by the literature method and buffered to pH 7.4 with tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane and 1.0 M HCl. Kinetic experiments to determine the amount of norfloxacin adsorbed as a function of contact time were conducted by stirring 40 mg of nano-CPBs (1.0 g of non-CPBs and com-CPBs) and 40 ml of stock solution at 37 °C. Samples were withdrawn periodically for immediate analysis and then returned to the mixture. Adsorbed amounts were measured by the difference of the concentration of the antibiotics before and after adsorption using UV adsorption at 274 nm. 2.3 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker D4 ENDEAVOR diffractometer with a scan rate of 1 ° min −1 using Ni-filtered with Cu Kα radiation ( λ = 0.15418 nm). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded on a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 at 77 K. The calcined samples were degassed at 250 °C for 3 h prior to the analysis. Transmission electron micrograph (TEM) images were recorded on JEOL 2011 microscope operated at 200 kV. Sample particles were suspended in ethanol and the suspension was deposited on a copper grid coated with a polymer supported film and carbon. Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) images were recorded on Philips XL30 operated at 20 kV. The ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded at room temperature using a JASCO V-550 spectrophotometer (Japan) equipped with an integrating sphere. The FT-IR spectra were recorded on an AUATAR 360 FT-IR (Nicolet) analyzer (resolution 4 cm −1 ) at ambient temperature, with the samples pressed into disks with KBr. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 a shows the SEM image of mesoporous carbon obtained after the removal of rod-like mesoporous silica SBA-15 template. The rod-like morphology, with average length of ∼1.0 μm, is still retained after the high temperature treatment (900 °C in N 2 ) and the chemical reaction to remove silica frameworks. Combined with small-angle XRD pattern and TEM analysis (not shown), the final product is proved to be 2D hexagonal mesostructure with the space group of p 6 mm , which is typical for the replica of the mesoporous silica SBA-15 powders [17] . From nitrogen sorption isotherms, the pore volume, pore size and surface area of rod-like mesoporous carbons is 1.2 cm 3 g −1 , 3.0 nm, and 1200 m 2 g −1 , respectively. Nano-CPBs are prepared in two steps: (1) partial nanocasting of the calcium and the phosphorus sources into the nanospaces of rod-like mesoporous carbon CMK-3 by an ethanol evaporation process and (2) subsequent removal of carbon frameworks by combustion. Nanocrystals of CPBs formed and aggregated into disordered nanoporous CPBs networks ( Scheme 1 ). SEM images ( Fig. 1 b) show that the morphologies of the final product nano-CPBs have similar rod-like shapes to those of mesoporous carbons. In contrast to the smooth surface of mesoporous carbon CMK-3 rods, the surface of CPBs rods is very rough ( Fig. 1 b). There is no obvious change of the rod length, although the diameter of the rods decreased from the original ∼300 to ∼200 nm, indicating a rough 55% volume shrinkage. This may be due to the incomplete filling of the calcium phosphates. Based on the specific pore volume (1.2 cm 3 g −1 ) of the mesoporous carbon CMK-3 and the density of CPBs (3.1 g cm −3 , for Ca 3 P 2 O 8 ), the CPBs only fill 33% of the nanospaces of mesoporous carbon CMK-3. Increasing the ratio of inorganic precursors to CMK-3 does not further increase the filling percentage, as it results in the growth of CPBs outside the nanospaces of mesoporous carbon CMK-3. TEM images ( Fig. 1 c, inset) reveal that the nano-CPBs have disordered 3D interconnected nanopores with a diameter of 20–30 nm, which is much larger than the diameter (∼8 nm) of the hexagonally arranged carbon-rods of CMK-3. The wall thickness (20–30 nm) of nano-CPBs is also much larger than the pore size of the mesoporous carbon. To understand the role of the carbon templates in the synthesis of nano-CPBs, the CPBs samples were also prepared by a similar solvent evaporation process, in which carbon templates are absent or replaced by block copolymers. In both cases, TEM and SEM images show that the final calcined products are bulk crystals without showing any nanoporosity ( Supplementary material ). These control experiments suggest that it is easy for CPBs to grow into bulk crystals without efficient control of the crystallization. Whereas, the hard templates (rod-like mesoporous carbon CMK-3) can partially prevent the crystallization of CPBs from growing into bulky crystals and generate nanoporosity during the combustion. The energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) reveals that these rod-like bioceramics are composed of non-stoichiometric calcium phosphate (Ca/P molar ratio is 1.47:1). Selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the sample confirms that the products consist of the nanocrystals of CPBs. Wide-angle XRD analysis ( Fig. 2 a ) shows that the main phase of nano-CPBs is hydroxyapatite, similar to previous report [13] . The structural properties have been further investigated by sorption measurements and infrared spectroscopy (IR). Based on nitrogen sorption isotherms ( Fig. 3 ), its pore size, surface area and pore volume is ∼30 nm, 27 m 2 g −1 and 0.27 cm 3 g −1 , respectively. Fig. 4 shows the FT-IR spectrum of the nano-CPBs templated by mesoporous carbon CMK-3, which is a typical spectrum for calcium phosphates. The strong adsorption at 1056 and 566 cm −1 can be assigned to the ν 3 P–O stretching and ν 4 bending mode of the phosphate, respectively. Owing to their biocompatibility and osteoconductive property, CPBs have recently been considered as a potential alternative material for a drug delivery system, which can store and release a therapeutic agent in situ to produce an action associated with the osteoconductivity of CPBs and the effect of the released therapeutic agent [18] . Generally, these drugs could be adsorbed only onto the surface of CPBs for the implant of bones, their accessible surface and volume of these bulk ceramics inherently limit their loading and release characteristics [19] . The increase in surface area, resulting from nanoporosity, of nano-CPBs, might benefit their capacity as a drug carrier. As a comparison, nano-CPBs, non-porous CPBs, prepared in the absence of mesoporous carbon (non-CPBs) and commercially available CPBs (com-CPBs) (Ca/P = 1.5) were used to store an antibiotic (norfloxacin) in the experiments. According to the XRD results, the phase of non-CPBs is mainly hydroxyapatite similar to nano-CPBs, and com-CPBs have hydroxyapatite and β-tricalcium phosphate mixed phases ( Fig. 2 b). TEM and SEM images show that the non-CPBs consist of irregular large monolith-like particles (10–100 μm) with smooth surfaces after milling and the typical particle size of com-CPBs is ∼1 μm. Both com-CPBs and non-CPBs have a very low surface area <5 m 2 g −1 . The antibiotic charging measurements show that the adsorption of norfloxacin on three CPBs samples is very quick. Every sample reaches the adsorption equilibrium within 10 min. The specific storage capacity of nano-CPBs, non-CPBs, and com-CPBs are 1621, 60, 100 μg g −1 , respectively ( Fig. 5 ). As expected, nano-CPBs prepared by using mesoporous carbon as a hard template shows much higher charging amount of norfloxacin (>16 times) than those of non-CPBs and com-CPBs. The charged CPBs were also re-exposed to the SBF to study their release behaviors. All CPBs charged with norfloxacin show a complete (∼95%) and quick (within 30 min) release of the antibiotics ( Fig. 5 , inset). Previous research on macroporous CPBs has reported similar results [12] . The quick release of antibiotics is undesired, and further functionalization of the surface of nano-CPBs is required to achieve controlled release. In summary, rod-like nanoporous calcium phosphate ceramics have been synthesized using hard-templating method. As drug carriers, these nanoporous bioceramics show much higher charging capacity of antibiotics than that of commercially available bulk bioceramics without nanoporosity. Since the morphologies of mesoporous carbons can be efficiently controlled [20] , the control of macrostructures of these novel nanoporous bioceramics can been achieved. This facilitates their future application in biomedicines. Acknowledgments We thank Mr. Calum Dickson for suggestions.
