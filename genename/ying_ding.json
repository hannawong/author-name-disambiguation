        "abstract": "Abstract   The primary goal of the present study is to discover new drug treatments by topology analysis of drug associations and their therapeutic group network. To this end, we collected 19,869 papers dated from 1946 to 2015 that are related to autism treatment from PubMed. We extracted 145 drugs based on MeSH terms and their synonyms (the total number is 6624) within the same ATC classification hierarchy and used them to find drug associations in the collected datasets. We introduced a new topology-driven method that incorporates various network analyses including co-word network, clique percolation, weak component, pathfinding-based analysis of therapeutic groups, and detection of important drug interaction within a clique. The present study showed that the in-depth analysis of the drug relationships extracted from the literature-based network sheds new light on drug discovery research. The results also suggested that certain drugs could be repurposed for autism treatment in the future. In particular, the results indicated that the discovered four drugs such as Tocilizumab, Tacrolimus, Prednisone, and Sulfisoxazole are worthy of further study in laboratory experiments with formal assessment of possible effects on symptoms, which may provide psychologists, physicians, and researchers with data-based scientific hypotheses in autism-drug discovery.",

The accuracy was assessed by the area under the alternative-free response receiver operating characteristic curve; the sensitivity and positive predictive value were calculated.There were 81 colorectal liver metastases in all. Both readers noted higher diagnostic accuracies of the combined set than the other two sets. In the group of small lesions, both readers detected significantly higher sensitivities and positive predictive value on the combined set than the other two sets.The combined set showed higher accuracy and sensitivity, especially significantly higher accuracy and sensitivity on small lesions.",

        "abstract": "This study explores the similarity among six types of scholarly networks aggregated at the institution level, including bibliographic coupling networks, citation networks, cocitation networks, topical networks, coauthorship networks, and coword networks. Cosine distance is chosen to measure the similarities among the six networks. The authors found that topical networks and coauthorship networks have the lowest similarity; cocitation networks and citation networks have high similarity; bibliographic coupling networks and cocitation networks have high similarity; and coword networks and topical networks have high similarity. In addition, through multidimensional scaling, two dimensions can be identified among the six networks: Dimension 1 can be interpreted as citation-based versus noncitation-based, and Dimension 2 can be interpreted as social versus cognitive. The authors recommend the use of hybrid or heterogeneous networks to study research interaction and scholarly communications. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "The rapidly increasing amount of public data in chemistry and biology provides new opportunities for large-scale data mining for drug discovery. Systematic integration of these heterogeneous sets and provision of algorithms to data mine the integrated sets would permit investigation of complex mechanisms of action of drugs. In this work we integrated and annotated data from public datasets relating to drugs, chemical compounds, protein targets, diseases, side effects and pathways, building a semantic linked network consisting of over 290,000 nodes and 720,000 edges. We developed a statistical model to assess the association of drug target pairs based on their relation with other linked objects. Validation experiments demonstrate the model can correctly identify known direct drug target pairs with high precision. Indirect drug target pairs (for example drugs which change gene expression level) are also identified but not as strongly as direct pairs. We further calculated the association scores for 157 drugs from 10 disease areas against 1683 human targets, and measured their similarity using a [Formula: see text] score matrix. The similarity network indicates that drugs from the same disease area tend to cluster together in ways that are not captured by structural similarity, with several potential new drug pairings being identified. This work thus provides a novel, validated alternative to existing drug target prediction algorithms. The web service is freely available at: http://chem2bio2rdf.org/slap.",

        "abstract": "Text mining has been widely used in multiple types of user-generated data to infer user opinion, but its application to microblogging is difficult because text messages are short and noisy, providing limited information about user opinion. Given that microblogging users communicate with each other to form a social network, we hypothesize that user opinion is influenced by its neighbors in the network. In this paper, we infer user opinion on a topic by combining two factors: the user's historical opinion about relevant topics and opinion influence from his/her neighbors. We thus build a topic-level opinion influence model TOIM by integrating both topic factor and opinion influence factor into a unified probabilistic model. We evaluate our model in one of the largest microblogging sites in China, Tencent Weibo, and the experiments show that TOIM outperforms baseline methods in opinion inference accuracy. Moreover, incorporating indirect influence further improves inference recall and f1-measure. Finally, we demonstrate some useful applications of TOIM in analyzing users' behaviors in Tencent Weibo.",

In this paper, we propose a TTR-LDA-Community model which combines the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (LDA) and the Girvan-Newman community detection algorithm with an inference mechanism. The model is then applied to data from Delicious, a popular social tagging system, over the time period of 2005-2008. Our results show that 1) users in the same community tend to be interested in similar set of topics in all time periods; and 2) topics may divide into several sub-topics and scatter into different communities over time. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model and show that the TTR-LDA-Community model is meaningful for understanding communities and outperforms TTR-LDA and LDA models in tag prediction.",

All the patients received conventional radiotherapy at a total dose of 60 Gy (in 30 fractions) for 6 weeks. In DC regimen group, the patients received intravenous infusion of docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) for 1 h on day 1 and DDP (25 mg/m(2) daily) on days 1-3, with every 28 days as one cycle. PF regimen consisted of cisplatin (25 mg/m(2)) on days 1-3 and continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil (500 mg/m(2)) for 5 days, with every 28 days as one cycle. All the patients were suggested to have no less than 2 cycles.The 3-year median survival time in DC regimen was slightly longer than that in PF regimen group (26 vs 23 months, Χ2=3.4041, P=0.065). The same result was also found in the short-term effect and adverse reactions including ?myelosuppression and gastrointestinal reactions. Only the adverse reaction of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis showed a significant difference between the two groups (P=0.049).DC regimen with synchronous radiotherapy is effective and safe for treating advanced esophageal squamous cancer.",

        "abstract": "Social tagging is one of the major phenomena transforming the World Wide Web from a static platform into an actively shared information space. This paper addresses various aspects of social tagging, including different views on the nature of social tagging, how to make use of social tags, and how to bridge social tagging with other Web functionalities; it discusses the use of facets to facilitate browsing and searching of tagging data; and it presents an analogy between bibliometrics and tagometrics, arguing that established bibliometric methodologies can be applied to analyze tagging behavior on the Web. Based on the Upper Tag Ontology (UTO), a Web crawler was built to harvest tag data from Delicious, Flickr, and YouTube in September 2007. In total, 1.8 million objects, including bookmarks, photos, and videos, 3.1 million taggers, and 12.1 million tags were collected and analyzed. Some tagging patterns and variations are identified and discussed. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Much life science and biology research requires an understanding of complex relationships between biological entities (genes, compounds, pathways, diseases, and so on). There is a wealth of data on such relationships in publicly available datasets and publications, but these sources are overlapped and distributed so that finding pertinent relational data is increasingly difficult. Whilst most public datasets have associated tools for searching, there is a lack of searching methods that can cross data sources and that in particular search not only based on the biological entities themselves but also on the relationships between them. In this paper, we demonstrate how graph-theoretic algorithms for mining relational paths can be used together with a previous integrative data resource we developed called Chem2Bio2RDF to extract new biological insights about the relationships between such entities. In particular, we use these methods to investigate the genetic basis of side-effects of thiazolinedione drugs, and in particular make a hypothesis for the recently discovered cardiac side-effects of Rosiglitazone (Avandia) and a prediction for Pioglitazone which is backed up by recent clinical studies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract With the information overload of user-generated content in microblogging, users find it extremely challenging to browse and find valuable information in their first attempt. In this paper we propose a microblogging recommendation algorithm, TSI-MR (Topic-Level Social Influence-based Microblogging Recommendation), which can significantly improve users' microblogging experiences. The main innovation of this proposed algorithm is that we consider social influences and their indirect structural relationships, which are largely based on social status theory, from the topic level. The primary advantage of this approach is that it can build an accurate description of latent relationships between two users with weak connections, which can improve the performance of the model; furthermore, it can solve sparsity problems of training data to a certain extent. The realization of the model is mainly based on Factor Graph. We also applied a distributed strategy to further improve the efficiency of the model. Finally, we use data from Tencent Weibo, one of the most popular microblogging services in China, to evaluate our methods. The results show that incorporating social influence can improve microblogging performance considerably, and outperform the baseline methods.",

Most existing community detection approaches focus on the topology of social connections (e.g., coauthor, citation, and social conversation) without considering their topic and dynamic features. In this paper, we propose two models to detect communities by considering both topic and dynamic features. First, the Community Topic Model (CTM) can identify communities sharing similar topics. Second, the Dynamic CTM (DCTM) can capture the dynamic features of communities and topics based on the Bernoulli distribution that leverages the temporal continuity between consecutive timestamps. Both models were tested on two datasets: ArnetMiner and Twitter. Experiments show that communities with similar topics can be detected and the co-evolution of communities and topics can be observed by these two models, which allow us to better understand the dynamic features of social networks and make improved personalized recommendations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

In this paper, we describe an algorithm called Bio-LDA that uses extracted biological terminology to automatically identify latent topics, and provides a variety of measures to uncover putative relations among topics and bio-terms. Relationships identified using those approaches are combined with existing data in life science datasets to provide additional insight. Three case studies demonstrate the utility of the Bio-LDA model, including association predication, association search and connectivity map generation. This combined approach offers new opportunities for knowledge discovery in many areas of biology including target identification, lead hopping and drug repurposing.",

        "abstract": "Objective To observe the protective effect of Shenqi Injection on the cardiac toxicity caused by the recombinant human endostatin(Endosta)r combined with chemotherapy.Methods A prospective non-randomized case-controlled trial was carried out in 48 patients who had the final diagnosis of malignant tumor of Ⅲ or Ⅳ stage through histopathological examination.The patients were divided into two groups according to the use of Shenqi Injection(research group or Group A)or no(tcontrol group or Group B)during the treatment with endostar combined chemotherapy.Left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF),electrocardiogram(ECG),myocardial enzymogram,plasma troponin Ⅰ(troponin Ⅰ),cardiovascular adverse reaction were evaluated before and after the treatment.Results LVEF was decreased in Group B while increased in Group A,the difference being significant(P < 0.05).The incidence of abnormal electrocardiogram was 41.66 % in Group B and 25.00% in Group A,the difference being insignifican(tP > 0.05).The differences of the increase of myocardial enzymogram and cardiovascular adverse reactions were not significant between two groups(P > 0.05).QOL was improved in Group A(P < 0.05),while the short-term therapeutic effect in Group A was similar to that in Group B(P > 0.05).Conclusion Shenqi Injection exerts certain protective effect on the cardiac adverse reaction caused by endostatin combined chemotherapy,which is mainly shown as maintaining the left ventricular ejection function while having no influence on antitumor effect.",

The mainly involved processes are the sperm generation,and function of the premature or mature sperms.Several Chinese medicines and the prescriptions can attenuate such adverse effects.The reported effects are mainly found in the subjects with gonadal maturity.Henceforth,the effects of Tripterygium wilfordii F and its active components on the premature gonadal system should be reinforced in both basic and clinical studies.",

        "abstract": "Ranking authors is vital for identifying a researcher's impact and standing within a scientific field. There are many different ranking methods (e.g., citations, publications, h-index, PageRank, and weighted PageRank), but most of them are topic-independent. This paper proposes topic-dependent ranks based on the combination of a topic model and a weighted PageRank algorithm. The author-conference-topic (ACT) model was used to extract topic distribution of individual authors. Two ways for combining the ACT model with the PageRank algorithm are proposed: simple combination (I_PR) or using a topic distribution as a weighted vector for PageRank (PR_t). Information retrieval was chosen as the test field and representative authors for different topics at different time phases were identified. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to analyze the ranking difference between I_PR and PR_t. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

It analyzes the evolution of the usage of the most popular tags in each of these three social networks. We find that for different tagging systems, the dynamic features reflect different cognitive processes. At the macro level, the tag growth obeys power-law distribution for all three tagging systems with exponents lower than one. At the micro level, the tag growth of popular resources in all three tagging systems follows a similar power-law distribution. Moreover, we find that the exponents of tag growth varied in different evolving stages of popular individual resources.",

        "abstract": "【Objective】 To investigate the effect of stereotactic radiotherapy(SRT) and whole brain radiotherapy(WBRT) for treatment of local limited brain metastasis(BM) in order to provide evidence for the rational options of SRT and WBRT.【Methods】 From January 2000 to December 2005,60 patients with less than 4 lesions and less than 4 cm tumor volume BMs,were eligible for this retrospective analysis.According to primary tumor category,numbers of BM,whether combining extracranial systemic metastases and chemotherapy,the patients were stratified as WBRT + SRT,SRT alone,or WBRT alone by matched-pairing.A number of treatment results including local control of treated lesions,recurrence of new brain lesions and overall survival were compared between three treatment groups in all patients and subgroups of the patients with different primary tumor category,numbers of BM,whether combining extracranial systemic metastases and chemotherapy,respectively.The significance of local control of treated lesions,recurrence of new brain lesions and overall survival,resulted from χ2 test and Kaplan-Mierer combining with log-rank test,respectively.【Results】For the entire cohort,the local control rate and the recurrence rate of new brain lesions were 80.0%(48/60) and 23.3%(14/60),and the median survival from the end of radiation for BM was 13 months,and the actuarial overall survival rate were 38.1% and 14.3% at 1,2 years,respectively.The local control rates were 95.0%,80.0%,and 60.0% for SRT+WBRT,SRT,and WBRT alone groups respectively(P < 0.05).However,the recurrence rates of new brain lesions were 15.0%,35.0%,and 10.0% for SRT+WBRT,SRT and WBRT alone groups respectively(P < 0.05).The overall median survival were 8,9,and 6 months for the SRT+WBRT,SRT and WBRT groups respectively(P > 0.05).And there was no survival differences by primary tumor category(P > 0.05).But in the patients with solitary BM,the patients receiving SRT+WBRT or SRT had better median survival of 23,16 months compared with 5 months for those receiving WBRT alone(P < 0.05).Similarly,the patients receiving SRT+WBRT or SRT had better median survival of 12,9 months compared with 5 months for those receiving WBRT alone in the patients without extracranial systemic metastases(P < 0.05).【Conclusions】Local control of the treatment for BM is superior with SRT,however,the risk of developing new brain lesions is higher for patients not receiving WBRT.In the patients either with solitary BM or without extracranial systemic metastases,the treatment of SRT combining WBRT can provide superior survival prognosis.",

        "abstract": "Studying scientific collaboration using coauthorship networks has attracted much attention in recent years. How and in what context two authors collaborate remain among the major questions. Previous studies, however, have focused on either exploring the global topology of coauthorship networks (macro perspective) or ranking the impact of individual authors (micro perspective). Neither of them has provided information on the context of the collaboration between two specific authors, which may potentially imply rich socioeconomic, disciplinary, and institutional information on collaboration. Different from the macro perspective and micro perspective, this article proposes a novel method (meso perspective) to analyze scientific collaboration, in which a contextual subgraph is extracted as the unit of analysis. A contextual subgraph is defined as a small subgraph of a large-scale coauthorship network that captures relationship and context between two coauthors. This method is applied to the field of library and information science. Topological properties of all the subgraphs in four time spans are investigated, including size, average degree, clustering coefficient, and network centralization. Results show that contextual subgprahs capture useful contextual information on two authors' collaboration. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The CuS/GAs show outstanding synergies of adsorption and photocatalysis for anionic–cationic dyes degradation, which is attributed to unique network structure and excellent photoelectric properties of GAs. The high degradation ratio of Methyl orange and Methylene blue by synergy are 92% and 99.36%, which are about 4.1 and 3.2 times of that for pure CuS. The flower-like CuS/graphene aerogels resolve the low adsorption saturation problem of GAs and improve the photocatalytic performance of CuS, indicating CuS/GAs could be a promising photocatalyst for wastewater treatment.",

        "abstract": "This study attempted to graft neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor (TrkC) gene modified mesenchymal stem cells (TrkC-MSCs) into the demyelinated spinal cord and to investigate whether electroacupuncture (EA) treatment could promote NT-3 secretion in the demyelinated spinal cord as well as further enhance grafted TrkC-MSCs to differentiate into oligodendrocytes, remyelination and functional recovery. Ethidium bromide (EB) was microinjected into the spinal cord of rats at T10 to establish a demyelinated model. Six groups of animals were prepared for the experiment: the sham, PBS, MSCs, MSCs+EA, TrkC-MSCs and TrkC-MSCs+EA groups. The results showed that TrkC-MSCs graft combined with EA treatment (TrkC-MSCs+EA group) significantly increased the number of OPCs and oligodendrocyte-like cells differentiated from MSCs. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that the oligodendrocyte-like cells differentiated from TrkC-MSCs formed myelin sheaths. Immunofluorescence histochemistry and Western blot analysis indicated that TrkC-MSCs+EA treatment could promote the myelin basic protein (MBP) expression and Kv1.2 arrangement trending towards the normal level. Furthermore, behavioural test and cortical motor evoked potentials detection demonstrated a significant functional recovery in the TrkC-MSCs+EA group. In conclusion, our results suggest that EA treatment can increase NT-3 expression, promote oligodendrocyte-like cell differentiation from TrkC-MSCs, remyelination and functional improvement of demyelinated spinal cord.",

        "abstract": "In this paper,the authors test two local connectivity management methods in AODV routing protocol and find that both of them do wrong link failure detections in some cases.By analyzing the reason of wrong detections,this paper presents an Interrupt Periodically Sending HELLO Messages method of detecting link failure based on AODV of using HELLO messages.When the node is in the status of sending or forwarding data packets,it stops periodically sending HELLO messages.It uses receiving data packets and spurious HELLO messages from MAC layer to update local information.Finally the authors use ns2 network simulator to test this new method,and the result suggests that this method can improve veracity of link failure detection,cut overhead of control packets,and increase efficiency of network transmission,when the topology changes little and most of the nodes are doing transmission.",

        "abstract": "To compare the potential of T1 mapping on gadoxetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for assessing liver function in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).One hundred consecutive patients with known HBV-related HCCs were included. T1 relaxation time and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the liver were measured, and the reduction rate of T1 relaxation time (∆%) was calculated. T1 relaxation time measurements were compared with ADC values according to the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score.Hepatobiliary phase (HBP) and ∆% of T1 relaxation time measurements showed significant correlations with MELD score (rho = 0.571, p &amp;lt; 0.0001; rho = -0.573, p &amp;lt; 0.0001, respectively). HBP and ∆% of T1 relaxation time were significantly different between good (MELD ≤8) and poor liver function (MELD ≥9) (p &amp;lt; 0.0001 for both). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of T1 relaxation time for HBP (AUC 0.84) and ∆% (AUC 0.82) were significantly better than for ADC (AUC 0.53; p &amp;lt; 0.0001).T1 mapping on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI showed promise for evaluating liver function in patients with HBV-related HCC, while DWI was not reliable. HBP T1 relaxation time measurement was equally accurate as ∆% measurement.• T 1 mapping on Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI was accurate for assessing liver function. • HBP T 1 relaxation time measurement was as accurate as ∆% T 1 • T 1 mapping on Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI was more accurate than DWI-ADC measurement.",

A dual flip angle three-dimensional gradient echo sequence with volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination was performed before and at 20 min [hepatobiliary phase (HBP)] after Gd-EOB-DTPA administration. Besides, early dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was performed for 4.32 min with a temporal resolution of 2.2 s. T1 relaxation times of liver parenchyma were measured and perfusion parameters were calculated.Dilatation of intra-hepatic bile duct was found only in the BDL-14d group. HBP T1 relaxation times of the BDL-5d and BDL-14d groups were significantly prolonged (p &amp;lt; 0.001) and the enhancement slope percentage of BDL-5d and BDL-14d groups were significantly lowered in comparison with that of the N group (p &amp;lt; 0.001). There were no differences between the BDL-5d group and the BDL-14d group for HBP T1 relaxation times and the enhancement slope percentage (p &amp;gt; 0.05). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of HBP T1 relaxation time and the enhancement slope percentage for the selection of chelostatic liver were 0.98 and 0.92 for the BDL-5d group, and 0.96 and 0.98 for the BDL-14d group, respectively.HBP T1 relaxation time measurement in combination with first-pass enhancement slope percentage withhold promise to assess extrahepatic chelostatic liver injury.",

The 33 patients in groups A received 3DCRT at the total dose of 66 to 70 Gy in 33 to 35 fractions, and the 35 patents in group B received stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) at the dose of 20 Gy in 4 fractions (500 cGy per fraction every other day) after 60 Gy 3DCRT.The total response rates in groups A and B were 56.3% and 80.0%, with the complete remission rates of 9.4% and 28.6%, respectively, both showing significant differences between the two groups (P<0.05). The 1- and 2-year survival rates of the patients in group A were 65.6% and 46.8%, respectively, which were comparable to those in group B (74.3% and 51.4%, respectively, P>0.05). The median survival time in groups A and B were 12.6 and 18.3 months, respectively. The major radiation-induced complications in the two groups included grade I to II acute radiation esophagitis and hematopoietic toxicity. The complications in later stages following the radiation were grade I to II radiation lung fibrosis, occurring at a similar incidence between the two groups.The combination of 3DCRT and SRT produces better therapeutic effects than 3DCRT alone in patients with locally advanced NSCLC.",

        "abstract": "To assess the efficacy and safety of Xifeng Zhidong Tablet (XZT) in treating tic disorder children patients of internal disturbance of Gan-wind with phlegm syndrome (IDGWPS).A stratified randomized, double-blinded, parallel control of placebo, multi-center trial was conducted in 160 subjects from 5 hospitals in China. They were randomly assigned to 2 groups, the test group and the control group, 80 in each group. Those in the test group were treated with XZT, while those in the control group were treated with placebos. The therapeutic course was 4 weeks for all. The effectiveness indicators covered main indicators and secondary indicators. Yale global tic severity scale (YGTSS) was taken as the main indicators. The amelioration of social function impairment, efficacy, single index of Chinese medical syndromes, Chinese medical syndrome efficacy as well as disappearance rate of single Chinese medical symptoms were evaluated as secondary indicators. The safety indicators included clinical adverse events, vital signs, blood/urine/stool routines, renal and liver functions, and electrocardiogram (ECG).As for main indicators, the score of YGTSS decreased from 22.10 +/- 6.38 to 11.34 +/- 6.58 in the test group, while it decreased from 22.65 +/- 6.70 to 16.82 +/- 6.53 in the control group, showing statistical difference when compared with the same group before treatment (P < 0.01). Besides, the decrement was more significant in the test group after treatment (P < 0.05). As for secondary indicators, the total effective rate was 83.54% in the test group and 34.18% in the controlled group, showing statistical difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). As for social function impairment, 20,38, 16, 3, 1 case(s) in the test group were ranked as normal, minimal, mild, moderate, obvious degree, while 1, 24, 45, 7, and 0 case(s) in the control group were ranked as normal, minimal, mild, moderate, obvious degree. Better effect was obtained in the test group (P < 0.05).As for Chinese medical syndrome efficacy, it was 87.34% in the test group and 64.56% in the control group (P < 0.05). As for single index of Chinese medical syndromes, the disappearance rate of motor tics, irritability, dreaminess, abnormal tongue proper,abnormal tongue fur, and abnormal tongue pulse condition was 78.67%, 34.72%, 62.26%, 34.62%, 58.97%, and 39.74%, respectively in the test group, while they were 34.67%, 13.11%, 21.82%, 15.58%, 25.97%, and 19.48%, respectively in the control group. Better results were shown in the test group (P < 0.05). Totally 5 adverse events occurred. The incidence of adverse events was 3.75% in the test group and 2.53% in the control group.After 4 weeks of XZT treatment, the integral of YGTSS could be obviously reduced, the degree of social function impairment ameliorated, and Chinese medical syndromes improved. In addition, no adverse reaction occurred in this study.",

The thyroid status, efficacy and adverse reactions of thyroid treatment were observed in each group.Thyroid dysfunction was found in 73 patients. 40 cases were treated with steroids combined with levothyroxine. Proteinuria, cholesterol and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were significantly higher in patients with thyroid dysfunction, whereas serum albumin and free and total T3 and T4 levels were lower than those of euthyroid patients. The time for proteinuria remission in patients receiving levothyroxine therapy was shorter and their serum albumin higher than for patients without levothyroxine treatment.Thyroid hormonal changes are related to the degree of both proteinuria and serum albumin in patients with INS. Combined treatment with low-dose levothyroxine supplementation and steroids in children with INS and thyroid dysfunction is associated with reduced proteinuria and increased plasma albumin compared with patients treated with steroids only.",

Three algorithms are designed to study the macro- and micro-tag growth as well as the dynamics of taggers' activities, respectively. Moreover, we propose a Tagger Tag Resource Latent Dirichlet Allocation (TTRLDA) model to explore the evolution of topics emerging from those social vocabularies. Our results show that (a) at the macro level, tag growth in all the three tagging systems obeys power law distribution with exponents lower than 1; at the micro level, the tag growth of popular resources in all three tagging systems follows a similar power law distribution; (b) the exponents of tag growth vary in different evolving stages of resources; (c) the growth of number of taggers associated with different popular resources presents a feature of convergence over time; (d) the active level of taggers has a positive correlation with the macro-tag growth of different tagging systems; and (e) some topics evolve into several subtopics over time while others experience relatively stable stages in which their contents do not change much, and certain groups of taggers continue their interests in them.",

        "abstract": "This is the second of a two-part paper to review ontology research and development, in particular, to ontology mapping and evolving. Ontology is a formal explicit specification of a shared conceptualization. Ontology itself is not a static model so that it must have the potential to capture changes of meanings and relations. As such, mapping and evolving ontologies is part of an essential task of ontology learning and development. Ontology mapping is concerned with reusing existing ontologies, expanding and combinin g them by some means and enable a larger pool of information and knowledge in different domains to be integrated to support new communication and use. Ontology evolving, likewise, is concerned with maintaining existing ontologies and extending them as appropriate when new information or knowledge is acquired. It is apparent from the reviews that current researches on semi -automatic or automatic ontology research in all the three aspects of generation, mapping and evolving have so far achieved limited success. Expert human input is essential in almost all cases. Achievements have been largely made in the forms of tools and aids to assist the human expert. Many research challenges remain in this field and many of such challenges need to be overcome if the next generation of semantic web is to be realized in future.",

Patients (108) were randomly assigned to one of two groups to receive either 0.1 mg kg(-1) of dezocine (n = 54; Group D) or saline (n = 54; Group S) intravenously 1 min before 0.3 mg kg(-1) etomidate was given. The occurrence and severity (observational score of 0-3) of myoclonus was assessed for 2 min after administration of etomidate. The incidence and the intensity of myoclonus were significantly lower in Group D (0 %) than in Group S (75.9 %) (P < 0.01), and all patients showed stable cardiovascular profiles. The results suggest that infusion of 0.1 mg kg(-1) dezocine 1 min before etomidate administration is effective for suppressing myoclonus induced by etomidate during induction of general anesthesia without significant side-effects.",

        "abstract": "WTe2 has attracted a great deal of attention because it exhibits extremely large and nonsaturating magnetoresistance. The underlying origin of such a giant magnetoresistance is still under debate. Utilizing laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with high energy and momentum resolutions, we reveal the complete electronic structure of WTe2. This makes it possible to determine accurately the electron and hole concentrations and their temperature dependence. We find that, with increasing the temperature, the overall electron concentration increases while the total hole concentration decreases. It indicates that the electron-hole compensation, if it exists, can only occur in a narrow temperature range, and in most of the temperature range there is an electron-hole imbalance. Our results are not consistent with the perfect electron-hole compensation picture that is commonly considered to be the cause of the unusual magnetoresistance in WTe2. We identified a flat band near the Brillouin zone center that is close to the Fermi level and exhibits a pronounced temperature dependence. Such a flat band can play an important role in dictating the transport properties of WTe2. Our results provide new insight on understanding the origin of the unusual magnetoresistance in WTe2.",

        "abstract": "Ranking scientific productivity and prestige are often limited to homogeneous networks. These networks are unable to account for the multiple factors that constitute the scholarly communication and reward system. This study proposes a new informetric indicator, P-Rank, for measuring prestige in heterogeneous scholarly networks containing articles, authors, and journals. P-Rank differentiates the weight of each citation based on its citing papers, citing journals, and citing authors. Articles from 16 representative library and information science journals are selected as the dataset. Principle Component Analysis is conducted to examine the relationship between P-Rank and other bibliometric indicators. We also compare the correlation and rank variances between citation counts and P-Rank scores. This work provides a new approach to examining prestige in scholarly communication networks in a more comprehensive and nuanced way. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

A novel method for the quantification of henatinib maleate in rat plasma using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry has been developed. The analyte (henatinib maleate) and internal standard (papaverine hydrochloride) were extracted from 50 microL of rat plasma by protein precipitation and separated on a C(18) column using a mixture of 25 mm ammonium acetate buffer : methanol : acetonitrile (35 : 50 : 15, v/v/v) as mobile phase with a run time of 4.5 min. The detection was performed by means of triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI interface operating in the multiple-reaction monitoring mode. A linear response was observed over the concentration range 5.0-1000 ng/mL. The limit of quantification was 5.0 ng/mL. Both intra- and inter-day precision, defined as relative standard deviation, were within 9.7%. Accuracy, defined as relative error, was within +/- 3.1%. The developed method was successfully applied to preclinical pharmacokinetic studies of henatinib maleate in rat after a single oral administration of the drug.",

        "abstract": "Systems chemical biology and chemogenomics are considered critical, integrative disciplines in modern biomedical research, but require data mining of large, integrated, heterogeneous datasets from chemistry and biology. We previously developed an RDF-based resource called Chem2Bio2RDF that enabled querying of such data using the SPARQL query language. Whilst this work has proved useful in its own right as one of the first major resources in these disciplines, its utility could be greatly improved by the application of an ontology for annotation of the nodes and edges in the RDF graph, enabling a much richer range of semantic queries to be issued.We developed a generalized chemogenomics and systems chemical biology OWL ontology called Chem2Bio2OWL that describes the semantics of chemical compounds, drugs, protein targets, pathways, genes, diseases and side-effects, and the relationships between them. The ontology also includes data provenance. We used it to annotate our Chem2Bio2RDF dataset, making it a rich semantic resource. Through a series of scientific case studies we demonstrate how this (i) simplifies the process of building SPARQL queries, (ii) enables useful new kinds of queries on the data and (iii) makes possible intelligent reasoning and semantic graph mining in chemogenomics and systems chemical biology.Chem2Bio2OWL is available at http://chem2bio2rdf.org/owl.

        "abstract": "The main purpose of the Semantic Web is driving the evolution of the current Web by enabling users to find, share, and combine information more easily. OWL ontologies play a key role in this effort. It is widely believed that the majority of current Web data sources are powered by relational databases (RDB). Thus developing approaches and tools for extracting OWL ontologies from RDB is helpful in bridging the gap between the existing Web data sources and the Semantic Web. This paper proposes a formal approach to automatic extraction of OWL ontologies from RDB using database reverse engineering (DBRE) technologies. The DBRE-based approach first identifies different relational structures to capture the natural domain semantics hidden in the relational schemas and data. Then it performs an automatic RDB-to-OWL schema translation by following a set of predefined translation rules that are based on the conceptual correspondences between RDB schema and OWL DL ontology. Our prototype implementation and case studies show that the proposed approach is feasible and effective. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.",

        "abstract": "Objective To assess the overall response rate and toxicity of pemetrexed puls cisplatin in the patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods 52 patients with advanced NSCLC received pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1. One cycle of treatment was 21 days, and the whole treatment lasted for 2 to 6 cycles. Results Among 52 patients, 41 patients were non-squamous cell cancer, 11 patients were squamous cell carcinoma. 1 patient showed complete response, 18 cases showed partial response (PR), 13 cases showed stable disease (SD), 20 cases showed progress disease (PD); the overall response rate was 36.5%, and the disease control rate was 61.5%. There was no significant difference in overall response rate and disease control rate between the age, gender, stage and histology (P >0.05). Among the 52 patients, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.8 months, there was no significant difference in PFS between the patients with and without squamous histology (5.1 months vs 4.4 months, P >0.05); the principal drug-related adverse events were gastrointestinal response and myelosuppression, most of which were grade 1 to 2. Conclusions Pemetrexed plus platinum compunds is safe and effective for the first treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC.",

Co-word analysis was employed to reveal patterns and trends in the IR field by measuring the association strengths of terms representative of relevant publications or other texts produced in IR field. Data were collected from Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) for the period of 1987–1997. In addition to the keywords added by the SCI and SSCI databases, other important keywords were extracted from titles and abstracts manually. These keywords were further standardized using vocabulary control tools. In order to trace the dynamic changes of the IR field, the whole 11-year period was further separated into two consecutive periods: 1987–1991 and 1992–1997. The results show that the IR field has some established research themes and it also changes rapidly to embrace new themes.",

        "abstract": "Expert finding is of vital importance for exploring scientific collaborations to increase productivity by sharing and transferring knowledge within and across different research areas. Expert finding methods, including content-based methods, link structure-based methods, and a combination of content-based and link structure-based methods, have been studied in recent years. However, most state-of-the-art expert finding approaches have usually studied candidates' personal information (e.g. topic relevance and citation counts) and network information (e.g. citation relationship) separately, causing some potential experts to be ignored. In this paper, we propose a topical and weighted factor graph model that simultaneously combines all the possible information in a unified way. In addition, we also design the Loopy Max-Product algorithm and related message-passing schedules to perform approximate inference on our cycle-containing factor graph model. Information Retrieval is chosen as the test field to identify representative authors for different topics within this area. Finally, we compare our approach with three baseline methods in terms of topic sensitivity, coverage rate of SIGIR PC (e.g. Program Committees or Program Chairs) members, and Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain scores for different rankings on each topic. The experimental results demonstrate that our factor graph-based model can definitely enhance the expert-finding performance.",

        "abstract": "Collective classification approaches exploit the dependencies of a group of linked objects whose class labels are correlated and need to be predicted simultaneously. In this paper, we focus on studying the collective classification problem in heterogeneous networks, which involves multiple types of data objects interconnected by multiple types of links. Intuitively, two objects are correlated if they are linked by many paths in the network. By considering different linkage paths in the network, one can capture the subtlety of different types of dependencies among objects. We introduce the concept of meta-path based dependencies among objects, where a meta path is a path consisting a certain sequence of linke types. We show that the quality of collective classification results strongly depends upon the meta paths used. To accommodate the large network size, a novel solution, called HCC (meta-path based Heterogenous Collective Classification), is developed to effectively assign labels to a group of instances that are interconnected through different meta-paths. The proposed HCC model can capture different types of dependencies among objects with respect to different meta paths. Empirical studies on real-world networks demonstrate that effectiveness of the proposed meta path-based collective classification approach.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the influence of aging treatment on fracture behavior of Sn-Pb eutectic solder alloys at different loading rate regime during tensile tests under the scanning electron microscope. In high homologous temperature, the solder exhibit the creep behavior that could be confirmed through the phenomena of grain boundary sliding (GBS) to both as-cast and aged specimens. Owing to the large grain scale after high temperature storage, boundary behavior was limited to some extent for the difficulty in grain rotation and boundary migration. Instead, drastic intragranular deformation occurred. Also, the phase coarsening weakened the combination between lead-rich phase and tin matrix. Consequently, surface fragmentation was detected for the aged specimens. Furthermore, the fracture mechanism changed from intergranular dominated to transgranular dominated with increasing loading rate to both specimens during early stage. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Modeling ontology of folksonomy provides a way of learning light weight ontology’s which is a hot topic investigated recently. Previous approaches for modeling ontology of folksonomy either ignores semantics (synonymy, hyponymy or polysemy) or do not simultaneously consider relationships between actors (users), concepts (tags) and instances(resources) or are based on the idea that title words are responsible for generating tags for resources. Latent semantics and user-tag dependencies instead of user-word dependencies however are extremely important. In this paper we address these problems by introducing a latent topic layer into the traditional tripartite Actor-Concept-Instance graph. We thus propose an Actor-Concept-Instance-Topic (ACIT) approach to model ontology from folksonomy in a unified way by directly using tags and users of resources. We illustrate on Bibsonomy dataset that our proposed approach ACIT outperforms title words based approaches Tag-Topic (TT) and (User-Word-Topic) UWT for modeling the ontology of folksonomy.",

        "abstract": "Semantic Web Technology (SWT) makes it possible to integrate and search the large volume of life science datasets in the public domain, as demonstrated by well-known linked data projects such as LODD, Bio2RDF, and Chem2Bio2RDF. Integration of these sets creates large networks of information. We have previously described a tool called WENDI for aggregating information pertaining to new chemical compounds, effectively creating evidence paths relating the compounds to genes, diseases and so on. In this paper we examine the utility of automatically inferring new compound-disease associations (and thus new links in the network) based on semantically marked-up versions of these evidence paths, rule-sets and inference engines.Through the implementation of a semantic inference algorithm, rule set, Semantic Web methods (RDF, OWL and SPARQL) and new interfaces, we have created a new tool called Chemogenomic Explorer that uses networks of ontologically annotated RDF statements along with deductive reasoning tools to infer new associations between the query structure and genes and diseases from WENDI results. The tool then permits interactive clustering and filtering of these evidence paths.We present a new aggregate approach to inferring links between chemical compounds and diseases using semantic inference. This approach allows multiple evidence paths between compounds and diseases to be identified using a rule-set and semantically annotated data, and for these evidence paths to be clustered to show overall evidence linking the compound to a disease. We believe this is a powerful approach, because it allows compound-disease relationships to be ranked by the amount of evidence supporting them.",

        "abstract": "The parent compounds of the high-temperature cuprate superconductors are Mott insulators. It has been generally agreed that understanding the physics of the doped Mott insulators is essential to understanding the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity. A natural starting point is to elucidate the basic electronic structure of the parent compound. Here we report comprehensive high resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements on Ca$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$, a Mott insulator and a prototypical parent compound of the cuprates. Multiple underlying Fermi surface sheets are revealed for the first time. The high energy waterfall-like band dispersions exhibit different behavior near the nodal and antinodal regions. Two distinct energy scales are identified: a d-wave-like low energy peak dispersion and a nearly isotropic lower Hubbard band gap. These observations provide new information on the electronic structure of the cuprate parent compound, which is important for understanding the anomalous physical properties and superconductivity mechanism of the high temperature cuprate superconductors.",

        "abstract": "Topological quantum materials, including topological insulators and superconductors, Dirac semimetals and Weyl semimetals, have attracted much attention recently for their unique electronic structure, spin texture and physical properties. Very lately, a new type of Weyl semimetals has been proposed where the Weyl Fermions emerge at the boundary between electron and hole pockets in a new phase of matter, which is distinct from the standard type I Weyl semimetals with a point-like Fermi surface. The Weyl cone in this type II semimetals is strongly tilted and the related Fermi surface undergos a Lifshitz transition, giving rise to a new kind of chiral anomaly and other new physics. MoTe2 is proposed to be a candidate of a type II Weyl semimetal; the sensitivity of its topological state to lattice constants and correlation also makes it an ideal platform to explore possible topological phase transitions. By performing laser-based angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements with unprecedentedly high resolution, we have uncovered electronic evidence of type II semimetal state in MoTe2. We have established a full picture of the bulk electronic states and surface state for MoTe2 that are consistent with the band structure calculations. A single branch of surface state is identified that connects bulk hole pockets and bulk electron pockets. Detailed temperature-dependent ARPES measurements show high intensity spot-like features that is ~40 meV above the Fermi level and is close to the momentum space consistent with the theoretical expectation of the type II Weyl points. Our results constitute electronic evidence on the nature of the Weyl semimetal state that favors the presence of two sets of type II Weyl points in MoTe2.",

High resolution angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements are carried out on these samples to investigate the evolution of the Fermi surface topology with doping in the normal state. Clear and complete Fermi surface are observed and quantitatively analyzed in all these overdoped Pb-Bi2201 samples. A Lifshitz transition from hole-like Fermi surface to electron like Fermi surface with increasing doping is observed at a doping level of ~0.35. This transition coincides with the change that the sample undergoes from superconducting to non-superconducting states. Our results reveal the emergence of an electron-like Fermi surface and the existence of a Lifshitz transition in heavily overdoped Bi2201 samples. They provide important information in understanding the connection between the disappearance of superconductivity and the Lifshitz transition in the overdoped region.",

        "abstract": "Stroke is a common disabling disease that severely affects the daily life of patients. Accumulating evidence indicates that rehabilitation therapy can improve movement function. However, no clear guidelines have specific and effective rehabilitation therapy schemes, and the development of new rehabilitation techniques has been relatively slow. This study used a text mining approach, the ABC model, to identify an existing rehabilitation candidate therapy method that is most likely to be repositioned for stroke. In the model, we built the internal links of stroke (A), assessment scales (B), and rehabilitation therapies (C) in PubMed and the links were related to upper limb function measurements for patients with stroke. In the first step, using E-utility, we retrieved both stroke-related assessment scales and rehabilitation therapy records and then compiled two datasets, which were called Stroke_Scales and Stroke_Therapies, respectively. In the next step, we crawled all rehabilitation therapies co-occurring with the Stroke_Therapies and then named them as All_Therapies. Therapies that were already included in Stroke_Therapies were deleted from All_Therapies; therefore, the remaining therapies were the potential rehabilitation therapies, which could be repositioned for stroke after subsequent filtration by a manual check. We identified the top-ranked repositioning rehabilitation therapy and subsequently examined its clinical validation. Hand-arm bimanual intensive training (HABIT) was ranked the first in our repositioning rehabilitation therapies and had the most interaction links with Stroke_Scales. HABIT significantly improved clinical scores on assessment scales [Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and action research arm test (ARAT)] in the clinical validation study for acute stroke patients with upper limb dysfunction. Therefore, based on the ABC model and clinical validation, HABIT is a promising repositioned rehabilitation therapy for stroke, and the ABC model is an effective text mining approach for rehabilitation therapy repositioning. The findings in this study would be helpful in clinical knowledge discovery.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To compare the effects of electric acupuncture(EA) stimulation between Dumai and Jiaji on the neuronal survival and expression of nitric oxide synthase(NOS) at Clarke′s Nucleus(CN) in injured spinal cord. Method:Ten Sprague Dowley(SD) female rats(180-200g) were divided into Dumai EA group and Jiaji EA group. The spinal cord was completed transected in the two groups. At 5th day after operation, the animals of Dumai EA group were performed EA stimulation of Dumai acupoint, while the animals of Jiaji EA group were performed EA stimulation of Jiaji acupoint. At 30th day after EA stimulation, the animals of two groups were perfused and fixed. L1 spinal segment was cut coronally on a cryostat. The activity of NOS in CN neurons of spinal cord was detected by NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry. The number of surviving CN neurons and NOS-expressing neurons was counted respectively in L1 spinal segment. Result:In the Dumai EA group, the number of surviving CN neurons and NOS-expressing neurons was respectively 218.50±7.23 and 8.20±0.82 in L1 spinal segment. In the Jiaji EA group, the number of surviving CN neurons and NOS-expressing neurons was respectively 188.60±6.48 and 17.80±1.79. The number of surviving CN neurons in L1 spinal segment in the Dumai EA group was more than that in the Jiaji EA grou(P<0.05), and the number of NOS-expressing neurons at Clarke′s nucleus in L1 spinal segment in the dumai EA group was less than that in the Jiaji EA group(P<0.05). Conclusion:Compared with EA stimulation of Jiaji acupoint, EA stimulation of Dumai acupoint is a more effective way to promote the survival of neurons and inhibit NOS-expressing of neurons at Clarke′s nucleus in injured spinal cord.",

This study sets out to correlate bibliometric and network measures to identify successful and influential women in the computer science subdomain of semantic web research and identify the impact of their collaboration with both men and other women as part of the their success.",

        "abstract": "Using short focal length lens to get the information of wide-field view always leads to image distortion due the existence of optics distortion. Calibration with optic method is demonstrated quite difficult and expensive. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a new algorithm to calibrate the distortion of optic system using digital image processing technique, called GPU-Based Grid Calibration (GBGC) algorithm. On the bases of programmable Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which adopts CUDA technology, this algorithm solves several lens distortion coefficients, such as radial distortion, centrifugal distortion and thin-prism distortion and so on, by standard grid model. This algorithm can maximize the calibration precision and calibration speed, moreover, accomplish high quality real-time calibration. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of this algorithm, and the calibration precision extends to sub-pixels.",

In the first stage, topic factor and user influence are integrated to generate users' influential relationship based on different topics; in the second stage, users' historical messages and social interaction records are leveraged by TOIM to construct their historical opinions and neighbors' opinion influence through a statistical learning process, which can be further utilized to predict users' future opinions on some specific topics. We evaluate our TOIM on a large-scaled dataset from Tencent Weibo, one of the largest microbloggings website in China. The experimental results show that TOIM can better predict users' opinion than other baseline methods.",

        "abstract": "Transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) promotes functional recovery in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and in a murine model of MS. However, there is only a modicum of information on differentiation of grafted MSCs into oligodendrocyte-like cells in MS. The purpose of this study was to transplant neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and retinoic acid (RA) pre-induced MSCs (NR-MSCs) into a demyelinated spinal cord induced by ethidium bromide (EB), and to investigate whether EA treatment could promote NT-3 secretion in the demyelinated spinal cord. We also sought to determine whether increased NT-3 could further enhance NR-MSCs overexpressing TrkC to differentiate into more oligodendrocyte-like cells, resulting in increased remyelination and nerve conduction in the spinal cord. Our results showed that NT-3 and RA increased transcription of the tyrosine receptor kinase C (TrkC) mRNA in cultured MSCs. EA increased NT-3 levels, and promoted differentiation of oligodendrocyte-like cells from grafted NR-MSCs in the demyelinated spinal cord. There was evidence of myelin formation by grafted NR-MSCs. In addition, NR-MSCs transplantation combined with EA treatment (the NR-MSCs+EA group) reduced demyelination and promoted remyelination. Furthermore, the conduction of cortical motor evoked potentials (MEPs) has improved as compared to controls. Together, our data suggest that pre-induced MSC transplantation combined with EA treatment not only increased MSC differentiation into oligodendrocyte-like cells forming myelin sheaths, but also promoted remyelination and functional improvement of nerve conduction in the demyelinated spinal cord.",

        "abstract": "The evolution of the Web has promoted a growing interest in social network analysis, such as community detection. Among many different community detection approaches, there are two kinds that we want to address: one considers the graph structure of the network (topology-based community detection approach); the other one takes the textual information of the network nodes into consideration (topic-based community detection approach). This paper conducted systematic analysis of applying a topology-based community detection approach and a topic-based community detection approach to the coauthorship networks of the information retrieval area and found that: (1) communities detected by the topology-based community detection approach tend to contain different topics within each community; and (2) communities detected by the topic-based community detection approach tend to contain topologically-diverse sub-communities within each community. The future community detection approaches should not only emphasize the relationship between communities and topics, but also consider the dynamic changes of communities and topics.",

        "abstract": "It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2013 ACM International Workshop on Mining Unstructured Big Data using Natural Language Processing, which will be held at ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, CIKM 2013. Unstructured text data is heterogeneous and available in different formats, such as text document, scientific publication, web page, and customer comment. The availability of many big unstructured text datasets enables, while also challenges researchers to discover and explore valuable information/knowledge via different techniques. Mining semantics by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies is an important approach to uncover the \"latent knowledge/semantic\" of the unstructured text data. In the past decade, while a number of NLP based features already successfully used to enhance the performance of the text mining or information retrieval systems, we are also facing some challenges. For instance, most NLP algorithms' computational cost is high, and we can hardly employ them directly to large-scale text data for online systems. In this workshop, we aggregate different but highly related research communities, i.e., \"NLP\", \"Text Mining\" and \"IR\" researchers, to investigate the possible opportunities and challenges in semantic mining problem. Nine very interesting papers, covering semantic analysis, social media mining, real-time information extraction, and etc., will be presented in this workshop. For this workshop, an opportunity is offered to both NLP and text mining research communities to better clarify the opportunities and challenges in NLP based semantic mining for big unstructured text data with their research experience. We also encourage attendees to attend the keynote presentation - \"HathiTrust Data, Opportunities and Challenges for Text Mining and NLP\" by Dr. Beth A. Plale, Director of Data to Insight Center, and Professor at School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University. HathiTrust is a partnership of academic & research institutions, offering a collection of millions of digitized from libraries around the world plus effective API access. We hope that you will find this program interesting and thought-provoking and that the workshop will provide you with a valuable opportunity to share ideas with other researchers and practitioners from institutions around the world.",

Here, we study an optimally doped Bi2Sr2−xLaxCuO6+δ and an overdoped Bi2−yPbySr2CuO6+δ by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). Based on the characteristic features of local STS, three forms of oxygen dopants are identified: interstitial oxygen atoms on the SrO layers, oxygen vacancies on the SrO layers, and interstitial oxygen atoms on the BiO layers. In both samples, the first form dominates the number of oxygen dopants. From the extracted spatial distribution of the oxygen dopants, we calculate the dopant concentrations and estimate the average hole carrier density. The magnitudes of the electronic pseudogap state in both samples are inhomogeneously distributed in space. The statistical analysis on the spatial distributions of the oxygen dopants and the pseudogap magnitude demonstrates that the doped oxygen atoms on the SrO layers tend to suppress the nearby pseudogap magnitude.",

        "abstract": "Representation learning for networks provides a new way to mine graphs. Although current researches in this area are able to generate reliable results of node embeddings, they are still limited to homogeneous networks in which all nodes and edges are of the same type. While, increasingly, graphs are heterogeneous with multiple node- and edge- types in the real world. Existing heterogeneous embedding methods are mostly task-based or only able to deal with limited types of node  edge. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, an edge2vec model is proposed to represent nodes in ways that incorporate edge semantics represented as different edge-types in heterogeneous networks. An edge-type transition matrix is optimized from an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework as an extra criterion of a biased node random walk on networks, and a biased skip-gram model is leveraged to learn node embeddings based on the random walks afterwards. edge2vec is validated and evaluated using three medical domain problems on an ensemble of complex medical networks (more than 10 node- u0026 edge- types): medical entity classification, compound-gene binding prediction, and medical information searching cost. Results show that by considering edge semantics, edge2vec significantly outperforms other state-of-art models on all three tasks.",

        "abstract": "Objective To explore the effect of tripterygium glycosides and administration of Chinese medicine based on differentiation on the coagulation mechanism of Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) in children. Methods Sixty-two children cases of HSPN were randomized into two groups, Chinese medicine group of 32 cases was treated with tripterygium glycosides plus Chinese medicine based on differentiation and Xiangdan Injection, and western medicine group of 30 cases was treated with adrenocortical hormone plus heparin and persantine. The treatment was given 12 weeks of 30 cases. The level of D-dimer (D-D), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), and the level of blood platelet (PLT) before and after treatment of both groups were observed. Results After treatment, the levels of PLT, D-D, PT, and FIB of the Chinese medicine group were lower than those of before treatment (P<0.05). The decrease of PT and D-D after 12 weeks of treatment, and the decrease of FIB after treatment for 4 weeks of the Chinese medicine group were more significant than those of the western medicine group, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusion Tripterygium glycosides and administration of Chinese medicine based on differentiation have influence on the coagulation mechanism of HSPN in children, the improvement of D-D, PT, and FIB is superior to that of the adrenocortical hormone plus heparin and persantine group.",

Integration of these data sources and the identification of patterns that go across them is of critical interest. Initiatives such as Bio2RDF and LODD have tackled the problem of linking biological data and drug data respectively using RDF. Thus far, the inclusion of chemogenomic and systems chemical biology information that crosses the domains of chemistry and biology has been very limitedWe have created a single repository called Chem2Bio2RDF by aggregating data from multiple chemogenomics repositories that is cross-linked into Bio2RDF and LODD. We have also created a linked-path generation tool to facilitate SPARQL query generation, and have created extended SPARQL functions to address specific chemical/biological search needs. We demonstrate the utility of Chem2Bio2RDF in investigating polypharmacology, identification of potential multiple pathway inhibitors, and the association of pathways with adverse drug reactions.We have created a new semantic systems chemical biology resource, and have demonstrated its potential usefulness in specific examples of polypharmacology, multiple pathway inhibition and adverse drug reaction--pathway mapping. We have also demonstrated the usefulness of extending SPARQL with cheminformatics and bioinformatics functionality.",

        "title": "The cognitive structure of Library and Information Science: Analysis of article title words",
        "abstract": "This study comprises a suite of analyses of words in article titles in order to reveal the cognitive structure of Library and Information Science (LIS). The use of title words to elucidate the cognitive structure of LIS has been relatively neglected. The present study addresses this gap by performing (a) co-word analysis and hierarchical clustering, (b) multidimensional scaling, and (c) determination of trends in usage of terms. The study is based on 10,344 articles published between 1988 and 2007 in 16 LIS journals. Methodologically, novel aspects of this study are: (a) its large scale, (b) removal of non-specific title words based on the “word concentration” measure (c) identification of the most frequent terms that include both single words and phrases, and (d) presentation of the relative frequencies of terms using “heatmaps”. Conceptually, our analysis reveals that LIS consists of three main branches: the traditionally recognized library-related and information-related branches, plus an equally distinct bibliometrics/scientometrics branch. The three branches focus on: libraries, information, and science, respectively. In addition, our study identifies substructures within each branch. We also tentatively identify “information seeking behavior” as a branch that is establishing itself separate from the three main branches. Furthermore, we find that cognitive concepts in LIS evolve continuously, with no stasis since 1992. The most rapid development occurred between 1998 and 2001, influenced by the increased focus on the Internet. The change in the cognitive landscape is found to be driven by the emergence of new information technologies, and the retirement of old ones. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Calibration takes advantage of optic method is quite difficult and expensive. A new algorithm is proposed in this paper to calibrate optics system distortion by digital image process technology, called Grid-based Calibration Algorithm (GBC). This algorithm solves several lens distortion coefficients, such as radial distortion, centrifugal distortion and thin-prism distortion and so on, by standard grid model, as a result, maximizes the calibration precision, moreover, accomplishes high quality calibration. The Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of this calibration algorithm, and the calibration precision extends sub-pixels.",

Conclusions Phacoemulsification and folding IOL implantation is an effective and safe method for cataract with high myopia.The cause of its poor PCVA is due to its pathologic change in the fundus and the PCVA becomes worse as its axial length is increasing.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a huge increase in the amount of publicly-available and proprietary information pertinent to drug discovery. However, there is a distinct lack of data mining tools available to harness this information, and in particular for knowledge discovery across multiple information sources. At Indiana University we have an ongoing project with Eli Lilly to develop web-service based tools for integrative mining of chemical and biological information. In this paper, we report on the first of these tools, called WENDI (Web Engine for Non-obvious Drug Information) that attempts to find non-obvious relationships between a query compound and scholarly publications, biological properties, genes and diseases using multiple information sources.We have created an aggregate web service that takes a query compound as input, calls multiple web services for computation and database search, and returns an XML file that aggregates this information. We have also developed a client application that provides an easy-to-use interface to this web service. Both the service and client are publicly available.Initial testing indicates this tool is useful in identifying potential biological applications of compounds that are not obvious, and in identifying corroborating and conflicting information from multiple sources. We encourage feedback on the tool to help us refine it further. We are now developing further tools based on this model.",

Despite the advances of many clustering methods, there are few tailored methods for population-scale scRNA-seq studies. Here, we develop a Bayesian mixture model for single-cell sequencing (BAMM-SC) method to cluster scRNA-seq data from multiple individuals simultaneously. BAMM-SC takes raw count data as input and accounts for data heterogeneity and batch effect among multiple individuals in a unified Bayesian hierarchical model framework. Results from extensive simulation studies and applications of BAMM-SC to in-house experimental scRNA-seq datasets using blood, lung and skin cells from humans or mice demonstrate that BAMM-SC outperformed existing clustering methods with considerable improved clustering accuracy, particularly in the presence of heterogeneity among individuals.",

        "abstract": "There are lots of question-based data elements from the pharmacogenomics research network (PGRN) studies. Many data elements contain temporal information. To semantically represent these elements so that they can be machine processiable is a challenging problem for the following reasons: (1) the designers of these studies usually do not have the knowledge of any computer modeling and query languages, so that the original data elements usually are represented in spreadsheets in human languages; and (2) the time aspects in these data elements can be too complex to be represented faithfully in a machine-understandable way. In this paper, we introduce our efforts on representing these data elements using semantic web technologies. We have developed an ontology, CNTRO, for representing clinical events and their temporal relations in the web ontology language (OWL). Here we use CNTRO to represent the time aspects in the data elements. We have evaluated 720 time-related data elements from PGRN studies. We adapted and extended the knowledge representation requirements for EliXR-TIME to categorize our data elements. A CNTRO-based SPARQL query builder has been developed to customize users' own SPARQL queries for each knowledge representation requirement. The SPARQL query builder has been evaluated with a simulated EHR triple store to ensure its functionalities.",

In the first half of this chapter, we introduce the key statistical components for designing a sound in vivo experiment. Particular emphasis is placed on the issues and designs that pertain to fluorescence imaging studies. Examples representing several popular types of fluorescence imaging experiments are provided as case studies to demonstrate how to appropriately design such studies. In the second half of this chapter, we explain the fundamental statistical concepts and methods used in the data analysis of typical in vivo experiments. We also provide specific examples in in vivo imaging studies to illustrate the key steps of analysis procedure. ",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the influence of aging treatment on deformation behavior of 96.5Sn3.5Ag eutectic solder alloys with lower strain rate (-3 s-1) during tensile tests under the scanning electron microscope. Results showed that because of the existence of Ag3Sn intermetallic particles and the special microstructure of β-Sn phases in Sn3.5Ag solder, grain boundary sliding was not the dominant mechanism any longer for this Pb-free solder. While the interaction of dislocations with the relatively rigid Ag3Sn particles began to dominate. For the as-cast specimen, accompanied by partial intragranular cracks, intergranular fracture along the grain boundaries in Sn-Ag eutectic structure or the interphase boundaries between Sn-rich dendrites and Sn-Ag eutectic phases occurred primarily in early tensile stage. However, the boundary behavior was limited by the large Ag3Sn particles presented along the Sn-rich dendrites boundaries after aging. Plastic flow was observed in large area, and cracks propagated in a transgranular manner across the Sn-dendrites and Sn-Ag eutectic structure. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Objective To assess the value of computed-tomography angiography (CTA) in assessment of hepatic artery of peroperative liver transplantation recipient by multiple spiral CT (MSCT). Methods Seventy-five patients with terminal stage hepatic diseases who anticipated undergoing liver transplantation hospitalized from July 2006 to January 2007 were performed by GE light-speed scanner underwent contrast-enhanced scans. With hepatic artery reconstructions, two radiologists experienced in abdominal radiology assessed the anatomy aberrant of hepatic artery. After the assessment results were compared with the results of surgery in each patient, the sensitivity, specificity, false negative rate and false positive rate of MSCT were analysed. Results Of the 53 patients who were in indication underwent liver transplantation, 15 had hepatic arterial aberrant. Being consistent with the finding of the surgery, the sensitivity, specificity, false negative rate, false positive rate of MSCT were 92.5%, 100%, 7.5% and 0% respectively. Conclusions The preoperative CT images can document important hepatic artery variants that may alter the anticipated surgical produce. MSCT angiography has the advantages of being quick to set up, economy and is a perfect imaging modality.",

The children with henoch-schonlein purpura( HSP) or henoch-schonlein purpura nephritis( HSPN) who treated with TGT under 18 years old and now older than 18 years old( including 18 years old) during January 1998 to December 2010 were selected in our research. The content of follow-up visit included marriage,marriage age,fertility and child health; and unmarried female patients were asked whether they had menstrual abnormalities. The data of the unmarried female patients,including age,clinical classification,TCM syndrome type,initial dose and other related factors that may affect menstrual cycle,was analyzed by using binary logistic regression analysis. A total of 195 patients who met the criteria were followed up in this study,and 26 patients married for more than 1 year. Among the 26 married patients,1 HSP patient had no birth planning due to rheumatoid arthritis,and the remaining 25 patients all had given birth or were pregnant. The 169 unmarried patients included 89 female patients. Among the 89 female patients,4 cases refused to tell the menstrual situations,72 cases had normal menstruation( 84. 7%),13 cases had abnormal menstruation( 15. 3%),and there was no case of amenorrhea. Logistic regression analysis results showed that the age,clinical classification,TCM syndrome type and initial dose had no correlation with abnormal menstruation. Our results demonstrated that TGT has no effect on adulthood fertility among patients who took TGT combined with traditional Chinese medicine during childhood.",

Methods Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to detect the expression of TGF-β and its receptor in 59 cases of primary epithelial ovarian cancer, 35 cases of benign ovarian tumor and 32 cases of normal ovarian tissue. The relationships between them and tissue types, indexing, grading, the appearances of lymph node metastases were analyzed. Results The positive expression rate of TGF-β1 in ovarian cancer was significantly higher than that in normal control group and positive control group (P <0.05). The positive expression rate of T βR-Ⅰin ovarian cancer was lower than the normal control group and positive control group (P <0.05). There was no correlation between expression of TGF-β1 in ovarian cancer and tissue types, but positive correlation with grading and appearance of lymph node metastasis. Conclusions The positive expression rate of TGF-β1 in ovarian cancer is significantly higher than that in normal control group and positive control group, which shows that TGF-β1 has always been involved in and promoted malignant transformation. There is no correlation between expression of TGF-β1 in ovarian cancer and tissue types, but positive correlation with grading and whether the appearance of lymph node metastases effected or not.",

        "abstract": "This research is motivated by studying the progression of age-related macular degeneration where both a covariate and the response variable are subject to censoring. We develop a general framework to handle regression with censored covariate where the response can be different types and the censoring can be random or subject to (constant) detection limits. Multiple imputation is a popular technique to handle missing data that requires compatibility between the imputation model and the substantive model to obtain valid estimates. With censored covariate, we propose a novel multiple imputation-based approach, namely, the semiparametric two-step importance sampling imputation (STISI) method, to impute the censored covariate. Specifically, STISI imputes the missing covariate from a semiparametric accelerated failure time model conditional on fully observed covariates (Step 1) with the acceptance probability derived from the substantive model (Step 2). The 2-step procedure automatically ensures compatibility and takes full advantage of the relaxed semiparametric assumption in the imputation. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the STISI method yields valid estimates in all scenarios and outperforms some existing methods that are commonly used in practice. We apply STISI on data from the Age-related Eye Disease Study, to investigate the association between the progression time of the less severe eye and that of the more severe eye. We also illustrate the method by analyzing the urine arsenic data for patients from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2004) where the response is binary and 1 covariate is subject to detection limit.",

        "abstract": "Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are one of the potential treating tools for multiple sclerosis (MS). Therefore, the cell number and differentiation of OPCs in a demyelinated spinal cord are crucial for improvement of reparative process. In the present study, we investigated whether \"Governor Vessel (GV)\" electro-acupuncture (EA) could efficiently promote increase in cell number and differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes, remyelination and functional recovery in the demyelinated spinal cord. The spinal cord of adult Sprague-Dawley rats was microinjected with ethidium bromide (EB) at T10, to establish a demyelinated model. Six groups of animals were performed for the experiment. After 15 days EA treatment, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) level and number of NG2-positive OPCs were significantly increased. Compared with the sham group, more NG2-positive OPCs were distributed between neurofilament (NF)-positive nerve fibres or closely associated with them in the lesion site and nearby tissue. In rats given longer EA treatment for 30 days, the number of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-positive oligodendrocytes was increased. Concomitantly, the number of newly formed myelins was increased. This was coupled by increase in endogenous oligodendrocyte involved in myelin formation. Furthermore, behavioural test and spinal cord evoked potential detection demonstrated a significant functional recovery in the EA+EB day 30 group. Our results suggest EA treatment can promote NT-3 expression, increase the cell number and differentiation of endogenous OPCs, and remyelination in the demyelinated spinal cord as well as the functional improvement of demyelinated spinal cord.",

Other researchers have looked to the wealth of metadata generated by bookmarking sites on the Social Web. While several existing ontologies have capitalized on the semantics of metadata created by tagging activities, the Upper Tag Ontology (UTO) emphasizes the structure of tagging activities to facilitate modeling of tagging data and the integration of data from different bookmarking sites as well as the alignment of tagging ontologies.

Histogram analyses were performed and mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, 1th, 10th, 50th, 90th, and 99th percentiles were derived. Quantitative histogram parameters were compared between HCCs with and without MVI. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were generated to compare the diagnostic performance of tumor size, histogram analyses of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and MR enhancement.The mean, 1th, 10th, and 50th percentiles of ADC maps, and the mean, variance. 1th, 10th, 50th, 90th, and 99th percentiles of the portal venous phase (PVP) images were significantly different between the groups with and without MVI (P <0.05), with area under the ROC curves (AUCs) of 0.66 to 0.74 for ADC and 0.76 to 0.88 for PVP. The largest AUC of PVP (1th percentile) showed significantly higher accuracy compared with that of arterial phase (AP) or tumor size (P <0.001).MR histogram analyses-in particular for 1th percentile for PVP images-held promise for prediction of MVI of HCC.

        "abstract": "Detecting and monitoring competitors is fundamental to a company to stay ahead in the global market. Existing studies mainly focus on mining competitive relationships within a single data source, while competing information is usually distributed in multiple networks. How to discover the underlying patterns and utilize the heterogeneous knowledge to avoid biased aspects in this issue is a challenging problem. In this paper, we study the problem of mining competitive relationships by learning across heterogeneous networks. We use Twitter and patent records as our data sources and statistically study the patterns behind the competitive relationships. We find that the two networks exhibit different but complementary patterns of competitions. Our proposed model, Topical Factor Graph Model (TFGM), defines a latent topic layer to bridge the two networks and learns a semi-supervised learning model to classify the relationships between entities (e.g., companies or products). We test the proposed model on two real data sets and the experimental results validate the effectiveness of our model, with an average of +46\\% improvement over alternative methods.",

        "abstract": "Social influence in social networks has been extensively researched. Most studies have focused on direct influence, while another interesting question can be raised as whether indirect influence exists between two users who're not directly connected in the network and what affects such influence. In addition, the theory of complex contagion tells us that more spreaders will enhance the indirect influence between two users. The authors' observation of intensity of indirect influence, propagated by n parallel spreaders and quantified by retweeting probability in two Twitter social networks, shows that complex contagion is validated globally but is violated locally. In other words, the retweeting probability increases non-monotonically with some local drops. A quantum cognition based probabilistic model is proposed to account for these local drops.",

        "abstract": "The presence of social networks in complex systems has made networks and community structure a focal point of study in many domains. Previous studies have focused on the structural emergence and growth of communities and on the topics displayed within the network. However, few scholars have closely examined the relationship between the thematic and structural properties of networks. Therefore, this article proposes the Tagger Tag Resource-Latent Dirichlet Allocation-Community model (TTR-LDA-Community model), which combines the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model with the Girvan-Newman community detection algorithm through an inference mechanism. Using social tagging data from Delicious, this article demonstrates the clustering of active taggers into communities, the topic distributions within communities, and the ranking of taggers, tags, and resources within these communities. The data analysis evaluates patterns in community structure and topical affiliations diachronically. The article evaluates the effectiveness of community detection and the inference mechanism embedded in the model and finds that the TTR-LDA-Community model outperforms other traditional models in tag prediction. This has implications for scholars in domains interested in community detection, profiling, and recommender systems. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Social influence in social networks has been extensively researched. Most studies have focused on direct influence, while another interesting question can be raised as whether indirect influence exists between two users who're not directly connected in the network and what affects such influence. In addition, the theory of complex contagion tells us that more spreaders will enhance the indirect influence between two users. Our observation of intensity of indirect influence, propagated by n parallel spreaders and quantified by retweeting probability in two Twitter social networks, shows that complex contagion is validated globally but is violated locally. In other words, the retweeting probability increases non-monotonically with some local drops. A quantum cognition based probabilistic model is proposed to account for these local drops.",

Base on this model, simulation and analysis of the energy loss with different transmitting distances and weather condition were made, in order to provide a theoretical basis for energy analyzing of UV communication system. The simulation results show that short model can not only achieve accelerated ratio of 10 5, but also assure the simulation accuracy. The visibility has little effect on the energy change when communication distance is small; and with distance increasing, the energy attenuation increases rapidly especially under misty weather. That is, the lower the visibility is, the steeper the energy attenuation curve becomes, whereas the more gentle curve becomes.",

        "abstract": "The current drug development paradigm---sometimes expressed as, ``One disease, one target, one drug''---is under question, as relatively few drugs have reached the market in the last two decades. Meanwhile, the research focus of drug discovery is being placed on the study of drug action on biological systems as a whole, rather than on individual components of such systems. The vast amount of biological information about genes and proteins and their modulation by small molecules is pushing drug discovery to its next critical steps, involving the integration of chemical knowledge with these biological databases. Systematic integration of these heterogeneous datasets and the provision of algorithms to mine the integrated datasets would enable investigation of the complex mechanisms of drug action; however, traditional approaches face challenges in the representation and integration of multi-scale datasets, and in the discovery of underlying knowledge in the integrated datasets. The Semantic Web, envisioned to enable machines to understand and respond to complex human requests and to retrieve relevant, yet distributed, data, has the potential to trigger system-level chemical-biological innovations. Chem2Bio2RDF is presented as an example of utilizing Semantic Web technologies to enable intelligent analyses for drug discovery.

        "abstract": "Quantum topological materials, exemplified by topological insulators, three-dimensional Dirac semimetals and Weyl semimetals, have attracted much attention recently because of their unique electronic structure and physical properties. Very lately it is proposed that the three-dimensional Weyl semimetals can be further classified into two types. In the type I Weyl semimetals, a topologically protected linear crossing of two bands, i.e., a Weyl point, occurs at the Fermi level resulting in a point-like Fermi surface. In the type II Weyl semimetals, the Weyl point emerges from a contact of an electron and a hole pocket at the boundary resulting in a highly tilted Weyl cone. In type II Weyl semimetals, the Lorentz invariance is violated and a fundamentally new kind of Weyl Fermions is produced that leads to new physical properties. WTe2 is interesting because it exhibits anomalously large magnetoresistance. It has ignited a new excitement because it is proposed to be the first candidate of realizing type II Weyl Fermions. Here we report our angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) evidence on identifying the type II Weyl Fermion state in WTe2. By utilizing our latest generation laser-based ARPES system with superior energy and momentum resolutions, we have revealed a full picture on the electronic structure of WTe2. Clear surface state has been identified and its connection with the bulk electronic states in the momentum and energy space shows a good agreement with the calculated band structures with the type II Weyl states. Our results provide spectroscopic evidence on the observation of type II Weyl states in WTe2. It has laid a foundation for further exploration of novel phenomena and physical properties in the type II Weyl semimetals.",

The proposed framework is demonstrated using a coauthorship network in the field of computer science. A comparison between DSE and Breadth First Search (BSF)-based subgraph extraction favors DSE in capturing the diversity in interdisciplinary collaboration.

        "abstract": "This work identifies changes in dominant topics in library and information science (LIS) over time, by analyzing the 3,121 doctoral dissertations completed between 1930 and 2009 at North American Library and Information Science programs. The authors utilize latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to identify latent topics diachronically and to identify representative dissertations of those topics. The findings indicate that the main topics in LIS have changed substantially from those in the initial period (1930–1969) to the present (2000–2009). However, some themes occurred in multiple periods, representing core areas of the field: library history occurred in the first two periods; citation analysis in the second and third periods; and information‐seeking behavior in the fourth and last period. Two topics occurred in three of the five periods: information retrieval and information use. One of the notable changes in the topics was the diminishing use of the word library (and related terms). This has implications for the provision of doctoral education in LIS. This work is compared to other earlier analyses and provides validation for the use of LDA in topic analysis of a discipline. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Moving objects and background were regarded as two clusters, and classified the intensity values at the pixels, then adopted the max clusters’ square root arithmetic mean divergence as the threshold selection rule. So the threshold could be automatic update, in order to accomplish exactly and perfectly extract. Simulation results indicate that motion objects can be extract correctly and fast by using the new algorithm, even in the case of dynamic natural environments since they include motions like swaying vegetation, breaking luminance etc.",

The proposed SWP has been demonstrated, tested and evaluated in several different use cases, such as a middle-sized research group portal, a government dataset catalog portal, a patient health center portal and a Linked Open Data portal for bio-chemical data.

Subjective evaluations including sharpness of tumor, sharpness of vessels, strength and homogeneity of fat suppression, and artifacts that were scored using a 4-point scale. The liver-to-lesion contrast was also calculated and compared.Dixon-VIBE with water reconstruction had significantly higher subjective scores than FS-VIBE in strength and homogeneity of fat suppression (< 0.0001) but lower scores in sharpness of tumor (P < 0.0001), sharpness of vessels (P = 0.0001), and artifacts (P = 0.034). The liver-to-lesion contrast on Dixon-VIBE images was significantly lower than that on FS-VIBE (16.6% ± 9.4% vs 23.9% ± 12.1%, P = 0.0001).Dixon-VIBE provides stronger and more homogenous fat suppression than FS-VIBE, while has lower clarity of focal liver lesions in hepatobiliary phase after gadoxetic acid administration.",

Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. Between September 2015 and November 2016, 84 patients (median age, 54 years; range, 29-79 years) with 92 histopathologically confirmed HCCs (40 MVI-positive lesions and 52 MVI-negative lesions) were analyzed. Preoperative MR imaging examinations including diffusion kurtosis imaging (b values: 0, 200, 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 sec/mm) were performed and kurtosis, diffusivity, and apparent diffusion coefficient maps were calculated. Morphologic features of conventional MR images were also evaluated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the relative value of these parameters as potential predictors of MVI. Results Features significantly related to MVI of HCC at univariate analysis were increased mean kurtosis value (P < .001), decreased mean diffusivity value (P = .033) and apparent diffusion coefficient value (P = .011), and presence of infiltrative border with irregular shape (P = .005) and irregular circumferential enhancement (P = .026). At multivariate analysis, mean kurtosis value (odds ratio, 6.25; P = .001), as well as irregular circumferential enhancement (odds ratio, 6.92; P = .046), were independent risk factors for MVI of HCC. The mean kurtosis value for MVI of HCC showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.784 (optimal cutoff value was 0.917). Conclusion Higher mean kurtosis values in combination with irregular circumferential enhancement are potential predictive biomarkers for MVI of HCC.  RSNA, 2017.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we describe the process of mapping researcher information from the Dutch National Academic Research and Collaborations Information System (NARCIS) to the VIVO ontology. Our goal is to use the VIVO ontology to accurately represent these researchers and their organizations, while remaining true to the native language and structure of the Dutch university. To achieve this, we first created an extension ontology to account for differences in the Dutch naming structure and differences in university position description and alignment. Secondly, through the use of language attribute tags, we recorded data in both English and Dutch to achieve better access by both the native Dutch population and the larger English based research community. Finally, we leveraged the SKOS ontology to take advantage of a classification structure, already created by NARCIS, to describe researcher expertise uniformly across the system.",

Fifty topics in arXiv and WoS were generated using an LDA algorithm and then regression models were used to explain 4 types of topic growth patterns. Based on the slopes of the fitted equation curves, the paper redefines the topic trends and popularity. Results show that arXiv and WoS share similar topics in a given domain, but differ in evolution trends. Topics in WoS lose their popularity much earlier and their durations of popularity are shorter than those in arXiv. This work demonstrates that open access preprints have stronger growth tendency as compared to traditional printed publications.",

        "abstract": "Ontology is an important emerging discipline that has the huge potential to improve information organization, management and understanding. It has a crucial role to play in enabling content-based access, interoperability, communications, and providing qualitatively new levels of services on the next generation of Web transformation in the form of the Semantic Web. The issues pertaining to ontology generation, mapping and maintenance are critical key areas that need to be understood and addressed. This timely survey is presented in two parts. This first part reviews the state-of-the-art techniques and work done on semi- automatic and automatic ontology generation, as well as the problems facing these researches. The second complimentary survey is dedicated to ontology mapping and ontology evolving. Through this survey, we identified that shallow information extraction and natural language processing techniques are deployed to extract concepts or classes from free-text or semi-structured data. However, relation extraction is a very complex and difficult issue to resolve and it has turned out to be the main impedance to ontology learning and applicability. Further researches are encouraged to find appropriate and efficient ways to detect or identify relations through semi-automatic automatic means.",

        "abstract": "Superhydrophobic cotton fabrics were prepared by simultaneous incorporation of SiO₂ aerogel particles and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The SiO₂ aerogels were synthesized via acid-base catalyzed sol-gel reaction with methyl trimethoxy silane (MTMS) as the single precursor and oxalic acid and ammonium hydroxide as the catalyst in methanol (MeOH) solution by drying under ambient pressure. The preparation parameters (e.g., MTMS/MeOH molar ratio, oxalic acid/MTMS molar ratio, gelation pH value, and gelation temperature) had great influences on the density and porosity of the SiO₂ aerogel. The obtained SiO₂ aerogel had low density, high porosity and high specific surface area, showing the typical rough mesoporous structure. The prepared bulk SiO₂ aerogel displayed excellent superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle (WCA) of 151.0 ± 0.8°. Superhydrophobic cotton fabric with a WCA of 155.6 ± 0.9° for a 5 L water droplet was successfully obtained by simply coating the PDMS/SiO₂ aerogel composite solution via dip-pad-cure process. This could be attributed to the combination of SiO₂ aerogel particles with porous rough microstructure, high specific surface area and PDMS adhesive layer with low surface energy. The effect of PDMS/SiO₂ aerogel coating treatment on the mechanical strength properties of the cotton fabrics was negligible. This simple approach may pave the potential way for practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Many studies on coauthorship networks focus on network topology and network statistical mechanics. This article takes a different approach by studying micro-level network properties with the aim of applying centrality measures to impact analysis. Using coauthorship data from 16 journals in the field of library and information science (LIS) with a time span of 20 years (1988–2007), we construct an evolving coauthorship network and calculate four centrality measures (closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, degree centrality, and PageRank) for authors in this network. We find that the four centrality measures are significantly correlated with citation counts. We also discuss the usability of centrality measures in author ranking and suggest that centrality measures can be useful indicators for impact analysis. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

So far, the autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in the beta- and gamma-subgroups of proteobacteria have been considered as the most important contributors to ammonia oxidation, but the recent researches indicated that ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are widely distributed in various kinds of ecosystems and quantitatively predominant, playing important roles in the global nitrogen biogeochemical cycling. This paper reviewed the morphological, physiological, and ecological characteristics and the molecular phylogenies of AOA, and compared and analyzed the differences and similarities of the ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) and its encoding genes between AOA and AOB. In addition, the potential significant roles of AOA in nitrogen biogeochemical cycling in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems were summarized, and the future research directions of AOA in applied ecology and environmental protection were put forward.",

Identifying disease subtypes via unsupervised machine learning is the first step towards this goal. In this paper, we extend a sparse -means method towards a meta-analytic framework to identify novel disease subtypes when expression profiles of multiple cohorts are available. The lasso regularization and meta-analysis identify a unique set of gene features for subtype characterization. An additional pattern matching reward function guarantees consistent subtype signatures across studies. The method was evaluated by simulations and leukemia and breast cancer data sets. The identified disease subtypes from meta-analysis were characterized with improved accuracy and stability compared to single study analysis. The breast cancer model was applied to an independent METABRIC dataset and generated improved survival difference between subtypes. These results provide a basis for diagnosis and development of targeted treatments for disease subgroups.",

Based on the premise there is a hidden, but plausible, relationship between an entity in one article and an entity in its citing article, we constructed a GCG network of gene pairs implicitly connected through citation. We compare the performance of this GCG network to a gene-gene (GG) network constructed over the same corpus but which uses gene pairs explicitly connected through traditional co-occurrence. Using 331,411 MEDLINE abstracts collected from 18,323 seed articles and their references, we identify 25 gene pairs. A comparison of these pairs with interactions found in BioGRID reveal that 96% of the gene pairs in the GCG network have known interactions. We measure network performance using degree, weighted degree, closeness, betweenness centrality and PageRank. Combining all measures, we find the GCG network has more gene pairs, but a lower matching rate than the GG network. However, combining top ranked genes in both networks produces a matching rate of 35.53%. By visualizing both the GG and GCG networks, we find that cancer is the most dominant disease associated with the genes in both networks. Overall, the study indicates that the GCG network can be useful for detecting gene interaction in an implicit manner.",

        "abstract": "Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets has good anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities,but its reproductive damage is significant. Previous studies of the research group have found that Cuscutae Semen flavonoids can improve spermatogenic cell damage caused by Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets by regulating spermatogenic cell cycle,apoptosis and related protein expression,but the mechanism of action at the gene level is still unclear. In this study,Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform was applied in transcriptional sequencing of spermatogenic cells of rats after the intervention of Cuscutae Semen flavonoids and Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets. Differentially expressed genes were screened out and the GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes were conducted to explore the mechanism of Cuscutae Semen flavonoids in improving reproductive injury caused by Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets. The results showed that 794 up-regulated genes and 491 down-regulated genes were screened in Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets group compared with the blank group. Compared with Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets,440 up-regulated genes and 784 down-regulated genes were screened in the Cuscutae Semen flavonoids+Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets group. Among them,the gene closely related to reproductive function is DNMT3 L. Analysis of GO function and KEGG signaling pathway enrichment showed that the above differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in cell,cell process,catalytic activity,binding,ovarian steroid synthesis,thyroid hormone and other functions and pathways. The thyroid hormone signaling pathway was the common enrichment pathway of the two control groups. In a word,Cuscutae Semen flavonoids has a good treatment effect on male reproductive damage caused by Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets. The mechanism may be closely related to up-regulation of DNMT3 L genes and intervention of thyroid hormone signaling pathway. At the same time,the discovery of many different genes provides valuable information for study on the mechanism of Cuscutae Semen flavonoids and Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets compatibility decreasing toxicity and increasing efficiency.",

Existing methods that measure topic-based scholarly output are limited to homogeneous networks. This study proposes a new informative metric called Topic-based Heterogeneous Rank (TH Rank) which measures the impact of a scholarly entity with respect to a given topic in a heterogeneous scholarly network containing authors, papers and journals. TH Rank calculates topic-dependent ranks for authors by considering the combined impact of the multiple factors which contribute to an author's level of prestige. Information retrieval serves as the test field and articles about information retrieval published between 1956 and 2014 were extracted from web of science. Initial results show that TH Rank can effectively identify the most prestigious authors, papers and journals related to a specific topic.",

        "abstract": "By means of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we report on the electronic structures of the BiO and SrO planes of the Bi2Sr2CuO6+δ (Bi-2201) superconductor prepared by argon-ion bombardment and annealing. Depending on post annealing conditions, the BiO planes exhibit either a pseudogap (PG) with sharp coherence peaks and an anomalously large gap magnitude of 49 meV or van Hove singularity (vHS) near the Fermi level, while the SrO is always characteristic of a PG-like feature. This contrasts with the Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ (Bi-2212) superconductor where vHS occurs solely on the SrO plane. We disclose the interstitial oxygen dopants (δ in the formulas) as a primary cause for the occurrence of vHS, which are located dominantly around the BiO and SrO planes, respectively, in Bi-2201 and Bi-2212. This is supported by the contrasting structural buckling amplitude of the BiO and SrO planes in the two superconductors. Furthermore, our findings provide solid evidence for the irrelevance of PG to the superconductivity in the two superconductors, as well as insights into why Bi-2212 can achieve a higher superconducting transition temperature than Bi-2201, and by implication, the mechanism of cuprate superconductivity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In unconventional superconductors, it is generally believed that understanding the physical properties of the normal state is a pre-requisite for understanding the superconductivity mechanism. In conventional superconductors like niobium or lead, the normal state is a Fermi liquid with a well-defined Fermi surface and well-defined quasipartcles along the Fermi surface. Superconductivity is realized in this case by the Fermi surface instability in the superconducting state and the formation and condensation of the electron pairs (Cooper pairing). The high temperature cuprate superconductors, on the other hand, represent another extreme case that superconductivity can be realized in the underdoped region where there is neither well-defined Fermi surface due to the pseudogap formation nor quasiparticles near the antinodal regions in the normal state. Here we report a novel scenario that superconductivity is realized in a system with well-defined Fermi surface but without quasiparticles along the Fermi surface in the normal state. High resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission measurements have been performed on an optimally-doped iron-based superconductor (Ba 0.6 K 0.4 )Fe 2 As 2 . We find that, while sharp superconducting coherence peaks emerge in the superconducting state on the hole-like Fermi surface sheets, no quasiparticle peak is present in the normal state. Its electronic behaviours deviate strongly from a Fermi liquid system. The superconducting gap of such a system exhibits an unusual temperature dependence that it is nearly a constant in the superconducting state and abruptly closes at       T    c      . These observations have provided a new platform to study unconventional superconductivity in a non-Fermi liquid system.",

        "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injury not only affects the site of the injury, but can also induce neuronal apoptosis at the spinal cord. However, many acupuncture clinicians still focus only on the injury site, selecting acupoints entirely along the injured nerve trunk and neglecting other regions; this may delay onset of treatment efficacy and rehabilitation. Therefore, in the present study, we compared the clinical efficacy of acupuncture at Governor vessel and local meridian acupoints combined (GV/LM group) with acupuncture at local meridian acupoints alone (LM group) in the treatment of patients with peripheral nerve injury. In the GV/LM group (n = 15), in addition to meridian acupoints at the injury site, the following acupoints on the Governor vessel were stimulated: Baihui (GV20), Fengfu (GV16), Dazhui (GV14), and Shenzhu (GV12), selected to treat nerve injury of the upper limb, and Jizhong (GV6), Mingmen (GV4), Yaoyangguan (GV3), and Yaoshu (GV2) to treat nerve injury of the lower limb. In the LM group (n = 15), only meridian acupoints along the injured nerve were selected. Both groups had electroacupuncture treatment for 30 minutes, once a day, 5 times per week, for 6 weeks. Two cases dropped out of the LM group. A good or excellent clinical response was obtained in 80% of the patients in the GV/LM group and 38.5% of the LM group. In a second study, an additional 20 patients underwent acupuncture with the same prescription as the GV/LM group. Electomyographic nerve conduction tests were performed before and after acupuncture to explore the mechanism of action of the treatment. An effective response was observed in 80.0% of the patients, with greater motor nerve conduction velocity and amplitude after treatment, indicating that electroacupuncture on specific Governor vessel acupoints promotes functional motor nerve repair after peripheral nerve injury. In addition, electromyography was performed before, during and after electroacupuncture in one patient with radial nerve injury. After a single session, the patient's motor nerve conduction velocity increased by 23.2%, indicating that electroacupuncture at Governor vessel acupoints has an immediate therapeutic effect on peripheral nerve injury. Our results indicate that Governor vessel and local meridian acupoints used simultaneously promote functional repair after peripheral nerve injury. The mechanism of action may arise from an improvement of the local microenvironment in injured nervous tissue, as well as immediate effects of Governor vessel and local meridian acupoint stimulation to ensure the continuity between the peripheral and central nervous systems.",

The overall clinical response rate of the patients was 72% with a 1-year survival rate of 68%, median progression-free survival of 8 months, and overall survival of 14 months. The main toxicity was myelosuppression; 7 (32%) patients experienced grade 3/4 neutropenia, and 5 (23%) had grade 3/4 anemia. All the other adverse effects were tolerable and reversible.The TXP regimen is safe and effective for treatment of metastatic NPC, and the results are comparable with those of the reports in recent literatures.",

We selected the 108 most highly cited authors in the information retrieval (IR) area from the 1970s to 2008 to form the author co-citation network. We calculated the ranks of these 108 authors based on PageRank with the damping factor ranging from 0.05 to 0.95. In order to test the relationship between different measures, we compared PageRank and weighted PageRank results with the citation ranking, h-index, and centrality measures. We found that in our author co-citation network, citation rank is highly correlated with PageRank with different damping factors and also with different weighted PageRank algorithms; citation rank and PageRank are not significantly correlated with centrality measures; and h-index rank does not significantly correlate with centrality measures but does significantly correlate with other measures. The key factors that have impact on the PageRank of authors in the author co-citation network are being co-cited with important authors. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The aim of this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was to test our hypothesis that pre-treatment with butorphanol might reduce the incidence and severity of myoclonus induced by etomidate.Patients (108) with American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status I or II were randomly assigned to one of two groups to receive either 0.015 mg/kg of butorphanol (n = 54) or saline (n = 54) intravenously. At two minutes after infusion of butorphanol or saline, 0.3 mg/kg etomidate was given. The occurrence and severity (observational score of 0-3) of myoclonus was assessed during 2 minutes after administration of etomidate. For each patient, blood pressure (BP), saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO₂), and heart rate (HR) were measured.The incidence of myoclonus was significantly lower in Group Butorphanol than in Group Saline (13.0% vs 79.6%; RR = 0.163, 95%CI: 0.081-0.329; χ² = 48.265, p <0.0001). The severity levels of myoclonic movement were also significantly lower in Group Butorphanol than in Group Saline (p <0.0001). Throughout the procedure, changes of BP, SpO₂, and HR did not differ between the groups. There were no problems with bradycardia or hypotension.Infusion of 0.015 mg/kg butorphanol 2 minutes before etomidate administration is effective for suppressing myoclonus induced by etomidate during induction of general anaesthesia.",

        "abstract": "In the past decades, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a promising cell candidate have received the most attention in the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI). However, due to the low survival rate and low neural differentiation rate, the grafted MSCs do not perform well as one would have expected. In the present study, we tested a combinational therapy to improve on this situation. MSCs were loaded into three-dimensional gelatin sponge (GS) scaffold. After 7 days of induction with neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and retinoic acid (RA) in vitro, we observed a significant increase in TrkC mRNA transcription by Real-time PCR and this was confirmed by in situ hybridization. The expression of TrkC was also confirmed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Differentiation potential of MSCs in vitro into neuron-like cells or oligodendrocyte-like cells was further demonstrated by using immunofluorescence staining. The pre-induced MSCs seeding in GS scaffolds were then grafted into the transected rat spinal cord. One day after grafting, Governor Vessel electro-acupuncture (GV-EA) treatment was applied to rats in the NR-MSCs + EA group. At 30 days after GV-EA treatment, it found that the grafted MSCs have better survival rate and neuron-like cell differentiation compared with those without GV-EA treatment. The sustained TrkC expression in the grafted MSCs as well as increased NT-3 content in the injury/graft site by GV-EA suggests that NT-3/TrkC signaling pathway may be involved in the promoting effect. This study demonstrates that GV-EA and pre-induction with NT-3 and RA together may promote the survival and differentiation of grafted MSCs in GS scaffold in rat SCI.",

        "abstract": "This article aims to identify whether different weighted PageRank algorithms can be applied to author citation networks to measure the popularity and prestige of a scholar from a citation perspective. Information retrieval (IR) was selected as a test field and data from 1956–2008 were collected from Web of Science. Weighted PageRank with citation and publication as weighted vectors were calculated on author citation networks. The results indicate that both popularity rank and prestige rank were highly correlated with the weighted PageRank. Principal component analysis was conducted to detect relationships among these different measures. For capturing prize winners within the IR field, prestige rank outperformed all the other measures. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "AIM:To investigate the clinical significance of the new method of modified immunomagnetic enrichment of tumor cells in combination with fluorescent immunocytochemistry to detect circulating tumor cells(CTCs) in peripheral blood samples of patients with nasopharyngeal cancer(NPC).METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 76 histology-proven patients with NPC before the initial therapy.After isolation of the mononuclear cells,the CTCs expressing cytokeratin(CK)8/18 in the blood samples were detected by the method of immunomagnetic enrichment in combination with fluorescent immunocytochemistry.The magnetic beads covalent binding with epithelial cell adhesion molecule(EpCAM) antibody were used to enrich the tumor cells which expressed EpCAM.After median following-up for 25 months,the effects of CTCs and other prognostic factors on patient prognosis were thoroughly investigated.RESULTS: None of the positive CK8/18 cells was detected in 20 normal blood samples.The CTCs were detected in 82.9% of the patients(P<0.01).Relapse patients had significantly higher number of median CK8/18+ CTCs than the patients without relapse(P<0.01).No association of viral capsid antigen(VCA)-IgA(P>0.05) was observed between the patients with and without relapse.Relapse-free survival rates were lower when the number of peripheral blood CK8/18+ CTCs was more than 3.The 2-year relapse-free survival rates were 100%,100%,100%,94.1%,71.4%,53.3% and 44.4%(P<0.01) when the numbers of peripheral blood CK8/18+ CTCs were 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 before treatment,respectively.Overall survival rates were lower when the number of peripheral blood CK8/18+ CTCs was more than 5,but the difference was not significant.The 2-year overall survival rates were 100%,100%,100%,100%,100%,100%,80% and 77.8%(P>0.05) when the numbers of peripheral blood CK8/18+ CTCs were 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 before treatment,respectively.The VCA-IgA titer could not predict survivals.Cox multivariate analysis also showed the same results.CONCLUSION: Peripheral blood CK8/18+ CTCs are a prognostic factor for initial treatment of NPC.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this retrospective study was to define the clinical manifestations, pathological features and prognosis of children with membranoproliferative-like Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN), representing International Study of Kidney Disease in Children (ISKDC) grade VI.Among 245 patients with HSPN treated in our hospital between 2008 and 2010, nine patients (3.7%) were diagnosed with HSPN of ISKDC grade VI (males=5, females=4, age: 9.5±2.03 years, mean±SD). The clinical features, laboratory and pathological findings, treatment and outcome of the 9 patients were retrospectively analyzed.Of the 9 patients, 7 (78%) presented with hematuria and nephrotic syndrome, and were treated with steroids (oral prednisone or intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy) and immunosuppressants (oral tripterygium glycosides or intravenous cyclophosphamide pulse therapy). One (11%) patient had hematuria and nephrotic range proteinuria (>50 mg/kg per 24 hours) and was treated with oral prednisone and tripterygium glycosides. Another (11%) patient presented with hematuria and moderate proteinuria (25-50 mg/kg per 24 hours) and was treated with oral tripterygium glycoside only. Histopathological examination showed diffuse glomerular mesangial and endocapillary proliferation, mesangial interposition, double-contour formation, podocyte hypertrophy, shedding, and cytoplasmic absorption droplets. The percentages of glomeruli with small cellular crescents varied from 4%-25% in 6 of 9 patients. Follow-up for 2 to 4 years showed excellent recovery in all patients.The main clinical feature of ISKDC grade VI HSPN in children is a nephrotic syndrome with hematuria. The excellent prognosis of the disease was probably related to early diagnosis and treatment with steroids and/or immunosuppressants, and mild degree of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial damage.",

We propose a novel class of copula-based semiparametric transformation models for bivariate data under general interval censoring, which includes the case 1 interval censoring (current status data) and case 2 interval censoring. Specifically, the joint likelihood is modeled through a two-parameter Archimedean copula, which can flexibly characterize the dependence between the two margins in both tails. The marginal distributions are modeled through semiparametric transformation models using sieves, with the proportional hazards or odds model being a special case. We develop a computationally efficient sieve maximum likelihood estimation procedure for the unknown parameters, together with a generalized score test for the regression parameter(s). For the proposed sieve estimators of finite-dimensional parameters, we establish their asymptotic normality and efficiency. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in finite samples. Finally, we apply our method to a genome-wide analysis of AMD progression using the Age-Related Eye Disease Study data, to successfully identify novel risk variants associated with the disease progression. We also produce predicted joint and conditional progression-free probabilities, for patients with different genetic characteristics.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and the radiation complication of stereotactic radiotherapy sequence TP in patients with inoperable early stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods 60 patients with inoperable early stage NSCLC were randomly divided into two groups. The 30 patients in group A received stereotactic radiotherapy. Dosage(50%) to the total dose of 40 ~ 50 Gy with 4 ~ 5 Gy per fraction treated every other day, 8 ~ 10 times. The 30 patents in group B received stereotactic radiotherapy sequence TP 4 cycles. Results The efficacy rates in group A and B were 80.0% and 83.3%, without significant difference (p >0.05). The one and two year survival rates of the patients in group A and B were 86.7% (26/30) VS 83.3% (25/30), 73.3% (22/30) VS 80.0% (24/30) respectively, without significant difference (p >0.05). The two year non-metastasis survival rates were 60.0% (18/30) and 73.2% (22/30) respectively, the group B was better than group A, but without significant difference (p >0.05). The major acute radiation complication observed in the two groups were grade I to II radiation pneumonitis and hematopoietic toxicity. The later radiation complication in the two groups were grade I to II radiation lung fibrosis, without significant difference. Conclusion The efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy sequence TP is better than stereotactic radiotherapy in patients with inoperable early stage NSCLC.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the prognosis of esophageal carcinoma receiving docetaxol combined with cisplatin in neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy followed by surgery. Twenty-two patients with primary diagnosis of esophageal carcinoma were into this study. The radiotherapy used three dimensional conformal radiotherapy and the prescribed dose was 46 Gy/23 F. The chemotherapy consisted of docetaxol and cisplatin. The chemotherapy was administered in continuous infusion for the first week and the fourth week. After completion of chemo-radiotherapy, clinical restaging was performed. Esophagectomy and lymphadenectomies were performed 4-6 weeks after chemo-radiotherapy. Twenty-two patients finished the preoperative chemo-radiotherapy. The clinical response rate of chemo-radiotherapy was 81.8% (18/22). Twenty-one cases continued to received esophagectomy, the rate of radical resection was 95.2% and the pathological complete response rate was 38.1% (8/21). The T and N were downstaged compared to the pre-treatment,. Toxicity grade 3-4 included leucopenia, vomiting and radiation esophagitis. Surgery-related complications included pulmonary infection (4.8%, 1/21), anastomotic leakage (4.8%, 1/21), wound delay healing (4.8%, 1/21), and chylothorax (4.8%, 1/21). Overall survival at 3, 5 years were 61.9%, 47.6%, respectively and the median survival was 49 months. Disease-free survival at 3, 5 years were 50.2%, 40.5%, respectively and the median disease-free survival was 35 months. This neoadjuvant chemo-radiation (docetaxol combined cisplatin with radiotherapy) followed by surgery can achieve a high clinical response rate and pathologic complete tumor remission rate and significantly downstage the esophageal cancer. This multidiscipline therapy may hopefully improve the survival. In this treatment no death occured during chemo-radiotherapy.",

        "abstract": "PurposeInternet technology allows millions of people to find high quality medical resources online, with the result that personal healthcare and medical services have become one of the fastest growing markets in China. Data relating to healthcare search behavior may provide insights that could lead to better provision of healthcare services. However, discrepancies often arise between terminologies derived from professional medical domain knowledge and the more colloquial terms that users adopt when searching for information about ailments. This can make it difficult to match healthcare queries with doctors’ keywords in online medical searches. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approachTo help address this problem, the authors propose a transfer learning using latent factor graph (TLLFG), which can learn the descriptions of ailments used in internet searches and match them to the most appropriate formal medical keywords.FindingsExperiments show that the TLLFG outperforms competing algorithms in incorporating both medical domain knowledge and patient-doctor Qu0026A data from online services into a unified latent layer capable of bridging the gap between lay enquiries and professionally expressed information sources, and make more accurate analysis of online users’ symptom descriptions. The authors conclude with a brief discussion of some of the ways in which the model may support online applications and connect offline medical services.Practical implicationsThe authors used an online medical searching application to verify the proposed model. The model can bridge users’ long-tailed description with doctors’ formal medical keywords. Online experiments show that TLLFG can significantly improve the searching experience of both users and medical service providers compared with traditional machine learning methods. The research provides a helpful example of the use of domain knowledge to optimize searching or recommendation experiences.Originality/valueThe authors use transfer learning to map online users’ long-tail queries onto medical domain knowledge, significantly improving the relevance of queries and keywords in a search system reliant on sponsored links.",
