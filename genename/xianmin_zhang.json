        "abstract": "To improve the precise of all automatic printing equipment,a simple and effective calibration method was proposed to calibrate the screen printing equipment based on a novel three-degree-of-freedom(3-DOF) planar parallel stage.Firstly,a vision-based measuring system was analyzed and calibrated,and its measurement accuracy was also evaluated by a laser interferometer.Then,the geometric errors of the 3-DOF planar parallel stage was analyzed and the frame of the parallel stage's movable platform,screw lead errors and some geometric errors were identified in steps based on a vision-based measuring system in the equipment.Furthermore,the orientation interpolation and alignment methods using a triangular area to position the alignment point were presented to satisfy the need for different product processes in the whole workspace.For the processing mentioned above,this calibration method can calibrate the equipment itself automatically without complicated identification for all geometric errors and the need for any background in parallel robot calibration.Experimental results after calibration show that the maximum position and orientation errors inside the workspace have been reduced from 161.6 μm and 2.232″ to 12.3 μm and 0.720″,respectively,which satisfies the equipment requirement for high accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The design and full closed-loop controls of micro/nano positioning system are presented in this paper. The micro/nano positioning system mainly consists of a 3-DOF compliant mechanism, a micro-vision system and three piezoelectric actuators. In order to compensate for nonlinear hysteresis in the piezoelectric actuators, an adaptive controller using direct inverse modeling approach based on a modified Prandtl–Ishlinskii model is presented. Instead of using traditional displacement sensors, a micro-vision system (MVS) is used to obtain feedback signals online. Based on the micro-vision system, a full closed-loop tracking control is developed to enhance the positioning accuracy of micro/nano positioning system. Taking into account the coupling motions, another full closed-loop tracking control with a decoupling feedforward controller is also proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the full closed-loop controls can improve the positioning accuracy when compared with an open-loop control. Furthermore, the decoupling feedforward controller can improve the tracking performance of full closed-loop tracking control as well.",

The analog modulated optical signal is divided into M channels, suffering different time delay induced by optical delay lines which provide great flexibility in producing time intervals and is then sampled by electronic analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The channel mismatches resulting in performance degradation are estimated by a modified sine wave fitting method. The time mismatch and other mismatches are corrected by fine optical delay adjustment and digital processing, respectively. A four-channel photonic-assisted time-interleaved analog-to-digital converter (TIADC) system operating at 40 GSa s−1 was demonstrated experimentally. The photonic-assisted TIADC system was tested with a 6.31 GHz sine wave signal, exhibiting 40.3 dB signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SINAD) and 57.6 dBc spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR). It is shown that the SINAD is dominated by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the analog optical link and the SFDR of the proposed system is limited by the linearity of the link.",

The extent of dimension reduction is investigated and on the premise of it, the average accuracy can achieve 97.46% in the recognition of six hand gestures.

        "abstract": "Visual motion measurement systems (VMMSs) are widely used in robotics for pose estimation. A common characteristic of VMMSs is that the measurement repeatability is high, but the absolute measurement accuracy is relatively low, once a commercial lens with a large field of view is used. To improve the measurement accuracy of the VMMS for pose tracking of planar 3-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robots, a coarse-to-fine calibration method is presented in this paper. In this paper, after the VMMS is constructed, a degenerated perspective-n-point (DPnP) algorithm for pose estimation of 3-DOF robots is introduced. Then, an analytical calibration technique is implemented to obtain the camera intrinsic parameters required by the DPnP algorithm. Subsequently, a fine calibration step based on Gaussian process is developed to compensate the estimated pose of the DPnP algorithm. To investigate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed method, a series of the simulations and experiments are carried out on a planar 3-DOF robot. The results demonstrate that the proposed calibration method is quite robust and can improve the measurement accuracy up to 90.47%. Specifically, in a measurement field of view of 200 mm \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\times200$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n mm, the absolute errors of the 3-DOF pose obtained from the VMMS are reduced to below 0.03 mm and 0.016°.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The technique of photonic time stretch (PTS) has been intensively investigated in the past decade due to its potential in the acquisition of ultra-high speed signals. The frequency-related RF power fading in the PTS systems with double sideband (DSB) modulation has been well-known, which limits the maximum modulation frequency. Some solutions have been proposed to solve this problem. In this paper, we report another effect, i.e., undesired frequency chirping, which also relates to the performance degradation of PTS systems with DSB modulation, for the first time to our knowledge. Distinct from the nonlinearities caused by nonlinear modulation and square-law photodetection, which is common in radio frequency analog optical links, this frequency chirping originates from the addition of two beating signals with a relative delay after photodetection. A theoretical model for exactly describing the frequency chirping is presented, and is then verified by simulations. Discussion on the method to avoid the frequency chirping is also presented.",

Based on the partial differential equations and scanning schemes, the proposed algorithm only needs our four times to sweep and simple operations to build an extension velocity in O(N) time, where N is the number of grid points. The extended velocities are continuous and preserve the signed distance function without need for re-initialization.

To overcome the problem, an incremental clustering based solder joint inspection algorithm is proposed in this paper. In the system, the clustering algorithm is used for solder joint inspection, and an incremental clustering algorithm is used to adjust inspection parameters automatically according to the feedback from the repair station by training the false alarm samples. To improve the training efficiency of incremental clustering, only some representative samples of old data set are selected and trained with new samples together. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, various types of solder joints were inspected by an AOI system which integrates with the proposed algorithm. The inspection results have verified the effectiveness of this method in terms of speed and recognition rate. © 2011 Binary Information Press December, 2011.",

        "abstract": "Accounting for the flexibility of the blade and tower of the horizontal axis wind turbine, based on modal analysis method, the coupling dynamic equations of the blade and tower were obtained to simulate the dynamic behaviour of the complete system. Numerical solution of the dynamic equations was presented by applying the linear acceleration method. Adopting the proposed model, the dynamic responses of a 1.25MW wind turbine operating in steady wind were calculated. The results indicate that the presented structure dynamic response analysis model can correctly reflect the effects of external excitements to the structure deformation and load. It can also be seen from the simulation results that the flexible structures of large-scale wind turbine undergo considerable deformation during operation, and reasonable load results can be obtained when taking into account the former two order modes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Motion reliability is a significant performance index for manipulators with uncertainties. This paper presents a unified motion reliability analysis method for general planar parallel manipulators (PPMs) with interval clearance variables of revolute and prismatic joints. The uncertainties of manufacturing and inputs are also considered and assumed to follow normal distributions. Two typical types of PPMs, 3 R RR PPM and 3 P RR PPM, are analyzed as examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. For the purpose of a relatively fair comparison, the two PPMs are designed to have the same sizes of base platforms and moving platforms by using a traditional kinematic optimization based on the global conditioning index (GCI). Then, the comparison studies of the two PPMs are made with respect to performance indices of GCI, LCI (local conditioning index) and motion reliability. Furthermore, the index comparison between LCI and motion reliability is also carried out in detail through the two PPMs. The numerical analysis results indicate that: (i) the presented method could achieve a higher confidence estimate compared with the traditional probability method; (ii) the 3 P RR PPM exhibits better motion reliability performance than the 3 R RR PPM at the same uncertainty levels; and (iii) the traditional optimization based on the GCI cannot guarantee the good motion reliability performance of the PPM. This study provides support for the design and control of PPMs in terms of accuracy and motion reliability.",

The sensitivities of the objective functions are computed by the adjoint method, and the method of moving asymptotes (MMA) is employed as optimizer. The numerical example is presented to show the feasibility of the present method. © 2010 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "An accurate and simple method for dynamic modeling of general flexible parallel robot was proposed. According to the structural character of the parallel robot, it was devided into rigid sub-structure and elastic sub-structure, and the rigid-flexible coupling system was formed. The static platform and mobile platform were treated as rigid sub-structure because its deformations were smaller compared to the other part. The chains were treated as flexible sub-structure. The dynamic equations of each sub-structure were obtained, respectively. The dynamic equations of elastic sub-structure were obtained by using the finite element method and mode synthesis method. The dynamic equations of rigid sub-structure were built accounting for the effects of deformation of flexible sub-structure. The geometrical constraint relationship between three flexible sub-structures and the rigid platform was investigated to obtain a simple displacement and dynamic relation between them. The equations of all sub-structure were assembled to get the system dynamic equations. The comparative analysis of dynamic characteristics of a high-speed parallel manipulator show that the method is correct and feasible. Due to introducing the rigid sub-structure and application of the mode synthesis, the number of system freedom was reduced and the computational modeling was simplified. It provided a practical method for flexible parallel robot.",

To guarantee a good assembly quality, the relationship between the assembling deviation of optical components and measurement error is investigated. Secondly, a fast algorithm for the coplanarity measurement of the IC leads is proposed.

The presented method can be implemented in two steps. In the first step, a non-dimensional parameter design space is constructed. Within the design space, the available workspace and singularity of 3-RRR are then studied and the distribution characteristics of singularity loci are analyzed. The ranges of design parameters, which constitute 3-RRR manipulator free of internal singularities, are thereby obtained. In the second step, the kinematic parameters are optimized by considering global condition index as objective function and the transmission angle as constraint condition. 3-RRR parallel robot is designed using this method. The experimental result shows that the designed robot has excellent motion transmissibility.",

In addition, the proposed modulator features simple structure, low optical propagation and coupling loss, and good integrated compatibility as the fiber modulator. All these edges prospect the great potentiality in future high-speed optic fiber communications, optical signal processing, and all-fiber systems.",

Geometrically nonlinear structural response is calculated using a total Lagrange finite element formulation and the equilibrium is found using an incremental scheme combined with Newton-Raphson iterations. The mathematic optimal model of micro-compliant mechanisms is established. The solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) approach is employed in the design of compliant mechanisms. The sensitivities of the objective functions are derived using the adjoint method and the optimization problem is solved iteratively by the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA). Numerical simulations show that this approach performs well for the nonlinear topology optimizations of compliant mechanisms with large displacement.",

        "abstract": "Ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofilms have been fabricated by the Langmuir–Blodgett technique, possessing mainly a ferroelectric active phase and a controllable film thickness of 2.3 nm per layer. Atomic force microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were utilized to characterize the film properties. Importantly, the PVDF films could act as barrier layers to prepare spin transport devices using Fe3O4 and Co as bottom and top ferromagnetic electrodes, respectively. Spin-dependent electron transport behaviors were systemically studied in these devices by varying the PVDF film thickness from 3 layers (7 nm) to 13 layers (30 nm). With increasing PVDF layer numbers, the magnetoresistance (MR) response decreases likely due to the change in spin transport from tunneling to hopping transport. We further investigated the MR dependence on operation temperatures (150 K, 200 K, 250 K and 300 K). It is noteworthy that the MR effect was observed even at 300 K with an MR ratio exceeding 2.5%, which is achieved for the first time in such organic devices. The device performance could be further improved at lower operation temperatures. The MR ratios, device resistances and electron transport mechanisms in the present devices were also discussed to analyze the spin transport behaviors. The results indicate that the ferroelectric PVDF nanofilms are promising candidates for spin devices operated at room temperature, thereby shedding light on the design of organic ferroelectric spintronics with a higher performance.",

In the experiment, two-band LFM pulses with 20-GHz bandwidth in the THz band are photonically generated based on frequency-to-time mapping, resulting in a synthetic LFM signal with 40-GHz bandwidth operating within the 315–360 GHz. As a benefit, a range resolution as high as 3.9 mm over more than 2 m is successfully achieved in multi-target ranging. The proposed technology not only releases the requirements for instantaneous bandwidth and sampling rate but also breaks the bandwidth limitation of THz receiver in enabling ultrahigh resolution in the THz region.",

The performance evaluation indexes involve workspace, natural frequency, input coupling ratio, precision/accuracy, speed, payload capability, and output compliance. The tradeoff of multiple indexes is an important factor needing to be considered in the process of designing a nanopositioner. Stress, input stiffness, fatigue reliability, and force transmission are also the main constraints. This paper describes an optimal approach of selecting 16 key parameters of a planar parallel 3-DOF nanopositioner. Seven performance indexes and four constraints are involved in modelling the nanopositioner. A general analysis, optimization, and decision-making method is presented. All the modified-Pareto-optimality solutions are obtained using a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm. Different applications select preferred Pareto solutions from the same Pareto front. Several optimization cases are given to show the high efficiency of the proposed modelling and optimization method. Two design examples are given based on the corresponding demand of two typical application cases, respectively. The simulation and experimental results validate the proposed modelling and optimization method. The research results of this paper are helpful to design a planar parallel 3-DOF nanopositioner for different applications.",

        "abstract": "This study presents a novel translating piezoelectric flexible manipulator driven by a rodless cylinder. Simultaneous positioning control and vibration suppression of the flexible manipulator is accomplished by using a hybrid driving scheme composed of the pneumatic cylinder and a piezoelectric actuator. Pulse code modulation (PCM) method is utilized for the cylinder. First, the system dynamics model is derived, and its standard multiple input multiple output (MIMO) state-space representation is provided. Second, a composite proportional derivative (PD) control algorithms and a direct adaptive fuzzy control method are designed for the MIMO system. Also, a time delay compensation algorithm, bandstop and low-pass filters are utilized, under consideration of the control hysteresis and the caused high-frequency modal vibration due to the long stroke of the cylinder, gas compression and nonlinear factors of the pneumatic system. The convergence of the closed loop system is analyzed. Finally, experimental apparatus is constructed and experiments are conducted. The effectiveness of the designed controllers and the hybrid driving scheme is verified through simulation and experimental comparison studies. The numerical simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system scheme of employing the pneumatic drive and piezoelectric actuator can suppress the vibration and achieve the desired positioning location simultaneously. Furthermore, the adopted adaptive fuzzy control algorithms can significantly enhance the control performance. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

However, antenna loss is unavoidable in practice and sometimes cannot be ignored. In this paper, the radiation characteristics of different lossy traveling-wave circular antennas are studied carefully by both numerical calculation and CST simulation. Results demonstrate that the loss will affect the radiated OAM beams, including both the phase and amplitude; however, it may still work for communication when the loss is within a certain range.

The OEF is made up of a multi-mode optoelectronic oscillator, incorporated in the COEO loop to serve as a channelized RF filter, while the fiber laser in the COEO can be viewed as another channelized RF filter of high Q. The cascading of the two equivalent channelized RF filters can greatly improve the out-of-band rejection ratio of the combined filter and restrain the adjacent mismatched modes in the oscillating loop. In the experiment, a 9.955 GHz RF signal with the side mode suppression ratio of larger than 82.6 dB is obtained, and the super-mode noise spur at an offset frequency of 5.9 MHz is suppressed 15 dB to -145 dBc/Hz level compared with the conventional COEO.",

        "abstract": "To improve the performance of automatic optical inspection (AOI), a neural network combined with genetic algorithm for the diagnosis of solder joint defects on printed circuit boards (PCBs) assembled in surface mounting technology (SMT) is presented. Six types of solder joint have been classified in respect to the reality in the manufacture. The images of solder joint under test are acquired and 14 features are extracted as input features for the classification. The neural network is easily become over-fitting because these input features are not independent of each other, so the genetic algorithm is introduced to select and remove redundant input features. The experimental results have proved that the neural network combined with genetic algorithm reduced the number of input feature and had a satisfying recognition rate. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper presents singularity analysis and path planning with the working mode conversion of a three-degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) 3- R RR planar parallel manipulator (PPM). Firstly, the kinematics constraint equation of the manipulator is established, the velocity Jacobian matrix is obtained by differentiating the equation with respect to time, and comparisons of singular characteristics of eight working modes are made. Secondly, an algorithm is proposed for singularity-free path planning with the working mode conversion of the 3- R RR PPM. The path maintains a minimum distance with respect to the forward singular curve at all points, which guarantees the controllability of the manipulator everywhere along the path. Finally, three experiments are carried out: positioning close to the forward singular configuration, passing through the singular curve, and path-planning with working mode conversion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach for switching working modes is feasible and that the combination of workspaces of eight working modes is valid for expanding the workspace of the manipulator.",

Two tapered antennas with inclination angles of 45° and 135° are fabricated on different Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) optical waveguides so as to induce local E-fields within antenna gaps to modulate optical waves for separately measuring two E-field components. Experimental results show that polarization directions of the two inclined antennas are orthogonal. The minimum detectable E-field strength is 1.56 and 0.90 V/m for two MZIs, and the fabricated E-field sensor has a wideband frequency response from 1 to 6 GHz with ±8-dB fluctuations. The proposed integrated LiNbO 3  photonic E-field sensor has the potential of 2-D E-field vector measurement.",

In designing this kind of microdevice, the movement coupling among the microdevices becomes critical because many inputs and outputs are involved. This paper presents a systematic method for designing fully decoupled compliant mechanisms with multiple degrees of freedom by using topology optimization. An optimization formulation is posed by considering both output coupling and input coupling issues to achieve fully decoupled motion. The SIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) and MMA (Method of Moving Asymptotes) methods are adopted to identify the optimized material distribution in the design domain. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.",

First, the source images are decomposed into low-frequency and high-frequency components by the discrete wavelet transform technique. Next, a correlation coefficient is employed to obtain the maximum similarity among low-frequency components. Then, in order not to interrupt the correlations among decomposition layers, the comparison among high-frequency components is executed by transforming them to spatial domain. In addition, a sliding window is used to evaluate the local saliency of the pixels more accurately. Finally, the fused image is synthesized from source images and the saliency map. The variance, entropy, spatial frequency, mutual information, edge intensity, and similarity measure (Q) are used as metrics to evaluate the sharpness of the fused image. Experimental results demonstrate that the fusion performance of the proposed method is enhanced compared with that of the other widely used techniques. In the application of three-dimensional surface optical detection, the proposed method is suitable for obtaining the complete image at varying distances in the same scene, so as to prepare for subsequent defect identification.",

Firstly, the level set model with a distance-suppression scheme (generalized Hamilton–Jacobi equation) is used to implicitly represent boundary of heat conductive material so that the periodical re-initialization can be avoided. Secondly, after demonstrating that the finite element thermal analysis takes the major portion of the total computational time, we present a weighting based velocity constructing method inspired from the conjugate gradient method to avoid performing finite element thermal analysis for solving the generalized Hamilton–Jacobi equation. Thirdly, a velocity renewing procedure and criteria for stopping the weighting method are developed for insuring the stability and a quick convergence. Finally, two dimensional topology optimization results of heat conduction problem under both single and multiple load cases are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.",

These four coaxially propagating OAM waves with modes of l = −6, −2, +2 and +6 are generated by a Cassegrain antenna based on the dual ring-slot radiators. Over 10 m free-space transmission, four identical horn antennas uniformly located at the π/2 arc with a fixed radius of 45 cm are used to capture the four overlapped OAM waves. The de-multiplexing is then performed by digital phase-shift (DPS) at digital baseband. Experiment results show that the bit-error rates (BER) can reach below the forward error correction limit of 3.8 × 10−3 for all the four OAM channels. Multi-OAM-mode communications with the PASR scheme is capable of providing the receiving end with desired properties of compact size as well as easy realization.",

The polynomial-based model is validated by comparing with the classic Prandtl-Ishlinskii model.

To achieve better tracking performance, a hybrid control combining the developed inverse control and a proportional-integral-differential feedback loop is then proposed. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking controls, several comparative experiments of the polynomial-based model and Prandtl-Ishlinskii model are conducted.

The proposed method, which utilizes the advantages of compressive sensing and the CGI technique, is composed of two search steps. The first step is a coarse search, and the second is a fine search. By using the two-step search, an optimum distance can be obtained. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the relative mean square error (RMSE) are used as criteria during the search process. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can enhance imaging quality, and compressive CGI is more sensitive to distance variations than traditional CGI.

In this paper, we develop a practical method for the control of a 3-RRR planar positioning system using online vision measurement as feedback. In this method, a monocular vision system is established to accomplish high-precision online pose measurement for the 3-RRR manipulator. Additionally, a robust and operable adaptive control algorithm, which incorporates a fuzzy controller and a PI controller, is employed to achieve precise and rapid positioning of the 3-RRR positioning system. A series of experiments are conducted to verify the positioning performances of the proposed method, and a conventional PI control algorithm is utilized for comparison.

However, it needs a large aperture size to receive and demultiplex the orthogonal OAM waves due to the amplitude null in the beam centre and the beam divergence. An improved receiving scheme named partial aperture sampling receiving (PASR) is proposed to solve this problem. The theoretical analysis of PASR is first presented and simulations of OAM radio communication link are carried on to evaluate the performance of PASR. The effects of some non-ideal receiver conditions, e.g. radial deviation and angular deviation on the PASR scheme and the superiority of PASR are explored. These simulated results will give a helpful guide on the manipulation of practical OAM-based wireless communication systems.",

In the investigation, first, a reliability index is obtained by means of the first-order second-moment method and is used to describe the impact of parameter uncertainty. Next, the minimum structural flexibility and the maximum output displacement are respectively chosen as the objective function to establish the topology optimization model of thermo-mechanical coupling structures, with the reliability index as the constraint. Then, the proposed model is solved based on the adjoint sensitivity analysis and the Optimality Criteria algorithm, and the correctness and applicability of the model are finally validated by numerical examples. The results show that, as compared with the deterministic topology optimization design, the proposed method based on reliability constraint is more effective in achieving the best combination of economy and security in a structure and obtaining better design results of compliant mechanisms.",

The system composition is introduced, as well as the pneumatic circuit and control circuit of the system. The system model is given. Three control algorithms are analyzed. Variable universe adaptive fuzzy control algorithm improves the performance of traditional fuzzy controller by adjusting the universes of input and output variables on line, and the adaptive law of output universes is developed. An indirect adaptive fuzzy controller with adjustable parameters is constructed to approximate the ideal controller, and then the parameter adaptive law of the fuzzy controller is deduced. Considering the cylinder's long stroke, gas compression and nonlinear pneumatic system factors, the hysteresis of control effect and the vibration of the flexible manipulator's high frequency modes will be caused. Band-stop filter, low pass filtering and time delay compensation algorithm are introduced into the control algorithm. Experiments on simultaneous positioning and vibration suppression of flexible manipulator are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that the adopted three control algorithms can accomplish positioning and vibration suppress of the flexible manipulator simultaneously. The performances of the adaptive fuzzy control algorithms are better than the traditional fuzzy control algorithm. © 2013 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.",

In this algorithm, first, solder joints are segmented from the printed circuit board (PCB) image after the binarization of the pretreated image of lead-free solder joints according to the color feature of the joints. Then, with the help of gray-level integration projection curves of solder joint features in both horizontal and vertical directions, the positioning coordinates of the joints are obtained and the accurate positions of the joints can be determined by maximizing the pixel area of solder joints within the solder-land windows. Moreover, by introducing a Blob evaluation function, the solder joint and the noise are differentiated, thus effectively reducing the disturbance of noise and improving the robustness of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is of a high positioning precision less than 1 pixel for various solder joints of a Chip component.",

A traveling-wave circular slot antenna that can generate plane spiral OAM waves is developed and experimentally demonstrated in this letter. The antenna is excited by a 90   $^circ$   hybrid coupler. In order to ensure that the OAM waves are propagating along the transverse plane, a ring horn is added outside the antenna. A prototype with OAM states  l =   $pm$   3 for 10-GHz operation is fabricated and measured. The near-field phase distributions clearly indicate the azimuth phase shifting, and the radiation patterns show the characteristic of transverse propagation, respectively. The proposed antenna provides a novel approach to implement an OAM wireless communication link that has no phase singularity or divergence problem.",

        "abstract": "For the piezo-driven microgripper, one issue is to enlarge the grasping stroke and realize parallel grasping movement in the compact design. Piezoelectric stack actuator (PSA) and piezoelectric cantilever actuator (PCA) are two kinds of typical piezoelectric actuators. In this study, a novel microgripper hybrid driven by a PSA and two PCAs is proposed, which can be a better solution for the issue, compared with the previous microgripper using PSA-driven multi-stages displacement amplification mechanism (DAM) or using longer and narrower PCAs. A compact one-stage orthogonal DAM is proposed for the PSA in the microgripper, which can enlarge the grasping stroke and realize parallel grasping movement. The proposed orthogonal DAM is a triangulation amplification-based mechanism with undetermined structural parameters. Bidirectional symmetric input forces/displacements are not required in the proposed design. The number of the undetermined parameters and the solution principle are analyzed. Finite element analysis is used to verify the proposed DAM. The gripper arms are designed as two PCAs, for which the grasping and parasitic movements of the free end are modeled. Piezoelectric-static coupling finite element analysis is used to verify the models. The PCAs-driven grasping with considerable parasitic movement can be used in the coarse positioning. The integration of the hybrid-driven microgripper is presented, and its performances are presented and verified by experiments.",

This paper proposes a novel position correction method for the electronic componentsu0027 auto-insertion based on rotational stereo vision. Firstly, a four-degree-of-freedom auto-insertion system based on rotational stereo vision is set up. The pose of the electronic component is detected by the rotational stereo vision system. Then a novel pose correction method is derived by reconstructing the leads position from the rotational stereo vision. Finally, the relationship between the motion system and the vision system is calibrated. Experimental results show that the proposed correction method can position the leads accurately and correct the electronic componentu0027s pose. It can meet the efficiency requirement of auto-inserting machines.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Fullerenes (C 60  and C 70 ) films have been fabricated by a thermal evaporation method. Raman spectra for C 60  and C 70  films were utilized to evaluate the film quality, and atomic force microscopy technique showed the roughness of both films was within the molecular scale of fullerenes. Moreover, these fullerenes (C 60  and C 70 ) films were successfully used to fabricate spin-valve devices with an Fe 3 O 4 /AlO/fullerenes (C 60  or C 70 )/Co/Al stacking structure to get an insight for spin conserved electron transport behaviors in C 60  and C 70  films. The magnetoresistance (MR) effects in these devices were investigated at both room and low temperatures. As reducing measurement temperature, the MR ratios increased in both fullerenes (C 60  and C 70 ) based devices due to the reduction of spin scattering. It is worth noting that the MR ratio in C 60  based devices is around one order of magnitude larger than that of C 70  based devices at room temperature. The dominant reason for the larger MR ratio in C 60  based spin valves compared to that in C 70  based devices is analyzed. This study may provide some criteria for organic semiconductors selection for designing spin based organic devices.",

In this paper, an integrated approach for measuring micro-motion that incorporates motion estimation algorithm into the computer microvision is proposed. At first, the basic principle of the computer microvision measurement is analyzed. Then, a robust multiscale motion estimation algorithm for micro-motion measurement is proposed. In this algorithm, according to the different properties of filters, motion at each level of the pyramid is estimated using different gradient filters. This hierarchical estimation technique not only provides an improvement in measurement accuracy, but also achieves measurement speedups. Finally, using the micropositioning stage as measurement objects, the micro-motions are measured using the integrated approach that incorporates this algorithm into computer microvision. The maximal bias of this integrated approach reached 12.5 nm for motions near 2000nm. Experimental results show that the new integrated method can measure in-plane micro-motions with high accuracy. © 2008 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The inherent uncertainties of a manipulator, including manufacturing tolerances, input errors and joint clearances, cause deviations between the actual motion and the expected motion, leading to a motion reliability problem. This paper focuses on the motion reliability of a planar 3- R RR parallel manipulator with multiple uncertainties. First, the error model of the manipulator is built. Then, an analytical method is presented to verify its validation and accuracy. To address the complexity of the motion in a journal-bearing joint, the joint clearance parameters are modelled as interval variables while other parameters are treated as random variables. A new hybrid approach to motion reliability analysis based on the first order second moment (FOSM) method and the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method is developed for the manipulator with both random and interval variables. This method has an easier simulation process than that of the conventional MCS method using direct kinematics. Compared to the probability method with random variables, the proposed hybrid method has a higher confidence estimate of motion reliability for the manipulator with joint clearances.",

Firstly a simple labeling approach based on the fast marching method is developed in this algorithm.

Modal parameters are identified by using a comprehensive approach based on modal test and finite element analysis. The appropriate structural finite element analysis samples in design space are selected by using the central composite design (CCD) experiment method. Quadratic polynomials are employed to construct response surface (RS) model, which reflects the relationship between design inputs and structural response outputs, according to the response outputs of these samples obtained by analyzing the dynamic and static characteristics of the machining centre at these samples with the software ANSYS. Well-distributed samples are generated in the design space by shifted Hammersley sampling method. The prominent points are selected as initial samples. The goal of getting higher first natural frequency and lighter weight is reached and the Pareto optimal solution set is obtained by the multi-objective genetic algorithm in the optimization. Through the optimization, the mass of the machining center is decreased by 6.58% under the condition of ensuring the dynamic and static performance. The results show the high precision and strong engineering practicability of the proposed optimization method. © 2011 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.",

Moreover, a large SDT length of over 100 nm was experimentally observed in the C 60  layer at room temperature. Tunneling MR ratio was achieved over 6% in rubrene and Alq 3  based spin valves at room temperature.

        "abstract": "To improve the precise of all automatic printing equipment, a simple and effective calibration method was proposed to calibrate the screen printing equipment based on a novel three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) planar parallel stage. Firstly, a vision-based measuring system was analyzed and calibrated, and its measurement accuracy was also evaluated by a laser interferometer. Then, the geometric errors of the 3-DOF planar parallel stage was analyzed and the frame of the parallel stage's movable platform, screw lead errors and some geometric errors were identified in steps based on a vision-based measuring system in the equipment. Furthermore, the orientation interpolation and alignment methods using a triangular area to position the alignment point were presented to satisfy the need for different product processes in the whole workspace. For the processing mentioned above, this calibration method can calibrate the equipment itself automatically without complicated identification for all geometric errors and the need for any background in parallel robot calibration. Experimental results after calibration show that the maximum position and orientation errors inside the workspace have been reduced from 161.6 μm and 2.232″ to 12.3 μm and 0.720″, respectively, which satisfies the equipment requirement for high accuracy.",

The method is built up by three steps. In the first step, a fast search algorithm combined with triangular relations and a ring projection with illumination and noise correction is adopted to achieve the selection of candidate pixels. Subsequently, an orientation code based algorithm is adopted to determine the integer-pixel displacement and rotation angle estimation. The third step is to obtain the sub-pixel displacement through a similarity function based algorithm. Simulations are carried out, and the results show that the proposed method has the characteristics of translation and rotation invariance, and the matching accuracy can reach 0.01-pixel theoretically. Moreover, the proposed method consumes less time than that of the orientation code and pseudo-Zernike moment based algorithm. Finally, a capacitance sensor measurement system is established to compare the accuracy of the proposed method. The experiment results demonstrate that it has a high accuracy.",

The relationship between the loop transfer characteristics of a PLL and the phase noise of the oscillation signal is analyzed. The close-in phase noise and frequency overlapping Allan deviation (ADEV) of the OEO are optimized by properly choosing the bandwidth of the loop filter of the PLL. The phase noise of the OEO is suppressed by 41.5 dB at 100 Hz offset and 21.3 dB at 10 kHz offset with PLL and DSIL. The frequency overlapping ADEV achieved 7.03×10 –12  at average time of 100 s, which is several orders of magnitude better than that of the DSIL OEO and the free-running OEO, proves the high oscillation stability of proposed scheme.",

In the approach, all the MZMs have the same electrode length, which eliminates the need of MZMs with very low half-wave voltages as in the scheme using MZM array with geometrically-scaled half-wave voltages. An electric circuit is employed to realize linear combinations of the detected signals (including subtraction and addition). By properly biasing the MZMs and setting the thresholding voltages in the comparators, a digital Gray-code output is obtained. The proposed ADC scheme can effectively improve the bit resolution compared with the previous photonic ADCs based on the phase-shifting technique. Theoretical analysis and proof-of-concept experiments are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "The interfacial magnetic interaction and coupling mechanism for τ-MnAl with Fe(Co) atomic layers have been studied using first principles calculations. The stable surface and interface were firstly determined by the surface energy of τ-MnAl and interface energy of τ-MnAl/Fe(Co) films, respectively. Their magnetic coupling interactions were investigated by varying the Fe(Co) atomic layer numbers. It is noted that both Fe and Co exhibited ferromagnetic coupling with τ-MnAl. Interestingly, an unusual oscillation phenomenon of magnetic coupling for τ-MnAl with Fe(Co) atomic layers was observed depending on the layer thickness of Fe(Co). Moreover, Fe and Co showed different oscillation modes. The energy difference between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states is larger for τ-MnAl/Fe and τ-MnAl/Co when the Fe(Co) layer numbers are even and odd, respectively. Their mechanisms were analyzed based on the band structures and the confinement of electrons in quantum wells. It is found that the magnetic coupling oscillation in τ-MnAl/Fe originated from both the spin up Δ1 band and spin down Δ5 band at the [capital Gamma, Greek, macron] points. Comparatively, the oscillation of τ-MnAl/Co is due to the spin up band at the X[combining macron] point. The present results could provide insight to further understand interfacial exchange interactions among magnetic layers.",

        "abstract": "To overcome the defects of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in widely used vehicle detection method, an improved algorithm for moving vehicle detection based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is proposed. For the defect of long-term \"ghosts\" in Gaussian mixture model, a new update method of weights and variances is employed to accelerate the elimination of \"ghosts\", and the performance of vehicle detection can be improved. Additionally, in the existing GMM, all of the pixels are modeled by fixed number of distributions, so main memories are wasted. To save memories, a self-adapting method is adopted. For the pixels whose distribution numbers are not up to maximum, the approach of adaptive change for distribution numbers is used to effectively decrease the total number of distributions and save memory space. Experimental results show that the improved GMM method provides superior performance in the elimination of \"ghosts\" and computing speed for vehicle detection.",

With three short PRP chains for driving and four rollers for supporting the movable platform, the stage is actually a 3-PRP planar parallel robot, which is not only ideal for precision positioning solution for wafers and printed circuit boards in all sizes, but also can be reformed to support a large screen and stencil easily. In this paper, an XY-Theta alignment stage, as well as its direct and inverse kinematic are presented firstly. Considering many performance indices used in the past do not work perfectly when applied to parallel robots with translational and rotational degrees of freedom, a simple but useful method is presented to analyze the maximum position and orientation errors subjected to input errors and structure parameter errors. Then an experiential input method is proposed to improve the input accuracy. And comparison experiments with a vision-based measuring device between the experiential input method and the normal input are conducted, which indicate the former one could lead to a better positioning accuracy. © 2012 IEEE.",

The motion estimation MSE was minimized to find the gradient optimal filters. In combination with multiscale pyramid approach, the estimator accuracy of such an algorithm is further improved.

The blade is treated as a cantilever and modeled with two-node beam element. The blade element-momentum theory is applied to calculate the aerodynamic loads. Dynamic inflow and dynamic stall are taken into account to reflect the transient aerodynamics. The centrifugal stiffening is introduced to consider the restoring effects of centrifugal force. An aerodynamic damping model is presented for calculating the overall damping ratio instantaneously during time-domain simulation. The structural dynamic equation is solved using Newmark method and the overall dynamic response of the blade is obtained based on the modal superposition principle. Applying the proposed method, the power production load case of a 1.0 MW wind turbine operating in turbulent wind field is simulated. The simulation results indicate that the blades of large-scale horizontal axis wind turbines undergo significant vibration and deflection during operation, and the centrifugal stiffening and aerodynamic damping both considerably affect the structural response of the blade.",

        "abstract": "A practical method is proposed for the design of a freeform reflector for light-emitting diode low-beam headlamps. The energy relationship between the solid angle of the light-emitting diode source and the target plane is first established. A freeform reflector is then constructed based on Snellu0027s Law and the light energy redistribution maps are obtained by optimising meshing parameters on the target plane. By using this method, four reflectors are designed to constitute a module for the low-beam headlamp, and three different types of light-emitting diode sources are selected for simulation. Results demonstrate that the best light pattern can be obtained with the LUW HWQP light-emitting diode source whose chip size is 1.0 mm×1.0 mm, and the lighting distribution can fully satisfy the requirements of the ECE R112 regulations without any other lenses, shields or baffles. Furthermore, the optical efficiency can reach up to 79%.",

        "abstract": "The applications of orbital angular momentum (OAM) carried beam are limited by its on-axis phase singularity and wide-angle directivity. In this paper, a new form of OAM wave termed as plane spiral OAM wave is proposed. Different from general OAM wave propagating along the axial direction, plane spiral OAM wave has the distinguishing characteristic of transverse propagation. Hence it has no singularity along the propagation path and divergence problem no longer exists. A traveling-wave circular slot antenna excited by a 90° hybrid coupler is used to generate plane spiral OAM waves. Due to the ring horn outside the antenna, energy is focused on the radial plane and the generated waves are propagating in the transverse direction. The measured results of a fabricated prototype with OAM states l=±3 for 10 GHz operation validate its good performance and characteristic of plane spiral. The potential applications of plane spiral OAM waves, e.g., plane spiral OAM based multiple-in-multiple-out (MIMO) system and plane spiral OAM based beam-forming method, are also detailedly discussed.",

According to the results of topology optimization, the curve equations of profiles of the flexure hinges are developed by numerical fitting. The in-plane dimensionless compliance equations of the flexure hinges are derived based on Castigliano’s second theorem. The accuracy of rotation, which is denoted by the compliance of the center of rotation that deviates from the midpoint, is derived. The equations for evaluating the maximum stresses are also provided. These dimensionless equations are verified by finite element analysis and experimentation. The analytical results are within 8% uncertainty compared to the finite element analysis results and within 9% uncertainty compared to the experimental measurement data. Co...",

Next, on the basis of the proposed model, the distribution of the first four-order natural frequency of the manipulator in the workspace is analyzed. Then, the displacement error of the moving platform under the excitations of external forces and rigid inertial force is investigated. Finally, the maximum dynamic stress and its position at each time point are presented. The results show that the natural frequency of the manipulator is relevant to the configuration, that the displacement error of the moving platform is mainly caused by the rigid inertial force during a high-speed movement, and that the dynamic stress spectra of the flexible components of the manipulator are all amplitude variable.",

The mapping relationship between the errors of position and orientation and the errors of geometrical parameters is derived by a combination of vector method and analytical method. The Jacobian matrix is obtained. The vision-based and full-pose measuring device including two cameras is set up by taking into account both measurement costs and applicability, and the device is calibrated by a high accuracy lithography glass-board. By using precision vision-based metrology, based on the repeatability of the parallel alignment stage, a step and gradual kinematic calibration including step measurement, step identification and step compensation is designed. After calibration, the maximum position and orientation errors are reduced from 316 ��m and 3.5 �� 10-3�� to 9 ��m and 1.7 �� 10-3��, respectively. The results show that the positioning accuracy after calibration is significantly improved and verify the effectiveness of the step and gradual kinematic calibration method. ? 2014 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.",

In this paper, we suggest that the concept of delay-line based microwave photonic filter be used in photonic CS to realize the low-pass filtering (LPF) function which is required in CS. A microwave photonic filter (MPF) with a dispersive element and fiber delay lines is applied in photonic CS to achieve better performance and flexibility. In the approach, the input radio-frequency signal and the pseudorandom bit sequence (PRBS) are modulated on a multi-wavelength optical carrier and propagate through a dispersive element. The modulated optical signal is split into multiple channels with tunable delay lines. The multiple wavelengths, dispersive element and multiple channels constitute a reconfigurable low-pass microwave filter. Experiment and simulations are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and potentials of this approach.",

Then, based on the motion characteristic, its motion analysis model is built. At last, combined with the least square method, a positioning algorithm with effective & high positioning precision is derived and presented. In experiment and application, the coordinate differences between Marks on PCB and Stencil are acquired by Machine Vision system, and then error theory is combined to analyze the error after positioning by this algorithm. Results show that this algorithm can complete correction at one-time, not only the time of mechanical positioning can be reduced, but also the coupling error that induced by parallel table's step by step movement can be effectively avoided, the repeatability positioning precision of table stabilized within 10 m and 0.005 .",

        "abstract": "Since compliant mechanism is usually required to perform in more than one environment, the ability to consider multiple objectives has to be included within the framework of topology optimization. And the topology optimization of micro-compliant mechanisms is actually a geometrically nonlinear problem. This paper deals with multiobjective topology optimization of micro-compliant mechanisms undergoing large deformation. The objective function is defined by the minimum compliance and maximum geometric advantage to design a mechanism which meets both stiffness and flexibility requirements. The weighted sum of conflicting objectives resulting from the norm method is used to generate the optimal compromise solutions, and the decision function is set to select the preferred solution. Geometrically nonlinear structural response is calculated using a Total-Lagrange finite element formulation and the equilibrium is found using an incremental scheme combined with Newton-Raphson iterations. The solid isotropic material with penalization approach is used in design of compliant mechanisms. The sensitivities of the objective functions are found with the adjoint method and the optimization problem is solved using the Method of Moving Asymptotes. These methods are further investigated and realized with the numerical example of compliant microgripper, which is simulated to show the availability of this approach proposed in this paper.

        "abstract": "Understanding the optimal designs in nature is critical in bionics. This paper presents a method for designing the configuration of fusiform muscle with a maximum contractile displacement based on topology optimization methods. A nearly incompressible continuum constitutive model of skeletal muscle is utilized. The contractile displacement from the relaxed state to the contracted state is regarded as the objective function. To handle the numerical difficulties that result from the existence of element density, an energy interpolation equation is employed, and a modification of the constitutive model of skeletal muscle is proposed. Several numerical examples are given to demonstrate the reasonability of the proposed method.",

The algorithm of the proposed method is based on a template matching approach composed of an integer-pixel search and a sub-pixel search. By combining with an optical microscopy, a high resolution CCD camera and the proposed algorithm, an extremely high measuring precision is achieved. Various simulations and experiments are conducted. The simulation results demonstrate that the matching precision can reach to 0.01 pixel when the noise interference is low. A laser interferometer measurement system (LIMS) is established for comparison. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method possesses the same performance as the LIMS but exhibits a greater flexibility and operability. The measuring precision can theoretically attain to 2.83 nm/pixel.",

        "abstract": "The joint clearance causes poor dynamic mechanism performance, and the effect of multiple clearance joints on many complex mechanisms is unclear. This paper therefore performs dynamic analysis of a 3-PRR parallel mechanism by considering joint clearances. A concise method based on Newton–Euler equations is presented for the planar multibody system, and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the angular acceleration is proposed as an index to quantify the effect of the joint clearance on the dynamic behaviour. To improve the performance of the mechanism, this paper discusses the dynamic response of three parameters: the clearance size, restitution coefficient of the material and movement trajectory. Moreover, the simulation results indicate that: (i) the maximum absolute value of the displacement deviation is approximately triple the clearance size, and the nonlinearity of the mechanism rises obviously with increasing clearance size; (ii) different movement trajectories have various dynamic responses, and the nonperiodic response decreases due to the coupling effect of certain special movement trajectories; and (iii) a material with a moderate value of coefficient restitution is beneficial to the dynamic response, because the trend curve of the RMSE of the angular acceleration appears similar to a bathtub curve with increasing restitution coefficient of the material. This study provides support for the design and control of the parallel mechanism in the field of precision machinery.",

The multi-objective function is developed by the maximum dynamic magnification factor and the minimum strain energy to design a mechanism which meets both stiffness and flexibility requirements under harmonic excitation, respectively. The objective function is normalized to eliminate magnitude difference of the objectives. The sensitivities of the objective functions are computed by the adjoint method, the optimization problem is solved using the method of moving asymptotes (MMA).

Subsequently, according to the front and last several frames of the sorted BDS, the positive and negative subsets (PNS) are created by selecting the relative frames from the reference detector signals. Finally, the object image is recovered from the PNS. Besides, an adaptive method based on two-step iteration is designed to select the optimum number of frames.

The noisy images are first decomposed by multiscale wavelet to different scales wavelet coefficients (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal direction), then the shifted wavelet coefficients are multiplied step by step to depress noise and detect edges. Compared to other methods, this approach not only can get rid of noise very well and decrease the number of computations, but also can detect diagonal edge information.",

        "abstract": "With the development of the micro-electronic industry, electronical components assembled on the printed circuit board (PCB) become more and more microsize and its mounted density is increasing. It is out of date to depend on manual inspection to assure the joints quality. Instead, automated optical inspection (AOI) for solder joints based on the machine vision has become more and more important. In this paper, based on the image acquired from a 3-CCD color camera and a 3-color hemispherical LED arrays light resource (red, green, and blue), the place, shape, and logical features of solder joints of chip components are extracted. The place features are related to solder joint place. As for shape features, we divide solder joint into several regions and extract its shape features by its color, occupancy ratio of area, center of gravity and continuous pixels. The logical features come from their close relationships of different regions of shape features, color distributing and place features. On the basis of the features, an AOI algorithm is developed. The defects of lacking solder, surplus solder, no solder, pseudo joints, wrong component, damaged component, component absent, shift, tomb stone, wrong polarity, etc. can be identified properly by using the proposed algorithm. Finally, some experiment results are presented to show the validity of the algorithm.",

In the approach, an SLM-based spectrum shaper, the pattern of which is a predetermined pseudorandom bit sequence (PRBS), spectrally codes the optical pulse carrying image information. The energy of the spectrally mixed pulse is detected by a single-pixel photodiode and the measurement results are used to reconstruct the image via a sparse recovery algorithm. As the mixing of the image signal and the PRBS is performed in the spectral domain, optical pulse stretching, modulation, compression and synchronization in the time domain are avoided. Experiments are implemented to verify the feasibility of the approach.",

The step-by-step grasping strategy was used to position and grasp a peg and a hole on the working platform. At the assembling process, the positioning error was derived by the camera attached on the robot end-effector, and the positioning error was compensated through proportional–integral–derivative controller. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the grasping strategy and the vision-guidance method. Experimental results show that the Baxter robot can grasp the peg and the hole from the working platform, and the peg in hole with 1 mm clearance can be assembled successfully.",

We report on the formation of a transparent magnetic semiconductor with embedded ferromagnetic metallic glass nano-granules, showing a Curie temperature of ~ 600 K. Soft X-ray magnetic circular dichroism data verify its intrinsic room-temperature ferromagnetism. Owing to the unique structure of ferromagnetic nano-granules embedded in the host magnetic semiconductor, additional interfacial exchange anisotropy emerges and stabilizes the ferromagnetism. The magnetotransport measurements of the amorphous nanocomposite indicate that its anomalous Hall effect is dominated by the extrinsic mechanism of the side-jump due to the spin-dependent impurity.",

Stiffness components of the CF beam and the middle stage of CF stage are derived through stiffness matrix method. Numerical simulations indicate smaller length of straight segment, smaller thickness and larger number of CF units are better for maximizing the off-axis/axial stiffness ratio. Further, the dimensions of CF stage have been optimized, leading to a CF stage with higher off-axis/axial stiffness ratio and larger range of motion. The optimal result is validated by the finite element analysis (FEA) and experiments.",

A multi-scale motion estimation algorithm based on gradient filters was presented in this paper. In such an algorithm, the gradient filters were viewed as convolution of the discrete images with linear filters. In combination with multi-scale pyramid approach, which the large pixels motions are converted to small motions, the estimator accuracy of such an algorithm is further improved. Experimental simulations show that the estimator performance performs very well for motion amplitudes larger than 1 pixel using this new algorithm, and estimator bias is less than 0.02 pixels for motions of noise image near 2 pixels. This represents a significant decrease in estimator bias compared to many existing methods.",

A conventional major challenge is the trade-off between high rigidity, large magnification, high-precision tracking, and high-accuracy positioning. A compact planar three-degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) nanopositioning platform is described in which three two-level lever amplifiers are arranged symmetrically to achieve large magnification. The parallel-kinematic configuration with optimised sizes increases the rigidity. Displacement loss models (DLM) are proposed for the external preload port of the actuator, the input port of the platform and the flexible lever mechanism. The kinematic and dynamic modelling accuracies are improved by the compensation afforded by the three DLMs. Experimental results validate the proposed design and modelling methods. The proposed platform possesses high rigidity, large magnification, high-precision circle tracking and high-accuracy positioning.",

Then, the regions of solder joints and components were figured out based on their edge, and the area method was used to inspect pseudo solder joints.

The theoretical analysis and experiments of adaptive feedforward and combined vibration control algorithms are presented. The experimental setup of a flexible plate bonded PZT (Lead Zirconate Titanate) sensors/actuators is constructed. The control algorithm combines an adaptive feedforward controller and an adaptive feedback controller together, which has shown a superior control performance in the experiments. Considering the disadvantages of fixed step size used in the conventional filtered-U least mean square (FULMS) control algorithm, a variable step-size (VSS) method is applied. Also, a reference filter is used to extract the desired signal from the positive feedback and measurement noise. A proportional derivative (PD) feedback control algorithm is also applied as comparison. The experimental results demonstrate that the adaptive combined control algorithm has better control performance than the adaptive feedforward and PD feedback control algorithms.",

In this paper, the inspection procedure is divided into training stage and test stage. In the training stage, first, the solder joint is divided into several sub-regions according to priori knowledge, second, various features in every sub-region are extracted, then, for every sub-region the optimal features are selected with an improved AdaBoost by evaluating their classification ability and independency, finally, the classifier for every sub-region is established with the selected features by training a number of samples. In the test stage, after image acquirement the inspection of a solder joint consists of region division, critical features extraction, classification of sub-regions, and defect diagnosis. The former three steps are executed based on the training results, and in the last step a new defect binary decision tree based on classification and regression tree is used to determine the final defect type. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, various types of solder joints were inspected by an AOI system which integrates with the proposed method. The inspection results have verified the effectiveness of this method in terms of speed and recognition rate. © 2011 IEEE.",

In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a unified terahertz (THz) system operating in the 300 GHz band, with a potential of simultaneously enabling high-speed communication and high-resolution ranging over a common optical infrastructure. Both THz communication and THz sensing signals are generated based on THz photonics and cutting-edge terahertz transceiver technologies. In the experiment, 16-quadrature amplitude modulation modulated THz signal is generated by photo-mixing two free running lasers for the communication, and linear frequency modulated (LFM) THz pulses are generated based on optical interferometer-based frequency-to-time mapping (FTM) for sensing. The experimental results show that up to 56 Gbit/s net rate is successfully transmitted over a 2 m free-space line-of-sight link, and the THz LFM pulses with a time-bandwidth product of up to 207 are successfully generated, which is potentially able to enable a cm-scale range resolution. We also investigate the frequency multiplexing schemes for two signals by changing the channel gap at the transmitter side. To the best of our knowledge, such a system represents the first demonstration of integrated generation system in the THz region above 300 GHz, which has great potential in prospective applications of future converged networks.",

        "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuators are gradually playing an important role in precision positioning applications due to their extremely fine resolution, fast responses, and large actuating forces. However, the existence of hysteresis behaviors makes a big influence on their positioning accuracies. To get high positioning accuracies, hysteresis modeling and control of piezoelectric actuators are meaningful and necessary. This paper reviews different models and control approaches of piezoelectric actuators. Novel categories of both hysteresis models and control approaches are presented. Furthermore, comparisons of different hysteresis models reveal that rate-dependent differential-based modeling is the future research focus. Comparisons of control approaches of piezoelectric actuators are presented and feedforward-feedback control and feedback control are the emphasis in the future.",

Mohr’s integral is used to derive the small-displacement compliance analytical model of the conic curve segments. Further, the stiffness models of the translational joints are obtained using a matrix approach that sums the transformed local-frame compliance matrices of individual component segments, which are verified by taking advantages of the finite element method. The shape parameters of the translational joints are then optimized to maximize the motion range while keeping the off-axis/axial stiffness ratio above a specified limit. The optimum translational joint designs are then applied to construct 2-DOF micro-positioning stages, with experiments carried out to determine the effectiveness of design and analysis.",

        "abstract": "Considering the nonlinearity and uncertainty of a high-speed flexible parallel mechanism, a robust model predictive control strategy was presented to suppress the vibration response of the system. Piezoceramic patch actuator and strain gauge sensors were used. The finite element method and modal truncation technique were applied to obtain the dynamic model of the mechanism. The nonlinear, coupling factors and high-order modal effects existing in the dynamic model of the system were considered as disturbances. The modal force was treated as an uncertain disturbance and the measurement noise was considered. The predictive model of the system dynamic response was introduced and the output was forecasted by the model. A Kalman filter estimator was designed to estimate the state variables of the system. A standard quadratic programming optimization problem was formed where the performance index function minimizes a quadratic performance function. The constraints were the control input voltage and its change rate. The optimization problem was solved to obtain the optimal control output voltages and a rolling optimization control system was then constructed to suppress the vibration response of the system. The optimum placements of the actuators and sensors were determined by using the controllability index featured as actuating energy and the observability index featured as signal energy. Taking a novel 2-DoF parallel mechanism as an example, the experimental modal method was applied to obtain the first two natural frequencies and damping ratios. Comparing with the results obtained by the finite element method, it shows that the theoretical model is not accurate enough. Using dSPACE real-time simulation system and MATLAB/Simulink, the control system was built and the vibration control experimental study was carried out. The experimental results show the proposed controller can effectively suppress the vibration response, and the effectiveness and robustness of the controller was verified.",

In order to improve the image quality, a Retinex enhancemenf algorithm with scale optimization is proposed. This algorithm uses the contrast to design an optimization criterion of Gauss smoother convolution kernel scale for the reasonable estimation of illumination component. The algorithm is then applied to the enhancement of simulated images and micro-vision images generated under various coaxial light intensities. The results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the homomorphic filtering one because it improves the contrast and reserves the image details within the dynamic compressing range.",

Geometrically nonlinear structural response is calculated using a Total-Lagrange finite element formulation and the equilibrium is found using an incremental scheme combined with Newton-Raphson iterations. The multiobjective topology optimization problem is established by the minimum compliance and maximum geometric advantage to design a mechanism which meets both stiffness and flexibility requirements, respectively. The weighted sum of conflicting objectives resulting from the norm method is used to generate the optimal compromise solutions, and the decision function is set to select the preferred solution. The solid isotropic material with penalization approach is used in design of compliant mechanisms. The sensitivities of the objective functions are found with the adjoint method and the optimization problem is solved using the method of moving asymptotes. These methods are further investigated and realized with the numerical examples, which are simulated to show the availability of this approach.",

        "abstract": "The level set method has recently been proposed and studied as a novel structural topology optimization method, which is flexible in handling complex topological changes and concise in describing the boundary shape of the structure. In this paper, first, some numerical issues are discussed, such as the solution of Hamilton-Jacobi equations, the re-initialization of the level set function and the extension of velocity fields. Then, several robust and effective numerical technologies, which are important to the implementation of the level set method, are proposed. For example, the upwind difference scheme is used to solve Hamilton-Jacobi equations, the signature function is modified to ensure the numerical stability, and the fast scanning method is developed to construct extension velocities. Moreover, based on the level set method, a topology optimization model for compliant mechanisms is presented. Finally, the proposed level set method is illustrated by the topology optimization of a displacement inverter.",

The main goal of it is to estimate the motion of scenes and objects as accurate as possible. In the optical flow estimation, outliers may lead to undesirable results and greatly reduce the motion estimation precision. In order to solve these problems, an improved robust multi-scale algorithm of hierarchical motion estimation is proposed. In this algorithm, Tukey's bi-weight function is used to automatically adjust the weights of data with different residual errors and to remove the data with excessive residual errors, and a multi-scale pyramid is employed to accurately estimate the motion vector by an iteration gradually from coarseness to fine. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm with strong robustness effectively solves the problem of outliers caused by occlusive background and discontinuous motion and greatly improves the precision of motion estimation.",

        "abstract": "Optical fiber alignment plays an important role in assembling an optical fiber-based system. Proper alignment can improve optical transmission efficiency of the spliced fiber. As for traditional methods, passive alignment has its drawback of less accuracy, and the active method based on optical power sensing is complex and often cannot find the best solution. In this paper, a novel precision closed-loop method for optical fiber alignment based on telecentric lens is introduced. First, to improve the measurement accuracy of the binocular vision system, a quick and high-precision image-processing algorithm for the glass core of an optical fiber is proposed. Then, a stereo matching problem is solved by combining the epipolar constraint with the geometry constraint especially for telecentric lens, and the 3-D recovery of the optical fibers is achieved. Finally, with the help of a proposed simple eye-to-hand calibration for this microalignment system, a coarse-to-fine strategy is put forward to deal with this five-degree-of-freedom alignment task. The experimental results showed that the proposed method had high performance such as prominent precision and strong robustness in 3-D optical fiber alignment.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an algorithm used for the gradient-based motion measurement via the multi-image wavelet transform according to the characteristics of wavelet transform. In this algorithm, the measurement accuracy is greatly improved because the motion between two images is measured via the data of many images. Moreover, in combination with the reliability measure, a multi-level simultaneous time differential is performed for the reliable light-stream constraints of the images via the rapid wavelet transform. As compared with the conventional motion estimation methods, the proposed algorithm based on the multi-level simultaneous wavelet transform avoids the propagation of errors between the decomposed levels, thus improving the measurement accuracy. The simulated results by experiments show that the proposed algorithm is not only accurate but also easy to implement.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Thin films of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) semiconductor were deposited on glass substrates by a thermal evaporation system using the CuPc powder in a high vacuum. The crystal structures of both the films and the powder were measured by the X-ray diffraction spectroscopy technique. It is observed that CuPc films only show one peak at 6.84°, indicating a high texture of α phase along (200) orientation. In comparison, CuPc powder shows a series of peaks, which are confirmed from the mixture of both α and β phases. The effects of substrate anneal temperature on the film structure, grain size and optical absorption property of CuPc films were also investigated. All the films are of α phase and the full width of half maximum for (200) diffraction peak becomes narrow with increasing the substrate temperatures. The average grain size calculated by the Scherrer’s formula is 33.63 nm for the film without anneal, which is increased up to 58.29 nm for the film annealed at 200 °C. Scanning electron microscope was further measured to prove the growth of crystalline grain and to characterize the morphologies of CuPc films. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra were employed to study the structure effect on the optical properties of both CuPc films and powder. Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy was used to identify the crystalline nature of both CuPc powder and film.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A high-quality broadband radio frequency linear frequency modulation (RF-LFM) signal generation method based on the optical frequency quadrupling and the direct digital waveform synthesize (DDWS) with time-domain pre-distortion compensation is theoretical analyzed and experimental demonstrated. In this method, the optical frequency quadrupling is realized by beating the higher-order sidebands using a dual-parallel Mach–Zehnder modulator (DPMZM) so as to achieve the RF-LFM signal output. Since this optical frequency quadrupling link will induce the amplitude and phase distortions for the LFM signal, a time-domain pre-distortion compensation technique is used based on polynomial fitting. The experimental result shows that a LFM signal with the bandwidth 12 GHz and pulse width    10    μ  s    at the central frequency 22 GHz can be obtained. With the pre-distortion compensation the output LFM spectrum flatness is improved from 6dB to 2dB, the phase error is reduced from 30°to 5°, and the peak side lobe ratio (PSLR) is improved from -10.12dB to -13.01dB, which is close to the theoretical value -13.26dB.",

However, the classical Bouc-Wen model cannot characterize rate-dependent hysteresis under excitations at high frequencies precisely. In this paper, an enhanced Bouc-Wen model is developed by introducing the frequency of input voltage based on the classical Bouc-Wen model. A number of experiments were conducted to characterize the rate-dependent hysteresis of piezoelectric ceramic actuators under sinusoidal excitations at a range of 1-150 Hz. The measured data were used to demonstrate the validity of the developed model. A method of parameter estimation based on the Matlab/Simulink parameter estimation tool is adopted to identify the parameters of models. The comparisons of experiments and simulations show that the developed model can describe rate-dependent hysteresis more accurately than the classical Bouc-Wen model. The modeling errors of the developed model were decreased by nearly 75% compared with that of the classical Bouc-Wen model. The root-mean-square error of the developed model is controlled in 0.1719 m.",

The structural and photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of the films were characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique, Energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and water splitting experiment. The film fabricated at 500 °C shows the strongest diffraction peak of α-Fe 2 O 3 . EDS shows the films are composed of Fe, O and Pt, which were confirmed by the XPS measurement. The water splitting experiment indicates the doping of Pt is effective to enhance the PEC response. The film fabricated at 500 °C shows a maximum photocurrent density of 0.34 mA/cm 2  at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under standard illumination conditions (AM 1.5 G 100 mW/cm 2 ). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency was also measured to understand the PEC water splitting for the present photoanodes.",

Firstly, a homomorphic filtering method for image enhancement is used to correct uneven brightness and enhance contrast. Then biweight function is used to automatically adjust the weights of the data with different residual errors and remove the data with excessive residual errors; and a multi-scale pyramid is employed to accurately estimate the motion vectors through iterations gradually from coarseness to fineness. Experimental result show that the new algorithm has good robustness, it can effectively weaken the interference of uneven illumination and reduce the influence of outliers caused by noise and motion discontinuity; the accuracy of micro-motion measurement reaches 0.01 pixels.",

Dynamic model of planar 3-RRR flexible parallel robots was formed by the finite element method, the floating frame of reference, Lagrange equation and the principle of virtual work. The nonlinear dynamic equation with rigid-elastic coupling was established, in which lumped masses and moments of inertia of each joints and the moving platform were considered. The constraint relationship between elastic motion coordinates and rigid ones was studied in detail. According to numerical simulations based on small deformation hypothesis and Comparisons of the proposed method with simplified KED one, it is shown that centrifugal and Coriolis forces of the rigid motion in the system, and time-varying characteristic of the transformation matrix give most important influences on dynamic characteristics of the system.",

An integrated inspection approach based on the machine vision was presented in the study. The method developed in this paper can identify the major defects of the solder paste depositing, such as displacement, deficiency, excess, bridge and overflow. Firstly, position compensation is applied to improve the inspection accuracy. Secondly, an image enhancement algorithm based on the texture is developed, which can enlarge the differences of the grayscale values between the PCB images and the solder paste images. Thirdly, the images of the printed PCB are analyzed by using the particle analysis method and the two-dimensional (2D) inspection results are obtained. A pseudo three-dimensional (3D) inspection approach is further proposed to identify the defects in the 3D state.

        "abstract": "Based on metallic traveling-wave ring-slot structure, an easily realized four-orbital angular momentum (OAM)-mode antenna capable of generating four coaxially propagating waves with OAM modes of l = -3, -2, +2, and +3, respectively, is experimentally demonstrated at 10 GHz. The feeding network is simply implemented using two 90 hybrid couplers. A ring-focus double-reflector with a favorable focus-diameter-ratio is specially designed to gain a high directivity. The main characteristics of the antenna-such as S-parameters, directivity, and near-field radiation-are presented both in simulation and experiment. Employing a pair of four-OAM-mode antennas, the experiment shows that the near-field OAM-based radio communication channels are naturally isolated.",

The various image noises that can cause measurement error are analyzed. On the basis of the analysis, the methods of reducing noises are presented by analyzing the typical MEMS image acquired by computer micro-vision system for micro-motion measurement. The analysis shows the validity of the processing approach as follow for microstructure images acquired by this system:firstly, the shot noise can be reduced using a median filter, and the high frequency noise can be decreased using a low pass filter;secondly, the effect of fixed-pattern noise can be reduced using a two-point correction technique;additionally, the approach of increasing the exposure time can be used to minimize the effect of the mechanical noise.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a feature selection and a two-stage classifier for solder joint inspection have been proposed. Using a three-color (red, green, and blue) hemispherical light-emitting diode array illumination and a charge-coupled device color digital camera, images of solder joints can be obtained. The color features, including the average gray level and the percentage of highlights and template-matching feature, are extracted. After feature selection, based on the algorithm of Bayes, each solder joint is classified by its qualification. If the solder joint fails in the qualification test, it is classified into one of the pre-defined types based on support vector machine. The choice of the second stage classifier is based on the performance evaluation of various classifiers. The proposed inspection system has been implemented and tested with various types of solder joints in surface-mounted devices. The experimental results showed that the proposed scheme is not only more efficient, but also increases the recognition rate, because it reduces the number of needed extracted features.",

        "abstract": "In order to overcome the disadvantages of the existing automatic optical inspection (AOI) algorithm for solder joints, a new inspection algorithm based on weighted bidirectional 2D linear discrimination analysis is proposed, which takes into account the characteristics of AOI and improves the conventional bidirectional 2D linear discrimination analysis by weighting different classes and samples during the calculation of covariance matrix. By this algorithm, more discriminative features can be extracted. The improved algorithm is then applied to the solder joint inspection to automatically classify the solders from different batches. Experimental results show that, as compared with the commonly-used algorithm based on image comparison or image analysis, the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the misdiagnosis rate with the detection speed meeting the practical demands well.",

In the extraction, first, the optimized topology solution is mapped into intermediate variables via nonlinear transformation to ensure the side constraints imposed on the direct topology variables. Then, the intermediate variables are decomposed into approximated and detail coefficients via wavelet transform, and the approximated coefficients are further treated via cubic spline interpolation. After that, the approximated coefficients are reconstructed by wavelet and the corresponding topology result is obtained by the anti-nonlinear transformation of the reconstructed coefficients. Finally, based on the volume restriction of topology optimization, the obtained result is evaluated and the wavelet decomposition scale is determined. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively remove the checkerboard patterns in an optimized topology solution and extract the expected topology of a compliant mechanism.",

For a 3-RRR planar parallel manipulator, it is divided as three flexible sub-structures and a rigid moving platform. Because flexible sub-structures are connected by the rigid platform, the geometrical constraint relationship between them represent the influences each other. It is essential to obtain a simple displacement and dynamic relation between them. The flexible sub-structures are modeled by using floating-frame reference method, in which the coupling terms between the rigid-body motion and the flexible deformations and the geometric stiffness term are taken into account. According to the constraint relations, dynamic equations of the rigid platform are obtained. Finally the system dynamic equations can be obtained by assembling all dynamic equations. The displacement and orientation errors of the moving platform are analyzed in different case through numerical simulation. The results show the speed and structural size of the system have significant effects on the errors of the moving platform and the errors are different in different configuration of the manipulator. ©2009 IEEE.",

According to the operating condition of wind turbine airfoils, the compressibility effects and flow separation initiated from the leading edge were neglected. The model includes the effects of near wake and the effects of trailing edge separation. Four aerodynamic states were adopted to describe the dynamics of the unsteady aerodynamic force coefficients: two states were applied to model the time-lag of the near wake effect, and the other two states were used to model the time-lag effect of trailing edge separation. Applying the proposed model, unsteady aerodynamic forces of a FFA-W3-241 wind turbine airfoil during harmonic pitching motion were calculated. The calculation results showed a good agreement with the experimental data, which indicated that the proposed model ould preferably model the unsteady aerodynamic characteristics of wind turbine airfoils. The numerical dynamic stall module was integrated into a wind turbine aerodynamics and structural dynamics analysis software. Applying the software, a simulation of power production load case of a 1.5 MW variable-speed pitch-regulated wind turbine was carried out. The simulation results indicate that unsteady aerodynamic characteristics of airfoils shall be taken into account during wind turbine design process because they significantly affect the transient aerodynamic loads of the rotor.",

This paper presents a simplified method for focusing and astigmatism correction of a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The method consists of two steps. In the first step, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the SEM image is performed and the FFT is subsequently processed with a threshold to achieve a suitable result. In the second step, the threshold FFT is used for ellipse fitting to determine the presence of defocus and astigmatism. The proposed method clearly provides the relationships between the defocus, the astigmatism and the direction of stretching of the FFT, and it can determine the astigmatism in a single image. Experimental studies are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.",

Then, the DOF of the passive limb is analyzed based on the screw theory, and a novel high-speed parallel manipulator containing two active limbs and two passive limbs is presented. The two passive limbs are used to restrict the rotation of the movable platform and to improve the stiffness of the parallel manipulator. Moreover, a dimensional synthesis of the parallel manipulator is carried out based on the kinematic analysis, with the weight values of the mean and maximum condition numbers of Jacobian matrix in the operation space as the performance measures. The results show that the presented manipulator can be combined with a 1-DOF feed mechanism to create a 3-DOF translational hybrid manipulator for the pick- and-place operation in industrial fields.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, some approaches to realize photonic analog-to-digital conversion based on spectral encoding have been proposed. In these approaches, the amplitude information of input analog signals is first converted into the frequency information of the optical carrier via a nonlinear process, which is equivalent to optical frequency modulation; then, the spectral information of the optical carrier is quantized and encoded with the help of an optical filter group. In this letter, we propose, for the first time to our knowledge, that the time-frequency uncertainty principle puts a fundamental limit on this type of photonic analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The condition for achieving acceptable performance in terms of effective number of bits is discussed. The presented theoretical results are verified by numerical simulations and a proof-of-concept experiment in electrical domain. We believe that the presented result is important to the design of spectral-encoding-based photonic ADCs.",

OSV stacking structures of Co/AlOx/CNAP/Ni80Fe20 with different CNAP thicknesses were fabricated, and the transport properties of the OSVs were measured from 300 to 5 K. A magnetoresistance of approximately 1%-2% at 300 K (4%-6% at 5 K) was observed for 15-nm-thick OSVs, showing the potential for organic spintronics based on aromatic hydrocarbon macrocycles.",

Two analytical models, known as specular reflection model and circular scattering model, are applied to evaluate the reflection and scattering effects of wave propagating in the NLoS channels. The performances of the PSOAM-MIMO system in the NLoS channel are compared with those of the conventional MIMO system and in LoS channel. It is found that the capacity gain of the PSOAM-MIMO over MIMO is mainly determined by a direct path. In the NLoS channel, the capacity gain of PSOAM-MIMO over MIMO decreases compared with that in LoS, however, the multi-path effects improve the absolute capacity of PSOAM-MIMO system, and the worst case are comparable with those in an MIMO system. As a result, the PSOAM-MIMO system demonstrates the strong robustness in wireless communications.",

The solder joint images are acquired by a structure illuminator and a 3-CCD color camera. Based on these images, the area features of the conventional types of PCB solder joints such as good, excessive, poor and pseudo are extracted with respect to the key sub-region in the solder joint. Five kinds of feature matrix models of solder joints are presented. A pattern matching algorithm for inspecting the solder joint is developed by maximizing the similarity of the same type of solder joins. To solve the problem of the threshold determined by experiences, a parameter adaptive learning strategy is presented. Finally, 1040 chip solder joints on a PCB are inspected. Experimental results show that the success rate is as high as 96.5% and the inspection time is 9 s by using the proposed algorithm. This indicates that the proposed algorithm can achieve both a high success rate and inspection velocity.",

        "abstract": "Calibration for scanning electron microscope (SEM) based nanorobotic manipulation systems is important and difficult. Most current calibration methods are cumbersome because they require customized high precision calibration boards and repeated calibration procedures in different magnifications. This paper presents a convenient magnification-continuous calibration method with high precision for SEM-based nanorobotic manipulation systems. The projection matrix containing a continuous magnification factor is obtained by modifying the affine camera model. This facilitates the simplification of the parameter computing process. Movement features are used to align the moving axes of micropositioning stages and calibrate the system, which benefits for the realization of efficient automatic calibration. Three experiments are carried out, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and practical for calibrating SEM-based nanorobotic manipulation systems under a wide range of continuous magnifications. Experiments also confirm that high precision measurements can be conducted in different magnifications with only once calibration and the relative error is within 1%.",

        "abstract": "In order to reduce the programming time and overcome the experience dependence on the existing automatic optical inspection (AOI) systems based on feature extraction, an image matching algorithm based on statistical modeling is proposed. In this algorithm, first, qualified sample images of solder joints are separated from the unqualified ones in training. Next, a standard learning template image is formed through a gray-level statistical modeling of the qualified sample images. Then, after an alignment, the component image to be tested is matched with the trained template image. Finally, the difference in pixel point gray is calculated and is used to determine whether the testing component image is qualified or not. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm, with a false alarm rate of less than 2% and a missing report rate of O, helps to obtain satisfying accuracy of AOI and greatly reduces the programming time of users for inspection.",

Then, the attack angle is modified according to the downwash effect caused by unsteady wake flow, based on which the numerical models of the lift force and the thrust force are presented. The experimental results basically accord with the simulated ones, showing a similar tendency of aerodynamic forces during the downstroke and upstroke of the robot. Finally, based on the proposed models, the flying mechanism and aerodynamic characteristics of the flapping-wing robot are further analyzed. It is found that the lift force is generated by both the inner and the outer wings, while the thrust force is mainly by the outer wing; and that, as compared with the lift force, the thrust force is more sensitive to the flap frequency. It is thus concluded that the proposed method is effective in the aerodynamic analysis of biomimetic flapping-wing robots.",

        "abstract": "A two-axis rectangular cross-section corner-filleted flexure hinge as an alternative to the conventional flexure hinges for 3D multi-degrees of freedom compliant mechanisms is presented. The 3D mechanical model of two-axis flexure hinge is established, and the precision of rotation of the flexure hinge is developed on the basis of Castigliano's theorem. The closed-form formulas for the flexure hinge are obtained by the method of substitution. Aiming at errors arising from rotation center deviation of the flexure hinge, the results show that compared with analytical model and the finite element simulation, the error margins are within 7%. It is prove that the analytical model is accurate. Finally, the influence of the structural parameters on the precision of rotation of the flexure hinge is analyzed, and it is concluded that the precision is proportional to the Young's modulus or the shear modulus of the material. When the minimum thickness δ and the minimum width b of the flexure hinge are defined, whether the precision of rotation of the flexure hinge reduces or improves depending on the increment or decrement of the radius R or the beam length l. But the influence of the beam length l is more obvious. When the radius R and the beam length l of the flexure hinge are defined, whether the precision of rotation of the flexure hinge is improved or reduced depends on the increment or decrement of the minimum thickness δ or the minimum width b. Some theoretical principles for engineering design of flexure hinges are provided from the above conclusions. © 2010 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.",

The vibration-induced optical phase variation is directly converted to the electrical oscillating signal of the OEO with carrier phase-shifted double-sideband (CPS-DSB) modulation, which is realized by cascading a dual-output Mach-Zehnder modulator (DOMZM) and a fiber interferometer. Theoretically, within a CPS-DSB modulated OEO, the minimum detectable optical phase shift is determined by the phase noise achievable, and the sensitivity of the optical phase shift demodulation no longer depends on its frequency. A proof-of-concept OEO oscillating at 100 MHz with ultralow phase noise is built for demonstration. The achieved minimum detectable optical phase shift is 0.58  μrad/√Hz at 1 kHz and 0.21  μrad/√Hz at 10 kHz, which are the best results ever reported, to the best of our knowledge.",

This paper develops a novel damped circular hinge with integrated comb-like substructures, and derives a mathematical model of loss factor of the flexure hinge and builds its pseudo-rigid body model with damping. The damped flexure hinges can be fabricated in a hybrid process with additive material manufacturing or mounting, and damping-material filling by means of some designed aided tools. For the actual fabricated damped circular hinges, their modal loss factors in a specified sandwiched-damping-layer configuration are obtained based on experimental modal analysis, as indicate that sandwiched damping can effectively suppress the bending modal vibration and the damping can be reinforced progressively with a damping-layer number. Meanwhile, based on finite element analysis, loss factor of the damped flexure hinge and its mathematical model are verified. The actual and simulation experimental results indicate that the presented comb-like damped substructures can be effectively functioned as a modular damper for a circular hinge and the damped flexure hinge can be designed independently of its damping and stiffness when low elastic viscoelastic material adopted.",

This paper presents a method for designing the single-axis flexure hinges in the topology level. Two kinds of hinges, that is, the translational hinge and the revolute hinge, are studied. The basic optimization models are developed for topology optimization of the translational hinge and the revolute hinge, respectively. The objective for topology optimization of flexure hinges is to maximize the compliance in the desired direction meanwhile minimizing the compliances in the other directions.

        "abstract": "A robust multiscale algorithm of hierarchical estimation for gradient-based motion estimation was proposed, by a combination of robust estimation method and multiscale technique. In such a multiscale approach of hierarchical estimation, the motions at each level of the pyramid were estimated by using different gradient filters. Robust estimators were applied at each level of the pyramid to overcome the problem of outliers, caused by illumination variations and motion discontinuities in motion estimation, thus the estimator accuracy was further improved. Experimental simulations show that the new algorithm provides a significant improvement in estimator accuracy, and achieves computational speedups for motion measurement of MEMS image in the presence of noise.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A coherently demodulated orbital angular momentum shift keying (OAM-SK) system over free-space turbulence channels using an image identifier based on convolutional neural network (CNN) as demodulator is proposed in this paper. Compared to the incoherent system, the proposed approach has the advantages of higher signal-to-ratio (SNR) of the detected image and fewer OAM topology charges employed for the same m-ary OAM-SK system. The CNN-based image identifier features in high recognition accuracy even under long free-space transmission and strong turbulence. In addition, the influence of the intensity of the local beam on the system performance, as well as the trade-off between the signal-to-noise ratio and the contrast of the received images, is fully investigated. Simulation results show that the demodulation accuracy of the proposed system with 16-ary OAM-SK system can be as high as    u003e  99  %    for    1500    m    of free-space optical (FSO) transmission distance with strong atmospheric turbulence and appropriate intensity of local Gaussian beam.",

To overcome these shortcomings, periodically corrugated cantilever beam is applied to design compliant joints. Basic corrugated beam unit is modeled by using pseudo-rigid-body method. The trajectory and deformation behavior of periodically corrugated cantilever beam are estimated by the transformation of coordinate and superposition of the deformation of corrugated beam units. Finite element analysis (FEA) is carried out on corrugated cantilever beam to estimate the accuracy of the pseudo-rigid-body model. Results show that the kinetostatic behaviors obtained by this method, which has a relative error less than 6%, has good applicability and corrugated cantilever beam has the characteristics of a large range of motion and high mechanical strength. The corrugated cantilever beam is then applied to design a flexible rotational joint to obtain a larger angle output. The paper proposes a pseudo-rigid-body model for corrugated cantilever beam and designed a flexible rotational joint with large angle output. ?

The particles have been systematically characterized by X-ray diffraction technique, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometer, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and UV–vis spectra. It is found that a wide range of NaOH concentration of 1–3 M could induce a high crystalline quality of BFO. Interestingly, it is noted that different NaOH concentrations have a significant effect on the morphology of BFO particles. With the increase of NaOH concentration, the morphology changes from alveolate BFO to cubic BFO particles. Moreover, the light absorption characteristics and the band gap of BFO particles are strongly dependent on their morphology. This result in the difference of photocatalytic degradation ability of alveolate BFO particles compared to that of cubic BFO particles.",

First, the single LED irradiating model is built based on analyzing its irradiance properties. Second, the case of two LEDs irradiating is set as an example to analyze superposition properties of the same color light for any specified pointu0027s light brightness based on the built single LED irradiating model, and then the irradiating model of LEDs is developed. Third, the structure illumination design method of LEDs ring arrays is illustrated based on the proposed design model of illumination uniformity. Especially, the illumination design method is decomposed into two subproblems to simplify the design process, which can reduce the design difficulty.

        "abstract": "To automate present Automatic Optical Inspection (AOI) systems, an intelligent method based on incremental clustering for solder joint inspection is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to meet the demands of practical production, the framework for an intelligent AOI system is designed. Then, all the defects of solder joints are classified into several different types according to their appearances, and the color features in critical regions are extracted. The samples in each class are clustered into several subclasses so that the system is able to inspect solders from different batches. Finally, a new incremental clustering algorithm is proposed. The AOI system can automatically adjust inspection parameters according to the feedback from the repair station. To improve training efficiency, only a few samples are selected. The method proposed is used in an AOI to inspect solder joints, and the inspecting accuracy can reach 96.5% while each solder inspection takes 9.3 ms. The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed method can detect accurately a solder defect from different patches, and can be modified for different manufacturing processes. The intelligence level of the system using the proposed method is high, and it can be used in practical application.",

        "abstract": "Discrepancies of speckle images under dynamic measurement due to the different viewing angles will deteriorate the correspondence in 3D digital image correlation (3D-DIC) for vibration measurement. Facing this kind of bottleneck, this paper presents two types of robust 3D-DIC methods for vibration measurement, SSD-robust and SWD-robust, which use a sum of square difference (SSD) estimator plus a Geman-McClure regulating term and a Welch estimator plus a Geman-McClure regulating term, respectively. Because the regulating term with an adaptive rejecting bound can lessen the influence of the abnormal pixel data in the dynamical measuring process, the robustness of the algorithm is enhanced. The robustness and precision evaluation experiments using a dual-frequency laser interferometer are implemented. The experimental results indicate that the two presented robust estimators can suppress the effects of the abnormality in the speckle images and, meanwhile, keep higher precision in vibration measurement in contrast with the traditional SSD method; thus, the SWD-robust and SSD-robust methods are suitable for weak image noise and strong image noise, respectively.

        "title": "A high efficient frequency analysis method for closed flexible mechanism systems",
        "abstract": "L’analyse de fréquence constitue un maillon important pour prédire les performences dynamique du mécanisme flexible. D’après les caractéristiques du mécanisme flexible fermé, on présente ici, une méthode très efficace pour l’analyse de fréquence dans le mécanisme de multi-barres planes et celui de linkage spatial, discute la division de substructure et la génération de base modale, et introduit l’équation d’accouplement de la substructure typique à l’aide des techniques réunies de la modalitéde libre-interface. Les calculs numériques montrent que la présente méthode est efficiente et infaillible. 1 Introduction Mechanisms are now being required to run at higher speeds while maintaining greater positioning accuracy. The investigation of the dynamic analysis of flexible linkage mechanisms has been undertaken by many researchers for the past 20 years or so within which the finite element method (FEM) is widely used. In the analysis process, an important substance is to determine modal parameters, because the modal parameters are important indices to evaluate the dynamic characteristics of the system. The linkage mechanisms are typical time-varying systems, which were regarded as position-dependent systems in many references such as [1–8] . This means that the modal analysis must be done at each time subinterval in one operation cycle. From this we can see that modal analysis, especially for the multi-bar and spatial mechanisms within which the number of degrees of freedom is large, is a very time-consuming task. From references [9–15] we know that flexible mechanisms exhibit the lower resonance phenomena at certain running speeds, and the effective way to prevent the phenomena is to impose frequency constraints in the design process [16] , in which frequency analysis is needed in each iteration. Although the FEM is an effective method in analyzing flexible mechanisms, it contains various computational difficulties, especially when the number of degrees of freedom is large. In order to increase the computational efficiency, it is necessary to develop an efficient frequency analysis method for flexible linkage mechanisms. Substructure synthesis is a method of matrix order reduction for structural dynamic analysis. A complete structural system is to be decomposed into several substructures. The motion of each substructure is represented by a set of substructure modes that accommodate the system eigenvalues and modes of interest. The original substructures are then represented by a reduced number of degrees of freedom, which are coupled together to result in a smaller problem size. Computationally, this represents a more desirable method of analysis than analysing the complete structural system, as long as the reduced structure can adequately respond in the dynamic loading environment. References [17–19] survey most of the available methods. Substructure coupling methods can be classified as fixed-interface methods, free-interface methods, or hybrid methods, depending upon whether the mode shapes used to define substructure coordinates obtained with the interface coordinates are fixed, free, or a combination of the two [20] . Utilizing the fixed-interface component mode synthesis (CMS) method, the dynamic behavior of an industrial robotic manipulator is investigated by Sunada and Dubowsky in reference [21] . More attention has been paid to the free-interface method [22] because it is suitable for using with experimental modal data. In this paper, based on the characteristics of the linkage mechanisms, an efficient frequency analysis procedure is presented by utilizing the free-interface component mode synthesis (FCMS) method. The equations for coupling of substructures are developed and examples are given. The modal parameters calculated by the synthesized model were compared to those obtained by the finite element method, which indicates that the method is valid, and the computational efficiency is increased dramatically. 2 Substructure division and modal analysis For linkage mechanisms, substructures can be divided according to the way of combination. For example, in the planar linkage mechanisms, each Assur group can be regarded as a substructure. Dividing like this, the coupling eigenequation of motion of the system is relatively simple, but the convergence of the modal series for the component is relatively poor, in addition, the modal parameters of this kind of substructures are difficult to test. In view of this, we look upon each flexible link as one substructure in the analysis procedure. The method is based upon dividing the fundamental time period of the linkage mechanism into an appropriate number of sub-intervals; during each sub-interval the time-dependent coefficients of the differential equations are assumed to be invariant. When the mechanism is vibrating in a natural mode, the equation of motion of the researched substructure can be expressed as follows in one time subinterval. (1) [M]{ u ̈ }+[K]{u}={Q} where [ M ] and [ K ] represent the mass and stiffness matrices of the substructure, respectively and { u } and { ü } are the substructure displacement and acceleration vectors in the system coordinate, respectively. { Q } is the force vector applied at the substructure, which can be partitioned into two groups according to the interior and junction (interface) coordinates as: (2) {Q}= 0 i >Q j The generalized coordinate vector { u } can be transformed as: (3) {u}=[Φ]{p} where [ Φ ] is the mass normalized eigenvector matrix of the substructure, and {p} is the vector of modal coordinates associated with [ Φ ]. Eq. (3) can be partitioned as: (4) {u}=[Φ R Φ k Φ d ] p R p k >p d where [ Φ R ] is the rigid body mode matrix, [ Φ k ] is the kept natural mode matrix, and [ Φ d ] is the higher mode matrix. Subscripts R, k and d represent the number of the rigid body modes, kept natural modes, and the higher natural modes, respectively. Vectors { p R }, { p k }, and { p d } are modal coordinates associated with matrices [ Φ R ], [ Φ k ], and [ Φ d ]. Substituting Eq. (4) into Eq. (1) , partitioning [ Φ d ] according to the interior and the junction coordinates, and considering Eq. (2) yields: (5) { p ̈ d }+[Λ d ]{p d }=[Φ jd ] T {Q j } where [ Λ d ]=diag[ ω 2 l +1 , …, ω 2 n ], 1=R+k, n is the number of the generalized coordinates of the substructure. Neglecting the dynamic term of Eq. (5) , { p d } can be obtained by solving the pseudo-static equation, and substituting { p d } into Eq. (4) yields: (6) {u}=[Φ l Ψ d ] p l >Q j where (7) [Ψ d ]=[Φ d ][Λ d ] −1 [Φ j d ],[Φ l ]=[Φ R Φ k ] When the higher modal parameters are not known, the term [ ψ d ] can be calculated using the following equation [20, 23] : (8) [Ψ d ]=([Θ] T [G][Θ]−[Φ k ][Λ k ] -1 [Φ k ] T )[F A ] where (9, 10) [Θ]=[I]−[M][Φ R ][Φ R ] T ,[F A ]=[0 T ij I T jj ] term [ I ] is the identity matrix, [ G ] is the flexibility matrix relative to the imposed constraints. 3 Coupling of the substructures Substituting Eq. (3) into Eq. (1) , using the orthogonality of modal vectors, and expressing them in matrix form yields: (11) ((−ω 2 [I]+[Λ l ]{p l }) (α) =([Φ jl ] T {Q j }) (α) Rearranging Eq. (6) , the junction coordinate vector can be expressed as: (12) {u j } (α) =([Φ jl ] T {p l }) (α) +([Ψ j d ]{Q j }) (α) where α represents the number of the substructure, { u j } ( α ) is the set of junction coordinates for the α th substructure. [ Φ jl ] and [ ψ j d ] are sub-matrices of [ Φ l ] and [ ψ d ] associated with the junction coordinates. As shown in Fig. 1 assuming that the frame-connected link is substructure, 1, which is joined with substructure 2, the compatibility of displacements and equilibrium of forces at the interface can be expressed by the following equations: (13) {u j } (1) ={u j A } (2) (14) {Q j } (1) +{Q j A } (2) =0 where { u j A } and { Q j A } are the junction coordinate vector and the junction force vector at the interface A. By combining Eqs. (12)-(14) one can obtain: (15) {Q j } (1) =[A]([Φ jl A ] (2) {p l }−[Φ jl ] (1) {p l } (1) ) (16) {Q j A } (2) =−{Q j } (1) where (17) [A]=([Ψ j d ] (1) +[Ψ j dA ] (2) ) −1 [ Φ jl A ] (2) and [ ψ j dA ] (2) are sub-matrices of [ Φ jl ] (2) and [ ψ j d ] (2) , respectively, at interface A. Substituting Eq. (5) into Eq. (11) , the coupling equation of the two substructures can be expressed as: (18) [[Λ l ] (1) +[Φ jl ] T (1) [A][Φ jl ] (1) −[Φ jl ] T (1) [A][Φ jl A ] (2) ] p (1) l >p (2) l −ω 2 {p (1) l }=0 where [ Λ l ] ( α ) =diag[0, …, 0, ω 2 1 , …, ω 2 k ] As shown in Fig. 2 , there are two pairs (pair A and pair B) on substructure 2 which is joined with substructures 1 and 3, respectively. The compatibility of displacements and equilibrium of forces at interfaces A and B can be expressed as: (19) {u j A } (2) ={u j A } (1) , {Q j A } (2) +{Q j A } (1) =0 (20) {u j B } (2) ={u j B } (3) , {Q j B } (2) +{Q j B } (3) =0 By combining Eqs. (11)-(12), (19)-(20) one can obtain the coupling equation of the three substructures as follows: (21) [−[Φ jl A ] T (2) [A][Φ jl A ] (1) [Λ l ] (2) +[Φ jl A ] T (2) [A][Φ jl A ] (2) +[Φ jl B ] T (2) [B][Φ jl B ] (2) −[Φ jl B ] T (2) [B]Φ jl B ] (3) ] p (1) l p (2) l >p (3) l −ω 2 {p (2) l }=0 where (22) [A]=([Ψ j dA ] (1) +[Ψ j dA ] (2) ) −1 (23) [B]=([Ψ j dB ] (2) +[Ψ j dB ] (3) ) −1 [ ψ j dA ] ( α ) , [ ψ j dB ] ( α ) , [ Φ jl A ] ( α ) and [ Φ jl B ] ( α ) are submatrices of [ ψ j d ] ( α ) and [ Φ jl ] ( α ) , respectively, at interface A and B. As shown in Fig. 3 , there are three pairs (pair A, pair B, and pair C) on substructure 2 which is joined with substructures 1, 3, and 4, respectively. The compatibility of displacements and equilibrium of forces at interfaces A, B, and C can be expressed as: (24) {u j A } (2) ={u j A } (1) ,{Q j A } (2) +{Q j A } (1) =0 (25) {u j B } (2) ={u j B } (3) ,{Q j B } (2) +{Q j B } (3) =0 (26) {u j C } (2) ={u j C } (4) ,{Q j C } (2) +{Q j C } (4) =0 By combining Eqs. (11) and (12) ,. and (24)–(26), one can obtain the coupling equation of substructures 2, 1, 3, and 4 as follows: (27) [−[Φ jl A ] T (2) [A][Φ jl A ] (1) [Λ l ] (2) +[Φ jl A ] T (2) [A][Φ jl A ] (2) +[Φ jl B ] T (2) [B][Φ jl B ] (2) +[Φ jl C ] T (2) [C][Φ jl C ] (2) −[Φ jl B ] T (2) [B][Φ jl B ] (3) −[Φ jl C ] T (2) [C][Φ jl C ] (4) ] p (1) l p (2) l p l (4) >p (4) l −ω 2 {p (2) l }=0 where (28) [A]=([Ψ j dA ] (1) +[Ψ j dA ] (2) ) −1 (29) [B]=([Ψ j dB ] (2) +[Ψ j dB ] (3) ) -1 (30) [C]=([Ψ j dC ] (2) +[Ψ j dC ] (4) ) −1 [ ψ j dA ] ( α ) , [ ψ j dB ] ( α ) , [ ψ j dC ] ( α ) , [ Φ jl A ] ( α ) , [ Φ jl B ] ( α ) and [ Φ jl C ] ( α ) are submatrices of [ ψ j d ] ( α ) and [ Φ jl ] ( α ) , respectively, at interfaces A, B, and C. For the substructures with still more pairs, the coupling equations can be developed in the same way. They are not listed here for conciseness. As shown in Fig. 4 , there is a multiple joint A on substructure 1 which is joined with substructures 2, 3, 4, …, r , respectively. The compatibility of displacement and equilibrium of forces at interface A can be expressed as follows: (31) {u j A } (1) ={u j A } (2) {u j A } (2) ={u j A } (3) … {u j A } r−1 ={u j A } (r) >{Q j A } (1) +{Q j A } (2) +⋯+{Q j A } (r) =0 By combining Eqs. (12) and (31) , { Q j A } (1) , { Q j A } ( r ) , …, { Q j A } ( r ) can be obtained. The coupling equation can then be developed by using Eq. (11) . 3.1 Applications Using the results developed in the preceding sections, we can easily obtain the coupling equation of the whole linkage mechanism systems. As shown in Fig. 5 , which is a six-bar planar mechanism. The mechanism can be divided into five substructures, which include three frame-connected substructures, one binary substructure, and one ternary substructure. Combining the results obtained in the preceding sections, the coupling eigenequation of the mechanism is obtained as: (32) G 11 G 12 0 0 0 G T 12 G 22 G 23 G 24 0 0 G T 23 G 33 0 0 0 G T 24 0 G 44 G 45 0 0 0 G T 45 G 55 p (1) l p (2) l p (3) l p (4) l >p (5) l =ω 2 p (1) l p (2) l p (3) l p (4) l >p (5) l where [G 11 ] =[Λ l ] (1) +[Φ jl ] T (1) [A][Φ jl ] (1) [G 12 ] =[Φ jl ] T (1) [A][Φ jl A ] (2) [G 22 ] =[Λ l ] (2) +[Φ jl A ] T (2) [A][Φ jl A ] (2) +[Φ jl B ] T (2) [B][Φ jl B ] (2) +[Φ jl C ] T (2) [C][Φ jl C ] (2) [G 23 ] =−[Φ jl B ] T (2) [B][Φ jl B ] (3) [G 24 ] =−[Φ jl C ] T (2) [C][Φ jl C ] (4) [G 33 ] =[Λ l ] (3) +[Φ jl B ] T (3) ] T (3) [B][Φ jl B ] (3) [G 44 ] =[Λ l ] (4) +[Φ jl C ] T (4) [C][Φ jl C ] (4) +[Φ jl D ] T (4) [D][Φ jl D ] (4) [G 45] =[Φ jl D ] T (4) [D][Φ jl (5) [G 55 ] =[Λ l ] (5) +[Φ jl ] T (4) [D][Φ jl ] (5) [D] =([Ψ jl D ] (4) +[Ψ jl ] (5) ) −1 Shown in Fig. 6 is a RSS′R flexible spatial mechanism. The mechanism can be divided into 3 substructures, which include two frame-connected substructures and one binary substructure. By using the results listed in the preceding sections, the coupling eigenequation of the spatial mechanism can be expressed as: (33) G 11 G 12 0 G T 12 G 22 G 23 0 G T 23 G 33 p (1) l p (2) l >p (3) l =ω 2 p (1) l p (2) l >p (3) l where G 11 , G 12 , G 22 , G 23 , [G 33 ]=[Λ l ] (3) +[Φ jl ] T (3) [B][Φ jl ] (3) 4 Numerical examples To demonstrate the feasibility of the method, two linkage mechanisms as shown in Figs. 5 and 6 are analysed numerically. In the numerical examples, the first 10 frequencies are calculated. The analysis results are compared with the finite element analysis results. The six-bar linkage mechanism was constructed of aluminum strips having the following dimensions: L OA =0.1 m, L AC =0.35 m, L BC =0.05 m, L BE = L CD =0.24 m, L DF =0.3 m, L OE = L EF =0.2 m, b 1 = b 2 = b 3 = b 4 = b 5 =25 mm, h 1 =4 mm, h 2 = h 3 = h 5 =3 mm, h 4 =2 mm. Mass density ρ =2700 kg/m 3 , Young’s modulus E=7.0×10 10 N/m 2 . The fundamental time period is divided into 80 equal time subintervals within which the system parameters are assumed to be constant. The geometrical parameters of the RSS′R mechanism are as follows: s 0 = s 3 =0.7 m, h 0 =0.35 m, h 1 =0.25 m, h 3 =0.55 m, L =1.1 m, α 23 =0, α 30 =1.5 π . The cross section of each member is circular, the value of the diameter is 25.0 mm, Material, mass density, and Young’s modulus are identical to those of the six-bar mechanism. Shown in Table 1 are part results of the first and the third natural frequencies of the two mechanisms in one operation cycle within which the finite element method analysis results are also presented. Fig. 7 illustrates the vibration in the first, second and the third mode natural frequencies with crank angle for the FCMS and FEM results of the two mechanisms. The dot line and the solid line indicate the FCMS analytical results and the FEM analytical results, respectively. From Table 1 and Fig. 7 we can see that the analytical results of the FCMS method agree reasonably well with the FEM analytical data. In the finite element analysis process, the generalized coordinates of the six-bar linkage mechanism and the RSS′R mechanism are 45 and 48, respectively. The analysis time required for the two mechanisms in one period are 23 min, 44 s and 31 min, 40 s, respectively, on the IBM-PS2 computer. Utilizing the FCMS procedure presented in this paper the coordinates of the two mechanisms are reduced to 22 and 14, respectively, and the associated analysis time are reduced to 7 min, 47 s and 12 min, 10 s, respectively. 5 Conclusions A vibration analysis method for the flexible linkage mechanism systems has been developed based on the free-interface component mode synthesis theory. To verify the method, two numerical examples were presented. Comparisons with the FEM results have shown that the method was able to predict properly the modal parameters within errors of 1.0% for planar linkage mechanisms and 2.5% for spatial mechanisms. The time required for the modal analysis can be significantly reduced. Thus the method is especially useful in solving optimal mechanism design problems with frequency constraints [16] . The method described in this paper can also be used in the frequency analysis for open-chain mechanism systems.

Considering the direct and inverse piezoelectric effect of PZT material, a general motion equation is established. A strain rate feedback controller is designed based on the established general motion equation. Four control schemes are designed in this experiment: three passive flexible links are controlled at the same time, only passive flexible link 1 is controlled, only passive flexible link 2 is controlled, and only passive flexible link 3 is controlled. The experimental results show that only one flexible link controlled scheme  suppresses elastic vibration and cannot suppress the elastic vibration of the other flexible links, whereas when three passive flexible links are controlled at the same time, they are able to effectively suppress the elastic vibration of all of the flexible links. In general, the experiment verifies that a strain rate feedback controller is able to effectively suppress the elastic vibration of the flexible links of plane 3-RRR flexible parallel robots.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In a piezoelectric-driven microgripper, obtaining parallel grasping and enlarging grasping stroke are important. This paper presents the nonlinear analysis and optimal design of a novel orthogonal displacement amplification mechanism (DAM)-based piezoelectric-driven microgripper without using traditional bridge-type mechanism or multi-stages DAM, which realizes parallel grasping and displacement amplification simultaneously in compact configuration and benefits further miniaturization. The structural design of proposed microgripper is given, in which a novel orthogonal DAM is used as the intermediate mechanism. The geometrical nonlinearity analysis of novel orthogonal DAM is conducted, including the finite difference-based analysis, the variance-based global sensitivity analysis and the correlation analysis. Based on the nonlinear analysis results, a static constraint restricting the large deflection geometrical nonlinearity degree is established. An optimal design framework of the proposed microgripper is further formulated, which maximizes the grasping movements with considering the property of piezoelectric stack actuator, the nonlinear geometric constraints, the established static constraints as well as the dynamic constraint. A design example verifies the optimal design framework, which can reduce the negative effect of large deflection nonlinearity on the orthogonal movement transformation without requiring specific experience. Experimental tests are used to verify the parallel grasping and the displacement amplification of microgripper.",

Firstly, considering the shape of a solder joint and its optical reflection property, the IC solder joint is divided into several subregions, which are called shape features. Secondly, the digital features that are used to evaluate the solder quality of the subregions are expressed by the color, area, mass center, and continuous pixels. Thirdly, the logical features are developed according to the color distributions of the solder joint image and the relationships between different subregions and the types of solder joints. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, 137 PCBs with defects were inspected by an AOI system that integrates with the proposed algorithm. Inspection results show that solder joint defects of IC such as surplus solder, lacking solder, no solder, lead lift, lead bend, shift, and bridged and pseudo joints can be identified effectively.",

Firstly, the cost function of mean square error (MSE) is developed based on Cramer-Rao low bound by considering the influence of the noises on motion estimation. Secondly, the motion estimation MSE is minimized to find the gradient optimal filters. In combination with multi-scale pyramid approach, the estimator accuracy of such an algorithm can be further improved. Experimental simulations show that the estimator bias is less than 0.008 pixels for large motion estimation of low SNR scenarios.

Firstly, the kinematic and dynamic equations of the 4-RRR mechanism are established. Secondly, the joint clearance is geometrically described and the contact force models are introduced. After that, the joint clearances are restrained by preloading the passive links of the 4-RRR mechanism, the two-step Bathe integration method is used to solve these equations. Comparisons are made between the mechanisms with and without clearance restrain. Finally, experiments are carried out to verify the proposed method. Both simulation and experimental results show that the joint clearance can be successfully controlled by the redundantly actuated mechanism. The performance of a redundant 4-RRR parallel mechanism with joint clearances is studied.A method is proposed to minimize the effects of clearance based on redundant mechanism.Both simulation and Experiment verified the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.",

        "abstract": "Flexible hinge is a typical flexible element in compliant mechanisms. But in the micro area, the design of flexible Hook hinge is rare. Compared with the traditional gap-type flexure hinges, flexure hinges with curve leaf are more prone to large deformation in functions direction under the load. and through the rational design, overall error of whole body with flexure hinges with curve leaf would be reduced to a minimum. So this article uses the curve leaf as the basic unit to construct a distributed multi-leaves and large-deformation flexible Hooke hinge. In view of the hinge structure is complex and very difficult to get accurate model, the model of flexible hinge Hook is establish by pseudo-rigid method to analysis the deformation of flexible hinge Hook under pure torque load. Theoretical analysis and nonlinear finite element analysis results are very close, proved that the construction of pseudo-rigid body model is correct. The results also show that this new type of distributed multi-leaves and large-deformation flexible Hooke hinge can provide the larger two-dimensional rotating schedule, and center drift of rotation is small. So this flexible Hooke hinge is a new type of large deformation flexible Hook hinge and line with the basic rotation characteristics of Hooke hinge. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.",

This electromagnetic wave possesses the fundamental characters of the OAM-carrying waves, i.e. a spiral phase distribution, yet propagates along the transverse direction. Hence the phase singularity of this wave is in the radiation source itself, which can avoid the wide dark zone derived problems in the long distance transmission. The PSOAM electromagnetic waves with different OAM modes can be easily multiplexed as no divergence exists. Owing to the unique wave beam characteristics, some potential applications in wireless communication and electromagnetic sensing are preliminarily discussed.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the problem formulation and design of compliant microgripper. The microgripper includes a fixed jaw and a movable jaw for engaging opposite surfaces of the article. Actuation of the compliant mechanism drives the movable jaw toward or away from the fixed jaw to close or open the jaws relative to one another. The travel path of the movable jaw is generally at right angles to the gripping surface of the jaw so that the jaws remain parallel to each other as they move toward and away from each other. The automated synthesis of such microgripper is by a structural topology optimization approach. The problem of topology optimization of continuum structures is solved using a multiobjective genetic algorithm coupled with a geometric representation scheme using fat Bezier curve that efficiently defines the variable structural geometry. A graph-theoretic chromosome encoding together with compatible crossover and mutation operators are then applied to form an effective evolutionary optimization procedure. The solution framework is integrated with a non-linear finite element code for large-displacement analyses of the compliant structures, with the resulting optimal designs used to realize various microgripper configurations. © 2012 IEEE.",

The orthogonality of OAM waves, which is well suited for compressed sensing, enables the reconstruction of a sparse scene with limited measurements. A traveling wave circular slot antenna is demonstrated to generate the OAM carrying wave theoretically and experimentally. Using a set of illumination patterns radiated from the designed OAM antennas as the measurement modes, the echo signals versus OAM modes are acquired and the scene is reconstructed based on computational imaging methods. This microwave imaging scheme is verified by a proof-of-principle experiment at a single frequency without mechanical scanning or beam-forming technologies.",

In this approach, a single-tone RF signal is first modulated using a modulator in order to generate two optical carriers, which are further modulated by a linearly chirped signal by another modulator. Square-law detection in a photodiode then generates a dual-chirp signal whose center frequency and time-bandwidth product (TBWP) are fourfold increased. The dual-chirping and the improved TBWP can improve the range resolution of the radar system and help avoid the range measurement error caused by the range-Doppler coupling effect. The generation of bandwidth-quadrupled S-band dual-chirp waveforms is demonstrated experimentally. The processing of the dual-chirp signal is also discussed, in order to show its advantages over single-chirp signals. We believe that the proposed approach is a potential solution for the generation of dual-chirp signals with high center frequency and large bandwidth in modern radar systems.",

The performance of PTS systems is limited by the inherent nonlinearity of external modulators. In this letter, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we analytically characterize the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) by obtaining the exact expressions for the power distribution of the third-order intermodulation products in the PTS system with either a single-arm Mach–Zehnder modulator (MZM) or a push–pull MZM. The relation between the SFDR and the time-stretch factor and several effective ways to improve the SFDR of the PTS system are also investigated. Both simulation and experimental results are given to verify the theoretical model. The presented results can largely simplify the design of PTS systems with desired performance.",

        "abstract": "According to the limitations of the Blade Element-Momentum (BEM) theory, the time-lag effect of the induced velocity field of the wind turbine when operating in unstationary environment was taken into account. Applying the acceleration potential method, the expression of added mass was derived, and a new thrust equation was established to amend the BEM theory. Consequently a transient aerodynamic load prediction model considering the dynamic inflow effect was presented. Adopting the model, simulations of transient load for fast change of wind speed and pitching of a 1.25 MW wind turbine carried out. The simulation results indicate that the presented model can preferably predict the time-lag effect of the induced velocity field, the large overshoots of loads and the subsequent procedure of gradually returning to the equilibrium value.",

The channelized amplification (CA) is based on the mode-locking gain of the fiber ring laser while the frequency of RF signal applied to Mach–Zehnder modulator (MZM) in the fiber laser matching the fundamental or harmonic of the laser cavity mode. The experimental results show that high RF regenerative gain with a maximum 44 dB and high Q factor normally greater than 10 5  can be achieved with this approach of CA. By electrically tuning the fiber delay line incorporated in the ring laser so as to scan the center frequency of the channelized amplifier, spectrum recognition of quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulated electro-magnetic signal with low power density is successfully implemented. The limit of input power and linear operating dynamic range is also measured and discussed.",

The joint clearances are taken into consideration in both kinematic and dynamic analysis of the two mechanisms. In the kinematic analysis, the joint clearance is treated as a mass-less virtual link, and the error transfer equations of these mechanisms are obtained by the first derivation of the constraint equations. In the dynamic analysis, the joint clearance is fully described and the dynamic equations of the two mechanisms are derived using the Newton-Euler method. The dynamic equations are solved by using the two-step Bathe integration method. The results indicate that the 4-RRR mechanism shows better performances in both kinematics and dynamics when compared with the 3-RRR mechanism. The redundant and regular planar 3DOF mechanisms with joint clearances are compared.Clearances influence the kinematics and dynamics of mechanisms significantly.The redundant mechanism shows better performance than the non-redundant one.",

This paper presents a systematic method for generating ultra-small droplets based on a controllable meniscus break-up procedure. The method utilizes two nozzles that are connected to a computer-controlled syringe through a three-way junction. A syringe is used to extrude the liquid from both orifices until they are connected by a liquid meniscus. Next, draining the liquid out of the meniscus and back into the nozzle will cause the meniscus to thin, which will ultimately result in its break-up and the formation of one small droplet. Both experimental and theoretical studies are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. It is shown that droplets with volumes from femtoliters to nanoliters can be generated.",

        "abstract": "The computer micro-vision technique plays a vital role in many existing methods of motion measurement in precision engineering, which its measurement accuracy and speed perform very well. Gradient-based techniques represent a very popular class of approaches to measuring motions. A robust multiscale algorithm of hierarchical estimation for gradient-based motion estimation is proposed in this paper using a combination of robust statistical method and multiscale technique. In such a multiscale approach of hierarchical estimation, motion at each level of the pyramid is estimated using different gradient filters. The iterative multiscale estimation begins by using 5-tap Central filter, and it is switched to 9-tap Timoner filter after a few iterations. In addition, robust M-estimators are applied at each level of the pyramid in order to overcome the problem of the outliers caused by illumination variations and motion discontinuities in motion estimates. Experimental simulations show that the new algorithm not only provides an improvement in estimator accuracy, but also achieves computational speedups for motion measurement of MEMS image.

        "abstract": "The electromagnetic beam carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) has a twisted phase front, which can induce a rotational Doppler frequency shift when it is illuminating on a spinning object. In this paper, the rotational Doppler effect induced by a radio wave carrying OAM is theoretically analyzed and experimentally verified. Compared with an optical vortex beam, the divergence angle of a radio wave carrying OAM is typically larger than that of an optical vortex beam, which results in the radio OAM-based sensing system with short-range detection distance. In this case, the receiveru0027s location and the deflection of the rotating plane are important factors that affect the radio rotational Doppler effect. For an off-axis receiver or a deflected spinning object, a series of extra Doppler frequency shifts (L ± N)Ω/2π are induced when the spinning object is illuminated by a wave carrying OAM with topological charge L, even for L = 0, the plane wave. Hence, the high order OAM wave should be used to distinguish ...",

        "title": "Wavelet-based interpolation algorithm for topology extraction of compliant mechanisms",
        "abstract": "An important issue is to extract a practicable topology from the solution to the topology optimization design of a compliant mechanism. However, there exist checkerboard patterns in most topology results, which makes topology extraction very difficult. In this investigation, a wavelet-based interpolation algorithm, which directly works with the optimization result to extract a checkerboard-free topology, is proposed. Firstly, auxiliary variables, which are mapped from topology variables, are decomposed by an orthogonal wavelet into approximation and detail coefficients. Secondly, the approximation coefficients are served as reference data for a cubic spline interpolation. The approximation coefficients are reconstructed after the interpolation. In order to evaluate the goodness of the algorithm proposed and determine an optimal resolution level selected in the wavelet decomposition, a method based on a volume constraint of the topology optimization is considered. Numerical simulation is carried out on a compliant force inverting mechanism. Simulation results show that the algorithm proposed is an effective remedy for checkerboard patterns in topology solutions and as a result a desired topology is extracted.",

        "abstract": "Residual vibration suppression of a 3-DOF flexible parallel robot mechanism is implemented in this paper. Considering the direct and inverse piezoelectric effect of PZT (lead zirconium titanate) material, a general motion equation is established which includes an input equation of PZT actuators and an output equation of PZT sensors. A strain and strain rate feedback (SSRF) controller is designed based on the established general motion equation. A numerical simulation is implemented to verify the effectiveness of the SSRF controller in driving the proposed robotic mechanism. The simulation results reveal that the SSRF controller can decrease the elastic vibration displacement of the flexible links rapidly and improve the position accuracy of the moving platform. In the experimental study, one scheme with three passive flexible links is controlled by the SSRF controller at the same time as the performance of the introduced solutions. The experimental results show that the strain and strain rate feedback controller is able to effectively suppress the residual vibration of the 3-DOF flexible parallel robot mechanism. The results of the numerical simulation and experiment are completely consistent.",
