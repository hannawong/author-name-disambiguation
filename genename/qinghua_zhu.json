        "abstract": "Green public procurement (GPP) practices have been recognized as an effective policy tool for sustainable production and consumption. However, GPP practices adoption, especially in developing countries, is still an issue. Seeking to help understand these adoption issues, we develop a conceptual model which hypothesizes moderation effects of GPP knowledge on the relationships between GPP drivers and practices. Using primary data collected from 193 Chinese government officials, we find that regulations, rewards & incentive gains, and stakeholders exert pressure to motivate adoption of GPP practices. Knowledge of GPP regulations, responsibilities and experiences in developed countries is found to be limited. The study also found that voluntary regulations may actually be demotivating GPP practices. This study contributes to further theoretical and practical understanding of GPP practices. The findings can be helpful for policy makers, especially those in developing countries, to establish promotion and diffusion mechanisms for GPP practices as an important sustainable development tool.",

        "abstract": "Increased market internationalization with more and stricter environmental regulations in different countries has caused manufacturers to extend their environmental management practices to cover their supply chain partners. Thus, environmental supply chain management (ESCM) has become an important competitive and environmental strategy for manufacturers to pursue. China, as a global manufacturer, is also facing this balance of economic development with environmental protection. The literature remains unclear on whether internationalization is beneficial or costly when it comes to environmental management practices such as ESCM within China. Further insight into this issue will be useful for organizations in developing and emergent economies to more effectively prepare for internationalizing their operations and markets. Using internationalization drivers that propel the implementation of environmental management practices in the Chinese manufacturing industry, we applied cluster analysis to group a sample of 377 Chinese manufacturers surveyed in 2007 into three clusters: mature internationalization, emergent internationalization, and domestic-focused. Institutional theory within an internationalization context sets the theoretical foundation for evidence that the international environmentally oriented institutional drivers encountered are positively associated with the adoption of ESCM practices by Chinese manufacturers. We also find significant differences in the environmental, economic and operational performance outcomes across the three manufacturer clusters. We conclude that manufacturing organizations experiencing internationalization with a greater extent of adopting ESCM practices tend to perform better.",

        "title": "Investigating public awareness on circular economy in western China: A case of Urumqi Midong",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Facing the challenge of both resources scarcity and environmental pollution, Circular Economy (CE) has been adopted by the Chinese central government as a national development strategy for pursuing sustainable development. Behaviors and lifestyles play a vital role in achieving sustainable development. However, few studies were conducted on investigating consumersu0027 behaviors and lifestyles. Consequently, it is necessary to conduct questionnaire surveys to understand public awareness and performance, as well as related progress, so that the barriers on CE implementation can be identified. Particularly, as a minority administrative region, Xinjiang is facing more challenges on promoting circular economy due to economic, cultural and language barriers. In order to provide more valuable policy implications to other Chinese regions with more minority residents, two questionnaire surveys were carried out in the Midong district of Urumqi city (the capital of Xinjiang), respectively in 2008 and 2013, covering responses from 418 interviewees. The results show that, while residentsu0027 understanding toward sustainable development increased from 10.1% in 2008 to 57.5% in 2013, only 41% of the interviewees knew the concept of circular economy, indicating residentsu0027 limited understanding on CE development. In addition, only 58.5% of the interviewees thought that wastes could be recycled in 2013, and residents were still facing the uncertainty of responsibility and the lack of knowledge for wastes separation. Moreover, around 80% of the respondents supported and recognized the importance of water saving and energy efficiency, and most of them would like to purchase water-saving and energy efficient appliances. With regard to peopleu0027s CE behaviors, more respondents separated wastes in 2013 than in 2008, and waste items that have higher economic values were mostly separated. More than 94% of the respondents reused water and more than 80% of the respondents used energy-saving lamps at home. Less than 54% of the respondents utilized shopping bags for their shopping. Policy implications suggest that local governmental agencies should 1) introduce CE related knowledge and best practices to the public; 2) establish CE websites or information platform for public participation; 3) implement CE related policies; 4) provide preferential policies to the green products producers.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the specific role of supply chain capabilities (SCCs) in the implementation of green operations (GO) strategies. More importantly, it examines whether this relationship between SCCs and GO is contingent on corporate environmental proactivity (EP). Theoretical predictions of the conceptual model were tested using hierarchical regression analyses of data obtained from 225 senior logistics/supply chain managers in the global auto sector. To ensure the robustness of our findings, a post-hoc analysis using the partial least squares approach was conducted. Significant positive associations exist between specific SCCs and the adoption of GO strategies. EP positively moderates the external integration capability – green purchasing and the supplier appraisal capability – green manufacturing linkages. However, unexpectedly, EP negatively moderates the effect of internal integration capability on green purchasing. Equally surprising, consistent negative moderation effects are detected for supply chain flexibility on green design, green purchasing, and green manufacturing. This study contributes to the existing resource-based view literature by focusing on the capability – strategy linkage and its specific application to environmental management. The exploration of the moderating effects of EP confirms the important role of organizing context in the effective exploitation and deployment of resources and capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Technological and market cycles pressure organizations to introduce new products. To make room for the new products, product deletion (PD) decisions are inevitable. PD implementation, however, is beyond the reactive elimination of mature or low-profit products. As a competitive and proactive managerial tool, PD requires incorporation of supply chain financial and non-financial attributes to not only benefit organizations, but also maintain important partnerships. To successfully apply strategic PD, consideration of a broader set of decision factors is necessary. To update the traditional view, this paper introduces supply chain and competitive factors to product deletion decision-making (PDDM). Given the complex multi-criteria problem, including both qualitative and quantitative factors and the relative uncertainties and interaction between the factors, a Nested-Fuzzy Inference System with Interactions (NFISI) model as part of a multi-stage, multi-method expert system is introduced to aid the decision-making process. The model is verified using a practical case in a major fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company. The priority of alternative products for deletion is obtained through the application of the developed model considering the newly introduced factors. The results provide initial, albeit idiosyncratic, insights with a discussion of practical implications. It is demonstrated that considering supply chain factors makes a difference in PDDM outcomes. A brief overview of research opportunities is finally presented to guide researchers in contributing to this under-studied subject.",

Using the 2006 survey data on 377 Chinese manufacturers in six major industrial groups in Suzhou, Dalian, and Tianjin cities, we propose and test a relationship between normative, coercive and mimetic international institutional pressures and the adoption of three important proactive corporate environmental practices (routines) - ISO 14001, TQEM (total quality environmental management), and eco-auditing - by Chinese firms. We also argue for and find that this relationship is greater than that arising from corresponding normative, coercive, and mimetic internal domestic pressures. Finally, we find a positive effect of international parenting or partnering on the adoption of proactive corporate environmental practices and routines. These findings have important implications as Chinese organizations continue to go global and international organizations seek global product supply chain partners within China. © 2012 .",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Sustainable consumption (SC) is key for sustainable development, but only limited studies have examined how to motivate SC among consumers in developing countries. Younger consumers tend to more sustainable consumption while whether they really understand the SC concept is not clear. To explore the role of SC understanding for motivating SC behaviors, this paper develops a concept model with hypotheses to propose that SC understanding mediates relationships between influencing factors and SC behaviors. Based on 623 usable questionnaires collected from junior high schools and senior high schools in three eastern cities of China, five influencing factors for SC behaviors are identified, they are, education, awareness u0026 attitude, social influence, effectiveness of energy saving and emission reduction for sustainable products, and differentiation of sustainable products from regular products. Statistic results through hierarchical regression analysis demonstrate that SC understanding is necessary to motivate SC behaviors with certain influencing factors. Chinese adolescents can understand the SC concept through education and then purchase sustainable products. Only if sustainable products can show benefits of energy saving and emission reduction, Chinese adolescent would like to use these products. Environmental awareness and attitude can bring environmental treatment and disposal of products, but SC understanding is necessary. This paper contributes to extend the TPB to develop a conceptual model including education as one influencing factor for SC behaviors. It also develops three factors for SC behaviors from the product life cycle perspective. Besides, it also contributes to extend the previous studies about motivation of SC consumption to adolescents in an emergent economy of China to examine the role of SC understanding. Statistic results reveal the low implementation level of SC behaviors, and the government should highlight sustainable education to improve sustainable awareness and SC understanding. It is also shown that adolescents would like to purchase sustainable products if environmental performance of such products can be demonstrated, which also provide insights for enterprises to achieve win-win opportunities.",

        "abstract": "Green supply chain management (GSCM) has become an emergent ecological modernization tool amongst Chinese manufacturers to balance environmental performance with productivity and business performance gains. Ecological modernization at the society level is influenced by restructuring policies and regulations. Some of these policies and regulations in China are focusing on enhancing energy savings and pollution reduction (ESPR). Based on a survey of 376 responses, we investigate whether different Chinese manufacturer clusters varying in their extent of implementing GSCM exist from this ecological modernization perspective. We also examine if Chinese manufacturers’ awareness of domestic and international environmental ESPR-oriented compliance is related to GSCM implementation and whether a mediating effect of regulatory pressure plays a significant role. The results highlight the varying pace of Chinese manufacturers to ecologically modernize with GSCM practices and the significance of regulatory pressure to diffuse the practices adoption by Chinese manufacturing industry. Implications of this research go beyond the manufacturers investigated in this study where similar occurrence of these relationships may exist in other regions.",

        "title": "Evaluating barriers to green supply chain redesign and implementation of related practices in the West Africa cashew industry",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Cashew consumption has been increasing globally, but environmental issues through the whole cashew supply chain, from production, processing and transportation, have been raised. Thus, green supply chain redesign has been put forward but implementation of related practices faces many barriers. Using the case of the Africa cashew industry, which produces over half of global raw cashew nuts but only process less than 10% to kernel, this paper systematically identifies these barriers considering stakeholders through the whole cashew supply chain. Based on evaluation of four experts, results by grey Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory reveal that successful green supply chain redesign implementation needs two elementary efforts by kernel distributors. One is increased collaboration with multi-tier suppliers (producer organizations and processors) and the other is to get strategic support from industry bodies, non-governmental organizations and development agencies. Additionally, in the short-term, kernel distributors need to overcome three key operational barriers, lack of internal top-level management commitment, lack of integrated management information and traceability systems, and uncertainty of economic benefits. Furthermore, barriers such as difficulties to assess environmental sustainability performance and lack of consumer demand for green cashew should be addressed in the long-term. This study contributes to identify barriers to the successful implementation of green supply chain redesign from perspectives of both the focal enterprise and the whole supply chain. A robust multi-criteria decision making method further reveals the most important and fundamental barriers which can offer decision support for kernel distributors and policymakers in the cashew industry.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Household e-wastes have been increasingly generated, which has brought environmental burdens in most countries, especially in rapidly developing countries. With the unprecedented industrialization and urbanization, China has faced more serious problems concerning household e-wastes. Moreover, informal e-waste collecting has brought environmental burden due to improper treatment of invaluable parts of e-wastes. Thus, formal e-waste collecting enterprises have emerged with support from the government. But they are still difficult to survive. This paper contributes to systematically identify barriers for formal channels of household e-waste collection in China considering different stakeholders such as the government, households, collectors, and treatment plants. Using perspectives from experts in e-wastes formal collecting enterprises in Liaoning Province, this paper develops three steps based on the method of grey-based Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to reveal the most serious barriers in both the short and the long term by examining causal and effect relationships among these barriers. The results show that households’ habits of selling e-wastes to peddlers is one key barrier, which should be carefully considered in the short term. Support from the government such as providing subsidy and tax reduction for formal collecting enterprises is elemental.",

        "abstract": "Accounting for 7% of energy consumption from all industrial sectors and 15% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in China in 2009, the cement industry should be one of the main sectors to implement low carbon development. However, a detailed study on presenting its GHG emission trajectory and identifying the key driving factors has yet to be done. Under such a circumstance, this paper first presents a GHG emission inventory of the cement industry in China and then identifies the main driving factors that influence changes of GHG emissions in the cement industry by adopting LMDI method. Our results show that the total GHG emission in 2009 was 1095.1 Mt carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), of which 592.8 Mt CO2e was process-related and 502.3 Mt CO2e was energy-related. The major factors responsible for the increase of GHG emissions during 2005-2009 include cement production activity effect and clinker production activity effect, while energy intensity effect played a positive role to offset total GHG emissions. Finally, we present our policy implications and provide possible technical solutions for reducing GHG emissions of the cement industry in China. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Using an empirical study of 128 organizations, 39 in the UK and 89 in China, we investigate and tease out some characteristic observations on ESCM pressures, practices and performance within the automotive industry. We provide a general comparative analysis of ESCM pressures, practices and performance, with a focus on the similarities and differences between these two countries. Using ipsative t-tests analysis, our results show that there are more similarities than differences between ESCM pressures, practices and performance in these two countries. The possibility of variations in market development stages has caused the UK's automotive organizations to experience fewer external pressures and greater internal pressures. Chinese automotive organizations implement generally higher levels of ESCM practices than UK automotive organizations; however, this difference has not resulted in significantly greater performance improvements.",

As the literature grows, finding new directions by critically evaluating the research and identifying future directions becomes important in advancing knowledge for the field. Using organizational theories to help categorize the literature provides opportunities to address both the objectives of understanding where the field currently stands and identifying research opportunities and directions. After providing a background discussion on GSCM, we categorize and review recent GSCM literature under nine broad organizational theories, with a special emphasis on investigation of adoption, diffusion and outcomes of GSCM practices. Within this review framework, we also identify GSCM research questions that are worthy of investigation. Additional organizational theories which are considered valuable for future GSCM research are also identified with a conclusion for this review.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   When managing a global supply chain, one critical challenge encountered by multinational enterprises (MNEs) is the extension of corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices to suppliers in emerging countries. In this study, we use a multi-method approach to explore 1) the nature of suppliers’ CSR heterogeneity based on the various components of CSR in emerging countries, and 2) the choices of MNEs for extending CSR to different types of suppliers in dynamic environments. We begin with a survey of Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) servicing MNEs to examine how these suppliers vary in CSR implementation based on cluster analysis results. To understand the choices made by MNE buyers for extending CSR to their OEM suppliers, we conduct an agent-based simulation study considering the dynamics of a system with multiple agents (i.e., MNE buyers, OEM suppliers, and the government). The cluster analysis results show that CSR practices implemented by Chinese OEMs differ significantly from one another and can be classified into three clusters (i.e.,  Leader ,  Follower,  and  Laggard ). The simulation results provide insights into how the adaption costs (e.g., upgrade cost and cost saved by downgrading) and punitive (inspection with possible penalties) and supportive (subsidies) tactics adopted by the government affect the choices made by MNE buyers for extending CSR practices to suppliers in emerging countries. Moreover, we demonstrate when supportive tactics are more effective than punitive tactics under varying conditions and extend the model to investigate the consequences of switching between these two types of tactics in a sequential simulation.",

We conducted a survey to collect data from four typical manufacturing industrial sectors in China, namely, power generating, chemical/petroleum, electrical/electronic and automobile, and received 171 valid organizational responses for data analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the data. The results are consistent with our prediction that the different manufacturing industry types display different levels of GSCM implementation and outcomes. We specifically found that the electrical/electronic industry has relatively higher levels of GSCM implementation and achieves better performance outcomes than the other three manufacturer types. Implications of the results are discussed and suggestions for further research on the implementation of GSCM are offered.",

        "abstract": "With increasing resource depletion and environmental issues in China, it is both desirable and practical to promote industrial ecology (IE) education. While industrial ecology education in China is still in its infancy, we believe it can be improved through systematic review of specific experiences. We outline and assess the experience with teaching of industrial ecology at the Dalian University of Technology (DUT) in northeastern China. We first provide an overview related to industrial ecology education in China and then present a detailed description of eight teaching modules focused on industrial ecology at DUT: history and evolution of IE, cleaner production, life cycle management, design for environment, integrated waste management, industrial symbiosis and eco-industrial parks, circular economy, and sustainable consumption. Particular attention is given to teaching methodology. All lectures and discussions are in English; written assignments and verbal presentations in English are required, as is a final research paper and extensive use of Chinese and international case studies. Overall pedagogy emphasizes active learning and critical reflection. The grading system relies on individual written assignments, an oral presentation, participation, and a research paper. Challenges encountered include the difficulties for some students due to their limited competency in the English language, facilitating students to shift from passive to active learning, and attracting management students to the course. Postcourse evaluations indicated that the students' understanding of industrial ecology increased. © 2009 by Yale University.",

Molecular biological analysis showed that the full length cDNA was of 1672 bp,with a 1338 bp open reading frame encoding 446 amino acids,and the SQS gene was a single copy gene in Schizochytrium limacinum. Homology analysis showed that Schizochytrium limacinum SQS cDNA had five consensus regions. The SQS cDNA was constructed into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-4T-3 and expressed in E.coli BL21. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analyses showed that the recombinant protein was mainly in the form of inclusion body,of which molecular weight was as expected,and had good immunogenicity.",

        "abstract": "Although large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises (LMSOEs) play an important role in China's economy, only in the past two to three years have these enterprises started to focus on environmental developments such as green purchasing in their business practices. As part of an investigation of this topic, a survey and site visits to 28 LMSOEs were conducted to investigate the potential for green purchasing in China. This paper is both a review of the investigation's findings and an introduction to the elements of green purchasing among Chinese LMSOEs. It first introduces the importance of green purchasing for LMSOEs as it pertains to the marketing of their products. Then it discusses key elements of green purchasing for LMSOEs, which include: (1) the organisational framework, (2) a model for supplier selection, (3) key factors and criteria affecting supplier selection and (4) the establishment of beneficial buyer-supplier relationships. Last, it analyses the challenges of LMSOEs for green purchasing in the context of the rapidly evolving Chinese economy and summarises the progress that has been made. The paper concludes that Chinese LMSOEs and foreign investment enterprises in China can benefit from green purchasing co-operation if they establish close long-term supplier-buyer relationships.",

        "abstract": "As a major part of corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices, Chinese companies have emphasized employee satisfaction to achieve sustainable development. However, it is still unclear how employees perceive organizational CSR efforts and whether such perceptions bring employee satisfaction and loyalty. To answer these timely inquires, we developed and empirically tested a theoretical framework modeling employee satisfaction as both mediator and moderator on the relationship between employee perception of organizational CSR efforts and their loyalty to enterprises. Based on 438 usable questionnaires collected from four typical companies, we found that solely providing money-related welfare and improving the working environment can be detrimental to employee loyalty, but by increasing employee satisfaction of personal treatment, companies can mitigate such a side-effect. Employee satisfaction of personal treatment and general company effort are necessary to enhance their affective commitment. ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.",

This reality requires China to adopt an integrated management approach to resolve the conflict between industrial development and environmental protection, and the concept of circular economy (CE) serves this purpose. In this paper, we examine if different types of manufacturing enterprises on environmental-oriented supply chain cooperation (ESCC) exist. We also determine if the Chinese manufacturer types varying in ESCC differ in their implementation of the CE practices towards achieving the CE-targeted goals on improving both environmental and economic performance. Our cluster analytic results with multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) among the four identified types of Chinese manufacturers varying in environmental-oriented supply chain cooperation highlight the importance to intensify the cooperation with upstream and downstream supply chain partners for a CE initiative to succeed.",

        "abstract": "In recent years,the human is facing an increasingly serious issue of lack of resources.To promote the rational exploiting and use of resources,the paper proposed a new theory,namely eco-labor theory of value(Eco-LTV) in order to correctly and comprehensively understand the value of resource product.The theory says that in addition to the human labor,the value of resource product should also include the natural work,or called natural labor.The energy accounting method is chosen as an appropriate method to calculate the real value of natural work,and it provides an effective measure that makes the human labor and resource labor measurable and comparable.A case study of a highway construction is performed to calculate the human labor cost and natural labor cost of the construction.The results show that the new theory and accounting method can support the decision-making in technology choosing,material choosing and some other areas towards sustainable development.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To quantitatively evaluate ultrastructural changes and the relation to urodynamic parameters of neurogenic acontractile detrusor(NACD) in children. Methods: According to the results of urodynamic examination,17 children with NACD(10 boys,7 girls,mean age 8.5 years,SD2.7,as NACD group) and 10 children with upper urinary tract diseases but having normal lower urinary tract function(6 boys,4 girls,mean age 7.3 years,SD1.7,as control group) were included in this study. Detrusor biopsies were obtained from patients with NBD and controls for ultrastructural study through endoscopic or open surgical procedures,and subsequent specimens were processed for transmission electron microscopy using standard methods. Results: The post void residual and disrupted degenerative muscle cells(DDMC) per 500 cells of NACD groups were significantly higher than those of control group,bladder compliance(BC) lower than those of control. There were no significant differences in maximum flow rate and maximum cystometric capacity between NACD group and control group. The incidence of normal compact fascicles of NACD group was 11%(2/17),and was significantly lower than that of control group(90%,9/10). However,that of loose fascicles was 65%(11/17),and was significantly higher than that of control group. The major factors affecting BC included muscle fascicles and DDMC by multiple linear regression. And the influencing extent of muscle fascicles was more than DDMC. Conclusion: There are distinct ultrastructural changes in the detrusor biopsies of the children with neurogenic acontractile detrusor,and they are well used to predict urodynamic dysfunction. Detrusor biopsies may be useful as an adjunct in the diagnosis of the children with neurogenic acontractile detrusor.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Corporate social responsibility (CSR) in supply chain management (SCM) has gained an increasing research attention in recent years. Extant studies have discussed stakeholder interests, performance evaluation, ethical sourcing, and sustainable production. The purpose of this paper is to develop a systematic study quantitatively depicting the knowledge structure and the intellectual progress of CSR for SCM. This research adopts bibliometric analysis in conjunction with network analysis to systematically evaluate the CSR-related publications for SCM. The analysis involves 628 peer-reviewed articles identified with careful selection of influential work. Data analytic techniques including citation analysis, co-citation analysis and co-word analysis are used. Key findings for researchers include (1) an analytical discussion of the five sub-fields that constitute the intellectual structure of CSR for SCM; (2) Theoretical and conceptual research significantly dominate in this field; (3) The topics of sustainable development and economic and social effects are more frequently discussed among scholars; (4) Key research gaps include lacking of practical and normative modeling research, and considering from the supplier perspectives in emerging economies. The findings suggest that future research would emerge a greater depth of practical and modeling analysis to enrich the theories.",

        "abstract": "Environmental pollution and resource depletion pressures have caused manufacturers in developing countries such as China to improve environmental performance. In response, thoughtful and innovative enterprises have implemented emergent environmental management practices including elements of green supply chain management (GSCM). Diffusion of these practices to enterprises occurs from internal and external influences. Given that GSCM practices can be viewed as management innovations, this article applies the seminal Bass model to analyse GSCM practices diffusion. Specifically, the Bass model for diffusion is used to evaluate data for ISO 14001 certification and eco-labelling practices in China. In this investigation, we evaluate the relative roles of innovation and imitation drivers for diffusion of these GSCM practices. We find that even though innovation is not insignificant, imitation plays a much larger role for these specific GSCM practices diffusions amongst Chinese enterprises. Managerial and policy implications of these and other findings are also discussed. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Stakeholder pressure, from actors including regulators, consumers and non-governmental organizations, has made organizations more responsible for poor environmental performance of their direct and sub-suppliers. Thus, green multi-tier supplier management (GMSM) has become an emergent topic. Yet it is still unclear how to enable GMSM practices effectively, i.e. how to enable sub-suppliersu0027 environmental performance improvement. To help address the gap in the literature, this paper aims to identify enablers for sub-suppliersu0027 environmental performance improvement, and it further applies a Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL)-based case study method to evaluate inter-relationships among these enablers and improve the focal companyu0027s GMSM practices, by using action research (AR) method principles. The data analysis and discussion with a follow-up evaluation after two years provided insights for the successful implementation of GMSM. The results show that top managers’ support from the organizations is a prominent and necessary foundational enabler. An interesting observation is that close proximity of supply chain members is regarded as a very prominent enabler. Evaluation and feedback on these enablers two years later found that the enabler mapping was beneficial, allowing them to address the most influential enablers, and thus the GMSM practices of the focal company has been highly improved. This paper concludes with directions for further research.",

As the rotor free wake equation possesses the characteristics of non-linearity, its solutions are susceptible to numerical instability. The modified equation of a different format is derived to investigate the accuracy and the numerical stability of the modified PC2B algorithm, and the stability and calculation efficiency of the algorithm are verified by a numerical experiment. Based on the algorithm, the rotor aerodynamic characteristics are first calculated and the validation of the rotor free wake model is performed with the experimental data for hover and ramp up in collective pitch. Secondly, the rotor unsteady aerodynamic characteristics are investigated during the collective pitch maneuver phase. Results demonstrate that the fluctuation of the rotor unsteady aerodynamic characteristics during the collective pitch maneuver phase stems from the transient variation of the rotor free wake geometry.",

        "title": "Motivating low-carbon initiatives among suppliers: The role of risk and opportunity perception",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Regulators increasingly pressure companies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In the case of many large corporations, most emissions originate from supply chain operations. Consequently, firms often pass on external pressures to their suppliers by requesting them to implement low-carbon initiatives. While existing research suggests that external pressures from both regulators and customers are mostly effective in motivating environmental action among suppliers, it remains unexplored how organizational perception of risks and opportunities influences this relationship. The purpose of this paper is to examine empirically how the perception of climate change-related risks and opportunities moderates the influence of external pressures on a supplier’s decision to adopt low-carbon supply chain management (LCSCM) practices. The sample consists of 877 companies from 37 countries that supply to large multinational enterprises. Secondary data is sourced from CDP’s Supply Chain Program and other databases and statistically analyzed using binary logistic regression models. The results show that a supplier’s decision to implement LCSCM practices is mainly determined by customer requests to reduce GHG emissions and the stringency and effectiveness of climate change policies in its home country. Contrary to theoretical predictions, little empirical evidence is provided for a moderating influence of perceived climate-related risks and opportunities. However, in most cases a company’s perception of both risks and opportunities is directly and positively related to LCSCM. Firm size is also found to be influential, while profitability, an industry’s GHG intensity, a country’s economic development and the private sector’s responsiveness to environmental issues do not significantly affect suppliers’ behavior.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effects of yak bone powder on the bone density, bone calcium content and bone calcium apparent absorption rate in rats. Method: Seventy female SD rats were divided into 7 groups. The low calcium control group was fed with 1180 mg Ca/kg in diet. The three experiment groups were fed three dosage of yak bone powder, corresponding to 5, 10, 20, times of the recommended dosage for human body. Ca contents in the three groups are respectively 1437, 1852, 2778 mg/kg of diet. For another three groups, Ca contents in the diet were the same as the experiment groups, but using calcium carbonate as control. At the end of the fourth week, calcium metabolic experiment was performed for 3 days. Food intake was recorded and feces were collected for calcium contents assay. Calcium apparent absorption rate was also assayed. Twelve weeks later, bone calcium, bone density, bone length and femur bone weight were all assayed. Result: The results showed that yak bone powder shows higher calcium apparent absorption rate than calcium carbonate. Bones Ca content and bone density in yak bone powder groups are significant and higher than those in the low Ca control group. However, there are no significant differences between yak bone powder group and calcium carbonate group. Conclusion: Yak bone powder may improve bone density and have a higher apparent absorption rate than calcium carbonate.",

        "abstract": "Cities consumed 84% of commercial energy in China, which indicates cities should be the main areas for GHG emissions reduction. Our case study of Shenyang in this paper shows how a clear inventory analysis on GHG emissions at city level can help to identify the major industries and societal sectors for reduction efforts so as to facilitate low-carbon policy-making. The results showed total carbon emission in 2007 was 57Mt CO2 equivalents (CO2e), of which 41Mt CO2e was in-boundary emissions and 16Mt CO2e was out-of-boundary emissions. The energy sector was dominant in the emission inventory, accounting for 93.1% of total emissions. Within energy sector, emissions from energy production industry, manufacturing and construction industry accounted for 88.4% of this sector. Our analysis showed that comparing with geographical boundary, setting system boundary based on single process standard could provide better information to decision makers for carbon emission reduction. After attributing electricity and heating consumption to final users, the resident and commercial sector became the largest emitter, accounting for 28.5% of total emissions. Spatial analysis of emissions showed that industrial districts such as Shenbei and Tiexi had the large potential to reduce their carbon emissions. Implications of results are finally discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Remanufactured products have the significantly low environmental impact through their life cycles, but consumers’ acceptance of remanufactured products is low and uncertain. To promote the use of remanufactured products, the governments in developing countries such as China have provided subsides for remanufacturers. However, how to understand consumers’ preferences and effectively use the government subsidy is still difficult for remanufacturers. This paper develops a decision-making model considering both consumers’ preference for remanufactured products and effect of the government subsidy. Using the price elasticity of demand (PED) of remanufactured products as an indicator to differentiate consumers’ environmental preference, it examines a joint decision problem for price determination of a remanufactured product and share of the subsidy between the remanufacturer and consumers. It is found that the optimal price and the subsidy-sharing percentage are inversely proportional to the weighted-sum of the price elasticity of demand (PED). Based on data from a leading remanufacturer in China, this study finds that if a remanufacturer shares a percentage of the subsidy with consumers, it can get more profit due to the increased market. In order to balance the trade-off of price and share of the subsidy effectively, the sharing percentage of the subsidy and the optimal price of remanufactured products should follow the certain rules, and the sharing percentage of the subsidy relies on the proportion of green consumers. In addition, it is necessary for remanufacturers to have a complete understanding of consumers’ environmental preference and its trends.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Extending corporate social responsibility (CSR) to manage global supply chains has become strategically important for multinational enterprises (MNEs) to keep long-term relationships with suppliers in emergent countries. However, whether and how suppliers in developing countries respond to pressures from MNEs for CSR practices is lacking related studies. Built on the value of formal control through contracts and monitoring for diffusing CSR practices, this study further argues that evolving relational ties, which usually happen in multi-periods, with MNEs at both corporate and individual levels can be helpful or even necessary for suppliers to implement CSR practices from the social capital and guanxi theory perspective. Using survey data collected from 211 suppliers of MNEs in China, which is an emergent country characterized with the worldu0027s largest supplier base servicing MNEs, our hierarchical regression analysis demonstrates that relational ties including reciprocity, cooperation, and interaction at the corporate level have mediation and moderation effects on the formal control-CSR practices implementation link for these suppliers. Furthermore, personal trust is important and even necessary to motivate CSR practices implementation among the Chinese suppliers. Researching CSR from the supplier perspective, this study contributes new theoretical insights for MNEs to cultivate relational ties with their emergent-country suppliers in support of their formal control for CSR practices adoption by the latter.",

        "abstract": "Due to resource scarcity and environmental degradation, a new development concept emphasizing environmental concerns, called the circular economy (CE), has been enacted in legislation in China. This environmental management concept can be implemented at three levels, namely, region, industrial zone, and individual enterprise, with the objective of boosting economic development while lessening environmental and resource challenges. Environmental supply chain cooperation (ESCC), an approach that utilizes customer and supplier cooperation in environmental management, has been initiated among Chinese enterprises. Using survey data collected from 396 Chinese manufacturers, we examine the role of ESCC practices in influencing the relationship between implementing CE practices and the achievement of performance outcomes by testing the moderation and mediation effects of ESCC practices on the CE practice-performance relationship through hierarchical regression analysis. Our data analyses indicate that ESCC practices are useful by moderation and, in some cases, essential by mediation, for Chinese manufacturers seeking to realize the performance targets desired in CE practices. The results highlight the need for Chinese manufacturers to improve supply chain coordination in their implementation of CE. On the policy side, our research findings suggest that ESCC practices are beneficial and, in some cases, necessary for the development of CE in China. © 2011 by Yale University.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The formal control from customers through contracts and monitoring requires companies to implement green supply chain management (GSCM) practices. The informal control of customer relational governance (CRG) in terms of trust and cooperation also plays a role but it is not clear how CRG affects companies in gaining environmental and economic performance through GSCM practices. To explore the role of CRG, this paper develops a conceptual model with four hypotheses to propose moderation and mediation effects of CRG on the relationships between two GSCM practices (green innovation and green purchasing) and environmental/economic performance. Based on 333 questionnaires collected from a typical export-oriented city in China, two CRG factors are identified, they are, relationship u0026 trust, and cooperation u0026 reciprocity. Statistic results through hierarchical regression analysis demonstrate that both moderation and mediation effects exist. CRG partially mediates the effect of GSCM practices on environmental performance. However, relationship u0026 trust can be detrimental for green innovation to bring environmental performance. If companies aim to improve economic performance through green purchasing, they should establish relationship u0026 trust with customers. Meanwhile, cooperation u0026 reciprocity with customers is needed for companies to gain economic performance through green innovation. This paper contributes to extend the previous studies of formal control from customers to examine the role of CRG for GSCM association of performance improvement. Statistic results identify effective governance mechanisms from the perspective of customer relations to achieve environmental and economic performance through GSCM practices.",

Game analysis shows that core-enterprises' costs and benefits to implement green supply chain management as well as subsidies and penalties from governments directly affect the game results; there are three evolutionary stable strategies in three cases. To gain long-term benefits, governments should enact and enforce increasingly strict environmental regulations, and increase relevant subsidies and penalties; core enterprises need to proactively implement environment management, and gain environmental experience, and then further affect upstream and downstream enterprises. That is the way to realize the win-win strategy between governments and core enterprises in the long run.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Social media is increasingly popular among LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) who have a higher risk of depression and dis-identification in China. However, it is unclear whether psychological dependency on social media and social media use behavior have beneficial offline effects. We conducted an online survey of 1391 valid LGBT recruited in China and also interviewed five LGBT Weibo users to better explain some results. We found LGBT with higher levels of depression and dis-identification were more likely to be psychologically dependent on social media. Higher levels of social media dependency were predictive of social media use, and both online social support seeking and offering activities contributed individually as predictor of perceived online social support. Perceived online social support was not negatively related to offline depression and dis-identification, which meant what happens online may stay online. LGBT who has a longer history of using Weibo would be less dependent on social media, perceive less online social support and have better offline psychological wellbeing. The mechanism of how social media use affects offline life of LGBT needs to be further examined. Limitations, future directions and recommendations are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Under circumstances of increasing environmental pressures from markets and regulators, focal companies in supply chains have recognized the importance of greening their supply chain through green supplier development programs. Various studies have started to explore the inter-relationships between green supply chain management and supplier performance. Much of this performance can be achieved only with suppliers' involvement in green supplier development programs. But, the literature focusing on green supplier development programs and supplier involvement propensity is very limited. In addition, formal tools and models for focal companies to evaluate these inter-relationships, especially considering propensity of suppliers' involvement, are even rarer. To help address this gap in the literature, we introduce a grey analytical network process-based (grey ANP-based) model to identify green supplier development programs that will effectively improve suppliers' performance. We further comprehensively evaluate green supplier development programs with explicit consideration of suppliers' involvement propensity levels. A real world example is introduced to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. We end with a discussion of managerial implications and present some directions for further research. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Using appropriate tests for mediation with dichotomous mediators and outcomes, we find that the model holds for a sample of 377 Chinese manufacturers in six major industrial groups in Suzhou, Dalian, and Tianjin. Our findings are consistent with the theory linking internal capabilities to heterogeneous external (in this case, institutional) pressures on organizations for environmentally proactive efforts. Our findings suggest that institutions in developing countries with significant environmental concerns such as China as well as foreign suppliers and partners to firms in these countries should encourage and support ISO 9000 implementations by local firms. These findings may influence other developing nations' adoption of quality and environmental process systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The market fluctuation, usually caused by macro-economic shrinking/boom and ever-changing consumersu0027 preferences/acceptance, brings a high managing challenge for remanufacturers and retailers’ collection efforts and their coordination activities. Besides increasing profit, a market strategy also aims to reduce risk, i.e., profit variations. Thus, apart from the “maximum-profit” marketing strategy, this study tries to explore a risk-averse marketing strategy for a remanufacturer and a retailer in a remanufacturing supply chain. The proposed strategy satisfies the need of reducing risk of shortage/inventory under heavy remanufacturing market fluctuation. By adding the risk-averse factor into objective functions and using a concept of risk tolerance as a risk measurement, this paper investigates the effect of risk attitude for the remanufacturer and the retailer on remanufacturing quantity, expected profit and coordination activities. This paper finds that the proposed risk-averse marketing strategy brings more profit for both the remanufacturers and retailers than that for the “maximum-profit” marketing strategy in a heavier market fluctuation environment. Further, a coordination mechanism with risk attitude is designed and certain conditions are identified for inspiring the remanufacturer and the retailer to participate in supply chain contract coordination, which is of use for remanufacturing practitioners as well as academics. When the remanufacturer and the retailer develop their remanufacturing supply chain contracts in a heavier market fluctuation environment, the proposed strategy succeeds in balancing the expectation of benefits and the risk of market fluctuation. A truck engine remanufacturing case demonstrates that the risk-averse marketing strategy is relatively insensitive to market fluctuation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract:   Corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues in suppliers can affect the reputation of buyers or even result in supply chain disruption. Thus, buyer and supplier firms are urged to comply with CSR codes in a coordinated manner. In other words, multinational buyers are expected to extend CSR practices to their suppliers in emerging countries. This is particularly crucial when suppliersu0027 CSR performance is screened under a regulatory agencyu0027s inspection regime. To this end, this study formulates an analytical model to understand the effects of buying firmsu0027 supportive schemes, i.e., technical assistance programmes, on their partner suppliersu0027 CSR performance. Specifically, we develop a multi-period behavioural model to simulate a system consisting of multiple buyers and suppliers where the government regularly conducts inspections on suppliersu0027 CSR performance. The results from the agent-based simulation analysis shed light on (1) how the dyadic risk preferences of suppliers and buyers affect suppliersu0027 CSR performance; (2) how the gap between the perceived and actual CSR levels in a supplier interacts with the regulatory agencyu0027s tactics to influence suppliersu0027 CSR performance; (3) the extent to which the overall suppliersu0027 CSR performance improvement is attributable to the buyersu0027 technical assistance programmes under the regulatory agencyu0027s inspection regime. This research contributes to the socially responsible supply chain management literature and provides innovative managerial insights for policy makers (e.g., CSR regulators) to promote CSR practices among suppliers.",

To gain long-term benefit, governments should enact increasingly strict environmental regulations, and increase relevant subsidies and punishment; core-enterprises need to proactively implement environment management, and accumulate environmental experience, and then further affect upstream and downstream enterprises.

This workshop will provide an opportunity for participants to exchange research ideas on image collections, including the creation, organization, access and use (COAU) of various image datasets. We expect to discuss various theories, methods, techniques, challenges, and new research directions as related to image's COAU. Especially we would like to explore innovative ideas on image annotation, retrieval, use behavior &personas, processing of different types of images, and visual image metrics. The workshop will allow researchers to communicate with their peers on projects and develop new ideas through presentation and discussion. We hope to establish a community of researchers from related disciplines and explore questions critical to the future development of image's COAU. Participants of this workshop will be invited to submit a full paper to a special issue at The Electronic Library (http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journal/el) on Image Collections.\n\n",

        "abstract": "In recent years,Green Supply Chain Management(GSCM) has become an important strategy which plays a very critical role in achieving and maintaining competitiveness for many manufacturers in developed countries.Most Chinese manufacturers,however,have not yet realized the importance of GSCM due to their low environmental awareness as well as less strict environmental laws and poorer implementation.After China's entry into the WTO and the increasing global green competition,Chinese manufacturers will lose market if they don't actively implement this strategy.Based on a statistics analysis,this paper identifies drivers/pressure which affect manufacturers to implement the GSCM strategy and analyzes their relative importance.The findings can be used as a decision support for relevant government agencies to set up GSCM-related regulations and laws as well as for manufacturers to initiate their GSCM practices.",

Venture capital investments can contribute significantly to the growth of sustainable start-ups. Sustainable venture capital (SVC) research is just emerging. This paper identifies enablers for sustainable venture capital investments in Saudi Arabia taking into account different stakeholders and firm’s tangible and intangible resources. Using perspectives from venture capital experts in Saudi Arabia and the grey-based Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method, this study pinpoints the most critical enablers and investigates their causal and effect interconnections. The methodological process consists of reviewing the SVC literature and consulting the experts to identify the SVC enablers, creating a questionnaire, acquiring the answers from four experts, analyzing the data with grey-based DEMATEL and performing a sensitivity analysis. The government use of international standards, policies and regulations for sustainable investments, the commitment of the venture capitalists to sustainability and their deep understanding of sustainable business models are the most influential enablers. The paper concludes with implications for different actors, limitations and prospective directions for the sustainable venture capital research.",

It could be seen that polysaccharide in cell wall mainly displayed a tiny fiber structure arranged densely in many layers, whereas those located at the surface of cell wall presented loose reticulation. So this method may provide techniques for observing ultrastructure of cell wall and tracing the effect location of adsorbing heavy metals in seaweeds.",

Firstly, indicators are classified by means of the method of factor analysis. Secondly, the weights of the items on their main factors can be computed according to the value of item's load on its main factor. Thirdly, the weights of the items on the goal (first-class indicator) can be computed according to the weights of the items on their main factors and main factor contribution rates to the goal.

        "abstract": "Environmental pressures have caused green supply chain management (GSCM) to emerge as an important corporate environmental strategy for manufacturing enterprises. For manufacturers to fully realise the performance potentials of GSCM, they need to integrate internal GSCM practices emphasising functional coordination with external GSCM practices such as cooperation with suppliers and customers in the implementation. Using coordination theory, this article examines three models used to evaluate the mediation relationships between the external and internal practices of GSCM with respect to environmental, economic, and operational performance. We posit that the strategic stance of manufacturing enterprises in improving their overall performance and competitive position requires a joint coordination of internal and external GSCM practices. Survey data collected from 396 Chinese manufacturing enterprises are used to validate our arguments by testing the mediation effects of two categories of GSCM practices. Our empirical results show support for the mediation effects, which indicates the importance for manufacturers to coordinate between the internal and external aspects of implementing GSCM practices to reap the performance benefits. Coordinating internal and external GSCM practices to seek performance improvements is an important aspect of the manufacturing operations strategy. The dynamics of implementing GSCM practices and the performance contingencies are worthwhile topics to pursue in future research. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

        "abstract": "The increasing resource and environmental pressures have impeded China's efforts to quickly promote its people's quality of life, while protecting its natural environment. Due to lack of resources, technologies and capital, China needs to seek a more inte- grated development strategy. Industrial ecology (IE) may be one solution as it aims at optimizing the use of materials and energy in products, processes, industrial sectors and economies by systemically mimicking natural systems in an industrial setting. The relevant practices and experiences in the developed world have proved that there is a degree of effectiveness and efficiency to development through the appli- cation of IE. It is even more critical to apply the principles of IE in China, where resources are scarce. However, compared with developed nations, China faces dif- ferent environmental, economic and social constraints. Therefore, China has to adopt different approaches to implement the concept of IE. In this paper, we first review the current practices in eco-industrial development in China. Then the advantages and barriers to applying IE in China are analyzed and recommendations are provided.

In the complicated business world, the company is involved in reuse, recycling, and remanufacturing functions using a third party logistics provider which has an impact on the total performance of the firm. In the development of the reverse logistics concept and practice, the selection of providers for the specific function of reverse logistics support becomes more important. After scanning the surplus of literatures, it was concluded that multiple dimensions and attributes must be used in the evaluation and selection of 3PRLP. The attributes play an important role in selecting a third party reverse logistics provider (3PRLP). Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) methodology is adopted in this model, which can be used for identifying and summarizing relationships among specific attributes for selecting the best third party reverse logistics provider among the 'n' 3PRLPs. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Greening the supply chain is increasingly a concern for many business enterprises and a challenge for logistics management in the 21st century. Of particular concern is how to arouse organizational environmental awareness and put environmental activities into practice in the logistics activities of their supply chains. This paper investigates the correlation of two major factors, organizational learning and management support, with the extent of adoption of green supply chain management (GSCM) practices in Chinese manufacturing firms, where their inbound and outbound logistics activities are potential polluters to the environment. Organizational and operational learning was derived from the firm's experience with programs such as total quality management and environmental management systems. Management support included support for GSCM ideas and practices from top and middle-level management and cooperation across organizational functions. We find significant positive relationships between organizational learning mechanisms, organizational support and the adoption of GSCM practices, after controlling for a number of other influences including regulations, marketing, supplier, cost pressures, industry levels of the relevant practice and organizational size. Implications of our findings on logistics management are discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

This paper conducts a study of modeling multicluster tools and analysis of avoiding deadlock. After presenting the structural characteristics of multicluster tools, a resource-oriented Petri net(ROPN) model is developed for the architecture of multicluster tools. Then, by introducing colored tokens and controlled transitions into the model, wafer fabrication processes in multicluster tools can be well described. This model is compact and can describe not only the steady state process but also the initial and final transient processes. This model also shows how the production process is transferred from an initial state to the steady state. With this model, dynamical behavior, including liveness, is analyzed. Based on the analysis, a deadlock avoidance policy is proposed. It is shown that the system is deadlock-free if the control policy is applied. Thus, this model is helpful to schedule a multicluster tool system.",

This paper develops a conceptual model which proposes that cooperation with construction stakeholders and customers is a mediator, necessary for apartment developers to realize environmental, economic and even competitive performance improvement through sustainable design practices. The paper examines the current practice situations of sustainable design, cooperation with construction stakeholders and customers as well as related performance improvement among Chinese apartment developers based on 92 questionnaires conducted by the authors. The mediation effects are further analysed through hierarchical regression analysis. Statistical results indicate that sustainable design should be further promoted by the Chinese governments and implemented by Chinese apartment developers. Policy implications are discussed to provide detailed suggestions on improving the cooperation with Chinese apartment developers and their construction stakeholders/customers. Such cooperation can help apartment developers to improve environmental, competitive and economic performance through sustainable design practices. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.",

        "abstract": "With China's increasing pressures on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, Chinese iron and steel industry (ISI) is facing a great challenge. In this paper, we address the energy-related GHG emission trajectories, features, and driving forces in Chinese ISI for 2001-2010. First, energy related GHG inventory for ISI is made for both scope 1 (direct emissions) and scope 2 (including imported electricity emission). Then, the driving forces for such emission changes are explored by utilizing the method of logarithmic mean Divisa index (LMDI) decomposition analysis. Results indicate that Chinese ISI experienced a rapid growth of energy related GHG emission at average annual growth rate of 70milliontons CO2e. Production scale effect is the main driving factor for energy related GHG emission increase in Chinese ISI, while energy intensity effect and emission factor change effect offset the total increase and energy structure has marginal effect. Construction, manufacture of general purpose and special purpose machinery and manufacture of transport equipment sectors are main sectors for embodied emissions, amounting for more than 75% of the total embodied emissions from Chinese ISI. Such research findings propose that a detailed consideration can help make appropriate polices for mitigating ISI's energy-related GHG emission. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Remanufacturing has gained an increasing amount of attention due to its contribution to energy saving and pollution reduction. However, remanufactured products have low customer acceptance because people are concerned about quality and after-sales service. Therefore, existing innovative service modes for regular products are used as the basis in this study to develop two different types of service modes (i.e., extended warranty and free replacement service modes) for remanufactured products. Mathematical models are further developed to evaluate the financial benefits that take into consideration linear and nonlinear customer demands. With a sample of 387 customers of remanufactured heavy truck engines, if and how these two new service modes can provide financial gains to a typical leading remanufacturer will be examined in this paper. The empirical analysis results show that customers prefer to buy remanufactured products at a higher price if the new service modes are implemented. However, the profit of remanufacturers will be affected by the increased cost and defect products. Hence, it is essential to observe whether there is a balance between increased benefits and costs when determining the length of the extended warranty and the free replacement service. The empirical results indicate that remanufacturers can gain more profit with the free replacement service mode as opposed to the extended warranty service mode. This study provides practical implications by developing two innovative service modes that can be implemented by remanufacturers. The study also theoretically contributes to the field of study with the development of mathematical models to evaluate the financial benefits that take into consideration the different types of customer demands as well as other innovative service modes among remanufacturers and manufacturers.",

However, uncertainties exist through a whole remanufacturing supply chain management (RSCM) system, especially for the supply of used products and the demand of remanufactured products. Such uncertainties bring big challenges for a remanufacturer to manage its supply chains. SINOTRUCK Jinan Fuqiang Power Co., Ltd. (JFP), the only one member of Production Engine Remanufacturers Association (PERA) in Asia, has produced remanufactured engines and parts for more than two decades. This paper describes the JFP and its RSCM system. After summarising experiences of JFP’s remanufacturing practices, the paper analyses challenges and then introduces possible solutions. The results show that JFP should make efforts in three areas which are (1) continuous technology development, (2) improvement of the RSCM system and (3) advertising and the continuous technolog...",

A challenging issue is how to schedule these tools. It is especially difficult to schedule their frequently occurring close-down processes subject to wafer residency constraints. Such processes appear frequently as caused by wafer lot switches and preventive and emergency maintenances. They are dynamical and non-cyclic. We analyze the synchronization conditions for multiple robots to perform concurrent activities. Upon these conditions, for the situations that an optimal schedule can be found in the steady state, a linear program model is proposed to find a feasible and optimal schedule for close-down processes. An example shows the application and efficiency of our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Most of big cities in China have struggled to deal with the issue of Garbage siege. Conversely, garbage like e-wastes can be a City Mine with the high recovery value. As one of the main recovery methods, remanufacturing can make a significant contribution to urban waste governance. However, uncertain supply of e-wastes and low demand of remanufactured products hamper the remanufacturing development. Thus, this paper aims to introduce a new closed-loop supply chain mode. We hypothesize that barriers for such a mode exist for the whole supply chain from the remanufacturers’ management and government support. Focusing on one of the most important components of e-wastes, used cartridges, we first develop a closed-loop remanufacturing supply chain mode and identify barriers along three supply chain stages (collection of used cartridges, remanufacturing, and sales u0026 use of remanufactured cartridges) at both the government and enterprise levels. Then, using evaluation by four experts from two typical remanufacturers, we apply the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory method to analyze the causal relationships among the barriers. Different from some previous studies that reveal collecting of used cartridges is the key difficulty and the government plays the crucial role, our results show that the most important barriers are at the remanufacturing and sales stages while the elemental barriers are remanufacturers. Three of four barriers that need to be urgently dealt with are at the government level, they are, lack of national quality standards for remanufactured printing consumables, lack of a certification system for remanufactured printing consumables, and lack of technical standards for remanufacturing of printing consumables. The one urgent barrier at the enterprise level is reputation damage of remanufacturers by low quality of fake and counterfeit printing consumables. Two elemental barriers are both at the enterprise level, they are, restrictions for use of remanufactured cartridges by original manufacturers of new cartridges, and lack of self-owned intellectual property and innovative technology patents.",

Yet, the corporate and environmental manufacturing issues in developing countries have not been as well investigated. This paper compares drivers and practices of GSCM in one developing country, China, focusing on three typical sectors, the automobile industry, the thermal power plants and the electronic/electrical industry. We sought to determine where the differences occur and which industries are further along. This study indicates that Chinese companies in different industries have differing drivers and practices. We tend to confirm that globalization and China's entry into the world trade organization have helped promote GSCM practices in manufacturing enterprises.",

Whether internationalization has led to improved environmental management practices among Chinese manufacturers is also a related question. Using survey data collected from 377 Chinese manufacturers in four industrial sectors, we find that international institutional pressures positively relate to domestic environmentalism of Chinese manufacturers and their adoption of environmentally-related organizational learning practices. Environmental learning is a viable method for Chinese manufacturers to ease their environmental burdens by replicating environmental management practices of their foreign counterparts. On the policy side, the Chinese government should follow other developed countries efforts to deploy environmental regulations and policies, further motivating environmental awareness and responses in the manufacturing industry. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Due to the ever-increasing quantity of produced and sold automobiles in China, many side effects such as resource depletion, energy shortages and air pollution have emerged. Remanufacturing, as the highest form of the recycling economy, has been promoted by the Chinese government as a major measure to save resources and energy. The remanufactured products, however, get very low market recognition from Chinese consumers. Thus, understanding how to cultivate consumers potential behavior of purchasing remanufactured products is the first step and also very important for developing the remanufacturing industry. This paper, focusing on heavy truck engines due to their short life expectancy and repair frequency, aims to identify the factors influencing remanufactured heavy truck engine (RHTE) potential purchase and analyze the relationship among those factors and potential purchasing behavior. Based on 301 questionnaires from Chinese heavy truck drivers, this paper develops a conceptual model to hypothesize how the influencing factors affect RHTE potential purchasing behavior. Hierarchical regression results show that individual factors (including product knowledge, product trust and environmental values) mediate the relationship between environmental factors (including product attribute and advertisement) and RHTE purchasing intention. Contextual factors (including incentive policy and purchasing convenience) moderate the relationship between RHTE purchasing intention and potential purchasing behavior. Our results indicate that individual factors are essential in cultivating RHTE purchasing intention and environmental factors are helpful for improving individual factors. Contextual factors can motivate the transformation from RHTE purchasing intention to potential purchasing behavior.",

        "abstract": "Due to the trends of larger wafer diameters and smaller lot sizes, cluster tools need to switch from processing one lot of wafers to another frequently. This leads to more transient periods in wafer fabrication, which includes startup and close-down processes. Their efficient scheduling and control problems become more and more important. They become very difficult to solve especially when wafer residency time constraints must be considered. Most previous studies focused on the steady periodic schedule for cluster tools. Little research was on the transient processes of cluster tools despite their increasing importance. In order to optimize a startup transient process, this work develops a Petri net model to describe its behavior for a single-arm cluster tool. Then, based on the model, for the case that the workloads among the steps can be properly balanced, this work proposes a scheduling algorithm to find an optimal and feasible schedule for the startup process. For the other cases schedulable at the steady state, a linear programming model is developed to find an optimal and feasible schedule for the startup process. Finally, illustrative examples are given to show the applications of the proposed method.",

        "title": "An exploratory study of corporate social and environmental responsibility practices among apartment developers in China",
        "abstract": "In China corporate social and environmental responsibility (CSER) has gained increasing attention within industry and government. Evidence exists for significant attempts to promote CSER by the Chinese government. As a critical 'pillar' industrial sector, urban residential apartment development has been a major contributor to China's national gross domestic product. This industry has also profoundly influenced social and environmental issues in the country. Thus, apartment developers in China have felt increased pressures to implement CSER practices. Little research has sought to investigate CSER in this industry, whether in China or globally. The objective of this paper is to empirically investigate, using a surveyed sample of 92 apartment development companies, CSER practices in this industrial sector. In the empirical analysis we find that CSER practices can be grouped into basic, environmentally-related and extended practices. We further compare these groupings of CSER practices among different sizes of apartment developers using multivariate analysis of variance and Scheffe multiple analysis tests. We also apply one-way analysis of variance and t-tests for comparisons of CSER practices among apartment developers from different cities and with different ownership structures. The results show that apartment developers generally implement environmentally-related and extended CSER practices at higher levels. Residential apartment development is occurring in more developed cities, and thus apartment developers in these cities face more pressures for CSER practices. Joint ventures are more likely to implement environmentally-related CSER practices. Research and managerial implications, and future research directions are also presented in this work.",

        "abstract": "Some developed countries have enacted extended producer responsibility regulations that facilitate the diffusion of environmental supply chain cooperation (ESCC) practices among manufacturers. Developing countries, such as China, have adopted similar but generally flexible and voluntary regulations and policies. Using exchange theory with a focus on regulatory aspects as the theoretical lens, this paper develops propositions to examine if awareness of voluntary environmental regulatory policies is different among manufacturers as well as the relationship to ESCC practices adoption. Results from cluster analysis and multivariate analysis of variance for 308 responses identify three categories of Chinese manufacturers with respect to their awareness of environmental regulatory policies. These three categories include savvy, attentive, and nescient manufacturers. It was found that manufacturers characterized with higher environmental regulatory awareness tend to implement ESCC practices more intensively. Hierarchical regression analysis was further used to examine the relationship between awareness of regulatory policies and ESCC practices. Awareness of domestic regulatory policies has positive effects on green purchasing only for savvy manufacturers. Regression results show a nonlinear relationship between awareness of domestic regulatory policies and customer cooperation with environmental concerns, from slightly positive for nescient manufacturers and slightly negative for attentive manufacturers to significantly positive for savvy manufacturers.",

Under a retailer collection mode, this paper extends the existing studies on a revenue-sharing mechanism for a forward supply chain to examine how to coordinate a RSC between a remanufacturer and a retailer by developing a mathematical model. This model considers two types of uncertainties, they are, the stochastic remanufacturability rate from the supply side of used products and the random demand occurring in remarketing of remanufactured products. This study fills the research gap on RSC coordination under the multi-uncertainty environment. Moreover, it introduces an iterative algorithm (the Newton–Raphson Method) to deal with difficulty in solving the implicit function of the payment to consumers under the non-uniform demand distribution by finding the approximate value. The research results show that a revenue-sharing contract for a RSC with multi-uncertainties can increase profit for the whole RSC as well as the remanufacturer and the retailer by eliminating double marginalization. Besides, the government subsidy to the remanufacturer can motivate the retailer to collect more used products under a revenue-sharing case since the retailer can share benefits of the whole RSC. A case study of remanufactured truck engines demonstrates benefits of the proposed revenue-sharing mechanism and the profit increase for the whole RSC with the government subsidy.",

        "abstract": "Employees' proenvironmental behaviors (PEBs) are important to the success of corporate sustainability initiatives. Seeking to understand these behaviors, we tested a model of the determinants of PEBs. Using data from 294 employees in China, we examined the links between organizational commitment to sustainability, managerial transformational leadership on environmental issues, employees' extrinsic and autonomous motivation, and employees' PEBs. Our results generally support our model. Organizational commitment to the environment was associated with increases in employees' autonomous and extrinsic motivation to perform PEBs. Autonomous motivation, but not extrinsic motivation, was positively related to PEBs. In addition, organizational environmental commitment was positively related to environmental transformational leadership, which, in turn, was positively related to PEBs. Surprisingly, transformational leadership was not related to autonomous motivation. Overall, these findings suggest that organizational commitment to the environment, transformational leadership, and autonomous motivation are critical in fostering employees' PEBs.",

With the study of coaxial twin-rotor and single rotor autorotation characteristics by wind-tunnel tests, the relationship of the characteristics and the influence of various design variables were determined. The aerodynamic interaction between the rotors of coaxial twin-rotor was analyzed. A comparative analysis of the aerodynamic characteristics of three-blade and two-blade rotors was carried on and the influence of blade number to the steady autorotation was presented.

Aerodynamic coefficients of rotor airfoil equipped with GF are calculated by numerical method. Flight dynamics model of autogyro with gurney flaps was established based on autorotation rotor dynamics modeled,which modeling by blade element theory coupled with dynamic inflow theory. The result shows that GF has a great influence on longitudinal trim characteristics of autogiro. GF increases the amount of longitudinal pitch control and decreases the steady rotary speed of autogyro. GF almost does not influence the stability of autogiro,and meanwhile,GF can also reduce the power consumption,which is in favor of flight performance.",

        "abstract": "Green food consumption can guarantee the life quality of consumers as well as promote green food production. However, green food consumption is not an easy task which needs governmental policies, consumers' environmental value, and convenient channels. This paper aims to examine how to promote green food consumption intention and in the end bring real green food consumption behaviors by using samples of 457 Chinese consumers. Based on the theory of planned behavior, we develop a conceptual model which proposes that internal influencing factors of consumers mediate the relationships between external influencing factors and green food consumption intention while context factors such as purchasing convenience moderate the relationships between green food consumption intention and behaviors. Hierarchical regression results show that promotion/diffusion can bring green food consumption intention but environmental value of consumers is needed. Purchasing convenience can promote green food consumption intention to become real green food consumption behaviors but it is not convenient to buy green food in China yet. Education affects green food consumption intention and family income decides if green food consumption intention can really bring green food consumption behaviors. We conclude that Chinese governments should strengthen supervision of green food production and labeling systems as well as develop more channels to improve environmental value of consumers. With more convenient purchasing channels and increasing incomes of consumers, green food consumption intention can more likely bring green food consumption behaviors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Due to increasing energy scarcity and environmental issues as well as the goal to develop low carbon society, the Chinese government initiated a comprehensive Energy Saving and Emission Reduction (ESER) program for sustainable production and consumption in 2005. Under the ESER program, Chinese manufacturers have struggled to reduce their environmental pollution and energy consumption. To achieve their ESER goals, Chinese manufacturers should cooperate with their suppliers and customers. However, it is not clear how to drive Chinese manufacturers to implement extended supply chain (ESC) practices for ESER goals, and what kinds of barriers exist. By utilizing a total of 299 usable questionnaires, we did descriptive analysis. Statistic results show that Chinese manufacturers implement ESC practices for ESER goals at a low level. Coercive, normative and mimetic drivers are generally weak while internal barriers are relatively higher. We further used hierarchical analysis to examine whether drivers motivate Chinese manufacturers to implement ESC practices for ESER goals, and whether barriers impede ESC practices. Main regression results and implications include: (1) Coercive drivers do not really motivate ESC practices for ESER goals. To promote ESC practices for the ESER goals, the Chinese government should enact stricter regulations and strengthen their enforcement level. (2) Normative drivers motivate Chinese manufacturers to implement sustainable purchasing. With the increasing environmental awareness of Chinese consumers, Chinese manufactures will have higher normative drivers and then be more proactive to implement sustainable purchasing. (3) Mimetic drivers promote both sustainable purchasing and sustainable customer cooperation. By learning from manufacturers in developed countries, especially those operating in China, Chinese manufacturers tend to implement ESC practice for ESER goals. (4) Internal barriers, such as lack of financial gains, resource and capability, are main obstacles for the implementation of sustainable customer cooperation. Thus, how to overcome internal barriers is a key for Chinese manufacturers to effectively and efficiently implement ESC practices for ESER goals.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of social media, many people who live with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) seek social support via Weibo in China. The question arises here as to whether PLWHA perceive higher levels of social support via Weibo than in offline relationships, whether perceived online social support (PSS-ON) is associated with enacted social support, and whether it is effective in predicting better health outcomes. Based on self-reported data from 432 Chinese PLWHA, the authors investigated perceived offline social support (PSS-OFF), PSS-ON, enacted social support, and health outcomes. The empirical results indicate that PSS-ON is significantly associated with employment status, CD4 cell counts, and PSS-OFF. PSS-ON is higher than PSS-OFF for PLWHA, and close Weibo friends are the main source of PSS-ON. Enacted receiving social support and giving social support are relevant, and they contribute as individual predictors of PSS-ON. PSS-ON and PSS-OFF are distinct constructs in predicting the subjective well-being of PLWHA, while PSS-ON is not related to adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and risky sexual behavior in this study. Limitations and future directions are discussed.",

Life cycle energy and CO2 emission of biofuel supply chain are employed as the objective functions, multiple feedstocks, multiple transportation modes, multiple sites for building biofuel plants, multiple technologies for biofuel production, and multiple markets for biofuel distribution are considered, and the amount of feedstocks in agricultural system, transportation capacities, yields of crops, and market demands are considered as uncertainty variables in this study. A bi-objective interval mix integer programming model has been developed for biofuel supply chain design under uncertainties, and the bio-objective interval programming method has been developed to solve this model. An illustrative case of a multiple-feedstock-bioethanol system has been studied by the proposed method, and the results show that the proposed model can help decision-makers/stakeholders plan and design the biofuel supply chain by proposing feasible solutions to them.",

We also argue for and find that that this relationship is greater than that arising from internal domestic pressures. These findings may have important implications as Chinese organizations continue to 'go global' and international organizations who seek suppliers within China.",

        "abstract": "Increasing pressures from a variety of directions have caused the Chinese automobile supply chain managers to consider and initiate implementation of green supply chain management (GSCM) practices to improve both their economic and environmental performance. Expanding on some earlier work investigating general GSCM practices in China, this paper explores the GSCM pressures/drivers (motivators), initiatives and performance of the automotive supply chain using an empirical analysis of 89 automotive enterprises within China. The results show that the Chinese automobile supply chain enterprises have experienced high and increasing regulatory and market pressures and at the same time have strong internal drivers for GSCM practice adoption. However, their GSCM implementation, especially with consideration of external relationships, is poor. Therefore, GSCM implementation has only slightly improved environmental and operational performance, and has not resulted in significant economic performance improvement. In furthering this analysis we investigate one specific organization in this supply chain, the Dalian Diesel Engine Plant, and how this pioneering company has addressed the issues identified by the broader empirical analysis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Green Public Procurement (GPP) is an increasingly debated “demand side” environmental policy instrument. The aim of this paper is to take stock of the related literature, with the twofold aim of developing a conceptual model of the relevant phases of GPP and to identify the related research gaps in detail. The literature analyzed here comprises English language papers, which are focused on GPP during the time period from 2000 to 2016. By means of a systematic literature review and content analysis, we provide both a quantitative and qualitative viewpoint. As our analysis reveals, GPP discussion has mostly focused so far on the specific impacts of GPP implementation, while the discussion on GPP as compared to other environmental policy tools, in terms of efficiency and innovation, is still lagging behind; this is coupled with a limited geographical coverage. Finally, by disaggregating the 17 years period under scrutiny into four sub-periods allows us to outline the changes in research trends over time.",

        "abstract": "In order to investigate the aerodynamic characteristics of auto-rotating rotors equipped with Gurney flaps, a numerical model of airfoils equipped with Gurney flaps is established. The aerodynamic characteristics of airfoil NACA0012 with Gurney flaps of the height of 1% and 2% of chord are calculated respectively. The validity of the model is also provided by the test data. The aerodynamic model of auto-rotating rotors is established based on the blade element theory, with a Pitt-Peters dynamic inflow model to capture the non-uniform induced velocity distribution on the rotor disk. The aerodynamic characteristics of auto-rotating rotors equipped with Gurney flaps with different heights are analyzed. The results show that from 20 m/s to 35 m/s forward flight velocity, the average drag reduction of auto-rotating rotors is up to 26% with the 1% chord height Gurney flap, and the average drag reduction of auto-rotating rotor is up to 17% with the 2% chord height Gurney flap. Thus, the aerodynamic efficiency of the autogiro rotor is improved significantly with Gurney flaps.",

        "abstract": "Industrial parks play a significant role in the production and use of goods and services. The proper management of solid waste is a major challenge for industrial parks due to the large quantity of wastes and the variability of waste characteristics from these types of developments. Therefore, integrated solid waste management has become very crucial to the industrial park managers. Such an approach requires industrial park managers to assess the overall use of resources, and to seek waste reduction, reuse and recycling opportunities both at the individual company level and among different tenant companies. The adoption of this method can bring both economic and environmental benefits. This paper introduces the planning efforts of a real case in China. It first presents the basic information on Tianjin Economic Development Area (TEDA), and then introduces its current practices on solid waste management. The main focus of this paper is to describe how to plan an integrated solid waste management system at TEDA. Benefits and challenges are all identified and analyzed. The experiences and methods from this case study should be applied in other industrial parks so as to improve the overall eco-efficiency of the whole industrial park.",
