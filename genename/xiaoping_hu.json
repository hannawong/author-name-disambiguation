Combining feature-rich multimedia with AmI (dubbed Ambient Multimedia for short) has the potential of changing the way we perceive and interact with our environment. One major difficulty, however, in designing Ambient Multimedia Systems (AMS) comes from the strong constraints imposed on system resources by the AmI application requirements. In this paper, we propose a method for mapping multimedia applications on systems with very limited resources (i.e. memory, computing capability and battery lifetime) by combining adaptive data partitioning with dynamic power management. The potential of the approach is illustrated through a case study of an object tracking application running on a resource-constrained platform.",

By platform, we mean a family of heterogeneous architectures that satisfy a set of architectural constraints imposed to allow re-use of hardware and software components. More precisely, we show how SANs can be used early in the design cycle to identify the best performance/power trade-offs among several application-architecture combinations. Having this information available not only helps avoid lengthy simulations for predicting power and performance figures, but also enables efficient mapping of different applications onto a chosen platform. We illustrate the benefits of our methodology by using the \u201cPicture-in-Picture\u201d video decoder as a driver application.",

        "abstract": "The design of strapdown inertial navigation system (INS) algorithms based on dual quaternions is addressed. Dual quaternion is a most concise and efficient mathematical tool to represent rotation and translation simultaneously, i.e., the general displacement of a rigid body. The principle of strapdown inertial navigation is represented using the tool of dual quaternion. It is shown that the principle can be expressed by three continuous kinematic equations in dual quaternion. These equations take the same form as the attitude quaternion rate equation. Subsequently, one new numerical integration algorithm is structured to solve the three kinematic equations, utilizing the traditional two-speed approach originally developed in attitude integration. The duality between the coning and sculling corrections, raised in the recent literature, can be essentially explained by splitting the new algorithm into the corresponding rotational and translational parts. The superiority of the new algorithm over conventional ones in accuracy is analytically derived. A variety of simulations are carried out to support the analytic results. The numerical results agree well with the analyses. The new algorithm turns out to be a better choice than any conventional algorithm for high-precision navigation systems and high-maneuver applications. Several guidelines in choosing a suitable navigation algorithm are also provided.",

        "abstract": "Successful proliferation of multimedia-enabled devices and advances in very large-scale integration (VLSI) technology has spawned new research efforts in migrating video processing applications onto ever smaller and more inexpensive devices. This article focuses on the technical challenges associated with that migration. Due to limitations in size, battery lifetime, and, ultimately, cost, mapping complex video applications onto resource-constrained systems is a very challenging proposition. To this end, we first consider a technique, region-of-interest (ROI) processing, of defining a window within a video frame and only operating on the data inside that window, ignoring the rest of the frame. By using this lossy technique, the processing requirements can be reduced by roughly 80&percnt; while the error introduced in the quality of the results is roughly 10&percnt;. The other technique is adaptive data partitioning (ADP) combined with a content-based power management algorithm. By distributing video processing among multiple processors and shutting them down when they are not needed, the energy consumed per processor can be reduced by 60&percnt; without sacrificing the performance of the underlying video-based application. Taken together, these novel techniques enable ambient multimedia systems and maintain the needed overall efficiency in video processing.",

This work introduces the idea of processing a portion of a video frame with the intent of achieving high levels of video processing performance while reducing the hardware requirements for that processing considerably. The techniques we propose operate only on a portion of the video frame and optionally adjust that portion's size dynamically to reasonably match the video content. Our results show that this technique can save roughly 75% in both memory and processing cycle requirements and up to 87% in energy consumption while inducing less than 10% error in XY processing of the video frame.",

The understanding of this situation therefore helps analyze reflected images which are often seen in daily life. Then, the authors present necessary and sufficient conditions for a unique solution of plane motion and structure from any number of views.

The conventional approach to measure the resonant frequency is by performing a sweep frequency test and spectrum analysis. The method is time-consuming and inconvenient because of the requirements of many test points, a lot of data storage and off-line analyses. In this paper, we propose two novel measurement methods, the search method and track method, respectively. The former is based on the magnitude-frequency characteristics of the drive mode, utilizing a one-dimensional search technique. The latter is based on the phase-frequency characteristics, applying a feedback control loop. Their performances in precision, noise resistivity and efficiency are analyzed through detailed simulations. A test system is implemented based on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) and experiments are carried out. By comparing with the common approach, feasibility and superiorities of the proposed methods are validated. In particular, significant efficiency improvements are achieved whereby the conventional frequency method consumes nearly 5,000 s to finish a measurement, while only 5 s is needed for the track method and 1 s for the search method.",

        "abstract": "Mode parameter variations induced by temperature change are widely thought as significant causes to bias shift of the micromachined vibratory gyroscope (MVG). However, to date, studies on the mechanism that explains how mode parameters affect the bias shift are rarely published. Focusing on the issue, this paper analyzes theoretically the relation between the bias shift and the mode parameters according to the dynamics and operation principle of the MVG. Then, the detailed and quantitative analyses are made through the simulation. The analyses and simulation results show that the change of sense-mode quality factor is the most notable cause to the bias drift. The total bias shift due to mode parameter variations decreases significantly with increasing the designed sense-mode quality factor, while increases with increasing the designed drive-mode resonant frequency or the designed sense-mode resonant frequency. These conclusions can provide some guidance for structure design and error compensation of the MVG.",

We find that under some condition, the basic difference between them is that the augmented UKF draws sigma set only once within a filtering recursion while the non-augmented UKF has to redraw a new set of sigma points to incorporate the effect of additive process noise. This difference generally favors the augmented UKF. The analyses are supported by a representative example. \u00a92005 AACC.",

Angular rate of gyro fluctuates dramatically with the rising of gyro temperature when gyro starts up. In this paper, it is suggested that temperature compensation model should consider not only the trend term, but also the model error term. According to the analyzed results, a semi-parametric regression model of temperature compensation is designed for a certain kind of MEMS gyro. The solution of the model is studied using the method of penalized lest square. Experimental results show that the temperature compensation method is feasible and effective. The perfect performance with accuracy of better than 0.005 (\u00b0)/s can be achieved and the errors of the presented method are depressed significantly for an order of magnitude than the traditional method of polynomial fit. It is concluded that start-up time of gyro is shortenen when adopting the proposed temperature compensation model.",

        "abstract": "Efficient and robust visual place recognition is of great importance to autonomous mobile robots. Recent work has shown that features learned from convolutional neural networks achieve impressed performance with efficient feature size, where most of them are pooled or aggregated from a convolutional feature map. However, convolutional filters only capture the appearance of their perceptive fields, which lack the considerations on how to combine the multiscale appearance for place recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel method to build a multiscale feature pyramid and present two approaches to use the pyramid to augment the place recognition capability. The first approach fuses the pyramid to obtain a new feature map, which has an awareness of both the local and semi-global appearance, and the second approach learns an attention model from the feature pyramid to weight the spatial grids on the original feature map. Both approaches combine the multiscale features in the pyramid to suppress the confusing local features while tackling the problem in two different ways. Extensive experiments have been conducted on benchmark datasets with varying degrees of appearance and viewpoint variations. The results show that the proposed approaches achieve superior performance over the networks without the multiscale feature fusion and the multiscale attention components. Analyses on the performance of using different feature pyramids are also provided.",

        "abstract": "We have developed an attitude-independent calibration method for a shipboard magnetometer to estimate the absolute strength of the geomagnetic field from a marine vessel. The three-axis magnetometer to be calibrated is fixed on a rigid aluminium boom ahead of the vessel to reduce the magnetic effect of the vessel. Due to the constrained manoeuvres of the vessel, a linear observational equation system for calibration parameter estimation is severely ill-posed. Consequently, if the issue is not mitigated, traditional calibration methods may result in unreliable or unsuccessful solutions. In this paper, the ill-posed problem is solved by using the truncated total least squares (TTLS) technique. This method takes advantage of simultaneously considering errors on both sides of the observation equation. Furthermore, the TTLS method suits strongly ill-posed problems. Simulations and experiments have been performed to assess the performance of the TTLS method and to compare it with the performance of conventional regularization approaches such as the Tikhonov method and truncated single value decomposition. The results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively mitigate the ill-posed problem and is more stable than the compared regularization methods for magnetometer calibration applications. \u00a9 2013 Sinopec Geophysical Research Institute.",

        "abstract": "Alignment of the strapdown inertial navigation system (INS) has strong nonlinearity, even worse when maneuvers, e.g., tumbling techniques, are employed to improve the alignment. There is no general rule to attack the observability of a nonlinear system, so most previous works addressed the observability of the corresponding linearized system by implicitly assuming that the original nonlinear system and the linearized one have identical observability characteristics. Strapdown INS alignment is a nonlinear system that has its own characteristics. Using the inherent properties of strapdown INS, e.g., the attitude evolution on the SO(3) manifold, we start from the basic definition and develop a global and constructive approach to investigate the observability of strapdown INS static and tumbling alignment, highlighting the effects of the attitude maneuver on observability. We prove that strapdown INS alignment, considering the unknown constant sensor biases, will be completely observable if the strapdown INS is rotated successively about two different axes and will be nearly observable for finite known unobservable states (no more than two) if it is rotated about a single axis. Observability from a global perspective provides us with insights into and a clearer picture of the problem, shedding light on previous theoretical results on strapdown INS alignment that were not comprehensive or consistent. The reporting of inconsistencies calls for a review of all linearization-based observability studies in the vast literature. Extensive simulations with constructed ideal observers and an extended Kalman filter are carried out, and the numerical results accord with the analysis. The conclusions can also assist in designing the optimal tumbling strategy and the appropriate state observer in practice to maximize the alignment performance.",

        "abstract": "This note presents a simple approach to the observability analysis of the rotation estimation using line-based dynamic vision and inertial sensors. The problem was originally raised and formulated in Rehbinder, and Ghosh [2003. Pose estimation using line-based dynamic vision and inertial sensors. IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 48(2), 186-199.] where the unobservable subgroup was derived using complex matrix manipulations. By solving linear quaternion equations and using set operations, we not only successfully obtain the same result but also naturally extend it for the case with linearly dependent lines. The development in this note is more straightforward and gives rise to a clearer picture of the problem.",

        "abstract": "In geomagnetic aided navigation (GAN), the matching suitability of candidate matching areas (CMAs), which is an important influencing factor of matching precision, can be depicted by the geomagnetic features extracted from the geomagnetic map. Firstly, the definitions of thirteen commonly used geomagnetic features are given in detail. Then the quantitative relationship between the geomagnetic features and matching probability is studied from the angles of relativity and monotony. Experimental results show that some features (e.g. fisher information content, standard deviation, accumulated gradient mean, and roughness) own well consistency with matching probability and can be used for selecting suitable-matching areas in practice. The conclusions of this study may afford beneficial lessons for the selection of geomagnetic features and provide useful guidance for matching suitability analysis.",

Specifically, global observability analysis is performed for the nonlinear target system augmented with the unknown parameters to be calibrated.

A method of nonlinear tracking-differentiator is proposed to suppress both noise amplification and time delay introduced by differentiation.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel iterative approach for downward continuation of potential fields. Mathematically speaking, downward continuation can be viewed as a two dimensional deconvolution problem, which is always ill-posed. In this paper, regularization idea is invoked to suppress ill posedness of downward continuation problem, and a gradient-type iterative method is constructed to solve it. Another contribution of this paper is that it proves that spatial discrete downward continuation operator has a structure of Toeplitz. Based on fast Toeplitz matrix and vector computation method, computational cost and memory cost of two dimensional convolution operation is reduced so largely that spatial iterative regularization method can be used to solve downward continuation problem in ordinaire computer. Moreover, the idea may have further effect on other kind of deconvolution problems. The present approach is compared with traditional FFT based downward continuation method, and model tests show that the new approach is more stable and robust than traditional approach.",

A new online-identification algorithm of odometer's scale factor is proposed. From zero velocity update (ZUPT), the velocity errors in inertial navigation system propagate in the Schuler loops, and based the slow-varying property of velocity errors, the algorithm identifies the odometer's scale factor using the changes of velocity during a short time. A tracking differentiator and a fadeout memory LMS algorithm is adopted in the identification to make the algorithm more practicable. The algorithm can track the odometer's scale factor varying with time, and therefore be suitable for navigation case in which a vehicle runs a long time and roads vary a lot. Simulation indicates that this new algorithm can identify the odometer's scale factor fast with small errors, so as to improve the accuracy of navigation.",

At the same time, in order to reduce GPS receiver to rely on the requirements of MIMU, the optimal bandwidth of the MIMU aided GPS receiver was designed. Using simulation and low dynamic vehicle tests, the designed algorithm was validated. The simulation and test results show that anti-jamming performance of MIMU aided GPS receiver has 13 dB improvement. On the dynamic condition, the accuracy of the designed GPS receiver is almost as same as that of commercial GPS receiver.

In this algorithm, matching algorithm of searching for matching point one by one is used to correct the INS cumulative errors. The INS indicated path is updated gradually and this is an iterative process. The matching precision and the robustness of the algorithm are analyzed by simulation. This algorithm is proved to be robust. The results show that ICM can correct the velocity and yaws error in a way and the matching errors of the algorithm can be controlled in one gridding (100 m). \u00a9 2011 IEEE.",

This paper adopts dual quaternion algebra, a most concise and unified mathematical tool, to represent the general displacement of a rigid body and analyze the error characteristics of SDINS. The content of this paper is organized as follows. First of all, the continuous strapdown inertial navigation equations are developed in terms of dual quaternions. Then two error models of SDINS are derived based on quaternion algebra, namely, the additive dual quaternion error (ADQE) model and multiplicative dual quaternion error (MDQE) model. It is shown that the equivalent tilt (ET) error model, which is the attitude error propagation model in conventional SDINS, can be classified into the MDQE model. The error analysis in this paper will help to construct the future filtering algorithms based on dual quaternions, such as for the integrated navigation aided by dynamic vision.",

A geomagnetic aided navigation system is proposed in the paper. Two alternate processes are designed in the system - the match and the filter. In the former part, a contour constraint based correlation method is used to eliminate the initial position error of the system, greatly reducing the computational burden of the whole system. Heading error can be effectively estimated by an iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. In the filter part, a linear Kalman filter is designed to update INS continuously. Position measurements are given by a \"nearest point\" principle and the position error caused by this principle does not accumulate with time, which leads to a nearest point based Kalman filter (NPKF). Geomagnetic anomaly maps are used to test the proposed system, and good performance is observed.",

        "abstract": "Strapdown three-axis magnetometer is widely used to determine the heading angle of a vehicle to which it is attached. Unfortunately, the outputs of three-axis magnetometer are often distorted by various magnetic field sources. Therefore, a calibration procedure must be performed before it is used. This paper presents a new calibration algorithm to determine calibration parameters based on a constrained total least-squares (CTLS) technique. A Newton iteration method is utilized to determine the CTLS solution. Unlike existing calibration algorithms, the proposed algorithm yields efficient estimates without assuming a priori knowledge of the noise distribution. Thus, it is easily implemented and suitable for practical applications. The results of simulations and experiments reveal the superiority of the proposed algorithm to the compared algorithms. \u00a9 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Suitability evaluation using the single feature parameter may lead to misjudgment.

The advantages of this method are no need for good initial values or linearization, easy realization and fast convergence.

The research aims at testing the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-aided Kalman filtering (KF) approaches for land vehicle applications. A back-propagation neural network (BPNN)-aided K*F algorithm and a fuzzy inference-based KF algorithm are presented in order to overcome the time delay of RDSS positioning provided by a double-star positioning system in China. Traditional KF causes biased solutions, and indeed, leads to filter instability easily since the time delay of RDSS positioning, in an active mode, is hard to be modeled and sometimes suffers from RDSS outages. Therefore, a fuzzy inference is used to correct the variance matrix of KE measurement noises adaptively; and a trained BPNN corrects the outputs of the Kalman filter. The algorithms proposed herein have been verified on real SINSIRDSS data. collected in land vehicle tests and are compared with other approaches. The results demonstrate that fuzzy inference-based KF algorithms improve the positioning accuracy to over 40 % better than KF algorithms, and BPNN-aided KF algorithms have the same precision as GPS which is the reference station In dynamic experiments without RDSS outages. The test results with RDSS outages indicate that the fuzzy inference-based KF is feasible but with positioning errors of hundreds of meters, so the BPNN-aided KF is designed to efficiently compensate for RDSS outages and improve system performance.",

        "abstract": "The remarkable polarization vision of animals provides a significant inspiration for robotic navigation and visual enhancement, as polarization pattern provides additional information besides spectral signatures. A novel bio-inspired polarization camera is proposed in this paper, which can realize real-time image-based polarization measurement. The composition of the system is described and the optimal estimation of the polarization state is derived based on the least square algorithm. This paper concentrates particularly on the camera orientation algorithms and visual enhancement methods with it. To estimate the camera's heading angle with the skylight polarization pattern, the sun vector is established as an optimization problem of finding the minimum eigenvector. The solar meridian is also estimated from the degree of polarization pattern by detecting reflectional symmetry axes. The result shows that the measured polarization patterns are very close to the theory. The maximum orientation error of the proposed method based on angle of polarization is about 0.5\u00b0. The average error is 0.012\u00b0 with standard deviation of 0.28\u00b0. Thus, the novel polarization camera could be used as sun compass. When observing scenes in distance, the polarization camera is used to decouple the airlight from the object radiance, which results in much better contrast. More importantly, the polarization information is helpful for scene identification and object detection. The result also shows that the polarization camera can reasonably cope with the semi-reflection problem.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by the excellent navigational behavior of animals, this paper presents a bionic autonomous navigation (bio-navi) system by using a stereo camera and a polarization navigation sensor (POLNS). A topological graph consisting of nodes and edges forms the core of the system, which is similar to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Like most of the SLAM approaches, in the bio-navi system, a node contains pose (position and attitude) and visual template information while an edge represents a constraint between two nodes. The difference is that the POLNS is introduced into the system. The yaw angle obtained from POLNS is attached to a node as a new property and also forms a new edge which restricts the direction of the related node. Besides, an absolute place constraint edge is added to the current node when recognizing a prior known place. To improve the accuracy and robustness of the place recognition, a POLNS-assist loop closure detection method is presented and to correct the pose error of constructed nodes, an improved graph optimization algorithm is derived in detail which is able to make full use of all the constraints. To demonstrate the performance of the system, an outdoor vehicle test has been done, and the results show its effectiveness and feasibility.",

The sensor of measuring the skylight polarization pattern plays a key role in bio-inspired polarization navigation. A novel camera-based bionic polarization navigation sensor is designed and implemented.

For improving the precision of measurement, the errors of sensor are analyzed, and an effective calibration algorithm is proposed in detail. The experiment results show that the measurement accuracy is improved greatly after calibration.

Conventional Global Positioning System-aided inertial navigation systems are able to provide accurate locations. However, they are limited when used in a Global Positioning System-denied environment. In this paper, we present a square root unscented Kalman filter-based approach for navigation by using stereo cameras and an inertial sensor only. The main contribution of this work is the development of a novel measurement model by applying multiple view geometry constraints to the stereo cameras/inertial system. The measurement model does not require the three-dimensional feature position in the state vector of the filter, which substantially reduces the size of the state vector and the computational burden. To incorporate this nonlinear and complex measurement model, a variant of the square root unscented Kalman filter-based algorithm is also proposed. The root of the state covariance is propagated and updated directly in the squar...",

It can be used in many applications, such as navigation, defect detection and object identification. A novel polarization camera composed of four synchronized cameras is proposed, and it can realize real-time polarization measurement. This study particularly concentrates on the geometric calibration of the system. The projection model is analyzed and the multi-camera calibration algorithm is proposed. Firstly, each camera is calibrated separately using planar patterns, and then the geometric calibration algorithms are performed. Due to the geometrical constraint, a global optimization method results in smaller estimation uncertainties. A mean rotation error of 0.025\u00b0 and a mean translation error of 0.26mm are achieved after geometric calibration. The images are rectified to establish a correspondence among cameras and are combined to acquire the polarization measurement. The polarization pattern of the skylight is measured by the system and the results are consistent with the previous studies.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method to extract heading information from the sky light polarization pattern and successfully implements the polarized light compass (PL-compass) under foliage environment with heavy occlusions for the first time. A classifier based on the primal support vector machine is trained to detect the sky area, and the random sample consensus algorithm is used to choose the inliers among the sky area. The sun vector is built upon the valid measurements. The attitude angles (Roll and Pitch) from the inertial navigation system (INS) are used to establish the Zenith direction when the platform tilts during traveling. The results show that the PL-compass can provide accurate heading angle (RMSE = 1.58\u00b0) by seeing only a tiny part of the skylight (minimum of 0.028%) in the dynamic vehicle test. The PL-compass is also integrated with the visual INS based on the indirect extended Kalman filter to improve the navigation accuracy. Each time a new measurement becomes available, the states estimated by the INS are used to check the consistency of the innovation and reject the outliers. The results show that the position errors of the integrated navigation system are greatly reduced with the help of the PL-compass. The estimated trajectory tracks the ground truth very well. The position error is 25.9 m (1.03% of the distance traveled) with heading errors less than 1\u00b0 in the experiment.",

        "abstract": "This paper is dedicated to studying robotic autonomous navigation technologies when the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) is unavailable. To improve the robotic navigation accuracy, we propose an algorithm to fuse information from a single camera, an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and a wheel odometer. At first, we present the inertial navigation equation and the error equation. Then we introduce the odometer-aided visual inertial integrated navigation algorithm based on Federal Kalman Filter. Information from wheel odometer and camera is taken as measurement by two different sub-filters, i.e., KF (Kalman Filter) and UKF (Unscented Kalman filter). KF is used to fuse the IMU/Odometer information while UKF is employed to optimize the motion estimation of carrier by using the output of KF and geometry constraints among different views of camera. We conduct a set of experiments on publicly available dataset. The results show the effectiveness, correctness and robustness of the proposed algorithm in real environment.",

        "abstract": "Place recognition plays an important role in long term navigation in challenging environment and Seq SLAM has achieved quite remarkable results. In this paper, we mainly adopt three strategies to improve the original Seq SLAM algorithm: integrating Seq SLAM with odometry, optimizing sequence searching strategy and multi-scale sequence matching. The improved algorithm is evaluated using the KITTI dataset. The template library is created online using navigation information from the sliding-window visual-inertial odometer. When a place is recognized, the corresponding information is used as observation of the filter. The result shows the superiority of the proposed method in real-time place recognition. The optimized sequence searching strategy performs much better in minor deviations. Meanwhile, the advantages of longer sequence match (higher recall rate) and short sequence match (precise location) are combined together. At last, the navigation errors are greatly reduced by close-loop detection. The overall position error of odometer with Seq SLAM is 20.3m (0.55% of the trajectory), which is much smaller than the navigation errors of the single odometer (32.0m, 0.86%).",

The general way to solve Lie group differential equations is introduced. Investigations reveal that this general Lie group method provides a simpler unified way to solve differential equations involving direction cosine matrix, quaternion and dual quaternion, which are widely used in INS algorithm design. Furthermore, we also present a new INS algorithm based on the Special Euclidean group                         se                     (3) under the guidelines of Lie group method.

Though the                         se                     (3) algorithm has no improvements in accuracy, the general Lie group method used in the design process shows its brevity and uniformity.",

A Gaussian filter is approximation of the Bayesian inference with the Gaussian posterior probability density assumption being valid. There exists a variation of Gaussian filters in the literature that derived themselves from very different backgrounds. From the numerical-integration viewpoint, various versions of Gaussian filters are only distinctive from each other in their specific treatments of approximating the multiple statistical integrations. A common base is provided for the first time to analyze and compare Gaussian filters with respect to accuracy, efficiency and stability factor. This study is expected to facilitate the selection of appropriate Gaussian filters in practice and to help design more efficient filters by employing better numerical integration methods",

This paper has developed a new method to fulfill the above task quickly. By rotating the baseline the initial single difference cycle ambiguity between the two antennas was resolved, the total operation time less than 50 seconds. Further more, through multiple position observation, the cycle slip occurrence was detected with a certain success probability. Large numbers of simulation experiments have been made. And the simulating results show that: the accuracy of 0.045 degree, 0.048 degree for yaw and pitch respectively can be reached with a 2-meter long baseline while the non-difference carrier phase measurements accuracy of twin-star receiver just to be 1 percent cycle. Applying this technique to initial alignment of INS will decrease the operation time greatly. Besides, combined with the Twin-Star passive positioning technology, it leads to a passive and fast direction and position determination system with complete self-determination of our country. Due to its high safety, such a system is of great significance to the artillery position survey of our army. Further more, hybrid navigation of the Twin-Star system and INS has a wide application prospect, so this technology has much research and development potential.",

        "abstract": "As an inertial sensors assembly, the inertial measurement unit (IMU) must be calibrated before being used. This paper proposes a new IMU multi-position calibration algorithm that takes the Earth's rotation rate and gravity as inputs, and calculates calibration parameters based on the two facts that: 1) norm of the accelerometer measurement vector is equal to the magnitude of gravity; 2) the dot product of gyro measurement vector and accelerometer measurement vector is equal to minus dot product of the Earth's rotation rate and gravity. Two theorems about the rank of the involved matrix are given to prove the feasibility of estimation. The algorithm features that no high-precise instruments such as a turntable are in principle necessary. Simulations show feasibility of the proposed calibration algorithm. \u00a9 2008 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",

However, few researches on IMU calibration give the quantificational forms of calibration errors. Based on quaternion, this paper constructs an error model about axes perpendicularity errors and angle control errors of a turntable. Considering measurement errors of gyroscopes and accelerometers in an IMU, we derive the calibration parameters' errors using a typical multi-position calibration method. Finally simulations and calibration tests of a laser gyro strapdown inertial navigation system are performed to verify the calibration error analysis.",

The filter contains all relevant constraints and observations, including double differenced carrier phase and code observations along with MEMS-IMU observations. Benefited from the unified treatment, the priori information is well used during the resolution of double differenced GNSS observables. Hence, the success rate of integer ambiguity resolution as well as attitude determination is improved. A set of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the method, compared with the traditional method. This paper uses RTKLIB[1], an open source platform to provide the results of traditional method. The new filter is proved to be capable of improving the attitude determination accuracy and reliability. Apart from the validation, a proposal for future work is also attached in this paper.",

        "abstract": "The problem of estimating vanishing points for visual scenes under the Manhattan world assumption has been addressed for more than a decade. Surprisingly, the special characteristic of the Manhattan world that lines should be orthogonal or parallel to each other is seldom well utilized. In this paper, we present an algorithm that accurately and efficiently estimates vanishing points and classifies lines by thoroughly taking advantage of this simple fact in the Manhattan world for images grabbed by a camera with a single effective viewpoint (e.g. perspective camera or central catadioptric camera). The algorithm is also extended to estimate the focal length of the camera when it is uncalibrated. The key novelty is to estimate three orthogonal line directions in the camera frame simultaneously instead of estimating vanishing points in the image plane directly. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on four publicly available databases. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the experiments show its superiority in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.",

        "title": "Biologically-inspired visual place recognition with adaptive multiple scales.",
        "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel  adaptive  multi-scale system for performing visual place recognition. Unlike recent previous multi-scale place recognition systems that use manually pre-fixed scales, we present a system that adaptively selects the spatial scales. This approach differs from previous multi-scale methods, where place recognition is performed through a non-optimized distance metric in a fixed and pre-determined scale space. Instead, we learn an optimized distance metric which creates a new recognition space for clustering images with similar features while separating those with different features. Consequently, the method exploits the natural spatial scales present in the operating environment. With these adaptive scales, a hierarchical recognition mechanism with multiple parallel channels is then proposed. Each channel performs place recognition from a coarse match to a fine match. We present specific techniques for training each channel to recognize places at varying spatial scales and for combining the place recognition hypotheses from these parallel channels. We also conduct a systematic series of experiments and parameter studies that determine the effect on performance of using different numbers of combined recognition channels. The results demonstrate that the adaptive multi-scale approach outperforms the previous fixed multi-scale approach and is capable of producing better than state of the art performance compared to existing robotic navigation algorithms. The system complexity is linear in the number of places in the reference static map and can realize the online place recognition in mobile robotics on typical dataset sizes We analyze the results and provide theoretical analysis of the performance improvements. Finally, we discuss interesting insights gained with respect to future work in robotics and neuroscience in this area.",

Three different zero-velocity detectors are assessed by the position accuracy which is calculated through PNS with different choices of detectors and parameters. In order to show the algorithm performance and the influence of zero-velocity detectors on the whole system, the generated pedestrian trajectories fusing the information of MIMU are illustrated. The final results show that a position accuracy of 0.39% in 10 minutes can be achieved and the detectors using the information of gyroscope signals such as SHOE Detector prove to be more reliable to detect the time epochs when MIMU is stationary.

The morphology and exfoliated result of the modified sepiolite were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The dispersion performance of the modified sepiolite in UPR has been investigated by SEM. The flame-retardant UPR composites were prepared by adding a compound flame retardant which contains modified sepiolite fiber, ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and pentaerythritol (PER). The results of limiting oxygen index (LOI) and smoking density rate (SDR) tests indicate that the compound flame retardant have improved the flame retardancy and smoke suppression of UPR greatly.",

        "abstract": "A new approach to estimate the implied risk-neutral probability measure of the underlying assets from option prices is presented. Under incomplete market conditions, Gaussian mixture distribution (GMD) was used to construct the mathematical optimization model of restoring the minimum distance implied risk-neutral probability measure. Furthermore, solving methods and techniques of the optimization model were discussed. The effectiveness of the model was tested using European option data. The results show that the real risk-neutral probability measure can be approximated by the Gaussian mixture distribution of two components; the shape of it is more leptokurtic, being bimodal with a smaller peak at the left tail. This indicates that market participants expect the future with higher concentration. However, expectation for extremely unfavorable price movement (left tail) is higher than that for the extremely favorable price movement (right tail), so traditional assumptions on the underlying asset with lognormal distribution would underestimate potential loss.",

First, the SVR principle for function approximation is introduced, and an SVR method for solving linear operator equations with knowing some values of the right-hand function and without knowing its form is depicted. Then, the principle for solving the IRNPDF based on SVR and the method for constructing cross-kernel functions are proposed. Finally, an empirical example is given to verify the validity of the method. The results show that the proposed method can overcome the shortcomings of the traditional parametric methods, which have strict restrictions on the option exercise price; meanwhile, it requires less data than other non-parametric methods, and it is a promising method for the recover of IRNPDF.

Firstly, the MGARCH models for continuous yields sequence of both mid-price and of bid-ask were constructed. Secondly, normalized residual error of this model was also modeled by implementing copula function to truly reflect the relationship between mid-price and bid-ask. Finally, a concrete example was given to illustrate how to compute La-ES by copula. The results of the present research show that notable lever effects are found both in the continuous yields sequence of mid-price and bid-ask spread. Moreover, signs of the coefficients of lever effect are contrary to each other. Furthermore, a negative dependent relationship between the continuous yields sequence of mid-price and that of bid-ask spread is also discovered while estimating the parameters of copula function, which agrees with the common knowledge in financial field.",

Three U. urealyticum strains including the standard serotype 1 and 5, and a clinically collected strain were used in this study. Strains were first incubated in 96-well culture plates in the presence of methylene blue with decreasing concentrations (from 1 to 0.015625 mg mL(-1) ) for 20 or 60 min, and then submitted to irradiation with a light-emitting diode laser with a power density of 100 mW cm(-2) for 8, 17, 34 or 68 min. Regrowth of the strains was performed soon after irradiation. A significant inactivation effect was observed after PACT. Longer incubation time induced more extensive inactivation of U. urealyticum. No difference in response to PACT was observed between the two biovars of U. urealyticum. It was concluded that PACT had a significant inactivation effect on U. urealyticum, and it might be a promising alternative treatment for resistant U. urealyticum infections.",

        "abstract": "In the past several years, image processing techniques based on Bayesian models have received considerable attention. In our earlier work, we developed a novel Bayesian approach which was primarily aimed at the processing and reconstruction of images in positron emission tomography. In this paper, we describe how the technique has been adopted to process magnetic resonance images in order to reduce noise and artifacts, thereby improving image quality. In this framework, the image is assumed to be a statistical variable whose posterior probability density conditional on the observed image is modeled by the product of the likelihood function of the observed data with a prior density based our prior knowledge. A Gibbs random field incorporating local continuity information and with edge-detection capability is used as the prior model. Based on the formalism of the posterior density, we can compute an estimate of the image using an iterative technique. We have implemented this technique and applied it to phantom and clinical images. Our results indicate that the approach works reasonably well for reducing noise, enhancing edges, and removing ringing artifact.",

        "abstract": "Reports on a new method in which spatially correlated magnetic resonance (MR) or X-ray computed tomography (CT) images are employed as a source of prior information in the Bayesian reconstruction of positron emission tomography (PET) images. This new method incorporates the correlated structural images as anatomic templates which can be used for extracting information about boundaries that separate regions exhibiting different tissue characteristics. In order to avoid the possible introduction of artifacts caused by discrepancies between functional and anatomic boundaries, the authors propose a new method called the \"weighted line site\" method, in which a prior structural image is employed in a modified updating scheme for the boundary variable used in the iterative Bayesian reconstruction. This modified scheme is based on the joint probability of structural and functional boundaries. As to the structural information provided by CT or MR images, only those which have high joint probability with the corresponding PET data are used; whereas other boundary information that is not supported by the PET image is suppressed. The new method has been validated by computer simulation and phantom studies. The results of these validation studies indicate that this new method offers significant improvements in image quality when compared to other reconstruction algorithms, including the filtered backprojection method and the maximum likelihood approach, as well as the Bayesian method without the use of the prior boundary information.",

During the implantation and subsequent brain resection, there may be uncertainty about the exact location of the electrodes with respect to features of brain anatomy such as specific gyral convolutions or lesions. In experiments with a phantom and patients, implanted electrodes were imaged with multiplanar skull radiographs (or CT scans). After retrospective registration with preimplantation MR data, the electrodes were mapped from these studies onto an MR-derived three-dimensional brain model. The resulting multimodality displays showed the relationship of the electrodes to brain anatomy. In one patient the position of each electrode with respect to a metabolic lesion was also displayed by mapping preimplantation PET data onto the same brain model. This new display of electrode positions may strengthen the interpretation of subdural electrical recordings and thereby reduce uncertainty in planning the resection of epileptic tissue.",

Interactive software was written so that the user could \"slice\" through the 3-D computer model and inspect cross-sectional images at any level. A surgery simulation program was written so that surgeons were able to \"rehearse\" craniotomies on 3-D computer models before performing the actual operations. In each case, the qualitative accuracy of the 3-D views was confirmed by intraoperative inspection of the brain surface and by intraoperative electrophysiological mapping, when available.",

We show how to use structural information from such a nonspectroscopic image in order to increase the efficiency of subsequent localized spectroscopic measurements. Specifically, knowledge of the boundaries of N compartments makes it possible to reconstruct compartmental spectra from spectroscopic signals from an entire cross section with N or more different degrees of phase encoding. Experimental studies of a two-compartment phantom show that this method (SLIM) can be used to derive regional hydrogen spectra of a single slice from signals with as few as 2 phase-encoding steps, although Fourier transform chemical-shift imaging requires 64 steps to achieve a result of comparable accuracy. SLIM required only 16 phase-encoding steps to obtain accurate regional single slice spectra in a human limb with three compartments. Spectra of similar quality, obtained by Fourier transform chemical-shift imaging, required 256 to 1024 steps.",

A transcription start site was determined by 5\u2032-rapid amplification of cDNA ends to be 428\u00a0bp\n upstream of the start codon of the oph. The stop codon of cytC was followed by a sequence of inverted repeats that could function as a factor-independent transcription terminator. Strain\n 113P3 had one megaplasmid including the pva operon. Northern blot hybridization for the three genes revealed that mRNA size was approximately 3 to 4\u00a0kb and expression\n was elevated in PVA medium compared to glucose medium.",

The recombinant cytochrome c tagged with hexahistidines was expressed in the periplasm of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) harboring pT-GroE, which was in accordance with the localization of cytochrome c in strain 113P3; the protein was purified to homogeneity. The purified recombinant cytochrome c was a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of 16.5 kDa. The oxidized and reduced forms of the protein showed absorption maxima at 409 nm and at 414, 520 and 550 nm, respectively. The recombinant cytochrome c was fully reduced by polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), coupled with a catalytic amount (1/10 molar concentration) of the recombinant PVA dehydrogenase (PVADH) of the same origin, suggesting that the cytochrome c involved in the pva operon is a physiological primary electron acceptor for PVADH and that PVA dehydrogenation is linked with the respiratory chain in Sphingopyxis sp. strain 113P3.",

Most PVA-degraders are Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Pseudomonads and Sphingomonads, but Gram-positive bacteria also have PVA-degrading abilities. Several examples show symbiotic degradation of PVA by different mechanisms. Penicillium sp. is the only reported eukaryotic degrader. A vinyl alcohol oligomer-utilizing fungus, Geotrichum fermentans WF9101, has also been reported. Lignolytic fungi have displayed non-specific degradation of PVA. Extensive published studies have established a two-step process for the biodegradation of PVA. Some bacteria excrete extracellular PVA oxidase to yield oxidized PVA, which is partly under spontaneous depolymerization and is further metabolized by the second step enzyme (hydrolase). On the other hand, PVA (whole and depolymerized to some extent) must be taken up into the periplasmic space of some Gram-negative bacteria, where PVA is oxidized by PVA dehydrogenase, coupled to a respiratory chain. The complete pva operon was identified in Sphingopyxis sp. 113P3. Anaerobic biodegradability of PVA has also been suggested.",

Faster degradation of 0.5% PVA was performed by the\n periplasmic fraction. The average molecular size of PVA in the culture supernatant or cell-bound PVA was gradually shifted\n higher, suggesting that lower molecular size molecules are degraded faster. Depolymerized products were found in neither the\n culture supernatant nor the cell-bound fraction; however they were recovered from the periplasmic fraction. As extracellular\n or cell-associated PVA oxidase activity was almost undetectable in strain 113P3, degradation of PVA must be performed by periplasmic\n PVA dehydrogenase after uptake into the periplasm. Following the consumption of PVA, a dent appeared on the cell surface on\n day 2 and increased in size and depth for 4 days and was maintained for 8 days. Ultrastructural change on the cell surface\n was only observed in PVA medium, but not in nutrient broth (NB), suggesting that the change is induced by PVA. Fluorescein-4-isothiocyanate-labeled\n PVA was bound more to cells grown in PVA than to cells grown in NB. No binding was found with PVA-grown cells treated with\n formaldehyde.

        "abstract": "More than 100 bacterial strains were isolated from composted polyester films and categorized into two groups, Actinomycetes (four genera) and Bacillus (three genera). Of these isolates, Thermobifida alba strain AHK119 (AB298783) was shown to possess the ability to significantly degrade aliphatic-aromatic copolyester film as well as decreasing the polymer particle sizes when grown at 50 degrees C on LB medium supplemented with polymer particles, yielding terephthalic acid. The esterase gene (est119, 903 bp, encoding a signal peptide and a mature protein of 34 and 266 amino acids, respectively) was cloned from AHK119. The Est119 sequence contains a conserved lipase box (-G-X-S-X-G-) and a catalytic triad (Ser129, His207, and Asp175). Furthermore, Tyr59 and Met130 likely form an oxyanion hole. The recombinant enzyme was purified from cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli Rosetta-gami B (DE3) harboring pQE80L-est119. The enzyme is a monomeric protein of ca. 30 kDa, which is active from 20 degrees C to 75 degrees C (with an optimal range of 45 to 55 degrees C) and in a pH range of 5.5 to 7.0 (with an optimal pH of 6.0). Its preferred substrate among the p-nitrophenyl acyl esters (C2 to C8) is p-nitrophenyl hexanoate (C6), indicating that the enzyme is an esterase rather than a lipase.",

DGGE analysis of microorganisms on the composted film indicated the presence of Bacillus species as main species (approximately 80% of microbial flora) and actinomycetes (approximately 10-20%) as the second major flora. Isolation of Biomax\u00ae-utilizing bacteria was focused on these two genera: Two actinomycetes and one Bacillus species were isolated as pure best degraders from the composted polymer films, which were fragmented into small pieces. All the strains were thermophilic and identified, based on their 16S rDNA analyses. Degradation of polymer films was confirmed by (1) accelerated fragmentation of films in composts, compared with a control (no inoculum) and resultant decrease in molecular weights, (2) growth in a powdered Biomax\u00ae medium, compared with a control without powdered Biomax\u00ae, and (3) production of terephthalate in a powdered Biomax\u00ae medium. In this way, we concluded that these bacteria were useful for degradation of thermostable Biomax\u00ae products. \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.",

Six major strains included in both consortia were purified and identified as Sphingomonads, Pseudomonas sp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Three of them (Sphingobium sp. strain EK-1, Sphingopyxis macrogoltabida strain EY-1, and Pseudomonas sp. strain PE-2) utilized both PEG and polypropylene glycol (PPG) as a sole carbon source. Four PEG-utilizing bacteria had PEG dehydrogenase (PEG-DH) activity, which was induced by PEG. PCR products from DNA of these bacteria generated with primers designed from a PEG-DH gene (AB196775 for S. macrogoltabida strain 103) indicated the presence of a sequence that is the homologous to the PEG-DH gene (99% identity). On the other hand, five PPG-utilizing bacteria had PPG dehydrogenase (PPG-DH) activity, but the activity was constitutive. PCR of a PPG-DH gene was performed using primers designed from a polyvinyl alcohol dehydrogenase (PVA-DH) gene (AB190288 for Sphingomonas sp. strain 113P3) because a PPG-DH gene has not been cloned yet, but both PPG-DH and PVA-DH were active toward PPG and PVA (Mamoto et al. 2006). PCR products of the five strains did not have similarity to each other or to oxidoreductases including PVA-DH.",

However, transmission electron microscopy showed no surface changes in PVA-grown cells and revealed the presence of polymer bodies in the periplasm of PVA-grown cells, which were not observed in LB-grown cells. The presence of polymer bodies was supported by low-vacuum SEM observation of PVA- and LB-grown cells of strain 113P3, and the presence of similar polymer bodies was also found when Sphingopyxis macrogoltabida 103 and S. terrae were grown in polyethylene glycol (PEG). The extraction of PVA and PEG from the periplasmic fraction of cells using a modified Anraku and Heppel method and their analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry strongly suggested that the polymer bodies are composed of PVA and PEG, respectively, in Sphingopyxis sp. 113P3 (PVA degrader) and Sphingopyxis macrogoltabida 103 or S. terrae (PEG degraders). PEG-grown S. macrogoltabida 103 and S. terrae showed higher transport of (14)C-PEG 4000 than LB-grown cells. Recombinant PegB (TonB-dependent receptor-like protein consisting of a barrel structure) interacted with PEG 200, 4000 and 20000, suggesting that the barrel protein in the outer membrane contributes to the transport of PEG into the periplasm.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The use of a low-cost five-band multispectral camera (RedEdge, MicaSense, USA) and a low-altitude airborne platform is investigated for the detection of plant stress caused by yellow rust disease in winter wheat for sustainable agriculture. The research is mainly focused on: (i) determining whether or not healthy and yellow rust infected wheat plants can be discriminated; (ii) selecting spectral band and Spectral Vegetation Index (SVI) with a strong discriminating capability; (iii) developing a low-cost yellow rust monitoring system for use at farmland scales. An experiment was carefully designed by infecting winter wheat with different levels of yellow rust inoculum, where aerial multispectral images under different developmental stages of yellow rust were captured by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle at an altitude of 16\u201324\u202fm with a ground resolution of 1\u20131.5\u202fcm/pixel. An automated yellow rust detection system is developed by learning (via random forest classifier) from labelled UAV aerial multispectral imagery. Experimental results indicate that: (i) good classification performance (with an average Precision, Recall and Accuracy of 89.2%, 89.4% and 89.3%) was achieved by the developed yellow rust monitoring at a diseased stage (45\u202fdays after inoculation); (ii) the top three SVIs for separating healthy and yellow rust infected wheat plants are RVI, NDVI and OSAVI; while the top two spectral bands are NIR and Red. The learnt system was also applied to the whole farmland of interest with a promising monitoring result. It is anticipated that this study by seamlessly integrating low-cost multispectral camera, low-altitude UAV platform and machine learning techniques paves the way for yellow rust monitoring at farmland scales.",

        "abstract": "Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a devastating disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Wheat high-temperature seedling plant (HTSP) resistance to Pst is non-race-specific and durable. WRKY transcription factors have been proven to play important roles in plant defence responses to attacks by several pathogens. However, there is no direct evidence as to whether WRKY transcription factors play a role in HTSP resistance to Pst. We isolated a WRKY gene, named TaWRKY70, from wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 6. The expression level of TaWRKY70 was increased significantly when exposed to high temperatures (HTs) during the initial symptom expression stage of Pst infection. The expression of this gene increased in plants treated with ethylene (ET), salicylic acid (SA) and cold (4\u00b0C) stresses, but decreased in plants treated with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and heat (40\u00b0C) stresses. Silencing of TaWRKY70 led to greater susceptibility to Pst (in terms of the increase in length of uredinial pustules and the decrease in the number of necrotic cells) compared with non-silenced plants when exposed to HT during the initial symptom expression stage of Pst infection, coinciding with expression changes of the ET- and SA-responsive genes TaPIE1 and TaPR1.1. In contrast, the expression level of the jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive gene TaAOS was not affected by TaWRKY70. These results indicate that TaWRKY70 is positively involved in HTSP resistance, during which SA and ET signalling are probably activated.",

Wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 6 (XY 6) has been resistant to stripe rust since its release. In the previous studies, XY 6 was found to have higher-temperature seedling-plant (HTSP) resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms of HTSP resistance were not clear. To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in HTSP resistance, we sequenced 30 cDNA libraries constructed from XY 6 seedlings exposed to several temperature treatments. Compared to the constant normal (15\u00b0C) and higher (20\u00b0C) temperature treatments, 1395 DEGs were identified in seedlings exposed to 20\u00b0C for 24 h (to activate HTSP resistance) and then kept at 15\u00b0C. These DEGs were located on all 21 chromosomes, with 29.2% on A, 41.1% on B and 29.7% on D genomes, by mapping to the Chinese Spring wheat genome. The 1395 DEGs were enriched in ribosome, plant-pathogen interaction and glycerolipid metabolism pathways, and some of them were identified as hub proteins (phosphatase 2C10), resistance protein homologs, WRKY transcription factors and protein kinases. The majority of these genes were up-regulated in HTSP resistance. Based on the differential expression, we found that phosphatase 2C10 and LRR receptor-like serine/threonine protein kinases are particularly interesting as they may be important for HTSP resistance through interacting with different resistance proteins, leading to a hypersensitive response.",

China is one of the largest stripe rust epidemic regions in the world. The pathogen sexual reproduction and migration routes between Tibet and the other regions in China are still unknown. In this study, we obtained 961 Pst isolates from 1,391 wheat leaf samples from Gansu (277), Shaanxi (253), Sichuan (172), and Tibet (259), comprising 13 natural populations, and genotyped them with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The isolates can be divided into two distinct clusters based on DAPC and STRUCTURE analyses. The genetic diversity of Longnan (in Gansu) and Yibin (in Sichuan) populations was the highest and lowest among the 13 populations, respectively. The hypothesis of multilocus linkage disequilibrium was rejected for the populations from Linzhi in the Himalayan, Longnan, Hanzhong, Guangyuan, Mianyang, Liangshan, and Chendu in the south Qinling Mountains at the level of P = 0.01, which indicated significant linkage among markers in these populations. Populations in the other regions had extensive gene exchange (N > 4); little gene exchange was found between Tibet and the other regions (N < 1). The results suggest that the Tibet epidemic region of Pst is highly differentiated from the other epidemic regions in China.",

Identification of pathogen survival hot spots is important for predicting disease onset and subsequent spread to other regions, and such understanding is essential for developing integrated management strategies. We conducted field studies to determine the relationship of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici overwintering potential to winter temperatures in 10 sites in the northwest of China in three growing seasons (2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14). The fungus survived better in wheat cultivars with stronger winter hardiness than in those with weaker winter hardiness. Windowpane analysis suggested that P. striiformis f. sp. tritici winter survival is related to temperatures in the coldest period from mid-December to late January. \u03b2 Regression showed that P. striiformis f. sp. tritici winter survival was negatively related to the number of days with daily average temperature <-2\u00b0C for cultivars with weak winter hardiness and <-4\u00b0C for cultivars with both moderate and strong winter hardiness. Models developed under constant temperature experiments greatly underestimate the P. striiformis f. sp. tritici overwinter potential under field conditions. This underestimation probably results from the possibility that P. striiformis f. sp. tritici in wheat tissues may have increased tolerance to low temperatures because of acclimation to gradual temperature changes under field conditions. The present models can be used to predict quantitative risks of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici overwintering in winter-wheat-growing regions for timely implementation of regional disease management strategies.",

Understanding the survival of Pst during the winter is critical for predicting Pst epidemics in the spring. We used a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) method to quantify Pst CYR32 biomass in infected wheat seedlings under several fluctuating temperature regimes (three average temperatures 0, \u22125 and \u221210 \u00b0C, each with two daily fluctuating amplitudes 8 and 13 \u00b0C). The survival of Pst CYR32 increased with increasing average temperature but also varied greatly with the amplitude \u2013 larger amplitude led to lower survival, particularly at 0 and \u22125 \u00b0C. Nevertheless the survival at both amplitudes was still significantly greater than under the corresponding constant temperatures. There were small, albeit statistically significant, differences between the two cultivars (Xiaoyan 22, low winter-hardiness; Lantian 15, high winter-hardiness) in Pst CYR32 survival. This study indicated potential errors that could result from using daily average temperatures to predict Pst survival during the winter.",

        "abstract": "Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) causes wheat stripe rust, one of most important diseases of wheat worldwide. High-temperature seedling plant (HTSP) resistance of wheat to Pst is one specific type of host resistance, induced by high temperature (HT). Receptor like kinases (RLKs) play key roles in regulating plant development and signalling networks, but there have been no reports on possible roles played by RLKs in wheat HTSP to Pst. In the present study, a leucine rich repeat-RLK (LRR-RLK) gene, TaXa21 with a high homology with rice bacterial blight resistance gene Xa21, was cloned from wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 6 (XY 6). TaXa21 expression was up-regulated by the exposure to HT (20\u00b0C) for 24 hours at 8 days post Pst inoculation, and was induced by ethylene (ET) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Knocking down TaXa21 using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) reduced HTSP resistance to Pst compared with the control plants. In addition, the expression level of TaCAT in the H2O2 pathway was induced and TaACO in the ET signal pathway was reduced in the HT-treated TaXa21-silenced plants. Transient expression of TaXa21 in tobacco leaves confirmed its subcellular localization in plasma membrane, consistent with the prediction from bioinformatics analysis. The transmembrane (TM) and kinase domain of TaXa21 can interact with TaWRKY76 in the nucleus and cell membrane, different from the localization of Xa21 in rice. The interaction between TaWRKY76 and TaWRKY62 (positively involved in the HTSP resistance of XY 6) were observed. Together, these results indicated that TaXa21 is a RLK associated with TaWRKY76 and TaWRKY62, and functions as a positive regulator of wheat HTSP resistance to Pst. Furthermore, the host defense is mediated by the H2O2 and ET signal pathways.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS1), encoding the first enzyme in TPS-TPP pathway of trehalose biosynthesis, play an important role in response to numerous environmental stresses in microorganisms. However, little is known about the role of TPS1 in plant pathogenic microorganisms. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between TPS and cold adaptation of wheat stripe rust pathogen  Puccinia striiformis  f. sp.  tritici  ( Pst ) as well as the role of TPS in pathogenesis. A gene named  PstTPS1  was cloned from cDNA of  Pst  CYR32 isolate, containing the conserved regions of the TPS family. Yeast complementation assay indicated that  PstTPS1  was involved in trehalose-6-phosphate synthase. Transcription profiles results showed that  Pst  responded to temperature stress by dramatically changing its  PstTPS1  mRNA. The decreased growth temperature of  Pst  from 16\u00a0\u00b0C to 5\u00a0\u00b0C or 0\u00a0\u00b0C both led to a rapid increase in  PstTPS1  mRNA, and the increased growth temperature from 5\u00a0\u00b0C to 16\u00a0\u00b0C had the opposite effects. The length of infection hyphae and infection area decreased significantly in  PstTPS1 -silenced plants. This study indicates that  PstTPS1  gene is related to the cold adaptation of  Pst  and is also involved in the pathogenicity of  Pst  by limiting its hyphae expansion.",

It produces darkly pigmented resting structures known as microsclerotia, which are able to survive for up to 14years in soil, and represent one of the defining characteristics of this species. The pigment produced in V. dahliae is dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin, a form of melanin common among fungi and named so for the intermediary of this melanin biosynthetic pathway. In this study, we characterized the function of the V. dahliae Vayg1 gene, whose homologs were involved in melanin biosynthesis in Exophiala dermatitidis (Wayg1) and Aspergillus fumigatus (Aayg1), by deletion and complementation of the gene and co-incubating deletion mutant with wild-type strain. Results showed that melanin production and microsclerotial formation in deletion mutants are inhibited. The Vayg1 deletion mutant also exhibited reduced pathogenicity. These results showed that Vayg1 is necessary for melanin and microsclerotium production, and we may thus hypothesize that the Vayg1 product may catalyze two different precursors, one of which is essential for DHN melanin production and the other one is involved in a signal network for microsclerotial formation in V. dahliae.",

        "abstract": "Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is one of the most important staple foods in many parts of the world including China. In recent years, Verticillium wilt has become a severe threat to potato production in China. During 2015 to 2016, 287 samples of symptomatic potato plants were collected from 15 counties in five provinces from northern China. One hundred and eighty-seven Verticillium-like colonies were isolated from these samples and identified to species based on cultural and morphological characteristics, and multigene phylogeny based on the partial sequences of actin (ACT), elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1\u03b1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD), and tryptophan synthase (TS) genes. A consensus-rooted most parsimonious phylogenetic tree was generated from the data. One hundred and fifteen isolates comprising 61.5% of the total were identified as Verticillium dahliae, and the remaining 38.5% of the isolates were identified as V. nonalfalfae. V. dahliae was widely distributed in Shaanxi (84.1%), Inner Mongolia (76.7%), Gansu (12.8%), and Qinghai (100%, representing a single isolate). V. dahliae was not recovered from the samples in Ningxia. V. nonalfalfae dominated the collections from Gansu (87.2%) and Ningxia (100%) but was also recovered from Shaanxi (15.9%) and Inner Mongolia (23.3%) at lower frequencies. Neither V. albo-atrum nor V. alfalfae was recovered from the sampled areas. The V. nonalfalfae isolates were predominantly isolated from the samples collected from altitudes above 1,800 m, and in contrast, V. dahliae isolates were mainly recovered from fields sampled below 1,800 m. The optimum temperature for the colony growth of V. nonalfalfae was lower (20\u00b0C) than that for V. dahliae (25\u00b0C). Pathogenicity tests demonstrated that V. dahliae and V. nonalfalfae were both pathogens of potato Verticillium wilt, with V. dahliae isolates exhibiting higher virulence than V. nonalfalfae isolates regardless of the collection area of the species. This is the first documentation of V. nonalfalfae infecting S. tuberosum in China and the higher altitudes associated with infections of V. nonalfalfae anywhere in the world.",

        "abstract": "Verticillium wilt caused by  spp., also called potato early dying disease, is one of the most serious soilborne diseases affecting potato production in China. The disease has been expanding into most potato production areas over the past few years. Information on host resistance against Verticillium wilt among the potato cultivars in China is scarce, but it is critical for sustainable management of the disease. This study, therefore, evaluated 30 commercially popular potato cultivars against  strain Vdp83 and  strain Vnp24, two well-characterized strains causing Verticillium wilt of potato in China. Both strains were isolated from diseased potato plants, and they were previously proven to be highly virulent. Ten plants of each cultivar were inoculated with the  strain and incubated on greenhouse benches. Symptoms were rated at weekly intervals, and the relative area under the disease progress curve was calculated. The experiment was repeated once, and nonparametric analysis was used to calculate the relative marginal effects and the corresponding confidence intervals. Five resistant cultivars and four susceptible cultivars identified from the analyses were then challenged with the  strain. Cultivar responses to  were like those exhibited against , except for one cultivar. This study showed that resistance among potato cultivars exists in China against  spp. and that the resistance to  identified in potato is also effective against the other  species that cause Verticillium wilt with a few exceptions. Cultivars identified as resistant to Verticillium wilt can be deployed to manage the disease until the breeding programs develop new cultivars with resistance from the sources identified in this study.",

        "abstract": "Verticillium dahliae infection of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) is a major cause of disease-induced wilting in soil-grown strawberries across the world. To understand what components of the pathogen are affecting disease expression, the presence of the known effector VdAve1 was screened in a sample of Verticillium dahliae isolates. Isolates from strawberry were found to contain VdAve1 and were divided into two major clades, based upon their vegetative compatibility groups (VCG); no UK strawberry isolates contained VdAve1. VC clade was strongly related to their virulence levels. VdAve1-containing isolates pathogenic on strawberry were found in both clades, in contrast to some recently published findings. On strawberry, VdAve1-containing isolates had significantly higher virulence during early infection, which diminished in significance as the infection progressed. Transformation of a virulent non-VdAve1 containing isolate, with VdAve1 was found neither to increase nor decrease virulence when inoculated on a susceptible strawberry cultivar. There are therefore virulence factors that are epistatic to VdAve1 and potentially multiple independent routes to high virulence on strawberry in V. dahliae lineages. Genome sequencing a subset of isolates across the two VCGs revealed that isolates were differentiated at the whole genome level and contained multiple changes in putative effector content, indicating that different clonal VCGs may have evolved different strategies for infecting strawberry, leading to different virulence levels in pathogenicity tests. It is therefore important to consider both clonal lineage and effector complement as the adaptive potential of each lineage will differ, even if they contain the same race determining effector.",

        "abstract": "Verticillium dahliae is a soilborne fungus that causes vascular wilt diseases on numerous plant species worldwide. The production of darkly melanized microsclerotia is crucial in the disease cycle of V. dahliae, as these structures allow for long-term survival in soil. Previously, transcriptomic and genomic analysis identified a cluster of genes in V. dahliae that encodes some dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin biosynthetic pathway homologues found in related fungi. In this study, we explored the roles of cluster-specific transcription factor VdCmr1, as well as two other genes within the cluster encoding a polyketide synthase (VdPKS1) and a laccase (VdLac1), enzymes at initial and endpoint steps in DHN melanin production. The results revealed that VdCmr1 and VdPKS1 are required for melanin production, but neither is required for microsclerotia production. None of the three genes were required for pathogenesis on tobacco and lettuce. Exposure of \u0394VdCmr1 and wild-type strains to UV irradiation, or to high temperature (40\u2009\u00b0C), revealed an approx. 50\u200a% reduction of survival in the \u0394VdCmr1 strain, relative to the wild-type strain, in response to either condition. Expression profiles revealed that expression of some melanin biosynthetic genes are in part dependent on VdCmr1. Combined data indicate VdCmr1 is a key regulator of melanin biosynthesis, and that via regulation of melanogenesis, VdCmr1 affects survival of V. dahliae in response to abiotic threats. We conclude with a model showing regulation of VdCmr1 by a high osmolarity glycerol response (Hog)-type MAP kinase pathway.",

Microsclerotia are the main resting structure of V. dahliae in soil and can survive for more than 10 years, serving as an important source of primary inoculum. Mass production of microsclerotia in laboratory is valuable for studying various aspects of V. dahilae, such as its biology, epidemiology and control. We failed to produce a sufficient amount of microsclerotia in vitro for one strain of our interest using several previously published methods. Therefore, we developed a new protocol for mass in vitro production of viable microsclerotia. Verticillium strains were cultured in a modified basal agar medium at pH of 11. 5 under 20 \u00b0C and incubated for 25 days in dark. When 16 strains were subjected to this condition, large numbers of microsclerotia were produced although varied greatly among strains, including the strain that failed to produce microsclerotia with previously published methods. Microsclerotia from 14 of the 16 strains resulted in wilt development on inoculated cotton seedlings. \u00a9 2013 KNPV.",

        "abstract": "Verticillium dahliae is a fungal pathogen causing Verticillium wilt on a range of economically important crops. Microsclerotia are its main survival and dormancy structures and serve as the primary inoculum on many hosts. Studies were conducted to determine the effect of temperature (5 to 50\u00b0C), pH (2 to 12) and nutrient regimes on microsclerotia germination. The optimal condition for microsclerotium germination was 20\u00b0C with pH 8.0 whereas nutrient regimes had no significant effect on its germination. The whole genome wide expression profiles during microsclerotium germination were characterized using the Illumina sequencing technology. Approximately 7.4 million of 21-nt cDNA tags were sequenced in the cDNA libraries derived from germinated and non-germinated microsclerotia. About 3.9% and 2.3% of the unique tags were up-regulated and down-regulated at least five-fold, respectively, in the germinated microsclerotia compared with the non-germinated microsclerotia. A total of 1654 genes showing differential expression were identified. Genes that are likely to have played important roles in microsclerotium germination include those encoding G-protein coupled receptor, lipase/esterase, cyclopentanone 1,2-monooxygenase, H(+)/hexose cotransporter 1, fungal Zn(2)-Cys(6) binuclear cluster domain, thymus-specific serine protease, glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase, and alcohol dehydrogenase. These genes were mainly up-regulated or down-regulated only in germinated microsclerotia, compared with non-germinated microsclerotia. The differential expression of genes was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis of 20 randomly selected genes from the 40 most differentially expressed genes.",

        "abstract": "Quantification of Verticillium dahliae microsclerotia is an important component of wilt management on a range of crops. Estimation of microsclerotia by dry or wet sieving and plating of soil samples on semiselective medium is a commonly used technique but this method is resource-intensive. We developed a new molecular quantification method based on Synergy Brands (SYBR) Green real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction of wet-sieving samples (wet-sieving qPCR). This method can detect V. dahliae microsclerotia as low as 0.5 CFU g(-1) of soil. There was a high correlation (r = 0.98) between the estimates of conventional plating analysis and the new wet-sieving qPCR method for 40 soil samples. To estimate the inoculum threshold for cotton wilt, >400 soil samples were taken from the rhizosphere of individual plants with or without visual wilt symptoms in experimental and commercial cotton fields at the boll-forming stage. Wilt inoculum was estimated using the wet-sieving qPCR method and related to wilt development. The estimated inoculum threshold varied with cultivar, ranging from 4.0 and 7.0 CFU g(-1) of soil for susceptible and resistant cultivars, respectively. In addition, there was an overall relationship of wilt incidence with inoculum density across 31 commercial fields where a single composite soil sample was taken at each field, with an estimated inoculum threshold of 11 CFU g(-1) of soil. These results suggest that wilt risk can be predicted from the estimated soil inoculum density using the new wet-sieving qPCR method. We recommend the use of 4.0 and 7.0 CFU g(-1) as an inoculum threshold on susceptible and resistant cultivars, respectively, in practical risk prediction schemes.",

        "abstract": "Verticillium dahliae is a soilborne fungus that causes vascular wilt diseases on numerous plant species worldwide. The production of darkly melanized microsclerotia is crucial in the disease cycle of V. dahliae, as these structures allow for long-term survival in soil. Previously, transcriptomic and genomic analysis identified a cluster of genes in V. dahliae that encodes some dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin biosynthetic pathway homologues found in related fungi. In this study, we explored the roles of cluster-specific transcription factor VdCmr1, as well as two other genes within the cluster encoding a polyketide synthase (VdPKS1) and a laccase (VdLac1), enzymes at initial and endpoint steps in DHN melanin production. The results revealed that VdCmr1 and VdPKS1 are required for melanin production, but neither is required for microsclerotia production. None of the three genes were required for pathogenesis on tobacco and lettuce. Exposure of \u0394VdCmr1 and wild-type strains to UV irradiation, or to high temperature (40\u2009\u00b0C), revealed an approx. 50\u200a% reduction of survival in the \u0394VdCmr1 strain, relative to the wild-type strain, in response to either condition. Expression profiles revealed that expression of some melanin biosynthetic genes are in part dependent on VdCmr1. Combined data indicate VdCmr1 is a key regulator of melanin biosynthesis, and that via regulation of melanogenesis, VdCmr1 affects survival of V. dahliae in response to abiotic threats. We conclude with a model showing regulation of VdCmr1 by a high osmolarity glycerol response (Hog)-type MAP kinase pathway.",

The occurrence of Verticillium plant wilt was determined by the number and survival status of MS in soil. The optimal conditions for MS germination and lethal temperature were investigated by using V. dahliae strain XJ2008 as experiment material. Results showed that 20\u2103 and pH8.0 were the optimal conditions for MS germination. MS of V. dahliae can tolerate high temperature. The germination rate of MS showed a downward trend with the extension of treat time under different temperature. The MS germination ratedeclined greatly when at and above 55\u2103. However, it declined slowly at and below 50\u2103. The MS were completely dead when treated at 55\u2103 for 360min. There was still a small amount of MS survival when treated at 40\u2103, 45\u2103, and 50\u2103 for 1,440min, but their germination declined gradually with time. The simulation results of MS in soil showed that soil temperature had a strong lethal effect to MS. The MS were completely lost vital when treated in soil at 40\u2103 for 4 days. The results provided a theoretical base for management of Verticillium wilts across-the-board range of crops through applying plastic film to increase soil temperature.",

        "abstract": "Verticillium dahliae colonizes vascular tissue and causes vascular discoloration in susceptible hosts. Two well-defined races exist in V. dahliae populations from tomato and lettuce. In this study, proteins and metabolites obtained from stems of race 1-incompatible (Beefsteak) and -compatible (Early Pak) tomato cultivars were characterized. A total of 814 and 584 proteins in Beefsteak; and 456 and 637 proteins in Early Pak were identified in stem extracts of plants inoculated with races 1 and 2, respectively. A significant number of defense-related proteins were expressed in each tomato-V. dahliae interaction, as anticipated. However, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), an important defense-associated enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway, in addition to remorin 1, NAD-dependent epimerase/dehydratase, and polyphenol oxidase were uniquely expressed in the incompatible interaction. Compared with the uninoculated control, significant overexpression of gene ontology terms associated with lignin biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid pathway and carbohydrate methylation were identified exclusively in the incompatible interaction. Phenolic compounds known to be involved in plant defense mechanisms were at higher levels in the incompatible relative to the compatible interactions. Based on our findings, PAL and enzymes involved defense-related secondary metabolism and the strengthening of cell walls is likely critical to confer resistance to race 1 of V. dahliae in tomato. SIGNIFICANCE: Verticillium dahliae, a soilborne fungal pathogen and a widely distributed fungal pathogen, colonizes vascular tissue and causes vascular discoloration in roots and stems, leaf wilting, and death of susceptible plant hosts. It causes billions of dollars in annual crop losses all over the world. The study focused on the proteomic and metabalomic of V. dahliae interactions (incompatible with Beefsteak and compatible with Early Pak tomato cultivars). Based on our findings, PAL and enzymes involved defense-related secondary metabolism and the strengthening of cell walls is likely critical to confer resistance to race 1 of V. dahliae in tomato.",

        "abstract": "Hemispheric asymmetry reduction in older adults (HAROLD) has been frequently reported in studies of functional brain aging. It is commonly considered to be a plastic brain reorganization that provides compensation for declining unilateral neural efficiency. However, plastic functional alterations may also be associated with neural connectivity changes. Using activation and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as well as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we examined whether functional and structural connectivity related to prefrontal working memory function is asymmetrically reduced in the two hemispheres of the aging brain; and if yes, whether these asymmetric connectivity declines are correlated with asymmetry reduction in functional activation. With regions of interests defined by verbal working memory activations, it is revealed that although neural connectivity is generally reduced in the aging brain, prefrontal\u2013parietal resting functional connectivity is better preserved in the left hemisphere while prefrontal DTI fiber pathways are better preserved in the right hemisphere. In addition, the laterality change of the functional activation is negatively correlated with that of the resting connectivity and positively correlated with that of the structural connectivity. These results reveal additional aspects of the neuronal alterations of aging and suggest a link between asymmetric connectivity reduction and HAROLD.",

        "abstract": "A function of working memory is to remember the temporal sequence of events, often occurring across different sensory modalities. To study the neural correlates of this function, we conducted an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment with a cross-modal memory task. Subjects were required to recall auditory digits and visual locations either in mixed order (cross-modality) or in separate order (within-modality). To identify the brain regions involved in the memory of cross-modal temporal order, we compared the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response between the mixed and the separate order tasks. As a control, cortical areas sensitive to the memory load were mapped by comparing the 10-item condition with the 6-item condition in the separate order task. Results show that the bilateral prefrontal, right premotor, temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and left superior parietal cortices had significantly more activation in the mixed task than in the separate task. Some of these areas were also sensitive to the memory load, whereas the right prefrontal cortex and TPJ were relatively more sensitive to the cross-modal order but not the memory load. Our study provides potential neural correlates for the episodic buffer, a key component of working memory as proposed previously [Baddeley. Trends Cogn Sci 2000;4:417-423].",

A number of areas were activated during the recall. In young adults, greater activation was found in the left prefrontal cortex (BA9) and the left occipital visual cortex during backward digit recall than forward digit recall. In contrast, the activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44/45) was more extensive in forward digit recall than in backward digit recall. In older adults, backward recall generated stronger activation than forward recall in most areas, including the frontal, the parietal, the occipital, and the temporal cortices. In the backward recall condition, the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA44/45) showed more activation in the old group than in the young group. These results suggest that different neural mechanisms may be involved in forward and backward digit recall and brain functions associated with these two types of recall are differentially affected by aging.",

However, it is not clear how much of this switching cost is due to the existence or absence of the stimulus identification priming. With a figure identification and counting task, we demonstrate a small but significant priming contribution to this attention-switching cost. Furthermore, through 64-channel event-related potential (ERP) recordings, we found two ERP correlates (at 280 ms and 388 ms) of this internal attention-switching function. Source localization analysis shows dynamic brain activation starts from the temporal-occipital region and finishes in the left prefrontal cortex. The occipital-prefrontal and cingulate-prefrontal co-activations were orderly observed. We discuss the present ERP results along with our previous fMRI findings and suggest a dominant role of the left prefrontal cortex associated with attention shifts in verbal working memory.",

In the present preliminary functional magnetic resonance imaging study using a backward masking paradigm, the effect of indiscriminate smoking-related stimuli on 10 smokers and 10 nonsmokers was examined. The BOLD response showed a significant reduction (P = 0.001) in the right amygdala of smokers when they viewed but did not perceive masked smoking-related stimuli, while no significant differences were found in the nonsmoker group. More voxels in anterior cingulate cortex were negatively correlated with the amygdala during the masked smoking-related picture condition in smokers but not in nonsmokers, whereas more positively correlated voxels were observed during the masked neutral condition. The BOLD response in drug-users indicates the amygdala responds to drug-related stimuli that are below the perceptual threshold. The functional connectivity data suggest a functional interaction between the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex when drug users view 33 ms back-masked drug-related stimuli. This observation suggests that the amygdala plays an important role in the indiscriminate drug-related cue process.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop high-affinity single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers that can selectively recognize the protein Ras and can be used as preventive and therapeutic agents for restenosis occurring after coronary surgery or angioplasty. For this purpose, we used the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) technique, also known as in vitro selection. Using this technique, ssDNA aptamers recognizing the Ras protein were obtained from a synthesized random ssDNA library in vitro. The binding rate and affinity of each aptamer pool, isolated in successive rounds of selection, were measured using ELISA, and the finally selected aptamer pool was cloned and sequenced. The binding affinities of each aptamer in this pool were measured. Their primary and secondary structures were analyzed using the DNAMAN 5.29 software, and the relationship between these structures and corresponding binding affinities was analyzed. The rate of aptamer pool binding to the Ras protein gradually increased from 2.4 to 34.5% along the selection process. Optical density (OD) and equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) measurements showed that OD gradually increased from 0.220 to 1.080 and Kd decreased from 51.5 to 18.3 nM. The 11th pool of aptamers was selected based on these analyses, and cloning and sequencing of individual aptamers was performed. Secondary structure analysis revealed different conformations, but of a single type: stem\u2011loop. The aptamer Ra1 showed the highest affinity, with a measured OD of 1.213 and an estimated Kd of 15.3 nM. The binding affinity of the aptamer Ra1 to Ras was dose-dependent. In conclusion, high\u2011affinity ssDNA aptamers recognizing the Ras protein have been successfully selected. These aptamers may serve in the future as preventive and/or therapeutic agents for restenosis occurring after coronary surgery or angioplasty.",

Methods: Sixty-seven patients with Stanford type B aortic dissection underwent surgery. Under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, stent-graft in surgical operation was implanted through the aortic arch incision between the left carotid artery and left subclavian artery. The goals of the therapy were to cover the primary tear site, expand the true lumen with obliteration of the false lumen, and restore adequate flow and perfusion in the distal aorta. Results: Cardiopulmonary bypass time was (153\u00b131) min (114-190 min), average cross clamp time was (31\u00b13)min (22-42 min), and the duration of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was (19\u00b14) min (12-25 min). The complications included transient neurologic deficit in 8 cases, cerebrovascular accident in 3 cases, hemorrhage of anastomose which was treated by reoperation in 2 cases, and hoarseness in one case. Results; Stent-graft in surgical operation for the treatment of Stanford type B aortic dissection is safe, effective, and feasible, which will be helpful to vascular reconstruction by accurate covering the primary tear site with minimal invasion and less complications.",

Meta-analysis for effect size, t test, and I(2) for detecting heterogeneity and sensitivity analysis for assessing the relative influence of each study was performed.Fifteen included studies encompassed a total of 5060 patients of whom 2855 were treated with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest plus ACP and 1897 were treated with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest plus RCP. Pooled analysis showed no significant statistical difference (P > .01) of 30-day mortality, permanent neurologic dysfunction, and transient neurologic dysfunction in the 2 groups. Before sensitivity analysis, postoperative stroke incidence in the ACP group was higher than in the RCP group (7.2% vs 4.7%; P < .01). After a study that included a different percentage of patients with a history of central neurologic events in the 2 groups was ruled out, postoperative stroke incidence in the 2 groups also showed no significant statistical difference (P > .01).ACP and RCP provide similar cerebral protective effectiveness combined with deep hypothermia circulatory arrest and could be selected according to the actual condition in aortic arch surgery. A high-quality randomized controlled trial is urgently needed to confirm this conclusion, especially for stroke morbidity following ACP or RCP.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the effects of tight blood glucose control on the short-term prognosis of the patients after heart valve replacement, in order to improve treatment effectiveness and lower postoperative complications. Methods A total of 240 patients including 150 males and 90 females underwent mitral valve replacement or mitral and aortic valve replacement were enrolled in this study from January 2007 to December 2008 at the cardiac surgery department of Renmin hospital of Wuhan university. The age of these patients ranged from 19 to 65 years old with an average age of 53.33 years. According to insulin administration time and blood glucose control level, they were randomly separated into two groups. In the experimental group, there were 121 patients who received continuous insulin infusion to maintain postoperative glucose level between 4.4 and 6.1 mmol/L, while 119 patients in the control group received insulin infusion when their glucose level went higher than 11.1 mmol/L to control the level between 6.1 and 11.1 mmol/L. Then the postoperative wound infection, malignant arrhythmia rate, the assisted ventilation time, intensive care unit(ICU) stay time and count of neutrophils were compared and analyzed. Results There was no hospitalized death in both groups. The rate of wound infection(3.31% vs.10.08%, \u03c72=4.430,P=0.035), the assisted ventilation time(9.02\u00b12.73 h vs. 10.01\u00b13.58 h, t=2.280,P=0.024), time for count of leukocytes to decrease to the normal level(11.04\u00b13.16 d vs. 12.05\u00b13.76 d, t=2.168,P=0.031), average hospitalization time(13.49\u00b13.81 d vs. 14.51\u00b14.02 d, t=2.017,P=0.045), and count of neutrophils on the third day(0.82\u00b10.04 vs. 0.84\u00b10.05, t=2.644,P=0.009) in the experimental group were significantly lower or shorter than those in the control group. But there was no significant difference between both groups in ICU stay time and the rate of malignant arrhythmia. Conclusion Tight blood glucose control can lower the rate of postoperative wound infection, shorten the assisted ventilation time and hospitalization time, and reduce the usage of antibiotics in patients after heart valve replacement. Accordingly, it can enhance the curative effect, reduce overall medical expenses, and improve prognosis.",

        "abstract": "Several recent studies have compared the clinical results of valve-sparing (VS) surgery and composite valve graft (CVG) surgery in the aortic root reconstruction of Marfan syndrome (MS) patients. The study aim was to investigate whether it is appropriate to preserve the native aortic valve in root surgery of MFS patients when taking the short-term and long-term prognoses into consideration.A thorough literature search of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane library was conducted to identify studies comparing the outcomes of VS and CVG surgery in MFS patients. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale evaluation scheme was used to assess the methodological quality of the included articles. Data were extracted from reports and analyzed using Revman 5.0, supplied by Cochrane collaboration.Six clinical trials incorporating 539 patients were included. Compared to CVG, VS surgery was associated with a lower risk for re-exploration (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24-0.97; p = 0.04), thromboembolic events (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05-0.57; p = 0.004) and endocarditis (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11-0.94; p = 0.04). Despite an inherent incidence of aortic regurgitation, VS surgery resulted in an elevation of long-term survival rate; however, no statistical differences were found between groups with regards to reoperation (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.35-3.27; p = 0.91).Root reconstruction with VS surgery can effectively improve the prognosis of MFS patients and provide a promising alternative for surgical treatment. However, the results must be interpreted with caution due to the retrospective nature of the included studies; large-scale prospective control trials are needed to confirm these findings.",

Study quality was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot together with Egger test. Clinical outcomes data was extracted from the manuscripts and analyzed with Revman 5.0 supplied by Cochrane collaboration.Seven clinical trials with 690 patients were included. Meta- analysis demonstrated that valve sparing surgery was associated with a lower incidence of re-exploration (RR = 0.51, 95%CI:0.29- 0.90, P < 0.05), thromboembolism (RR = 0.17, 95%CI:0.05-0.57, P < 0.01), endocarditis (RR = 0.31, 95%CI:0.11-0.94, P < 0.05) and significantly lower long-term death rate (RR = 0.37, 95%CI:0.18-0.74, P < 0.01). Reoperation rate was similar between the two groups (RR = 1.07, 95%CI:0.35-3.27, P > 0.05).Valve sparing aortic root reconstruction surgery is a superior procedure to composite valve graft surgery in term of improving the short- and long-term prognosis for patients with Marfan syndrome.",

        "abstract": "The development of acute aortic dissection (AD) is attributed to unbearable wall tension superimposed on disordered of cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) in the aortic wall. Adventitial fibroblasts (AFs) phenotypic differentiation response to stress exhibits essential function to regulate the remolding of vascular. Little is known about the AFs phenotypic differentiation and its possible mechanism in patients with AD. In this study, we examined their roles in AD. Surgical specimens of the aorta from AD patients (n = 10) and controls (n = 10) were tested for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1,2 (ERK1/2) and phospho-ERK1/2 expression, respectively by western blot. When compared with controls, protein levels of \u03b1-SMA was significantly decreased and levels of phospho-ERK1/2 was increased significantly in the aortic wall from patients with AD. Immunohistochemistry results showed elevated staining of both \u03b1-SMA and phospho-ERK1/2 in the adventitia of the aortic wall from patients with AD, on the contrary, staining of \u03b1-SMA in the media was decreased compared with controls. In vitro, the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway was involved in Ang-II-induced phenotypic differentiation and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) mRNA expression in AFs. This study provides a new insight into the biological action of AFs and phospho-ERK1/2 promoting phenotypic differentiation and MMP-2 expression, suggesting an important role of AFs in leading to disorder the delicate balance of ECM metabolism in the aortic wall, so that AFs may be an essential participant during AD formation.",

P54(nrb) /NonO is known to be involved in collagen formation. In this study, we examined whether AD is associated with abnormal P54(nrb) /NonO expression.Aortic specimens and serum were obtained from 10 patients with AD and 10 controls. In-vitro cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and adventitial fibroblasts (AFs) were obtained from organ donors. P54(nrb) /NonO protein and mRNA levels were determined by Western blot, immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (quantitative real-time RT-PCR). To evaluate collagen expression, we stained tissue sections with Masson's trichrome. Serum concentration of TNF-\u03b1 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Aortic P54(nrb) /NonO protein and mRNA were decreased in AD patients, compared with controls. Decreased P54(nrb) /NonO mRNA correlated significantly with increased collagen deposition and fibrosis in AD aortas. In VSMCs and AFs from normal human aortas, P54(nrb) /NonO was expressed strongly and localized to the nucleus.Patients with AD exhibited significantly decreased expression of P54(nrb) /NonO. The significant correlation between P54(nrb) /NonO and collagen may point to novel thinking about collagen metabolism research in AD aorta.",

        "abstract": "Proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) mediated by Ras proteins are crucial in restenosis following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). In this study, a novel, single\u2011stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamer designated as Ras\u2011a1 with high affinity and specificity to human Ras protein was isolated using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment. Ras\u2011a1 was delivered into VSMCs by electroporation using one square waveform of 200\u00a0V for 20\u00a0msec. Proliferation of VSMCs was determined using a cell counting kit\u20118 assay, which revealed the maximal inhibitory rate (40%) was obtained at 24\u00a0h after Ras\u2011a1 transfection. The migration of VSMCs, determined using a Transwell assay, was significantly inhibited in Ras\u2011a1 cells in a time\u2011dependent manner. To investigate the potential mechanisms of transfected Ras\u2011a1 on the migration and proliferation of VSMCs, the phosphorylation of MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and Akt was determined using western blot analysis, which showed that a marked downregulation was observed in the phosphorylation of MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and Akt following the delivery of Ras\u2011a1. This result demonstrated that Ras\u2011a1 inhibits the proliferation and migration of VSMCs by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Ras and interrupting signal transduction in the Ras\u2011MEK1/2\u2011ERK1/2 and phosphoinositide\u20113 kinase/Akt pathways. The novel Ras protein\u2011targeted ssDNA aptamer selected may be applicable for the prevention of restenosis after PCI and CABG.",

        "abstract": "Acute type B aortic dissection (ATBAD) is a life-threatening condition. Open chest surgical repair using a prosthetic graft has been a conventional treatment for ATBAD. During the past decade, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), which is considered as a less invasive and potentially safer technique, has been increasingly used to treat this condition. Evidence is needed to support the use of TEVAR for these patients. The aim of this review was to assess the efficacy of TEVAR versus conventional open surgery in patients with ATBAD.For this review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (last searched: 2010, issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Chinese Biomedicine Database for clinical trials until January 18, 2011. Controlled trials in which patients with ATBAD were assigned to TEVAR or open surgical repair were included. For each outcome, we evaluated the quality of the evidence with reference to the Grading of Recommendations Assessments, Development, and Evaluation criteria. At the end, we used RevMan 5.0 software to analyze the datum.Five trials (318 participants) are included in this review. As determined by the Grading of Recommendations Assessments, Development, and Evaluation approach, the result quality was low for 30-day mortality and very low for other variables. TEVAR can significantly reduce the short-term mortality for ATBAD (Mantel-Haenszel fixed odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.19 [0.09-0.39], P < 0.001). TEVAR cannot significantly improve postoperative complications or long-term mortality.TEVAR can be weakly recommended as an alternative for the selective treatment of ATBAD but cannot always be used in case of surgery.",

        "abstract": "The elephant trunk method was introduced to treat aortic disease. There are a variety of modified elephant trunk methods, including the stented elephant trunk. We retrospectively reviewed our experience and evaluated the effectiveness of surgical treatment for acute aortic dissection using the Chinese CRONUS stented elephant trunk technique.From August 2005 to December 2012, 252 patients with acute aortic dissection underwent surgical treatment using the Chinese CRONUS stented elephant trunk technique at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. We review the characteristics of the patients, the surgical method, and the prognosis. Furthermore, we modified the stented elephant trunk technique to simplify the surgical procedure using stented elephant trunk fenestration in 81 patients.The procedure was technically successful in all patients. The mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, myocardial ischemia, and circulatory arrest was 158\u00b134 minutes, 98\u00b124 minutes, and 27\u00b19 minutes, respectively. The mean stay in the intensive care unit was 74\u00b111 hours. The in-hospital mortality rate was 3.2% (8/252). A 92.2% (225/244) follow-up rate was achieved. Five patients died during follow-up. The diameter of the descending aorta significantly decreased in 173 patients (78.6%), did not change 39 patients (17.7%), and dilated in 8 patients (3.7%).In surgery for acute aortic dissection, the Chinese CRONUS stented elephant trunk technique had a low prevalence of morbidity and mortality in our patients. The satisfactory effects demonstrated that the technique is safe and effective in closing the residual false lumen of the descending aorta. Stented elephant trunk fenestration could further simplify the surgical procedure with minimal invasion.",

Methods: A limited \"fish-mouthed\" incision (1.5-2.0 cm) was made in bloodless region of the apex of left ventricle about 1 cm away from anterior descending coronary artery. VSDs were exposed by pulling left ventricular wall with two hooks. All VSDs were closed by using a Dacron patch and continuous sutures with 4-0 prolene. The limited apical left ventriculotomy was then closed with doublelayer felts and 2-0 prolene suture. The rates of residual shunts, arrhythmia, apical dyskinesia and ventricular aneurysm were investigated postoperatively. Results: There were no surgical deaths and residual shunts occurred. Only one complete atrioventricular block and one ventricular premature beat were found early after operation. Both cases returned to normal rhythm before discharge from hospital. All children's left ventricular ejection fractions were normal. No other arrhythmia, apical dyskinesia and ventricular aneurysm happened. Conclusion: The limited apical left ventriculotomy could provide better exposure for apical VSDs, and the rates of residual shunts, arrhythmia, apical dyskinesia and ventricular aneurysm are very low. It is a suitable and effective surgical approach for apical ventricular septal defects.",

        "abstract": "There is a trend towards using the axillary artery cannulation (AXC) site for cardiopulmonary bypass surgery in patients requiring acute type A aortic dissection (AAD) repair. However, AXC has not been established as a routine procedure, because there is controversy about its clinical advantage when compared with femoral artery cannulation (FAC). This meta-analysis assesses major short-term outcomes in patients undergoing acute AAD repair with AXC or FAC using non-randomized retrospective studies dating from 1992 to 2011 comparing AXC and FAC for major outcomes. Outcomes of interest were short-term mortality, neurological dysfunction and malperfusion. The fixed-effects model was used. Sensitivity and heterogeneity were analysed. Analysis of nine non-randomized studies comprising 715 patients [AXC, 359 (50.2%) and FAC, 356 (49.8%)] showed a significantly lower incidence of short-term mortality in the AXC group [odds ratio, 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.15, 0.42), \u03c7(2) = 7.23, P < 0.01]. The pattern of incidence of neurological dysfunction among the AXC group [odds ratio, 0.46, 95% CI (0.29, 0.72), \u03c7(2) = 9.01, P < 0.01] was similar. The incidence of malperfusion did not differ [odds ratio, 0.84, 95% CI (0.37, 1.90), \u03c7(2) = 2.25, P = 0.67]. Because no study was a randomized trial, our results are more uncertain than indicated by the 95% CI. Nevertheless, AXC seems to give better short-term mortality and neurological dysfunction rates than FAC.",

        "abstract": "Recently we introduced a robust measure, integrated local correlation (ILC), of local connectivity in the brain using fMRI data which reflects the temporal correlation of brain activity in every voxel neighborhood. The current work studies ILC in fMRI data obtained in the absence and presence of sevoflurane anesthesia (0%, 2%, and 1% end-tidal concentration, respectively) administered to healthy volunteers. ILC was determined specifically in regions of the default mode network (DMN) to address local changes in each state. In addition, a potential confound in analyses based on correlations due to signal-to-noise variations was addressed by wavelet denoising. This accommodated decreases in signal power commonly seen during anesthesia without artificially reducing derived correlations. Results showed that ILC was significantly reduced in the entire DMN during 2% sevoflurane yet recovered in the posterior and anterior cingulate cortices as well as inferior parietal cortex during 1% sevoflurane. By contrast, ILC remained attenuated prefrontally in the 1% condition, which indicates uncoupling of the frontal areas of DMN during light anesthesia. These results confirm widespread anesthetic-induced cortical suppression but also demonstrate that the local connectivity of the prefrontal cortex is rapidly reduced by sevoflurane. It remains to be seen whether these alterations arise locally as a direct consequence of anesthetic action on local neurons or are driven by distant changes in oscillations and activity elsewhere in the brain.",

        "abstract": "Interactions between brain regions have been recognized as a critical ingredient required to understand brain function. Two modes of interactions have held prominence-synchronization and causal influence. Efforts to ascertain causal influence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data have relied primarily on confirmatory model-driven approaches, such as dynamic causal modeling and structural equation modeling, and exploratory data-driven approaches such as Granger causality analysis. A slew of recent articles have focused on the relative merits and caveats of these approaches. The relevant studies can be classified into simulations, theoretical developments, and experimental results. In the first part of this review, we will consider each of these themes and critically evaluate their arguments, with regard to Granger causality analysis. Specifically, we argue that simulations are bounded by the assumptions and simplifications made by the simulator, and hence must be regarded only as a guide to experimental design and should not be viewed as the final word. On the theoretical front, we reason that each of the improvements to existing, yet disparate, methods brings them closer to each other with the hope of eventually leading to a unified framework specifically designed for fMRI. We then review latest experimental results that demonstrate the utility and validity of Granger causality analysis under certain experimental conditions. In the second part, we will consider current issues in causal connectivity analysis-hemodynamic variability, sampling, instantaneous versus causal relationship, and task versus resting states. We highlight some of our own work regarding these issues showing the effect of hemodynamic variability and sampling on Granger causality. Further, we discuss recent techniques such as the cubature Kalman filtering, which can perform blind deconvolution of the hemodynamic response robustly well, and hence enabling wider application of Granger causality analysis. Finally, we discuss our previous work on the less-appreciated interactions between instantaneous and causal relationships and the utility and interpretation of Granger causality results obtained from task versus resting state (e.g., ability of causal relationships to provide a mode of connectivity between regions that are instantaneously dissociated in resting state). We conclude by discussing future directions in this area.",

        "abstract": "In this work, recent advances in the field of nonlinear dynamics (NLD) were applied to fMRI data to examine the spatio-temporal properties of BOLD resting state fluctuations. Five human subjects were imaged during resting state (visual fixation) at 3T using single-shot gradient echo planar imaging (EPI). Respiration and cardiac signals were concurrently recorded for retrospectively removing fluctuations due to these physiologic activities. Patterns of singularity in the complex plane (PSC) and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZ) were used to study the deterministic nonlinearity in resting state fMRI data. The results show that there is greater nonlinearity (higher PSC) and determinism (lower LZ) in gray matter compared to white matter and CSF. In addition, the removal of respiratory and cardiac pulsations decreases the nonlinearity and determinism but does not alter the relative difference between gray matter and white matter. Therefore, our results demonstrate that determinism and nonlinearity in the fMRI data are tissue-specific, suggesting that they reflect native physiologic and metabolic fluctuations and are not a result of physiologic artifacts due to respiration and cardiac pulsation.",

        "abstract": "Developmental neuropsychology and functional neuroimaging evidence indicates that simple and complex mental calculation is subserved by a fronto-parietal network. However, the effective connectivity (connection direction and strength) among regions within the fronto-parietal network is still unexplored. Combining event-related fMRI and multivariate Granger Causality Mapping (GCM), we administered a multiplication verification task to healthy participants asking them to solve single and double-digit multiplications. The goals of our study were first, to identify the effective connectivity of the multiplication network, and second, to compare the effective connectivity patterns between a low and a high arithmetical competence (AC) group. The manipulation of multiplication difficulty revealed a fronto-parietal network encompassing bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS), left pre-supplementary motor area (PreSMA), left precentral gyrus (PreCG), and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The network was driven by an intraparietal IPS-IPS circuit hosting a representation of numerical quantity intertwined with a fronto-parietal DLPFC-IPS circuit engaged in temporary storage and updating of arithmetic operations. Both circuits received additional inputs from the PreCG and PreSMA playing more of a supportive role in mental calculation. The high AC group compared to the low AC group displayed a greater activation in the right IPS and based its calculation more on a feedback driven intraparietal IPS-IPS circuit, whereas the low competence group more on a feedback driven fronto-parietal DLPFC-IPS circuit. This study provides first evidence that multivariate GCM is a sensitive approach to investigate effective connectivity of mental processes involved in mental calculation and to compare group level performances for different populations.",

        "abstract": "This article introduces the measure of integrated local correlation (ILC) for assessing local coherence in the brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and characterizes the measure in terms of reproducibility, the effect of physiological noise, and the dependence on image resolution. The coupling of local neuronal processes influences coherence in a voxel's neighborhood. ILC is defined, for each voxel, as the integration of its spatial correlation function. This integrated measure does not require the specification of a neighborhood and, as demonstrated by experimental data, is effectively independent of image resolution. Respiratory and cardiac fluctuations do not considerably alter the ILC value except in isolated areas in and surrounding large vessels. With resting-state fMRI data, ILC was demonstrated to be tissue-specific, higher in gray matter than white matter, and reproducible across consecutive runs in healthy individuals. Within the gray matter, ILC was found to be higher in the default mode network, particularly the posterior and anterior cingulate cortices. Comparing ILC maps obtained from resting state and continuous motor task data, we observed reduced local coherence in the default mode network during the task. Finally, we compared ILC and regional homogeneity by examining their ability to discriminate between gray and white matters in resting state data and found ILC to be more sensitive.",

        "abstract": "It is increasingly being recognized that resting state brain connectivity derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is an important marker of brain function both in healthy and clinical populations. Though linear correlation has been extensively used to characterize brain connectivity, it is limited to detecting first order dependencies. In this study, we propose a framework where in phase synchronization (PS) between brain regions is characterized using a new metric \"correlation between probabilities of recurrence\" (CPR) and subsequent graph-theoretic analysis of the ensuing networks. We applied this method to resting state fMRI data obtained from human subjects with and without administration of propofol anesthetic. Our results showed decreased PS during anesthesia and a biologically more plausible community structure using CPR rather than linear correlation. We conclude that CPR provides an attractive nonparametric method for modeling interactions in brain networks as compared to standard correlation for obtaining physiologically meaningful insights about brain function.",

        "abstract": "A recent study showed that people evaluate products more positively when they are physically associated with art images than similar non-art images. Neuroimaging studies of visual art have investigated artistic style and esthetic preference but not brain responses attributable specifically to the artistic status of images. Here we tested the hypothesis that the artistic status of images engages reward circuitry, using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during viewing of art and non-art images matched for content. Subjects made animacy judgments in response to each image. Relative to non-art images, art images activated, on both subject- and item-wise analyses, reward-related regions: the ventral striatum, hypothalamus and orbitofrontal cortex. Neither response times nor ratings of familiarity or esthetic preference for art images correlated significantly with activity that was selective for art images, suggesting that these variables were not responsible for the art-selective activations. Investigation of effective connectivity, using time-varying, wavelet-based, correlation-purged Granger causality analyses, further showed that the ventral striatum was driven by visual cortical regions when viewing art images but not non-art images, and was not driven by regions that correlated with esthetic preference for either art or non-art images. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis, leading us to propose that the appeal of visual art involves activation of reward circuitry based on artistic status alone and independently of its hedonic value.",

The results show that there are clear effects of N 2 partial pressure on the deposition rate, phases, hardness and elastic modulus of magnetron sputtered NbN films. At a low N 2 partial pressure, the deposition rate is higher, while hcp \u03b2-Nb 2 N and fcc \u03b4-NbN coexist in NbN films. With the increase of N 2 pressure, the deposition rate decreases and the films are single-phase fcc \u03b4NbN; accordingly, the hardness and modulus reach peak values of 36.6 GPa and 457 GPa, respectively. A further increase of the N 2 partial pressure will cause hcp \u03b5-NbN to appear in NbN films and then the hardness and modulus of films decrease.",

        "abstract": "To reveal the interfacial phase structure and its effect on mechanical properties of Ti-Si-N composite films, x-ray diffractometry, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and microhardness tester were employed to investigate the interfacial phase structure and mechanical properties of magnetron sputtered Ti-Si-N composite films. A series of TiN/Si3N4 multilayered films in nanometer scale were also prepared and characterized for comparison. The results indicated that Ti-Si-N composite films formed a structure of nanocrystalline TiN surrounded by Si3N4 interfacial phase. In the Ti-Si-N composite film with lower silicon content, the Si3N4 interfacial phase with a thickness of less than 1 nm crystallized and formed a coherent interface with TiN nanocrystals, leading to an enhancement in the hardness of the film. Whereas, in the composite film of larger silicon content, Si3N4 phase existed as amorphous and resulted in a decrease in hardness. Our research indicated that the crystallization of Si3N4 interfacial phase was essential to obtain a high hardness in the Ti-Si-N composite films, and the strengthening mechanism of the composite films appeared to be the same as TiN/Si3N4 multilayered films.",

        "abstract": "The superhardness effect of Ti-Si-N nanocomposite films is closely related to the thickness of the interfacial phase, Si3N4. The influence of the thickness of Si3N4 on the growth structure and mechanical properties of Ti-Si-N nanocomposite films was determined by studying TiNSi3N4 multilayers with different thicknesses of Si3N4 layers to reveal the strengthening mechanism of the nanocomposite films. The results show that Si3N4, which is amorphous in single film, can exist as a crystalline structure in TiNSi3N4 multilayers when the thickness of the Si3N4 layers is less than 0.7nm because of the \"template effect\" of TiN. As a result, TiN and Si3N4 layers form a coherent epitaxial growth with a preferred orientation. As a result, the multilayers exhibit a superhardness effect. When the thickness is greater than 0.7nm, Si3N4 exists as an amorphous structure and prevents TiN from coherent epitaxial growth with it, resulting in the decrease of the hardness and elastic moduli of the multilayers. The experiments reveal that when the thickness is less than 0.7nm, the Si3N4 interfacial phase in Ti-Si-N nanocomposite films may have the same structure as that in TiNSi3N4 multilayers. The strengthening mechanism of Ti-Si-N nanocomposite films may be the same as that of TiNSi3N4 nanomultilayers formed by the coherent epitaxial growth of two layers with different moduli. \u00a9 2005 American Vacuum Society.",

The results show that the Si3N4 layer thickness has great influence on the microstructure and mechanical properties of TiN/Si3N4 nanomultilayers. Because of the template effect of TiN, Si3N4 can form crystalline structure when Si3N4 layer thickness is less than 0.7 nm. Then the crystals can promote the growth of TiN, which results in that the film forms epitaxial coherent superlattice. Correspondingly, the hardness and elastic modulus of the films are obviously enhanced and reach the maximum values of 34.0 and 352 GPa, respectively. When its thickness is larger than 1.3 nm, Si3N4 exists as amorphous structure and prevents TiN from epitaxial coherent growth, which decreases the hardness and elastic modulus of the multilayers. In conclusion, Ti-Si-N composite films have the same strengthening mechanism as the super-hard nanomultilayers consisting of two modulation layers with different modulus.",

The TiN/Si3N4 nano-multilayers were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and nano-indentation. The results show that the layer thickness of Si3N4 and TiN significantly affects the microstructures and mechanical properties of the multilayer. For example, when Si3N4 layer thickness is less than 0.7 nm, TiN layer induces an epitaxial growth and re-crystallization of amorphous Si3N4, which results in considerable increases of the hardness and elastic modulus of the multilayer, whose maximum values can reach 34.0 and 353.5 GPa, respectively. When Si3N4 layer is thicker than 1.3 nm, only amorphous Si3N4 was observed on top of the TiN layer and the mechanical properties of the multilayer markedly deteriorates.

The microstructure and properties of the film were studied with energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoindentor. It is found that the Si content can be well controlled by adjusting SiH4 partial pressure. The film hardness increases with Si content ranging from 4 at% to 9 at%, but gradually decreases as Si content goes higher than 9 at%. The maximum hardness and elastic modulus are estimated to be 34.2 GPa and 398 GPa respectively. The microstructure of the high hardness samples were found to consist of TiN nanocrystal grains, 20 nm in diameter, surrounded by Si3H4 interphase of a thickness of 1 nm.",

        "abstract": "The signal processing for a GPS receiver is composed of the signal acquisition, the tracking, and the navigation. The goal of the acquisition is to synchronize the code phase and a carrier frequency with the income signal for a particular satellite. For the algorithm of GPS signal acquisition, the previous GPS acquisition scheme adopted not only the coherent integration acquisition technique, but also the non-coherent integration technique. Since the long coherent integration time increases the number of frequency search cells, while the non-coherent integration technique causes the squaring loss. Because of the effect of estimated Doppler frequency error and estimated code phase error on the non-coherent integration technique, this paper proposed an efficient MIMU/GPS embedded integrated navigation system to aid GPS signal non-coherent integration acquisition scheme. Expressions of detection probability and false alarm probability about GPS signal acquisition were gained in this paper. And the method of MIMU to aid GPS signal non-coherent acquisition was presented. Finally, the paper analyzed the performance of MIMU/GPS aiding GPS signal non-coherent integration acquisition. The simulated result shows the precision of the estimated doppler frequency is better than 4 Hz. The result also shows based on MIMU/GPS integrated navigation aiding, the performance of GPS signal non-coherent integration acquisition can be improved greatly.",

The approach is proved to be an effective and practical way to prevent navigation error buildup and effectively improve the long time accuracy of the inertial navigation system (INS). Based on the measurement error model of IMU, the principle of single-axis rotation modulation technique (RMT) and the effect of vehicle yaw motion on rotation modulation are analyzed theoretically. Aiming at the problem that vehicle yaw motion decreases the effectiveness of rotation modulation technique, a method of driving rotation table is proposed based on yaw attitude algorithm of vehicle.

However, the errors of rotation platform will be introduced into SINS and might affect the final navigation accuracy. Considering the disadvantages of the conventional navigation computation scheme, an improved computation scheme of the SINS using rotation technique is proposed which can reduce the effects of the rotation platform errors. And, the error characteristics of the SINS with this navigation computation scheme are analyzed. Theoretical analysis, simulations and real test results show that the proposed navigation computation scheme outperforms the conventional navigation computation scheme, meanwhile reduces the requirement to the measurement accuracy of rotation angles. \u00a9 Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.",

Firstly, the principle of single-axis RMT was expounded based on the measurement error model of inertial measurement unit (IMU). Then, the effects of vehicle angle motion upon RMT were analyzed theoretically. Error equation of equivalent gyroscopic bias in navigation frame was derived. Finally, the simulation and wobble tests were performed. The results show that the average effect of the RMT is negated by vehicle level angle motion; the more the angle amplitude and speed, the more inefficient of RMT, thus, the performance of INS is in low. It can serve as the reference for INS performance analysis and inertial sensors selection of single-rotating INS.",

Simulations show that the proposed algorithm is widely suitable for the various areas with different geomagnetic characters,and is robust to the initial errors in position,velocity and attitude.

Defining the initial body frame as the inertial frame, the IFBA method achieves the alignment by virtue of a cascade of low-pass FIR filters, which attenuate the disturbing acceleration and maintain the gravity vector. The aligning time rests with the orders of the FIR filter group, and the method is suitable for large initial misalignment case. An alignment scheme comprising a coarse phase by the IFBA method and a fine phase by a Kalman filter is presented. Both vehicle-based and ship-based alignment experiments were carried out. The results show that the proposed scheme converges much faster than the traditional method at no cost of precision and also works well under any large initial misalignment.",

These errors can induce large biases in the gyroscope, which can directly affect the accuracy of attitude estimation in the integration of the inertial navigation system (INS) and the Global Positioning System (GPS). The observability determines the existence of solutions for compensating them. In this paper, we investigate the observability of the INS/GPS system with consideration of the g-sensitivity errors. In terms of two types of g-sensitivity coefficients matrix, we add them as estimated states to the Kalman filter and analyze the observability of three or nine elements of the coefficient matrix respectively. A global observable condition of the system is presented and validated. Experimental results indicate that all the estimated states, which include position, velocity, attitude, gyro and accelerometer bias, and g-sensitivity coefficients, could be made observable by maneuvering based on the conditions. Compared with the integration system without compensation for the g-sensitivity errors, the attitude accuracy is raised obviously.",

The results of 16 aligning experiments show that the algorithm achieves the alignment precision of 0.03\u00b0 (1\u03c3 ) in azimuth and >0.005\u00b0 (1\u03c3 ) in horizontal, and the alignment time is variable. The maneuverability of the vehicle is improved by the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Navigation plays a vital role in our daily life. As traditional and commonly used navigation technologies, Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) can provide accurate location information, but suffer from the accumulative error of inertial sensors and cannot be used in a satellite denied environment. The remarkable navigation ability of animals shows that the pattern of the polarization sky can be used for navigation. A bio-inspired POLarization Navigation Sensor (POLNS) is constructed to detect the polarization of skylight. Contrary to the previous approach, we utilize all the outputs of POLNS to compute input polarization angle, based on Least Squares, which provides optimal angle estimation. In addition, a new sensor calibration algorithm is presented, in which the installation angle errors and sensor biases are taken into consideration. Derivation and implementation of our calibration algorithm are discussed in detail. To evaluate the performance of our algorithms, simulation and real data test are done to compare our algorithms with several exiting algorithms. Comparison results indicate that our algorithms are superior to the others and are more feasible and effective in practice.",

In order to investigate the formation of gel propellant drops at the end of a capillary tube, the Navier-Stokes equations were solved, and the VOF (volume of fluid) method is employed to track the gas/liquid interface during process of drop formation. The variation of dimensionless neck diameter DN/D0 and dimensionless drop height L/D0 with time was analyzed, which agreed with the existing experimental results and validated the numerical model. The results show that drop is not always at the steady state; there is high shear rate at the drop neck, leading to dynamic viscosity decreasing and drop pinch-off; then drop pinch-off, the part of conjoint drop, coalesces into drop rapidly, and high positive velocity appears; however, the part of conjoint capillary tube coalesces into gel propellant at the end of capillary tube rapidly, and the high negative velocity appears.",

In practical application, the motions of SINS may be within certain fixed frequency range, and the system coning errors are mainly generated by these motions. In this paper, based on the classical coning algorithms formula, the design criterion of classic algorithms is modified and two new algorithms optimization principles are added to match the fixed frequency motion. The obtained optimal coning algorithm has the minimized point in the specified frequency band and is no longer monotonic. So the system attitude accuracy can be improved effectively. The new algorithm not only does not change the formation of classic algorithms, but also does not complicate the algorithms realization. The error analysis and attitude simulations illustrate that the optimization coning algorithms can increase the attitude calculation accuracy 1~2 orders higher for the motions with specified frequency.",

Algorithms for estimating parameters of the polarized light based on three images are derived and the optimal alignments of the polarizer are analyzed. The least-squares estimation is introduced for sky light polarization pattern measurement. The polarization patterns of sky light are obtained using the designed system and they follow almost the same patterns of the single-scattering Rayleigh model. Deviations of polarization angles between observation and the theory are analyzed. The largest deviations occur near the sun and anti-sun directions. Ninety percent of the deviations are less than 5\u00b0 and 40% percent of them are less than 1\u00b0. The deviations decrease evidently as the degree of polarization increases. It also shows that the polarization pattern of the cloudy sky is almost identical as in the blue sky.",

        "abstract": "Skylight polarization provides a significant navigation cue for certain polarization-sensitive animals. However, the precision of the angle of polarization (AOP) of skylight for vehicle orientation is not clear. An evaluation of AOP must be performed before it is utilized. This paper reports an evaluation of AOP of skylight by measuring the skylight polarization patterns of clear and cloudy skies using a full-sky imaging polarimetry system. AOP measurements of skylight are compared with the pattern calculated by the single-scattering Rayleigh model and these differences are quantified. The relationship between the degree of polarization (DOP) and the deviation of AOP of skylight is thoroughly studied. Based on these, a solar meridian extracted method is presented. The results of experiments reveal that the DOP is a key parameter to indicate the accuracy of AOP measurements, and all the output solar meridian orientations extracted by our method in both clear and cloudy skies can achieve a high accuracy for vehicle orientation.",

An improved correlation matching method based on the contour constraint is proposed.Map contour is used to confine the searching process,changing the uncertainty field to an uncertainty line,which efficiently reduces the computation burden of the system and eliminates the initial position error of INS.A nearest point principle (NPP) is applied in the precision matching part.The NPP technique can bind the error of INS accumulated during the matching process.The simulation results show that the proposed method can greatly improve the efficiency and precision of the whole GAN system. The accuracy of the matching method is less than the unit cell size of the map.In addition,the proposed method is,to some extend,adaptive to the heading error of the INS.",

        "abstract": "Most partial Fourier (PF) approaches use a low-resolution phase estimate in the reconstruction to account for non-zero phases of the image. These methods may fail when there are large phase errors, a situation commonly encountered in T(*)(2)-weighted functional MRI (fMRI). To mitigate this problem, a method was developed based on the inversion of a matrix formulated according to a phase map derived from iterative reconstruction. To make this method computationally practical for fMRI, a strategy was introduced such that the matrix inversion is performed only once for each slice in the time series, assuming that the phase map remains constant in the time series. To ensure the temporal phase invariance, physiological noise correction and global phase correction were applied to the data before the reconstruction. This method was demonstrated to be robust and efficient for fMRI. Magn Reson Med 46:1045-1048, 2001.",

The present work demonstrates that high-resolution EPSI can be used to derive structural images for applications in which spectroscopic information is beneficial. These applications are chemical shift (fat-water) imaging, narrow bandwidth imaging, and T2* mapping.

However, the currently used gadolinium (Gd) chelates, such as Gd-DTPA, restrict the time window for image acquisition due to their rapid elimination from blood and their rapid diffusion into the extravascular space, which prevents their use in steady-state imaging, particularly for MR angiography (MRA). The goal of this study was to prepare long-circulating polyethylene glycol-bearing ((PEG)ylated) liposomes encapsulating Gd chelate, and characterize and demonstrate their utility for MRA. The liposomes were prepared by hydrating a mixture of lipids with gadodiamide (Omniscan). The liposomes were sized down to around 100 nm by extruder and exhaustively dialysed to remove the unencapsulated gadodiamide. The Gd liposomes exhibited a significant sustained (>4 hr) contrast enhancement of the vasculature with improved spatial details in a rat model with little leakage relative to Gd-DTPA controls as shown by MRI. We suggest that such long-circulating liposomal formulations allow for high spatial resolution imaging without the confounding effects of clearance and extravascular diffusion of the agent complicating the data and image analysis.",

Spikes in the collected fMRI raw data often arise from high-duty usage of the scanner hardware and can introduce significant noise in the image and thereby in the image time series. Consequently, the spikes will corrupt the functional data and degrade the result of functional mapping. In this work, a simple method based on processing the time course of the k-space data are introduced and implemented to remove the spikes in the acquired data.

Magnetic field inhomogeneities induced by susceptibility differences, as encountered in the human body, increase with the magnetic field strength, thus, complicating implementation of high resolution EPI techniques on high magnetic field systems. These problems were overcome by using a fast multishot high resolution EPI method that uses variable flip angles, center-out k-space sampling, and navigator echoes. This approach maximizes signal-to-noise ratio, reduces flow artifacts, and permits correction of intersegment amplitude and phase variations, providing high spatial and temporal resolution. This scheme can be implemented with a single magnetization preparation for contrast that precedes the segments. The utility of this ultrafast segmented EPI technique with navigator is demonstrated for anatomic and functional imaging studies on the human brain at 4 T.",

To investigate this issue, we acquired gradient-echo (GE) BOLD and cerebral blood volume (CBV)-weighted fMRI data in anesthetized cats during visual stimulation at 4.7T and 9.4T, before and after injection of a superparamagnetic contrast agent (monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles, MION), respectively. In BOLD fMRI, large positive changes in both magnitude and phase were observed predominantly in the cortical surface area, where the large draining veins reside. In CBV-weighted fMRI, large negative changes in both magnitude and phase were detected mainly in the middle cortical area, where the greatest CBV change takes place. Additionally, the phase change was temporally correlated with the magnitude response and was linearly dependent on the echo time (TE), which cannot be explained by the intravascular (IV) contribution and functional temperature change. Phase changes with the opposite polarity were also observed in the regions around the dominant phase changes. These phase changes can be explained by the application of the \"Lorentz sphere\" theory in the presence of relevant activation-induced changes in vessels. The volume-averaged magnetization and its demagnetization are the main sources of fMRI signal phase change.",

Such a response is consistent with optical imaging data and can be potentially mapped to generate spatially more specific maps. However, there are still controversies regarding the exact origin of the initial response. In particular, experimental reports of its echo-time dependence have been inconsistent. Furthermore, several investigators have suggested the possibility of an apparent dip that may arise artifactually when the interstimulus interval (ISI) is not sufficiently long. The present study investigates the echo-time dependence of the initial response and the effect of the ISI on the initial response. Experimental results obtained at TEs of 21, 30, and 45 msec demonstrate that the initial dip has a TE dependence that is in agreement with a T2* contrast, and thereby consistent with a blood oxygenation level-dependent origin. At an ISI of 90 sec, a statistically significant initial negative response was detected and shown to be indistinguishable from that observed at an ISI of 45 sec, which was used in our previous studies, indicating that the initial negative response observed at 4 T is not a consequence of short ISI.",

        "abstract": "Functional neuroimaging in the human brain using noninvasive magnetic resonance methods has the potential of providing highly resolved maps of neuronal activation. Decreasing the voxel size and obtaining simultaneously high temporal resolution is a major challenge and is mainly limited by sensitivity. Here, signal-to-noise gains at high magnetic fields (7 Tesla) and an optimized surface coil setup are combined with a novel approach for zoomed functional imaging in the visual cortex. For echoplanar imaging, the acquisition time and segmentation was shortened fourfold by using a reduced field-of-view. An adiabatic outer-volume suppression method, BISTRO, was used to obliterate signal outside the area-of-interest achieving effective suppression even for inhomogeneous B1-fields. A single-shot acquisition was performed at submillimeter resolution in the human brain, while simultaneously maintaining a high temporal resolution of 125 ms. Functional studies with and without field-of-view reduction were performed. Activation and percent change maps were compared with respect to spatial extent, t values and percentage changes of the BOLD contrast. The detection of functional activation was found to be equal within the inter-series variability for the two acquisition schemes. Thus, single-trial BOLD responses were detected for the first time robustly at a 500 x 500 microm2 in plane and 250 ms temporal resolution, significantly expanding the possibilities of event-related functional imaging in the human brain. The magnetization transfer effect induced by the outer-volume suppression pulses was investigated and found to be increased during neuronal activity.",

        "abstract": "In agreement with optical imaging studies, previous fMRI studies have reported an initial decrease (i.e. the initial dip) in the BOLD response, which is believed to arise from an increase in oxygen consumption and to be mostly microvascular. To date, experimental studies of the initial dip in humans have been performed at fields up to 4 T, with relatively low spatial resolution. Because the sensitivity to microvascular contribution is increased at high magnetic fields, the present study investigated the initial dip at 7 T. In addition, to reduce the partial volume effect, the study is conducted at a high spatial resolution. The initial dip was detected in all subjects studied and was found to reside mostly in the gray matter. The relative amplitude of the early response was found to be 0.6, higher than that at 4 T (0.3) and 1.5 T (0.11). In addition, based on the assumption that the initial dip is a result of increased oxygen utilization, the fractional change in oxygen utilization was estimated to be 40% of that of the fractional change in cerebral blood flow. These results are in agreement with the notion that the initial dip arises from an increase in oxygen consumption.",

Here, we demonstrate and characterize a robust sustained negative BOLD response (NBR) in the human occipital cortex, triggered by stimulating part of the visual field. The NBR was spatially adjacent to but segregated from the PBR. It depended on the stimulus and thus on the pattern of neuronal activity. The time courses of the NBR and PBR were similar, and their amplitudes covaried both with increasing stimulus duration and increasing stimulus contrast. The NBR was associated with reductions in blood flow and with decreases in oxygen consumption. Our findings support the contribution to the NBR of (1) a significant component of reduction in neuronal activity and (2) possibly a component of hemodynamic changes independent of the local changes in neuronal activity.",

        "abstract": "Cortico-cortical projections for visual processing that originate from the striate cortex are organized into two streams. The dorsal stream projects to the parietal region and the ventral stream to the inferior temporal region. One hypothesis is that the dorsal stream processes visual spatial information, and the ventral stream processes visual object information. Although recognition of human faces or common objects has been shown preferentially to activate the ventral stream, the issue of when such processing starts to engage the ventral or the dorsal stream is not clear. The question explored in this study is whether processing of visual form per se without evoking the brain mechanisms that are associated with recognition of human faces or common objects is sufficient to activate the ventral stream more significantly relative to the condition when only visual spatial processing is involved. Functional magnetic resonance images were acquired while subjects performed a delayed comparison task in which either visual spatial or visual form information was processed. Cortical areas that were preferentially activated in visual spatial or visual form processing showed not only ventral-dorsal segregation, but also hemispheric laterality. The results extended previous findings by showing that preferential activation in the ventral pathway is not contingent upon such powerful stimuli as faces and common objects. Processing of simple visual form information is cause enough for such activation to be observed. A strong left hemisphere dominance in visual form recognition was also revealed. The observed laterality may be a reflection that the left hemisphere is more important in symbolic and/or semantic coding of visual form information.",

Obtaining functional CBF maps with high spatial resolution is a major challenge because the CBF signal is intrinsically low and the SNR is critical. In the present work, CBF-based functional imaging was performed at a considerably smaller voxel size than previously reported in humans. High-resolution CBF maps were obtained with voxel sizes as small as 0.9 x 0.9 x 1.5 mm(3) in the human brain. High sensitivity was made possible by signal-to-noise gains at the high magnetic field of 7 T and by using a novel RF combination coil design. In addition, a reduction of the field-of-view was critical to achieve 0.9-mm in-plane resolution with gradient-echo echo-planar imaging in a single shot. Functional CBF data were compared with functional BOLD data to reveal that, for CBF, large contrast- to-noise gains were obtained at high spatial resolution, indicating that the functional CBF response was more localized. High-resolution functional CBF imaging is significant for neuroscience research because it provides better localization and more specific information than BOLD for monitoring brain function.",

        "abstract": "Most functional magnetic resonance imaging studies use linear models to predict the measured response by convolution of an impulse response with the stimulus profile. Using very short visual presentation times (<2 s), deviation from the linear model in the measured BOLD data from the human brain was found for the response integral, amplitude, and width. In this study, high temporal and spatial resolution were used to quantify nonlinear effects and investigate the spatial dependence. Data at 4 Tesla showed at short stimulus duration a nonlinearity, i.e., deviation from a linear model, with an index up to 400%, whereas data at 7 Tesla exhibited a nonlinearity index up to 40%. The effect was more pronounced for response amplitude than for response area. A reduced width and sharpening of responses at shorter stimulus duration was also found. A voxel-based analysis of 7 Tesla data with 1.2 x 1.2 x 2 mm(3) resolution revealed a correlation between response onset and nonlinearity index. This suggests that the nonlinearity effects are a tissue-specific phenomenon and are likely to be more localized to the site of neuronal activity. The observed magnetic field dependence and the demonstrated nonlinearity in the response width support the hypothesis that the source of the nonlinearity at short stimulus duration has a considerable hemodynamic contribution. The nonlinearity was modeled as a \"switch\"-type initial hemodynamic response onset. Understanding these nonlinearities in the BOLD response is important for design and the analysis of rapid event-related fMRI experiments with brief stimulus presentations.",

        "abstract": "In the past decade, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research has been focused on the acquisition of physiological and biochemical information noninvasively. Probably the most notable accomplishment in this general effort has been the introduction of the MR approaches to map brain function. This capability, often referred to as functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, is based on the sensitivity of MR signals to secondary metabolic and hemodynamic responses that accompany increased neuronal activity. Despite this indirect link to neurotransmission, recent studies demonstrate that under appropriate conditions, these fMRI maps have accuracy at the scale of submillimeter neuronal organizations such as the orientation columns of the visual cortex, and are directly proportional in magnitude to electrical signals generated by the neurons. High magnetic fields have been critical in achieving such specificity in functional maps because they provide advantages through increased signal-to-noise ratio, diminishing blood-related contributions to mapping signals, and enhanced sensitivity to microvasculature. Equally important is MR spectroscopy studies, which, at high magnetic fields, provide for the first time the opportunity to measure local metabolic correlates of human brain function and neurotransmission rates. Together, these MR methods provide a complementary set of approaches for probing important aspects of the nervous system",

First, a modified receiver operating characteristic analysis is described for evaluating the accuracy of fMRI studies. With this modified approach, the true positives or the activated pixels are estimated based on highly averaged experimental data acquired with the same stimulation/task. Unlike ROC analysis based on simulated activation data, the present approach can be applied to experimentally acquired data without simplifying the activation related changes. To assess the reliability of fMRI studies, the kappa statistic was adopted for evaluating the overall agreement of functional activation maps from repeated experiments in individual subjects. To demonstrate the utility of these techniques, both the ROC analysis and the reliability assessment were applied to quantitatively evaluate the improvement in accuracy and reliability of a retrospective technique for physiological noise reduction in fMRI.",

        "abstract": "Over the past 20 years much attention has been given to characterizing the spatial accuracy of fMRI based signals and to techniques that improve on its co-localization with neuronal activity. While the vast majority of fMRI studies have always used the conventional positive BOLD signal, alternative contrast options have demonstrated superior spatial specificity. One of these options surfaced shortly after the initial BOLD fMRI demonstrations and was motivated by optical imaging studies which revealed an early signal change that was much smaller but spatially more specific than the delayed positive response. This early signal change was attributed to oxygenation changes prior to any subsequent blood flow increases. After observation of this biphasic hemodynamic response in fMRI, because this early response resulted in a small MR signal decrease prior to the onset of the large signal increase, it became known as the \"initial dip\". While the initial dip in fMRI was subsequently reported by many studies, including those in humans, monkeys, and cats, there were conflicting views about the associated mechanisms and whether it could be generalized across brain regions or species, in addition to whether or not it would prove fruitful for neuroscience. These discrepancies, along with the implications that the initial dip might increase the spatial specificity of BOLD fMRI from 2 to 3mm to something more closely associated with neural activity, resulted in lot of buzz and controversy in the community for many years. In this review, the authors provide an account of the story of the initial dip in MR based functional imaging from the Minnesota perspective, where the first demonstrations, characterizations, and applications of the initial dip commenced.",

These studies also raised the possibility of improving the specificity of fMRI by selective mapping of this early response. Previous MR studies reported the observation of this early response but were limited in scope and not in full agreement. This paper presents a more extensive study that (a) demonstrates the initial signal decrease in individual subjects and (b) examines its dependence on stimulus duration and subject. Binocular visual stimulation experiments were performed on 14 subjects using echo-planar imaging (EPI) with high temporal resolution. An initial signal decrease was consistently observed in regions that were more localized than those displaying the delayed positive response. In agreement with previous fMRI and optical imaging findings, the maximum signal decrease was 1-2% and occurred at approximately 2 s after the onset of the stimulus, depending on the subject. For stimulus longer then 3.0 s, the temporal dynamics and the amount of signal change of the early response was essentially independent of the stimulus duration, while the delayed response and the post-stimulus undershoot increased both in terms of magnitude and rise time as the duration of the stimulus increased; this observation is concordant with the recent optical imaging study.",

For a given accelerated dataset, the selection of the measured data points for fitting a missing datum (i.e., the kernel support) that provides optimal reconstruction depends on coil array configuration, noise level in the acquired data, imaging configuration, and number and position of autocalibrating signal lines. In this work, cross-validation is used to select the kernel support that best balances the conflicting demands of fit accuracy and stability in GRAPPA reconstruction. The result is an optimized tradeoff between artifacts and noise. As demonstrated with experimental data, the method improves image reconstruction with GRAPPA. Because the method is simple and applied in postprocessing, it can be used with GRAPPA routinely.",

Still unknown, however, is the precise relationship between neural activity, the hemodynamic response and fluctuations in the MRI signal. Recent work from several groups had shown that correlated low-frequency fluctuations in the BOLD signal can be detected in the anesthetized rat \u2014 a first step toward elucidating this relationship. Building on this preliminary work, through this study, we demonstrate that functional connectivity observed in the rat depends strongly on the type of anesthesia used. Power spectra of spontaneous fluctuations and the cross-correlation-based connectivity maps from rats anesthetized with \u03b1-chloralose, medetomidine or isoflurane are presented using a high-temporal-resolution imaging sequence that ensures minimal contamination from physiological noise. The results show less localized correlation in rats anesthetized with isoflurane as compared with rats anesthetized with \u03b1-chloralose or medetomidine. These experiments highlight the utility of using different types of anesthesia to explore the fundamental physiological relationships of the BOLD signal and suggest that the mechanisms contributing to functional connectivity involve a complicated relationship between changes in neural activity, neurovascular coupling and vascular reactivity.",

DTI data were obtained with and without FLAIR in six normal volunteers. The application of FLAIR was experimentally demonstrated to lead to a consistent increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) in gray-matter regions, which was attributed to suppressed partial volume effects from CSF. In addition to these experimental results, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to ascertain the effect of noise on the measured FA under the experimental conditions of this study. The experimentally observed effect of noise was corroborated by the simulation, indicating that the increase in the measured FA was not due to a noise-related bias but to an actual increase in diffusion anisotropy. This enhanced measurement of diffusion anisotropy can be potentially used to differentiate directionally dependent structure and tracking fibers in gray matter.",

With the use of an appropriate echo combination strategy, the sequence can provide signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement while maintaining the advantages of parallel EPI. Simulations and in vivo experiments demonstrate that a weighted summation of multiecho images provides a significant gain in SNR over the first echo image. It is experimentally demonstrated that this SNR gain can be utilized to reduce the number of measurements often required to ensure adequate SNR for accurate DTI measures. Furthermore, the multiple echoes can be used to derive a T(2) map, providing additional information that might be useful in some applications.",

        "abstract": "We propose a method for preprocessing event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data that can lead to enhancement of template-free activation detection. The method is based on using a figure of merit to guide the wavelet shrinkage of a given fMRI data set.Several previous studies have demonstrated that in the root-mean-square error setting, wavelet shrinkage can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI time courses. However, preprocessing fMRI data in the root-mean-square error setting does not necessarily lead to enhancement of template-free activation detection. Motivated by this observation, in this paper, we move to the detection setting and investigate the possibility of using wavelet shrinkage to enhance template-free activation detection of fMRI data.The main ingredients of our method are (i) forward wavelet transform of the voxel time courses, (ii) shrinking the resulting wavelet coefficients as directed by an appropriate figure of merit, (iii) inverse wavelet transform of the shrunk data, and (iv) submitting these preprocessed time courses to a given activation detection algorithm. Two figures of merit are developed in the paper, and two other figures of merit adapted from the literature are described.Receiver-operating characteristic analyses with simulated fMRI data showed quantitative evidence that data preprocessing as guided by the figures of merit developed in the paper can yield improved detectability of the template-free measures. We also demonstrate the application of our methodology on an experimental fMRI data set.The proposed method is useful for enhancing template-free activation detection in event-related fMRI data. It is of significant interest to extend the present framework to produce comprehensive, adaptive and fully automated preprocessing of fMRI data optimally suited for subsequent data analysis steps.",

        "abstract": "Many of the statistical methods currently employed to analyze fMRI data depend on a response template. However, the true form of the hemodynamic response, and thereby the response template, is often unknown. Consequently, cluster analysis provides a complemen- tary, template-free method for exploratory analysis of multidimensional fMRI data sets. Clustering algo- rithms currently being applied to fMRI data separate the data into a predefined number of clusters (k). A poor choice of k will result in erroneously partitioning well-defined clusters. Although several clustering al- gorithms have been successfully applied to fMRI data, techniques for statistically testing cluster separation are still lacking. To address this problem we suggest a method based on Fisher's linear discriminant and the bootstrap. Also introduced in this paper is a measure based on the projection of multidimensional data from two clusters onto the vector, maximizing the ratio of the between- to the within-cluster sums of squares. The resulting one-dimensional distribution may be readily visualized and used as a heuristic for estimat- ing cluster homogeneity. These methods are demon- strated for the self-organizing maps clustering algo- rithm when applied to event-related fMRI data. \u00a9 2002",

        "abstract": "Commonly used methods in analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, such as the Student's t-test and cross-correlation analysis, are model-based approaches. Al- though these methods are easy to implement and are effective in analyzing data obtained with simple paradigms, they are not applicable in situations in which patterns of neuronal response are complicated and when fMRI response is unknown. In this work, Kohonen's self-organizing mapping (SOM), which is a model-free approach, is adapted for analyzing fMRI data. Be- cause spatial connectivity is an important function in the identification of activation sites in functional brain imaging, it is incorporated into the SOM algorithm. Receiver operating charac- teristic analysis on simulated data shows that the new algorithm achieves measurable improvement over the standard algorithm. The applicability of the new algorithm is demonstrated on experimental data. Magn Reson Med 41:939-946, 1999. r 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc. In the last several years, a significant advance in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been the development of an MRI method for the noninvasive mapping of human corti- cal function without using exogenous contrast agents (1-3). The basis for this technique is the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast (4), derived from the fact that deoxyhemoglobin acts as an endogenous paramag- netic contrast agent (5). Therefore, changes in the local concentration of deoxyhemoglobin within the brain lead to alterations in the magnetic resonance (MR) signal. Neuro- nal activation within the cerebral cortex leads to an increase in blood flow without a commensurate increase in oxygen extraction (6). Consequently, capillary and venous deoxyhemoglobin concentrations decrease. This is re- flected as a local increase in T2* and T2, leading to an elevation in signal intensity in corresponding regions of T2*- and T2-weighted MR images (1-3). Such a correlation between neuronal activities and MR signal changes enables a variety of functional brain studies. Among these studies are those of the motor area (1,7), language (8,9), auditory cortex (10), somatosensory cortex (11), memory (12,13) and attention (14). In a typical fMRI study, T2*-weighted images of the brain are acquired while the subject alternates between perform- ing a designated task and being subjected to a certain stimulation and a control condition. Subsequently, local- ized signal differences between the resting and activation periods are identified and are used to reveal the localized neuronal activation associated with the task. The detection of the fMRI response is not a trivial process, because the response usually is very small (a few percent), and its exact form is generally unknown. Currently, the most widely used methods for analyzing fMRI data are based on ex- plicit, prior knowledge regarding the activation time course and, thereby, the MRI response. For example, when the response is approximately stepwise, a Student's t test can be applied to detect localized changes that are statistically significant (15). A more general approach is based on calculating the correlation between an assumed form of MRI response and the measured imaging data for each pixel and then using the correlation coefficient as a thresh- old to distinguish between activated pixels and nonacti- vated pixels (15,16). These techniques have been quite successful with simple block-design paradigms in which the neuronal response is assumed to be on/off and the hemodynamic response is known. However, these tech- niques are not appropriate for studies in which the re- sponse is unknown or differential temporal responses are expected. Examples of these more sophisticated studies include temporally resolved studies (17,18), single-trial experiments (19), and memory studies in which sustained response is expected (13). These emerging studies are becoming more and more widespread with technical devel- opment in data acquisition and improvement in imaging",

As a result, several categories of template-free data analysis techniques have been introduced in the fMRI literature. One previously described template-free activation detection technique is based on the feature that activated voxels yield reproducible time course patterns as the subject undergoes the same simulation in repeated epochs. In this paper, spatial information is incorporated as a second feature and a combined univariate measure is formed. The resulting method is shown to offer measurable improvement in detecting activation regions in simulated data in a highly computationally efficient manner.

Several figures of merit are described and used to find appropriate values for the coefficients in the linear combination. Using receiver-operating characteristic analysis on simulated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data sets, we quantify and validate the improved performance of the integrated measure over the spectral density measure based on the fundamental frequency as well as over some other popular template-free data analysis methods.

We implemented a simple method for BOLD and perfusion fMRI with high spatial resolution and specificity. Increased spatial resolution was achieved by selectively excit- ing a slab of interest along the phase-encoding direction for EPI, resulting in a reduced FOV and number of phase-encoding steps. Improved spatial specificity was achieved by using SE EPI acquisition at high fields, where it is predominantly sensi- tive to signal changes in the microvasculature. Robust SE BOLD and perfusion fMRI were obtained with a nominal in-plane res- olution up to 0.5 0.5 mm2 at 7 and 4 Tesla, and were highly reproducible under repeated measures. This methodology en- ables high-resolution and high-specificity studies of functional topography in the millimeter to submillimeter spatial scales of the human brain.

        "abstract": "The Hahn spin-echo (HSE)-based BOLD effect at high magnetic fields is expected to provide functional images that originate exclusively from the microvasculature. The blood contribution that dominates HSE BOLD contrast at low magnetic fields (e.g., 1.5 T), and degrades specificity, is highly attenuated at high fields because the apparent T(2) of venous blood in an HSE experiment decreases quadratically with increasing magnetic field. In contrast, the HSE BOLD contrast is believed to arise from the microvasculature and increase supralinearly with the magnetic field strength. In this work we report the results of detailed and quantitative evaluations of HSE BOLD signal changes for functional imaging in the human visual cortex at 4 and 7 T. This study used high spatial resolution, afforded by the increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of higher field strengths and surface coils, to avoid partial volume effects (PVEs), and demonstrated increased contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and spatial specificity at the higher field strengths. The HSE BOLD signal changes induced by visual stimulation were predominantly linearly dependent on the echo time (TE). They increased in magnitude almost quadratically in going from 4 to 7 T when the blood contribution was suppressed using Stejskal-Tanner gradients that suppress signals from the blood due to its inhomogeneous flow and higher diffusion constant relative to tissue. The HSE signal changes at 7 T were modeled accurately using a vascular volume of 1.5%, in agreement with the capillary volume of gray matter. Furthermore, high-resolution acquisitions indicate that CNR increased with voxel sizes < 1 mm(3) due to diminishing white matter or cerebrospinal fluid-space vs. gray matter PVEs. It was concluded that the high-field HSE functional MRI (fMRI) signals originated largely from the capillaries, and that the magnitude of the signal changes associated with brain function reached sufficiently high levels at 7 T to make it a useful approach for mapping on the millimeter to submillimeter spatial scale.",

However, the topographic and geometric relationships between diffusion imaging derived streamline fiber connection patterns and cortical folding patterns remain largely unknown. This paper specifically identifies and characterizes the U-shapes of diffusion imaging derived streamline fibers via a novel fiber clustering framework and examines their co-localization patterns with cortical sulci based on DTI, HARDI, and DSI datasets of human, chimpanzee and macaque brains. We verified the presence of these U-shaped streamline fibers that connect neighboring gyri by coursing around cortical sulci such as the central sulcus, pre-central sulcus, post-central sulcus, superior temporal sulcus, inferior frontal sulcus, and intra-parietal sulcus. This study also verified the existence of U-shape fibers across data modalities (DTI/HARDI/DSI) and primate species (macaque, chimpanzee and human), and suggests that the common pattern of U-shape fibers coursing around sulci is evolutionarily-preserved in cortical architectures.",

However, the macroscale intrinsic relationship between these 2 general cross-species attributes, as well as the underlying principles that sculpt the architecture of the cerebral cortex, remains unclear. Here, we show that the axonal fibers connected to gyri are significantly denser than those connected to sulci. In human, chimpanzee, and macaque brains, a dominant fraction of axonal fibers were found to be connected to the gyri. This finding has been replicated in a range of mammalian brains via diffusion tensor imaging and high-angular resolution diffusion imaging. These results may have shed some lights on fundamental mechanisms for development and organization of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that axonal pushing is a mechanism of cortical folding.",

        "abstract": "Evolution of the brain has been an inherently interesting problem for centuries. Recent studies have indicated that neuroimaging is a powerful technique for studying brain evolution. In particular, a variety of reports have demonstrated that consistent white matter fiber connection patterns derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography reveal common brain architecture and are predictive of brain functions. In this paper, based on our recently discovered 358 dense individualized and common connectivity-based cortical landmarks (DICCCOL) defined by consistent fiber connection patterns in DTI datasets of human brains, we derived 65 DICCCOLs that are common in macaque monkey, chimpanzee and human brains and 175 DICCCOLs that exhibit significant discrepancies amongst these three primate species. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations not only demonstrated the consistencies of anatomical locations and structural fiber connection patterns of these 65 common DICCCOLs across three primates, suggesting an evolutionarily preserved common brain architecture but also revealed regional patterns of evolutionarily induced complexity and variability of those 175 discrepant DICCCOLs across the three species.",

        "abstract": "Assessment of structural connectivity patterns of brains can be an important avenue for better understanding mechanisms of structural and functional brain architectures. Therefore, many efforts have been made to estimate and validate axonal pathways via a number of techniques, such as myelin stain, tract-tracing and diffusion MRI (dMRI). The three modalities have their own advantages and are complimentary to each other. From myelin stain data, we can infer rich in-plane information of axonal orientation at micro-scale. Tract-tracing data is considered as 'gold standard' to estimate trustworthy meso-scale pathways. dMRI currently is the only way to estimate global macro-scale pathways given further validation. We propose a framework to take advantage of these three modalities. Information of the three modalities is integrated to determine the optimal tractography parameters for dMRI fibers and identify cross-validated fiber bundles that are finally used to construct atlas. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework by a collection of experimental results.",

        "abstract": "In clinical neuroscience, task-based fMRI (tfMRI) is a popular method to explore the brain network activation difference between healthy controls and brain diseases like Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (PAE). Traditionally, most studies adopt the general linear model (GLM) to detect task-evoked activations. However, GLM has been demonstrated to be limited in reconstructing concurrent heterogeneous networks. In contrast, sparse representation based methods have attracted increasing attention due to the capability of automatically reconstructing concurrent brain activities. However, this data-driven strategy is still challenged in establishing accurate correspondence across individuals and characterizing group-wise consistent activation maps in a principled way. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-stage sparse coding framework to identify group-wise consistent networks in a structured method. By applying this novel framework on two groups of tfMRI data (healthy control and PAE), we can effectively identify group-wise consistent activation maps and characterize brain networks/regions affected by PAE.",

Radial convolutions exhibit homology across primate species and generally are easily identified in individuals of the same species. In contrast, circumferential convolutions vary across species as well as individuals of the same species. However, systematic study of circumferential convolution patterns is lacking. To address this issue, we utilized structural MRI (sMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) data from primate brains. We quantified cortical thickness and circumferential convolutions on gyral banks in relation to axonal pathways and density along the gray matter/white matter boundaries. Based on these observations, we performed a series of computational simulations. Results demonstrated that the interplay of heterogeneous cortex growth and mechanical forces along axons plays a vital role in the regulation of circumferential convolutions. In contrast, gyral geometry controls the complexity of circumferential convolutions. These findings offer insight into the mystery of circumferential convolutions in primate brains.",

To this end, numerous connectome projects have been initiated to create a comprehensive map of the connectional anatomy over a large spatial expanse. Tractography based on diffusion MRI (dMRI) data has been used as a tool by many connectome projects in that it is widely used to visualize axonal pathways and reveal microstructural features on living brains. However, the measures obtained from dMRI are indirect inference of microstructures. This intrinsic limitation reduces the reliability of dMRI in constructing connectomes for brains. In this work, we proposed a framework to increase the accuracy of constructing a dMRI-based connectome on macaque brains by integrating meso-scale connective information from tract-tracing data and micro-scale axonal orientation information from myelin stain data. Our results suggest that this integrative framework could advance the mapping accuracy of dMRI based connections and axonal pathways, and demonstrate the prospect of the proposed framework in constructing a large-scale connectome on living primate brains.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that quantitative description of gyral shape patterns offers a novel window to examine the relationship between brain structure and function. Along this research line, this paper examines a unique and interesting type of cortical gyral region where 3 different gyral crests meet, termed 3-hinge gyral region. We extracted 3-hinge gyral regions in macaque/chimpanzee/human brains, quantified and compared the relevant DTI-derived fiber densities in 3-hinge and 2-hinge gyral regions. Our observations consistently showed that DTI-derived fiber densities in 3-hinge regions are much higher than those in 2-hinge regions. Therefore, we hypothesize that besides the cortical expansion, denser fiber connections can induce the formation of 3-hinge gyri. To examine the biomechanical basis of this hypothesis, we constructed a series of 3-dimensional finite element soft tissue models based on continuum growth theory to investigate fundamental biomechanical mechanisms of consistent 3-hinge gyri formation. Our computational simulation results consistently showed that during gyrification gyral regions with higher concentrations of growing axonal fibers tend to form 3-hinge gyri. Our integrative approach combining neuroimaging data analysis and computational modeling appears effective in probing a plausible theory of 3-hinge gyri formation and providing new insights into structural and functional cortical architectures and their relationship.",

        "abstract": "Discovery and representation of common structural and functional cortical architectures has been a significant yet challenging problem for years. Due to the remarkable variability of structural and functional cortical architectures in human brain, it is challenging to jointly represent a common cortical architecture which can comprehensively encode both structure and function characteristics. In order to better understand this challenge and considering that macaque monkey brain has much less variability in structure and function compared with human brain, in this paper, we propose a novel computational framework to apply our DICCCOL (Dense Individualized and Common Connectivity-based Cortical Landmarks) and HAFNI (Holistic Atlases of Functional Networks and Interactions) frameworks on macaque brains, in order to jointly represent structural and functional connectome-scale profiles for identification of a set of consistent and common cortical landmarks across different macaque brains based on multimodal DTI and resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) data. Experimental results demonstrate that 100 consistent and common cortical landmarks are successfully identified via the proposed framework, each of which has reasonably accurate anatomical, structural fiber connection pattern, and functional correspondences across different macaque brains. This set of 100 landmarks offer novel insights into the structural and functional cortical architectures in macaque brains.",

        "abstract": "It is largely unknown whether there is functional role difference between cortical gyral and sulcal regions. Recent advancements in neuroimaging studies demonstrate clear difference of structural connection profiles in gyral and sulcal areas, suggesting possible functional role difference in these convex and concave cortical regions. To explore and confirm such possible functional difference, we design and apply a powerful deep learning model of convolutional neural networks (CNN) that has been proven to be superior in learning discriminative and meaningful patterns on fMRI. By using the CNN model, gyral and sulcal fMRI signals are learned and predicted, and the prediction performance is adopted to demonstrate the functional difference between gyri and sulci. By using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) fMRI data and macaque brain fMRI data, an average of 83% and 90% classification accuracy has been achieved to separate gyral/sulcal HCP task fMRI signals at the population and individual subject level respectively; 81% and 86% classification accuracy for resting state fMRI signals at the group and individual subject level respectively. In addition, 78% classification accuracy has been achieved to separate gyral/sulcal resting state fMRI signals in macaque brains. Importantly, further analysis reveals that the discriminative features that are learned by CNNs to differentiate gyral/sulcal fMRI signals can be meaningfully interpreted, thus unveiling the fundamental functional difference between cortical gyri and sulci. That is, gyri are more global functional integration centers with simpler lower frequency signal components, while sulci are more local processing units with more complex higher frequency signal components.",

In the current study, we report functional neuroimaging observations of these effects in exposed youth. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we embedded task-irrelevant emotional distracters in a working memory task to examine the interaction of emotional arousal and memory in 33 PCE and 23 non-exposed adolescents. Though with similar behavioral performance, the two groups exhibited different activation patterns associated with emotion-memory interactions. On the one hand, higher memory load attenuated emotion-related amygdala activation in controls but not in the exposed adolescents; on the other hand, prefrontal activation associated with memory load decreased in the presence of emotional distraction in the controls but increased in the exposed group. These group interaction differences suggest neurobiological substrates for arousal-associated neuronal alterations related to prenatal cocaine exposure. Consistent with previous findings in behavioral and physiological studies, the present neuroimaging data provided more in-depth evidence supporting the view that PCE has significant long-term teratogenic effect on arousal regulation system.",

However, the neurobiological bases of these teratogenic effects have not been well characterized. Because activities in the default mode network (DMN) reflect intrinsic brain functions that are closely associated with arousal regulation and cognition, alterations in the DMN could underlie cognitive effects related to PCE. With resting-state and task activation functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study investigated the possible PCE related changes in functional brain connectivity and brain activation in the DMN. In the resting state, the PCE group was found to have stronger functional connectivity in the DMN, as compared to the nonexposed controls. During a working memory task with emotional distracters, the PCE group exhibited less deactivation in the DMN and their fMRI signal was more increased by emotional arousal. These data revealed additional neural effects related to PCE, and consistent with previous findings, indicate that PCE may affect behavior and functioning by increasing baseline arousal and altering the excitatory/inhibitory balancing mechanisms involved in cognitive resource allocation.",

        "abstract": "While behavioral studies have established that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can result in diminished arithmetic processing capability, the underlying neural correlates of this deficit are still unclear. The aim of the present study was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine the effect of PAE on neuronal activation during a subtraction task.Participants were young adults from a low socio-economic status population who were identified prenatally; the sample consisted of healthy unexposed controls (n = 17) and PAE who were subdivided based on the presence (n = 19) or absence of physical dysmorphic signs (n = 18). Multiple regression analysis was used to determine extent of activation and percent signal change during arithmetic processing, using a letter-matching task as the baseline. Region of interest analysis of activation was performed in the native space and normalized for each individual to compensate for the considerable variability in head size observed in the alcohol-exposed population.An exposure-dependent response was observed in task performance and neuronal activation. Dysmorphic PAE individuals showed significantly lower task-related performance and activation in regions known to be associated with arithmetic processing, including left superior and right inferior parietal regions and medial frontal gyrus, while the nondysmorphic PAE group was generally intermediate but not significantly different from the control group in task performance and activation.Results indicate that there is a range of effects of PAE on arithmetic processing and that the severity of this deficit may be dependent on degree of impairment demonstrated by the exposed individual. Evidence of physical dysmorphia may be indicative of functional damage to regions associated with arithmetic calculation, resulting in markedly impaired neuronal recruitment.",

Given the relationship between default mode network (DMN) activity and task-related attentional modulation, it is possible that PAE affects activity of this network. In the present study, task-related deactivation as well as structural and resting state functional connectivity of the DMN were examined using diffusional tensor imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging in non-dysmorphic and dysmorphic PAE populations and compared to healthy controls. The dysmorphic PAE group was found to have reduced DMN deactivation as compared to controls, indicating poorer attentional modulation during the cognitive task. Additionally, structural connectivity and baseline functional connectivity were lower in both PAE groups as compared to controls. Primarily the findings suggest that learning problems seen with PAE may be a combination of general attentional and specific cognitive deficits. A secondary implication is that DMN activity is affected to varying extents depending on the degree of PAE.",

With related behavioral data documented in literature, further investigation of this PAE effect would benefit from integrating functional and anatomical imaging data to ascertain its neurobiological basis. The current study investigated the possible functional and anatomical bases for the PAE-related visual sustained attention deficit. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected while the subjects performed a sustained visual attention task. High resolution, three dimensional anatomical images were also collected for morphometric evaluation. In the alcohol-affected subjects, we observed a significant white and gray matter volume reduction in the occipital-temporal area. Meanwhile, their fMRI activations in the same region resided more superiorly than that of the controls resulting in reduced activation in the ventral occipital-temporal area. The location of this PAE functional abnormality approximately matches that of the significant structural reduction. In addition to the well documented corpus callosum abnormalities observed in PAE subjects, the present results reveal a teratogenic effect on the occipital-temporal area. Furthermore, as the occipital-temporal area plays an important role in visual attention, the current observation suggests a neurobiological underpinning for the PAE related deficit in sustained visual attention.",

        "abstract": "Objective  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an idiopathic and fatal neurodegenerative disease of the human motor system. While microstructural alterations in corpus callosum (CC) have been identified as a consistent feature of ALS, studies directly examining interhemispheric neural connectivity are still lacking. To shed more light on the pathophysiology of ALS, the present study aims to examine alterations of interhemispheric structural and functional connectivity in individuals with ALS.  Methods  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (rfMRI) data were acquired from 38 individuals with ALS and 35 gender-matched and age-matched control subjects. Indices of interhemispheric functional and structural neural connection were derived with analyses of voxel mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) and probabilistic fibre tracking.  Results  The rfMRI has revealed extensive reductions of VMHC associated with ALS in brain regions of the precentral and postcentral gyrus, the paracentral lobule, the superior temporal gyrus, the middle cingulate gyrus, the putamen and the superior parietal lobules. With DTI, the analysis has also revealed reductions of interhemispheric structural connectivity through the CC subregions II, III and V in patients with ALS. Additionally, interhemispheric functional connectivity of the bilateral precentral gyri positively correlated with fractional anisotropy values of the CC subregion III, which structurally connects the bilateral motor cortices.  Conclusions  The present data provided direct evidence confirming and extending the view of impaired interhemispheric neural communications mediated by CC, providing a new perspective for examinations and understanding the pathophysiology of ALS.",

However, due to a lack of dense and corresponding cortical landmarks across individuals, the systematical alterations of functional connectivities in large-scale brain networks and the alteration of structural brain architecture in PCE affected brain are largely unknown. In this article, we adopted a newly developed data-driven strategy to build a large set of cortical landmarks that are consistent and corresponding across PCE adolescents and their matched controls. Based on these landmarks, we constructed large-scale functional connectomes and applied the well-established approaches of deriving genomics signatures in genome-wide gene expression studies to discover functional connectomics signatures for the characterization of PCE adolescent brains. Results derived from experimental data demonstrated that 10 structurally disrupted landmarks were identified in PCE, and more importantly, the discovered informative functional connectomics signatures among consistent landmarks distinctively differentiate PCE brains from their matched controls.",

This paper describes two pieces of our work related to the resting state dynamics. We assume the resting-state brain to be in quasi-static states with spontaneous switching between them. First, we apply a hidden Markov model to the resting state fMRI data and derive model parameters reflecting the states. With this approach, we identified 9 reproducible states, which resemble resting state networks described in the literature. The second piece of work is the dynamic parcellations of thalamus, leading the state specific parcellations and their merged results, both of which revealed new insights about the thalamic function and connectivity.",

        "abstract": "Cervical dystonia (CD) is a neurological disorder with typical symptoms of involuntary and abnormal movements and postures of the head. CD-associated alterations of functional brain networks have not been well characterized. Previous studies of CD using resting-state functional MRI (rfMRI) are limited in two aspects: (i) the analyses were not directly focused on the functional brain network related to head movement and (ii) rfMRI measurements other than functional connectivity (FC) were not investigated. The present study examined alterations of FC in CD by capitalizing on newly identified brain regions supporting isometric head rotation (Prudente et al.: J Neurosci 35 (2015) 9163-9172). In addition to FC, which only reflects inter-regional signal synchronization, local, or intraregional alterations were also examined using rfMRI measurements of the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations and regional homogeneity (ReHo). Finally, with alterations of different rfMRI measures identified, a support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm was implemented for group classification. The results revealed both inter- (FC) and intra-regional (ReHo) alterations extensively distributed in both cortical and subcortical structures; and common alterations of these measures were identified bilaterally in the postcentral gyrus as well as in the basal ganglia and thalamus. Of the rfMRI features examined, seven of them (four FC and three ReHo measures) survived the SVM procedure of recursive feature elimination and together provided the highest group classification accuracy of 90.6%. The present findings extend previous studies of rfMRI in CD and offer insight into the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder in relation to network dysfunction and somatosensory disturbances.

However, precise information on neural changes mediating this association has been lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we undertook an analysis to test if the neural consequences of excess basal ganglia  glutamate  increases could be profiled using a composite multimodal imaging approach. A data-driven classifier was used to divide a sample of 41 subjects diagnosed with major  depression  into two groups \u2013 a high plasma  CRP /high  glutamate  groups ( n \u00a0=\u00a022) with low plasma  CRP /low  glutamate  subgroup ( n \u00a0=\u00a019). Freesurfer was used to measure morphological alterations and AFNI was used to measure synchronized local neural activity and connectivity of basal ganglia to other brain regions. The high  CRP /high  glutamate  group demonstrated decreased left putamen volume in the context of decreased synchronized neural activity in the basal ganglia and decreased connectivity between ventral striatal-ventromedial prefrontal regions. The neural changes were mapped to behavioral impairments including psychomotor slowing and  anhedonia . The combination of above findings predicted high  CRP /high  glutamate  status with high accuracy (sensitivity\u00a0u003e\u00a080%, specificity\u00a0u003e\u00a080%). We propose that excessive, disarrayed, chaotic signaling induced by an unregulated excess of inflammation-induced  glutamate  in the basal ganglia might underlie above findings. Identifying neural footprints of  glutamate  dysregulation induced by inflammatory activation will be discussed.",

In this work, we sought to provide a gene expression marker for MRI based on bacterial magnetosomes, tiny magnets produced by naturally occurring magnetotactic bacteria. Specifically, magA, a gene in magnetotactic bacteria known to be involved with iron transport, is expressed in a commonly used human cell line, 293FT, resulting in the production of magnetic, iron-oxide nanoparticles by these cells and leading to increased transverse relaxivity. MRI shows that these particles can be formed in vivo utilizing endogenous iron and can be used to visualize cells positive for magA. These results demonstrate that magA alone is sufficient to produce magnetic nanoparticles and that it is an appropriate candidate for an MRI reporter gene.",

        "abstract": "This work demonstrates an alternative approach, termed off-resonance saturation (ORS), for generating contrast that is sensitive to superparamagnetic particles. This method leads to a calculated contrast that increases with superparamagnetic nanoparticle concentration. Experimental data demonstrate that in the presence of superparamagnetic particles, an off-resonance effect exists that is distinct from the magnetization transfer (MT) effect and is highly dependent on diffusion. Data show that the dependence on water diffusion becomes most significant at rates of 0.5 x 10(-9) m(2)/s and slower. We investigated the dependence of the off-resonance effect on off-resonance frequency and particle concentration. The data suggest a useful frequency offset range of 500 Hz < |Deltaomega| < 1500 Hz at 3T. This approach may be especially useful in organs and diseases in which diffusion may be altered by pathologies.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the effect of coating thickness on the relaxivity of iron oxide nanoparticles. Materials and Methods: Monocrystalline superparamag- netic iron oxide nanoparticles (MIONs), coated with a poly- ethylene glycol (PEG)-modified, phospholipid micelle coat- ing, with different PEG molecular weights, were prepared. The particle diameters were measured with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electron microscopy (EM). The R1 and R2 of MIONs were measured using a bench-top nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometer. pH was varied for some measurements. Monte Carlo simulations of proton movement in a field with nanometer-sized magnetic inho- mogeneities were performed. Results: Increasing the molecular weight of the PEG portion of the micelle coating increased overall particle diameter. As coating thickness increases, the R2 decreases and the R1 increases. Changing pH has no effect on relaxivity. The Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the effect of coating size on R2 relaxivity is determined by two competing factors: the physi- cal exclusion of protons from the magnetic field and the res- idence time for protons within the coating zone. Conclusion: Coating thickness can significantly impact the R2, and the R2/R1 ratio, of a MION contrast agent. An understanding of the relationship between coating proper- ties and changes in relaxivity is critical for designing mag- netic nanoparticle probes for molecular imaging applica- tions using MRI.",

Results show that the wear rate of MoSi_2 is obviously decreased by oil lubrication and the three friction couples have much excellent friction and wear properties under 150N.In this experiment,the wear rate of 45 tempering steel and 45 quenching steel under oil lubrication are much bigger than that under dry friction,but to CrWMn steel,the increase of wear rate is much small.According to the characteristics of the opponents,the dominant wear mechanism of MoSi_2 under oil lubrication is different.When against 45 tempering steel with the lowest hardness,the wear mechanism of MoSi_2 changes from intercrystalline fracture under 50N,fatigue fracture under 80N to mild adhesive wears under 150N.When against 45 quenching steel with the middle hardness,the wear mechanism of MoSi_2 is mainly adhesive wear.However,when against CrWMn steel with the highest hardness,the wear mechanism is transferred from adhesive wear under 50N to mild micro-plough under 150N,meanwhile,the wedge on the protruding tops of surface of CrWMn steel is formed.",

An adaptive filter based on the principle of least squares and regression model was designed, which was employed to remove the noise of an image and to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The defocus blurred image can be depicted by uniformly distributed function on circular support region, and the blur parameter of the function can be estimated using zeros position in blurred image in frequency domain. Finally, the method of counter-filter based simplified Wiener filter was applied to restore blurred image. Some experiments were performed to validate the performance of the algorithm, and the experimental results show that the approaches can obtain the good restoration effect in less computation time.",

By utilizing the modified nonlinear filters and a positive time-varying integral function, a smooth adaptive controller is designed via dynamic surface approach, where the compensating terms with the estimate of unknown bounds are employed to eliminate the effects of given continuous functions on a certain compact, unknown hysteresis and external disturbance. It is shown that all the resulting closed loop signals are semiglobally bounded, and the output tracking error converges to zero asymptotically. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.",

The defocus image can be depicted by uniformly distributed function on circular support region. Firstly, the Laplacian operator that is an isotropic second order differential arithmetic operator is employed to derive the defocus image, and the autocorrelation of the derived image is calculated by FFT. The blur parameter can be estimated as a half of the radius of the annular groove formed by the minus peaks of the autocorrelation image. Wiener filtering method is used first time to obtain the initial estimate of the target image, then, based on the initial estimate the spectral densities of the target image and noise image are estimated. Using this information, the Wiener filter is reconstructed and used to filter the defocus image again to obtain an improved result. The method has the advantages of high precision, less calculation task, and strong anti-interference capability. Some experiments were performed to validate the performance of this method, and experimental results show that the image restoration results are improved significantly compared with the results obtained by using traditional Wiener filters.",

        "abstract": "Dysregulation of autophagy in endothelial cells plays a vital role in cardiovascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Accumulating evidence shows that miRNAs regulate autophagy in various cell types by targeting autophagy-related genes. In the present study, we found that a co-culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs) inhibited autophagy activity in HUVECs. Furthermore, we isolated exosomes secreted by HAoSMCs, and confirmed that the exosomes contain miR-221/222. We investigated the role of miR-221/222 transferred by HAoSMC-derived exosomes in HUVECs. These exosomes induced an increase of miR-221/222 expression and a down-regulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) in HUVECs. Dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-221/222 could bind to the 3'UTR of PTEN, which implied that PTEN was a direct target of miR-221/222. The expression of PTEN could be down-regulated by miR-221/222 over-expression. Then, we detected the expression of PTEN, LC3, ATG5, SQSTM1/p62, Beclin-1, Akt, and phospho-Akt in HUVECs transfected with miR-221/222 mimics and inhibitors. Our results demonstrated that miR-221/222 overexpression inhibited the expression of PTEN and subsequently activated Akt signaling, and eventually down-regulated the expression of LC3II, ATG5 and Beclin-1, and elevated the expression of SQSTM1/p62. This phenomenon can be reversed by the transfection of miR-221/222 inhibitors. These data suggested that miR-221/222 from HAoSMC-derived exosomes inhibited autophagy in HUVECs by modulating PTEN/Akt signaling pathway.",

NADPH oxidase 1 deficiency reduces the incidence of aortic dissection induced by angiotensin II, but its mechanism remains to be further elucidated. The expression of Fibulin-5 is decreased in patients with AD, but its upstream mechanism is still unclear. This study was to clarify the relationship between NOX1 and Fibulin-5 in the AD. Results showed that the expressions of NOX1 and Fibulin-5 were increased and decreased in the AD, respectively. Next, by employing gain- and loss-of-function approaches in vitro, NOX1 negatively regulated Fibulin-5 in the vascular smooth muscle cells. Moreover, the blunted activity of NOX1 with VAS2870 could upregulate the expression of Fibulin-5. These findings indicate NOX1 is a negative modulator of Fibulin-5 in the AD.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Type A AAD, a serious cardiovascular emergency requiring urgent surgery, is the most common and serious AAD. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS4 in patients with type A acute aortic dissection (AAD). MATERIAL AND METHODS Immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR were used to evaluate the protein and mRNA expression levels of ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS4 in 14 type A acute aortic dissection (AAD) tissues and 10 control aortic tissues. Serum ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS4 expression levels in 74 patients with type A AAD, 36 patients with hypertension (HPT), and 34 healthy donors were examined by ELISA. The diagnostic value of serum ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS4 were determined by receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC). Furthermore, the dynamic change of serum ADAMTS1, ADAMTS4, D-dimer, and CRP were detected before and after surgery at different time-points in 14 patients with type A AAD. RESULTS ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS4 protein and mRNA expression levels were found to be significantly higher in 14 type A AAD tissues (p<0.0001) compared with 10 control tissues. Serum ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS4 levels were significant higher in patients with type A AAD than those in the HPT and HD group (p<0.0001 for both). The AUC value, sensitivity, and specificity of ADAMTS1 were 0.9710 (95% CI: 0.9429 to 0.9991), 87.84%, and 97.06%, respectively, and those of ADAMTS4 were 0.9893 (95% CI: 0.9765 to 1.002), 94.59%, and 97.06%, respectively. In addition, serum ADAMTS4 level was gradually decreased with the time extension after surgery, similar to D-dimer change. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that measurement of serum ADAMTS1 and ADAMTS4 levels could be potential diagnostic biomarkers for type A AAD, and ADAMTS4 might be a risk factor associated with type A AAD.",

        "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with variable clinicopathologic phenotypes and underlying neuropathologic mechanisms. Each clinical phenotype has a unique set of motor symptoms. Tremor is the most frequent initial motor symptom of PD and is the most difficult symptom to treat. The dentate nucleus (DN) is a deep iron-rich nucleus in the cerebellum and may be involved in PD tremor. In this study, we test the hypothesis that DN iron may be elevated in tremor-dominant PD patients using quantitative susceptibility mapping. Forty-three patients with PD [19 tremor dominant (TD)/24 akinetic rigidity (AR) dominant] and 48 healthy gender- and age-matched controls were recruited. Multi-echo gradient echo data were collected for each subject on a 3.0-T MR system. Inter-group susceptibility differences in the bilateral DN were investigated and correlations of clinical features with susceptibility were also examined. In contrast with the AR-dominant group, the TD group was found to have increased susceptibility in the bilateral DN when compared with healthy controls. In addition, susceptibility was positively correlated with tremor score in drug-naive PD patients. These findings indicate that iron load within the DN may make an important contribution to motor phenotypes in PD. Moreover, our results suggest that TD and AR-dominant phenotypes of PD can be differentiated on the basis of the susceptibility of the DN, at least at the group level.

This decrease was largest in the rostral and lateral portions of the neuromelanin volume, which were found to have more hypointensity in the T2 -weighted image and, presumably, higher iron content in the PD group. In addition, a larger decrease in fractional anisotropy was seen in the SN region of interest on the side contralateral to the side exhibiting more severe symptoms. These results indicate that the use of neuromelanin sensitive MRI to define the ROI in the SN for analyzing DTI data leads to more significant results, enhancing the robustness of DTI study and DTI based biomarkers of PD.

The effect of four commercial  strains (D254, VIC, BV818 and CECA) on volatile compounds of fermented pineapple ( L. Merr.) juice was investigated. Alcohols and esters were the most abundant groups in terms of the amounts of identified volatiles in four pineapple wines, followed by acids and sulphur compounds. Different  strains possess various capacities to release or synthesize volatiles during pineapple wine fermentation. For global aroma, strain D254 yielded the highest total number and concentration of volatiles and could be used as a starter culture for the making of intense pineapple wine. Strain BV818 produced wine with the highest amounts of volatiles with OAVs\u2009>\u20091 and scored the highest in global aroma. Thus, BV818 might be the appropriate strain that could impart characteristic aromas and enhance wine complexity. The relative content of esters formed by strain VIC was higher than that yielded by the other strains. Strain CECA produced the highest relative contents of alcohols, aldehydes and ketones. However, VIC and CECA were not ideal starter cultures because of their low sense scores. This study provided a foundation for the production of pineapple wine with the desired flavour profile.",

        "abstract": "Homoharringtonine (HHT), a natural plant alkaloid derived from Cephalotaxus, has demonstrated to have a broad antitumor activity and efficacy in treating human chronic myeloid leukemia. An alternative source is required to substitute for the slow-growing and scarce Cephalotaxus to meet the increasing demand of the drug market. The objective of this study was to screen HHT-producing endophytic fungi from Cephalotaxus hainanensis Li. By screening 213 fungal isolates obtained from the bark parts of Cephalotaxus hainanensis Li, one isolate was found to be capable of biosynthesizing HHT. The fungus was identified as Alternaria tenuissima by morphological characteristics and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analysis and was named as CH1307. HHT obtained from CH1307 was analyzed through the HPLC and LC-MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. The extract of the fermentation broth of CH1307 showed antiproliferative activities against K562 (chronic myelocytic leukemia), NB4 (acute promyelocytic leukemia), and HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia) human cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 67.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.26, 65.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.75, and 99.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.26\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively. The findings suggest that HHT-producing endophytic fungus, Alternaria tenuissima CH1307 might provide a promising source for the research and application of HHT. ",

        "abstract": "Nanocarrier mediated therapy of gliomas has shown promise. The success of systemic nanocarrier-based chemotherapy is critically dependent on the so-called leaky vasculature to permit drug extravasation across the blood-brain barrier. Yet, the extent of vascular permeability in individual tumors varies widely, resulting in a correspondingly wide range of responses to the therapy. However, there exist no tools currently for rationally determining whether tumor blood vessels are amenable to nanocarrier mediated therapy in an individualized, patient specific manner today. To address this need for brain tumor therapy, we have developed a multifunctional 100 nm scale liposomal agent encapsulating a gadolinium-based contrast agent for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging with prolonged blood circulation. Using a 9.4 T MRI system, we were able to track the intratumoral distribution of the gadolinium-loaded nanocarrier in a rat glioma model for a period of three days due to improved magnetic properties of the contrast agent being packaged in a nanocarrier. Such a nanocarrier provides a tool for non-invasively assessing the suitability of tumors for nanocarrier mediated therapy and then optimizing the treatment protocol for each individual tumor. Additionally, the ability to image the tumor in high resolution can potentially constitute a surgical planning tool for tumor resection.",

        "abstract": "Animal models offer a flexible experimental environment for studying atherosclerosis. The mouse is the most commonly used animal, however, the underlying hemodynamics in larger animals such as the rabbit are far closer to that of humans. The aortic arch is a vessel with complex helical flow and highly heterogeneous shear stress patterns which may influence where atherosclerotic lesions form. A better understanding of intra-species flow variation and the impact of geometry on flow may improve our understanding of where disease forms. In this work we use Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) and 4D Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) to image and measure blood velocity in the rabbit aortic arch. Measured flow rates from the PC-MRI were used as boundary conditions in computational fluid dynamics models of the arches. Helical flow, cross flow index (CFI) and time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) were determined from the simulated flow field. Both traditional geometric metrics and shape modes derived from statistical shape analysis were analyzed with respect to flow helicity. High CFI and low TAWSS were found to co-localize in the ascending aorta and to a lesser extent on the inner curvature of the aortic arch. The Reynolds number was linearly associated with an increase in helical flow intensity (R=0.85, p<.05). Both traditional and statistical shape analysis correlated with increased helical flow symmetry. However, a stronger correlation was obtained from the statistical shape analysis demonstrating its potential for discerning the role of shape in hemodynamic studies.",

The hazards of urban rail transit evaluation play important role in the urban rail transit risk analysis. However, lacking of guarantee of the source and assurance of the evaluation information, so the characteristics of hazard can hardly be quantized or always be in the context of uncertainty. Under such environment, an improved DS/AHP method is provided in this study for the evaluation of hazard source. Firstly, the identification and evaluation of urban rail transit hazard sources are proposed according to different methods. Secondly, the evaluation system analysis is provided from three aspects--- frequency, extent of damage and uncontrolled. Thirdly, the improved DS/AHP method is employed for risk evaluation to determine the order of different hazard sources. At last, a numerical example is provided for the hazard risk analysis to verify the feasibility of the method.",
