        "abstract": "Two single-layer, waterborne cool white coatings for building envelopes were recently developed for use in improving building energy efficiency. After the coatings were manufactured, their optical properties over the solar spectrum and their indoor temperature reduction effect were systematically investigated using appropriate tools, and the advantages/disadvantages of single layer cool white coatings over multilayer ones were discussed in detail. The preparation process enables these two coatings to integrate multiple cooling principles and thereby exhibit high solar heat reflectance and good indoor temperature reduction. The predicted industrial limit of solar heat reflectance for practical reflective cool white coatings is 0.91. Use of cool white coatings significantly reduces radiant heat flux. The temperature reduction effects evaluated by a self-developed device cannot describe adequately the indoor cooling performance of cool coatings. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the feasibility of positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET-CT)-guided (125)I seed implantation in the treatment of patients with refractory nasopharyngeal carcinoma after repeated traditional radiochemotherapy.Case series with chart review.University medical center.A total of 26 patients (18 men, 8 women; mean age, 51.3 \u00b1 10.8 years; totaling 53 lesions with an average diameter of 2.86 \u00b1 1.61 cm) were treated by PET-CT-guided (125)I seed implantation. All of the patients received a PET-CT scan 2 months after the treatment. Follow-up was conducted for ~2 to 43 months (median, 28.2 months) to observe the local control rate, overall survival rate, and clinical complications.The local control rates of refractory nasopharyngeal carcinoma after repeated traditional radiochemotherapy after 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months were 90.6% (48/53), 79.3% (42/53), 71.7% (38/53), 62.3% (33/53), and 56.6% (30/53), respectively. The overall 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were 87.2%, 71.3%, and 56.5%, respectively, with a median survival time of 28.2 months. Of all patients, 19.2% (5/26) died of local recurrence and 15.4% (4/26) died of metastases. One patient died of hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage, and another patient died from cachexia and infection. The long-term complications included hyperpigmentation at operative sites (n = 5), insensible feeling on the lateral cheek (n = 2), dryness of the oral cavity (n = 1), and headache (n = 1).PET-CT-guided (125)I seed implantation is an acceptable and feasible method for treating refractory nasopharyngeal carcinoma with minimal damage and few complications.",

The tumor location in the 8 patients was as follows: maxillofacial region (right, 2; left, 1), left maxillary sinus (1), right masticator space (1), left carotid space (1), right infratemporal fossa (1), and left parotid gland (1). All 5 patients who underwent CT demonstrated ill-defined soft masses and no calcification. Three patients with tumors in the maxillofacial region showed homogeneous small masses and a mild enhancement. The patient with left maxillary sinus tumor showed a heterogeneous mass with patchy, necrotic foci and mild heterogeneous enhancement. The patient with right masticator space tumor showed a heterogeneous mass, and marked heterogeneous enhancement. The T1-weighted images of the patients with right infratemporal fossa, left carotid space, and left parotid gland tumors were isointense. The T2-weighted images were heterogeneous and mildly hyperintense in 2 patients and hyperintense in 1 patient. Heterogeneous intermediate enhancement was demonstrated in 2 patients and mild ring enhancement in 1 patient.The imaging features of pPNET of the head and neck are non-specific. An ill-defined, aggressive mass and variable enhancement on CT and MR images may suggest the diagnosis of pPNET. Peripheral PNET should be included in the differential diagnosis of children and adolescents' regional tumors.",

Among the 7 patients, 5 patients had undergone CT scanning, 2 of which were also examined with FDG-PET/CT imaging, and 2 had undergone MRI. Unenhanced and contrast-enhanced examinations were performed in all patients, and 2 patients had also undergone dynamic CT contrast-enhanced examinations. Image characteristics, such as shape, size, number, edge, attenuation, and intensity of each lesion before and after contrast enhancement were analyzed and compared with the pathomorphology of the tumors.Multiple large masses in the abdominopelvis were detected in 6 cases, and a large mass in the pelvis was detected in 1 case. Six cases showed largest mass in pelvis, and 1 case in mesentery. None of the masses had a definite organ origin. CT showed soft tissue masses with patchy foci of hypodense areas. MR T1-weighted images revealed lesions with mild hypointense areas and patchy hypointense areas in 2 cases and lesions with patchy hyperintense areas in 1 case. T2-weighted images showed lesions with mixed isointense and hyperintense areas in 1 case and lesions with mixed hypointense, isointense, and hyperintense areas in another. Contrast-enhanced CT and T1-weighted images showed mildly heterogeneous enhancement of the lesions. Other associated findings included peritoneal seeding (n=3), peritoneal effusions (n=3), hepatic metastasis (n=2), bone metastasis (n=1), and mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (n=4). FDG-PET/CT showed multiple nodular foci of increased metabolic activity in the abdominopelvic masses, in the hepatic and right ilium in 1 case and foci of increased metabolic activity in the pelvic mass in another.Radiological findings of DSRCT include multiple masses with heterogeneous density/intensity and without an organ origin. Other common associated findings include peritoneal seeding, peritoneal effusion, hepatic metastasis, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. DSRCT should be considered in the differential diagnosis of regional tumors in adolescents and young adults. FDG-PET/CT can provide additional information on the stage of the tumor.",

        "abstract": "Background: Primary brain tumors have always been associated with high morbidity and mortality. Glioma is the most common type of malignant brain tumors, with a high probability of recurrence after surgical excision and with poor prognosis. The purpose of this study was to compare the therapeutic efficacy of CT (CT)-guided interstitial 125I seed implantation with traditional radiochemotherapy for treatment of recurrent gliomas. Results: The response rate at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after 125I seed implantation was 68.6, 74.3, 77.1 and 62.8% respectively, which was significantly higher than the group treated with the conventional chemoradiation protocol (p < 0.05). Patients exposed to 125I seed implantation had a median survival of 29.0 months, whereas the median survival of those treated with traditional radiochemotherapy was 19.0 months. The difference observed between the two groups was significant. There were no severe complications or mortality associated with either treatment, except for one case of intracerebral hemorrhage around the tumor area in the 125I seed implants group. Methods: From November 2002 to May 2010, 73 consecutive patients with recurrent gliomas were treated with CT-guided 125I seed implantation (35 cases) or traditional radiochemotherapy (38 cases). Patients were followed up after treatment and the therapeutic effect was evaluated by comparing the response and survival rates of the two groups. In particular, patients treated with 125I seed implantation were monitored for adverse side effects. Conclusions: CT-guided 125I seed implantation is safe and well-tolerated and more importantly, shows superior efficacy compared with conventional radiochemotherapy. This suggests that CT-guided 125I seed implantation could be an alternative approach for recurrent gliomas. \u00a9 2012 Landes Bioscience.",

HIFU ablation was applied to 38 cases. The diameter of tumors ranged from 1.5-18 cm, including < or =3 cm in seven cases, >3 to < or =5 cm in four cases, >5 to <10 cm in 15 cases, and > or =10 cm in 12 cases. Using imaging techniques, the volume and activity of tumors were observed before and after HIFU ablation, and the effectiveness of HIFU ablation in superficial malignant tumors was evaluated. For tumors < or =5 cm in diameter, HIFU ablation was completely effective in 100% (11/11) of cases; for tumors >5 cm in diameter, HIFU ablation was completely effective in 25.9% (7/27) of cases, partially effective in 14.8% (4/27) of cases, moderately effective in 33.3% (9/27) of cases; the disease remained stable in 14.8% (4/27) of cases and progressed in 11.1% (3/27) of cases. No significant difference was observed in the tumor volumes before (202.6 +/- 230.4 cm(3)) and 6-8 w after HIFU ablation (188.1 +/- 215.8 cm(3)). However, the difference in the active volume before (202.6 +/- 230.4 cm(3)) and after (127.6 +/- 189.7 cm(3)) HIFU ablation was statistically significant. Among 38 the cases, 32 reported painful symptoms, with a pain score of 4.39 +/- 2.36, before the ablation; the values dropped to 0.19 +/- 0.54 after HIFU, and the difference was statistically different.

Follow-up images showed that total effective rate in tumour response accounted for 72.8% in the TACE-HIFU group, which were significantly higher than that of TACE group (44.5%, P<0.05). The 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates for the TACE-HIFU group were 72.7%, 50.0%, 31.8% and 11.4%, respectively; correspondingly, for the TACE group were 47.2%, 16.7%, 2.8% and 0%, respectively (P<0.01). The 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year disease-free survival rates for the TACE-HIFU group were 34.1%, 18.2%, 9.1% and 0%, respectively; correspondingly, for the TACE group were 13.9%, 5.6%, 0% and 0%, respectively (P<0.01). TNM stage, portal vein tumour thrombosis and Child-Pugh classification each had a significant effect on the survival. HIFU ablation combined with TACE is safe, effective and a promising approach for the treatment of larger HCC.",

In this study, the safety and effects of HIFU in the clinical therapy of malignant bone tumors were assessed.Biochemical markers and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) were used to evaluate 25 patients with malignant bone tumors before and after HIFU treatment.HIFU resulted in significant improvement in biochemical markers, and no severe complications were observed. After HIFU treatment, 21 (87.5%) patients were completely relieved of pain, and 24 (100%) experienced significant relief. On the basis of MRI or PET-CT, HIFU was effective: For patients with primary bone tumors, 6 (46.2%) had a complete response, 5 (38.4%) had a partial response, 1 (7.8%) had a moderate response, and 1 suffered progressive disease; the response rate was 84.6%. For patients with metastatic bone tumors, 5 (41.7%) had complete response, 4 (33.3%) had partial response, 1 (8.3%) had a moderate response, 1 (8.3%) had stable disease, and 1 suffered progressive disease; the response rate was 75.0%.

The coagulation diameters achieved in different microwave ablation parameter groups were compared. Sixty patients (44 men, 16 women; mean age 53 years) with 96, 1-8 cm (mean 3.20 +/- 0.17 cm) liver cancers were treated with the same microwave ablation technique. Complete ablation (CA), local tumor progression (LTP) rates and complications were determined.In vivo livers, short axis diameter correlated with the coagulation duration in a sigmoidal curve fashion (60-W group R(2) = 0.76, 80-W group R(2) = 0.87), with a relative plateau achieved within 10 min for power settings of 60 or 80 W. Within 10 min in the 60 and 80-W groups, respectively, 89 and 85.76% of maximum short axis diameter were achieved. CA rates in small (3.0 cm), intermediate (3.1-5.0 cm) and large (5.1-8.0 cm) liver cancers were 96.43% (54/56), 92.31% (24/26) and 78.57% (11/14), respectively. During a mean follow-up period of 17.17 +/- 6.52 months, LTP occurred in five (5.21%) treated cancers. There was no significant difference in the CA and LTP rate between the HCC and liver metastasis patient subgroups (P > 0.05).The short axis diameter enlargement has a relative plateau within 10 min by fixing power output to 60 or 80 W, using the 2,450-MHz internally cooled-shaft antenna in vivo porcine livers. Effective local tumor control was achieved during one microwave ablation session.",

Methods: All cases were pathologically proved and the imaging appearances of askin tumors in 8 patients were reviewed retrospectively. All eight patients had plain chest films, 7 patients had chest CT scans, 1 patient had chest MR imaging and 4 patients had bone scintigraphy. Results: Chest wall soft tissue masses were demonstrated in all 8 cases. 4 cases were on the left side and 4 cases on the right. 6 large masses were heterogeneous on CT scan and 2 small masses were homogeneous on CT scan or MR imaging. There were cystic and necrotic areas in 4 cases on CT scan. Rib destructions were demonstrated in 6 cases. Four cases were demonstrated on CT scan, 1 case on MR imaging and 3 cases were demonstrated increased activities on bone scintigraphy among of them. Pleural effusions were demonstrated in 6 cases. The interfaces between lung and tumor were irregular in 7 cases and regular in 1 case. There was no calcification in all 8 cases. Conclusion: The imaging feature of askin tumor is chest wall soft tissue mass, however it is non-specific. Askin tumor should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis when a chest wall mass is identified in children and young adults.",

The following factors were used to define and contour BBTV, including dose-deficient area locating at skull-base of gross tumor volume in conventional irradiation, hypoxia area detected by (99m)Tc-HL91 Single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPET/CT) imaging and tumor-burdened area evaluated by comparing the pre-treatment and 36 Gy irradiation's CT images scanning at the same treatment position.The volume of BBTV was (17 \u00b1 7) cm(3), accounting for 51% \u00b1 19% of gross tumor volume. In BBTV, the volumes and proportion of skull base dose-deficient, hypoxia and tumor-burdened area were (5.8 \u00b1 2.5) cm(3), (7.7 \u00b1 3.6) cm(3), (9.0 \u00b1 5.8) cm(3) and 34.4%, 45.7% and 53.3% respectively.

        "abstract": "[Objective] To evaluate the dosimetric characters of conventional post-auricular portal (PAP), three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and split-filling and simultaneous boost irradiation (SF-SBI) techniques in radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with C-shaped extensive invasion of skull base, posterior cranial fossa and post-styloid parapharyngeal space, in order to provide optimal scheme for improvement of radiation treatment planning. [Methods] One patient pathologically diagnosed as NPC with extensive invasion of skull base and brain stem was eligible to this study. The enhanced CT image of the patient was transmitted into 3 dimensional treatment planning system. After routine 50 Gy irradiation for facio-cervical portal and facio-cervical mini-portal plus postcervical electronic portal, conventional PAP, 3DCRT, and improved SF-SBI scheme were applied respectively. Isodose curves were computed and dose volume histogram (DVH) was used to analyzed for the dosimetric characters of primary tumor\u2032s planning target volume (PTVnx) and organs at risk (OARs) in three plans. [Results] \u2460Either PAP, 3DCRT, and SF-SBI plan could obtain satisfied dose coverage of PTVnx (V95%, the ratio of PTVnx volume of 95% prescriptive dose coverage,was all higher than 98%);\u2461PAP plan had conspicuous high dose area, and V80 (the ratio of PTVnx volume accepted higher than 80Gy irradiation) was 59.4%. Both 3DCRT and SF-SBI plans could improve dose homogeneity to some extent, especially V80 of 3DCRT paln was only 1.1%.But more importantly, SF-SBI plan could give higher fractionation dose of 2.7Gy simultaneously boost irradiation to skull base which was located in lower dose coverage with routine 50 Gy irradiation. \u2462Irradiation to brain stem in both PAP and 3DCRT plans increased obviously.V60(the ratio of brain stem volume accepted higher than 60Gy irradiation) was high as 36.0% and 30.2%, respectively, and D33 (the maximum dose in 33% volume), was 61.0 Gy and 57.0 Gy, respectively. However, in SF-SBI plan, V60 and D33of brain stem were decreased to 15.1% and 55.5 Gy. The irradiated dose and volume to ipsolateral temporal lobe, temporo-mandibular joint, and middle ear were lowest in SF-SBI plan compared with the other two plans. [Conclusions] When planning for local advanced NPC with C-shaped target, SF-SBI technique could provide satisfied dose coverage and accepted dose homogeneity to PTVnx with significantly decreased irradiation to OARs such as brain stem. And more importantly, this technique could increase fractionation dose and total effective dose to skull base area. It remains to be further investigated for the rational fractionation dose of simultaneous boost irradiation, the optimized fields setup methods and whether to be applied at the planning beginning or not.",

        "abstract": "Evidence is accumulating that temporal lobe radiation necrosis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after radiotherapy (RT) could involve gray matter (GM). The purpose of the study was to assess the radiation-induced GM volume differences between NPC patients who had and had not received RT and the effect of time after RT on GM volume differences in those patients who had received RT.We used magnetic resonance imaging voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess differences in GM volume between 30 NPC patients with normal-appearing whole-brain GM after RT and 15 control patients with newly diagnosed but not yet medically treated NPC. Correlation analyses were used to investigate the relationship between GM volume changes and time after RT.Patients who had received RT had GM volume decreases in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right fusiform gyrus, right precentral gyrus, and right inferior parietal lobule (p\u2009<\u20090.001, uncorrected, cluster size >100 voxels). Moreover, the correlation analysis indicated that regional GM volume loss in the left superior temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, and right fusiform gyrus were negatively related to the mean dose to the ipsilateral temporal lobe, respectively.These results indicate that GM volume deficits in bilateral temporal lobes in patients who had received RT might be radiation-induced. Our findings might provide new insight into the pathogenesis of radiation-induced structural damage in normal-appearing brain tissue. Yet this is an exploratory study, whose findings should therefore be taken with caution.",

On plain MRI, 8 lesions were hypo-intense and 1 iso-intense on T1WI, while 6 displayed iso-intense, 1 hypo-intense and 2 slightly hyper-intense on T2WI. Necrosis was seen in 2 lesions. The peritumoral edema was mild in 5 lesions, moderate in 3 lesions, and severe in 1 lesion. On Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI, 4 lesions displayed obvious homogeneous mass-like enhancement, 3 lobular enhancement and 2 ring-like enhancement.Primary brain lymphoma in immunocompetent patients has typical MRI features.

        "abstract": "Preoperative staging is important for optimal therapy planning and prognosis prediction of rectal carcinoma. The role of conventional computed tomography (CT) in preoperative staging of rectal carcinoma is controversial. This study was to evaluate the value of multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) in preoperative staging of rectal carcinoma.From Mar. 2006 to Feb. 2007, 87 patients with pathologically proved rectal cancer underwent preoperative plain and enhanced MSCT. Two radiologists evaluated independently tumor location, size, the depth of tumor invasion into the rectal wall (T), the involvement of regional lymph nodes (N) and the presence of distant metastases (M) on CT images. TNM staging was made according to CT findings and compared with the pathologic results. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were assessed.All the 87 cases of rectal carcinoma were detected clearly by MSCT. The accuracy was 81.6% for TNM staging, 94.3% for T staging, 82.8% for N staging, and 98.9% for M staging. The sensitivity was 90.5% for T1-2 staging, 91.3% for T3 staging, and 97.7% for T4 staging. The specificity was 98.5% for T1-2 staging, 94.2% for T3 staging, and 97.7% for T4 staging. The sensitivity was 92.9% for N0 staging, 72.0% for N1 staging, and 82.4% for N2 staging. The specificity was 88.9% for N0 staging, 88.5% for N1 staging, and 91.7% for N2 staging. Only 1 case of distant metastasis was missed due to the liver lesion of less than 5 mm.MSCT is an accurate technique for preoperative staging of rectal carcinoma, which can assess the extension to adjacent tissues and the presence of lymph node and distant metastases exactly.",

        "abstract": "The soil sample of different vegetation restoration practices were surveyed from September in 2007 to August in 2008 in Shimenshan in Dalian. The nematodes were collected from the soil using elutriate-sieving-shallow pan method. The species richness, abundance, diversity index and ecological index were analyzed. A total of 8577 soil nematodes were collected, belonging to 2 classes, 7 orders, 26 families and 43 genera. The individual density was 4. 77 inds. per gram dry soil. The results indicated that the number of soil nematode fluctuated significantly with season, the number of soil nematode in autumn is significantly more than that in summer and in spring. Shannon-Wiener index, Pielou index, Margalef index and Trophic diversity index were used in analyzing the diversity of nematode community, ranking Cc > Pm > Clc, while Simpson index ranking Pm > Clc > Cc. The value of f/b, MI index, PPI index, MMI index, MI2-5 index, SI index and EI index were used in analyzing the characteristics of the functional structure of the nematode communities, ranking Cc > Pm > Clc, while PPI/MI value ranking Clc > Pm > Cc. It showed that the Clc was disturbed significantly. Soil physical and chemical characters were correlated significantly with the number of nematodes, the number of genera and ecological indices. Thus, we conclude that the dynamics of nematodes are an important biological indicator for vegetation restoration.",

        "title": "Responses of soil nematode communities to soluble salt contamination around Gangue hill in Fushun",
        "abstract": "Soluble salt contents and soil nematode communities were investigated to evaluate soil pollution dues to soluble salt contents in the secondary salinization plots around the Gangue hill of Fushun West open-pit mine in May, 2006. Six sampling sites were established along with the vertical direction to the Gangue hill between Tiantun and Qingtaizi, and site 1 was closest to the Gangue hill, while site 6 was the most distant to the hill. Annual herbs were more likely to distribute at sites that closer to Gangue hill, while perennial herbs became more and more common along with the increasing distance from the hill. The values of soil pH showed a increased trend from site 1 to site 6; the highest degree of mineralization, the highest contents of HCO- 3, Ca2+ and Mg2+ appeared at site 1. In contrast, the contents of Cl1and SO2- 4were higher at site 6 than those at other sites. Soil nematodes were extracted from soil samples by using elutriate-sieving-flotation and centrifugation methods, and were used as bioindicators for assessing soil quality in the present study. Nematode abundance, diversity indices (Shannon-Wiener diversity index H', Pielou evenness index J', Simpson dominance index \u03bb, trophic diversity index TD, specise richness SR), functional indices (Wasilewska index WI, maturity index MI), life history strategy (colonizer-persister), community structure and assemblage compositions were used to reveal the differences of soil nematode communities among different sites in this study area. The observed results showed that the environment in the sampling area was polluted by soluble sulfate which was a main production created by weathering of Gangue, but the degree of pollution was not very serious. In general, the soil was healthy in this area. Twenty - nine genera of nematodes were identified, Acrobeloides Cervidellus and Mesorhabtidis were the three most dominant genera at all sampling sites, and the dominant genera changed with the increasing distance to the Gangue hill. No significant differences in the values of \u03bb, H', MI and J' were aboserved among 6 sites. MI showed a trend which is in inversely proportional to the distance from Gangue hill. Both the highest values of WI, \u03bb and the lowest values of f/b, MI, J' appeared at site 6. The absolute abundances of bacterivores and plant-parasites nematodes were higher than those of fungivores and omnivore-predators, which suggesting bacterivorous and plant-parasitic nematodes were more diffuse than fungivores and omnivore-predators. Soil nematodes communities were altered by soil elements only apart from contents of CO2- 3, Mg2+ and Ca2+. The degree of mineralization and contents of HCO3 positively correlated with the number of species (S) and SR, and soil pH and content of NOM- 3 negatively correlated with nematode ecological indices. The content of Clpositively correlated with WI, but negatively with TD. The contents of SO4- significantly correlated with WI, \u03bb, J', f/b and TD. The above results indicate that the responses of nematode communities to soluble salt contamination are effective to monitor the soil environment quality and can provide scientific bases to promote the healthy development of soil ecosystems.",

        "abstract": "Mercury in environment has become the major concern in recent years due to its highly toxic to human and biota. In this study,nineteen sediment samples were collected along the Beijiang River to examine concentrations and sources of mercury,as well as methylmercury. Also,the pollution levels of mercury and its compound were assessed based on comparison with other studies. Total mercury(THg) and methylmercury(MeHg)were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy(AAS)and cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometers (CVAFS),respectively. Furthermore,methylation rates were calculated for all samples and pollution degrees of mercury in sediment were e-valuated using pollution index methods. The results showed that THg concentrations in sediments ranged from 73.7 to 3 517 ng\u00b7g-1 dry weight,with an average of 607.6 ng\u00b7g-1,and MeHg concentrations ranged from 0.392 to 2.384 ng\u00b7g-1 dry weight,with an average of 1.302 ng\u00b7 g-1,respectively. Clearly,wastewater from Shaoguan smelting factory was an important point source for mercury in sediment. In addition,methylation rates varied significantly among samples,suggesting that factors influencing methylation is still unclear. Thus,more studies are needed to explore the relationships between these important factors and methylation rates of mercury in sediment. Based on the average pollution index of THg(F=3.04)and MeHg(F=26.04)in sediment,the Beijiang River suffered from medium pollution of THg and MeHg.",

The results show that gas hydrate occupies the porosity among rock grains and enhances the cementation quality of sediment, which results in the acoustic velocity of gas hydrate increasing.

Through analysis on many NGH recovery methods, this study thought the depressurizing method was not proper because NGH was in solid with extremely low permeability in its original state; whereas the heat injection method was the first choice to extract NGH. This study divided the course of NGH being heated and decomposed into three stages in consideration of all the factors involving heat absorption in the formations during the whole process of the heat injection method, and then calculated the proportion between heat absorption and the total injected heat in each stage. The study results showed that a majority of thermal analysis was consumed by the increasing temperature of non-NGH and so it was essential to supply enough heat to extract NGH. Hereby two cheap and cost-effective heat sources were introduced to solve the problem of heat source supply.",

        "abstract": "The researches and development of the kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs) have attracted great attentions which aim at taking the place of the traditional thermal hydrate inhibitors. Polyvinylcaprolactan (PVcap) is one of the best KHIs found so far in industry. The researches on its mechanism, performance, laboratory appraisal method, formula, and the on-site application are of great importance. In this paper, the inhibition performance of PVcap solutions on methane hydrate was evaluated by using a high pressure stirring-tank reactor. Experiment results showed that in relatively low PVcap concentration range (e.g. less than 3%wt), the inhibition efficiency of PVcap solutions (added with other synergetic chemicals) increased with PVcap concentration. It also found that the performance of PVcap solutions (hydrate induction time) is not stable and is affected by many factors, such as stirring rate and sub-cooling. High stirring rate can reduce the effect of PVcap on hydrate inhibition. Moreover, PVcap's performance is also greatly affected by the degree of sub-cooling, the higher the degree of sub-cooling is, the shorter the hydrate induction time will be. However, the effect of PVcap on methane hydrate formation became insignificant when the degree of sub-cooling is over 10 \u2103.",

Refracturing technology is used to induce new fractures in different directions to increase fracture networks , thus raising productivity.The latest simultaneous fracturing technology is used to fracture two or more wells at once.With these fracturing techniques and laboratory and logging technologies available ,shale gas development will be even more promising.",

The storage capacity in such combined reservoirs can be assessed by a material balance method which considers different trapping states of CO 2 in oil reservoirs and aquifers. Case studies of five oil reservoirs selected from Shengli and Jiangsu oilfields in China are conducted and the results show that CO 2 storage capacity can be greatly increased if the lateral and underlying aquifers are included. Oil and water displacement and CO 2 dissolution in remaining oil are the main forms of CO 2 trapping in oil reservoirs, while CO 2 gas trapping and dissolution in saline water are the main mechanisms for CO 2 storage in associated aquifers. CO 2 injection into combined reservoirs can be a favorable option for the oil industry in the near future, and the potentials of CO 2 EOR and storage deserve further detailed studies.",

Through the mechanism of CO2 storage in saline aquifers research shows that the form of CO2 storage in saline aquifers was divided into free gas and irreducible gas. Through the application of CMG software to simulate the geological model, the results showed that the diffusion coefficient has a minimal impact on CO2 safe storage. When choose storage reservoir, high porosity, high permeability, low vertical and horizontal permeability ratio is the first choice. \u00a9 (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

At the same time, the wave velocity of reservoirs and a correlation of the Poisson ratio with the variance of hydrate saturation were quantitatively analyzed so as to obtain variation rules of mechanical properties of hydrate reservoirs with various microstructures as well as to analyze dynamical mechanisms of these microstructures. The acoustic diagnosis and Poisson ratio diagnosis of hydrate reservoir microstructures in different mineralization modes were carried out based on established physical models, and these diagnostic modes were also verified by comparing data of modeled reservoirs and real reservoirs.",

        "abstract": "The DF1-1 gas field, located in the western South China Sea, contains a high concentration of CO2, thus there is great concern about the need to reduce the CO2 emissions. Many options have been considered in recent years to dispose of the CO2 separated from the natural gas stream on the Hainan Island. In this study, the feasibility of CO2 storage in the lateral saline aquifer of the DF1-1 gas field is assessed, including aquifer selection and geological assessment, CO2 migration and storage safety, project design, and economic analysis. Six offshore aquifers have been investigated for CO2 geological storage. The lateral aquifer of the DF1-1 gas field has been selected as the best target for CO2 injection and storage because of its proven sealing ability, and the large storage capacity of the combined aquifer and hydrocarbon reservoir geological structure. The separated CO2 will be dehydrated on the Hainan Island and transported by a long-distance subsea pipeline in supercritical or liquid state to the central platform of the DF1-1 gas field for pressure adjustment. The CO2 will then be injected into the lateral aquifer via a subsea well-head through a horizontal well. Reservoir simulations suggest that the injected CO2 will migrate slowly upwards in the aquifer without disturbing the natural gas production. The scoping economic analysis shows that the unit storage cost of the project is approximately US$26-31/ton CO2 with the subsea pipeline as the main contributor to capital expenditure (CAPEX), and the dehydration system as the main factor of operating expenditure (OPEX).",

Methods The free plasma homocysteine (Hcy) of 245 patients with acute cerebral infarction or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and 52 age- and gender-matched normal controls by high-performance liquid chromatography were determined. The patients were divided into hyperhomocysteinemia group (Hhcy group) and non-hyperhomocysteinemia group (Nhhcy group) according to the level of Hcy. Within a 5-years follow-up period, the occurrence of patients with IS, death events in the 2 groups were observed. Results The incidence of recurrent cerebral infarction of Hhcy group and Nhhcy group was 41. 05% and 20.00% respectively (P<0. 01). That of TIA was 11.58% and 4.67% respectively (P< 0.05).

        "abstract": "[Objective] To explore the therapy of PTAS of extracranial segment stenosis of carotid artery and the longterm effectiveness of anti-arteriosclerosis after operation. [Methods] 31 patients with extracranial Segment Stenosis of Carotid artery were performed by PTAS with self-expand stent and protective umbrella by the approach of femoral artery, and they were followed up for 6 to 31 months. All of they accepted the therapy of antiplatelet drug and probucol chronically after operation. [Results] The average stenosis rate of patients was 82.92% before operation, and was 10.22% after operation. The neurologic impairment of 11 stroke patients and cognitive function of 9 stroke patients were improved and the TIA was controlled. The average follow-up period was 20 months. Within the period, there were 5 patients with recurrence of cerebral ischemic symptons (3 were cerebrovascular insufficiency syndrome, 1 were TIA and 1 was cerebral infarction.), and they had poor therapy compliance, their risk factor could not be controlled effectively and had obvious immunizing dysfunction. Others had better therapy compliance and did not show recurrence of stroke symptoms, and transcranial doppler sonography confirmed that the artery patency was still well. [Conclusion] PTAS was an effective therapy to cure extracranial segment stenosis of carotid artery with little trauma, using protective umbrella can increase the safety during operation, and antiplatelet combined with probucol may have good long-term effectiveness of therapy.",

        "abstract": "Extraction separation of Cu(II) and Co(II) from sulfuric wastewater is studied with hollow fiber renewal liquid membrane (HFRLM) technique. The organic solution of LIX 984N in kerosene is used as the liquid membrane phase to selectively separate and concentrate Cu(II) from aqueous solution; and the extractant of CYANEX 272 is used as carrier to remove and concentrate Co(II) from aqueous solution. In the selective separation process, LIX 984N has good selectivity on Cu(II); the interactions among metal ions can be negligible; the pH in the feed aqueous solution has significant influence, while the influence of hydrogen ion concentration in the stripping phase is slight. The removal efficiency of Cu(II) increases with the increasing flow rate on lumen side, while decreases with the increasing flow rate on shell side. The results of lab-scale cascade experiments show that the HFRLM technique is a promising treatment method for simulated sulfuric wastewater containing copper and cobalt with separation factor higher than 100. The Cu(II) and Co(II) concentrations in the raffinate are lower than 0.50mgL-1 and 1.0mgL-1, respectively, which are both below the standard of wastewater discharge in China. Based on the surface renewal theory, resistance-in-series model and mass balance law, a corresponding mass transfer mathematical model is developed; and the calculated results are in good agreement with experimental data. \u00a9 2010.",

        "abstract": "Ground level ozone, generated by the photochemical reaction between nitrogen oxides and volatile hydrocarbons, is harmful to humans and the environment. Prediction and forecasting play an important role in the regulatory policies aimed at the control and reduction of surface ozone. Belonging to the family of model-driven statistical models, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) provide a rich mathematical structure and perform well in many applications. While conventional HMM applications assume Gaussian distribution for the observation statistics, several key meteorological factors and most ozone precursors exhibit a non-Gaussian distribution, which would weaken the performance of a conventional HMM in modeling ozone exceedances. We propose a method based on a HMM with a Gamma distribution (HMM-Gamma) where each monitoring day is pre-labeled according to its maximum 8-h average ozone concentration and monitoring days are further grouped into zones with different ozone levels. Then, HMMs associated with each zone are trained using air quality monitoring data where the model parameters are estimated by a modified Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We derive a new re-estimation formula for the model parameters for observation sequences that exhibit a Gamma distribution. The trained HMM-Gamma models are used to predict ozone exceedances in two geographic areas, Livermore Valley near San Francisco, CA and Houston Metropolitan Area, TX. Compared to the conventional HMM (HMM-Gaussian), HMM-Gamma for the ground level ozone in Livermore Valley can reduce false alarms by 77% and HMM-Gamma for that in Houston Metropolitan Area can reduce false alarms by 32%. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "As an energy-efficient alternative to distillation, pervaporation has been widely combined with fermentation to remove organic compounds from their dilute solutions in a fermentation broth. In this work, the organic permselective composite membrane is prepared by coating polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cross-linked with n-heptane on the substrate of polytetrafluoroethylene(PTFE) membrane. The separation behavior is studied in different dilute organic solutions, which include acetone dilute solution, butanone dilute solution, cyclohexanone dilute solution, ethanol dilute solution, isopropanol dilute solution, n-butyl alcohol dilute solution, acetic acid dilute solution, and ethyl acetate dilute solution. Most of these solutions are main reaction products or by-products from fermentation process. The effects of solubility of organics in the membrane, molecular weight, and polarity of the organics on the pervaporation performance are investigated. The effects of operating temperature and organic concentration in the feed solutions on the performance of composite membrane are studied as well. The experimental results show that molecular volume has less influence than solubility and molecular polarity for these organic solvent. The selectivity of PDMS membrane to ethyl acetate is relative high due to good solubility and diffusion of ethyl acetate molecules in polymer.",

The organic phase of 30% N235 + 20% n -octanol + 50% kerosene was used as liquid membrane phase, NaOH as stripping phase. Experiments were performed as a function of operation mode, carrier concentration in the organic phase, initial citric acid concentration in the feed phase, NaOH concentration in the stripping phase, etc. The results showed that the HFRLM process was very stable.

The principal uses of citric acid are food, pharmaceutical, and industrial. The world market of citric acid is growing every year [1] . The recovery of citric acid from fermentation broth is one of important steps in a commercial process of citric acid production, especially from dilute solutions. Now, the only commercially viable technique on large-scale processes is precipitation technique using calcium salt followed by filtration and subsequently treated with sulphuric acid, but the common calcium salt precipitation process for isolation of citric acid produces 2.5 tons of waste per ton of citric acid [1\u20134] . Other recovery methods for this purpose, such as, solvent extraction, ionic exchange, absorption, electrodialysis, membrane separation, etc., encounter various difficulties [1,2] . Therefore, it is necessary to look for an efficient, economic and lower waste residual disposal process for recovery of citric acid from fermentation broth. Recently, liquid membrane techniques have become an attractively alternative method for this purpose [5\u201311] . Boey and Garcia Del Cerro [5] studied the recovery of citric acid using emulsion liquid membrane technique. Alamine 336 was used as carrier, n -heptane as diluent, Span-80 and Lubrizol as addition agent, and Na 2 CO 3 solution as stripping phase. More than 80% of citric acid was extracted from aqueous solutions. Other researchers also investigated this recovery process using emulsion liquid membrane [6\u20138] . Juang and Chen [9,10] and Guo and Zhang [11] studied the transport process of citric acid across a supported liquid membrane. However, due to the lack of their long-time stability, difficult operation of the emulsification and de-emulsification steps in ELM processes, etc., liquid membrane techniques have not been adopted for large-scale industrial processes [12\u201314] . In order to overcome these difficulties arising in the conventional liquid membrane systems, Zhang et al proposed a new liquid membrane technique, called hollow fiber renewal liquid membrane (HFRLM) [15\u201318] , based on the surface renewal theory, which also integrated the advantages of fiber membrane extraction process, liquid film permeation process, and other liquid membrane systems [15] . In a HFRLM process, hydrophobic hollow fibers are used, whose pores are filled with organic phase, i.e. liquid membrane phase. The stirred mixture of organic phase and stripping phase (or feed phase) at a high aqueous/organic volume ratio is pumped through the lumen side of the module. The organic droplets are homogeneously dispersed in the mixture by stirring. The feed phase (or the stripping phase) flows through the shell side, usually in countercurrent mode. The flow rates of two sides are controlled to maintain a positive pressure on the shell side with respect to the lumen side. During the fluid flowing through the lumen side, a thin organic film, i.e. liquid membrane layer, is developed in the internal side of fibers as shown in Fig. 1 due to the wetting affinity of the organic phase and hydrophobic fibers. The shear force caused by the flowing fluid in the lumen side will influence the coalescence and breakage of organic droplets during the stirred mixture flowing through the lumen side. That is, the shear force will cause the film liquid to form microdroplets on the surface of the liquid membrane layer, which will peel off from the surface of the liquid membrane layer and enter into the lumen side fluid. At the same time, the organic droplets will fill the surface of the liquid film. Then the renewal of the liquid membrane is continuous proceeding. This can enhance the mass transfer rate and greatly reduce the diffusion resistance across the aqueous boundary layer within the lumen side. The thickness of the developed liquid membrane film is thin due to the effects of shear forces caused by fluid flowing in the HFRLM process. The solute can be selectively transported across the liquid membrane from the feed phase to the stripping phase. Furthermore, the dispersed organic droplets in the lumen side fluid can automatically and continuously replenish the loss of membrane liquid caused by solubility and emulsification to prevent liquid membrane degradation. The leakage between phases is less than 0.01%. Then the HFRLM process can provide good stability. Hollow fiber renewal liquid membrane process has several potential advantages of high mass transfer rate, high concentration factor, long-time stability, no leakage occurs between phases, no secondary pollution, low extractant consumption, low capital, maintenance and operation costs, low energy consumption, easy scale-up, etc. In this paper, hollow fiber renewal liquid membrane technique was used for simultaneous extraction and concentration of citric acid from dilute aqueous solutions. The system of citric acid + N235/ n -octanol/kerosene + NaOH solution was used to study the mass transfer characteristics of HFRLM process. The stability and effects of operation mode, carrier concentration in the organic phase, initial citric acid concentration in the feed phase, NaOH concentration in the stripping phase, etc. on mass transfer performance of the HFRLM process were studied. The mechanism of mass transfer in the HFRLM process was also discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Reagents and apparatus Citric acid (Beijing Beihua Refined Chemical Co. Ltd.), NaOH (Beijing Beihua Refined Chemical Co. Ltd.) and n -octanol (Guangdong Shandou Xilong Chemical Reagent Plant) are all analytical grade reagents. Kerosene (Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Plant) and N235 (Shanghai Laiyashi Chemical Reagent Plant) is technical grade reagent. All the experiments were conducted using the self-designed systems. The experimental set-up was shown in Fig. 2 . The used hollow fiber modules were self-manufactured with small laboratory scale versions (with two 0\u20131 dm 3 min \u22121 peristaltic pumps and flow meters) that were specifically designed for the experimental purposes. The small size made it possible to avoid the influence of non-ideal flow in the shell side of the module. The PVDF hollow fibers were used from Tianjin Polytechnic University. Additional information about these modules was provided in Table 1 . 2.2 Experimental procedures To determine the distribution coefficient, equal volume (25 mL) of aqueous phase and organic phase were added to each flask. The flask containing the mixture was vigorously mixed by a shaker for about 5 min, and then the mixture was transferred to a separating funnel and allowed to settle for at least 15 min. After separation of the phases, the aqueous phase sample was taken for citric acid concentration analysis with neutralization titration method. The concentration of citric acid in the organic phase was calculated by mass balance law. The distribution coefficient can be calculated as follows: (1) D = [ A 3 \u2212 ] O , eq [ A 3 \u2212 ] W , eq For the HFRLM process, the used hydrophobic fibers were pre-wetted with organic phase more than 48 h in order to make the pores of fibers fully filled with organic phase. The stirred mixture of stripping phase and organic phase at a high aqueous/organic volume ratio was pumped through the lumen side of the module; the feed phase flowed through the shell side of the module. In all experiments, both sides were contacted in countercurrent mode. When a stable flow was achieved, aqueous samples were taken from outlet of lumen side and shell side at preset time intervals. The experimental mass transfer flux J of the transport of citric acid across the liquid membrane from the feed phase to the stripping phase was determined by the following equation: (2) J = d C st V st A \u2009 d t = L st \u2009 \u0394 C st A where \u0394 C st represents the variation of the citrate concentration in the stripping phase at time interval \u0394 t , L st the volumetric flow rate of the stripping phase, A the mass transfer area, and V st is the volume of the stripping solution. The overall mass transfer coefficient based on the feed phase can be calculated as follows: (3) K f = J \u0394 C lm where \u0394 C lm = \u0394 C 1 \u2212 \u0394 C 2 ln ( \u0394 C 1 / \u0394 C 2 ) = ( C f in \u2212 ( m \u2032 / m ) C st out ) \u2212 ( C f out \u2212 ( m \u2032 / m ) C st in ) ln ( ( C f in \u2212 ( m \u2032 / m ) C st out ) / ( C f out \u2212 ( m \u2032 / m ) C st in ) ) where C f in , C f out are the inlet and outlet citric acid concentration in the feed phase, respectively, C st in , C st out the inlet and outlet citrate concentration in the stripping phase respectively, m and m \u2032 the distribution coefficient of extraction and stripping process, respectively, \u0394 C lm is the logarithmic mean driving force of mass transfer. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Extraction equilibria Determination of liquid membrane composition is a very important step in HFRLM process. Extraction equilibria experiments were conducted for this purpose. Citric acid (C 6 H 8 O 7 , H 3 A) is a Lewis acid. Then the solvent with Lewis base functional group is better for citric acid extraction process, such as TBP, TOA, N235, etc. [19\u201323] . In this paper, N235, a mixture of tertiary amine-based extractant, is used. The extraction experimental results are shown in Table 2 . Although the distribution coefficient of citric acid between 100% N235 and aqueous phase is higher, it is found in the experiments that the phase splitting became very difficult due to the heavy emulsification effect when the 100% N235 was used as solvent [24] . The results show that the pure n -octanol and kerosene without carrier could extract few citric acids from aqueous phase; the distribution coefficient is less than 0.05. The addition of n -octanol in the mixture of N235 and kerosene could increase the distribution coefficient of extraction process. This indicated that n -octanol had the synergistic extraction effect for this process, which also reported by Yang et al. [23] . Fig. 3 shows the effect of carrier concentration in the organic phase of (N235 + 20% n -octanol + kerosene) on the distribution equilibria of citric acid extraction. The distribution coefficient increases with increasing N235 concentration in the organic phase. When the N235 concentration increasing from 5% to 40%, the distribution coefficient increases from 0.5 to 27.6. As mentioned above, higher N235 concentration leaded to higher emulsification, the phase splitting and analysis were all difficult. Then in later HFRLM experiments, the organic solution of 30% N235 + 20% n -octanol + 50% kerosene was used as liquid membrane composition. 3.2 Stability of HFRLM process In order to study the stability of HFRLM process, a set of experiments were conducted in single-pass mode. The stirred mixture of 0.11 mol L \u22121 NaOH aqueous solution and 30% N235 + 20% n -octanol + 50% kerosene (20:1, v/v) was pumped through the lumen side of the module. The feed phase of 0.1 mol L \u22121 citric acid solution flowed through the shell side. Also the reverse operation mode, that is, the organic phase and feed phase flowed through the lumen side of the module and the stripping phase flowed through the shell side, was studied. Results showed that after 20 min stable citric acid concentration profiles were developed both in the feed phase and the stripping phase. That is, the stable mass transfer performance was achieved for this process. It was indicated that the mass transfer rate of citric acid from the feed phase across the liquid membrane to the stripping phase is high. Also, the HFRLM process could run for over 11 h without any difficulty, mainly due to the continuously and automatically replenishment of membrane liquid by the renewal and regeneration of the liquid membrane. It was suggested that the HFRLM process had long-term stability [15] . In later experiments, all the operation time was set more than 30 min in order to get the stabilized and reliable experimental results. 3.3 Influence of the operation mode In order to investigate the mass transfer mechanism of the process, two different operation modes are used in this paper. Mode #1: the stirred mixture of 0.1 mol L \u22121 citric acid aqueous solution and 30% N235 + 20% n -octanol + 50% kerosene (20:1, v/v) is pumped through the lumen side of the module; and 0.2 mol L \u22121 NaOH aqueous solution flows through the shell side of the module. Mode #2: the stirred mixture of NaOH aqueous solution and 30% N235 + 20% n -octanol + 50% kerosene flows through the lumen side; citric acid aqueous solution flows through the shell side of the module. The results are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 . The overall mass transfer coefficient and mass transfer flux of mode #2 are higher than those of mode #1. It is indicated that main mass transfer resistance of HFRLM process for this system is located in the transport of citric acid from membrane phase to stripping phase. Although the distribution coefficient of citric acid between NaOH aqueous solution and organic phase is much higher than that between the citric acid aqueous solution and organic phase, the extraction chemistry involved in liquid membranes is basically the same as that found in solvent extraction, but the overall transport process is governed by kinetic rather equilibrium parameters. As shown in Fig. 4 , the influence of lumen side flow rate on the overall mass transfer coefficient of operation mode #2 is slight. It is indicated that the transport of citric acid from membrane phase to the stripping phase is not governed by the diffusional mobility of citrate complex through aqueous boundary layer from liquid membrane phase to stripping phase interface, but the rate of decomplexation chemical reaction at the interface. On the contrary, the overall mass transfer coefficient of operation mode #1 increases with increasing lumen side flow rate. It is indicated that in the transport of citric acid from feed phase to the membrane phase is mainly governed by the diffusional mobility of citrate complex through aqueous boundary layer from feed phase to liquid membrane phase interface, not the rate of complexation chemical reaction. Certainly the low values of overall mass transfer coefficient for both operation modes also indicate the diffusion of citrate complex across the pores of membrane plays a definite role in the transport of citric acid in HFRLM process. These agree with the Juang and Chen's [19] study about the transport rates of citric acid through a supported liquid membrane containing tri- n -octylamine. They indicated that the transport process was governed by mixed interfacial chemical reaction and membrane diffusion. In the case of operation mode #2, the renewal of the liquid membrane, i.e. the repeatable exchange of organic droplets between the stirred mixture and liquid membrane layer, and large mass transfer area due to the fully direct contact between the organic droplets and stripping aqueous solution, will intensify the complexation chemical reaction rate and mass transfer rate in HFRLM process. These can greatly reduce the resistance of mass transfer of citric acid from liquid membrane phase to the stripping phase. However, in the case of operation mode #1, the effect of mass transfer intensification is on the transport of citric acid from feed solution to the membrane phase, which is not the main mass transfer resistance in the HFRLM process. In addition, for the treatment of large amount of low citric acid concentration aqueous solutions, such as fermentation broth, wastewater, etc., the operation mode #1 would increase the consumption of solvent and enhance the difficulties of solvent recovery, while the operation mode #2 could avoid these problems and carry out the concentration of solute simultaneously. Therefore, the operation mode #2 is adopted in later experiments. 3.4 Influence of carrier concentration in the organic phase Prior to the experiments to study the effect of N235 concentration in liquid membrane phase on the mass transfer characteristic of HFRLM process, hollow fibers used in the module were pre-wetted with organic phase in different N235 concentrations more than 48 h. Results are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 . In the HFRLM process, the overall mass transfer coefficient and mass transfer flux of HFRLM process mainly dependent on facilitated transport capacity of the organic phase, which is also corresponding to the carrier concentration in the organic phase. And the carrier concentration could also affect the chemical reaction kinetic, distribution equilibria, diffusional mobility of complex in the aqueous boundary layer, liquid membrane phase, membrane phase, etc. Usually, the mass transfer rate of HFRLM process increases with increasing carrier concentration due to the mass transfer mechanism of carrier-facilitated transport. The distribution coefficient of citric acid between the aqueous solution and organic phase increases with increasing N235 concentration in the organic phase; higher N235 concentration leads to higher driving force of mass transfer in HFRLM process. And the increasing quantity of carrier in liquid membrane phase and in mixture can also enhance the rates of complex reaction and carrier-facilitated transport of citric acid. Then as indicated in Figs. 6 and 7 , the overall mass transfer coefficient and mass transfer flux increase with increasing N235 concentration in the organic phase in the N235 concentration range of 0\u201340% (v/v) as expected. 3.5 Influence of initial citric acid concentration in the feed phase The effect of initial citric acid concentration in the feed phase on the mass transfer performance of the HFRLM process is also studied. The overall mass transfer coefficient decreases with increasing initial citric acid concentration in the feed phase as shown in Fig. 8 . Because the higher initial citric acid concentration in the feed phase leads to higher citric acid concentration in the organic phase by distribution equilibrium, which results in the saturation in the liquid membrane and the pore liquid by the complex molecules. Then the rate of decomplexation chemical reaction at the stripping interface is presumably the rate-limiting step in specific operation conditions. However the mass transfer flux of citric acid increases with increasing initial citric acid concentration in the feed phase as shown in Fig. 9 . It is because that the distribution coefficient decreases with increasing initial citric acid concentration in the feed phase, the driving force of mass transfer caused by the distribution coefficient increases with increasing initial citric acid concentration in the aqueous solution. This behavior is similar with our previous study on the transport of copper in HFRLM process [15] . 3.6 Influence of NaOH concentration in the stripping phase Figs. 10 and 11 give the effects of NaOH concentration in the stripping phase on the mass transfer performance of the HFRLM process. The NaOH concentration in the stripping phase almost have no influence on the overall mass transfer coefficient and mass transfer flux in this process at range of 0.20\u20130.75 mol L \u22121 . Because the relative excess stripping phase has not significant benefit for the rate of decomplexation chemical reaction, which governed the transport of citric acid from membrane phase to stripping phase as discussion above. The mass transfer intensification for this case caused by effects of renewal of liquid membrane and fully contact between organic droplets and stripping solution is fixed. 3.7 Transport studies The ability of HFRLM technique to the transport of citric acid from the feed phase to the receiver phase is studied in recycling mode. A small self-manufactured hollow fiber module with 20 hollow fibers is used. The feed phase of 300 mL 0.10 mol L \u22121 citric acid solutions is pumped through the shell side of the module. The stirred mixture of 150 mL 1.50 mol L \u22121 NaOH aqueous solution and 15 mL 30% N235 + 20% n -octanol + 50% kerosene flows through the lumen side of the module. Both sides are operated in countercurrent recycling mode. The results are shown in Fig. 12 . \u201cUp-hill\u201d effect, which means the solute can be transported from low to high concentration solutions, is an important characteristic of liquid membrane techniques. This characteristic provides the advantages of simultaneous extraction and concentration of solute from dilute solutions. The results show that the transport process appears the up-hill effect at 5 h, the citric acid transports from low concentration solution (feed phase) to high concentration solution (stripping phase); at 8.5 h, the enrichment effect is observed. At 18 h, the citric acid concentration in the feed phase becomes 0.0015 mol L \u22121 , the recovery efficiency is up to 98.8%. Although the mass transfer flux of this recycling experiment decreases with time, it can remain a relative higher value in the whole process. It is indicated that the transport rate of citric acid through HFRLM is high. Furthermore, it should be noted that the size of used hollow fiber module is so small that operation time is long in this experiment. 4 Conclusions A new liquid membrane technique, hollow fiber renewal liquid membrane, is used for the recovery of citric acid from dilute solutions. The organic solution of 30% N235 + 20% n -octanol + 50% kerosene was used as liquid membrane phase, NaOH aqueous solution was used as stripping phase. Results show that HFRLM process is very stable due to the automatic and continuous replenishment of membrane liquid. It is better for the HFRLM process that the stirred mixture of the stripping phase and the organic phase flows through the lumen side of the module, because the main mass transfer resistance is located in the transport of citric acid from membrane phase to the stripping phase, which is mainly governed by the rate of decomplexation chemical reaction. The overall mass transfer coefficient and mass transfer flux increase with increasing carrier concentration in the organic phase. And the overall mass transfer coefficient decreases with increasing initial citric acid concentration in the feed phase, while the mass transfer flux increases with increasing initial citric acid concentration in the feed phase. The effect of NaOH concentration in the stripping phase on the mass transfer performance of this process is slight. The transport results show that the recovery of citric acid by HFRLM can carry out enrichment of the citric acid and the mass transfer rate is high. HFRLM technique has good prospects in the recovery process of citric acid from dilute solutions.

The experimental results showed that the effect of varying membrane thickness and porosity on the membrane absorption process is independent of the micropore shape.

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new liquid membrane technique, hollow fiber renewal liquid membrane (HFRLM), is presented, which is based on the surface renewal theory, and integrates the advantages of fiber membrane extraction, liquid film permeation and other liquid membrane processes. The results from the system of CuSO4 + D 2 EHPA in kerosene + HCl show that the HFRLM process is very stable. The liquid membrane is renewed constantly during the process, the direct contact of organic droplets and aqueous phase provides large mass transfer area. These effects can significantly reduce the mass transfer resistance in the lumen side. Then the mixture of feed phase and organic phase flowing through the lumen side gives a higher mass transfer rate than that of stripping phase and organic phase, because the aqueous layer diffusion of feed phase is the rate-controlling step. The overall mass transfer coefficient increases with increasing flow rates and D2EHPA concentration in the organic phase, and with decreasing initial copper concentration in the feed phase. The overall mass transfer coefficient also increases with increasing pH in the feed phase, and reaches a maximum value at pH of 4.44, then decreases. Also, there is a favorable w / o volume ratio of 20:1 to 30:1 for this process. Compared with hollow fiber supported liquid membrane and hollow fiber membrane extraction processes, HFRLM process has a high mass transfer rate. Mathematical model for the HFRLM process based on the surface renewal theory is developed. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental results under the conditions studied. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The effect of hollow fiber module scale on the mass transfer performance of hollow fiber renewal liquid membrane technique is studied experimentally and theoretically. Five scales of polypropylene hollow fiber membrane modules with same packing density and effective length are used for experiments. CuSO4 aqueous solution is used as feed phase, the organic solution of LIX984N in kerosene is used as liquid membrane phase, and H2SO4 is used as the stripping phase. The non-ideal flow status on the shell-side of the hollow fiber module is described by residence time distribution curves and quantitatively characterized by the Peclet number. Peclet number increases with the increase of L/d in hollow fiber module, and reaches its maximum value when L/d is 20, then decreases. The overall mass transfer coefficient is directly proportional to the Peclet number on the shell side in single-pass, recycling and cascade operation modes in the hollow fiber renewal liquid membrane process. A new mass transfer correlation is proposed to quantitatively describe the non-ideal flow on the shell-side of the hollow fiber module with Peclet number. Then, the corresponding mathematical model for hollow fiber renewal liquid membrane process is developed and the calculated results show good agreement with the experimental data. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

The experimental results\n showed that the PTFE membrane had a filtration efficiency of above 99.99% for micron particles, and excellent regeneration\n behavior was obtained, though a much higher initial pressure drop existed. Based on the results, it was concluded that the\n PTFE membrane is an excellent surface-filtration media for micron particles. Effects of operation parameters, including airflow\n velocity, particle concentration and particle characteristics were also investigated. To better understand the evolution of\n pressure drop during the filtration process, a mathematical model with operation parameters and characteristics of particles\n was derived from the gas-solid two-phase flow theories. A novel method on the determination of regeneration period of the\n filter media was put forward based on the analysis of the pressure drop according to this model.",

In this paper, CuSO4 aqueous solutions was used as simulated industrial wastewater containing Cu(II), D2EHPA/kerosene as liquid membrane phase, HCl aqueous solution as receiver phase, ad the hollow fiber supported liquid membrane (HSFSLM) technique was used for the treatment of wastewater containing Cu(II).

The results show that the mass transfer performance of HFSLM Treating process were experimentally studied. The results show that the mass transfer flux increases with increasing flow rates of two phases and the increase of D2EHPA concentration in the liquid membrane phase, and it is better that the feed phase flows through the lumen side of the module.

        "abstract": "Hollow fiber renewal liquid membrane (HFRLM), a new liquid membrane technique inspired from surface renewal theory, is used to simultaneously remove and recover copper from acidic wastewater. The commercial extractant, LIX984N, is used as a carrier in liquid membrane phase, kerosene used as a diluent. CuSO 4 solutions is used to simulate acidic industrial wastewater, in which the pH is adjusted by dilute H 2 SO 4 . The mass transfer mechanisms of the process are investigated. As a carrier-facilitated transport process, the addition of LIX984N in the liquid membrane phase can greatly improve the transport performance; the organic/aqueous stripping volume ratio from 1:10 to 1:7 on lumen side mixture is better in terms of the renewal effect and diffusion resistance. The higher pH in the feed phase (>3) and H 2 SO 4 concentration in the stripping phase around 2.0 mol L \u22121 are favorable for the transport process due to the increase of mass transfer driving forces. The mass transfer fluxes increase with increasing flow rates on two sides. The countercurrent cascade experiments show that the HFRLM process could carry out the simultaneous removal and recovery of copper from wastewater successfully. The modeled results based on the surface renewal theory demonstrate a good agreement with experimental data.

The results indicated that the greater the membrane mean pore size and the wider the pore size distribution are, the higher the gas permeability. A gas permeation model, including the effects of membrane structure parameter and gas properties, was established.

The factors including solvent polarity, lipase dosage, concentration, and molar ratio of substrate and temperature were found to have significant influence on conversion. Results showed that hexane (logP\u2009=\u20093.53) was a favorable solvent for the biosynthesis of butyl oleate in our studies. The optimal conditions were experimentally determined of 50 U immobilized lipase, molar ratio of oleic acid to butanol of 1.0, substrate concentration of 0.12 mol/L, temperature of 37 \u00b0C, and reaction time of 2 h.

Experiments were performed as a function of carrier concentration in the organic phase, organic/aqueous volume ratio, pH, and initial penicillin G concentration in the feed phase, pH in the stripping phase, flow rates, etc. The results showed that the HFRLM process was stable and could carry out simultaneous extraction and concentration of penicillin G from aqueous solutions. As a carrier facilitated transport process, the addition of DOA in organic phase could greatly enhance the mass transfer rate; and there was a favorable organic/aqueous volume ratio of 1:20 to 1:30 for this system. The mass transfer flux and overall mass transfer coefficient increased with decreasing pH in the feed phase and increasing pH in the stripping phase, because of variation of the mass transfer driving force caused by pH gradient and distribution equilibrium. The flow rate of the shell side had significant influence on the mass transfer performance, whereas the effect of flow rate of lumen side on the mass transfer performance was slight because of the mass transfer intensification of renewal effect in the lumen side.

        "abstract": "Prediction of air pollutant levels plays an important role in the regulatory plans aimed at the control and reduction of airborne pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM). Deterministic photochemical air quality models, which are commonly used for regulatory management and planning, are computationally intensive and also expensive for routine predictions. Compared to deterministic photochemical air quality models, data-driven statistical models are simpler and may be more accurate. In this paper, hidden Markov models (HMM) are used to forecast daily average PM2.5 concentrations 24h ahead. In conventional HMM applications, observation distributions emitted from certain hidden states are assumed as having Gaussian distributions. However, certain key meteorological factors and most PM2.5 precursors exhibit a non-Gaussian distribution in reality, which would degrade the HMM performance significantly. In order to address this problem, in this paper, HMMs with log-normal, Gamma and generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions are developed to predict PM2.5 concentration at Concord and Sacramento monitors in Northern California. Results show that HMM with non-Gaussian emission distributions is able to predict PM2.5 exceedance days correctly and reduces false alarms dramatically. Compared to HMM with Gaussian distributions, HMM with log-normal distributions can improve the true prediction rate (TPR) by 37.5% and reduce the false alarms by 78% at Concord. And HMM with GEV distribution can improve TPR by 150% and reduce false alarms by 63.62% at Sacramento Del Paso Manor. Comparisons between different distributions used in HMM show that the closer the distribution employed in HMM is to the observation sequence, the better the model prediction performance. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

The influences of the carrier concentration in the liquid membrane phase, the HCl concentration of the feed phase, and the stripping concentration on the mass transfer process are studied. The transport rate of Cr(VI) increases with increasing the TBP concentration and HCl concentration. The increasing of the stripping concentration improves the stripping process until a plateau is reached. A kinetic model is used to describe the Cr(VI) transport behavior, assuming that it obeys the kinetic laws of two consecutive irreversible first-order reactions. The experimental data fits reasonable well with the derived model. The analysis of the accumulation of Cr(VI) in the liquid membrane phase and the discussion of the rate-controlling step under different experimental conditions are carried out. The magnitude of the value of k e and k s is found to be 10 \u22124 \u201310 \u22125 s \u22121 , and is well in agreement with other studies.",

Microbial oil accumulation with filamentous fungi has great potential because filamentous\n fungi can form pellets during cell growth, and these pellets are much easier to harvest from cell broth. This paper focuses\n on the cell pelletization process of the oleaginous Mucor circinelloides. We have studied the effect of various cultural conditions on pelletized cell growth and lipid accumulation. This study is\n the first to report that pH adjustment during cell growth plays a key role in pellet formation of M. circinelloides and describes a handy method by which to induce cell pelletization in submerged fungal cultivation. Our study reveals that\n cell growth and lipid production are not significantly affected by pelletization and that lipid accumulation is triggered\n at stressed conditions, such as a high carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and high temperature.",

        "abstract": "Pure CO2 was absorbed by de-ionized water using membranes with different porosities in a flat sheet membrane contactor. When the liquid was kept static, the porosity had little effect on the absorption process. When the liquid was stirred, the mass transfer process was enhanced. However, the porosity influenced the mass transfer process due to the uneven distribution of the concentration profile of the solute near the membrane surface. In order to improve the distribution of the concentration of the solute near the membrane surface, solid particles were added to the absorbent liquid in order to enhance the turbulence in the boundary layer. The movement of the particles in the liquid boundary layer resulted in the concentration profile near the membrane surface on the liquid side becoming more homogeneous. Consequently adding the solid particles to the absorbent liquid resulted in a decrease in the differences in mass transfer coefficients obtained for various porosities and the mass transfer efficiency was raised above 40%. The highest enhancement factors were obtained for low porosities. The enhancement effect initially became more significant with increasing concentration of the solid, and then remained constant with further increases in solid concentration. The enhancement factor decreased with increasing stirring speed.",

The results indicate that the transport rate of Cr(VI) is fast and extraction equilibrium can be attained in 15 min. The removal efficiency is strongly affected by the initial TBP concentration and pH of the waster water in their lower ranges.

It is shown that the extraction and stripping process could be carried out in the same stage by the HFRLM technique. The overall mass transfer coefficient increases with increasing the feed flow rate, however, under the experimental conditions, the strip phase flow rate has only small effect on the mass transfer. The influences of the mixing mode and the distribution coefficient of the system on the mass transfer of HFRLM were investigated. Results show that, since the distribution coefficient between the phases are different, it causes the mixing mode has a bigger influence on the overall mass transfer, and it will advantage the mass transfer process of the HFRLM if let the phase with larger distribution coefficient mix with the extraction phase and flow with it together through the tube side.",

The experimental results show that the membrane pores shape (stretched pore and cylinder pore) and the membrane thickness do not affect the membrane absorption process, and the membrane porosity has only little influence on the membrane absorption process for slow mass transfer system. However, the influence of porosity on the membrane absorption process will increase when the absorption rate of the absorption system is higher. Moreover, the mass transfer behavior of absorbate near the membrane surface of liquid side was studied. The results show that the influence of membrane porosity on the mass transfer performance of the membrane relates to several factors, such as the flow condition, the absorption system, the distance between the micro-pores, etc..",

Experiments were performed as a function of stirring rate, TBP concentration and type of diluent in the liquid membrane phase, pH, and initial penicillin G concentration in the feed phase, Na(2)CO(3) concentration in the stripping phase, etc. The results showed that the BLM process could carry out the simultaneous separation and concentration of penicillin G from dilute aqueous solutions, and arise \"up-hill\" effect due to the characteristic of non-equilibrium mass transfer. The diffusion of penicillin G complex in the liquid membrane phase played an important role in BLM process. The mass transfer mechanism of BLM for this system was also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Pure CO2 was absorbed by de-ionized water using membranes with different porosities in a flat sheet membrane contactor.When the liquid was kept static,the porosity had little effect on the absorption process.When the liquid was stirred,the mass transfer process was enhanced.However,the porosity influenced the mass transfer process due to the uneven distribution of the concentration profile of the solute near the membrane surface.In order to improve the distribution of the concentration of the solute near the membrane surface,solid particles were added to the absorbent liquid in order to enhance the turbulence in the boundary layer.The movement of the particles in the liquid boundary layer resulted in the concentration profile near the membrane surface on the liquid side becoming more homogeneous.Consequently adding the solid particles to the absorbent liquid resulted in a decrease in the differences in mass transfer coefficients obtained for various porosities and the mass transfer efficiency was raised above 40%.The highest enhancement factors were obtained for low porosities.The enhancement effect initially became more significant with increasing concentration of the solid,and then remained constant with further increases in solid concentration.The enhancement factor decreased with increasing stirring speed.",

In this paper,CuSO4 aqueous solutions was used as simulated industrial wastewater containing Cu(II),D2EHPA/kerosene as liquid membrane phase,HCl aqueous solution as receiver phase,and the hollow fiber supported liquid membrane (HFSLM) technique was used for the treatment of wastewater containing Cu(II). The effects of liquid membrane composition,flow rates of two phases and operation mode on the mass transfer performance of HFSLM treating process were experimentally studied. The results show that the mass transfer flux increases with increasing flow rates of two phases and the increase of D2EHPA concentration in the liquid membrane phase,and it is better that the feed phase flows through the lumen side of the module. The results of laboratory scale simulated technological experiments show that HFSLM treating process could carry out the simultaneous removal and concentration of copper from wastewater; the removal efficiency is over 97% and the enrichment factor is over 5.",

The results show that the reactive extraction efficiency of one stage is up to 85% at room temperature with pH of 3.05 and o/a=1:1. Liquid membrane technique can carry out the simultaneous separation and concentration processes. As a result of nonequilibrium mass transfer characteristic, the liquid membrane process can be performed in a mild pH condition, in which the penicillin G is stale. However, the mass transfer rate of bulk liquid membrane process is slow due to the high diffusion resistance in the liquid membrane phase. While the mass transfer rate of hollow fiber renewal liquid membrane process is high due to the mass transfer intensification of renewal effect. It is indicated that hollow fiber renewal liquid membrane technique is a prospective method for recovery of penicillin G with TBP as facilitated carrier.",

SEM images showed that a \"sandwich-like\" membrane structure with a porous lipase-PVA catalytic layer uniformly coated on a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/polyethersulfone (PES) bilayer was obtained. Optimum conditions for lipase immobilization in the catalytic layer were determined. The membrane was proved to exhibit superior thermal stability, pH stability and reusability than free lipase under similar conditions. In the case of pervaporation coupled synthesis of lauryl stearate, benefited from in-situ water removal by the membrane, a conversion enhancement of approximately 40% was achieved in comparison to the equilibrium conversion obtained in batch reactors. In addition to conversion enhancement, it was also found that excess water removal by the catalytically active membrane appears to improve activity of the lipase immobilized.",

The interactions of ionic liquid with toluene and cyclohexane were calculated and experimentally studied by quantum chemical calculation and liquid-liquid extraction process. The results showed [BPy][BF4] have stronger interaction with toluene than that with cyclohexane. The selectivity of SILM processes was larger than 10 at the temperature of 323 K and the flow rate of 13.5 mL\u00b7min\u22121 on both shell side and lumen side. Due to the higher viscosity of IL, SILM process had good long-term stability. As the effects of mass transfer driving force of SILM process, the flux and removal efficiency increased with increase of initial toluene concentration, while the selectivity decreased because of the competitive transport. Base on the resistance in-series model and experimental results, the mass transfer resistance was mainly lay liquid membrane phase. The influence of flow rates on both sides was slight. The higher temperature could enhance the mass transfer performance significantly. The removal efficiency increased from 28.2% to 45.1% with the increasing of operation temperature from 298 K to 323 K.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The conversion of equilibrium-limited reactions can be efficiently improved by selective removal of product using a Pervaporation Membrane Reactor (PVMR), which attracts substantial attentions due to its excellent performance. For modeling the PVMR process, a pseudo-binary system was often assumed, nevertheless, it is inadequate to predict the performance when both the reactant and product have the similar properties and can simultaneous permeate through the membrane. A detailed model was established by coupling multi-component pervaporation and reaction kinetics with the butanoxime hydrolysis reaction employed as the experiment system. A modified Flory\u2013Huggins (FH) approach and the Maxwell\u2013Stefan (MS) formulation were used to describe the pervaporation model. The mass transfer fluxes and the concentration profiles of permeants within the membrane were modeled by a finite difference approach. Two coexisted behaviors,  i.e.  competitive adsorption and plasticizing effects were considered to influence mass transfer. The PVMR performance was predicted and a good agreement between experiment and calculation was obtained. The mechanism that how the simultaneous permeation of reactant and product influence the PVMR performance were further clarified in different operating conditions, including initial reactant concentration, downstream pressure, membrane thickness, ratio of membrane area to reaction volume, and temperature.",

In this study, a catalytically active membrane was prepared by immersion phase inversion and was used for the conversion enhancement of present reaction by continuous removal of by-product water in a pervaporation membrane reactor. SEM images showed that a highly porous \u201csponge-like\u201d catalytic layer immobilized with catalyst Zr(SO 4 ) 2 \u00b74H 2 O was uniformly coated on a polyvinyl alcohol/polyethersulfone pervaporation membrane. Synthesis performances in batch reactor, inert membrane reactor and catalytically active membrane reactor were compared, showing that no equilibrium limitation for glycerol conversion was observed in both the inert membrane reactor and catalytically active membrane reactor. The effect of various operational parameters on the synthesis performance in the catalytically active membrane reactor were investigated, showing that higher temperature and A/V ratio favored better enhancement in glycerol conversion since an acceleration of water removal rate was induced. Optimal catalyst loading and initial mole ratio was also determined for better synthesis performance. Under optimized conditions, the glycerol conversion reached 93% and a conversion enhancement of approximately 52% was achieved when compared to equilibrium conversion at 75\u00a0\u00b0C.",

        "title": "A genuine in-situ water removal at a molecular lever by an enhanced esterification-pervaporation coupling in a catalytically active membrane reactor",
        "abstract": "Abstract   A better conversion enhancement of esterification between acetic acid and n-butanol was achieved in a catalytically active membrane reactor ( p CAMR) when compared to that in a traditional inert membrane reactor (IMR). This enhancement was attributed to a novel composite catalytically active membrane in which a highly porous catalytic layer was introduced. SEM images showed that the membrane consisted of three layers: the top layer was a highly porous catalytic layer with massive macrovoids and \u201csponge-like\u201d pores, the middle layer was a dense polyvinyl alcohol selective layer, and the bottom layer was a porous polyethersulfone support layer. The preparation of a highly porous catalytic layer instead of a dense one in the composite membrane greatly decreased the overall mass transfer resistance of the reactor from 6.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 5  to 5.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 5 \u00a0s/m, a value which is even comparable to that of IMR (5.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 5 \u00a0s/m) where the additional catalytic layer was absent. The effects of operational parameters on the esterification-pervaporation coupling performance in  p CAMR were systematically evaluated. Through a reasonable match between reaction rate and water removal rate, a genuine  in-situ  water removal at a molecular lever was realized. For comparison, coupling performances in an IMR and a catalytically active membrane reactor with a dense composite membrane ( d CAMR) were also investigated. Results showed that the coupling performance in  p CAMR outperformed both IMR and  d CAMR due to a combination of much lower overall mass transfer resistance and higher mass transfer driving force for water removal in  p CAMR. After 45\u00a0h at 85\u00a0\u00b0C, the acid conversion in  p CAMR reached almost completion, an approximately 43% of conversion enhancement was achieved when compared to equilibrium conversion.",

Results showed that the preparation of a highly porous catalytic layer decreased the resistance of catalytic layer from 48.5% to 20.6% of overall resistances, leading to an enhanced water removal ability for the composite membrane. Finally, reaction-separation coupling experiments in IMR, CAMR with  porous  catalytic layer and CAMR with  dense  catalytic layer showed that, with a faster reaction kinetics and water removal rate, CAMR with  porous  catalytic layer exhibited a best coupling performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A robust polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) nanofibrous membrane was prepared by a simple electrospinning-sintering strategy for efficient oil/water separation. Specifically, a PTFE@PVA hybrid nanofibrous membrane in which PTFE particles were uniformly distributed in PVA nanofiber was first prepared by electrospinning, then a sintering treatment was applied to obtain the PTFE nanofibrous membrane. Electron microscopic characterization revealed that the membrane was formed by a sintering mechanism of a fast decomposition of PVA followed by a slower fusion of PTFE particles. Spectroscopic characterization confirmed that the PVA polymer was completely decomposed after 8\u00a0h of sintering. The resulting membrane had a ratio of fluorine to carbon atomic ratio of 2.0, indicating that a pure PTFE nanofibrous membrane was obtained. The as-prepared PTFE membrane exhibited superhydrophobic property with a water contact angle of 155.0\u00b0 and a sliding angle of 5.1\u00b0. Its tensile strength was as high as 19.7\u00a0MPa, indicating excellent mechanical strength. The membrane was successfully applied for gravity-driven oil/water separation with a permeate flux of 1215\u00a0L\u00a0m \u22122 \u00a0h \u22121 . Moreover, its excellent corrosion resistance and mechanical stability suggest that the PTFE nanofibrous membrane could stand harsh environment existing in industrial oil/water separation processes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Surface roughness enhancement by fabricating multi-scale nano/microstructure is an effective strategy to prepare superhydrophobic membranes. Here we report a novel solvent-thermal induced roughening (STIR) method. The method involves the swelling of a polymer surface to create a soft shell/hard core structure under the combined action of solvent and heating, followed by a controllable surface roughening as a result of mismatched thermal expansion between the shell and the core. We show a significant increase of surface roughness for a STIR-treated polyvinylidene fluoride nanofibrous membrane, whose nanofibers were covered with densely-packed nanofins. The treated membrane had greatly enhanced hydrophobicity, resulting in improved anti-wetting performance to low-surface-tension feed water in a membrane distillation process. The STIR method was capable of treating membranes with various pore structures. The novel surface roughening strategy opens up new directions to fabricate superhydrophobic surfaces and membranes, which can greatly benefit a wide range of applications such as membrane distillation, oil/water separation.",

Cascade process of HFRLM was carried out to recover penicillin G from the aqueous solution using di- n -octylamine in iso-octanol and kerosene as the liquid membrane phase and K 2 CO 3  aqueous solution as the stripping phase. The mass transfer performance of the process was evaluated in a hollow fiber module with 1000 microporous and hydrophobic polypropylene (PP) hollow fibers. The cascade process of HFRLM was feasible for penicillin G recovery and the enrichment factor, extraction and recovery efficiency were larger than that of single-stage process. The stripping phase of 0.5\u00a0mol\u00a0L \u22121 \u00a0K 2 CO 3  solution could not only keep the efficiency of re-extraction, but also ensure the stability of penicillin G. Besides, the results indicated that 0.2\u00a0mol\u00a0L \u22121  potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution as the buffer solution in the feed solution could greatly reduce the loss of penicillin G due to the pH fluctuation. In the cascade mode operated at the flow rates of 45\u00a0mL\u00a0min \u22121  in the shell side and 20 mL\u00a0min \u22121  in the tube side, the extraction and recovery efficiency of 97% and 82% for penicillin G were achieved after 7 stages respectively.

        "abstract": "BackgroundThe extraction equilibria of ammonia was investigated with sodium salt of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) as extractant and kerosene, n-heptane and toluene as diluents at 298 \u00b1 0.5 K. In addition, n-decanol was used as a modifier.ResultsThe distribution coefficient increases gradually with increasing Na\u2013D2EHPA concentration in the organic phase. The equilibrium model for the extraction of ammonia with D2EHPA was established by utilizing the mass action law to determine model parameters and apparent extraction equilibrium constants (K1 and K2). The combination of ion-pair species of the type NH4R(HR)4 and NH4R is confirmed to exist in the organic phase at equilibrium. The calculated loadings of D2EHPA agree well with the experimental data. The distribution coefficient of ammonia decreases with increasing initial ammonium concentration in the aqueous solution. The effect of temperature on extraction equilibria was studied and the enthalpy change, free energy change and entropy change of the extraction process with D2EHPA in kerosene were obtained.ConclusionsSaponification of the extractant is necessary and benefits the extraction process. The model established in this work is valid in representing the equilibrium behavior of ammonia with D2EHPA in the three diluents. \u00a9 2016 Society of Chemical Industry",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Vapor permeation (VP) is applied to be integrated with ethanol fermentation as an  in situ  product recovery technique which could avoid the ethanol inhibition in this study. The polydimethylsiloxane o(PDMS) membrane is used in separating ethanol from model ethanol/water mixture and fermentation integrated processes. And the performance of VP-fermentation process is investigated and compared to that of Pervaporation (PV)-Fermentation and batch fermentation processes. Experimental results show that the ethanol removal is successfully achieved, while it still suffers low flux. Then, in order to reduce the mass transfer resistance in gas boundary layer and thus improving the ethanol removal rate, gas stripping is coupled with VP process to form a new configuration of VP process,  i.e.  external mode. Benefited from its high ethanol removal rate, the ethanol productivity of External VP-Fermentation process reaches 3.33\u00a0g/(L\u00b7h), much higher than 2.13\u00a0g/(L\u00b7h) in batch fermentation and 2.90\u00a0g/(L\u00b7h) in PV-Fermentation under its optimal condition,  i.e.  vapor cyclic flow of 1.3\u00a0L/min and module temperature of 35\u00a0\u2103. In VP-fermentation process, membrane deterioration is also efficiently alleviated, which commonly occurs in PV-fermentation process. It makes the membrane process more feasible for industrial fermentation process.",

        "abstract": "Due to the high energy consumption in CO2 capture by amine absorbents, CO2 phase change absorbent, CPCA, has attracted a great attention in research institutes recently. Two phases are formed after CO2 absorption with CPCA as the absorbent, and only the CO2-rich phase goes to the stripper, which could potentially reduce the energy consumption. In this work, the CPCAs composed of MEA/1-propanol/H2O were developed based on the principles of aqueous two-phase systems. The effects of temperature, amine concentration, and total CO2 loading on the phase separation of CPCAs were studied. CO2 loading and 1-propanol distributions in two phases under different experimental conditions were measured. The results indicated that the total CO2 loading is the key factor affecting the distribution of components in two phases. Moreover, in comparison to traditional 30 wt % MEA, the initial absorption rates of all CPCAs were higher than that of MEA, and its maximum value was 5 times higher.

Methods:Subcutaneous injection of PSI into male SD rats was performed to make rat Parkinson's disease model,and the model rats were divided into three groups randomly. Four weeks after completion of modeling,the rats were given saline,Madopar,Xifeng zhichan mixture for 3 consecutive weeks. Behavioral changes of rats were observed before and after the treatment,substantia nigra was sampled after 4% paraformaldehyde perfusion through the heart,the ultrastructural changes of neurons and glial cells were observed by transmission electron microscope. Results:Model rats presented with increased involuntary movements,tremor,curled posture,motor delays and other manifestations,Xifeng zhichan mixture significantly reduced the above-mentioned abnormal behavior. In model group,the membrane of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons was not continuous,Showing nuclear chromatin condensation,mitochondrial vacuolar degeneration or medullary change; and Golgi complex vesicles changed significantly,with reduced ribosomes. In addition,glial cells demonstrated marginalized nuclear and widened peri-nuclean gap,and a number of peri-cellnlar myelinated nerve fibers displayed stripped myelin sheaths. The pathological changes in the Chinese medicine-treated group was less serious than in model group. Conclusion:Xifeng zhichan mixture could remarkably improve the abnormal behavior of Parkinson's disease rat model and attenuate the ultra-structural pathological changes of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons and glial cells.",

Clinical features in some of the severe and fatal cases were analyzed the etiology of the outbreaks was investigated.89.1% of reported HFMD cases were found in children<5 year-old with an age-specific incidence rate of 834.1/100 000 in the first year as the notifiable disease in China from May 2008 to April 2009. The incidence, mortality and percentage of severe cases were studied for three regions of China and found to be highest in the central region. The incidence of severe cases and mortality in rural population were significantly higher than those in urban population. Among the laboratory confirmed EV17 positive cases there were 52.6% mild, 83.5% severe, and 96.1% fatal cases. More myoclonic jerks were found in the severe case group than in group that died. Tachypnea, lip purpling, pink foaming and low limb temperature occurred more frequently in the fatal cases than in the severe cases.The epidemic of HFMD in China was characterized predominantly by EV71 infections, had relatively high mortality rates especially in the central region, and was most prevalent in young, rural populations.",

According to the pyramid model of food-borne disease on disease burden, the local actual incidence of paratyphoid fever A was estimated and analyzed.Under the Fever Syndromic Surveillance System, there were 6642 fever cases being detected, among whom 6570 cases were sampled and undergone testing, with the sampling rate as 98.92% and all the samples received laboratory testing. There were 354 positive cases of paratyphoid fever A reported, all from the Hongta district. Data showed that the attendance rate of the feverish patients was 73.53%, with the highest rate seen in whose under 10 years old (100%). Assumed that the sensitivity of paratyphoid fever blood culture was 70%, and the case reporting rate was 90%, we estimated that the annual incidence of paratyphoid fever A in Hongta was 220.33 (95%CI: 170.1 - 521.4) per 100 thousand, with 965 (95%CI: 745 - 2284) as new cases. Among all the age groups, the incidence in the age group from 15 to 44 years old was estimated to be at the highest (318.27 per 100 thousand).Hongta seemed to be an endemic region for paratyphoid fever A, with the highest incidence occurred in the age group of between 15 and 44 years old. These findings highlighted the urgent need to carry out further investigation on the risk factors and to implement targeted effective prevention and control measures.",

The prevention and control of EV71 is a challenge currently because there is no safe and effective vaccine or antiviral medications available.A case control study was conducted in a designated hospital to compare severe and mild cases of patients infected with the EV71 virus. Demographic information along with clinical features of HFMD was collected through a standardized questionnaire. Multi-factorial logistic regression was used to analyze independent associations between potential risk factors and severe HFMD.There were 120 cases (60 cases and 60 controls) collected. The male-to-female ratio was 1.3: 1 in the case group and 1.7: 1 in the control group. Multi-factorial logistic regression revealed that the main risk factors for severe cases were highest body temperature being \u2265 38.5\u00b0C (OR = 9.45, 95% CI: 2.07-43.11, p < 0.05), first visited a village level clinic (OR = 4.72, 95% CI: 1.15-19.45, p < 0.05), etc.Close surveillance combined with laboratory testing should be in place during the epidemic period of HFMD. Grass root level medical facilities and training of clinical and laboratory staff should be reinforced so that the diagnostic and treatment capacity can be improved.",

        "abstract": "Objective To ascertain the prevalence of enterovirus carriers among healthy children under five years of age and their guardians in order to analyze the prevalence of virus carriers among healthy people and their role in the transmission of HFMD.Methods Fecal specimens were collected from children and their guardians by random sampling of urban nurseries and kindergartens and rural villages in Sishui County and Jiaxiang County in the early stages of an HFMD outbreak(March-April),at the peak of the outbreak(June-July),and in the later stages of the outbreak(October-November) in 2010.Enterovirus nucleic acids were detected by real-time PCR.Results The prevalence of enterovirus carriers among healthy people was 20.10% at the peak of the HFMD outbreak,14.56% in the early stages of the outbreak,and 8.29% in the later stages of the outbreak.The prevalence of enterovirus carriers was higher among children under five years of age than among adults.The highest prevalence of enterovirus carriers was among children under three years of age.According to real-time PCR,177 fecal specimens tested positive for human enteroviruses,and 99.44%(176/177) were identified as other enterovirus infections.None of the specimens tested positive for EV71,though one sample tested positive for CoxA16.Conclusion There was a considerable prevalence of enterovirus carriers among healthy children under five years of age and their guardians,and this was especially true in summer.There were rather low rates of positivity for EV71 and CoxA16.This means that healthy people who test positive for enterovirus nucleic acids may have nothing to do with the spread of HFMD.",

The notification rates were 50.09/10 million, 68.47/10 million and 59.04/10 million in high, medium and low latitudes areas, respectively. The epidemic periods in Medium and Low latitude were from 12 to 24 weeks in 2009, and in high latitude it was from 23 to 35 weeks. HFMD cases were concentrated mainly in 5 year-old or even younger children, accounted for 92.23% of the total cases. The incidence rate of two years old appeared to be the highest. The features of severe and death case concentrated in lower age groups were more evident, and the proportion of severe case and case fatality rate under 1 years old was higher than that in other age groups. We also noticed that with the increasing of age, the proportion of severe case and case fatality rate had a decreasing trend. There was a difference between the pathogens seen. The relative risk (RR) for an human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) isolate was higher among severe case than in common cases (RR = 1.82), whereas the RR for an EV71 isolate was higher among the death cases than in common cases (RR = 2.11). There was seasonal variation of pathogen composition. There were 477 clusters of cases from 2008 to 2009, of which 389 found in preschools, 47 in rural villages, outbreaks of clusters were mainly from April to July.The HFMD epidemics was increasing in 2009. The epidemic of HFMD in different latitudes area and seasons was different. Children of five year old or under were the major population groups at risk, of HFMD. The younger ones had higher risk of becoming severe and death cases. HEV71 and coxsackievirus A16 were both the major etiologic agents of HFMD. The preschool and rural villages were the main settings of clusters of cases.",

Methods Retrospective analysis of clinical data of 332 patients older than 75 years was done.The patients were divided into 2 groups:radial artery group and femoral artery group.Results Of the 332 patients,96 received PCI treatment.The rate of 3-vessel lesion was 39.7% and 47.4% and the rate of bifurcation lesion was 60.3% and 52.6% in radial artery group and femoral artery group respectively.Compared with radial artery group,the operation time was longer, peripheral vessel injury was significantly increased (P < 0.05),the postoperative observation time and bed-rest time were significantly prolonged,incidences of pseudoaneurysm and lower limb venous thrombosis were signifieantly increased,and incidence of punctured artery occlusion was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in femoral artery group.Conclusions Radial approach PCI in senile women with coronary heart disease reduced the vascular complications in high-risk population. PCI improves the long-term survival rate of patients and can be done in the elderly with low mortality rate and acceptable long-term outcomes.",

The angiographic characteristics and the long-term clinical follow-up results were compared between non-DM and DM patients.The follow-up period was (39.2 +/- 6.4) months (6 - 83 months), follow-up rate was 90.3% in DM and 91.0% in non-DM group (P > 0.05). Compared with non-diabetic patients, there were significantly higher incidences of 2-vessel (P = 0.029) and 3-vessel (P = 0.013) diseases of coronary artery, severe stenosis lesion (P = 0.012), chronic total obstructive lesion (P = 0.044) and long lesion (P = 0.001), in-stent restenosis (ISR, P = 0.000) and revascularization (P = 0.000) and MACE (P = 0.000) in DM patients. COX multiple factorial analysis showed that DM is independent risk factor for ISR (P = 0.000), revascularization (P = 0.001) and MACE (P = 0.003).CHD patients with type 2 DM are associated with multi- and more severe vessel lesions. Type 2 DM is also an independent risk factor for increased ISR, revascularization and MACE post stenting.",

The diagnostic criteria of Fabry's disease was based on alpha-galactosidase (alpha-GAL) quantity in white blood cells.All of the patients were female. Their age was from 41 to 57. Two of them had the typical symptoms of Fabry's disease in their young age. All of them had family history of the disease and cardiac symptoms. ECG showed ST-T change and echocardiography showed hypertrophy of left ventricule of different degrees. Their alpha-galactosidase level in white blood cells was lower than normal. The alpha-galactosidase level in patient 1 was the lowest. Her cardiac symptoms were most serious in the three patients and she had involvement of other organs.Patients with Fabry's disease may have cardiac manifestations.

All patients were administered with aspirin and clopidogrel before and after the procedures. Follow-up was made by telephone or interview, 102 out of 410 patients were followed up by angiography.The procedure success rate was 99.5%. Stent thrombosis occurred in one patient during the procedure and one sudden death developed 10 hours after the procedure in hospital. The major adverse cardiac event (MACE, including death, acute myocardial infarction and target lesion revascularization) rate during hospitalization was 0.2% (1/410). The MACE rate was 4.3% (16/376) and the stent thrombosis rate was 1.1% (4/376) during clinical follow-up of 376 patients (12.8 +/- 3.2 months). The angiographic restenosis rate in 102 patients with 122 lesions was 9.8% (12/122).Firebird drug-eluting stent could be used safely and effectively in patient with coronary heart disease.",

The changes on cardiac function, flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) of brachial artery, plasma TNF-alpha level, liver and kidney function were observed.In Pra treated patients, FMD of brachial artery significantly increased after 3 months treatments and NYHA stage significantly improved, plasma BNP, TNF-alpha levels and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension significantly decreased, LVEF significantly increased significantly 6 months post therapy compared to baseline (all P < 0.01). In control group, the patients' NYHA stage also significantly improved (P < 0.05) and LVEF tended to be higher (P = 0.052) while FMD, plasma BNP and TNF-alpha levels remained unchanged at 6 months post therapy compared to baseline. In Pra group, the level of TC (P < 0.05) and LDL-C (P = 0.051) also significantly decreased while HDL-C remained unchanged 6 months post therapy. One patient in Pra group discontinued the study drug because of anaphylaxis. No event on liver and kidney dysfunction was noticed.Pravastatin was effective and safe in treating non-ischemic heart failure patients and can significantly improve left ventricular remodeling, endothelial and cardiac functions as well as reduce the levels of inflammatory factors.",

There was 1 chronic heart failure patient and renal function was normal in all patients. Multivessel diseases and complex coronary lesions including total occlusion lesions, bifurcation lesions and long lesions were seen in these patients. The mean release pressure of stents was (11.60 +/- 1.65) atm and with no high-pressure dilation after the procedure. The median time of dual antiplatelet therapy was (157.5 +/- 41.7) days. The mean duration from SESs implantation to thrombosis was (450.3 +/- 344.7) days. LST developed in 2 patients with active dual antiplatelet therapy, 1 patient at 7 days and 5 patients at 6 months after clopidogrel withdraw, 5 patients presented nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, 1 patient died of acute myocardial infarction after coronary artery bypass grafting. Five patients were successfully treated with second SESs implantations and another one was treated medically.LST could be safe and effective treated with re-SESs. The development of LST after successful SESs implantation were probably associated with the following factors: (1) acute coronary syndrome with multiple risk factors of cardiovascular diseases and multivessel diseases with complex coronary lesions. (2) Low-pressure deployment without high-pressure dilation after the release. (3) Dual antiplatelet therapy withdraw.",

Method: From May 14th to June 24th, the hospital set up triage spots originally and dealt with the wounded based on their specific conditions in different stages and optimized the flow of admission of the wounded. Owing to correctly treating the wound and screening the skeptical gas gangrene patients, preventing nosocomial infections was shifted forward. Sprending the gas gangrene wound after having flushed it with 3% H 2O 2. If the wound have been stitched, the stitches should bee taken out, and open the wound and take the debridement for it completely, then treat it with strong antibacterial after debridement by sterilization and isolation about operation of gas gangrene. Result: Up to June 24th, none of 67 cases of doubtful gas gangrene from the disaster area died and no hospital cross infections happened in courtyard. At present, amomg the 67 cases, 32 were highly suspected of gas gangrene infection, 26 cases were discharged, while 6 cases were undergoing treatment in the hospital. Conclusion: Correct management and appropriate treatment are effective ways for controlling hospital cross infection to the skeptical gas gangrene patients. \u00a9 2008 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of predefined interventions(bundle) to staff training in improving the quality of care of the patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia so as to adherence to guidelines to avoid complications associated with mechanical ventilation.METHODS This study was performed on a 52-bed intensive care unit in a university teaching hospital with 4500 beds.The application of a ventilator bundle consisting of semirecumbent positioning,Chlorhexidine oral rinse,ulcer prophylaxis,and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis(DVTP) were assessed before and after the staff training.RESULTS A total of 635 patients were enrolled in the study before the personnel training,and 582 patients were enrolled after the personnel training.The overall bundle adherence increased from 16.5% to 33.8%(P< 0.001).The difference in the elevated angle of semirecumbent position between before and after the personnel training was statistically significant(P<0.01);the implementation rate of Chlorhexidine oral rinse for once per 6 hours was 30.1% before the personnel training,80.7% after the personnel training(P<0.05);the rate of evaluating the necessity of application of indwelling ventilator was 61.6% before the personnel training,89.3 after the personnel training(P<0.05);the implementation rate of the ulcer prophylaxis increased from 85.5% to 90.4%(P=0.048),the rates of prevention of ulcer were more than 88.0% in both of the two groups;the duration of mechanical ventilation reduced from 10 days-(interquartile range 2-20 d) to 7 days(interquartile range 2-10)(P=0.021).The incidence of VAP,length of ICU stay,and the mortality in ICU remained unaffected. CONCLUSION Despite incomplete implementation of bundle interventions to prevent VAP,the staff training in the ICU has improved the compliance of bundle and has reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation.",

Method: The data of the patients' admission and hospital transferring in the West China Hospital were collected after the earthquake in two weeks. Moreover, the reason and the method of the hospital transferring were analyzed. Result: In the first two weeks since the earthquake struck Wenchuan, the number of the available bed for earthquake patients in West China Hospital was 124 per day, but in the 2 227 earthquake patients treated, 1 181 patients were admitted. Comparing with the number of the total hospitalized, the percentage is 53.03%. The hospital was overloaded. After a reasonable hospital transference, the daily number of inpatients was stable and all the patients were treated sufficiently. Conclusion: After a natural disaster, an effective administration transferring patients to suitable medical recourse should be performed, so that more right treatments should be given to more right patients in the right time and right place. \u00a9 2008 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med.",

Methods Traumatic types and conditions of the wounded admitted by the Department of Emergency of West China Hospital within 3 weeks after Wenchuan earthquake, were collected. The characteristics of the wounded transferred by ambulances and helicopters were analyzed. Results Of the 2 338 wounded, ambulances transferred the most accounting for 60.56%, helicopter transferred 13.47%, and the other transport modes took up 25.96%. As for the macrotraumas, ambulances transferred more than helicopter and other transport mode did (P<0.05), while there was no statistical significance between helicopters and other transport modes (P>0.05). Conclusion After the disaster, a field first-aid command system should be immediately established, casualties should be triaged concisely, an appropriate transference mode should be decided according to the degree of injuries and sufficient rescue materials should be provided based on different transference modes.",

        "abstract": "To clone the E4 gene (E4) from human papillomavirus type 16(HPV-16), construct the engineering bacteria of prokaryotic expression, and explore the expression conditions and the characters of expression product.The complete E4 gene was cloned by PCR from the sample cell extract of clinical cervical disease that was the positive HPV-16 confirmed by Real-PCR. The E4 DNA fragment was inserted into the pET32a(+) to construct a prokaryotic expression plasmid, called as pET32/E4. Then the expression plasmids were transferred into competent E. coli BL21 (DE3). Recombinant DNA was identified by Bgl II and Hind III digestion, and then sequencing. The recombine bacterium, BL21/E4, was induced with different IPTG concentrations at different temperatures. The expressed proteins were checked and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Gel-Pro Analyzer 4. His-tag of BL21/E4 expression protein was hybridized to McAb.The E4 gene cloned by PCR was about 342 bp. The blasted result showed that the E4 gene had 99% homology of HVP-16 DNA sequence, the cloned E4 gene expression frame was the same as HVP-16 East Asia strain's. Compared with other HPV-16 strains in GenBank, the homology of E4 gene was above 97%. pET32/E4 could express recombinant E4 (rE4) in BL21. The highest expression, which was 12.2% or 12.8% of total bacterial proteins respectively, was gotten when BL21/E4 was induced by 0.1 mmol/L IPTG at 28 degrees C or 37 degrees C for 18 hours. The results of SDS-PAGE and Western blot showed the rE4 was expressed mainly to form the inclusion body, and to fuse with his-tag (rE4/His), that was soluble and had a molecular weight as about 34 KDa.We cloned successfully the E4 gene from HPV-16 and constructed the prokaryotic expression E. coli BL21/E4, which could expression rE4 protein fused with his-tag (rE4/His), effectively. The fused protein could react to McAb recognizing His-tag, which was convenience purified by affinity chromatography. The above research results built a good foundation for preparing the high grade of purity E4 protein and developing the relative study.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To construct the prokaryotic expression plasmid pET32/E7 and express the human papillomavirus type 16 E7 protein in E. coli. Methods: HPV16 E7 gene was amplified by PCR. The amplified E7 fragment was inserted into the plasmid pET32a (+) that was digested with BamH I and Hind III. The recombinant plasmid pET32/E7 was transformed into E. coli JM109 which was selected with ampicillin. The positive clones containing recombinant plasmid pET32/E7 were verified by BamH I and Xho I digestion, and then sequenced. HPV16 E7-TRX recombinant protein expression in the E. coli BL21(ED3) was identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Results: The prokaryotic recombinant plasmid pET32/E7 was successfully constructed. The BL21(DE3) transformed recombinant plasmid pET32/E7 had expressed HPV16 E7-TRX recombinant protein effectively. Under the conditions of 1 mmol/L IPTG and 30 \u00b0C, the amount of HPV16 E7-TRX recombinant protein was about 30% of bacterial total proteins. Conclusion: The construction of the prokaryotic recombinant plasmid pET32/E7 and the successful expression of the recombinant protein HPV16 E7-TRX would strongly promote the research of the biological properties and the transformational mechanism of the HPV16 E7 protein on the specific cells.",

        "abstract": "Schistosomiasis is an important parasitic disease for which there is no available vaccine. We have focused on a functionally important antigen of Schistosoma mansoni, Sm-p80, as a vaccine candidate because of its consistent immunogenicity, protective potential and antifecundity effect observed in murine models; and for its pivotal role in the immune evasion process. In the present study we report that an Sm-p80-based DNA vaccine formulation confers 38% reduction in worm burden in a nonhuman primate model, the baboon (Papio anubis). Animals immunized with Sm-p80-pcDNA3 exhibited a decrease in egg production by 32%. Sm-p80 DNA elicited specific immune responses that include IgG; its subtypes IgG1 and IgG2; and IgM in vaccinated animals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from immunized animals when stimulated in vitro with Sm-p80 produced appreciably more Th1 response enhancing cytokines (IL-2, IFN-gamma) than Th2 response enhancing cytokines (IL-4, IL-10). PBMCs produced appreciably more spot-forming units for INF-gamma than for IL-4 in enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays. Overall it appears that even though a mixed (Th1/Th2) type of humoral antibody response was generated following immunization with Sm-p80; the dominant protective immune response is Th1 type. These data reinforce the potential of Sm-p80 as an excellent vaccine candidate for schistosomiasis.",

        "abstract": "Schistosomiasis remains a major global health problem. Despite large-scale schistosomiasis control efforts, clear limitations such as possible emergence of drug resistance and reinfection rates highlight the need for an effective schistosomiasis vaccine. Schistosoma mansoni large subunit of calpain (Sm-p80)-based vaccine formulations have shown remarkable efficacy in protecting against S. mansoni challenge infections in mice and baboons. In this study, we evaluated the cross-species protective efficacy of Sm-p80 vaccine against S. japonicum and S. haematobium challenge infections in rodent models. We also elucidated the expression of Sm-p80 and Sm-p80 ortholog proteins in different developmental stages of S. mansoni, S. haematobium, and S. japonicum. Immunization with Sm-p80 vaccine reduced worm burden by 46.75% against S. japonicum challenge infection in mice. DNA prime/protein boost (1\u00a0+\u00a01 dose administered on a single day) resulted in 26.95% reduction in worm burden in S. haematobium-hamster infection/challenge model. A balanced Th1 (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, and IL-12) and Th2 (IL-4, IgG1) type of responses were observed following vaccination in both S. japonicum and S. haematobium challenge trials and these are associated with the prophylactic efficacy of Sm-p80 vaccine. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that Sm-p80/Sm-p80 ortholog proteins are expressed in different life cycle stages of the three major human species of schistosomes studied. The data presented in this study reinforce the potential of Sm-p80-based vaccine for both hepatic/intestinal and urogenital schistosomiasis occurring in different geographical areas of the world. Differential expression of Sm-p80/Sm-p80 protein orthologs in different life cycle makes this vaccine potentially useful in targeting different levels of infection, disease, and transmission.",

Consensus is developing now that ideal control methods of the disease should be based on an integrated approach incorporating drug treatment, sanitation improvement, education, and an effective vaccine. With regards to the vaccine development, Sm-p80 has been shown to be a promising and strong immunogenic vaccine candidate. In the present study, Sm-p80-based vaccine formulated in alum was tested for its prophylactic efficacy in a mouse model. It was observed that vaccination using heterologous prime boost (DNA prime followed by boost with protein formulated in alum) and homologous prime boost (both prime and boost with protein formulated in alum) approaches, resulted in 61% and 55% reduction in worm burden, respectively. The protection was directly correlated with the induction of high titers of antibody responses that mainly included IgG, its isotypes, and IgM. In addition, both of the immunization approaches triggered a mixed Th1 and Th2 type response. Some involvement of Th17 specific immune response was also detected as indicated by the up-regulation of relevant cytokines. These results reinforce the potential of Sm-p80 as a viable vaccine candidate.",

        "abstract": "Schistosomiasis is an important public health concern in more than 76 developing countries. Advent of an anti-schistosome vaccine would undoubtedly add to the existing control measures and may eventually help in the elimination of this disease. In the present study we have attempted to dissect the role(s) of antibodies in Sm-p80 mediated protection by intravenously transferring pooled sera from mice immunized with Sm-p80-pcDNA3 or purified IgG from baboons immunized with Sm-p80-pcDNA3, into na\u00efve C57BL/6 mice, respectively, prior to challenge with cercariae. The passive transfer of antibodies from protected mice (homologous transfers) as well as transfer of total IgG from baboons (heterologous transfers), into na\u00efve mice showed statistically significant reductions in worm burden and in the number of eggs in the tissues. Immunizations of antibody knockout mice (\u03bcMt-/-; B10.129S2 (B6)-Igh-6(tm1Cgn)/J) with recombinant Sm-p80 in the presence of CpG-motif oligodeoxynucleotides as an adjuvant, resulted in substantial reduction of Sm-p80-mediated protection, compared to C57BL/6 (normal) control group of mice. Down regulation of cytokines that have important effects on B cell proliferation as well as the recovery of higher number of parasites in antibody knockout indicated a significant role(s) of antibodies in Sm-p80-mediated protection against Schistosoma mansoni in mice. In toto, these studies appear to suggest that antibodies play a significant role in Sm-p80 mediated protection.",

        "abstract": "To determine the prophylactic efficacy of an Sm-p80-based vaccine formulation against challenge infection with Schistosoma mansoni in mice using an approach comprising of initial priming with DNA and boosting with recombinant protein in the presence of resiquimod (R848) as an adjuvant.In the first experiment (prime-boost approach), mice were primed with Sm-p80-pcDNA3 (week 0) and boosted at weeks 4 and 8 with recombinant Sm-p80 formulated in resiquimod (R848). Each mouse in the control group first received only pcDNA3 and was boosted with R848. In the second set of experiments (recombinant protein approach), mice were immunized (week 0) and boosted (weeks 4 and 8) with rSm-p80 formulated in R848. Animals of the control group in this series of experiments received only R848 at 0, 4, and 8 weeks. All of the animals from both the 'prime-boost' and 'recombinant protein' groups were challenged with cercariae of S. mansoni, 4 weeks after the last immunization. The mice were sacrificed 6 weeks post-challenge and the reductions in worm burden and egg production were determined. Sm-p80-specific antibody titers were estimated in the mice sera by ELISA. Cytokine mRNA and protein production by proliferating splenocytes in response to in vitro stimulation with Sm-p80, were estimated via RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively.Vaccination with Sm-p80 (prime-boost approach) showed 49% reduction in worm burden; with the recombinant protein approach the protection was found to be 50%. The protection levels were correlated with antibody production. Upon antigenic stimulation with recombinant Sm-p80, splenocytes secreted significant levels of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and interleukin (IL)-2, indicating that the immune responses were Th1-biased and this was further supported in terms of distribution of antibody isotypes and mRNA expression of cytokines.In conclusion the present study clearly demonstrates that Sm-p80 consistently maintained its protective nature, and resiquimod as an immunopotentiating agent slightly boosted the protective effects of Sm-p80 in both 'DNA prime-protein boost' and 'recombinant protein' immunization approaches in a murine model.",

        "abstract": "Schistosomiasis remains a serious chronic debilitating hepato-intestinal disease. Current control measures based on mass drug administration are inadequate due to sustained re-infection rates, low treatment coverage and emergence of drug resistance. Hence, there is an urgent need for a schistosomiasis vaccine for disease control. In this study, we assessed the anti-pathology efficacy of Schistosoma mansoni large subunit of calpain (Sm-p80)-based vaccine against schistosomiasis caused by infections with Schistosoma mansoni in baboons. We also evaluated the disease transmission-blocking potential of Sm-p80 vaccine. Immunisations with Sm-p80-based vaccine resulted in significant reduction of hepatic egg load in vaccinated baboons (67.7% reduction, p\u00a0= 0.0032) when compared to the control animals, indicative of reduction in pathology. There was also a significant reduction in sizes of egg-induced granulomas in baboons immunised with Sm-p80 vaccine compared to their control counterparts. Egg hatching rate analysis revealed an overall 85.6% reduction (p\u00a0= 0.0018) in vaccinated animals compared to the controls, highlighting the potential role of Sm-p80 vaccine in disease transmission. The findings on anti-pathology efficacy and transmission-blocking potential presented in this study have formed the basis for a large-scale double-blinded baboon experiment that is currently underway.",

        "abstract": "Sm-p80-based vaccine efficacy for Schistosoma mansoni was evaluated in a baboon model of infection and disease. The study was designed to replicate a human vaccine implementation scenario for endemic regions in which vaccine would be administered following drug treatment of infected individuals. In our study, the Sm-p80-based vaccine reduced principal pathology producing hepatic egg burdens by 38.0% and egg load in small and large intestines by 72.2% and 49.4%, respectively, in baboons. Notably, hatching rates of eggs recovered from liver and small and large intestine of vaccinated animals were significantly reduced, by 60.4%, 48.6%, and 82.3%, respectively. Observed reduction in egg maturation/hatching rates was supported by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy showing unique differences in Sm-p80 expression in worms of both sexes and matured eggs. Vaccinated baboons had a 64.5% reduction in urine schistosome circulating anodic antigen, a parameter that reflects worm numbers/health status in infected hosts. Preliminary analyses of RNA sequencing revealed unique genes and canonical pathways associated with establishment of chronic disease, praziquantel-mediated parasite killing, and Sm-p80-mediated protection in vaccinated baboons. Overall, our study demonstrated efficacy of the Sm-p80 vaccine and provides insight into some of the epistatic interactions associated with protection.",

The prophylactic and antifecundity efficacy of Sm-p80 has been tested in three animal models (mouse, hamster and baboon) using a multitude of vaccine formulations and approaches. In our continual effort to enhance the vaccine efficacy, in this study, we have utilized the adjuvant, synthetic hexa-acylated lipid A derivative, glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA) formulated in aluminum (GLA-Alum) with recombinant Sm-p80. The rSm-p80+GLA-Alum immunization regimen provided 33.33%-53.13% reduction in worm burden in the mouse model and 38% worm burden reduction in vaccinated baboons. Robust Sm-p80-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgG1, IgG2a and IgM responses were observed in all immunized animals. The rSm-p80+GLA-Alum coadministration induced a mix of T-helper (Th) cells (Th1, Th2 and Th17) responses as determined via the release of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-18, IL-21, IL-22 and interferon-\u03b3.",

        "abstract": "Schistosomiasis is of public health importance to an estimated one billion people in 79 countries. A vaccine is urgently needed. Here, we report the results of four independent, double-blind studies of an Sm-p80-based vaccine in baboons. The vaccine exhibited potent prophylactic efficacy against transmission of Schistosoma mansoni infection and was associated with significantly less egg-induced pathology, compared with unvaccinated control animals. Specifically, the vaccine resulted in a 93.45% reduction of pathology-producing female worms and significantly resolved the major clinical manifestations of hepatic/intestinal schistosomiasis by reducing the tissue egg-load by 89.95%. A 35-fold decrease in fecal egg excretion in vaccinated animals, combined with an 81.51% reduction in hatching of eggs into the snail-infective stage (miracidia), demonstrates the parasite transmission-blocking potential of the vaccine. Substantially higher Sm-p80 expression in female worms and Sm-p80-specific antibodies in vaccinated baboons appear to play an important role in vaccine-mediated protection. Preliminary analyses of RNA sequencing revealed distinct molecular signatures of vaccine-induced effects in baboon immune effector cells. This study provides comprehensive evidence for the effectiveness of an Sm-p80-based vaccine for schistosomiasis.",

        "abstract": "Schistosomiasis is a neglected parasitic disease of major public health concern as it affects over 250 million people in developing countries. Currently there is no licensed vaccine available against schistosomiasis. The Schistosoma mansoni calpain protein, Sm-p80, is a leading vaccine candidate now ready to move to clinical trials. In order to better assess Sm-p80 vaccine immunogenicity; here we used a systems biology approach employing RNA-sequencing to identify gene signatures and epistatic interactions following Sm-p80 vaccination in mouse and baboon models that may predict vaccine efficacy. Recombinant Sm-p80 + CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) vaccine formulation induced both cellular and humoral immunity genes with a predominant TH1 response as well as TH2 and TH17 gene signatures. Early gene responses and gene-network interactions in mice immunized with rSm-p80 + ODN appear to be initiated through TLR4 signaling. CSF genes, S100A alarmin genes and TNFRSF genes appear to be a signature of vaccine immunogenicity/efficacy as identified by their participation in gene network interactions in both mice and baboons. These gene families may provide a basis for predicting desirable outcomes for vaccines against schistosomiasis leading to a better understanding of the immune system response to vaccination.",

        "abstract": "In January 2008, southern China suffered an unusual heavy snowstorm and freezing rain over a large area for almost a month long. This catastrophic event was the worst one in past 50 years, which brought the area a serious impact on the infrastructure, ecology, and environment. To understand the long-term impact of this catastrophic event on the forest ecosystems in this area, a field investigation was conducted on the soil fauna in a pure Chinese fir plantation and a mixed Chinese fir plantation-alder plantation in Huitong County of Hunan Province on March 23, 2008, the date 40 days after the heavy snowstorm and freezing rain. With the abundance and community composition as the main parameters and the monitoring data from the two plantations on March 23, 2007 as the reference, the flexibility and resistance of soil fauna to the disturbances of the catastrophic event was preliminarily evaluated. The results showed that there was a significant deviation of soil fauna communities in the two plantations from the reference. An outbreak increase in microfauna nematode abundance was found from 12216.9 ind x m(-2) to 118343.9 ind x m(-2) in pure Chinese fir plantation and from 25435.9 ind x m(-2) to 84573.0 ind x m(-2) in mixed Chinese fir plantation-alder plantation, while a 27.0% and 85.6% decrease of macrofauna abundance was found in the two plantations, respectively, compared with the reference. Mesofauna abundance also had a significant decrease in litter layer but not in soil. The abundance recovery displayed a trend from quick rate for microfauna to slow rate for macrofauna, which indicated that the soil fauna functional groups, in terms of body size, could be used as a vulnerable indicator in evaluating disturbance event and post-disturbance recovery. By using community ordinations, no shift in soil fauna community composition was detected 40 days after the catastrophic event, suggesting that the community composition of soil invertebrate had a high resistance to catastrophic snowstorm and freezing rain disturbances.",

The decomposition rate of SOC in 40-45 cm layer was significantly lower than that in 0-5 cm layer, but the priming effect induced by the Chinese fir litter addition showed an opposite trend. The Chinese fir litter addition increased the soil total microbial biomass carbon and the microbial biomass carbon derived from native soil significantly, but had less effects on the soil dissolved organic carbon. Turning over the subsoil to the surface of the woodland could accelerate the soil carbon loss in Chinese fir plantation due to the priming effect induced by the litters.",

In the treatment amended with C. lancceolata litter, the soil basal respiration and qCO 2 decreased significantly ( P < 0.05 ), whereas soil microbial biomass C, total organic C, and microbial quotient had less change. A significant interaction between C. lancceolata root system and litter was observed on soil basal respiration and qCO 2. The qCO 2 had significant positive correlations with soil total organic C ( R 2 =0.209 ) and dissolved organic C ( R 2 =0.325), suggesting that the C use efficiency of soil microbes decreased with increasing soil organic C content.

        "abstract": "Based on the field investigation data,this paper analyzed the carbon storage and carbon density in the secondary forests under closing hillsides to facilitate afforestation,secondary forests,and plantation forests in Hubei Province.The mean carbon storage of the tree layers in the secondary forests under closing hillsides to facilitate afforestation,secondary forests,and plantation forests was 133.87,73.42 and 111.62 t\u00b7hm-2,the mean carbon storage of shrub layers was 1.65,1.40 and 1.52 t\u00b7hm-2,the mean carbon storage of herb layers was 0.13,0.09 and 0.13 t\u00b7hm-2,and the mean carbon storage of litter layers was 0.47,1.34 and 0.93 t\u00b7hm-2,respectively.With the largest share in trunk,the carbon stored in tree layers was the main contributor to the ecosystem C storage,accounting for 98.35%,96.29% and 97.74% of the total biomass C in the secondary forests under closing hillsides to facilitate afforestation,secondary forests,and plantation forests,while the carbon storage in understory vegetation(shrub + herb) and litters had the least share,accounting for 1.31%,1.95%,1.44% and 0.34%,1.76% and 0.82%,respectively.The soil carbon storage decreased with depth,and 60% of the total was accumulated in 0-40 cm layer.The carbon density in 0-100 cm soil of the secondary forests under closing hillsides to facilitate afforestation,secondary forests,and plantation forests was averagely 57.04,66.92 and 54.12 t\u00b7hm-2,respectively,and also decreased with increasing depth.The biomass and the soil carbon storage were larger in the secondary forests under closing hillsides to facilitate afforestation and the secondary forests than in the plantation forests,and the carbon density was in the order of soil(0-100 cm) > tree layer > shrub layer > herb layer > litter layer,indicating that secondary forests under closing hillsides to facilitate afforestation was more helpful to improve forest carbon sink,and the implement of near-nature forest management would be the main approach in promoting the carbon sequestration capacity of forest ecosystems in this region.",

The litter mass of the plantations varied obviously with season,and affected by species characteristics and climate. There was a lag effect of climate on litter mass. The nutrient concentrations in each litter component had an obvious seasonal variation,with the difference reached more than one-fold. With increasing stand age,the K return through litterfall decreased,while the other nutrients return showed \u2018V\u2019 shape. The stand at age 51 had higher nutrient use efficiency. Litterfall played an important role in maintaining stand fertility. Litter output,especially for fallen needles,would cut the key link of biogeochemical cycle,aggravate the nutrient deficiency of soil,and lead to the decrease of stand productivity. Therefore,in the management of Masson pine plantation,litter output should be reduced as possible to maintain the long-term productivity of the site.",

The results showed that 1 ) nutrient accumulation was not synchronized with biomass accumulation, with the accumulation rate of biomass being 3. 3, 5. 4, 3. 3, 3. 7, and 9. 8 times of that of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg from age 17 to 51, respectively, 2) nutrient allocation to a specific component was related to the growth rate of the nutrient pool in the component, and the nutrient allocation to stem as well as the ratio of nutrient allocation to root/shoot increased with plantation age, and 3) the biomass production per unit nutrient, i. e., nutrient use efficiency, and the nutrient cycling coefficient also increased with plantation age, being higher for 51 -year-old plantation than for younger plantations, suggesting that shortening the rotation length could reduce the possibility to raise the nutrient use efficiency. It was suggested that both extending the cuixent rotation length to as long as 50 years and reducing the harvest intensity could be helpful to conserve the nutrients and to maintain long-term productivity.",

        "abstract": "Based on the over 30 years observation data in Huitong National Research Station of Forest Ecosystem under Chinese Academy of Sciences and related literatures, this paper analyzed the dynamics of the biomass- and nutrient accumulation and allocation in a Chinese-fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantation, and the effects of rotation length and harvest intensity on the nutrient input/output. The results showed that stand age was the main factor affecting the biomass- and nutrient accumulation and allocation, and different organs had significant differences in their biomass- and nutrient storage. Stand age and different organs explained 37. 1 % and 40. 3 % of the variations of biomass- and nutrient storage, respectively. With the increase of stand age, the proportions of biomass and nutrients allocated to stem increased, while those allocated to foliage decreased. The accumulation rates of biomass and nutrients peaked at the age of 17 and 13, respectively, indicating that the nutrients reached their maximum accumulation rate ahead of the biomass. The nutrient requirement per unit dry biomass production decreased rapidly from the stand age 3 to 20 and reached a steady state after then, suggesting that the nutrient use efficiency increased with stand age. The analysis of different harvest scenarios showed that to prolong rotation length and to lower utilization intensity could reduce nutrient output. For example, if the rotation length was prolonged from 28 years to 56 years and only stem was harvested, the harvested biomass would be decreased by 31. 57% , and the output of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg would be decreased by 42. 02% , 58. 93% , 27. 70% , 31. 07% , and 45. 26% , respectively.",

TN from incoming water of Shaanxi Province accounted for 68.2% of total amount of TN,while the contributing of rivers entries in Hubei to TN were as Du River 18%,Shending River 7%,Si River 4%,Guanshan River 0.9%,Lang River 0.7%,Jian River 0.5% and Tian River 0.5%. Monthly changes of TN concentrations were consistent with the incoming water quantity. TN amount in reservoir was mainly concentrated between May and September,which accounted for 77% of the whole year. According to environmental capacity and pollutant carrying characteristics,rivers flowing into the reservoir can be divided to four types including capacity pollution,point source pollution,agricultural non -point source pollution and combined pollution.

The independent risk factors for NP were analyzed by using case-control study method and logistic regression technique. The time-specific rates for NP and risk factor exposure were calculated annually.The infection rates for NP were decreased by 50% from 1.20% in 1993 to 0.60% in 2000. The logistic regression analysis showed that the independent risk factors for NP were immunosuppressive therapy (OR = 2.72), chemotherapy (OR = 2.17), cancer (OR = 1.45), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, OR = 1.88), ICU (OR = 3.18), coma (OR = 3.26), tracheotomy (OR = 14.95), hemodialysis (OR = 5.12), bone or lumbar puncture (OR = 1.82). The time-trends for exposure rates of COPD and bone or lumbar puncture were slightly decreased, however those for the others and the synthetic risk factors were not changed significantly.The infection rates for NP were significantly decreased in the case of no change for exposure rates of risk factors for NP, this suggests that the nosocomial infection surveillance and control programs were effective for lowering infection rate for NP in this hospital.",

Data were collected by questionnaire, physical examination and laboratory examination. Logistic regression was used to analyze the independent risk factors for dyslipidemia.Results:A total of 984 individuals were participated in the study. The crude prevalence of dyslipidemia was 31.91% (29.34% for men and 33.74% for women,respectively) and the age-adjusted prevalence was 28.51%. Data indicated that the prevalence of dyslipedemia increased significantly with age,and the prevalence rates for 18~, 35~, 50~, and 65~ years old were 20.37%, 31.12%, 35.09% and 39.85% respectively. Results of Logistic regression showed that central obesity, increased blood pressure and elevated fasting plasma glucose were independent risk factors for dyslipidemia after adjusted for sex, age, martial status, education status,and income status.Conclusion:Higher level of dyslipidemia prevalence is found in Henan rural communities. Control of waist circumference, blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose levels within normal ranges may prevent the occurrence of dyslipidemia.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To study the distributions and secular trends of nosocomial infection incidence rates in surgical cuts in a hospital. METHODS Nosocomial infection of surgical cuts in hospitalized patients in a hospital was monitored by prospective investigation from 1993 to 2000. RESULTS Totally 47133 hospitalized patients who had operations were surveyed from 1993 to 2000.There were 1029 nosocomial infections in surgical cuts among the hospitalized patients with the surveillance,and the total nosocomial infection incidence rates in surgical cuts were 2.18%.The nosocomial infection incidence rates in surgical cuts in different age groups of infant,preschool child,adolescent,adult,and elderly were 0.00%, 2.01%,1.96%,1.88%,and 3.01%,respectively.Most of patients who had operations were in departments of surgery,gynecology,obstetrics,and ENT.The same rates in surgical cuts in those four departments were 3.57%,1.05%,0.52%,and 0.43%,respectively,and in spring,summer,autumn,and winter were 2.02%,2.82%,1.94%,1.99%,respectively.The nosocomial infection incidence rates in surgical cuts in clean cuts,clean-contaminated cuts,and contaminated cuts were 1.23%,2.99%,and 5.80%,respectively.The nosocomial infection incidence rates in surgical cuts among different sub-population of gender,age,and departments except of pediatrics,gynecology and obstetrics had downward trends.The nosocomial infection incidence rates in surgical cuts in four seasons except of winter had downward trend.While the proportions of type of cuts were significant different,there were downward trend in the nosocomial infection incidence rates in surgical cuts. CONCLUSIONS The nosocomial infection incidence rates in surgical cuts in different sub-population are significantly uncommon.The total nosocomial infection incidence rates in surgical cuts are decreased.The decrease in the nosocomial infection incidence rates in surgical cuts is caused by the decrease in the nosocomial infection incidence rates in surgical cuts among different sub-population.The nosocomial infection rate in surgical cut is declined effectively by the Nosocomial Infection Surveillance and Control opened up in 1993.",

A case-control study was conducted including 175 cases of IFG,111 cases of T2DM,and 692 individuals with normal fasting glucose.Results:Overall obesity was associated with IFG,the odds ratio adjusted (aOR) for gender,age,education level,marital status and average monthly individual income level was 1.68 (95% CI was 1.02~2.75). However,central obesity was associated with T2DM,the aOR was 2.58 (95% CI was 1.63~4.09).There was no significant difference among different groups for the proportion of hypertension (P>0.05).Total cholesterol and triglycerides levels were positively related with the development of IFG and T2DM,the aOR and 95% CI was 1.73(1.19~2.52),1.52(1.04~2.22),and 1.74(1.13~2.70),1.90(1.22~2.95). 86.86% of IFG individuals and 89.19% of T2DM cases had at least one metabolic disorder component compared to 70.81% in controls(P<0.05). The aOR of IFG participants who had three metabolic disorder components was 2.30 (95% CI was 1.13~4.69),and the aOR of T2DM cases was 2.81 (95% CI was 1.18~6.69).Conclusion:Obesity and dyslipidemia are associated with IFG and T2DM. There is cluster of metabolic disorder components in IFG and T2DM participants.

Methods:The genome diversity of Hp gene was tested by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technology and vacA,cagA,cagE,cagT were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). VacA expression was detected using Hela cells cultured with Hp extract. Data were analyzed by cluster method. Results: Neither RAPD nor PCR showed that the genotypes of Hp had relationship with different diseases (P=0.068 5, P=0.268 5). However, combining the results of RAPD and PCR, all Hp strains of 3 groups (chronic gastritis group, peptic ulcer group, other disease group) were classified into 3 genotypes. Each group had its own dominant genotype. Statistical significance of genotypes distribution among them was observed (P=0.006 7). VacA expression showed no significant variation among 3 genotypes (P=0.265 5). Conclusion: It indicates that there is certain relationship between disease types and Hp genotypes, and vacA, cagA, cagE, cagT can be taken as ideal indexes for gene typing for Hp. RAPD is an effective method for genome DNA diversity detection.",

The nosocomial infection incidence in urinary tract from 1993 to 2000 were 0.63%,0.44%,0.29%,0.41%,0.23%,0.21%,0.21%,0.13% and there was a downward trend. The nosocomial infection incidence in urinary tract in the department of urinary surgery, department of surgery, department of internal medicine, department of gynaecology,department of obstetrics,department of pediatrics,and department of otolaryngology were 1.79%,0.43%,0.29%,0.62%,0.11%, 0.11%, and 0.02%. The incidence had downward trends in the department of urinary surgery, department of internal medicine, department of surgery, and department of gynaecology.The nosocomial infection incidence in urinary tract in male and female were 0.29%,and 0.31%,respectively and there was downward trends with time in both males and females. The nosocomial infection incidence in urinary tract in the infants, children before school, the young ,the adult, and the elder were 0.00%,0.18%,0.15%,0.25%,0.47%, and there were downward trends in the young, the adult,and the elder from 1993 to 2000. The nosocomial infection incidence in urinary tract in Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter were 0.45%, 0.60%,0.36%,and 0.32% and the rate in summer was the highest in four seasons, and there were downward trends in the incidence from 1993 to 2000.Conclusion: The nosocomial infection incidence in urinary tract in different sub-populations is significantly different. The total nosocomial infection incidence in urinary tract decreases from 1993 to 2000. The decrease of the nosocomial infection incidence in urinary tract is caused by the decrease of the nosocomial infection incidence in urinary tract in most sub-populations. The nosocomial infection incidence in urinary tract is cut down effectively by the Nosocomial Infection Surveillance and Control opened up in 1993.",

Partial correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation of the anthropometric indices among the first-degree relatives. Results: According to the Chi-square test for goodness of fit to binomial distribution, the distribution of patients in general obesity families and central obesity families did not confirm to the binomial distribution, and the prevalence of first-degree relatives of patients with different types of obesity was significantly higher than that of first-degree relatives of non-obese patients. The heritability of body mass index, waist circumference and waist-height ratio was (44\u00b16)%, (48\u00b16)% and (46\u00b16)%, respectively. The indexes of obesity among parents and children, siblings and couples were correlated. Conclusion: The prevalence of general obesity and central obesity has the characteristic of family aggregation among the adult population in that rural area of Henan Province.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of oxygen free radicals and mitochondrial signaling in semen disorders, in particular, how this induces low concentrations and reduced motility of sperm. Ejaculate samples were obtained from 120 young adult males (mean age, 28.7\u00b15.3 years) with normal semen (n=30), oligospermia (n=30), asthenospermia (n=30) and oligoasthenozoospermia (n=30). The malondialdehyde (MDA) content, total superoxide dismutase (T\u2011SOD) activity and glutathione peroxidase (GSH\u2011Px) activity of the sperm samples were determined by enzymatic assays. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was determined by flow cytometric detection of accumulated membrane\u2011permeable JC\u20111 fluorescent dye. The mRNA and protein expression levels of apoptosis-associated genes [Bcl\u20112, Bax, cytochrome c (Cyt C) and caspase-3] were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Intergroup differences were evaluated by Student's t\u2011test. The sperm samples from all semen disorder groups exhibited significantly lower T\u2011SOD content and GSH\u2011Px activity (all P<0.05 versus normal sperm), and the extent of reduction revealed a disorder-associated trend (asthenospermia < oligospermia \u2248 oligoasthenozoospermia). By contrast, the semen disorder groups had significantly higher MDA content (all P<0.05 versus normal sperm); the extent of this increase also revealed a disorder-associated trend (asthenospermia > oligospermia \u2248 oligoasthenozoospermia). The sperm from patients with semen disorders also exhibited significantly lower MMP than normal sperm, as evidenced by lower mean ratios of JC\u20111+ sperm per group. The semen disorder groups had significantly higher Bax, Cyt C and caspase-3 mRNA and protein expression levels in the sperm samples, but significantly lower levels of Bcl\u20112 (all P<0.05 versus normal sperm). However, only the extent of increases in Cyt C and caspase-3 exhibited a disorder-associated trend (oligospermia > asthenospermia). In conclusion, oxygen free radicals may be involved in reduced sperm concentration and motility, possibly through effects on the mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway. Perturbed mitochondrial release of Cyt C may be the distinguishing molecular feature between oligospermia and asthenospermia.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale outbreaks of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) have occurred frequently and caused neurological sequelae in mainland China since 2008. Prediction of the activity of HFMD epidemics a few weeks ahead is useful in taking preventive measures for efficient HFMD control.Samples obtained from children hospitalized with HFMD in Zhengzhou, Henan, China, were examined for the existence of pathogens with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from 2008 to 2012. Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models for the weekly number of HFMD, Human enterovirus 71(HEV71) and CoxsackievirusA16 (CoxA16) associated HFMD were developed and validated. Cross correlation between the number of HFMD hospitalizations and climatic variables was computed to identify significant variables to be included as external factors. Time series modeling was carried out using multivariate SARIMA models when there was significant predictor meteorological variable.2932 samples from the patients hospitalized with HFMD, 748 were detected with HEV71, 527 with CoxA16 and 787 with other enterovirus (other EV) from January 2008 to June 2012. Average atmospheric temperature (T{avg}) lagged at 2 or 3 weeks were identified as significant predictors for the number of HFMD and the pathogens. SARIMA(0,1,0)(1,0,0)52 associated with T{avg} at lag 2 (T{avg}-Lag 2) weeks, SARIMA(0,1,2)(1,0,0)52 with T{avg}-Lag 2 weeks and SARIMA(0,1,1)(1,1,0)52 with T{avg}-Lag 3 weeks were developed and validated for description and predication the weekly number of HFMD, HEV71-associated HFMD, and Cox A16-associated HFMD hospitalizations.Seasonal pattern of certain HFMD pathogens can be associated by meteorological factors. The SARIMA model including climatic variables could be used as an early and reliable monitoring system to predict annual HFMD epidemics.",

These cases develop rapidly, and it is important to predict the severity of HFMD from mild to fatal and to identify risk factors for mild HFMD. The objective of this study was to correlate the levels of serum inflammatory cytokines with HFMD severity.This study was designed as a nested serial case-control study. The data collected included general information, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory findings and serum cytokine levels.The levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 in patients with severe HFMD were significantly higher than in mild patients during the 2nd to 5th day after disease onset. The levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 increased from the 2nd day to the 4th day and later decreased. The levels of TNF-\u03b1 were high on the first two days and subsequently decreased. The changes of IL-10, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 in the controls were similar for all cases. The levels of IL-4, IL-6 and IL-17 in the controls were not significantly different with the progression of HFMD.Our findings indicate that the IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 levels correlate with HFMD severity.",

In the scheme, an improved dynamical virtual ship (DVS) principle is initially developed to programme the real-time attitude guidance for the underactuated ship in marine practice, providing a smooth transition of heading angle and velocity based on the principle of proximity. The scheduler is applied in the path-following and obstacles avoidance missions. Furthermore, to ensure the effectiveness of the obstacles avoidance manoeuvering, a practical robust neural control is proposed by fusion of neural networks and the robust neural damping technique. It requires less (or no) information of the system parameters and structure, and only four adaptive parameters require to be updated online. These designs would facilitate the implementation of the algorithm in the practical engineering. Considerable efforts are made to obtain the semi-global finite-time uniformly bounded (SGFTUB) stability by employing the Lyapunov theory. The comparative experiments have been presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

Model uncertainties and ocean disturbances are also considered. By incorporating adaptive control, neural networks (NNs), the high-gain observer (HGO) and the minimal learning parameter (MLP) algorithm in the backstepping procedure, a novel adaptive output-feedback formation control scheme is developed. We show that formation errors can be guaranteed to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) with the proposed controller. Compared with existing methods, the formation can be achieved only with position and yaw angle of both leader and follower.

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the leader\u2013follower formation problem of multiple underactuated autonomous surface vessels in the presence of model uncertainties and environmental disturbances. Specially, the formation is defined in the body-fixed coordinates of the leader vessel and velocities of the leader are unavailable to followers. A novel robust adaptive formation control scheme based on the minimal learning parameter (MLP) algorithm and the disturbance observer (DOB) is presented. To address related formation configurations and unknown velocities of the leader, adaptive programming of the virtual vessel is introduced. By the neural networks (NNs) technique, the DOB is constructed and the formation controller is developed with different MLP-based adaptive laws. Under the proposed controller, it is shown that the desired formation can be achieved only with the position and yaw angle of the leader. And formation errors are guaranteed to be semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded. Compared with existing results, the NNs-based DOB can compensate disturbances effectively with less model information. Meanwhile, the formation controller and the DOB can share the same set of NNs with smaller computational effort, where only two parameters need to be learned online for each of them. Simulations and comparison results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper proposes a robust H 2  optimal control strategy for the depth-plane motion of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the presence of output disturbances and time delay. The six degrees of freedom nonlinear kinematic and dynamic equations of motion of the vehicle are firstly described. The depth-plane linearization of the vehicle equations of motion is then derived for efficient controller design from the practical point of view. Using this linearized and reduced-order model, a robust H 2  optimal control method is designed. The designed control method takes into account both the output disturbances and time delay and provides suitable control action for desired tracking. The robust stability and robust performance of the proposed control method with respect to the model uncertainties are discussed. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed robust H 2  optimal control strategy has remarkable performance and provides higher tracking accuracy, better output disturbances rejection ability, stronger robustness against model uncertainties, and smaller fin angle input than the existing pitch-and-depth loop PD depth controller.",

The reference flight trajectory is defined as the composition of path and motion functions. Both of them are generated by using quintic B-spline functions. Based on differential flatness approach, the quadcopter dynamical constraints are satisfied instantaneously by computing the induced aerodynamical moments and lift force. The optimal reference flight trajectory, with respect to the mission requirements and imposed constraints, is reached by manipulating the control points\u2019 vectors of B-spline functions via a nonlinear constrained optimization method. The mission requirements are defined as a set of waypoints with their respective scheduled flight timetable. A minimum-energy cost function is developed to minimize the consumed energy and induced efforts by reference flight trajectory. For the need of the optimal overfly-times schedule, the overfly times with respect to the defined constraints and performance criteria are calculated. Numerical simulation results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed optimization method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper investigates the leader-follower cooperative formation control problem of autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) with uncertain dynamics and external disturbances. Especially, ASVs can communicate with each other under a directed interaction topology. Based on directed graph theories, backstepping and the minimal learning parameter (MLP) algorithm, a novel distributed robust formation controller with two different adaptive laws is developed for each ASV. Dynamic surface control (DSC) is utilized to eliminate repeated derivative of virtual control laws, which is important to generate real-time control signals. Neural networks (NNs) approximation combined with an MLP-based adaptive law is incorporated into the proposed controller to enhance the robustness against model uncertainties. Then only one learning parameter instead of the enormous weights matrix is estimated for each ASV. An auxiliary adaptive law is designed to obtain a continuous controller when compensating approximation errors and disturbances. It is shown that desired formation shapes can be achieved with the proposed controller if the interaction topology has a directed spanning tree, and formation errors are guaranteed to be semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB).

        "abstract": "Abstract   This note focuses on the waypoints-based path-following problem of underactuated ships, where the reference path is surrounded by multiple static and moving obstacles. By virtue of the improved dynamical virtual ship (DVS) principle, a novel guidance law with multi-obstacles avoidance is proposed to generate the real-time attitude reference. In this approach, the manoeuvering tasks are specified as three priority levels: the static obstacle avoidance, the moving obstacle avoidance and the path-following mission. And the detailed design abides the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) to ensure the sailing safety, especially for moving obstacles or other vessels. Furthermore, a robust neural algorithm is developed by using the neural networks (NNs) approximation and the robust neural damping technique. The system gain uncertainty of actuators is tackled and less information about the hydrodynamic structure, the actuator model and the external disturbances are required. Considerable efforts are made to obtain the semi-global practical finite-time bounded (SGPFB) stability. The proposed scheme is with advantages of concise structure and improved autonomy. Finally, two experiments are employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.",

All kinds of linear MAS can be described by a novel block diagram based on transfer functions in a unified framework.

A filter is used to be in series with each controller to not only stabilise the whole systems but also achieve a tradeoff between nominal performance and robustness by adjusting a single tuning parameter.

        "abstract": "The multivariable coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) are characterized by several interconnected nonlinear subsystems of varying time lags making the whole system stiff, and thereby attaining multitime-scale property. In this case, controls based on singular perturbation and time-scale theories provide superior results than conventional one. This brief aims to develop an integral state feedback controller with an observer using three-time-scale approach for CFPP. The integral action assures zero steady-state error, an observer determines states, and a three-time-scale technique provides flexibility to design independent subsystem controls. First, a state space model is obtained with state feedback integral action in three-time-scale form. Second, three-stage feedback control is proposed by an innovative two-time-scale separation so as to reduce design complexity and computations. Finally, an observer is constructed again by time-scale decoupling. It is then examined on the practical model of 300-MW CFPP for investigating plant behavior under various transients. In comparison, the performance of the suggested controller is found to be superior to a recently published controller.",

Compared with previous approaches to achieve performance recovery, the proposed method aims at dealing with a broader class of nonaffine-in-control systems with triangular structure. An IDI state feedback law is designed first, in which less knowledge of the model plant is needed compared to earlier approximate dynamic inversion methods, thus yielding more robust performance. After that, an extended high-gain observer is designed to accomplish the task with output feedback. Finally, we prove that the designed IDI controller is equivalent to an adaptive proportional-integral (PI) controller, with respect to both time response equivalence and robustness equivalence. The conclusion implies that for the studied strict-feedback non-affine systems with unmodelled dynamics, there always exits a PI controller to stabilise the systems. The effectiveness...",

Assuming that only the current and the voltage are measurable, we design an adaptive state observer using the technique of signal injection. Our main contribution is to propose a new filter to identify the virtual output generated by the signal injection. It is shown that this filter, designed using the dynamic regressor extension and mixing estimator, outperforms the classical one. Two additional features of the proposed observer are that (i) it does not require the knowledge of the electrical resistance, which is also estimated on-line and (ii) exponential convergence to a tunable residual set is guaranteed without excitation assumptions. The observer is then applied, in a certainty equivalent way, to a full state-feedback control law to obtain the sensorless controller, whose performance is assessed via experiments.",

        "abstract": "Probing signal injection is a well-established technique to extract additional information from a weakly (or non) observable dynamical system. Using averaging theory, a framework to analyse such schemes for general nonlinear systems has been recently proposed in [9], where it is shown that the signal injection may be used to generate a new high frequency output that can be used for state observation or controller design. A key step for the success of this technique is the implementation of a filter to reconstruct this virtual output from the measurement of the overall systems output. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new filter with guaranteed convergence properties that outperforms the classical designs. The method is applied to a general class of electromechanical systems, and its performance is assessed via simulations and experiments of the 1-DOF magnetic levitation system.",

We develop an extended updated-gain high gain observer to make a tradeoff between reconstruction speed and measurement noise attenuation. The designed observer, whose gains are driven by nonlinear functions of the available output estimation errors, has the ability to reconstruct system states quickly and reduce the effect of measurement noise. We establish that, if there exists a state feedback law exponentially stabilizing the system with respect to an invariant set, the estimations and estimation errors are bounded. Besides, the trajectories of state- and output-feedback (based on the proposed observer) are sufficiently close, namely performance recovery. The observer performance is illustrated by various examples in marine control, including a case of transformation into the predefined structure. ",

The controller design follows the widely popular interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based methodology, with the free matrices partially structured. Two asymptotic regulation objectives are considered: drive to zero the state or drive the systems total energy to a desired constant value. In both cases, the control laws are smooth, time-invariant, state-feedbacks. For the nonholonomic integrator we give an almost global solution for both problems, with the objectives ensured for all system initial conditions starting outside a set that has zero Lebesgue measure and is nowhere dense. For the general case of higher-order nonholonomic systems in chained form, a local stability result is given. Simulation results comparing the performance of the proposed controller with other existing designs are also provided.",

Firstly, based on the original T-S fuzzy system, an augmented system with integral action is established to eliminate steady tracking errors. Next, a state-feedback parallel distributed compensation (PDC) controller is designed such that the guaranteed cost function has an upper bound. Sufficient condition that guarantees quadratical stability of the resulting closed-loop system is derived by using a relaxed stability condition of T-S fuzzy systems. To obtain as good performance as possible, the design procedure is transformed into a linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) optimization problem and the upper bound of the guaranteed cost function is minimized. Finally, the simulation of output tracking control of a boiler-turbine system verifies the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The paper aims to develop a novel path following control law for nonlinear vessel models in two-time scales. For the 4-DOF path following model, we explore that the guidance dynamics are much slower than the ship motion dynamics. Based on such characteristic, a singular perturbation method is used to decompose the full system into two-time-scale subsystems. The two-time-scale structure allows independent analysis of dynamics in each time scale. Separate control strategies for the quasi-steady-state subsystem and the boundary layer subsystem are designed to stabilize the full system, yielding a rudder angle control law which is compact and uncomplicated to implement in practice. Singular perturbation methods are utilized to provide mathematical expressions for the upper bound of the singularly perturbed parameter and establish the exponential stability of the full system. The paper proves that the control law is robust in the presence of bounded perturbations and unmodeled dynamics, resulting states converge into an invariant set arbitrarily closed to the origin. Simulation results show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method for path following. The primary benefit of the proposed method is the simplicity of implementation.",

It is shown that the filtered tracking errors, position tracking errors and velocity tracking errors for the three proposed controllers are exponentially convergent. Moreover, all the above tracking errors for the three proposed controllers can be shaped by specific analytic expressions and such expressions illustrate how the transient responses of the above tracking errors can be modified by adjusting the control parameters.

The block diagram based on transfer functions can be used to describe both homogeneous and heterogeneous MAS in a unified framework. In this networked MAS the nodes are divided into two kinds: the leader nodes accessible to the regulated error and the following nodes only accessible to the relative output errors with respect to their neighbouring nodes. Because that the input load disturbance is taken into consideration, the proposed distributed controllers calculated by algebraic solution performs better disturbance rejection capability in terms of 2-norm than the other rotocols derived from the conventional criterions.

First, a closed-loop multi-input multi-output framework with transfer functions is introduced, and an SOR condition is given. Second, the decomposition method is utilised to simplify the analysis of internal stability and H2 performance index of the whole system to a set of independent optimisation problems with respect to the eigenvalues of the topology matrix. Finally, for each decomposed subsystem, the H2 optimal ILDR controller can be computed from all the stabilising controllers.

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the design of an adaptive second-order fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode control (ASOFNTSMC) scheme for the trajectory tracking of fully actuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances. First, a second-order fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode (SOFNTSM) manifold is designed to achieve a faster convergence rate than the existing second-order nonsingular terminal sliding mode (SONTSM) manifold. Then, by using this SOFNTSM manifold, an ASOFNTSMC scheme is developed for the fully actuated AUVs to track the desired trajectory. The designed SOFNTSM manifold yields local exponential convergence of the position and attitude tracking errors to zero, and the developed ASOFNTSMC scheme ensures that the error trajectories always move toward the SOFNTSM manifold and once they hit the manifold, remain on it in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances. By deriving the expression of the bounding function of the system uncertainty and using adaptive technique to estimate the unknown parameters of the system uncertainty bounds, the ASOFNTSMC scheme does not require the prior knowledge of the upper bound of the system uncertainty. Meanwhile, through involving the discontinuous sign function into the time derivative of the control input, the ASOFNTSMC scheme eliminates the chattering without reducing the tracking precision. Compared with the existing adaptive SONTSM control (ASONTSMC) scheme, the proposed ASOFNTSMC scheme offers a faster convergence rate for the trajectory tracking control of fully actuated AUVs. Two comparative simulation cases performed respectively on two fully actuated AUVs demonstrate the superiority of the ASOFNTSMC scheme over the ASONTSMC scheme.",

To achieve better speed control performance for each ac motor drive, a sliding mode controller is proposed.

In addition, a sliding mode observer is proposed to estimate lumped disturbances for the motor drives. Disturbance estimation results are fed forward as compensation parts for the SMC controller; in the meantime, they are transmitted to the virtual line-shafting drive to accurately reflect total system disturbances, thus to achieve high motor speed synchronisation precision. Effectiveness of the proposed ELS control scheme is verified by simulation results.",

The ANITSMC is first proposed for a first-order uncertain non-linear dynamic system to eliminate the singularity problem in conventional terminal sliding mode control (TSMC) and avoid the requirement of the bound information of the lumped system uncertainty. The time taken to reach the equilibrium point from any initial error is guaranteed to be finite. The proposed ANITSMC is then applied to trajectory tracking control of AUVs. It guarantees that the velocity tracking errors locally converge to zero in finite time and after that the position tracking errors locally converge to zero exponentially. The designed ANITSMC of AUVs avoids the requirement of the prior knowledge of the lumped system uncertainty bounds as opposite to the existing globally finite-time stable tracking control (GFTSTC), provides higher tracking accuracy than the existing GFTSTC and adaptive non-singular TSMC (ANTSMC) and offers faster convergence rate and better robustness against dynamic uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances than the adaptive proportional-integral sliding mode control (APISMC).

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the trajectory tracking control of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances. Two adaptive integral terminal sliding mode control schemes, namely, adaptive integral terminal sliding mode control (AITSMC) scheme and adaptive fast integral terminal sliding mode control (AFITSMC) scheme are proposed for UUVs based on integral terminal sliding mode (ITSM) and fast ITSM (FITSM), respectively. Each control scheme is double-looped: composed of a kinematic controller and a dynamic controller. First, a kinematic controller is designed for each of the two control schemes. The two kinematic controllers are based on ITSM and FITSM, respectively. These kinematic controllers yield local finite-time convergence of the position tracking errors to zero meanwhile avoid the singularity problem in the conventional terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Then, using the output of the kinematic controller as a reference velocity command, a dynamic controller is developed for each of the two control schemes. The two dynamic controllers are also based on ITSM and FITSM, respectively. An adaptive mechanism is introduced to estimate the unknown parameters of the upper bound of the lumped system uncertainty which consists of dynamic uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances so that the prior knowledge of the upper bound of the lumped system uncertainty is not required. The estimated parameters are then used as controller parameters to eliminate the effects of the lumped system uncertainty. The convergence rate of the integral terminal sliding variable vector is investigated and the local finite-time convergence of the velocity tracking errors to zero in the ITSM or FITSM is obtained. Finally, based on the designed kinematic and dynamic controllers, the finite-time stability of the full closed-loop cascaded system is shown. The two proposed control schemes improve the tracking accuracy over the existing globally finite-time stable tracking control (GFTSTC) and adaptive nonsingular TSMC schemes, and enhance the robustness against parameter uncertainties and external disturbances over the GFTSTC scheme. Compared with the conventional adaptive integral sliding mode control (AISMC) scheme, the two proposed control schemes offer faster convergence rate and stronger robustness against dynamic uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances for the trajectory tracking control of UUVs due to involving the fractional integrator. Comparative numerical simulations are performed on the dynamic model of the Omni Directional Intelligent Navigator UUV for two trajectory tracking cases. The convergence rate and robustness to uncertainties and disturbances are quantified as the convergent time and bounds of the steady-state position and velocity tracking errors, respectively. The results show that the two proposed control schemes improve at least 20s in convergence rate and enhance about 2% robustness in position tracking and 20% robustness in velocity tracking over the AISMC scheme.",

        "abstract": "Neural episodic control (NEC) is an emerging deep reinforcement learning algorithm, the dynamic-scale memory buffer of which is updated by appending experience in a steady stream. NEC has greater ability to utilize the information of the memory and outperforms other deep reinforcement learning agents. However, the scale of memory consumption increases dramatically along with the training episodes. It is even worse that, to query the large-scale memory buffer, kd-trees based approximate nearest neighbors algorithm has to be repeatedly performed. These defects of NEC consequently hinder the further application on the industrial control units with low-performance hardware; e.g. the thermal power plant. To overcome this problem, in this paper, a deep reinforcement learning system based on the synchronous neural episodic control (SNEC) algorithm is proposed for combustion optimization tasks on limited memory resources. The proposed system consists of two major components: 1) a predictor on the basis of convolutional neural networks and LSTM module; 2) an SNEC optimizer agent. The main research and innovations are as follows: 1) a deep neural network model is developed to predict system states accurately and serves as a proxy for the optimizer; 2) a fixed-scale memory buffer is designed specifically for the control agents with low-performance hardware; 3) a straightforward mechanism for lookup and update is established to eliminate the computation of kd-trees search algorithm; 4) different from the original one, only one public differentiable neural dictionary (PDND) is required for SNEC agent, and thus the Q-value for all the actions are updated synchronously. The experimental results show that the proposed SNEC algorithm outperforms the standard deep Q-networks on limited memory resources; with the application of this system, the power efficiency turns out to be improved, and original gas emissions are reduced. In addition, the control actions are designed to be simple enough for the practical implementation.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel framework applying the reinforcement learning algorithms to thermal power generation control is proposed instead of traditional PID controllers. In order to implement a time series response by the neural network, we discrete the control model and embed it into the environment. By defining an episode as the adjustment process of the steady state to the setpoint, the agent can learn the whole embedding model instead of only accepting scalar error signals. The experiments have proven that proximal policy optimization framework shows the same robustness and fast response as the traditional PID control in the single input single output(SISO) system and performs better in the multiple input multiple output(MIMO) system.",

An internal model controller with both good control effect and strong robustness is designed to control the proposed model.

To trade-off set-point tracking performance and the systems disturbance rejection ability, a set-point filter is used to reduce excessive overshoot in the set-point response.

Firstly an extended naming game with biased assimilation (NGBA) is proposed. The hearer in NGBA accepts the received information in a biased manner, where he may refuse to accept the conveyed word from the speaker with a predefined probability, if the conveyed word is different from his current memory. Secondly, the adaptive network is formulated by rewiring the links. Theoretical analysis is developed to show that the population in NGBA will eventually reach global consensus on either A or B. Numerical simulation results show that the larger strength of biased assimilation on both words, the slower convergence speed, while larger strength of biased assimilation on only one word can slightly accelerate the convergence; larger population size can make the rate of convergence slower to a large extent when it increases from a relatively small size, while such effect becomes minor when the population size is large; the behavior of adaptively reconnecting the existing links can greatly accelerate the rate of convergence especially on the sparse connected network.",

        "abstract": "In this note, the authors study the tracking problem for uncertain nonlinear time-delay systems with unknown non-smooth hysteresis described by the generalised Prandtl\u2013Ishlinskii P-I model. A minimal learning parameters MLP-based adaptive neural algorithm is developed by fusion of the Lyapunov\u2013Krasovskii functional, dynamic surface control technique and MLP approach without constructing a hysteresis inverse. Unlike the existing results, the main innovation can be summarised as that the proposed algorithm requires less knowledge of the plant and independent of the P-I hysteresis operator, i.e. the hysteresis effect is unknown for the control design. Thus, the outstanding advantage of the corresponding scheme is that the control law is with a concise form and easy to implement in practice due to less computational burden. The proposed controller guarantees that the tracking error converges to a small neighbourhood of zero and all states of the closed-loop system are stabilised. A simulation example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

A robust neural stabilizing algorithm is proposed by using the circle criterion, the NNs approximation and the MLP (minimum learning parameter) technique. In the scheme, the nonlinear observer is first designed to estimate the unmeasurable states and the assumption \u201clinear growth\u201d of the nonlinear function is released. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the whole system (including the perturbation of time-varying delay) is lumped and compensated by employing one RBF NNs (radial basis function neural networks). Though, only two weight-norm related parameters are required to be updated online for the merit of the MLP technique. And the gain-inversion related adaptive law is targetly designed to mitigate the adverse effect of unknown dead zone. Comparing with the previous work, the proposed algorithm obtains the advantage: a concise form and easy to implementation due to its less computational burden. The theoretical analysis and comparison example demonstrate the substantial effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

A parameter estimation and upper bound estimation based sliding mode control scheme is proposed to solve the problem of the unknown plant parameters and environmental disturbances. For each of these leader-follower formation systems, the dynamic equations of position and attitude are analyzed using coordinate transformation with the aid of the backstepping technique. All the variables are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded stable in the closed-loop system, which is proven by the distribution design Lyapunov function synthesis. The main advantages of this approach are that: first, parameter estimation based sliding mode control can enhance the robustness of the closed-loop system in presence of model uncertainties and environmental disturbances; second, a continuous function is developed to replace the signum function in the design of sliding mode scheme, which devotes to reduce the chattering of the control system. Finally, numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Existing observer-based consensus protocols are designed based on an undirected graph, and need global information, such as the network size or eigenvalue information of the Laplacian matrix. In this study, based on only the agent dynamics and the relative outputs of neighbouring agents, an adaptive consensus protocol is proposed by assigning a time-varying coupling weight to each node, and this protocol is independent of any global information and hence is fully distributed. Under the assumptions that each agent is asymptotically null controllable with bounded controls and detectable, and the topological graph has a directed spanning tree with the leader as the root node, semi-global observer-based consensus tracking of multi-agent systems can be reached despite actuator saturation occurring. The results are applied to consensus tracking control of two-mass-spring systems, which are well-known models for vibration in many mechanical systems.",

        "abstract": "For leader-following multiagent systems with input saturation, the existing protocols use a low gain feedback approach to achieve semi-global consensus. The main drawback of this approach is the ineffective utilization of the actuator potential, resulting in bad performance. To improve the transient performance of the consensus tracking, this paper proposes a gain scheduled approach for multiagent systems subject to the saturator saturations. A novel kind of scheduler-based protocols are proposed, which consists of state feedback controllers with time-varying gain and parameter schedulers. The role of the controllers is to achieve the consensus tracking, while the schedulers can accelerate this consensus progress by enlarging the gain parameter. To remove the dependence of the schedulers on global information, a minimum-value-based consensus algorithm is put forward, with idea of driving all values of agents throughout the network to their minimum value. Its implementation is guaranteed by the network-topology connectivity. Finally, our approach is further extended to the case where the leader\u2019s control input is nonzero, time-varying, and bounded. The discontinuous protocol and its continuous approximation counterpart are designed, yielding the exact- and quasi-consensus tracking, respectively. Simulation results verify the theoretical analysis.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the robust consensus reliable control problem against actuator faults for linear parameter-varying multiagent systems. First, the actuator faults are modeled via a polytopic uncertainty method. Second, a distributed observer is designed for the single agent by sharing the communication network sensors to estimate the state information. Then by these estimated information, a robust consensus reliable control protocol against actuator faults is obtained and desired disturbance rejection performance can be guaranteed by this proposed protocol. Third, the nonconvexity conditions of the consensus control protocol can be translated into an linear matrix inequality optimization problem via simple matrix calculation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed reliable controller scheme is illustrated by two examples.",

To be an extension, this study divides the lumped disturbance into two parts, namely, local disturbance which is slow-varying, mismatched and non-linear, and global disturbance generated by an autonomous linear system. Generalised extended state observers (GESOs) are constructed to estimate the local states, the local disturbances and the global disturbance simultaneously. Observer-based controllers are designed to realise cooperative output regulation in the presence of mismatched uncertainties. In control design, a linear matrix inequality-based design methodology is proposed to get the exponentially convergent GESO with guaranteed decay rate.

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the optimum dynamic positioning control problem for marine ships in the presence of actuator gain uncertainties and unknown environmental disturbances. The proposed approach is formulated as two modules, i.e., the guidance part and the control part. By utilizing the improved extremum seeking algorithm, the optimum-seeking guidance is developed in this note to generate the reasonable heading guidance for dynamic positioning ships. The main purpose of this design is to ensure the closed-loop system running efficiently and environment-friendly in practice. Combined with the proposed guidance principle, a robust neural control algorithm is developed based on the dynamic surface control, neural networks, and the robust neural damping technique. In this algorithm, the strong couplings of state variables and the gain uncertainty of actuators are tackled, and the system uncertainties are compensated requiring less (or no) information of the hydrodynamic structure, the actuator model and the external disturbances. Considerable effort is made to guarantee the semiglobal uniform ultimate bounded stability by employing the Lyapunov theory. The advantages of the proposed control scheme could be summarized as two points. First, the control approach is with the properties of optimization and energy-saving, which is meaningful for applying the theoretical algorithm. Second, the pitch ratio of thrusters is selected as the control inputs of interest, which is measurable in the practical plant. These characteristics would facilitate the implementation of the algorithm in engineering. Two examples are provided to verify the performance of the proposed scheme.",

The optimizing criterion is to minimize the sensitivity function to enhance its robustness. The controllers are designed based on the Pad\u00e9 approximated mirror-mapping process with a stable form, other than the original unstable system. The developed algorithm could release the internal stability constraints to the unstable plant. By using the graphical stability criterion, a systematic methodology is derived to obtain the exact stabilizing region, where the sole design parameter is related to the stability degree of the closed-loop system. The proposed algorithm is with characteristics of concise and efficient design. Three experiments has been employed to illustrate that the control effects can achieve the satisfied performance in aspects of disturbance rejection and robustness.",

        "abstract": "Increasing evidence shows that real networks interact with each other, forming a network of networks (NONs). Synchronization, a ubiquitous process in natural and engineering systems, has fascinatingly gained rising attentions in the context of NONs. Despite efforts to study the synchronization of NONs, it is still a challenge to understand how do the network sizes affect the synchronization and its phase diagram of NONs coupled with nonlinear dynamics. Here, we model such NONs as star-like motifs to analytically derive the critical values of both the internal and the external coupling strengths, at which a phase transition from synchronization to incoherence occurs. Our results show that the critical values strongly depend on the network sizes. Reducing the difference between network sizes will enhance the synchronization of the whole system, which indicates the irrationality of previous studies that assume the network sizes to be the same. The optimal connection strategy also changes as the network sizes change, a discovery contradicting to the previous conclusion that connecting the high-degree nodes of each network is always the most effective strategy to achieve synchronization unchangeably. This finding emphasizes the crucial role of network sizes which has been neglected in the previous studies and could contribute to the design of a global synchronized system.",

First, a matching table is created and used for sifting the true from the false dependences among the nodes in the BNs. Then, a dynamic extension to matching table is developed to enable the dynamic locating of matching pairs to start as soon as possible. Next, based on the pseudocommutative property of the semitensor product, a position-transform mining is carried out to further improve data utilization. Combining the above, the topology of the BNs can be premined for the subsequent identification. Examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of reducing the data requirement. Some excellent features, such as the online and parallel processing ability, are also demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing development of industrial wireless technologies and standards, the scarce spectrum in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band has been extremely overcrowded, which can be mitigated by harvesting more spectrum in licensed bands with the emerging cognitive radio technology. In industrial cognitive radio networks (ICRNs), security is one of the most important problems. Spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks is one of major challenges for cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) in ICRNs. Malicious users send fake decisions to mislead the fusion center for exploiting the spectrum source. And smart malicious users launch attacks with small probability which is difficult to be detected by existing detection scheme. To address this issue, we propose an optimal reputation-based detection scheme with considerations of the attack probability. Moreover, the threshold of reputation value is specially designed to adapt to the varying attack probability which can be estimated by past performance. To estimate the attack probability, we use the maximum likelihood estimation method in certain CSS rounds. Numerical results reveal that the proposed detection scheme performs better than existing reputation-based detection schemes.",

A modified Lth-order Rice fading model is presented to better characterize the multipath fading phenomena in real wireless communication environment. Our objective is to design a filter such that the filtering error system is finite-time stochastic bounded with a prespecified exponential dissipative performance. With the aid of the auxiliary function, a new set of sufficient conditions is derived for the existence of an acceptable filter which can degrade into the conditions for filtering with H performance. Then, the filter gains are obtained by solving these inequality sufficient conditions. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.",

In order to solve the problem, we research on several swarm intelligence algorithms and propose two new algorithms. The first is the improvement of genetic algorithm and the second one is a algorithm which combined with the first algorithm and the traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm. When compared to the existing literatures, our contributions are at least three-folds. First, due to the complexity of the boiler combustion model, the Least Squares-Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) is applied to the system to predict and get more accurate system outputs. Second, the Improved Genetic Algorithm (IGA) and Particle Swarm Optimization-Improved Genetic Algorithm (PSO-IGA) are proposed to applied to the combustion optimization. Third, we optimize the system both in single-objective optimization and multi-objective optimization. Finally, numerical simulations show that the LS-SVM algorithm has a accurate prediction and the prediction result can use to estimate the system output in the optimization process. The simulation also compare the new algorithms with the traditional algorithms, and shows that the PSO-IGA has the best optimization effect among all the four swarm intelligence algorithm. So, PSO-IGA is a efficient way to improve the combustion efficiency and reduce the emissions.",

One or more vehicles have access to the measurements of their own state, while the rest must rely on locally available relative measurements and limited communication to estimate their own state. The proposed solution consists in the implementation of a local state observer, which is embedded in each vehicle, and a protocol specifying the observer updating rule. The local state observer structure is given, and protocols are presented with two scenarios considered: whether the vehiclesu0027 velocity measurements are available to embedded sensors or not. It has been shown that, by using the given observer structure and the proposed protocols, the observers cooperate to work out the formation state estimates, which converge to the actual states of the vehicle formation in finite time.

        "abstract": "Precise measurement of remotely operated vehicle (ROV) position is crucial for dynamic positioning close to an underwater structure. This can be achieved by using a passive arm measurement system. However, the main drawback of this measurement system is the additional forces acting on ROV due to the mechanical connection. To cope with this problem, a robust adaptive PID control scheme is proposed for dynamic positioning of ROV working in close proximity of an underwater structure in this paper. The proposed controller is a composition of a PID term, a robust term and an adaptive term. The adaptive term is adopted to estimate and compensate the additional forces caused by the passive arm, umbilical cable and uncertainties in buoyancy, and the PID and robust terms are used to eliminate the positioning errors. With respect to the existing adaptive PD controller developed for dynamic positioning of ROV, the proposed controller makes the following improvements: 1) it does not require any knowledge of the inertia matrix, Coriolis and centripetal matrix and hydrodynamic damping matrix of the vehicle dynamics in the controller design; and 2) it does not need any constraints on the control gains to guarantee the global asymptotical convergence of the position and velocity errors of the vehicle to zero except for choosing an appropriately large exponential decay rate. Finally, comparative numerical simulations are performed on an experimentally validated ROV between the standard PID controller and the proposed robust adaptive PID controller. Simulation results show that the proposed controller offers higher positioning precision and stronger robustness to the additional forces than the standard PID controller.",

The improved SMO adopts a rotor speed-related adaptive feedback gain, and is able to derive a flux model-based estimator that contains rotor position and speed direction information. To extract accurate rotor position from the proposed SMO and reduce position estimation errors in both forward and reverse rotation of the PMSM, a tangent function-based PLL structure is established. The proposed SMO together with the PLL structure realises a solution to position and speed estimation for sensorless PMSM drives. Compared with the conventional back electromotive force (EMF)-based position estimator, the proposed position estimation strategy has advantages of simple design and robust estimation performance at a wider speed range. Effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated with simulations on virtual platform.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposed a new methodology to cover the problem of consensus of multiagent systems with sliding mode control based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network. First, neural network adopted to distinguish the uncertainties of the leader and follower agents then a sliding mode tracking controller is applied to force the follower agents to follow the leader\u2019s time-varying states trajectory with the consensus error as small as possible. As the RBF neural network is adopted to approximate the uncertainties, the results can only achieve local consensus. Different from past literature, total error of consensus protocol is considering for sliding surface therefore the local stability of the whole multiagent system is provided meanwhile RBF neural network overcome the problem of unmodeled leader/follower agent dynamics. The weights of the neural networks updated adaptively directly commensurate with consensus error. The point is, there is absolutely no need to have information about dynamical model of the system. The merits of the proposed approach are consisting of consensus protocol robustness, fast error convergence to zero, and local stability of the closed loop multiagent system which is proved by Lyapunov direct method. The simulation results show promising performance of the proposed method on a chaotic system.",

Main contributions are as follows: (1) An accurate tracking control (ATC) scheme is first proposed for a nominal MV tracking system with known dynamics, such that global finite-time stability of can be ensured to achieve fast convergence and precise tracking performance; (2) To exactly attenuate external disturbances, a finite-time disturbance observer (DO) is incorporated into the ATC framework, and establishes the DO-based ATC (DO-ATC) scheme which therefore produces strong disturbance rejection in addition to accurate trajectory tracking; (3) Aiming to precisely identify completely unknown dynamics together with external disturbances, simultaneously, a finite-time unknown observer (UO) is further created within the ATC approach, and thereby contributing to the UO-based ATC (UO-ATC) scheme which eventually achieves accurate trajectory tracking of an MV with fully unknown dynamics under harsh marine environment. Simulation studies and comprehensive comparisons are exhaustively provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed ATC schemes.",

The paper investigates use of the cascade IRC implementation. A SIMC-based controller tuning rule is proposed for first-order plus time delay (FOPTD) processes in the two-input\u2013single-output (TISO) structure. Satisfactory regulatory capacities for both set-point tracking and input resetting are obtained. Both of the controllers are analytically derived with proportional-integral (PI) forms by proposing the equivalent transfer functions. The resulting tuning guideline shows how the adjustable parameters should be changed to balance a trade-off between performance specifications and levels of robustness. Numerical simulations have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, the feasibility of implementing the proposed control strategy in practice is verified by a light intensity control experiment.",

Combined with high-gain observer, parameter compression algorithm and performance function, an adaptive control scheme with prescribed performance is proposed. The high-gain observer is constructed to estimate the velocities, and the parameter compression algorithm is adopted to address persistent perturbations and model uncertainties in a more concise way. By prescribed performance function, the controller can be designed with prescribed performance. The results about system stability is given and proved by using the Lyapunov direct method. The signals concerning with all the errors converge to a bounded set. Compared with the existing methods, the developed scheme can reduce the number of tuning parameters, and guarantee the tracking errors bounded within the prescribed performance constraints in the transformed coordinate, which means the steady errors, convergence rates and maximum overshoots can be guaranteed by the performance function. Comparison and numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

However, its systematic chemical information remained unclear, which hindered the interpretation of the pharmacology and the mechanism of action of this drug. In this research, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method was developed to identify the complicated components and metabolites of Xiaojin Capsule. Two acquisition modes, including the MS mode and fast data directed acquisition mode, were utilized for chemical profiling. As a result, a total of 156 compounds were unambiguously or tentatively identified by comparing their retention times and MS data with those of reference standards or literatures. After the oral administration of Xiaojin Capsule, a total of 53 constituents, including 24 prototype compounds and 29 metabolites, were detected in rat plasma. The obtained results were beneficial for a better understanding of the therapeutic basis of Xiaojin Capsule. A high resolution and efficient separation method was firstly established for systematically characterizing the compounds of Xiaojin Capsule and the associated metabolites in vivo, which could be helpful for quality control and pharmacokinetic studies of this medicine.

Delavatine A (1), a structurally unusual cyclopenta[de]isoquinoline alkaloid, was isolated from Incarvillea delavayi. Extensive spectroscopic analysis, in combination with biogenetic speculation, established the structure of 1. Delavatine A (1) exhibited considerable cytotoxicity against a number of cancer cell lines with IC50 values in the range of 4.28 to 6.61 \u03bcg mL\u22121.",

Their structures, including the absolute configurations of the sugar residues, were elucidated by extensive analysis of NMR spectra and acid hydrolysis. All compounds were tested in vitro for cytotoxicity against four human tumour cell lines, A549, HCT116, MDA-MB-231, and BEL7404. Among the compounds tested, ainsloside B (2) showed potent cytotoxicity against the A549 cell line with an IC50 value of 3.3 \u03bcM. Flow cytometry analysis showed that compound 2 can arrest the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase and induce cell apoptosis in A549 cells. Further studies indicated that the apoptosis-inducing effect of compound 2 may be involved in the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in A549 cells.",

        "abstract": "Deng-Zhan-Xi-Xin injection is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine prescription for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebral vessel diseases. However, there have been few reports on its chemical constituents and metabolic pathway, which has blocked its further quality control and studies on its pharmacology and mechanism of action. In this study, an integrative method was established to rapidly explore the chemical constituents and metabolites of Deng-Zhan-Xi-Xin injection using ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry and the UNIFI\u2122 software combined with multiple data processing approaches. As a result, a total of 40 compounds, including 9 flavonoids and 31 phenolic acids were identified or tentatively characterized, and five compounds were first reported in Deng-Zhan-Xi-Xin injection. Under the same analysis conditions, 70 compounds have been detected in rats, including 25 prototypes and 45 metabolites. This was the first systematic research study on the metabolic profiling of Deng-Zhan-Xi-Xin injection. This study provides valuable chemical information for the quality control and research on pharmacology and mechanism of action of Deng-Zhan-Xi-Xin injection. Moreover, it provides a valuable strategy for analyzing the chemical components and metabolites of other traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions. This article is protected by copyright.

Over the past decades, a number of Wnt inhibitors have been identified through high-throughput screenings, however, very few of them target \u03b2-catenin directly, raising questions regarding its druggability. Here, we review Wnt inhibitors with a focus on small molecules that directly bind \u03b2-catenin, discuss the druggability of \u03b2-catenin, and why it has rarely been targeted, especially in the cellular context. We also propose strategies to develop small molecule binding and depleting cellular \u03b2-catenin, which are generally applicable to other difficult-to-drug or yet-to-be-drugged targets.",

        "title": "Mass spectrometric profiling of valepotriates possessing various acyloxy groups from Valeriana jatamansi.",
        "abstract": "Valepotriates, plant secondary metabolites of the family Valerianaceae, contain various acyloxy group linkages to the valepotriate nucleus and exhibit significant biological activities. Identification of valepotriates is important to uncover potential lead compounds for the development of new sedative and antitumor drugs. However, making their structure elucidation by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments is too difficult to be realized because of the overlapped carbonyl carbon signals of acyloxy groups substituted at different positions. Thus, the mass spectrometric profiling of these compounds in positive ion mode was developed to unveil the exact linkage of acyloxy group and the core of valepotriate. In this study, electrospray ionization tandem multistage mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS(n) ) in ion trap and collision-induced dissociation tandem MS were used to investigate the fragmentation pathways of four types of valepotriates in Valeriana jatamansi, including 5-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrovaltrate hydrin (5-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrovaltrate chlorohydrin), 5,6-dihydrovaltrate hydrin (5,6-dihydrovaltrate chlorohydrin), 5-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrovaltrate and valtrate hydrin (valtrate chlorohydrin). The high-resolution mass spectrum (HRMS) data of all the investigated valepotriates from quadrupole time-of-flight MS/MS were used as a supportive of the fragmentation rules we hypothesized from ion-trap stepwise MS(n) . As a result, the loss sequence of acyloxy groups and the abundance of key product ions, in combination with the characteristic product ions corresponding to the valepotriate nucleus, could readily differentiate the four different types of valepotriates. The summarized fragmentation rules were also successfully exploited for the structural characterization of three new trace valepotriates from V.\u2009jatamansi. The results indicated that the developed analytical method could be employed as a rapid, effective technique for structural characterization of valepotriates, especially for the trace compounds that could not be identified by NMR techniques. This study may also arouse interest for further structural analysis of other valepotriate-containing type herbal medicines. Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Here we report that nitazoxanide (NTZ), a clinically approved antiparasitic drug, efficiently inhibits Wnt signaling independent of APC. Using chemoproteomic approaches, we have identified peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 (PAD2) as the functional target of NTZ in Wnt inhibition. By targeting PAD2, NTZ increased the deamination (citrullination) and turnover of \u03b2-catenin in colon cancer cells. Replacement of arginine residues disrupted the transcriptional activity, and NTZ induced degradation of \u03b2-catenin. In Wnt-activated colon cancer cells, knockout of either PAD2 or \u03b2-catenin substantially increased resistance to NTZ treatment. Our data highlight the potential of NTZ as a modulator of \u03b2-catenin citrullination for the treatment of cancer patients with Wnt pathway mutations. Download references",

        "abstract": "Abstract Oncogenic mutations of the Wnt (wingless)/\u03b2-catenin pathway are frequently observed in major cancer types. Thus far, however, no therapeutic agent targeting Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is available for clinical use. Here we demonstrate that axitinib, a clinically approved drug, strikingly blocks Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in cancer cells, zebrafish, and Apcmin/+ mice. Notably, axitinib dramatically induces Wnt asymmetry and nonrandom DNA segregation in cancer cells by promoting nuclear \u03b2-catenin degradation independent of the GSK3\u03b2 (glycogen synthase kinase3\u03b2)/APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) complex. Using a DARTS (drug affinity-responsive target stability) assay coupled to 2D-DIGE (2D difference in gel electrophoresis) and mass spectrometry, we have identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase SHPRH (SNF2, histone-linker, PHD and RING finger domain-containing helicase) as the direct target of axitinib in blocking Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Treatment with axitinib stabilizes SHPRH and thereby increases the ubiquitination and degradation of \u03b2-catenin. Our findings suggest a previously unreported mechanism of nuclear \u03b2-catenin regulation and indicate that axitinib, a clinically approved drug, would provide therapeutic benefits for cancer patients with aberrant nuclear \u03b2-catenin activation.",

        "abstract": "Alantolactone (AL) and isoalantolactone (IAL), two major active sesquiterpene lactones isolated from Radix Inulae extract, have a wide range of pharmacological activities. The predominant metabolic pathway of AL and IAL observed was glutathione (GSH) conjugation in vitro, which could occur in the absence of metabolic enzymes. Non-enzymatic conjugation with cysteine (Cys) couldalso be observed. Four metabolites (AL-GSH, AL-Cys, IAL-GSH, IAL-Cys) were subsequently isolated and confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The results indicated that the thiol of GSH or Cys can be reacted with the exomethylene carbon atoms of \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl of AL and IAL. After intravenous administration in rats, AL and IAL were extensively metabolized, and the exposure, as measured by area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), for AL-GSH, AL-Cys, IAL-GSH, and IAL-Cys was approximately 1.54-, 0.96-, 1.50-, and 0.91-fold that of the parent drug, respectively. The AUC ratio of metabolites to parent compounds of oral administration was 3.66-, 9.19-, 12.97-, and 9.92-fold that of the parent drug for the above metabolites, respectively. The bioavailability of AL-total (AL, AL-GSH, AL-Cys) and IAL-total (IAL, IAL-GSH, IAL-Cys) was, respectively, 8.39% and 13.07%, which was 3.62- and 6.95- fold that of AL (2.32%) and IAL (1.88%), respectively. The oral exposure will be underestimated if the parent drugs are tested alone. These findings provide useful information for preclinical safety evaluation, and for predicting AL and IAL metabolism in humans.",

        "abstract": "Qi-Jing-Sheng-Bai granule is an effective traditional Chinese medicine formula that has been widely used for the treatment of leukopenia post radiotherapy or chemotherapy. However, its chemical constituents were still unclear, which hindered interpreting bioactive constituents and studying integrative mechanisms. In this study, we developed a three-step strategy to characterize the chemical constituents and metabolites of Qi-Jing-Sheng-Bai by using ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. As a result, a total of 143 compounds, including 56 flavonoids, 51 saponins and 36 other compounds, of which contained six pairs of isomers, were tentatively identified or characterized via reference standards and by comparing mass spectrometry data with literature. After oral administration of 15\u00a0g/kg Qi-Jing-Sheng-Bai, a number of 42 compounds including 24 prototype compounds and 18 metabolites have been detected in the serum of rats. This work serves the first reference for Qi-Jing-Sheng-Bai chemical components and metabolites. Moreover, it provided a rapid and valid analytical strategy for characterization of the chemical compounds and metabolites of traditional Chinese medicine formula.

        "abstract": "Metabolites derived from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are becoming active substances of pharmacologically as well as promising sources for discovering new drugs. However, detection and identification of constituents in vivo remains a challenge for TCM, due to massive endogenous interference and low abundance of metabolites in biological matrix. Traditional Chinese medicine formula Dan Zhi Tablet (DZT), a well-established TCM formula developed based on years of clinical experiences, was widely used to treat cerebral infraction disease. In this study, an integrated strategy based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) was adopted to comprehensively identify the prototype and metabolite constituents of DZT. The potential constituents were screened by cross orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Automatic matching analysis was performed on UNIFI platform based on the function of predicting metabolites. Using this strategy, a total of 170 compounds, including 51 prototype constituents and 119 metabolites were unambiguously or tentatively identified in rat plasma. Furthermore, 31 compounds have also been detected in rat cerebrospinal fluid. The metabolism reactions included phase I reactions (hydroxylation, hydrolysis, deglycosylation, hydrogenation, demethylation and dehydroxylation) and phase II reactions (conjugation with glutatione, cysteine, acetylcysteine, glucuronide, sulfate). It is the first systematic metabolic study of DZT in vivo and some metabolites were also reported for the first time, which could provide a scientific basis for explaining the multiple functions of DZT. More importantly, the integrated strategy also shows promising perspectives in the identification of the metabolites in TCM from a complicated biological matrix.",

        "abstract": "Dengzhan Shengmai Capsule (DZSMC) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula with remarkable clinical effect in the treatment of stroke sequelae. Exploring the components of DZSMC and detecting the absorbed prototype constituents and metabolites in blood are of great significance to clarify the effective substances of this prescription. Here, a reliable method using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) was established for the comprehensive analysis of chemical constituents of DZSMC and their metabolites in rat plasma after gastric perfusion. Two acquisition modes, including MS mode and Fast DDA mode, were performed for acquiring more precursor ions and cleaner precursor-product ions background during the study of constituents of DZSMC. As a result, a total of 125 constituents were unambiguously characterized or tentatively identified. For the first time, a total of 92 components, including 44 prototype components and 48 metabolites were unambiguously or tentatively identified in rat plasma. The metabolic pathways included phase I reactions (hydration, hydrogenation, oxidation, demethylation and hydroxylation) and phase II reactions (conjugation with glucuronide, sulfate and methyl). Furthermore, the metabolites from caffeic acid and scutellarin were characterized and validated by phase II metabolic reactions in vitro, which could be established as a simulated in vivo environment of metabolites identification and verification of TCM formula. It is the first systematic study on metabolism of DZSMC in vivo and could also provide a valid analytical strategy for characterization of the chemical compounds and metabolites of TCM formula.",

(LJT). 22 polar compounds of various chemical structures and 19 volatile or semi-volatile compounds were tentatively identified from aerial parts of the plant. A number of common composition groups in three separate parts of the plant were proposed, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, iridoids, alkanes, olefins and sterols, the leaf showing higher similarity with the flower bud part via their chemical constituents. Considering the fact that the leaf part has a lot of similar components with the flower bud, this study indicates the leaf part of LJT can be expected to be used as an alternative medicinal resource to the flower bud and stem of the plant.",

EPC proliferation and apoptosis were measured by MTT assay and Annexin-V/PI double labeling, respectively. Cell proliferation- and apoptosis-related factors were examined by Western blotting.Seven days after GI treatment, EPC were arrested at the G(0)/G(1) phase. Treatment with high glucose alone (HG) or GI but not HI (high insulin alone) decreased EPC proliferation and their expression of cyclin E, cdk2 and PCNA compared to control. The inhibitory effects of HG on EPC proliferation and growth-related proteins were more significant than those of GI. HG, GI and HI promoted EPC apoptosis along with caspase-3 overexpression.The result indicated that GI-induced apoptosis and growth inhibition might be one of mechanisms of EPC reduction and dysfunction in diabetes.",

Their  exo / endo  stereochemistry was established by both the characteristic chemical shift of Ha-2\u2032 or Ha-3\u2032 resulting from the deshielding effect of the carbonyl chromophore at C-12 and the diagnostic negative/positive cotton effect, as well as  1  was further confirmed by Cu-K\u03b1 X-ray crystallographic analysis. Compounds  1 \u2013 4  exhibited potent cytotoxicity against human leukemia (CCRF-CEM) cells with IC 50  value of 9.13, 2.03, 4.74, and 13.72\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively.",

These \"omics\" are often based on global analyses of biological samples using high through-put analytical approaches and bioinformatics and may provide new insights into biological phenomena. In this paper, the development and advances in these omics made in the past decades are reviewed, especially genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics; the applications of omics technologies in pharmaceutical research are then summarized in the fields of drug target discovery, toxicity evaluation, personalized medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine; and finally, the limitations of omics are discussed, along with the future challenges associated with the multi-omics data processing, dynamics omics analysis, and analytical approaches, as well as amenable solutions and future prospects.",

        "abstract": "Aim To investigate the inhibitory effect and its possible mechanism of PESV on the metastasis-associated ability of human highly metastatic pancreatic carcinoma MIA-PaCa2-3 cells in vitro,and to provide the theoretical basis for clinical application.Methods MIA-PaCa2-3 pancreatic cancer cell line was chosen with highly metastasis ability as the object.The cell viability was determined by MTT assay and the state of cell proliferation after PESV interference was analyzed.Matrigel invasion assay,Wound Healing assay and Cell adhesion assay were used to detect the migration,the adhesion and the invasion abilities of these cells.To investigate the potential molecule mechanism,Immunocytochemistry-staining and Western blot were used to detect E-cadherin,fibronectin and matrix metalloproteinases-9 positive cells,after these cells were treated by the drugs.Results PESV could inhibit the proliferation of MIA-PaCa2-3 cells in a dose-time dependent manner.It also could inhibit the adhesion,invasion and migration capability.Their inhibitory ratio after treatment with 40 mg\u00b7L-1 PESV for 24 h was(30.3\u00b14.7)%,(42.1\u00b13.7)%,(47.6\u00b13.3)% respectively.Significant changes in the activation of E-cad were detected by Immunocytochemistry and Western blot.The positive expressions of FN and MMP-9 proteinum were down regulated after the drug interference.Conclusions PESV can obviously suppress the pancreatic cancer cell proliferation.It can also inhibite the capability of migration,adhesion and invasion capability.The potential molecule mechanism is perhaps that PESV can enhance the E-cad expression,and reduce FN or MMP-9 expression.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To identify the repopulation in metastatic Lewis lung adenocarcinoma during 5-Fu chemotherapy and observe the inhibition of polypeptide extract from scorpion venom (PESV) on the repopulation. Methods: To make repopulation model, Lewis cells were iv injected into caudal vein of C57BL/6 mice, the mice were ip injected by 5-Fu once every 7 d since day 7 and intervened by ig administration of PESV. Groups were treated differently. Six mice were sacrificed every 7 d, with counting metastatic foci in lung and detecting the level of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and microvessel dentity (MVD) expression in Lewis lung metastatic loci by using immunohistochemistry. Results: In model groups, from day 21 to day 28 the numbers of metastatic big loci increased 2.5 averagely, while from day 14 to day 21 increased 0.8 only; The weight of lung from day 21 to day 28 increased more than that from day 14 to day 21; The expression of PCNA was the lowest in day 21, the highest in day 28, and there was no significant difference between day 28 and day 14; The expression in both high- and low-dose PESV groups in day 28 was lower than that in model group. There was a significant effect in high-dose PESV group. In model group the expression of VEGF in day 28 was upregulated significantly (P<0.01 vs that in model group in day 21). Compared with model group, VEGF expression in high-dose PESV group in day 21 and day 28 was downregulated, especially in day 28 (P<0.01). In low-dose PESV group only in day 28 the difference was found (P<0.05 vs that in model group); The change of MVD was the same as PCNA. The expression was the lowest in day 21, the highest in day 28, and there was no significant difference between day 28 and day 14. While in high-dose PESV group, the number of MVD in day 14 was more than that in day 21, and in day 21 more than in day 28, there were significant differences. In low-dose PESV group, in day 14 more than in day 21, but no significant difference was found between day 21 and day 28. Conclusion: The phenomenon of repopulation acceleration is found in Lewis lung adenocarcinoma during 5-Fu treatment and PESV could inhibit the repopulation through anti-angiogenesis which may be one of the mechanisms of inhibiting tumor cell repopulation.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To investigate the anti-tumor functions and possible mechanism of polypeptide extract from scorpion venom (PESV) on H22 hepatoma with cDNA microarray method. Methods:After establishment of tumor animal model by inoculating H22 s. 60 Kunming mice wearing H22 hepatoma were divided into 4 groups randomly:the model group, PESV group, Gemcitabine group and TNP-40 group. Total RNA of the subcutaneous tumors was extracted using Trizol reagents, and cDNA-labeled fluorescence was synthesized by reverse transcription method. Total RNA preparations from the tumors of these animals were hybridized to Mouse_6 biochip gene chips. Then the array was scanned and the signals were analyzed after hybridization by Imagene 4.0. Results:Compared with control group, 127 genes of the 48000 probe sets were up-regulated by more than 2 folds and 433 genes were down-regulated in tumor tissue treated with PESV. These genes were associated with angiogenesis, cell adhesion, cell cycle, apoptosis, and so on. The datasets identified from PESV-treated group were partly similar to the genes expression regulated by anti-angiogenic agent TNP-740 and partly similar to the regulated genes in response to chemotherapeutics Gemcitabine. PESV extremely not only showed anti-antigenic response but also have chemotherapeutic effects. Conclusions:The results show that PESV may be a promising cytotoxic and anti-antigenic double-response agent for cancer.",

        "abstract": "Objective To observe the inhibition effects of polypeptide extract from scorpion venom (PESV) combined 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) on vasculogenic mimicry (VM) of H 22 hepatoma carcinoma cells in mice and its possible mechanisms. Methods The H 22 carcinoma cell suspension was subcutaneously inoculated into 60 Kunming mice. Then tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into three groups, i.e., the control group, the 5-Fu group, and the combination group (PESV+5-Fu), 20 in each group. The tumor volume was measured once every other day after 14 successive days of intervention. Then the tumor volume growth curve was drawn, and the tumor inhibitory rate was calculated. The morphological changes of the tumor tissue were observed by HE staining. The VM density of each tumor tissue were detected by immunohistochemical assay and periodic acid-schiff stain (PAS). The protein expression levels of hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) were detected using immunohistochemical assay. The gray value was semi-quantitatively analyzed using LeicaQwinV3 Image Analysis Software. Results The growth of H 22 hepatoma transplantation tumor was inhibited more obviously in the combination group and the 5-Fu group than in the control group (P<0.05). There was statistical difference in the tumor weight and the tumor volume between the combination group and the 5-Fu group (P<0.05). Immunohistochemical assay and PAS showed that the VM density was obviously lower in the combination group than in the control group and the 5-Fu group (P<0.01). Compared with the control group, the protein expressions of HIF-1\u03b1 and MMP-2 significantly decreased in the combination group (P<0.01). Conclusions PESV combined 5-Fu could inhibit the generation of VM of H 22 hepatoma transplantation tumor in mice. Its mechanisms might be associated with inhibiting the expressions of HIF-1\u03b1 and MMP-2 in the microenvironment of tumors.",

Methods Ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 was cultured by the routine method, after being treated with PESV at different concentrations, the inhibition of cell proliferation was tested by MTT assay; Immunocytochemistry and Western blotting were applied to detecting the effects of PESV on protein expression of VEGF and TSP-1. Results In a dose-dependent manner, PESV remarkably inhibited the proliferation of SKOV3 at the range of 12.5-200 \u03bcg/mL. PESV (> 50 \u03bcg/mL) had a significant inhibitory effect on cell proliferation (P < 0.01). Western blotting and immunocytochemistry results showed that with the increasing of PESV concentration, the expression levels of VEGF decreased while TSP-1 increased gradually (P < 0.01).

The tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into two groups: the control group and the PESV group. PESV was intragastrically subjected to the mice of the experimental group for 18 days. The tumor volume and tumor inhibitory rate were determined. The expression levels of VEGF,TGF-beta1 and IL-10 in tumor microenvironment were determined by immunohisto-chemistry-staining and ELISA. Surface co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 of tumor infiltrating dendritic cells (DC) were determined by immunohistochemistry-staining and flow cytometry.The growth inhibitory rate of PESV was 56. 60%. The expression levels of VEGF,TGF-beta1 and IL-10 were decreased in tumor and serum, while the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on DC were increased in tumor. Compared with the control group, the differences were all significant (P < 6.05).PESV was effective in recovering immuno-surveillance and intervening immune escape of lung cancer through multi-pathway. And its effects might be attained by decreasing the level of VEGF, TGF-beta1 and IL-10 in tumor microenvironment and increasing the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on DC.",

Method: The expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and SDF-1/CXCR4 in H22 tumor tissue was monitored by immunohistochemistry, and the expression level was determined by Qwin V3 image analyzing software. The correlation between HIF-1\u03b1 and SDF-1 was analyzed. SDF-1 content was detected by ELISA. Result: HIF-1\u03b1 expression was found no difference in model group between 14 d and 21 d, and up-regulated in 28 d. There was no change of HIF-1\u03b1 expression was observed in low-dose PESV group. In high-dose PESV group, the level of HIF-1\u03b1 expression was high in 14 d and low in 21 d. ELISA detecting showed SDF-1 content increased slowly from 14 d to 21 d, highly from 21 d to 28 d. But in high-dose PESV groups, the content increased slowly all the time. The immunohitochemistry method got the same result with ELISA. Correlation analysis showed r =0.805. CXCR4 expression down-regulated in two PESV treated groups, and no difference was found between these two groups. Conclusion: HIF-1\u03b1 and SDF-1 participated in VEGF expression and angiogenesis in tumor tissue during chemotherapy, while PESV could inhibit the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and SDF-1.",

Method: MTT was used to observe cell growth and proliferation of A549 at different concentrations of PESV. Flow cytometry(FCM) was applied to analyze cell cycle distribution. Immunocytochemistry and western blot assay was recruited to detect the expression of VEGF, HIF-1\u03b1, PTEN after the intervention of PESV. Result: A549 cells may be arrested mainly in G 0/G 1 phase and cell proliferation was significantly inhibited (P < 0.01) after PESV intervention in a certain range of concentration. PESV can significantly reduce the expression of HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF and increase the expression of PTEN. Conclusion: PESV can block cell cycle and inhibit angiogenesis directly to inhibit cell proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 mainly through reducing the expression of HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF and increasing the expression of PTEN.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To study the effects of polypeptide extract from scorpion venom (PESV) alliance with chemotherapy on angiogenesis of Lewis lung carcinomas (LLC) and its mechanism. Method: LLC cells suspension (4 \u00d7 106 cells/mL) were subcataneously injected into 54 C57BL/6J mice in right armpits. Then the tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into three groups: the control group, the chemotherapy group and the PESV group. Cyclophosphamide was used to establish the model of cancer. Chemotherapy and PESV were added to the PESV group. Every 7 days, 6 mice of each group were executed, and the experiments were carried out for 28 days. The tumor volume and inhibitory rate were determined. Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR were used to determine the expression of factor VIII, \u03b1-SMA, DII4 and Notch1 in tumor tissue. Correlation analysis was used to identify the relationship of factor VIII and calculate microvessel density (MVD), \u03b1-SMA and vascular maturity. Result: The inhibitory rate of PESV was 42.21%. Comparing with the chemotherapy group, the expression of tumor factor DII4 and Notch1 in the PESV group were decreased significantly (P<0.05). The expression of factor VIII and a-SMA in the che group is lower than the control group (P<0.05), while it's higher when compared with the PESV group (P lt;0.01). Expression of DII4 and Notch1 in the chemotherapy group at the 28th day were higher than the control group (P<0.05), and the expression in the PESV group at the 21st day were significantly lower than the chemotherapy group (P<0.05). Conclusion: PESV could inhibit the angiogenesis of LLC. It might be attained by decreasing the level of angiogenic factors, that are factor VIII, \u03b1-SMA, DII4 and Notch1 in tumor microenvironment.",

Changes of dendritic cells (DCs) phenotype CD80 and CD86 expressions in the tumor tissue were detected using immunofluorescence chemical assay.After 21 successive days of treatment, the growth of Lewis lung cancer transplantation tumor in the combination group was obviously inhibited (P<0.05). Compared with the model group,the expressions of CD80 and CD86 in the PESV group was somewhat enhanced, while those in the CTX group was somewhat lowered. Compared with the CTX group, the fluorescent signal strength and expressions in the combination group somewhat increased. Compared with the model group, the expressions of TGF-beta1 and VEGF-A mRNA decreased in the PESV group and the CTX group (both P<0.05). Compared with the PESV group and the CTX group, the expressions of TGF-beta1 and VEGF-A in the combination group both decreased (both P<0.05).PESV could inhibit the expressions of VEGF and TGF-beta1, promote the maturation of DCs, recover its antigen uptake presentation function, and reverse the immune injury to the body by CTX, thus playing a role in inducing the tumor cell apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To explore the difference on formation mechanism and the pathology in the process of early liver fibration induced by two dose of ethanol. METHODS: 24 male KM mice were randomly divided into 3 groups which are control group,low dose of alcohol group and high dose of alcohol group,respectively. The mice treated with 8 g\u00b7kg-1 \u00b7d-1 ethanol,3 g\u00b7kg-1\u00b7d-1 ethanol by oral were killed 30 days later. The liver histomorphology,inflammation grade and fibration staging were observed and the areas of collagen per high power field were calculated by hematoxylin-feosin ( HE) and Masson staining; the expression of Toll like receptor-4( TLR-4) ,\u03b1-smooth muscle actin ( \u03b1-SMA) and content of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 ( TGF-\u03b2) ,nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-\u043aB) protein,BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor ( Bambi) mRNA were measured using immunohistochemistry,Western blotting,real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction,respectively; apoptosis cell number was calculated by In Situ Nick-End Labeling ( TUNEL) . RESULTS: Different degree of fibration mice induced by ethanol appeared ( P < 0. 01) and hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs) in these mice liver were activated,meanwhile the apoptosis cell number increased too ( P < 0. 01) . The liver fibration at high dose group was more serious than that at low dose group mice,and the number of apoptosis cells showed the same trend as fibration,but the content of Bambi mRNA in high dose group down regulated compared to that in low dose group ( P < 0. 05) . On the other hand,the expression of TLR-4 enhanced in low dose group while decreased in high dose group compared to control group ( P < 0. 01) . CONCLUSION: The mechanism of early mouse liver fibration induced by two dose of alcohol is different. Apoptosis may be more responsible for the liver fibration induced by high dose alcohol than TLR-4 pass way,and there is a TLR-4 independent pathway to down-regulate the Bambi that probably is one of the reasons that the fibrosis is more serious in the high dose group.",

Methods: W256 tumor model was established by continuous ig administration of the extract from the male zooid of A. pernyi (16.53 mg/kg) for 10 d after conventional radiotherapy. To observe the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumor tissue by immunohistochemical staining and the HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA expression by in situ hybridization (ISH). Results: Compared with the model group, immunohistochemistry results showed the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF increased with tendency (P>0.05) in tumor tissue of the rats in radiotherapy group, and the HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF expression in the combination group and the extract from the male zooid of A. pernyi group decreased significantly (P<0.05). HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF were correlation positively (r = 0.649, P<0.01). ISH results revealed the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA was no statistical significance (P>0.05) in radiotherapy group compared with the model group. However, the HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA expression in tumor tissue was lower in both the combined group and the extract from male zooid of A. pernyi group (P<0.05). Conclusion: The extract from male zooid of A. pernyi could down-regulate the HIF-1\u03b1 expression in tumor tissue after radiotherapy or without radiotherapy.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of CD34-positive fibroblasts and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA)-reactive myofibroblasts in the stroma of benign and malignant breast lesions and, secondly, to determine whether the presence of stromal myofibroblasts is associated with some of the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with invasive ductal carcinoma. The presence of stromal CD34-positive fibroblasts and myofibroblasts was investigated (as defined immunohistochemically) in 8 normal breast tissue samples, 58 invasive ductal carcinomas, 9 ductal carcinomas in situ and 16 specimens with benign lesions of the breast (fibroadenomas, ductal hyperplasias). We further studied the correlations between the presence of stromal myofibroblasts with 7 clinicopathological parameters in 58 invasive ductal carcinomas. The results indicated that the stroma of normal breast tissues contained CD34-positive fibroblasts. All benign breast lesions exhibited stromal CD34-positive fibroblasts. In contrast, the stroma of ductal carcinomas showed a complete loss of CD34-positive fibroblasts. alpha-SMA expression in stromal fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) was not detected in normal tissue samples or benign lesions except in 1 case of fibroadenoma, whereas positive myofibroblasts were found in 44.4% of ductal carcinomas in situ and 56.9% of invasive breast carcinomas. Comparison of clinicopathological parameters between invasive ductal carcinomas with and without stromal myofibroblasts revealed significant differences in lymph node metastasis, high histological grade and high microvessel density. These results suggest that CD34 loss and the presence of myofibroblasts favor the diagnosis of breast carcinoma. In invasive ductal carcinoma, the presence of stromal myofibroblasts correlated significantly with pathological parameters associated with a poor prognosis.",

        "abstract": "Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, has recently been shown to affect the development of different types of cancer. The present study utilized a murine H22 hepatocarcinoma model to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in celecoxib-induced inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. Tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into five groups: i) control; ii) low-dose celecoxib (50 mg/kg); iii) high-dose celecoxib (200 mg/kg); iv) 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), (20 mg/kg) and v) combination of 5-FU and celecoxib (50 mg/kg). The antitumor effect of celecoxib was determined by measuring tumor volume. Tumor angiogenesis was evaluated by microvessel density (MVD). Tumor histology and immunostaining for CD34 in endothelial cells were performed to detect MVD. The expression levels of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phospho\u2011Akt (P-Akt), COX-2, hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) were detected by ELISA, immunohistochemistry and western blotting, respectively. We discovered substantial growth delay in murine H22 hepatoma as a result of celecoxib treatment. The inhibition rate of tumor growth induced by high-dose and low-dose celecoxib was 49.3 and 37.0%, respectively (P<0.05). The expression of PI3K, P-Akt, COX-2, HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF-A and PTEN in tumor tissues treated with celecoxib was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, and the MVD was decreased in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). Reduced PI3K and P-Akt was particularly apparent in the high-dose celecoxib group (P<0.05). ELISA and western blotting data showed that the expression of PI3K, P-Akt, COX-2, HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF-A were reduced and PTEN was increased after treatment with celecoxib. In conclusion, the impact of celecoxib-induced tumor growth delay of murine H22 hepatocarcinoma may correlate with the inhibition of angiogenesis by reducing PI3K, P-Akt, COX-2, HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF-A expression and increasing PTEN expression in tumor tissue.",

METHODS: The cervical carcinoma cell lines (HeLa and Caski) were treated with IFN-\u03b1. The expression of MICA was measured by RT-PCR and by immunohistochemical staining. The cytotoxicity of human NK cells to the IFN-\u03b1 treated cervical carcinoma cells was detected by MTT method. RESULTS: The mRNA and protein expression of MICA was up-regulated by IFN-\u03b1 in HeLa and Caski cells in a time and dose-dependent manner. Compared to Caski cells which weakly experessed MICA, higher cytolytic activity of NK cells was found against HeLa cells, which experessed relatively higher level of MICA. After being treated with IFN-\u03b1 for 3 d, the susceptibility of the two cervical carcinoma cells to NK cytolysis was increased significantly. CONCLUSION: IFN-\u03b1 can up-regulate the MICA expression in the cervical carcinoma cell lines and thereby enhance the susceptibility to cytolysis of NK cells.",

        "abstract": "Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) caused by enterovirus\u00a071 (EV71) has emerged as a major health problem in China and worldwide. The present study aimed to understand the virological features of EV71 and host responses resulting from EV71 infection. Six different EV71 strains were isolated from HFMD patients with severe or mild clinical symptoms, and were analyzed for pathogenicity in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. The results demonstrated that the six virus strains exhibited similar cytopathogenic effects on susceptible MA104\u00a0cells. However, marked differences in histological and immunopathological changes were observed when mice were inoculated with the different virus strains. Thus, the viruses studied were divided into two groups, highly or weakly pathogenic. Two representative virus strains, JN200804 and JN200803 (highly and weakly pathogenic, respectively) were studied further to investigate pathogenicity-associated factors, including genetic mutations and immunopathogenesis. The present study has demonstrated that highly pathogenic strains have stable genome and amino acid sequences. Notably, the present study demonstrated that a highly pathogenic strain induced a significant increase of the bulk CD4 T\u00a0cell levels at 3\u00a0days post\u2011inoculation. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that genomic and immunologic factors may be responsible for the multiple tissue damage caused by highly pathogenic EV71 infection. ",

        "abstract": "Aspirin is known to have inhibitory effects on growth development in various types of tumor. In previous studies, it was observed to inhibit angiogenesis by downregulating the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). In the present study, murine H hepatocarcinoma and S180 sarcoma models were used to ascertain whether aspirin could inhibit angiogenesis and promote autophagy in tumors. Tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into four groups with 10 mice per group: i) no treatment; ii) low-dose aspirin (100 mg/kg); iii) high-dose aspirin (400 mg/kg); iv) everolimus group (4 mg/kg). The effects of high-dose aspirin were validated through preliminary experiments. The drug treatment was administered every day for 14 days. The tumor size was measured every other day and then the tumor growth curve was plotted, and the tumor inhibitory rates were calculated. The expression levels of phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), VEGF-A, UNC-51-like kinase-1 (ULK1) and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3A (LC3A) were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis, respectively. We observed that tumor growth delay was achieved in both H hepatocarcinoma and S180 sarcoma models following treatment with aspirin. The tumor growth inhibition rates induced by low and high-dose aspirin and everolimus were 19.6, 33.6 and 53.7% (P<0.05) in H hepatocarcinoma, and 25.7, 40.6 and 48.7% (P<0.05) in S180 sarcoma. The immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis data from the models revealed that the expression of p-mTOR, HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF-A was decreased, while the expression of ULK1 and LC3A was increased following treatment with aspirin and everolimus. The changes were more apparent in the high-dose aspirin and everolimus groups (P<0.01). The inhibitory action of aspirin and everolimus on tumor angiogenesis may be through inhibiting the expression of p-mTOR, HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF-A. Alternatively, aspirin may induce autophagy by inhibiting the mTOR signaling target and then increasing ULK1 and LC3A.",

This paper analyzes the coupling mechanism of communication signal line based on E1 signal cable model and transient solution method when a lightning strike occurs. This paper established frequency variable transmission line model of the E1 signal cable, and achieved the E1 line transient calculation under the excitation of lightning radiation field based on the time-domain finite-element method. While the design of RF conduction disturbance tests system, the measurements and the simulation results are comparable and verified the correctness of the model. Based on the model, the transient voltage of communication cable is analyzed and calculated under lightning. The coupling mechanism was revealed. The generated influence of communication data is predicted when a lightning strike occurs. At the same time in order to inhibit the interference effects, the filter and single point grounding of the protective measures effective is provided.",

Electromagnetic interference characteristic was analyzed by the model in this paper. The near electric field distribution and far field propagation were calculated in different frequencies. Finally, the comparison between the electromagnetic calculated results and the RFI limits of HV and MV substations at 200 meters distance was provided, which indicated the electromagnetic calculation results satisfied the limits.

        "abstract": "The setup for testing radiated disturbance induced by insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) and auxiliary circuits was established. The radiated disturbance characteristics of auxiliary circuits and methods to suppress the radiated electromagnetic interference (EMI) were experimentally studied. The radiated EMI bandwidth of the auxiliary circuit was concentrated in the range 30\u2013300\u00a0MHz. The mathematical model for an IGBT was proposed based on the setup, which includes all the structures of the IGBT in detail. The electric fields were calculated from the IGBT model using the method of moments. Moreover, the characteristics of the radiated disturbances due to the IGBT operation and the effects of metal on the radiated electric fields were experimentally and calculatingly studied in the frequency range 1\u201330\u00a0MHz. The metal shielded box of drive can increase the radiated electric fields by approximately 10\u201330\u00a0dB in the range 1\u201330\u00a0MHz. The electric fields for all the frequencies decreased rapidly with the increase of distance. Additionally, methods to shield the IGBT in order to suppress the radiated EMI were proposed. The effective radiated EMI reduction from a shielded net was approximately 20\u00a0dB, and that of a shielded box was around 30\u00a0dB.",

Through simulation of the real secondary cablesu0027 layout, we proposed that cableu0027s shielding sheath should be grounded only in protecting cabin for a single secondary cable harness with armor double-ended grounded. Through test on a four-segment secondary cable carried out in one UHVDC convertor substation, we found itu0027s benefit to ensure shielding sheath be grounded both in phase Bu0027s operating cabinet and terminal box at least. Besides, for the purpose of suppressing interference on cores caused by ground potential rise, through comparison we can get one of the most effective grounding way is guaranteeing armor and shielding sheath grounded both in protecting cabin and terminal box, meanwhile, the armor and sheath among operating cabinet should be grounded only in phase Bu0027s cabinet.",

Moreover, it was demonstrated that the recyclable-catalyst-aided, opened-to-air, and sunlight-photolyzed RAFT (ROS-RAFT) polymerizations can be successfully carried out to fabricate precise and predictable polymers in the presence of the recyclable magnetic semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs).

The glass transition temperature, which is a key parameter influencing the long-term stability of polymer nanostructures, has not yet been systematically studied and well understood. Here we study this technological and fundamental issue with polymers of different values of molar mass M confined in nanocylinders of a varying diameter D. The glass transition temperature Tg loses its dependence on the molar mass for D \u2272 100 nm, a range in which the relative depression of Tg varies as D(-0.44). For higher cylinder diameters, Tg progressively recovers its dependence on the molar mass. This is quantitatively reproduced by a model based on an equilibrium interfacial excess of free volume, which needs to be created unless provided by the chain ends. Our findings suggest that the structural perturbations during nanofabrication may strongly affect the long-term stability of arrays of polymer nanostructures. ",

We recently developed a new and lymph node (LN) targeting adjuvant (D-CpG) by chemical conjugation type B CpG DNA with FDA-approved dextran polymer for lymph node imaging. To elucidate the possible antitumor mechanisms of this adjuvant, prophylaxis and therapeutic models of melanoma were used in this study. Our results showed that D-CpG was an efficient adjuvant of protein-based tumor vaccine in both prophylaxis and therapeutic models. It enhanced the tumor-specific Th1 and CTL responses. It also facilitated the tumor infiltration of the T cells and promoted IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 production of both CD4 and CD8 T cells. In therapeutic model, D-CpG included tumor vaccine decreased the percentage of CD11bGr1 MDSCs in spleen and inhibited their infiltration in tumor microenvironments. Administration of the D-CpG included vaccine significantly inhibited lung metastasis of the tumor through similar mechanisms. In conclusion, D-CpG used as tumor vaccine adjuvant can enhance both Th1 and CTL responses and inhibit CD11bGr1 MDSCs, which may have general applicability to the development of vaccines against tumors.",

However, IVD is susceptible to damage and even failure due to injury, pathology and aging. Annulus fibrosus (AF), the structural and functional integrity of which is critically essential to confine nucleus pulpous (NP) and maintain physiological intradiscal pressure under mechanical loading, plays a critical role in the biomechanical properties of IVD. AF degeneration commonly results in substantial deterioration of IVD. During this process, the biomechanical properties of AF and the balance between anabolism and catabolism in IVD are progressively disrupted, leading to chronic back pain and even disability of individuals. Therefore, repairing and regenerating AF are effective treatments to degeneration-associated pains. However, they remain highly challenging due to the complexity of natural AF tissue in the aspects of cell phenotype, biochemical composition, microstructure, and mechanical properties. Tissue engineering (TE), by combining biological science and materials engineering, shed lights on AF regeneration. In this article, we review recent advances in the pro-anabolic approaches in the form of cell delivery, bioactive factors delivery, gene therapy and TE strategies for achieving AF regeneration.",

However, regeneration of AF still faces many challenges due to the tremendous complexity of this tissue and lack of in-depth understanding of the structure-function relationship at cellular level within AF is highly required. In light of the fact that AF is composed of various types of cells and has gradient mechanical, topographical and biochemical features along the radial direction. In this study, we aimed to achieve directed differentiation of AF-derived stem cells (AFSCs) by mimicking the mechanical and topographical features of native AF tissue. AFSCs were cultured on four types of electrospun poly(ether carbonate urethane) urea (PECUU) scaffolds with various stiffness and fiber size (soft, small size; stiff, small size; soft, large size and stiff, large size). The results show that with constant fiber size, the expression level of the outer AF (oAF) phenotypic marker genes in AFSCs increased with the scaffold stiffness, while that of inner AF (iAF) phenotypic marker genes showed an opposite trend. When scaffold stiffness was fixed, the expression of oAF phenotypic marker genes in AFSCs increased with fiber size. While the expression of iAF phenotypic marker genes decreased. Such substrate stiffness- and topography- dependent changes of AFSCs was in accordance with the genetic and biochemical distribution of AF tissue from the inner to outer regions. Further, we found that the Yes-associated protein (YAP) was translocated to the nucleus in AFSCs cultured with increasing stiffness and fiber size of scaffolds, yet it remained mostly phosphorylated and cytosolic in cells on soft scaffolds with small fiber size. Inhibition of YAP down-regulated the expression of tendon/ligament-related genes, whereas expression of the cartilage-related genes was upregulated. The results illustrate that matrix stiffness is a potent regulator of AFSC differentiation. Moreover, we reveal that fiber size of scaffolds induced changes in cell adhesions and determined cell shape, spreading area, and extracellular matrix expression. In all, both mechanical property and topography features of scaffolds regulate AFSC differentiation, possibly through a YAP-dependent mechanotransduction mechanism.",

Here we report a high throughput technique that carried out in multiwell plates via recyclable-catalyst-aided, opened-to-air, and sunlight-photolyzed RAFT (ROS-RAFT) polymerization. By using this method, three key monomers (MAG the sugar unit, DMAPMA the positively charged monomer, and DEMAA the hydrophobic monomer) can be polymerized in a controlled manner to afford glycopolymers. This simple high throughput technology is used to synthesize glycopolymers with variable compositions. The bacterial adhesion/killing ability and cytotoxicity of synthesized polymers have been evaluated, and glycopolymers with certain composition can achieve a balance of low cytotoxic and good antibacterial activity.",

All the final miktoarm star block copolymers were characterized by GPC and 1H NMR spectra. Interestingly, the hydrogen bonding interactions have a great effect on the water solubility of PAA chains, and the nonlinear MHBCs solutions showed sharp phase separation at pH = 7.0. The novel water-soluble nonlinear MHBCs consisting of pH-responsive PAA segments, thermoresponsive PNIPAAM segments, and hydrophilic, noncharged and biocompatible PNVP segments tend to self-assemble into three different types of micellar aggregates and umimers, which can be reversibly controlled by pH value and temperature of aqueous solution of these copolymers. \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.",

However, its expression and function in spinal cord injury (SCI) are still unknown. Here, we demonstrated that expression of TCTP was dynamic changed after acute spinal cord injury. Our results showed that TCTP gradually increased, reached a peak at 3\u00a0day, and then declined to basal levels at 14\u00a0days after spinal cord injury. Upregulation of TCTP was accompanied with an increase in the levels of proliferation proteins such as PCNA. Immunofluorescent labeling also showed that TCTP located in astrocytes and traumatic SCI induced TCTP colocalizated with PCNA. These results indicated that TCTP might play an important role in astrocyte proliferation. To further probe the role of TCTP, TCTP-specific siRNA-transfected astrocytes showed significant decrease of primary astrocyte proliferation. Surprisingly, TCTP knockdown also reduced primary astrocyte migration, as the reorganization of microtubules and F-actin was disturbed after siRNA transfection. All above indicated that TCTP might play a crucial role in astrocyte proliferation and migration. Collectively, our data suggested that TCTP might play important roles in CNS pathophysiology after SCI.",

Moreover, double immunofluorescence staining revealed that CCT8 was co-expressed with neuronal nuclei (NeuN). Besides, co-localization of CCT8/active caspase 3 was detected in NeuN. We also examined the expression profiles of active caspase 3 whose changes were correlated with the expression of CCT8. All our findings suggested that CCT8 might be involved in the pathophysiology of brain after TBI.",

        "abstract": "SCY1-like 1-binding protein 1 (SCYL1BP1) is first identified as an interacting protein with SCYL1. Since SCYL1BP1 is a soluble protein with coiled-coil domains known to be relevant with transcriptional regulation, it has been found to activate the transcription of murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and participate in neurite outgrowth and regeneration. However, the role and mechanism of SCYL1BP1 in peripheral nerve system lesion and repair are still unknown. Here in vitro, our work demonstrated that SCYL1BP1 inhibited cAMP-induced primary Schwann cell differentiation and suppressed nerve growth factor-mediated neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells by enhancing the RhoA pathway. Furthermore, we found that pretreatment with a Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 resulted in partial rescue of Schwann cell differentiation and neurite outgrowth. In vivo experiments showed that SCYL1BP1 could also suppress nerve fiber regeneration. In conclusion, we speculated that SCYL1BP1 participated in Schwann cell (SC) differentiation and neurite outgrowth in the sciatic nerve after crush by regulating the RhoA pathway.",

        "abstract": "Abstract EP3 is prostaglandin E2 receptor subtype 3 and mediates the activation of several signaling pathways, changing in cAMP levels, calcium mobilization, and activation of phospholipase C. Previous studies demonstrated a direct role for EP3 in various neurodegenerative disorders, such as stroke and Alzheimer disease. However, the distribution and function of EP3 in ICH diseases remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that EP3 may be involved in neuronal apoptosis in the processes of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). From the results of Western blot and immunohistochemistry, we obtained a significant up-regulation of EP3 in neurons adjacent to the hematoma following ICH. Up-regulation of EP3 was found to be accompanied by the increased expression of active caspase-3 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and decreased expression of anti-apoptotic protein B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) in vivo and vitro studies. Furthermore, the expression of these three proteins reduced active caspase-3 and Bax expression, while increased Bcl-2 were changed after knocking down EP3 by RNA interference in PC12 cells, further confirmed that EP3 might exert its pro-apoptotic function on neuronal apoptosis. Thus, EP3 may play a role in promoting the neuronal apoptosis following ICH.",

        "abstract": "Astrocyte-elevated gene-1 (AEG-1), also known as metadherin (MTDH) and lysine-rich CEACAM1 coisolated (LYRIC), has emerged as an important oncogene that regulates key cellular processes including apoptosis, migration, invasion, proliferation, and differentiation. It was reported that AEG-1 enhanced breast cancer cells migration in a NF-\u03baB-dependent manner. Also, AEG-1 contributed cell proliferation through the PI3K-Akt/cyclin pathway. Besides, AEG-1 is implicated in diverse physiological and pathological diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as brain tumors, neuroblastomas, neurodegeneration, and neuronal development. However, the role of AEG-1 in the process of peripheral nervous regeneration after injury remains virtually unknown. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal expression of AEG-1 in a rat sciatic nerve crush model. At its peak expression, AEG-1 was expressed mainly in Schwann cells of the distal sciatic nerve segment from injury, but had few colocalizations in axons. Besides, the peak expression of AEG-1 was in parallel with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In vitro, we detected the increased expression of AEG-1 during the process of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)-induced Schwann cell proliferation. Meanwhile, interference of AEG-1 inhibited both proliferation and migration of Schwann cells. In conclusion, we speculated that AEG-1 is involved in biochemical and physiological responses after sciatic nerve crush (SNC). ",

        "abstract": "We demonstrated for the first time that, at temperatures below the melting point of a given polar solvent, the emission of some four-coordinate monoboron complexes containing monoanionic bidentate (NO) ligands shifted to lower wavelengths, but no such shift was observed for studies conducted in nonpolar solvents. This means that the emission from a polar solvent appears at shorter wavelengths if compared with that from a nonpolar solvent when the measurement was performed at low temperatures, a phenomenon totally different from that observed for conventional solvatochromic fluorophores. The finding was rationalized by considering the temperature-dependent conformational relaxation of the tetrahedron monoboron complexes from their local excited (LE) state to their relaxed excited (RE) state. Further studies revealed that variating the structure of the chelating ligands could result in remarkable changes in the fluorescent colors of the monoboron complexes. However, changing the structure of other two monod...",

        "abstract": "A series of electron-accepting chalcogen-bridged viologen with narrow HOMO-LUMO band gaps and low LUMO levels is reported. The novel chalcogenoviologens have planar rigid backbones and a set of extra redox centres. The band gaps of chalcogenoviologens decreased systematically from S-viologen to Se-viologen to Te-viologen. Herein, in-situ electrochemical spectroscopy was performed on the proof-of-concept electrochromic devices (ECD). Visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution was carried out due to the strong absorption of Se-BnV2+ and Te-BnV2+ in the visible light range. Remarkably, E-BnV2+ was not only used as a photosensitizer, but also an electron mediator. The higher apparent quantum yield of Se-BnV2+ could be interpreted in terms of different energy levels and faster electron-transfer rates, as well as faster formation of radical species.",

        "abstract": "The introduction of main group elements into conjugated scaffolds is emerging as a key route to novel optoelectronic materials. Herein, an efficient and versatile way to synthesize polymerizable 9,10-azaboraphenanthrene ()-containing monomers by aromaticity-driven ring expansion reactions between highly antiaromatic borafluorene and azides is reported, and the corresponding conjugated small molecules and polymers are developed as well. The -containing small molecules and conjugated polymers showed good air/moisture stability and notable fluorescence properties. Addition of fluoride ions to the -based small molecules and polymers induced a rapid change in the emission color from blue to green/yellow, respectively, accompanied by strong intensity changes. The conjugated polymers showed better ratiometric sensing performance than small molecules due to the exciton migration along the conjugated chains. Further experiments showed that the sensing process is fully reversible. The films prepared by solution-deposition of -based compounds in the presence of polycaprolactone also showed good ratiometric sensing for fluoride ions.",

They were used as anodic materials in organic radical Li-ion batteries (ORLIBs). Introduction of heavy atoms (S, Se, and Te) into viologen scaffold significantly improved the capacity and cycling stability of the ORLIBs. Notably, the poly(Te-BnV) anode had an intercalation ability of 20 Li-ions and showed higher conductivity and insolubility in the electrolyte, hence contributing to a reversible capacity of 502 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 when the Coulombic efficiency approached 100%. To the best of our knowledge, the poly(Te-BnV) anode has the highest reported capacity to date for a viologen-based electrode. Based on their unique electrochromic and redox properties, flexible electrochromic batteries were fabricated, the charged/discharged state could be visually monitored. This work presents a promising avenue for the development of organic polymer-based electrodes for flexible hybrid visual electronics.",

This air and moisture stable compound can be used as a turn-off type fluorescent fluoride (F \u2212 ) sensor in THF with good selectivity and reversibility. The DFT calculation and the fluorescence quenching titration results showed that the mechanism of the sensing process was based on a competing reaction: the formation of  2-F  with the stronger B F bond in an open form took the place of  2  with B\u2190N bond in a closed form when F \u2212  was introduced, leading to significant absorption changing and fluorescence quenching.",

        "abstract": "The high-speed train gearbox is one of the key components of the train system, and its working state is related to passengers\u2019 safety. The gearbox shell is the protective shell for gears under harsh and complex service environment. Instantaneous impact of hard material during failure can lead to the rapid damage accumulation and fracture of the shell material. In this article, the accumulation of tensile damage of the high-speed train gearbox shell material has been studied. For the short tensile process leading to significant amount of damage, a real-time and non-destructive detection method has been used to monitor the tensile damage progression and predict the residual life of the material. An automatic optimization algorithm has been proposed to deal with data quality problems such as fluctuations, imbalances, and large intervals. In addition, an automatic life prediction optimization model for material tensile process has been established. The life prediction errors are controlled within 50 s, and the majority of errors are less than 20 s. For the accelerated test, in respect to real situation, a 6 h time slot is designed for disaster control such as passenger evacuation and train failure prevention.",

        "abstract": "Aiming to alleviate traffic congestion, many congestion avoidance and traffic optimization systems have been proposed recently. However, most of them suffer from three main problems. Firstly scalability: they rely on a centralized server, which has to perform intensive communication and computational tasks. Secondly unpredictability: they use smartphones and other sensors to detect the congested roads and warn upcoming vehicles accordingly. In other words, they are used to solve the problem rather than avoiding it. Lastly, infrastructure dependency: they assume the presence of pre-installed infrastructures such as roadside unit (RSU) or cellular 3G/4G networks. Motivated by the above-mentioned reasons, in this paper, we proposed a fully distributed and infrastructure-less congestion avoidance and traffic optimization system for VANET (Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks) in urban environments named DIFTOS (Distributed Infrastructure-Free Traffic Optimization System), in which the city map is divided into a hierarchy of servers. The vehicles that are located in the busy road intersections play the role of servers, thus DIFTOS does not rely on any centralized server and does not need internet connectivity or RSU or any kind of infrastructure. As far as we know, in the literature of congestion avoidance using VANET, DIFTOS is the first completely infrastructure-free congestion avoidance system. The effectiveness and scalability of DIFTOS have been proved by simulation under different traffic conditions.",

        "abstract": "With the emergence of autonomous vehicles and internet of vehicles (IoV), future roads of smart cities will have a combination of autonomous and automated vehicles with regular vehicles that require human operators. To ensure the safety of the road commuters in such a network, it is imperative to enhance the performance of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Real-time driving risk prediction is a fundamental part of an ADAS. Many driving risk prediction systems have been proposed. However, most of them are based only on vehicle\u2019s velocity. But in most of the accident scenarios, other factors are also involved, such as weather conditions or driver fatigue. In this paper, we proposed an accident prediction system for Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) in urban environments, in which we considered the crash risk as a latent variable that can be observed using multi-observation such as velocity, weather condition, risk location, nearby vehicles density and driver fatigue. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was used to model the correlation between these observations and the latent variable. Simulation results showed that the proposed system has a better performance in terms of sensitivity and precision compared to state of the art single factor schemes.",

In this study, the acoustic emission instrument has been used for real-time and non-destruction monitoring fatigue damage progress of high strength aluminium alloy which is the material of high speed train gearbox shell. By comparing with the fatigue damage progress, the feature parameter and its threshold of acoustic emission (AE) signal for classifying the states has been defined. The consistence of the feature is discussed by Hurst index method.

The microstructures of the coatings were characterized by means of X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDXA), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results indicated that the coatings have an amorphous structure embedded with a few nanocrystalline phases and dendrites. A partial substitution of Ni by Sn can improve the glass forming ability of Ti-base metallic glass system, and induce the formation of nano-sized Ni 2 SnTi phase during the cyclic laser heating. The tribological behavior of both the substrate and the coatings was investigated in detail. A significant improvement in both the hardness and the wear resistance of the coatings was achieved with the addition of Sn. The relationship between the wear resistance and the microstructures of the coatings was discussed.",

In this work, Ti-36Nb-2Ta-3Zr-0.35O (TNTZO) (wt.%) wire was added to reinforce titanium to prepare titanium matrix composites (TMC) through Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS). The effects of the sintering temperature on microstructures and mechanical properties were investigated. The results showed that with the increasing of the sintering temperature from 800 to 1100\u00a0\u00b0C, the diffusion thickness between the matrix and the wires increases from 5 to 200\u00a0\u03bcm. \u03b1u0027 phase was observed in the diffusion layer at 1000 and 1100\u00a0\u00b0C. Both the volume fraction and the lamellar thickness of \u03b1u0027 phase increase with the sintering temperature increasing. The mechanical properties of the TMC were significantly improved by the addition of TNTZO wire, especially tensile strength. The TMC sintered at 900\u00a0\u00b0C shows a tensile strength as high as 768\u00a0MPa and good ductility (12.4%). Mechanical properties are also correlated with the microstructure of the matrix and the phase constitutions in the diffusion layer.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Refractory high entropy alloys with compositions of TiNbTa 0.5 Zr and TiNbTa 0.5 ZrAl 0.2  were prepared by powder metallurgy. The alloys were hot deformed at 800\u202f\u00b0C with a strain rate of 0.001s \u22121 . The microstructural evolution, precipitation behavior and flow behavior at different compressive strain were investigated. Results show that the alloys are single BCC phase. The hot deformation induces precipitation both in grain boundaries and inside grains. The critical compressive strain for intragranular precipitation of TiNbTa 0.5 Zr and TiNbTa 0.5 ZrAl 0.2  alloys is 20% and 10%, respectively. The precipitates are BCC phase and enriched with Nb and Ta, while the deformed matrix is enriched with Zr. A bi-modal grain size microstructure with micro-scaled intergranular precipitates and nano-scaled intragranular precipitates is achieved after being deformed to 50%. The precipitation leads to a significant flow softening during deformation. And after hot deformation, the TiNbTa 0.5 ZrAl 0.2  alloy has a compressive yield strength of 1500\u202fMPa with a high compressive strain of 18% at room temperature, mainly due to the bi-modal grain size microstructure.",

The microstructure and the phase aggregate were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry, respectively. Microhardness, wear resistance and corrosion behavior were assessed using a Vickers microhardness tester, a ball-on-disk wear testing machine and the electrochemical measurement method, respectively. Microstructural studies show that the coatings possess a densely layered structure with the porosity less than 2.1%. The tribological behavior of the coatings examined under dry conditions shows that their relative wear resistance is five times higher than that of the substrate material. Both adhesive wear and abrasive wear contribute to the friction, but the former is the dominant wear mechanism of the metallic glass coatings. The coatings exhibit low passive current density and extremely wide passive region in 3.5% NaCl solution, thus indicating excellent corrosion resistance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Recently, high-entropy alloys (HEAs) reinforced with ceramic particles have attracted increasing attentions due to their excellent hardness, strength and wear resistance. In this study, AlCoCrFeNi-xNbC high-entropy alloy (HEA) coatings (x\u202f=\u202f10, 20, 30\u202fwt%) were prepared by laser cladding. The phase constituents, microstructure and mechanical properties of the HEAs were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), microhardness and wear resistance tests. Due to the high entropy effect, the AlCoCrFeNi HEAs composites comprise only simple BCC and FCC structure phases. The addition of NbC particles results in a decrease in the fraction of the FCC phase. NbC particles are mainly distributed at the grain boundary in the HEAs with the addition of NbC. NbC particles have an advantage on the inhibition of HEA grain growth due to a strong pinning effect. The microhardness and the wear resistance of HEA composite improved significantly with the addition of NbC particles. A good comprehensive mechanical properties was obtained at the HEA with the addition of 20\u202fwt% NbC particles. For the 20\u202fwt% NbC-adding HEA, the average Vickers hardness is 525 HV, the average friction coefficient value is 1.023 and the mass loss is 1.05\u202fmg.",

The microstructures were investigated by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope, and the elastic modulus was evaluated by nanoindentation testing technique. The evolution of the volume fractions of \u03c9 phase was investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results indicated that the phase constitution and elastic modulus of the Ti\u2013Mo alloys are sensitive to the Mo content. Ti\u20133.2Mo and Ti\u20138Mo alloys containing only \u03b1 and \u03b2 phases, respectively, have a low elastic modulus. In contrast, Ti\u20134.5Mo, Ti\u20136Mo, Ti\u20137Mo alloys, with different contents of \u03c9 phase, have a high elastic modulus. A simple micromechanical model was used to calculate the elastic modulus of \u03c9 phase (E\u03c9), which was determined to be 174.354 GPa.",

In the first approach, each of the energy storage terms is directly calculated based on available observations, and in the second approach, the total energy storage is fitted by the piecewise linear regression function. The heat flux estimates are validated with the eddy correlation (EC) measurements at two carefully selected stations with different land covers and weather conditions in northwestern China and east of the Tibetan Plateau, respectively. In contrast to the variational method without considering the energy storage in the cost function, two new approaches have improved the heat flux estimates, with the first approach being slightly better, especially around midday and/or under strong unstable conditions. It is also reasonable that the calculated/fitted energy storage with the measurements in the previous time pe...",

        "abstract": "The high-temperature cycling stability at a high cutoff voltage of LiNi 0.5Co 0.2Mn 0.3O 2 was improved by TiO 2 coating. The mechanism of enhancement was elucidated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analyses. TiO 2 coating formed a uniform layer on the surface of LiNi 0.5Co 0.2Mn 0.3O 2 particles without changing the crystal structure. Electrochemical tests indicated that TiO 2 coating can improve the lithium ion intercalation stability at 328 K and at a high cutoff voltage of 4.4 V. The 1.0% TiO 2-coated LiNi 0.5Co 0.2Mn 0.3O 2 discharged 149.2 mAh g -1 after 100 cycles at 0.5C, and maintained 92.1% of the initial discharge capacity. By contrast, the bare sample discharged only 87.7 mAh g -1 with 48.2% capacity retention. ICP-AES results proved that the TiO 2 coating layer can reduce the dissolution of transition metal ions from LiNi 0.5Co 0.2Mn 0.3O 2. EIS and XPS confirmed that the improved cycling stability can be attributed to the suppression of the reaction between cathode and electrolyte in lithium-ion batteries. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The key trick of the solvothermal method is to use crystal water of the raw material Fe(NO 3) 3\u00b79H 2O as the water phase in the water/oil \"micro-reactor\" system. Interestingly, one hole is found on the surface of almost each \u03b1-Fe 2O 3/Fe 3O 4 hollow sphere. The obtained material is characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmer-Teller analysis, elemental analysis and its electrochemical properties are also studied. This Fe 3O 4C composite material shows a high reversible capacity of 917.3 mAh g -1 at 90 mA g -1, 849.3 mAh g -1 at 900 mA g -1, and can be employed as excellent anode material for high energy-density lithium ion battery. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

Unlike other 1550 nm based drive lasers that select the THz output frequency by temperature-tuning the IR laser wavelength, the pump lasers used in this study can be electronically tuned across the entire C-band, allowing quick selection of the THz output frequency in the 100 GHz-1200 GHz band.

        "abstract": "The surfactant structure\u2013performance relationship and application properties in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) for binary mixtures of anionic and cationic surfactants are presented and discussed. A polyoxyethylene ether carboxylate anionic surfactant was blended with a quaternary ammonium chloride cationic surfactant and tested for a high-temperature, low-salinity, and high-hardness condition as found in an oil reservoir. These mixtures were tailored by phase behavior tests to form optimal microemulsions with normal octane (n-C8) and crude oil having an API gravity of 48.05\u00b0. The ethoxy number of the polyoxyethylene carboxylate anionic surfactant and the chain length of the cationic surfactant were tuned to find an optimal surfactant blend. Interfacial tensions with n-C8 and with crude oil were measured. Synergism between anionic and cationic surfactants was indicated by surface tension measurement, CMC determination, calculation of surface excess concentrations and area per molecule of individual surfactants and their mixtures. Molecular interactions of anionic and cationic surfactants in mixed monolayers and aggregates were calculated by using regular solution theory to find molecular interaction parameters \u03b2 \u03c3 and \u03b2 M . Morphologies of surfactant solutions were studied by cryogenic TEM. The use of binary mixtures of anionic/cationic surfactants significantly broadens the scope of application for conventional chemical EOR methods.",

The base blast furnace slag composition in SiO-AlO-CaO-MgO system is fixed at CaO/SiO=1.1, 16 wt% AlO and 8 wt% MgO. The liquidus temperatures of the synthetic slags have been determined by high temperature equilibration, quenching and Electron Probe X-ray Microanalysis (EPMA) techniques. It was found that within the present investigated composition ranges, the additions of minor elements to the BF slags remain in melilite primary phase field. The minor element decrease the liquidus temperatures of the blast furnace slags in different extents and follows the tendency: BO u003e CaS u003e NaO u003e KO u003e TiO u003e MnO. The present measurements were also compared with FactSage predictions.",

        "abstract": "Differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) is a common malignancy. The general treatments are thyroidectomy of the affected lobe along with lymphadenectomy. However, bone metastasis is rare in DTC compared with other malignancies and the management of metastasis foci is still controversial. Here we present a case of follicular thyroid carcinoma with the 6th cervical vertebra body metastasis successfully treated by total thyroidectomy, cervical corpectomy, and internal fixation, followed by hormone replacement therapy and radioiodine therapy. Eleven additional patients diagnosed as thyroid carcinoma with bone metastasis collected from Chinese literature between January 1996 and December 2013 were also reviewed. The mean age of the 12 patients at presentation was (53.9\u00b19.2) years (rang, 42-72 years) and the male to female ratio was 1:2. Nine cases received total/near-total thyroidectomy or lobectomy while the other three patients refused for personal reasons. The interventions for bone metastasis were one-stage operation (9/12), I(131) adjuvant therapy (3/12), chemotherapy (1/12), and no intervention (1/12). During the follow-up, two patients died of metastatic carcinoma recurrence, one died of multiple organ metastasis, and one with an unknown reason. We conclude that the management of thyroid carcinoma with bone metastasis needs multidisciplinary cooperation. Surgical resection is still the first choice for cure, while the combined one-stage operation on the primary and metastatic sites followed by hormone replacement therapy and radioiodine therapy is an applicable treatment.",

        "abstract": "Gastric cancer is the fourth most common malignancy globally. In order to decrease the dosage and side effects of conventional chemotherapy, and achieve improved benefits from molecular targeted therapy, novel drug delivery systems were developed in the present study. Oxaliplatin-Au-FeO-Herceptin acts as a dual-functional nanoparticles (NPs) conjugate and possesses the capability of human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeting and oxaliplatin delivery. The 8-20 nm Au-FeO were synthesized by decomposing iron pentacarbonyl on the surfaces of Au NPs in the presence of oleic acid and oleylamine. Following being coated with polyethylene glycol, the NPs possessed a \u03b6-potential of 13.8\u00b11.6 mV and were demonstrated to exhibit no cytotoxicity when Fe concentration is <100 \u00b5g/ml via an MTS assay. Mass spectrometry analysis detected a peak at m/z 148,000, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance indicated peaks at \u03b4 3.51 (8.00H, s, 3-H), 2.97-3.02 (3.80H, t, 2-H) and 2.72-2.76 (3.72H, t, 1-H) following successful loading with Herceptin and oxaliplatin probes. A drug release assay via dialysis cassettes demonstrated that 25% of the oxaliplatin was released at pH 8.0, however >58% was released at pH 6.0 following 4 h incubation, indicating its pH-dependent release characteristic. The active targeting feature of oxaliplatin-Au-FeO-Herceptin was verified in a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model containing SGC-7901 cells via detecting aggregated low intensity in T-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, which was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Therefore, oxaliplatin-Au-FeO-Herceptin is a promising multifunctional platform for simultaneous magnetic traceable and HER2 targeted chemotherapy for gastric cancer.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study is to analyse the efficacy rate of folate for the treatment of hyperhomocysteinaemia (HHcy) and to explore how folate metabolism-related gene polymorphisms change its efficacy. This study also explored the effects of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions on the efficacy of folate. A prospective cohort study enrolling HHcy patients was performed. The subjects were treated with oral folate (5 mg/d) for 90 d. We analysed the efficacy rate of folate for the treatment of HHcy by measuring homocysteine (Hcy) levels after treatment. Unconditioned logistic regression was conducted to analyse the association between SNP and the efficacy of folic acid therapy for HHcy. The efficacy rate of folate therapy for HHcy was 56\u00b741 %. The MTHFR rs1801133 CT genotype, TT genotype and T allele; the MTHFR rs1801131 AC genotype, CC genotype and C allele; the MTRR rs1801394 GA genotype, GG genotype and G allele; and the MTRR rs162036 AG genotype and AG+GG genotypes were associated with the efficacy of folic acid therapy for HHcy (P<0\u00b705). No association was seen between other SNP and the efficacy of folic acid. The optimal model of gene-gene interactions was a two-factor interaction model including rs1801133 and rs1801394. The optimal model of gene-environment interaction was a three-factor interaction model including history of hypertension, history of CHD and rs1801133. Folate supplementation can effectively decrease Hcy level. However, almost half of HHcy patients failed to reach the normal range. The efficacy of folate therapy may be genetically regulated.",

We aimed to use two common genetic risk score (GRS) methods to construct prediction models for the efficacy of folic acid therapy on HHcy, and the best gene-environment prediction model was screened out. A prospective cohort study enrolling 638 HHcy patients was performed. We used logistic regression model to estimate the associations of two GRS methods with the efficacy. Performances were compared using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The simple count genetic risk score (SC-GRS) and weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) were found to be independently associated with the efficacy of folic acid treatment for HHcy. Using the SC-GRS, per risk allele increased with a 1.46-fold increased failure risk (P &lt; 0.001) after adjustment for traditional risk factors including age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption, history of diabetes, history of hypertension, history of hyperlipidemia, history of stroke, and history of coronary heart disease. When used the wGRS, the association was strengthened (OR = 2.08, P &lt; 0.001). Addition of the SC-GRS and wGRS to the traditional risk model significantly improved the predictive ability by AUC (0.859). A precise gene-environment predictive model with good performance was developed for predicting the treatment failure rate of folic acid therapy for HHcy.",

        "abstract": "Oral folate is currently the most common treatment for hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), which seriously threatens human health, but its efficacy is unsatisfactory. Betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) is a key enzyme that regulates Hcy metabolism. We investigated the association between the BHMT rs3733890 and the efficacy of oral folate therapy for HHcy in the Chinese Han population and analysed the effects of gene-environmental interactions on the efficacy. Blood samples were collected from 1071 eligible patients at baseline, and these individuals received subsequent folate treatment for 90 days. A total of 638 patients included in the final analysis were grouped into the treatment success group or the treatment failure group based on posttreatment Hcy levels. Hcy concentrations were measured by fluorescence polarization immunoassay. Time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MassArray system) was used to assess the genotype of BHMT rs3733890. Stratified analyses based on additive models and generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction were used to explore gene-environmental interactions. The genotype distribution presented distinct differences in the two groups. The mutant genotype and allele had significantly increased risk of treatment failure (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Furthermore, synergistic effects of the BHMT rs3733890 polymorphism with environmental risk factors (smoking, drinking, past history) on the efficacy of therapy were also found. However, future, large well-designed studies, as well as mechanistic studies, are still needed to validate our findings.",

        "abstract": "Nitrogen addition has been shown to affect plant litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems. The way that nitrogen deposition impacts the relationship between plant litter decomposition and altered soil nitrogen availability is unclear, however. This study examined 18 co-occurring litter types in a subtropical forest in China in terms of their decomposition (1 yr of exposure in the field) with nitrogen addition treatment (0, 0.4, 1.6, and 4.0\u00a0mol\u00b7N\u00b7m \u00b7yr ) and\u00a0soil fauna exclusion (litter bags with 0.1 and 2\u00a0cm mesh size). Results showed that the plant litter decomposition rate is significantly reduced because of nitrogen addition; the strength of the nitrogen addition effect is closely related to the nitrogen addition levels. Plant litters with diverse quality responded to nitrogen addition differently. When soil fauna was present, the nitrogen addition effect on medium-quality or high-quality plant litter decomposition rate was -26%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% and -29%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04%, respectively; these values are significantly higher than that of low-quality plant litter decomposition. The pattern is similar when soil fauna is absent. In general, the plant litter decomposition rate is decreased by soil fauna exclusion; an average inhibition of -17%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5% was exhibited across nitrogen addition treatment and litter quality groups. However, this effect is weakly related to nitrogen addition treatment and plant litter quality. We\u00a0conclude that the variations in plant litter quality, nitrogen deposition, and soil fauna are important factors of decomposition and nutrient cycling in a subtropical forest ecosystem.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Forest ecosystems act as a carbon sink and contribute to climate change mitigation. Research on the spatiotemporal patterns of C storage and density in forest ecosystems is essential to understand the role of forest ecosystems in the C sink and is helpful to select the efficient forest management practice to maximize the C sequestration potential. We quantified the C storage in forest ecosystems in Hunan Province in southern China over two decades by combining forest inventory data with field survey. The C storage in forest ecosystems in Hunan Province increased from 820.2 Tg to 1277.8 Tg over the two decades, with 457.6 Tg (134.4 Tg in vegetation and 323.2 Tg in soil) of C sequestration in the forest ecosystems. Forest C storage increased sharply from 1996 to 2007, but slowly from 2007 to 2015. The mean annual C sequestration was 25.8 Tg yr \u22121 , with 19.0 Tg yr \u22121  in soil and 6.8 Tg yr \u22121  in vegetation. The C density in forest ecosystems increased from 110.3\u202fMg\u202fha \u22121  in 1996 to 130.8\u202fMg\u202fha \u22121  in 2013. C densities varied in forest types, with the highest value in evergreen broadleaved forest ecosystems. The uneven spatial distributions of forest C storage, density, and sequestration in Hunan Province exhibited similar pattern with the highest in the western Hunan and the lowest in the central Hunan. The forest ecosystems in Hunan Province present a significant C sequestration potential (1321.5 Tg, including 1029.2 Tg in biomass C and 292.3 Tg in soil C), given the proportion of the area of young and middle-aged forests (71.3%). To maximize the C sequestration potential of forest ecosystems in Hunan Province, future forest management should focus on the conversion of forest type, the selection of tree species in reforestation, and the prevention of adverse human disturbances in young and middle-aged forests.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The effect of carbohydrate supply on stem CO 2  efflux and its temperature sensitivity is crucial in predicting forest carbon cycling under climate change and forest management but has been rarely reported. In this study, we altered carbohydrate supply via stem girdling and investigated the effect of nonstructural carbohydrate concentration on stem CO 2  efflux and its temperature sensitivity in Chinese fir and sweetgum trees in spring and winter. The stem CO 2  efflux of Chinese fir increased significantly above the girdle in spring and winter, but decreased below the girdle in winter. The stem CO 2  efflux of sweetgum increased above the girdle and decreased below the girdle in spring but not in winter. Seasonal variations in the response of stem CO 2  efflux to girdling were associated with the changes in stem soluble sugar and starch concentration, especially in sweetgum tree. Girdling altered  Q  10  of the stem CO 2  efflux, and this effect was dependent on location, season and species. Compared with the  Q  10  of the stem CO 2  efflux in non-girdled trees, that of CO 2  efflux in Chinese fir increased by 45% above the girdle but decreased by 16% below the girdle in winter. These values also exhibited 6% and 11% responses in spring. By contrast, the  Q  10  of the stem CO 2  efflux in sweetgum increased by 95% above the girdle and decreased by 45% below the girdle in spring. However, these values were nearly constant in winter. We concluded that the effect of carbohydrate supply on stem CO 2  efflux and its temperature sensitivity depends on season and species. Therefore, the vital role of carbohydrate supply that regulates stem CO 2  efflux and its temperature sensitivity should be considered for the understanding and modeling of forest carbon cycling response to forest management, especially under global climate changes.",

        "abstract": "Evidence showed that the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) injection resulted in dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis implicated in major depressive disorder. Magnolol, main constituent identified in the barks of Magnolia officinalis, exerted antidepressant effects in a rat model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress in previous studies. However, its antidepressant-like effects and mechanisms have never been studied in depression model induced by CORT administration in rodents. This study aimed to investigate the antidepressant-like effects and possible mechanisms of magnolol in CORT-treated mice by utilizing a combination of behavioral and biochemical analysis. The depressive model was developed by subcutaneous injection of CORT for 21 days at a dose of 20 mg/kg. CORT administration formed depressive-like behaviors in mice, as indicated by increased immobility time in the forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), as well as decreased sucrose intake in sucrose preference test (SPT). Moreover, we also found that CORT levels in serum were significantly increased, along with the decrease of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA, BDNF protein, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) levels in the hippocampus. Treatment with magnolol alleviated depressive-like behaviors, reduced the levels of CORT, and improved the levels of BDNF protein, 5-HT, and NE compared with those in CORT-treated mice. These findings indicated that magnolol possessed antidepressant effects in mice exposed to CORT, which is might be partially related to modulate HPA axis, up-regulate BDNF expression and increase neurotransmitters levels in the hippocampus.",

        "abstract": "A high selective and efficient LC-MS/MS method was developed to determine the plasma concentration of magnolol, hesperidin, neohesperidin and geniposide following oral administration of Zhi-Zi-Hou-Po decoction in normal and depressed rats. Plasma samples were pretreated by protein precipitation with methanol. Chromatographic separation was performed on an XTerra\u00ae MS C column using a gradient elution with a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile-0.1% aqueous formic acid. The proposed method was validated to be specific, accurate and precise for the analytes determination in plasma samples. The calibration curves displayed good linearity over definite concentration ranges for the analytes. The intra- and inter-day precision of the proposed method at three different levels were all within <11.13% and the relative errors ranged from -8.46 to 8.93%. The recovery of the four compounds ranged from 82.72 to 89.08% and no apparent matrix effect was observed during sample analysis. After full validation, the established method was successfully applied for comparing the pharmacokinetics of four components between normal and depressed rats. The results showed that the AUC and C of four analytes in depressed rats were significantly different from those in normal rats and might provide helpful information to guide the clinical use of ZZHPD to treat depression.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThis paper designs the event-triggered non-fragile state estimator for a class of time-delayed complex networks with randomly occurring sensor saturations (ROSSs) and estimator gain variations on the basis of measurements from partial nodes. Both the time-varying state delays and the stochastic disturbances are considered in the network model. A Bernoulli-distributed white sequence is utilized to reflect the phenomenon of ROSSs. Two sequences of Gaussian distributed random variables combined with the multiplicative norm-bounded uncertainties are used to characterize the randomly occurring gain variations in the estimators. An event generator function is employed to regulate the transmission of data from the sensor to the estimator. The aim of this paper is to design an exponentially ultimately bounded state estimator in mean square through measurement outputs from a partial of network nodes under the event-triggered mechanism. With the help of Lyapunov\u2013Krasovskii functional and stochastic analysis...",

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the state estimation problem for a class of Markovian jumping neural networks (MJNNs) with sensor nonlinearities, mode-dependent time delays and stochastic disturbances subject to the Round-Robin (RR) scheduling mechanism. The system parameters experience switches among finite modes according to a Markov chain. As an equal allocation scheme, the RR communication protocol is introduced for efficient usage of limited bandwidth and energy saving. The update matrix method is adopted to deal with the periodic time-delays resulting from the RR protocol. The objective of the addressed problem is to construct a state estimator for the MJNNs such that the dynamics of the estimation error is exponentially ultimately bounded in the mean square with a certain upper bound. Sufficient conditions are established for the existence of the desired state estimator by resorting to a combination of the Lyapunov stability theory and the stochastic analysis technique. Furthermore, the estimator gain matrices are characterized in terms of the solution to a convex optimization problem. Finally, a numerical simulation example is exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator design strategy.",

To deal with the variant and unpredictable wireless signals, the positioning is casted in a four-layer Deep Neural Network (DNN) structure pre-trained by Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA) that is capable of learning reliable features from a large set of noisy samples and avoids hand-engineering. Also, to maintain the temporal coherence, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based fine localizer is introduced to smooth the initial positioning estimate obtained by the DNN-based coarse localizer. The data required for the experiments is collected from the real world in different periods to meet the actual environment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system leads to substantial improvement on localization accuracy in coping with the turbulent wireless signals.",

        "abstract": "In progressive stamping processes, condition monitoring based on tonnage signals is of great practical significance. One typical fault in progressive stamping processes is a missing part in one of the die stations due to malfunction of part transfer in the press. One challenging question is how to detect the fault due to the missing part in certain die stations as such a fault often results in die or press damage, but only provides a small change in the tonnage signals. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel automatic process monitoring method using the recurrence plot (RP) method. Along with the developed method, we also provide a detailed interpretation of the representative patterns in the recurrence plot. Then, the corresponding relationship between the RPs and the tonnage signals under different process conditions is fully investigated. To differentiate the tonnage signals under normal and faulty conditions, we adopt the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) to characterize the critical patterns in the RPs. A parameter learning algorithm is developed to set up the appropriate parameter of the RP method for progressive stamping processes. A real case study is provided to validate our approach, and the results are compared with the existing literature to demonstrate the outperformance of this proposed monitoring method.",

        "abstract": "Hot carrier aging (HCA) has attracted a lot of attentions recently, as it can be a lifetime limiting mechanism for both I/O and core devices. The applicability of the conventional characterization method developed for large devices to nano-scale devices is questionable, as nano-scale devices suffers from within-a-device-fluctuation (WDF). This work shows that the inclusion of WDF measured by the commercial quasi-DC SMU gives erroneous results. A method is proposed to separate the WDF from the real HCA for reliable parameter extraction of the HCA model. The lifetime and use voltage become yield dependent and the impact of statistical variations on SRAM is assessed.",

For the first time, the proposed design breaks the inherent speed limitation and generates true random numbers up to 3Mbps with ultra-low power. This is over 10 times faster than the state-of-the-art RTN-TRNG [6]. Moreover, the new design does not require selection of devices and thus avoids the use of large transistor array and laborious post-selection process. This reduces the circuit area and the cost. The proposed TRNG has been successfully validated on three different processes and they all passed the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) tests, making it a suitable candidate for future cryptographically secured applications in the internet of things (IoT).",

Three types of electron traps are identified: As-grown cyclic electron traps (ACET), generated cyclic electron traps (GCET), and generated anti-neutralization electron traps (ANET).

Considering the complexity of metabolism, metabolites and their represented cellular processes can correlate and synergistically contribute to a phenotypic status. Genetic programming (GP) provides advanced analytical instruments for the investigation of multifactorial causes of metabolic diseases. In this article, we analyzed a population-based metabolomics dataset on osteoarthritis (OA) and developed a Linear GP (LGP) algorithm to search classification models that can best predict the disease outcome, as well as to identify the most important metabolic markers associated with the disease. The LGP algorithm was able to evolve prediction models with high accuracies especially with a more focused search using a reduced feature set that only includes potentially relevant metabolites. We also identified a set of key metabolic markers that may improve our understanding of the biochemistry and pathogenesis of the disease.",

This promises an immense potential for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of complex diseases. Most conventional metabolomics analysis methods exam one metabolite at a time and may overlook the synergistic effect of combining multiple metabolites. In this article, we proposed a new bioinformatics framework that infers the non-linear synergy among multiple metabolites using a symbolic model and subsequently, identify key metabolites using network analysis. Such a symbolic model is able to represent a complex non-linear relationship among a set of metabolites associated with osteoarthritis (OA) and is automatically learned using an evolutionary algorithm. Applied to the Newfoundland Osteoarthritis Study (NFOAS) dataset, our methodology was able to identify nine key metabolites including some known osteoarthritis-associated metabolites and some novel metabolic markers that have never been reported before. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology and more importantly, with further investigations, propose new hypotheses that can help better understand the OA disease.",

        "abstract": "Multiple factors can help predict knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients from healthy individuals, including age, sex, and BMI, and possibly metabolite levels. Using plasma from individuals with primary OA undergoing total knee replacement and healthy volunteers, we measured lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) analogues by metabolomics. Populations were stratified on demographic factors and lysoPC and PC analogue signatures were determined by univariate receiver-operator curve (AUC) analysis. Using signatures, multivariate classification modeling was performed using various algorithms to select the most consistent method as measured by AUC differences between resampled training and test sets. Lists of metabolites indicative of OA [AUC > 0.5] were identified for each stratum. The signature from males age > 50 years old encompassed the majority of identified metabolites, suggesting lysoPCs and PCs are dominant indicators of OA in older males. Principal component regression with logistic regression was the most consistent multivariate classification algorithm tested. Using this algorithm, classification of older males had fair power to classify OA patients from healthy individuals. Thus, individual levels of lysoPC and PC analogues may be indicative of individuals with OA in older populations, particularly males. Our metabolite signature modeling method is likely to increase classification power in validation cohorts.",

This study was designed to investigate the effect of sex on properties of a complex interlinked network constructed of central biochemical metabolites. The study involved the blood collection and analysis of a large set of blood metabolic markers from a total of 236 healthy participants, which included 140 females and 96 males. Metabolic profiling yielded concentrations of 168 metabolites for each subject. A differential correlation network analysis approach was developed for this study that allowed detection and characterization of interconnection differences in metabolites in males and females. Through topological analysis of the differential network that depicted metabolite differences in the sexes, we identified metabolites with high centralities in this network. These key metabolites were identified as 10 phosphatidylcholines (PCaaC34:4, PCaaC36:6, PCaaC34:3, PCaaC42:2, PCaeC38:1, PCaeC38:2, PCaaC40:1, PCaeC34:1, PC aa C32:1 and PC aa C40:6) and 4 acylcarnitines (C3-OH, C7-DC, C3 and C0). Identification of these metabolites may help further studies of sex-specific differences in the metabolome that may underlie different responses to stress and disease in males and females.",

        "abstract": "Background  Accumulating evidence suggests an independent association between osteoarthritis (OA) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Our recent work [Zhang,  et al.  Metabolomics, 2015] found phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl C34:3 (PC ae C34:3) and phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl C36:3 (PC ae C36:3) were associated with both OA and DM. Both synovial and plasma concentrations of these two metabolites were reduced in knee OA and DM patients, and OA patients with DM had lowest concentration of these two metabolites, suggesting the altered unsaturated phosphatidylcholine metabolism may be responsible for the association between OA and DM.  Objectives  We hypothesized hyperglycemia-related production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) was involved in the altered phosphatidylcholine metabolism in OA patients and tested this hypothesis in the current study.  Methods  Synovial fluid and plasma samples were collected from OA patients with and without DM. Hyperglycemia-related AGEs including methylglyoxal (MG) and methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone (MG-H1) levels were measured in both synovial fluid and plasma samples using UPLC/MS method. The correlation between MG, MG-H1, and PC ae C34:3 and PC ae C36:3 were examined.  Results  84 knee OA patients, including 46 with DM and 38 without DM, were included in the study. We did not find a significant difference in plasma MG-H1 concentration between OA with and without DM. However, we found that log transformed synovial concentrations of MG-H1 in the groups of OA with diabetes were 2.56\u00b10.27 ng/ml which was significantly higher than that in the group of OA without diabetes (2.39 \u00b10.25 ng/ml, P=0.012). Similarly, synovial concentration of MG was 2.05\u00b10.11 ng/ml in the group of OA with diabetes which was significantly higher than 1.99\u00b10.11 ng/ml in the group of OA without diabetes (P=0.046). The significance remained after adjusting the age, BMI and sex. The correlation between MG-H1 and PC ae C34:3, MG-H1 and PC ae C36:3, MG and PC aeC34:3, and MG and PC ae C36:3 were -0.15, -0.32, -0.23 and -0.06, respectively.  Conclusions  We demonstrated that both MG-H1 and MG concentrations in synovial fluid were elevated in OA patients with DM and associated with the levels of PC ae C34:3 and PC ae C36:3, suggesting that hyperglycemia-related AGEs may be responsible for the altered phosphotidylcholine metabolism in OA.

        "abstract": "Background  Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is a heterogeneous disease with variable clinical outcomes. Some patients do not have any symptoms or significant functional loss for many years after the onset of the disease whereas others can progress rapidly to advanced stage [1], making it highly clinical relevant to identify those who are at high risk of progressing rapidly so that targeted interventions at early stage of the disease can be implemented [2\u20134].  Objectives  To identify novel biomarker(s) for predicting advanced knee OA.  Methods  Study participants were derived from the NFOAS and the TASOAC studies. All knee OA cases were patients who underwent total knee replacement (TKR) due to primary OA. Metabolic profiling was performed on fasting plasma using a targeted metabolomics approach. 4,018 plasma metabolite ratios that were highly correlated with that in synovial fluid in our previous study [5] were generated as surrogates for joint metabolism.  Results  The discovery cohort included 64 TKR cases and 45 controls and the replication cohorts included a cross-sectional cohort of 72 TKR cases and 76 controls and a longitudinal cohort of 158 subjects, of whom 36 underwent TKR during the 10-year follow-up period. We confirmed the previous reported association of the branched chain amino acids to histidine ratio with advanced knee OA (p=9.3\u00d710 \u20137 ) and identified a novel metabolic marker - lysoPCs to PCs ratio - that was associated with advanced knee OA (p=1.5\u00d710 \u20137 ) after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI. When the subjects of the longitudinal cohort were categorized into two groups based on the optimal cutoff of 0.09 of the ratio, we found the subjects with the ratio \u22650.09 were 2.3 times more likely to undergo TKR than those with the ratio   Conclusions  We identified the ratio of lysoPCs to PCs as a novel metabolic marker for predicting advanced knee OA. Further studies are required to examine whether this ratio can predict early OA change.  References  Blanco FJ, Moller I, Romera M, et al.

        "abstract": "This study was to investigate how OA patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) are different metabolically from OA patients without MetS components and healthy individuals.\n A two-stage case\u2013control study design was utilized. Synovial fluid (SF) and plasma samples were collected from patients undergoing total knee joint replacement due to primary OA and healthy controls (only plasma) and metabolically profiled using UPLC-MS coupled with assay kit which measures 186 metabolites. Orthogonal projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis and linear regression were used to identify metabolic markers for discriminating OA patients with MetS components from those without and healthy individuals. 54 paired SF and plasma samples from knee OA patients and 30 plasma samples from healthy controls were included in the discovery stage, and 143 plasma samples (72 from knee OA patients and 71 from the age, sex, and BMI matched controls) were included in the validation stage. OA patients with MetS can be clearly discriminated from OA patients without MetS based on the metabolite profiles of both SF and plasma and the separation appeared to be driven by type 2 diabetes but not obesity, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. When compared with OA patients with diabetes, OA without diabetes, and healthy controls, phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl C34:3 (PC ae C34:3) and phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl C36:3 (PC ae C36:3) were identified and confirmed to be associated with the concurrence of OA and diabetes (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.003). The study demonstrated that altered phosphatidylcholine metabolism was associated with both OA and diabetes mellitus.",

Plasma samples were collected from knee OA patients and healthy controls after 8-hour fasting and metabolically profiled using a targeted metabolomics assay kit. Linear regression was used to identify novel metabolic markers for OA. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to examine diagnostic values. Gene expression analysis was performed on human cartilage to explore the potential mechanism for the novel OA marker(s).64 knee OA patients and 45 controls were included in the discovery stage and 72 knee OA patients and 76 age and sex matched controls were included in the validation stage. We identified and confirmed six metabolites that were significantly associated with knee OA, of which arginine was the most significant metabolite (p < 3.5\u00d710(-13)) with knee OA patients having on average 69 \u03bcM lower than that in controls. ROC analysis showed that arginine had the greatest diagnostic value with AUC of 0.984. The optimal cutoff of arginine concentration was 57 \u03bcM with 98.3% sensitivity and 89% specificity. The depletion of arginine in OA patients was most likely due to the over activity of arginine to ornithine pathway, leading to imbalance between cartilage repair and degradation.Arginine is significantly depleted in refractory knee OA patients. Further studies within a longitudinal setting are required to examine whether arginine can predict early OA changes.",

In this study, an etching method was used to synthesize nanosized iron oxide with small primary particle sizes of approximately 4 nm and a high specific surface area of 317 m2 g\u22121. The material was used as an adsorbent for arsenic removal from water. The sorption isotherms fit the Langmuir equation, and the derived maximum sorption capability for As(III) and As(V) is 42 mg g\u22121 at pH 7 and 83 mg g\u22121 at pH 3, respectively. Arsenic adsorption obeys pseudo-second-order kinetics. The adsorption sites were located mostly on the external nanoparticle surface, and therefore intraparticle diffusion resistance was avoided and external diffusion was the rate-limiting step. The mechanism of arsenic removal on nanosized iron oxide is chemisorption via inner-sphere surface complexation, and the hydroxyl groups of arsenic species are important for reaction with adsorbent surface hydroxyl groups. Adsorption of As(III) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ion was also studied, and the catalytic oxidation of As(III) significantly promoted its adsorptive removal.",

They could be stacked to form honeycomb-like structures with tubular channels, which were then used as alternative adsorbent beds for large-flow-rate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The activation agents phosphoric acid, zinc chloride, steam, and carbon dioxide were used to prepare the MAC samples. The MAC samples were characterized by N2 adsorption measurements at \u2212196 \u00b0C, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. The samples had microcellular structures that resemble the cellular tissue of the precursor bamboo. In comparison with commercial honeycomb activated carbon (HAC) prepared by extruding powder carbon and additives, the MAC samples had superior mechanical strength, were much more stable under wet conditions, and had much higher carbon content. The dynamic toluene adsorption on MAC and HAC was also studied. Well-developed micropores in MAC seemed to have a crucial role in toluene adsorption. Under the experimental conditions, the optimized MAC samples had high dynamic toluene adsorption capacity (up to 350 mg/g). The results suggest that MAC materials have potential use as adsorbents in the control of VOCs emission.",

The catalytic process involved directly passing electric currents through the alloy substrates to generate Joule heat, leading to a temperature increase in the supported catalysts and hydrocarbon ignition. The effects of alloy pretreatment and alumina washcoating on the Joule-heat-ignited catalytic performance were studied. The electroplated palladium catalyst supported on a calcined substrate exhibited better performance than that supported on either an anodized substrate or an untreated one, which can be attributed to the oxygen species generated in the interface between the palladium particles and the protruding oxide particles on the calcined substrate. Washcoating of the anodized substrate with alumina prior to electroplating with palladium improved the catalytic activity, which could also be due to the presence of palladium\u2013alumina interfaces.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nanosized Co 3 O 4  catalyst was prepared through a dispersion\u2013precipitation method involving a reaction between wet cobalt hydroxide and acetic acid, which forms a colloidal dispersion, and subsequent dilution, which destabilizes and precipitates the colloidal particles. The catalyst had a particle size of 5\u201315\u00a0nm and a specific surface area of 82\u00a0m 2 /g. Compared with the analogue prepared by conventional alkali-induced precipitation method, the nanosized catalyst was more reducible and contained a larger amount of active surface oxygen species, as revealed by experiments using temperature-programmed reduction in hydrogen and temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen. The oxygen species could contribute to the observed higher activity in the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide and propane. In addition, a kinetics study revealed that the apparent activation energies for carbon monoxide and propane oxidation over the catalyst were 34.0 and 49.5\u00a0kJ/mol, respectively, much lower than those over the analogue (54.7 and 71.1\u00a0kJ/mol, respectively). Furthermore, a long-term test (76\u00a0h) showed that the nanosized catalyst is highly stable.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Sulfite activation by metal is a promising SO 4   \u2212 -based advanced oxidation process (SR-AOPs) for pollutant removal. Homogeneous systems are limited by strict working pH and metallic oxide sludge generation. To overcome these drawbacks, a copper\u2013silica composite modified by ammonia (CuNSi) was synthesized through a complexation\u2013adsorption\u2013combustion method and characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, transmission electronic microscopy etc. CuNSi demonstrates a stable and remarkable catalytic activation of sulfite for As(III) oxidation after five reuses in neutral wastewater. The negligible oxidation of As(III) under anoxic condition confirmed the importance of oxygen for the CuNSi/sulfite system. Bicarbonate significantly inhibited As(III) oxidation, whereas Cl \u2212  and NO 3  \u2212  slight restrained As(III) oxidation. The dosage of sulfite and As(III) affected initial rates of As(III) oxidation via the equation  r  0 \u202f=\u202f k  r \u202f\u00d7\u202f[Sulfite] 2.11 \u202f\u00d7\u202f[As(III)] 0.33  ( k  r \u202f=\u202f(3.68\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.46)\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 3 \u202fM \u22121.44 \u202fmin \u22121 ). The apparent activation energy for As(III) oxidation was 60.14\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.17\u202fkJ\u202fmol \u22121 . The SO 4   \u2212  was confirmed as the primary oxidative species, and the sulfite activation by CuNSi was through a Cu(II)\u2013Cu(I)\u2013Cu(II) cycle. Overall, this study suggests that the CuNSi/sulfite system can be a promising AOP for further application in wastewater treatment.",

This paper presents a novel hybrid approach that detects bearing faults and monitors the operating status of rolling element bearings in modern rotating machineries. Based on redundant second-generation wavelet packet transform and local characteristic-scale decomposition, this method is implemented to extract the fault features, the vibration signal is adaptively decomposed into a number of desired intrinsic scale components by two-step screening processes based on the energy ratio, and reduce random noises and eliminate the pseudofrequency components. The fault features are then used to implement the identification classification of faults using singular value decomposition and extreme learning machine. The approach is evaluated by simulation and practical bearing vibration signals under different conditions.

However, due to the vibration signal with the character of nonstationarity and nonlinearity, the detection, extraction and classification of the fault feature turn into a challenging task. This paper presents a novel method based on redundant second generation wavelet packet transform (RSGWPT), ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and optimized least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings. Firstly, this method implements an analysis combining RSGWPT-EEMD to extract the crucial characteristics from the measured signal to identify the running state of rolling element bearings, the vibration signal is adaptively decomposed into a number of modified intrinsic mode functions (modified IMFs) by two step screening processes based on the energy ratio; secondly, the matrix is formed by different level modified IMFs and singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to decompose the matrix to obtain singular value as eigenvector; finally, singular values are input to LSSVM optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) in the feature space to specify the fault type. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-fault diagnosis technique is demonstrated by applying it to both simulated signals and practical bearing vibration signals under different conditions. The results show that the proposed method is effective for the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings.",

A glucose-directed, surfactant-free and one-step direct chemical co-reduction method for synthesis of Pt-Cu alloy nanowires (NWs) under room temperature was demonstrated in present paper. The Pt-Cu NWs were obtained through the co-reduced of CuCl 2  and H 2 PtCl 6  by sodium borohydride in the presence of glucose, the glucose in which not only acted as one-dimensional (1D) growth-directing agent, also as the stabilizing agent. The average diameter of NWs was about 3.1\u00a0nm and NWs showed typical face-centered-cubic (fcc) alloy crystal structure. The influence of Pt/Cu ions ratios in precursor solution on the bimetallic composition of NWs had been studied, and NWs displayed the feature of composition-tuning. The electro-catalytic activity of Pt-Cu alloy NWs for ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) in alkaline medium was strongly related on their compositions. The Pt 31 Cu 69  NWs exhibited about 1.8 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C and higher durability. The enhanced catalytic performance of Pt-Cu alloy NWs was mainly attributed to their unique 3D network structure and the synergetic effects between Pt and Cu.",

        "abstract": "The polymer flooding process has already been applied to the medium permeability type II reservoirs of the Daqing Oilfield (China) to enhance oil recovery. However, this process faces a number of challenges, such as the flooding efficiency, high injection pressure, formation blockage and damage, unbalanced absorption ratio, and economical justification. In this study, single-phase and two-phase flow experiments are performed to investigate polymer injection adaptability with natural cores of type II reservoirs. The enhanced oil recovery (EOR) effects of the polymer are studied by physical simulation experiments, and the results of application in an actual field are also presented. The results indicate that the flow characteristics and injection capability are dominated by the reservoir permeability in polymer flooding. Moreover, the adsorption of polymer molecules and the injection pressure gradient, which reflect formation damage, are affected more significantly by the concentration than by the molecular weight in type II reservoirs. Using the matching relationship, the injection-production process is stable, and additional oil recoveries of 10%\u201315% can be obtained in heterogeneous type II reservoirs with a high water saturation. This work is significant in that it further accelerates the application of polymer flooding EOR in medium permeability heterogeneous oilfields with high water saturation.",

        "abstract": "Polymer flooding plays an important role in enhanced oil recovery (EOR), particularly in China, where partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) and hydrophobically associating water-soluble polymers (HAWP) are used in onshore and offshore reservoirs, respectively. Many researchers have highlighted the elasticity of HPAM, which can be used to improve the sweep efficiency, i.e., the ratio of the area swept by an injected fluid to the oil area. On the other hand, fewer studies exist on the elasticity of HAWP. In this study, we investigate the flow of HAWP and Xanthan solutions with identical viscosities in core experiments in terms of elasticity; results reveal that the HAWP can produce shear thickening in the core. The constitutive equation for the HAWP can be obtained using the simulation results matched with the experimental data. On the basis of these experiments, we established a two-phase flow model of a polymer and oil, including the continuity, momentum, constitutive, and phase equations. The volume-of-fluid (VOF) method was used to track the interface between the two phases. A complex pore model was established based on the glass-etched model used in the experiment. We used the OpenFOAM platform to solve the mathematical model. The saturation, pressure, and stress tensor distributions were obtained. The results show that the displacement efficiency increased as the elasticity of the polymer increased; accordingly, the elasticity can enlarge the sweep area and decrease the residual oil saturation. As the elasticity increases, the stresses (the first normal stress, second normal stress, and shear stress) increase. Finally, the results obtained in this study can be used as a guideline in polymer design, screening, and optimization in the polymer flooding oilfields.",

        "abstract": "Oil recovery, including conventional and viscous oil, can be improved significantly by flooding with polymer solutions. This chemical flooding method can increase oil production, and it can improve the macrodisplacement efficiency and microsweep efficiencies. In this study, we establish physical models that include the dead-end and complex models based on the pore-network pattern etched into glass, using the snappyHexMesh solver in OpenFOAM. These models capture the complexity and topology of porous media geometry. We establish a mathematical model for transient flows of viscoelastic polymers using computational fluid dynamics simulations, and we study the distributions of pressure and velocity for different elasticity scenarios and different flooding process. The results demonstrate that the pressure difference increases as the relaxation time decreases, before the flow reaches its steady state. For a steady flow, elasticity can give rise to an additional pressure difference, which increases with increasing elasticity. Thus, the characteristics of pressure difference vary before and after the flow becomes steady; this phenomenon is very important. Velocity contours become more widely spaced with elasticity increase. This suggests that elasticity of the polymer solutions contributes to the microsweep efficiency. The results of the study provide the necessary theoretical foundation for laboratory experiments and development of methods for polymer flooding and can be helpful for the design and selection of polymers for polymer flooding.",

        "abstract": "Polymer flooding plays an important role in chemical enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods, and has been widely used in oilfields, particularly Daqing, the largest oilfield in China. However, our understanding of the mechanism of polymer flooding is not very clear. The mechanism of a two-phase micro-flow remains a challenge to researchers, because the structural complexity of a porous medium and the rheological property of a non-Newtonian fluid can increase the difficulty in such research. Computational fluid dynamics provides a numerical simulation method for further investigating the mechanism of polymer flooding at the micro-scale. In this study, OpenFOAM was used to study the two-phase micro-flow of both water and polymer flooding. Based on a micro-physical model of a complex pore structure, the continuity equation, momentum equation, and non-Newtonian fluid constitutive equations of a two-phase flow are established, and the phase equation of the two-phase interface is then developed using the volume of fluid methodology. These equations are solved using the InterFoam solver in OpenFOAM. The saturation, pressure, and velocity distribution characteristics of water and polymer flooding were obtained. The results show that the high viscosity of a polymer solution improves the mobility ratio, inhibits the fingering phenomena, increases the displacement area, and improves the displacement efficiency. The breakthrough time of polymer flooding under a Newtonian rheological property occurs 0.3 s later than that of water flooding, and the displacement pressure drop is higher. When the flow reaches a steady state, the displacement pressure drop of polymer flooding under a Newtonian rheological property is five times that of water flooding, and the displacement efficiency increases by 8\u201320%. In non-Newtonian fluids with a shear thinning characteristic, where the viscosity of the polymer solution is reduced as compared with polymer flooding under a Newtonian rheological property, polymer flooding under a non-Newtonian rheological property occurs 0.1 s earlier, the displacement pressure drop is reduced by 300 Pa, and the displacement efficiency decreases 4%. These research results will provide a theoretical foundation for a micro-flow mechanism of a two-phase flow in a complex pore structure.",
