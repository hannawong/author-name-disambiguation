        "abstract": "Nanofabrication based on biological templates has attracted considerable interests because of its applications in materials science and biomedicine. We report a facile method for the synthesis of well-defined TiO₂ nanofibers using a simple N-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-protected phenylalanine-phenylalanine-aspartic acid tripeptide (Fmoc-Phe-Phe-Asp-OH, Fmoc-FFD) as the template. Compared with other synthetic methods of inorganic nanomaterials, self-assembling peptide could control the structure and the catalytic activity of the synthesized nanomaterials in the mild synthetic conditions. The as-synthesized peptide-TiO₂ hybrid nanofibers and the calcined TiO₂ nanofibers were characterized using the transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that well-defined TiO₂ nanofibers could form when the pH of the peptide solution was 5-7, while nanoparticles formed when the pH was 8. Moreover, the peptide-templated TiO₂ nanofibers showed improved photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methyl orange (MO). And the photocatalytic activity of the TiO₂ could be controlled by adjusting the pH of the peptide solution during the synthetic process.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning has been broadly applied in different applications due to its satisfying performance. In security-related applications, e.g. facial recognition and fingerprint identification, an adversary misleads the pattern recognition system on purpose by manipulating training or test samples. Black-box attack is one of adversarial attacks which camouflages unseen samples to evade the detection with limited information on the system. Recently, there are a few studies on the robustness of machine learning, especially deep learning, under black-box attack. In this study, we investigate the security of the stacked autoencoder, which is one of the most famous models in deep learning against black-box attack. A training dataset generation method is proposed for a substitute model in black-box attack. By enquiring labels of samples from the target classifier, we train a model to approximate the target classifier. To have a better approximation to the decision boundary of the target classifier, a hybrid data generation method is adopted to increase the number of the training data. We generate new samples by combining both near and far away the decision boundary of the substitute model. The experiment results suggest that our proposed method downgrades the classifier in terms of accuracy more significantly than the existing one within less label query times. It shows the proposed method is more efficient to train a substitute model to approximate target classifier.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nanoscale zero-valent iron has been widely applied in environmental remediation and toxic waste treatment, especially for the degradation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). However, the dechlorination activity of Fe nanoparticles (Fe NPs) can be suppressed by the precipitation of iron oxides generated from the corrosion of Fe-Pd NPs under alkaline conditions, leading to a decreased dechlorination efficiency. Faced with this challenge, we report a highly effective dechlorination system that functions over a broad pH range and especially well under alkaline conditions in this work. Procyanidin (PROC), a natural polyphenol, was utilized as a stabilizer to manipulate the size distribution of Fe-Pd NPs and, more importantly, as a scavenger of Fe ions to prevent iron oxide precipitation. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the generated Fe ions was mainly present in the form of bis- and tris-PROC-Fe complexes in the reaction solution. Compared with pristine Fe-Pd NPs, the PROC-modified Fe-Pd NPs had a dechlorination efficiency that was increased 20-fold (pH 9.0). Notably, a normalized rate constant was enhanced by more than 2 orders of magnitude compared to the previously reported dechlorination systems. The PROC-modified Fe-Pd NPs showed excellent dechlorination efficiency over a wide pH range (2.3–13.0).",

Biodegradable bone cements characterized as the appropriate mechanical properties and good adhesion strengths were prepared using the powders mixed with solution of citric acid derivatives. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of nano-HA/CMCS-SAL compound bone cements on the attachment and proliferation of rabbit bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in vitro and to explore their biocompatibilities. METHODS: Nano-HA/CMCS-SAL powders as solid phase of bone cements were prepared by the co-precipitation method. Bone cements were prepared using the liquid phase of citric acid derivatives solution. Rabbit BMSCs were seeded on the materials following passage and amplification for further culture in vitro. Cells cultured in the plates without materials were taken as controls. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Rabbit BMSCs grew well, and were spindle-shaped and fibroblast-like at 2 days of culture in vitro. The mean number of cells in the experimental group was obviously higher than that in the control group (P<0.01). Scanning electron microscopy observation: the bone cements had a good porous structure, and Rabbit BMSCs were attached to the material surfaces with cytoplasmic extensions and lamellipodia. The cells kept on a continued proliferation in both groups, and the proliferation of cells in the experimental group was obviously increased compared with the control group at 2, 4, 6 and 8 days of culture (P<0.01). It is indicated that the nano-HA/CMCS-SAL compound bone cements have a good biocompatibility.",

        "abstract": "5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is commonly used to treat breast cancer; however, it becomes increasingly ineffective with tumor progression. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process whereby cells acquire morphologic and molecular alterations facilitating tumor metastasis and progression. Emerging evidence associates chemoresistance with acquisition of EMT in cancer. However, it is not clear whether this phenomenon is involved in acquired resistance to 5-FU. Using a previously established in vitro cell model of 5-fluorouracil-resistant MCF7 cells (MCF7/5-FU), we assessed the cellular morphology, molecular changes, migration and invasion consistent with EMT. We found that silencing of Snail by stable RNA interference reversed the EMT and greatly abolished invasion behavior of MCF7/5-FU cells. We also showed that inhibition of Snail increased the sensitivity of 5-FU-resistant cells to 5-FU. Our study provided a new insight into EMT-like phenotypic changes associated with 5-FU resistance in MCF7 cells. We believed that down-regulation of Snail could be a potential novel therapeutic approach to overcoming chemoresistance and preventing metastasis during 5-FU chemotherapy.",

In this study, palladium-doped zero-valent iron nanoparticles involving poly (γ-glutamic acid) (Fe-Pd@PGA NPs) were synthesized. The nanoparticles were small (~100 nm), uniformly distributed, and highly stable. The dechlorination performance of Fe-Pd@PGA NPs was evaluated using p-CP as a model. The results demonstrated that Fe-Pd@PGA NPs show high activity even in weakly alkaline conditions. The maximum rate constant reached 0.331 min at pH 9.0 with a Fe to p-CP ratio of 100. Additionally, the dechlorination activity of Fe-Pd@PGA NPs is more than ten times higher than that of the bare Fe-Pd NPs, demonstrating the crucial role of PGA in this system. Furthermore, we investigated the dechlorination performance in the presence of different anions. The results indicated that Fe-Pd@PGA NPs can maintain high activity in the presence of Cl, HPO, and humic acid, while HPOand HCO ions slightly reduce the dechlorination activity. We believed that PGA is a promising stabilizer and promoter for Fe-Pd NPs and the Fe-Pd@PGA NPs have the potential for practical applications.",

The properties and morphology of the manganese carbonate were measured by SEM, XRD, TGA, BET and XPS. In this method, no harsh reaction conditions were required, and it was a simple and green process for the oxidation of 5-HMF into DFF. To achieve an optimum DFF yield, different reaction conditions, including reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst amount, and solvents were investigated. Results from the experiments indicated that the highest DFF yield of 86.9% was obtained at 120 °C under atmospheric oxygen pressure after 6 h.

        "abstract": "Cisplatin is one of the major chemotherapeutic agents used against different human cancers. A better understanding of the downstream cellular targets of cisplatin will provide information on its mechanism of action. FOXO3a is a member of the FOXO transcription factor family, which modulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and other cellular processes. In this study, we have investigated the effects of cisplatin in a panel of lung cancer cell lines. The results showed that cisplatin inhibited the proliferation of these lung cancer cell lines by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway, with evidence of decreasing phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT under cisplatin treatment, and constitutively activating AKT1 could reduce cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis. More importantly, cisplatin significantly inhibited FOXO3a phosphorylation (at Thr32, AKT phosphorylation site) and induced FOXO3a nuclear accumulation, which in turn increased the expression of FOXO3a-dependent apoptotic protein Bim. Knockdown of FOXO3a expression using small interfering RNA attenuated cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, activation of FOXO3a induced cell apoptosis irrespective of p53 status, whereas p53 may act as FOXO3a downstream molecules involved in cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis. Together, our findings suggested that FOXO3a is a relevant mediator of the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin in lung cancer cells.",

In this work, the constant-volume method was used to determine the solubility of CO 2  and H 2 S in propylene carbonate (PC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), and diethyl succinate (DES) at 298.15–328.15 K and the pressures up to about 1 MPa. The quantum chemical calculations at DFT/B3LYP level of theory using 6 − 311 + G(d,p) basis sets are taken to investigate the interaction mechanism between CO 2 /H 2 S and the carbonates from a molecular point of view. The results show that the CO 2  or H 2 S absorption in these solvents is physical process and the solubility is in the same order: PC  2 S/CO 2  for these carbanates generally is in the order: DEC  2  or H 2 S dissolve in carbonates and the interaction energy is in the order: PC  2  and H 2 S in carbonates and the ideal selectivity of H 2 S/CO 2  make this kind of solvents possible to be used in large-scale industrial applications in the future.",

The coherence increases with the number of steps at the beginning and then fluctuates over time after approaching to saturation. The coherence with odd number of sites is much larger than that with even number of sites. Another initial state, i.e., the equally superposition state, is also considered. The coherence of the whole system is proved to be  () for any odd (even) time step where  is the number of sites.

In this study, two mucins, one from bovine submaxillary gland (BSM), and one from porcine stomach (PGM), as well as bovine serum albumin (BSA), served as the physical barrier against foreign substances entering tissues and the blood protein, respectively, were chosen as models for investigations of the interactions between proteins and fly ash particles. Their adsorption behaviors were studied using spectroscopy and a quartz crystal microbalance with a dissipation monitor (QCM-D). The results indicated that the fly ash particles can induce the loosening of mucins and BSA, probably via the formation of complexes. Further, the secondary structure of proteins changed in the presence of fly ash particles. The α-helix content decreased with increasing fly ash particle concentration. Addition of fly ash particles into protein solutions led to fluorescence quenching, which suggested that there were interactions between these particles and the mucins and BSA. The association constants (Ka) for BSM and BSA were 5.35 L/g and 4.18 L/g, respectively. Furthermore, the results of QCM-D analyses showed that the amount decreased on the mucin surface but increased slightly on the BSA surface, which indicated that the fly ash particles disrupted the mucin layer upon adsorption. These findings provide clear evidence of the interactions between fly ash particles and mucins and BSA, which can lead to structural changes. This study contributes to a better understanding of the interactions and adsorptions of atmospheric particulate pollutants with proteins in the human body.",

        "abstract": "Recycling cellulases by substrate adsorption is a promising strategy for reducing the enzyme cost of cellulosic ethanol production. However, β-glucosidase has no carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). Thus, additional enzymes are required in each cycle to achieve a high ethanol yield. In this study, we report a new method of recycling cellulases without β-glucosidase supplementation using lignocellulosic substrate, an engineered strain expressing β-glucosidase and Tween 80. The cellulases and Tween 80 were added to an aqueous suspension of diluted sulfuric acid/ammonia-treated corncobs in a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process for ethanol production. Subsequently, the addition of fresh pretreated corncobs to the fermentation liquor and remaining solid residue provided substrates with absorbed cellulases for the next SSF cycle. This method provided excellent ethanol production in three successive SSF cycles without requiring the addition of new cellulases. For a 10% (w/v) solid loading, a cellulase dosage of 30 filter paper units (FPU)/g cellulose, 0.5% Tween 80, and 2 g/L of the engineered strain, approximately 90% of the initial ethanol concentration from the first SSF process was obtained in the next two SSF processes, with a total ethanol production of 306.27 g/kg corncobs and an enzyme productivity of 0.044 g/FPU. Tween 80 played an important role in enhancing cellulase recovery. This new enzyme recycling method is more efficient and practical than other reported methods. Biotechnol.

METHODS Andro PVP solid dispersions which contain different proportion Tween-80 were prepared by solvent method. The composing of solid dispersion was optimized using orthogonal design. The dissolution rate in vitro was studied in artificial gastric juice. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) were used to analyze the characteristics of Andrographolide in solid dispersions. RESULTS Andro release from solid dispersions was significantly increased and its dissolution rate was raised when the higher content of Tween-80 was used. It was demonstrated that drug in Andro solid dispersion was an amorphous form by XRD and SEM.

        "abstract": "To purify the extracellular domain of HER2 in vitro and improve its prokaryotic expression abundance, the cDNA fragment encoding extracellular domain of HER2 was obtained by PCR and cloned into the expression vector pGEX-6P-1. After transforming it into Escherichia coli BL21, we instituted an investigation of different inducing conditions to try out the optimal condition for expressing soluble fusion protein. As for insoluble inclusion bodies, they were dissolved in 8 M Urea and refolded in refolding buffer. The soluble protein and the refolded protein were purified with Glutathione Sepharose 4B, respectively. The results showed that both the soluble and insoluble protein existed in Escherichia coli, but the majority was insoluble. It is beneficial to the expression of soluble fusion protein by induction at lower temperature (30 degrees C) and higher optical density (A600= 1.8) with the use of certain additive in medium. By purification of the supernatant of the lysate and refolded protein, the yield of the fusion protein was about 1.23 mg per liter culture. As a result, we have obtained the maximum soluble extracellular domain of HER2 protein, and thus have laid a foundation for further work on functional study and antibody preparation for HER2.",

An azobenzene group (Azo) was linked to the N-terminucs of glycine-phenylalanine-glycine tripeptide (GFG) to facilitate the formation of the supramolecular peptide-based matrix. Due to the proximity effect of GOx and hemin in the matrix as well as the biomimetic microenvironment of the peptide-based material, the transfer of intermediates can be enhanced and the catalytic activity of this multienzyme complex was greatly improved over free enzymes for catalyzing a cascade reaction. In addition, based on the light-responsive conformational switching of azobenzene between E and Z forms, the structure of the peptide-based matrix can be modulated, by which the catalytic activity of the multienzyme complex can be further controlled using UV and visible light.

The grafting of carboxyl group to the membrane surface was confirmed by IR spectrum and wettability analysis, and no degradation of the modified membrane skin or framework was observed with scanning electron microscopy. The experimental results of filtrating bovine serum albumin solutions indicated that the property of resisting protein adsorption on the membrane surface for the modified membrane was much better than that for unmodified membrane.

        "abstract": "We recently reported that TCRP1, a novel multidrug-resistance associated human gene, can mediate cisplatin resistance in OSCC cells. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this role of TCRP1 remained to be elucidated. In this study, by using Human Toxicology and Drug Resistance Microarray, we identified 30 genes with significantly different expression levels between Tca/PYM and TCRP1 knockdown cell lines. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and GST-pull down assays showed that metallothionein1X (MT1X) and Akt interact with TCRP1. siRNA-mediated knockdown of TCRP1 and MT1X was found to sensitize cells to cisplatin, leading to increased apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation. These functions of TCRP1 may be caused at least in part via activation of the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway. Taken together, our findings indicate that TCRP1 may be an important drug target for improvement of the treatment and survival of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. © 2012 Peng et al.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we proposed a bioinspired approach for the deposition and zwitteration of hyaluronic acid (HA) with a reduced glutathione (GSH) to form a composite layer that functions as a low fouling coating. A polyanion of the HA-dopamine conjugate (HADA) possessing catechol groups was synthesized by carbodiimide chemistry between HA and dopamine. Then, the dopamine conjugated biofunctional polymers (HADA) were grafted onto Au substrates via the transformation of catechol into a quinone group under mild oxidative conditions followed by a reaction with GSH to avoid undesired adhesion and also to shield the exposed Au substrate. Analysis of XPS spectra and wettability indicated that HADA and GSH were successfully grafted onto Au substrates. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that both HADA and further GSH modified surfaces exhibited reduced nonspecific adsorption. The attachment of GSH to HADA modified surfaces (HADA-G) resulted in better antifouling performance, with a low or ultralow protein adsorption of 0-7.51 ng cm when exposed to single protein solutions, and a reduction in nonspecific adsorption from cow's milk to 10% compared to that of bare gold. The enhanced antifouling performance of HADA-G modified surfaces was likely due to the zwitterionic structure in GSH, which can induce stronger surface hydration through electrostatic interactions as well as the hydrogen bonding induced by HADA. Our results provide a facile and universal approach to surface modification and demonstrate the benefits of using a composite layer for the design of low fouling surfaces.",

The average hydrodynamic radius (R h) of casein micelles decreased generally with increasing temperature, indicating the dissociation of casein micelles. It was a reversible dissociation for thermal treatment of casein with a lower concentration, while the heat-induced dissociation of casein with a higher concentration was irreversible. With the increase of concentration and ionic strength, the R h value of casein micelles firstly decreased then increased, and achieved the minimum at 2 g/L and 0.1 mol/L respectively. On the contrary, the R h value underwent an opposite plot with increasing pH and obtained the maximum at pH 7.0. When the proportion of ethanol in the solvent increased from 0 to 40% , the R h value of protein molecules increased gradually and the light scattering intensity (I θ) of casein solution displayed an exponential growth, which suggested the aggregation of casein micelles.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning makes great breakthroughs in a variety of applications. Its motivation is to learn feature from raw data. However, the performance of deep learning method applied to security-sensitive applications is poor. In adversarial environment, there are adversaries who attempt to evade valid classification by manipulating training and test samples. Thus, test data does not follow the same distribution of training data. Robustness of stacked autoencoder must be concerned under adversarial environment. In this paper, we investigate the attacking principle and try to improve the robustness of stacked autoencoder. A simple but effective objective function that not only minimizes empirical risks but also improves the robustness of stacked autoencoder against evasion attack is proposed. Our proposed method is based on weight evenness which presents better classification performance under evasion attack. We verify this method on the MNIST dataset. The robustness of our model is compared with conventional stacked autoencoder. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective against evasion attack and enhances the security of stacked autoencoder under adversarial environment.",

        "abstract": "SET oncoprotein is an endogenous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and SET-mediated PP2A inhibition is an important regulatory mechanism for promoting cancer initiation and progression of several types of human leukemia disease. However, its potential relevance in solid tumors as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains mostly unknown. In this study, we showed that SET was evidently overexpressed in human NSCLC cell lines and NSCLC tissues. Clinicopathologic analysis showed that SET expression was significantly correlated with clinical stage (p < 0.001), and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with high SET expression had poorer overall survival rates than those with low SET expression. Moreover, knockdown of SET in NSCLC cells resulted in attenuated proliferative and invasive abilities. The biological effect of SET on proliferation and invasion was mediated by the inhibition of the PP2A, which in turn, activation of AKT and ERK, increased the expression of cyclin D1 and MMP9, and decreased the expression of p27. Furthermore, we observed that restoration of PP2A using SET antagonist FTY720 impaired proliferative and invasive potential in vitro, as well as inhibited tumor growth in vivo of NSCLC cells. Taken together, SET oncoprotein plays an important role in NSCLC progression, which could serve as a potential prognosis marker and a novel therapeutic target for NSCLC patients.",

        "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is an oncoprotein coded by EBV genome. This study was to investigate the effects of EBV LMP1 on transformation and tumorigenesis of Rat-1 cells.Retrovirus plasmids pLNSX-LMP1 and pBabe-IkappaBalpha, constructed by gene recombination technique, were cotransfected respectively with nuclear factor-kappaB luciferase reporter (pNF-kappaB-luc) into 293 cells. The actions of LMP1 in activating NF-kappaB and IkappaBalpha in inhibiting NF-kappaB were measured by luciferase activity assay. Moreover, pLNSX-LMP1 and pBabe-IkappaBalpha were transfected respectively into the ecotropic retrovirus packaging cell line PA317 to generate LMP1 retrovirus (RV-LMP1) and IkappaBalpha retrovirus (RV-IkappaBalpha). After Rat-1 cells were infected by RV-LMP1 alone or RV-LMP1 combined RV-IkappaBalpha, their malignant transformation phenotype was detected by colony forming assay and nude mice tumorigenicity assay.When pLNSX-LMP1 and pBabe-IkappaB were cotransfected at a ratio of 1:1, IkappaBalpha inhibited LMP1-mediated NF-kappaB activation by 75%û and at a ratio of 3:1, it almost completely inhibited LMP1-mediated NF-kappaB activation. IkappaBalpha obviously inhibited LMP1-mediated malignant phenotype of Rat-1 cells:colony formation number on plates were significantly decreased from (368+/-7)/well and (287+/-17)/well to (59+/-6)/well and (8+/-2)/well (P<0.001). Foci in soft agarose were decreased from (477+/-13)/well and (347+/-10)/well to (61+/-15)/well and (95+/-7)/well (P<0.001). The ability of tumorigenicity in nude mice was markedly decreased: tumor volume was decreased from (1.61+/-0.23) cm3 to (0.20+/-0.08) cm3 (P<0.001).EBV-LMP1 could lead to transformation and tumorigenesis of Rat-1 cells by activating NF-kappaB.",

This study reports the hierarchical chiral self-assembly of a ferrocene-modified dipeptide in evaporating droplets. The capillary flows during solvent evaporation changed greatly on the self-assembly of the peptides, leading to the chiral amplification and the formation of well-defined nanohelixes. By changing the initial temperature difference (ΔT) between the droplets and the substrate, it is possible to control the fluid mechanical effects under two distinct regimes: the “coffee ring” effect caused by outward capillary flow and the Rayleigh convection by buoyancy force. This allows us to control the orientational growth of peptide nanohelixes with their axis parallel or perpendicular to the substrate. The results highlight the vital roles of capillary flow in directing the hierarchical chiral self-assembly of peptides and offer new opportunities for the fabrication of highly ordered chiral nanomaterials.",

A kind of ceramic powder containing Sn 4+  ions (Sn-CP) with good hardness was synthesized by a rapid method for the isomerization of glucose. HCl was introduced for catalysing the fructose-to-HMF reaction and promoting the isomerization reaction. Production of HMF from glucose catalysed by Sn-CP/HCl demonstrated high HMF yield (63.9%) and effective catalyst recyclability (HMF yield u003e53.7%). Moreover, when fructose and poly-saccharides (sucrose, inulin, starch and maltose) as feedstocks, HMF yields of more than 55% were obtained. Hence integration of catalytic reaction and conversion of carbohydrates to HMF provided a green process over inexpensive catalyst.",

BGC-823 cells harboring no mutations in either of the exons, and HGC-27 cells containing PIK3CA mutations were employed in the current study. siRNA targeting PIK3CA was chemically synthesized and was transfected into these two cell lines in vitro. mRNA and protein expression of PIK3CA were detected by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. We also measured phosphorylation of a serine/threonine protein kinase (Akt) using Western blotting. The proliferation, migration and invasion of these cells were examined separately by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), wound healing and Transwell chambers assay.The siRNA directed against PIK3CA effectively led to inhibition of both endogenous mRNA and protein expression of PIK3CA, and thus significantly down-regulated phosphorylation of Akt (P < 0.05). Furthermore, simultaneous silencing of PIK3CA resulted in an obvious reduction in tumor cell proliferation activity, migration and invasion potential (P < 0.01). Intriguing, mutant HGC-27 cells exhibited stronger invasion ability than that shown by wild-type BGC-823 cells. Knockdown of PIK3CA in mutant HGC-27 cells contributed to a reduction in cell invasion to a greater extent than in non-mutant BGC-823 cells.siRNA mediated targeting of PIK3CA may specifically knockdown the expression of PIK3CA in gastric cancer cells, providing a potential implication for therapy of gastric cancer.",

In this study we investigated the role and mechanism of miR-493 in the development and progression of nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our data indicated that the expression of miR-493 was markedly reduced in pulmonary carcinoma. The ectopic expression of miR-493 impaired cell growth and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, miR-493 commonly directly targeted E2F1, which resulted in a robust reduction of the expression of mRNA and protein. This effect, in turn, decreased the growth, invasion and metastasis of lung cancer cells. Our findings highlight the importance of miR-493 dysfunction in promoting tumor progression, and implicate miR-493 as a potential therapeutic target in lung cancer.",

        "abstract": "Mercapto functionalized Zr-MOFs have been developed via a one-pot synthesis for the selective adsorption of Hg2+ ions. Mercaptoacetic acid (MAA) or alpha lipoic acid (ALA) was used as the modulators and functionalized molecules to synthesize mercapto functionalized Zr-MOFs (Zr-MOFs-SH(O)). In comparison with the mercapto functionalized Zr-MOFs via the traditional postsynthetic modification (Zr-MOFs-SH(P)), Zr-MOFs-SH(O) had a much higher content of -SH groups, thus leading to a much higher adsorption capacity for Hg2+ ions. In particular, PCN-224-MAA(O) had an adsorption capacity for Hg2+ ions up to 843.6 mg g-1, which is much higher than that of PCN-224-MAA(P) (138.5 mg g-1). Additionally, PCN-224-MAA(O) can be used to reduce Hg2+ ion concentrations (5-20 μg L-1) in water to the limit acceptable (1 μg L-1) for drinking water. Moreover, PCN-224-MAA(O) also exhibited good selectivity, recyclability, and chemical stability.",

        "abstract": "Alcohol consumption is a major health issue and associated with human cancers, such as liver and breast cancers. Alcohol was classed as carcinogen to human by IARC. We have performed in vivo and in vitro studies which demonstrate that diluted ethanol promotes cell proliferation and transformation and tumor formation. Consumption of liquor spirits (white wines) is a popular behavior. However, it is unclear whether liquor spirits affect cellular phenotypes of human cancers. At present study, we used diluted ethanol and liquor spirits (Sample #1 and Sample #2) to determine the changes in RNA polymerase III-dependent gene (Pol III gene) transcription, cell growth and colony formation in the different human cancer lines. The results indicate that low concentration of ethanol increases RNA Pol III gene transcription and rate of cell growth. However, both liquor spirits (Sample #1 and Sample #2) inhibit the activity of RNA Pol III genes and repress cell proliferation of the cancer lines, compared to diluted ethanol. The liquor spirits reduce the rate of colony formation of human breast cancer cells and esophageal carcinoma cells. The inhibitions of the liquor spirits to RNA Pol III genes, cell growth and colony formation are in a dose-dependent manner. These new findings suggest that the liquor spirits contain some active components to repress Pol III gene transcription and cell growth caused by ethanol in different human cancer cells.",

The preliminary functional investigation in vitro indicated that TCRP1 was a new chemo-resistance related gene, which mediated specifically resistance to cisplatin in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) cells. This study aims to futher explore the effect of TCRP1 in OSCC in vivo. Methods: The effect of TCRP1 on sensitivity to cisplatin and 5-Fu was observed through establishing the ectopic tumor animal model of over/silence expression of TCRP1, and then the initiatory mechanism was imvestigated. Results: The outcome of tumor growth curves and tumor weight displayed that TCRP1 significantly increased the resistance to cisplatin in OSCC ectopic tumor, but not to 5-Fu. And the TUNEL assay indicated there were fewer number of apoptosis cells in upregulated TCRP1 tumor tissue. Conclusion: TCRP1 is a novel chemo-resistance related gene, and its functional mechanism is correlated with reducing the cells apoptosis induced by cisplatin.",

Based on the physicochemical property of weak hydrophobic heptapeptide, the concept of pre-adsorption' was proposed in order to take full advantage of partition''and adsorption retention mechanisms for separation. Using this method, four ideal RP-HPLC peaks were obtained by optimizing chromatographic conditions. Meanwhile, the MS information indicated that four peaks had the same value of m/z 761.5 [M+H] +. Through simultaneous peptide sequencing of each racemization product and spectrum superposition of different tandem MS ( MS), the two sets of fragment ions, b and y, were observed, which demonstrated that four racemization products of synthetic heptapeptide were successfully identified.",

This study reports a facile in situ method for the synthesis and immobilization of small silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) at room temperature on natural eggshell membrane (ESM), which presents interwoven fibrous structure and can be used as a unique protein-based biotemplate. Procyanidin (Pro), a typical plant polyphenol extracted from grape seeds and skins, was first grafted onto ESM fibers to serve as both reductant and stabilizer during the synthesis process. As a result, the AgNPs were facilely synthesized and robustly immobilized on the ESM fibers without additional chemical reductant or physical treatments. The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared AgNPs@Pro-ESM composites were characterized by combined microscopy and spectroscopy technologies. The results indicate that small AgNPs with mean diameter of 2.46 nm were successfully prepared on the Pro-ESM biotemplate. The composites exhibited good catalytic activity toward the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). More importantly, these composite catalysts can be easily recovered and reused for more than eight cycles because of their high stability.",

However, traditional assays for the detection of OTA are expensive and complicated. Other than OTA aptamer, OTA itself at high concentration can also adsorb on the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and further inhibit AuNPs salt aggregation. We herein report a new OTA assay by applying the localized surface plasmon resonance effect of AuNPs and their aggregates. The result obtained from only one single linear calibration curve is not reliable, and so we developed a \"double calibration curve\" method to address this issue and widen the OTA detection range. A number of other analytes were also examined, and the structural properties of analytes that bind with the AuNPs were further discussed. We found that various considerations must be taken into account in the detection of these analytes when applying AuNP aggregation-based methods due to their different binding strengths.",

        "abstract": "We report a new paradigm for the rational design of chiral nanostructures that is based on the hierarchical self-assembly of a ferrocene (Fc)-modified dipeptide, ferrocene-l-Phe-l-Phe-OH (Fc-FF). Compared to other chiral self-assembling systems, Fc-FF is unique because of its smaller size, biocompatibility, multiple functions (a redox center), and environmental responsiveness. X-ray and spectroscopic analyses showed that the incorporation of counterions during the hierarchical self-assembly of Fc-FF changed the conformations of the secondary structures from flat β sheets into twisted β sheets. This approach enables chiral self-assembly and the formation of well-defined chiral nanostructures composed of helical twisted β sheets. We identified two elementary forms for the helical twist of the β sheets, which allowed us to create a rich variety of rigid chiral nanostructures over a wide range of scales. Furthermore, through subtle modulations in the counterions, temperature, and solvent, we are able to preci...",

Here, we report that TET is transcriptionally upregulated in gastric cancer, where it correlates with poor prognosis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that TET facilitated gastric carcinogenesis through a noncoding function of the 3'UTR, which interacted with miR-26. This interaction resulted in sequestration of miR-26 from its target EZH2, which released the suppression on EZH2, and thereby led to EZH2 overexpression in gastric cancer. Our findings uncover a novel noncoding function for TET family proteins in facilitating gastric carcinogenesis. .",

        "abstract": "Encapsulation of enzymes during the creation of an emulsion is a simple and efficient route for enhancing enzyme catalysis in organic media. Herein, we report a capsule with a shell comprising a monolayer of silica Janus particles (JPs) (referred to as a monolayer capsule) and a Pickering emulsion for the encapsulation of enzyme molecules for catalysis purposes in organic media using amphiphilic silica JPs as building blocks. We demonstrate that the JP capsules had a monolayer shell consisting of closely packed silica JPs (270 nm). The capsules were on average 5-50 μm in diameter. The stability of the JP capsules (Pickering emulsion) was investigated with the use of homogeneous silica nanoparticles as a control. The results show that the emulsion stabilized via amphiphilic silica JPs presented no obvious changes in physical appearance after 15 days, indicating the high stability of the emulsions and JP capsules. Furthermore, the lipase from Candida sp. was chosen as a model enzyme for encapsulation within the JP capsules during their formation. The catalytic performance of lipase was evaluated according to the esterification of 1-hexanol with hexanoic acid. It was found that the specific activity of the encapsulated enzymes (28.7 U mL(-1)) was more than 5.6 times higher than that of free enzymes in a biphasic system (5.1 U mL(-1)). The enzyme activity was further increased by varying the volume ratio of water to oil and the JPs loadings. The enzyme-loaded capsule also exhibited high stability during the reaction process and good recyclability. In particular, the jellification of agarose in the JP capsules further enhanced their operating stability. We believe that the monolayer structure of the JP capsules, together with their high stability, rendered the capsules to be ideal enzyme carriers and microreactors for enzyme catalysis in organic media because they created a large interfacial area and had low mass transfer resistance through the monolayer shell.",

In the present study, the use of chitosan nanoparticles was proposed to adsorb and recycle chromium ions from aqueous solution with Cr(III) and Cr(VI) removal rates of up to 97.5% and 81.2%, respectively. A chromium-based ceramic powder catalyst was designed and synthesized, the structural properties of the catalyst were characterized, and the catalytic performances of the catalyst were evaluated. The results showed that after chromium was doped into the blank ceramic, the main lattice structure of the ceramic was preserved. Both the specific surface area and pore diameter decreased, and a portion of the Cr(VI) was transformed to Cr(III). The chromium-based ceramic powder and sulfuric acid co-catalyzed the one-pot synthesis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural from glucose in the water/dimethyl sulfoxide system, with the product yield reaching 64.7%.

        "abstract": "To investigate the mechanism of migration phenotype change induced by EBV-LMP1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell line CNE2.Retroviruses RV-LNSX, RV-LMP1, and RV-LMP1(TRADD) prepared previously were used to infect CNE2 cells. After selection with G418, the morphology, the ability of motion and migration in extracellular matrix, expression of LMP1 and E-Cadherin in transgenic cells were observed or detected. Meanwhile, pEcad-luc was respectively co-transfected with pLNSX, pLNSX-LMP1, and pLNSX-LMP1(TRADD), to examine the effect of LMP1 on the transcriptional activity of E-Cadherin promoter in 293 cells.Compared with CNE2 and CNE2-LNSX cells, CNE2-LMP1 cells morphologically changed from typical epithelial appearance to long-spindle fibroblastic morphology with the concomitant loss of cell-to-cell contact, and relative migration of CNE2-LMP1 cells obviously increased (n=3, P< 0.05), while the expression of E-Cadherin was negative in CNE2-LMP1 cells. The transcriptional activity of E-Cadherin promoter and the expression of E-Cadherin was suppressed by LMP1, and the level of suppression was correlated with the concentration of pLNSX-LMP1 (0.2,0.6 and 1.0 microg). LMP1(TRADD) didn't induce the changes of morphology and migration phenotype, nor suppress the transcriptional activity of E-Cadherin promoter and the expression of E-Cadherin in CNE2 cells.EBV-LMP1 promotes the migration and down-regulates the expression of E-Cadherin in CNE2 cells. The mechanism is that EBV-LMP1 suppresses the transcriptional activity of E-Cadherin promoter. TRADD of carboxyl terminus of LMP1 may be the main active domain to promote the migration in NPC cells.",

        "abstract": "Supramolecular self-assembly offers an efficient pathway for creating macroscopically chiral structures in biology and materials science. Here, a new peptide consisting of an N-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) headgroup connected to an aromatic phenylalanine-tryptophan dipeptide and terminated with zwitterionic lysine (Fmoc-FWK) and its cationic form (Fmoc-FWK-NH2) were designed for self-assembly into chiral structures. It was found that the Fmoc-FWK peptide self-assembled into left-handed helical nanoribbons at pH 11.2-11.8, whereas it formed nanofibers at pH 5 and 12 and large flat ribbons composed of many nanofibers in the pH range of 6-11. However, only nanofibers were observed in the cases of Fmoc-FWK-NH2 at different values. A series of structural characterizations based on CD, FTIR, UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy reveal that the electrostatic and aromatic interactions and the associated hydrogen bonding direct the self-assembly into various structures. The enhanced π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding were found in the helical nanoribbons. This difference in intermolecular interactions should be derived from the ionization of carboxyl and amino groups from lysine residues at different pH values. Furthermore, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into the assembly mechanisms. The results imply that a relatively rigid molecular conformation and the strong intramolecular aromatic interaction between Trp and Fmoc groups favor chiral self-assembly. This study is the first attempt to design a Fmoc-tripeptide for the fabrication of helical structures with macroscopic chirality, which provides a successful example and allows us to create new peptide-based chiral assembly systems.",

However, feature selection is time-consuming, particularly for the applications those have thousands of features, such as image retrieval, text mining and microarray data analysis. It is crucial to accelerate the feature selection process. We propose a quantum version of wrapper-based feature selection, which converts a classical feature selection to its quantum counterpart. It is valuable for machine learning on quantum computer. In this paper, we focus on two popular kinds of feature selection methods, i.e., wrapper-based forward selection and backward elimination.

In this work, we investigated the effect of inhibitors, pH, and temperature on the adsorption of exo- and endoglucanases (Cel7A and Cel7B, respectively) on cellulose using quartz crystal microgravimetry with dissipation. The addition of glucose and cellobiose can both inhibit the hydrolysis activity of Cel7A, whereas only cellobiose can inhibit that of Cel7B. Notably, the adsorption was favored by acidic conditions (pH ≤ 4.8) and low temperature, whereas alkaline conditions (pH 9 and 10) facilitated enzyme desorption, which is useful to guide the process of cellulase recovery. The adsorption and hydrolysis activity of Cel7A and Cel7B were both higher at 45 °C than at 25 °C. These findings pave the way to effective regulation of cellulase adsorption and thus improve lignocellulose conversion and cellulase recovery.",

        "abstract": "Cisplatin (DDP) is the first-line chemotherapy drug widely used for the treatment of lung cancer patients, whereas the majority of cancer patients will eventually show resistance to DDP. The mechanisms responsible for DDP resistance are not fully understood. Tongue cancer resistance-associated protein 1 (TCRP1) gene was recently cloned and reported to specially mediate DDP resistance in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. However, the mechanisms of TCRP1-mediated DDP resistance are far from clear, and whether TCRP1 participates in DDP resistance in lung cancer cells remains unknown. Here, we show that TCRP1 contributes to DDP resistance in lung cancer cells. Knockdown of TCRP1 sensitizes the cells to DDP and increases the DDP-induced DNA damage. We have identified that Pol β is associated with DDP resistance, and Pol β knockdown delays the repair of DDP-induced DNA damage in A549/DDP cells. We find TCRP1 interacts with Pol β in lung cancer cells. Moreover, TCRP1 knockdown decreases the level of Pol β and increases the level of its ubiquitination. These results suggest that TCRP1 contributes to DDP resistance through the prevention of Pol β degradation in lung cancer cells. These findings provide new insights into chemoresistance and may contribute to prevention and reversal of DDP resistance in treatment of lung cancer in the future.",

        "abstract": "The induction of senescence for cancer treatment has provoked considerable interest recently. Metformin, a first-line drug for diabetes mellitus type 2, appears to be associated with a lower risk and improved outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The mechanism involved in function of metformin in HCC is poorly understood. We show that low doses of metformin induced hepatoma cell senescence characterized by accumulation of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity (SA-β-gal) and the senescence marker Dec1, whereas the higher doses initiated apoptotic cell death. Metformin-induced senescence was accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation levels of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). The expression of acetylated p53 at Lys382 (Ac-p53) and p21 was also increased, while phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 (p-p53), p53, p16 and pRB was rarely altered after metformin treatment. Moreover, inhibition of AMPK decreased p-AMPK, p-ACC, Ac-p53 and p21 expression, diminished SA-β-gal staining and restored hepatoma cell proliferation. In addition, p53 siRNA transfection attenuated metformin-induced SA-β-gal staining. Intriguingly, co-expression of SIRT1 and p53 dramatically reduced the levels of Ac-p53, however, low doses of metformin treatment partially reversed the effect of SIRT1 on p53 acetylation and elevated SA-β-gal activity. These observations indicate that activation of the AMPK pathway promotes senescence in hepatoma cells exposed to low concentrations of metformin in a p53-dependent manner. Further, low doses of metformin may have the potential to be used as an adjuvant to HCC therapy.",

The qualitative analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed there were minor phenol and diphenyl carbonate in the MPC sample. The mass percent concentration of water in the MPC sample was 0.26%, which was determined by Karl Fischer titration. A gas chromatographic method with an OV-101 capillary column was established for quantifying the minor phenol and DPC in the MPC sample. The quantitative results showed the mass concentrations of phenol and DPC were 2. 04% and 1. 59%, respectively. The difficulty to analyze MPC, the intermediate product of the transesterification of DMC and phenol, was solved with the self-made MPC standard sample.",

        "abstract": "The selective recognition of metal ions is very important and the development of novel chemosensor is still a challenge. Herein, a single dual-emissive fluorescence probe was developed to detect Fe3+ and phytic acid (PA). Red quantum dots (CdSe) were embedded into silica nanoparticles for an internal standard emission, whereas blue carbon dots (CDs) were covalently linked onto the surface of silica as a sensing element to achieve a more precise and sensitive detection. The fluorescence of the CDs was effectively quenched by Fe3+ via a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process. Fe3+ could selectively bind to phytic acid, thus leading to the recovered fluorescence of the CDs in the presence of Fe3+. Upon addition of PA to the CdSe@SiO2-CDs/Fe(III) complex dispersion, the fluorescence of the CDs significantly increased. The ratiometric probe enabled the selective detection of PA within 0.08-1.6 mM and a limit of detection of 1.5 μM. Overall, this method provided high selectivity, stability, and recovery ratio in the detection of Fe3+ and PA.",

On the basis of our former research, this study was designed to clone and analyze a novel NPC-associated gene at this locus.The full-length cDNA sequence of this gene was obtained by plasmid cDNA sequencing and RACE,and analyzed by bioinformatics. The pEGFP-C2/STGC3 fusion mammalian expression vector was constructed, and transfected into COS7 and CNE2 cell lines mediated by lipofectin to analyze the subcellular localization of gene expressing proteins. The expression of STGC3 was detected in normal tissues and tumor cell lines by Northern blot.An 1 271 bp full-length cDNA sequence of gene,which had no obvious homology with other known genes in bioinformatic databases,was obtained. This gene,named STGC3 (GenBank accession number:AY078383), localized on chromosome 3p21, and encodes a protein consisting of 146 amino acids. Protein localization analysis under fluorescent microscope indicated that STGC3 fusion protein was distributed in nucleus and cytoplasm 24-48 hours after transfection. MTE(TM)Array2 Northern blot analysis showed STGC3 expressed in both normal tissues and tumor cells,while its expression down-regulated in many tumor cell lines, such as Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Daudi.STGC3 is a novel gene, and down-regulated in NPC and many other tumor cell lines.

        "abstract": "Survivin (coding gene BIRC5) is a dual functional protein acting as a critical inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) and key regulator of cell cycle progression. It is usually produced in embryonic tissues during development and undetectable in most adult tissues. Overexpression of Survivin frequently occurs in various human cancers and increased Survivin correlates with poor clinic outcome, tumor recurrence, and therapeutic resistance. Because of its selective expression in tumor, but not normal tissues, Survivin has been recognized as an attractive target for cancer treatment. Although several therapeutic approaches targeting Survivin are actively under clinical trials in human cancers, to date no Survivin-targeted therapy has been approved for cancer treatment. Numerous studies have devoted to uncovering the underlying mechanism resulting in Survivin dysregulation at multiple levels, such as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. The current article provides a literature review on the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of Survivin expression in human cancers. We focus on the impact of DNA methylation and histone modifications, including specific lysine methylation, demethylation, and acetylation on the expression of Survivin. The latest development of epigenetic approaches targeting Survivin for cancer treatment are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "A facile approach was developed to immobilize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) onto peptide nanofibers for catalytic applications. In this study, fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl diphenylalanine (Fmoc-FF) was conjuncted with histidine, arginine or cysteine at their C-terminus to provide binding sites for AuNPs. The co-assembly of Fmoc-tripeptide and AuNPs was achieved by dropping the peptide monomer solution directly into the AuNP solution, leading to the formation of nanofibers and the immobilization of AuNPs in one step. Atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscope and circular dichroism analyses demonstrated that the presence of AuNPs does not significantly change the morphology and secondary structure of the nanofibers. The histidine-containing peptide-immobilized AuNPs were found to display favorable catalytic activity and stability for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol. The present approach to fabricating nanomaterial-supported AuNPs may be extended to the production of other nanoparticle-containing composites in the fields of catalysis, sensing and biomedicine.",

METHODS:The nasopharyngeal epithelial cells NP69 were infected with RV-pLNSX (the empty vector) and RV-LMP1 retroviruses,respectively. Therefore,the NP69-pLNSX and NP69-LMP1 cell lines were established. Sequentially,cellular proliferation of NP69-pLNSX and NP69-LMP1 cells was compared to draw the cellular growth curve. The experiments of plate clone formation and forming of soft agar colony were conducted. Meanwhile,the differential expression of proteins were identified between NP69-pLNSX and NP69-LMP1 cell lines by proteomic methods,and the expression levels of partial identified proteins were verified. RESULTS:(1) LMP1 was able to accelerate cellular proliferation of nasopharyngeal epithelial cell NP69 (n=3,P<0.05). (2) Twenty two proteins (9 up-and 13 down-regulated) of LMP1 mediated regulation were identified from infected NP69 cell lines,and the differential expression of partial identified proteins was confirmed by Western blotting and fluorescent real-time quantitative RT-PCR. CONCLUSION:LMP1 probably mediates the regulation of vimentin protein and keratin 19 protein expression to promote cellular proliferation in NP69 cells.",

In this study, our aim was to construct HLCDG1 gene short/small interference double-strand RNA (siRNAs) expression vector and to observe its influence on cell cycle and proliferation of A549 cells. METHODS: Using RNA interference (RNAi) techniques, a DNA vector-driven siRNAs expression vector was constructed, and a lung carcinoma cell line stably expressing siRNAs was also selected. Sequentially, using flow cytometry analysis and MTT assay, the changes of cell cycle and cell proliferation in this cell line were observed. RESULTS: Four site-match and one site-mismatch plasmids were constructed, which were named pHL-si-1, pHL-si-2, pHL-si-3, pHL-si-4 and pHL-si-c. These plasmids were co-transfected with a pcDNA3.1(+)/HLCDG1 plasmid into A549 cells, respectively. Among five co-transfected A549 cell lines, a A549 cell line co-transfected by the pcDNA3.1(+)/HLCDG1 and pHL-si-1 plasmids, namely A549-HLCDG1-si-1, showed nearly complete inhibition of HLCDG1 expression. MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis indicated that A549-HLCDG1-si-1 cells, namely the HLCDG1 gene-silencing cells, got a faster growth compared with other HLCDG1 expression cell lines, and that HLCDG1 gene-silencing induced A549-HLCDG1-si-1 cells into S phase and G_2+M phase significantly. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the HLCDG1 gene is proved to have a markedly inhibitory effect on growth in A549 lung carcinoma cells. This study might provide some understanding of the biological function and molecular mechanism of HLCDG1 gene.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Lung cancer is one of the most lethal cancers due to its highly metastatic spreading. The motility of lung cancer cells is regulated by paracrine factors, such as TGF-β, in the tumor microenvironment through the induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The stability of microtubules is reported to be associated with the EMT process and the migration of cancer cells. Here, we observed that  RCC1 domain-containing protein 1  ( RCCD1 ) is highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with poor prognosis, and  RCCD1  is much higher expressed in tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Depletion of  RCCD1  using siRNAs significantly inhibits the migration of lung cancer cells. Subsequent studies reveal that the loss of RCCD1 results in upregulation of acetylated α-tubulin levels and stabilizes cytoskeletal microtubules. Mechanistically, we observed that RCCD1 modulates the stability of microtubules through interacting with JMJD5. Furthermore, RCCD1 depletion significantly attenuates the TGF-β-induced EMT process, as assessed by altered expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers ( Occludin ,  Vimentin  and  Snail ), and inhibits TGF-β-induced cell migration. Collectively, these findings support RCCD1 as a novel regulator of TGF-β-induced EMT in NSCLC.",

Furthermore, many cases of treatment failure are induced by the chemoresistance of CSCs in breast cancer patients. Therefore, novel strategies should be explored urgently to reverse drug-resistance in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). In this study, we isolated and cultured the BCSCs from the T-47D and SKBR3 breast cancer cell lines. We observed significant resistance to 5-fluorouracil in BCSCs. Mechanically, we found that expression of miR-489 was decreased in BCSCs. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-489 was found to increase the cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil to BCSCs. XIAP, a key anti-apoptotic protein, was proved to be the target of miR-489. We found that enforced expression of XIAP through its recombinant expression vector abolished the effect of miR-489 on reversing the 5-fluorouracil resistance. On the contrary, embelin, a XIAP specific inhibitor, was found to sensitize BCSCs to 5-fluorouracil similarly with miR-489. In summary, our data demonstrate that introduction with miR-489 represents a novel strategy to enhance efficacy of 5-fluorouracil-based treatment in BCSCs.",

The gold nanoparticles with an average diameter of 55 nm were synthesized via the Turkevich method and were then immobilized onto the surface of an uncladded sensor probe using a polydopamine layer. To obtain a sensor probe with high sensitivity to changes in the refractive index, a set of key optimization parameters, including the sensing length, coating time of the polydopamine layer, and coating time of the gold nanoparticles, were investigated. The sensitivity of the optimized sensor probe was 522.80 nm per refractive index unit, and the probe showed distinctive wavelength shifts when the refractive index was changed from 1.328 6 to 1.398,7. When stored in deionized water at 4 °C, the sensor probe proved to be stable over a period of two weeks. The sensor also exhibited advantages, such as low cost, fast fabrication, and simple optical setup, which indicated its potential application in remote sensing and real-time detection.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To research for the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to 5-FU, which was caused by ERS. METHODS: Through MTS test, the sensitivity to 5-FU between breast cancer cell MCF-7 and its derivative 5-FU resistant cell-MCF-7/5-FU were compared. The abundance of endoplasmic reticulum in MCF-7 and MCF-7/5-FU cells were observed by electron microscope. The basal expression levels of ERS markers in MCF-7 and MCF-7/5-FU cells were measured, using Real-time RT-PCR assay. Meanwhile we treated MCF-7 and MCF-7/5-FU cells with 5-FU, then measured the expression levels of ERS markers in MCF-7 and MCF-7/5-FU cells via Real-time RT-PCR assay, in order to study the ERS states in MCF-7 and MCF-7/5-FU. RESULTS: The resistant index of MCF-7/5-FU to 5-FU was 16; The abundance of endoplasmic reticulum was much richer in MCF-7/5-FU than that in MCF-7 cells; The expression level of GRP94 in MCF-7/5-FU was 2.1 folds of that in MCF-7 cell(t=9.288, P=0.003), while CHOP was 1.8 fold (t=6.057, P=0.008); Via Real-time RT-PCR, we tested that the expression levels of CHOP and GRP94 in MCF-7 cells with maximum dose 5-FU were upregulated 12.23 fold (t=15.082, P=0.001) and 2.54 fold (t=6.196, P=0.038) than that in MCF-7 cells, while in MCF-7/5-FU cells with maximum dose 5-FU, they were upregulated 5.45 fold (t=15.451, P=0.003) and 2.38 (t=7.218, P=0.007) fold than that in MCF-7/5-FU cells, respectively. Compared the expression levels of CHOP and GRP94 at 72 h and at 0 h after 5-FU challenge by Real-time RT-PCR, we found that: in MCF-7 cells, the genes mentioned above were upregulated 12.04 fold (t=15.093, P=0.001) and 3.15 fold (t=4.540, P=0.032), respectively; in MCF-7/5-FU cells, the two genes were upregulated 4.20 fold (t=4.363, P=0.005) and 1.88 fold (t=2.875, P=0.041), respectively. In a word, 5-FU could upregulate the expression of GRP94 and CHOP in a dose- and time- dependent manner, especially in MCF-7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: ERS is involved in the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to 5-FU. A mild ERS participates in chemotherapy resisitance and excessive ERS is beneficial to the chemotherapy effect.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the expression of miR-218 (microRNA-218) in NPC (nasopharyngeal carcinoma) tissues and its clinical significance. Methods: A series of 54 tissue biopsies obtained from NPC patients and 35 control tissues with no-NPC (normal nasopharyngeal mucosa or chronic inflammation of nasopharyngeal mucosa) were collected. RFQ-PCR (real-time fluorescencebased quantitative PCR) was used to detect the miR-218 expressions in these samples. The correlations of miR-218 expression with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of NPC patients were analyzed. Results: Compared with the control tissues, miR-218 was consistently down-regulated in NPC tissues. The average expression level of miR-218 in NPC tissues was significantly lower than that of the control tissues (P = 0.000). The expression level of miR-218 in poorly differentiated NPC was significantly reduced as compared with well/moderately differentiated NPC (P = 0.032). The expression level of miR-218 in clinical stages III/IV NPC was lower than that in clinical stages I/II NPC (P = 0.007). Moreover, the expression level of miR-218 in NPC patients with lymph node metastasis was significantly lower than that in NPC patients without lymph node metastasis (P = 0.019). NPC patients with a higher level of miR-218 expression had also a longer survival (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The expression of miR-218 is associated with carcinogenesis, progression and prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, so it may be used as a potential therapeutic target, a diagnostic biomarker and a prognostic predictor in patients with NPC in future.

        "abstract": "We found that levels of miR-491-3p were decreased in multidrug-resistant tongue cancer (TC) cells. Induction of miR-491-3p expression sensitized TC cells to chemotherapy. In agreement, functional inhibition of miR-491-3p enhanced resistance of TC cells to chemotherapy. We found that miR-491-3p directly targeted mTORC2 component Rictor and inhibited mTORC2 activity, which was increased in resistant TC cells with high p-Akt(Ser473), p-SGK1(Ser422) and p-FOXO1(Thr24) levels. Inhibition of mTORC2 activity via either Rictor knockdown or mTOR inhibitor in turn sensitized TC cells to chemotherapy. In agreement, overexpression of Rictor increased the mTORC2 activity and induced resistance of TC cells to chemotherapy. As a feedback loop, mTORC2 downregulated miR-491-3p expression by inactivating FOXO1, which otherwise would transcriptionally induce miR-491-3p expression. Levels of miR-491-3 and Rictor or mTORC2 activity negatively correlated in TC tissues. Finally, low levels of miR-491-3p and highly expressed Rictor were associated with poor prognosis in tongue cancer patients. These data provide a rationale for targeted intervention on miR-491-3p/mTORC2 axis to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy against tongue cancer.",

Amphiphilic peptides have become increasingly attractive in the development of self-assembling hydrogels because of their biological origin. Numerous polysaccharides have also been made amphiphilic as hydrogels, for their good biocompatibility and plentiful functional groups to facilitate chemical modification.

        "abstract": "Due to workload fluctuation, the cloud vendors expect to rent their idle resources with virtual machines (VMs) configured in advance when their workload is lower. By integrating volunteer computing into cloud architectures, we envision a gigantic self-organizing cloud (SOC) being formed to reap the huge potential of untapped commodity computing power via the Internet. However, due to heterogeneity of the resources, the performance difference exists generally. To reduce the risk of the single-point-of-failure, we proposed an election-based resource provision algorithm using those VMs as discrete as possible. We formulate the concept of discreteness for allocating VM for a request that needs k virtual machines. Each VM consists of several servers in multiple cabinets. The discreteness is measured to be the number of cabinets that k virtual machines span. We show that it is an NP-hard problem, and provide a heuristic election algorithm based maximum cost performance. The technologies of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and simple additive weighting (SAW) are adopted to guarantee VM performance that users hope to obtain. The experiment results show more benefits of our algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed tumor type and the primary leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide. Drug resistance is the major obstacle for breast cancer treatment improvement. TRAIL-inducing compound 10 (Tic10), a novel activator of FOXO3, exhibits potent antitumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the resistance reversal effect of Tic10 on multidrug-resistant breast cancer cells T47D/5Fu derived from T47D breast cancer cells. We found that FOXO3a was significantly decreased in T47D/5-Fu cells, whereas treatment of Tic10 enhances FOXO3a expression and nuclear translocation. Moreover, treatment of Tic10 could reverses 5-Fluorouracil resistance of T47D/5-Fu cells via induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that Tic10 decreased the expression of CDK4 via FOXO3a-dependment mechanism. In addition, our data showed that Tic10 could sensitize drug resistant T47D/5-Fu cells to 5-Fu in vivo. Taken together, these data suggested Tic10 as capable of restoring sensitivity for drug-resistant breast cancer cells.",

Insulin fibrils were disaggregated into insulin A- and B-chains in 14 M (w/v) NH(4)OH for 2 h at 60 °C. Insulin monomers, with a MW of ~5,882 Da, were then regenerated by oxidation of sulfhydryls with 30 % (w/v) H(2)O(2) (10 M) for 12 h at 25 °C. No two A-chains or two B-chains of insulin formed during the oxidation process. Because of the inconformity of the optimal reduction and oxidation temperature, the NH(3)/H(2)O(2) two-step method is more practical than the NH(3)/H(2)O(2) coupling method.",

However, the abuse of toxic reagents remains an issue for chemical synthesis method, whereas the low product yield and purity limit the widespread use of enzymatic method. In this study, a new solid-phase enzymatic peptide synthesis (SPEPS) strategy was developed to produce an antioxidant tyrosine-alanine dipeptide (Tyr-Ala) by using recombinant carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) as the catalyst. The general SPEPS procedure involves three steps. First, the N-protected acyl donor was covalently attached to solid resin. Second, the peptide bond was condensed between the acyl donor and the nucleophile under the catalysis of CPY. Finally, one-step cleavage was performed to remove the protecting group and cleave the peptides from solid resin. Upon the optimization of reaction conditions, 77.92% (± 2.723%) yield of Tyr-Ala with high product purity of 90.971% (± 2.695%) was obtained. In addition, the antioxidant activity of Tyr-Ala was determined by ABTS method, indicating that the synthesized Tyr-Ala obtained by SPEPS showed a superior antioxidant capability compared with commercial glutathione.",

The optimal induction condition of the level of protein expression with IPTG induction was established by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and ImageMaster VDS software analysis. The fusion protein can be purified from lysates with Ni-NTA agarose. We found that the fusion protein with apparent molecular weight 32 KD existed in two ways: soluble and insoluble in Escherichia coli. After 1 mM IPTG induction, the level of expression of the fusion protein increased with the prolongation of induction time and reached a peak in 9 h by ImageMaster VDS software analysis, accounting for 57.4% of all the insoluble protein. The purified fusion protein was obtained by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. This fusion protein can be used in further studies on the preparation of MT-I protein and development of protein product.",

        "abstract": "For the analysis of massive samples containing multiple analytes, the enhancement of detection efficiency is crucial. In this study, a facile method was developed for sequential detection of chloramphenicol (CAP) and gentamicin (GEN) in complex samples, e.g. milk, using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensor. Based on the immune inhibition format, two conjugates of antigen and bovine serum albumin (BSA)-denoted as CAP-BSA and GEN-BSA-were grafted on the same channel of the SPR sensor chip. Two standard curves for CAP and GEN were separately obtained by first mixing a single antibody with different concentrations of the relevant antigen. Moreover, different regeneration solutions were screened for sequential analysis. An alkaline solution was found to completely remove the antibody against GEN (AbGEN) from the chip, but it exhibited limited ability to dissociate the antibody against CAP (AbCAP). Therefore, alkaline solution and Gly-HCl solutions are successively applied to elute AbGEN and AbCAP, respectively. By gradual elutions, CAP and GEN concentrations were simultaneously calculated with limit of detection values of 5.28ng/mL and 2.26ng/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the spiking milk samples with CAP and GEN validated the assay with recoveries of 77.6-101.1%. Therefore, this method is expected to improve the detection efficiency of SPR biosensors.",

Nasopharyngeal cancer CNE2 cells were transfected with miR-216b mimics, and then qRT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to detect the expressions of PKCa mRNA and protein. The effects of PKCα downregulation on cell proliferation and invasion were assessed after PKCα siRNA were transfected into CNE2 cells. CNE2 cells were cotransfected with miR-216b mimics and PKCα plasmid, and the proliferation of CNE2 cells was assayed using a MTS cell proliferation assay kit.The results of dual-luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated that miR-216b could bind to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of PKCα and inhibited the luciferase activity to 62.4% of that of the mimics control cells. The expressions of PKCα mRNA and protein were significantly down-regulated by 49.1% and 55.7%, respectively, in comparison with that of the control cells. siRNA-mediated downregulation of PKCα suppressed the proliferation and invasion ability of CNE2 cells, and could partially mimic the tumor-inhibiting effect of miR-216b. Moreover, the overexpressed PKCα may partially reverse the inhibitory effect of miR-216b on proliferation of CNE2 cells.miR-216b suppresses cell proliferation and invasion by targeting PKCα in NPC cells.",

Here, the hierarchical co-assembly of two aromatic peptides, diphenylalanine (FF) and ferrocene-diphenylalanine (Fc-FF), is reported via sequential, combinatorial assembly. The resulting dandelion-like microstructures have highly complex architectures, where FF microtube arrays serve as the scapes and the Fc-FF nanofibers serve as the flower heads. Homogeneous FF microtubes with diameters tailored between 1 and 9 μm and wall thickness ranging from 70 to 950 nm are initially formed by controlling the degree of supersaturation of the FF and the water content. Once the FF microtubes are formed, the growth of the dandelion-like microstructures is then driven by the capillary force, derived from the wetting and drying of the Fc-FF solution on the FF microtubes. This simple and ingenious strategy offers many opportunities to develop new and creative methods for controlling the hierarchical self-assembly of peptides and thus building highly complex nano and microstructures.",

In the GAN framework, the generator is trained by an adversarial discriminator, in order to generate new samples that follows the probability distribution of a given training dataset. Classical GANs cannot generate discrete data due to the requirement of differentiability on the design of generators. In this paper, we propose a quantum version of GAN for generation of discrete data, which complements classical GANs. Our quantum GAN is composed of a parameterized quantum circuit as the generator and a classical feedforward neural network as the discriminator. Two families of quantum circuits, both composed of simple one-qubit rotation and two-qubit controlled-phase gates, are considered. The analytic gradient of the quantum generator can be estimated by sampling the same quantum generator, so gradient-based methods can be used in the training. The results of a small-scale proof-of-principle numerical simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of our scheme.",

        "title": "Increased erbB3 promotes erbB2/neu-driven mammary tumor proliferation and co-targeting of erbB2/erbB3 receptors exhibits potent inhibitory effects on breast cancer cells.",
        "abstract": "The kinase deficient erbB3 receptor frequently co-expresses and interacts with erbB2 in human breast cancer to activate the oncogenic signaling pathways, and thus promote breast cancer cell survival/proliferation. In the current study, we discovered that the expression of endogenous mouse erbB3 was increased in the mammary tumors-derived from wild type (wt) rat erbB2/neu-transgenic mice, and the co-expression of erbB2 and erbB3 significantly promoted mammary tumor proliferation in vivo. Co-immunoprecipitation assays detected a heterodimeric complex consisting of the transgene encoded protein rat erbB2 and the endogenous mouse erbB3 in the mammary tumors. Specific knockdown of mouse erbB3 dramatically inhibited proliferation of the mammary tumor cell lines-derived from the transgenic mice. Elevated expression of erbB3 protein, but not mRNA, was abserved in human breast cancer cells upon ectopic expression of erbB2. Additional studies revealed that overexpression of erbB2 downregulated three erbB3-targeting miRNAs, miR-125a, miR-125b, and miR-205, whereas the erbB2 kinase inhibitor (lapatinib) significantly enhanced expression of the three miRNAs in breast cancer cells, suggesting that erbB2 might regulate erbB3 expression through a miRNA-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, an anti-erbB3 monoclonal IgG1 antibody (Ab) in combination with Herceptin mainly inactivated Akt and significantly inhibited proliferation of erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Collectively, our data indicate that increased expression of erbB3 plays a pivotal role in activating downstream PI-3K/Akt pathway and promoting erbB2-driven mammary/breast tumorigenesis. Simultaneous targeting of erbB2 and erbB3 with two IgG1 Abs may be an effective strategy to treat breast cancer patients whose tumors overexpress both erbB2 and erbB3.",

        "abstract": "A novel signal amplification strategy for quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) based on catalytic gas generation was developed to construct an ultrasensitive immunosensor for the detection of proteins (immunoglobulin G, IgG, used as a model). A catalase modified immunoparticle was prepared to form a sandwich-type immunocomplex with the IgG and anti-IgG antibodies that were immobilized on the QCM sensor. The amount of immunoparticles on the sensor surface was thus controlled by the IgG concentration. Then H2O2 was added and catalyzed by catalase for oxygen generation. The generated oxygen replaced some of the liquid on the sensor surface, leading to the change in the shear modulus of the immunocomplex layer and the apparent viscosity and density of the liquid layer. Due to the ultrasensitive response of QCM to these changes, a significant frequency shift related to the IgG concentration was achieved. Different parameters, including the flow cell structure, operation temperature, immunoparticle concentration, and H2O2 concentration were optimized to achieve steady and efficient frequency shifts. Under the optimal conditions, the proposed gas-phase amplified QCM sensor could achieve up to 72 times improvement of detection sensitivity compared to the label-free sensor as a control, in the concentration range of 0.1-3.0 μg mL(-1). The detection limit was also reduced from 236 ng mL(-1) to 51.0 ng mL(-1) at the 3Sblank level.",

        "abstract": "Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors have many possible applications, but are limited by sensor chip surface fouling, which blocks immobilization and specific binding by the recognizer elements. Therefore, there is a pressing need for the development of antifouling surfaces. In this paper, the mechanisms of antifouling materials were firstly discussed, including both theories (hydration and steric hindrance) and factors influencing antifouling effects (molecular structures and self-assembled monolayer (SAM) architectures, surface charges, molecular hydrophilicity, and grafting thickness and density). Then, the most recent advances in antifouling materials applied on SPR biosensors were systematically reviewed, together with the grafting strategies, antifouling capacity, as well as their merits and demerits. These materials included, but not limited to, zwitterionic compounds, polyethylene glycol-based, and polysaccharide-based materials. Finally, the prospective research directions in the development of SPR antifouling materials were discussed. Statement of Significance Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is a powerful tool in monitoring biomolecular interactions. The principle of SPR biosensors is the conversion of refractive index change caused by molecular binding into resonant spectral shifts. However, the fouling on the surface of SPR gold chips is ubiquitous and troublesome. It limits the application of SPR biosensors by blocking recognition element immobilization and specific binding. Hence, we write this paper to review the antifouling mechanisms and the recent advances of the design of antifouling materials that can improve the accuracy and sensitivity of SPR biosensors. To our knowledge, this is the first review focusing on the antifouling materials that were applied or had potential to be applied on SPR biosensors.",

        "abstract": "Proceedings: AACR 106th Annual Meeting 2015; April 18-22, 2015; Philadelphia, PATCRP-1 (Tongue Cancer Resistance-related Protein-1) gene was recently cloned from the multidrug resistance tongue cancer cell (Tca8113/PYM) which developed by ourselves team (GeneBank accession number: [EF36480][1]). Subsequently we found that the gene can mediate tongue cancer cells to specific cisplatin chemotherapy tolerance and radiotherapy tolerance, and its mechanism may be caused at least in part by TCRP1 induced activation of the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway and promotes cell survival. Recently, using real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical method to detect various types of tumors and control normal tissue, we found that expression of TCRP1 in lung cancer, ovarian cancer and glioma were significantly higher than that of normal tissue. These results suggest that TCRP1 gene may be closely related to the carcinogenesis. In the present study we constructed a lentiviral vector expressing TCRP1 to transfect NIH/3T3 cells, and found proliferation rate of NIH/3T3/TCRP1 cells was significantly improved compared with NIH/3T3 cells and NIH/3T3/vector cells by detection with the CellTiter-Glo Assay. Clonogenic capacity of NIH/3T3/TCRP1 cells was 5.39 times and 20.18 times higher than the control group in plate cloning and soft agar cloning assay. Subcutaneous tumorigenicity experiment with self-controlled in 10 nude mice found only the injected site of NIH/3T3/TCRP1 cell emergence nodular masses about 1cm diameter after 3 weeks, and the tumorigenic rate was 90%. Pathological diagnosis of mass was fibrosarcoma. These results suggest that TCRP1 gene own an oncogene-like effect. In order to study the TCRP1 tumorigenic mechanisms, gene chips were used and showed that expression of total of 1894 genes were up-regulated and 3626 genes were down-regulated. Among these genes, the verification results of PDPK1, Akt, GSK3β and cyclinD1 were consistent with microarray results. Co-immunoprecipitation assay indicate that TCRP1 interact with PDPK1; FRET(Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer)experiments shows that TCRP1 can directly bind to PDPK1. On the other hand, the growth rate and in vitro colony forming ability of NIH/3T3/TCRP1 cells was significantly inhibited after using PDPK1 inhibitor AR-12 and TCRP1 interference. These data suggest that TCRP1 mediated PI3K/Akt pathway to the excessive activation by recruiting recruitment and activating of PDPK1, resulting in a series of growth and proliferation and cell transformation related factor expression or activation of its downstream. This may be the possible mechanism of cell malignant transformation induced by TCRP1.{This study was supported by grant from National Natural Science Foundation (81472184) of China.}Citation Format: Chengkun Wang, Xiaorong Liu, Qinwei Qiu, Zhijie Zhang, Jiang Yin, Guopei Zheng, Zhimin He.

In the meantime, there are some researches that use parameterized quantum circuits to generate simple patterns. In this paper, we present a quantum version of GAN, where parameterized quantum circuits are trained by an adversarial discriminator, to generate new samples that follows the probability distribution of a given training dataset. Two families of quantum circuits, both composed of simple one-qubit rotation and two-qubit controlled-phase gates, are considered. The parameters are learned through classical gradient descent optimization. The results of a small-scale proof-of-principle numerical experiment demonstrate that quantum circuits can be trained in an adversarial way for generative tasks.",

        "abstract": "To predict and screen candidate miRNAs targeting PIK3CA gene, and detect their expression in gastric cancer cells and serum. Candidate miRNAs (miR-203 and miR-506) targeting PIK3CA were screened through bioinformatics combined with the previous literature and our previous study. Total RNA in gastric cancer cells and serum was extracted routinely and treated with DNase I. miR-203, miR-506 and internal control U6 in total RNA preparation were reverse transcribed by specific stem-loop primers. Real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-fqPCR) was adopted to quantify target miRNAs and U6. Quantitative PCR product was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: RNA quality isolated from cells and serum was confirmed to be good by electrophoresis. U6, miR-16 and miR-224 were amplified and quantified specifically in gastric cancer cells and serum. miR-203 expression levels between gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901 (1.360 ± 0.102) and MGC-803 (1.241 ± 0.110) had no significant difference (t=3.125, P=0.09). But, it was significantly lower in the serum of patients with gastric cancer (1.420 ± 0.122) than that in healthy people (3.450 ± 0.206), t=2.521, P=0.02.Expression level of miR-506 showed no significant difference between gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901 and MGC-803 as well as in the serum of gastric cancer patients and healthy people, Which were 1.256± 0.113, 1.158 ± 0.109, 1.735 ± 0.220, 1.592 ± 0.134, respectively (P > 0.05). miR-203 may be one of the miRNAs regulating PIK3CA gene. The high expression level of PIK3CA in gastric cancer may be associated with abnormally low expression of miR-203, while it has nothing to do with miR-506. The expression of miR-203 in the serum of patients with gastric cancer, is expected to become an important molecular marker for predicting gastric cancer development or progression.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), discovered in 1998, is a novel member of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) membrane transporters superfamily. This study was to establish the functional expression of BCRP with doxycycline (Dox) induced Tet regulating system in mouse fibroblast cell line PA317, provide an ideal experimental platform for understanding the mechanism of BCRP-mediated drug resistance, and develop effective methods to reverse the drug-resistance.Tet-on regulating plasmid was transferred into PA317 cells under the Dox induced Tet-on regulating system, and stable expression of Tet-on was established in PA317 cells through G418 selection. The response plasmid of recombinant pTRE-BCRP was transferred into positive PA317/Tet-on cells, and stable expression of BCRP was established through hygromycin selection. Six single cellular clones were taken and cultivated in amplification. Positive PA317/Tet-on/TRE-BCRP cells, which showed well dose-response in expression of BCRP with different concentration of Dox induction, were selected by both reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. The inhibitory effects of mitoxantrone on positive PA317/Tet-on/TRE-BCRP cells with various concentrations of Dox induction were detected by MTT method. Ko143, a specific inhibitor of BCRP, was used to detect the drug sensitivity of positive PA317/Tet-on/TRE-BCRP cells to mitoxantrone. Fluorescence intensity of remaining intracellular mitoxantrone in positive PA317/Tet-on/TRE-BCRP cells with different expression of BCRP was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM).The positive No.5 PA317/Tet-on /TRE-BCRP cell clone showed well dose-response in expression of BCRP with different concentration of Dox induction; its drug-resistance against mitoxantrone has positive correlation with BCRP expression (r=0.995, P=0.002); its drug sensitivity to mitoxantrone was significantly enhanced by Ko143 (P< 0.05). Furthermore, different expression of BCRP induced by various concentrations of Dox caused different intracellular mitoxantrone retention in this cell clone.Functional expression of BCRP under Dox induced Tet regulating system was successfully established in PA317 cells, which provided an ideal experimental platform for further study of BCRP.",

        "abstract": "Recently, enzymatic peptide synthesis has drawn increasing attention due to its eco-friendly reagents and mild conditions, as compared to traditional chemical peptide synthesis. In this study, we successfully produced an important antioxidant dipeptide precursor, BOC-Tyr-Ala, via a kinetically controlled enzymatic peptide synthesis reaction, catalyzed by the recombinant carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) expressed in P. pastoris GS115. In this reaction, the enzyme activity was 95.043 U/mL, and we used t-butyloxycarbonyl-l-tyrosine-methyl ester (BOC-Tyr-OMe) as the acyl donor and l-alanine (l-Ala) was the amino donor. We optimized the reaction conditions to be: 30 °C, pH 9.5, organic phase (methanol)/aqueous phase = 1:20, BOC-Tyr-OMe 0.05 mol/L, Ala 0.5 mol/L, and a reaction time of 12 h. Under these conditions, the dipeptide yield reached 49.84%. Then, we established the kinetic model of the synthesis reaction in the form of Michaelis–Menten equation according to the concentration–time curve during the process and the transpeptidation mechanism. We calculated the apparent Michaelis constant \\(K_{\\text{m}}^{\\text{app}}\\) and the apparent maximum reaction rate \\(r_{\\hbox{max} }^{\\text{app}}\\) to be \\(2.9946 \\times 10^{{^{ - 2} }} {\\text{ mol/L}}\\) and \\(2.0406 \\times 10^{ - 2} {\\text{ mmol/(mL}}\\,{\\text{h)}}\\), respectively.",

The highly charged peptides could self-assemble into rigid helical nanofilaments in water and spontaneously order into hexagonal liquid-crystalline phases with interfilament separations of ≤240 A. The formation of liquid crystals from the self-assembly of such simple peptides is dictated not only by the concentration and pH but also by the amino acid sequence of the peptides. Peptides containing the rigid Phe-Phe (FF) segment showed much higher propensities to form a liquid-crystalline phase with long-range order. Moreover, because of the intrinsic chirality of the peptides, the self-assembled birefringent liquid crystals could serve as sensing elements for the visual discrimination of chiral species and as templates for the biomimetic synthesis of mesoporous silica with ordered cavities. The results offer new opportunities for the design of peptide liquid crystals that are potenti...",

An efficient enzyme immobilization method was further developed by covalently bonding enzymes to the polydopamine (PDA) layer along with the formation of such colloidosomes with lipase as a model enzyme. In this enzyme system, the PDA layer served as a cross-linking layer and enzyme support for simultaneously enhancing the colloidosomes’ stability and improving surface availability of the enzymes for catalytic reaction.

This study was designed to identify the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) associated with NPC at chromosome 3p21 in order to clone new candidate NPC-associated genes at the locus.The expression of relative ESTs at 3p21 was determined in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues and normal nasopharyngeal epithelia using ESTs homology analysis with bioinformatics in computer network combined with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The expression of EST was detected in other normal tissues and tumor cell lines using Northern blot analysis.Comparing with expression of normal nasopharyngeal epithelia, EST (N31985) was down-regulated in 60.00% (3/5) nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines and 47.06% (16/34) nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues (P < 0.05).N31985 is down-regulated in NPC, suggesting it may play a role in NPC carcinogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Pomelo peel is an abundant pectin-rich biomass waste in China and has the potential to serve as a source of fuels and chemicals. This study reports a promising way to deal with pomelo peel waste and to utilize it as raw material for ethanol production via simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). An integrated strategy, incorporating hydrothermal treatment, multienzyme formulation, and fed-batch operation, was further developed to enhance the ethanol production. The results show that hydrothermal treatment (120 °C, 15 min) could significantly reduce the use of cellulase (from 7 to 3.8 FPU g(-1)) and pectinase (from 20 to 10 U g(-1)). A multienzyme complex, which consists of cellulase, pectinase, β-glucosidase, and xylanase, was also proven to be effective to improve the hydrolysis of pretreated pomelo peel, leading to higher concentrations of fermentative sugars (36 vs 14 g L(-1)) and galacturonic acid (23 vs 9 g L(-1)) than those with the use of a single enzyme. Furthermore, to increase the final ethanol concentration, fed-batch operation by adding fresh substrate was employed in the SSF process. A final solid loading of 25% (w/v), which is achieved by adding 15% fresh substrate to the SSF system at an initial solid loading of 10%, produced 36 g L(-1) ethanol product in good yield (73.5%). The ethanol concentration is about 1.73-fold that at the maximum solid loading of 14% for batch operation, whereas both of them have a closed ethanol yield. The results indicate that the use of the fed-batch mode could alleviate the decrease in ethanol yield at high solid loading, which is caused by significant mass transfer limitation and increased inhibition of toxic compounds in the SSF process. The integrated strategy demonstrated in this work could open a new avenue for dealing with pectin-rich biomass wastes and utilization of the wastes to produce ethanol.",

The metabolic flux model was solved by using linear programming optimization based on the target functions of the metabolic flux distribution of maximum β-mannanase synthesis and maximum cell density. Furthermore, the maximum theoretical yield of β-mannanase from Bacillus licheniformis was calculated as 57.87%. Finally, five important metabolic nodes in the metabolic network of Bacillus licheniformis were analyzed, and two nodes, ribulose 5-phosphate and oxalacetate, were characterized as non-rigid ones, which would guide us to enhance the productivity of p-mannanase using gene engineering.",

        "abstract": "The increasing demand for long lasting antifouling surfaces has steered the development of accessible, novel, biocompatible and environmentally-friendly materials. Inspired by lubricin (LUB), a component of mammalian synovial fluid with excellent antifouling properties, we designed three block polymers with bottle-brush structures and outstanding stability, efficacy, and ease of use. By a simple drop casting or online exposure, the polymers strongly adsorbed on silica surfaces in less than 10 min and were found to be stable in extremely high-salinity solutions and under an unprecedented wide range of pH. The polymers antifouling properties against proteins and bacteria were evaluated using different techniques, demonstrating ultralow fouling properties. With serum albumin and lysozyme adsorption < 0.2 ng/cm2, the polymers were found to be 50 and 25 times more effective than LUB and the known ultralow fouling coatings. The antifouling properties were also successfully tested under MPa compression pressures by direct force measurements using the surface forces apparatus (SFA). The findings of this study suggest that these polymers are amongst the most robust and efficient antifouling agents known today.",

        "abstract": "Elevated expression of HER3, which interacts with HER2 in breast cancer cells, confers chemoresistance via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K)/Akt-dependent upregulation of Survivin. However, the underlying mechanism is not clear. Ectopic expression or specific knockdown of HER3 in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells did not alter Survivin mRNA levels and Survivin protein stability, supporting the notion that HER3 signaling may regulate specific miRNAs that target Survivin to alter its protein translation. Here we showed that overexpression and specific knockdown of HER3 reduced and enhanced expression of two Survivin-targeting miRNAs, miR-203 and miR-542-3p, in breast cancer cells, respectively. While the specific inhibitor of either miR-203 or miR-542-3p attenuated an anti-HER3 antibody-induced downregulation of Survivin, inhibition of miR-542-3p exhibited a better efficacy than miR-203 inhibition did. Consistently, miR-542-3p mimic was much more effective than miR-203 mimic not only in inhibition of Survivin, but also in enhancement of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Moreover, the combination of miR-542-3p mimic and paclitaxel, as compared with either agent alone, significantly inhibited in vivo tumor growth of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Collectively, our data indicated that the HER3/PI-3K/Akt signaling upregulates Survivin via suppression of miR-203 and miR-542-3p. Because miR-542-3p has three binding sites on the 3'-UTR of Survivin mRNA, its mimic was able to effectively downregulate Survivin in vitro and in vivo. Thus, miR-542-3p-replacement therapy is an excellent approach to overcome HER3-mediated paclitaxel resistance and significantly enhances the antitumor activity of paclitaxel against HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.",

The results show that the specific catalytic activity of the immobilized enzyme (33.2 U mL–1) was 6.5 and 1.4 times higher than that of free enzyme (5.1 U mL–1) and encapsulated enzyme in the liquid core (23.3 U mL–1), respectively.

        "abstract": "DNA is the well-known molecular target of current platinum-based anticancer drugs; consequently, their clinical use is severely restricted by their systemic toxicities and drug resistance originating from non-selective DNA damage. Various strategies have been developed to circumvent the shortcomings of platinum-based chemotherapy but the inherent problem remains unsolved. Here we report that platinum pyrithione (PtPT), a chemically well-characterized synthetic complex of platinum, inhibits proteasome function and thereby exhibits greater and more selective cytotoxicity to multiple cancer cells than cisplatin, without showing discernible DNA damage both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, unlike the classical proteasome inhibitor bortezomib/Velcade which inhibits the proteasome via blocking the peptidase activity of 20S proteasomes, PtPT primarily deactivates 26S proteasome-associated deubiquitinases USP14 and UCHL5. Furthermore, PtPT can selectively induce cytotoxicity and proteasome inhibition in cancer cells from leukemia patients but not peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy humans. In nude mice, PtPT also remarkably inhibited tumor xenograft growth, without showing the adverse effects that were induced by cisplatin. Hence, we have discovered a new platinum-based anti-tumor agent PtPT which targets 26S proteasome-associated deubiquitinases rather than DNA in the cell and thereby exerts safer and more potent anti-tumor effects, identifying a highly translatable new platinum-based anti-cancer strategy.

The crystals were stabilized through the successive hydrogen-bonding network constructed between the water and aspartame molecules.

        "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are the most prevalent forms of arthritis in the elderly. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms of these diseases and identify underlying therapeutic targets. Using GSE1919 microarray data sets downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, we screened differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in OA and RA cells. The underlying molecular mechanisms of these crucial genes were investigated by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis. Small molecule expression and SNP analysis were also conducted by searching CMap and dbSNP databases. More than 320 genes changed in the arthritic cells and there were only 196 DEGs between OA and RA. OA and RA activated the classic mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, insulin signaling pathway, antigen processing and presentation and intestinal immune network for IgA production. Graft-versus-host disease and autoimmune thyroid disease-related pathways were also activated in OA and RA. Parthenolide and alsterpaullone may be treatments for OA and RA and insulin-like growth factor 1, collagen α2(I) chain and special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 may be critical SNP molecules in arthritis. Our findings shed new light on the common molecular mechanisms of OA and RA and may provide theoretical support for further clinical therapeutic studies.",

        "abstract": "The migration of five different photoinitiators from kraft paper to two fatty food simulants, Tenax(®) and 95% ethanol, was investigated under different conditions. The effects of temperature and storage time, as well as the physicochemical properties of the photoinitiators on migration, were discussed. Mathematical models based on Fick's second law generated from two cases, single- and two-side contacts, were applied to predict the migration behaviour from the paper to the food simulants. The partition coefficients estimated from the model decreased with temperature. The diffusion coefficients of the selected photoinitiators from the paper ranged from 1.55 × 10(-10) to 7.54 × 10(-9) cm(2) s(-1) for Tenax and from 2.79 × 10(-9) to 8.03 × 10(-8) cm(2) s(-1) for 95% ethanol. The results indicate that the applied model can predict the migration of photoinitiators in the initial short period before equilibrium, and the migration from paper to Tenax through a single-side contact demonstrated an especially high concordance.

        "abstract": "Salvianolic acid B and rosmarinic acid are two main water-soluble active ingredients from Salvia miltiorrhiza with important pharmacological activities and clinical applications. The interactions between salvianolic acid B (or rosmarinic acid) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the presence and absence of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) with three different sizes were investigated by using biophysical methods for the first time. Experimental results proved that two components quenched the fluorescence of BSA mainly through a static mechanism irrespective of the absence or presence of Au NPs. The presence of Au NPs decreased the binding constants of salvianolic acid B with BSA from 27.82% to 10.08%, while Au NPs increased the affinities of rosmarinic acid for BSA from 0.4% to 14.32%. The conformational change of BSA in the presence of Au NPs (caused by a noncompetitive binding between Au NPs and drugs at different albumin sites) induced changeable affinity and binding distance between drugs and BSA compared with no Au NPs. The competitive experiments revealed that the site I (subdomain IIA) of BSA was the primary binding site for salvianolic acid B and rosmarinic acid. Additionally, two compounds may induce conformational and micro-environmental changes of BSA. The results would provide valuable binding information between salvianolic acid B (or rosmarinic acid) and BSA, and also indicated that the Au NPs could alter the interaction mechanism and binding capability of drugs to BSA, which might be beneficial to understanding the pharmacokinetics and biological activities of the two drugs.",

Based on the information of casein micelle structure, the possible reaction mechanism was deduced from a series of chromatograms. Being taken into account the primary structure of whole casein and the target amino acid of trypsin, the distribution of theoretical peptides were accurately calculated by determining the split sites of complete enzymatic hydrolysis.

The corncob pretreated using USAA has a lower hemicellulose content (28.9% vs 31.8%), a slightly lower crystallinity index value (42.7% vs 43.7%), and a larger surface cavity diameter (> 36 μm vs < 20 μm) than that pretreated using soaking in aqueous ammonia (SAA) pretreatment.

        "abstract": "Amyloid fibrillation of proteins is likely a key factor leading to the development of amyloidosis-associated diseases. Inhibiting amyloid fibrillation has become a crucial therapeutic strategy. Water-soluble, fluorescent silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) have great potential in biomedicine for various therapeutic and diagnostic purposes; however, it is unclear whether SiNPs have the ability to inhibit amyloid fibrillation. Herein, insulin was chosen as a protein model, and SiNPs of varying sizes were synthesized upon UV irradiation. The influence of size and concentration of the SiNPs on insulin fibrillation was investigated, and it has been observed that these variables were crucial in regulating insulin fibrillation. Using an average particle size of 6.6 nm and increasing the concentration of the SiNPs to 5.0 μg mL, the Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence intensity decreased significantly by 90%, with an increased lag time of 76.8 h, compared to that of the control. Insulin aggregates were short, thin fibrils or clusters when incubated with SiNPs, compared to the long, thick fibrils formed for insulin alone. Additionally, we found that the SiNPs prevent the conformational transition of insulin from its initial structure to β-sheets, and thus inhibit nucleation, which is necessary for the formation of large fibrils. The inhibitory activity is attributed to the interactions between the SiNPs and insulin during the nucleation period. Our results demonstrate that the SiNPs disrupt insulin amyloid fibrillation, and thus, may play a useful role in new therapeutic and diagnostic strategies for amyloid-related disorders.",

Here we adopted tannic acid (TA) as stabilizer to synthesize high activity Fe-Pd nanoparticles (NPs) and scavenger of the generated Fe ions to keep the rapid dechlorination of two organochlorides. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and UV–vis spectroscopy measurements indicated the generated Fe ions were harvested by TA and formed bis- and tris-TA-iron complexes in the dechlorination solution. TA promoted 40-fold and 10-fold increase in dechlorination efficiency of  p -chlorophenol and florfenicol attributing to the complexation of Fe ion by TA. This strategy may inspire novel ways to deal with the passivation of nZVI caused by the precipitation of Fe ions and benefits for the developing of longevity and high-efficient nZVI materials.",

        "abstract": "Traditional machine learning techniques may suffer from evasion attack in which an attacker intends to have malicious samples to be misclassified as legitimate at test time by manipulating the samples. It is crucial to evaluate the security of a classifier during the development of a robust system against evasion attack. Current security evaluation for Support Vector Machine (SVM) is very time-consuming, which largely decreases its availability in applications with big data. In this paper, we propose a fast security evaluation of support vector machine against evasion attack. It calculates the security of an SVM by the average distance between a set of malicious samples and the hyperplane. Experimental results show strong correlation between the proposed security evaluation and the current one. Current security measure min-cost-mod runs 24,000 to 551,000 times longer than our proposed one on six datasets.",

        "abstract": "Based on corn cobs, a pretreatment process in modest conditions (atmospheric pressure and moderate reaction temperature) was designed to fractionate lignocellulose by using formic acid. During the pretreatment, the hemicellulose was hydrolyzed quickly and most of the lignin was dissolved in the solution, but the cellulose almost could not be hydrolyzed. After solid-liquid separation and reagent recycling, corn cobs were separated into cellulose, hemicellulose hydrolysates and lignin. The effects of reaction temperature, pretreatment time and concentration of formic acid on the separated components and the obtained hydrolysates (soluble sugars) during the fractionation were studied. The HPLC results showed that the masses of soluble sugars and lignin increased quickly at first, and then changed slowly. The effect of temperature from 50 to 75℃ was not obvious. By considering efficiency and cost, the optimal operating conditions were chosen as: reaction temperature 60℃, reaction time 3 h, and concentration of formic acid 88%(ω). Under the conditions the recovery rates of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin could reach 91.4%, 88.5% and 63.7%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Encapsulation of enzymes with enhanced activity and recyclability in water-in-oil Pickering emulsions is a simple and efficient method for their immobilization; however, the effect produced by the structure of colloidal particles on the stabilization of the Pickering emulsion for enzyme catalysis has not been investigated in detail. In this study, four types of hydrophobic Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) with similar chemical compositions, particle diameters, but different surface characteristics have been prepared and utilized for enzyme encapsulation in various water-in-oil magnetic Pickering emulsions, after which the relationship between NPs structure, size of emulsions droplets, and enzyme activity is examined. The obtained results indicate that (i) the more hydrophobic Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs cause the higher enzyme activity; (ii) the higher hydrophobicity of oil phase also increases the enzyme activity, especially for Fe3O4@w-SiO2 NPs which form in the solvent of water. The results are mainly attributed to the higher specific surface area of emulsion droplets and interfacial mass transfer of substrates through the interfaces of droplets. The reported data provide new insights into the mechanism of stabilization of Pickering emulsions for enhancing enzyme activity and demonstrate efficient theoretical references for enzyme immobilization and synthesis of stable and active biocatalysts with high recyclability.",

        "abstract": "Emerging evidence has revealed a negative correlation between Forkhead box-O (FOXO) expression and prostate cancer grade and spread, indicating its role as a suppressor of prostate cancer metastasis. However, there is still incomplete understanding about the role of FOXO transcription factors in prostate cancer progression. In this investigation, we demonstrate that FOXO3a significantly inhibits the expression β-catenin in prostate cancer cells. The mechanism of inhibiting β-catenin expression involves the FOXO3a-mediated transactivated microRNA-34b/c, which consequently suppressed β-catenin mRNA expression by targeting the untranslated regions (UTRs) of β-catenin. Additionally, FOXO3a can directly bind to β-catenin, and competes with TCF for interaction with β-catenin, thereby inhibiting β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity and reducing the expression of β-catenin target genes. Furthermore, prostate cancer cells expressing FOXO3a shRNAs display mesenchymal characteristics, including enhanced cell migration and differential regulation of the EMT markers, whereas knockdown of β-catenin results in reversal of shFOXO3a-mediated EMT phenotypic changes. Collectively, these observations demonstrated that FOXO3a inhibits malignant phenotypes that are dependent on β-catenin-dependent modulation of EMT-related genes, and provided fresh insight into the mechanisms by which a FOXO3a-miR-34b/c axis restrains canonical β-catenin signaling cascades in prostate cancer cell.",

Cancer cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) have been shown to play roles in resistance to chemotherapy. Here, we utilized a proteomics-based method and identified a significant downregulation of the metastasis suppressor NDRG1 in drug resistant lung cancer cells. We showed that downregulation of DNRG1 constitutes a mechanism for acquisition of EMT phenotype and endows lung cancer cells with an increased resistance to cisplatin. We also identified a signal cascade, namely, SET--| PP2A--| c-myc--| NDRG1, in which upregulation of SET is critical for inhibition of NDRG1. We also found that blockade of SET (or reactivation of PP2A) by FTY720 reverted EMT, restored drug sensitivity, and inhibited invasiveness and growth of lung tumor xenografts. Together, our results indicated a functional link between SET-mediated NDRG1 regulation and acquisition of EMT phenotype and drug resistance, and provided an evidence that blockade of SET-driven EMT can overcome drug resistance and inhibit tumor progression.",

        "abstract": "In order to achieve effective and efficient characterization of phenolic acids in Danshen,the negative ion electrospay ionization tandem mass spectrometry(ESI-MSn) experiment was applied to investigate the structures and discuss the fragmentation pathway of phenolic acids.It was found that the ion fragment of-was the characteristic fragment for the monomer danshensu and caffeic acid.The danshensu was more inclined to lose neutral fragment CO2 comparing with caffeic acid.The dimers not only kept the fragmentation pathway of their monomers,but also had their own special fragmentation pathway.Ion-was the characteristic ion for salvianolic acid A and rosmarinic acid.The fragmentation behavior of rosmarinic acid also demonstrated that the loss of danshensu was much easier than the loss of caffeic acid.The conjugate structure of salvianolic acid F led to the preference of losing fragment CO2.As to lithospermic acid,the special pathway was the neutral loss of CO2 in the MS2 and further neutral loss of danshensu in MS3.The oligomer salvianolic acid B experienced a rearrangement during ESI-MS/MS experiment to achieve a conjugate structure.All these unusual neutral losses showed that the negative ion mode was a powerful tool for analysis of phenolic acids from Danshen.",

        "abstract": "We herein report a novel strategy for the removal of heavy metals and the subsequent preparation of a metal ceramic for immobilizing enzymes. To demonstrate this concept, Ni2+ ions were removed from an aqueous solution via entrapment by chitosan nanoparticles, and the resulting Ni(II)-containing precipitate was mixed with the ceramic matrix to give the Ni-doped ceramic (Ni-CP), which was subsequently applied in lipase immobilization. Under optimized conditions, Ni2+ removal reached 99.4%, and the Ni-CP showed significant chelation towards lipase following immobilization. In addition, a lipase activity yield of 164% was obtained under optimal conditions. Furthermore, the thermal and storage stabilities of Ni-CP-lipase exhibited a wider applied range, and the Ni-CP reusability was maintained at 97.5% following 20 cycles, suggesting high stability and excellent recyclability. Hence, the entrapped Ni2+ exhibited improved stability, thus reducing leakage into the environment. Furthermore, the chelation between Ni2+ and lipase improved enzyme activity and stability, and thus, may be suitable for application in large-scale production. It is therefore expected that this novel approach for enzyme immobilization has the potential to serve as an important technique in the field of biocatalysis.",

        "abstract": "Self-assembly of peptides and amyloid fibrils offers an appealing approach for creating chiral nanostructures, which has promising applications in the fields of biology and materials science. Although numerous self-assembled chiral materials have been designed, the precise control of their twisting tendency and their handedness is still a challenge. Herein, we report the self-assembly of chiral nanostructures with precisely tailored architectures by changing the amino acid sequences of the peptides. We designed a series of self-assembling tripeptides bearing different ʟ-amino acid sequences. The peptide with ʟ-Phe-ʟ-Phe sequence preferred to self-assemble into left-handed nanohelices, while with ʟ-Phe-ʟ-Trp, right-handed nanohelices would be formed. Moreover, the diameter of the self-assembled nanohelices could be tailored by changing the terminal amino acids (His, Arg, Ser, Glu and Asp). Circular dichroism (CD) and molecular dynamics simulations (MDs) revealed that both of the right- and left-handed nanohelices formed by the tripeptides showed negative cotton effects in the peptide adsorption region, but exhibited nearly opposite CD cotton effects in the aromatic regions. These results indicated that the handedness of the self-assembled helical nanofibers was not only determined by the chirality of the peptide backbone, but also is closely related to the aromatic stacking, hydrogen bonding and steric interactions induced by the side chains. The findings deepen our understanding on the chiral self-assembly of peptide and offer opportunities for the creation of highly functional chiral nanomaterials.",

A novel magnetic catalyst, ZnFe1.65Ru0.35O4, was prepared via a simple alkali-coprecipitation method. The structure of the as-prepared catalyst was characterized, and its catalytic performance was investigated for aerobic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) under different reaction conditions. A high DFF yield of 93.5% was obtained for the reaction at 110 °C for 4 h in dry DMSO, whereas the maximum FDCA yield of 91.2% was achieved for the reaction at 130 °C for 16 h in H2O/DMSO (1:2, v/v). More importantly, a plausible reaction pathway was proposed for the aerobic oxidation of HMF into FDCA, with the rate-determining step determined through kinetic study. In addition, DFF or FDCA could be produced from fructose by sequentially using a magnetic solid acid (Fe3O4–RGO–SO3H) and ZnFe1.65Ru0.35O4. The dehydra...",

        "abstract": "The interior of the cell is tightly packed with various biological macromolecules, which affects physiological processes, especially protein folding process. To explore how macromolecular crowding may influence protein folding process, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was chosen as a model protein, and the unfolding process of ALP induced by GdnHCl was studied in the presence of crowding agents such as PEG 4000, Dextran 70 and Ficoll 70. The effect of macromolecular crowding on the denatured state of ALP was directly probed by measuring enzyme activities, fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism. From the results of circular dichroism, GdnHCl induced a biphasic change, suggesting that a three-state unfolding mechanism was involved in the denaturation process irrespective of the absence or presence of crowding agents. It was also found that crowding agents had a little impact on the unfolding process of ALP. The results of phase diagrams also demonstrated that the unfolding process of ALP induced by GdnHCl was three-state mechanism. Moreover, the results of fluorescence spectra demonstrated that with the increase of GdnHCl concentration, the structure of protein had changed, but existence of crowding agents can make protein structure more stable. Our results can provide valuable information for understanding the protein folding in vivo.",

In this study, we found that reduction in H3K27me2/3 caused by H3.1K27M, a mutation of H3 variants found in DIPG patients, dramatically attenuated the presence of 53BP1 foci and NHEJ repair capability in HDF cells. H3.1K27M cells showed increased rates of genomic insertions/deletions (In/Dels) and copy number variations (CNVs), as well as augmented p53-dependent apoptotic cells. We further showed that both hypo-H3K27me2/3 and H3.1K27M interacted with FANCD2, a central player to orchestrate DNA repair pathway choice. H3.1K27M triggered an accumulation of FANCD2 on chromatin, supporting the interaction between H3.1K27M and FANCD2. Most interestingly, knock-down of FANCD2 in H3.1K27M cells recovered the number of 53BP1 foci, NHEJ efficiency and apoptosis rate. Although these findings in HDF cells may differ from the case of endogenous H3.1K27M mutant regulation in the specific tumor context of DIPG, our results suggest a new model by which H3K27me2/3 facilitates NHEJ and the maintenance of genome stability.",

        "abstract": "Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes are limited in the field of oil-in-water emulsion treatment because the intrinsic hydrophobicity of PVDF can cause serious membrane fouling. Here, a superhydrophilic PVDF membrane (PVDF@PDA-GSH) was fabricated using a facile, versatile, mussel-inspired method. The pristine PVDF membrane was coated with dopamine under mild alkaline conditions by a dip-coating method, followed by addition of glutathione (GSH) via a simple reaction. GSH was successfully coated onto the membrane surface and confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX). Hierarchical surface structure and superhydrophilicity were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and contact angle (CA), respectively, giving the PVDF@PDA-GSH membrane excellent wettability and antifouling ability. The water flux of PVDF@PDA-GSH was several fold higher than conventional filtration membranes, and the oil rejection ratio was nearly 99%. The PVDF@PDA-GSH membrane also showed favorable reusability because the flux recovery ratio (FRR) remained above 90% after five cycles. In general, these results indicated that this modification might provide a good method for the fabrication of superhydrophilic PVDF membranes with good prospects for water filtration applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Functionalized silica nanoparticles with strong acidity and different hydrophobicity were successfully synthesized by an alkali co-condensation method. The structure of the hydrophobic solid acids were characterized, and the catalytic properties were investigated in fructose dehydration to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF). Experiment results indicated that catalyst hydrophobicity has a positive influence on both 5-HMF yield and selectivity. The highest yield of 5-HMF (87%) with full conversion of fructose was obtained when the most hydrophobic solid acid (SiNP-SO 3 H-C 16 ) was used as the catalyst. The reason can be interpreted as the hydrophobic groups in the silica nanoparticles can effectively isolate  SO 3 H groups with water molecules in the reaction system, and thus hinder the rehydration of 5-HMF, which is the main side-reaction in 5-HMF formation. Other important reaction parameters such as reaction medium, temperature, time and catalyst loading were also studied for fructose dehydration. Recycling and control experiments demonstrated the good reusability and stability of the functionalized silica nanoparticles. Furthermore, inulin was also used as a feedstock for 5-HMF production and gave a high 5-HMF yield of 65% in the catalysis of a moderate hydrophobic silica nanoparticle.",

The potential involvement of lncRNAs in TNBC progression remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrated that LINC01638 is highly expressed in TNBC tissues and cells. LINC01638 maintains the mesenchymal traits of TNBC cells, including an enriched epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature and cancer stem cell-like state. LINC01638 knockdown suppresses tumor proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. LINC01638 overexpression predicts a poor outcome of breast cancer patients. Mechanistically, LINC01638 interacts with c-Myc to prevent SPOP-mediated c-Myc ubiquitination and degradation. C-Myc transcriptionally enhances MTDH (metadherin) expression and subsequently activates Twist1 expression to induce EMT. Our findings describe LINC01638-mediated signal transduction and highlight the crucial role of LINC01638 in TNBC progression.",

        "abstract": "Black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) as a novel nanomaterial have many potential applications in biomedicine. However, the interaction of BPQDs with proteins and its biological effects and potential risks are still unclear. Mucin, which serves biologically as the physical barrier against foreign substances entering tissues, was chosen as a model substrate here for studying the adsorption-desorption behavior of BPQDs using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitor (QCM-D). We found that surface modification of BPQDs with polyethylene glycol-amine (PEG) reduces the quantum dots' adsorption rate but increases their adsorbed amount on the mucin surface. The pH value, ionic strength, and ionic valence also had significant effects on the adsorption behavior of BPQDs. Upon increasing pH from 2 to 7, the amount of BPQD adsorption decreased from 14.1 to 3.2 ng/cm2. A high ionic strength and ionic valence (e.g., Mg2+, Al3+) also inhibit the surface adsorption of BPQDs. Furthermore, the adsorption-desorption mechanisms of BPQDs on mucin surface were proposed. The adsorption-desorption behavior under different conditions may be attributed to the steric hindrance of PEG, the electrostatic interaction, and/or charge screening. These findings provide useful insights into the interfacial behavior of BPQDs before they enter the tissues.",

        "abstract": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which are a unique class of hybrid porous materials built from metal ions and organic ligands, have attracted significant interest in recent years as a promising platform for controlled drug delivery. Current approaches for creating MOFs-based responsive drug carriers involve encapsulation of stimuli-responsive compositions into MOFs or post-synthetic surface modification with sensitive molecules. In this study, we developed a novel intrinsic redox-responsive MOFs carrier, MOF-M(DTBA) (M= Fe, Al or Zr) by using iron, aluminum or zirconium as metal nodes and 4,4'-dithiobisbenzoic acid (4,4'-DTBA) as the organic ligand. The disulfide bond in 4,4'-DTBA is cleavable by glutathione (GSH), which is often overexpressed in tumor cells. It was found that MOF-Zr(DTBA) synthesized at 40 °C displayed appropriate size and properties as a drug carrier. By incorporating curcumin (CCM) into MOF-Zr(DTBA), CCM@MOF-Zr(DTBA) nanoparticles were obtained that displayed faster releasing behavior in vitro and enhanced cell death compared to free CCM. The in vivo anticancer experiments indicate that CCM@ MOF-Zr(DTBA) exhibit much higher antitumor efficacy than free CCM. This strategy for constructing responsive MOFs-based nanocarriers might open new possibilities for the application of MOFs in drug delivery, molecular imaging or theranostics.",

As expected, the total cells sediment from isolation of the fed-batch culture was permeabilized completely by distilled ethanol from broth supernatant. More amazedly, the specific activity of β-galactosidase product by spray drying the permeabilized cells reached 2.61U/mg, meeting the demand of commercial products. Furthermore, the ethanol product at 33.8% (v/v) was obtained from the novel integrated process, which could be applied for various applications.

The peptide exhibits a structural transition from an antiparallel β-sheet to a random coil upon photo-irradiation, leading to the assembly/disassembly of the peptide fibril. An enhanced catalytic activity on p-nitrophenyl acetate was observed due to the proximity effect of the histidine residues and the hydrophobic microenvironment in the supramolecular assemblies. Under UV irradiation, this supramolecular system was destroyed together with a decline in the catalytic activity. Based on these photo-responsive properties, the activity of the hydrolase mimic can be reversibly controlled using UV and visible light.

The activity of cellulase remained constant upon low-power ultrasound treatment ( 280 W). Oscillating cellulase adsorption occurred upon ultrasound treatment with any intensity. The maxima for desorption and adsorption were 41.9 and 83.1%, respectively, during 1 h of 90 W ultrasound treatment at 50 °C. A comparison between the short-time with long-time ultrasound experiments indicated that ultrasound treatment tended to desorb cellulase from substrate. However, ultrasound treatment also led to further surface erosion of biomass, which increased cellulase accessibility. These joint actions of ultrasound treatment induced the oscillating adsorption of cellulase. The increase in cellulase accessibility caused by ultrasound treatment led to a significant enhancement in lignocellulose hydrolysis.",

        "abstract": "This study presents a facile, rapid and effective method for the fabrication of optical fiber surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors via polydopamine (PDA)-accelerated electroless plating (ELP). The bioinspired PDA coating formed through the facile self-polymerization of dopamine (DA) was utilized as a versatile material for optic-fiber functionalization. Gold seeds were then rapidly and firmly adsorbed onto the PDA functional layer by amino and imino intermediates generated during the polymerization, and a gold film sensor was fabricated after metal deposition. The fabrication time of the sensor was decreased by 6–12 times, and the fabricated sensor exhibited higher sensitivity, better reproducibility and adhesion stability compared with those fabricated by the traditional ELP. Some key experimental parameters, including DA polymerization temperature, DA polymerization time, and plating time, were investigated in detail. The optimized sample exhibited high sensitivity ranging from 1391 nm per RIU to 5346 nm per RIU in the refractive index range of 1.328 to 1.386. Scanning electron microscopy images indicated that the sensor surface consisted of gold nanoparticles with a uniform particle size and an orderly arrangement, and the film thickness was approximately 60 nm. Another PDA layer was formed on the gold film for facile immobilization of antibodies. The sensor exhibited effective antibody immobilization ability and high sensitivity for human IgG detection over a wide range of concentrations from 0.5 to 40 μg mL−1, which indicate the potential applications of the fabricated sensor in immunoassays.",

        "abstract": "We herein report a facile, one-step pyrolysis synthesis of photoluminescent carbon dots (CDs) using citric acid as the carbon source and lysine as the surface passivation reagent. The as-prepared CDs show narrow size distribution, excellent blue fluorescence and good photo-stability and water dispersivity. The fluorescence of the CDs was found to be effectively quenched by ferric (Fe(III)) ions with high selectivity via a photo-induced electron transfer (PET) process. Upon addition of phytic acid (PA) to the CDs/Fe(III) complex dispersion, the fluorescence of the CDs was significantly recovered, arising from the release of Fe(III) ions from the CDs/Fe(III) complex because PA has a higher affinity for Fe(III) ions compared to CDs. Furthermore, we developed an \"off-on\" fluorescence assay method for the detection of phytic acid using CDs/Fe(III) as a fluorescent probe. This probe enables the selective detection of PA with a linear range of 0.68-18.69μM and a limit of detection (signal-to-noise ratio is 3) of 0.36μM. The assay method demonstrates high selectivity, repeatability, stability and recovery ratio in the detection of the standard and real PA samples. We believe that the facile operation, low-cost, high sensitivity and selectivity render this CD-based \"off-on\" fluorescent probe an ideal sensing platform for the detection of PA.",

        "abstract": "Alcohol intake increases the risk of cancer development. Approximately 3.6% human cancers worldwide derive from chronic alcohol drinking, including oral, liver, breast and other organs. Our studies in vivo and in vitro have demonstrated that diluted ethanol increase RNA Pol III gene transcription and promotes cell proliferation and transformation, as well as tumor formation. However, it is unclear about the effect of red wines on the human cancer cells. In present study, we investigated the roles of red wine in human cancer cell growth, colony formation and RNA Pol III gene transcription. Low concentration (12.5 mM to 25 mM) of ethanol enhances cell proliferation of breast and esophageal cancer lines, whereas its higher concentration (100 mM to 200 mM) slightly decreases the rates. In contrast, red wines significantly repress cell proliferation of different human cancer lines from low dose to high dose. The results reveal that the red wine also inhibits colony formation of human breast cancer and esophageal carcinoma cells. The effects of repression on different human cancer lines are in a dose-dependent manner. Further analysis indicates that ethanol increases RNA Pol III gene transcription, whereas the red wines significantly reduce transcription of the genes. Interestingly, the effects of mature wine (brick red) on cancer cell phenotypes are much stronger than young wine (intense violet). Together, these new findings suggest that red wines may contain some bioactive components, which are able to inhibit human cancer cell growth and colony formation.",

Here, we found that stably enhanced 14-3-3σ expression strengthened the effects of 5-Fu, Mitoxantrone and cDDP. 14-3-3σ stabilised the p53 protein and bound Akt to inhibit its activity and its downstream targets: survivin, Bcl-2 and NF-κB-p50. In addition, decreased p53 expression, but not promoter hypermethylation, was responsible for the downregulation of 14-3-3σ in MCF-7/5-Fu cells. Meanwhile, initial treatments with high concentrations of 5-Fu clearly induced 14-3-3σ and p53 expression in a time-dependent manner. 14-3-3σ-mediated molecular events that synergise with p53 may play important roles in the chemotherapy of breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "To investigate transduction mechanism on carboxyl terminal activating region 3 of Epstein - Barr virus encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells NP69, the NP69 cell lines were respectively infected, applied the approach of retroviruses infection, by RV-LMP1 and RV-LMPlΔ252-351 retroviruses. Therefore, the NP69-LMP1 and NP69-LMP1Δ252-351 cell lines of stable expression LMP1 were established. Sequentially, cellular proliferation of the NP69-LMP1 and NP69-LMPlΔ252-351 cell lines was compared to draw growth curve, experiment plate clone formation and test soft agar colony forming. Meanwhile, adopted proteomic methods, the differential expression proteins were identified between NP69-LMPland NP69-LMP1Δ252-351 cell lines, and the expression levels of partial identified proteins were verified by Western blotting and fluorescent real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed: 1) the ability of LMPlΔ252-351 promoting NP69 cell proliferation was obviously decreased to compare with wild type LMP1 (n=3, P<0.05). 2) 16 proteins, 8 up- and 8 down-regulated ones, of LMP1-CTAR3 mediated regulation were identified from infected NP69 cell lines. 3) The differential expression of partial identified proteins was similar with 2-DE separated ones and confirmed by Western blotting and fluorescent real-time quantitative RT-PCR. These results suggested that LMP1-CTAR3 is the important activating domain of inducing cellular proliferation and the domain probably plays the role of mediating to regulate the expression of G-protein, isocitric enzyme, and so on.",

        "abstract": "Approximately 3.6% human cancers worldwide derive from chronic alcohol drinking, including cancers of breast and multiple other organs. Alcohol intake is consistently associated with an increased risk of BC (breast cancer). Alcohol consumption is more pronounced in ER+ BC cases than in ER- cases. However, the molecular mechanism remains to be determined. RNA polymerase (Pol) III genes, such as 5S rRNA and tRNAs, are elevated in both transformed and tumor cells. Brf1 (TFIIIB-related factor 1), a subunit of TFIIIB complex, specifically regulates Pol III gene transcription. Our studies have demonstrated that Brf1 expression and Pol III gene transcription are increased in alcohol-induced mice liver tumor. Alcohol-induced deregulation of Pol III gene transcription may be fundamental to the development of BC. We have found that alcohol-increased Pol III gene transcription in ER+ BC cells is significantly higher than in ER- normal breast cells and BC cells. The induction is ER dependent. The cellular levels of Brf1 protein and mRNA are increased in ethanol-treated MCF-7 cells. Ethanol markedly stimulates phosphorylation of MSK1 (MSK1ph) and histone H3 (H3ph). Our previous studies demonstrated that MSK1 mediates H3ph. MSK1 mediates ERα expression. Inhibition of MSK1 signal reduces alcohol-induced ERα expression to decrease cellular level of Brf1 and Pol III genes. Repression of Brf1 expression decreases alcohol-induced anchorage-independent cell growth and tumor formation. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that ethanol treatment increases occupancy of ERα to Brf1 promoter. The results by using Co-IP and ChIP assays indicate that MSK1, ERα and Brf1 form a complex to mediate Pol III gene transcription. Studies of human biopsies of BC patients indicate that Brf1 expression is increased in human cases of BC. High expression of Brf1 displays longer overall survival period after Tamoxifen treatment. Co-localization analysis indicate that MSK1ph and H3S10ph localizes in nuclear with Brf1. These results support the idea that alcohol activates MSK1 and induces epigenetic modification of H3ph to enhance ERα and Brf1 expression and Pol III gene transcription, resulting greater phenotypic changes. Together, our studies indicate that ethanol-induced epigenetic modification of H3ph may play a critical role in alcohol-induced cell transformation and alcohol-associated ER+ BC.

Herein, we report a facile and universal strategy for enzyme immobilization using highly stable hierarchically porous metal-organic frameworks (HP-MOFs). The HP-MOFs were stable over a wide pH range (pH = 2-11 for HP-DUT-5) and met the catalysis conditions of most enzymes. The as-prepared hierarchical micro/mesoporous MOFs with mesoporous defects showed a superior adsorption capacity towards enzymes. The maximum adsorption capacity of HP-DUT-5 for glucose oxidase (GOx) and uricase was 208 mg g and 225 mg g, respectively. Furthermore, we constructed two multi-enzyme biosensors for glucose and uric acid (UA) by immobilizing GOx and uricase with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) on HP-DUT-5, respectively. These sensors were efficiently applied in the colorimetric detection of glucose and UA and showed good sensitivity, selectivity, and recyclability.",

The catalytic activities of f-Ce10-xMoxOδ depended on their structure and physicochemical properties, which were closely related to their elementary compositions. The f-Ce9Mo1Oδ, which possesses polymeric octahedral MoOz species, the highest Oα ratio, BET surface area, and acidity density, exhibited the highest catalytic activity for DFF production. High DFF yields of 94% and 74% were obtained from f-Ce9Mo1Oδ catalyzed HMF oxidation and “one-pot” fructose conversion, respectively. Furthermore, f-Ce9Mo1Oδ is easily prepared, has low cost, and is ecofriendly, which has potential application in industrial production of DFF from fructose.",

During the degradation process, the molecular weight of the enzymatic products decreases with reaction time, while the molecular weight distribution (MWD) broadens at first and then becomes narrow. According to the reaction mechanism, there are four factors which could cause the above variations of MWD: the sparsely inlaid distribution of enzyme molecules in KGM solutions, the maldistribution of mannose and glucose units on the KGM backbone, the different pathways for enzymatic cleavage of KGM and the binding pattern between enzyme and KGM. In addition, based on the Michaelis-Menton equation and the changes in the weight-average molecular weight of hydrolystates M w, a kinetic model was established to simulate the hydrolysis process, and it was demonstrated in good agreement with the experimental results. The inverse relationship between the reaction rate constant k and the concentration of polymer suggests that, for frequently-used polysaccharide concentration, the enzymatic hydrolysis is a zero-order reaction.",

For the synthesis of GOS, ethanol-permeabilized cells (p-cells) of K. lactis were used because the enhanced permeability facilitated the mass transfer of the substrate and the release of oligosaccharide products. For the purification of GOS, non-permeabilized K. lactis cells (np-cells) were preferred as a result of their intrinsic cell membrane barrier toward GOS, which led to the selective consumption of carbohydrate. In this way, undesired glucose, galactose, and lactose in the raw GOS solution can be completely removed. This strategy is recyclable not only because of the high stability and reusability of p-cells and np-cells but also because the ethanol, which is simultaneously generated during the purification, can be reused for the preparation of p-cells. The strategy proposed in this study is a promising candidate for the efficient production of high-purity GOS. ",

        "abstract": "Controlling the self-assembly of diphenylalanine peptide (FF) into various nanoarchitectures has received great amounts of attention in recent years. Here, we report the temperature-induced reversible self-assembly of diphenylalanine peptide to microtubes, nanowires, or organogel in different solvents. We also find that the organogel in isopropanol transforms into crystalline flakes or nanowires when the temperature increases. The reversible self-assembly in polar solvents may be mainly controlled by electronic and aromatic interactions between the FF molecules themselves, which is associated with the dissociation equilibrium and significantly influenced by temperature. We found that the organogel in the isopropanol solvent made a unique transition to crystalline structures, a process that is driven by temperature and may be kinetically controlled. During the heating-cooling process, FF preferentially self-assembles to metastable nanofibers and organogel. They further transform to thermodynamically stable crystal structures via molecular rearrangement after introducing an external energy, such as the increasing temperature used in this study. The strategy demonstrated in this study provides an efficient way to controllably fabricate smart, temperature-responsive peptide nanomaterials and enriches the understanding of the growth mechanism of diphenylalanine peptide nanostructures.",

This study investigates the role of lncRNA growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) in tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer. A microarray of lncRNAs was screened in tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7R cells and the parental, non-resistant MCF-7 cells. Downregulation of lncRNA GAS5 was found in MCF-7R cells. Besides, decreased expression of GAS5 was found in breast cancer tissues, which was associated with advanced TNM stage and shorter overall survival time. We further found that GAS5 overexpression enhanced cell sensitivity to tamoxifen in MCF-7R cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, GAS5 increased sensitivity of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen by serving as a molecular sponge for miR-222, contributing to suppression of phosphatase and tensin homologs (PTEN) (one endogenous target of miR-222). Collectively, our study demonstrates that GAS5 enhances the efficacy of tamoxifen in the treatment of breast cancer and could be a novel prognostic biomarker.",

Methods: Monofactorial experiments were employed to examine the effects of the substrate size, enzyme consumption, ratio of solid to liquid, 1st enzymatic extraction time, and 2nd water extraction time on the extraction of S. mitiorrhiza. Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry was used to analyze the results and Danshensu extraction rate was regarded as standard. Results: The data showed that the highest Danshensu extraction rate (84.61%) could be achieved at: t= 50 °C, pH = 4.6, granularity = 20 - 35 meshes, E-S = 1: 200, 1st enzymatic extraction time = 80 min, S-L = 1: 15, 2nd water extraction time = 40 min S-L = 1:9. Conclusion: This process could be conducted under mild conditions and in relatively simple equipment, which could help reduce energy cost, alleviate gelatinization, and lower the possibility of product oxidation, and thus it is considerably feasible.",

Lately, we found a novel human gene named tongue cancer chemotherapy resistance-associated protein1 (TCRP1) in the tongue cancer multi-drug resistance cell line (Tca8113/PYM) established by us. In this study, we focus on recombinant expression, purification, and biochemical characterization of TCRP1. After molecular cloning and purification of the gene encoding the 24-kDa protein, a mouse polyclonal antibody against TCRP1 was prepared, and the specialty of the antibody was confirmed by Western blot. The cell proliferation was evaluated by MTS assay and DNA damage was determined by comet assay, the results indicated that this protein especially mediated the cell's resistance to cisplatin; it was associated with its role of providing protection against DNA damage. We also found that TCRP1 expression was increased in cisplatin-resistant carcinoma cell lines (Tca/PYM and A549/DDP), but not in cisplatin-sensitive MDR cell lines (MCF-7/5-Fu), compared with their parental counterparts by Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analysis showed TCRP1 is mainly expression in cytoplasmic, the Mann-Whitney U test exhibited that TCRP1 positive patients predicted the worst sensitive with cisplatin of OSCC patients. All these findings suggest that TCRP1 is a novel cisplatin-resistant protein which is mainly localized in the cytoplasm and can mediate cisplatin resistance against DNA damage; the expression level of TCRP1 in patients with OSCC may be useful as an indicator of therapeutic efficacy of the sensitivity to cisplatin.",

Under low-energy collisionally-activated decomposition (CAD), the protonated cyclic peptides mainly dissociate via ring opening pathways and the corresponding bn → bn-1 pathways to form several sets of b ions as oxazolone rings (and b1 ions as aziridinone rings). Through repeated observation of these b ions in multistep CAD experiments, accurate sequencing and head-to-tail ring structure of cyclic peptides can be determined. The mistaken assignments of these b ions can be avoided by this sequencing method. Semi-empirical molecular orbital calculations have been utilized to provide insight into the proposed dissociation mechanism. In addition, for cyclic peptides that include an Asn residue, the nitrogen of the Asn side chain is observed to be preferentially protonated, which can induce a unique ring-opening pathway with a loss of ammonia that competes with the conventional ring opening pathway. © IM Publications 2006.",

In this study, we investigated the activating sites and functionary mechanism of LMP1.We recombined a deletion mutant type LMP1 (LMP1Delta232-351), deleted the amino acid residues including 232-351 codons in carboxyl terminal activating region-3 by PCR. Then we compared mutant type LMP1Delta232-351 with wild type LMP1 (LMP1WT) to alter biological effect in Nasopharyngeal Epithelial Cell line NP69. Moreover, we constructed a Janus Kinase 3 (JKA3) promoter luciferase reporter system (pGL-2/JAK3-LUC). We respectively cotransfected the LMP1Delta232-351 and LMP1WT with promoter including NF-kappaB binding sequence or JAK3 promoter luciferase reporter into 293 cells (controlled with pLNSX vector), and compared their actions to activating promoters by results of luciferase activity assay.(1) The colony forming number (CFN) of NP69-LMP1Delta232-351 cells significantly decreased to compare with CFN of NP69-LMP1WT (n=3, p<0.01). (2) LMP1WT was able to up-regulate the transcription activity of JAK3 promoter and the level of up-regulation was correlated with its concentration in Human embryonic kidney 293 cell line; while LMP1Delta232-351 was almost defective ability to activate the promoter.The carboxyl terminal activating region-3 may be one of the most important function sites of LMP1, which involved in activating the JAK3 promoter and regulating the expression of JAK3 protein.",

        "abstract": "Survivin (coding gene BIRC5) is a dual functional protein acting as a critical inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) and key regulator of cell cycle progression. It is usually produced in embryonic tissues during development and undetectable in most adult tissues. Overexpression of Survivin frequently occurs in various human cancers and increased Survivin correlates with poor clinic outcome, tumor recurrence, and therapeutic resistance. Because of its selective expression in tumor, but not normal tissues, Survivin has been recognized as an attractive target for cancer treatment. Although several therapeutic approaches targeting Survivin are actively under clinical trials in human cancers, to date no Survivin-targeted therapy has been approved for cancer treatment. Numerous studies have devoted to uncovering the underlying mechanism resulting in Survivin dysregulation at multiple levels, such as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. The current article provides a literature review on the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of Survivin expression in human cancers. We focus on the impact of DNA methylation and histone modifications, including specific lysine methylation, demethylation, and acetylation on the expression of Survivin. The latest development of epigenetic approaches targeting Survivin for cancer treatment are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "We report that the helical coiling of micelles induced by disulfide crosslinking in a lyotropic peptide liquid crystal leads to the formation of a printable hydrogel. The (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl)-protected phenylalanine–phenylalanine–cysteine tripeptide could firstly self-assemble into aligned micelles at high pH values via noncovalent interactions, leading to the formation of a viscous solution. Intriguingly, the cross-linking of the sulfhydryl group between the peptides changed greatly the rheological properties of the peptide solutions, leading to a 6500-fold increase of the storage modulus to 39 kPa. This led to the formation of a self-supporting peptide hydrogel with a series of improved physical properties, including shear-thinning and thixotropy. The formation of the peptide hydrogels with enhanced physical properties can be attributed to the structural transition of the parallelly aligned worm-like micelles into coiled nanohelices induced by the cross-linking of disulfide bonding. The findings deepen our understanding on the relationship between micelle chirality and gel properties, and provide a strategy to fabricate highly functional materials via simultaneous noncovalent and covalent polymerizations.",

        "abstract": "Recycling of cellulases is an effective way to reduce the cost of enzymatic hydrolysis for the production of cellulosic ethanol. In this study, we examined the adsorption and desorption behaviors of cellulase at different pH values and temperatures. Furthermore, we developed a promising way to recover both free and bound cellulases by pH-triggered adsorption-desorption. The results show that acidic pH (e.g., pH 4.8) was found to favor adsorption, whereas alkaline pH (e.g., pH 10) and low temperature (4-37 °C) favored desorption. The adsorption of cellulases reached an equilibrium within 60 min at pH 4.8 and 25 °C, leading to approximately 50 % of the added cellulases bound to the substrate. By controlling the pH of eluent (citrate buffer, 25 °C), we were able to increase the desorption efficiency of bound cellulases from 15 % at pH 4.8 to 85 % at pH 10. To recover cellulases after enzymatic hydrolysis, we employed adsorption by fresh substrate and desorption at pH 10 to recover the free cellulases in supernatant and the bound cellulases in residue, respectively. The recycling performance (based on the glucose yield) of this simple strategy could reach near 80 %. Our results provided a simple, low-cost, and effective approach for cellulase recycling during the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass.",

It is observed that the boundaries suppress the growth of coherence of both the whole system and the position subsystem. The coherence of the quantum walk with a 2D coin is larger than that of the quantum walk with a 4D coin when it stabilizes after a number of steps. We also analyze the influence of two kinds of noise, i.e., broken links and lattice congestion, on the coherence of a bounded quantum walk. Experimental results show that both the broken links and the lattice congestion with low probability slightly increase the coherence of the whole system and the position subsystem. However, a high noise level significantly suppresses the growth of coherence, especially for static noise. The coherence of the coin subsystem is also analyzed and we find that the boundaries result in a large fluctuation of coherence of the coin subsystem.",

However, there usually exist some intelligent attackers who intend to have malicious samples to be mis-classified as legitimate at test time, i.e. evasion attack. Current researches show that traditional Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are vulnerable to evasion attacks as they do not consider the existence of an attack. In this paper, we propose to increase the robustness of SVMs against evasion attacks by adding random generated malicious samples to the training set. The experimental result on spam filtering shows that the proposed method can increase the true positive rate of SVMs under evasion attacks without significantly affecting the false positive rate.",

        "abstract": "Antifouling surfaces capable of reducing nonspecific protein adsorption from natural complex media are highly desirable in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors. A new protein-resistant surface made through the chemical grafting of easily available hyaluronic acid (HA) onto gold (Au) substrate demonstrates excellent antifouling performance against protein adsorption. AFM images showed the uniform HA layer with a thickness of ∼10.5 nm on the Au surface. The water contact angles of Au surfaces decreased from 103° to 12° with the covalent attachment of a carboxylated HA matrix, indicating its high hydrophilicity mainly resulted from carboxyl and amide groups in the HA chains. Using SPR spectroscopy to investigate nonspecific adsorption from single protein solutions (bovine serum albumin (BSA), lysozyme) and complex media (soybean milk, cow milk, orange juice) to an HA matrix, it was found that ultralow or low protein adsorptions of 0.6-16.1 ng/cm(2) (e.g., soybean milk: 0.6 ng/cm(2)) were achieved on HA-Au surfaces. Moreover, anti-BSA was chosen as a model recognition molecule to characterize the immobilization capacity and the antifouling performance of anti-BSA/HA surfaces. The results showed that anti-BSA/HA sensor surfaces have a high anti-BSA loading of 780 ng/cm(2), together with achieving the ultralow (<3 ng/cm(2) for lysozyme and soybean milk) or low (<17 ng/cm(2) for cow milk and 10% blood serum) protein adsorptions. Additionally, the sensor chips also exhibited a high sensitivity to BSA over a wide range of concentrations from 15 to 700 nM. Our results demonstrate a promising antifouling surface using extremely hydrophilic HA as matrix to resist nonspecific adsorption from complex media in SPR biosensors.",

The Fc-Y monomers can directly self-assemble into nanospheres with a smooth surface driven by noncovalent interactions. By covalent photo-crosslinking of the Fc-Y monomers, the nanospheres transform spontaneously into hollow vesicles composed of hierarchically ordered lamellar structures. It is worth noting that the formed nanostructures exhibit both reducing property for in situ mineralization of gold nanoparticles with tunable biocatalytic behavior, and the redox activity for superior energy storage capacity. The measured energy storage capacity is 31 mAh g for the nanospheres, which is the highest value reported so far for peptide assemblages as supercapacitor. The results offer insights into the dynamic self-assembly of highly ordered multifunctional materials with promising applications in catalysis, sensing, energy and biomedical fields.",

        "abstract": "Although aseptic nonunion of humeral diaphyseal fracture is rare, it often is debilitating for the patient. Treatment is challenging for the surgeon when nonunion occurs. The purpose of this study was to analyze and identify independent risk factors for aseptic nonunion among patients with humeral diaphyseal fracture undergoing surgical fixation.The medical records of all humeral diaphyseal fracture patients who underwent surgical fixation from January 2005 to January 2011 were reviewed to identify those who developed aseptic nonunion. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify independent associations of potential risk factors for aseptic nonunion among patients with surgical humeral diaphyseal fracture.A total of 686 patients were identified, with 659 meeting our inclusion criteria. Among these 659 cases there were 24 cases of septic nonunion, an incidence of 3.6%. The patients were followed for 9-24 months, with an average follow-up period of 14.8 months. In the final regression model, advanced age (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% CI: 1.03-1.14, P = 0.001), smoking (odds ratio, 5.34; 95% CI: 1.05-27.00, P = 0.043), use of NSAIDs (odds ratio, 2.51; 95% CI: 1.80-3.50, P < 0.001), and ASA score (odds ratio, 3.04; 95% CI: 1.06-8.74, P = 0.039) were risk factors for aseptic nonunion of humeral diaphyseal fracture after surgical fixation.This analysis confirms advanced age, smoking, use of NSAIDs, and ASA score were related to an increased risk of aseptic nonunion of humeral diaphyseal fracture after surgical fixation. Patients who have the risk factors identified in this study should be counseled about the possibility of aseptic nonunion occurring after surgical fixation.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) has been shown to confer multidrug resistance, but the mechanisms of its regulation are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effects of wild-type and mutant p53, and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) (p50) on BCRP promoter activity in MCF-7 cells. Our results demonstrated that wild-type p53 markedly suppressed BCRP activity and enhanced the chemosensitivity of cells to mitoxantrone, whereas mutant p53 had little inhibitory effect. After inhibition of NF-kappaB, similar results were obtained. Following knockdown of endogenous p53, BCRP and p50 expressions were increased, and the chemosensitivity of the cells to mitoxantrone was decreased. We conclude that wild-type p53 acts as a negative regulator of BCRP gene transcription.",

        "abstract": "2,5-Diformylfuran (2,5-DFF) is an important biomass chemical with broad application prospects. A vanadium pentoxide (V2O5)/ceramic powder catalyst (V-CP) was designed and synthesized in this study, and its structure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and specific surface area analysis (BET). The catalytic properties of the V-CP catalyst were evaluated. The results show that 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) can be completely converted to 2,5-DFF at 140 °C under atmospheric pressure in the presence of oxygen as the oxidant in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 5 h, and the yield of 2,5-DFF was 85.7%. After recycling the catalyst 5 times, the catalytic effect decreased slightly, and the catalyst showed good recovery performance. Furthermore, a one-pot method for the preparation of 2,5-DFF was proposed by using fructose as the raw material and V2O5/ceramic-dilute sulfuric acid as the catalyst. The fructose was dehydrated to form 5-HMF, and 2,5-DFF was generated by the V-CP catalytic oxidation of 5-HMF. The 2,5-DFF yield was 68.4%. The results of this study provide a valuable reference for the efficient one-pot synthesis of biomass-based furan chemicals.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Precise mitotic spindle assembly is a guarantee of proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Chromosome instability caused by disturbed mitosis is one of the major features of various types of cancer. JMJD5 has been reported to be involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the nucleus, but little is known about its function in mitotic process. Here we report the unexpected localization and function of JMJD5 in mitotic progression. JMJD5 partially accumulates on mitotic spindles during mitosis, and depletion of JMJD5 results in significant mitotic arrest, spindle assembly defects, and sustained activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Inactivating SAC can efficiently reverse the mitotic arrest caused by JMJD5 depletion. Moreover, JMJD5 is found to interact with tubulin proteins and associate with microtubules during mitosis. JMJD5-depleted cells show a significant reduction of α-tubulin acetylation level on mitotic spindles and fail to generate enough interkinetochore tension to satisfy the SAC. Further, JMJD5 depletion also increases the susceptibility of HeLa cells to the antimicrotubule agent. Taken together, these results suggest that JMJD5 plays an important role in regulating mitotic progression, probably by modulating the stability of spindle microtubules.",

On the basis of membrane separation and high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), standard peptides with different relative molecular mass ranges were prepared, and the linear relationships between mass concentration of the standard peptides and the corresponding peak areas were established. Consequently, mass concentration of the different hydrolysates at different reaction time can be accurately calculated.

Tannic acid, as a typical plant polyphenol from oak wood, was first grafted onto ESM fibers to serve as both the reductant and the stabilizer during the synthesis of AgNPs. The morphology, constitution, and thermal stability of the resulting AgNPs@Tan-ESM composites were fully characterized to explain the excellent catalytic efficiency of AgNPs@Tan-ESM composites. These composite catalysts were applied to the degradation of azo dyes which exhibited the high catalytic activity toward Congo red and methyl orange according to the kinetic curves. More importantly, they can be easily recovered and reused for many times because of their good stability.",

        "abstract": "In this study, an artificial hydrolase was developed by combining the catalytic Ser/His/Asp triad with N-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl diphenylalanine (Fmoc-FF), followed by coassembly of the peptides into nanofibers (CoA-HSD). The peptide-based nanofibers provide an ideal supramolecular framework to support the functional groups. Compared with the self-assembled catalytic nanofibers (SA-H), which contain only the catalytic histidine residue, the highest activity of CoA-HSD occurs when histidine, serine, and aspartate residues are at a ratio of 40:1:1. This indicates that the well-ordered nanofiber structure and the synergistic effects of serine and aspartate residues contribute to the enhancement in activity. Additionally, for the first time, molecular imprinting was applied to further enhance the activity of the peptide-based artificial enzyme (CoA-HSD). p-NPA was used as the molecular template to arrange the catalytic Ser/His/Asp triad residues in the proper orientation. As a result, the activity of imprinted coassembled CoA-HSD nanofibers is 7.86 times greater than that of nonimprinted CoA-HSD and 13.48 times that of SA-H. ",

After treatment with glutaraldehyde as a crosslinking agent, we can obtain novel Fmoc-FFH/PEI/GA hybrid capsules (FPGCs). The FPGCs with imidazolyl groups as the catalytic centers exhibit high catalytic activity for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA). The resulting hydrolase model (FPCs or FPGCs) shows kinetics behavior typical of natural enzymes, and the catalytic activity is higher than that of a Fmoc-FFH hydrogel. The enhanced catalytic activity may be attributed to the high density of catalytic sites on the inner surface of the hybrid capsule. Additionally, the FPGCs retained 93% of their productivity after fifteen cycles, suggesting high stability and excellent recyclability. This novel hybrid capsule is expected to be applied as a substitute for natural hydrolases in industrial production applications.",

There are few studies on the relationship between LMP1 and normal epithelial cell. So this study was designed to evaluate the effect of EBV LMP1 on cell transformation in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell and its mechanism.Retrovirus expression vectors (LMP1 and LMP1+hTERT) were transfected into HBE cells and selected with the appropriate drugs to get resistant cells. The biological characteristics were studied by cell growth curve, colony formation analysis, and the determination of telomerase activity and protein expression of Cyclin A, p21, and CDK4.wt-LMP1 together with hTERT gene transfected cells grew rapidly than HBE/wt-LMP1 cells. Soft agar plating rates of HBE/wt-LMP1-hTERT, HBE/wt-LMP1, and HBE/pLNSX+pBabe were 22.98%, 16.94%, and 8.85%, respectively. The activities of telomerase were 2.825, 2.441, and 1.876, respectively. In addition, there was no difference of protein expression of CDK4 among these groups. However, HBE/wt-LMP1-hTERT and HBE/wt-LMP1 cells had low-level p21 and high-level cyclin A protein expression than the vector groups.The results suggest that LMP1 is in tandem with hTERT in promoting cell proliferation and transformation through modulating expression level of cyclin A and p21 protein.",

Predication of the backflushing efficiency poses a complex non-linear problem as the system integrates enzymatic hydrolysis, membrane separation and periodic backflushing together. In this paper an alternative artificial neural network approach is developed to predict the backflushing efficiency as a function of duration and interval. A contour plot of backflushing performance is presented to model these effects, and the backflushing conditions have been optimized as duration of 10 s and interval of 10 min using this neural network. Also, simple neural networks are established to predict the time evolution of flux before and after backflushing. The results predicted by the models are in good agreement with the experimental data, and the average deviations for all the cases are well within ±5%. The neural network approach is found to be capable of modeling the backflushing with confidence.",

After total RNA was extracted, the heavy chain Fd and k/λ light chain were amplified by RT-PCR. Following restrictive digestion with Sac I/Xba I and Xho I/Spe I, the light chain k/λ genes and heavy chain genes Fd were inserted into the phagemid vector pComb3 successively and then electroporated into E.coil XL1-Blue.The humanized Fab phage antibody library against HER2 ECD was constructed by infection of helper phage VCSM13.The libraries were enrich after panned three cycles by purification protein of recombinant HER2 ECD.Then random clones were tested by ELISA to select the positive ones, which were furher identified their antigen binding acticities by Western blot, and the strongest binding to HER2 ECD clone was sequenced.The Fab phage antibody library with 2.5 x 10(7) volume was constructed and four positive clones which specifically recognized the HER2 ECD were isolated and further demonstrated by Western blot. Sequence analysis of the positivest clone showed that the variable heavy domains(VH) and variable light domains(VL) were highly homologous with the human embryonal Ig heavy chain V region sequences and kappa light chain sequences, respectively.A fully humanized Fab phage antibody library is successfully constructed and specific antibodies against HER2 ECD are obtained, which provides an experimental foundation for new humanized anti-HER2 ECD monoclonal antibodies.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed tumor type and the primary leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide and multidrug resistance is the major obstacle for breast cancer treatment improvement. Emerging evidence suggests that metformin, the most widely used antidiabetic drug, resensitizes and cooperates with some anticancer drugs to exert anticancer effect. However, there are no data regarding the reversal effect of metformin on chemoresistance in breast cancer. In the present study, we investigated the resistance reversal effect of metformin on acquired multidrug-resistant breast cancer cells MCF-7/5-Fu derived from MCF-7 breast cancer cells and innate multidrug-resistant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, and we found that metformin resensitized MCF7/5-FU and MDA-MB-231 to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), adriamycin, and paclitaxel. We also observed that metformin reversed epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and decreased the invasive capacity of MCF7/5-FU and MDA-MB-231 cells. However, there were no significant changes upon metformin-treated MCF7 cells. Moreover, we found metformin treatment activated AMPK signal pathway in MCF7/5-FU and MDA-MB-231 cells and compound C, the AMPK inhibitor, could partly abolish the resensitization and EMT reversal effect of metformin. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report that metformin can resensitize multidrug-resistant breast cancer cells due to activating AMPK signal pathway. Our study will help elucidate the mechanism of chemoresistance and establish new strategies of chemotherapy for human breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Chemoresistance is a major obstacle in successfully treating cancers, and the mechanisms responsible for drug resistance are still far from understood. Carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) has been shown to be upregulated in the drug-resistant tongue cancer cell line Tca8113/PYM and to be associated with drug resistance. However, the mechanisms regulating CA9 expression and its role in drug resistance remain unclear.Bioinformatic and experimental analysis involving ChIP and luciferase reporter assays were used to validate Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) as a transcriptional regulator of CA9. Gene expression and protein levels were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Sensitivity to chemotherapy was examined using the MTS assay and Hoechst staining and analysis caspase-3 activity to evaluate changes in apoptosis. Intracellular pH (pHi) was measured using fluorescent pH-indicator BCECF-AM. Protein expression in patient tissue samples was examined by immunohistochemistry and survival of tongue cancer patients from which these samples were derived was also analyzed.ZEB1 bound to the promoter of CA9 to positively regulate CA9 expression in tongue cancer cells. Knockdown of CA9 using short interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the chemoresistance resulting from ZEB1 overexpression in Tca8113 and SCC-25 cells, and CA9 overexpression attenuated chemosensitivity induced by ZEB1 knockdown in Tca8113/PYM cells. CA9 knockdown also prevented maintenance of pHi mediated by overexpression of ZEB1 in Tca8113 and SCC-25 cells following chemotherapy, associated with increased apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. Conversely, ectopic expression of CA9 suppressed decrease in pHi mediated by ZEB1 knockdown in Tca8113/PYM cells following chemotherapy, accompanied by decreased apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. Importantly, a positive correlation was observed between ZEB1 and CA9 protein expression in tongue cancer tissues, and expression of these proteins associated with a poor prognosis for patients.Our finding that tumor cells regulate pHi in response to chemotherapy provides new insights into mechanisms of drug resistance during cancer treatment. Identification of the ZEB1-CA9 signaling axis as a biomarker of poor prognosis in tongue cancer will be valuable in future development of therapeutic strategies aimed at improving treatment efficacy, especially in terms of drug resistance associated with this disease.",

        "title": "TCRP1 expression is associated with platinum sensitivity in human lung and ovarian cancer cells.",
        "abstract": "Platinum-based drugs, including cisplatin (DDP) and oxaliplatin (L-OHP), are among the most potent chemotherapy drugs, and are widely utilized for the treatment of human lung and ovarian cancer. However, certain patients do not respond to platinum-based agents, and even those who initially benefit from the treatment will eventually exhibit resistance to these drugs. Although certain factors have been investigated for their potential to predict platinum resistance, more effective predictors for the improved management of patients with lung and ovarian cancer are required. Tongue cancer resistance-associated protein 1 (TCRP1) is a newly identified gene, which was cloned from a multi-drug resistant cell line of tongue cancer. Previous data has shown that TCRP1 is able to mediate DDP resistance in human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. However, the contribution of TCRP1 to the resistance of platinum agents in human lung and ovarian cancer cells remains to be elucidated. Our previous study showed that TCRP1 expression levels in samples of lung and ovarian cancer were significantly increased compared with normal controls. In the present study, it was demonstrated that TCRP1 contributed to the resistance to DDP and L-OHP in human lung and ovarian cancer cells. Knockdown of TCRP1 resensitized the cells to the platinum-based agents. The present study identified a positive correlation between TCRP1 expression and primary resistance to DDP and L-OHP in lung cancer cells. In addition, it was observed that cells treated with nuclear factor (NF)-κB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 displayed increased sensitivity to DDP and L-OHP. The results of the present study suggested that TCRP1 may be associated with resistance to DDP and L-OHP in lung and ovarian cancer cells, and the Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway may be involved in the functioning of TCRP1. These findings identify TCRP1 as a potential predictor of platinum resistance in the treatment of lung and ovarian cancer.",

        "abstract": "Cross-linked enzyme aggregates( CLEAs) is a non-carrier immobilization technique with the advantages of simple preparation,low cost and high unit activity. In this paper,papain-CLEAs were prepared and the effects of precipitation and cross-linking on CLEAs activity were investigated. It is shown that the highest activity of papain-CLEAs were obtained when using pure ethanol as precipitant,40% glutaraldehyde as crosslinker and cross-linking at 4 ℃ for 16 h. Moreover,the optimal catalytic conditions and operational stabilities of papain-CLEAs were characterized. Papain-CLEAs shifted the optimal pH from 7. 0 to 6. 0 and broaden the optimal temperature to the range of 50—80 ℃. Papain-CLEAs also enhanced thermal and storage stabilities compared with free enzyme. It is indicated from the morphology that these improved performances resulted from the high surface area and multi-points covalent cross-linking structure of every single papain-CLEAs. These improved characters show practical advantages of papain-CLEAs in biocatalysis.",
