        "title": "Ultrafine NiO particles induce cytotoxicity in vitro by cellular uptake and subsequent Ni(II) release.",
        "abstract": "Nickel oxide (NiO) is one of the important industrial materials used in electronic substrates and for ceramic engineering. Advancements in industrial technology have enabled the manufacture of ultrafine NiO particles. On the other hand, it is well-known that nickel compounds exert toxic effects. The toxicity of nickel compounds is mainly caused by nickel ions (Ni(2+)). However, the ion release properties of ultrafine NiO particles are still unclear. In the present study, the influences of ultrafine NiO particles on cell viability were examined in vitro to obtain fundamental data for the biological effects of ultrafine green NiO and ultrafine black NiO. Ultrafine NiO particles showed higher cytotoxicities toward human keratinocyte HaCaT cells and human lung carcinoma A549 cells than fine NiO particles and also showed higher solubilities in culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) than fine NiO particles. In particular, the concentration of Ni(2+) released into the culture medium by ultrafine green NiO was 150-fold higher than that released by fine green NiO. The concentrations of Ni(2+) released by both types of NiO particles in an aqueous solution containing amino acids were remarkably higher than those released by NiO particles in water. Moreover, we prepared a uniform and stable dispersion of ultrafine black NiO in culture medium and examined its influence on cell viability in comparison with that of NiCl(2), a soluble nickel compound. A medium exchange after 6 h of exposure resulted in a loss of cytotoxicity in the cells exposed to NiCl(2), whereas cytotoxicity was retained in the cells exposed to NiO. Transmission electron microscope observations revealed uptake of both ultrafine and fine NiO particles into HaCaT cells. Taken together, the present results suggest that the intracellular Ni(2+) release could be an important factor that determines the cytotoxicity of NiO. Ultrafine NiO is more cytotoxic than fine NiO in vitro.",

        "abstract": "Since nanoparticles easily agglomerate to form larger particles, it is important to maintain the size of their agglomerates at the nano-level to evaluate the harmful effect of the nanoparticles. We prevented agglomeration of nickel oxide nanoparticles by ultrasound diffusion and filtration, established an acute exposure model using animals, and examined inflammation and chemokine expression. The mass median diameter of nickel oxide nanoparticle agglomerates suspended in distilled water for intratracheal instillation was 26 nm (8.41 nm weighted average surface primary diameter). Male Wistar rats received intratracheal instillation of nickel oxide nanoparticles at 0.1 mg (0.33 mg/kg) or 0.2 mg (0.66 mg/kg), and were dissected 3 days, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the instillation. The control group received intratracheal instillation of distilled water. Three chemokines (cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1), CINC-2alphabeta, and CINC-3) in the lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined by quantitative measurement of protein by ELISA. Both CINC-1 and CINC-2alphabeta concentration was elevated from day 3 to 3 months in lung tissue and from day 3 to 6 months in BALF. On the other hand, CINC-3 was elevated on day 3 in both lung tissue and BALF, and then decreased. The total cell and neutrophil counts in BALF were increased from day 3 to 3 months. In lung tissue, infiltration of mainly neutrophils and alveolar macrophages was observed from day 3 to 6 months in alveoli. These results suggest that CINC was involved in lung injury by nickel oxide nanoparticles.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a method for determination of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in rat lungs after intratracheal instillation exposure. The MWCNTs were quantitatively decomposed to CO(2) by combustive oxidation and were then determined by non-dispersive infrared analysis. Samples were pretreated by acid digestion, muffle ashing and in situ preheating to remove interferences due to coexisting biological carbon from the lung tissue sample, while preserving the MWCNTs as in its their original form. The preservation was confirmed by transmission electron microscopic observation of the pretreated samples of exposed lung tissues and by the fact that the recoveries of MWCNTs spiked to the lung tissues were close to 100%. The detection limit for MWCNTs obtained by the proposed method was 0.30 \u03bcg and the repeatability as expressed by the relative standard deviation was 5.6% (n=4). The method was sufficiently sensitive and precise to apply to real samples of rat lung to investigate the in vivo persistence of intratracheally instilled MWCNTs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this type of sample pretreatment and direct determination of pristine MWCNTs without modification or tagging. Conventional indirect methods use tagging with other compounds or metal impurities in the CNTs for detection, and the detachment of these tags can increase uncertainties in the determination of the CNTs. The tags can also change how the CNTs persist in vivo, which can lead to an incorrect understanding of the persistence of pristine CNTs in vivo.",

        "title": "Comparative pulmonary toxicity study of nano-TiO2 particles of different sizes and agglomerations in rats: Different short- and long-term post-instillation results",
        "abstract": "Two intratracheal instillation experiments with nano-size titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) particles of different sizes and agglomerations were conducted in rats to compare the biological responses induced by the different particles. In experiment 1, 5 mg/kg of nano-TiO 2 particles of different primary sizes was intratracheally instilled in rats. In experiment 2, a similar procedure was followed with 5 mg/kg of nano-TiO 2 particles of the same primary sizes but different agglomerations in liquid. Following the instillations, body and lung weight measurements, bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) cells and inflammatory biomarkers assessment, and histopathological evaluations of the lungs and other tissues were conducted. Pulmonary inflammatory responses until 1 week post-instillation differed among the TiO 2 particle-exposed groups: that is, smaller particles induced greater inflammation in the short-term observations. With regard to the long-term effects (>1 week post-instillation), however, pulmonary inflammation remarkably recovered in all the TiO 2 particle-exposed groups, with no differences between the groups regardless of particle size. On the other hand, no clear relationship was observed between the TiO 2 particle-exposed groups with different agglomerations but the same primary size. These findings suggest that different evaluations can be derived on the basis of the observations up to 1 week post-instillation and those after 1 month post-instillation. In most of the current studies, the relationship between pulmonary responses and instilled particle sizes has been discussed only on the basis of the 24 h post-instillation results, which could be a misleading evaluation. Consequently, our findings indicate that both short- and long-term effects should be evaluated when assessing the toxicity of nanoparticles based on the results of intratracheal instillation studies. Keywords TiO 2 Nanoparticle Particle size Intratracheal instillation Hazard assessment 1 Introduction Engineered nanomaterials are being used widely with the development of nanotechnologies. However, there is growing concern regarding the risks to humans and the environment due to exposure during the production, use, consumption, and disposal of these products. In general, the term \u201cnanomaterial\u201d refers to a material with one, two, or three dimensions of roughly 1\u2013100 nm in size and its aggregates ( ISO, 2008 ). Although these materials are expected to fulfill various novel functions, the fact that their potential toxicities and the underlying mechanisms cannot be predicted by applying the present knowledge, because of their extremely small sizes, is a cause for concern. For example, nano-size titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) particles have greatly increased functions as catalysts due to the increase in surface area per particle weight. Further, they can be used as cosmetics due to increased clarity. On the other hand, the pulmonary responses induced by inhaled nanoparticles are considered to be greater than micron-sized particles because of the increased surface area per particle weight. Moreover, inhaled nanoparticles, after deposition in the lungs, largely escape the alveolar macrophage surveillance and gain greater access to the pulmonary interstitium by translocation from alveolar spaces through the epithelium ( Donaldson et al., 2001; Oberd\u00f6rster et al., 2005 ). Oberd\u00f6rster et al. (1992) and Renwick et al. (2004) have reported that rats intratracheally instilled with ultrafine (nano-size) TiO 2 particles have greater pulmonary inflammatory responses than those intratracheally instilled with fine (submicron-size) TiO 2 particles. Further, when the instilled doses were expressed in terms of particle surface area, the responses induced by the ultrafine and fine TiO 2 particles fell on the same dose\u2013response curve ( Oberd\u00f6rster, 2000; Oberd\u00f6rster et al., 2005; Donaldson et al., 2001 ). They therefore concluded that the greater inflammatory responses observed were due to the large surface area of the ultrafine TiO 2 particles. By intratracheal instillation studies of poorly soluble, low toxicity particles other than TiO 2 (such as carbon black and polystyrene latex) in rats, Brown et al. (2000, 2001) and Duffin et al. (2007) found that smaller particles produce greater pulmonary inflammatory responses. Some inhalation studies have been conducted to examine the relationship between the pulmonary responses and particle size. Following a 12-week inhalation study of rats exposed to nano-size (20 nm) and submicron-size (250 nm) TiO 2 particles, pulmonary inflammation was observed only the group exposed to the nano-size TiO 2 particles ( Oberd\u00f6rster et al., 1994 ). Bermudez et al. (2004) reported that nano-TiO 2 particles produce stronger inflammatory responses than micron-sized TiO 2 particles, by comparing the results of a 13-week inhalation study with nano- and micron-TiO 2 particles. These researchers suggested that the differences in the response were due to the differences in the surface area of the inhaled TiO 2 particles. Further, Tran et al. (2000) have reported that the responses of rats exposed to TiO 2 and BaSO 4 particles fell on the same dose\u2013response curve when the dose was expressed in terms of particle surface area. On the basis of a review of these studies, Maynard and Kuempel (2005) stated that surface area is the most relevant exposure metric for poorly soluble, low toxicity particles. The U.S. National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH, 2005 ) has supported the conclusion, and in November 2005, proposed a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.1 mg/m 3 for ultrafine TiO 2 particles (primary particle size <100 nm), which is 15 times lower than that for fine TiO 2 particles (i.e., 1.5 mg/m 3 ). In a recently published paper by researchers from NIOSH ( Sager et al., 2008 ), it was stated that pulmonary response differ according to particle sizes and that the differences in the responses can be explained by the differences in particle surface area doses. In contrast, it has also been reported that the pulmonary toxicities on exposure to these types of particles did not depend upon particle size or surface area. Warheit et al. (2006) found no significant differences in the pulmonary effects of intratracheally instilled TiO 2 particles of different sizes, surface areas, and crystallinity in rats, although there were significant differences in particle surface area (i.e., up to 30 times). Further, following intratracheal instillation studies in rats exposed to TiO 2 and crystalline silica with different crystallinities, Warheit et al. (2007a,b) concluded that the surface chemistry is a considerably more important factor determining pulmonary toxicity than particle surface area. Regarding nano- and micron-sized crystalline silica, Kajiwara et al. (2007) compared pulmonary inflammation up to 6 months post-instillation between rats intratracheally instilled with normal Min-U-Sil 5 crystalline silica particles (geometrical mean of particle size = 1.8 \u03bcm) and those instilled with the supernatant (obtained by centrifugation) of these particles (geometrical mean of particle size = 0.74 \u03bcm). Their conclusion was that pulmonary inflammation is greater in the rats exposed to the micron-sized particles than those exposed to the supernatant. As mentioned earlier, the relationship between toxicity and particle size is still not clear. One of the reasons is considered to be differences in not only the size but also the crystallinity, surface chemistry, and purity of the test samples in most of the studies conducted so far. For example, ultrafine and fine TiO 2 particles had different crystalline structures in the studies conducted by Bermudez et al. (2002, 2004) and Sager et al. (2008) . For the ultrafine TiO 2 particles, both groups used 80% anatase and 20% rutile TiO 2 particles manufactured by Degussa; however, for the micron-sized TiO 2 particles, they used 100% rutile TiO 2 particles manufactured by either DuPont ( Bermudez et al., 2002 ) or Sigma\u2013Aldrich ( Sager et al., 2008 ). Further, in some studies, the characterizations of the administered substances were not sufficient. Moreover, in most of the studies, only the 24-h post-instillation results were compared and assessed; only Warheit et al. (2006, 2007a, 2007b) and Kajiwara et al. (2007) assessed the results up to 3 months post-instillation. These differences make identification of the factors affecting toxicity very difficult. However, to assess the toxicity of nanoparticles and manage their risks, it is important to understand whether nanoparticles are more toxic than micron-sized particles. Therefore, in this study, two intratracheal instillation experiments with nano-TiO 2 particles of different primary sizes and agglomerations but the same manufacturer, manufacturing method, and crystalline structure (100% anatase) were conducted in rats to compare the biological responses in the lungs and other tissues of rats exposed to the different particle types. The results of these two experiments were then used to evaluate the relationships between pulmonary toxicity and particle size or agglomerations. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Sample preparation In the first experiment (experiment 1), three different sizes of anatase TiO 2 particles (Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, Ltd. Osaka, Japan) were used. The product names of these particles are ST-01, ST-21, and ST-41, corresponding to the primary particle sizes (grain sizes) of approximately 5, 23, and 154 nm. In this paper, these particle types are referred to as ultrafine (UF), superfine (SF), and fine (F) TiO 2 , respectively. To maintain the best dispersion state, 1\u20132 mg/mL disodium phosphate (DSP) was added as a dispersant to all the TiO 2 particle solutions, followed by agitation in an UAM015 agitating bead mill (Kotobuki Industries Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 10\u201312 m/s for 2 h with 15-\u03bcm zirconium oxide (ZrO 2 ) beads. Subsequently, the supernatant was recovered by centrifugation at 8000 \u00d7 g for 1 h (in the case of UF TiO 2 ), or the filtrate was recovered by filtration through a filter of 1-\u03bcm pore size (in the case of SF TiO 2 and F TiO 2 ). These solutions were intratracheally instilled after dilution with distilled water or concentration to a particle concentration of 5 mg/mL by using an evaporator. In the second experiment (experiment 2), only ST-01 particles (5-nm primary particle size) were used. By varying the preparation method, three different agglomeration states of TiO 2 particles in 2\u201313 mg/mL of DSP solution were obtained. In this paper, these particle types are referred to as UF1, UF2, and UF3 TiO 2 , in order of lower agglomeration. For preparing the UF1 TiO 2 particles, ST-01 particles were agitated using an UAM015 agitating bead mill at 12 m/s for 2 h with 15-\u03bcm ZrO 2 beads. Subsequently, the supernatant was recovered by centrifugation at 16,000 \u00d7 g for 1 h. To prepare the UF2 TiO 2 particles, ST-01 particles were dispersed by sonication for 2 min, and then, the filtrate was recovered by filtration through filters of 1- and 0.1-\u03bcm pore sizes. To prepare the UF3 TiO 2 particles, ST-01 particles were agitated in an UAM015 agitating bead mill at 15 m/s for 1.5 h with 50-\u03bcm ZrO 2 beads, the filtrate was recovered by filtration through a filter of 1-\u03bcm pore size, and then the supernatant was recovered by centrifugation at 1000 \u00d7 g for 1 h. The DSP concentrations were different in each TiO 2 sample solution, ranging from 2 mg/mL (UF1 TiO 2 ) to 13 mg/mL (UF3 TiO 2 ). In both experiments, 2 mg/mL DSP solution was used as the negative control (vehicle). Pulmonary effects induced by 13 mg/mL DSP solutions (same as that in the case of UF3 TiO 2 solutions) were examined by additional experiments: pulmonary responses due to the administration of the 13 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL DSP solutions were similar (data not shown). Further, in experiment 2, Min-U-Sil 5 crystalline silica particles (US Silica Co., Berkley Springs, WV) dispersed in 2 mg/mL of DSP solution was used as the positive control. Min-U-Sil 5 crystalline silica is known to produce continuous pulmonary inflammation in the lungs ( Warheit et al., 2007a; Kajiwara et al., 2007 ). 2.2 TiO 2 particle characterization Size distributions of each TiO 2 particle in DSP solution after sample preparation (i.e., secondary particle size distributions) were measured by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) method (Microtrac UPA150; Nikkiso Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Moreover, morphologies of the TiO 2 particles in the prepared solutions were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 2.3 Experimental animals In both experiments, 8-week-old male Crl: CD (SD) rats (Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc., Yokohama, Japan) were used. Their mean body weight was in the range of 279\u2013335 g at intratracheal instillation. 2.4 General experimental design In experiment 1, the rats were anesthetized with ether, and then, 1 mL/kg of sample solution was intratracheally instilled by using a 18-gauge indwelling needle, corresponding to 5 mg/kg of TiO 2 particle dose. Following the instillation, the viability and abnormal behavior of the rats were monitored once a day until dissection. The body weight of all the rats was measured before instillation and at 1, 3, 14, 21, and 28 days post-instillation. The weight of the lungs including that of the bronchi dissected at 3 days and 1 month post-instillation was measured. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the rats was examined for inflammatory biomarkers at 24 h and 1 week post-instillation. Histopathological evaluation of the lungs, liver, spleen, and cerebrum was also performed at 24 h, 3 days, 1 week, and 1 month post-instillation. In experiment 2, the rats were anesthetized with ether, and then, 1 mL/kg of sample solution was intratracheally instilled, corresponding to 5 mg/kg of TiO 2 or Min-U-Sil crystalline silica particle dose. Following the instillation, the viability and abnormal behavior of the rats were monitored once a day until dissection. The body and lung weights of all the rats were measured before instillation and at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, and 91 days post-instillation. The BALF and histopathological evaluation of the lungs, liver, spleen, cerebrum, and kidneys of the rats were performed for inflammatory markers at 24 h, 3 days, 1 week (7 days), 1 month (28 days) and 3 months (91 days) post-instillation. In both experiments, five rats per group were evaluated at each test point. 2.5 Pulmonary lavage The BALF of the rats was collected from the right lung. The rats were sacrificed after intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (Nembutal injectable; Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The bronchus of the left lung was clamped with forceps, and then, the right bronchus was cannulated. Subsequently, 3-mL heated saline \u223c37 \u00b0C (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Factory, Inc., Tokushima, Japan) was instilled and aspirated, and the BALF was obtained. The supernatant obtained by centrifuging the BALF at 300 \u00d7 g for 5 min was used for the chemokine and cytokine measurements. Thereafter, 2-mL saline solution was instilled and aspirated twice, and then these aspirates were centrifuged at 300 \u00d7 g for 5 min after addition to the residues obtained by centrifugation of the BALF. The cell fraction was used to determine the cell counts in the BALF. 2.6 Pulmonary cell proliferation studies The cell fractions obtained by using the aforementioned method were suspended in saline, and then, the number of total cells, neutrophils, macrophages (monocytes), lymphocytes, and eosinophils were counted with a XT-2000iV automatic erythrocyte analyzer (Sysmex Corporation, Hyogo, Japan). 2.7 Chemokine and cytokine measurements Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations in the supernatant obtained by centrifugation were measured with a TBA-200FR automatic biochemical analyzer (Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation, Tochigi, Japan). Interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, granulocyte monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 concentrations were measured by using a Rat Cytokine 10-Plex kit (Invitrogen Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and Bio-Plex Suspension Array System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). 2.8 Histopathology studies The trachea, left lung, liver, spleen, cerebrum, and kidney (only in experiment 2) of all the rats were fixed with 10% (v/v) neutral phosphate-buffered formalin solution. Thin slices were prepared from paraffin blocks of all the preserved tissues and then stained with hematoxylin\u2013eosin. The slices were observed through a light microscope. 2.9 Statistical analyses Statistical analyses of the body and lung weights and the cell numbers, biochemical parameters, and mRNA in the BALF were conducted. Statistical significance was determined by using multiple comparison tests between the control and TiO 2 -exposed groups. First, Bartlett's test was conducted. One-way layout analysis of variance was conducted when the variances were equal. Dunnet's multiple comparison tests were conducted when the differences between the groups were not significant. When the variances, as determined by the test of equal variance, were not equal, Kruskal\u2013Wallis's tests were conducted. Steel's multiple comparison tests were conducted when the differences were significant. Statistical significances were judged at the 0.05 probability level. SAS System version 6.12 (SAS Institute Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was used for all the statistical analyses. 3 Results 3.1 TiO 2 particle characterization The mean secondary particle diameters of the UF, SF, and F TiO 2 particles were 19, 28, and 176 nm, respectively. The mean secondary particle diameters of the UF1, UF2, and UF3 TiO 2 particles were 18, 65, and 300 nm, respectively. The size distributions measured by DLS and the TEM images of each TiO 2 particle type are presented in Fig. 1 . The results of the characterization of these particles are summarized in Table 1 . In both experiments, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis of all the TiO 2 suspensions confirmed that no residues of ZrO 2 particles were present. pH of the TiO 2 suspensions and the controls were in the range of 8.3\u20138.8. 3.2 Body and lung weights In both experiments, the body weights increased with increasing age. Statistically significant differences in body weight were not observed between any of the TiO 2 particle-exposed groups and the control group. In experiment 1, the lung weights were significantly greater in the UF and SF TiO 2 -exposed groups than in the control group at 3 days post-instillation, but there were no significant differences at 1 month post-instillation among any of the TiO 2 -exposed groups and the control group ( Fig. 2 a ). In experiment 2, the lung weights were significantly greater only at 1 month post-instillation in the UF1 TiO 2 -exposed group ( Fig. 3 a ). Further, lung weights were significantly greater at 24 h and 3 months post-instillation in the Min-U-Sil particle-exposed group. 3.3 BALF results 3.3.1 Pulmonary inflammation In experiment 1, significantly greater total cell numbers and percentages of neutrophils were observed in the UF and SF TiO 2 -exposed groups than in the control group at 24 h post-instillation ( Fig. 2 b and c). On the other hand, no significantly greater values of these pulmonary inflammatory parameters were observed in the F TiO 2 -exposed group at any time point. Consequently, greater pulmonary inflammatory responses were induced by the UF and SF TiO 2 particles than the F TiO 2 particles up to 1 week post-instillation. In experiment 2, significantly greater values of these parameters were observed in all the TiO 2 particle-exposed groups up to 1 week post-instillation, but no differences were observed between the control group and all the TiO 2 -exposed groups at 1 and 3 months post-instillation ( Fig. 3 b and c). On the other hand, the Min-U-Sil particle produced continuous inflammation; the inflammatory parameters significantly increased until 3 months post-instillation. 3.3.2 LDH and cytokines In experiment 1, significantly greater LDH levels were observed in the UF and SF TiO 2 -exposed groups than in the control group at 24 h post-instillation only ( Fig. 2 d). On the other hand, no significant increase in the LDH level was observed in the F TiO 2 -exposed group at any time point. Among the cytokines measured in this study, only the IL-6 concentration in the UF TiO 2 -exposed group at 24 h post-instillation was significantly increased (data not shown). The other cytokines were below the detection limit or did not have significantly high values in comparison with the control group. In experiment 2, significantly greater LDH levels were observed in the UF1 and UF3 TiO 2 -exposed groups only at 24 h post-instillation, and not in the UF2 TiO 2 -exposed group at any time point ( Fig. 3 d). Regarding to the cytokine measurements, significantly greater IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 levels were observed in the UF1 and UF3 TiO 2 -exposed groups only at 24 h post-instillation (data not shown). On the other hand, significantly greater LDH and these cytokine levels were observed in Min-U-Sil particle-exposed group at 24 h and 3 months post-instillation. 3.4 Histopathological evaluation In both experiments, histopathological changes were observed only in the lungs in all the groups. Therefore, only the histopathological evaluations of the lungs have been described in the following. In experiment 1, the grades of the pulmonary inflammatory responses differed among the TiO 2 particle-exposed groups up to 1 week post-instillation; there were no significant differences at 1 month post-instillation ( Table 2 ). At 1 week post-instillation ( Fig. 4 ), alveolar and interstitial macrophage infiltrations were observed in the UF TiO 2 -exposed group. Inflammatory cell infiltration and alveolar epithelium hypertrophy were also observed in this group. In the SF TiO 2 -exposed group, alveolar macrophage infiltration and inflammatory cell infiltration were observed; but at a lower grade than those in the UF TiO 2 particle-exposed group. In the F TiO 2 particle-exposed group, alveolar macrophage and inflammatory cell infiltrations were considerably milder than in the UF and SF TiO 2 -exposed groups. At 1 month post-instillation ( Fig. 5 ), the inflammatory responses remarkably recovered, and only minimal alveolar macrophage infiltration was observed in all the TiO 2 particle-exposed groups. Further, the severity of the findings was comparable among the TiO 2 particle-exposed groups. In experiment 2, there were no significant differences in the grades of the inflammatory responses among the TiO 2 particle-exposed groups at any time point ( Table 3 ). As in experiment 1, alveolar macrophage and inflammatory cell infiltrations recovered very quickly, and only minimal macrophage infiltration was observed in all the TiO 2 particle-exposed groups at 1 month post-instillation ( Fig. 6 ). In the Min-U-Sil particle-exposed group, short-term inflammatory responses were weak: slight-to-mild inflammatory cell infiltrations were observed until 1 month post-instillation. However, the inflammatory responses became much stronger at 3 months post-instillation ( Fig. 7 ). Consequently, Min-U-Sil particle produced continuous inflammation with a 5 mg/kg dose of intratracheal instillation, which was the significant difference in comparison with the same doses of the TiO 2 particle instillation. The results of the histopathological evaluations were consistent with the results of the BALF cell and LDH measurements. 4 Discussion In this study, two intratracheal instillation experiments with nano-TiO 2 particles of different sizes and agglomerations were conducted in rats, and the biological responses in the lungs and other tissues were compared among the TiO 2 particle-exposed groups at each post-instillation time point. In experiment 1, the inflammatory biomarkers and tissue inflammatory responses to the TiO 2 particles were in the order UF TiO 2 > SF TiO 2 > F TiO 2 until 1 week post-instillation. Therefore, in the short term, smaller TiO 2 particles induced greater inflammatory responses in the lungs at the same mass dose. However, at 1 month post-instillation, the inflammatory responses remarkably recovered in all the TiO 2 particle-exposed groups, and no significant differences in the pulmonary inflammation were observed among the groups. Differences in pulmonary inflammation were observed only in the short-term (\u22641 week post-exposure). In experiment 2, the inflammatory biomarkers and tissue inflammatory responses were different only at 24 h post-instillation; and there were no significant differences among the TiO 2 particle-exposed groups at any other time point. At 1 month post-instillation, the inflammatory responses recovered in all the TiO 2 particle-exposed groups and no significant differences were observed. Therefore, there is no clear relationship between pulmonary inflammation and particle agglomeration. On the other hand, the pulmonary inflammatory responses in the Min-U-Sil particle-exposed group were totally different from those of the TiO 2 particle-exposed groups: continuous pulmonary inflammation was observed for at least 3 months post-instillation. In both experiments, inflammatory responses were observed only in the lungs, and not in the liver, spleen, cerebrum, and kidney in all the groups. In summary, the pulmonary inflammatory responses in the short-term differed among the groups with different primary particle sizes. Until 1 week post-instillation, the differences were dependent on the primary sizes of the TiO 2 particles (i.e., smaller TiO 2 particles induced greater inflammation with the same mass dose). The differences may be due to the differences in particle surface area or particle number. The surface area dose was 1.58, 0.33, and 0.05 m 2 /kg in the UF, SF, and F TiO 2 particle-exposed groups, respectively. The difference in the surface area dose was more than 30 times between the UF and F TiO 2 particle-exposed groups. With regard to the long-term effects (\u22651 month post-instillation), pulmonary inflammation remarkably recovered in all the TiO 2 particle-exposed groups, with no differences between the groups in particle sizes. On the other hand, there was no clear relationship in pulmonary inflammation among the rats instilled with TiO 2 particles of the same primary size but different particle agglomerations. Oberd\u00f6rster et al. (1992, 1994) reported that rats intratracheally instilled with or inhaling smaller (20 nm) TiO 2 particles had greater inflammatory responses than those exposed to larger (250 nm) TiO 2 particles. Further, when the doses were expressed in terms of particle surface area, the responses of ultrafine and fine TiO 2 particles fell on the same dose\u2013response curve ( Oberd\u00f6rster, 2000; Oberd\u00f6rster et al., 2005; Donaldson et al., 2001 ). They therefore concluded that the greater inflammatory responses induced by the ultrafine TiO 2 particles were due to the larger total surface area of these particles. Brown et al. (2000, 2001) and Duffin et al. (2007) also concluded that smaller particles produce greater inflammatory responses. However, this conclusion was derived from the 24 h post-instillation results only; the experimental results after 1 week post-instillation were not analyzed. In a study by Sager et al. (2008) , differences in pulmonary inflammation were observed between the groups of rats intratracheally instilled with two different sizes of TiO 2 particles until 42 days post-instillation. The authors concluded that these differences can be explained by the differences in the surface area dose of the instilled TiO 2 particles. Further, Bermudez et al. (2002, 2004) arrived at the same conclusion following a 13-week inhalation study in rats. However, the ultrafine and fine TiO 2 particles used in both studies had different crystalline structures. The researchers used 80% anatase and 20% rutile TiO 2 particles manufactured by Degussa as the ultrafine TiO 2 particles; however, 100% rutile TiO 2 particles manufactured by either DuPont ( Bermudez et al., 2002 ) or Sigma\u2013Aldrich ( Sager et al., 2008 ) were used as the micron-sized TiO 2 particles. In the present study, the pulmonary inflammatory responses in the groups of rats instilled with different sizes and agglomerations of TiO 2 particles but by the same manufacturer, manufacturing method, and crystalline structure differed only in the short-term post-instillation. Therefore, different evaluations can be derived from the results obtained until 1 week post-instillation and those after 1 month post-instillation. When conducting a hazard assessment for humans by extrapolating the study results with experimental animals, it is important to evaluate not only the short-term effects such as transient inflammation, but also long-term effects such as persistent inflammation and fibrosis. Further, pulmonary inflammatory responses at 24 h post-instillation reflect the effects of the bolus exposure and instillation of the liquid into the lungs. Therefore, the 24 h post-instillation result does not fully express the toxicity of the instilled particles. For example, significant increases in the pulmonary inflammatory biomarkers, such as the numbers of neutrophils and LDH levels in BALF, were observed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution-exposed rats ( Warheit et al., 2006, 2007a,b ) and saline exposed rats ( Bergmann et al., 2000 ) at 24 h post-instillation. Judging from the facts, a toxicity evaluation based only on the results obtained at 24 h post-instillation could be misleading. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that both short- and long-term responses should be evaluated when conducting hazard assessments of nanoparticles according to the results of intratracheal instillation studies.

        "abstract": "Many investigations about the cellular response by metal oxide nanoparticles in vitro have been reported. However, the influence of the adsorption ability of metal oxide nanoparticles toward cells is unknown. The aim of this study is to understand the influence of adsorption by metal oxide nanoparticles on the cell viability in vitro. The adsorption abilities of six kinds of metal oxide nanoparticles, namely, NiO, ZnO, TiO2, CeO2, SiO2, and Fe2O3, to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with a 10% fetal bovine serum (DMEM-FBS) component such as serum proteins and Ca2) were estimated. All of the metal oxide nanoparticles adsorbed proteins and Ca2+ in the DMEM-FBS; in particular, TiO2, CeO2, and ZnO showed strong adsorption abilities. Furthermore, the influence of the depletion of medium components by adsorption to metal oxide nanoparticles on cell viability and proliferation was examined. The particles were removed from the dispersion by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to the cells. Both the cell viability and the proliferation of human keratinocyte HaCaT cells and human lung carcinoma A549 cells were affected by the supernatant. In particular, cell proliferation was strongly inhibited by the supernatant of TiO2 and CeO2 dispersions. The supernatant showed depletion of serum proteins and Ca2+ by adsorption to metal oxide nanoparticles. When the adsorption effect was blocked by the pretreatment of particles with FBS, the inhibitory effect was lost. However, in NiO and ZnO, which showed ion release, a decrease of inhibitory effect by pretreatment was not shown. Furthermore, the association of the primary particle size and adsorption ability was examined in TiO2. The adsorption ability of TiO2 depended on the primary particle size. The TiO2 nanoparticles were size dependently absorbed with proteins and Ca2+, thereby inducing cytotoxicity. In conclusion, the adsorption ability of metal oxide nanoparticles is an important factor for the estimation of cytotoxicity in vitro for low-toxicity materials.",

        "abstract": "A dispersion method using a bead mill was developed for preparing suspensions used in hazard testing of nanosize fullerenes. Fullerene crystals (C 60 ) of several \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm in size were wet ground using a bead mill and dispersed in pure water containing Tween 80 as a dispersant. The particle size, dispersing condition, crystallization and fullerene oxide in the suspension prepared by bead milling were evaluated. As a result, the conditions of bead milling where the sizes of fullerene crystals were reduced to 100 nm or less were found, which made it possible to prepare a fullerene aqueous dispersion system using Tween 80. Furthermore, by centrifugation, it became possible to prepare fullerene suspensions in which the particle size of the majority of the suspended particles was 100 nm or less. The prepared suspensions remained stable for almost two months. Controlling milling conditions and milling time made it possible to achieve dispersion while maintaining the crystallized state of the fullerenes, and operating in anaerobic conditions under shade effectively suppressed the production of oxidized fullerenes. The fullerene suspensions prepared by bead milling and centrifugation were suitable for endotracheal administration tests and inhalation tests using rats. Keywords Bead milling Fullerene suspension Tween 80 Dispersion Hazard test 1 Introduction Because of the highly unique characteristics of fullerene C 60 , research and development is being conducted for a wide variety of industrial uses, from biomedical technology and cosmetics to electronic devices and optical materials [1\u20133] . On the other hand, research has also been widely conducted on its biological effects using fish and rats [4,5] . Initially, interest in their medical applications (e.g. DDS) generated a great deal of research into reactions within organisms that had been injected with fullerenes, but as they become more widely used as industrial products, more research is being conducted on how exposure through the medium of the environment affects human health and organisms [6,7] . However, there are few studies of their harmful effects in which particle size, the most important characteristic of the particles, was precisely evaluated or controlled in the test samples. In order to properly assess the biological effects of nanoparticles, including fullerenes, the characteristics of the hazard test samples, including particle size, must be sufficiently controlled and evaluated. This study aims to develop a method for preparing test samples where the distribution of particle size is controlled and evaluated in order to assess the effect on organisms and human health from exposure to fullerenes through the environment. When evaluating the effect of all nanoparticles\u2014not just fullerenes\u2014on human health, the inhalation pathway is the most important of all exposure pathways, so it is essential to assess the affect of exposure through inhalation. Accordingly, in this study a method is developed for preparing fullerene aqueous dispersion samples to be used in in vivo hazard tests of inhalation pathways in rodents, particularly in endotracheal administration tests and inhalation tests. It is assumed that the wet nanoparticle production method will be used in inhalation tests, where aqueous suspensions of nanoparticles are converted into an aerosol. Some methods of dispersing fullerenes in water involve dissolving them first with aromatic solvents like toluene, adding water, and then distilling the solvent [8,9] , or using the comparatively low-toxicity tetrahydrofuran THF as a solvent [10] , but studies have pointed to the effect of residual solvents and changes in the particles\u2019 electric charge that occur when organic solvents are used. Moreover, a method [11,12] is being studied that does not use an organic solvent, dispersing C 60 in water by subsuming it inside a cyclodextrin, but this method has not reached the stage of preparing nano-level suspensions. Recently, Deguchi et al. have reported a convenient fullerene aqueous dispersion method using hand grinding in a mortar [13] , and they suggest that this method enables dispersion down to the nano-level. This method is extremely attractive, but they report a 5% mass standard for recovery of nanoparticles in a filtrate using a 100 nm filter. When tests for inhalation exposure are taken into consideration, the low yield of nanosize particles is problematic. Recently, however, as demand increases for industrial uses of suspensions of nanosized particles, several types of liquid phase dispersion have been attempted: high-pressure dispersion using shock waves (cavitation) [14] ; crashing particles by their collision together at high speeds [15] ; and tensile rupture in high-velocity and high-shear fields [16] . Among these various attempts, a method using small beads less than 100 \u03bcm in diameter, one type of wet milling/dispersion method is drawing attention [17,18] . It is said that the bead mill method using small beads makes it possible to disperse nanoparticle agglomerates virtually to the primary particle, and it also makes it possible to ensure high throughput. This study examines a method of suspending fullerenes in water using a bead mill in order to prepare test samples for in vivo hazard tests of nanoscale fullerene particles. It also investigates a method of regulating the particle size in suspensions to be used as test samples. 2 Experimental methods 2.1 Requisites for prepared suspension When conducting in vivo hazard tests in rodents using C 60 aqueous suspensions, it was determined that test samples had to meet the following requisites: the mass median diameter of suspended particle sizes had to be less than 100 nm; and in endotracheal administration tests, the concentration of C 60 particles had to be 0.5 mg/mL, which enables the administration of 0.5 mg per 1 kg of rodent body weight. Suspensions prepared this way can also be used in inhalation exposure tests, where the suspension is atomized as an aerosol. When preparing suspensions for testing purposes, the use of solvents should be avoided if possible, but since fullerenes are hydrophobic, it is difficult to disperse them in water without using a solvent. Therefore, this study used a surfactant, which has been approved in connection with food safety and hygiene [19] , and has also been used in previous inhalation tests. 2.2 Preparation of sample and dispersion medium The C 60 fullerene used as a raw material was crystalline Nanom Purple TR , purchased from Frontier Carbon Co. (Kitakyushu, Japan). It is produced by the combustion method, and further purified by sublimation. An SEM image is given in Fig. 1 . Particles in the raw material were large in size (100 \u03bcm or more). The pure water used in dispersion, deoxidized through Argon replacement, was obtained by the following method. Ultrapure water that was ion exchanged with MillQ (Millipore, Billerica, US) was filtrated with an endotoxin removal filter (Bio-pack, Millipore). Furthermore, to control the oxidation of the fullerenes, the filtrated ultrapure water was boiled in a 1 L conical flask for approximately 5\u201310 min. After confirming that bubbles on the walls of the flask had vanished, argon gas was bubbled while rapidly cooling with ice water, and bubbling was suspended after confirming that the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water measured by SevenGo pro (Mettler Toledo, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland) was 0.01 mg/L or less. In order to suspend hydrophobic fullerenes in water, the nonionic surfactant Tween 80 (Polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was used as a dispersant. Tween 80 was selected because it was used in endotracheal administration tests in rats with no reported secondary effects, in a concentration of 1%, as a dispersion medium in multilayer carbon nanotubes ground with a ball mill [20] , and also because the stability of fullerenes in Tween 80 aqueous solutions had been studied [21] . In a globe box that had been nitrogen substituted so the oxygen concentration was less than 0.1%, Tween 80 was added to the deoxidized water mentioned above, and a dispersion medium adjusted for the designated concentration of dispersant was used in the following dispersion method. 2.3 Dispersion method The bead mill (UAM-15, Kotobuki Industries Co., Ltd., Kure, Japan) shown in Fig. 2 was used for wet dispersion of C 60 . Since the particles in the raw material were large in size (100 \u03bcm or more) as indicated in Fig. 1 , preliminary grinding was performed inside a nitrogen-substituted globe box prior to bead mill dispersion. For 30 min, the designated amount of the raw material, to which trace amounts of the dispersion medium had been added, was ground and kneaded in an agate mortar. The suspension for use in bead mill dispersion was obtained by adding a Tween 80 aqueous solution to the raw material and adjusting the concentration of C 60 to 0.1\u20135 mg/mL. Five hundred millilitres of the raw material suspension were put inside a bead mill, which had been purged of nitrogen in advance, and wet dispersed under a nitrogen current (4\u20135 mL/min) for the designated period of time. Approximately 400 g of zirconia beads (Nikkato Co., Osaka, Japan) with diameter D B of 15\u201350 \u03bcm were used for the beads, which filled approximately 63% of the mill capacity. The mill was operated with the circumferential velocity v of the stirring blade at 8\u201315 m/s and the flow rate of the suspension at 10 L/h. Both grinding in the globe box and bead mill dispersion were carried out in shade in order to suppress fullerene oxidation. Two additional samples were also prepared for comparison: a sample ground by hand in a mortar, and a dispersion sample produced by ultrasonication. The sample ground by hand in a mortar was prepared according to the method of Deguchi et al. [10,13] . First, 10 mg of the raw material C 60 particles was put into an agate mortar, and after adding the dispersion medium described above in Section 2.2 , the sample was ground by hand for 2 min. The fullerenes that adhered to the agate pestle were removed with a spatula and returned to the mortar, and the grinding procedure was repeated ten times. The obtained ground material was suspended in a designated amount of the dispersion medium and churned in a stirrer for 24 h. A dispersion sample produced by ultrasonication was prepared using an ultrasonic homogenizer with maximum output of 50 W (Model 250, Branson Ultrasonics Co., Danbury, USA) to disperse the slurry that was hand ground by the method described above. 2.4 Adjusting particle size in a suspension by centrifugation The objective of this study is the preparation of an aqueous solution in which the size of the majority of fullerene particles is kept under 100 nm. After the preparation by bead milling, the suspension was centrifugated at a given centrifugal intensity (=ratio of centrifugal acceleration to gravitational one) for 1 h (MX-300, TOMY Seiko Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). 2.5 Characterization Particle sizes were measured using laser diffraction (Helos, Sympatec GmbH, Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany) and dynamic light scattering (DLS; UPA 150, Microtrac Inc., Montgomeryville, USA), and zeta potential was measured with Zetasizer Nano (Malvern Instrument Ltd., Worcestershire, UK). Dispersion states, grain shapes, and crystallization states were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), high-resolution TEM (EM922, Carl Zeiss NTS, Oberkochen, Germany), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JSM-5410, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Furthermore, impurities were measured using X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF; JSX-3201, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS; JSM-5410, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The concentration of fullerenes within the prepared suspension was measured by assessing the absorbance of visible\u2013UV light, primarily at wavelengths of 340 nm (UV-2550, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Furthermore, the production of oxidized fullerenes was measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Agilent 1100, Agilent Technologies, USA) after fullerenes in the suspension were dissolved with toluene. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Assessing particle concentration Fig. 3 shows the absorbance spectra within the visible\u2013UV range of the C 60 suspension wet ground by bead mill in a Tween 80 1 mg/mL aqueous solution (without ultracentrifugation) as well as of the Tween 80 1 mg/mL aqueous solution used as a dispersant. While absorbance was observed at wavelengths of 234 nm in the Tween 80 aqueous solution, two strong absorbance peaks dominated the spectrum of C 60 suspension, i.e., bands at 261 nm and 340 nm. Both arise from electronic transitions of C 60 and shifted to more red than C 60 molecules [22\u201324] . Given that absolutely no absorbance at wavelengths of 340 nm was observed in the Tween 80 aqueous solution, measuring the degree of absorbance at 340 nm is believed to enable assessment of C 60 concentration within the suspension. Since the recovered suspension contained the particle having sizes of relatively wide range or over 100 nm in size, the particle size should be adjusted into less than 100 nm by the centrifugation, as described in Section 3.4 . In this work, the concentration of C 60 in the supernatant obtained by ultracentrifugation of the suspension should be measured. The relationship between the absorbance at 340 nm and the concentration of C 60 particles within the supernatant of centrifuged suspension, estimated by drying the suspension and weighing the mass of C 60 particles, is given in Fig. 4 (a). As the graph indicates, a clear proportional relationship was obtained, and it is possible to assess the concentration of C 60 particles within the suspension by measuring the degree of absorbance at 340 nm. Since there was also very good agreement between HPLC liquid chromatography assessment and UV\u2013Vis one of the C 60 toluene solution as shown in Fig. 4 (b), absorbance at 340 nm was used to assess the C 60 particle concentration in this study. 3.2 Dispersion by mortar and ultrasonication Fig. 5 shows the particle size distributions Q 3 ( x ) based on mass for fullerenes in the sample treated to hand grinding in a mortar and in a sample that was further dispersed by ultrasonication, along with SEM photographs. The concentrations of C 60 and Tween 80 were adjusted at 0.1 mg/mL. As the SEM photographs demonstrate, the crushed particles were several \u03bcm in size. Furthermore, it was observed that these particles formed agglomerates of several tens of \u03bcm. Since the particle sizes go beyond the size range measured by DLS, the particle size distributions shown in Fig. 5 were measured using laser diffraction. No significant variance was observed between the particle size distributions of the particles in the suspension produced by hand grinding and the suspension produced by ultrasonication. The particles produced contained 20 wt% of fine particles smaller than 1 \u03bcm, but the majority were micron-sized; it was difficult to grind C 60 crystals to nanosizes using these methods. Deguchi et al. indicated the possibility of using hand grinding in mortars to disperse sub-micron fine particles in an SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) aqueous solution [13] , but miniaturization below 100 nm was not achieved in this experiment. It is thought that dispersion by more powerful mechanical processing is required, but as discussed below, there is concern that the crystalline structure of fullerenes may be destroyed by powerful mechanical processing. 3.3 Aqueous dispersion of fullerenes using a bead mill 3.3.1 Oxidation of fullerenes Oxidized fullerenes are known to be produced through exposure to light within the solvent or through oscillating mill grinding in an oxygen atmosphere [25,26] , and it is expected that oxidized fullerenes will be produced during bead mill dispersion as well, depending on the conditions. Fig. 6 shows a comparison between the production of oxidized fullerenes when preparation of the dispersion medium and bead milling were performed in air without shading versus treatment in a shaded, anaerobic environment. The suspensions with a C 60 concentration of 1.5 mg/mL in Tween 80 aqueous solution of 1.0 mg/mL were prepared by bead milling using beads with a diameter D B = 50 \u03bcm stirred by a blade rotating at a speed of 15 m/s. The mass content of C 60 and C 60 \u2013O was sought from the HPLC output. When treated in air and under room lights, the C 60 \u2013O content was 3\u20134% after 30 min of dispersion and 7% after 60 min; by contrast, the C 60 \u2013O content was 0.7\u20130.8% after 30 min of grinding in anaerobic, shaded conditions. Deoxidizing the dispersion medium, water, along with preliminary hand grinding and bead milling under anaerobic, shaded conditions were effective in controlling the production of oxidized fullerenes, enabling the C 60 \u2013O content to be kept below 1% and both were used for hazard tests. 3.3.2 Particle size of fullerenes ground in bead mills Fig. 7 shows the relationship between dispersing time t D and particle size distribution of C 60 along with photographs of the suspension. Fullerenes at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL were ground in Tween 80 aqueous solution of 1.0 mg/mL. The bead mill was operated using beads with a diameter D B = 50 \u03bcm stirred by blades rotating at a speed of 10 m/s. In this figure, the size of particles in the raw material ( t D = 0) that was hand ground is indicated in the range of 0.5 \u03bcm to several \u03bcm, but this is because the measurement limitations of DLS meant that particles larger than several \u03bcm were not measured. Compared to the state of the suspensions in the photograph, it is clear that sedimentary particles larger than 10 \u03bcm exist. With a dispersing time of 45\u201360 min, the finest distribution of particle sizes was obtained, with a mass median diameter x 50,3 of 50 nm and a mass fraction of over 80% for particles less than 100 nm in size. Furthermore, as the photographs illustrate, the suspension became a transparent, amber liquid after approximately 30 min, and it became a transparent suspension with the darkest color at 45\u201360 min. The particle mass concentration of the suspension milled for 60 min decreased to 70\u201380% of the initial concentration. It is believed that the greatest production of fine particles occurred between 45 and 60 min. Subsequently, a drop in concentration was observed, and it had decreased to less than 10% of prepared concentration at 120 min. Based on these observations, it became clear that bead milling is effective for grinding fullerenes to sizes smaller than 100 nm. It was also confirmed that Tween 80 is effective in aqueous dispersion of fullerenes. Fig. 8 shows the relationship between mass median diameter x 50,3 and dispersing time t D (a). Using D B = 50 \u03bcm beads, which have a great deal of kinetic energy, enabled dispersion of up to 50 nm in 45\u201360 min. In this case, however, particle size increased if dispersing time continued any longer, and as indicated in Fig. 7 , particle concentration dropped and the suspension lost its color, becoming opaque at 120 min. It is presumed that the causes of the increase in particle size and the drop in particle concentration after 60 min were that size reduction activated the surface of the C 60 and groups of particles agglomerated, adhering to the beads and the walls of the mill. After the bead milling, the color of the beads was clearly changed into brown, and the color change was remarkable when the milling went well. This means that the fullerene particles ground to finer adhered to the beads for long bead mill operation. Furthermore, the long milling activated the surface of ground particles and the C 60 particles agglomerated. Re-agglomeration of nanoparticles has also been observed in wet dispersion of titania nanoparticles in a bead mill [18] , but further study is required to explain the causes of the phenomenon and ways to suppress it. Conversely, when mechanical conditions were weakened by the use of beads of 30 \u03bcm or 15 \u03bcm in diameter, particles in the suspension became larger and particles of 300 nm in size were obtained after 1 h of dispersion. The particle size was slightly reduced when dispersing time was increased, with particle sizes of about 200 nm achieved at 2 h, but large changes were not observed. 3.3.3 Crystallization of particles produced Fig. 8 shows a high-resolution TEM image of particles treated to 120 min of dispersion. At D B = 15 \u03bcm and stirring speed v = 8 m/s (b), a lattice pattern was observed in the TEM image, and crystallization was maintained. On the other hand, decrystallization occurred at D B = 50 \u03bcm, v = 10 m/s (c). These results suggest that dispersion under mild mechanical conditions, or dispersion for short periods, is required in order to maintain the crystalline structure of fullerenes. 3.4 Preparing a suspension by centrifugation 3.4.1 Particle size The objective of this study is the preparation of solution for in vivo hazard tests of nanoscale fullerene particles. And as written in 2.1, a comparatively high concentration of C 60 particles (about 0.5 mg/mL) has to be secured in endotracheal administration tests. As increase the particle concentration, milling efficiency decrease and size of milled particle increase. Taking the preceding discussion into consideration, it was discovered that dispersion for a short period under relatively strong dispersion conditions was desirable in order to obtain the desired sample, where the fullerenes\u2019 crystalline structure is kept intact. Thus, D B = 50 \u03bcm, v = 15 m/s, and 30 min were employed as milling conditions, and a suspension with a C 60 concentration of 1.5 mg/mL (Tween 80 concentration = 1.0 mg/mL) was prepared. After the milling, the prepared suspension was centrifugated to adjust the particle size and the concentration. Fig. 9 shows the particle distribution in the supernatant centrifuged at centrifugal intensities (=ratio of centrifugal acceleration to gravitational one) of 4000, 8000, and 16,000 for 1 h. The x 50,3 of fullerenes in the suspension prior to centrifugation was about 100 nm, but as centrifugal intensities were increased, the x 50,3 of the recovered supernatant became 60 nm, 32 nm, and 17 nm, and the 90% diameter of the mass standard decreased, from 170 nm to 83 nm to 55 nm. These results revealed that it is possible to prepare a C 60 aqueous dispersion system with the majority of fullerene particles at less than 100 nm by regulating the conditions of centrifugation. Also, relative to the particle concentration of the suspension introduced into the bead mill, the particle mass concentrations for the supernatants recovered through this method of centrifugation were 40\u201342% (4000), 25\u201330% (8000), and 14\u201315% (16,000), respectively. Impurities in those supernatants were measured using XRF and EDS. The XRF spectrum of the solid obtained by drying the supernatant centrifuged at a centrifugal intensity of 8000 (solid line) is shown in Fig. 10 and the spectrum obtained from the water containing Fe of 100 ppm as a tracer is shown in the figure (broken line). The difference in the both spectra was not clear excluding fluorescent X-ray of Fe and the intensity of fluorescent X-ray for Zr which was expected as contaminants arising from the abrasion of beads, stirring blades, and inner wall of mill was the same level of the noise. No impurities from the bead milling believed to result from the bead mill were detected. 3.4.2 Stability The stability of the supernatant recovered by centrifugation was examined. The C 60 suspension was initially prepared by bead milling at a concentration of 1.5 mg/mL in 1.0 mg/mL Tween 80 aqueous solution. The mill was operated at a blade rotational speed of 15 m/s using D B = 50 \u03bcm beads. After 30 min milling, the suspension was centrifugated at centrifugal intensity of 8000. The supernatant was split into vials of 10 mL, and those vials were left sitting in a refrigerator for a certain period. The suspensions of 2 mL were sampled from different vials to measure the concentration and the size distribution of C 60 . Fig. 11 shows the stability of concentration for C 60 particles in the supernatant (a). The concentrations of C 60 by the centrifugation were 0.48 mg/mL and the suspension was diluted into 0.24 mg/mL. Their photographs are shown in Fig. 11 ((b): 0.48 mg/mL; (c): 0.24 mg/mL). The concentrations of the suspensions obtained by this method were constant for almost two months, regardless of particle concentration. Fig. 12 shows the stability of particle size distribution for C 60 particles in the supernatant. As the diagrams indicate, there is little variation in size distribution of the suspension for almost two months. The suspensions maintained a highly stable dispersion state. The relationship between zeta potential of C 60 particles in the suspension and concentration of dispersant is shown in Fig. 13 . The concentrations of C 60 were ranging from 0.2 mg/mL to 0.3 mg/mL. Tween 80 is nonionic, so fullerenes in a Tween 80 aqueous solution (pH 7.0) indicate a zeta potential of approximately \u221230 mV for lower dispersant concentration. This value is quite close to values obtained for fullerenes in other aqueous solutions [27] , and it gives the surface electric charge of C 60 particle. On the other hand, the zeta potential decreased at the Tween 80 concentration of 1 mg/mL. It seemed that the coverage of Tween 80 molecules on the C 60 particle surface increased and the electric charge of C 60 decreased, as increase of the dispersant concentration. It is believed that the stability of C 60 in Tween 80 aqueous solution as shown in Figs. 11\u201313 was maintained by not only the surface electrical interaction, but the repulsion of the dispersant molecule structure. 3.4.3 Crystalline structure Fig. 14 shows high-resolution TEM observation results for C 60 particles in the supernatant recovered by centrifugation of C 60 suspension milled at blade rotational speed of 15 m/s using D B = 50 \u03bcm bead for 30 min. From those results, it was observed that the primary particles in suspensions regulated by centrifugation were about 20\u201350 nm in size, and that these particles agglomerate, forming secondary particles about 50\u2013100 nm in size. However, it is unclear whether the secondary particles observed by TEM are particles in a suspended state, or whether they were formed during the production of samples for TEM observation. Furthermore, given that crystalline lattices could be clearly observed, as the photographs demonstrate, it was possible to confirm that these were particles that maintained the crystalline state of C 60 . In addition, diffraction patterns were also observed using selected-area electron diffraction and the pattern is shown in Fig. 15 [28] . Based on these results, it was discovered that suspensions of C 60 smaller than 100 nm that maintain their face-centered cubic (fcc) crystalline structure having a lattice constant of 1.42 nm could be prepared by short-term bead mill dispersion, even under strong dispersion conditions. Fullerene suspensions prepared under these conditions are suitable for endotracheal administration tests and inhalation tests using rats [29,30] . 4 Conclusion In order to establish a method of preparing aqueous fullerene solutions suitable for use in hazard tests of nanosize fullerenes, a mechanical dispersion method using a bead mill was examined. As a result, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) It was discovered that fullerene crystals larger than several \u03bcm in size can be wet dispersed to sizes below 100 nm using a bead mill with very small beads, and that it is possible to prepare aqueous C 60 solutions using Tween 80 as a dispersant. Furthermore, with centrifugation it was possible to regulate the size of most of the suspended particles below 100 nm, and suspensions prepared by that method were stable for 2 weeks or more. (2) By appropriately configuring the conditions for bead mill dispersion (stirring speed, bead size, dispersing time), it is possible to preserve the crystalline structure of C 60 . (3) By conducting the dispersion process, including preparation of the dispersant medium, in anaerobic, shaded conditions, it is possible to suppress the production of oxidized fullerenes. (4) Fullerene suspensions prepared by bead milling and centrifugation are suitable for endotracheal administration tests and inhalation tests using rats.

        "abstract": "Even though there have been some investigations into cellular responses induced by ultrafine titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) in vitro , the relationship between cellular responses and secondary particle size is still not clear. In this study, a stable and uniform TiO 2 -cell culture-medium dispersion was prepared, and cellular responses prompted by \u201cultrafine secondary particles\u201d were examined. The TiO 2 \u2013DMEM\u2013FBS dispersion included secondary particles in which the secondary particle size was 100 nm or less. In the present study, a \u201csecondary particle\u201d was defined as a complex aggregate of TiO 2 primary particles, proteins from FBS and other medium components. Secondary particle size did not influence the cell viability. The TiO 2 \u2013DMEM\u2013FBS dispersion introduced to the human keratinocyte HaCaT cells caused weak intracellular oxidative stress and apoptosis. The cellular influence of ultrafine TiO 2 in vitro is caused by the following mechanisms: (1) Secondary particles are formed. Ultrafine TiO 2 particles dispersed in medium immediately form secondary particles with proteins and salts. (2) \u201cUltrafine\u201d secondary particles are taken up by the cells. The secondary particles reach the cells by diffusion and/or sedimentation and are taken up by the cells, through endocytosis. (3) Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level increases. Internalized secondary particles induce an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, although the secondary particles do not break up in the cell. In the case of ultrafine TiO 2 , the increase of the intracellular ROS level was minimal. Moreover, the antioxidation system of cells such as glutathione was working. (4) Apoptotic cell death is induced. An accumulation of oxidative stress activates the apoptotic pathway (such as the caspase-3) and subsequently induces apoptotic cell death. After 24 h of exposure to TiO 2 , the percentage of apoptotic cells was only 6\u20137%. As a result, although the ultrafine TiO 2 particles induce some cellular responses, these cellular responses to ultrafine TiO 2 are weaker than those of other cytotoxic ultrafine metal oxide particles, such as nickel oxide.

        "abstract": "Risk assessment of nanoparticles by inhalation experiments is of great importance since inhalation is considered the most significant route of exposure to nanoparticles suspended in air. However, there have been few inhalation experiments using manufactured nanoparticles, mainly because of the difficulty in stably dispersing the nanoparticles in air for a long period of time. In this study, we report for the first time the development of a rational system for stably and continuously dispersing and supplying manufactured nanoparticles for inhalation experiments. The system was developed using a spray-drying technique, in which a nebulizer was used to atomize nickel oxide (NiO) and fullerene (C60) nanoparticle suspensions, and the resulting droplets were dried to generate aerosol nanoparticles. The size, concentration and morphology of the aerosol particles were evaluated by in-line measurements using an aerosol measuring device and off-line measurements based on the collection of the aerosol particles. After examining the effects of the conditions for the suspensions and the aerosol generation, we were able to obtain NiO and C60 aerosol nanoparticles with average diameters of 53-64 and 88-98 nm, respectively. By feeding these aerosols into a whole-body exposure chamber for rats, a stable supply of the aerosol nanoparticles could be achieved for long hourly durations (6 h per day) as well as for long terms (5 days per week for 4 weeks).",

        "abstract": "Concern over the influence of nanoparticles on human health has risen due to advances in the development of nanotechnology. We are interested in the influence of nanoparticles on the pulmonary system at a molecular level. In this study, gene expression profiling of the rat lung after whole-body inhalation exposure to C(60) fullerene (0.12mg/m(3); 4.1x10(4) particles/cm(3), 96nm diameter) and ultrafine nickel oxide (Uf-NiO) particles (0.2mg/m(3); 9.2x10(4) particles/cm(3), 59nm diameter) as a positive control were employed to gain insights into these molecular events. In response to C(60) fullerene exposure for 6h a day, for 4 weeks (5 days a week), C(60) fullerene particles were located in alveolar epithelial cells at 3 days post-exposure and engulfed by macrophages at both 3 days and 1 month post-exposures. Gene expression profiles revealed that few genes involved in the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and metalloendopeptidase activity were up-regulated at both 3 days and 1 month post-exposure. Only some genes associated with the immune system process, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mediated immunity were up-regulated. These results were significantly different from those of Uf-NiO particles which induced high expression of genes associated with chemokines, oxidative stress, and matrix metalloproteinase 12 (Mmp12), suggesting that Uf-NiO particles lead to acute inflammation for the inhalation exposure period, and the damaged tissues were repaired in the post-exposure period. We suggest that C(60) fullerene might not have a severe pulmonary toxicity under the inhalation exposure condition.",

The deposition rate of the pp-HMDSO films increased with the increasing RF power. But for vapor pressure, the deposition rates increased with increasing the vapor pressure until 100 Pa; above it, deposition rates tended to decrease gradually.

The mass median diameter of nickel oxide in distilled water was 26 nm. Rats intratracheally received 0.2 mg of nickel oxide suspended in distilled water, and were sacrificed from three days to six months. The concentrations of 21 cytokines including inflammation, fibrosis and allergy-related ones were measured in the lung. Infiltration of alveolar macrophages was observed persistently in the nickel oxide-exposed group. Expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha showed a continued increase in lung tissue and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) while interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-1beta in lung tissue and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in BALF showed transient increases. Taken together, it was suggested that nano-agglomerates of nickel oxide nanoparticles have a persistent inflammatory effect, and the transient increase in cytokine expression and persistent increases in CC chemokine were involved in the persistent pulmonary inflammation.",

        "abstract": "We performed inhalation and intratracheal instillation studies of cerium dioxide (CeO2) nanoparticles in order to investigate their pulmonary toxicity, and observed pulmonary inflammation not only in the acute and but also in the chronic phases. In the intratracheal instillation study, F344 rats were exposed to 0.2 mg or 1 mg of CeO2 nanoparticles. Cell analysis and chemokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analyzed from 3 days to 6 months following the instillation. In the inhalation study, rats were exposed to the maximum concentration of inhaled CeO2 nanoparticles (2, 10 mg/m(3), respectively) for 4 weeks (6 h/day, 5 days/week). The same endpoints as in the intratracheal instillation study were examined from 3 days to 3 months after the end of the exposure. The intratracheal instillation of CeO2 nanoparticles caused a persistent increase in the total and neutrophil number in BALF and in the concentration of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC)-1, CINC-2, chemokine for neutrophil, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an oxidative stress marker, in BALF during the observation time. The inhalation of CeO2 nanoparticles also induced a persistent influx of neutrophils and expression of CINC-1, CINC-2, and HO-1 in BALF. Pathological features revealed that inflammatory cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, invaded the alveolar space in both studies. Taken together, the CeO2 nanoparticles induced not only acute but also chronic inflammation in the lung, suggesting that CeO2 nanoparticles have a pulmonary toxicity that can lead to irreversible lesions.",

        "abstract": "We used fullerenes, whose dispersion at the nano-level was stabilized by grinding in nitrogen gas in an agitation mill, to conduct an intratracheal instillation study and an inhalation exposure study. Fullerenes were individually dispersed in distilled water including 0.1% Tween 80, and the diameter of the fullerenes was 33 nm. These suspensions were directly injected as a solution in the intratracheal instillation study. The reference material was nickel oxide in distilled water. Wistar male rats intratracheally received a dose of 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, or 1 mg of fullerenes and were sacrificed after 3 days, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. In the inhalation study, Wistar rats were exposed to fullerene agglomerates (diameter: 96 +/- 5 nm; 0.12 +/- 0.03 mg/m3; 6 hours/days for 5 days/week) for 4 weeks and were sacrificed at 3 days, 1 month, and 3 months after the end of exposure. The inflammatory responses and gene expression of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractants (CINCs) were examined in rat lungs in both studies.In the intratracheal instillation study, both the 0.1 mg and 0.2 mg fullerene groups did not show a significant increase of the total cell and neutrophil count in BALF or in the expression of CINC-1,-2alphabeta and-3 in the lung, while the high-dose, 1 mg group only showed a transient significant increase of neutrophils and expression of CINC-1,-2alphabeta and -3. In the inhalation study, there were no increases of total cell and neutrophil count in BALF, CINC-1,-2alphabeta and-3 in the fullerene group.These data in intratracheal instillation and inhalation studies suggested that well-dispersed fullerenes do not have strong potential of neutrophil inflammation.",

Wistar Hannover rats were intratracheally administered 0.2\u00a0mg (0.66\u00a0mg/kg) and 1.0\u00a0mg (3.3\u00a0mg/kg) of well-dispersed TiO nanoparticles (P90; diameter of agglomerates: 25\u00a0nm), then the pulmonary inflammation responses were examined from 3\u00a0days to 6\u00a0months after the instillation, and the pathological features were examined up to 24\u00a0months. Transient inflammation and the upregulation of chemokines in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid were observed for 1\u00a0month. No respiratory tumors or severe fibrosis were observed during the recovery time. These data suggest that transient inflammation induced by TiO may not lead to chronic, irreversible legions in the lung, and that TiO nanoparticles may not have a high potential for lung disorder.",

Nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiO) and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2) were used as chemicals with high and low toxicities, respectively. In the intratracheal instillation study, rats were exposed to 0.2 or 1\u2009mg of NiO or TiO2. Cell analysis and chemokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analyzed from 3 days to 6 months following the single intratracheal instillation. In the inhalation study, rats were exposed to inhaled NiO or TiO2 (1.65, 1.84\u2009mg/m(3), respectively) for 4 weeks. The same endpoints were examined from 3 days to 3 months after the end of exposure. Inhalation of NiO induced an increase in the number of neutrophils in BALF and concentrations of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC)-1, CINC-2 and heme oxygenase (HO)-1. Intratracheal instillation of NiO induced persistent inflammation and upregulation of these cytokines was observed in the rats. However, inhalation of TiO2 did not induce pulmonary inflammation, and intratracheal instillation of TiO2 transiently induced an increase in the number of neutrophils in BALF and the concentrations of CINC-1, CINC-2 and HO-1. Taken together, a difference in pulmonary inflammation was observed between the high and low toxicity nanomaterials in the intratracheal instillation studies, as in the inhalation studies, suggesting that intratracheal instillation studies may be useful for ranking the harmful effects of nanoparticles.",

F344 rats were received intratracheal instillation at 0.2 or 1 mg of ZnO nanoparticles with a primary diameter of 35 nm that were well-dispersed in distilled water. Cell analysis and chemokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analyzed at three days, one week, one month, three months, and six months after the instillation. As the inhalation study, rats were exposed to a concentration of inhaled ZnO nanoparticles (2 and 10 mg/m\u00b3) for four weeks (6 h/day, 5 days/week). The same endpoints as in the intratracheal instillation study were analyzed at three days, one month, and three months after the end of the exposure. In the intratracheal instillation study, both the 0.2 and the 1.0 mg ZnO groups had a transient increase in the total cell and neutrophil count in the BALF and in the expression of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC)-1, CINC-2, chemokine for neutrophil, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an oxidative stress marker, in the BALF. In the inhalation study, transient increases in total cell and neutrophil count, CINC-1,-2 and HO-1 in the BALF were observed in the high concentration groups. Neither of the studies of ZnO nanoparticles showed persistent inflammation in the rat lung, suggesting that well-dispersed ZnO nanoparticles have low toxicity. ",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study is whether or not cerium dioxide (CeO 2 ) nanoparticle has the pulmonary toxicity. We performed inhalation and intratracheal instillation studies using same sample of cerium oxide nanoparticles, and examined the pulmonary inflammation in both studies. In intratracheal instillation study, rats were exposed to 0.2 mg or 1 mg of CeO 2 . In inhalation study, rats were exposed to inhaled CeO 2  ( 2.1 mg/m 3 ; low concentration, 10.2 mg/m 3 ; high concentration ) for 4 weeks ( 6 hours/day, 5 days/week). Cell analysis and chemokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analyzed at 3 days, 1month and 3 months after end of exposure in both studies.  Inhalation studies showed that neutrophil number was increased in BALF of low and high concentration groups, and peaked on the 1 month. Intratracheal instillation studies also showed that neutrophil number in BALF was increased, reached a peak level of 1 week, and returned to negative control level at 6 months. If these endpoints of inflammation data by CeO 2  nanoparticle were compared with previous data by nickel oxide nanoparticle (high inflammatory potentials) and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (low inflammatory potentials), the level of inflammation by CeO 2  nanoparticle was approximately between nickel oxide and titanium dioxide nanoparticles. Taken together, we suggested that the inflammatory potentials of CeO 2  nanoparticle may be intermediate.

        "abstract": "Previously we reported that nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiO) induced pulmonary inflammation of rat by intratracheal instillation. The objective of this study is to identify new genes which is useful for evaluating pulmonary inflammation induced by NiO. Rats were exposed to 0.2mg or 1mg of NiO and total RNAs were isolated from lung at 3 days, 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months after the end of exposure. Analysis of cDNA microarray was performed with total RNA at 1 month after the end of exposure and revealed that 450 kinds of mRNAs were up-regulated over 2 times and 388 kinds of mRNAs were down-regulated compared with control. Among up-regulated 450 mRNAs, 16 kinds of mRNAs were up-regulated over 8 times. Six of 16 kinds of mRNAs (Ccl2,Ccl7,Cxcl-5,Cxcl-10,Cxcl-11 and Mmp12) were involved in inflammation and investigated until 24 months post-exposure by real-time PCR. Expression peak is different in each gene, but gene expression levels of Ccl2,Ccl7,Cxcl-10 and Cxcl-11 were decreased to almost same level of control and those of Cxcl-5 and Mmp12 were continuously up-regulated until 24 months. These 6 genes might be useful markers for evaluation of pulmonary inflammation by nickel oxide nanoparticles.

        "abstract": "Inhalation studies are the gold standard for the estimation of the harmful effects of respirable chemical substances, while there is limited evidence of the harmful effects of chemical substances by intratracheal instillation. We reviewed the effectiveness of intratracheal instillation studies for estimating the hazards of nanoparticles, mainly using papers in which both inhalation and intratracheal instillation studies were performed using the same nanoparticles. Compared to inhalation studies, there is a tendency in intratracheal instillation studies that pulmonary inflammation lasted longer in the lungs. A difference in pulmonary inflammation between high and low toxicity nanoparticles was observed in the intratracheal instillation studies, as in the inhalation studies. Among the endpoints of pulmonary toxicity, the kinetics of neutrophil counts, percentage of neutrophils, and chemokines for neutrophils and macrophages, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), reflected pulmonary inflammation, suggesting that these markers may be considered the predictive markers of pulmonary toxicity in both types of study. When comparing pulmonary inflammation between intratracheal instillation and inhalation studies under the same initial lung burden, there is a tendency that the inflammatory response following the intratracheal instillation of nanoparticles is greater than or equal to that following the inhalation of nanoparticles. If the difference in clearance in both studies is not large, the estimations of pulmonary toxicity are close. We suggest that intratracheal instillation studies can be useful for ranking the hazard of nanoparticles through pulmonary inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Carbon black aggregate size and shape affects its performance in many applications. In this interlaboratory comparison, an industry reference carbon black, SRB8, was analysed with a protocol based on ASTM D3849-14a, a method for morphological characterization of carbon black aggregates using electron microscopy. Multiple descriptor types (size, elongation, ruggedness, plus those of ASTM D3849-14a) were assessed for repeatability, reproducibility, and measurement uncertainties. Carbon black aggregates have been characterized using descriptor correlations: two important such correlations are affinity coefficients and fractal exponents. SRB8 aggregates appear to be self-affine, i.e., their width and length descriptors scale anisotropically. ASTM D3849-14a derived descriptors have low interlaboratory reproducibilities and high measurement uncertainties. When these descriptors are used for projected area-based fractal analysis, the estimated fractal exponents do not have realistic values. However, the use of an average nodule diameter generated self-consistent values of fractal exponents with measurement uncertainties of about 9%. Carbon black aggregates can be categorized using shape descriptors into the categories: spheroidal, ellipsoidal, branched, and linear. These shape categories contribute non-uniformly to descriptor values across their data ranges and lead to multimodal distributions. These findings illustrate the importance of assessing data quality and measurement uncertainty for particle size and shape distributions.",

        "abstract": "Extraction of true, 3D shape (and size) of non-spherical nanoparticles (NPs) is associated with errors by conventional 2D electron microscopy using projection images. Significant efforts within the ISO technical committee TC 229 \u2018Nanotechnologies\u2019 are aimed at establishing accurate TEM and SEM measurement of NP size and shape as robust, standard procedures. Study groups have been organizing inter-laboratory comparisons on well-selected NP systems according to the market needs, such as aggregated titania nano-powder for which size and shape distribution of primary crystallites of irregular shape must be measured accurately. To be noticed is e. g. the fact that the measurement procedure allows only manual selection of the particles clearly distinguishable for analysis as well as manual definition of the contour of the imaged NPs.An inter-laboratory exercise on titania NPs (pure anatase, grown by hydrothermal synthesis) of well-defined non-spherical shape, i.e. bipyramidal has been recently started within ISO/TC 229 under similar conditions as for the irregular shaped titania. Overlapped particles were allowed to be considered, as long as they are clearly distinguishable. One decisive NP selection criterion was to analyze only those NPs with a roundness value below 0.7, i.e. the NPs laying on the support foil and, hence, with projection areas clearly deviating from perfect circles (R=1). The overall evaluation (for 15 labs) of the size descriptors (area, Feret, minFeret, perimeter) and shape descriptors (aspect ratio, roundness, compactness, extent) by analysis of variance is just to be finished and included in ISO/WD 21363 Nanotechnologies -- Protocol for particle size distribution by transmission electron microscopy.",

The method is intended for making a test-sample for evaluating the toxicities of nanomaterial by intra-tracheal administration. The method can wet the surface of hydrophobic nanomaterial within a few seconds. After the wetting process five to ten minutes of sonication assisted with manual stirring can fully disperse the hydrophobic nanomaterials in water. Two types of TiO2 nanomaterial were used in this study; Tayca JMT-150IB whose surfaces are coated with negatively charged hydrophobic functional group, and P25 whose surfaces are naturally hydrophilic. Nanomaterials are aerosolized by a dry-method and become micrometer-sized agglomerates. Then supersaturated water vapor is condensed onto these airborne agglomerates by using a growth tube collector. The collected suspension (CS) of hydrophobic nanomaterial (JMT-150IB) is prepared in two steps; airborne agglomerates a...",

        "abstract": "We have investigated the downward flame spread over a thin solid fuel. Hydrogen, methane, or propane, included in the gaseous product of pyrolysis reaction, is added in the ambient air. The fuel concentration is kept below the lean flammability limit to observe the partially premixing effect. Both experimental and numerical studies have been conducted. Results show that, in partially premixed atmospheres, both blue flame and luminous flame regions are enlarged, and the flame spread rate is increased. Based on the flame index, a so-called triple flame is observed. The heat release rate ahead of the original diffusion flame is increased by adding the fuel, and its profile is moved upstream. Here, we focus on the heat input by adding the fuel in the opposed air, which could be a direct factor to intensify the combustion reaction. The dependence of the flame spread rate on the heat input is almost the same for methane and propane/air mixtures, but larger effect is observed for hydrogen/air mixture. Since the deficient reactant in lean mixture is fuel, the larger effect of hydrogen could be explained based on the Lewis number consideration. That is, the combustion is surely intensified for all cases, but this effect is larger for lean hydrogen/air mixture (Le < 1), because more fuel diffuses toward the lean premixed flame ahead of the original diffusion flame. Resultantly, the pyrolysis reaction is promoted to support the higher flame spread rate. Keywords Flame spread Solid fuel Partially premixed flame Flame index Lewis number",

        "abstract": "To reduce particulate matters (PM) in diesel exhaust gas, stricter exhaust emission standards such as Euro V are being set in many countries. Recently, for the after-treatment of exhaust gas, a diesel particulate filter (DPF) has been developed. Latest researches have shown that DPF filtration efficiency can be as high as 99%. However, the filter would be plugged with particles to cause an increase of filter back-pressure, which must be kept at lower levels, because the higher back-pressure increases fuel consumption and reduces available torque. Here, we are focusing on NO x -soot conversion system. There are two stages for PM oxidation. At the first step, the catalyst oxidizes NO in exhaust gas into NO 2 . At the next step, NO 2 reacts with soot to produce CO and CO 2 . However, the reaction rate and quantitative effect of NO 2 on soot oxidation is not clear, because it is difficult to observe small-scale phenomena in DPF experimentally, and there is not enough information on the PM oxidation. In this study, we simulated the above two-stage system. In the first part, the reaction with Pt catalyst for the oxidation of NO to NO 2 was simulated in non-porous flow-through filter. The catalytic reaction mechanism was discussed. In the second part, we simulated the flow in wall-flow filter to confirm the effectiveness of regeneration process by NO 2 in the real cordierite DPF.",

Since it is difficult to examine the local flow or temperature field in porous media experimentally,\n we try to simulate combustion flow. Two-phase Automaton is applied to produce the porous structure based on these particle\n behaviors. The porosity and tortuosity are freely changed by the profiles of the two-phase interface.

        "abstract": "To simulate the flow in a three-dimensional porous structure, we have used the Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The distribution functions for flow, temperature, and concentration fields are solved to simulate the regeneration process of diesel particulate filter (DPF). For a benchmark study, we have conducted the calculation in simple geometry. To change the flow characteristics such as porosity and tortuosity, obstacles of different number and size are selected, which are randomly placed in the duct. The flow pattern is changed with obstacle size even at the same porosity. To confirm the validity of our calculation, the results are compared with the empirical relationships of the Blake\u2013Kozeny and Ergun equations, in the non-dimensional form using the Ergun coordinates of Reynolds number and friction factor. Numerical results show good agreements with the empirical predictions. Soot combustion is well simulated to show the effects of oxygen on the reaction rate. Finally, the real porous geometry has been tested. The porous structure of Ni\u2013Cr metal has been obtained by the three-dimensional computer tomography technique. Results show that the inhomogeneous flow is observed, and there are regions where the temperature is locally higher. This information is indispensable for the better design of DPF. LBM can be a good tool for combustion simulation in porous media.",

        "abstract": "Gas turbines, liquid rocket motors, and oil-fired furnaces utilize the spray combustion of continuously injected liquid fuels. In most cases, the liquid spray is mixed with an oxidizer prior to combustion, and further oxidizer is supplied from the outside of the spray to complete diffusion combustion. This rich premixed spray is called \u201cpartially premixed spray.\u201d Partially premixed sprays have not been studied systematically although they are of practical importance. In the present study, the burning behavior of partially premixed sprays was experimentally studied with a newly developed spray burner. A fuel spray and an oxidizer, diluted with nitrogen, was injected into the air. The overall equivalence ratio of the spray jet was set larger than unity to establish partially premixed spray combustion. In the present burner, the mean droplet diameter of the atomized liquid fuel could be varied without varying the overall equivalence ratio of the spray jet. Two combustion modes with and without an internal flame were observed. As the mean droplet diameter was increased or the overall equivalence ratio of the spray jet was decreased, the transition from spray combustion only with an external group flame to that with the internal premixed flame occurred. The results suggest that the internal flame was supported by flammable mixture through the vaporization of fine droplets, and the passage of droplet clusters deformed the internal flame and caused internal flame oscillation. The existence of the internal premixed flame enhanced the vaporization of droplets in the post-premixed-flame zone within the external diffusion flame.",

The coannular burner consists of three concentric tubes, where air flows in both inner (central) and outer tubes, and fuel flows in the annulus between these air tubes. In order to investigate the combustion characteristics in the triple port burner, the liftoff height and concentrations of soot and NO x were experimentally examined. A numerical simulation was also conducted to discuss the flame structure in detail. Since two non-premixed flames are formed in the boundaries of fuel and air, there are four flame configurations, consisting of attached flames, inner attached/outer lifted flames, inner lifted/outer attached flames, and twin lifted flames. By increasing the external air flow velocity, unique flame behaviors are observed, including (1) inner flame re-attachment and (2) flip-flop between inner and outer flames. When the flame is lifted, the maximum soot concentration and NO x emission are decreased. Based on the flame index, the attached flame is mainly a diffusion flame. When the inner or outer flame is lifted, the so-called triple flame structure is observed. Interestingly, in the case of twin lifted flames, two rich premixed flames are merged each other.",

        "abstract": "As for gasoline vehicles, the particulate matter (PM) emissions from traditional port fuel injection (PFI) engines are pretty low. Recently, the gasoline direct injection (GDI) vehicles have been gaining market share globally due to better fuel efficiency, especially in the European countries. A drawback associated with GDI engines is considerably higher PM emissions compared with PFI engines. The soot in gasoline exhaust gas would contribute to urban air pollution, which is deeply related with adverse health effects. For the reduction of PM emission in Europe, a new regulation known as EURO VI has been set recently. Then, we need to trap soot particles in exhaust gas from gasoline automobiles as well as diesel automobiles. However, the gasoline soot would be much smaller than the diesel soot. Also, the gasoline exhaust gas temperature is much higher. Then, we need gasoline particulate filter (GPF) which needs to have better thermal durability. In this study, as a potential GPF, an SiC fiber filter was numerically examined. The effect of the fiber diameter on the filtration was revealed. Results show that, when the filter of the larger fiber diameter is placed more upstream, the deposition of soot particles widely occurs inside the filter, resulting in the lower pressure drop.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In order to decrease the regeneration temperature of diesel soot deposited in the diesel particulate filter (DPF), the catalyzed DPF is generally used. Since the catalyst is made of expensive noble metals such as platinum, it is better to reduce the amount of catalyst. For that purpose, we need to know the influence of the catalyst on the soot deposition process. In this study, the flow and the soot deposition of the catalyzed DPF (CDPF) have been simulated. The substrate structure of the filter was obtained by an X-ray CT technique. Here, two types of the catalyst coating were considered, which were in-wall and on-wall CDPFs. For both cases, we set the same amount of catalyst. The effects of the catalyst on the pressure drop were evaluated by comparing the simulation without the catalyst. The permeability of the catalyst layer was estimated based on the experimental pressure drop. In particular, the contact ratio of the deposited soot and the catalyst layer was discussed to obtain the information on the regeneration efficiency. It was found that, due to the catalyst, the soot deposition process was affected. Resultantly, the pressure drop of the on-wall CDPF was smaller than that of the in-wall CDPF. In the case of the on-wall CDPF, more deposited soot can be contacted with the catalyst layer, suggesting the higher efficiency for the filter regeneration.",

        "abstract": "When a fire breaks out in a tunnel, smoke diffuses widely in the direction of the ventilation airflow. As a result, the evacuation environment may not be sufficiently safe during a fire incident. When ventilation equipment in a tunnel is changed, the safety and economic efficiency of the new ventilation equipment must be evaluated in advance. However, it is dangerous and not financially feasible to undertake the verification of new ventilation equipment by performing a demonstration experiment owing to its cost and versatility. It is therefore useful for predicting an evacuation situation in which a fire breaks out in a tunnel by performing a numerical simulation and examining the evacuation safety of the tunnel. In this study, a tunnel fire was reproduced using the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) fire simulation software. Moreover, an evacuation was simulated using the real-coded cellular automaton (RCA) method and the effects of the wind velocity and the number of evacuees in the tunnel on the evacuation time were examined.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, for filtration of gasoline particulates, we tested SiC fibers potentially applied for a gasoline particulate filter (GPF). Carbon particles were used as model soot. Focusing on the porosity and the fiber diameter, the filtration efficiency and the pressure drop were examined. To promote the carbon oxidation, the fiber was coated with the Pt-catalyst. Results show that, by reducing the porosity, the filtration efficiency increases, but the pressure drop across the filter (filter backpressure) becomes larger. When the porosity is lower than 0.94, the improvement of filtration efficiency is not enough. Secondary, when the fiber with smaller diameter is adopted by keeping the porosity constant, the filtration efficiency is found to increase. Especially, the combination of 18, 14, 10 \u00b5m fiber sheets exhibits more efficient filtration performance without increasing the pressure drop. As for the continuous regenerating trap (CRT), the oxidation of carbon particles starts around 420\u202f\u00b0C, and more carbon particles are oxidized at higher temperature. At 600\u202f\u00b0C, the pressure drop can be kept smaller, because a part of deposited particles is continuously oxidized. At 800\u202f\u00b0C, the filtration efficiency is worsened with the larger pressure drop. From the above experimental data, the CRT at 600\u202f\u00b0C is suitable. When the fiber surface is coated with Pt catalyst, the oxidation of carbon particles starts at 250\u202f\u00b0C. When the temperature is higher than 330\u202f\u00b0C, the pressure drop of the catalyzed filter is even smaller than that of the non-catalyzed filter. It is concluded that the coating of catalysts is effective for reducing the pressure drop as well as the oxidation temperature.",

        "abstract": "We previously showed that diabetes contributes to the development of sclerotic lesions in cerebral arteries. In this study, we attempted to clarify whether differences in heart rate variability in non-hypertensive diabetic patients were dependent on the presence or absence of underlying cerebrovascular disease. Thirty diabetic subjects between 40 and 59 years of age and who had no prior history of hypertension were used in this study. Lacunar lesions (LA) were detected with magnetic resonance imaging and atherosclerotic lesions (AS) were detected using intra- and extracranial magnetic resonance angiography, and by ultrasonographic scanning of the carotid artery. Patients underwent a full clinical laboratory screening and a power spectrum analysis of their heart rate variability. Subjects were divided into two groups: those with and without LA. The low frequency/high frequency ratio (LF/HF ratio) was found to be significantly increased (P<0.01) in subjects with LA (2.2 +/- 0.3) compared to those without LA (1.3 +/- 0.1). When subjects were divided into groups based on their presence or absence of AS, high-frequency power was found to be significantly reduced (P<0.05) in the subjects with AS (12.8 +/- 3.4 ms) compared to those without AS (19.4 +/- 1.7 ms). The LF/HF ratio was found to be significantly increased (P<0.05) in the subjects with AS (2.2 +/- 0.3) compared to those without AS (1.4 +/- 0.1). Our data suggested that atherosclerotic lesions in cerebrovascular diseased linked to decrease of vagal nerve activity in non-hypertensive diabetic patients.",

A total of 60.4 Gy of radiation was delivered, starting from the day of BOAI.Forty-one patients (30 males and 11 females, aged 55-98 years) were enrolled and assessable for toxicity and response. None of the patients suffered grade II or more severe toxicities; some experienced grade I blood/bone marrow toxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, or neuropathy. All patients with histologically confirmed transitional cell carcinoma stage T2 or T3 (29 patients) achieved a complete response and were able to retain their bladder with no evidence of recurrent disease or distant metastasis at a mean follow-up of 132 weeks (range 8-648 weeks) after therapy. Patients with stage T4 tumors, besides transitional cell carcinoma, or lymph node involvement had stable or progressive disease.This therapy is a new strategy for patients with locally advanced bladder cancer. It can be a curative treatment not only in patients for whom total cystectomy is indicated, but also in patients whose condition is not amenable to curative treatment and for whom merely palliative treatment would otherwise seem the only option.",

        "abstract": "Hepatic pseudolymphoma (HPL) and primary hepatic marginal zone B cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) are rare diseases and the differential diagnosis between these two entities is sometimes difficult. We herein report a 56-year-old Japanese woman who was pointed out to have a space occupying lesion in the left lateral segment of the liver. Hepatitis viral-associated antigen/antibody was negative and liver function tests including lactic dehydrogenase, peripheral blood count, tumor markers and soluble interleukin-2 receptor were all within normal limit. Imaging study using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were not typical for hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, or other metastatic cancer. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography examination integrated with computed tomography scanning showed high standardized uptake value in the solitary lesion in the liver. Under a diagnosis of primary liver neoplasm, laparoscopic-assisted lateral segmentectomy was performed. Liver tumor of maximal 1.0 cm in diameter was consisted of aggregation of lymphocytes of predominantly B-cell, containing multiple lymphocyte follicles positive for CD10 and bcl-2, consistent with a diagnosis of HPL rather than MALT lymphoma, although a definitive differentiation was pending. The background liver showed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/early non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The patient is currently doing well with no sign of relapse 13 months after the surgery. Since the accurate diagnosis is difficult, laparoscopic approach would provide a reasonable procedure of diagnostic and therapeutic advantage with minimal invasiveness for patients. Considering that the real nature of this entity remains unclear, vigilant follow-up of patient is essential.",

In each patient, both shaded surface display(SSD) and MTD images were generated by using an Xtension with a Sun SPARCstation 20, and they were compared by two radiologists. MTD image quality was superior to that of SSD images, because MTD diminished longitudinal direction artifacts and the image depicted the small vessels clearly. Based on the above results, we consider MTD to be a useful method for 3D-CT angiography of the splenic-portal venous system.",

Surgical intervention would be required in selected cases of this clinical entity.",

We describe an exacerbation of thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) following thyroid artery embolization in a woman with GD and mild stable TAO (NOSPECS classification, class I grade a). A 45-year-old woman with GD and inactive TAO, in whom thyroid function was stable following blockade of hormone release combined with replacement therapy, underwent embolization of three thyroid arteries. Initially, there were neither adverse effects nor complications; however, the patient developed severe TAO (NOSPECS classification, class IV grade b) 3 months after the arterial embolization. Steroid pulse treatments followed by total thyroidectomy resulted in improvement of the eye signs and symptoms. The clinical course and the serial changes of the thyroglobulin and thyroglobulin-antibody titers suggested that the destruction of thyroid follicles, induced by the arterial embolization, triggered the exacerbation of her TAO. Our experience argues for the use of caution when arterial embolization is considered for GD patients with even the mildest TAO (NOSPECS classification, class I).",

CT showed subtle osteolytic and osteosclerotic changes with surrounding soft tissue density mass. MRI clearly showed abnormal signal intensity in the bone marrow. After systemic chemotherapy and infield radiotherapy, the patient showed clinically complete remission. MRI showed reduction of the extraosseous components, but there was little signal change in the bone marrow despite the clinical response to the therapy. Scintigrams were more useful than MRI and CT for both staging and assessing the early response to therapy. The soluble interleukin-2 receptor level was found to be related to tumor cell activity.",

        "abstract": "We report a very rare case of acute abdomen caused by torsion of an accessory spleen that was preoperatively diagnosed and cured by single-port surgery. A 31-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with severe left abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed a left upper quadrant abdominal tenderness with voluntary guarding. Ultrasound demonstrated a well-defined round mass isoechoic to the spleen, measuring 3.0\u00a0cm in diameter in the left upper quadrant adjacent to the spleen. A contrast-enhanced CT scan showed a normally enhanced spleen and a 3.0\u2009\u00d7\u20093.0, hypodense, non-enhancing mass anterior to the spleen with a twisted funicular structure. Torsion of an accessory spleen was suspected, and emergency single-port surgery was performed. During surgery, a rounded violet mass measuring 3.0\u00a0cm in diameter, suggestive of an accessory spleen, with a 1800\u00b0 torsion around a long vascular pedicle along the left side of the greater omentum was discovered. The mass was removed and post-operative recovery was uneventful. A review of the literature revealed 26 cases (including ours) of torsion of an accessory spleen in English. Even with the recent advances in radiologic imaging modalities, making a preoperative diagnosis of this is difficult and most cases are diagnosed during laparotomy. This is the first report preoperatively diagnosed and cured by single-port surgery. We decided to start the operation by using a single port, not only for cosmetic reasons for this young female patient, but also for final confirmation of our diagnosis. We believe that single-port laparoscopy is valuable as a diagnostic tool as long as safety is assured for patients with acute abdomen. Although torsion of an accessory spleen is extremely rare, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in children and young adults. ",

        "abstract": "We tested the usefulness of balloon-occluded arterial infusion (BOAI) of anticancer agent (cisplatin/gemcitabine), concomitant with hemodialysis, which delivers an extremely high concentration of anticancer agent to the site of a tumor without systemic adverse effects, along with concurrent radiation [Osaka-Medical College (OMC)-regimen] in patients with locally advanced bladder cancer. The results were compared with those of cystectomy.One hundred twenty-four patients were assigned to receive cystectomy (Gp1, n = 62) or OMC-regimen (Gp2, n = 62). In Gp2, patients besides undergoing complete response subsequently received secondary-BOAI with gemcitabine (1600 mg).In Gp1, 27 of 62 patients (43.5%) suffered disease recurrence, and more than half died within 1 year; the remainder died thereafter. The overall 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates were 53.8%, 46.0%, and 40.0%, respectively. In contrast, in Gp2, >70% of patients (44 of 62), especially >95% of patients with locally invasive tumors achieved complete response with no evidence of recurrent disease or metastasis after a mean follow-up of 163 (range, 32-736) weeks. At 14 years, overall survival was significantly improved at 79.7% (P = 0.015 vs. Gp1). Moreover, salvage therapy for secondary-BOAI with gemcitabine was effective in all 3 patients with T4 tumors or lymph node involvement, who showed stable disease (SD) after primary therapy with CDDP. No patients suffered Grade III or more severe toxicities.OMC-regimen, a new strategy for patients with locally-invasive bladder cancer, can be curative not only in patients for whom cystectomy is indicated, but also in patients whose condition is not amenable to curative treatment and for whom merely palliative treatment would otherwise seem the only option.",

        "abstract": "Overall, >900 patients have been treated at Osaka Medical College (Takatsuki, Osaka, Japan) using the novel approach of balloon-occluded arterial infusion (BOAI) to deliver an extremely high concentration of the anticancer agents cisplatin (CDDP)/gemcitabine to the pelvis (referred to as the OMC-regimen), together with pelvic irradiation. In a previous study, overall survival\u00a0(OS) rate was significantly higher in this treatment group compared with that in a control group receiving total cystectomy (79.6 vs. 49.6%, respectively, at 10\u00a0years). It was speculated that intensive treatment of the pelvic area may aid in preventing metastasis, and thus the present study focused on the effect of this therapy in patients with lymph node metastasis (LN+). A total of 102\u00a0patients with advanced LN+ bladder cancer received tetramodal therapy (termed the Azuma regimen), comprising radical transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, systemic chemotherapy, BOAI and pelvic irradiation. Patients who failed to achieve a complete response\u00a0(CR) underwent secondary BOAI with an increased amount of CDDP and/or gemcitabine with/without hemodialysis. A CR was achieved in 57.8% (59/102) of patients in total, and in 78.8%\u00a0(41/52) of patients with N1 and Tis-3 disease. Among the complete responders, 81.4%\u00a0(48/59) of patients retained their bladders with no evidence of recurrence or metastasis within a mean follow-up period of 121\u00a0weeks. Stages N2-3 and T4 were determined as significant risk factors for treatment failure in addition to survival. Notably, the 10-year overall survival rates in N1, Tis-3, and N1 and Tis-3 were 67.6% (vs. 33.6% in N2-3; P=0.0003), 61.5% (vs.\u00a037.9% in T4; P=0.0485) and 75.1% (vs. 35.5% in N2-3 or T4; P=0.0002), respectively. No patients suffered from grade\u00a0IV toxicities. In conclusion, the Azuma regimen may be a feasible option for patients with LN+ disease. The use of intensive treatment in the pelvic area may serve an important role in outcome improvement, and the prevention of metastasis may be its mechanism.",

On fast imaging employing steady state precession (FIESTA) sequence images, a marked difference was observed in the diameters of the right and left ovarian veins. The right ovarian vein was torturous and dilated, measuring 35 mm in diameter, while the left ovarian vein was thin and linear, measuring 7 mm in diameter. The left ovary showed no apparent swelling or hemorrhage, but was suspected to have been shifted anteriorly. The patient underwent explorative laparotomy and was found to have left ovarian torsion.

The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the anatomy of the ureter near the ureterovesical junction on preoperative CT. Methods: Forty patients were analyzed the craniocaudal level of the ureterovesical junction, the transverse distance from the medial line of the body to the ureterovesical junction, the direction of the ureter from the ureterovesical junction, and the length of the ureter from the point of turning medially to the ureterovesical junction. Results: The ureterovesical junction was almost at the level of the upper or middle of the left femoral head. The mean transverse distance on the right and left side was 19.0 and 19.3 mm. The direction of the ureter was almost posterior, lateral, and cranial, but had a wide range of angles. The mean length of the ureter on the right and left side was 24.0 and 23.9 mm. Conclusions: We can evaluate the anatomy of the ureter near the ureterovesical junction on preoperative CT.",

        "abstract": "According to the sentinel node biopsy (SNB), systematic pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) may not be needed for patients with early-stage endometrial cancer. On the other hand, imaging technology including fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) has been developing worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the combined diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET/CT and SNB in the prediction of pelvic lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer patients.One hundred twenty-one patients with endometrial cancer underwent FDG PET/CT before hysterectomy and received SNB followed by systematic PLND. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET/CT and SNB in the prediction of pelvic node metastasis to the ultimate histologic status.FDG PET/CT had lower sensitivity (36.8% versus 57.9%, P\u200a=\u200a.1) and a higher specificity (96.4% versus 84.8%, P\u200a<\u200a.01) than SNB. The kappa statistics of FDG PET/CT and SNB were 0.37 (95% CI, 0.15-0.59) and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.53-0.90), respectively. The sensitivity of SNB was significantly higher than that of FDG PET/CT in all hemi-pelvises (HPs) in which the short axis of the largest metastatic lymph node was <5\u200amm in diameter (72.7% versus 18.2%, P\u200a=\u200a.01). In contrast, the sensitivity of FDG PET/CT was higher than that of SNB in all HPs in which the short axis of the largest metastatic lymph node was \u22655\u200amm in diameter (62.5% versus 37.5%, P\u200a=\u200a.2); however, the difference was not statistically significant. When the combined diagnosis of FDG PET/CT and SNB was made, the sensitivity and specificity were 84.2% and 82.1%, respectively.SNB was more useful for detecting lymph node metastasis than FDG PET/CT, especially in patients with small metastatic lymph nodes. The combined diagnosis of FDG PET/CT and SNB improves the sensitivity; PET-positive nodes should be dissected regardless of SNB status and HPs in which SNB was not detected should be dissected systematically regardless of FDG PET/CT status.",

        "title": "Placement of a novel fully covered metallic stent for refractory pancreatic duct stricture",
        "abstract": "Plastic stent placement under endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is performed widely for the treatment of benign pancreatic stricture [1]. However, this techniquemay have several disadvantages such as short stent patency and persistent stricture compared with fully covered metallic stents (FCMS) [2,3]. Therefore, although FCMS placement for benign pancreatic stricture is still controversial as a result of a relatively high rate of stent migration (especially distal migration), the FCMS has a potential clinical impact in patients with symptomatic chronic pancreatitis. This report describes the placement of a novel FCMS (6mm\u00d76cm, Niti-S Biliary S-Type Stent Long Suture; TaeWoong Medical, Seoul, Korea; Century Medical Inc., Tokyo, Japan) in patients with chronic pancreatitiswho have refractory pancreatic duct stricture (\u25cf Fig.1). This novel FCMShas a long removal suture, and therefore, if distal stent migration doesoccur, the stent can be removedeasily by grasping the suture thread. A 66-year-old man was admitted to the Osaka Medical College Hospital with abdominal pain caused by pancreatic stent occlusion. He had undergone placement of a 10-Fr plastic stent 1 month earlier for pancreatic duct stricture caused by chronic pancreatitis. Despite several stent exchanges, the pancreatic duct stricture persisted. Therefore, it was decided to place a novel FCMS. First, the plastic stent was removed, and contrast medium was injected into the main pancreatic duct. A pancreatic duct stricture of the pancreatic head was seen (\u25cf Fig.2). Next, the novel metallic stent delivery system (8Fr) was inserted through the stenosis site (\u25cf Fig.3), and the stent was successfully placed (\u25cf Fig.4, \u25cf Video 1). No adverse events occurred and the patient was discharged. After 6 months, no late adverse events, including stent migration, were observed. This stent may be a safer device because if the stent migrates it can be retrieved easily by grasping the long suture thread. However, results from a prospective study with long term follow-up are needed to confirm this.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of pelvic lymph node metastasis for fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) and sentinel node biopsy (SNB) of cervical cancer patients.Forty-eight patients with cervical cancer were imaged with FDG PET/CT before radical hysterectomy and underwent an SNB followed by systematic pelvic lymph node dissection. The diagnostic accuracy for predicting pelvic node metastases for FDG PET/CT and SNB compared with the ultimate histologic status was analyzed.Among 96 hemi-pelvises (HPs) in 48 patients, pelvic lymph node metastases were obtained in 12 HPs. The sensitivity of pelvic node metastases for FDG PET/CT and SNB was 8.3% and 75.0%, respectively. The specificity for FDG PET/CT and SNB was 97.6% and 94.0%, respectively. The negative predictive value for FDG-PET/CT and SNB was 88.2% and 100%, respectively.SNB is more suitable for detecting pelvic node metastases than FDG PET/CT. The omission of systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy should be considered based on the findings of SNB, not FDG PET/CT.",

Using this deconvolution technique, the amplitude of the\nmultipole power spectrum is corrected.

Dynamical dark energy models may have similar\nexpansion rates as models of modified gravity, yet predict different growth of\nstructure histories. We parameterize the cosmic expansion by the two\nparameters, $w_0$ and $w_a$, and the linear growth rate of density fluctuations\nby Linder's $\\gamma$, independently. Dark energy models generically predict\n$\\gamma \\approx 0.55$, while the DGP model $\\gamma \\approx 0.68$. To determine\nif future imaging surveys can constrain $\\gamma$ within 20 percent (or\n$\\Delta\\gamma<0.1$), we perform the Fisher matrix analysis for a weak lensing\nsurvey such as the on-going Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) project. Under the\ncondition that the total observation time is fixed, we compute the Figure of\nMerit (FoM) as a function of the exposure time $\\texp$. We find that the\ntomography technique effectively improves the FoM, which has a broad peak\naround $\\texp\\simeq {\\rm several}\\sim 10$ minutes; a shallow and wide survey is\npreferred to constrain the $\\gamma$ parameter. While $\\Delta\\gamma < 0.1$\ncannot be achieved by the HSC weak-lensing survey alone, one can improve the\nconstraints by combining with a follow-up spectroscopic survey like WFMOS\nand/or future CMB observations.",

A theoretical formula for the radiation energy is\nderived at the lowest order of the perturbation theory with respect to the\ncoupling constant of the SQED. We evaluate the radiation energy on the\nbackground universe so that the Minkowski spacetime transits to the Milne\nuniverse, in which the equation of motion for the mode function of the free\ncomplex scalar field can be exactly solved in an analytic way. Then, the result\nis compared with the WKB approach, in which the equation of motion of the mode\nfunction is constructed with the WKB approximation which is valid as long as\nthe Compton wavelength is shorter than the Hubble horizon length. This\ndemonstrates that the quantum effect on the Larmor radiation of the order\ne^2\\hbar is determined by a non-local integration in time depending on the\nbackground expansion. We also compare our result with a recent work by Higuchi\nand Walker [Phys. Rev.

To this end we consider a model\ncharacterized by a parameter $n$, which corresponds to the\nDvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model if $n=2$ and reduces to the standard\nspatially flat cosmological constant concordance model for $n$ equal to\ninfinity. We find that the different expansion histories of the modified\ngravity models systematically shifts the peak positions of BAO. A preliminary\nanalysis using the current SDSS LRG sample indicates that the original DGP\nmodel is disfavored unless the matter density parameter exceeds 0.3. The\nconstraints will be strongly tightened with future spectroscopic samples of\ngalaxies at high redshifts. We demonstrate that WFMOS, in collaboration with\nother surveys such as Planck, will powerfully constrain modified gravity\nalternatives to dark energy as the explanation of cosmic acceleration.",

        "abstract": "The three-dimensional distribution of astronomical objects observed in\nredshift space significantly differs from the true distribution since the\ndistance to each object cannot be determined by its redshift $z$ only; for $z\n\\ll 1$ the peculiar velocity field contaminates the true recession velocity of\nthe Hubble flow, while the true distance for objects at $z < 1$ sensitively\ndepends on the (unknown and thus assumed) cosmological parameters. This hampers\nthe effort to understand the true distribution of large-scale structure of the\nuniverse. In addition, all cosmological observations are carried out on a\nlight-cone, the null hypersurface of an observer at $z=0$. This implies that\ntheir intrinsic properties and clustering statistics should change even within\nthe survey volume. Therefore a proper comparison taking account of the\nlight-cone effect is important to extract any cosmological information from\nredshift catalogues, especially for $z < 1$. We present recent theoretical\ndevelopment on the two effects -- the cosmological light-cone effect and the\ncosmological redshift-space distortion -- which should play key roles in\nobservational cosmology in the 21st century.",

In an\nexplicit manner we show that the dissipative coefficient obtained from\nclassical equations of motion of the detector and the scalar (or Dirac) field\nsatisfies the FD relation associated with the vacuum noise of the field, which\ndemonstrates that the Terashima's prescription works properly in the\n$N$-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. This practice is useful not only to\nreconfirm the validity of the use of the retarded Green function to evaluate\nthe dissipative coefficient from the classical equations of motion but also to\nunderstand why the derivation works properly, which is discussed in connection\nwith previous investigations on the basis on the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS)\ncondition.

By extending a theoretical formulation for the redshift-space distortion of galaxies to include the second order terms of the galaxy peculiar velocity $bm v$ and the gravitational potential, we formulate the void-galaxy cross-correlation function multipoles in the redshift space, the monopole $xi_0^{(s)}$, dipole $xi_1^{(s)}$ and quadrupole $xi_2^{(s)}$. We find that the dipole $xi_1^{(s)}$ is dominated by the gravitational redshift, which provides a unique opportunity to detect the gravitational potential of voids. Thus, for the dipole $xi_1^{(s)}(s)$, the higher order effect is crucial. Although this effect is negligible on the monopole $xi_0^{(s)}$, it has an influence on the quadrupole $xi_2^{(s)}$. The effects from the random velocity of galaxies and the definition of the void center on the dipole signal are also discussed. Our model offers a new theoretical probe for detecting gravitational redshift within voids and further tests on cosmology and gravity.",

Behaviors of the multipoles of the bispectrum are compared with results of numerical simulations assuming a halo occupation distribution of the LOWZ sample of the SDSS-III BOSS survey. Also presented are analytic approximate formulas for the multipoles of the bispectrum, which is useful to understanding their characteristic properties.

The redshift-space bispectrum includes the two variables omega and phi for the line-of-sight direction, and the higher multipole bispectra are defined by the coefficients in the expansion of the redshift-space bispectrum using the spherical harmonics Y_{ell}^m(omega,phi). We find 6 new nonvanishing components out of 25 total components up to ell=4, in addition to 3 components discussed in the previous work (monopole, quadruple, and hexadecapole of m=0). The characteristic behaviors of the new nonvanishing multipoles are compared with the results of galaxy mock catalogs that match the halo occupation distribution of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey low-redshift sample. Analytic approximation formulas for these nonzero components are also presented; these are useful for understanding the characteristic behaviors.",

In this scenario, the present universe was created by a bubble nucleation due to quantum tunneling from a metastable ancestor vacuum, followed by a primordial inflationary era. During the bubble nucleation, supercurvature modes of some kind of a scalar field are produced, and remain until present without decaying; thus they can play a role of the dark energy, if the mass of the scalar field is sufficiently light in the present universe. The supercurvature modes fluctuate at a very large spatial scale, much longer than the Hubble length in the present universe. Thus they create large-scale inhomogeneities of the dark energy, and generate large-scale anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations. This is a notable feature of this scenario, where quantum fluctuations of a scalar field are responsible for the dark energy. In this paper, we calculate imprints of the scenario on the CMB anisotropies through the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, and give observational constraints on the curvature parameter $Omega_K$ and on an additional parameter $epsilon$ describing some properties of the ancestor vacuum.",

In this model, because of the modification of dispersion relations, each polarization mode can possess subluminal phase velocities, and the gravitational Cherenkov radiation could be potentially emitted from a relativistic particle. In the present paper, we derive conditions for the process of the gravitational Cherenkov radiation to occur and estimate the energy emission rate for each polarization mode. We found that the gravitational Cherenkov radiation emitted even from an ultrahigh energy cosmic ray is sufficiently suppressed for the gravitonu0027s effective mass less than 100 eV, and the bigravity model with dark matter coupled to the hidden metric is therefore consistent with observations of high energy cosmic rays.",

Quantum radiation is nonvanishing, which is consistent with the previous calculation by Lin and Hu [Phys. Rev. D 73, 124018 (2006)]. We infer that this quantum radiation from the Unruh-De Witt detector is generated by the nonlocal correlation of the Minkowski vacuum state, which has its origin in the entanglement of the state between the left and the right Rindler wedges.",

We find that there exists a non-vanishing quantum radiation at late times in the radiation zone of the conformally flat coordinates, which cover the region behind the cosmological horizon for the accelerated detector. The theoretical structure of producing the late-time quantum radiation is similar to that of the same model in Minkowski spacetime: it comes from a nonlocal correlation of the quantum field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum state, which can be traced back to the entanglement between the field modes defined in different regions in de Sitter spacetime.",

Possible signatures of the gravitational redshift in measurements of satellite galaxies in clusters of galaxies, intracluster gas, as well as galaxies associated with voids are investigated by developing simple theoretical models. In the analysis of the gravitational redshift of satellite galaxies, we develop a very simple analytic model for satellite galaxies virialised in halos, which enables us to evaluate the signals depending on the properties of the halo occupation distribution of galaxies. We obtain results consistent with recent previous results, though our results are restricted to the satellite galaxies inside the virial radius. In the analysis of intracluster gas, we develop a simple analytic model including the effect of random motions of gases, which are assumed to generate nonthermal pressure. We demonstrate a possible contribution of the random motions of gases to the gravitational redshift. We also investigate a possible signature of the gravitational redshift in measurements of galaxies associated with voids, for the first time as far as we know, by utilising a simple analytic model. We show that the second-order Hubble term, which appears in the expansion of the scale factor around the centre of a void, may make a significant contribution depending on the way the galaxy samples are analysed.",

In particular, we find positive-frequency modes for the Bunch-Davies vacuum state natural to the static charts as superpositions of the well-known positive-frequency modes in the conformally-flat chart. We discuss in detail how these modes are defined globally in the two static charts and the region in their future. The global structure of these solutions leads to the well-known description of the Bunch-Davies vacuum state as an entangled state. Our results are expected to be useful not only for studying the thermal properties in the vacuum fluctuations in de Sitter spacetime but also for understanding the nonlocal properties of the vacuum state.",

Because the thermal random motions are regarded to result from the Unruh effect, this quantum radiation is termed Unruh radiation. The energy flux of Unruh radiation is negative and smaller than that of Larmor radiation by one order in a/m, where a is the constant acceleration and m is the mass of the particle. Thus, the Unruh radiation appears to be a suppression of the classical Larmor radiation. The quantum interference effect plays an important role in this unique signature. The results is consistent with the predictions of a model consisting of a particle coupled to a massless scalar field as well as those of the previous studies on the quantum effect on the Larmor radiation.",

Frailty is often accompanied by heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and frailty is likely to affect its clinical features and outcomes. Frail patients with HFpEF are frequently associated with sarcopenia (ie, muscle loss and weakness), which is a major component of the pathophysiology of frailty. Sarcopenia is a systemic skeletal muscle disease that impairs the function of limb skeletal muscles, as well as respiratory muscles, and this results in further functional decline. In addition, sarcopenia may contribute to cardiovascular remodelling and dysfunction, leading to the development of HFpEF through several metabolic and endocrine abnormalities. Although there is no established strategy for frail patients with HFpEF, a multidisciplinary approach, including various types of muscular training and nutritional intervention, may provide beneficial effects for these patients.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between inspiratory muscle weakness (IMW) and exercise intolerance in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains unestablished.The present study enrolled 40 patients with HFpEF (EF \u226545%). IMW was defined as the percentage of maximum inspiratory pressure to normal predicted values <70%. The function of the diaphragm was assessed by ultrasound measurement of muscle thickening of the diaphragm. IMW was prevalent in 27.5% of patients. Patients with IMW had significantly lower percent vital capacity to normal predicted values (%VC), lower percent knee extensor muscle strength to body weight (%KEMS), poorer nutritional status as assessed by the geriatric nutritional risk index, and shorter 6-minute walk distance (6-MWD) compared with patients without IMW (all p<0.05). Impaired diaphragm muscle thickening at end-inspiration (median value: <3.9 mm) was significantly associated with a high prevalence of IMW and reduced 6-MWD (all p<0.05). Subgroup analysis showed that IMW was accompanied by a further decrease in 6-MWD in patients with restrictive pulmonary dysfunction (%VC <80%) or lower-limb muscle weakness (median value: %KEMS <30%) (all p<0.05).IMW is associated with exercise intolerance in patients with HFpEF.",

        "abstract": "Home telemonitoring is becoming more important to home medical care for patients with heart failure. Since there are no data on home telemonitoring for Japanese patients with heart failure, we investigated its effect on cardiovascular outcomes. The HOMES-HF study was the first multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to elucidate the effectiveness of home telemonitoring of physiological data, such as body weight, blood pressure, and pulse rate, for Japanese patients with heart failure (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry 000006839). The primary end-point was a composite of all-cause death or rehospitalization due to worsening heart failure. We analyzed 181 recently hospitalized patients with heart failure who were randomly assigned to a telemonitoring group (n\u00a0=\u00a090) or a usual care group (n\u00a0=\u00a091). The mean follow-up period was 15 (range 0-31) months. There was no statistically significant difference in the primary end-point between groups [hazard ratio (HR), 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.548-1.648; p\u00a0=\u00a00.572]. Home telemonitoring for Japanese patients with heart failure was feasible; however, beneficial effects in addition to those of usual care were not demonstrated. Further investigation of more patients with severe heart failure, participation of home medical care providers, and use of a more integrated home telemonitoring system emphasizing communication as well as monitoring of symptoms and physiological data are required.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Background  The prognosis of heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in Japan remains poor, although there is growing evidence for increasing use of evidence-based pharmacotherapies in Japanese real-world HF registries. Sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) is a first-in-class angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in the recently completed largest outcome trial in patients with HFrEF (PARADIGM-HF trial). The prospectively designed phase III PARALLEL-HF (Prospective comparison of ARNI with ACE inhibitor to determine the noveL beneficiaL trEatment vaLue in Japanese Heart Failure patients) study aims to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of LCZ696 in Japanese HFrEF patients, and show similar improvements in clinical outcomes as the PARADIGM-HF study enabling the registration of LCZ696 in Japan.    Methods and design  This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active controlled study of 220 Japanese HFrEF patients. Eligibility criteria include a diagnosis of chronic HF (New York Heart Association Class II-IV) and reduced ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction \u226435%) and increased plasma concentrations of natriuretic peptides [N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) \u2265600\u00a0pg/mL, or NT-proBNP \u2265400\u00a0pg/mL for those who had a hospitalization for HF within the last 12 months] at the screening visit. The study consists of three phases: (i) screening, (ii) single-blind active LCZ696 run-in, and (iii) double-blind randomized treatment. Patients tolerating LCZ696 50\u00a0mg bid during the treatment run-in are randomized (1:1) to receive LCZ696 100\u00a0mg bid or enalapril 5\u00a0mg bid for 4 weeks followed by up-titration to target doses of LCZ696 200\u00a0mg bid or enalapril 10\u00a0mg bid in a double-blind manner. The primary outcome is the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization and the study is an event-driven trial.    Conclusions  The design of the PARALLEL-HF study is aligned with the PARADIGM-HF study and aims to assess the efficacy and safety of LCZ696 in Japanese HFrEF patients.",

        "abstract": "Mitral flow velocity pattern in patients with left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction usually includes decreased peak early diastolic filling velocity (E), slowed deceleration of the early diastolic filling wave and increased peak filling velocity at atrial contraction (A). However, the abnormal mitral flow velocity pattern can be normalized in the presence of concomitant congestive heart failure. In such cases E can be equal to or even higher than normal, its deceleration is normal or faster than normal value, and A can be normal or lower than normal value. Clinical observations in patients with severe heart failure showed that the mitral flow velocity pattern changes with vasodilating therapy, reflecting the changes in the left atrial (LA) to LV pressure difference rather than those in the absolute LA pressure or LV pressure alone. This was validated in the canine study in which levels of LV dysfunction were made by the injection of microspheres into the left coronary artery to study the interrelation among the mitral flow velocity pattern and LA and LV pressures. In this experiment, the changes in the mitral flow velocity pattern could not be explained by the changes in LA or LV pressure alone but was better explained by the changes in the LA to LV pressure difference. Not only LA-LV crossover pressure but also LA compliance seem to be important as determinants of LA pressure level in diastole. In addition to LV relaxation rate, incompleteness of relaxation, elastic recoil and LV passive elastic properties, extracardiac constraint is also considered to be an important determinant of the level of the LV diastolic pressure and hence of the mitral flow velocity pattern at least in the presence of congestive heart failure. Thus, mitral flow velocity pattern is determined by the interaction of LA and LV pressures, both of which are affected by chamber properties as well as loading conditions.",

        "abstract": "Hyperuricemia induces endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress and inflammation, increasing cardiovascular morbidities. It also raises the incidence of atrial fibrillation; however, underlying mechanisms are unknown.Methods\u2004and\u2004Results:The effects of urate on expression of Kv1.5 in cultured mouse atrial myocytes (HL-1 cells) using reverse transcriptase-PCR, immunoblots, flow cytometry and patch-clamp experiments were studied. Treatment with urate at 7 mg/dl for 24 h increased the Kv1.5 protein level, enhanced ultra-rapid delayed-rectifier K(+)channel currents and shortened action potential duration in HL-1 cells. HL-1 cells expressed the influx uric acid transporter (UAT), URATv1, and the efflux UATs, ABCG2 and MRP4. An inhibitor against URATv1, benzbromarone, abolished the urate effects, whereas an inhibitor against ABCG2, KO143, augmented them. Flow cytometry showed that urate induced an increase in reactive oxygen species, which was abolished by the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and the NADPH-oxidase inhibitor, apocynin. Both NAC and apocynin abolished the enhancing effects of urate on Kv1.5 expression. A urate-induced increase in the Kv1.5 proteins was accompanied by phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and was abolished by an ERK inhibitor, PD98059. NAC abolished phosphorylation of ERK by urate.Intracellular urate taken up by UATs enhanced Kv1.5 protein expression and function in HL-1 atrial myocytes, which could be attributable to ERK phosphorylation and oxidative stress derived from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase.",

        "abstract": "Kv1.5 confers ultra-rapid delayed-rectifier potassium channel current (IKur) which contributes to repolarization of the atrial action potential. Kv1.5 proteins, degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, decreased in some atrial fibrillation patients. Carboxyl-terminus heat shock cognate 70-interacting protein (CHIP), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is known to ubiquitinate short-lived proteins. Here, we investigated the roles of CHIP in Kv1.5 degradation to provide insights into the mechanisms of Kv1.5 decreases and treatments targeting Kv1.5 for atrial fibrillation. Coexpression of CHIP with Kv1.5 in HEK293 cells increased Kv1.5 protein ubiquitination and decreased the protein level. Immunofluorescence revealed decreases of Kv1.5 proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and on the cell membrane. A siRNA against CHIP suppressed Kv1.5 protein ubiquitination and increased its protein level. CHIP mutants, lacking either the N-terminal tetratricopeptide region domain or the C-terminal U-box domain, failed to exert these effects on Kv1.5 proteins. Immunoprecipitation showed that CHIP formed complexes with Kv1.5 proteins and heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70). Effects of Hsc70 on Kv1.5 were similar to CHIP by altering interaction of CHIP with Kv1.5 protein. Coexpression of CHIP and Hsc70 with Kv1.5 additionally enhanced Kv1.5 ubiquitination. Kv1.5 currents were decreased by overexpression of CHIP or Hsc70 but were increased by knockdown of CHIP or Hsc70 in HEK 293 cells stably expressing Kv1.5. These effects of CHIP and Hsc70 were also observed on endogenous Kv1.5 in HL-1 mouse cardiomyocytes, decreasing IKur and prolonging action potential duration. These results indicate that CHIP decreases the Kv1.5 protein level and functional channel by facilitating its degradation in concert with chaperone Hsc70. ",

        "abstract": "Abstract Several studies report that endogenous insulin secretion (EIS) ability is correlated with BMI in glucagon stimulation tests (GST). Despite a standard method to assess EIS, GST can produce side effects such as nausea. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between EIS and BMI with a simple meal tolerance test (MTT). One-hundred type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients (average: age 61, HbA1c 9.2 %, BMI 25.0 kg/m2, duration of DM 11.5 years) subjected to a MTT. We measured serum C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) at fasting, and 2 h after a calorie controlled breakfast, and calculated the difference to give \u0394CPR. The fasting and postprandial CPR significantly correlated with BMI (R\u2009=\u20090.59, R\u2009=\u20090.48, P\u2009<\u20090.0001, respectively). \u0394CPR also significantly correlated to BMI (R\u2009=\u20090.34, P\u2009<\u20090.001). HbA1c had a significant negative association of \u0394CPR (R\u2009=\u2009\u22120.38, P\u2009<\u20090.0005). The optimal cut-off level of BMI to predict \u0394CPR <1.0 was 20.5 kg/m2 using the ROC curve (sensitivity 83 %, specificity 88 %). Using multiple regression analysis, we examined influence factors of \u0394CPR; the significant standard partial regression coefficients were: BMI 0.254, insulin use \u22120.237, HbA1c -0.358 (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The HbA1c level in BMI > 25.0 kg/m2 was significantly higher in patients with 1.0 < \u0394CPR <2.0 than patients with \u0394CPR > = 2.0 (10.0 % vs. 8.5 %). The BMI significantly correlated with EIS ability in a MTT, and is a simple index to predict EIS. The insulin secretion ability diminished in patients with BMI <20 kg/m2, and BMI > 25 kg/m2 but high HbA1c > 10 %.",

A total of 254 patients with nonvalvular AF were prospectively followed for AF recurrence after a single ablation procedure. During a two-year follow-up period, AF recurred in 65 (25.6%) patients. Patients with AF recurrence had significantly greater baseline ln brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) than those without AF recurrence (P\u2009<\u20090.01), whereas there were no significant differences in the levels of biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and points of scoring systems. In the Cox regression analyses, the baseline ln BNP was significantly independently associated with AF recurrence (adjusted HR\u2009=1.286, 95% CI\u2009=1.000-1.655, P\u2009<\u20090.05). The baseline levels of ln BNP were significantly associated with rhythm at blood collection, age, sex, and left atrial diameter, and left ventricular ejection fraction (P\u2009<\u20090.05).The subgroup analysis showed a significant interaction on the risk of AF recurrence between ln BNP, sex difference, and rhythm at blood collection (P for interaction <\u20090.05). In conclusion, the results suggest that the pre-ablation levels of ln BNP are useful to evaluate the risk of AF recurrence after ablation therapy; however, there is a need to be careful while using BNP as a biomarker for the risk of AF recurrence by taking account of the effects of rhythm status at blood collection and sex difference.",

The developed method enabled to separate and quantitate simultaneously seven AGEs, and was applied to the determination of free AGEs contained in various kinds of soy sauce and beer. The major AGEs in soy sauce and beer were N-carboxymethyllysine (CML), N-carboxyethyllysine (CEL), and N-(5-hydro-5-methyl-4-imidazolon-2-yl)ornithine (MG-H1). Using the developed LC-MS/MS method, recovery test on soy sauce and beer samples showed the recovery values of 85.3-103.9% for CML, 95.9-107.4% for CEL, and 69.5-123.2% for MG-H1. In particular, it is the first report that free CML, CEL, and MG-H1 were present in beer. Furthermore, long-term storage and heating process of soy sauce increased CML and MG-H1.",

        "abstract": "Purpose To assess the diagnostic performance of dual-energy CT with myocardial delayed enhancement (MDE) in the detection and classification of myocardial scar in patients with heart failure, with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) MRI as the standard of reference. Materials and Methods MDE CT and LGE MRI were performed in 44 patients with heart failure (30 men; mean patient age, 66 years \u00b1 14) between 2013 and 2016, and images were retrospectively analyzed. The presence and patterns of MDE on iodine-density and virtual monochromatic (VM) images were assessed by two independent readers. Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and percentage signal intensity increase relative to normal myocardium were measured. Diagnostic performance and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for MDE CT and kappa values for reader agreement were determined. Results Thirty-five of the 44 patients (80%) demonstrated a focal area of LGE, with a nonischemic pattern in 22 of the 44 patients (50%) and an ischemic pattern in 13 (30%). Iodine-density images demonstrated the highest CNR and percentage signal intensity increase on CT images (P < .05), resulting in the highest diagnostic performance in the detection of any MDE CT abnormality (92% sensitivity [195 of 213 segments] and 98% specificity [481 of 491 segments]). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for iodine-density images and 40-keV VM images in the detection of MDE were 0.97 and 0.95, respectively (P < .001). Kappa values for reader agreement were 0.82 for iodine-density images and 0.72 for 40-keV VM images. Conclusion Myocardial delayed enhancement CT enables accurate detection and localization of scar in patients with heart failure when compared with late gadolinium enhancement MRI, the reference standard.",

        "abstract": "Radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) is a serious side effect of thoracic radiation therapy (RT) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Radiation-induced cardiomyopathy (RICM) is one of the manifestations of RIHD, which represents with left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic dysfunction due to myocardial fibrosis. Although the diagnosis of RIHD is challenging and is generally an exclusion diagnosis, multimodality imaging including echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging could help the diagnosis. Herein, we report a case of 70-years-old male, who had been treated with chemo-radiation therapy for early esophageal cancer, was suffered from medically refractory heart failure due to severely reduced LV systolic function and constrictive pericarditis 8\u00a0years after chemo-radiation therapy. Although no gadolinium-enhancement (LGE) was detected on CMR, T1 mapping depicted increased extracellular matrix volumes of 45%, which suggested global myocardial fibrosis. Histopathological analysis by endomyocardial biopsy (EBM) revealed marked degeneration of myocytes and interstitial fibrosis, while vacuolation in myocytes which is characteristics of chemotherapy induced cardiomyopathy was not specific by electron microscopy. Therefore, we diagnosed that the present case was likely to the RICM. < RICM is characterized by inflammation followed by the development of a diffuse, patchy interstitial fibrosis of the myocardium, which is usually obtained either by EBM or at autopsy. Native and post-contrast T1-mapping by CMR enables to estimate extracellular volume (ECV), which is believed to be increased as a result of diffuse myocardial fibrosis. The assessment of myocardial fibrosis using ECV should be useful for early detection of myocardial damage due to RT, and which probably taking place of EBM.>.",

        "abstract": "Mitral flow velocity patterns are frequently \"normalized\" by the alteration in the loading condition even in the presence of left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. In addition, a simple index, the ratio of mitral peak early diastolic flow velocity to mitral peak flow velocity at atrial contraction, is not obtainable in patients with atrial fibrillation (Af). Thus these limitations hamper the value of analyzing the mitral flow velocity pattern in the assessment of abnormal LV diastolic characteristics. This study was designed to elucidate the hypothesis that peak early diastolic flow velocity decreases progressively from the base to the apex in patients with LV diastolic dysfunction. Regional diastolic flow velocity patterns at 1, 2, or 3 cm from the mitral tip toward the apex were simultaneously recorded with the mitral flow velocity pattern by using multigate pulsed Doppler echocardiography in 42 subjects with normal LV function (31 normal volunteers and 11 patients with Af only), 17 patients with hypertensive heart disease, and 22 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. In the normal subjects early diastolic flow velocity at the mitral tip was maintained at the positions 1 to 3 cm away from the tip into the LV cavity. In contrast, regional peak early diastolic flow velocity progressively decreased toward the apex in patients with hypertensive heart disease and dilated cardiomyopathy. These findings were observed even in patients with a normalized mitral flow velocity pattern or those with Af. Thus the assessment of the intraventricular decrease in peak early diastolic flow velocity may be useful in detecting LV diastolic dysfunction, particularly in patients with Af or a \"normalized\" mitral flow velocity pattern.",

        "abstract": "Diastolic wall strain (DWS) was reported as a simple and feasible echocardiographic index in assessing left ventricular (LV) diastolic stiffness. We sought to evaluate whether DWS predicts age-related cardiovascular events. Patients referred for transthoracic echocardiogram, those with preserved LV ejection fraction and no clinical heart failure were studied. Cardiovascular events were ascertained using Framingham criteria (myocardial infarction, coronary insufficiency, stroke, transient ischemic attack, congestive heart failure, or cardiovascular death). DWS was calculated with a validated formula. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to assess the risk of cardiovascular events. Of a total number of 962 patients (mean age 60.9\u2009\u00b1\u200914.9\u00a0years, 48.0% men), 69 (7.2%) developed at least 1 cardiovascular event during a mean follow-up of 43\u2009\u00b1\u200932\u00a0months. After adjusting for cardiovascular comorbidities in a multivariable model, low DWS (\u2266\u20040.33) was a significant independent predictor of cardiovascular events [hazard ratio (HR): 1.87, 95% confidential interval (CI) 1.04-3.36, P\u2009=\u20090.04]. Echocardiographic assessment of DWS may help in identifying the patients at increased risk for future age-related cardiovascular events.",

He had hepatic carcinoid with an extremely elevated urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid and was referred to our division for shortness of breath and leg edema. Transthoracic echocardiography showed the thickened and retracted tricuspid valve leaflets and severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation was observed, with the involvement of mitral valve leaflets. A patent foramen ovale was not detected on transesophageal echocardiography. The extremely high concentration of circulating serotonin and/or other vasoactive substances may have contributed to left- as well as right-sided carcinoid heart disease.",

        "abstract": "We have previously reported that a long-acting loop diuretic, azosemide, reduces cardiovascular risks in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) as compared with a short-acting one, furosemide, in Japanese Multicenter Evaluation of LOng- versus short-acting Diuretics In Congestive heart failure (J-MELODIC). However, the mechanisms of the difference have not been elucidated. This study aimed to examine whether there is a difference in the reduction in plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level and in left ventricular (LV) functional recovery between the CHF patients treated with the long-acting diuretic (the azosemide group) and the short-acting diuretic (the furosemide group). We reviewed changes in plasma BNP level and echo-assessed LV functional parameters from baseline to a year after the entry in 288 CHF patients with New York Heart Association class II or III symptoms that joined J-MELODIC. The decrease in plasma BNP levels was larger in the azosemide group than in the furosemide group (p u003c 0.01). The changes in echocardiographic parameters were not more favorable in the azosemide group than in the furosemide group. In conclusion, the decrease in plasma BNP levels was larger in the azosemide group than in the furosemide group. These findings may account for the better prognosis in CHF patients treated with azosemide than those with furosemide in J-MELODIC.",

The need to administer drugs separately increases infusion time. We evaluated the compatibility and stability of solutions containing nab-paclitaxel and other drugs, including gemcitabine hydrochloride, carboplatin, dexamethasone sodium phosphate, granisetron hydrochloride, and palonosetron hydrochloride. We visually examined changes in appearance, pH, and concentration of the mixed solutions of nab-paclitaxel and other drugs for up to 24 h. Concentration was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The appearance and pH of the mixed solutions did not change for up to 24 h. The change in concentration up to 24 h was within 2%. The chromatogram did not change until 8 h. The results showed that the physical compatibility and chemical stability of nab-paclitaxel were not influenced when it was combined with other drugs until 8 h. This study suggests that nab-paclitaxel could be administered in a mixture or sequentially with other drugs to reduce administration time.",

        "abstract": "Hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) is a common side effect of multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (mTKIs). HFSR can necessitate dose reductions or interruption of therapy owing to its negative effect on the quality of life. Therefore, effective use of mTKIs requires measures to prevent HFSR. We evaluated the effect of prostaglandin E (PGE) on HFSR, because PGE is already used to treat bed sores and skin ulcers and has established angiogenic and antiproliferative effects in keratinocytes. We found that the pathogenesis of sorafenib-induced HFSR is characterized by a decrease in levels of a phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). We investigated the effect of PGE on the sorafenib-mediated reduction in phosphorylated STAT3 levels in HaCaT human epidermal keratinocytes. In cells treated with sorafenib, phosphorylated STAT3 levels decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, and this effect was blocked in cells treated with sorafenib and PGE. Furthermore, the expression of phosphorylated STAT3, the antiapoptotic proteins myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and survivin decreased in cells pretreated with an inhibitor of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Cell viability increased in cells treated with sorafenib and PGE compared with that in cells treated with sorafenib alone, and these effects were not observed in STAT3 knockdown HaCaT cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that PGE blocks the inhibitory effects of sorafenib on cell growth by maintaining the activity of STAT3 and enhancing the CREB activity. Therefore, PGE might represent an effective treatment for the prevention of sorafenib-induced HFSR.",

        "abstract": "Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 is a key factor in homeostasis of the oral mucosa by regulating the production of inflammatory cytokines. Sunitinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (multidrug resistance (MDR)-1/ABCB1) and breast-cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2). In this retrospective study, we evaluated the association between sunitinib-induced stomatitis and STAT3, ABCB1, and ABCG2 polymorphisms in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Fifty-two Japanese patients with RCC treated with sunitinib were retrospectively genotyped to elucidate a potential association between STAT3, ABCB1, and ABCG2 polymorphisms and stomatitis development. Stomatitis occurred in 22 out of 52 patients. The TT+TC genotypes at STAT3 rs744166 had an odds ratio of 5.00 against CC genotype for the stomatitis development (95% confident interval, 0.97-25.8). In the Kaplan-Meier method for the cumulative incidence of stomatitis, a statistically significant difference was observed between the TT+TC and CC genotypes in STAT3 rs744166 (p=0.037). Both multiple logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis show STAT3 rs744166 TT+TC genotypes and serum creatinine in each patient were significant independent factors for stomatitis development. In conclusion, STAT3 polymorphism may be a novel risk factor for sunitinib-induced stomatitis in patients with mRCC.",

However, these drugs cause some diverse adverse reactions in patients and sometimes affect clinical outcomes of cancer therapy. Therefore, predictive markers are necessary to avoid severe adverse reactions, to establish novel and effective prevention methods, and to improve treatment outcomes. Some genetic factors involved in these adverse reactions have been reported; however, perspectives on each adverse response have not been integrated yet. In this review, genetic polymorphisms relating to molecular-targeted therapy-induced adverse reactions in patients with renal cell carcinoma are summarized in the points of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms.

        "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to evaluate the ability of different beverages to mask the bitterness of zopiclone and eszopiclone in tablet formulations using the artificial taste sensor and human gustatory sensation testing. The beverages tested for bitterness-masking effects were: Mugicha, Sports beverage, Lactic acid drink, Orange juice and a diluted simple syrup (an 8.5% sucrose solution). The bitterness intensities estimated by the taste sensor of zopiclone or eszopiclone one-tablet solutions mixed with the various beverages, corresponded well with the observed bitterness intensities measured by gustatory sensation testing. The Sports beverage, Lactic acid drink and Orange juice significantly suppressed the bitterness intensity of both zopiclone and eszopiclone 1-tablet solutions compared with water when tested in the artificial taste sensor. Sports beverage, Lactic acid drink and Orange juice all contain citric acid as acidifier, so it was postulated that citric acid was involved in the mechanism of bitterness intensity suppression of zopiclone and eszopiclone 1-tablet solutions by these three beverages. It was then shown that citric acid suppressed the bitterness intensity of a zopiclone one-tablet sample solution in a dose-dependent manner. H-NMR spectroscopic analysis of mixtures of citric acid with zopiclone suggested that the carboxyl groups of citric acid interact with the amine group on zopiclone. This study therefore showed that the bitterness intensities of zopiclone and eszopiclone can be suppressed by citric-acid-contained beverages and suggests that this bitterness suppression is due to a direct electrostatic interaction between citric acid and the two drugs.",

        "abstract": "Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 is a key factor in multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor (mTKI)-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. This study aimed to identify associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the STAT3 gene and tumor response to mTKIs in patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC). Seventy-one patients with clear cell RCC treated with any mTKI were retrospectively genotyped to elucidate a potential association between STAT3 SNPs and overall best response to drugs. Of 50 patients included for analysis, a partial or complete response was observed in 17. A significant association was found between rs4796793 alleles and tumor response [G vs. C, odds ratio (OR) 3.25, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.30\u20138.07]. There were a higher percentage of responders with the C/C genotype at rs4796793 than with the G/C + G/G genotypes (OR 4.46, 95 % CI 1.31\u201315.28). Time-to-event analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference between patients with the CC genotype and those with G/C + G/G genotypes in time-to-treatment response, but not in progression-free survival or time-to-treatment failure. The rs4796793 genotype is a novel predictive factor of the response to mTKIs in patients with mRCC. However, prospective translational trials with larger patient cohorts are required to confirm these results.",

Our purpose was to assess the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the STAT3 gene and hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients treated with multi-kinase inhibitors (MKIs). Methods: Sixty-five mRCC patients treated with MKIs (sunitinib, sorafenib, or axitinib) were genotyped for rs4796793 in the 5\u2032 region of the STAT3 gene. We retrospectively analyzed 60 patients whose first MKI therapy lasted for more than 4 months, regardless of the presence or absence of HFSR, and who developed HFSR within 4 months before treatment failure. Results: MKIs sunitinib, sorafenib, and axitinib were given to 35, 16, and 9 patients, respectively. HFSR was observed in 46 patients. Genotypes GG, GC, and CC at rs4796793 were found in 9, 27, and 24 patients, respectively. A significant associat...",

        "abstract": "Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP-3) is a key regulator of extracellular matrix turnover for its ability to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), adamalysin-like metalloproteinases (ADAMs) and ADAMs with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTSs). TIMP-3 is a secreted protein whose extracellular levels are regulated by endocytosis via the low-density-lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1). In this study we developed a molecule able to \"trap\" TIMP-3 extracellularly, thereby increasing its tissue bioavailability. LRP-1 contains four ligand-binding clusters. In order to investigate the TIMP-3 binding site on LRP-1, we generated soluble minireceptors (sLRPs) containing the four distinct binding clusters or part of each cluster. We used an array of biochemical methods to investigate the binding of TIMP-3 to different sLRPs. We found that TIMP-3 binds to the ligand-binding cluster II of the receptor with the highest affinity and a soluble minireceptor containing the N-terminal half of cluster II specifically blocked TIMP-3 internalization, without affecting the turnover of metalloproteinases. Mass spectrometry-based secretome analysis showed that this minireceptor, named T3TRAP, selectively increased TIMP-3 levels in the extracellular space and inhibited constitutive shedding of a number of cell surface proteins. In conclusion, T3TRAP represents a biological tool that can be used to modulate TIMP-3 levels in the tissue and could be potentially developed as a therapy for diseases characterized by a deficit of TIMP-3, including arthritis.",

In this study, we isolated a monoclonal anti-ADAMTS-5 antibody 1B7 that blocks LRP1-mediated internalization without affecting the aggrecanolytic activity. Addition of 1B7 to cultured human chondrocytes revealed the full aggrecanolytic activity of ADAMTS-5 generated by the cells. 1B7 is a useful tool to estimate the ADAMTS-5 activity and to identify its potential roles in the tissues.",

        "abstract": "The pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) is poorly understood. Loss of the proteoglycan aggrecan from cartilage is an early event. Recently, we identified a role for the JNK pathway, particularly JNK-2, in human articular chondrocytes in vitro in regulating aggrecan degradation. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether JNK-2 has a similar function in vivo and to examine its role in gene expression.Aggrecan fragments were analyzed by Western blotting. OA was induced by destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) and assessed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery. Knee sections were stained with Safranin O. Medial compartments were scored by histologic grading for aggrecan loss and cartilage damage. RNA was extracted from JNK-2(-/-) and wild-type mouse knees 6 hours after DMM or after interleukin-1 stimulation of the proximal epiphysis, and expression of 33 DMM-regulated genes was analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction-customized array cards.In vitro, basal and interleukin-1- or tumor necrosis factor-stimulated release of aggrecanase-generated aggrecan fragments was greatly reduced in cartilage from JNK-2(-/-) mice. In the OA model, JNK-2(-/-) mice exhibited significant reduction of aggrecanase-generated fragments and cartilage damage. Of 33 genes investigated, 13 were significantly down-regulated in JNK-2(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice, following DMM. These included Has1, Adamts4, Tnf, Il6, Il18, Il18rap, Il1a, Inhba, Cd68, Ngf, Ccr2, Wnt16, and Tnfaip6, but not Adamts5.Our results demonstrate that JNK-2 regulates aggrecan degradation in cultured murine cartilage and surgically induced OA in vivo following mechanical destabilization of the knee joint. This implicates the JNK signaling pathway in OA and suggests potential novel approaches to therapy.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: The aggrecanase ADAMTS-5 and the collagenase MMP-13 are constitutively secreted by chondrocytes in normal cartilage, but rapidly endocytosed via the cell surface endocytic receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and subsequently degraded. This endocytic system is impaired in osteoarthritic (OA) cartilage due to increased ectodomain \u2018sheddingu0027 of LRP1. The aim of this study is to identify the LRP1 sheddase(s) in human cartilage, and to test whether inhibition of LRP1 shedding prevents the cartilage degradation in OA.Methods: Cell-associated LRP1 and soluble LRP1 (sLRP1) released from human cartilage explants and chondrocytes were measured by Western blot analysis. LRP1 sheddases were identified by protease inhibitor profiling and gene silencing with siRNAs. Specific monoclonal antibodies were used to selectively inhibit the sheddases. Degradation of aggrecan and collagen in human OA cartilage was measured by Western blot analysis using an aggrecan neo-epitope antibody and hydroxyproline assay, respectively.Results: The shedding of LRP1 was increased in OA cartilage compared to normal tissue. Shed sLRP1 bound to ADAMTS-5 and MMP-13 and prevented their endocytosis without interfering with their proteolytic activities. Two membrane-bound metalloproteinases, ADAM17 and MMP-14, have been identified as the LRP1 sheddases in cartilage. Inhibition of their activities restored the endocytic capacity of chondrocytes and reduced degradation of aggrecan and collagen in OA cartilage.Conclusions: The shedding of LRP1 is a key link to OA progression. Local inhibition of LRP1 sheddase activities of ADAM17 and MMP-14 is a unique way to reverse matrix degradation in OA cartilage and could be effective as a therapeutic approach.

        "abstract": "Matrix protease activity is fundamental to developmental tissue patterning and remains influential in adult homeostasis. In cartilage, the principal matrix proteoglycan is aggrecan, the protease-mediated catabolism of which defines arthritis; however, the pathophysiologic mechanisms that drive aberrant aggrecanolytic activity remain unclear. Human ciliopathies exhibit altered matrix, which has been proposed to be the result of dysregulated hedgehog signaling that is tuned within the primary cilium. Here, we report that disruption of intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88), a core ciliary trafficking protein, increases chondrocyte aggrecanase activity in vitro. We find that the receptor for protease endocytosis in chondrocytes, LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1), is unevenly distributed over the cell membrane, often concentrated at the site of cilia assembly. Hypomorphic mutation of IFT88 disturbs this apparent hot spot for protease uptake, increases receptor shedding, and results in a reduced rate of protease clearance from the extracellular space. We propose that IFT88 and/or the cilium regulates the extracellular remodeling of matrix-independently of Hedgehog regulation-by enabling rapid LRP-1-mediated endocytosis of proteases, potentially by supporting the creation of a ciliary pocket. This result highlights new roles for the cilium's machinery in matrix turnover and LRP-1 function, with potential relevance in a range of diseases.-Coveney, C.

ADAMTS-5 (k/K 35\u2009\u00d7\u200910 M s) is a more potent (~18-fold) versicanase than ADAMTS-4 (k/K 1.86\u2009\u00d7\u200910 M sec), whereas ADAMTS-1 versicanase activity is comparatively low. Deletion of the spacer domain reduced versicanase activity of ADAMTS-5 19-fold and that of ADAMTS-4 167-fold. Co-deletion of the ADAMTS-5 cysteine-rich domain further reduced versicanase activity to a total 153-fold reduction. Substitution of two hypervariable loops in the spacer domain of ADAMTS-5 (residues 739-744 and 837-844) and ADAMTS-4 (residues 717-724 and 788-795) with those of ADAMTS-13, which does not cleave proteoglycans, caused spacer-dependent reductions in versicanase activities. Our results demonstrate that these loops contain exosites critical for interaction with and processing of versican. The hypervariable loops of ADAMTS-5 are shown to be important also for its aggrecanase activity. Together with previous work on ADAMTS-13 our results suggest that the spacer domain hypervariable loops may exercise significant control of ADAMTS proteolytic activity as a general principle. Identification of specific exosites also provides targets for selective inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Recently, observational searches for gravitational wave background (GWB) have\ndeveloped and given direct and indirect constraints on the energy density of\nGWB in a broad range of frequencies. These constraints have already rejected\nsome theoretical models of large GWB spectra. However, at 100 MHz, there is no\nstrict upper limit from direct observation, though the indirect limit by He4\nabundance due to big-bang nucleosynthesis exists. In this paper, we propose an\nexperiment with laser interferometers searching GWB at 100 MHz. We considered\nthree detector designs and evaluated the GW response functions of a single\ndetector. As a result, we found that, at 100 MHz, the most sensitive detector\nis the design, a so-called synchronous recycling interferometer, which has\nbetter sensitivity than an ordinary Fabry-Perot Michelson interferometer by a\nfactor of 3.3 at 100 MHz. We also give the best sensitivity achievable at 100\nMHz with realistic experimental parameters.",

The surface finishing is based on an electroless nickel-phosphorus-tungsten (NiPW) plating, applicable to large surface area up to ~ 800 mm in diameter, and achieves less than 3% total reflectance against a light beam at 1064 nm with a reasonable scattering distribution ~ 0.05/sr. The outgassing rate from the black coating meets our requirements of 3\u00d710\u22127 Pa \u00b7 m3 s\u22121 m\u22122. The black coating can tolerate low temperature down to 12 K, and can be installed close to cold mirrors indispensable for the future interferometers.",

In order to achieve its target sensitivity, the relative positions of the mirrors of the interferometer must be finely adjusted with attached actuators. We have developed a model to simulate the length control loops of the KAGRA interferometer with realistic suspension responses and various noises for mirror actuation. Using our model, we have designed the actuation parameters to have sufficient force range to acquire lock as well as to control all the length degrees of freedom without introducing excess noise.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this feature article, we highlight our works on compositional and structural dependence of up-converting rare earth (RE) fluorides obtained through ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) assisted hydrothermal synthesis. Various nanostructures were obtained by tuning of experimental conditions, such as precursor\u2019s concentration, degree of doping, reaction time and solvent used during synthesis. We correlated in detail the structural, morphological and optical properties of YF 3  and NaYF 4  compounds co-doped with Yb 3+  and Er 3+  (introduced in total mol% of 8 and 20). For this purpose, X-ray powder diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray and Furrier transform infrared spectroscopy, as well as, the photoluminescence spectra and decay times were recorded and analyzed. The particle size and phase content were found to be dependent on the nucleation rate, which, in turn, was governed by the precursor concentration, degree of doping and solvent type. The transformation from cubic to hexagonal NaYF 4 :Yb 3+ /Er 3+  phase was found to be sensitive to the reaction time and precursors concentration, while the crystallization of orthorhombic YF 3 :Yb 3+ /Er 3+  phase is achieved through lowering of dopants concentration or by changing of solvent during hydrothermal treatment. The up-conversion photoluminescence demonstrated morphology and crystal phase dependence and is found to be superior in microcrystalline samples, independent on their phase composition.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   n-type GaN photoanodes used for water splitting have stability problems. One means of resolving this is loading NiO catalyst on the n-type GaN surface. Aqueous electrolytes H 2 SO 4 , HCl, KOH, and NaOH are usually used for photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, suitable electrolytes for the NiO-loading on n-type GaN photoelectrode have not yet been evaluated. Therefore, we investigated the effects of changing electrolytes used for NiO-loading in this study. The photocurrent of NiO-loading on n-type GaN increased when KOH and NaOH electrolytes were used. In addition, the surfaces showed no corrosion after reaction when these electrolytes were used. However, the photocurrent was not stable using KOH electrolyte. Interestingly, stable photocurrent was observed with when the NaOH electrolyte was used. In the case of H 2 SO 4 , the photocurrent of GaN did not change with and without NiO. The surface morphologies became rough because of GaN corrosion, and NiO dissolved in the H 2 SO 4  electrolyte.",

First, very narrow template GNRs with widths of approximately 10\u2009nm were prepared by unzipping from double-walled carbon nanotubes. Additional 4\u20135 layers of graphene were then formed on the pristine GNR template by chemical vapor deposition. Raman spectroscopy revealed that the synthesized multilayer GNR had turbostratic stacking without any structural correlation between the graphene layers. A large on/off ratio and a high on-current were observed in field effect transistors fabricated using the synthesized multilayer GNR channel.",

        "abstract": "Urinary leukotriene E4 (U-LTE4) concentrations are significantly elevated in patients with aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA). However, the relationship between the clinicopathogenetic features of eosinophilic rhinosinusitis and U-LTE4 concentration remains unknown. Here we examined the relationship between U-LTE4 level and eosinophil in chronic rhinosinusitis.We measured the U-LTE4 concentrations and eosinophil counts in ethmoidal and maxillary sinuses and peripheral blood in 30 asthmatic patients (including 15 AIA patients).Eosinophil counts in ethmoidal sinuses and peripheral blood were markedly higher in asthmatic patients than in controls. Although there were no significant differences between eosinophil counts in maxillary and ethmoidal sinuses for ATA group, eosinophil counts were higher in ethmoidal sinus compared to that in maxillary sinus in the AIA group (P<.05). Eosinophil counts were higher in the maxillary than in ethmoidal sinuses for control patients (P<.05). Despite low correlation between eosinophil counts in peripheral blood and eosinophil counts in maxillary sinus (rs=0.4323, P<.001), moderate correlation was observed between eosinophil counts in peripheral blood and eosinophil counts in ethmoidal sinus (rs=0.5249, P<.0001). Basal U-LTE4 concentrations were higher in AIA patients than in those with aspirin-tolerant asthma. Despite low correlation between eosinophil counts and U-LTE4 concentration in maxillary sinus (rs=0.3849, P<.01), moderate correlation was observed between eosinophil counts and U-LTE4 concentrations in ethmoidal sinus (rs=0.4736, P<.001).We describe the differences in U-LTE4 and other parameters in AIA compared to ATA, and correlation among parameters. We demonstrate that eosinophil-dominant inflammation starts in ethmoidal sinus clinicopathogenetically in CRS with asthma. U-LTE4 concentration was not exclusively associated with eosinophil counts in ethmoidal sinus. Eosinophils in ethmoidal sinus may be a major production site for CysLTs, particularly in AIA. CRS with AIA is assumed to be characterized by leukotriene-eosinophil cross-interaction in ethmoidal sinus.",

        "abstract": "A high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD) system was developed for the simultaneous determination of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA) in human plasma. In the present HPLC-ECD system, EPA, DHA, and AA were separated using a reverse-phase C30 column and detected based on the voltammetric reduction of 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone (DBBQ). Chromatographic peak areas were proportional to the concentration of EPA, DHA, and AA from 0.75 \u03bcM to 0.1 mM (r > 0.998). The concentrations of EPA, DHA, and AA in plasma from healthy human subjects after overnight fasting were determined, and the ratio of EPA to AA was obtained by the present HPLC-ECD method, which required 40 \u03bcL of human plasma and a simple procedure of sample preparation using diethyl ether extraction. Moreover, changes in EPA, DHA, and AA concentrations in a human subject were monitored before and after fish oil supplement administration by the present HPLC-ECD system. ",

        "abstract": "This paper puts forward a time and material-saving method for evaluating the repeatability of area measurements in gradient HPLC with UV detection (HPLC-UV), based on the function of mutual information (FUMI) theory which can theoretically provide the measurement standard deviation (SD) and detection limits through the stochastic properties of baseline noise with no recourse to repetitive measurements of real samples. The chromatographic determination of terbinafine hydrochloride and enalapril maleate is taken as an example. The best choice of the number of noise data points, inevitable for the theoretical evaluation, is shown to be 512 data points (10.24s at 50 point/s sampling rate of an A/D converter). Coupled with the relative SD (RSD) of sample injection variability in the instrument used, the theoretical evaluation is proved to give identical values of area measurement RSDs to those estimated by the usual repetitive method (n=6) over a wide concentration range of the analytes within the 95% confidence intervals of the latter RSD. The FUMI theory is not a statistical one, but the \"statistical\" reliability of its SD estimates (n=1) is observed to be as high as that attained by thirty-one measurements of the same samples (n=31).

        "abstract": "A sensitive method for the electrochemical determination of synephrine (SYN) by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) has been developed. Optimal chromatographic separation and high sensitive determination by HILIC with electrochemical detection (HILIC-ECD) was achieved using a sulfobetaine-type zwitterionic monolith column (100\u00d71.02\u2005mm, i.d.), a mixture of 10\u2005mM sodium phosphate (pH\u20054) and acetonitrile (20\u2009:\u200980, v/v) as mobile phase, and a glassy carbon working electrode which was applied with a potential at +1.0\u2005V vs. Ag/AgCl. The chromatographic peak height of SYN was proportional to the concentration from 5.0\u2005\u00b5g/L to 1.0\u2005mg/L (r=0.999). The detection limit of SYN (S/N=3) was 3.7 pg on the column. Moreover, the present HILIC-ECD could be applied to the accurate and precise determination of SYN in Aurantii nobilis Pericarpium. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that an ECD is one of useful detection methods applicable to HILIC.",

To examine the applicability of the cell to real samples, the determination of tocopherols in edible vegetable oils was carried out. Tocopherols (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4) and 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-6-hydroxychroman (internal standard) were eluted and fully separated within 10 min using a mixture of supercritical carbon dioxide and methanol containing 1.0 mol L\u22121 ammonium acetate (98\u2006:\u20062, v/v) as a mobile phase and a conventional silica gel column as a stationary phase. The current peak area detected in the electrochemical cell was found to be linear with the amount of samples injected in the range from 5 \u03bcmol L\u22121 to 200 \u03bcmol L\u22121 (r \u2267 0.997). The repeatability was not more than 1.82% RSD (n = 6) and the intermediate precision was also not more than 3.55% RSD (n = 3). The limit of detection (S/N = 3) on the column was less than 3.43 pmol. By the present internal standard method, tocopherols in various vegetable oils were determined with a simple sample preparation procedure.",

He presented with diarrhea and melena after having been taking low-dose aspirin (LDA) and clopidogrel. There was no evidence of bleeding in the stomach, duodenum, or colon. Capsule endoscopy showed multiple ulcers and erosions in the small intestine. Double-balloon endoscopy revealed multiple ulcers throughout the ileum. Examination of the biopsy specimen showed cytomegalovirus infection. His LDA was discontinued and he was prescribed ganciclovir. However, the small bowel ulcers were aggravated. Therefore, clopidogrel was discontinued. The small bowel ulcers subsequently healed completely, forming scars.",

We herein present the case of an 82-year-old patient who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which revealed a submucosal tumor of 30 mm in diameter that was in contact with the esophagus. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed and the histopathological findings indicated esophageal leiomyosarcoma. Surgical resection was performed. On histopathological examination, the tumor was found to consist of spindle cells with deep chromatin nuclei. The tumor was finally diagnosed as esophageal leiomyosarcoma. We were able to diagnose early-stage esophageal leiomyosarcoma using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNA). EUS-FNA is mostly recommended as a diagnostic tool for esophageal submucosal tumors.",

We report the case of a 49-year-old woman in whom upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an approximately 2-cm submucosal tumor on the anterior wall of the fornix of the stomach. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a homogeneously enhanced lesion (~\u200917\u00a0mm) in the upper third of the stomach as well as a lesion (~\u200925\u00a0mm) on the left kidney that was strongly enhanced in the early phase. An F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan revealed high accumulation that is characteristic of gastric tumors. The possibility of malignancy was not completely excluded, and the gastric tumor was resected by non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery. The patient was discharged with a good prognosis 5\u00a0days after surgery. In conclusion, non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery is a minimally invasive and effective method for resecting small gastric submucosal tumors (diameters\u2009<\u20093\u00a0cm) for which preoperative diagnosis is difficult.",

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a 10 cm sized Type 3 gastric cancer. Immunostaining was positive for chromogranin A(2+), synaptophysin(3+), CD56(-), and Ki-67>70%. Contrast computed tomography(CT)showed upper gastric wall thickening, and #1, #3, #7, #8a, and #11p enlarged lymph nodes but no distant metastasis. We diagnosed gastric cancer, UM, Less, Type 3, gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma, cT4aN3M0P0CY0, Stage \u2162C. We administered 2 courses of CDDP plus CPT-11 chemotherapy, and a partial response was obtained for the primary gastric lesion and lymph node metastases. We subsequently performed open distal gastrectomy, D2 lymph node dissection, and splenectomy. Pathological examination confirmed that the lesion was gastric cancer, U, Less, Type 3, gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma, MP, Ul-\u2161(+), int, INF b, ly2, v0, PM0, DM0, R0, ypT2N2, Stage \u2161B, with a therapeutic value of Grade 2. The patient was discharged on day 15 after the surgery and received 2 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with CDDP plus CPT-11. Nine months after the surgery, metastasis of the left adrenal grand was found. We performed open left adrenal gland resection and administered adjuvant S-1 chemotherapy.",

We further assume that immigration takes place according to the utility di\u00c2\u00a4erence between inside and outside a country. We show that an improvement in longevity has three e\u00c2\u00a4ects on the market size and welfare: First, it decreases the number of children. Second, it increases the per capita expenditure on consumption. Finally, it increases immigration. The \u00c2\u2026rst e\u00c2\u00a4ect has negative impacts on the market size and welfare whereas the latter two e\u00c2\u00a4ects have positive impacts. We then calibrate our model to match Japanese and U.S. data from 1955 to 2014 and \u00c2\u2026nd that the negative e\u00c2\u00a4ects dominate the positive ones. Moreover, our counterfactual analyses show that accepting immigration in Japan can be useful in overcoming population and market shrinkage caused by an aging population.",

For this purpose, we develop a two-region model with endogenous labor supply. Although we assume a symmetric distribution of immobile workers, the symmetric equilibrium breaks in the sense that firms may agglomerate when trade costs are intermediate and labor supply is elastic. We also show that the price index is always lower, while labor supply, per capita income, real wages, and welfare are always higher in the more agglomerated region.",
