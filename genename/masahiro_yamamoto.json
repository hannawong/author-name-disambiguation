To realize maximum performance of the battery for long flight operation, the state-of-charge (SOC) of the battery was maintained at ca. 65% during storage, in case it is required for a loss of attitude control. The capacity of the battery was measured during flight operations. Along with the operation in orbit, a ground-test battery was discharged, and both results showed a good agreement. This result confirmed that the performance of the lithium-ion secondary battery stored under micro-gravity conditions is predictable using a ground-test battery.",

        "abstract": "Adequate activation of CD4(+) T lymphocytes is essential for host defense against invading pathogens; however, exaggerated activity of effector CD4(+) T cells induces tissue damage, leading to inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases. Several unique subsets of intestinal innate immune cells have been identified. However, the direct involvement of innate immune cell subsets in the suppression of T-cell-dependent intestinal inflammation is poorly understood. Here, we report that intestinal CX(3)C chemokine receptor 1(high) (CX(3)CR1(high)) CD11b(+) CD11c(+) cells are responsible for prevention of intestinal inflammation through inhibition of T-cell responses. These cells inhibit CD4(+) T-cell proliferation in a cell contact-dependent manner and prevent T-cell-dependent colitis. The suppressive activity is abrogated in the absence of the IL-10/Stat3 pathway. These cells inhibit T-cell proliferation by two steps. Initially, CX(3)CR1(high) CD11b(+) CD11c(+) cells preferentially interact with T cells through highly expressed intercellular adhesion molecule-1/vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; then, they fail to activate T cells because of defective expression of CD80/CD86. The IL-10/Stat3 pathway mediates the reduction of CD80/CD86 expression. Transfer of wild-type CX(3)CR1(high) CD11b(+) CD11c(+) cells prevents development of colitis in myeloid-specific Stat3-deficient mice. Thus, these cells are regulatory myeloid cells that are responsible for maintaining intestinal homeostasis.",

        "abstract": "The lung is continuously exposed to bacteria and their products, and has developed a complex defense mechanism, including neutrophil recruitment. In mice, keratinocyte cell-derived chemokine and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 are the major chemokines for neutrophil recruitment into the lung. We have previously described a role for C-X-C chemokine (CXCL5) in neutrophil trafficking during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammation in mice. The aims of the present study were to identify the cellular origin of CXCL5 and to determine the signaling cascades that regulate its expression in the lung during LPS-induced inflammation and in isolated LPS-stimulated CXCL5-expressing cells. Our immunohistochemical analysis indicates that alveolar epithelial type II (AEII) cells are the primary source of CXCL5 in the rodent lung. These in vivo observations were confirmed with primary AEII cells. In addition, our data indicate that the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling cascade involving TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor 88, and Toll-IL-1R domain-containing adapter protein is required to induce CXCL5 expression in the lung. Furthermore, p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinases are involved in lung CXCL5 expression. Similarly, TLR4, and p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinases, are associated with LPS-induced CXCL5 expression in AEII cells. These novel observations demonstrate that activation of AEII cells via TLR4-dependent signaling is important for the production of CXCL5 in the lung exposed to LPS.",

        "abstract": "The innate immune system senses viral infection by recognizing a variety of viral components (including double-stranded (ds)RNA) and triggers antiviral responses. The cytoplasmic helicase proteins RIG-I (retinoic-acid-inducible protein I, also known as Ddx58) and MDA5 (melanoma-differentiation-associated gene 5, also known as Ifih1 or Helicard) have been implicated in viral dsRNA recognition. In vitro studies suggest that both RIG-I and MDA5 detect RNA viruses and polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic dsRNA analogue. Although a critical role for RIG-I in the recognition of several RNA viruses has been clarified, the functional role of MDA5 and the relationship between these dsRNA detectors in vivo are yet to be determined. Here we use mice deficient in MDA5 (MDA5-/-) to show that MDA5 and RIG-I recognize different types of dsRNAs: MDA5 recognizes poly(I:C), and RIG-I detects in vitro transcribed dsRNAs. RNA viruses are also differentially recognized by RIG-I and MDA5. We find that RIG-I is essential for the production of interferons in response to RNA viruses including paramyxoviruses, influenza virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, whereas MDA5 is critical for picornavirus detection. Furthermore, RIG-I-/- and MDA5-/- mice are highly susceptible to infection with these respective RNA viruses compared to control mice. Together, our data show that RIG-I and MDA5 distinguish different RNA viruses and are critical for host antiviral responses.",

Differentiation of the rod-shaped sporozoites of  into spherical exoerythrocytic forms (EEFs) via bulbous expansion is essential for parasite development in the liver. However, little is known about the host factors regulating the morphological transformation of  sporozoites in this organ. Here, we show that sporozoite differentiation into EEFs in the liver involves protein kinase C \u03b6-mediated NF-\u03baB activation, which robustly induces the expression of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in hepatocytes and subsequently elevates intracellular Ca levels, thereby triggering sporozoite transformation into EEFs. Blocking CXCR4 expression by genetic or pharmacological intervention profoundly inhibited the liver-stage development of the  rodent malaria parasite and the human  parasite. Collectively, our experiments show that CXCR4 is a key host factor for  development in the liver, and CXCR4 warrants further investigation for malaria prophylaxis.",

        "abstract": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize microbial components and trigger the inflammatory and immune responses against pathogens. I\u03baB\u03b6 (also known as MAIL and INAP) is an ankyrin-repeat-containing nuclear protein that is highly homologous to the I\u03baB family member Bcl-3 (refs 1\u20136). Transcription of I\u03baB\u03b6 is rapidly induced by stimulation with TLR ligands and interleukin-1 (IL-1). Here we show that I\u03baB\u03b6 is indispensable for the expression of a subset of genes activated in TLR/IL-1R signalling pathways. I\u03baB\u03b6-deficient cells show severe impairment of IL-6 production in response to a variety of TLR ligands as well as IL-1, but not in response to tumour-necrosis factor-\u03b1. Endogenous I\u03baB\u03b6 specifically associates with the p50 subunit of NF-\u03baB, and is recruited to the NF-\u03baB binding site of the IL-6 promoter on stimulation. Moreover, NF-\u03baB1/p50-deficient mice show responses to TLR/IL-1R ligands similar to those of I\u03baB\u03b6-deficient mice. Endotoxin-induced expression of other genes such as Il12b and Csf2 is also abrogated in I\u03baB\u03b6-deficient macrophages. Given that the lipopolysaccharide-induced transcription of I\u03baB\u03b6 occurs earlier than transcription of these genes, some TLR/IL-1R-mediated responses may be regulated in a gene expression process of at least two steps that requires inducible I\u03baB\u03b6.",

        "abstract": "Host defense against the intracellular protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi depends on Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent innate immune responses. Recent studies also suggest the presence of TLR-independent responses to several microorganisms, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi. However, the TLR-independent responses to protozoa remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate a novel TLR-independent innate response pathway to T. cruzi. Myd88(-/-)Trif(-/-) mice lacking TLR signaling showed normal T. cruzi-induced Th1 responses and maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), despite high sensitivity to the infection. IFN-gamma was normally induced in T. cruzi-infected Myd88(-/-)Trif(-/-) innate immune cells, and further was responsible for the TLR-independent Th1 responses and DC maturation after T. cruzi infection. T. cruzi infection induced elevation of the intracellular Ca(2+) level. Furthermore, T. cruzi-induced IFN-gamma expression was blocked by inhibition of Ca(2+) signaling. NFATc1, which plays a pivotal role in Ca(2+) signaling in lymphocytes, was activated in T. cruzi-infected Myd88(-/-)Trif(-/-) innate immune cells. T. cruzi-infected Nfatc1(-/-) fetal liver DCs were impaired in IFN-gamma production and DC maturation. These results demonstrate that NFATc1 mediates TLR-independent innate immune responses in T. cruzi infection.",

Here we demonstrate that conditional ablation of Ubc13 resulted in defective B cell development and in impaired B cell and macrophage activation. In response to all tested stimuli except tumor necrosis factor, Ubc13-deficient cells showed almost normal NF-kappaB activation but considerably impaired activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Ubc13-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase required, at least in part, ubiquitination of the adaptor protein IKKgamma. These results show that Ubc13 is key in the mammalian immune response.",

The recent discovery of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and analyses of their physiological roles have established the notion that TLRs play a central role in innate immunity. Accumulating evidence suggests that individual TLRs recognize distinct ligands derived from bacterial components to generate specific cellular immune responses. In this review, we delineate the relationships between TLRs and microbial components, the TLR-mediated signaling pathways mainly based on cytoplasmic adaptor molecules containing Toll/interleukin-1R domains, the mechanism of TLR-mediated gene expression, and the involvement of TLRs in septic shock, including up-to-date observations.",

        "abstract": "Lipid A is a strong activator of monocytes to release immune stimulators such as proinflammatory cytokines. Overproduction of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-6 is known to cause septic shock that frequently leads to multiple organ failure and finally to death. In recent years, Lipid A has also been recognized by a Toll-like receptor, TLR4. Activation of TLR4by LPS or Lipid A triggers signal transduction via the cytoplasmic domain called the Toll/IL-1 Receptor (TIR) domain. Intracellular TIR domain-containing adaptor molecules are involved in the TLR4-mediated signaling pathways. Moreover, a subset of LPS-inducible genes is regulated in two steps by the inducible nuclear protein. Additionally, the TLR4-mediated activation of signaling cascadesis elaborately down-regulated by a number of negative regulators. In this chapter, we discuss the mechanisms of the activation or de-activation program mediated by the Lipid A receptor TLR4.",

        "abstract": "Viral infection and stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or double stranded RNA (dsRNA) induce phosphorylation of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and its translocation to the nucleus, thereby leading to the IFN-beta gene induction. Recently, two IkappaB kinase (IKK)-related kinases, inducible IkappaB kinase (IKK-i) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), were suggested to act as IRF-3 kinases and be involved in IFN-beta production in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and viral infection. In this work, we investigated the physiological roles of these kinases by gene targeting. TBK1-deficient embryonic fibroblasts (EFs) showed dramatic decrease in induction of IFN-beta and IFN-inducible genes in response to LPS or dsRNA as well as after viral infection. However, dsRNA-induced expression of these genes was residually detected in TBK1-deficient cells and intact in IKK-i-deficient cells, but completely abolished in IKK-i/TBK1 doubly deficient cells. IRF-3 activation, in response not only to dsRNA but also to viral infection, was impaired in TBK1-deficient cells. Together, these results demonstrate that TBK1 as well as, albeit to a lesser extent, IKK-i play a crucial role in the induction of IFN-beta and IFN-inducible genes in both TLR-stimulated and virus-infected EFs.",

        "abstract": "A variety of microbial components activate a transcription factor called nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) that plays an essential role in the optimal activation of host immune systems. The transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB is tightly regulated at multiple steps in immune signaling pathways, because excessive activation is detrimental to the host. One mechanism to prevent NF-kappaB activation is mediated by cytoplasmic IkappaB family proteins. Although cytoplasmic IkappaBs interact with NF-kappaB subunits in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells, IkappaBs are rapidly degraded on stimulation, allowing free NF-kappaB to translocate into the nucleus and activate the transcription of genes encoding various immune mediators. After the translocation of NF-kappaB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, nuclear proteins that are structurally similar to cytoplasmic IkappaBs take part in the regulation of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity, as activators or inhibitors, by associating with NF-kappaB subunits. Therefore, the regulatory IkappaB-like nuclear molecules are described as \"nuclear IkappaB proteins.\" In this review, the in vivo function of the nuclear IkappaB proteins, Bcl-3, IkappaBzeta, and IkappaBNS in the context of host immune responses and diseases will be discussed.",

        "abstract": "Like viruses, intracellular bacteria stimulate their host cells to produce type I IFNs (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta). In our study, we investigated the signals and molecules relevant for the synthesis of and response to IFN by mouse macrophages infected with Listeria monocytogenes. We report that IFN-beta is the critical immediate-early IFN made during infection, because the synthesis of all other type I IFN, expression of a subset of infection-induced genes, and the biological response to type I IFN was lost upon IFN-beta deficiency. The induction of IFN-beta mRNA and the IFN-beta-dependent sensitization of macrophages to bacteria-induced death, in turn, was absolutely dependent upon the presence of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). IFN-beta synthesis and signal transduction occurred in macrophages deficient for TLR or their adaptors MyD88, TRIF, or TRAM. Expression of Nod2, a candidate receptor for intracellular bacteria, increased during infection, but the protein was not required for Listeria-induced signal transduction to the Ifn-beta gene. Based on our data, we propose that IRF3 is a convergence point for signals derived from structurally unrelated intracellular pathogens, and that L. monocytogenes stimulates a novel TLR- and Nod2-independent pathway to target IRF3 and the type I IFN genes.",

During the early phase of respiratory infection with Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin, SLPI was produced by bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells, as well as alveolar macrophages, and secreted into the alveolar space. Recombinant mouse SLPI effectively inhibited in vitro growth of bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin and Mycobacterium tuberculosis through disruption of the mycobacterial cell wall structure. Each of the two whey acidic protein domains in SLPI was sufficient for inhibiting mycobacterial growth. Cationic residues within the whey acidic protein domains of SLPI were essential for disruption of mycobacterial cell walls. Mice lacking SLPI were highly susceptible to pulmonary infection with M. tuberculosis. Thus, mouse SLPI is an essential component of innate host defense against mycobacteria at the respiratory mucosal surface.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality and is associated with extensive neutrophil accumulation. Major pathogens associated with this disease include nonflagellated Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) and flagellated Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa). TLRs are essential for innate immune defense. TIRAP (Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor protein) is an adaptor in TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6 signaling, whereas MyD88 is an adaptor for all TLRs. However, the importance of TIRAP in pulmonary defense against Kp or Pa has not been examined. To demonstrate the role of TIRAP, TIRAP-deficient and wild-type littermates were intratracheally inoculated with Kp or Pa. We found that TIRAP(-/-) mice had substantial mortality, higher bacterial burden in the lungs, and enhanced dissemination following Kp challenge. Furthermore, Kp-induced neutrophil sequestration, histopathology, and MIP-2, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and LIX (lipopolysaccharide-induced CXC chemokine) production were attenuated in the lungs of TIRAP(-/-) mice. In contrast, TIRAP is not required for Pa-induced mortality, pulmonary bacterial burden, bacterial dissemination, neutrophil accumulation, or histopathology, yet it is necessary for MIP-2, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 production, but not LIX production. However, both Kp- and Pa-induced neutrophil influxes are MyD88 dependent. To determine the mechanisms associated with Pa-induced neutrophil accumulation, we inoculated mice with a flagellin C mutant of Pa (PaDeltafliC) or purified flagellin, a TLR5 agonist. PaDeltafliC-induced neutrophil sequestration and LIX expression are dependent on TIRAP, whereas flagellin-induced neutrophil influx and LIX expression are independent of TIRAP. These novel findings illustrate a pathogen-specific role for TIRAP in pulmonary defense and suggest that TLR5 plays an essential role for Pa-induced neutrophil influx via LIX production.",

Trib1 is reportedly involved in the regulation of NF- B and MAP kinases, as well as gene expression in vitro. To clarify the physiological function of Trib1 in TLR-mediated responses, we generated Trib1-defi cient mice by gene targeting. Microarray analysis showed that Trib1-defi cient macrophages exhibited a dysregulated expression pattern of lipopolysaccharide-inducible genes, whereas TLR-mediated activation of MAP kinases and NF- B was normal. Trib1 was found to asso- ciate with NF-IL6 (also known as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ). NF-IL6 - defi cient cells showed opposite phenotypes to those in Trib1-defi cient cells in terms of TLR-mediated responses. Moreover, overexpression of Trib1 inhibited NF-IL6 - dependent gene expression by down-regulating NF-IL6 protein expression. In contrast, Trib1-defi cient cells exhibited augmented NF-IL6 DNA-binding activities with increased amounts of NF-IL6 proteins. These results demonstrate that Trib1 is a negative regulator of NF-IL6 protein expression and modulates NF-IL6 - dependent gene expression in TLR-mediated signaling.",

In contrast, TLR5 was expressed mainly on intestinal CD11c+ lamina propria cells (LPCs). CD11c+ LPCs detected pathogenic bacteria and secreted proinflammatory cytokines in a TLR5-dependent way. However, CD11c+ LPCs do not express TLR4 and did not secrete proinflammatory cytokines after exposure to a commensal bacterium. Notably, transport of pathogenic Salmonella typhimurium from the intestinal tract to mesenteric lymph nodes was impaired in Tlr5-/- mice.

        "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-17-producing CD4+ T lymphocytes (TH17 cells) constitute a subset of T-helper cells involved in host defence and several immune disorders1, 2. An intriguing feature of TH17 cells is their selective and constitutive presence in the intestinal lamina propria3. Here we show that adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP) that can be derived from commensal bacteria activates a unique subset of lamina propria cells, CD70highCD11clow cells, leading to the differentiation of TH17 cells. Germ-free mice exhibit much lower concentrations of luminal ATP, accompanied by fewer lamina propria TH17 cells, compared to specific-pathogen-free mice. Systemic or rectal administration of ATP into these germ-free mice results in a marked increase in the number of lamina propria TH17 cells. A CD70highCD11clow subset of the lamina propria cells expresses TH17-prone molecules, such as IL-6, IL-23p19 and transforming-growth-factor-\u03b2-activating integrin-\u03b1V and -\u03b28, in response to ATP stimulation, and preferentially induces TH17 differentiation of co-cultured naive CD4+ T cells. The critical role of ATP is further underscored by the observation that administration of ATP exacerbates a T-cell-mediated colitis model with enhanced TH17 differentiation. These observations highlight the importance of commensal bacteria and ATP for TH17 differentiation in health and disease, and offer an explanation of why TH17 cells specifically present in the intestinal lamina propria.",

        "abstract": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize microbial components and trigger the inflammatory and immune responses against pathogens. IkappaBzeta (also known as MAIL and INAP) is an ankyrin-repeat-containing nuclear protein that is highly homologous to the IkappaB family member Bcl-3 (refs 1-6). Transcription of IkappaBzeta is rapidly induced by stimulation with TLR ligands and interleukin-1 (IL-1). Here we show that IkappaBzeta is indispensable for the expression of a subset of genes activated in TLR/IL-1R signalling pathways. IkappaBzeta-deficient cells show severe impairment of IL-6 production in response to a variety of TLR ligands as well as IL-1, but not in response to tumour-necrosis factor-alpha. Endogenous IkappaBzeta specifically associates with the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB, and is recruited to the NF-kappaB binding site of the IL-6 promoter on stimulation. Moreover, NF-kappaB1/p50-deficient mice show responses to TLR/IL-1R ligands similar to those of IkappaBzeta-deficient mice. Endotoxin-induced expression of other genes such as Il12b and Csf2 is also abrogated in IkappaBzeta-deficient macrophages. Given that the lipopolysaccharide-induced transcription of IkappaBzeta occurs earlier than transcription of these genes, some TLR/IL-1R-mediated responses may be regulated in a gene expression process of at least two steps that requires inducible IkappaBzeta.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial pneumonia remains a serious disease and is associated with neutrophil recruitment. Innate immunity is pivotal for the elimination of bacteria, and TLRs are essential in this process. Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-beta (TRIF) is an adaptor for TLR3 and TLR4, and is associated with the MyD88-independent cascade. However, the importance of TRIF in immune responses against pulmonary bacterial pathogens is not well understood. We investigated the involvement of TRIF in a murine model of Escherichia coli pneumonia. TRIF(-/-) mice infected with E. coli display attenuated neutrophil migration; NF-kappaB activation; and TNF-alpha, IL-6, and LPS-induced C-X-C chemokine production in the lungs. In addition, E. coli-induced phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p38 MAPK was detected in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) of TRIF(+/+) mice, but attenuated in BMMs of TRIF(-/-) mice. Furthermore, E. coli-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 production was attenuated in BMMs of TRIF(-/-) mice. E. coli LPS-induced late MAPK activation, and TNF-alpha and IL-6 production were abolished in BMMs of TRIF(-/-) mice. Moreover, TRIF is not required for LPS-induced neutrophil influx, and keratinocyte cell-derived chemokine, MIP-2, and LPS-induced C-X-C chemokine production in the lungs. Using TLR3(-/-) mice, we ruled out the role of TLR3-mediated TRIF-dependent neutrophil influx during E. coli pneumonia. A TLR4-blocking Ab inhibited E. coli-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 in BMMs of both TRIF(-/-) and TRIF(+/+) mice, suggesting that TRIF-mediated signaling involves TLR4. We also found that TRIF is critical to control E. coli burden in the lungs and E. coli dissemination. Thus, rapid activation of TRIF-dependent TLR4-mediated signaling cascade serves to augment pulmonary host defense against a Gram-negative pathogen.",

However, the involvement of innate immunity in host resistance to T. cruzi remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated host defense against T. cruzi by focusing on innate immunity. Macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) from MyD88(-/-)TRIF(-/-) mice, in which TLR-dependent activation of innate immunity was abolished, were defective in the clearance of T. cruzi and showed impaired induction of IFN-beta during T. cruzi infection. Neutralization of IFN-beta in MyD88(-/-) macrophages led to enhanced T. cruzi growth. Cells from MyD88(-/-)IFNAR1(-/-) mice also showed impaired T. cruzi clearance. Furthermore, both MyD88(-/-)TRIF(-/-) and MyD88(-/-)IFNAR1(-/-) mice were highly susceptible to in vivo T. cruzi infection, highlighting the involvement of innate immune responses in T. cruzi infection. We further analyzed the molecular mechanisms for the IFN-beta-mediated antitrypanosomal innate immune responses. MyD88(-/-)TRIF(-/-) and MyD88(-/-)IFNAR1(-/-) macrophages and DCs exhibited defective induction of the GTPase IFN-inducible p47 (IRG47) after T. cruzi infection. RNA interference-mediated reduction of IRG47 expression in MyD88(-/-) macrophages resulted in increased intracellular growth of T. cruzi. These findings suggest that TLR-dependent expression of IFN-beta is involved in resistance to T. cruzi infection through the induction of IRG47.",

However, the type of polyubiquitin chain linkages and the host factors that are required for Tax ubiquitination have not been identified. Here, we demonstrate that Tax polyubiquitin chains are composed predominantly of lysine 63-linked chains. Furthermore, the ubiquitination of Tax is critically dependent on the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13. Tax interacts with Ubc13, and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Ubc13 expression abrogates Tax ubiquitination and the activation of NF-kappaB. Mouse fibroblasts lacking Ubc13 exhibit impaired Tax activation of NF-kappaB despite normal tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin-1-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Finally, the interaction of Tax with NEMO is disrupted in the absence of Tax ubiquitination and Ubc13 expression, suggesting that Tax ubiquitination is critical for NEMO binding. Collectively, our results reveal that Ubc13 is essential for Tax ubiquitination, its interaction with NEMO, and Tax-mediated NF-kappaB activation.",

        "abstract": "Malaria parasites within red blood cells digest host hemoglobin into a hydrophobic heme polymer, known as hemozoin (HZ), which is subsequently released into the blood stream and then captured by and concentrated in the reticulo-endothelial system. Accumulating evidence suggests that HZ is immunologically active, but the molecular mechanism(s) through which HZ modulates the innate immune system has not been elucidated. This work demonstrates that HZ purified from Plasmodium falciparum is a novel non-DNA ligand for Toll-like receptor (TLR)9. HZ activated innate immune responses in vivo and in vitro, resulting in the production of cytokines, chemokines, and up-regulation of costimulatory molecules. Such responses were severely impaired in TLR9-/- and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-/-, but not in TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, or Toll/interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon beta-/- mice. Synthetic HZ, which is free of the other contaminants, also activated innate immune responses in vivo in a TLR9-dependent manner. Chloroquine (CQ), an antimalarial drug, abrogated HZ-induced cytokine production. These data suggest that TLR9-mediated, MyD88-dependent, and CQ-sensitive innate immune activation by HZ may play an important role in malaria parasite-host interactions.",

        "abstract": "Signal transduction through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) originates from their intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which binds to MyD88, a common adaptor protein containing a TIR domain. Although cytokine production is completely abolished in MyD88-deficient mice, some responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), including the induction of interferon-inducible genes and the maturation of dendritic cells, are still observed. Another adaptor, TIRAP (also known as Mal), has been cloned as a molecule that specifically associates with TLR4 and thus may be responsible for the MyD88-independent response. Here we report that LPS-induced splenocyte proliferation and cytokine production are abolished in mice lacking TIRAP. As in MyD88-deficient mice, LPS activation of the nuclear factor NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinases is induced with delayed kinetics in TIRAP-deficient mice. Expression of interferon-inducible genes and the maturation of dendritic cells is observed in these mice; they also show defective response to TLR2 ligands, but not to stimuli that activate TLR3, TLR7 or TLR9. In contrast to previous suggestions, our results show that TIRAP is not specific to TLR4 signalling and does not participate in the MyD88-independent pathway. Instead, TIRAP has a crucial role in the MyD88-dependent signalling pathway shared by TLR2 and TLR4.",

In signal transduction via TLRs, MyD88, which harbors a Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR)-domain and a death domain, has been shown to link between TLRs and MyD88-dependent downstream events leading to proinflammatory cytokine production and splenocyte proliferation. However, recent studies using MyD88-deficient mice have revealed that some TLRs possess a MyD88-independent pathway, which is represented by interferon (IFN)-beta production induced by LPS stimulation. This indicates that additional signaling molecules other than MyD88 exist in the TLR signaling pathway. Indeed, two additional TIR domain-containing adaptors, TIRAP/Mal and TRIF, have recently been identified. Both define the specific biological responses of each TLR.",

        "abstract": "The baculovirus Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcNPV) has been widely used to achieve a high level of foreign gene expression in insect cells, as well as for efficient gene transduction into mammalian cells without any replication. In addition to permitting efficient gene delivery, baculovirus has been shown to induce host innate immune responses in various mammalian cells and in mice. In this study, we examined the effects of the innate immune responses on gene expression by recombinant baculoviruses in cultured cells. The reporter gene expression in IRF3-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) infected with the recombinant baculovirus was shown to be enhanced in accordance with the suppression of beta interferon (IFN-\u03b2) production. Furthermore, efficient gene transduction by the recombinant baculovirus was achieved in MEFs deficient for stimulator of interferon genes (STING), TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), or IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), but not in those deficient for IRF7, MyD88, or Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1)/DAI. Enhancement of gene expression by the recombinant baculovirus was also observed in human hepatoma cell lines replicating hepatitis C virus (HCV), in which innate immunity was impaired by the cleavage of IPS-1 by the viral protease. In addition, infection with the recombinant baculovirus expressing the BH3-only protein, BIMS, a potent inducer of apoptosis, resulted in a selective cell death in the HCV replicon cells. These results indicate that innate immune responses induced by infection with baculovirus attenuate transgene expression, and this characteristic might be useful for a selective gene transduction into cells with impaired innate immunity arising from infection with various viruses.",

Here, we show that myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)-dependent TLR signaling mediates brain pathogenesis of severe malaria infection, namely cerebral malaria (CM). A significant number of MyD88-, but not TIR domain containing adaptor-inducing IFN-beta (TRIF)-deficient or wild-type (WT) mice survived CM caused by Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection. Although systemic parasitemia was comparable, sequestration of parasite and hemozoin load in the brain blood vessels was significantly lower in MyD88-deficient mice compared with those in TRIF-deficient or WT mice. Moreover, brain-specific pathological changes were associated with MyD88-dependent infiltration of CD8+, CCR5+ T cells and CD11c+ dendritic cells, including CD11c+, NK1.1+ and B220+ cells, and up-regulation of genes such as Granzyme B, Lipocalin 2, Ccl3 and Ccr5. Further studies using mice lacking various TLRs suggest that TLR2 and TLR9, but not TLR4, 5 and 7, were involved in CM. These results strongly suggest that TLR2- and/or TLR9-mediated, MyD88-dependent brain pathogenesis may play a critical role in CM, the lethal complication during PbA infection.",

        "abstract": "The paramyxovirus Sendai (SV), is a well-established inducer of IFN-alphabeta gene expression. In this study we show that SV induces IFN-alphabeta gene expression normally in cells from mice with targeted deletions of the Toll-IL-1 resistance domain containing adapters MyD88, Mal, Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-beta (TRIF), and TRIF-related adaptor molecule TLR3, or the E3 ubiquitin ligase, TNFR-associated factor 6. This TLR-independent induction of IFN-alphabeta after SV infection is replication dependent and mediated by the RNA helicase, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and not the related family member, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5. Furthermore, we characterize a RIG-I-like RNA helicase, Lgp2. In contrast to RIG-I or melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, Lgp2 lacks signaling caspase recruitment and activation domains. Overexpression of Lgp2 inhibits SV and Newcastle disease virus signaling to IFN-stimulated regulatory element- and NF-kappaB-dependent pathways. Importantly, Lgp2 does not prevent TLR3 signaling. Like RIG-I, Lgp2 binds double-stranded, but not single-stranded, RNA. Quantitative PCR analysis demonstrates that Lgp2 is present in unstimulated cells at a lower level than RIG-I, although both helicases are induced to similar levels after virus infection. We propose that Lgp2 acts as a negative feedback regulator of antiviral signaling by sequestering dsRNA from RIG-I.",

        "abstract": "The E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 plays pivotal roles in diverse biological processes. Recent studies have elucidated that UBC13, in concert with the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF8, propagates the DNA damage signal via a ubiquitylation-dependent signaling pathway. However, mechanistically how UBC13 mediates its role in promoting checkpoint protein assembly and its genetic requirement for E2 variants remain elusive. Here we provide evidence to support the idea that the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex RNF8-UBC13 functions independently of E2 variants and is sufficient in facilitating ubiquitin conjugations and accumulation of DNA damage mediator 53BP1 at DNA breaks. The RNF8 RING domain serves as the molecular platform to anchor UBC13 at the damaged chromatin, where localized ubiquitylation events allow sustained accumulation of checkpoint proteins. Intriguingly, we found that only a group of RING domains derived from E3 ubiquitin ligases, which have been shown to interact with UBC13, enabled UBC13-mediated FK2 and 53BP1 focus formation at DNA breaks. We propose that the RNF8 RING domain selects and loads a subset of UBC13 molecules, distinct from those that exist as heterodimers, onto sites of double-strand breaks, which facilitates the amplification of DNA damage signals. Genomic stability and its maintenance entail proper DNA damage recognition, signal propagation, and effector activation (7). Cells have evolved elaborate networks to coordinate cel- lular processes that, in response to DNA damage, combine to ensure faithful transmission of genetic materials (3). The abil- ity to temporally and spatially control these components is endowed by a growing list of posttranslational modifications, which when covalently attached to their substrates, govern processes including protein-protein interactions, protein local- ization and activities, and protein degradation (10). Phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX by the phos- phoinositide-3-kinase-related protein kinase ATM/ATR con- stitutes one of the initial signals upon damage detection and is required for the subsequent accumulation of DNA damage sensors and mediators in the vicinity of DNA lesions (17). Formation of discernible nuclear focus structures has been suggested to enable the amplification of the initial damage signal to elicit the proper cellular response to DNA damage. Indeed, mouse models with deficiencies in H2AX and MDC1, proteins of which are instrumental in regulating the assembly of numerous DNA damage-responsive factors at DNA breaks, show growth defects, chromosomal instability, DNA repair defects, and radiation sensitivity (4, 5, 14, 19). Mechanistically how these downstream DNA damage-responsive proteins, in- cluding the tumor suppressors BRCA1 and 53BP1, are re- tained at DNA breaks is beginning to emerge with the recent",

TLR4 activates intracellular signaling pathways via TIR domain containing adaptor molecules, MyD88, and Toll/IL-1 domain containing adaptor inducing IFN-beta (TRIF). Although macrophages lacking MyD88 or TRIF showed impaired cytokine production, activation of intracellular signaling molecules still occurred in response to LPS in these cells. In the present study, we implemented cDNA microarrays to investigate the contribution of MyD88 and TRIF in gene expression induced by LPS stimulation. Whereas wild-type macrophages induced 148 genes in response to LPS, macrophages lacking both MyD88 and TRIF did not upregulate any genes in response to LPS. Surprisingly, 80 LPS-inducible genes were redundantly regulated by either MyD88 or TRIF. In contrast, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were critically regulated by MyD88 or TRIF alone. Genes critically regulated by MyD88 alone tend to be induced quickly after LPS stimulation and regulated by mRNA stability as well as transcription. Genes known to be induced by type I interferons were simply dependent on TRIF for their expression. Taken together, MyD88 and TRIF play both redundant and distinct roles in LPS-induced gene expression.",

In vivo function of DCs was analyzed using transgenic mouse models that express diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) or the diphtheria toxin-A subunit (DTA) under the control of the CD11c/Itgax promoter. However, CD11c+ cells are heterogeneous populations that contain several DC subsets. Thus, the in vivo function of each subset of DCs remains to be elucidated. Here, we describe a new inducible DC ablation model, in which DTR expression is induced under the CD11c/Itgax promoter after Cre-mediated excision of a stop cassette (CD11c-iDTR). Crossing of CD11c-iDTR mice with CAG-Cre transgenic mice, expressing Cre recombinase under control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer-chicken beta-actin hybrid promoter, led to the generation of mice, in which DTR was selectively expressed in CD11c+ cells (iDTRDelta mice). We successfully deleted CD11c+ cells in bone marrow-derived DCs in vitro and splenic CD11c+ cells in vivo after DT treatment in iDTRDelta mice. This mouse strain will be a useful tool for generating mice lacking a specific subset of DCs using a transgenic mouse strain, in which the Cre gene is expressed by a DC subset-specific promoter.",

        "abstract": "The mucosal host defence discriminates pathogens from commensals, and prevents infection while allowing the normal flora to persist. Paradoxically, Toll-like receptors (TLR) control the mucosal defence against pathogens, even though the TLR recognise conserved molecules like LPS, which are shared between pathogens and commensals. This study proposes a mechanism of pathogen-specific mucosal TLR4 activation, involving adhesive ligands and their host cell receptors. TLR4 signalling was activated in CD14-negative, LPS-unresponsive epithelial cells by P fimbriated, uropathogenic Escherichia coli but not by a mutant lacking fimbriae. Epithelial TLR4 signalling in vivo involved the glycosphingolipid receptors for P fimbriae and the adaptor proteins Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-beta (TRIF)/TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM), but myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88)/TIR domain-containing adaptor protein were not required for the epithelial response. Substituting the P fimbriae with type 1 fimbriae changed TLR4 signalling from the TRIF to the MyD88 adaptor pathway. In addition, the adaptor proteins and the fimbrial type were found to influence bacterial clearance. Trif(-/-) and Tram(-/-) mice remained infected with P fimbriated E. coli but cleared the type 1 fimbriated strain, while Myd88(-/-) mice became carriers of both the P and the type 1 fimbriated bacteria. Thus, TLR4 may be engaged specifically by pathogens, when the proper cell surface receptors are engaged by virulence ligands.",

        "abstract": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) engages Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on various cells to initiate inflammatory and angiogenic pathways. FADD is an adaptor protein involved in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Here we report a role for FADD in regulation of TLR4 signals in endothelial cells. FADD specifically attenuates LPS-induced activation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase in a death domain-dependent manner. In contrast, FADD-null cells show hyperactivation of these kinases. Examining physical associations of endogenous proteins, we show that FADD interacts with interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and MyD88. LPS stimulation increases IRAK1-FADD interaction and recruitment of the IRAK1-FADD complex to activated MyD88. IRAK1 is required for FADD-MyD88 interaction, as FADD does not associate with MyD88 in IRAK1-null cells. By shuttling FADD to MyD88, IRAK1 provides a mechanism for controlled and limited activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway. Functionally, enforced FADD expression inhibited LPS- but not vascular endothelial growth factor-induced endothelial cell sprouting, while FADD deficiency led to enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines induced by stimulation of TLR4 and TLR2, but not TLR3. Reconstitution of FADD reversed the enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, FADD is a physiological negative regulator of IRAK1/MyD88-dependent responses in innate immune signaling.",

        "abstract": "Against invading microorganisms, vertebrates including mammals develop innate immune systems, which are activated by microbial components possessing conserved structures called pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs); including bacterial cell wall components, and viral genomic DNA and RNA. PAMPs are recognized by pattern recognition receptors mainly expressing on immune responsive cells. Toll-like receptors (TLRS) are an example of pattern recognition receptors, and TLR family members are conserved among mammals. To date, 10 and 12 TLRs have been reported in human and mouse, respectively. Almost all TLRs have been shown to recognize PAMPs; TLR2 is the receptor for peptidoglycan and lipoprotein, including bacterial lipoprotein (BLP) and mycoplasmal lipoprotein (MALP-2). Especially, BLP and MALP-2 are reportedly recognized in the functional heterodimeric association of TLR2 with TLRl and TLR6, respectively. TLR4 is involved in the recognition of a gram-negative cell wall component, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TLR5 is a receptor for flagellin, a component of bacterial flagella. TLR3 and TLR9 are receptors for double-stranded (ds) RNA and unmethylated CpG DNA, respectively. Although the natural ligand for TLR7 is yet to be identified, the receptor has been shown to recognize imidazoquid or its derivative, R- 848. Since they are utilized in the treatment of genital warts caused by human papilomavirus, the ligand for TLR7 seems to be a component of viruses. Thus, accumulating evidence clearly demonstrates that TLRs serve as pattern recognition receptors to detect invading microbes (Figure 1).",

Recently, a RNA helicase, RIG-I, is also suggested to recognize viral double-stranded RNA. However, how these molecules contribute to viral recognition in vivo is poorly understood. Here we would like to show that RIG-I is essential for induction of type I interferons (IFNs) after infection with RNA viruses in fibroblasts and conventional dendritic cells (DCs). RIG-I induces type I IFNs by activating IRF3 via IkappaB kinase related kinases. In contrast, plasmacytoid DC, which produce large amounts of IFN-alpha, use the TLR system rather than RIG-I for viral detection. Taken together, RIG-I and the TLR system exert antiviral responses in a cell type specific manner.",

We now show that BS69, a MYND domain-containing cellular protein, is the missing adaptor that bridges LMP1 and TRAF6, as the MYND domain and a separate region of BS69 bind to the carboxyl termini of LMP1 and TRAF6, respectively. While LMP1 promotes the interaction between BS69 and TRAF6, the complex formation between LMP1 and TRAF6 is BS69 dependent. A fraction of LMP1 and BS69 is constitutively colocalized in the membrane lipid rafts. Importantly, knockdown of BS69 by small interfering RNAs specifically inhibits JNK activation by LMP1 but not tumor necrosis factor alpha. Although overexpression of either BS69 or a mutant LMP1 without the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail is not sufficient to activate JNK, interestingly, when BS69 is covalently linked to the mutant LMP1, the chimeric protein restores the ability to activate JNK. This indicates that the recruitment and aggregation of BS69 is a prerequisite for JNK activation by LMP1.",

We undertook this study to investigate whether the RNA components of these antigens, which contain extensive tracts of single- and double-stranded RNA, signatures of viral infection, activate innate immunity.U1 and Y RNAs were affinity purified from K562 cells. Murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs), human HEK 293 cells, and murine RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with U1 RNA and other known Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. Expression of the interferon (IFN)-inducible gene Mx1 and other genes was quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction, and cytokine production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. DC maturation was assessed using flow cytometry.Purified U1 and Y1-Y5 RNAs and synthetic stem-loop II of U1 RNA stimulated type I IFN (IFN-I) production by cell lines and murine bone marrow-derived DCs and promoted DC maturation (CD86 expression). U1 RNA-stimulated, but not TLR-3 ligand-stimulated, IFN-I was blocked by bafilomycin A1, indicating that immunostimulation by U1 RNA requires endosomal acidification. Myeloid differentiation factor 88-deficient cells responded poorly to U1 RNA, suggesting that an endosomal TLR, probably TLR-7, mediates the stimulatory effects of U1 RNA. U1 RNA-induced IFN-I and interleukin-6 production also were protein kinase R (PKR) dependent (abrogated by 2-aminopurine and greatly reduced in PKR-/- cells).We conclude that the RNA components of the Ro 60 (Y1-Y5 RNA) and Sm/RNP (U1 RNA) small ribonucleoproteins act as endogenous adjuvants that could play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity by stimulating DC maturation and IFN-I production.",

We herein showed the strong expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) in tuberculosis granulomas and more rapid death of HIF-1\u03b1-conditional knockout mice than wild-type mice after M. tuberculosis infection. Although interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) is a critical host protective cytokine against intracellular pathogens, HIF-1-deficient macrophages permitted M. tuberculosis growth even after activation with IFN-\u03b3. These results prompted us to investigate the role of HIF-1\u03b1 in host defenses against infection. We found that the expression of lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A) was controlled by HIF-1\u03b1 in M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages IFN-\u03b3 independently. LDH-A is an enzyme that converts pyruvate to lactate and we found that intracellular level of pyruvate in HIF-1\u03b1-deficient BMDMs was significantly higher than in wild type BMDMs. Intracellular bacillus replication was enhanced by an increase in intracellular pyruvate concentrations, which were decreased by LDH-A. Mycobacteria in phagosomes took up exogenous pyruvate more efficiently than glucose, and used it as the feasible carbon source for intracellular growth. These results demonstrate that HIF-1\u03b1 prevents the hijacking of pyruvate in macrophages, making it a fundamental host-protective mechanism against M. tuberculosis.",

A subset of TLRs, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9, induces antiviral responses by producing interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). Production of IFN-alpha is dependent on the Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor MyD88. Here we show that MyD88 formed a complex with the transcription factor IRF7 but not with IRF3. The death domain of MyD88 interacted with an inhibitory domain of IRF7, and this interaction resulted in activation of the IFN-alpha-dependent promoters. Furthermore, the adaptor molecule TRAF6 also bound and activated IRF7. Ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF6 was required for IRF7 activation. These results indicate that TLR-mediated IFN-alpha induction requires the formation of a complex consisting of MyD88, TRAF6 and IRF7 as well as TRAF6-dependent ubiquitination.",

TRAF6 is an intracellular signaling adaptor molecule for these receptors, but its role in B cells has not been clarified by previous genetic approaches, as the systemic deletion of the TRAF6 gene results in perinatal lethality. Here we show that B cell-specific TRAF6 deficiency results in a reduced number of mature B cells in the bone marrow and spleen. Optimal T cell-dependent (TD) antigen responses, as characterized by isotype switching and long-lived plasma cell generation, are also impaired in B cell-specific TRAF6-deficient mice. B cell-specific TRAF6-deficient mice also exhibit lower levels of serum IgM and IgG2b and defective antigen-specific IgM production in response to T cell-independent (TI) antigens. Unexpectedly, TRAF6-deficient B cell progenitors are unable to generate CD5(+) B-1 cells. These results reveal critical roles for TRAF6 in TD and TI humoral immune responses and in inductive fate decisions necessary to generate the B-1 B cell compartment.",

        "title": "Caspase-11 activation requires lysis of pathogen-containing vacuoles by IFN-induced GTPases",
        "abstract": "Previous studies have reported that induction of caspase-11-dependent cell death by Gram-negative bacteria requires Trif-dependent production of type-I interferons (type-I-IFNs)4, 5 (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Type-I-IFN production is however not required for pro-caspase-11 induction4, 6, 7 and is dispensable for caspase-11 activation by transfected lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Extended Data Fig. 1b)2. This indicates that interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) play a major role in activating caspase-11 in response to intracellular bacteria. To investigate which ISGs were involved in activating caspase-11, we used proteomics-based expression analysis to identify proteins that were highly induced following Salmonella infection. Among the most strongly upregulated proteins were interferon-induced GTPases, such as the large 65\u201367\u2009kDa guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) and small 47\u2009kDa immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) (data not shown). These proteins function in cell-autonomous immunity, that is, mechanisms that allow host cells to kill pathogens or restrict their replication, and have even been associated with the activation of inflammasomes8, 9, 10. Mice have 11 GBPs, which are highly homologous and are clustered in two genomic loci on chromosomes 3 and 5, respectively8, 11. Recently, GBPs on chromosome 3 have been shown to restrict the replication of Toxoplasma gondii in peritoneal macrophages and mice11. We therefore infected bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from Gbpchr3 KO mice, which lack GBP1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 (Extended Data Fig. 2a\u2013e), and wild-type littermates with a number of Gram-negative vacuolar pathogens that trigger caspase-11 activation (data not shown)1, 4, 5 and determined the activity of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway at 16\u2009h post-infection (Fig. 1a, b). Macrophages from Gbpchr3 KO mice showed a significant reduction of cell death (as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release) and IL-1\u03b2 secretion when infected with wild-type Salmonella typhimurium, a type three secretion system (T3SS)-deficient mutant of S. typhimurium (\u0394SPI-2), Vibrio cholerae, Enterobacter cloacae or Citrobacter koseri (Fig. 1a), and this was independent of LPS or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) priming (Extended Data Fig. 2f, g). Gbpchr3-deficiency also reduced secretion of caspase-1 p20 subunit, caspase-11 and mature IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 and IL-1\u03b1 (Fig. 1b). Because interferons induce GBP expression (Extended Data Fig. 2b, c)8, we investigated whether IFN-\u03b3 treatment would accelerate LDH release in response to Salmonella infection. IFN-\u03b3-treated wild-type BMDMs released LDH as soon as 4\u2009h after infection, whereas Gbpchr3 KO BMDMs failed to release LDH at early time points even after IFN-\u03b3 priming (Fig. 1c), indicating that GBP induction was required for activity of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway. We next explored whether GBPs play a role in the activation of canonical inflammasomes. LPS-primed wild-type and Gbpchr3-deficient macrophages released comparable levels of LDH and mature IL-1\u03b2 when infected with logarithmic phase S. typhimurium, which exclusively engage the NLRC4 inflammasome via the SPI-1 T3SS (Fig. 1d)12. Similarly, Gbpchr3-deficiency did not affect AIM2 inflammasome activation upon poly(deoxyadenylic-deoxythymidylic) acid (poly(dA:dT)) transfection (Fig. 1d). Although GBP5 had been previously linked to NLRP3 activation9, we did not observe a defect in NLRP3 activation in Gbpchr3 KOs (Fig. 1d), possibly owing to different modes of pre-stimulation. These data indicate that GBPs are dispensable for canonical inflammasome activity, but are required for the activation of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway. To investigate whether GBPs directly mediated the detection of intracellular LPS, we engaged the non-canonical inflammasome by transfecting macrophages with different types of ultra-pure LPS (Fig. 1e). Cytoplasmic LPS triggered LDH release and IL-1\u03b2 secretion to a similar extent in both wild-type and Gbpchr3-deficient BMDMs, indicating that GBPs were required upstream of LPS sensing and only during bacterial infection. We next investigated if GBPs were required for immune detection of vacuolar or cytosolic bacteria by infecting BMDMs with \u0394sifA S. typhimurium and Burkholderia thailandensis, which rapidly enter the cytosol and activate caspase-11 (ref. 13). Unprimed Gbpchr3 KO and wild-type BMDMs responded comparably to these bacteria (Extended Data Fig. 3a\u2013c). Because GBPs might affect this response when pre-induced, we also infected IFN-\u03b3-primed BMDMs with \u0394sifA S. typhimurium (Extended Data Fig. 3d). IFN-\u03b3-priming indeed resulted in a small difference between wild-type and Gbpchr3 KO BMDMs after infection with \u0394sifA Salmonella, yet not to the extent seen with wild-type Salmonella (Fig. 1c), indicating that GBPs mainly participate in the activation of the non-canonical inflammasome by vacuolar bacteria. Finally, to investigate which GBP controls caspase-11 activation, all 11 murine Gbps were individually knocked down in BMDMs and the cells were infected with flagellin-deficient Salmonella, which activate the non-canonical inflammasome but not NLRC4 (Extended Data Fig. 4a and Supplementary Information)4. Only knockdown of Gbp2 resulted in reduced LDH release and IL-1\u03b2 secretion (Extended Data Fig. 4b\u2013d). To validate these data we obtained BMDMs from Gbp2\u2212/\u2212 mice and wild-type littermates14 and infected them with vacuolar Gram-negative bacteria. As expected, we observed reduced levels of cell death, cytokine secretion and caspase release in Gbp2\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs, indicating attenuated activation of the non-canonical inflammasome (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 4e), whereas direct LPS sensing or the activation of canonical inflammasomes was not affected (Extended Data Fig. 4f, g). In contrast, Gbp5-deficiency did not have any effect on canonical and non-canonical inflammasome activation (Extended Data Fig. 5). Nevertheless, Gbp2-deficiency did not reduce caspase-11 activation as markedly as Gbpchr3-deficiency, indicating that whereas caspase-11 activation mainly requires GBP2, other GBPs might also be partially involved. Reduced numbers of intracellular bacteria could account for low levels of caspase-11 activation in Gbpchr3- and Gbp2-deficient macrophages. However, a comparison of wild-type and Gbpchr3 KO BMDMs showed that Gbpchr3-deficiency resulted in significantly higher numbers of total and live Salmonella per cell (Fig. 2a), consistent with higher colony forming units numbers in Gbpchr3 KO BMDMs (Extended Data Fig. 6). In addition, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based analysis of dead (mCherry-negative, FITC+) and live (mCherry-positive, FITC+) Salmonella at 16\u2009h post-infection found significantly fewer dead bacteria (~20%) in GBPchr3 KO and Gbp2\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs when compared to wild-type BMDMs (>30%) (Fig. 2b). Importantly, bacterial killing in Casp11\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs was comparable to wild-type BMDMs, indicating that the control of bacterial replication was directly linked to GBP function and not to the activation of the non-canonical inflammasome (Fig. 2b). In conclusion, we show that GBPs control bacterial replication on a cell-autonomous level, which is consistent with a previous report that GBP1 partially restricts Mycobacterium bovis and Listeria monocytogenes replication10. Restricting bacterial replication has been proposed to require the association of GBPs with pathogen-containing vacuoles and the recruitment of antimicrobial factors8. We therefore investigated whether GBPs targeted intracellular Gram-negative bacteria. Indeed, GBP2 could be detected on intracellular bacteria within hours after infection (Fig. 2c). Very little GBP-positive bacteria were detected in Stat1\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs, which do not respond to type-I- and type-II-IFNs and largely failed to induce GBP expression (data not shown). Remarkably, GBP-positive Salmonella seemed to have lost mCherry expression (Fig. 2c), indicating that these bacteria were dead. To determine whether GBPs are recruited to dead bacteria we infected BMDMs with Salmonella killed by heat, paraformaldehyde or 70% ethanol treatment, yet only live Salmonella acquired GBP staining and activated the inflammasome (Fig. 2d). To examine this mechanism in vivo, we immunostained spleen tissue sections of mice infected with Salmonella for GBPs. Indeed, GBPs could also be found associated with approximately 20% of bacteria in vivo, and a significantly higher proportion of these bacteria were dead, based on the loss of mCherry expression (Fig. 2e\u2013g). Furthermore, treatment with IFN-\u03b3-neutralizing antibodies reduced the percentage of GBP-positive bacteria (Fig. 2f), consistent with reports that IFN-\u03b3 controls Salmonella replication in vivo15, 16. Taken together, these results indicated that GBPs either kill bacteria directly or control an antimicrobial effector pathway, and raised the interesting possibility that GBP-mediated killing of bacteria might result in the release of LPS and caspase-11 activation2, 3. To identify the antimicrobial effector pathway that is controlled by GBPs we first examined the role of free radicals8. Although GBP7 was reported to be required for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and to interact with the phagosome oxidase complex10, we did not find any role for ROS or NO production in caspase-11 activation (Extended Data Fig. 7). Furthermore, GBPs were also proposed to recruit components of the autophagy machinery to pathogen-containing vacuoles (PCVs), possibly resulting in bacterial killing within autophagosomes8, 10. Indeed, many GBP-positive S. typhimurium, E. cloacae and C. koseri co-stained for the commonly used autophagy marker LC3 (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Recruitment of LC3 to intracellular Salmonella was partially GBP-dependent, because we found significantly lower numbers of LC3-positive Salmonella in Gbpchr3 KO compared to wild-type macrophages (Fig. 3b, c). Therefore, we speculated that autophagy-mediated killing might result in the release of LPS from bacteria and caspase-11 activation. Unexpectedly, however, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) resulted in significantly higher levels of LDH release, IL-1\u03b2 secretion and caspase-1/caspase-11 activation in macrophages infected with S. typhimurium, E. cloacae or C. koseri (Fig. 3d, e), indicating increased activation of the non-canonical inflammasome. Consistently, cell death was still caspase-11-dependent because Casp11\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs did not release LDH when treated with 3-MA and infected with Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. 3f). Direct activation of caspase-11 by LPS transfection was independent of autophagy (Fig. 3g), indicating that autophagy only counteracts non-canonical inflammasome activation during bacterial infections. To further confirm our data, we infected Atg5\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs with S. typhimurium and we also observed significantly higher levels of non-canonical inflammasome activation compared to wild-type BMDMs (Fig. 3h, i). Taken together, these results indicated that, although GBPs promoted the uptake of bacteria into autophagosomes, autophagy actually counteracted caspase-11 activation. Thus, GBP-dependent LPS detection occurs before bacteria are targeted to autophagosomes. A possible explanation could be that autophagy sequesters bacteria that had escaped from the vacuole, and thus prevents further LPS release into the cytosol. Recently, the cytosolic danger receptor galectin-8 was reported to function as a marker for lysed vacuoles. Galectin-8 binds \u03b2-galactosides, which are normally found on the inner leaflet of the vacuolar membrane and get exposed to the cytosol upon vacuolar lysis17. Indeed, quantification of galectin-8-positive Salmonella showed that significantly fewer bacteria were targeted by galectin-8 in Gbpchr3 KO BMDMs than in wild-type macrophages (Fig. 4a). Because galectin-8 colocalized with GBP- and LC3-positive Salmonella (Fig. 4b, c), we speculated that GBPs promote LC3 recruitment through galectin-8. Consistently, we found lower levels of galectin-8-positive Salmonella among LC3-positive Salmonella in Gbpchr3 KO compared to wild-type BMDMs (Fig. 4d). Galectin-8 interacts with the autophagy adaptor protein NDP52, which in humans contains binding sites for galectin-8, ubiquitin and LC318. In line with a role for NDP52 in linking galectin-8 to LC3, murine NDP52 colocalized with galectin-8 on intracellular Salmonella (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Targeting of Salmonella to autophagosomes might also involve other autophagy cargo adaptors, because p62 was associated with the majority of LC3-positive bacteria, yet this was independent of GBPs (Extended Data Fig. 8c, d). Altogether, these results suggested that GBPs might promote the lysis of vacuoles or help to recruit galectin-8 to lysed vacuoles. To confirm a direct role of GBPs in vacuolar lysis, we adapted a phagosome integrity assay based on differential permeabilization with digitonin (Extended Data Fig. 9). Comparing wild-type and GBPchr3 KO BMDMs, we found significantly lower numbers of cytosolic (FITC+) S. typhimurium in Gbpchr3-deficient cells (Fig. 4e, f). Similarly, Gbp2\u2212/\u2212 BMDMs also harboured fewer cytosolic S. typhimurium compared to BMDMs from wild-type littermates (Fig. 4g). In contrast, we did not find a defect in cytosolic localization between wild-type and Gbpchr3 KO BMDMs infected with the specialized cytosolic pathogen Shigella flexneri, which uses its T3SS to destabilize the phagosome and escape into the cytoplasm (Fig. 4h)19. Although we cannot exclude that GBPs might also be involved in the recruitment or assembly of the non-canonical inflammasome, these results indicate that GBPs, in particular GBP2, directly promote the destruction of vacuoles. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that host-induced destruction of PCVs or phagosomes is an essential immune function and assures recognition of vacuolar bacteria by cytosolic innate immune sensors (Extended Data Fig. 10). Additional studies are required to determine how GBPs distinguish \u2018self\u2019 and \u2018non-self\u2019 membranes and by which mechanism phagosomes are lysed. In mice, this might involve the IRGM proteins that can act as GDI (guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor) and inhibit IRG and GBP activity. Absence of IRGMs results in mislocalization of both IRGs and GBPs and even in degradation of lipid droplets20, 21, 22, supporting a model in which IRGM proteins would protect \u2018self\u2019-vacuoles from being targeted by host IRGs and GBPs23. Because both commensals and pathogens activate caspase-11 (ref. 1), it can be assumed that GBPs are not specific towards pathogens but are a general innate immune response against bacteria trapped in the phagosomes of macrophages. Finally, given the important role of LPS-induced caspase-11 activation in septic shock1, 2, 3, pharmaceutical targeting of the above-described pathways might be used to modulate inflammation during bacterial sepsis. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) SL1344 and congenic mutants were published before12. Other bacterial strains used were Shigella flexneri, Vibrio cholerae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter koseri and Burkholderia thailandensis ATCC700388. Gbpchr3 KO, Gbp2\u2212/\u2212, Atg5fl/fl-Lyz-Cre, Cybb\u2212/\u2212 (gp91phox), Casp1\u2212/\u2212/Casp11\u2212/\u2212 (a.k.a caspase-1 knockout), Casp11\u2212/\u2212 and Casp1\u2212/\u2212 (Casp1\u2212/\u2212/Casp11tg) mice have been previously described1, 11, 14, 24, 25. Mice were bred in the animal facilities of the University of Basel, Genentech Inc., Heinrich-Heine-University Duesseldorf or the University of Osaka. Generation of mice with Gbp5 KO alleles by zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology: A ZFN pair was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (SAGE Labs). The ZFN pair recognizes a sequence in mouse Gbp5 exon 2 (cut site is underlined): 5\u2032-TGCCATCACACAGCCAGTGGTGGTGGTAGCCATTGTGGGT-3\u2032. ZFN mRNA and a donor plasmid harbouring a 10-bp deletion in Gbp5 exon 2 was co-microinjected into C57BL/6N zygotes using established procedures. One male founder carrying the 10-bp deletion was obtained by homologous recombination (10-bp deletion is underlined): 5\u2032-TGCCATCACACAGCCAGTGGTGGTGGTAGCCATTGTGGGT-3. This founder was bred with C57BL/6N females to generate heterozygous progeny for subsequent intercrossing. Two founders (a male and a female) carrying identical 1-bp deletions were obtained by non-homologous end-joining (deleted bp is underlined): 5\u2032-TGCCATCACACAGCCAGTGGTGGTGGTAGCCATTGTGGGT-3. These two founders were intercrossed to directly generate homozygous progeny. Both the 10-bp (designated KO line 1) and 1 bp (designated KO line 2) deletions lead to frameshifts and premature stop codons in Gbp5 exon 2. All animal experiments were approved (license 2239, Kantonales Veterin\u00e4ramt Basel-Stadt) and performed according to local guidelines (Tierschutz-Verordnung, Basel-Stadt) and the Swiss animal protection law (Tierschutz-Gesetz). Female BALB/c mice (10\u201314 weeks old) were infected intravenously with mCherry-positive Salmonella (1,000\u2009c.f.u.) and euthanized 4\u20135\u2009days later. For antibody injections, mice (n = 3 per group) received on day 3 two intraperitoneal injections of 200\u2009\u03bcl PBS containing 0.2\u2009mg anti-IFN-\u03b3 monoclonal antibody (Clone XMG1.2, BioLegend) or 0.2\u2009mg rat IgG1, \u03ba isotype control antibody (clone RTK2071, BioLegend). No randomization or blinding was performed. BMDMs were differentiated in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% v/v FCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10% MCSF (L929 cell supernatant), 10\u2009mM HEPES (Invitrogen), and nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen). 1\u2009day before infection, macrophages were seeded into 6-, 24-, or 96-well plates at a density of 1.25\u2009\u00d7\u2009106, 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105, or 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 per well. If required macrophages were pre-stimulated with PAM3CSK4, LPS O111:B4 (InvivoGen), mIFN-\u03b2 or mIFN-\u03b3 (eBioscience). For infections with S. typhimurium, V. cholerae, E. cloacae, C. koseri and B. thailandensis, bacteria were grown overnight in LB or TSB at 37\u2009\u00b0C with aeration. The bacteria were diluted in fresh pre-warmed macrophage medium and added to the macrophages at an multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 100:1 for measurements of caspase-11 and caspase-1 activity or 10:1 for all other assays. For assaying Salmonella-induced NLRC4 activation, Salmonella were subcultured for 4\u2009h before infection to induce SPI-1 T3SS and flagellin expression. S. flexneri were cultured overnight in TSB medium and subcultured for 3\u2009h before infection to induce T3SS expression. IFN-\u03b3-primed BMDMs (to induce GBP expression) were infected with m.o.i. of 30:1 with S. flexneri for FACS analysis. When required, chemical reagents, Apocynin (Sigma Aldrich, 100\u03bcM), l-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (l-NAME; Sigma Aldrich, 100\u2009\u03bcM) and 3-methyladenine (Sigma Aldrich, 5\u2009mM) were added 30\u2009min before infection. The plates were centrifuged for 15\u2009min at 500 g to ensure comparable adhesion of the bacteria to the cells and placed at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 60\u2009min. Next, 100\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 gentamycin (Invitrogen) was added to kill extracellular bacteria. After a 60-min incubation, the cells were washed once with DMEM and given fresh macrophage medium containing 10\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 gentamicin for the remainder of the infection. For infections with killed bacteria, Salmonella were grown as above. Shortly before the infection, bacteria were left untreated or incubated for 30\u2009min at 95\u2009\u00b0C, in 4% paraformaldehyde or in 70% ethanol. Following the treatment, bacteria were washed with PBS and prepared for infections as outlined above. The effectiveness of the killing procedures was verified by plating serial dilutions. Transfection with poly(dA:dT) or treatment with MSU, alum or nigericin was done as described previously2 or as indicated. Gene knockdown was done using GenMute (SignaGen) and siRNA pools (siGenome, Dharmacon). Briefly, wild-type BMDMs were seeded into 24-, or 96-well plates at a density of 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 or 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 per well. siRNA complexes were prepared at 25\u2009nM siRNA in 1\u00d7 GenMute Buffer according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for forward knockdowns. siRNA complexes were mixed with BMDM medium and added onto the cells. BMDMs were infected with S. typhimurium at an m.o.i. of 100:1 after 56\u2009h of knockdown and analysed for inflammasome activation as outlined below. siRNA pools included: Casp11 (that is, Casp4) (M-042432-01), Gbp1 (M-040198-01), Gbp2 (M-040199-00), Gbp3 (M-063076-01), Gbp4 (M-047506-01), Gbp5 (M-054703-01), Gbp6 (M-041286-01), Gbp7 (M-061204-01), Gbp8 (M-059726-01), Gbp9 (M-052281-01), Gbp10 (M-073912-00), Gbp11 (M-079932-00) and NT (non-targeting) pool 2 (D-001206-14). See Supplementary information for sequences. Macrophages were seeded as described above. Cells were prestimulated with 10 ug\u2009ml\u22121 of PAM3CSK4 for 4\u2009h in Opti-MEM and transfected for 16\u2009h with ultrapure LPS E. coli O111:B4, ultrapure LPS E. coli K12 or ultrapure LPS Salmonella minnesota (InvivoGen) in complex with FuGeneHD (Promega) as described previously2. IL-1\u03b2 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 was measured by ELISA (eBioscience). LDH was measured using LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Clontech). To normalize for spontaneous lysis, the percentage of LDH release was calculated as follows: (LDH infected\u2009\u2212\u2009LDH uninfected)/(LDH total lysis\u2009\u2212\u2009LDH uninfected)*100. Western blotting was done as described before4. Antibodies used were rat anti-mouse caspase-1 antibody (1:1,000; 4B4; Genentech), rat anti-mouse caspase-11 (1:500; 17D9; Sigma), rabbit anti-IL-1\u03b1 (1:1,000; ab109555; Abcam), rabbit anti-IL-18 (1:500; 5180R; Biovision), goat anti-mouse IL-1\u03b2 antibody (1:500; AF-401-NA; R&D Systems) and rabbit anti-GBP2 and rabbit anti-GBP5 (1:1,000; 11854-1-AP/13220-1-AP; Proteintech). Cell lysates were probed with anti-\u03b2-actin antibody (Sigma) at 1:2,000. Statistical data analysis was done using Prism 5.0a (GraphPad Software, Inc.). To evaluate the differences between two groups (cell death, cytokine release, FACS, CFU and immunofluorescence-based counts) the two-tailed t-test was used. In figures NS indicates \u2018not significant\u2019, P values are given in figure legends. Macrophages were seeded on glass coverslips and infected as described above. At the desired time points cells were washed 3\u00d7 with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Following fixation coverslips were washed and the fixative was quenched with 0.1\u2009M glycine for 10\u2009min at room temperature. Coverslips were stained with primary antibodies at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 16\u2009h, washed 4\u00d7 with PBS, incubated for 1\u2009h with appropriate secondary antibodies at room temperature (1:500, AlexaFluor, Invitrogen), washed 4\u00d7 with PBS and mounted on glass slides with Vectashield containing 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Labs). Antibodies used were rabbit anti-LC3 (1:1,000; NB600-1384, Novus), mouse anti-LC3 (1:100, 2G6, NanoTools), guinea-pig anti-p62 (1:100, GP62-C, Progen), goat anti-Salmonella (1:500, CSA-1 and CSA-1-FITC, KPL), mouse anti-galectin-8 (1:1,000, G5671, Sigma), goat anti-galectin-8 (1:100, AF1305, R&D), rabbit anti-Optineurin (1:100, ab23666, Abcam), rabbit anti-NDP52 (1:100, D01, Abnova), anti-PDI (1:100, ADI-SPA-890, Enzo Lifesciences), anti-Calnexin (1:100, ADI-SPA-860-D, Enzo Lifesciences), goat anti-GBP1-5 (1:100, sc-166960, Santa Cruz Biotech), rabbit anti-GBP2 and rabbit anti-GBP5 (1:100; 11854-1-AP/13220-1-AP; Proteintech). Coverslips were imaged on a Zeiss LSM700 or a Leica SP8 at \u00d763 magnification. Colocalization studies were performed as blinded experiments, with in general a minimum count of 100 bacteria per coverslip and performed in triplicate. Immunofluorescence based counts of live (mCherry+/FITC+) and dead (mCherry\u2212/FITC+) bacteria were done as blinded experiment on z stacks taken from 15 random fields in three biological replicates, with a total of approximately 10,000 bacteria counted. Cryosections were blocked in 1% blocking reagent (Invitrogen) and 2% mouse serum (Invitrogen) in TBST (0.05% Tween in 1\u00d7 TBS pH\u20097.4), and stained with primary and secondary antibodies (goat anti-CSA1; 1:500; 01-91-99-MG; KPL and anti-GBP2; 1:100; 11854-1-AP; Proteintech). Secondary antibodies included Santa Cruz Biotech sc-362245 and Molecular Probes A21206, A21445 and A21469. Measurement of oxygen-dependent respiratory burst of BMDMs was performed by chemiluminescence in the presence of 5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phtalazinedione (luminol, Sigma Aldrich, 66\u2009\u03bcM) using a thermostatically (37\u2009\u00b0C) controlled luminometer. Both oxygen and nitrogen species were detected (O2\u2022\u2212, ONOO\u2212, OH\u2022). Chemiluminescence generation was monitored every minute for 1\u2009h after IFN-\u03b3 (100\u2009U\u2009ml\u22121) and/or Salmonella challenge and expressed as counts per minute. Nitrite production was measured by the Griess assay as previously described26. Briefly, in 96-well plates, BMDMs were infected as described above in presence or absence of IFN-\u03b3 or IL-1\u03b2 for 16\u2009h. Supernatants were mixed 1:1 with 2.5% phosphoric acid solution containing 1% sulfanilamide and 0.1% naphthylenediamine. After 30\u2009min incubation at room temperature, the nitrite concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 550\u2009nm. Sodium nitrite (Sigma) was used as a standard to determine nitrite concentrations in the cell-free medium. For flow-cytometry-based quantification of cytoplasmic and vacuolar bacteria, macrophages were infected with mCherry+ S. typhimurium or mCherry+ S. flexneri as described above. At the desired time point, cells were washed 3\u00d7 with KHM buffer (110\u2009mM potassium acetate, 20\u2009mM HEPES, 2\u2009mM MgCl2, pH\u20097.3) and incubated for 1\u2009min in KHM buffer with 150\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 digitonin (Sigma). Cells were immediately washed 2\u00d7 with KHM buffer and then stained for 12\u2009min with anti-Salmonella-FITC (1:500, CSA-1, KPL) or anti-Shigella (1:100, BP1064, Acris) in KHM buffer with 2% BSA. Secondary antibodies used for S. flexneri staining were: anti-Rabbit-488 (1:500, Invitrogen). Cells were washed 3\u00d7 with PBS and lysed in PBS with 0.1% Triton-X (Sigma) and analysed on a FACS-Canto-II. Controls were included in every assay and are described in (Extended Data Fig. 9). Infection of macrophages was performed using mCherry+ bacteria as described above. At 16\u2009h post-infection cells were washed and lysed with PBS solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich) to release intracellular bacteria. Salmonella were counterstained using an anti-Salmonella antibody (CSA-1, KPL) and analysed using a FACS Canto-II for fluorescence intensities in FL-1 and FL-2 channels. Data were analysed with FlowJo 10.0.6 software. The gate was set for the bacterial population based on the FSC/SSC and the anti-Salmonella staining (CSA-1-FITC, KPL). Controls included live mCherry-expressing and mCherry-negative Salmonella stained with anti-Salmonella antibodies (CSA-1, KPL). Download references We thank N. Mizushima and S.

        "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii possesses sets of dense granule proteins (GRAs) that either assemble at, or cross the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) and exhibit motifs resembling the HT/PEXEL previously identified in a repertoire of exported Plasmodium proteins. Within Plasmodium spp., cleavage of the HT/PEXEL motif by the endoplasmic reticulum-resident protease Plasmepsin V precedes trafficking to and export across the PVM of proteins involved in pathogenicity and host cell remodelling. Here, we have functionally characterized the T. gondii aspartyl protease 5 (ASP5), a Golgi-resident protease that is phylogenetically related to Plasmepsin V. We show that deletion of ASP5 causes a significant loss in parasite fitness in vitro and an altered virulence in vivo. Furthermore, we reveal that ASP5 is necessary for the cleavage of GRA16, GRA19 and GRA20 at the PEXEL-like motif. In the absence of ASP5, the intravacuolar nanotubular network disappears and several GRAs fail to localize to the PVM, while GRA16 and GRA24, both known to be targeted to the host cell nucleus, are retained within the vacuolar space. Additionally, hypermigration of dendritic cells and bradyzoite cyst wall formation are impaired, critically impacting on parasite dissemination and persistence. Overall, the absence of ASP5 dramatically compromises the parasite's ability to modulate host signalling pathways and immune responses.",

        "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common causative agent of community-acquired pneumonia and can penetrate epithelial barriers to enter the bloodstream and brain. We investigated intracellular fates of S. pneumoniae and found that the pathogen is entrapped by selective autophagy in pneumolysin- and ubiquitin-p62-LC3 cargo-dependent manners. Importantly, following induction of autophagy, Rab41 was relocated from the Golgi apparatus to S. pneumoniae-containing autophagic vesicles (PcAV), which were only formed in the presence of Rab41-positive intact Golgi apparatuses. Moreover, subsequent localization and regulation of K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains in and on PcAV were clearly distinguishable from each other. Finally, we found that E3 ligase Nedd4-1 was recruited to PcAV and played a pivotal role in K63-linked polyubiquitin chain (K63Ub) generation on PcAV, promotion of PcAV formation, and elimination of intracellular S. pneumoniae. These findings suggest that Nedd4-1-mediated K63Ub deposition on PcAV acts as a scaffold for PcAV biogenesis and efficient elimination of host cell-invaded pneumococci.",

It has been proposed that microbe-driven IFN upregulates GBPs to facilitate pathogen vacuole rupture and bacteriolysis preceding caspase-11 activation. We show here that macrophage death occurred independently of microbial-induced IFN signaling and that GBPs are dispensable for pathogen vacuole rupture. Instead, the host-intrinsic IFN status sustained sufficient GBP expression levels to drive caspase-1 and caspase-11 activation in response to cytosol-exposed bacteria. In addition, endogenous GBP levels were sufficient for the release of DNA from cytosol-exposed bacteria, preceding the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS/STING) pathway for Ifnb induction. Mice deficient for\u00a0chromosome 3 GBPs were unable to mount a rapid\u00a0IL-1/chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) response during Legionella-induced pneumonia, with defective bacterial clearance. Our results show that rapid GBP activity is controlled by host-intrinsic cytokine signaling and that GBP activities precede immune amplification responses, including IFN induction, inflammasome activation, and cell death.",

        "abstract": "Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis causes substantial mortality in immunocompromised individuals. Recognition of Aspergillus fumigatus by the host immune system leads to activation of the inflammasome, which provides protection against infection. However, regulation of inflammasome activation at the molecular level is poorly understood. Here, we describe two distinct pathways that coordinately control inflammasome activation during A.\u2009fumigatus infection. The C-type lectin receptor pathway activates both MAPK and NF-\u03baB signalling, which leads to induction of downstream mediators, such as the transcription factor IRF1, and also primes the inflammasomes. Toll-like receptor signalling through the adaptor molecules MyD88 and TRIF in turn mediates efficient activation of IRF1, which induces IRGB10 expression. IRGB10 targets the fungal cell wall, and the antifungal activity of IRGB10 causes hyphae damage, modifies the A.\u2009fumigatus surface and inhibits fungal growth. We also demonstrate that one of the major fungal pathogen-associated molecular patterns, \u03b2-glucan, directly triggers inflammasome assembly. Thus, the concerted activation of both Toll-like receptors and C-type lectin receptors is required for IRF1-mediated IRGB10 regulation, which is a key event governing ligand release and inflammasome activation upon A.\u2009fumigatus infection.",

        "abstract": "The transition from wakefulness to a nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep state at the onset of sleep involves a transition from low-voltage, high-frequency irregular electroencephalography (EEG) waveforms to large-amplitude, low-frequency EEG waveforms accompanying synchronized oscillatory activity in the thalamocortical circuit. The thalamocortical circuit consists of reciprocal connections between the thalamus and cortex. The cortex sends strong excitatory feedback to the thalamus, however the function of which is unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of the thalamic metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1)-phospholipase C \u03b24 (PLC\u03b24) pathway in sleep control in PLC\u03b24-deficient (PLC\u03b24) mice. The thalamic mGluR1-PLC\u03b24 pathway contains synapses that receive corticothalamic inputs. In PLC\u03b24 mice, the transition from wakefulness to the NREM sleep state was stimulated, and the NREM sleep state was stabilized, which resulted in increased NREM sleep. The power density of delta (\u03b4) waves increased in parallel with the increased NREM sleep. These sleep phenotypes in PLC\u03b24 mice were consistent in TC-restricted PLC\u03b24 knockdown mice. Moreover, in vitro intrathalamic oscillations were greatly enhanced in the PLC\u03b24 slices. The results of our study showed that thalamic mGluR1-PLC\u03b24 pathway was critical in controlling sleep architecture.",

        "abstract": "Summary  The inflammasome is an intracellular signaling complex, which on recognition of pathogens and physiological aberration, drives activation of caspase-1, pyroptosis, and the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Bacterial ligands must secure entry into the cytoplasm to activate inflammasomes; however, the mechanisms by which concealed ligands are liberated in the cytoplasm have remained unclear. Here, we showed that the interferon-inducible protein IRGB10 is essential for activation of the DNA-sensing AIM2 inflammasome by  Francisella novicida  and contributed to the activation of the LPS-sensing caspase-11 and NLRP3 inflammasome by Gram-negative bacteria. IRGB10 directly targeted cytoplasmic bacteria through a mechanism requiring guanylate-binding proteins. Localization of IRGB10 to the bacterial cell membrane compromised bacterial structural integrity and mediated cytosolic release of ligands for recognition by inflammasome sensors. Overall, our results reveal IRGB10 as part of a conserved signaling hub at the interface between\u00a0cell-autonomous immunity and innate immune sensing pathways.",

        "abstract": "The guanylate binding protein (GBP) family of interferon-inducible GTPases promotes antimicrobial immunity and cell death. During bacterial infection, multiple mouse Gbps, human GBP2, and GBP5 support the activation of caspase-1-containing inflammasome complexes or caspase-4 which trigger pyroptosis. Whether GBPs regulate other forms of cell death is not known. The apicomplexan parasite  causes macrophage death through unidentified mechanisms. Here we report that -induced death of human macrophages requires GBP1 and its ability to target  parasitophorous vacuoles through its GTPase activity and prenylation. Mechanistically, GBP1 promoted  detection by AIM2, which induced GSDMD-independent, ASC-, and caspase-8-dependent apoptosis. Identical molecular determinants targeted GBP1 to containing vacuoles. GBP1 facilitated caspase-4 recruitment to  leading to its enhanced activation and pyroptosis. Notably, GBP1 could be bypassed by the delivery of  DNA or bacterial LPS into the cytosol, pointing to its role in liberating microbial molecules. GBP1 thus acts as a gatekeeper of cell death pathways, which respond specifically to infecting microbes. Our findings expand the immune roles of human GBPs in regulating not only pyroptosis, but also apoptosis.",

When hosts are infected with T. gondii, the cells induce immune responses against T. gondii. The pathogen infection is recognized by immune sensors that directly detect T. gondii structural components, leading to production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells strongly activate T cells and induce development of Th1 cells and antigen-specific killer CD8 T cells. These T cells and Group 1 innate lymphoid cells are main producers of IFN-\u03b3, which robustly stimulates cell-autonomous immunity in cells infected with T. gondii. IFN-\u03b3-inducible effectors such as IFN-inducible GTPases, inducible nitric oxide synthase and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase differentially play important roles in suppression of T. gondii growth and its direct killing in anti-T. gondii cell-autonomous immune responses. In this review, we will describe our current knowledge of innate, adaptive and IFN-\u03b3-mediated cell-autonomous immunity against T. gondii infection.",

        "abstract": " is an important human and animal pathogen that causes life-threatening toxoplasmosis. Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) is critical for anti- cell-autonomous immunity in both humans and mice. To proliferate efficiently within the hosts, virulent strains of  can suppress IFN-\u03b3-dependent immunity. During parasite infection, it is well-characterized that various virulence effectors are secreted to transcriptionally or post-translationally target IFN-\u03b3-inducible GTPases, which are essential for anti-parasite responses in mice. However, the role of IFN-\u03b3-inducible GTPases in anti- responses in human cells is controversial since they are non-functional or absent in humans. Instead, IFN-\u03b3-induced tryptophan degradation by indole-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is important for the anti- human response. To date, the  virulent mechanism targeting IDO in human cells remains elusive. Here we show that although humans possess two IDO isozymes, IDO1 and IDO2, human cells of various origins require IDO1 but not IDO2 for IFN-\u03b3-induced cell-autonomous immunity to  secretes an effector TgIST to inhibit IDO1 mRNA expression. Taken together, the data suggests that  possesses virulence programs operated by TgIST to antagonize IFN-\u03b3-induced IDO1-mediated anti-parasite cell-autonomous immunity in human cells.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT  Although  Toxoplasma  virulence mechanisms targeting gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3)-induced cell-autonomous antiparasitic immunity have been extensively characterized in mice, the virulence mechanisms in humans remain uncertain, partly because cell-autonomous immune responses against  Toxoplasma  differ markedly between mice and humans. Despite the identification of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) as an anti- Toxoplasma  host factor in mice, here we show that iNOS in humans is a pro- Toxoplasma  host factor that promotes the growth of the parasite. The GRA15  Toxoplasma  effector-dependent disarmament of IFN-\u03b3-induced parasite growth inhibition was evident when parasite-infected monocytes were cocultured with hepatocytes. Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), produced from monocytes in a manner dependent on GRA15 and the host\u2019s NLRP3 inflammasome, combined with IFN-\u03b3 to strongly stimulate iNOS expression in hepatocytes; this dramatically reduced the levels of indole 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a critically important IFN-\u03b3-inducible anti- Toxoplasma  protein in humans, thus allowing parasite growth. Taking the data together,  Toxoplasma  utilizes human iNOS to antagonize IFN-\u03b3-induced IDO1-mediated cell-autonomous immunity via its GRA15 virulence factor.   IMPORTANCE  Toxoplasma,  an important intracellular parasite of humans and animals, causes life-threatening toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised individuals. Gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3) is produced in the host to inhibit the proliferation of this parasite and eventually cause its death. Unlike mouse disease models, which involve well-characterized virulence strategies that are used by  Toxoplasma  to suppress IFN-\u03b3-dependent immunity, the strategies used by  Toxoplasma  in humans remain unclear. Here, we show that GRA15, a  Toxoplasma  effector protein, suppresses the IFN-\u03b3-induced indole-2,3-dioxygenase 1-dependent antiparasite immune response in human cells. Because NLRP3-dependent production of IL-1\u03b2 and nitric oxide (NO) in  Toxoplasma -infected human cells is involved in the GRA15-dependent virulence mechanism, blocking NO or IL-1\u03b2 production in the host could represent a novel therapeutic approach for treating human toxoplasmosis.",

In contrast, the roles of Atg8 homologs in noncanonical autophagic processes are not fully understood. Here we show a unique role of GABARAPs, in particular gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A-receptor-associated protein-like 2 (Gabarapl2; also known as Gate-16), in interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3)-mediated antimicrobial responses. Cells that lacked GABARAPs but not LC3 proteins and mice that lacked Gate-16 alone were defective in the IFN-\u03b3-induced clearance of vacuolar pathogens such as Toxoplasma. Gate-16 but not LC3b specifically associated with the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) to mediate uniform distribution of interferon-inducible GTPases. The lack of GABARAPs reduced Arf1 activation, which led to formation of interferon-inducible GTPase-containing aggregates and hampered recruitment of interferon-inducible GTPases to vacuolar pathogens. Thus, GABARAPs are uniquely required for antimicrobial host defense through cytosolic distribution of interferon-inducible GTPases.",

        "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an important human and animal pathogen that causes life-threatening toxoplasmosis. Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) is critical for anti-T. gondii cell-autonomous immunity in both humans and mice. To proliferate efficiently within the hosts, virulent strains of T. gondii can suppress IFN-\u03b3-dependent immunity. During parasite infection, it is well characterized that various virulence effectors are secreted to transcriptionally or post-translationally target IFN-\u03b3-inducible GTPases, which are essential for anti-parasite responses in mice. However, the role of IFN-\u03b3-inducible GTPases in anti-T. gondii responses in human cells is controversial since they are non-functional or absent in humans. Instead, IFN-\u03b3-induced tryptophan degradation by indole-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is important for the anti-T. gondii human response. To date, the T. gondii virulent mechanism targeting IDO in human cells remains elusive. Here we show that although humans possess two IDO isozymes, IDO1 and IDO2, human cells of various origins require IDO1 but not IDO2 for IFN-\u03b3-induced cell-autonomous immunity to T. gondii. T. gondii secretes an effector TgIST to inhibit IDO1 mRNA expression. Taken together, the data suggests that T. gondii possesses virulence programs operated by TgIST to antagonize IFN-\u03b3-induced IDO1-mediated anti-parasite cell-autonomous immunity in human cells.",

        "abstract": " is an important human and animal pathogen that causes life-threatening toxoplasmosis. The host immune system produces interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) to inhibit  proliferation. IFN-\u03b3-inducible indole-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), which mediates tryptophan degradation, has a major role in anti- immune responses in various human cells. In response to the host's immune system,  secretes many virulence molecules into the host cells to suppress IFN-\u03b3-dependent antiparasitic immune responses. The GRA15-induced proparasitic mechanism for suppressing IDO1-dependent immune responses has previously been tested only in human hepatocyte and monocyte co-cultures. Thus, whether human cells other than hepatocytes contain this virulence mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that the GRA15-dependent virulence mechanism for suppressing the IDO1-dependent anti- response operates in human neuronal cell lines and primary human neurons. Analysis of various human cell lines revealed that IL-1\u03b2-induced iNOS-dependent reduction of IDO1 mRNA expression occurred in brain cell lines (A172; glioblastoma, IMR-32; neuroblastoma, and T98G; glioblastoma) and liver cell lines (Huh7 and HepG2), but not in other cell lines. Moreover, co-culturing type II -infected THP-1 human monocytes with the brain cell lines inhibited the IDO1-mediated anti- response in a GRA15-dependent manner. These data suggest that a GRA15-dependent virulence mechanism antagonizes the IDO1-dependent host immune response in human brain cells.",

In contrast to the advanced understanding of cytoplasmic control of NF-kappaB activation, its regulation in the nucleus has not been fully understood despite its importance in selective gene expression. We previously identified an inducible nuclear protein, IkappaB-zeta, and demonstrated that this molecule is indispensable for the expression of a group of NF-kappaB-regulated genes. In this study, we established a unique gene induction system, in which IkappaB-zeta is expressed independently of inflammatory stimuli, to specifically investigate the molecular basis underlying IkappaB-zeta-mediated gene activation. We show that in the presence of IkappaB-zeta other primary response genes are dispensable for the expression of the target secondary response genes. ChIP analyses revealed that IkappaB-zeta is required for stimulus-induced recruitment of NF-kappaB onto the target promoter in a gene-specific manner. Surprisingly, IkappaB-zeta is also necessary for the gene-selective promoter recruitment of another inflammatory transcription factor, C/EBPbeta, and the chromatin remodeling factor Brg1. We propose a new gene regulatory mechanism underlying the selective expression of inflammatory genes.",

During  infection, flagellin which is secreted through the T3SS is detected by the NLRC4 inflammasome. Activation of the NLRC4 inflammasome is believed to contribute to high IL-1\u03b2 production and pathogenicity in cystic fibrosis patients with chronic  infection. Interestingly, the majority of  isolated from cystic fibrosis patients with chronic airway infection are non-motile and T3SS-negative, suggesting that yet un-characterized inflammasome pathways regulate IL-1\u03b2 production in cystic fibrosis patients. Here we demonstrate the role of guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) in regulating bacterial proliferation and inflammasome activation in response to T3SS-negative . Bacterial ligands liberated by the action of GBP2 and IRGB10 activate caspase-11 and regulate non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1\u03b2 release. Overall, our results reveal the role of caspase-11 in inhibiting bacterial proliferation and promoting IL-1\u03b2 secretion during T3SS-negative  infection. This study suggests that non canonical inflammasomes might have co-evolved to detect Gram-negative bacterial pathogens that have evolved to bypass detection by canonical NLRs.",

We developed 200keV load-lock gun to produce ILC single bunch beam and ERL high average current beam. Both of GaAs/GaAsP superlattice and bulk-GaAs photocathode were used for this experiment. Using GaAs/GaAsP photocathode, the bunch charge of 8nC was produced at the source in a 1.6ns bunch with a 20 mm diameter laser spot at the photocathode for ILC, and 3pC in 25ps bunch was extracted for ERL with ~1.6mm laser spot diameter, respectively.",

A high gradient DC-gun that uses the NEA-GaAs type photocathode is the prime candidate of the ERL gun. We have developed of a 200keV DC-gun designed for ILC electron source and reconstructed the emittance measurement system using pepper-pot method. In this report, the optical system that can cut out some trains of mode-lock laser pulses for generating high bunch charge of more than 7.7pC/bunch and suppressing average current of less than 1\u00b5A from the GaAs photocathode are described.",

        "abstract": "The electrochemical instability has been shown to appear in the transfer of cationic surfactant ions across the 1,2-dichloroethane/water interface. Cyclic voltammograms possess all fundamental characteristics that are predicted by the theory of electrochemical instability: the presence of the instability window, that is, the potential range where the interface becomes unstable, the location of the instability window around the standard ion transfer potential of surface-active ions, and the dependence of the width of the instability window on the concentration of the surfactant ions. Electrocapillary measurements clearly demonstrate that the interface becomes unstable, while the interfacial tension is positive, being higher than 20 mN m(-1). The electrocapillary curve exhibits the discontinuities at both ends of the instability window, indicating the similarity between the electrochemical instability and the phase transitions induced by the temperature, pressure, and chemical potential. The results from voltammetry and interfacial tension measurements for cationic surfactants support the idea that the electrochemical instability, so far reported in the transfer of anionic surfactants across the liquid/liquid interface, is one of intrinsic properties of the two-phase systems where the partition of surface-active ions takes place.",

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms that at least 80% of AET molecules adsorbed are protonated in this range of chi(soln)MES, indicating that the electrostatic interaction between positively charged AET and negatively charged MES is responsible to the observed nonideality. Correspondingly, there appears only one cathodic peak in a linear-sweep voltammogram of the reductive desorption of the SAM, having a narrow full width at half-maximum of about 20 mV. This suggests the presence of strong lateral attractive interaction between the adsorbed thiolates.",

        "title": "Concentration-dependent switching of the mode of phase separation in ternary self-assembled monolayers of 2-mercaptoethane sulfonic acid, 2-aminoethanethiol and 1-dodecanethiol on Au(111)",
        "abstract": "Unusually strong apparent surface activity of the pair of 2-mercaptoethane sulfonic acid (MES) and 2-aminoethanethiol (AET) in forming a phase-separated ternary self-assembled monolayer (SAM) composed of MES, AET, and 1-dodecanethiol (DDeT) has been investigated with changing the conditions for preparing the SAM by coadsorption of the thiols from an ethanolic solution. When the total concentration of the thiols, c total , is 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol dm \u22123 or higher, the MES\u2013AET pair forms electrostatically stabilized domains from an early stage of the adsorption after the immersion of a gold substrate in the bathing ethanol solution. The total area of the MES\u2013AET domains does not change with time for longer immersion. The adsorption of DDeT is significantly weaker than the MES\u2013AET pair under such conditions, despite the fact that the intrinsic surface activity of DDeT is greater than those of MES and AET. DDeT-rich islands of typically a few nanometer across spread in the SAM and the size and the distribution of the islands are invariant over a week. In contrast, when c total is lower than 0.1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol dm \u22123 , the adsorptivity of DDeT is stronger than that of the MES\u2013AET pair, and MES and AET initially adsorbed are gradually replaced with DDeT at longer immersion time. This switching of the mode of phase separation with the change in c total suggests the crucial roles of the electrostatic interaction of MES and AET in the course of the formation of the SAM and of the hydrophilic barrier formed on the domains to prevent the replacement by hydrophobic DDeT molecules. Keywords 2-Mercaptoethane sulfonic acid 2-Aminoethanethiol 1-Dodecanethiol Ternary self-assembled monolayer Phase separation SAM Au(1 1 1) Reductive desorption Voltammetry 1 Introduction Phase-separated binary self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of thiol derivatives on metal surface [1\u201317] have recently been utilized for a variety of studies in surface electrochemistry and surface engineering, for example, the wetting of SAM surface in relation to the nanometer-scale phase separation [18] , the rate of lateral diffusion of adsorbed alkanethiolates [19] , the formation of nanopores in the SAM [20,21] , the selective deposition of metals on specific domains [22,23] , the attachment of oligonucleotides [24] , the immobilization of enzymes on the specific domains of the SAM surface [25\u201327] and the controlled release of biological cells from the surface [28] . For wider application of SAMs with well defined surface properties in nanometer scale, further elucidation of the phase properties of binary and multi-components SAMs is of decisive importance. We recently reported that the ternary self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of 2-mercaptoethane sulfonic acid (MES), 2-aminoethanethiol (AET), and 1-dodecanethiol (DDeT) formed a phase-separated two types of domains, one consisting of DDeT and the other consisting of MES\u2013AET pair [29] . Interestingly, the MES\u2013AET pair showed apparently higher surface activity than DDeT; the equal surface coverages of the two types of the domains were achieved only when the concentration of the DDeT in the bathing ethanolic solution in preparing the SAM was twice as high as that of the MES\u2013AET pair. The latter appears to be stabilized by the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged MES and the protonated AET in the SAM [30] . This stronger adsorption of the MES\u2013AET pair seemingly contradicts with the fact that the reductive desorption of the MES\u2013AET domains takes place at a potential less negative than that of the DDeT domains [29] . Surprisingly, lowering the total concentration of the thiols in the ethanolic solution to 10 \u03bcmol dm \u22123 led to the recovery of the relative adsorptivity of DDeT with respect to that of the MES\u2013AET pair [29] . This concentration dependence of the relative adsorptivity is opposite to the case of the formation of phase-separated binary SAMs composed of 3-mercapto-1-propanol (MPL) and 1-tetradecanethiol (TDT) [12] ; the adsorption of MPL having a less negative desorption potential is relatively enhanced with decreasing the total concentration of thiols. The dependence of the surface composition of SAMs on the total concentration of the thiols in the bathing solution suggests the importance of adsorption kinetics in forming the phase-separated domains. To elucidate the observed concentration-dependent surface activity of the MES\u2013AET pair, we studied the time-dependence of the surface composition in the formation of the phase-separated SAMs of MES\u2013AET\u2013DDeT using cyclic voltammetry for the reductive desorption of adsorbed thiolates on Au(1 1 1) [31] , together with polarization-modulation FTIR reflective absorption spectroscopy (PMFTIRRAS), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). This paper describes the experimental results and our interpretation for the concentration-dependent switching of the surface activity of the MES\u2013AET pair. 2 Experimental 2.1 Reagents Sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (NaMES) (Aldrich), 2-aminoethanethiol hydrochloride (AETHCl) (Aldrich) and DDeT (Wako Chem. Ind. Co.) were used without further purification. Water was purified with a Milli-Q system (Millipore Co.). All other chemicals were of reagent grade. The method of preparing gold-deposited mica having large Au(1 1 1) terraces on the surface has been described elsewhere [8] . Three-component thiol SAMs were formed on Au(1 1 1) in the ethanolic solution of NaMES, AETHCl and DDeT. The total thiol concentration in ethanol, c total , for preparing a SAM was varied from 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 to 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol dm \u22123 . The concentration of NaMES was always set to be equal to that of AETHCl. The ratio of the concentration of DDeT to the total concentration of NaMES and AETHCl in the solution, \u03c7 DDeT soln , was kept at 0.5, unless otherwise noted. Ternary SAMs composed of MES, AET and DDeT were prepared by immersing a gold substrate in the ethanolic solution of three thiols. 2.2 Measurements For cyclic voltammetry of the reductive desorption of SAMs, a gold-deposited mica coated with the SAM was mounted at the bottom of a cone-shaped cell by using an elastic O-ring [31] . The surface area of the electrode was calculated to be 0.126 cm 2 from the diameter of the O-ring. A solution of 0.5 mol dm \u22123 KOH in the cell was deaerated with Ar bubbling for 20 min. The potential, E , is referred to a Ag|AgCl (saturated KCl) electrode. All voltammetry measurements were made at the scan rate of 20 mV s \u22121 at 25 \u00b0C. PMFTIRRAS spectra were recorded with a Thermo-Mattson Infinity spectrometer equipped with a HgCdTe detector and a photoelastic modulator (Hinds, PEM-90) with the optical layout similar to that reported in the literature [32] . The signal was demodulated with a synchronous sampling demodulator (GWC Instruments). The differential reflectance was numerically converted to absorbance. All measurements were made in air at room temperature. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images were acquired in air with a NanoScope III (Digital Instruments) using Pt 80 Ir 20 tips. The conductivity of the ethanolic solution of MES and AET was measured with a conductivity meter (Kyoto Electronics, CM-117) at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of the thiol concentration on surface coverages of MES\u2013AET and DDeT Fig. 1 illustrates the effect of c total on the surface composition of phase-separated MES\u2013AET\u2013DDeT SAMs prepared by immersing the substrates in the ethanolic solution for at least 24 h. Curve \u2018a\u2019 is a cyclic voltammogram for the reductive desorption of the MES\u2013AET\u2013DDeT SAM prepared at c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol dm \u22123 and \u03c7 DDeT soln = 0.5 . Curves \u2018b\u2019, \u2018c\u2019, and d\u2019 are voltammograms for the SAMs prepared similarly at c total = 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , and 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol dm \u22123 , respectively, at the same value of \u03c7 DDeT soln . In all cases, there appeared well-separated two peaks in the forward scans; the peak at E = \u22120.68 V corresponds to the desorption of the domains mainly composed of MES\u2013AET and the peak at E = \u22121.05 V to the desorption of the DDeT-rich domains [29] . We hereafter call the peak at \u22120.68 V and that at \u22121.05 V, respectively, Peaks I and II. These voltammograms clearly illustrate the interesting dependence of the relative area of Peak I to that of Peak II on c total . When c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol dm \u22123 , the height as well as the area of Peak I is much larger than those of Peak II, that is, the adsorbed amount of MES\u2013AET is much greater than that of DDeT. However, when c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol dm \u22123 (curve \u2018c\u2019), this order is reversed; the area of Peak II is much greater than that of Peak I. The same is true when c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol dm \u22123 (curve \u2018d\u2019) and 1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 mol dm \u22123 (data not shown). Then, there must be a critical value of c total above and below which the relative strength of the adsorption of DDeT and that of MES\u2013AET is reversed. Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the peak area, Q , of Peak I on c total estimated from cyclic voltammograms for the substrates prepared at the immersion time of the substrate in the bathing solution, t imrs , being 24 h. There is a distinct jump in Q at around c total = 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 mol dm \u22123 , showing the critical value of c total for the turnover of the prevailing type of the domains on the surface. Intrinsically, DDeT is more hydrophobic than MES and AET and hence is more surface-active. This is reflected in the difference in the position of E p in Fig. 1 . In this respect, the adsorption behavior when c total < 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 mol dm \u22123 is consistent with the expectation based on thermodynamics. The inversion of the relative surface activity of MES\u2013AET by changing c total suggests that the SAM is not in adsorption equilibrium, but the surface composition is kinetically determined [33] . To elucidate this point, we examined the time dependence of the surface coverage and the adsorbed state of the thiolates at different values of c total . 3.2 Time-dependence of the voltammetric response of SAMs prepared at c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol dm \u22123 The effect of the immersion time, t imrs , on the surface composition of the SAM was examined by cyclic voltammetry. Cyclic voltammograms for the reductive desorption of the SAMs prepared at c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol dm \u22123 are displayed in Figs. 3 and 4 . Corresponding variations in the peak potential, E p , the area under the peak, Q , and the full width at half maximum, FWHM, for two major peaks around \u22120.7 and \u22121.05 V are plotted against t imrs in Figs. 5\u20137 . It can be seen in Fig. 3 that even at t imrs = 2 s, the narrow peak appeared at \u22120.68 V (curve \u2018a\u2019 in Fig. 3 ). E p and Q for this peak little varied with prolonged immersion up to 8 days (see also Figs. 5 a and 6 a). This unchanging shape of the peak at \u22120.68 V with t imrs implies that the MES\u2013AET domains, whose size is large enough to give a peak at this potential, are formed even 2 s after the immersion of the substrate in the ethanolic solution; the MES\u2013AET domains once formed are resistant against the replacement by DDeT present in the solution phase for more than a week. In the voltammogram at t imrs = 2 s, there is a small hump around E = \u22121.0 V, together with a broad peak at \u22120.85 V. With increasing t imrs this broad peak became less conspicuous and a new peak emerged at a more negative potential and shifted to \u22121.05 V. This peak indicates the formation of the DDeT-rich domains where DDeT molecules are packed with the tilt angle of the hydrocarbon chain with respect to the surface normal being about 30\u00b0 [34\u201336] . This orientation was also confirmed by FTIR measurements (vide infra). The broader peak in the middle is likely to be ascribed to the desorption of less-ordered DDeT and possibly to microdomains of MES\u2013AET that are not large enough to belong to the MES\u2013AET domains giving the desorption peak at \u22120.68 V [8] . 3.3 Time-dependence of the voltammetric response of SAMs prepared at c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol dm \u22123 The lowering of c total dramatically changed the shape of a series of voltammograms. Fig. 4 shows voltammograms for the SAM prepared at several values of t imrs when c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol dm \u22123 . In contrast to the voltammograms in Fig. 3 , no sharp peak is seen at \u22120.68 V when t imrs = 2 s and 1 min (curves \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019). A broad peak at less negative potential of about \u22120.55 V is discerned (curves \u2018b\u2019 and \u2018c\u2019). This peak grew with time. Simultaneously, the peak potential shifted toward the negative direction and the FWHM narrowed. When t imrs was longer than 5 h, the peak shifted to \u22120.7 V, that is, more negative than \u22120.68 V ( Fig. 5 a). The E p further shifted to the negative direction at larger values of t imrs with broadening of the peak. The FWHM narrowed with time ( Fig. 7 a), but was never as small as 25 mV. After 8 days of immersion, the peak around \u22120.7 V disappeared and a much broader peak appeared at \u22120.8 V (curve \u2018i\u2019 in Fig. 4 ). In some samples, even this broad peak was incognizable in the voltammograms (curve \u2018j\u2019 in Fig. 4 ). Eventually, MES\u2013AET domains thus appear to be entirely replaced with DDeT, in contrast to the case shown in Fig. 3 . Peak II in Fig. 4 grew with t imrs . Concomitantly, the broad peak at \u22120.9 V seen at shorter t imrs values disappeared. At t imrs = 24 h, the area under the peak for the DDeT domains is more than twice as large as that of the MES\u2013AET domains. This is distinctively different from the results in Fig. 3 , where the area for the DDeT domains is about one fifth of that for the MES\u2013AET domains. The greater area of Peak II in Fig. 4 seems to go along with the difference in the hydrophobicity between the DDeT and the MES\u2013AET pair. That is to say, the results in Fig. 4 are in accordance with intrinsic surface activities of DDeT and MES or AET and highlight the peculiarity in adsorption at c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol dm \u22123 . A further lowering of c total to 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol dm \u22123 resulted in voltammograms whose basic features are similar to those observed in Fig. 4 (voltammograms not shown, see Figs. 5\u20137 ). From the comparison of CVs in Fig. 3 and those in Fig. 4 , one can see that the change in c total brings about a drastic change in the surface coverage of MES\u2013AET and DDeT from the early stage of the formation of the SAM. 3.4 Variation of Peak I with t imrs To take a closer look at the dependence of the surface composition on t imrs , E p , Q , and FWHM for Peaks I and II are plotted against t imrs at four different values, 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , and 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol dm \u22123 , in Figs. 5\u20137 . When c total is 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol dm \u22123 or higher, E p is about \u22120.68 V and little varies with t imrs (see also Fig. 3 ). Correspondingly, both Q and FWHM values in Figs. 6 a and 7 a are almost constant at 70 \u03bcC cm \u22122 and 25 mV, respectively, over t imrs values from 2 s to 8 days ( Fig. 3 ). In the case of both MES\u2013AET binary SAMs and single-component DDeT SAMs, the value of Q is about 100 \u03bcC cm \u22122 at the same scan rate [29,30] . The surface coverage of MES\u2013AET domains in the present case is thus estimated to be 0.7, assuming that the charging current contribution to the peak area is the same for all these cases. The value of the FWHM, 25 mV, agrees with the value of the binary MES\u2013AET SAMs [30] and indicates that the solubility of DDeT in the MES\u2013AET domains is low, throughout the range of t imrs studied [29] . Lowering of c total greatly altered the position and the shape of Peak I ( Figs. 5 a, 6 a, and 7 a), as described above. When c total is 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol dm \u22123 , the peak appeared at \u22120.58 V at t imrs = 2 s and gradually shifted to a negative potential with time, approaching to \u22120.71 V ( Fig. 5 a), which is about 30 mV more negative to the E p at higher values of c total . The FWHM at lower values of c total correspondingly decreased with t imrs . It might appear that such shifts in both E p and FWHM reflect the gradual formation of the MES\u2013AET domains similar to those observed at higher c total values. However, the nature of Peak I at lower concentrations seems to be considerably different. When t imrs is 24 h, the FWHM at different c total values did not converge to a single value around 25 mV that is supposed to be a value for the desorption of neat MES\u2013AET domains [30] . Rather, the FWHM depended on c total and was larger for smaller values of c total . This suggests that at lower c total values DDeT dissolved into MES\u2013AET domains and the degree of the dissolution is greater at lower concentrations. When c total was further lowered to 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol dm \u22123 , E p and Q basically varied in parallel with those at c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol dm \u22123 . However, the FWHM showed a sudden transition from 180 to 80 mV at t imrs = 40 min. This change is concurrent with a similar transitions of Q and FWHM of Peak II ( Fig. 6 b and 7 b). The transition of FWHM in Peak I is thus correlated with the transition in the DDeT-rich domains. This concurrent transitions of the two types of domains is suggestive of the mechanism of domain formation and will be further discussed below. 3.5 Variation of Peak II with t imrs The time-dependence of E p and of FWHM for the desorption of DDeT domains at different values of c total is shown in Figs. 5 b, 6 b, and 7 b. There is no significant dependence of E p on both t imrs and c total ( Fig. 6 a). On the other hand, the peak at small t imrs values was broad when c total was 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol dm \u22123 , but the FWHM at different values of c total converged to about 35 mV. This convergence seems to be an indication that after sufficient time the DDeT-rich domains are in an adsorption equilibrium with the bathing solution, unlike the MES\u2013AET domains. The value of 35 mV is considerably greater than 20 mV expected in the desorption of a SAM composed of alkanethiolates whose number of the methylene unit in the hydrocarbon chain is larger than 10 [37] . It is most likely that the broad FWHM in Fig. 7 b at longer t imrs is caused by the significant dissolution of MES and AET in the DDeT domains [29] . When c total was 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol dm \u22123 , E p was only slightly more negative than those at higher values of c total . However, Figs. 6 b and 7 b show that Q and FWHM both undergo sharp transitions at t imrs = 40 min, in concurrence with FWHM of Peak I, as described above. The transition in Peak II obviously reflects the change in the orientation of DDeT molecules from a lying-down phase to a standing-up phase similar to single-component SAMs of alkanethiolates [38,39] . FTIR data shown below ( Fig. 8 ) confirm this supposition. An interesting fact here is that the concurrence of the transitions of Peaks I and II was seen when c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol dm \u22123 ; the cooperative change in DDeT-rich domains seems to induce the cooperative transition in MES\u2013AET-rich domains. 3.6 Formation of DDeT-rich domains The time-dependence of CVs in Fig. 4 and that of the characteristic parameters in Figs. 5 b, 6 b and 7 b, show that DDeT-rich domains grew with t imrs when c total \u2a7d 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol dm \u22123 . At such lower c total values, DDeT molecules would have enough space to adsorb lying flat on the surface at short immersion times, as is the case of the formation of alkanethiol SAMs from gas phase [38] and that from a solution phase [39,40] . After time elapses, DDeT molecules stand up to form a densely packed DDeT domains, as seen in the dependence on t imrs of Q and FWHM in Figs. 5 b, 6 b, and 7 b at c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol dm \u22123 . Corresponding changes in FTIR are shown in Figs. 8 B and C for c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 and 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol dm \u22123 , respectively. At t imrs = 2 s, the peak at 2919 cm \u22121 ascribed to the CH 2 asymmetric stretching appeared for both substrates prepared at c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol dm \u22123 . The \u03bd as (CH 2 ) at this wavenumber is an indication that the alkyl group is lying flat on the surface [41] . With increasing t imrs , this peak shifted to 2927 cm \u22121 . Simultaneously, \u03bd s (CH 3 ) at 2880 cm \u22121 and \u03bd as (CH 3 ) at 2965 cm \u22121 , together with \u03bd as (CH 2 ) at 2855 cm \u22121 grew, showing that the alkyl chain part is gradually standing up to form tightly packed DDeT-rich domains. The change in the orientation is in agreement with the process of forming single-component alkanethiol SAMs [38,42\u201344] . The growth of DDeT domains with t imrs at lower values of c total is confirmed in STM images in Figs. 9 and 10 for c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 and 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol dm \u22123 , respectively. The phase transition of the DDeT domains at c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol dm \u22123 suggested from voltammograms is in fact seen as the growth of the domain size in a few tens min between t imrs = 30 min and 1 h ( Figs. 10 b and c). In contrast, the substrate formed at c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol dm \u22123 did not show a peak at \u03bd as (CH 2 ) = 2919 and, instead, a peak appeared at 2927 cm \u22121 even at t imrs is 2 s (curve \u2018a\u2019 in Fig. 8 A). In curve \u2018a\u2019, \u03bd s (CH 3 ) at 2880 cm \u22121 and \u03bd as (CH 3 ) at 2965 cm \u22121 are also recognized. This suggests that even at t imrs = 2 s, a substantial number of adsorbed DDeT are standing up, despite the fact that the surface coverage of the DDeT domain is about one third, irrespective of the value of t imrs ( Fig. 6 b). The invariance corresponding to those of the shapes of both voltammograms and FTIR spectra at c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol dm \u22123 is observed as the invariant size and distribution of the DDeT domains over 8 days, as shown in Fig. 11 . The DDeT domains of less than 10 nm across are spread already at t imrs = 2 s and, amazingly, the size and its distribution are retained over 8 days. 3.7 Mechanism of the formation of MES\u2013AET domains From the time-dependent behavior of phase-separated SAMs of MES\u2013AET\u2013DDeT ternary systems shown in Figs. 3\u20137 , it is clear that the concentration-dependent enhancement of the adsorption of MES\u2013AET is anomalous. From experimental results above, two different modes of phase separation of MES\u2013AET\u2013DDeT SAMs are clearly distinguished. We call these two modes observed above and below c total = 0.3 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol dm \u22123 PS-mode I and PS-mode II, respectively. When a gold surface is exposed to a solution containing MES, AET and DDeT, the probability of finding one of these thiols per unit area per unit time in the solution phase next to the surface must be the same at any value of c total , provided that no association between these adsorbates exists in the bathing solution. If all thiols reached at the surface adsorb on the surface according to this probability, the change in c total would not cause the change in the relative surface coverages of DDeT-rich domains and MES\u2013AET-rich domains, at least when the surface coverage is small. A diffusion-limited adsorption of a surface-active substance i to a planar clean surface is proportional to the concentration of the adsorbate, c i , and to the square-root of its diffusion coefficient, D i [45] : (1) \u0393 i ( t ) = 2 D i t c i b \u03c0 where \u0393 i ( t ) is the adsorbed amount of i at time t . When c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol dm \u22123 , the number of thiol molecules that are transported to the clean surface is about 3.6 \u00d7 10 \u22129 mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 , assuming the value of D i being 10 \u22125 cm 2 s \u22121 . This initial flux is more than enough to fully cover the surface sites in 0.1 s, forming the ( 3 \u00d7 3 ) R 30 \u00b0 structure, which gives a value of 7.6 \u00d7 10 \u221210 cm \u22122 for the number of adsorption sites on Au(1 1 1). This is in fact a simplified picture for the time-dependence of adsorption, because the incorporation of an adsorption isotherm inevitably leads to much longer time for the full coverage [46] . Nevertheless, the value estimated provides a rule of thumb for the time required for full coverage. Practically, a gold surface would be fully covered with thiols immediately after the immersion of a gold substrate unless c total is extremely small, because the immersion and the succeeding withdrawal of a substrate should cause the hydrodynamic turbulence of the bathing solution. It is then likely that adsorbed MES (AET) can easily find AET (MES) in the vicinity, either in the adjacent sites or in the solution next to the surface, to form an electrostatically stabilized ion pair on the surface. In the present study, MES and AET are dissolved as salts, NaMES and AETHCl, in the bathing solution. However, the conductance measurements (data not shown) showed a monotonous change when the mixing ratio of NaMES and AETHCl was changed while keeping c total at 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol dm \u22123 . The ion pair formation of MES and AET in the ethanol solution is thus negligible. On the other hand, the lateral electrostatic interaction between adsorbed MES and AET should be enhanced on the surface where the dielectric constant is lower than in the bulk. Another possibility, the formation of an ion pair between the adsorbed MES (AET) and AET (MES) in the solution side, seems to be negligible, because there is no FTIR signal in the 2560 cm \u22121 region for the SH group in the coadsorption of MES and AET [30] . The formation of isolated ion pairs on the surface would not give the reductive desorption peak at \u22120.68 V that is ascribed to the domains of MES and AET [29] consisting of more than several tens pairs [8] . In fact, the curves a\u2013d in Fig. 4 show a peak at potentials more positive than \u22120.68 V. We speculate that once the pair is formed on the surface the dipole-ion and multipole-ion interactions further facilitate the growth of MES\u2013AET domains in a cooperative manner. MES\u2013AET domains seem to limit the orientation of DDeT molecules on the surface by restricting the surface available to DDeT for the adsorption. A plausible explanation is to assume a mechanism that the squeezing of lying-down DDeT molecules by prompt growth of MES\u2013AET domains results in the formation of heaps of DDeT in the sea of MES\u2013AET and facilitated the standing-up orientation of DDeT molecules. This picture is in harmony with the fact that the size and the distribution of the DDeT-rich domains in STM images are unchanged over 8 days ( Fig. 11 ). The long-term stability of MES\u2013AET domains over one week against DDeT in PS-mode I suggests a certain mechanism that significantly slows down the replacement of adsorbed MES\u2013AET domains with DDeT in the solution phase. As the replacement of MES and AET with DDeT does take place when c total \u2a7d 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol dm \u22123 , the MES\u2013AET domains in the PS-mode I should have a certain barrier against the attack of DDeT from the solution side. Given the hydrophobicity of DDeT molecules, we believe that the hydrophilic surface of MES\u2013AET domains once formed prevents the approach of DDeT molecules in the close proximity. A similar slower replacement of hydrophilic domains with hydrophobic thiols forming domains stabilized by hydrogen bonding has been found in the SAM of mercaptododecanoic acid with dodecanethiol [47] . When c total \u2a7d 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol dm \u22123 , an adsorbed thiolate molecule will see few neighbors on the adjacent sites at short immersion time. A thiol molecule that arrives at the surface would adsorb on the surface without being influenced by neighboring thiolate molecules. This supposition is confirmed in the similar Q values for Peaks I and II at c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol dm \u22123 at short t imrs values ( Figs. 6 a and b). Only after some time, adsorbed molecules would feel the influence of other adsorbed molecules. Isolated MES and AET molecules on the surface would readily be separated by adsorbed DDeT or even replaced with DDeT through the exchange reaction. The latter process is traced as the growth of Peak II with t imrs in Fig. 6 b. In the PS-mode II, the difference in the intrinsic adsorptivity between MES\u2013AET and DDeT is thus reflected in the surface composition. An interesting question is why the thresholding value of c total is about 0.3 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol dm \u22123 . We hypothesize that the density of adsorbed molecules at the very early stage of the SAM formation is crucial in determining the adsorption modes. For creating a MES\u2013AET pair or a nucleus for a MES\u2013AET domain, sporadically adsorbed MES and AET should find a partner, AET and MES, respectively, in the vicinity, before they are replaced with DDeT. This competitive process seems to determine the thresholding level of c total . The replacement reaction is a slow process, as can be envisaged in the disappearance of Peak I after 8 days of immersion in Fig. 4 . A simple but plausible picture is that for the cooperative formation of the MES\u2013AET domains adsorbed MES (AET) must find AET (MES) in one of the nearest neighbor sites before encountering DDeT in one of the nearest neighbors. If we take the time for the full coverage estimated by Eq. (1) as an approximate measure of the time scale of finding the partner in the adjacent site, the time for the full coverage at c total = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol dm \u22123 would be on the order of 0.2 s. If the time scale of the replacement reaction is longer than 0.4 s, the MES\u2013AET domains prevail. Though no data is available for the rate of the replacement of an isolated thiolate on Au(1 1 1), this time scale seems to be in harmony with the time scale of the disappearance of Peak I in Fig. 4 . Further experiments of the formation of ternary MES\u2013AET\u2013DDeT SAMs with changing \u03c7 DDeT soln would find a clue to estimate a more detailed picture of the thresholding. 4 Conclusions The MES\u2013AET pair shows unusually strong surface activity in comparison with that of DDeT, only when c total is higher than 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 mol dm \u22123 . The relative rates of two competitive processes, the formation of electrostatically stabilized MES\u2013AET domains and the replacement of sporadically adsorbed MES and AET with DDeT, determine the threshold level of c total for the reversal of the predominant species in the ternary SAM. Once the MES\u2013AET domains are formed, this kinetically-trapped hydrophilic domains are resistant to the replacement by DDeT in the solution phase and are stable over one week in the ethanolic solution containing DDeT on the order of \u00d7 10 \u22123 mol dm \u22123 . This type of domain formation can be made use of in designing multi-component SAMs. Acknowledgements This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (No. 14205120) and a Grant-in-Aid for Exploratory Research (No. 15655008) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Japan.

A dense layer of liquid molecules, which is orientationally ordered, is formed near the metal surface, but this surface-induced structure extends about only three molecular diameters from the surface. This result is in good accord with the recent experimental observations.",

MES and AET behave virtually as a single surface-active species. Two distinct reductive desorption peaks in cyclic voltammograms (CV) and binarized images of scanning tunneling microscopy clearly show nanometer scale, yet macroscopically distinguishable, phase separation over a wide range of the mixing ratio of DDeT and MES-AET in the bathing solution. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements indicate that the ratio of MES to AET in the hydrophilic domains is unity and that both terminal groups are in the charged states, that is, the sulfonate group and the ammonium group. With decreasing the total concentration of the thiols, the mole fraction of DDeT in the bathing solution at which the surface coverage of MES-AET domains is equal to that of DDeT domains dramatically decreases. This suggests that the adsorption kinetics plays a crucial role in the formation of the domains structure.",

The second method utilizes fluoren-9-ylmethyl N -(11-mercaptoundecyl) carbamate (FMUCe) instead of 11-amino-1-undecanethiol in preparing the template. After the filling with CDTe, the 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group is removed to obtain AUTe domains. Both methods yield artificially phase-separated binary SAMs having AUTe domains of tens nanometer across. The molecularly flat SAM surface with nanometer-scale domains of different acid-base and electrostatic properties are thus created. For preparing binary SAMs with a higher degree of phase separation, the second method is a better choice; a more clear-cut phase separation is achieved.

The variation of the values is ascribed to the change in the surface potential on the solution side of the electrode|solution interface due to the difference in the dipole moments of alkanethiolates on Au(1 1 1), which is supported by the ab initio calculation of these thiolates adsorbed on a four-atom cluster of Au atoms.

Sondag-Huethorst and Fokkink first introduced the Wilhelmy method for determining the pzc of thiol-covered polycrystalline electrodes and estimated the pzc of the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of octadecanethiolate (ODT) in contact with 0.01 mol dm \u22123 K 2 SO 4 to be located at \u22120.45 V (vs. SCE) [1] , which is about 0.8 V more negative to the pzc of bare gold in contact with 0.1 mol dm \u22123 NaClO 4 , 0.33 V (vs. SCE) [6] . The chain length of the alkanethiolate did not significantly affect the location of the pzc; the SAMs of dodecanethiolate and behenoylthiolate on gold show similar pzc values [3] , which seems to be at variance with the surface potential measurements for a series of alkanethiol SAMs [7] . On the other hand, the substitution of the \u03c9-terminal to another polar group resulted in a marked shift of the pzc [4] in the positive direction. This shift is consistent with the double layer capacitance measurements of \u03c9-hydroxyltetradecanethiolate SAM on gold in contact with submillimolar aqueous sodium trifluoroacetate at 0 \u00b0C [2] . As the packing of alkanethiolate molecules on polycrystalline gold is likely to be less ordered [8] , the contact angle and other electrocapillary properties of SAMs formed on a single crystal surface or a metal surface of similar quality are desirable in further studies of the double layer properties of SAM-covered electrodes. crystal surface, the sessile drop method is preferable to the Wilhelmy method. For this purpose, the contact angle of a sessile drop is preferable to the Wilhelmy plate method, in that a small droplet of an aqueous or other solution can be placed on a single crystal surface or its equivalent. The control of the potential drop across the droplet solution and the electrode surface is feasible through electrodes inserted into the droplet. In fact, the potential-dependent wetting has been achieved in the case of a larger drop of 10 s of mm diameter by controlling the potential drop across the interface between the drop and the SAM on a polycrystalline gold substrate by inserting Ag and Pt wires [9,10] . In this paper, we report the contact angle measurements of an aqueous solution on Au(1 1 1)-facet-prevalent electrodes covered with alkanethiolate SAMs using a sessile drop under potential-controlled conditions, which is achieved by inserting a reference electrode and a counter electrode in an aqueous droplet of less than 1 \u03bcl. 2 Experimental 1-octadecanethiol (ODT; Aldrich), 1-undecanethiol (UDT; Tokyo Kasei, Japan), 1-propanethiol (PT; Aldrich), and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanethiol (PFDT; ABCR, Germany) were used without further purification. Other reagents were of reagent grade. Gold (99.99%) was vapor-deposited on freshly cleaved mica sheets at a reduced pressure, <1.3\u00d710 \u22123 Pa. The temperature of the mica sheet was maintained at 580 \u00b0C during the vapor deposition. The Au-deposited mica sheets were subsequently annealed at 550 \u00b0C for 8 h and then quenched in water to obtain Au(1 1 1), facet-prevailing gold substrates, which in 0.01 mol dm \u22123 HClO 4 gave cyclic voltammograms whose shape well agreed with that reported in the literature [11] . STM imaging also confirmed the prevalence of Au(1 1 1) terraces on the sheets thus prepared. The roughness factor of the Au surface was estimated to be 1.05 from the underpotential deposition of Pb 2+ [12] . Alkanethiol SAMs were prepared by immersing Au-coated mica substrates for at least 24 h in an ethanol solution containing an alkanethiol at 1 mmol dm \u22123 . The substrate was then washed first with ethanol and then water, and dried under a stream of dry argon gas. Cyclic voltammograms of the reductive desorption of alkanethiol SAMs were recorded in 0.5 mol dm \u22123 KOH using a Ag|AgCl|saturated KCl electrode (SSSE) as the reference electrode and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. The solution was deaerated with argon bubbling for at least 10 min. Fig. 1 illustrates the arrangement of the experimental setup for contact angle measurements. A SAM-coated gold substrate was placed on a XYZ stage. The level of the stage was adjusted with a spirit level. A drop of 0.8 \u03bcl aqueous 0.1 mol dm \u22123 NaClO 4 solution was put on the center of the gold electrode. Such a small volume of the droplet was used, so that the shape of the drop was approximated as spherical in the contact angle analysis. The shape of the drop was captured with a CCD video camera (640 \u00d7 480 pixels, CS3300, Tokyo Electronics, Japan) with lighting from the backside of the drop using a tungsten lamp. A glass capillary having an orifice of about 1 \u03bcm, filled with saturated aqueous KCl solution and a Ag|AgCl wire as a reference electrode, was inserted into a drop on the hidden side from the video camera, so that the shape of the drop in the video image was not distorted. A platinum wire of 1 \u03bcm diameter was inserted in the drop as a counter electrode in a similar manner. The XYZ stage, the two electrodes that were connected to a head box housing an operational amplifier for a potentiostat circuit (HECS-972 head box, Fusou, Japan), and the video camera, were housed in a shield box. Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the thresholded images of the sessile drops before and after the insertion of the electrodes into the drop, respectively. Fig. 2(c) shows that these two images are completely superimposable, assuring that by choosing the location of the insertion properly, the effect of the two electrodes on the shape captured as a video image of the drop can be minimized. Video images from the video camera were converted to digital data using a media converter (DVMC-MS1, Sony, Japan) and stored in a personal computer. From the circumference of the video image of a drop, we evaluated the contact angle, assuming that the shape of the drop is spherical, using the relation: tan \u03b8 2 = 2h d , where \u03b8 is the contact angle, h is the height of the apex of the drop from the substrate surface, and d is the diameter of the circle of the drop contacting the substrate. We did not control the humidity inside the shielding box when recording the contact angle at a scan rate of 20 mV s \u22121 over 400 mV, that is, for 20 s. In the case of 50% relative humidity, the contact angle gradually decreased with time at the rate of \u22480.8 \u00b0 min \u22121 . For measurements at lower scan rates, control of the humidity seems to be desirable. The reversal of the potential usually gave higher values of the contact angle at positive potentials due to the hysteresis. A glass capillary used for the reference electrode was prepared by drawing a glass tube of 1 mm outer and 0.6 mm inner diameters with a central core of a glass fiber (GDC-1, Narishige, Japan) using a pipette puller (PC-10, Narishige), so that the tip orifice became \u22481 \u03bcm outer diameter. The capillary was then filled with a saturated KCl solution and a Ag|AgCl electrode was sealed into the capillary with epoxy resin. All experiments were made at ambient temperature, 25\u00b12 \u00b0C. 3 Results and discussion First, we examined the controllability of the potential between the aqueous 0.1 mol dm \u22123 NaClO 4 solution in the drop and the UDT-modified electrode by measuring the contact angle as a function of the applied voltage, E . The results are shown in Fig. 3 . The contact angle of about 102\u00b0 was constant from \u22120.8 to \u22121.1 V and then decreased sharply to 70\u00b0 when E was changed from \u22121.1 to \u22121.3 V. This decrease reflects the reductive desorption of adsorbed UDT [13,14] and clearly demonstrates that the potential across the microdroplet and the SAM-modified gold electrode is controlled with the reference micropipette capillary and the counter electrode. Voltammograms of the reductive desorption of UDT SAM recorded separately also gave a peak at this potential (data not shown, see also [15] ). Fig. 4(a)\u2013(d) show the results of the contact angle measurements for ODT, UDT, PT, and PFDT SAMs in contact with 0.1 mol dm \u22123 NaClO 4 . The potential was scanned from 0.85 to \u22120.9 V, where the reductive desorption was absent, at a scan rate of 20 mV s \u22121 . Vertical bars in Fig. 4(a)\u2013(d) show the standard deviation for at least quintuplet measurements. For alkanethiol SAMs, the scanning of the potential resulted in higher contact angles at negative potentials, exhibiting a maximum. By fitting experimental data to a fourth-order polynomial (solid lines in Fig. 4(a)\u2013(d) ), we obtained the potential, E max , for each curve where the contact angle had a maximum ( Table 1 ). In general, the contact angle ( \u03b8 ) is related to the interfacial tensions of three boundaries through Young\u2019s equation [16] , \u03b3 sg =\u03b3 sl +\u03b3 lg cos \u03b8, where \u03b3 sg , \u03b3 sl , and \u03b3 lg are the interfacial tension between the solid|gas, solid|liquid, and liquid|gas interfaces, respectively. In the present experiment, it is reasonable to assume that \u03b3 sg and \u03b3 lg remain unchanged during the scan of the voltage. Therefore the change in \u03b8 with E is a measure of the change in \u03b3 sl with E , (1) \u2202 \u03b3 sl \u2202 E=\u03b3 lg sin \u03b8 \u2202 \u03b8 \u2202 E . On the other hand, for solid electrodes, the Gibbs\u2013Duhem equation at constant temperature is given by [17,18] : (2) \u2212 d \u03b3=\u03c3 M d E+\u2211 i \u0393 i d \u03bc i +(\u03b3\u03b4 pq \u2212g pq ) d \u03f5 pq , where \u03b3 \u2261 \u03b3 sl , \u03c3 M is the excess surface charge density in the metal electrode, \u0393 i and \u03bc i are the relative surface excess and the chemical potential of the component i , \u03b4 pq is Kronecker delta, g pq is the stress, \u03f5 pq is the strain, and the subscript pq means that the sum of the terms is taken when an index appears twice. Then, the generalized Lippmann equation has the form [17] : (3) \u2212 \u2202 \u03b3 \u2202 E T,\u03bc i =\u03c3 M +(\u03b3\u03b4 pq \u2212g pq ) \u2202 \u03f5 pq \u2202 E T,\u03bc i . According to the analysis of the gold electrode, the last term is much smaller than the first term and, hence, the surface charge density can be measured electrochemically [17,19,20] . The potential at the maximum contact angle vs. E plot should then correspond to the pzc, that is, E max = E pzc . The value of E pzc for ODT, \u22120.52 V (vs. SSSE) is close to \u22120.42 V (vs. SCE), that is, \u22120.46 V (vs. SSSE) of ODT SAM on polycrystalline gold [3] and \u22120.40 V (vs. SCE) for dodecanethiolate SAM on polycrystalline gold probed by the Stark effect [5] . With decreasing chain length, E pzc shifted in the positive direction: \u22120.49 V for UDT and \u22120.30 V for PT. Such a shift of E pzc with the alkyl chain length was not observed for alkanethiol SAMs on polycrystalline gold for n =11, 17, and 21 [3] , where n is the number of methylene moieties. The curvature of the plots in Fig. 4(a)\u2013(c) becomes greater with decreasing n . This agrees with the results of contact angle measurements using the Wilhelmy method with polycrystalline gold [3] and reflects the increase in the capacitance of the SAMs with decreasing n [3] . This also agrees with the finding from impedance measurements that the decanethiol SAM on Au(1 1 1) in contact with the aqueous NaClO 4 at the pzc of bare Au(1 1 1) can be represented as a capacitor in series with the solution resistance [21] . For alkanethiol SAMs, the contact angle of water increases with increasing chain length [22] . This trend is the same as the results in Table 1 . In the present case, however, the contact angle values at E pzc were 103.3, 99.8, and 84.0\u00b0 for ODT, UDT, and PT, respectively. These values are lower than the advancing contact angle of the SAMs on polycrystalline gold, 118\u00b0 for sufficiently long alkanethiolates [23,24] , and are comparable with receding contact angles of about 100\u00b0 [23,24] . As the scanning from positive to negative potential causes the increase in the contact angle, the data shown in Fig. 4(a)\u2013(c) are to be understood as receding angles that are about 10\u00b0 lower than the corresponding advancing angles for alkanethiolate SAMs and water [23,25] . The decrease in the contact angle with shortening chain length of the alkanethiolates in SAMs is usually ascribed to the looser packing of the adsorbed molecules [22,26] . On the other hand, however, the STM imaging of PT and HDT from STM on Au(1 1 1) shows that shorter alkanethiolates also fully cover the Au(1 1 1) surface [27,28] ; the surface density of the methyl-terminal group does not vary with n . A recent sum frequency generation (SFG) study suggested that the all- trans conformation is retained even for SAMs with a shorter alkyl chain length such as PT, and SAMs with shorter alkyl chain lengths are a few degrees more tilted from the surface normal in comparison with SAMs of longer alkyl chain alkanethiolates [29] . It is therefore likely that the surface density of alkanethiolates on Au(1 1 1) remains unchanged with n and there is no significant disorder of the alkyl chain part of the SAMs with smaller n . Smaller contact angles for PT SAM would rather reflect the fact that the value of the contact angle is determined not only by the nature of the \u03c9 terminal group, but also by the internal energy and entropy of the entire system. In the case of the PDFT SAMs, the contact angle did not show a marked dependence on the applied potential, but exhibited a curve with a slightly convex curvature. The maximum is located at 1.04 V, which is 1.5 V more positive than those for alkanethiolate SAMs and is also 0.7 V more positive than the pzc of bare Au(1 1 1) in contact with 0.1 mol dm \u22123 NaClO 4 [6] . Sondag-Huethorst and Fokkink [4] showed that the replacement of the \u03c9 methyl terminal group by nitrile or chloride causes a positive shift of the maximum by \u22480.7 V. The shift observed in the present results of PDFT SAMs is much greater than those reported previously. The contact angle of 0.1 mol dm \u22123 NaClO 4 on PDFT SAM at E max was 114.7\u00b0, which is slightly lower than the contact angles of water with SAMs of CF 3 (CH 2 ) n SH ( n =9\u201315) [24] , 118\u00b0, and 117\u00b0 for CF 3 (Cf 2 ) 10 (CH 2 ) 2 SH [25] . The shift in the pzc with adsorption from the solution side is related to the change in the surface potential before and after the adsorption [30,31] : (4) E pzc =\u03a6+\u03b4\u03c7 M + \u03b4 \u03c7 S + const , where \u03a6 is the work function of the metal, \u03b4 \u03c7 M (\u03b4 \u03c7 S ) is the change in the surface potential on the metal side (solution side) upon contacting the solution (metal) and const includes the quantities related to the reference electrode. As the difference in HDT, UDT, PT, and PFDT resides only in the alkyl part of the molecules and the surface coverage of all thiols is the same for all thiolates studied, \u03b4 \u03c7 M presumably remains the same for all thiols studied. Then the change in E pzc is ascribed to the change in \u03b4 \u03c7 S , which is mainly determined by the dipole moment of the adsorbed molecules. The variation of E pzc in Table 1 should therefore be related to the difference in the dipole moment of adsorbed alkanethiolates. Evans and Ulman measured the surface potential for a series of alkanethiolate SAMs using the Kelvin probe method and found that the surface potential, \u03c7 , increases linearly with n (6\u2a7d n \u2a7d21) and the variation of \u03c7 with n was 9.3 mV [7] . A tendency to saturation of the \u03c7 values was not observed up to n =21 [7] . Though the present E pzc data for three alkanethiolate SAMs are not sufficient to obtain reliable estimates, the negative shift in E pzc by about 15 mV per n is in harmony with their surface potential measurements. The fact that the difference in E pzc between UDT to ODT is smaller than that between PT and UDT and the finding by Sondag-Huethorst and Fokkink about the insensitiveness of their E max values on n , n =11, 17, 21, may reflect the tendency in the saturation of the surface potential for alkanethiolate SAMs with larger n values. To elucidate this point further, we made ab initio calculations of the dipole moment, \u03bc D , of alkanethiolates adsorbed on the gold atom cluster using the Gaussian 98 code [32] with the LanL2DZ basis set, i.e., the Dunning/Huzinaga full double zeta (DZ) basis set [33] for hydrogen, carbon and fluorine and the Los Alamos effective core potential plus DZ basis for sulfur and gold [34,35] . In the density functional calculation Becke\u2019s three parameter hybrid functional [36] using the Lee and Parr correlation [37] was used. The structures of the thiol-gold clusters were fully relaxed except that the gold positions were fixed and the sulfur atom was located at the hollow site. The relaxed structures and the calculated dipole moments for UDT, PT, and PFDT are shown in Fig. 5 . In the case of alkanethiolates on gold, the alkyl chain takes an all- trans configuration even for PT, which agrees with the recent SFG study of alkanethiolate SAMs on Au(1 1 1) [29] . In contrast, the perfluoroalkyl chain of PFDT exhibits the helical conformation, which is known for perfluorinated hydrocarbons [38\u201340] . The charge on the sulfur atom is negative in all cases calculated and does not depend very much on the type of the alkyl group: \u22120.34, \u22120.36, \u22120.36, and \u22120.39 for ODT, UDT, PT, and PFDT, respectively. The gold cluster is slightly positively charged in all cases: 0.09, 0.08, and 0.11 for ODT, UDT, PT, and PFDT. As the conformation of the alkyl chain part of ODT did not converge, we calculated the dipole moment of the alkanethiolate-gold cluster only for UDT, PT, and PFDT to be 2.22, 1.70, and 3.84 D ( D =3.33564\u00d710 \u221230 C m), respectively ( Fig. 5 ); the dipoles for the UDT and PT are directing their negative end toward the electrode surface, whereas the PFDT directs its positive end toward the electrode surface, owing to the electronegative characters of the fluorine atoms, as has been described by Evans and Ulman in interpreting the surface potential measurements of perfluorinated alkanethiolate SAMs [7] . The nature of the alkyl chain part is thus crucial in determining the dipole moment of the adsorbed alkanethiolates on gold. The relationship between the value of E pzc and the surface normal component of the calculated dipole moment, \u03bc \u22a5 , was found to be linear for UDT, PT, and PFDT. The tilt angle of an isolated alkanethiolate molecule adsorbed on the gold cluster was about 10\u00b0 from the surface normal: 10\u00b0, 14\u00b0, and 12\u00b0 for UDT, PT, and PFDT, respectively, where the tilt angle is defined as the angle that the line connecting S\u2013C 2 \u2013C 4 in the all trans configuration makes with respect to the surface normal. It is known that the tilt angle of the alkyl chain is about 30\u00b0 for long chain alkanethiolates in the SAM on Au(1 1 1) and becomes greater with decreasing n [29] . For precise evaluation of the contribution of these adsorbed thiolates to the surface potential, a more accurate evaluation of the tilt angle, which is determined not only by the nature of the Au\u2013S\u2013C bonding but the intermolecular interactions of adsorbed thiolates and the site of the adsorption, seems to be required [41] . The size of the gold cluster also probably affects the value of the dipole moment. Nevertheless, the difference in the magnitude and the direction of the dipole moment of the thiolate-Au cluster complex explains, at least qualitatively, the shift of E pzc with the alkyl chain length and also the large positive shift in E pzc for the PFDT SAM. 4 Conclusions A new method of measuring the contact angle under the precise control of the potential drop across the droplet|Au(1 1 1) interface has been presented. The combination of a small drop of microliter size and a reference electrode of a glass capillary type enables reproducible contact angle vs. potential curves to be obtained. The negative shift in E pzc of alkanethiolate SAMs on Au(1 1 1) with increasing chain length, and also the large positive shift in E pzc for the perfluorinated alkane SAM, are attributable to the difference in the surface dipole moments of adsorbed thiolate molecules. The proposed method is promising to elucidate further the double layer structure on SAM surfaces.

        "abstract": "The surface composition of the binary self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of 1-tetradecanethiol and 3-mercapto-1-propanol on gold varies with the charged state of the gold substrate because of the difference in the reductive desorption potentials of the two thiol species. This is a direct corollary of the finding by Paik et al. [S. Eu, W.K. Paik, Chem. Lett. 16 (1998) 405\u2013406.] that the adsorption of thiols to a metal surface from the solution phase leads to the accumulation of negative charges on the surface. By controlling the potential of the gold substrate during the formation of a binary SAM, it is possible to change the surface composition. The saturation of the bathing ethanol solution with oxygen and the grounding of the substrate during the formation of the SAM have basically the same effect on the surface composition, as both mitigate the charge-up problem.",

The mean value of serum HGF levels on admission in the 38 patients was 1.69 +/- 0.40 (SEM) ng/ml. In 35 patients, serum HGF levels were found to be positive (> 0.39 ng/ml), with an incidence of 92.1%. In 17 patients, they were > 1.0 ng/ml, which was the cutoff value for fulminant hepatic failure. Serum HGF levels in the patients with severe acute pancreatitis (2.30 +/- 0.61 ng/ml; mean +/- SEM) were significantly higher than those in the patients with mild and moderate acute pancreatitis (0.63 +/- 0.06 ng/ml). Sixteen of seventeen patients whose serum HGF levels were > 1.0 ng/ml were evaluated as severe acute pancreatitis. Serum HGF levels were significantly elevated in the patients with higher Ranson scores, higher APACHE II scores, or higher computed tomography grades. Serum HGF levels in the patients with organ dysfunction (liver, kidney, or lung) were significantly higher than those in the patients without organ dysfunction. Moreover, serum HGF levels on admission in the nonsurvivors (3.17 +/- 1.30 ng/ml) were significantly higher than those in the survivors (1.22 +/- 0.33 ng/ml). The mortality rate of the patients showing serum HGF levels > 2.0 ng/ml on admission was 50%. In the patients with a lethal outcome, the mean serum HGF level remained constantly > 2.50 ng/ml during hospitalization. The serum HGF level reflected the clinical course of the disease rapidly and distinctly. Serum HGF levels increased with complications such as organ failure, infected pancreatic necrosis, and sepsis and decreased with successful intensive and surgical treatments. These results suggest that serum human HGF levels may reflect the severity, organ dysfunction, and prognosis in acute pancreatitis.",

The concentrations of 5-FU in tumor tissues ranged from 6 to 49 ng/g (average +/- SEM 25.0 +/- 4.1 ng/g), while in normal breast tissues and adipose tissues 5-FU was below the detection limit (<3 ng/g). The 5-FU concentration was lower in estrogen-receptor-positive tumors (14.4 +/- 4.5 ng/g) than in estrogen-receptor-negative tumors (31.8 +/- 5.0 ng/g). Typical FAA was observed in the tumor tissues of three patients. In these three cases, AgNORs were aggregated to one large spheroidal figure in more than 39% of tumor cells.

We therefore evaluated the telomerase activity in surgically obtained noncancerous liver tissue from 20 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Two samples of noncancerous liver tissue were obtained from each patient: one from the parenchyma adjacent to the HCC nodules of the resected specimen; the other from the parenchyma distant from the HCC nodules of the remnant liver. Telomerase activity was assayed by a non-radioisotope quantitative system based on \"TRAP-eze.\" Five samples from the noncancerous liver tissue adjacent to the HCC nodules (25.0%) were telomerase-positive; all such cases showed high-grade malignant potential, such as intrahepatic metastasis and/or portal vascular invasion and infiltration of the fibrous capsule in the corresponding HCC nodules, and telomerase positivity showed neither a relationship with the histological activity index scores nor a correlation with liver function. Interestingly, no telomerase activity was detected in any of the 20 samples obtained from the parenchyma of the remnant liver. These results indicate that telomerase in noncancerous liver tissue is associated not with the hepatic condition accompanying HCC, but with the biological characteristics of the tumor itself, and may derive from infiltrating cancer cells. Determination of telomerase status may aid in designing more effective surgical procedures.",

Prophylactic intravenous treatment with S-5920/LY315920Na significantly reduced mortality at 7 days, and strongly abrogated PLA2 activities in both plasma and ascites along with significant reduction of lipase activity, amylase, aspartate aminotransferase, and hemorrhage at 6 h.

We attempted to detect K-ras mutations in DNA from bile collected through percutaneous transhepatic choledochal drainage (PTCD) tubes as a diagnostic\n approach to biliary strictures. Since bile salts induce cell damage, we first investigated the degeneration of cells according\n to bile exposure time using cell lines. High-mol-wt DNA could be extracted from cells exposed to bile for 6 h, but not from\n those exposed for 12 h. However, DNA exposed to bile for up 12 h could be amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\n method. Therefore, K-ras mutations in fresh bile specimens collected from 15 patients through PTCD tubes were examined using PCR with restriction\n enzyme digestion. K-ras mutations were found in five out of five (100%) pancreatic cancers, all of which were negative according to cytodiagnosis\n of the same bile. On the other hand, K-ras mutations were not detected in bile from biliary tract cancers or metastatic neoplasms, except for one bile duct carcinoma\n and one metastatic case. Thus, although K-ras mutation alone is not an absolute marker for cancer, detection of K-ras mutations in fresh bile from PTCD tubes is a useful adjunct for diagnosis of pancreatic carcinomas in cases of biliary tract\n strictures.\n ",

Pancreatic cancer aggressively invades surrounding tissues by penetrating basement membrane barriers. To examine the relation between the biological characteristics of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells and CD44 expression, we studied the function of CD44 in cell proliferation and cell invasion using a Matrigel basement membrane. The proliferation of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells was not affected by anti-CD44 antibody. On the contrary, invasion of the cells was suppressed by anti-CD44 antibody. This result suggests that the CD44 molecule plays an important role in pancreatic cancer cell invasion of the basement membrane.",

Prolonged BDO decreased gastric mucosal\n blood flow (BF) significantly. The BF recovered after the release of BDO in the 1W and 2W groups, but not in the 3W group.\n BDO decreased PGE2 content in gastric mucosa in the 1W, 2W, and 3W groups. PGE2 decreased vascular perfusion pressure of the isolated stomach in the control and 2W groups, but not in the 3W group. The\n response of gastric vessels to PGE2 was poor in the 3W group compared with the control and 2W groups. Decreased PGE2 in the gastric mucosa and decreased response of gastric vessels to PGE2 may affect gastric blood flow in obstructive jaundice.",

Acute pancreatitis was induced by deoxycholate injection into the pancreatic duct in adult mongrel dogs. Fluosol DA or 6% hydroxyethylstarch (HES) solution as control was transfused at 20 ml/kg/hour for the first 3 hours. Fluosol DA and HES solution improved the depressed cardiac output and pancreatic blood flow to normal levels. Compared with HES solution, Fluosol DA administration revealed a prominent increase in oxygen tension in the pancreatic tissue, which had decreased severely from onset of pancreatitis. Fluosol DA administration brought about better preservation of pancreatic mitochondrial functions. Despite no significant differences in blood levels of other pancreatic enzymes between Fluosol DA and HES solution, the sharp decrease in plasma postheparin phospholipase A2 suggested the protection of involved systemic organs including pancreas. Thus, maintaining pancreatic blood flow and increasing the oxygen transport by Fluosol DA administration seemed to play a positive role in inhibiting the progress of pancreatitis, though improvement of survival rate in acute pancreatitis was incomplete by Fluosol DA administration alone.",

An immunohistochemical study of the metastatic tumor revealed immunoreactivity of glucagon and protein kinase C (PKC)-alpha, -beta, and -gamma in the tumor cells, two types of which were seen by electron microscopy. One type had abundant secretory granules and mitochondria, while the other had few granules and mitochondria. Some granules were similar to typical A cell granules and others were atypical. An immunoelectron microscopic demonstration revealed PKC-alpha, -beta, and -gamma immunostaining in the cytoplasm of all the tumor cells, while some secretory granules had PKC immunostaining, and others had no immunostaining. Thus, it appears that metastatic glucagonoma and its associated granules are composed of two types of mature and immature cells or granules. As immunoreactivity of PKC-alpha and -gamma was found in the tumor cells, but not in the normal A cells of the islets of Langerhans, the PKC subspecies alpha and gamma, which are not present in normal pancreatic A cells, may exist in human glucagonoma cells.",

In order to determine whether this observation could be extended to Japanese colorectal cancers, we analyzed the simple repeat sequence of (G)8 in the bax gene of tumor genomes from 15 cases of Japanese hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer that showed microsatellite instability in at least one of four examined microsatellite loci. None of 15 tumor DNA samples had a frameshift mutation in this region of the bax gene. Our results suggest that direct disruption of the bax gene is not a major factor responsible for carcinogenesis in Japanese hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancers even though microsatellite instability is present.",

To evaluate the most effective factor in the invasion, metastasis and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we examined urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, PAI-2 and uPA activity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in HCC tissues obtained from 46 patients. The results were compared with the patients' clinicopathological features and prognoses.Of the clinicopathological features, only histological portal involvement or intrahepatic metastasis, or both (INV), was significantly correlated to the disease-free survival rates (DFS; P < 0.05). The levels of uPA, PAI-1 and PAI-2 antigens were significantly associated with INV and histological grade. The DFS was not different, however, between cases with uPA, PAI-1 and PAI-2 values above and below the median. The high levels of uPA activity were closely related to INV (P < 0.001), and the activity gradually raised histological grades (P < 0.0001). The DFS was significantly different between patients with uPA activity below and above the median (0.70 ng/mL; P = 0.0092); it was also significantly different between such patients without INV (P < 0.05).Urokinase-type plasminogen activator activity may be the most sensitive factor affecting HCC invasion in the plasminogen activation system and a strong predictor for the recurrence of HCC. We suggest that cases with uPA activity of more than 0.70 ng/mL should be carefully followed up for possible HCC recurrence.",

The clinical utility of HGF for the detection of severe pancreatitis and for predicting prognosis, bacterial infection (infected pancreatic necrosis or sepsis), and organ dysfunction (liver, kidney, and lung) during the clinical course of acute pancreatitis was compared with the clinical utility of CRP and IL-6 by analysis of receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. The optimum cutoff levels of HGF for severity, prognosis, infection, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and respiratory dysfunction were 0.9, 1.1, 1.0, 1.1, 1.1, and 1.0 ng/ml, respectively. HGF was as useful as CRP and more useful than IL-6 for detection of severe pancreatitis and for predicting hepatic dysfunction. Moreover, HGF was more useful than CRP or IL-6 for predicting prognosis, renal dysfunction, and respiratory dysfunction. However, for predicting infection, CRP was more useful than HGF. These results suggest that serum HGF levels on admission may be a useful new clinical parameter for determining the prognosis of acute pancreatitis and that HGF may be closely related to the organ dysfunction of acute pancreatitis.",

In this study, plasma HGF levels and HGF tissue distribution were investigated in rats with experimental acute pancreatitis, and the effects of HGF on the cytotoxic activity and apoptosis-inducing activity of PAAF also were examined. Plasma HGF levels were elevated in rats with two experimental pancreatitis models of different grades of severity. The degree of its elevation was correlated with the severity and the organ dysfunctions. In rats with severe pancreatitis, HGF protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels significantly increased in liver, kidney, and lung, which were injured organs. When anti-HGF neutralizing antibody was administered in severe pancreatitis, liver dysfunction worsened, and apoptotic cells increased in kidney. Recombinant HGF inhibited the cytocidal activity of PAAF on MDCK cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, recombinant HGF prevented the apoptotic cell death (DNA fragmentation, nuclear fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation) induced by PAAF. These results suggest that HGF is produced in injured organs and may function as an organotrophic and antiapoptotic factor against the organ injuries in acute pancreatitis.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the significance of peritoneal macrophage in inducing cytotoxicity in ascitic fluid associated with severe acute pancreatitis. The involvement of peritoneal macrophage was examined experimentally in rats by macrophage depletion with peritoneal lavage prior to the development of pancreatitis. More than 94% of the cellular components collected from peritoneal cavities by the lavage are macrophages. Although the ascitic fluid collected from the rats with necrotizing pancreatitis showed cytocidal effects via apoptosis on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, cytotoxicity or apoptosis-inducing activity almost disappeared from the ascitic fluid by the preceding peritoneal lavage. The ascitic fluid did not show significant differences by the lavage in osmolarity and in concentrations of albumin, bilirubin, amylase, and lipase. Although a slight reduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha was noted with the lavage, tumor necrosis factor-alpha failed to induce apoptotic cell death in the cells, and the neutralization by antibody ameliorated neither cell death nor apoptosis. We conclude that peritoneal macrophages secrete apoptosis-inducing factor(s) into pancreatitis-associated ascitic fluid, other than tumor necrosis factor-alpha.",

In the first three patients, who were treated by drip infusion without the use of a volumetric pump, serum FUra concentrations ranged widely, from 27 to 130 ng/ml, even though the rate of administration was re-adjusted four times during the night. The last six patients were treated using a volumetric pump, and FUra concentrations in serum ranged from 175 to 378 ng/ml, and displayed no circadian rhythm.

The antibody reacted strongly with the plasma membrane of human gastrointestinal carcinoma. Sections of the malignant and benign tissues were tested with immunoperoxidase. All of 10 (100%) large intestinal cancers, 26 of 31 (84%) gastric cancers, 5 of 7 (71%) pancreatic cancers and all of 3 (100%) ampullary cancers reacted positively. Moderate or weak reactivity was observed with normal human tissues, hepatoma and carcinomas of mammary, thyroid and adrenal glands. According to a study of the distribution of 125I-labeled KM10 in nude mice bearing human gastric cancer, KM10 selectively localized in tumor tissue rather than normal tissue. Whole body autoradiography also supported such a selective distribution. Destruction of antigenic properties by pronase digestion demonstrated its protein nature and by Western blot analysis, it was identified as a protein with an Mr of 180-200 kd. KM10-adriamycin (ADM) conjugate was prepared via an oxidized dextran bridge and this immunoconjugate retained the binding activity against human gastric cancer. MKN45 cells were inoculated subcutaneously into athymic mice and intravenous treatment was begun when the tumor became measurable. A dose-dependent antitumor activity was observed in vivo with KM10-ADM conjugate, while this conjugate was less toxic than free ADM.",

Chimeric A10 Fab fragment was expressed in Escherichia coli, and produced in large quantities in a mini-jar fermentation system. In competitive binding assays, chimeric MAbs and their Fab fragments showed identical specificity to human CEA epitopes, as compared to the parental MAbs or Fab fragments. Both chimeric Fab fragments exhibited strong immunohistochemical reactivity with various gastrointestinal carcinomas and no reactivity with CEA-related antigens, such as NCA (nonspecific cross-reacting antigen) or BGPI (biliary glycoprotein I). Furthermore, chimeric KM10 MAb elicited substantially higher antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity than the murine MAb. Complement-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro was much weaker with chimeric KM10 MAb. These results indicate that chimeric MAbs or Fab fragments could potentially replace the parental murine antibodies or their Fab fragments in therapy or diagnosis of human gastrointestinal carcinomas.",

Between 1971 and 1993 we treated 227 patients, 59 of whom were treated with simple cholecystectomy and 66 with extended cholecystectomy. The tumors were classified according to the stages proposed by the Japanese Society of Biliary Surgery. For Stage I and II disease extended cholecystectomy had a better result than simple cholecystectomy. For the extended cholecystectomy cases the cumulative 5-year survival rate was 78.9% for Stage I, 63.6% for Stage II, 44.4% for Stage III, and 8.3% for Stage IV. The survival of Stage I patients was excellent. For cases more advanced than Stage II (S3, N2, Hinf1, and Binf1), the prognosis was significantly worse. In these cases more aggressive surgery may be needed.",

To assess the role of PAI-1 in invasion and proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, HLE cells were transfected with a vector capable of expressing an antisense PAI-1 transcript. Analysis of seven stably transfected clones (PAI-1-) showed reductions of 81% in PAI-1 mRNA by northern blot analysis and 63% in the cellular PAI-1 antigen level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There was no change in the levels of secreted PAI-1 or PAI-2. The activity of cellular uPA increased by 54%, without change in the protein level or the secreted uPA activity evaluated by ELISA. Morphologically, PAI-1 antisense induced a spindle shape with narrower cytoplasmic processes in HLE cells. The forced inhibition of PAI-1 increased the invasion and the growth of PAI-1- cells by 75% and 82%, respectively. These results suggest that PAI-1 plays a role in inhibiting invasion and proliferation, and the balance between uPA and PAI-1 expression is important to assess the invasiveness of HCC cells.",

On the other hand, exocrine pancreas is a typical organ to perform regulatory secretion of digestive enzymes, depending upon extracellular signals. We investigated the effects of sphingosine or ceramide on amylase secretion from isolated rat pancreatic acini. Either sphingosine or cell-permeable ceramide inhibits CCK8- or carbachol-induced enzyme secretion from isolated rat pancreatic acini in a dose-dependent manner. Sphingosine or ceramide itself does not affect basal amylase secretion from the acini. Ceramide also inhibits NaF-induced amylase secretion, indicating that it acts post the activation of receptor-linked GTP-binding protein. In our experiments, ceramide inhibited Ca2+ ionophore-induced amylase secretion, but not phorbol ester-induced secretion. These results indicate that ceramide affects secretory processes post intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in the exocrine pancreas.",

The median operation time, hospital stay, and the interval until removal of the tube were significantly shorter with J-tube than with T-tube cases. Bile leakage after surgery occurred in 4 J-tube and 2 T-tube cases with one residual stone in each case.The transcystic decompression tube is easily and safely inserted with the J-kit.

Thus we hypothesized that renal cell injury resulting from apoptosis is involved in renal failure with severe acute pancreatitis.Renal cell apoptosis in kidneys harvested from rats with necrotizing pancreatitis was evaluated by in situ nick-end labeling. Ascitic fluid that had been collected 6 hours after development of pancreatitis was injected into the peritoneal cavities of healthy rats, and renal apoptosis was also evaluated. The apoptosis-inducing activity of the ascitic fluid was estimated in vitro with use of isolated rat renal tubules and the normal rat kidney cell line NRK52E by nuclear staining, cell cycle analysis, and DNA electrophoresis.Apoptosis was detected by in situ nick-end labeling on the renal tubules 6 hours after induction of pancreatitis in vivo. Similar tubular apoptosis was detected in the rats that had intraperitoneal injection of the ascitic fluid. In in vitro analyses the ascitic fluid induced nuclear and DNA fragmentation on the isolated renal tubules and promoted apoptosis on NRK52E cells in a time-dependent manner.Apoptotic cell death of renal tubules occurs in severe acute pancreatitis within several hours and is possibly involved in the mechanism of renal failure through undefined substance(s) in the ascitic fluid associated with pancreatitis.",

        "abstract": "Recombinant mouse-human chimeric Fab fragments of anti-carcinoembryonic antigen monoclonal antibody (MAb) A10 react with various GI carcinomas. We tested radiolocalization of pancreatic carcinoma xenografts in nude mice using radiolabeled chimeric A10 Fab fragments, comparing them with murine Fab fragments and parental MAb. For mice injected with chimeric A10 Fab fragments, we obtained significantly higher uptake in tumors than in normal tissues at 24 and 48 h after injection. In addition, tumor/normal tissues labeling ratios for chimeric A10 Fab fragment were significantly greater than those for murine MAb at 24 h postinfusion. However, no significant difference in biodistribution was observed between chimeric and murine Fab fragments. In autoradiography imaging studies, we obtained clearer tumor detection without visible uptake in normal organs for chimeric Fab fragments than for murine MAb. These results suggest that chimeric Fab fragments of A10 could be a potentially useful candidate for radioimmunodetection of pancreatic carcinomas.",

We hypothesized that hepatocyte apoptosis occurs in severe acute pancreatitis.Induction of apoptosis was evaluated in the liver from rats with necrotizing pancreatitis. Apoptosis-inducing activity of the pancreatitis-associated ascitic fluid on hepatocytes was evaluated in vivo by intraperitoneal injection of the ascitic fluid and in vitro using rat primary hepatocyte culture.Apoptosis was detected in hepatocytes in the rats both with severe acute pancreatitis and with the intraperitoneal injection of the ascitic fluid by in situ nick-end labeling and DNA fragmentation. Apoptotic change and hepatic injury were ameliorated by administration of an interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme inhibitor. The ascitic fluid exhibited cytocidal activity in rat primary hepatocyte culture via apoptosis, which was confirmed by DNA fragmentation, by cell cycle analysis, and by nuclear fragmentation. The neutralizing antibody for transforming growth factor-beta 1 partially blocked the apoptosis induction but the antibody to tumor necrosis factor-alpha had no effect.Apoptotic cell death occurs in hepatocytes in severe acute pancreatitis partially via transforming growth factor-beta 1 in the pancreatitis-associated ascitic fluid.",

        "abstract": "After a lithogenic diet containing 0.5 per cent cholesterol and 0.25 per cent sodium cholate was fed to a group of normal Crj-ICR male mice for 10 days, cholesterol gallstones developed. No formation of gallstones occurred, however, in a group of mice from which 20 cms of terminal ileum had been removed prior to the feeding of the lithogenic diet. The biliary concentrations of cholesterol, phospholipids and bile acids were markedly lower in the ileectomized mice, with the decrease in cholesterol concentration being most significant. On the other hand, fecal excretion of sterols and bile acids increased in the ileectomized mice. The pool size of bile acids increased after the feeding of the lithogenic diet, but ileectomy decreased the pool size in mice fed the ordinary or lithogenic diets. The biliary concentration of cholic acid increased after the feeding of the lithogenic diet, but decreased with ileectomy. The biliary concentration and fecal excretion of deoxycholic acid markedly increased, while those of beta-muricholic acid and its secondary bile acids, omega-muricholic acid and hyodeoxycholic acid, decreased. The increase in plasma and liver cholesterol levels after the feeding of the lithogenic diet was prevented by ileectomy. These data suggest that ileectomy prevents the formation of cholesterol gallstones after the feeding of a lithogenic diet due to a decrease in cholic acid absorption.",

        "abstract": "Hepatic dysfunction is one of the critical complications in acute pancreatitis but this mechanism is poorly understood. In patients with acute pancreatitis, hypoalbuminemia is often recognized, suggesting possible disturbance of hepatic transport of proteins and hepatic metabolites. The present study was undertaken to elucidate hepatic function in cerulein-induced pancreatitis from the viewpoint of intrahepatic vesicular transport. We examined the biliary excretion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), whose pathway in the hepatocyte has been shown to be microtubule dependent. In vivo studies and ex vivo studies using isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL) showed that cumulative excretion of LPS in each period was significantly reduced, by 49 and 25%, respectively, compared with that in control rats. But studies of biliary secretion in vivo and ex vivo studies indicated statistical insignificance between the two groups. Moreover, biliary excretion of LPS was inhibited to 60% of the control by colchicine pretreatment, without affecting bile flow in IPRL, but gadolinium chloride had no effect. We conclude that transport of LPS across the hepatocyte from blood to bile is impaired in rats with cerulein-induced pancreatitis without being affected by Kupffer cell function. These results suggest that a disturbance of vesicular transport in hepatocyte may also occur in exocytosis and endocytosis via the sinusoidal membrane, cause impairment of hepatic transport of proteins and hepatic metabolites, and result in hepatic dysfunction in acute pancreatitis.",

We examined telomerase activity in 29 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by a polymerase chain reaction-based semiquantitative assay. Of 24 HCCs, telomerase activity was positive in 23 (95.8%), of which 16 showed strong activity. In 11 well differentiated HCCs, telomerase activity was strong in 5, weak in 5, and undetected in 1 and in 13 moderately differentiated HCCs, it was strong in 11 and weak in 2. Five of 6 HCCs less than 2 cm in diameter expressed strong telomerase activity, while weak telomerase activity was detected in 7 of 19 (36.8%) resected noncancerous liver tissues from the HCC patients. Five of these 7 patients (71%) manifested recurrence within 6 months after surgery. The recurrence rate in these patients whose noncancerous liver tissue was positive for telomerase activity was significantly higher than that in patients in whom it was negative (P = 0.017). These results suggest that the presence of telomerase activity may be a useful diagnostic marker of HCC, regardless of tumor size, and that its detection in resected noncancerous liver tissues may serve as a useful predictor of postoperative recurrence.",

In order to improve the likelihood of safe and curative surgery of esophageal cancer, we investigated the clinicopathological characteristics of synchronous esophageal and gastric cancer.Among 288 patients with primary esophageal cancer who had undergone esophageal resection, this cancer was associated with gastric cancer in 11 cases, and 1,416 gastric cancer patients operated on during the same period, were analyzed. The clinicopathological characteristics and surgical procedures of the 11 patients were compared with those of the other esophageal cancer patients and with those with the gastric cancer only.There were significant differences between the synchronous double cancer and the gastric cancer only in sex (P < 0.01) and location of the gastric cancer (P < 0.05). All of the patients with the synchronous double cancer were men, and the incidence of patients with cardiac cancer was high.Our findings suggest that, in cases of synchronous esophageal and gastric cancer, an adequate surgical procedure must be chosen in terms of the stage, location, and operative burden.",

        "abstract": "To diagnose early gallbladder carcinoma is difficult but essential to improve the survival of the patients with this cancer. Fifty-three early gallbladder cancers were macroscopically divided into protruding and flat types. The diagnostic devises [ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), and drip infusion cholangiography (DIC)] were compared for their ability of early detection. The specimens were examined cytologically for diagnosis during operation and the p53 protein was investigated. Thirty-three cases were of the protruding type, eighteen of the flat type, and two unclassified. Carcinoma tended to be missed when gallstones were present. Preoperative diagnosis of the flat type was difficult. Tumor location did not always correlate with the preoperative diagnosis. Of the misdiagnosed cases of the protruding type, half were missed with US and CT and were not visualized clearly by DIC. Among the flat type cancers, only three had no abnormal findings by diagnostic imaging. Cytologic examination was effective, and p53 was expressed only in early carcinoma, not in adenoma or dysplasia. Even in the presence of gallstones or cholecystitis, any abnormal findings should make one suspicious of gallbladder cancer. Cytology and p53 expression may be useful for the intraoperative diagnosis, and a combination of diagnostic methods is important.",

Diagnosis with ultrasonography and computed tomography has become increasingly important as the methods used for first detecting a pancreatic lesion. Tumor resection was performed in 36% of the patients, and the 5-year survival rate of the patients who received resection was 18.2%. The rate of resection and results of surgical treatment have improved, which may be attributed to the increase in detection of resectable tumor and benefits of aggressive and extended surgery.",

PAAF reduced viability of MDCK cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We detected DNA fragmentation on the PAAF-treated MDCK cells, indicating that the cytocidal action of PAAF is via apoptosis. From the results obtained, we conclude that PAAF contains factor(s) inducing apoptosis on MDCK cells, and we assume that apoptotic cell death is involved in the mechanism of organ failure in acute pancreatitis.",

        "abstract": "Recombinant mouse/human chimeric monoclonal antibody A10 (ch-A10) and its Fab fragment (ch-Fab) react with carcinoembryonic antigen on various gastrointestinal carcinomas. We performed biodistribution studies with 125I-labeled ch-A10 and ch-Fab in an antigen-positive human pancreatic carcinoma (BxPC-3) xenograft model. We also evaluated the anti-tumor effect of 131I-labeled ch-A10, and studied the detection of BxPC-3 xenografts with 123I-labeled ch-Fab in whole body scintigraphy. In comparative biodistribution studies, the tumor uptake of 125I-labeled ch-A10 was significantly greater than that of 125I-labeled ch-Fab 24 h post-injection. However, the tumor-to-blood ratio was 46.8 for ch-Fab at 24 h post-injection, while it was only 1.4 for ch-A10. Microautoradiography studies showed that ch-Fab penetrated more uniformly into the tumor nodules than did ch-A10. In mice given a therapeutic dose of 131I-labeled ch-A10, a significant inhibition of tumor growth was seen, while control 131-I-labeled human IgG did not affect tumor growth. Leukocyte toxicity was observed within 3 weeks after injection of 131I-labeled ch-A10, but leukocyte counts recovered to normal levels at 8 weeks post-injection. In whole-body scintigraphy, clear and rapid tumor imaging was obtained with 200 microCi of 123I-labeled ch-Fab 24 h post-injection. These results suggest that radioiodine-labeled chimeric A10 antibodies could potentially be useful candidates for radioimmunotherapy and radioimmunodetection of pancreatic carcinomas.",

        "abstract": "Effects of colchicine, a microtubule-disrupting agent, on rate exocrine pancreas were examined in comparison with the microtubule stabilizer Taxol for the purpose of analyzing the pathogenesis of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. Taxol ameliorated the inhibition of pancreatic secretion, elevation of serum amylase level, pancreatic edema, and histological alterations induced by supramaximal cerulein stimulation. In contrast, colchicine by itself and colchicine followed by cerulein stimulation (maximal and supramaximal) inhibited pancreatic secretion but did not induce the hyperamylasemia, pancreatic edema, or formation of large vacuoles, which characterized cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Electron microscopic studies in the colchicine-treated rats revealed that transport vesicles were accumulated in the supranuclear region and that no large vacuoles were observed in the apical lesion. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed that colchicine inhibited pancreatic secretion and disrupted the arrangement of microtubules. Posttreatment of colchicine did not prevent the development of cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Vinblastine, another microtubule-disrupting drug, as well as colchicine, inhibited pancreatic secretion but did not induce acute pancreatitis. The results obtained in this study suggest that microtubule disorganization at a specific step in the process of intracellular vesicular transport causes cerulein-induced pancreatitis and that this step is more apical than that at which colchicine inhibits secretion in the pancreatic acinar cell.",

We demonstrated the expression of CD44 in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells and normal cells by using flow cytometry (FACS-can) and immunohistological staining. CD44 was highly expressed in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells, while it was little expressed in normal human pancreas cells.

To determine when point mutations appear in the oncogenic\n stage, paraffin-embedded tissues of pancreatic cancer, hyperplastic ductal lesions in pancreatic cancer and in chronic pancreatitis\n were used. DNA extracted from the paraffin-embedded tissues classified as cancer, atypical and nonatypical hyperplasia of\n the pancreatic duct epithelium, and normal tissue from pancreatic cancer patients and those classified as atypical hyperplasia\n of the pancreatic duct epithelium and normal tissue from chronic pancreatitis patients were amplified by the polymerase chain\n reaction (PCR) method. Point mutations were detected in 8 of 17 cancer cases (47.0%). In 5 of 8 point mutation positive cases,\n atypical hyperplasias were found in the surrounding tissues. In all 5 of these atypical hyperplasia, point mutations, that\n is, GGT-GTT (Gly-Val) and GGT-GAT (Gly-Asp), were detected. The same transitions were observed in the cancer of these 5 cases.\n These results suggest a strong relationship between cancer and atypical hyperplasia surrounding cancer. Although atypical\n hyperplasia around cancer was histologically very similar to that found in chronic pancreatitis, all 5 atypical and 5 nonatypical\n hyperplasias in chronic pancreatitis were negative forras point mutation. Thus, the result argues against an association between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.\n ",

Recombinant mouse/human chimeric Fab of the anticarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monoclonal antibody A10, which has been shown to react specifically with gastrointestinal cancers, was used in this study. Fab homo-oligomers (dimers and trimers) were prepared by linkage of chimeric Fab with N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionate. Oligomers with S-S bonds showed 10-fold higher binding activity against human CEA than Fab, while the binding activity of oligomers was similar to that of F(ab')2. In mice bearing pancreatic-carcinoma xenografts, tumor uptake of S-S oligomers was significantly greater than that of monomeric Fab, while there was no difference in tumor uptake between S-S Fab trimers and F(ab')2. S-S oligomers showed more rapid clearance rates and uniform percolation in the tumor nodules than F(ab')2. At 18 hr after injection, clear scintigraphic detection of the pancreatic-carcinoma tumors was obtained with 123I-labeled S-S Fab dimers. At 24hr, improved tumor imaging was shown for 123I-labeled S-S Fab oligomers with slightly visible uptake in normal tissues, similar to that of F(ab')2. S-S oligomers of chimeric A10 Fab may be useful as rapid diagnostic tools of pancreatic carcinomas.",

        "abstract": "We reported here on a case of limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc) with aplastic anemia treated by anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporin A. The use of this therapy resulted not only in marrow recovery but also in resolution of the skin sclerosis. A 68 year-old woman was diagnosed as lcSSc accompanied by Hashimoto's thyroiditis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Treatment by D-penicillamine was started. After 11 months, She complained of nasal bleeding and subcutaneous bleeding. Her laboratory data revealed pancytopenia. White blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration and platelet count were decreased at 2300/microl, 8.2 g/dl, and 3000/microl respectively. Bone marrow was severely hypoplastic, suggesting aplastic anemia. The etiology of hypopastic marrow was considered to be D-penicillamine which had been frequently reported to cause hematopoietic cell suppression. We immediately started methylprednisolone pulse therapy combined with G-CSF and cyclosporin A, which showed little effectiveness. Next we tried the anti-thymocyte globulin therapy combined with G-CSF and cyclosporin A. Her blood cell counts gradually improved. After 4 months, she did not need the blood transfusion anymore. Furthermore, the sclerosis of her skin began to improve gradually, and the titer of anti-centromere antibody also decreased. Thus, anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporin A combined therapy can be considered among the therapies of systemic sclerosis.",

        "abstract": "High molecular weight (HMW)-adiponectin has been found to be a better negative regulator of insulin resistance than total adiponectin. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of HMW-adiponectin on antiretroviral therapy (ART)-induced dyslipidemia in Japanese human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. We also examined the effect of some antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) on adipocytes in vitro.Fifty-seven HIV-infected patients were enrolled in four clinical groups; (I) patients who started ART containing efavirenz (EFV); (II) patients who started ART containing a protease inhibitor without atazanavir (ATV); (III) patients who started ART containing ATV; (IV) patients who switched from ART without ATV into ART containing ATV. We measured the serum HMW-adiponectin before and one year after starting or changing ART, using an enzyme-linked immunoSorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, we treated the mouse adipocytes (3T3-L1) with some ARVs. The lipid content was assessed using Oil Red O staining. The expression of adiponectin was measured by quantitative real-time PCR.The serum HMW-adiponectin decreased significantly in groups (I) and (II) after starting ART, and increased significantly in group (IV) after changing from ART without ATV to ART with ART. EFV, ritonavir (RTV) and nelfinavir (NFV) inhibited the expression of adiponectin mRNA in mature 3T3-L1 and to a greater extent in pre-mature 3T3-L1. This phenomenon was reversible when ARV was changed to ATV.Effects of the ARVs on adiponectin may vary depending on the administration of different drugs. These data suggest that the distinct metabolic effects of ARV could therefore be a consequence of their differential effects on the production of adiponectin.",

        "abstract": "Current therapeutic strategies against rheumatoid arthritis (RA) employ increasingly aggressive regimens from an early stage of the disease ; thus, serological markers more specific than IgM-rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF) are desirable. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody has been reported as a useful and highly specificity marker for the diagnosis of RA. To clarify the diagnostic utility of anti-CCP antibody in early RA, we measured serum concentrations of anti-CCP antibody, IgM-RF, anti-agalactosyl IgG antibody and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 in 184 polyarthritis patients who showed onset symptoms within the previous 2 years. The diagnostic sensitivity of anti-CCP antibody in early RA was 60.0%, equivalent to IgM-RF (66.3%) and anti-agalactosyl IgG antibody (66.0%). Specificity, positive predictive values and diagnostic accuracy of anti-CCP antibody were the best among the four tested makers. In 38 patients who initially did not meet the ACR criteria for RA, but were diagnosed with RA during the course, the diagnostic sensitivity of anti-CCP antibody was 55.3%. On the other hand, the disease activity score (DAS) 28 of anti-CCP antibody positive and the negative patients was 5.16 and 5.34, respectively. Our data indicated that determination of anti-CCP antibody was useful for early diagnosis of RA.",

        "abstract": "The patient was a woman of forty-eight. Liver dysfunction was pointed out at the age of forty-five. She was admitted to hospital because of her hyperthyroidism. Her palmar skin was wet and her fingers were swollen like sausages. She had a diffuse and elastic hard goiter with a rough surface. The serum levels of free T3 (9.6 pg/mL) and free T4 (3.76 ng/dL) were high and that of TSH (0.11 microU/mL) was low. The activity of TSH-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII) was 89%. The uptake rate of 123I to the thyroid was 55.1% and the uptake pattern was nearly diffuse. The goiter was proved to contain several nodules by ultrasonography, but aspiration cytology showed no malignant cells. She was diagnosed to have Graves' disease with adenomatous goiter. She also had high ALT (34 IU/L) and gamma-globulin (1.97 g/dL). She had positive antinuclear antibody (speckled type), positive anti-ribosomal nuclear protein antibody, and positive LE cell phenomenon. The liver biopsy revealed mononuclear cell infiltration with fibrosis in the portal area. These data indicated that she also had autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). The analysis of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) showed positive A11 which had been reported to relate to Graves' disease, and positive DR4 which had been reported to relate to AIH and MCTD. These results suggested that HLA would determine susceptibility to three distinct autoimmune diseases in this case.",

RCAS1 (a receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells) is also an apoptosis-associated protein that induces apoptosis in receptor positive-cells including T cells, and NK cells. To investigate the role of RCAS1 in HIV-1 infection, we stimulated CD4(+) T cells, monocytes, and several cell lines by HIV-Tat protein and thus showed that Tat significantly increased the mRNA transcription levels and the secretion of soluble RCAS1 in CD4(+) T cells and monocytes. We also showed that the apoptosis induced by HIV-Tat was blocked by inhibiting the expression of RCAS1, using small interfering RNA (siRNA), which was specific for RCAS1. These results indicate that RCAS1 is one of the mechanisms of CD4(+) T cell depletion induced by HIV infection.",

We, herein, report two cases with RA that showed a prolonged remission after the discontinuation of etanercept. The two cases were 27 and 38 years of age, and their disease durations were 6 and 14 months, respectively. Their disease activity score 28 (DAS28) before treatment were 4.43 and 5.07, respectively. Case two was resistant to infliximab as determined by previous treatment with this therapy. Both cases showed a dramatic clinical response and discontinued etanercept in the 15th month and the 14th month after the start of treatment, respectively. No exacerbation of arthritis was evident after the discontinuation of etanercept as supported by the maintenance of DAS28 at less than 2.6. Moreover, after the discontinuation of etanercept, radiographic progression was not evident and decreased modified Sharp scores were observed for at least 1 year in both cases. These findings indicate that clinical and radiographic remission is possible in some patients with RA after the discontinuation of etanercept.",

We measured HIV-1 DNA levels in CD4(+) lymphocytes in such patients to investigate their clinical significance.CD4(+) T lymphocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood of 61 patients with a VL maintained at less than 50 copies/ml for at least 4 months by ART and total DNA was purified.

For statistical analysis, the Spearman rank or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used, with a significance level of 5%.CD4 cell counts at the time of sampling negatively correlated with the relative amount of HIV-1 DNA (median = 33 copies/million CD4(+) lymphocytes; interquartile range [IQR] = 7-123 copies/million CD4(+) lymphocytes), but were not correlated with the absolute amounts (median = 17 copies/ml; IQR = 5-67 copies/ml). Both absolute and relative amounts of HIV-1 DNA were significantly lower in six patients in whom ART was initiated before positive seroconversion than in 55 patients in whom ART was initiated in the chronic phase, as shown by Western blotting. CD4 cell counts before ART introduction were also negatively correlated with both the relative and absolute amounts of HIV-1 DNA. Only the relative amounts of HIV-1 DNA negatively correlated with the duration of VL maintenance below the detection limit, while the absolute amounts were not significantly correlated with this period.The amounts of cellular HIV-1 DNA in patients with VLs maintained below the detection limit by the introduction of ART correlated with the timing of ART initiation but not with the duration of ART. In addition, CD4(+) T lymphocytes, which were newly generated by ART, diluted latently infected cells, indicating that measurements of the relative amounts of cellular HIV-1 DNA might be underestimated.",

Five patients with RP were analyzed. They consisted of 4 males and 1 female, with ages of onset ranging from 27 to 75. Duration from onset to diagnosis varied from 10 months to 5 years. All 5 patients had auricular chondritis and arthritis. Laringotracheal involvement was detected in 4 patients, scleritis in 2 patients, nasal chondritis, and costal chondritis in one patient. One patient was diagnosed to have MAGIC syndrome, complicated with oral and genital ulcers. Antibodies to type II collagen were detected in 4 patients, and the antibody titer correlated with the level of C-reactive protein. Corticosteroids were given to 5 patients. After treatment, the symptoms improved in 5 patients, but 3 patients had a recurrence as reducing corticosteroids. One of them received steroid pulse therapy, one received immunosuppressive drugs, and one patient received both treatments. To prevent an impairment of organs, an early diagnosis involving the use of antibodies to type II collagen and steroid therapy are important in this disease.",

        "abstract": "Abstract We investigated human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-associated sicca syndrome. The average saliva production in HIV-infected patients was 15.9 \u00b1 6.3\u2009ml, and the average tear production was 9.8 \u00b1 4.5\u2009mm. In particular, 6 patients (42.9%) showed a significant decrease in tear production. This sicca syndrome mimicked autoimmune Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (SS) because of the presence of dry eye, dry mouth, hyperamylasemia, and hypergammaglobulinemia; however, no antinuclear antibodies, anti-SS-A, or anti-SS-B were detected in sera from HIV-1-infected patients. In addition, no relationship was observed between saliva and tear production and CD4, HIV-RNA. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human T-lymphotrophic virus (HTLV-1) are considered to be possible causative agents of SS. However, coinfection with HCV did not affect the decrease of saliva and tear production, and only one patient was coinfected with HTLV-1. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) are also potential causative agents of SS, and they are sometimes detected in the saliva of HIV-1-infected patients. However, the detection of EBV and CMV in the saliva was not related to the decrease in saliva production. Furthermore, HIV therapy (highly active anti-retroviral therapy; HAART) did not affect the state of sicca syndrome. The pathogenesis of sicca syndrome in HIV-1-infected patients is not clear, but we did find some infiltration of CD8 lymphocytes in salivary gland biopsy. Usually, CD8 lymphocytosis is found in peripheral blood in HIV-infected patients. Diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome by predominant CD8 lymphocytes is occasionally found in HIV-infected patients. Such CD8 infiltration may induce the destruction of both the salivary and lacrimal glands.",

Although treated with prednisolone and oral cyclophosphamide, he suffered repeated remission and deterioration of his conditon, which was complicated by hypertrophic pachymeningitis and sinusitis. In July 2006, he was diagnosed with an exacerbation of ANCA-associated vasculitis because of pyrexia, general malaise, numbness in his face and legs, and elevated serum CRP level. Steroid pulse therapy was thus initiated and the patient's clinical symptoms improved. However, serum CRP levels elevated again (5.18 mg/dl) in September 2006. We began administration of rituximab (500 mg/bodyx4 times) in November 2006 and his symptom and laboratory data significantly improved. The dose of prednisolone was slowly decreased without suffering a relapse. Rituximab has been administered every one year, and good disease control has been achieved. Diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis was made from the findings of a nodular lesion in the left lung. Rituximab should be considered for patients with refractory ANCA-associated vasculitis.",

        "abstract": "Antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection is associated with lipodystrophy. However, raltegravir (RAL), a new integrase inhibitor, and atazanavir (ATV), a new generation of protease inhibitor (PI), have not been reported to significantly induce metabolic abnormalities in some clinical studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence and molecular mechanisms of RAL and compared it with the other three classes of ARVs (nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors; NRTI, nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor; NNRTI, and PI) on adipogenesis using 3T3-L1 cells. RAL and ATV had minimal effects on the lipid metabolism of 3T3-L1 cells. NRTI induced a moderate change, and NNRTI and some PIs induced a severe reduction in cell lipid content. These ARVs induced a decrease in the expression of genes associated with lipogenic transcription factors (sterol regulatory-element-binding protein-1c, CAAT box enhancer-binding protein-\u03b1, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3). The differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were less sensitive to ARV-induced metabolic disturbance than were predifferentiated cells. RAL and ATV did not significantly affect the lipid metabolism in our in vitro study. The other ARVs had a direct influence on adipocytes. Degree and underlying mechanisms of metabolic disturbance differed among different ARVs. These data suggest that the distinct metabolic side-effect profiles of ARVs are a consequences of their differential effects on the adipocyte physiology. A better understanding of the mechanism of ARV-induced metabolic abnormalities could lead to safer use of ARVs or selection of alternative agents for further clinical development.",

        "abstract": "We herein report the successful use of rituximab in a 55-year-old woman with refractory PR3-ANCA-associated Wegener's granulomatosis. She responded to treatments with high dose methylprednisolone (mPSL), oral and intravenous cyclophosphamide, intravenous gammaglobulin, immunoabsorption, oral prednisolone (PSL), and oral ciclosporin, although she frequently relapsed with various symptoms, such as perforation of the small intestine, scleritis, orbital granuloma, complete AV block, multiple lung nodules, cerebellar infarction, and pharyngeal granuloma with a high level of PR3-ANCA. During her latest relapse, she was given high dose mPSL and 2 infusions of 600 mg (375 mg/m(2)) of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab with an interval of 4 weeks, followed by a tapering of the administered PSL. The patient's PR3-ANCA levels normalized within 2 months, but at 6 months after the beginning of the administration of rituximab, the PR3-ANCA level gradually increased without any clinical symptoms. Therefore, two more infusions of rituximab were again administered and thereafter the PR3-ANCA level finally normalized. At present, at 14 months after the initial rituximab treatment, the patient's remission continues to be maintained. The successful treatment of this patient by rituximab therefore suggests that it is an effective and new therapeutic approach for the treatment of refractory Wegener's granulomatosis.",

We investigated the presence of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and systemic sclerosis (SSc), using flow cytometry. The percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells was significantly decreased in RA, especially in patients with high serum levels of either CRP or MMP-3. In SSc and SLE, the percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells was higher in patients than in controls, but not significant. We also investigated the serum levels of IL-10, which influences the function of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells and other regulatory T cells. In RA, on contrast to CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells, the serum levels of IL-10 increased in patients with higher serum levels of CRP, or MMP-3. In SLE and SSc, the serum level of IL-10 increased significantly in patients than in controls. These data thus indicated that CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells contributes to occurrence and progression of RA, and other regulatory T cells or cytokines contribute to occurrence and progression of SSc and SLE.",

        "abstract": "A 62-year-old male was admitted to a local hospital due to a clouding of consciousness in October 2006. On admission, his renal function was observed to have severely deteriorated, which is thought to cause disturbance of consciousness. Laboratory data showed blood urea nitrogen to be 160 mg/dl and the serum creatinine level was 25 mg/dl and, as a result, continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) was started. Although his general condition improved, his renal function did not recover. Therefore, regular hemodialysis was started in December 2006. The cause of renal dysfunction was uncertain, because MPO-ANCA was negative, and a renal biopsy could not be done due to the lack of a clear corticomedullary border in his kidneys. In January 2008, he was diagnosed to have microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) because of hemoptysis, elevated serum CRP levels and a positive finding for MPO-ANCA (408.0 EU). An alveolar hemorrhage was also ascertained in a broncoscopic examination. Steroid pulse therapy and intravenous pulse therapy of cyclophosphamide were thus started. The patient's clinical symptoms thereafter significantly improved and his MPO-ANCA level became normalized. This is a rare case characterized by a late appearance of MPO-ANCA, which occurred after more than one year after the onset of renal failure in MPA.",

A 33-year-old woman, who had been suffering from photosensitivity, proteinuria, and pancytopenia, was diagnosed to have SLE. She showed normochromatic normocytic anemia. The serum level of haptoglobin was <10 mg/dl, and Direct Coombs' test was negative. Her reticulocyte count was 0.8%. Her clinical and laboratory features, except for anemia, had recovered in response to 50 mg/day of prednisolone. The serum level of haptoglobin had normalized, but the reticulocyte count remained low. The bone marrow findings revealed erythroid hypoplasia, and she was diagnosed to have PRCA complicated with SLE. No viral DNA of human parvovirus B19 in her bone marrow was detected. The anemia gradually improved following the further use of 50 mg/day prednisolone. In order to disclose the mechanism of PRCA in this patient, we examined the effects of her peripheral T lymphocytes on erythrogenesis, using erythroid colony-forming cells (ECFC) in her peripheral blood. When we co-cultured peripheral T cells and ECFC, her T cells inhibited erythroid colony formation in a dose dependent manner. Several reports have shown the presence of inhibitory factors in SLE patients' serum such as antibodies against erythroid progenitors or erythropoietin, while other reports have shown abnormal T cells that inhibit the growth of erythroid progenitors. Our study suggests that these inhibitory T cells may therefore have played an important role in the pathogenesis of this patient.",

He was diagnosed with polyarteritis nodosa due to the cutaneous ulcer, mononeuritis multiplex, muscular pain, elevated serum CRP level and from histological findings of a skin biopsy. He was initially treated with 60 mg/day of prednisolone, followed by 1000 mg/day of intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVCY) therapy. In June, skin grafting to the cutaneous ulcer was carried out, although the graft did not survive. He revealed therapy-resistance to high dose corticosteroid and IVCY therapy, and so was treated with intravenous high dose immunoglobulin therapy. Serum CRP level then decreased and in October skin grafting was once again undertaken, this time the graft successfully survived. In December, serum CRP level increased again and cutaneous ulcer relapsed, thus he was treated with leukocyte apheresis therapy, although it was ineffective. In February 2007, he subsequently received rituximab (375 mg/m(2)/week x 3). Then, serum CRP level decreased rapidly, and cutaneous ulcer also improved. Recently the efficacy of rituximab against rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis/dermatomyositis and ANCA-associated vasculitis has been recognized. This case suggests that rituximab is also effective against corticosteroid-resistant polyarteritis nodosa.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) is known to be reactivated in immunocompromised situations and it is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and some hematological diseases. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of HHV-8 on HIV-1 infection, especially on thrombocytopenia complicated with HIV infection. The HHV-8 DNA load was determined by a quantitative real-time PCR, using leukocytes from 125 HIV-1-infected individuals. HHV-8 DNA was detected in 37 individuals. The increased HIV-1 load and reduced percentage of CD4-positive T cells were significantly associated with the presence of HHV-8. The prevalence and load for HHV-8 are higher in patients with KS than in patients without KS, but the difference is not significant. The increased HHV-8 DNA load was significantly correlated with thrombocytopenia, and platelet counts were significantly lower in individuals with HHV-8 than in individuals without HHV-8. We also obtained the negative correlations between changes in platelet counts and changes in HHV-8 DNA loads. The association between thrombocytopenia and HHV-8 has never been reported previously, apart from some case reports of Castleman's disease and KS. Various cytokines or chemokines are produced by HHV-8-infected cells, some of which have been reported to inhibit hematopoiesis. This may be one of the mechanisms by which HHV-8 infection induces thrombocytopenia. These results indicate that HHV-8 DNA in leukocytes may provide useful information for the assessment of the clinical appearance of HIV-1 infection.",

        "abstract": "Telomere length (TL) is a marker of cellular and biological aging. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been reported to be associated with short TLs, which suggests that accelerated biological aging occurs in some cellular compartments of HIV+ individuals. In this study, we measured the TLs of peripheral leukocytes of HIV+ and healthy individuals and examined the biological and environmental correlates of TL. We also investigated the influence of TL on leukoaraiosis, an indicator of cerebral small vessel disease, in HIV+ individuals. Three hundred and twenty-five HIV+ individuals who received stable combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for >1 year and achieved viral loads of <40 RNA copies/mL were enrolled along with 147 healthy individuals. Relative TLs of leukocytes were estimated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Leukoaraiosis was assessed in 184 HIV+ individuals by fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging. We analyzed several covariates, including markers of HIV infection, cART, and social/environmental factors; variables associated with TL length in univariate analyses were incorporated into multivariate models. The TLs of peripheral leukocytes of HIV+ individuals were significantly shorter than those of healthy individuals, and the rate of LT length decline with increasing age was greater. Linear regression analysis showed that in HIV+ individuals, increasing age, cART without integrase-stand transfer inhibitors (INSTI), failure to achieve viral loads of <40 copies/mL within 1 year of initiating cART, and substance use were significantly associated with shorter TLs, even after adjustment for the effects of age. Logistic regression analysis indicated an increasing risk of leukoaraiosis was associated with older age, shorter TLs, hypertension, and carotid artery plaque. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that older age and shorter TLs were significant risk factors for leukoaraiosis. In summary, our data showed that TL shortening in HIV+ individuals was independently associated with leukoaraiosis, and was associated with age, control of viral loads, use of INSTI, and substance use. Our results suggest that effective viral control and less toxic cART can help reduce TL shortening and improve outcomes among HIV+ individuals.",

She was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) as a result of a discoid rash, photosensitivity, lymphocytopenia, elevated serum anti ds-DNA antibody and a positive test for antinuclear antibody. Her laboratory data revealed severe liver dysfunction, suggesting autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). She was also diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytic purpura (TTP) because of thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, renal dysfunction and decreased ADAM-TS13 activity. The patient was treated by methylprednisolone pulse therapy, fresh frozen plasma infusion and ursodeoxycholic acid. Her symptoms and laboratory data rapidly improved and a liver biopsy was carried out. Interface hepatitis and lymphocyte infiltration were observed in the specimen. A diagnosis of definite AIH was made from her International AIH group score of 20 points. AIH and TTP are rare complications of SLE. The prevalence of the complication of SLE and AIH has been reported as 1.7 approximately 2.7%, and that of SLE and TTP as 1 approximately 4%.

        "abstract": "Peumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is one of the common opportunistic infections with severe respiratory failure, and is sometimes life-threatening in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Although treatment for PCP is established, an appropriate treatment period has not been evaluated to clarify the risk factors for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) associated with PCP.We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of risk factor, which are the treatment period for PCP, and 67Ga scintigraphy (Ga-S) at the 21st day from the start of the treatment for PCP, with 21 cases of PCP and HIV infection treated during 2005-2012 at Kyushu Medical Center.The rate of residual uptake by Ga-S was assessed in 17 cases (81%). Four cases were diagnosed as being PCP-IRIS, and residual uptake by Ga-S was detected in all PCP-IRIS cases. The durations of the therapy were classified into three groups: 21 days, 28 days, and 35 days. All PCP-IRIS cases were treated in the period of 28 days. In contrast, in 11 cases that showed residual uptake by Ga-S, and were treated for PCP in 35 days, PCP-IRIS did not occur. Additionally, there were 4 cases in which residual uptake by Ga-S did not occur. They were treated with PCP for only 21 days, but did not show PCP-IRIS.In this study, we showed that Ga-S is useful to evaluate the therapeutic effect. Furthermore, we found that the occurrence of PCP-IRIS could be prevented with the early start of cART after 21 days treatment for PCP, when residual uptake by Ga-S after the first treatment for PCP was not detected. It may also be possible to start cART in the early phase after its treatment without the occurrence of PCP-IRIS with the appropriate additional treatment of PCP for 14 days. These guidelines for treatment of PCP in HIV-infected adults and adolescents have been recommended for the duration of 21 days since 1984. We propose that for the prevention of PCP-IRIS, it is nessecory to reconsider recommendation for the treatment duration of 21 days, and meanwhile to evaluate the treatment effect of PCP with Ga-S, because PCP resistance to sulfa drugs, namely are trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, is beginning to appear.",

        "abstract": "The CCR5 antagonist, maraviroc (MVC), is associated with an enhanced CD4+ T-cell response independent of virological suppression; however, its mechanism of action has not been elucidated. In this study, we confirmed the effect of MVC on CD4+ T-cell count recovery in immunological non-responders, and compared the conventional combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with MVC-intensified cART. We also investigated the effect of MVC on interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) production in CD4+ T cells in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, and evaluated the relationship between the mRNA level of IFN-\u03b3 and the degree of CD4+ T-cell count recovery. In\u00a0vitro analysis indicated that MVC significantly decreased mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b3 in HIV-Tat stimulated CD4+ T cells from healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Of the 18 HIV-infected patients treated with MVC-intensified cART, 12 had a significantly increased CD4+ T-cell count after 24 weeks of additional treatment with MVC. In patients exhibiting a response in CD4+ T-cell counts, mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b3 in CD4+ T cells were lower than those in patients showing a non-response at baseline and at week 24, while mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b3 decreased in both groups at 24 weeks. In conclusion, MVC decreased the mRNA level of IFN-\u03b3 in CD4+ T cells in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, especially in patients whose CD4+ T-cell count increased significantly. We also found that the lower baseline IFN-\u03b3 mRNA level and the larger decreased rate of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA in CD4+ T cells were associated with a good response to MVC regarding CD4+ T-cell recovery.",

In the present paper we discuss the same inverse problem. We show a log type stability estimate under an additional condition on potentials in terms of their X-ray transform. In proving our result, we follow the same method as in Alessandrini and Sylvester (1990) [1] and Bellassoued, Choulli and Yamamoto (2009) [4] . That is we relate the stability estimate for our inverse spectral problem to a stability estimate for an inverse problem consisting in the determination of the potential in a wave equation from a local Dirichlet to Neumann map (DN map in short).",

A conditional stability estimate is flrst achieved by the Carleman estimate for such recon- struction. Numerical reconstruction algorithm is proposed based on the out- put least-squares formulation with the Tikhonov regularization using the flnite element discretization, and the existence and convergence of the flnite element solution are presented.

A mathematical formulation for the forward and inverse problems is introduced and the uniqueness of the inverse problem is proved. The finite-difference method is utilized for the discretization of the forward problem. Based on our analysis, we propose a fast-reconstruction method for solving the inverse problem, which can be easily realized in practice. Some regularization techniques are implemented to overcome the ill-posedness of the problem.

Under several assumptions on G, such as G = '(A A) or more generally R(G) R ('(A A)), inequalities of the form %2(G) A A, or range inclusions R(%(G)) R (|A|), convergence rates for the regularization error kx x\u2020k of Tikhonov regularization are established.

Our results are: (i) in a general case the distance between two unknown sub-boundaries is conditionally estimated with double logarithmic rate under a priori assumption of C2-boundedness.

Assuming null surface displace- ment on the whole boundary, we first prove an estimate of the surface traction in terms of the energy of the solution and the body force. Then, under suitable restrictions on the density and the Lame coefficients, we show that, in the absence of body forces, the elastic energy can be controlled by the surface traction exerted on a suitable sub-boundary pro- vided that the final observability time is sufficiently large. The latter condition is related with the density, the Lame coefficients, and the geometry of the body. These inequalities are applied to an inverse source problem for the Lame system.",

In particular, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the solutions as the time variable t \u2192 0 and t \u2192 +\u221e. By the Laplace transform method, we show that the solutions decay logarithmically as t \u2192 +\u221e. As t \u2192 0, the decay rate of the solutions is dominated by the term (t log(1/t))\u22121. Thus the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the initial-boundary-value problem for the distributed order time-fractional diffusion equations is shown to be different compared to the case of the multi-term fractional diffusion equations.",

By means of the Mittag-Leffler functions and the eigenfunction expansion, we reduce the IBVP to an equivalent integral equation to show the unique existence and the analyticity of the solution for the equation. Especially, in the case where all the coefficients of the time-fractional derivatives are non-negative, by the Laplace and inversion Laplace transforms, it turns out that the decay rate of the solution for long time is dominated by the lowest order of the time-fractional derivatives. Finally, as an application of the analyticity of the solution, the uniqueness of an inverse problem in determining the fractional orders in the multi-term time-fractional diffusion equations from one interior point observation is established.",

Compared to the already published results, our findings have two important special features. First, we derive a maximum principle for a suitably defined weak solution in the fractional Sobolev spaces, not for the strong solution. Second, for the non-negative source functions $F = F(x,t)$ we prove the non-negativity of the weak solution to the problem under consideration without any restrictions on the sign of the coefficient $c=c(x)$ by the derivative of order zero in the spatial differential operator. Moreover, we prove the monotonicity of the solution with respect to the coefficient $c=c(x)$.",

More precisely, we attempt to recovera spatial component of the nucleation rate by partial interior observationdata. After a direct derivation of a hyperbolic-type governing equation fromthe original model, we establish the well-posedness result for the forwardproblem by the classical hyperbolic theory. To guarantee the validity of thereconstruction, we prove the two-sided global Lipschitz stability for theinverse problem based on a Carleman estimate. Motivated by the iterativethresholding algorithm for the same problem for hyperbolic equations, wedevelop an iterative thresholding algorithm for the identification. Extensivenumerical experiments up to three spatial dimensions demonstrate the efficiencyand accuracy of the algorithm, and detailed analysis of the computationalperformance is also provided.",

The proof is mainly based on the Laplace transform and the unique continuation properties for elliptic and parabolic equations.

As a direct application, we prove the uniqueness for an inverse problem on determining the spatial component in the source term by interior measurements.

This is by means of the Bukhgeim\u2013Klibanov method, based on an appropriate Carleman estimate. Since the time symmetrization of the static magnetic Schrodinger equation around    t  =  0    is not possible, we preliminarily establish a Carleman inequality specifically designed for this problem.",

The stability of the inverse problem is first established, and then the numerical reconstruction is mainly studied. The reconstruction process is done by Tikhonov regularization with the regularizing terms being the L2-norms of gradients, and is carried out in such a way that the temperature solution of the heat equation matches its fixed time observation and its subregion observation optimally in the L2-norm sense. The continuous nonlinear optimization system will be discretized by the piecewise linear finite element method, and the existence of discrete minimizers and convergence of the finite element approximation are shown. The discrete finite element problem is solved by a nonlinear gradient method with an efficient nonlinear multigrid technique for accelerating the reconstruction process. Numerical experiments are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed nonlinear multigrid gradient method for solving the inverse parabolic problem.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we establish a novel unique continuation property for two-dimensional anisotropic elasticity systems with partial information. More precisely, given a homogeneous elasticity system in a domain, we investigate the unique continuation by assuming only the vanishing of one component of the solution in a subdomain. Using the corresponding Riemann function, we prove that the solution vanishes in the whole domain provided that the other component vanishes at one point up to its second derivatives. Further, we construct several examples showing the possibility of further reducing the additional information of the other component. This result possesses remarkable significance in both theoretical and practical aspects because the required data is almost halved for the unique determination of the whole solution.",

        "title": "Quantitative ultrasound and vertebral fractures in patients with type 2 diabetes.",
        "abstract": "Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are known to have increased risks of femoral neck and vertebral fractures, although their bone mineral density (BMD) is normal or even slightly increased compared to non-DM controls. This observation suggests that bone fragility not reflected by BMD, possibly deterioration of bone quality, may participate in their fracture risks. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS), unlike BMD, could possibly evaluate bone quality, especially the microarchitecture, and therefore may be useful for assessing fracture risk in T2DM. To test this hypothesis, we measured calcaneal QUS as well as BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and 1/3 radius in 96 women (mean age 66.6 years old) and 99 men (64.7 years old) with T2DM, and examined their associations with prevalent vertebral fractures (VFs). Calcaneal QUS was performed by CM-200 (Elk Corp., Osaka, Japan), and speed of sound (SOS) values were obtained. BMD was measured by QDR4500 (Hologic, Waltham, MA). In T2DM patients, VFs were found in 33 and 45 subjects in women and men, respectively. When compared between subjects with and without VFs, there were no significant differences in values of SOS or BMD at any site between the groups in either gender. The distribution of SOS as a function of age showed that those with VFs were scattered widely, and there were no SOS thresholds for VFs in either gender. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and BMI showed that either SOS or BMD was not significantly associated with the presence of VFs in either gender. These results show that QUS as well as BMD are unable to discriminate T2DM patients with prevalent VFs from those without VFs. It seems necessary to seek other imaging modalities or biochemical markers evaluating bone fragility and fracture risk in T2DM.",

        "abstract": "We found that serum osteocalcin, femoral bone mineral density (F-BMD), and 1/3R-BMD were decreased during pioglitazone treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, baseline atherosclerosis parameter, serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and urinary N-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (uNTX) values were associated with changes in bone mineral density (BMD). Therefore, these parameters could assess the risk of BMD reduction in patients treated with pioglitazone.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pioglitazone or metformin on bone mass and atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes.A total of 55 Japanese patients were enrolled in this 1-year open-label study and randomized to either pioglitazone (n\u2009=\u200922, 15-30 mg/day) or metformin (n\u2009=\u200923, 500-750 mg/day) groups. BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck (F), and one third of the radius (1/3R), bone markers, and atherosclerosis parameters were measured.In the pioglitazone group, serum osteocalcin significantly decreased at 6 months (p\u2009<\u20090.05), although it almost recovered to baseline level at 12 months. F-BMD significantly decreased at 6 months (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and 1/3R-BMD significantly decreased at 6 and 12 months (p\u2009<\u20090.05), while bone markers or BMD at any site were not changed in the metformin group. Although atherosclerosis parameters were not changed in the pioglitazone group, intima-media thickness (IMT)-mean significantly increased at 6 months (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and plaque score significantly increased at 6 and 12 months (p\u2009<\u20090.01) in the metformin group. In the pioglitazone group, %changes in F-BMD were significantly and negatively correlated with baseline IMT-Max, IMT-mean, and plaque scores (r\u2009=\u2009-0.61, p\u2009<\u20090.01; r\u2009=\u2009-0.71, p\u2009<\u20090.01; and r\u2009=\u2009-0.68, p\u2009<\u20090.01, respectively), and %changes in 1/3R-BMD were significantly and negatively correlated with baseline uNTX and IMT-Max (r\u2009=\u2009-0.57, p\u2009<\u20090.01 and r\u2009=\u2009-0.48, p\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively) and positively with IGF-I (r\u2009=\u20090.45, p\u2009<\u20090.05).Baseline IMT, uNTX, and IGF-I could assess the risk of BMD reduction in diabetic patients treated with pioglitazone.",

We present here that the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion frequently occurs in patients with the Asian variant of intravascular large B cell lymphoma. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion was found in eight of 118 (6.8%) lymphoma patients at the first diagnosis. Although there were six (5.1%) among 118 lymphoma patients with the Asian variant of intravascular large B cell lymphoma, four of the six patients (66.7%) developed the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. In four patients with the Asian variant of intravascular large B cell lymphoma with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, elevated serum interleukin-6 and low sodium levels were almost normalized after chemotherapy. The Asian variant of intravascular large B cell lymphoma patients frequently develop the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and interleukin-6 might play a role in the occurrence of this disease. We should pay attention to hyponatremia caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in patients with the Asian variant of intravascular large B cell lymphoma.",

We analyzed the relationships between bone markers (osteocalcin [OC], bone-specific alkaline phosphatase [BAP], urinary N-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type-I collagen) or BMD and HbA(1c), urinary C-peptide, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), parathyroid hormone, 1,25(OH)(2) vitamin D, and the presence of prevalent vertebral fractures. Multiple regression analysis adjusted for age, body height, weight, duration of diabetes, and serum creatinine showed that serum OC and OC/BAP ratio were correlated negatively with HbA(1c) (P < 0.01) and positively with IGF-I (P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for the above parameters showed that serum OC/BAP ratio was inversely associated with the presence of vertebral fractures (odds ratio = 0.695, P < 0.05). This association was still significant after additional adjustment for lumbar or femoral neck BMD. Our results suggest that poor diabetic control and lower IGF-I level are linked to impaired bone formation and resultant reduction in OC/BAP ratio in men with type 2 diabetes. The OC/BAP ratio could be clinically useful for assessing the risk of vertebral fractures independent of BMD in diabetic men.",

        "abstract": "Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) is a severe systemic adverse drug reaction. Previous studies showed that DIHS is associated with the onset of fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus (FT1D). Although genetic background and abnormalities in immune response or viral infection are considered to be associated with pathogenesis of FT1D, it remains unclear whether virus infection and specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing are involved in DIHS-associated FT1D. Here, we report a case of a 78-year-old female patient with FT1D after DIHS treatment. She was diagnosed as DIHS caused by carbamazepine, and treatment with predonisolone was initiated. After 46 days from the occurrence of DIHS, she was admitted to our hospital because of type 1 diabetes mellitus and diabetic ketoacidosis. Although her Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was elevated by predonisolone treatment (HbA1c: 9.2%), we diagnosed her as fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus considering the abrupt onset of the ketoacidosis. Her general condition was improved by treatment with fluid infusion and insulin administration. During her clinical course, the infection of coxsackie B4 virus was observed. In addition, the examination of HLA typing showed HLA-A24 haplotype. These findings suggest that the coxsackie B4 virus infection may be involved in the pathogenesis of DIHS-induced FT1D, and that HLA-A24 haplotype might relate to DIHS-associated FT1D.",

        "abstract": "The association of bone with the metabolic syndrome and its features, visceral fat accumulation or insulin resistance, remains unclear. We determined visceral and subcutaneous fat areas (V and S) by computed tomography on 187 men (28-83 years) and 125 postmenopausal women (46-82 years) with type 2 diabetes. Men whose V was 100 cm(2) or more had significantly lower urinary N-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type-I collagen (p=0.005), higher femoral neck bone mineral density (FN-BMD) (p=0.004), and lower prevalence of vertebral fractures (VFs) (p=0.04) than controls. Fat mass, V, S, and lean body mass positively correlated with FN-BMD in men and with lumbar (L) and FN-BMD in women. When adjusted for weight, these correlations became negative. Urinary C-peptide positively correlated with FN-BMD in both genders. Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, height, weight, L-BMD, duration of diabetes, and diabetes therapies identified V in men and urinary C-peptide in women as factors inversely associated with the presence of VFs [odds ratio (OR)=0.61 per SD increase, p=0.04, and OR=0.32, p=0.01, respectively]. These findings suggest that, of the components of the metabolic syndrome, body fat in gravity and hyperinsulinemia could increase FN-BMD in diabetic subjects. Visceral fat in men and hyperinsulinemia in women may protect against VFs independent of weight, L-BMD, diabetes duration, or therapies.",

        "abstract": "Crooke's cell adenoma (CCA) is an aggressive subtype of corticotroph adenoma; however, CCA is associated with a high incidence of low expression of methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT), suggesting that temozolomide (TMZ) treatment might be effective for this tumor type. The case of a 56-year-old woman with Cushing's disease caused by a pituitary CCA is presented. At the age of 38 years, the patient presented to our hospital with polyuria and a visual field defect. MRI and laboratory studies showed a 4.5-cm-diameter pituitary tumor with plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and serum cortisol levels of more than 500 pg/mL and 40 \u03bcg/dL, respectively. At 39 years of age, the patient underwent a craniotomy, and her plasma ACTH and cortisol levels decreased to less than 200 pg/mL and 10 \u03bcg/dL, respectively; however, these hormone levels increased gradually to 3,940 pg/mL and 70 \u03bcg/dL, respectively, by the time the patient was 56 years old. Histopathological re-examination of the previously resected specimen showed that the pituitary tumor was MGMT-negative CCA. TMZ treatment after the second operation decreased the plasma ACTH levels from 600-800 pg/mL to 70-300 pg/mL. No signs of recurrence were observed in the seven years following these treatments with added prophylactic radiation therapy. These clinical findings suggest that TMZ treatment to patients with CCA accompanied with elevated ACTH may be good indication to induce lowering ACTH levels and tumor shrinkage.",

        "abstract": "Although patients with type 2 diabetes show no bone mineral density (BMD) reduction, fracture risks are known to increase. It is unclear why the patients have an increased risk of fracture despite sufficient BMD. We investigated the relationships of body mass index (BMI), HbA(1c), and urinary C-peptide (uC-peptide) versus BMD, bone metabolic markers, serum adiponectin, and prevalent vertebral fracture (VF). A total of 163 Japanese type 2 diabetic men were consecutively recruited, and radiographic and biochemical data were collected. BMI was positively correlated with BMD at the whole body, lumbar spine, and femoral neck (P < 0.05) and negatively correlated with osteocalcin and urinary N-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type-I collagen (uNTX) (P < 0.01). HbA(1c) was negatively correlated with osteocalcin (P < 0.01) but not BMD at any site. Subjects were classified into four groups based on BMI and HbA(1c) (group LL BMI < 24 and HbA(1c) < 9, group LH BMI < 24 and HbA(1c) > or = 9, group HL BMI > or = 24 and HbA(1c) < 9, group HH BMI > or = 24 and HbA(1c) > or = 9). Serum adiponectin, osteocalcin, and uNTX were lower and the incidence of VF was higher despite sufficient BMD in the HH group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, duration of diabetes, uC-peptide, and estimated glomerular filtration rate showed that the HH group was associated with the presence of a VF and multiple VFs (odds ratio [OR] = 3.056, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.031-9.056, P = 0.0439, and OR = 5.415, 95% CI 1.126-26.040, P = 0.0350, respectively).

Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, body mass index, and L-BMD showed that the presence of T2DM was an independent risk factor for prevalent VFs in women (OR = 1.86, p = 0.019) and men (OR = 4.73, p < 0.001). BMD at any site, however, was not significantly associated with the presence of prevalent VFs in T2DM patients, in contrast to the significant association in controls (at least p = 0.010). Comparison of T2DM patients with and without VFs showed no significant differences in BMD values, bone markers, or diabetes status. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the absolute L-, FN-, and R-BMD values for detecting prevalent VFs were higher in T2DM patients than controls, whereas their sensitivity and specificity were lower. T2DM patients may have an increased risk of VFs independent of BMD or diabetic complication status, suggesting that bone quality may define bone fragility in T2DM.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between osteoporosis and magnesium (Mg) deficiency is still controversial. Here we report a case of an 82-year-old woman with a giant adenomatous goiter and severe osteoporosis with multiple vertebral fractures, whose clinical course indicated that her osteoporosis was probably due to Mg deficiency. She visited our hospital for treatments of tetany. Laboratory data showed the existence of hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, vitamin D deficiency, and slightly elevated intact PTH. Intravenous administration of Mg not only improved these electrolyte abnormalities but also increased serum levels of intact PTH, bone formation markers, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, as well as bone resorption markers in the urine, and lowered urinary phosphate reabsorption. Hypomagnesemia on admission seemed to arise from long-lasting poor food intake and malnutrition, because it improved after the disappearance of dysphagia with a goiter resection. After the operation, BMD values at the lumbar spine and femoral neck obviously increased during 6 months of Mg supplementation without any specific therapies for osteoporosis. Mg deficiency in this case seemed to cause impaired secretion of PTH from the parathyroid and the refractoriness of bone and kidney to the hormone, which led to the suppression of both bone remodeling and renal vitamin D production. These processes were probably linked to her severe osteoporosis, which was reversed by Mg supplementation.",

        "abstract": "We used osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells to clarify the mechanisms by which dexamethasone (Dex) suppresses osteoblast function, or alendronate or parathyroid hormone (PTH) alleviate it. Dex (10(-7)M) increased mRNA expression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonists, follistatin and Dan, and of a Wnt antagonist, secreted frizzled-related protein-1 (sFRP-1) and a Wnt signal inhibitor, axin-2, while concomitantly decreased the expression of downstream molecules, Runx2 mRNA and beta-catenin protein. Pretreatments with alendronate (10(-8)M) or human PTH-(1-34) (10(-8)M) totally or partially antagonized not only the Dex-induced enhancement in mRNA expression of follistatin/Dan and sFRP-1/axin-2 but also the Dex-induced reduction in Runx2 mRNA expression and mineralization. These findings suggest that Dex suppresses the Wnt and BMP pathways as well as osteoblast function by enhancing the expression of BMP and Wnt antagonists, and bisphosphonate and PTH exert pharmacologic effects by canceling these processes.",

        "abstract": "Adiponectin is a key mediator of the metabolic syndrome that is caused by visceral fat accumulation. Adiponectin and its receptors are known to be expressed in osteoblasts, but their actions with regard to bone metabolism are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of adiponectin on the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells.Adiponectin receptor type 1 (AdipoR1) mRNA was detected in the cells by RT-PCR. The adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMP kinase) was phosphorylated by both adiponectin and a pharmacological AMP kinase activator, 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide-riboside (AICAR), in the cells. AdipoR1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection potently knocked down the receptor mRNA, and the effect of this knockdown persisted for as long as 10 days after the transfection. The transfected cells showed decreased expressions of type I collagen and osteocalcin mRNA, as determined by real-time PCR, and reduced ALP activity and mineralization, as determined by von Kossa and Alizarin red stainings. In contrast, AMP kinase activation by AICAR (0.01-0.5 mM) in wild-type MC3T3-E1 cells augmented their proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization. BrdU assay showed that the addition of adiponectin (0.01-1.0 mug/ml) also promoted their proliferation. Osterix, but not Runx-2, appeared to be involved in these processes because AdipoR1 siRNA transfection and AICAR treatments suppressed and enhanced osterix mRNA expression, respectively.Taken together, this study suggests that adiponectin stimulates the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of osteoblasts via the AdipoR1 and AMP kinase signaling pathways in autocrine and/or paracrine fashions.",

        "abstract": "We have observed that tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), acts as a self-protection factor against nitric oxide (NO) toxicity in PC12 cells. To further investigate the self-protection action of BH4 in vivo, the effect of deletion of endogenous BH4 on NO-producing cells was examined in the rat hippocampus. Following the peripheral infusion of 50 mM 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP), an inhibitor of GTP cyclohydrolase I, using a miniosmotic pump for 14 days, BH4 content in the hippocampus decreased as compared with the control group administered with vehicle solution, which had no effect on brain BH4 content. When the rats were administered with 50 mM DAHP and 10 mM BH4, the DAHP-induced decrease in BH4 content was prevented. The extracellular concentration of NO metabolites remained unchanged following DAHP administration, suggesting that DAHP-induced decrease in BH4 content had no effect on NO production. The number of NOS-positive cells decreased following DAHP administration in the hippocampal regions, while the number of NOS-negative cells remained unchanged. The DAHP-induced decrease in the NOS-positive cell number was prevented by the administration of 10 mM BH4 and DAHP. These results suggest that endogenous BH4 may affect NOS-positive cell number in the rat hippocampus.",

        "abstract": "Although previous studies indicated that hypoglycemic agents could affect bone metabolism, little is known about whether these agents are associated with the risks of osteoporotic fracture in Japanese patents with type 2 diabetes. We examined whether treatments of diabetes, such as insulin administration, sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, and metformin, were associated with the presence of vertebral fractures in 494 men and 344 postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes. We analyzed the relationships between each treatment versus bone turnover markers, bone mineral density (BMD), and the presence of prevalent vertebral fractures. Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, duration of diabetes, body mass index, serum creatinine, serum C-peptide, and HbA(1c) showed that, in postmenopausal women, treatments with insulin administration or thiazolidinedione were significantly and positively associated with the presence of vertebral fractures [odds ratio (OR) = 2.27, P = 0.012 and OR = 3.38, P = 0.038, respectively], whereas treatment with sulfonylurea was significantly and inversely associated with vertebral fractures (OR = 0.48, P = 0.018). These relationships were still significant after additional adjustment for lumbar BMD. In contrast, no significant relationships between treatments with any agent and the presence of vertebral fractures were found in men. These findings suggest that postmenopausal women treated with insulin or thiazolidinedione have a high risk of vertebral fractures independent of age, body stature, blood glucose level, insulin secretion, or BMD whereas treatment with sulfonylurea is associated with a decreased risk.",

One hundred forty-eight men and 106 postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes were assessed in a cross-sectional study. Serum DHEA-S and IGF-I concentrations were measured and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and ultrasonographically-evaluated intima-media thickness (IMT) were assessed. Although simple regression analysis showed that log(DHEA-S) and IGF-I in men and log(DHEA-S) in women were significantly and inversely correlated with baPWV and IMT, only log(DHEA-S) in women was still significantly and inversely correlated with these atherosclerotic parameters after multiple regression analysis was adjusted for age, duration of diabetes, BMI, HbA(1C), systolic blood pressure, LDL-Cholesterol (C), serum creatinine, and smoking (Brinkman index). Serum DHEA-S level seemed to be associated with atherosclerosis in diabetic postmenopausal women independent of age, body stature, diabetic status, and other atherosclerotic risk factors, and might be a useful addition to other parameters for assessing the risk of atherosclerosis in this population.",

Poor bone quality is the most suitable and explainable cause for the elevated fracture risk in this population. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are diverse compounds generated via a non-enzymatic reaction between reducing sugars and amine residues, physically affect the properties of the bone material, one of a component of bone quality, through their accumulation in the bone collagen fibers. On the other hand, these compounds biologically act as agonists for these receptors for AGEs (RAGE) and suppress bone metabolism. The concentrations of AGEs and endogenous secretory RAGE, which acts as a \u201cdecoy receptor\u201d that inhibits the AGEs-RAGE signaling axis, are associated with fracture risk in a BMD-independent manner. AGEs are closely associated with the pathogenesis of this unique clinical manifestation through physical and biological mechanisms in patients with diabetes mellitus.",

Among the results of the comprehensive gene chip analysis of the intestine and liver, we featured heat shock proteins (HSPs) 70 and 105 because their gene expression changed only in the presence of microflora. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to confirm the expression levels of these HSP genes. To determine whether JTX acts directly on the HSP genes, sodium arsenite (SA) was used to induce the heat shock proteins directly. To examine the change of the intestinal microflora with administration of JTX, the terminal restriction fragment polymorphism (T-RFLP) method was used. To identify the changed bacteria, DNA sequencing was performed.Heat shock protein gene expression, documented by gene chip and real-time RT-PCR, changed with the administration of JTX in the regular mice but not in the germ-free mice. JTX did not suppress the direct induction of the HSPs by SA. T-RFLP suggested that JTX decreased unculturable bacteria and increased Lactobacillus johnsoni. These data suggested that JTX changed the intestinal microflora which, in turn, changed HSP gene expression.Intestinal microflora affects multi-herbal product JTX on the gene expression in the gut and liver.",

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the prostaglandin-producing enzyme cyclooxygenases (COXs), and can induce serious complications, such as gastrointestinal damage, with long-term treatment. Orengedokuto (OGT), a Japanese traditional herbal medicine (Kampo medicine), is effective in various animal models of enteropathy. In the present study we examined whether OGT prevents enteropathy induced by NSAIDs in mice. Ulceration in the small intestine was induced with 2 subcutaneous injections of indomethacin (20 mg/kg body weight). Orally administered OGT prevented or reduced lethality, intestinal lesions, bleeding, increased serum nitrate/nitrite levels, and reduction of mucosal PGE2 induced by indomethacin. These beneficial effects of OGT were accompanied by increased production of PGE2 and interleukin 10 by isolated lamina propria mononuclear cells; COX-2 in these cells may be a major source of PGE2 in normal intestines. These findings suggest that OGT could be an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and adverse reactions to NSAIDs.",

Glucocorticoids (corticosterone, hydrocortisone and dexamethasone) and the mineralcorticoid d-aldosterone dose-dependently increased protein and mRNA levels of Bcl-xL, but not of pro-apoptotic member of Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bax and Bad. Estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone showed little or no effect on the expression of Bcl-xL. Our findings thus indicate that Bcl-xL gene expression can be modulated by hormonal stimuli and may give an insight into the mechanism of hormonal regulation of apoptosis in liver and hepatoma cells.",

        "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis can be exacerbated or induced by scratching or psychological stress; both cause the release of substance\n P (SP) from sensory nerves. Therefore, SP may have an etiological role in mechanisms underlying AD. Here, we show that administration\n of SP during the primary immune response (PIR) imprinted long-lasting pro-inflammatory immunity, resulting in exacerbation\n of the secondary immune response (SIR) in the absence of further SP. Five days after sensitization with dinitrofluorobenzene\n (DNFB), challenge with DNFB together with SP (\u201cSP-Group\u201d) resulted in an increased PIR (as evaluated by ear swelling and granulocyte\n infiltration) compared to DNFB only (\u201cControl-Group\u201d). On day\u00a026, after inflammation completely subsided, a second challenge\n with DNFB only (without SP) caused an increased SIR in the \u201cSP-Group\u201d compared to controls. Pretreatment on day\u00a05 with spantide,\n an SP receptor antagonist, prevented increased ear swelling in the \u201cSP-Group\u201d not only on day\u00a05 (PIR) but also on day\u00a026 (SIR).\n In contrast, spantide treatment on day\u00a026 did not affect the SIR. Adoptive transfer experiments suggested that CD8+ T cells were involved in mediating enhanced SIR in animals pretreated on day\u00a05 with SP. The present study offers a novel\n experimental approach to an uninvestigated facet of the pro-inflammatory effect of SP, i.e., exacerbation of inflammation\n via a long-term and indirect influence on CD8+ T lymphocytes.",

We investigated the effects of BN on salivation and bladder function in rats, in the presence and absence of oxybutynin. Treatment with BN alone resulted in a slight increase in salivary secretions. In contrast, pilocarpine, a known muscarinic agonist, produced a significant increase in salivary secretions that could be blocked by pretreatment with oxybutynin. A single oral dose of BN at 200mg/kg body weight just before oxybutynin treatment resulted in less inhibition by oxybutynin of pilocarpine-induced salivation. However, BN had no effect on the decreased amplitude of bladder contractions that result from oxybutynin administration. These results suggest that BN might be useful for the xerostomia induced by anticholinergic agents, without influencing their beneficial effect on micturition.",

However, the effect of maternal stress on the postnatal growth of pups has not been widely reported. In this study, we found that maternal immobilization stress (IS) during lactation resulted in low body weight of male mouse offspring, which persisted after weaning. Despite free access to chow, IS induced maternal malnutrition and decreased the serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels in the mothers and in the pups. mRNA expression analysis of anterior pituitary hormones in the pups revealed that growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL), but no other hormones, were decreased by IS. Expression of the pituitary transcription factor PIT1 and isoforms of PITX2, which are essential for the development and function of GH-producing somatotropes and PRL-producing lactotropes, was decreased, whereas that of PROP1, which is critical for the earlier stages of pituitary development, was unchanged. Immunohistochemistry also showed a decrease in pituitary PRL protein expression. These results suggest that stress in a postpartum mother has persistent effects on the body weight of the offspring. Reduced PRL expression in the offspring's pituitary gland may play a role in these effects.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that Fas-mediated apoptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of intestinal injury. In this study, we determined the role of Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) interactions in different T cell compartments using a murine model of small intestinal injury. An intraperitoneal injection of 145-2C11 (anti-CD3) antibody into C3H/HeN, BALB/c and MRL mice induced mucosal flattening and rapid, bi-phasic intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) apoptosis, which was detected by conventional light and electron microscopy and by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling. In the first, early phase, villous apoptosis was observed up to 4 h after injection, and in the second, later phase, apoptotic crypt cells gradually accumulated for up to 24 h. The early and later phases of apoptosis were reduced in lpr/lpr and nude mice compared with those in control strains. In addition, the kinetics of Fas-mediated killer activity induced by the antibody injection were different between intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and splenocytes (SPL) and seemed to correlate with the bi-phasic occurrence of the apoptosis. Finally, the transfer of intestinal IEL from euthymic to nude mice induced both phases of apoptosis, whereas SPL induced the second phase's crypt apoptosis only by the antibody injection. Together, these results suggest the involvement of Fas-mediated killer activity of thymus-derived T cells in different compartments. Namely, T cell populations in different compartments are differentially involved in the induction of IEC apoptosis and contribute to the complex pathogenesis of immune-mediated intestinal injury in which Fas/FasL interactions may play a critical role.",

        "abstract": "Background/Aim: Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) locates in the cell membrane of enterochromaffin cells (EC), and TRPA1 stimulation on EC is proposed to modulate intestinalmotility via release of serotonin (5-HT). Although a previous study has demonstrated that TRPA1 agonists produce a contractile response in isolated intestinal muscle strips in vitro, apparently contradictory results have been reported for gastrointestinal (GI) transit in vivo. The Japanese traditional medicine daikenchuto (TU-100), which is being investigated as a new drug in the US and is used for the treatment of postoperative ileus (POI) in Japan, was reported to accelerate GI transit in animals and humans. TU-100 has recently been shown to increase intestinal blood flow via stimulation of TRPA1 located on the epithelial cells of the small intestine. The present study investigates the effects of TU-100, TU-100 ingredients, and TRPA1 agonists on dysregulated intestinal transit in an established murine POI model. Methods: The POI model, which involves manipulation of colon and small intestinal transit, was evaluated by calculating the geometric center of distribution of fluorescent-labeled dextran markers. The in vitro motility of isolated mouse small intestine in an organ bath was evaluated by video imaging and intraluminal pressure was measured by a strain gauge transducer. 5-HT release from isolated small intestinal segments or a rat pancreatic endocrine cell line RIN-14B, which is supposed to have common properties with EC, was measured by ELISA and/or HPLC. The tested compounds included the well known TRPA1 agonists aryl isothiocyanate (AITC) and cinnamaldehyde (CA), as well as TU-100 and its ingredients shogaol and hydroxy-\u03b1-sanshool, which stimulate TRPA1. TRPA1 KO mice were also studied. Results: Orally administered TRPA1 agonists, TU-100, and TU100 ingredients improved small intestinal transit in the POI model. Incubation of small intestinal segments with TRPA1 agonists and TU-100 ingredients resulted in an increase in the level of 5-HT in the culture supernatant. The effects of AITC and TU-100 ingredients, but not CA, were abrogated in TRPA1 KO mice. All agents induced the release of 5-HT from RIN14B cells Conclusion: TRPA1 stimulation by TU-100 may be involved in its beneficial effect on POI. The role of TRPA1 in GI motility deserves further extensive investigation with the aim of developing a novel therapeutic strategy to treat GI motility disorders.",

        "abstract": "The pharmacological characteristics of Ryokan-kyomi-shinge-nin-to (RKS), a traditional oriental herbal (Kampo) medicine which has been used for the treatment of allergic asthma and rhinitis, were investigated. The number of sneezes by actively sensitized mice after a topical antigen challenge was significantly reduced by pretreatment with RKS (300 and 1000 mg/kg, p.o.). Although RKS did not inhibit the antigen-induced histamine release from rat peritoneal exudate cells (PEC), it significantly inhibited an increase in vascular permeability induced by histamine and serotonin. These results suggest that RKS has antiallergic activity in animals, and the functional antagonism of a histamine response may be one of the mechanisms of its effect. In addition, RKS prevented histamine hypersensitivity in actively sensitized mice. Because RKS did not affect sleeping time induced by pentobarbital in mice and did not inhibit gastric emptying in rats, the drug appears to be useful for treating allergic patients suffering from classical antihistamines side effects such as stomach discomfort or relative drowsiness.",

We tested the traditional herbal medicines Saireito (SR) and Boiogito (BO), which have been used clinically for the treatment of pre-eclampsia, in this model. L-NAME was infused subcutaneously into pregnant rats from gestational day 14 (G14). SR and BO (both at 1, 2g/kg) were administered by gavage from G14 to G20. Systolic blood pressure was measured on G19. SR and BO (both at 1, 2g/kg) inhibited L-NAME-induced hypertension. SR was effective in both pregnant and non-pregnant rats while BO was effective only in pregnant rats. BO increased blood levels of CGRP and decreased levels of endothelin-1; both are known to play important roles in regulation of blood pressure in pre-eclampsia. SR and BO may be beneficial for the treatment and prevention of hypertension in pre-eclampsia.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies of adult neurogenesis of the mammalian central nervous system have suggested unexpected plasticity and complexity of neural cell ontogenesis. Redefinition and reconstitution of cell classification and lineage relationships, especially between glial and neural precursors, are an urgent and crucial concern. In the present study, we describe a new monoclonal antibody, A3B10, which was produced by immunizing mice with the membrane fraction prepared from astrocyte-enriched primary neural cell cultures. Immunohistochemistry of brain sections, including brains from glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-deficient mice and primary mixed neural cell cultures, as well as immunoblot analysis and immunoelectron microscopy, have revealed that 1) A3B10 recognizes a majority of cells in ependyma in neonatal and adult rats, 2) A3B10 stains almost all GFAP(+) cells and some S100beta(+) cells in the corpus callosum, 3) A3B10 specifically stains astrocytes in vitro in primary cultures of rat embryonic cerebral hemispheres, 4) A3B10 equally stains ependymal cells of wild-type and GFAP-deficient mice, and 5) A3B10 antigen might construct intermediate filament bundles with GFAP and/or vimentin. These data suggested that the antibody labels a wide array of astorcytic-lineage cells including astrocytes, astrocyte precursors, and neural stem cells. Screening a cDNA library derived from rat embryonic brain has revealed that the antibody recognizes calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 1 (Camsap1). Thus this antibody may provide not only a new marker to identify astrocyte-lineage cells but also a new target molecule to elucidate the ontogeny, development, and pathophysiological functions of astrocyte-lineage cells.",

        "abstract": "The present study is part of a program to obtain effective chemopreventive agents with low toxicity from medicinal herbs and traditional herbal medicines. We previously reported that Oren (Coptidis rhizoma) and Ogon (Scutellariae radix) inhibit azoxymethane (AOM)-induced aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation. In the present investigation, we found Sanshishi (Gardeniae fructus) and the traditional herbal medicine Oren-gedoku-to (OGT), composed of Ogon, Oren, Sanshishi and Obaku, also have preventive potential. Sanshishi and OGT decreased the numbers of ACF to 25.2 and 59.4% of the control value at 2% in the diet, respectively. Adverse effects, evidenced by body weight loss, were weaker with OGT than component herbs. To investigate their mechanisms of action, the influence on cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activities was studied. Both OGT and Sanshishi inhibited COX-2 but not COX-1, this presumably contributing to their suppressive effects on ACF development. The results suggest that OGT may be useful for colon cancer chemoprevention in terms of efficacy and toxicity.",

        "abstract": "The clinical effectiveness of the Kampo medicine Sho-seiryu-to (SST) has recently been demonstrated in a double-blind randomized study of allergic asthma and rhinitis. We investigated the effect of SST on a type 1 allergic model in mice. Ovalbumin (OVA)-induced sneezing and the total and OVA-specific IgE levels were significantly suppressed with SST at 1.0 g/kg, but that of OVA-specific IgG(2a) was not. In the splenocytes isolated from SST-administered mice, OVA-induced interleukin (IL)-4 production decreased while interferon (IFN)-gamma production was not. The co-culture experiments using purified CD4(+)T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) suggested that SST influenced both cell types. Flow-cytometric analysis showed that SST suppressed the number of IL-4 producing CD4(+)T cells but not the number of IFN-gamma producing CD4(+)T cells. The CD86(+) major histocompatibility complex class II(+) (MHC II)(+) cells and CD28(+)CD4(+)T cells were decreased by SST treatment, while CD80(+)MHC II(+) cells, CD40(+)MHC II(+) cells and CD154(+)CD4(+)T cells showed no change. These data suggested that SST may suppress IL-4 production in CD4(+)T cells via influencing CD28-CD86 interaction. In addition to the previously reported inhibitory activity on histamine release, suppression of Th2 differentiation at the stage of APC-CD4(+)T cell interaction may be involved in the anti-allergic effects of SST.",

        "abstract": "Recent endoscopic technology has revealed that small intestinal injury is a serious threat to patients receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We previously showed that Japanese herbal medicine, Orengedokuto (OGT; Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang in Chinese), protects mice from lethal indomethacin (IND)-induced enteropathy. To elucidate the mechanism of the protective effect of OGT, we performed microarray analyses and high power statistical analyses of microarray data using new bioinformatics tools.Female BALB/c mice were subcutaneously injected with IND (20 mg/kg) once a day for 2 days. OGT-treated mice received a diet containing OGT from the first IND injection until the end of the experiment. Gene expression signals of small intestine were obtained with GeneChip. Analyses for overrepresentation of Gene Ontology categories were conducted using MetaGene Profiler (MGP) and the changes were visualized by Cell Illustrator Online (CIO). Furthermore, active ingredients of OGT were investigated.MGP and CIO suggested a critical role for the adenosine system, especially adenosine deaminase (ADA), a key enzyme of adenosine catabolism. Quantitative real time RT-PCR and in situ hybridization showed that OGT decreased the expression of ADA, which possibly resulted in the elevation of the anti-inflammatory nucleoside adenosine. Blockade of the adenosine A2a receptor abrogated the protective effect of OGT. Berberine, a major ingredient of OGT, suppressed ADA expression and reduced the incidence of lethality.OGT may prevent IND-induced enteropathy by decreasing ADA which results in the elevation of adenosine. Modulation of the adenosine system may be an efficient therapeutic strategy for NSAID-induced enteropathy.",

        "abstract": "Sho-saiko-to (SST), a Chinese/Japanese traditional herbal medicine, has been widely used to treat chronic hepatitis in Japan, and the immunomodulatory properties of SST are likely to mediate its beneficial effect. In the present study, we examined the effects of SST and its various ingredients on the count and proliferation of T-cell subsets in cultured splenocytes and hepatic mononuclear cells. SST, wogonin-7-O-glucuronoside (a major SST ingredient), and wogonin (an intestinal metabolite of wogonin-7-O-glucuronoside) increased CD4/CD8 ratio via a decrease of CD8+ T-cell counts with no effect on CD4+ T-cell counts. Flow cytometric analyses of viability, proliferation, and cell cycle revealed that wogonin suppressed CD8+ T-cell proliferation without inducing cell death. SST and wogonin administered to mice increased the CD4/CD8 ratio in hepatic mononuclear cells but not in splenocytes. These findings suggest that SST may modulate the CD4/CD8 ratio via the selective inhibition of CD8+ T-cell proliferation by the SST ingredient wogonin-7-O-glucuronoside or its metabolite wogonin.",

        "abstract": "The authors previously reported that transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) induces apoptosis in McA-RH7777 (7777) and McA-RH8994 (8994) rat hepatoma cell lines. Although these cell lines exhibit different responses to glucocorticoid treatment in various cellular functions and gene expression, dexamethasone (DEX) inhibited spontaneous and TGF-beta1-induced apoptosis in both. Analysis of analogous hormones in TGF-beta1-induced apoptosis in 8994 cells suggested the inhibitory effect to be glucocorticoid-specific. By cell-cycle analysis and DNA fragmentation assay using sodium butyrate, a G1-arrest-inducing reagent, regulation of apoptosis by TGF-beta1 and DEX was shown independent of the cell cycle. For elucidation of the mechanisms of anti-apoptotic action of DEX, the effects of various chemical probes on this apoptosis model were examined, and various reagents known to exhibit anti-apoptotic activity in other experimental systems were found to be ineffective. The effect of TGF-beta1 and DEX on cellular amounts of several apoptosis-related proteins, members of the Bcl-2 family, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-xS, Bad, and Bax was also examined. DEX drastically increased Bcl-xL in both cell lines irrespective of the presence of TGF-beta1. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xS proteins were not detected, and Bax and Bad content did not change by treatment with TGF-beta1 or DEX. Progesterone (Prog), a partial antagonist for glucocorticoid receptor, inhibited the effects of DEX on apoptosis and Bcl-xL expression in 8994 cells. Thus, Bcl-xL induction by DEX would appear closely associated with its inhibitory effect on spontaneous and TGF-beta1-induced apoptosis in the hepatoma cell lines.",

Several Kampo medicines, e.g. Oren-gedoku-to and San'o-shashin-to, were found to inhibit dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in murine thymocytes. Some of these medicines contain Coptidis rhizoma (CR) as the major constituent, and the CR extract showed the most potent inhibitory activity on thymocyte apoptosis of more than 200 species of herbal extracts. The inhibition of apoptosis by CR extract was confirmed by the trypan blue exclusion test, lactate dehydrogenase release measurement, and morphological evaluation by electron microscopy. The benzodioxolo-benzoquinolizine alkaloid, berberine, and five berberine-type alkaloids, isolated from CR extract, had an inhibitory effect, whereas no effect was noted for the aporphin-type alkaloid magnoflorine. The inhibitory action of berberine was also demonstrated on etoposide- and camptothecin-induced apoptosis.",

In this present study, we have developed oligodendrocyte cultures from the 30-month-old rat brain and examined whether oligodendrocyte precursor cells can proliferate in vitro. Adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells (O1(-), O4(+)) and oligodendrocytes (O1(+), O4(+)) are present in the cultures of the 30-month-old rat brain. They are also capable of proliferating and differentiating in the cultures. These capabilities increased four- to fivefold, when the aged rats are treated with Ninjin-Youei-To for 3 months in comparison with those of control aged rats. These results suggest that Ninjin-Youei-To has a potential mitotic effect on oligodendrocyte precursor cells in aged-rat brains and may be expected to have a therapeutic effect on brain aging.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although microbiota play a critical role in the normal development and function of host immune systems, the underlying mechanisms, especially those involved in the large intestine (LI), remain unknown. In the present study, we performed transcriptome analysis of the LI of germ-free (GF) and specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice of the IQI strain, an inbred strain established from ICR mice. RESULTS: GeneChip analysis, quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and reconfirmation using bacteria-inoculated GF mice revealed differences in the expression levels of several immune-related genes, such as cryptdin-related sequences (CRS), certain subsets of type 1 interferon (IFN)-related genes, class Ib MHC molecules, and certain complements. LI expressed no authentic cryptdins but predominantly expressed CRS2, 4, and 7. The mRNA levels of IFN-related genes, including Irf7, Isgf3g, Ifit1 and Stat1, were lower in SPF- and flora-reconstituted mice. When an oral IFN-\u03b1 inducer tilorone analog, R11567DA, was administered to SPF mice, IFN-\u03b1 was induced rapidly in the LI at 4 h, whereas no IFN-\u03b1 protein was detected in the small intestine (SI) or blood. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry suggested that the IFN-\u03b1 production originated from Paneth cells in the SI, and portions of lamina proprial CD11b- or mPDCA1-positive cells in the LI. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that microbial colonization, while inducing the expression of anti-microbial peptides, results in the down-regulation of certain genes responsible for immune responses, especially for type I IFN synthesis. This may reflect the adaptation process of the immune system in the LI to prevent excessive inflammation with respect to continuous microbial exposure. Further, the repertoire of anti-microbial peptides and the extraordinary role of interferon producing cells in the LI have been found to be distinct from those in the SI.",

Suppression of cell death promotes carcinogenesis and contributes to resistance to radiation and chemotherapeutic agents.Direct effects of Bcl-xL protein on apoptosis and necrosis were investigated in rat hepatoma cells. Rat hepatoma cell line McA-RH8994 cells were transfected with expression plasmids containing a whole coding sequence of rat bcl-xL cDNA of sense orientation. Stable transfectant cell lines expressing bcl-xL cDNA (designated as RH8994/Bcl-xL-S), or control plasmid DNA (designated as RH8994/pT) were established.Cellular amounts of Bcl-xL in RH8994/Bcl-xL-S cells were demonstrated to be more than 20-fold that of RH8994/pT and parental cells. Three independent clones of RH8994/Bcl-xL-S were isolated and their susceptibility to various cell death stimuli was compared with that of the control cells. Transforming growth factor-beta1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha induced apoptosis dose dependently in these cells, but the 50% cytotoxicity concentrations of these factors in RH8994/Bcl-xL-S cells were more than 10-fold higher than those in RH8994/pT and parental cells. Similarly, RH8994/Bcl-xL-S cells were shown to be significantly less susceptible to necrotic cell death induced by a calcium ionophore, A23187; a mutagen, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine; and UV-irradiation when compared with the control cells.Over-expression of Bcl-xL was shown to provide protection against apoptotic and necrotic cell death in rat hepatoma cells.",

        "abstract": "We showed previously that a Kampo (Chinese/Japanese herbal) medicine, Inchin-ko-to (ICKT), inhibits hepatocyte apoptosis induced by transforming growth factor beta1 in vitro. The present study investigated whether ICKT or its ingredients inhibit Fas-mediated liver apoptosis in vivo.Acute liver injury was induced by an intravenous injection of anti-Fas antibody, Jo2. The effects of ICKT and its ingredients on lethality, histology, apoptotic index, serum transaminase levels, caspase activation, mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)), and mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) were analyzed. Apoptosis in mouse hepatocytes in vitro was also evaluated.Pretreatment with ICKT rescued 75% of Jo2-treated mice and markedly suppressed liver apoptosis/injury. Genipin, an intestinal bacterial metabolite of geniposide that is a major ingredient of ICKT, was found to be an active principle of ICKT. Genipin also suppressed in vitro Fas-mediated apoptosis in primary-cultured murine hepatocytes. Activation of caspase 3 and 8 in the liver homogenate and rapid reduction of triangle uppsi(m) of hepatocytes isolated from Jo2-treated mice were inhibited by genipin preadministration. The resistance to Ca(2+)-induced MPT was enhanced in liver mitochondria of genipin-treated mice.These results suggest that the antiapoptotic activity of genipin via the interference with MPT is a possible mechanism for therapeutic effects of ICKT.",

        "abstract": "Shosaiko-to (SST), a Chinese/Japanese traditional herbal medicine, has recently been demonstrated to increase lung interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and to ameliorate pulmonary disorders in BALB/c mice (BALB). In the present study, we examined the effects of SST on lung cytokine levels and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury in C57BL/6 mice (B6), which are known to show different immune responses from BALB due to the difference in genetic backgrounds. In B6, in contrast with BALB, SST decreased lung IL-6 levels and exacerbated LPS-induced lung injury. Investigation of the active components of SST suggested that multiple ingredients were supposed to be responsible for IL-6-attenuating activity in vivo. Further, we examined the effect of metabolites of major ingredients of SST on IL-6 production from lung immune cells in vitro. Saikogenin D and oroxylin A attenuated IL-6 production in LPS-stimulated alveolar macrophages of B6 more than in that of BALB. Liquiritigenin, which was previously reported to enhance IL-6 production in anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody-stimulated lung mononuclear cells of BALB, showed no effect on that of B6. These findings suggest that SST may have different, possibly even opposite, effects on lung immunity in hosts with different genetic backgrounds.",

Four healthy human subjects were recruited. Plasma samples were collected before and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8\u202fh after maoto treatment. Endogenous and exogenous compounds in plasma were analyzed using MS. Endogenous compounds including saccharides, amino acids, organic acids and other hydrophilic metabolites were semi-quantitatively measured using GC-MS/MS. Lipid mediators such as arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid were semi-quantitatively measured using LC-MS/MS. Maoto constituents in plasma were quantitatively measured using LC-MS/MS. The data files contain the area ratio values, which were normalized to the intensity of the internal standard, and plasma concentration of maoto compounds. The data article is related to the research article titled \"Phenotyping analysis of the Japanese Kampo medicine maoto in healthy human subjects using wide-targeted plasma metabolomics\" (Kitagawa et al., 2018).",

        "abstract": "The traditional Japanese (kampo) medicine inchinkoto (ICKT) is used in Eastern Asia as a choleretic and hepatoprotective agent. Previously, we reported that ICKT ameliorates murine concanavalin A (con A)-induced hepatitis via suppression of interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-12 production. In the present study, we investigated the active ingredients of ICKT.ICKT and extracts of its component herbs were fractionated, and their effects on liver injury and cytokine production in vivo (biochemical markers of liver injury and cytokine levels in serum) and in vitro (cytokine and nitrite production in the cultures of splenocytes and peritoneal macrophages).Decoctions of component herbs, Artemisiae Capillari Spica (Artemisia capillaris Thunberg: 'Inchinko' in Japanese), Gardeniae Fructus (Gardenia jasminoides Ellis: 'Sanshishi') and Rhei Rhizoma (Rheum palmatum Linn\u00e9: 'Daio') were administered orally. Inchinko and Sanshishi decreased serum transaminases and IFN-gamma concentrations. Examination of fractions of component herbs suggested that capillarisin, a component of Inchinko, has potent hepatoprotective activity in vivo. In in vitro studies, capillarisin and genipin, an intestinal metabolite of geniposide that is contained in Sanshishi, were examined. IFN-gamma production was significantly suppressed by capillarisin and genipin in con A-stimulated splenocyte culture. Genipin also suppressed IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-12p70 synthesis. Capillarisin and genipin decreased nitrite release from IFN-gamma-stimulated macrophages.These results suggested that both Inchinko and Sanshishi may contribute to the protective effects of ICKT against con A hepatitis. Capillarisin was found to be potently hepatoprotective, and genipin may also contribute, especially via modulation of cytokine production.",

        "abstract": "Medications or dietary components can affect both the host and the host's gut microbiota. Changes in the microbiota may influence medication efficacy and interactions. Daikenchuto (TU-100), a herbal medication, comprised of ginger, ginseng, and Japanese pepper, is widely used in Japanese traditional Kampo medicine for intestinal motility and postoperative paralytic ileus. We previously showed in mice that consumption of TU-100 for 4 weeks changed the gut microbiota and increased bioavailability of bacterial ginsenoside metabolites. Since TU-100 is prescribed in humans for months to years, we examined the time- and sex-dependent effects of TU-100 on mouse gut microbiota. Oral administration of 1.5% TU-100 for 24 weeks caused more pronounced changes in gut microbiota in female than in male mice. Changes in both sexes largely reverted to baseline upon TU-100 withdrawal. Effects were time and dose dependent. The microbial profiles reverted to baseline within 4 weeks after withdrawal of 0.75% TU-100 but were sustained after withdrawal of 3% TU-100. In summary, dietary TU-100 changed mouse microbiota in a time-, sex-, and dose-dependent manner. These findings may be taken into consideration when determining optimizing dose for conditions of human health and disease with the consideration of differences in composition and response of the human intestinal microbiota.",

        "abstract": "A pharmaceutical grade Japanese traditional medicine, daikenchuto (TU-100), consisting of Japanese pepper, processed ginger, and ginseng, has been widely used for various intestinal disorders in Japan and now under development as a new therapeutic drug in the US. It is suggested that TU-100 ingredients exert pharmacological effects on intestines via two routes, from the luminal side before absorption and the peripheral blood stream after absorption. Therefore, in order to fully understand the pharmacological actions of TU-100, it is critically important to know the intraluminal amounts and forms of ingested TU-100 ingredients. In the present study, after administrating TU-100 to rats, the concentrations of TU-100 ingredients and their conjugates in the peripheral and portal blood and ileal contents were determined by LC-MS/MS. Next, TU-100 was administered to patients with ileostomy bags, but whose small intestines are diagnosed as healthy, and the ingredients/conjugates in the ileal effluent were analyzed. The results suggest that: (1) Pepper ingredients hydroxysanshools are rapidly absorbed and enter systemic circulation, (2) Ginseng ingredients ginsenosides are transported to the colon with the least absorption, (3) Ginger ingredients gingerols are absorbed and some conjugated in the small intestine and transported via the portal vein. While only a small amount of gingerols/gingerol conjugates enter systemic circulation, considerable amounts reappear in the small intestine. Thus, the effect of TU-100 on the intestines is believed to be a composite of multiple actions by multiple compounds supplied via multiple routes.",

        "abstract": "The chronic inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) in pregnant rats induces a pre-eclampsia-like syndrome, including hypertension. We have previously reported the beneficial effects of Toki-shakuyaku-san (TS) in this model. In the present study we demonstrated the anti-hypertensive effect of TS in pre-eclampsia produced by prolonged L-NAME-infusion during the postpartum period. Analysis of blood sex steroids suggested that the level of progesterone differs between the TS-effective (gestational day 19 and postpartum day 7) and TS-ineffective (postpartum day 1) periods. Co-administration of TS and progesterone inhibited L-NAME-induced hypertension on postpartum day 1. Furthermore, the anti-hypertensive effect of TS on postpartum day 6 disappeared in the presence of a co-administered progesterone antagonist mifepristone. These data suggest that a certain level of progesterone may be an indispensable prerequisite for an anti-hypertensive effect of TS. Finally, the effects of TS are apparently unrelated to blood levels of NO, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and endothelin-1, which have been reported to modulate systolic blood pressure in the L-NAME-induced pre-eclampsia model. Thus, the use of TS may provide a new therapeutic strategy for pre-eclampsia, although elucidation of the mechanism of action of TS would be necessary to optimize treatment protocols.",

        "abstract": "Major surgery is believed to contribute to immune dysregulation and high susceptibility to microbes. Recently, the inflammatory \"two-hit\" model has been accepted to elucidate development of multiple organ failure in surgical patients. Our purpose was to examine whether intestinal surgery, which causes a minor insult with no septic shock, may modify the immune response to exogenous LPS as a second stimulus.Using a rat intestinal transection and anastomosis surgery model, we sequentially examined blood cell counts, body temperatures, and plasma cytokines. Rats were administered with LPS intravenously or intratracheally various days after surgery. Phagocytic activity and TNFalpha production in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells, plasma cytokines, and survival rates were evaluated.The surgery itself caused no severe shock or circulating cytokine elevation, whereas the number of granulocytes in the blood was significantly elevated after surgery. LPS-induced elevation of circulating IFNgamma attenuated 3 days after surgery. In contrast, IL-10 was enhanced 3-10 days after surgery. Hyporesponsiveness of BAL cells to LPS was observed 3 days after surgery but not the next day after surgery. However, rats intratracheally exposed to LPS 10-13 days after surgery exhibited higher mortality.Although our surgical procedure was not supposed to be a severe insult, it sufficiently primed rats for an altered response to a second stimulus (endotoxin), which included enhanced mortality. This study provided an improved understanding of pathophysiological changes following surgery and described a useful model for developing preventive and therapeutic strategies for complications after surgery.",

        "abstract": "Kampo (Japanese traditional herbal) medicines are now ethically used in Japan as pharmaceutical grade prescription drugs. However, there are distinct groups of responders and non-responders to Kampo medicines. We searched for biomarker candidates to discriminate responders from non-responders to keishibukuryogan (KBG); one of the most frequently used Kampo medicines.A combination of SELDI technology and a decision tree analysis with proprietary developed bioinformatics tools was applied to 41 (32 for tree construction and 9 for validation test) plasma samples obtained from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. A candidate biomarker protein was identified using LC-MS/MS.The constructed tree with measurable reliability contained only a single peak which was identified as haptoglobin alpha 1 chain (Hpalpha1).Hpalpha1 is a biomarker candidate for discriminating responders from non-responders to KBG treatment for RA. The present results may open the way to the establishment of \"evidence-based\" complementary and alternative medicine.",

        "abstract": "'Oketsu' is a pathophysiologic concept in Japanese traditional (Kampo) medicine, primarily denoting blood stasis/stagnant syndrome. Here we have explored plasma protein biomarkers and/or diagnostic algorithms for 'Oketsu'. Sixteen rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients were treated with keishibukuryogan (KBG), a representative Kampo medicine for improving 'Oketsu'. Plasma samples were diagnosed as either having an 'Oketsu' (n = 19) or 'non-Oketsu' (n = 29) state according to Terasawa's 'Oketsu' scoring system. Protein profiles were obtained by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) and hierarchical clustering and decision tree analyses were performed. KBG treatment for 4 or 12 weeks decreased the 'Oketsu' scores significantly. SELDI protein profiles gave 266 protein peaks, whose expression was significantly different between the 'Oketsu' and 'non-Oketsu' states. Hierarchical clustering gave three major clusters (I, II, III). The majority (68.4%) of 'Oketsu' samples were clustered into one cluster as the principal component of cluster I. The remaining 'Oketsu' profiles constituted a minor component of cluster II and were all derived from patients cured of the 'Oketsu' state at 12 weeks. Construction of the decision tree addressed the possibility of developing a diagnostic algorithm for 'Oketsu'. A reduction in measurement/pre-processing conditions (from 55 to 16) gave a similar outcome in the clustering and decision tree analyses. The present study suggests that the pathophysiologic concept of Kampo medicine 'Oketsu' has a physical basis in terms of the profile of blood proteins. It may be possible to establish a set of objective criteria for diagnosing 'Oketsu' using a combination of proteomic and bioinformatics-based classification methods.",

Namely, instead of given information about modulus of scattering waves, we consider the information related to modulus of full fields, which consist of sums of incident and scattering fields. These full fields are the interference fields generated by point sources. We introduce a set of auxiliary point sources for solving the inverse problems and demonstrate that the corresponding data allow us to solve the inverse problems in a way similar to the case of measurements of scattering waves.",

Assuming that the refraction index   begin{document} $n(x)$ end{document}   is different from   begin{document} $1$ end{document}   only inside a bounded compact domain   begin{document} $\u03a9$ end{document}   with a smooth boundary   begin{document} $S$ end{document}   and the potential   begin{document} $q(x)$ end{document}   vanishes outside of the same domain, we study an inverse problem of finding both coefficients inside   begin{document} $\u03a9$ end{document}   from some given information on solutions of the elliptic equation. Namely, it is supposed that the point source located at point   begin{document} $y in S$ end{document}   is a variable parameter of the problem. Then for the solution   begin{document} $u(x,y,k)$ end{document}   of the above equation satisfying the radiation condition, we assume to be given the following phaseless information   begin{document} $f(x,y,k)=|u(x,y,k)|^2$ end{document}   for all   begin{document} $x,y in S$ end{document}   and for all   begin{document} $k\u2265 k_0u003e0$ end{document}  , where   begin{document} $k_0$ end{document}   is some constant.

        "abstract": "Abstract   In an embryonic developmental stage of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), Schwann cell precursors migrate along neuronal axons to their final destinations. After birth, they eventually wrap around individual axons to form myelin sheaths, which insulate axons to increase the nerve conduction velocity. Some growth factors and adhesion molecules are known to control these developmental stages from in the fish to in the mammal. Neuregulin-1 (NRG1), which is composed of many alternative splicing variants, is such a growth factor. Among these variants, the type III isoform of NRG1, interacting with ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors on Schwann cells, plays an essential role in myelination in the fish and the mammal. NRG1 type III is also known to promote migration of fish Schwann cell precursors; however, it still remains to be clarified whether mammalian type III isoform does it. We have therefore generated type III isoform-specific knockout mice in inbred strain. The mice result in delayed migration of the precursors from the dorsal to ventral root via a peripheral ganglion, comparing littermate controls. Similar results are observed in an  in\u00a0vitro  migration assay using reaggregated Schwann cell precursors. Furthermore, the knockout mice exhibit reduced myelin thickness, consistent with the established role of NRG1 type III in myelination. These results indicate that in mice, NRG1 type III plays a key role not only in myelination but also in migration.",

Although it covers the entire heart, provides uniform, high isotropic spatial resolution, and therefore may be useful for detecting small late iodine enhancement (LIE), we need to correctly differentiate small LIE and pseudo-lesions mimicking LIE. In this case report, we demonstrate basal septal perforator vein mimicking LIE in delayed phase cardiac CT. Left ventricular myocardium includes not only septal vein and artery but also capillaries, arterio- and venoluminal vessels, and sinusoids, etc. which connect to septal veins.

However, there is little information about predictor of cardiovascular outcome in ATTRm patients with long-term follow up. We analyzed clinical events and identified the predictive factors associated with poor outcome in Japanese patients with ATTRm. Methods and Results: This study included 81 consecutive ATTRm patients (56.7 \u00b1 13.7 years old) between July 1994 to September 2015. We evaluated incidence of clinical event defined as all cause death, hospitalization due to worsening heart failure (HF), implantation of cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D), implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), and pacemaker due to second or third degree atrioventricular block. During median follow up of 7.0 years, clinical event occurred in 21 patients (26%). Univariate cox regression analysis revealed that nonVal30Met mutation, duration of ATTRm, interventri...",

        "abstract": "Abnormal liver function test results are often observed in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). However, the prognostic value of bilirubin fractionation has not been elucidated. The prognostic value of direct bilirubin (DB), in comparison with total bilirubin (TB), was examined in 556 consecutive patients with ADHF. Patients with elevated DB showed mostly similar patient characteristics including signs of elevated right-sided pressure (frequent hepatomegaly, jugular venous distention, dilated inferior vena cava, and elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase) and decreased cardiac output (cold extremities, decreased pulse pressure, and lower blood pressure) and other parameters of heart failure (HF) severity (increased plasma renin activity, decreased sodium, total cholesterol, and ejection fraction) to elevated TB; however, only patients with elevated DB showed a significant difference in the frequency of HF history and alkaline phosphatase value. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with elevated DB had a significantly higher rate of the composite end point of all-cause mortality or HF readmission (p\u00a0= 0.021) compared with those with normal DB, whereas patients with elevated TB did not show a statistically significant difference compared with those with normal TB (NS). A multivariate Cox hazards model showed that DB was an independent predictor of adverse events (adjusted hazard ratio 1.052, 95% confidence interval 1.001 to 1.099, p\u00a0= 0.034), whereas TB was not (adjusted hazard ratio 1.017, 95% confidence interval 0.985 to 1.046, p\u00a0= 0.27). Adding DB to existing prognostic variables resulted in higher C-statistics than adding TB (C-statistics: 0.670 to 0.675, 0.670 to 0.674, respectively). In conclusion, elevated DB in ADHF was an independent prognostic predictor that was superior to TB. DB may be useful for further risk stratification in ADHF.",

The clarification of pathologic mechanisms underlying the myocardial infarction case could provide information about pathophysiology of atherosclerotic development in anomalous left circumflex coronary artery, and could help in decision-making regarding the management strategy. < Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging indicated that ordinary atherosclerosis could develop at retroaortic anomalous course of left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) despite absence of mechanical cause of ischemia. IVUS screening could provide significant information about pathophysiology of atherosclerotic development in anomalous LCX, and could help in decision-making regarding the management strategy. The images and discussion have high educational value for clinical cardiologists alike.>.",

        "abstract": "We herein report a case of Werner's syndrome (WS) with cardiac syndrome X (CSX) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), receiving nicorandil treatment. A 58-year-old woman with chest discomfort on exercise was suspected of having effort-angina pectoris because of broad ST-depression in electrocardiogram of exercise test and reversible defect in the posterior-wall portion of left ventricle in exercise thallium myocardial scintigraphy. This patient also exhibited HFpEF, diagnosed by increased ratio of early-transmitral-flow-velocity to tissue-Doppler early-diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/e') in echocardiography and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. However, coronary angiography revealed no organic stenosis in epicardial coronary arteries, and coronary physiological measurements by PressureWire\u2122 (St. Jude Medical, St Paul, MN, USA) demonstrated that coronary flow reserve (CFR) was greatly decreased. Because impaired CFR represents coronary microvascular dysfunction in the absence of obstructive coronary narrowing, we diagnosed CSX, and initiated the administration of nicorandil to improve coronary microcirculation. After three-month-treatment of nicorandil, the patient's symptoms were diminished, and reversible defect in exercise myocardial scintigraphy was improved. Furthermore, both E/e' and BNP were decreased, indicating the improvement of HFpEF via the restoration of microvascular dysfunction. Thus, nicorandil administration could bring beneficial effects in WS with CSX and HFpEF, accompanied by coronary microcirculation dysfunction. < Contrary to previous case reports regarding Werner's syndrome (WS) with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), we herein report a case of WS with cardiac syndrome X (CSX) without obstructive CAD, complicated with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Because impaired coronary microcirculation is known to be associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and HFpEF, nicorandil could improve not only CSX but HFpEF via the restoration of coronary microvascular dysfunction.>.",

In this model, microscopic preneoplastic foci emerge in the early stage and subsequently progress into adenomas, from which hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is finally developed. We detected the BrafV637E mutation, that is correspondent to the human BrafV600E mutation, in 4/4 DEN-induced hepatic tumors at 13 months after DEN treatment by whole exome analysis, and further in 16/17 (94.1%) late tumors by the PCR-direct sequencing method. By microdissection, the BrafV637E mutation was also detected in 16/18 (88.8%) and 22/28 (78.5%) microscopic lesions (preneoplastic foci and microadenomas) respectively at 5 and 8-9 months after DEN treatment. Meanwhile, although the BrafV637E mutation was detected in 5/7 (71.4%) hepatic tumors induced by neonatal DEN treatment followed by repeated CCl4 administration, it was not found in 24 hepatic tumors induced by CCl4 alone and 6 spontaneous hepatic tumors in B6C3F1 mice, indicating that the BrafV637E mutation is specific to the DEN-initiated hepatic tumors, presumably being derived from the genotoxic action of DEN. The DEN-induced tumors showed hyperphosphorylation of MEK and ERK1/2, indicating that the BrafV637E mutation activated the downstream MAPK pathway. Furthermore, the DEN-induced tumors overexpressed the pro-survival/pro-proliferative cytokines/chemokines such as complement C5/C5a, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM-1), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and chemokine CXCL9 as well as the oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) markers, p15Ink4b and p19Arf mRNAs, suggesting that the BrafV637E mutation might influence the gene expression that is involved either in cellular growth/survival or OIS. Transgenic mice expressing BrafV637E specifically in the liver under the control of albumin promoter showed enlarged hepatic mass as large as 4-5 times of normal liver, and whole liver was consisted of small basophilic hepatocytes resembling the cells in the early preneoplastic lesions induced by neonatal treatment with DEN. These results indicate that the BrafV637E mutation plays a pivotal role in the DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.Citation Format: Masahiro Yamamoto, Hiroki Tanaka, Xin Bing, Yuji Nishikawa, Kohsuke Yamazaki, Keiko Shimizu, Katsuhiro Ogawa.

        "abstract": "Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) is often used to induce hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents to investigate the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). BrafV637E mutation, corresponding to the human BRAFV600E mutation, is highly frequent in DEN-induced hepatic tumors depending on mouse strains.  To investigate the role of BrafV637E mutation in DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, we established the transgenic mice (Alb-Cre/BRAFV600E), in which human BRAFV600E mutation is specifically expressed in the liver, and compared the properties of DEN-induced hepatic tumors and the livers of the transgenic mice. The hepatic tumors were induced by neonatal treatment with DEN, isolated at various time points, and stored as frozen or paraffin-embedded materials. For production of the transgenic mice, we obtained homozygous male BRAFV600E mice, in which a LoxP-flanked cassette containing the human BRAF exons 15-18 cDNA, mouse polyadenilation sequences and the neo gene was inserted into the mouse Braf intron 14 upstream of the human BRAF exon 15 cDNA that encodes the BRAFV600E mutation, and crossed them with female Alb-Cre mice by in vitro fertilization.  RT-PCR and cDNA sequencing revealed that the liver of Alb-Cre/BRAFV600E mice expressed mRNA derived both from normal mouse and mutated human BRAF exon 15. The transgenic mice showed 20% decrease in body weight compared to normal mice, but 5 fold-increase in the liver/body weight. Histological examination revealed that the liver was entirely consisted of basophilic hepatocytes resembling to those in DEN-induced foci of cellular alteration at 8 weeks of birth, and bile duct cells were further increased at 10-12 weeks. The Ki-67 labeling index of hepatocytes in the Alb-Cre/BRAFV600E mice was 3 times higher than normal mice. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the liver of Alb-Cre/BRAFV600E mice expressed the BRAFV600E protein and showed hyperphosphlylation of ERK1 and AktS473 like the DEN-induced hepatic tumors. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining detected increased C5/C5a expression in the hepatocytes of Alb-Cre/BRAFV600E mice, and by immunoblot analysis C5a, a protease-cleaved form of C5, was specifically detected in Alb-Cre/BRAFV600E liver like DEN-induced tumors. These results indicate that the liver specific expression of mutationally-activated BRAF led to the hepatocytic phenotype mimicking the DEN-induced hepatic tumors.

        "abstract": "The BrafV637E mutation, which corresponds to the human BRAFV600E mutation, plays a pivotal role in mouse hepatic carcinogenesis induced by neonatal treatment with diethylnitrosamine in B6C3F1 mice. We previously established the transgenic mice that express the human BRAFV600E mutation in the liver (Mol Carcinog 2016. doi:10.1002/mc22510). The transgenic mice showed 5 folds increase in liver/body weight as compared to normal mice, and their liver was entirely consisted of small basophilic hepatocytes resembling DEN-induced preneoplastic hepatocytes. The transgenic mice were normally born, but most of them spontaneously died during 2-3 months after birth. In this study, we investigated the reason for spontaneous death in the liver-specific BRAFV600E transgenic mice. The numbers of platelets and megakaryocytes were remarkably increased respectively in peripheral blood and bone marrow in the transgenic mice. Furthermore, fragmented red blood cells and activated platelets with enlarged size were frequently observed in the peripheral blood smear of the transgenic mice. Thrombopoietin mRNA was abundantly expressed in the liver of transgenic mice, and the conditioned-medium of the cultured hepatocytes from the transgenic mice contained increased amount of thrombopoietin as compared with that of normal mouse hepatocytes. Histopathological analysis revealed that many platelets were adhered to the sinusoidal walls in the liver of the transgenic mice. Furthermore, glomerulonephritis associating with platelet deposition in glomerular capillaries and interstitial pneumonia accompanying microthrombosis in alveolar capillaries were also observed. Because platelets have been shown to promote liver regeneration through interaction with various hepatic cell components such as hepatocytes, endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, the platelet accumulation in the liver of the transgenic mice may represent the stimulation for growth and proliferation of hepatocytes by platelets. On the other hand, the platelets might cause the renal and pulmonary diseases which might cause spontaneous death in these mice. Our results indicate that over-production of thrombopoietin by the BRAF-mutated hepatocytes may create the macroenvironment that may favor the growth and proliferation of neoplastic hepatocytes.(Supported by the grant from Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.)

        "abstract": "In hepatocarcinogenesis induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) treatment in neonatal B6C3F1 mice, the BrafV637E mutation, corresponding to the human BRAFV600E mutation, plays a pivotal role. We produced the transgenic mice expressing human BRAFV600E mutation specifically in hepatocytes by using the albumin-cre method. The Alb-Cre/BRAFV600E transgenic mice showed the enlarged liver whose weight was five times as large as that of normal mice, and the liver entirely consisted of small basophilic hepatocytes resembling the DEN-induced preneoplastic hepatocytes. Although these transgenic mice were healthy after birth, they spontaneously died showing renal and pulmonary diseases. In the transgenic mice, the liver showed thrombopoietin (TPO) overexpression, which is associated with eventual megakaryocytosis/thrombocytosis, and platelets were found activated in the peripheral blood and deposited in hepatic sinusoids. Simultaneous staining for CD61/CD31 or CD61/F4-80 revealed that platelets were sparsely adhered to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and densely adhered to and incorporated into Kupffer cells. Because the interaction of podoplanin with C-type lectin receptor 2 (CLEC-2) on platelet membranes is an important mechanism to reciprocally activate platelets and the podoplanin-expressing cells, we investigated whether podoplanin is expressed in any of the hepatic cell components in the transgenic mice. Simultaneous staining for podoplanin and F4-80 revealed that podoplanin was expressed in some of the Kupffer cells, indicating that the platelet activation occurred via the interaction of podoplanin on Kupffer cell membrans with C-type lectin receptor 2 (CLEC-2) on the platelet membrane. Additionally, glomerulonephropathy and interstitial pneumonia associated with platelet deposition were observed. Because platelets contribute growth/survival of hepatocytes by activating hepatic sinusoidal cells and directly hepatocytes via releasing various factors, interaction of platelets with hepatic sinusoidal cells was considered to promote the growth/survival of BRAF mutated hepatocytes. Furthermore, podoplanin expression in part of Kupffer cells in the transgenic mice was an important mechanism for platelet activation in the transgenic mice. On the other hand, the aberrant platelet activation was thought to cause glomerulonephropathy and interstitial pneumonia and led to spontaneous death in some of the transgenic mice.

        "abstract": "Cyclin D1 overexpression is a frequent change in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Our present study demonstrated that cyclin D1 overexpression with abundant cyclin E, cdk4, cdk2, and p27Kip1 (p27) occurred in neoplastic hepatocytes from the early stage of mouse hepatocarcinogenesis. While cyclin D1 expression was mainly found in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells, it shifted to the nucleus in association with cell proliferation after the animals were subjected to a partial hepatectomy (PH), and then returned once more to the cytoplasm when the cells became quiescent. Inhibition of PI3 kinase (PI3K) by Ly294002 in mouse HCC cells in vitro suppressed the nuclear shift of cyclin D1 as well as cell proliferation, while PI3K activation by PTEN suppression failed to induce nuclear shift of cyclin D1, suggesting that PI3K activation is essential but not sufficient for the cyclin D1 nuclear shift. While MEK-ERK1/2 inhibition by PD98059 and mTOR inhibition by rapamycin affected the cyclin D1 nuclear shift and cell proliferation to a lesser extent, both these inhibitors reduced cyclin D1 levels. Finally, although p27, cdk4 and calmodulin (CaM) were detected in the cyclin D1 immunoprecipitates from both quiescent and proliferating HCC cells, Hsc70 and SSeCKS were detected only in the immunoprecipitate from quiescent cells, and p21Waf1/Cip1 (p21) was detected only in that from proliferating cells, suggesting that the cyclin D1 complex is different in quiescent and proliferating cells. These observations indicate that the nuclear/cytoplasmic localization of cyclin D1 plays an important role in the proliferation/quiescence of neoplastic hepatocytes.",

        "abstract": "Activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT, Yes-associated protein (YAP), and MYC pathways is involved in human liver cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC). However, the nature of the interactions among these pathways has remained poorly understood. Herein, we demonstrate the coordination of these pathways during the formation of mouse liver tumors induced by hepatocyte-specific somatic integration of myristoylated AKT, mutant YAP, Myc, or their combinations. Although the introduction of YAP or Myc alone was inefficient in inducing tumors, these proteins accelerated tumorigenesis induced by AKT. The generated tumors demonstrated various histological features: low-grade HCC by AKT/Myc, CC by AKT/YAP, and high-grade HCC by AKT/Myc/YAP. CC induced by AKT/YAP was associated with activation of the Notch pathway. Interestingly, the combination of Myc and YAP generated tumors composed of hepatoblast/stem-like cells expressing mRNA for Afp, Dlk1, Nanog, and Sox2 and occasionally forming immature ducts. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that human HCC and CC were predominantly associated with phosphorylation of S6 and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2, respectively, and >60% of CC cases were positive for both phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase--3\u03b2 and YAP. Our study suggests that hepatocyte-derived tumors demonstrate a wide spectrum of tumor phenotypes, including HCC, CC, and hepatoblastoma-like, through the combinatory effects of the oncogenic pathways and that the state of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT pathway is a key determinant of differentiation.",

Therefore, in searching for new therapeutic targets, adequate mouse models to develop and validate therapeutic strategies are urgently needed.

To overcome these shortcomings, a mouse model using a hydrodynamic tail vein injection and the Sleeping Beauty transposon was developed. By inducing stable expression of oncogenes in mouse hepatocytes in vivo, the model can easily induce liver cancer with specific characteristics that depend on the oncogenes used to induce carcinogenesis.

        "abstract": "Proceedings: AACR 106th Annual Meeting 2015; April 18-22, 2015; Philadelphia, PAActivation of the Hippo-Yap pathway and c-Myc is known to be involved in human liver tumors, either hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In liver-specific mouse knockouts of negative regulators of the Hippo-Yap pathway, such as Nf2 or Sav, both HCC and CC could have been induced, while the activation of c-Myc has been suggested to be involved in HCC development and activation of stem-like potential of hepatocytic tumor cells. Although an interaction of the Hippo-Yap pathway and c-Myc has been suggested in human HCC cell lines, the precise nature of the interaction in hepatocarcinogenesis is not clear. In the present study, we examined the roles of the Hippo-Yap pathway and c-Myc in mouse liver tumor models, in which, along with the active Akt (myrAkt) gene, the active Yap (YapS127A) gene and/or the c-Myc gene were introduced into hepatocytes in vivo through hydrodynamic tail vein injection and the Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated somatic integration. Introduction of myrAkt alone induced multinodular liver tumors 9 months after transfection. The individual tumors showed various histologic features: HCC with ductular differentiation, HCC, and CC in order of frequency. Cotransfection of either YapS127A or Myc demonstrated tumor promoting activities with macroscopically evident liver tumors being developed after 6 to 8 weeks. The histology of tumors induced by myrAkt/YapS127A was CK19-positive ductule-forming adenocarcinoma reminiscent of CC. In contrast, the tumor induced by myrAkt/c-Myc showed typical histology of moderately differentiated HCC without CK19 expression. When all (myrAkt/YapS127A/c-Myc) were simultaneously introduced, marked hepatomegaly due to diffuse liver tumors was apparent even after 2 to 3 weeks. Histologically, the livers were replaced by poorly differentiated HCC or undifferentiated carcinoma. Although there were scattered foci of CK19-positive tumor cells, no apparent tubular structures were noted. RT-qPCR analyses revealed that the mRNA expression of genes involved in Notch signaling (Jag1, Hes1, and Hes2), Ctgf, and Tnf was significantly increased in myrAkt/YapS127A-induced tumors, but not in tumors induced by myrAkt/c-Myc or myrAkt/YapS127A/Myc. In conclusion, while both the Hippo-Yap pathway and c-Myc enhance hepatocarcinogenesis, the activation of the former induces ductular differentiation in hepatocytic tumors generating a CC-like phenotype, whereas the latter suppresses the transdifferentiation and maintains hepatocytic features.Citation Format: Masahiro Yamamoto, Bing Xin, Xi Chen, Kiyonaga Fujii, Takako Ooshio, Yuji Nishikawa.

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually associated with chronic liver injury, typically cirrhosis, although it could be developed in apparenty intact livers. To explore the tumorigenetic mechanisms underlying these different conditions, we compared mRNA expression profiles in mouse liver tumors induced by repeated injections of CCl4 (cirrhotic protocol) and a single diethylnitrosamine (DEN) injection at 2-week-old (non-cirrhotic protocol) using a cDNA microarray. In the CCl4 model, numerous small tumors appeared in cirrhotic liver parenchyma, while in the DEN model, multiple large tumors developed in a non-cirrhotic background. We identified tumor-specific genes that were differentially expressed in either CCl4 or DEN model, as well as expressed in both models. The levels and patterns of mRNA expression of these genes were verified by RT-qPCR analyses. The mRNA expression of Igf2, H19, Krt20, and Cbr3 were predominantly increased in CCl4 tumors; that of Gpc3, Tff3, Akr1c18, Afp, and Abcd2 were predominantly increased in DEN tumors; that of Ly6d, Cpe, Slpi, and Scd2 was increased at similar levels in CCl4 and DEN tumors. The mRNA expresion of Igf2bp3, which is known to be functionally correlated with Igf2, was also increased only in CCl4 tumors. A positive correlation was found between the expression of Igf2 mRNA and H19 mRNA. The mRNA expresion of these liver tumor-specific genes was not significantly correlated with the proliferative activity of tumor cells, as estimated by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry, either in CCl4 or DEN tumors. Interestingly, all of these genes, with only exception being Cbr3, were highly expressed in the mouse livers during the fetal/neonatal periods. We also examined mRNA expression of these genes in liver tumors induced by chronic thioacetamide (TAA) treatment, another cirrhotic liver tumor protocol, and found that TAA-induced tumors shared a similar pattern of expression profile as that of CCl4 tumors. We further investigated mRNA expression of the genes in mouse liver tumors induced by the Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated somatic integration of active Akt (myrAkt) and mutant Hras (HrasV12) genes. Hydrodynamic tail vein injection of the oncogenes rapidly induced multiple liver tumors within 2 months without developing chronic liver injury or cirrhosis. These tumors overexpressed most of the above genes, except for Igf2, Igfbp3, H19, and Tff3. Our results show that mouse liver tumors reactivate numerous fetal/neonatal genes, some of which are specific to the cirrhotic (e.g., Igf2) and non-cirrhotic (e.g., Gpc3, Tff3, Akr1c18) modes of pathogenesis. Furthermore, the IGF2 axis, H19, and Tff3 might be specifically involved in the processes during the development of liver tumors, not simply reflecting neoplastic transformation of hepatocytes.

        "abstract": "Activation of c-Myc plays an important role in many biological processes, including cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis and energy metabolism. Overexpression of c-Myc has been observed in human hepatocellular carcinoma, with an inverse correlation between its expression levels and prognosis of the patients. It has been reported in a mouse model that liver-specific overexpression of c-Myc induces hepatocellular carcinoma, while its subsequent inactivation leads to tumor regression, suggesting that c-Myc expression might be important in hepatocarcinogenesis, as well as maintenance of the liver tumors. In this study, we explored the role of c-Myc in mouse liver tumor models using the Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated gene integration. The activated Akt (myrAkt), mutant Hras (HrasV12), and c-Myc genes were introduced in various combinations into mouse hepatocytes in vivo through hydrodynamic tail vein injection. When myrAkt and HrasV12 were injected simultaneously, multiple tumors developed after 6 to 8 weeks. During the rapid hepatocarcinogeneis, preneoplastic cells with abundant cytoplasmic lipid transformed into less fatty and more proliferative tumor cells. c-Myc immunohistochemistry revealed that fatty preneplastic hepatocytes were negative, while some of the highly proliferative tumor cells were positive, indicating that secondary activation of c-Myc and altered lipid metabolism might be involved in the neoplastic transformation in this model. We then investigated the effects of introduction of c-Myc into hepatocytes. Although the injection of c-Myc alone was insufficient to induce tumor formation, the combination of c-Myc and myrAkt induced multinodular tumors within 8 weeks. In the early preneoplastic lesions (4 weeks), cells contained various amounts of cytoplasmic lipid, with a tendency that less fatty cells were more proliferative. Fully developed tumors after 8 weeks were composed of thick trabecular arrangements of highly proliferative hepatocyte-like tumor cells with plump nuclei containing prominent nucleoli, characteristically devoid of cytoplasmic lipid, compatible with moderately hepatocellular carcinoma. When c-Myc was introduced with myrAkt and HrasV12, multiple liver tumors developed quite rapidly as early as 2 weeks. The tumors showed the histology of poorly differentiated HCC without lipid accumulation. The cells in the earliest preneoplastic lesions found after 1 week contained only a small amount of cytoplasmic lipid. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that c-Myc facilitates hepatocarcinogenesis and suggest that there might be a link between altered lipid metabolism and proliferation of hepatocytic tumor cells.

        "abstract": "MYC activation at modest levels has been frequently found in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its significance in hepatocarcinogenesis has remained obscure. Here we examined the role of Myc activation in mouse liver tumours induced by hepatocytic expression of myristoylated AKT (AKT) and/or mutant HRAS (HRAS) via transposon-mediated gene integration. AKT or HRAS alone required 5 months to induce liver tumours, whereas their combination generated hepatocellular carcinoma within 8 weeks. Co-introduction of AKT and HRAS induced lipid-laden preneoplastic cells that grew into nodules composed of tumour cells with or without intracytoplasmic lipid, with the latter being more proliferative and associated with spontaneous Myc expression. AKT/HRAS-induced tumorigenesis was almost completely abolished when MadMyc, a competitive Myc inhibitor, was expressed simultaneously. The Tet-On induction of MadMyc in preneoplastic cells significantly inhibited the progression of AKT/HRAS-induced tumours; its induction in transformed cells suppressed their proliferative activity with alterations in lipid metabolism and protein translation. Transposon-mediated Myc overexpression facilitated tumorigenesis by AKT or HRAS, and when it was co-introduced with AKT and HRAS, diffusely infiltrating tumours without lipid accumulation developed as early as 2 weeks. Examination of the dose-responses of Myc in the enhancement of AKT/HRAS-induced tumorigenesis revealed that a reduction to one-third retained enhancing effect but three-times greater introduction damped the process with increased apoptosis. Myc overexpression suppressed the mRNA expression of proteins involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, and when combined with HRAS introduction, it also suppressed the mRNA expression of proteins involved in their degradation. Finally, the MYC-positive human hepatocellular carcinoma was characterized by the cytoplasm devoid of lipid accumulation, prominent nucleoli and a higher proliferative activity. Our results demonstrate that in hepatocarcinogenesis induced by both activated AKT and HRAS, activation of endogenous Myc is an enhancing factor and adequate levels of Myc deregulation further facilitate the process with alterations in cellular metabolism.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma often reactivates the genes that are transiently expressed in fetal or neonatal livers. However, the mechanism of their activation has not been elucidated. To explore how oncogenic signaling pathways could be involved in the process, we examined the expression of fetal/neonatal genes in liver tumors induced by the introduction of myristoylated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene (AKT), HRas proto-oncogene, guanosine triphosphatase (HRAS), and MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor (Myc), in various combinations, into mouse hepatocytes . Distinct sets of fetal/neonatal genes were activated in HRAS- and HRAS/Myc-induced tumors: aldo-keto reductase family 1, member C18 (), glypican 3 (), carboxypeptidase E (), adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette, subfamily D, member 2 (), and trefoil factor 3 () in the former; insulin-like growth factor 2 messenger RNA binding protein 3 (), alpha fetoprotein (), , and H19, imprinted maternally expressed transcript () in the latter. Interestingly, HRAS/Myc-induced tumors comprised small cells with a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of delta-like noncanonical Notch ligand 1 (), Nanog homeobox (), and sex determining region Y-box 2 (). Both HRAS- and HRAS/Myc-induced tumors showed decreased DNA methylation levels of  and  differentially methylated region 1 and increased nuclear accumulation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, suggesting a state of global DNA hypomethylation. HRAS/Myc-induced tumors were characterized by an increase in the mRNA expression of enzymes involved in DNA methylation (DNA methyltransferase [, ]) and demethylation (ten-eleven-translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 []), sharing similarities with the fetal liver. Although mouse hepatocytes could be transformed by the introduction of HRAS/Myc , they did not express fetal/neonatal genes and sustained global DNA methylation, suggesting that the epigenetic alterations were influenced by the  microenvironment. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that human hepatocellular carcinoma cases with nuclear MYC expression were more frequently positive for AFP, IGF2, and DLK1 compared with MYC-negative tumors.  The HRAS signaling pathway and its interactions with the Myc pathway appear to reactivate fetal/neonatal gene expression in hepatocytic tumors partly through epigenetic alterations, which are dependent on the tumor microenvironment.",

Data collected through a Web survey of a U.S. national online panel (N = 1201) reveal that the relationships of ICSN with offline and online civic participation are conditioned by locality-oriented expressive uses of Internet and mobile media. With these findings, this study discusses theoretical insights, policy implications, and practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Based on an integrated approach to media use, this study examines the association between integrated news use and civic participation in the networked digital media environment. Data from a web survey of a national online panel demonstrate that integrated news use, or the degree to which various media platforms are integrated for news consumption, is positively associated with civic participation. Data also show that integrated political discussion and integrated political information seeking mediate the relationship between integrated news use and civic participation. This study discusses theoretical and methodological implications.",

Specifically, the entire collection investigates how digital media use and civic engagement can be conceptualized, operationalized, and theorized in the current digital media environment. The seven studies further examine how the use of traditional and newer forms of media influences civic engagement across communities of places, interests, and practices as well as different social groups at the local and global levels. With an interest in social conditions and contexts surrounding the civic utility of digital media, this special issue brings a unique perspective to the existing scholarship and provides new venues for continued scholarly attention to this important subject.",

Patterns related to those dimensions that may impact editors\u2019 conceptions of the phenomenon at the individual and organizational levels are examined. A total of 10 core ideas emerged in the aggregate discussion, but a majority of the participants defined the concept simplistically focusing on one- or two-dimensional definitions. Arguments from journalistic professionalism (occupational roles), audience engagement/collaboration (normative values), and behavioral practices are represented. This article discusses the extent to which citizen journalism is defined and guided by demographic variables, individual journalistic experience, and organizational characteristics.",

This study positions communication characterized by weak ties as a social mechanism linking neighborhood walkability with physical exercise.

Frequency of weak-tie communication is related positively to perceived social cohesion and negatively to anonymity, both of which are significantly related to frequency of physical exercise in the neighborhood.

An analysis of data from a probability-based mail survey of registered voters (N = 319) in Guam revealed that conflict avoidance is inversely associated with political participation, civic engagement, and attention to interpersonal sources of information on a political issue. An inverse relationship between conflict avoidance and attention to the Internet as a source of information on a political issue was also approaching statistical significance. However, conflict avoidance was not associated with neighborliness. Implications are discussed.",

        "abstract": "This study tests the role of second screening during election news consumption in factual political knowledge. Data from an online survey conducted before the 2016\u00a0U.S. presidential election show that task-irrelevant second screening during election news consumption on television is negatively related to factual political knowledge, whereas the influence of task-relevant second screening is positive. Data also show that the relationships between task-relevant and task-irrelevant second screening and factual political knowledge are moderated by how much attention one pays to election news on television.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the role of attitudinal ambivalence in moderating the effects of junk food advertisements on behavioral intentions by tapping different facets of this construct-felt ambivalence, potential ambivalence, and affective-cognitive ambivalence. Results based on an online survey of college students indicate that attention to junk food advertisements has an indirect positive effect on intentions to eat junk food through its positive effect on attitudes toward junk food. A moderated mediation model reveals that this indirect effect of junk food advertisements is weakened as respondents' levels of felt ambivalence increase. This moderating role is not observed for the measures of potential ambivalence and affective-cognitive ambivalence. Implications are discussed for health interventions. ",

        "abstract": "The risk of atrial fibrillation (AF)-related stroke is usually assessed by calculating the CHA2DS2-VASc score, the components of which are various risk factors, including prior stroke. Although prior stroke is considered the strongest risk factor, the associated risk is actually inferred. Nevertheless, it implies a \"freedom-from-event effect\" (FEE)-the longer a patient is stroke-free, the lower the stroke risk. Although dynamic prognostication has been applied to cancer, the FEE has been ignored in AF, probably because of methodological difficulties. We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the FEE in the risk of AF-related stroke. We modeled various populations of AF patients and simulated the development of stroke assuming a nonhomogeneous Poisson process, where the hazard depends on age, comorbidities, and individual variability. Parameters were set so that the model respects the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring scheme and reproduces the 1-year CHA2DS2-VASc score-wise stroke risk and relative risk conferred by real-world risk factors. We tracked stroke risk over 0 to 15 years of freedom-from-stroke time (FST), both prospective FST (pFST), which begins at the time of diagnosis and continues to the future, and retrospective FST (rFST), which begins at the present and looks backward to the time of diagnosis. The pFST counterbalanced the increase in stroke risk conferred by aging; in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1, the pFST offset 62% of the age-conferred risk increase. The rFST reduced the stroke risk; in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 and without prior stroke, an rFST of 6.8 years reduced the stroke risk to the midpoint between CHA2DS2-VASc scores 1 and 2. The study results suggest that the FEE should be considered in evaluating stroke risk in patients with AF. The FEE may be important in other recurrent diseases for which a prior event is a risk factor for a future event.",

        "abstract": "\u3000In order to characterize the adhesion and deformation behavior between chitosan-modified liposomes and the mucin layer of the small intestine, mucin was coated on hydrophobic surface-modified carbon nanotube (CNT) probe of an atomic force microscope. The interaction between this mucin layer and the liposomes with or without chitosan modification in phosphoric acid buffer solution was determined by atomic force microscopy. The pH of the buffer solution was controlled at 2.8 and 7.0. The chitosan modification increased the attractive force between the liposomes and mucin layer during the separation process under both pH conditions. This result corresponded with that from a previous study about the liposome adhesion behavior on the surface of the small intestine of rats. By using the mucin-coated CNT probe, the long range and different types of attractive forces between the chitosan-modified liposomes and mucin layer was observed. Furthermore, the small-scaled deformation behavior change on the liposomal surfaces due to chitosan modification was also observed by the CNT probe. The detail deformation and adhesion behavior of the liposomes with or without chitosan modification was detected.",

        "abstract": "Survival of deep-sea Calyptogena clams depends on organic carbon produced by symbiotic, sulfur-oxidizing, autotrophic bacteria present in the epithelial cells of the gill. To understand the mechanism underlying this symbiosis, the development of a long-term cultivation system is essential. We cultivated specimens of Calyptogena okutanii in an artificial chemosynthetic aquarium with a hydrogen sulfide (H2S) supply system provided by the sulfate reduction of dog food buried in the sediment. We studied morphological and histochemical changes in the clams' gills by immunohistochemical and energy-dispersive X-ray analyses. The freshly collected clams contained a high amount of elemental sulfur in the gill epithelial cells, as well as densely packed symbiotic bacteria. Neither elemental sulfur nor symbiotic bacteria was detected in any other organs except the ovaries, where symbiotic bacteria, but not sulfur, was detected. The longest survival of an individual clam in this aquarium was 151 days. In the 3 clams dissected on Days 57 and 91 of the experiment, no elemental sulfur was detected in the gills. The symbiotic bacteria content had significantly decreased by Day 57, and was absent by Day 91. For comparison, we also studied the deep-sea mussel Bathymodiolus septemdierum, which harbors a phylogenetically close, sulfur-oxidizing, symbiotic bacterium with similar sulfur oxidation pathways. Sulfur particles were not detected, even in the gills of the freshly collected mussels. We discuss the importance of the proportion of available H2S and oxygen to the bivalves for elemental sulfur accumulation. Storage of nontoxic elemental sulfur, an energy source, seems to be an adaptive strategy of C. okutanii.",

        "abstract": "Symbiont transmission is a key event for understanding the processes underlying symbiotic associations and their evolution. However, our understanding of the mechanisms of symbiont transmission remains still fragmentary. The deep-sea clam Calyptogena okutanii harbours obligate sulfur-oxidizing intracellular symbiotic bacteria in the gill epithelial cells. In this study, we determined the localization of their symbiont associating with the spawned eggs, and the population size of the symbiont transmitted via the eggs. We show that the symbionts are located on the outer surface of the egg plasma membrane at the vegetal pole, and that each egg carries approximately 400 symbiont cells, each of which contains close to 10 genomic copies. The very small population size of the symbiont transmitted via the eggs might narrow the bottleneck and increase genetic drift, while polyploidy and its transient extracellular lifestyle might slow the rate of genome reduction. Additionally, the extracellular localization of the symbiont on the egg surface may increase the chance of symbiont exchange. This new type of extracellular transovarial transmission provides insights into complex interactions between the host and symbiont, development of both host and symbiont, as well as the population dynamics underlying genetic drift and genome evolution in microorganisms.

Difficulty in maintaining Phreagena clams in rearing tanks has been a major obstacle to achieving a better understanding of their unique biology. To improve the method of rearing Phreagena clams, here we reared them in an artificial chemosynthetic aquarium and evaluated the effects of the aquarium system on long-term clam rearing. We compared the survival of clams reared in the artificial chemosynthetic tank with the survival of those in the normal tank, and analyzed the symbiont abundance using semi-quantification of fluorescent in situ hybridization signals. Our results indicate that the artificial chemosynthetic aquarium system had specific effects on symbiont abundance and possibly on host survival. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopic observations of sulfur globules in the symbiont cells and expression analyses of the dsrA gene of the symbiont indicated that stocked elemental sulfur could be consumed as an energy source to reduce sulfide shortages. We discuss the importance of higher and more stable sulfide concentrations and the proportions of available O2 and CO2 in driving appropriate metabolic functions of the symbiont and improving the survival of the clams.",

        "title": "Comparative Analysis of Microbial Communities in Iron-Dominated Flocculent Mats in Deep Sea Hydrothermal Environments",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT  It has been suggested that iron is one of the most important energy sources for photosynthesis-independent microbial ecosystems in the ocean crust. Iron-metabolizing chemolithoautotrophs play a key role as primary producers, but little is known about their distribution and diversity and their ecological role as submarine iron-metabolizing chemolithotrophs, particularly the iron oxidizers. In this study, we investigated the microbial communities in several iron-dominated flocculent mats found in deep-sea hydrothermal fields in the Mariana Volcanic Arc and Trough and the Okinawa Trough by culture-independent molecular techniques and X-ray mineralogical analyses. The abundance and composition of the 16S rRNA gene phylotypes demonstrated the ubiquity of zetaproteobacterial phylotypes in iron-dominated mat communities affected by hydrothermal fluid input. Electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis revealed the chemical and mineralogical signatures of biogenic Fe-(oxy)hydroxide species and the potential contribution of Zetaproteobacteria to the  in situ  generation. These results suggest that putative iron-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophs play a significant ecological role in producing iron-dominated flocculent mats and that they are important for iron and carbon cycles in deep-sea low-temperature hydrothermal environments.   IMPORTANCE  We report novel aspects of microbiology from iron-dominated flocculent mats in various deep-sea environments. In this study, we examined the relationship between Zetaproteobacteria and iron oxides across several hydrothermally influenced sites in the deep sea. We analyzed iron-dominated mats using culture-independent molecular techniques and X-ray mineralogical analyses. The scanning electron microscopy\u2013energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy SEM-EDS analysis and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis revealed chemical and mineralogical signatures of biogenic Fe-(oxy)hydroxide species as well as the potential contribution of the zetaproteobacterial population to the  in situ  production. These key findings provide important information for understanding the mechanisms of both geomicrobiological iron cycling and the formation of iron-dominated mats in deep-sea hydrothermal fields.",

        "abstract": "W\u00e4chtersh\u00e4user's proposal of the autotrophic origin of life theory and subsequent laboratory demonstrations of relevant organic reactions have opened a new gate for the exploration of the origin of life. However, this scenario remains controversial because, at present, it requires a high pressure of CO as a source of carbon and reducing energy, although CO must have been a trace C species on the Hadean Earth. We show that, simulating a geoelectrochemical environment in deep-sea hydrothermal fields, CO production with up to ~40% Faraday efficiency was attainable on CdS in CO-saturated NaCl solution at \u2264-1 V (versus the standard hydrogen electrode). The threshold potential is readily generated in the H-rich, high-temperature, and alkaline hydrothermal vents that were probably widespread on the early komatiitic and basaltic ocean crust. Thus, W\u00e4chtersh\u00e4user's scenario starting from CO was likely to be realized in the Hadean ocean hydrothermal systems.",

Herein, we demonstrated that in\u2005situ measurements of redox potentials on the surfaces of active hydrothermal mineral deposits were more negative than the surrounding seawater potential, driving electrical current generation. We also demonstrated that negative potentials in the surface of minerals were widespread in the hydrothermal fields, regardless of the proximity to hydrothermal fluid discharges. Lab experiments verified that the negative potential of the mineral surface was induced by a distant electron transfer from the hydrothermal fluid through the metallic and catalytic properties of minerals. These results indicate that electric current is spontaneously and widely generated in natural mineral deposits in deep-sea hydrothermal fields. Our discovery provides important insights into the microbial communities that are supported by extracellular electron transfer and the prebiotic chemical and metabolic evolution of the ocean hydrothermal systems.",

Therefore, deep-sea mercury monitoring is very important to both the caution of environmental pollution and the exploration of underwater mineral deposits. Due to their high sensitivity, cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (CV-AAS) (Chakraborty et al., 2014a, c), cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CV-AFS) (Fernandez-Martinez et al., 2015), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Baya et al., 2015) have been the most commonly used for the measurement of total mercury. All of these techniques require expensive and sophisticated instrumentation combined with complicated sample preparation processes (Chakraborty et al., 2015; Ferreira et al., 2015; Giacomino et al., 2008). Sample collection needs certain spatial and temporal resolutions of the target fields, and there is a risk of contamination and/or loss of mercury during the sampling and transfer of water from depth to the surface Development of a deep-sea mercury sensor using in situ anodic stripping voltammetry",

Although Fe-bearing minerals have been extensively studied as reductants, the incompatibility of these reactions with the paleo-oceanic chemical conditions would have contributed only to low conversion rates. A recent model of prebiotic synthesis driven by geoelectricity suggests that less-abundant transition metals might have played a role in ammonia synthesis. Herein, we report that the electrochemical reduction of nitrate/nitrite to ammonia is effectively catalyzed by molybdenum sulfide over a wide pH range (pH 3\u201311). The pH dependence of the onset potential of the denitrification current indicates that this superior activity is due to the ability to induce concerted proton\u2013electron transfer (CPET), contributing to a turnover frequency comparable to those of the extant Mo-dependent nitrate reductases.

However, geochemical mechanisms to harness the reductive power provided by hydrothermal systems remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that, under a geoelectrochemical condition realizable in the early ocean hydrothermal systems, several metal sulfides (FeS, AgS, CuS, and PbS) undergo hour- to day-scale conversion to the corresponding metals at \u2264-0.7 V (versus the standard hydrogen electrode). The electrochemically produced FeS-Fe assemblage promoted various reactions including certain steps in the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle with efficiencies far superior to those due to pure FeS.

Crucial factors were the requirements of the reduced nicotinamides as a cofactor and Zn(2+) as a metal ion. Optimal pHs were in the range of 8.5-9.5. The effectiveness of NADH was thirty times lower than that of NADPH at a low concentration of 2mm. The oxygenation mechanism(s) is discussed by using oxygenase inhibitors such as amethopterin, metyrapone, ancymidol, and prohexadione. Metal-chelating agents strongly inhibited the biosynthesis, suggesting that metallo-enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis. ",

To examine the pathophysiological significance of plasma proteomics in OSAS, the plasma samples from severe OSAS patients (n = 6) with obese (BMI > 30) and non-OSAS patients (n = 6) with non-obese (BMI < 30) were subjected to proteomic profiling. Many proteins regarding inflammation and immune response, including complement proteins, two acute-phase reactants ceruloplasmin and serum amyloid P-component, were found to be highly expressed in severe OSAS patients. Protein changes responsible for immune modulation and inflammation may be a feature of OSAS patients.",

It was clearly shown that these nanostructures of SWCNTs are crucial for supercritical gas adsorptivity.",

The project holds annual international and regional competitions as a part of RoboCup, which is the world cup of autonomous robots. In the competition, participants compete for championship using their own ideas on the RoboCupRescue simulator, which simulates post-disaster situations after an urban earthquake. In addition, one aim of the RoboCupRescue Simulation is to increase interest in disaster prevention by exhibiting disaster relief simulations through the competition. However, it is difficult to understand the competition fully using the current system. In this paper, we propose a new representation method and display system for competitions, which is easier for spectators to understand. Furthermore, we evaluated the implemented system using a questionnaire. As a result, we confirmed that the new system is effective.",

The components of the liquid film were 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(nonafluorobutanesulfonyl)imide as the electrolyte, dibutyl phthalate as the medium, and ferrocene as the redox-active mediator. When the thickness of the liquid film was less than that of the diffusion layer in the minimum potential step of the apparatus, a symmetric voltammogram, according to the Nernst equation, was recorded. The reduction of H 2 O 2  by POD was carried out on the liquid-film-modified electrode and studied by potentiometric coulometry. The addition of H 2 O 2  shifts the electrode potential positively, due to the oxidation of ferrocene. The change in the potential is in agreement with the Nernst equation. Thus, potentiometric coulometry, carried out on the liquid-film-modified electrode, enables the determination of the substrate without the requirement of a calibration curve.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Electrostatic interactions between proteins are key factors that govern the association and reaction rate. We spectroscopically determine the second-order reaction rate constant ( k ) of electron transfer from [NiFe] hydrogenase (H 2 ase) to cytochrome (cyt)  c  3  at various ionic strengths ( I ). The  k  value decreases with  I . To analyze the results, we develop a semi-analytical formula for  I  dependence of  k  based on the assumptions that molecules are spherical and the reaction proceeds via a transition state. Fitting of the formula to the experimental data reveals that the interaction occurs in limited regions with opposite charges and with radii much smaller than those estimated from crystal structures. This suggests that local charges in H 2 ase and cyt  c  3  play important roles in the reaction. Although the crystallographic data indicate a positive electrostatic potential over almost the entire surface of the proteins, there exists a small region with negative potential on H 2 ase at which the electron transfer from H 2 ase to cyt  c  3  may occur. This local negative potential region is identical to the hypothetical interaction sphere predicted by the analysis. Furthermore,  I  dependence of  k  is predicted by the Adaptive Poisson\u2013Boltzmann Solver considering all charges of the amino acids in the proteins and the configuration of H 2 ase/cyt  c  3  complex. The calculation reproduces the experimental results except at extremely low  I . These results indicate that the stabilization derived from the local electrostatic interaction in the H 2 ase/cyt  c  3  complex overcomes the destabilization derived from the electrostatic repulsion of the overall positive charge of both proteins.",

The adsorption coefficients of charged redox species depend on their charges and the potential at the inner Helmholtz plane. The adsorbed amounts of the redox species and supporting electrolyte are estimated using the Frumkin isotherm and Gouy\u2013Chapman theory, respectively. The potential dependence of the adsorbed amount of either one or both of the oxidized and reduced forms of the redox species is maximized near its standard potential. The electrocapillary equation at a non-polarizable liquid metal\u2013solution interface under an externally controlled potential is revisited. The derived electrocapillary equation facilitates calculating the electrocapillary curve of the non-polarizable interface based on the quantity of adsorbed ions. The electrocapillary curve calculated based on the model may have a concave part, which would indicate that the interface is thermodynamically forbidden, near the standard redox potential of the redox couple.",

        "abstract": "To understand electrostatic interactions in biomolecules, the bimolecular rate constants (k) between redox enzymes and charged substrates (in this study, redox mediators in the electrode reaction) were evaluated at various ionic strengths (I) for the mediated bioelectrocatalytic reaction. The k value between bilirubin oxidase (BOD) and positively charged mediators increased with I, while that between BOD and negatively charged mediators decreased with I. The opposite trend was observed for the reaction of glucose oxidase (GOD). In the case of noncharged mediators, the k value was independent of I for both BOD and GOD. These results reflect the electrostatic interactions between the enzymes and the mediators. Furthermore, we estimated k/k\u00b0 (k\u00b0 being the thermodynamic rate constant) by numerical simulation (finite element method) based on the Poisson\u2013Boltzmann (PB) equation.

        "abstract": "Use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors represented by gefitinib and erlotinib has become the standard of treatment for non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with activating EGFR mutations. However, the majority of NSCLCs, which overexpress EGFR without such mutations, are resistant to EGFR inhibitors, and the mechanism(s) behind such primary resistance of NSCLCs without activating EGFR mutations to EGFR inhibitors still remains poorly understood. Here in this study, we show that glucose metabolism mediated by GLUT1, a facilitative glucose transporter, is involved in gefitinib resistance of NSCLC cells. We found that GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake were increased in resistant NSCLC cells after gefitinib treatment and that genetic as well as pharmacological inhibition of GLUT1 sensitized not only NSCLC cells with primary resistance but also those with acquired resistance to gefitinib. , the combination of systemic gefitinib and a GLUT1 inhibitor, both of which failed to inhibit tumor growth when administered alone, significantly inhibited the growth of xenograft tumors formed by the implantation of NSCLC cells with wild-type EGFR (wt-EGFR). Since our data indicated that GLUT1 was similarly involved in erlotinib resistance, our findings suggest that the activity of GLUT1-mediated glucose metabolism could be a critical determinant for the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to EGFR inhibitors and that concurrent GLUT1 inhibition may therefore be a mechanism-based approach to treating NSCLCs resistant to EGFR inhibitors, including those with wt-EGFR.",

        "abstract": "From the perspective of psycho-oncology, antipsychotics are widely used for patients with cancer. Although some antipsychotic drugs have anti-tumor effects, these antipsychotic drugs are not applicable for cancer patients because of their severe side effects. Brexpiprazole, a novel serotonin-dopamine modulator with an improved side effect profile, was developed as a drug that is structurally and pharmacologically related to aripiprazole, which was reported to have anti-cancer effects. However, it remains unknown whether brexpiprazole has anti-cancer effects. In this study, we examined whether brexpiprazole has anti-tumor effects in cancer cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs) of glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, and lung cancer. Brexpiprazole suppressed cell growth and induced cell death in the cancer cells and the CSCs, and decreased the CSC properties of the CSCs. Brexpiprazole did not exert any cytotoxic effects on non-cancer cells at the anti-cancer effect-inducing concentration. In the cancer cells and the CSCs, brexpiprazole reduced the expression of survivin, an anti-apoptotic protein, whose reduction sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapeutic reagents. In the preclinical model in which pancreatic CSCs were subcutaneously implanted into nude mice, brexpiprazole suppressed tumor growth, in addition to reducing the expression of Sox2, a marker for CSCs, and survivin. This suggests that brexpiprazole is a promising antipsychotic drug with anti-tumor effects and an improved safety profile.",

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma is a primary brain tumor associated with a poor prognosis due to its high chemoresistance capacity. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are one of the mechanisms of chemoresistance. Although therapy targeting CSCs is promising, strategies targeting CSCs remain unsuccessful. Abnormal activation of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) due to amplification, mutation, or both of the  gene is common in glioblastomas. However, glioblastomas are resistant to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), and overcoming resistance is essential. Brexpiprazole is a new, safe serotonin-dopamine activity modulator used for schizophrenia and depression that was recently reported to have anti-CSC activity and function as a chemosensitizer. Here, we examined its chemosensitization effects on osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI with an excellent safety profile, in glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are CSCs of glioblastoma. Brexpiprazole treatment sensitized GSCs to osimertinib and reduced the expression of survivin, an antiapoptotic factor, and the pharmacological and genetic inhibition of survivin mimicked the effects of brexpiprazole. Moreover, co-treatment of brexpiprazole and osimertinib suppressed tumor growth more efficiently than either drug alone without notable toxicity in vivo. This suggests that the combination of brexpiprazole and osimertinib is a potential therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma by chemosensitizing GSCs through the downregulation of survivin expression.",

        "abstract": "Nanoparticulate agents for magnetic drug delivery systems (DDSs) have extensive applications in targeted drug delivery, contrast imaging and therapeutics. However, no simple synthetic method for magnetic DDS agents has been developed without the need to add magnetic nanoparticles. Here, we describe the one-step fabrication of \u2018all-in-one\u2019 magneto-assemblies using an \u2018inorganic-metal-salt-free\u2019 method, involving spontaneous self-assembly of the water-insoluble prodrug \u03bc-oxo-bis(N,N\u2032-ethylenebis(salicylideniminato)iron) [Fe(salen)] (magnetic core) with polypyrrole (PPy)-b-polycaprolactone (PCL) smart diblock copolymers. In the system, PCL serves as a heat-responsive core scaffold, and PPy serves as an electronic core-size controller and pH-responsive shell. This core\u2013shell nanocomposite has a high-loading capacity (~90%), and the core size is tunable by incorporating albumin or gum arabic as bio-coating agents, which also provide colloidal stability, biocompatibility and thermo-stability. Fe(salen), which has intrinsic antitumor activity, also has ubiquitous magnetic properties, which are dramatically enhanced in these molecular assemblies with magnetic coupling. Moreover, these multifunctional nanoassemblies can be delivered magnetically, can serve as magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents, can generate magneto-hyperthermal effects and can enable magnetic field-triggered release of Fe(salen) molecules under acidic conditions.",

        "abstract": " (Fe(Salen)) is an anti-cancer agent with intrinsic magnetic property. Here, we covalently linked Fe(Salen) to paclitaxel (PTX), a widely used anti-cancer drug, to obtain a magnetized paclitaxel conjugate (M-PTX), which exhibited magnetic characteristics for magnet-guided drug delivery and MRI visualization. M-PTX increased apoptosis and G2/M arrest of cultured human oral cancer cell lines in the same manner as PTX. Furthermore, marked contrast intensity was obtained in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of M-PTX. In a mouse oral cancer model, a permanent magnet placed on the body surface adjacent to the tumor resulted in distinct accumulation of M-PTX, and the anti-cancer effect was greater than that of M-PTX without the magnet. We believe that this strategy may improve future cancer chemotherapy by providing conventional anti-cancer drugs with novel functionalities such as magnet-guided drug delivery or MRI-based visualization/quantitation of drug distribution.",

Magnetic nanoparticles impart imaging and on-demand release capabilities to drug-delivery polymers, but can be tricky to incorporate into biocompatible materials without adversely affecting solubility. Jeong-Hwan Kim from Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine in Japan and co-workers overcame this synthetic challenge by switching from typical iron oxide nanomagnets to ones based on \u2018iron-salen\u2019 molecular magnets with demonstrated cancer-fighting ability. The team discovered a procedure that self-assembles them into nanospheres encapsulated by an outer layer of polypyrrole polymers. These core-shell hybrid nanospheres could be readily modified by albumin or gum arabic biocoating agents to improve their solubility, stability, and magnetism, when loaded with drugs. Multifunctional magnetic capabilities, including MR imaging, magnetic field- and pH-responsive heat-releasing hyperthermia effects, and controlled release, were also found.",
