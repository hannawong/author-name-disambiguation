        "abstract": "Abstract   The anti-myocardial ischaemic effect of pseudoginsenoside F11 (PF 11 ), a characteristic constituent of American ginseng, was evaluated in rats with coronary artery ligation. Both data and histopathological examination demonstrated that intragastric administration of PF 11  at doses of 6 and 12 mg/kg could significantly improve heart function and decrease infarct size. Meanwhile, the levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate transaminase (AST), malondialdehyde (MDA), and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) decreased, while the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased. Flow cytometry and western blotting were used to explore the underlying mechanism, and results showed that the expression of beta1-adrenoceptor (β1-AR) was decreased by PF 11 . Furthermore, Glide XP software (Schrodinger) for molecular docking unravelled the probable binding sites between PF 11  and β1-AR. This study provides substantial evidence for the effect of PF 11  on myocardial ischaemia, and indicates that PF 11  might be a potential dietary supplement for treatment of myocardial ischaemia injury.",

The synthesized products were systematically studied by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that the formation of Cu 2 O nanocactuses was strongly depended on the addition of CTAB and NaOH. The structural evolution of the cactuslike Cu 2 O was found to follow dissolution and recrystallization processes. It is noteworthy that the stepwise synthetic procedure was crucial to the growth of the final nanoarchitectures. UV–vis spectrum was also used to estimate the absorption and photodegradation ability of the nanocactuses.",

        "abstract": "Zn 2 SnO 4 with novel octahedron structures have been successfully synthesized on a large scale by applying surfactant hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) throughout controllable hydrothermal reaction. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microcopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were used to characterize the final products. The results have revealed that three-dimensional (3D) Zn 2 SnO 4 octahedrons were assembled with numerous intercrossed hexagon nanoplates with a mean edge length of 300 nm and an average thickness of 50 nm. Based on the time-dependent experimental results, the growth mechanism has been thoroughly investigated. The morphology of as-prepared octahedrons evolved from cubes with branched structures on their surfaces to octahedrons assembled with hexagon nanoplates, indicating that the process of crystal growth was controlled by a crystallization–dissolution–recrystallization growth mechanism. More importantly, we found that CTAB played a key role during the total formation process of as-obtained Zn 2 SnO 4 octahedrons. UV–vis spectroscopy was further employed to estimate the band gap energy of the octahedron microstructures. Keywords Semiconductors Crystal growth Optical properties",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Passage arrangement quality significantly affects the performance of multistream plate fin heat exchanger (MPFHEs) because a bad arrangement may result in uneven temperature difference field and pressure field between passages and thus reduce the thermal efficiency. However, it is very difficult to design an effective passage arrangement owing to large numbers of possible passage arrangement patterns and complex heat transfer processes between the passages in a MPFHE. This work develops a direct passage arrangement method for MPFHEs to address this problem. In this method, an improvement of passage arrangement with good synergistic heat transfer effect is first proposed. The determination of passage quantity for each fluid is suggested to be proportional to its design heat load. Next, based on the results of the checking calculation, the fin and heat exchanger structure parameters should be adjusted until the constraints including thermal effectiveness, length deviation and pressure drops have been satisfied. Afterwards, the passages are arranged directly by a symmetry arrangement method. To evaluate the effectiveness of this method, three different industrial cases are performed and compared with the existing optimization designs by three evaluation means. The validation results indicate that this method performs better than the complex optimization methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Asymmetric supercapacitors are one of the promising next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices. However, the necessity to distinguish the polarity of asymmetric supercapacitors makes it more like rechargeable batteries and affects the convenience of practical applications. We herein report a novel flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (FASC) that can be charged without distinguishing the electrode polarity based on CVD-grown nickel nanoparticle@carbon nanotube (Ni@CNT) network films. The FASC is assembled by using the binder-free Ni@CNT as both the negative and positive electrodes but aqueous alkaline solution as the electrolyte. In such a design, one electrode side is involved with the Faradaic redox reactions between nickel nanoparticles and OH - , while the other side works via electric double layer charge accumulation at the interface of CNTs/electrolyte, enabling the device with an asymmetric feature and a high voltage of 1.8 V. Exactly because of the above, the FASC demonstrates almost the same charge/discharge profiles, stable cycling and comparable efficiency for powering small electronics even with frequently alternating the charging direction. With the integration of hydrogel electrolyte of PVA-KOH, our flexible quasi-solid-state FASC device delivers high volumetric energy density of 1.39 mWh cm −3  and power density of 440 mW cm −3 , as well as excellent cycleability up to 10,000 times (100% capacitance retention). The volumetric performance is even much better than previous reported FASC devices that were designed with complicated electrode architectures. Our work presents a pioneering strategy for developing non-polarity asymmetric electrochemical energy storage systems.",

Methods Sixty 6-week-old BALB/c mice were randomly divided into five groups,12 mice per group.Mice were hypodermically immunized with 100 μl PBS,20 μg,40 μg,60 μg and 80 μg rTgSAG1(dissolved in 100 μl PBS),respectively.Two boosters were carried out at 2-week intervals.On day 14 after the last immunization,all mice were intragastrically challenged with 1×104 tachyzoites per mouse,and the health status of infected mice was recorded every day after challenged.On day 28 after challenge,survival mice were killed.The tachyzoites of their livers and brains and the lymphocytes of spleens and intraepithelial lymphocytes(IEL)were counted,respectively,and serum IgG and IgA in intestinal washes were detected by ELISA. Results On day 6-14 after challenge,mice showed clothing hair rough at different degrees,decrease of foraging and drinking water.The survival rate was the lowest in PBS group(33.3%),but the highest(75%)in 40 μg dose group.The tachyzoite loads in 40 μg dose group in livers(79.60)and brains(16.88)were significantly lower than that in PBS group(94.43,19.48)(P<0.05).The number of splenic lymphocyte(10.31)and IEL(4.25)in 40 μg group were significantly higher than that in PBS group(6.24,1.64)(P<0.01).The levels of IgG in 40 μg group(P<0.01),20 μg and 60 μg groups(P<0.05)were significantly higher than that in PBS group respectively.The level of IgA had no marked change. Conclusion The protective immunity against Toxoplasma gondii in mouse hypodermic immunization with rTgSAG1 could be induced,and 40 μg is the best immunizing dose.",

        "abstract": "A novel image texture pattern classification (ITPC) method based on statistical modeling of image spatial structures (ISSs) is presented due to the perceptual perspective that the visual appearance of image texture pattern (ITP) visually depends on the random organization of local homogeneous fragments. Firstly, the oriented Gaussian derivative filters (OGDFs)-based ISS characteristics expression method is introduced. Then, the Weibull distribution (WD) behavior of ISSs, boiled down to the randomly-distributed local homogeneous fragments, is explicated by the sequential fragmentation theory (SFT). Finally, the WD-based ISS feature parameters, directly related to the human vision perception(HVP) system, are extracted and used to ITPC by a partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)-based classifier. The effectiveness of the proposed ISS-based ITPC method is verified by extensive experiments on three different texture image databases and compared with some classic statistics-based ITP identification methods.",

        "abstract": " With the widespread application of regional low-flow perfusion (RLFP), development of surgical techniques, and shortened circulatory arrest time, deep hypothermia is indispensable for organ protection. Clinicians have begun to increase the temperature to reduce hypothermia-related adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of elevated temperatures during aortic arch surgery with lower body circulatory arrest (LBCA) combined with RLFP.  We retrospectively analyzed data from 207 consecutive pediatric patients who underwent aortic arch repair with LBCA & RLFP between January 2010 and July 2017 and evaluated different hypothermia management strategies. The overall cohort was divided into three groups: deep hypothermia (DH, 20.0-25.0°C), moderate hypothermia (MoH, 25.1-30.0°C) and mild hypothermia (MH, 30.1-34.0°C).  The percentage of AKI-1 occurrences was significantly increased in the MH group (51.52%) compared to those in the DH (25.40%) and MoH (37.84%) groups ( = 0.036); prolonged hospital stay occurrences were decreased with elevated temperature (DH 47.62%, MoH 28.83%, MH 18.18%,  = 0.006). Neurological complications, peritoneal dialysis, hepatic dysfunction, 30-day hospital mortality, delay extubation occurrences were no significant among the groups. Logistic analysis showed that the MH group was negatively associated with post-op AKI-1 compared with the DH group [ = 0.329 (0.137-0.788),  = 0.013], no differences were found between the MoH and the MH group. Compared to other groups, the intubation time ( = 0.006) and postoperative hospital stay ( = 0.009) were significantly decreased in the MH group. Multivariate logistic analysis showed hypothermia levels were not significant with prolonged hospital stay.  This retrospective analysis demonstrated that for pediatric patients undergoing surgeries with RLFP & LBCA, three different gradient temperature management strategies are available: deep, moderate, and mild hypothermia. Utilizing mild or moderate hypothermia is safe and feasible. Although the number of AKI-1 occurrences in the MH group was significantly increased compared to those in the other groups, further analysis showed no significance in the MoH and MH group, mild hypothermia management is as safe as others when used appropriately.",

To promote sustainable development in the reservoir area and protection of its ecological security,the ecosystem's health status and its stress factors need to be clarified. According to the characteristics of the local ecological system,a natural-social-economic health evaluation index system of the complex ecosystem was constructed. And on the basis of the grey system theory,the Jaynes maximum entropy principle in information theory was introduced to evaluate the ecosystem health of the Three Gorges reservoir area (Chongqing) . The results show that the Three Gorges reservoir area (Chongqing) ecosystem remains in a transitional stage of rapid change. The functions of production,regulation and services are significantly different. The health condition of the eastern section of the Three Gorges reservoir area (Chongqing) ecosystem is better than the western section,but the interior of the eastern ecosystem is apparently different and has complex structure. Corresponding measures are proposed to solve the problems above.",

        "abstract": "It is reported sesquiterpenoids from Panax ginseng (SPG) possess various pharmacological activities, for example, antidepressant, antioxidative and antiinflammatory. The purpose of this study was to examine the hepatoprotective effects of SPG (2.5 and 10 mg/kg, i.g.) on fulminant liver injury induced by D-galactosamine (D-GalN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and discuss its mechanisms of action. 24 h after D-GalN (400 mg/kg, i.p.) and LPS (25 μg/kg, i.p.) exposed, the serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) level, hepatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH), and hepatic tissue histology were measured. Expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) were detected by ELISA and RT-PCR. Moreover, the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), sirtuin type 1 (Sirt 1) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) were determined by western blotting. The results indicated that SPG evidently restrained the increasement of serum ALT and AST levels induced by D-GalN/LPS. SPG obviously down-regulated TNF-α and IL-1β levels and their mRNA expression in liver. In addition, D-GalN/LPS injection induced severe oxidative stress in liver by boosted MDA level as well as decreased CAT, GSH and SOD capacities, and SPG reversed these changes. Meanwhile, SPG inhibited NF-κB activation induced by D-GalN/LPS and up-regulation Sirt 1, Nrf2 and HO-1 expression levels. Therefore, SPG might protect against the fulminant liver injury induced by D-GalN/LPS via inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress. The protective effect of SPG on fulminant liver injury induced by D-GalN/LPS might be mediated by Sirt 1/Nrf2/NF-κB signaling pathway. All these results implied that SPG might be a promising food additives and therapeutic agent for fulminant liver injury.",

However, R290 has flammability. There is necessary to improve the STAC design to reduce the refrigerant charge for the safety use. This work proposes a novel falling film condensing technology to address this problem. The novel condenser was setup on a STAC and tested in the standard psychrometric chamber. Experimental results show that using falling film condenser significantly reduces the refrigerant charge. The best performance is obtained with 290 g of R290 charge, for which the cooling capacity is 2690 W and the coefficient of performance (COP) is 3.55, meeting the safety and energy efficiency requirements. This result provides a new technical route for the application of an R290 STAC.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Background  Gastric ulcer (GU) is a common gastrointestinal disease that can be induced by many factors. Finding an effective treatment method that contains fewer side effects is important. 20 (S)-ginsenoside Rg3 is a kind of protopanaxadiol and has shown superior antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects in many studies, especially cancer studies. In this study, we examined the treatment efficacy of 20 (S)-ginsenoside Rg3 on GU.    Methods  Three kinds of GU models, including an alcohol GU model, a pylorus-ligated GU model, and an acetic acid GU model, were used. Mouse endothelin-1 (ET-1) and nitric oxide (NO) levels in blood and epidermal growth factor (EGF), superoxide dismutase, and NO levels in gastric mucosa were evaluated. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of gastric mucosa and immunohistochemical staining of ET-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), and epidermal growth factor receptors were studied. Ulcer index (UI) scores and UI ratios were also analyzed to demonstrate the GU conditions in different groups. Furthermore, Glide XP from Schrodinger was used for molecular docking to clarify the interactions between 20 (S)-ginsenoside Rg3 and EGF and NOS2.    Results  20 (S)-ginsenoside Rg3 significantly decreased the UI scores and UI ratios in all the three GU models, and it demonstrated antiulcer effects by decreasing the ET-1 and NOS2 levels and increasing the NO, superoxide dismutase, EGF, and epidermal growth factor receptor levels. In addition, high-dose 20 (S)-ginsenoside Rg3 showed satisfactory gastric mucosa protection effects.    Conclusion  20 (S)-ginsenoside Rg3 can inhibit the formation of GU and may be a potential therapeutic agent for GU.",

        "abstract": "In order to achieve the automatic monitoring and intelligent evaluation of the bauxite flotation process, a method of analyzing and selecting the best production condition of the cleaner froth based on machine vision is presented. Firstly, the roughness feature of froth surface texture is extracted based on the improved local binary pattern(LBP) operator. Then, the best roughness interval of the cleaner froth texture feature in the flotation production process is obtained through analyzing the relation between the flotation concentrate grade and the extracted surface texture features of the cleaner froth image. This method can monitor the change of the texture feature of the cleaner froth image in real time and automatically identify whether the cleaning process is under the best production condition, which lays the foundation of the optimal control of the bauxite flotation process.",

        "abstract": "Whether modified histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution offers myocardial protection to newborn heart has not been documented. The purpose of this study was to compare myocardial protection using HTK added by ebselen with HTK in a piglet model of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Fifteen piglets were randomly assigned to three groups: the control group (C group, n = 5), HTK solution group (HTK group, n = 5), and HTK added by 10 nM ebselen group (HTK+E group, n = 5). Animals in the two experimental groups were placed on hypothermic CPB, after which the ascending aorta had been clamped for 2 h. The control animals underwent normothermic CPB without cardiac arrest. Myocardial antioxidant activities, myocytes apoptosis and mitochondrial structures, as well as the release of cytochrome c and the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and HSP72 protein in myocardium were measured. Increased myocardial superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Mn-SOD activities, decreased TUNEL-positive cells, and reduced release of cytochrome c were noted in the HTK+E group compared with those in the HTK group (P = 0.021, P = 0.020, P = 0.045, and P = 0.010, respectively). The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in the HTK group was significantly higher than that in the C group (P = 0.024). The expression of HSP72 protein and mRNA in the HTK+E group was higher than that in the HTK group (P = 0.039 and P = 0.035, respectively). Mitochondrial score under electron microscope in the HTK+E group was lower than that in the HTK group (P = 0.047). Improved antioxidant defense, reduced myocytes apoptosis, and better preserved mitochondrial structure were observed in the HTK+E group. Ebselen added to HTK provides better myocardioprotection to HTK solution for the neonatal heart.",

        "abstract": "The leaves of the Acanthopanax species have traditionally been used as a tonic and sedative, as well as in the treatment of rheumatism and diabetes, and one of their main active ingredients is a lupane triterpenoid chiisanoside which exhibits a series of significant pharmacological effects. However, the anti-tumor activity of chiisanoside on H22 hepatocellular carcinoma and the pharmacokinetics study have not been mentioned. The aim of this study was to explore the anti-tumor efficacy, the potential mechanisms in a H22 tumor-bearing mice model, and the pharmacokinetics properties and tissue distribution characteristics in a rat model. The results revealed that chiisanoside exhibited significant inhibition of tumor cell growth with no side effects on immune organs. The plasma cytokine levels of IL-2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ were enhanced, whereas the plasma VEGF level was decreased after chiisanoside treatment. Moreover, the results of Hu0026E, TUNEL assay, immunohistochemistry showed that chiisanoside exhibited antitumor activity in vivo by promoting apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis. Additionally, further investigations on the pharmacokinetics revealed that chiisanoside had a trait of fast absorption and rapid elimination in rat. Furthermore, the results of tissue distribution showed that chiisanoside was mainly distributed in the liver, small intestine and other organs in rat, which indicated that chiisanoside exhibited good liver and small intestine-targeting efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Synaptic dysfunction during early stages of Alzheimeru0027s disease (AD) is triggered by soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers that interact with NMDA receptors (NMDARs). We previously showed that Aβ induces synaptic protein loss through NMDARs, albeit through undefined mechanisms. Accordingly, we here examined the contribution of individual NMDAR subunits to synaptotoxicity and demonstrate that Aβ exerts differential effects on the levels and distribution of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits of NMDAR in dendrites. Treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with Aβ1-40 (10 μM, 1 h) induced a significant increase of dendritic and synaptic GluN2B puncta densities with parallel decreases in the puncta densities of denritic and synaptic pTyr1472-GluN2B. Conversely, Aβ significantly decreased dendritic and synaptic GluN2A and dendritic pTyr1325-GluN2A puncta densities and increased synaptic pTyr1325-GluN2A puncta densities. Unexpectedly, Aβ treatment resulted in a significant reduction of GluN2B and pTyr1472-GluN2B protein levels but did not influence GluN2A and pTyr1325-GluN2A levels. These results show that Aβ exerts complex and distinct regulatory effects on the trafficking and phosphorylation of GluN2A and GluN2B, as well as on their localization within synaptic and non-synaptic sites. Increased understanding of these early events in Aβ-induced synaptic dysfunction is likely to be important for the development of timely preventive and therapeutic interventions.",

        "title": "A novel and stable \"two-hit\" acute lung injury model induced by oleic acid in piglets",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Children are susceptible to pulmonary injury, and acute lung injury (ALI) often results in a high mortality and financial cost in pediatric patients. Evidence has showed that oleic acid (OA) plays an important role in ALI. Therefore, it has special significance to study ALI in pediatric patients by using OA-induced animal models. Unfortunately, the animal model hs a high mortality due to hemodynamic instability. The aim of this study was to establish a novel hemodynamically stable OA-induced ALI model in piglets with two hits. METHODS: 18 Chinese mini-piglets were randomized into three groups: group C (received saline-ethanol solution), group T (received OA-ethanol solution in routine administration manner) and group H (received OA-ethanol solution in two-hit manner). Hemodynamic and pulmonary function data were measured. Histopathological assessments were performed. RESULTS: Two piglets in group T died of radical decline of systemic blood pressure. Group T showed more drastic hemodynamic changes than group H especially during the period of 5 to 30 minutes after OA administration. Both Group T and group H all produced severe lung injury, while group C had no significant pathologic changes. OA-induced hypotension might be caused by pulmonary hypertension rather than comprised left ventricular function. CONCLUSION: OA leads to severe pulmonary hypertension which results in hemodynamic fluctuation in OA-induced ALI model. It is the first report on hemodynamic stable ALI animal model in piglets using two-hit method. The two-hit ALI animal model fulfils the ALI criteria and has the following characteristics: hemodynamic stability, stable damage to gas exchange and comparability with pediatric patients in body weight and corresponding age. The two-hit ALI animal model can be used to study the basic mechanism and the therapeutic strategies for pediatric ALI.",

        "title": "Ni/Al layered double hydroxide nanosheet film grown directly on Ti substrate and its application for a nonenzymatic glucose sensor",
        "abstract": "Ni/Al layered double hydroxide nanosheet film has been successfully fabricated on a Ti substrate by a single coprecipitation method. After the hydrothermal process, the Ti foil modified with Ni/Al layered double hydroxide nanosheet film can be directly used as the working electrode of a nonenzymatic glucose sensor. Low detection limit of 5 μM with an appropriate linear range up to 10.0 mM ( R = 0.99972) can be obtained and the sensitivity is 24.45 μAm M −1 cm −2 . The good analytical performance, low cost and one-step preparation method make this electrode material promising for the development of a nonenzymatic glucose sensor. Keywords Ni/Al layered double hydroxide Nanosheet film Nonenzymatic glucose biosensor Glucose determination 1 Introduction Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), with a brucite-like layered structure, are a family of synthetic anionic clays that consist of positively charged layers containing alternatively distributed divalent and trivalent cations in the sheets and charge balancing anions between the layers [1] . They are expressed by the general formula, [ M 1 − x II M x III ( OH ) 2 ] x + ⋅ A x / n n − ⋅ m H 2 O , where M 2+ and M 3+ represent divalent and trivalent metal cations respectively, and A n − is the interlayer anions [2] . Their remarkable features such as the layered structure, large surface area and anion exchange capability make them attractive as electrode surface modification materials in electrochemistry [3–5] . Among these LDHs, Ni-based LDHs which mean the divalent metal cation is Ni 2+ have received more attention because of their potential application in electrochemical biosensors. It could be attributed to two main characters of Ni-based LDHs. Like other members of LDHs, the positively charged layers are convenient for the adsorption of negatively charged biomolecules such as enzymes [6] , amino acids [7] , DNA [8] . Therefore, some electrochemical biosensors based on Ni-based LDHs as the supporting matrix of enzymes have been successfully developed [9] . On the other hand, the Ni 2+ cation in the host layers is electrochemically active. The unique electrocatalytic effect mediated by Ni 2+ /Ni 3+ redox couples in alkaline circumstance is very useful in the determination of glucose [10] , thus the nonenzymatic glucose biosensors based on the Ni-based LDHs have also been developed in recent years [11] . In order to enhance the analytical performance of these nonenzymatic glucose biosensors based on the Ni-based LDHs, some effective techniques have been used to deposit Ni-based LDHs onto various substrates. An important example was demonstrated in 2002 by Roto and Villemure that the presynthesized Ni/Al layered double hydroxide (Ni/Al-LDH) powder can be immobilized onto the ITO or glassy carbon electrode surface with the help of silica gel [12] . Similar results were obtained on silicon wafers and porous Ni foams substrate when the silica gel was replaced by dry organic solvents or polytetrafluoroethylene [13,14] . An advanced synthetic strategy has been developed by the direct electrodeposition of Ni/Al-LDH on conductive substrates such as Au, Pt and glassy carbon electrode [15] . The oriented electrosynthesis of LDHs film on electrodes surface improves its adhesion to substrates and there is no need to transfer the as-prepared LDHs powder to a different surface or use other additives as binder. Following the strategy, Ni/Al-LDH film consisted of nanoparticles can be directly fabricated on the electrode surface by a simple way. In general, compared to spherical nanoparticles, well-aligned 2-D nanosheet film on conductive substrates are more attractive due to its promising applications in biosensor development. The interconnected structure is especially efficient for the transport of electrons and its high surface area-to-volume ratio could effectively increase the electrode–electrolyte contact area. As a result, to construct an ordered Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film directly on conductive substrate will be very useful. Compared to other conductive substrates such as silicon wafer, ITO and graphite, metal substrates have received considerable attention because of their special properties. For example, good flexibility and high mechanical strength make them to be appropriate substrates to support other materials. In addition, most of metal materials are easy to be obtained with low cost and cut into various shapes at different sizes. These advantages open up the possibility of practicable applications of those electrodes based on metal substrates. The single preparation method of LDHs nanosheet films grown from active metal substrates like aluminum and zinc in alkaline solution have been reported [16,17] . However these metal substrates are too active to be the candidate for the electrode of electrochemistry. Therefore, an appropriate and relatively inert metal substrate should be found to fabricate electrocatalysts. Among inert metal substrates, noble metal electrodes such as Au and Pt electrode are favored in electrochemistry due to their good stability and excellent conductivity. Yet, these electrodes are usually expensive and need special polish before coating. Considering its excellent properties, like reasonable cost, good stability, high mechanical strength and wide electrochemical potential windows, Ti foil could be a good substitute of noble metal electrodes to support electrocatalysts [18] . For example, Koczkur et al. have reported nanoporous network Pt–Ir/Ti electrode via a one-step hydrothermal method [19] . Yi et al. have prepared titanium-supported nanoscale flaky nickel electrode by a hydrothermal process [20] . These results imply that Ti foil is not only stable enough to be employed as a novel substrate in electrochemistry, but also very suitable for the direct growth of electrocatalysts. Stimulated by these results and growing large-area uniform LDHs nanosheet film directly on Ti substrate has never been reported before, the Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film grown directly on Ti foils was successfully synthesized in our laboratory. In this article, Ni/Al layered double hydroxide nanosheet film has been successfully fabricated on a Ti substrate by a single coprecipitation method. The fabrication process has the advantages of being very simple, cheap and mild. The direct growth of Ni/Al-LDH nanosheets on Ti foil considerably improves its mechanical stability, adhesion and conductivity to the substrate. The Ti foil modified with Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet can be directly used as the working electrode of a nonenzymatic glucose sensor. There is no need to use extra binders or other classical electrodes such as glassy carbon and Au electrode. The Ti foil acts as the conductive substrate supporting the interconnected Ni/Al-LDH nanosheets and the Ni 2+ cations in Ni/Al-LDH nanosheets play an essential role in the electrocatalytic detection of glucose. In application to electrochemistry, the new electrode exhibits high sensitivity, fast response, an appropriate linear range and good stability. The good analytical performance, low cost and one-step preparation method make this electrode material promising for the development of a nonenzymatic glucose sensor. 2 Experimental 2.1 Reagents All chemicals including nickel nitrate (Ni(NO 3 ) 2 ), aluminum nitrate (Al(NO 3 ) 3 ), urea ((NH 2 ) 2 CO), glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were analytical grade, and were used as received without further purification. All aqueous solutions were prepared in distilled water. The titanium foil was 99% purity. 2.2 Apparatus All electrochemical experiments were carried out by CHI 660C Electrochemical Work Station (CH Instrument Company of Shanghai, China). A conventional three-electrode system was adopted. The working electrode was a titanium foil modified with Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film, the counter electrode was a Pt wire and the reference electrode was a saturate calomel electrode (SCE). All potential values given below were referred to the SCE. The geometric surface area of the working electrode is 0.8 cm 2 . The products were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (Bruker D-8 Avance, Cu K α radiation, 1.5418 Å), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra (NICOLET NEXUS470), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010FEF, 200 kV) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6700F, 5.0 kV). 2.3 Fabrication of Ti foil electrode modified with Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film The Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film grown directly on Ti Substrate was prepared by a single coprecipitation method. The typical procedures can be described as followed. Firstly, Ti foils were pretreated in the hydrofluoric acid solution to remove the oxides on their surfaces, and then rinsed with pure water. Secondly, a certain quality of nickel nitrate, aluminum nitrate and urea were dissolved in 70 ml distilled water to give the final concentrations of 0.10 mM, 0.05 mM and 0.5 mM respectively. Thirdly, the Ti foils were vertically put in the obtained mixed solution and the solution was aged at 95 °C for 24 h. Lastly, after the reaction completed, the Ti foils were washed with distilled water and ethanol several times, then dried at room temperature. In this way, Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film could be fabricated on the Ti substrate by a very simple way with low cost. This opened up the possibility of large-scale production of the novel probe which can be applied as the electrode for a glucose sensor. 2.4 Electrochemical experiments The electrochemical behavior of the prepared electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a 0.1 M NaOH solution at different scan rates. The Ti foil modified with Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film was evaluated as the working electrode of a nonenzymatic glucose sensor in 0.1 M NaOH solution at desired potential. Amperometric curves were obtained after adding a glucose solution of certain concentration into the electrolyte. The current in each experiment was recorded after it reached a steady state. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Preparation and characterization of the Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film grown directly on Ti substrate Our group successfully developed a single coprecipitation method to fabricate Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film on Ti foil which was relatively inert in the measurement of electrochemical analysis. The fabrication process was shown in Fig. 1 . In the process of preparation, urea played an important role. The hydrolysis of urea provided a source of anions for the formation of Ni/Al-LDH and kept the pH of the reaction medium at around 9, especially suitable for the growth of LDH crystallites [21,22] . Furthermore, the slow release of NH 4 + by the hydrolysis of urea at 95 °C was very helpful to the nucleation and growth of LDH seeds on the Ti foil. When the urea was replaced by sodium hydroxide in the experiment, the uniform Ni/Al-LDH film constructed with interconnected nanosheets could not be observed on the Ti foil. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film on Ti foil is shown in Fig. 2 a . It shows three characteristic diffraction peaks at 11.644°, 23.348° and 35.482°, corresponding to the (0 0 3), (0 0 6) and (0 0 9) crystalline planes of Ni/Al-LDH material (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards file No. 48-0594), respectively. Other strong diffraction peaks could be attributed to the crystalline planes of thick polycrystalline Ti substrate (JCPDS file No. 01-1197). A Fourier transform IR (FT-IR) spectrum of the product is shown in Fig. 2 b. Broad absorption peaks in the region 3477 cm −1 could be assigned to O–H stretching mode of the LDH layer and interlayer water molecules. The corresponding H–OH vibration appears at about 1631 cm −1 . Nitrate anion gives a very strong absorption peak at 1383 cm −1 [23] . The characteristic peak of carbonate anions centered at 1356 cm −1 is not observed, suggesting that the amount of co-intercalated carbonate anions is minimal. A macroscopic image of the Ni/Al-LDH film on Ti substrate is given in Fig. 2 c. From the optical image, we can see the prepared Ni/Al-LDH film was uniform on Ti foils on a large-scale. The typical morphology of the as-prepared Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film, as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), is illustrated in Fig. 2(d and e) at different magnifications. As can be seen, the film consists of many interconnected nanosheets with thicknesses of 10–20 nm and lateral sizes of 300–600 nm. The small size of these nanosheets ensures the electrochemical activity of the Ni/Al layered double hydroxide material. In addition, these interconnected nanosheets are convenient for the electron transport and penetration of electrolyte. The mechanism for the direct growth of Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film on Ti foil could be ascribed to the uniform roughness of etched Ti foil surface. Roughness of substrate surface is especially valuable to the reduction of binding energy between seeds and substrate. Therefore, it is more convenient for the nucleation and adhesion of seeds on rough surface than on smooth substrate surface. To confirm this point, a comparative study was made on other substrates such as glass slide and graphite substrate. When Ti foil was replaced by glass slide substrate in the experiment, the Ni/Al-LDH film on glass slide can be easily washed away during the rinsing process. Finally, nothing can be obtained on glass slide. This experiment result showed that smooth substrate surface is not suitable for the direct growth of Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film. Therefore, without further improvement of preparation method, this reaction cannot be implemented onto other smooth electrodes at present. The experiment result on graphite substrate is given in Fig. 2 f. As can be seen from the SEM image at similar magnification to Fig. 2 d, no uniform Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film as on Ti foil could be observed on graphite substrate at the same reaction conditions. Unlike glass slide substrate, graphite substrate has a certain degree of roughness. But the roughness of polished graphite surface is not as uniform as etched Ti foil. Hence, only a disorderly Ni/Al-LDH film consists of nanoparticles could be obtained on graphite substrate. This reaction cannot be well implemented onto graphite electrode at present. But this work may be advanced in the future. 3.2 Electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose at Ti foil electrode modified with Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film Fig. 3 a shows the cyclic voltammograms curves of the prepared electrode in 0.1 M NaOH solution by applying cyclic potentials sweep of 0.05 V/s, 0.09 V/s and 0.13 V/s in the range of 0–0.7 V. As indicated, the electrode exhibits a pair of redox peaks with the anodic and cathodic peak potential positioned at 0.52 V and 0.37 V in the blank NaOH solution, which are assigned to the Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox couple forming in the alkaline medium [24] . In addition, the peak currents increase according to the increase of scan rate. Fig. 3 b shows the cyclic voltammograms curves obtained at the Ti foil electrode modified with Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film in 0.1 M NaOH solution in the absence and presence of 0.5 mM glucose. It can be observed that after injecting glucose into the solution, the anodic peak current obviously increases which due to the well-known catalytic effect of the Ni 2+ /Ni 3+ redox couple for oxidation of glucose to glucolactone. The electro-oxidation mechanism can be represented by the following reaction [25] : (1) LDH − Ni(II) + OH sol − → LDH(OH − ) − Ni(III) + e − (2) LDH(OH − ) − Ni(III) + Glucose → LDH − Ni(II) + Glucolactone The anodic peak response currents obtained at different potential scan rates in the presence of 0.5 mM glucose in 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte are given in Fig. 4 a . As can be seen, the response currents increase linearly according to the increase of potential scan rate. In order to understand whether the Ti substrate is involved in the electrocatalytic process, control cyclic voltammetry experiment is performed at the blank Ti foil electrode in 0.1 M NaOH solution in the absence and presence of 0.5 mM glucose. The curves are given in Fig. 4 b. It exhibits no pair of redox peaks and there is no difference between two curves which means no current response to glucose can be obtained at the blank Ti foil electrode. The result confirms it is the Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film plays a significant role in the electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose. 3.3 Amperometric determination of glucose at Ti foil electrode modified with Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film After the back ground current become stable, a solution of glucose is regularly injected into the electrolytic cell under optimized detection potential at 0.70 V. Each injection change the glucose concentration of electrolyte at 0.5 mM. Fig. 5 a shows the amperometric responses of the electrode to the addition of glucose solution. As indicated, current increases rapidly after each injection of glucose solution to the stirred supporting electrolyte and fast response time within 4 s could be observed. The limit of detection is 5 μM at a signal to noise ratio of 3 ( Fig. 5 a, inset). The corresponding calibration curve is shown in Fig. 5 b. As can be seen, the electrode exhibits an appropriate linear range from 5 μM to 10.0 mM with a sensitivity of 24.45 μA mM −1 cm −2 ( R = 0.99972). When considering the normal physiological level of blood sugar (3–8 mM), the analytical applicability of this sensor is promising. Comparisons to other glucose sensing methods and materials are made and given in Table 1 . Comparisons are focused on nonenzymatic and enzymatic electrochemical glucose biosensors based on kinds of Ni-based material, especially Ni/Al layered double hydroxide. As it can be seen from Table 1 , the proposed glucose sensor shows good sensing performance in terms of detection limit, sensitivity and linear range. Compared with similar hydrotalcite materials, the advantage of this electrode material is obvious. For example, compared with glassy carbon electrode modified with monodisperse Ni/Al-LDH nanoﬂakes [26] , we can see this electrode material exhibit lower detection limit, higher sensitivity and similar linear range. It can be attributed to the direct growth of Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet on Ti foil. First, direct growth of Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film on Ti foil considerably improves its stability, adhesion and conductivity to the substrate. Second, compared to monodisperse nanoﬂakes, the interconnected structure of nanosheet is more convenient for the electrons transport and its high surface area-to-volume ratio is especially valuable to the increase of electrode electrolyte contact area. These two advantages are helpful to the increase of sensitivity of biosensor and it is also what the Ni/Al-LDH nanosheets offer in terms of glucose sensing. This result also suggests that our method is a positive attempt to construct a glucose biosensor with good analytical performance through a simple way and it may be extended to other glucose biosensors which based on nickel oxide or nickel hydroxide material. The direct growth of sensing material on Ti substrate is not only easy to perform, but also helpful to improve analytical electrochemistry performance of glucose biosensor. The electrode used in this measurement was kept in room temperature and subjected to another measurement after one day. The cyclic voltammograms curve of the used electrode in 0.1 M NaOH solution at scan rate of 0.05 V/s is given in Fig. 6 a . As indicated, No obvious change in the peak potential and peak current was observed. Further repeated tests about the sensitivity of the used electrode were carried out everyday in a week. The result is given in Fig. 6 b. As indicated, the used electrode maintains at least 95.5% of the initial sensitivity in the continuous tests in one week. It shows that the electrode is stable enough to be used for the reduplicative measurement of glucose. 3.4 Real sample analysis Determination of glucose in human serum samples was performed by the developed glucose biosensor based on as-prepared titanium-supported Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film electrode. The result is given in Table 2 now. It can be seen that the prepared electrode is still effective when the sample is replaced from glucose solution to human serum and accuracy of test results is reliable in a certain range. It implies that the sensing ability of this electrode is not limited to glucose solution. It also can be used to test on real human serum samples. 4 Conclusion The Ni/Al layered double hydroxide nanosheet film grown directly on Ti substrate was successfully prepared by a single coprecipitation method and a nonenzymatic glucose biosensor based on this material was developed. There are several advantages of this glucose biosensor. It is stable enough in the electrochemical measurements which could be ascribed to the good adhesion of Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet to Ti substrate. The fabrication of this electrode can be easily performed in a single step at reasonable cost. After a one-step coprecipitation reaction, the rinsed Ti foils modified with Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film can be directly used as the working electrode without other treatment. No extra binders such as nafion need to be used during the whole process of fabrication. Moreover, the direct growth of Ni/Al-LDH nanosheet film on Ti foil considerably improves its sensing ability to glucose. In application to electrochemistry, the prepared electrode exhibits high sensitivity, fast response, good stability and an appropriate linear range for the determination of glucose. Combining benefits of good flexibility and high mechanical strength of Ti foils, electrodes of various shapes at different sizes can be easily fabricated and put into practicable applications in the future.

        "abstract": "Pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies were carried out on curculigoside C (CC), a natural product with good antioxidant and neuroprotective effects, with the purpose of investigating the effects of the hydroxyl group at C-3' in curculigoside. A rapid and sensitive method with UPLC-MS was developed and fully validated for the first time in the pharmacokinetic analysis for quantification of CC in rat plasma. The assay was linear (R² > 0.9984) over the concentration range of 1⁻2500 ng/mL, with the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) being 1 ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day precision (expressed as relative standard deviation, RSD) ranged from 4.10% to 5.51% and 5.24% to 6.81%, respectively. The accuracy (relative error, RE) ranged from -3.28% to 0.56% and -5.83% to -1.44%, respectively. The recoveries ranged from 92.14% to 95.22%. This method was then applied to a pharmacokinetic study of rats after intragastric administration of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg CC. The results revealed that CC exhibited rapid oral absorption ( = 0.106 h, 0.111 h, and 0.111 h, respectively), high elimination ( = 2.022 h, 2.061 h, and 2.048 h, respectively) and low absolute bioavailability (2.01, 2.13, and 2.39%, respectively). Furthermore, an investigation on the metabolism of CC was performed by UPLC-QTOF-MS. Twelve metabolites of CC from plasma, bile, urine and faeces of rats were confirmed. The main metabolic pathways of CC, which involve dehydration, glucosylation, desaturation, formylation, cysteine conjugation, demethylation and sulfonation, were profiled. In conclusion, this research has developed a sensitive quantitative method and demonstrated the metabolism of CC in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The performance of the mixed refrigerant (MR) Joule–Thomson cooler is mainly dependent on the MR circulation composition for a given hardware. However, it is difficult to charge the MR to the desired circulation composition, due to the composition shift. In the present study, a novel strategy was proposed to solve this problem. In this strategy, the MR Joule–Thomson cooler is first charged with the initial charge amount, which is obtained by estimating the MR inventory in the cooler using the homogeneous model. Afterwards, the cooler is started and the MR circulation composition is adjusted to the corresponding optimal composition by adding the MR charge amount stepwise. Additionally, this strategy was verified by an experiment with a ternary mixture of methane, ethane and i-butane. The experimental results indicated that the MR circulation composition was able to be adjusted to the corresponding optimal circulation composition approximately within the relative deviation of ±5%.",

In addition,alveolo-arterial oxygen difference(A-aDO2) in pulmonary gas exchange function was calculated by obtaining arterial blood gas samples before and after ECC.RESULTS There were no differences in preoperative parameters between two groups.After ECC,the levels of PMNE increased in both groups over baseline values(P<0.01).The levels of PMNE,in U group were significantly lower than those in C group(P<0.05).No significant differences in CD62p expression between the 2 groups during ECC were found.AaDO2 in U group significantly decreased compared with C group(P<0.05) and the duration of mechanical ventilation was shorter than C group(P<0.05).CONCLUSION Results suggest that ulinastatin may inhibit PMNE release,reduce reperfusion lung injury and preserve pulmonary function but it fails to inhibit platelet activation and to prevent blood loss during ECC.",

The trace points on rolled pieces were researched by FEM software DEFORM-3D 6. 0 cross wedge rolling under different technological parameter. The experiments using different technological parameters were done on H500 rolling mill. The helical angle of rolled pieces were measured, compared and analyzed. The results of FEM analysis and experiment show that the effecting factors on the spiral groove are the forming angle, the wedge spike round chamfer and the stretching angle in turn. With the increase of forming angle, the spiral groove would strengthen first and then weaken, but it would weaken with the increase of wedge spike round chamfer and stretching angle. The results show that adopting forming angle 28°, stretching angle 8°40'and wedge spike round chamfer 10mm during valve roughcast single cross wedge rolling, it would be not easy for forming spiral groove at the surface.",

The purpose of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of pseudo-ginsenoside GQ (PGQ) after sublingual intravenous administration in rats. Rats (n=200) were given 3.0, 12.0, 48.0 mg·kg 1, and were taken blood at 2, 5, 10, 20, and 40 min and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24h after drug administration. Ginsenoside Rb1 was used as the internal standard. Serum concentrations of PGQ were determined using HPLC-ELSD. By using the mean concentrations at each time point (n=6), pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated for PGQ using a 2-compartment model with the reciprocal of the predicted concentration as the weight factor. The linear relationship between AUC and the dose of PGQ was obtained in the range of 3.0-48.0 mg·kg 1. © 2011 IEEE.",

A novel visual features extraction and representation method based on the Gabor Wavelet transform is presented in order to classify and identify the flotation production condition in terms of the froth appearance. Firstly, the froth images are filtered by a set of Gabor wavelets of multi-scales and multi-directions; then, the statistical distribution characteristics of the amplitude response representation of the froth image are analyzed by the marginal statistical distribution and joint statistical distribution respectively; at last, the corresponding statistical distribution parameters are extracted and generated as the visual features. A great number of images in various flotation conditions with the production process parameters were collected from a bauxite concentrator. The visual features of the froth images were extracted and the flotation production conditions were classified using the unsupervised fuzzy C-mean clustering analysis. The clustering results demonstrate that this method can extract the distinctive froth visual features and the flotation production conditions can be classified with the visual features effectively. © 2011 Chinese Assoc of Automati.",

In the dual-ion ASC, Nb2O5 negative and Ni(OH)2 positive electrodes react with Li+ and OH- respectively in alkaline gel electrolyte to store energy, which is quite different from conventional alkali metal ion SCs and alkaline SCs. The as-assembled flexible device has an extended working voltage of 1.7 V and delivers a capacity of 5.37 mAh/cm2, a maximum energy density and power density of 0.52 mWh/cm3 and 170 mW/cm3, respectively. The device maintains around 60% capacity retention after long cycling up to 1000 cycles. Moreover, our device can light up a LED light efficiently upon fast charging. The proposed quasi-solid-state dual-ion ASC has potential applications in future portable electronics and flexible energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the ability of tetherin, a recently identified antiviral factor, in restricting hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the Japanese fulminant hepatitis-1 (JFH-1) infectious cell culture system. Human hepatocytes (Huh7, Huh7.5.1) expressedlow levels of endogenous tetherin, which could be induced by IFN-α. However, tetherin contributes little to IFN-α-mediated anti-HCV JFH-1 activity. Although tetherin could inhibit Vpu-deleted HIV-1 release, it had negligible activity in restricting HCV JFH-1 release from hepatocytes, which was evidenced by unaffected levels of intracellular/extracellular HCV RNA and infectious virus. The failure of tetherin's anti-HCV activity could not be related to the counteraction of HCV, as HCV infection of hepatocytes affected neither tetherin expression nor anti-HIV function of tetherin. These observations imply that tetherin has negligible activity in the restriction of HCV JFH-1 in human hepatocytes.",

        "abstract": " Willd. (HD) and  (L.) Lam. (HC), two closely related species of the same genus, are both used for health benefits and disease prevention in China. HC is also indiscriminately sold as HD in the wholesale chain and food markets. This confusion has led to a growing concern about their identification and quality evaluation. In order to further understand the molecular diversification between them, we focus on the screening of chemical components and the analysis of non-targeted metabolites. In this study, UPLC-QTOF-MS, UNIFI platform and multivariate statistical analyses were used to profile them. Firstly, a total of 113 compounds, including 80 shared chemical constituents of the two plants, were identified from HC and HD by using the UNIFI platform. Secondly, the differences between two herbs were highlighted with the comparative analysis. As a result, a total of 33 robust biomarkers enabling the differentiation were discovered by using multivariate statistical analyses. For HC, there were 18 potential biomarkers (either the contents were much greater than in HD or being detected only in HC) including three iridoids, eight flavonoids, two tannins, two ketones, one alcohol and two monoterpenes. For HD, there were15 potential biomarkers (either the contents were much greater than in HC or being detected only in HD) including two iridoids, eight flavonoids, one tannin, one ketone, and three anthraquinones. With a comprehensive consideration of the contents or the MS responses of the chemical composition, Hedycoryside A and B, detected only in HC, could be used for rapid identification of HC. The compounds 1,3-dihydroxy-2-methylanthraquinone and 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone, detected only in HD, could be used for rapid identification of that plant. The systematic comparison of similarities and differences between two confusing Chinese herbs will provide reliable characterization profiles to clarify the pharmacological fundamental substances. HC should not be used as the substitute of HD.",

XRD result proves the formation of ZnO with wurtzite structure. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns confirm that the product is single crystal nature. The observations from SEM and TEM reveal that two kinds of products with diameter of micron size, having spheral symmetry and circumferential symmetry, are produced. The possible growth mechanism of the assembled architecture is proposed. It is found that PEG and CS 2 play important roles in the morphological and structural control of ZnO microncrystallites.",

        "abstract": "Since 2004, our institution has adopted venoarterial (VA) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients who otherwise could not be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass and patients experiencing cardiogenic shock and/or pulmonary dysfunction unresponsive to conventional treatments. In this study, we reviewed our experience with ECMO support and tried to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical records of 121 consecutive patients receiving ECMO. Patients were divided into adult and pediatric groups and analyzed separately. Demographics, clinical characteristics at the time of ECMO implantation, ECMO-related complications, and in-hospital mortality were collected. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate predictors of mortality. A P value ≤ 0.05 was accepted as significant. Sixty-eight adult patients and 53 pediatric patients were included in this study. In adult patients, 52 were weaned from ECMO and 43 survived upon discharge. After univariate analysis, ECMO setup location, receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation before ECMO, leg ischemia, hemolysis, acute renal failure (ARF), neurological dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome were associated with in-hospital death. In multiple logistic regression analyses, leg ischemia (OR 14.68, 95% CI 1.67-129.1), ARF (OR 12.14, 95% CI 2.5-58.8), and neurological dysfunction (OR 49.0, 95% CI 2.28-1051.96) were risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Patients put on ECMO in the operating room had a better chance of survival (OR 0.078, 95% CI 0.013-0.417). In pediatric patients, 30 were weaned from ECMO and 26 survived upon discharge. After univariate analysis, age, weight, and eight ECMO complications were associated with in-hospital death. In multiple logistic regression analyses, ARF (OR 24.0, 95% CI 4.2-137.3) was a risk factor associated with in-hospital mortality. A P value of 0.921 and >0.99 was obtained by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and the area under the curve was 0.863 and 0.867 for adult and pediatric patients, respectively. The overall survival rate was 57%. ECMO is a justifiable alternative treatment for refractory cardiac and/or pulmonary dysfunction which could rescue more than 50% of carefully selected patients. Higher survival rates could be achieved by preventing ECMO complications.",

Effects of openings of throttle valves on condenser-evaporator heat transfer performance of auto-cascade refrigeration cycle are studied experimentally. The results show that the exergy loss of condenser-evaporator is the biggest one in heat exchangers of auto-cascade refrigeration cycle, which can be reduced by adjusting the openings of main and tributary throttle valves. There is a pinch point at either cold end or hot end of condenser-evaporator. Effect of the opening of main throttle valve on the exergy loss of condenser-evaporator is more significant than that of tributary throttle valve. There are a set of openings of main and tributary throttle valves that minimize the exergy loss of condenser-evaporator under steady operation condition. © 2011 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.",

        "abstract": "To achieve fine segmentation of complex natural images, people often resort to an interactive segmentation paradigm, since fully automatic methods often fail to obtain a result consistent with the ground truth. However, when the foreground and background share some similar areas in color, the fine segmentation result of conventional interactive methods usually relies on the increase of manual labels. This paper presents a novel interactive image segmentation method via a regression-based ensemble model with semi-supervised learning. The task is formulated as a non-linear problem integrating two complementary spline regressors and strengthening the robustness of each regressor via semi-supervised learning. First, two spline regressors with a complementary nature are constructed based on multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and smooth thin plate spline regression (TPSR). Then, a regressor boosting method based on a clustering hypothesis and semi-supervised learning is proposed to assist the training of MARS and TPSR by using the region segmentation information contained in unlabeled pixels. Next, a support vector regression (SVR) based decision fusion model is adopted to integrate the results of MARS and TPSR. Finally, the GraphCut is introduced and combined with the SVR ensemble results to achieve image segmentation. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets of BSDS500 and Pascal VOC have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method, and the comparison with experiment results has validated that the proposed method is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods for interactive natural image segmentation.",

        "abstract": "Six types of treatment with different contents of urea,potassium dehydrogen phosphate and broad-leaved herbicide(75% tribenuron dry SC or 28% WP tribenuron-ylketone) were applied to the grassland of Elymus sibiricus cv.Chuancao No.2.The results showed that: the mixture affected the quality and quantity traits of root,stem,leaves,inflorescence and other components.The order of the coefficients of variation for stem was density of tillers > eustipes diameter > internode length >stem diameter> eustipes number of each tiller,and the difference among all treatments was very significant for the density of tillers,eustipes diameter,internode length,the length and width of leaf.The sequence of the coefficients of variation for inflorescence was inflorescence thickness > inflorescence width > spikelet number > rate of fertile tiller > inflorescence stalk length > floret number> inflorescence length.Those treatments significantly improved root depth,root distribution and biomass,and the coefficients of variation were 12.42%(P = 0.0006),29.98%(P<0.0001),25.93%(P<0.0001) for height,fresh forage yield and hay yield,respectively.The three types of treatments with 7500g/hm2 urea+300g/hm2 potassium dehydrogen phosphate+27g/hm2 75% tribenuron dry SC,7500g/hm2 urea+27g/hm2 75% tribenuron dry SC and 15000g/hm2 urea+300g/hm2 potassium dihydrogen phosphate+75g/hm2 28% WP sulfinpyrazone were beneficial to forage yield.And the other three types of treatment with 7500g/hm2 urea+300g/hm2 potassium dihydrogen phosphate+27g/hm2 75% tribenuron dry SC,7500g/hm2 urea+75g/hm2 28% WP sulfinpyrazone and 15000g/hm2 urea+300g/hm2 potassium dihydrogen phosphate+75g/hm2 28% WP sulfinpyrazone,seed production of E.sibiricus cv.Chuancao No.2 was significantly increased(P=0.0009).Among those treatments,the species of weed,the biomass of weed of per unit area,the rate of weed to total biomass was lower than those of the control.Overall,the mixed application of fertilizer and herbicides is worth applying widely,because of reducing the number of field operations and management costs,and achieving the dual effect of fertilizing and weeding.",

        "abstract": "Infants are potentially more susceptible to brain injury mediated via cell death attributed to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) especially with prolonged hypothermic low flow (HLF). We hypothesized that a human urinary protease inhibitor (ulinastatin), by its anti-inflammatory effect, would reduce central nervous system (CNS) injury during HLF.Fifteen general-type infant piglets were randomized to ulinastatin group (group U, n = 5), control group (group C, n = 5), and sham operation group (group S, n = 5). Routine CPB was established after median thoracotomy in group U and C under anesthesia. When the temperature of infant piglets dropped down to 25 °C, low-flow CPB (50 ml·kg(-1) ·min(-1) ) was instituted. After 120 min of aortic cross-clamping and 20- to 30-min rewarming, the aortic cross-clamp was removed and finally the piglet was weaned from CPB. Five thousand units per killogram of ulinastatin and equivalently normal saline were, respectively, given at the beginning of and at aortic declamping in group U and group C. group S just received sham median thoracotomy. Venous blood samples were taken immediately after anesthesia induction in all three groups, 5- and 120-min post CPB in both group U and C, respectively; plasma markers of inflammation and CNS injury were compared. Pathology results of hippocampus were observed by light microscopy.Statistically significant differences between group C and U were noted in the expression of inflammatory markers such as IL-10, TNF-α and neuron-specific enolase at 120-min post CPB. Brain injuries were observed in both groups (index cases and controls) and were milder in group U.In our study, HLF CPB on infant piglets resulted in brain injury, and ulinastatin might reduce the extent of such injury.",

        "abstract": "The oxidative stress and inflammatory response play an important role in carbon tetracholoride (CCl)-induced acute liver injury. In this work, sesquiterpenoids from the root of Panax Ginseng (SPG) were prepared, and then the hepatoprotective effects of SPG against CCl-induced acute liver injury were investigated and the underlying mechanism was explored in mice. All mice were divided into four groups: the control, CCl and SPG (2.5 and 10 mg/kg, dissolved in soybean oil, i.g.) groups. All mice were given continuous administration for 7 days, and injected with CCl (0.1 mL/10 g body weight 0.2% CCl solution in soybean oil, i.p.) 1 h after the end of the administration except the control group. Mice were sacrificed 24 h post-CCl injection. The results indicated that SPG significantly reduced the increasement of serum AST and ALT levels induced by CCl-treatment. And the histopathological analysis revealed that SPG treated mice had normal liver architecture and no necrosis. The decreased activities of SOD, GSH and CAT, and increased MDA level were inhibited by SPG treatment. At the same time, the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were significantly decreased by SPG treatment. SPG treatment also reduced the heptic protein expressions of NF-κB p65, COX-2, MAPK p38, ERK and JNK in the liver. These fingdings demonstrated that SPG exhibited strong hepatoprective effect on the CCl-induced acute liver injury, which was related to anti-oxidantive and anti-inflammatory capabilities; and the anti-inflammatory effect of SPG might mediated by the NF-κB and MAPKs signaling pathways. Taken together, SPG might be a potential material for drug and functional food development against chemical hepatic injury.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we assessed the clinical effect of a new transfusion therapy guided by thromboelastograph (TEG) on blood protection. Thirty-one children with severe cyanosis (hematocrit ≥54%), who were diagnosed as having transposition of the great arteries or double outlet right ventricle with or without pulmonary valve stenosis, and underwent arterial switch operation or double roots transplantation, were involved and were divided into two groups. In group F (n=17), the transfusion therapy after cardiopulmonary bypass was performed with fibrinogen administration combined with traditional transfusion, guided by TEG. In group C (n=14), traditional transfusion guided by clinical experiences only was performed. We observed the blood protection effects and recovery conditions of these patients. In surgery, compared with group C, the chest closure time, fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), and platelet (PLT) volume used at closure time had no significant reductions in group F (P>0.05, respectively), and the patients in group F had no significant reductions in the amount of chest drainage (P>0.05). The total PLT and total red blood cells usage were also the same (P>0.05). But during the first 24h, FFP usage in the intensive care unit (ICU) and total perioperative FFP usage had significantly dropped in group F (P<0.05); the mechanical ventilator time, ICU stay, and hospitalization time in group F were much shorter than those in group C (P<0.05). So, TEG was effective in perioperative blood protection. Fibrinogen could be a substitute for FFP to restore hemostasis and improve the prognosis for these patients.",

        "abstract": "In aortic arch surgery, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) combined with cerebral perfusion is employed worldwide as a routine practice. Even though antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) is more widely used than retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP), the difference in benefit and risk between ACP and RCP during DHCA is uncertain. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to compare neurologic outcomes and early mortality between ACP and RCP in patients who underwent aortic surgery during DHCA. PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched using the key words \"antegrade,\" \"retrograde,\" \"cerebral perfusion,\" \"cardiopulmonary bypass,\" \"extracorporeal circulation,\" and \"cardiac surgery\" for studies reporting on clinical endpoints including early mortality, stroke, temporary neurologic dysfunction (TND), and permanent neurologic dysfunction (PND) in aortic surgery requiring DHCA with ACP or RCP. Heterogeneity was analyzed with the Cochrane Q statistic and I(2) statistic. Publication bias was tested with Begg's funnel plot and Egger's test. Thirty-four studies were included in this meta-analysis, with 4262 patients undergoing DHCA + ACP and 2761 undergoing DHCA + RCP. The overall pooled relative risk for TND was 0.722 (95% CI = [0.579, 0.900]), and the z-score for overall effect was 2.9 (P = 0.004). There was low heterogeneity (I(2) = 18.7%). The analysis showed that patients undergoing DHCA + ACP had better outcomes than those undergoing DHCA + RCP in terms of TND, while there were no significant differences between groups in terms of PND, stroke, and early mortality. This meta-analysis indicates that DHCA + ACP has an advantage over DHCA + RCP in terms of TND, while the two methods show similar results in terms of PND, early mortality, and stroke.",

Methods From July 2005 to June 2006, ECMO support for end-stage cardiopathy were performed in 10 patients (6 with end-stage cardiomyopathy, 3 with coronary heart disease, 1 with post heart transplantation). All patients developed refractory cardiogenic shock and/or acute pulmonary dysfunction. ECMO cannulation was performed through femoral vessels.The patients were sedatived or conscious during ECMO. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were made stably during ECMO. Results Mean duration of ECMO was 139 hours (54-416 hours). Eight patients were successfully weaned from ECMO, 6 patients of which survived. Two patients were abandoned for can not weaned from ECMO. Six patients were followed up for 1 year and all patients survived. Conclusion ECMO is an effective technique of treatment on end-stage cardiopathy patients with refractory cardiogenic shock and acute pulmonary dysfunction.It can prolong some end-stage cardiopathy patients' lifes.",

        "abstract": "A one-pot route for coaxial growth of crystallized Co(OH)2 nanowire arrays on flexible carbon cloth (Co(OH)2/CC) has been developed for high-performance bendable pseudocapacitive electrodes. The hydrothermal process is found to result in in situ generation of hydrophilic groups on CC (in situ functionalized), changing its wettability and simultaneously helping the nucleation of Co(OH)2. Electrochemical tests evidence that the Co(OH)2/CC can function as a high-performance electrode with a high areal capacitance up to ∼1.13 F cm-2, excellent cycling performance (nearly 100% capacitance retention after programmed 4000 cycles) and good rate capability (retaining 46.7% of its maximum capacitance at a high current density of 40.8 mA cm-2). More importantly, detailed bending tests further demonstrate that the electrode possesses a good mechanical endurance. Even with an extreme bending radius, the majority of the nanowire arrays can still survive and the electrode shows small changes in capacitance (only 7.5% loss) and impendance (<11%) compared to the unbent state. The unique mechanical merits of array architecture for robust flexible electrode design are put forward. Our work provides a direct strategy to grow ordered nanoarray energy storage electrodes with in situ functionalization of the current collector to achieve robust mechanical and electrical adhesion.",

        "abstract": "The pulp pH value is an important controlled variable for process operation in mineral flotation process, which is controlled through regularly adjusting reagent dosage by experienced workers according to the pH measurement results of the current pulp samples. However, due to the influence of the subjectivity and casualness of workers and the long time-lag between the pH measurement of the pulp sample and the reagent adjustment, the pH value of the pulp fluctuates frequently, causing unstable and undesirable production states for mineral flotation. A novel pH control method is proposed to maintain the pulp pH value at an expected production state based on the froth visual information. Firstly, a pH prediction model and a pH control model are built by froth visual information based on the adaptive genetic hybrid neural network (AG-HNN) and adaptive genetic PID (AG-PID) control method, respectively; and then the dosage is adjusted according to the pH value prediction model and the pH control model. Several industrial-scale experiments demonstrate that this method can maintain the pH value of the pulp in an expected range and consequently improve the flotation performance effectively.",

It is found that the growth of ZnO nanorod arrays with different densities, diameters and morphologies is dependent on the ammonia concentration and zinc precursor. The different morphologies of the ZnO nanostructures attained with or without adding Zn 2+ -contained salt in the alkaline solution are compared in the paper. The possible growth mechanism concerning the growth of the different ZnO nanocrystal morphologies is also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Acute preoperative plateletpheresis (APP), cell salvage (CS) technique, and the use of aprotinin have been individually reported to be effective in reducing blood loss and blood component transfusion while improving hematological profiles in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In this prospective randomized clinical study, the efficacy of these combined approaches on reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements was evaluated. Seventy patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were randomly divided into four groups: a control group (group I, n = 10) did not receive any of the previously mentioned approaches. An APP and CS group (group II, n = 20) experienced APP in which preoperative platelet-rich plasma was collected and reinfused after reversal of heparin, along with the cell salvage technique throughout surgery. The third group (group III, n = 22) received aprotinin in which 5,000,000 KIU Trasylol was applied during surgery, and a combination group (group IV, n = 18) was treated with all three approaches, i.e., APP, CS, and aprotinin. Compared with group I (896+/-278 mL), the postoperative total blood loss was significantly reduced in groups II, III, and IV (468+/-136, 388+/-122, 202+/-81 mL, respectively, p < 0.05). The requirements of packed red blood cells in the three approached groups (153+/-63, 105+/-178, 0+/-0 mL, respectively) also were reduced when compared with group I (343+/-118 mL, p < 0.05). In group I, six patients (6/10) received fresh-frozen plasma and three patients (3/10) received platelet transfusion, whereas no patients in the other three groups required fresh-frozen plasma and platelet. In conclusion, both plateletpheresis concomitant with cell salvage and aprotinin contribute to the improvement of postoperative hemostasis, and the combination of these two approaches could minimize postoperative blood loss and requirement.",

        "abstract": "Drug-related hepatotoxicity has become a serious social issue nowadays. Acetaminophen (APAP) was widely used in clinical treatment, although commonly acknowledged that it is a general material that caused drug-related hepatotoxicity. In this study, triterpenoids (Trds) which are mainly composed of ursolic acid and oleanolic acid, were isolated and prepared from fruits of Sorbus pohuashanensis. Further, the effect of Trds against APAP-induced liver injury and the pharmacological mechanism were investigated. The results showed that Trds treatment significantly restrained the increase of serum aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, as well as evidently reversed the decrease of hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT) levels induced by APAP. There are further evidences provided by liver histopathology which demonstrated Trds treatment observably inhibited hepatic tissues necrosis, hemorrhage and infiltration of inflammatory cell induced by APAP. According to the results of western-blot and RT-PCR, the over-expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were inhibited by Trds. Moreover, Trds also effectively restrained APAP-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family signals such as p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). These results demonstrated the liver-protection effects that Trds exhibited were related to its property of anti-oxidantion and anti-inflammation.",

We aim to report our experience with biventricular repair of this anomaly in proposing an original surgical management that simplifies the anatomical correction.From January 2005 to December 2013, 75 consecutive patients with DORVncVSD who had undergone biventricular repair in our institution were retrospectively included. The patients were divided into 2 groups: 40 patients in Group A had the ventricular septal defect rerouted to the aorta, and 35 patients in Group B had the ventricular septal defect rerouted to the pulmonary artery. Concomitant tricuspid procedures, conal resection and ventricular septal defect enlargement were used to favour intracardiac tunnel geometry.Five types of biventricular repair and 16 concomitant procedures were performed. Mean age at biventricular repair was 2.2 ± 2.0 years. There were 6 (8.0%) early deaths and 4 (6.1%) early intracardiac baffle obstructions. During the 4.1 ± 4.0 years follow-up, 3 (4.3%) late deaths occurred with an 87.1% estimated overall survival at 5 years (early deaths included). Six late-onset intracardiac tunnel obstructions were noted and three of them required reoperation. Comparing the 2 groups, Group A patients have more late-onset (6 in Group A vs 0 in Group B, P = 0.026) and overall tunnel obstructions (10 in Group A vs 0 in Group B, P = 0.001). Concomitant tricuspid procedures significantly reduced intracardiac obstruction (0 in 16 vs 10 in 24, P = 0.003) without development of any tricuspid regurgitation and stenosis.Using appropriate intracardiac tunnel establishment strategy and techniques, biventricular repair of DORVncVSD is feasible with encouraging outcomes. Concomitant tricuspid procedures can reduce intracardiac tunnel geometry without increase of mortality and morbidity.",

        "abstract": "It is well documented that lower pump flow during clinical cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) procedures may be significantly detrimental to tissues and organs. The major cause of hypoperfusion is due to shunting flow existing in the closed CPB circuits. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate various shunting flow conditions in a simulated adult CPB model under normothermia.The pseudo adult patient undergoing CPB was established with an extracorporeal circuit. The pre-oxygenator flow, post-filter flow and purge line pressure were recorded. The temperature of the circuit was kept around 36°C using a heat-cooler. The pseudo patient was subjected to five pump flow rates ranging from 3000 to 5000 ml/min (500 ml/min increments), and post-filter pressure was varied from 120-220 mmHg (20 mmHg increments) using a single, static roller pump. Four different shunting states were measured with two flowmeters.When the pump flow was constant, the percentage of shunting flow increased as the post-filter pressure increased in State 1. However, when the post-filter pressure was constant, the trend of the shunting flow was the opposite. Purge line pressure increased with the increase of the post-filter pressure at a constant pump flow rate in State 1. The shunting flow for State 2 was the largest of the four states. The shunting flow for State 3 was similar to State 4.During different states of shunt opening, varying degrees of blood flow were diverted away from the arterial line. Shunting of blood flow may, therefore, result in hypoperfusion in the patient.",

        "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease. The inflammation in joint tissue and system endanger the human health seriously. Methotrexate have exhibited a satisfactory therapeutic effect in clinical practice. The aim of this research was to establish the pharmacological mechanism of methotrexate on RA therapy. Collagen induced arthritic rats were used to identify how methotrexate alleviates inflammation in vivo. Lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory proliferation in macrophages was also be detected in vitro. The activation level of Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and Nucleotide binding domain and leucine-rich repeat pyrin 3 domain (NLRP3)/Caspase-1 and related cytokines were examined by real-time PCR and western blotting or quantified with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Comprehensive metabolomics analysis was performed to identify the alteration of metabolites. Results showed that treating with methotrexate could alleviate the inflammatory condition, downregulate the activation of NF-κB and NLRP3/Caspase-1 inflammatory pathways and reduce the level of related cytokines. Docking interaction between methotrexate and caspase-1 was visualized as six H-bonds indicating a potential inhibitory effect. Metabolomics analysis reported three perturbed metabolic inflammation related pathways including arachidonic acid, linoleic acid and sphingolipid metabolism. These findings indicated that methotrexate could inhibit the onset of inflammation in joint tissue by suppressing the activation of NF-κB and NLRP3/Caspase-1 pathways and regulating the inflammation related metabolic networks.",

A screening analysis based on a UNIFI platform was first carried out to discuss the similarities. Next, untargeted metabolomic analysis based on multivariate statistical analysis was performed to discover the differences. As a result, a total of 122 components, containing 118 shared constituents, were characterized from CML and IML. The structure types included flavonoids, alkaloids, glyosides, organic acids and organic acid esters, iridoids, lignans, and steroids, etc. For CML, 121 compounds were characterized; among these, 18 potential biomarkers with higher contents enabled differentiation from IML. For IML, 119 compounds were characterized; among these, 12 potential biomarkers with higher contents enabled differentiation from CML. It could be concluded that both CML and IML are rich in phytochemicals and that CML is similar to IML in the kinds of the compounds it contains, except for the significant differences in the contents of some compounds. This comprehensive phytochemical profile study provides a basis for explaining the effect of different growth environments on secondary metabolites and exists as a reference for further research into or applications of CML in China.",

In this study,we reviewed our experience with ECMO support and attempted to identify factors which might predict in-hospital mortality.METHODS From 2004 to 2009,121 patients received VA ECMO. We retrospectively analyzed clinical records of these 121 consecutive patients. Demographics,clinical characteristics at the time of ECMO support,ECMO related complications and in-hospital mortality were collected. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate predictors of mortality. A P value ≤ 0.05 was accepted as significant. RESULTS 82 patients were weaned off ECMO and 69 patients survived and discharged. The overall survival was 57%. Any ECMO related complication,renal failure and infection were risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION ECMO is a justifiable alternative treatment for cardiac and pulmonary failure after cardiac surgery which could rescue about 60 percent of otherwise fatal patients.",

        "abstract": "Co-Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanowall arrays (NWAs) have been grown directly from a flexible alloy substrate by a facile hydrothermal method. An ultrasonication test of 30 min towards the as-made Co-Fe LDH NWAs has demonstrated their ultra-robust mechanical adhesion to the substrate. In particular, an in situ carbon-source coating (ISCC) on the Co-Fe LDH NWAs was achieved during their in situ growing process conducted in a glucose-containing reaction solution. After annealing treatment in an argon atmosphere, carbon coated Co-Fe mixed oxide NWAs were evolved from thermal decomposition of LDH precursors and carbonization of glucose, and further investigated as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). When tested, the obtained carbon coated Co-Fe mixed oxide NWAs with improved electrical conductivity exhibited superior electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacity and cyclability as compared to a carbon-free sample and a sample made by the previous carbon-coating method. Our work presents an alternative way to fabricate in situ mixed transition metal oxide nanostructures for high-performance LIBs. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "title": "Abstract A11: HuGEMM-h/mPD1 mouse models for assessing anti-human PD1 therapeutics",
        "abstract": "Background. Blockage of immune checkpoints, e.g. by anti-PD1 antibody, becomes an important new cancer therapy1. Experimental models are important to evaluate new investigational therapy or new combination strategy. Syngeneic mouse tumor models have been widely utilized as an experimental model for testing surrogate immune-oncology (I/O) therapy by using its competent mouse immunity2, but cannot be used for testing human biologic therapeutics, due to the species specificity. The direct replacing mouse therapeutic target by human counterpart in mouse while maintaining the normal mouse immune-functions could be a potential practical preclinical approach to evaluate human biologic therapeutics in vivo.  Methods. We have engineered a chimeric human/mouse PD1 gene (h/mPD1) composed of human exome 2u00263 and mouse exome 1u00264. We expressed the recombinant proteins and tested their bindings to their binding partner of PDL1 of both mouse and human origins, and also anti-human PD1 antibody. We knock-in the recombinant gene into C57Bl/6 mouse to create homozygous HuGEMM-h/mPD1 mouse, which is tested for growth of MC38 syngeneic mouse cell line tumor graft and for the growth inhibition by anti-human PDL1 antibody.  Results. Our data demonstrated that chimeric protein h/mPD1 can interchangeably interact with mPDL1 or hPDL1 efficiently as efficiently as mouse PD1, and it also recognizes anti-human PD1 antibody as expected. The binding of anti-human PD1 antibody blocks its binding to mouse or human PDL1. The knock-in mice express the chimeric gene in the T-cells of the engineered mice both in vivo and ex vivo, however at significantly lower levels than mouse PD1 in the wild type C57BL/6 mice (1/10) under induction. When syngeneic MC38 cell line was subcutaneously engrafted in HuGEMM-h/mPD1 mice, the tumor were found to grow significantly slower with increased T-cell infiltration, as compared to those in the wild type mice. MC38 tumor did not respond to anti-human PD1 antibody well either. These observations can apparently be attributed to the low level PD1 and the associated high autoimmunity that also inhibits tumor growth. Interestingly, a specific condition can be artificially created to enhance MC38 tumor growth in the chimeric mice, likely contributed by the enhanced h/mPD1 expression. The enhanced tumor growth seems to also be suppressible, at least partially, by anti-human PD1 antibody as shown in our preliminary study. Currently, we are re-engineering our chimeric gene (version 2) in order to increase their expression to the wild type gene level, so to create a model for more optimal drug evaluation. In the meantime, we are also engineering HuGEMM-hu-CKPT (e.g. CTLA4 PDL-1, OX40, 4-1BB, etc.) for evaluating other checkpoint inhibitors.  Conclusions. Our data suggests the conditioned version 1-HuGEMM-h/mPD1 mouse can be explored to evaluate anti-human antibody.  References  1. Pardoll, D.M.

This novel structure comprises two-dimensional (2D) nanostructured arrays and onedimensional (1D) nanoneedles aligned on their top. The possible growth mechanism has been discussed in details on the basis of time-dependent experiments. The results indicate that the formation of 1D/2D nanostructures results from the secondary growth of Co-based hydroxides on layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanowalls. The precursor materials can be further transformed into Co-Fe mixed oxides by annealing in Argon atmosphere. Then, the nanostructured film of Co-Fe mixed oxides was investigated as cathode for field emission (FE) application. This work presents not only one kind of Co-based mixed oxides for possible FE cathode, but also a tunable pathway to build well-engineered hierarchical nanostructures. © 2012 by American Scientific Publishers.",

        "abstract": "A one-step template-free process for the fabrication of pure, doped, and codoped single-crystal MgBO2(OH) nanobelts in high yield has been presented. The growth mechanism of such novel nanobelts has been investigated on the basis of time-dependent experiments and the crystal structure of szaibelyite MgBO2(OH). Upon excitation with 260 nm ultraviolet light, Eu3+-doped nanobelts show a dominant red emission (615 nm) that is visible to the naked eye, indicating that MgBO2(OH) is a new promising host material for the luminescence of rare-earth ions. With the introduction of Y3+ codopant, the emission intensities of all the peaks are efficiently enhanced and the intensity ratio (R) of 593 to 615 nm emissions increases. The reason for the spectral change relating to Y 3+ modification is also discussed. The obtained red-emitting nanobelts which can be easily made into transparent thin film have great potential in a wide variety of applications such as transparent luminescent layers. The approach presented herein is expected to provide access to additional multicomponent functional nanobelts with or without dopants. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "To review the experience in repair of aortic coarctation with intracardiac anomaly in infants and toddlers.From January 2000 to December 2006, 84 infants and children diagnosed as aortic coarctation with intracardiac anomaly underwent surgical treatment. Mean age of the patients was 13.5 months, with a range from 1 month to 3 years. Mean body weight was 7.3 kg, with a range from 3.3 to 15 kg. Twelve patients complicated with complex intracardiac anomaly. Seventy-two patients complicated with ventricular septal defect and other simple anomaly. Twenty-one patients had hypoplasia of the aortic arch. Sixty-two patients had one-stage repair. Median sternotomy was used to simultaneously repair coarctation and intracardiac defect in 49 patients. Left thoracotomy and median sternotomy were applied to repair aortic coarctation and intracardiac anomaly respectively in 13 patients. Twenty-two patients had staged repair. Operational techniques for aortic coarctation include 42 patients of patch aortoplasty, 30 patients of resection and end-to-end anastomosis, 6 patients of subclavian flap aortoplasty, 3 patients of vascular bypass, and 1 patient of balloon dilation. In all 49 patients of one-stage operation through median sternotomy, selective cerebral perfusion was used in 43 patients, deep hypothermia low flow was applied in 4 patients, deep hypothermia circulatory arrest was performed in 2 patients.There were 8 hospital deaths. The mortality is 9.5%. Among 8 deaths, 3 patients were misdiagnosed.Surgeries for aortic coarctation with intracardiac anomaly have satisfactory short-term results in infants and toddlers. One-stage repair through median sternotomy can be applied to most of the patients. Selective cerebral perfusion with deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest in lower body can protect the brain and other vital organs.",

        "abstract": "Beta-sitosterol belongs to the group of phytosterols, which are active trace components existing in natural plants, known as the “key of life”, and have a steroid nucleus structure similar to cholesterol. Due to the insolubility issue of beta-sitosterol, most pharmacological studies and clinical applications are limited. Therefore, the modification of beta-sitosterol into its derivatives to enhance its pharmacologic activity is viable. In this study, 4 kinds of new beta-sitosterol derivative were obtained by an esterification reaction with beta-sitosterol, organic acids, EDCI and DMAP in dichloromethane. The chemical structures were defined by IR and NMR. Beta-sitosterol and its derivatives were used to carry out antidepressant research in the tail suspension test (TST) and the forced swimming test (FST) in mice. Additionally, the roles of different parts of the central nervous system (CNS) in the antidepressant-like effect of Sit-S, which is one of the beta-sitosterol derivatives, were also investigated. The results showed that the derivatives exhibited a stronger antidepressant activity than beta-sitosterol. Among the derivatives, administration of Sit-S (4 mg kg−1) gave the lowest immobility time in the TST, demonstrating that Sit-S exhibited the strongest antidepressant-like activity. The study into the roles of different parts of the CNS in the antidepressant-like effect of Sit-S showed that agomelatine (40 mg kg−1), haloperidol (0.2 mg kg−1) and bicuculline (4 mg kg−1) reversed the antidepressant effect of Sit-S (4 mg kg−1). This study confirmed the conclusions that beta-sitosterol derivatives broaden the pharmacological effects of beta-sitosterol, Sit-S (4 mg kg−1) exhibits antidepressant-like effects, and this antidepressant-like effect on male adult mice is mediated by the 5-HT, DA and GABA-ergic systems.",

        "abstract": "Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is one of the most effective treatments for coronary artery disease. However, neointimal hyperplasia and ultimate luminal occlusion that is caused by vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration, proliferation and inflammatory response impede the long-term prognosis. The SOCS3 protein is involved in modulating various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, the role of SOCS3 in vein graft disease is still unclear. We found that the mRNA and protein expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, ICAM-1, TNF-α, STAT3, P-STAT3 and SOCS3 were significantly higher in the graft samples compared to normal veins. After transfecting the recombinant adenovirus carrying the rat SOCS3 gene into cultured rat VSMCs or grafting veins in rat, SOCS3 overexpression was found to significantly inhibit VSMC migration and proliferation in vitro and neointimal hyperplasia in vivo, respectively. Furthermore, SOCS3 overexpression inhibited VSMC migration and growth in vitro and alleviated VSMC inflammation in vitro by inhibiting STAT3 activation and phosphorylation. In conclusion, SOCS3 is a crucial physiological negative regulator for vein graft failure and provides a novel target for vein graft stenosis therapy after CABG.",

Sixteen neonatal patients undergoing cardiac surgery were randomly divided into two groups: unprocessed PRBC (C group, n = 8); processed PRBC (P group, n = 8). The CATS was employed perioperatively. Series laboratory and clinical parameters, including levels of hematocrit, blood potassium, blood glucose, blood lactate, acid-base, and total priming volume of PRBC, were used to compare the effect between the two groups. Before CPB, the hematocrit of processed PRBCs in P group was significantly higher than those in C group (p < 0.01), and the concentrations of potassium, blood glucose, and lactate of processed PRBCs in P group were significantly lower than those in C group (p < 0.01). At the beginning and the end of CPB, the hematocrit levels in P group were all higher than those in C group (p < 0.05); lactate levels in P group were significantly lower than those in C group at the beginning of CPB (p < 0.01), and lower than that of C group at the end of CPB (p < 0.05). The total priming of PRBCs in P group was significantly less than that in C group (p < 0.01). Perioperative processing with CATS provided a high-quality RBC concentration, decreased the total priming of PRBCs, providing increased high-quality blood salvage during neonatal CPB procedure.",

Comparative experiments demonstrated that pinecone-like, needlelike rutile TiO2 could be easily achieved by varying the volume ratio of TiCl4 / H2O. The growth mechanisms of TiO2 nanostructures prepared under different conditions and their photodegradation behavior were also discussed. It was found that the flower-like structures exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity in the photodegradation of aqueous brilliant red X-3B solution. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

To determine the inhibitory potential on FXa, the chromogenic substrates method was used. The assay suggested that compounds ,  and  were mainly responsible for the anti-coagulant effect. Furthermore, these three compounds also possessed high thrombin selectivity in the thrombin inhibition assay. Furthermore, Glide XP from Schrödinger was employed for molecular docking to clarify the interaction between the bioactive compounds and FXa.

P.Beauv.(speargrass or cogograss) was rated as the most serious weed in tropical and subtropical areas of world.In this study,I.koenigii and Festuca arundinacea were sowed at the same time to form a mixed community.The root traits,such as the density of root length,root dry weight,root volume,and soil traits,such as soil bulk density,soil water content and pH,in the community were consistently determined at 60,90,120,150,180,and 210 d after sowing.Dynamic analysis of F.arundinacea root and soil traits showed that infestation of I.koenigii had a significant effect on root length density,root dry weight,root volume density of F.arundinacea(P<0.01).In particular,root length density,root dry weight,and root volume density significantly reduced after 60,90,and 150 d after sowing,separately.The reduced degrees of F.arundinacea root traits affected by I.koenigii were ranked as root volume density>root dry weight density>root length density.I.koenigii also had a significant effect on soil water content,soil bulk density,pH value in different levels of soil(P<0.01).After sowing 60 d,the soil traits of 10~20 cm layer mainly distributed by F.arundinacea root system were significantly affected by I.koenigii as effects extended upward and downward.The effect of duration time on soil traits was ranked as: soil water content>soil bulk density>pH value.The significantly declining meristematic ability of F.arundinacea root due to the infestation of I.koenigii decreased soil water content,weakened soil permeability and increased acidity.Over all,the infestation of I.koenigii reduced root activity and absorption ability of F.arundinacea.",

        "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of chiisanoside (CSS) and its possible mechanisms on acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver damage in mice. The serum activities of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the hepatic levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined using the commercially available assay kits. The hepatic mRNA levels were measured by RT-PCR. The hepatic protein expressions of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), MAPK and their phosphorylated isoforms were evaluated by western blot assays. The results indicated that CSS (240 mg/kg) exhibited the hepatoprotective effects by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation on APAP-induced acute liver injury. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory activity of CSS is largely related to the regulation of the NF-κB and MAPKs signaling pathways. These findings suggested that CSS possessed hepatoprotective effect against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in mice.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To analyze the protective value of acidic buffer with/without cyclosporine A(a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition) in isolated rat hearts after cardioplegic arrest.METHODS Langendorff-perfused Sprague-Dawley rat hearts were perfused for 20 minutes with Krebs-Henseleit buffer followed by 30 minutes of normothermic crystalloid cardioplegia and 60 minutes of reperfusion.In the control group(Con group,n=12),hearts were reperfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer.In the acidic buffer post-conditioning group(Low pH group,n=12),hearts were reperfused with acidic KH buffer(pH 6.8) for the first 3 min of reperfusion.In the acidic buffer plus cyclosporine A group(Low pH+CsA group,n=12),hearts were perfused with KH acidic buffer(pH 6.8) containing cyclosporine A(0.2 μmol/L) for the first 3 min of reperfusion.RESULTS Compared with that in the Con group,the myocardial performance significantly improved,cytochrome C released into the cytosol significantly decreased,Bcl-2 immunoreactivity significantly increased,Bax immunoreactivity significantly decreased,sensitivity of mPTP-opening to Ca2+ significantly decreased and the rate of apoptoic myocytes significantly decreased in the Low pH group and Low pH+CsA group.CONCLUSION These findings suggest that acidic buffer or plus cyclosporine A post-conditioning can prevent apoptosis-related mitochondrial permeabilization after cardioplegic arrest.This protection is correlation with improved myocardial performance.But addition of cyclosporine A post-conditioning does not show much better than acidic buffer alone.Prevention of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening by acidic buffer at reperfusion may be a novel target for myocardial preservation after cardioplegic arrest.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale uniform α-Co(OH)2 nanowire arrays (NWAs) with an average length of ̃20 μm grown on pyrolytic graphite (PG) were successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal method at 120 °C. Ultrasonication test was carried out toward the as-made nanoarray products and the result demonstrated their robust adhesion to graphitic substrate. After 300 s of sonication testing, α-Co(OH)2 NWAs could still possess both integrated one-dimensional (1D) nanoarray architecture and good electronic connections with current collector. When investigated as electrochemical pseudocapacitor electrodes, α-Co(OH)2 NWAs exhibited good energy-storage performance in terms of high specific capacitance of 642.5 F/g, good rate capability, and excellent capacity retention. Our work not only presents a cost-effective and scale-up synthetic method for α-Co(OH) 2 NWAs but also holds promise in general synthesis of long arrays of other metal hydroxides/oxide (TiO2, Fe2O3, SnO2, etc.) nanostructures on PG substrate by using α-Co(OH)2 NWAs as sacrificial templates. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",

Results The concentrations of S-100β protein and NSE significantly increased at T4 and peaked at T5(P<0.05).These concentrations were significantly lower in the RCP50 group than in the DHCA group and the RCP80 group(P<0.05),but were not significantly different between the RCP50 group and the RCP25 group(P>0.05).There were no significant differences among the groups in cerebral oxygen extraction(CEO2) at T1(P>0.05);and there were significant differences in CEO2 among all groups at T2(P<0.05).The concentration of CEO2 in the DHCA,RCP25,and RCP50 groups increased at T3,while it declined slightly in the RCP80 group at this time point,but there was no significant difference among the groups(P>0.05).The CEO2 levels in the RCP25 and RCP50 groups at T4 were similar to those at baseline(P<0.05).All three experimental groups had significantly lower concentrations of caspase 3 in the cerebral cortex than did the DHCA group(F=23.54,P<0.01).Compared to the RCP25 and RCP50 groups,the caspase 3 level in the RCP80 group was significantly higher(F=23.54,P<0.01),but there was no significant difference between the RCP25 group and the RCP50 group(P>0.05).Conclusion The optimal RCP flow rate for cerebral protection under deep hypothermic CPB in piglets appears to be between 25 ml/(kg·min) and 50 ml/(kg·min),and may be closer to 50 ml/(kg·min).",

The results showed that α-MG could attenuate LPS/D-GalN-induced liver pathological injury, and decrease the hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) level, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-1β and 6 (IL-1β, IL-6) levels and recovery hepatic glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activities. The results also indicated that α-MG inhibited LPS/D-GalN-induced toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression and NF-κB activation. In addition, α-MG up-regulated the expressions of Nrf2 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). In conclusion, the results indicated that α-MG could protect against LPS/D-GalN-induced liver failure by activating Nrf2 to induce antioxidant defense and inhibiting TLR4 signaling pathway to induce anti-inflammatory effect.",

Singlet fission (SF), an efficient multiple exciton generation (MEG) process in organic semiconductors, is one promising way to surpass the Shockley-Queisser limit of conventional single-junction solar cells. Traditionally, this MEG process has been observed as an intermolecular process in organic materials. The implementation of intermolecular SF in photovoltaic devices has achieved an external quantum efficiency of over 100% and demonstrated significant promise for boosting the PCE of third generation solar cells. More recently, efficient intramolecular SF has been reported. Intramolecular SF materials are modular and have the potential to overcome certain design constraints that intermolecular SF materials possess, which may allow for more facile integration into devices.",

The nanorod array-based biosensor demonstrates high H2O2 sensing performance in terms of excellent sensitivity (379 μA mM-1 cm-2), low detection limit (0.2 μM) and high selectivity with the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant estimated to be as small as 33.9 μM.

Then the photocurrent densities versus applied potentials of BTs, PCTs, and pure TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs) were investigated as well. Interestingly, at -0.11 V and under the same illumination condition, the photocurrent densities of BTs and PCTs show more than 1.5 and 1 times higher than that of pure TNTAs, respectively, which can be mainly attributed to significant improvement of the light-absorbing and charge-harvesting efficiency resulting from both larger and rougher surface areas of BTs and PCTs. Furthermore, these dramatic improvements suggest that BTs and PCTs will achieve better photoelectric conversion efficiency and become the promising candidates for applications in DSSCs, sensors, and photocatalysis.",

        "abstract": "Studies designed to evaluate the association of hyperglycemia and adverse events in pediatric patients receiving open cardiac surgery have yielded inconsistent results. The aim of this retrospective, observational study was to evaluate the effects of peri-operative glucose levels on adverse events in infants receiving open-heart surgery with CPB.From Nov 2009 through Dec 2009, 100 infants undergoing open-heart surgery were enrolled. All glucose values during the operation and intensive care unit stay were documented. Metrics of glucose control, including mean, peak and minimum glucose levels were calculated. Hyperglycemia was defined as a mean glucose above 150 mg/dl. Hypoglycemia was defined as minimum glucose below 65 mg/dl. Multivariable regression analyses were used to determine relationships between these metrics of glucose control and a composite morbidity-mortality outcome after controlling for multiple variables known to influence early outcomes after congenital heart surgery.According to our definition, 43 patients (43%) developed hyperglycemia and 9 patients (9%) developed at least one episode of hypoglycemia. A total of 58 patients reached the overall composite morbidity-mortality end point at some point during the study period. After adjusting the effects of age, cross-clamp time and pre-operative percutaneous oxygen saturation by multivariable analysis, euglycemia, defined as mean glucose ≤150 mg/dl, was found to be a significant predictor for morbidity, with an odds ratio of 5.1(95% confidence interval 1.5-17.5).In contrast to adult critically ill patients, data from the present study did not prove that hyperglycemia was detrimental to infants receiving open-heart surgery with CPB. The existing literature and findings of our present study warranted future clinical studies of strict glycemic control in critically ill children, considering a more permissive glycemic range as a desirable target.",

Our previous work proved that Xueshuan Xinmaining Tablet (XXT) could treat blood stasis through regulating the expression of F13a1, Car1 and Tbxa2r. In the current study, the effect and mechanism of XXT on BSS was comprehensively and holistically investigated based on a metabolomics approach. Urine and plasma samples of 10 BBS rats treated with XXT (XT), 9 BSS model rats (BM) and 11 normal control (NC) rats were collected and then determined by UPLC-Q/TOP-MS. Multivariate analyses were applied to distinguish differentiate urinary and plasma metabolite patterns between three groups. Results showed that a clear separation of three groups was achieved. XT group was located between BM group and NC group, and showing a tendency of recovering to NC group, which was consistent with the results of hemorheological studies. Some significantly changed metabolites like cortexolone, 3α,21-dihydroxy-5β-pregnane-11,20-dione and 19-hete and leukotriene A4, chiefly involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism and lipid metabolism, were found and identified to explain the mechanism. These potential markers and their corresponding pathways will help explain the mechanism of BSS and XXT treatment. This work also proves that metabolomics is effective in traditional Chinese medicinal research.",

        "abstract": "ZnO/Zn-Al layered double hydroxide (ZnO/Zn-Al LDH) hierarchical architecture, a new type of ZnO-based heterostructure, has been synthesized directly on an Al substrate via a facile solution phase process. The firecracker-like heterostructures consist of uniform ZnO nanorods orderly standing at the edges of two-dimensional (2D) surfaces of Zn-Al LDH nanoplatelets. Experimental result obtained from the early growth stage indicates that the underlying Zn-Al LDH nanoplatelet arrays are well constructed with their (00l) planes perpendicular to the surface of Al substrate. We propose that the \"edge effect\" of Zn-Al LDH and the \"lattice match\" between ZnO and Zn-Al LDH are vital to the growth of such heterostructures. The effects of total solution volume and NH3.H2O concentration on the formation of heterostructures are investigated. It is found that other LDH-based complex structures can also be achieved controllably by varying the mentioned experimental factors. Our work is the first demonstration of fabricating intricate ZnO/Zn-Al LDH heterostructures as well as well-defined Zn-Al LDH arrays on an Al substrate, for which several promising applications such as optoelectronics, biosensors, and catalysis can be envisioned.",

        "abstract": "Texture pattern classification has long been an essential issue in computer vision (CV). However, texture is a kind of perceptual concept of human beings in scene observation or content understanding, which cannot be defined or described clearly in CV. Visually, the visual appearance of the complex spatial structure (CSS) of texture pattern (TP) generally depends on the random organization (or layout) of local homogeneous fragments (LHFs) in the imaged surface. Hence, it is essential to investigate the latent statistical distribution (LSD) behavior of LHFs for distinctive CSS feature characterization to achieve good classification performance. This work presents an image statistical modeling-based TP identification (ISM-TPI) method. It firstly makes a theoretical explanation of the Weibull distribution (WD) behavior of the LHFs of the imaged surface in the imaging process based on the sequential fragmentation theory (SFT), which consequently derives a symmetrical WD model (SWDM) to characterize the LSD of the TP’s SS. Multidirectional and multiscale TP features are then characterized by the SWDM parameters based on the oriented differential operators; in other words, texture images are convolved with multiscale and multidirectional Gaussian derivative filters (GDFs), including the steerable isotropic GDFs (SIGDFs) and the oriented anisotropic GDFs (OAGDFs), for the omnidirectional and multiscale SS detail exhibition with low computational complexity. Finally, SWDM-based TP feature parameters, demonstrated to be directly related to the human vision perception system with significant physical perception meaning, are extracted and used to TP classification with a partial least squares-discriminant analysis- (PLS-DA-) based classifier. The effectiveness of the proposed ISM-TPI method is verified by extensive experiments on three texture image databases. The classification results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over several state-of-the-art TP classification methods.",

        "abstract": "Background:  Antegrade selective cerebral perfusion (ASCP) is regarded to perform cerebral protection during the thoracic aorta surgery as an adjunctive technique to deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). However, brain metabolism profile after ASCP has not been systematically investigated by metabolomics technology.   Methods:  To clarify the metabolomics profiling of ASCP, 12 New Zealand white rabbits were randomly assigned into 60 min DHCA with (DHCA+ASCP [DA] group,  n  = 6) and without ( DHCA [D] group,  n  = 6) ASCP according to the random number table. ASCP was conducted by cannulation on the right subclavian artery and cross-clamping of the innominate artery. Rabbits were sacrificed 60 min after weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass. The metabolic features of the cerebral cortex were analyzed by a nontargeted metabolic profiling strategy based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Variable importance projection values exceeding 1.0 were selected as potentially changed metabolites, and then Studentu0027s  t -test was applied to test for statistical significance between the two groups.   Results:  Metabolic profiling of brain was distinctive significantly between the two groups (Q  2  Y = 0.88 for partial least squares-DA model). In comparing to group D, 62 definable metabolites were varied significantly after ASCP, which were mainly related to amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis revealed that metabolic pathways after DHCA with ASCP were mainly involved in the activated glycolytic pathway, subdued anaerobic metabolism, and oxidative stress. In addition, L-kynurenine ( P  = 0.0019), 5-methoxyindole-3-acetic acid ( P  = 0.0499), and 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid ( P  = 0.0495) in tryptophan metabolism pathways were decreased, and citrulline ( P  = 0.0158) in urea cycle was increased in group DA comparing to group D.  Conclusions:  The present study applied metabolomics analysis to identify the cerebral metabolic profiling in rabbits with ASCP, and the results may shed new lights that cerebral metabolism is better preserved by ASCP compared with DHCA alone.",

        "abstract": "The forming process of 4Cr9Si2 martensite heat-resistant steel during cross wedge rolling was simulated by means of rigid-plastic finite element software DEFROM-3D. The efect of stretching angle on the internal quality of work pieces was analyzed on the basis of simulated results. It is found that the center of work pieces endures threedimensional tensile stresses at the beginning of the wedging stage. The increases of the tensile stress maxima and duration time resulting from the reduction of stretching angle lead to a higher possibility of internal deffects. The axial metal flow will accelerate by decreasing the stretching angle,resulting in the decrease of work piece diameter for center symmetry after the wedging stage and the increase of axial force,and finally those factors make the central cross section of work pieces decrease. On the contrary,the surface spiral will increase by increasing the stretching angle,but the influence is not obviously. Rolling experiments were carried out to verify the correctness of the finite element method and the reliability of simulated results.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To observe the impact of myeloid differentiaion factor 88(MyD88) siRNA on the biological activities of dendritic cells(DCs) cultured from murine bone marrow under stimulation by Lipopolysaccharides(LPS), and provide novel ideas and basis of DC’s clinical applications.Methods:Mouse DCs were generated from bone marrow cells and were divided into control group, LPS group and RNA interference group. Control group was added nothing, and LPS group was added LPS at the final concentration of 1 μg/ml. MyD88 siRNA was added in RNA interference group, and 12 hours later LPS at the final concentration of 10 μg/ml was added. All groups were cultured for 3 days thereafter. Immunochemistry was used to detect the concentration of MyD88 and NF-κB. Western blot was used to detect the concentration of MyD88. Flow cytometry and mixed lymphocyte reaction(MLR) was used to detect the phenotypes and functional properties of DCs. ELISA was used to detect the concentration of TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-12 in the supernatant.Results:LPS stimulation increased the CD80, CD86, MHC-Ⅱ on the membrane of DCs and TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-12 concentration in the supernatant. LPS stimulation also increased the MyD88 in the cytoplasm and promoted translocation of NF-κB to karyon. MyD88 siRNA can inhibit all these responess.Conclusion:MyD88 siRNA can suppress maturation of DCs and promote the tolerance-induction effect of DCs.",

        "abstract": "Proceedings: AACR 107th Annual Meeting 2016; April 16-20, 2016; New Orleans, LAThe recent clinical success of novel therapeutics blocking immune checkpoints cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) has fueled an intense interest around immuno-oncology. However, the lack of relevant animal models is a major bottleneck for understanding the mechanism of action and evaluating the efficacy of such therapeutics. Syngeneic mouse tumor models, despite being widely used as experimental models for efficacy studies, are limited by the restricted number of models available and responsive to current checkpoint inhibitors. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of human cancer are effective tools for mechanistic analysis, but they are often not suitable for efficacy studies due to usually un-synchronized tumor progression. Syngeneic allografts of spontaneous mouse tumors derived from GEMMs (MuPrime®) may be used as a new type of immuno-oncology models with the following advantages: 1) their primary nature of “stem cell diseases” and relevant tumor microenvironment mirror the patient derived xenograft (PDX) models; 2) the availability of diverse cancer types and oncogenic drivers deriving from a wide range of GEMMs. We set out to build a library of allografts of spontaneous mouse tumors, including those derived from GEMM, in an immunocompetent host to support pharmacological investigation, particularly of immuno-oncology agents.Recently, we observed the growth of spontaneous cutaneous tumors on the neck of the C57BL/6J-ApcMin/J GEMM, which is heterozygous for the Apc (APCMin/+). Histopathology suggests the tumors are well-differentiated skin squamous cell carcinoma. We subcutaneously transplanted these skin tumors into the syngeneic C57BL/6J mice. The allografts grow well, are serially transplantable and maintain the histopathology of the primary tumor. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that the allografts maintain the original ApcMin mutation, express high levels of HER2 (also confirmed by immunochemistry, or IHC), and present frameshift mutations in both c-met and EGFR. In vivo pharmacological assessment indicate that tumors respond to 5-FU, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, docetaxel, and cisplatin chemotherapy. They is also sensitive to anti-mouse CTLA-4 antibody, and the response is associated with an increased number of tumor infiltrating immune cells, including TILs. Alltogether, here we show that we have established an allograft model suitable for in vivo efficacy analysis of immunotherapy using surrogate anti-mouse antibodies.Citation Format: Gavin Jiagui Qu, Annie Xiaoyu An, Jinping Liu, Davy Xuesong Ouyang, Likun Zhang, Jie Cai, Jean Pierre Wery, Henry Q.

        "abstract": "Lithium metal has been regarded as a promising anode material for next-generation high energy rechargeable batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity, low density and lowest electrochemical potential. However, lithium metal anodes undergo Li dendrite formation during the cycling process, which may cause safety hazards. To address this issue, we herein report a novel electron regulation strategy via a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) wrapped tubular carbon array (TCA) for design of stable lithium metal anodes. The pre-formed SEI layer at the outer surface of the TCA creates higher impedance than the inner surface; this results in selective electron transport along the tubular carbon to/from the current collector, rather than through the SEI layer, so that lithiation occurs inside the ordered tubular carbon, thus minimizing or preventing dendrite growth. With this strategy, a Li metal anode with high coulombic efficiency (98% during 200 cycles) and stable cycling performance (u003e150 h at 1 mA cm−2 with 2 mA h cm−2) is obtained. With this anode, a lithium–sulfur battery exhibits high coulombic efficiency (∼98%) and good cycling stability (942 mA h g−1 at 0.1C after 100 cycles). Our work provides a simple but effective strategy to design stable Li metal anodes.",

This paper presents the numerical and experimental results of hollow valve production using this new method. The most popular production methods are described. Then, this study examines the formation of such valves through CWR-forging. A numerical model of CWR-forging using the finite element method (FEM) is developed to estimate the technological viability of this process. The distributions of effective strain, temperature, metal flow, force, and torque are analyzed as well. In this study, changing the stretching angle (β) can effectively avoid swollen holes. therefore, the forming quality of the workpiece can be greatly improved when the forming angle (α) is equal to 35° and the stretching angle (β) is equal to 5° and 4° in the knifing and stretching zones and the mandrel diameter is 4 mm, respectively. Numerical results are then verified under laboratory conditions. Experimental results are consistent with the FEM results, thus confirming that hollow valves can be produced through CWR-forging.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to report retrospectively the summarized clinical findings from 20 consecutive pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) patients and to investigate the factors associated with mortality. The ECMO circuit system was completely covered using heparin-coating technique, and venoarterial ECMO was used in all patients. Heparin dosage was 4-20 U/kg/h and active clotting time was maintained between 146 and 360 seconds. ECMO was weaned off successfully in 15 patients (75%); 11 of 15 patients (73%) survived and were discharged from the hospital; 4 of 15 patients died of postoperative complications; 5 patients failed to be weaned off ECMO. The percentage of discharged patients was 55% (11 of 20) in this cohort study. Lactic acid concentration of artery blood before ECMO in survivor patients was significantly lower than in nonsurvivor patients (p = 0.009); patient weight between two groups also had statistical difference (p = 0.046). ECMO effectively treats cardiac and pulmonary failure secondary to cardiac surgeries for complicated congenital heart diseases. Early application of ECMO in patients with cardiac and respiratory failure is still the key point of success in preventing vital organs from irreversible damage.",

The results show that rolling in round blank is apt to produce workpieces with defects such as uneven height of teeth and uneven pitch, while rolling in concave round blank can solve the problem of uneven height of teeth. The empirical formula of the ideal diameter for blank rolling is obtained. The helix angle of die is an important parameter influencing tooth quality. The pitches of tooth ends enlarge and the helical mark defects occur when the constant helix angle of the die is equal to that of the workpiece is adopted. When the helix angle is equal to the corresponding angle of instantaneous rolling diameter, the pitch of the workpiece is even and the helical mark defect is improved. Therefore, when rolling helical shafts are in cross wedge rolling, the workpiece with better tooth profile can be obtained with chosen concave cone blank of appropriate diameter and instantaneous helix angle of the die.",

Patients in P group (n=20) received modified cold blood cardioplegia enriched with potassium-magnesium aspartate and maintained concentration of Mg2+10 mmol/L, Ca2+1.2 mmol/L and K+20mmol/L in the final blood cardioplegia solution. Clinical outcomes were observed during operation and postoperatively. Serial venous blood samples for CTnI were obtained before induction, after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and postoperative 6, 24, and 72 hours. Hemodynamic indexes were obtained before and after bypass by the radial catheter and Swan-Ganz catheter.In both groups, there were no differences regarding preoperative parameters. There were no cardiac related deaths in either group. The time required to achieve cardioplegic arrest after cardioplegia administration was significantly shorter in P group (47.5+/-16.3 s) than in C group (62.5+/-17.6 s) (P<0.01). The number of patients showing a return to spontaneous rhythm after clamp off was significantly greater in P group (n=20, 100%) than in C group (n=14, 70%) (P<0.01). Eight patients in C group had atrial fibrillation (AF) compared with two patients in P group (P<0.05) in the early of postoperative period. The level of CTnI increased 6 hours and 12 hours postoperatively, and there was a significant difference between groups (P<0.05). P group also shortened the time of postoperative mechanical ventilation (P<0.05) after surgery.Cold blood cardioplegia enriched with potassium-magnesium aspartate is beneficial on reducing reperfusion injury.",

There were 67 males and 33 females, age ranged from 5 d to 76 years with a mean of (28+/-26) years, body mass ranged from 3.8 to 100.0 kg with a mean of (42+/-30) kg. The inter-surface of the ECMO equipment system was completely coated by heparin-coating technique. All patients were applied veno-artery ECMO and activated clotting time was maintained between 120 and 180 s and heparin usage dose was 5 to 20 Uxkg(-1)xh(-1). Mean blood flow was 40 to 220 mlxkg(-1)min(-1) during ECMO assistant period.The shortest ECMO time was 12 to 504 h with a mean of (119+/-80) h. Sixty-one patients (61.0%) weaned off successfully from ECMO, 55 of them (90.2%) were discharged and 6 died of post-operative complications. Thirty-nine patients could not weaned off from ECMO. Total survival discharge rate was 55.0%. Mean aortic pressure before ECMO in survived patients was significantly higher than that of dead patients (P=0.038). Lactic acid concentration of artery blood before ECMO in survived patients was significantly lower than that of dead patients (P=0.005).ECMO is an effective mechanical assistant therapy method for cardiac and pulmonary failure after cardiac surgery. Earlier usage of ECMO for heart lung failure patient and avoiding the main organs from un-recovery trauma are key success.",

        "abstract": "Postconditioning has been verified to provide cardioprotection and is associated with the state of mitochondrial permeability transition pore. However, there are a few limitations with clinical use of classic postconditioning; therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to study whether inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening with cyclosporine A also provided cardioprotection. Langendorff-perfused Sprague-Dawley rat hearts were perfused for 20 minutes with Krebs-Henseleit buffer followed by 30 minutes of crystalloid cardioplegia and 60 minutes of reperfusion. Control hearts (Con group) were reperfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Postconditioning hearts (Ipo group) were with six cycles of 10 seconds reocclusion separated by 10 seconds perfusion before reperfusion. Cyclosporine A postconditioning hearts (CsA group) were reperfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 0.8 μmol/L cyclosporine A at first 5 minutes of reperfusion. Compared with Con group, myocardial performance was better preserved in CsA group. Mitochondrial outer membrane integrity was preserved, with less cytosolic diffusion of cytochrome C (p < 0.05) and less frequency of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick end labeling-positive myocytes in Ipo and CsA group (p < 0.05). Postconditioning prevented apoptosis-related mitochondrial permeabilization and dysfunction after cardioplegic arrest. Cyclosporine A postconditioning had a better effect than classic postconditioning in myocardial performance.",

        "abstract": "The course of cross wedge rolling forming of the worn shafts was simulated by means of FEM software-DEFORM-3D.For different die convex edge's slope raises,there were five different results of the simulation.Each tooth's height and screw-pitch of the rolled part were measured and their relative errors were gained by calculation,the charts of the relative errors were drawn by means of Origin.The comparison shows that the suitable the die convex edge's slope raise can improve the forming effect.If the slope is too large,the rolled part's instantaneous error will increase and if the slope is too small,there will be a bad error accumulation in the forming process and it is also difficult to forming integrated tooth's shape.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cardioprotection of acidic buffer or plus cyclosporine A in isolated rat hearts after cardioplegic arrest.Langendorff-perfused Sprague-Dawley rat hearts were perfused for 20 min with Krebs-Henseleit (K-H) buffer followed by 30 min of crystalloid cardioplegia and 60 min of reperfusion. Control hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Acidic buffer post-conditioning hearts were perfused with acidic K-H buffer (pH 6.8) for the first 3 min of reperfusion. Acidic buffer plus cyclosporine A hearts were perfused with K-H acidic buffer (pH 6.8) containing cyclosporine A (0.2 μmol/L) for the first 3 min of reperfusion.Compared with the control group, acidic buffer or plus cyclosporine A post-conditioning significantly improved myocardial performance, decreased cytochrome C release into the cytosol, increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased Bax expression, decreased sensitivity of mPTP-opening to [Ca2+] and the rate of apoptosis after reperfusion.These findings suggested that acidic buffer or plus cyclosporine A post-conditioning prevented apoptosis-related mitochondrial permeabilization and provided the myocardial protection after cardioplegic arrest.",

        "abstract": "Cell salvage devices are routinely used to process red blood cells (RBCs) shed during cardiac surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate three commercially available cell saver (CS) devices in terms of erythrocyte function and the quality of washed RBCs during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Thirty patients undergoing CPB were randomly allocated to three CS devices: Group C (Cell Saver 5+; Haemonetics, n = 10), Group M (autolog; Medtronic, n = 10), and Group F (CATS; Fresenius HemoCare, n = 10). Blood samples were collected from reservoirs and transfusion bags. Reservoirs and washed RBCs were analyzed for erythrocyte aggregation index, deformation index (DI) and hematocrit viscosity, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hb), free Hb removal (ΔfHb), glucose (Glu), lactate (Lac), and blood urea nitrogen. After processing, Groups C (P = 0.026) and M (P = 0.032) had relatively higher erythrocyte DI compared with Group F. Group C had lower Δ2,3-DPG compared with Groups M (P = 0.001) and F (P = 0.001). Group F provided the maximum concentration of Hct (P = 0.021; 0.046) and Hb (P = 0.008; 0.013). In addition, Groups C (P = 0.035) and M (P = 0.038) had a higher removal of fHb (ΔfHb), differing significantly with Group F. In conclusion, CS devices use the same theory of centrifugation; however, based on different designs, the function of the washed erythrocyte and undesirable content removal efficiency differs widely from one device to another.",

Herein, a free-standing battery-type electrode of Bi 2 O 3  nanoflake@C on carbon cloth is designed for aqueous sodium ion hybrid supercapacitors. Due to the integration of nanoarray architecture and the conductive carbon, the Bi 2 O 3 @C electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 207 mAh/g at 2 A/g (6C), good rate capability and cycling stability (133 mAh/g after 1000 cycles). With the activated carbon as the capacitive electrode and neutral sodium salts as the electrolyte, a 1.9 V hybrid supercapacitor is assembled, delivering a high energy density of 18.94 Wh/kg. The device can still maintain 72.3% of initial capacity after 650 cycles. The present work holds great promise for developing next-generation hybrid supercapacitors.",

Neutrophils serve as an important component of immune defense barrier linking innate and adaptive immunity. They participate in the clearance of exogenous pathogens and endogenous cell debris and play an essential role in the pathogenesis of many respiratory diseases. However, the pathological mechanism of neutrophils remains complex and obscure. The traditional roles of neutrophils in severe asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), pneumonia, lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis had already been reviewed. With the development of scientific research, the involvement of neutrophils in respiratory diseases is being brought to light with emerging data on neutrophil subsets, trafficking, and cell death mechanism (e.g., NETosis, apoptosis) in diseases. We reviewed all these recent studies here to provide you with the latest advances about the role of neutrophils in respiratory diseases.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the results for liquid water injection (WI) into a cylinder during the compression and expansion strokes of an internal combustion engine (ICE), with the aim of achieving an optimal in-cylinder pressure and improving power output using CFD simulation. Employing WI during the compression stroke at 80° of crank angle (CA) before top dead centre (bTDC) resulted in the reduction of compression work due to a reduction in peak compression pressure by a margin of about 2%. The decreased peak compression pressure also yielded the benefit of a decrease in NOx emission by a margin of 34% as well as the prevention of detonation. Using WI during the expansion stroke (after top dead centre–aTDC) revealed two stages of the in-cylinder pressure: the first stage involved a decrease in pressure by heat absorption, and the second stage involved an increase in the pressure as a result of an increase in the steam volume via expansion. For the case of water addition (WA 3.0%) and a water temperature of 100 °C, the percentage decrease of in-cylinder pressure was 2.7% during the first stage and a 2.5% pressure increase during the second stage. Water injection helped in reducing the energy losses resulting from the transfer of heat to the walls and exhaust gases. At 180° CA aTDC, the exhaust gas temperature decreased by 42 K, 89 K, and 136 K for WA 1.0, WA 2.0, and WA 3.0, respectively. Increasing the WI temperature to 200 °C resulted in a decrease of the in-cylinder pressure by 1.0% during the first stage, with an increase of approximately 4.0% in the second stage. The use of WI in both compression and expansion strokes resulted in a maximum increase of in-cylinder pressure of about 7%, demonstrating the potential of higher power output.",

        "abstract": "We have successfully synthesized single-crystal ZnO nanotubes and tubular whiskers by employing Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, NH3·H2O as the starting materials in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG, Mw=2000) at ambient pressure and low temperature (70 °C). Characterizations are carried out by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, HRTEM) and photoluminescence (PL) measurement. The results show that the as-prepared ZnO are tubular textures, which have average cross-sectional dimensions of 200-300 nm, lengths of 2-3.5 μm, and wall thickness of 80 nm. These tubular products demonstrate a sharp ultraviolet excitonic emission peak centered at 385 nm at room temperature. A possible growth mechanism and the influence of the reaction temperature on the formation of crystalline ZnO are presented. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "To improve the long term outcomes of the surgery for Stanford type A aortic dissection, we performed ascending aorta and total aortic arch replacement combined with transaortic stented graft implantation into the descending aorta for acute and chronic type A aortic dissection.From April 2003 to March 2004, 40 consecutive patients with acute or chronic Stanford type A aortic dissection underwent this procedure. Right axillary artery cannulation was routinely used for cardiopulmonary bypass and selected cerebral perfusion. The stented elephant trunk was implanted through the aortic arch under hypothermic circulatory arrest. The stented elephant trunk was a 10 cm long self expandable graft. Enhanced electric beam computed tomography (EBCT) was performed in each patient before discharge, three month after surgery, and once each year after discharge to evaluate the postoperative time course of the residual false lumen.Cardiopulmonary bypass time was (166 +/- 38) min, average cross clamp time was (107 +/- 28) min, and average selective cerebral perfusion and lower body arrest time was (30 +/- 15) min. The in-hospital mortality was 5% (2/40). One patient died of multi-organ failure postoperatively and another died of cerebral infarction 2 month after surgery. One suffered from spinal cord injury perioperatively. There was no late death during follow up.Ascending aorta and total aortic arch replacement combined with transaortic stented graft implantation into the descending aorta is an effective way in closing the residual false lumen of the descending aorta and might contribute to the better long term outcomes of type A aortic dissection. Our half mortality of 2 patients suffering acute renal failure suggests that this group may be candidates for medical or delayed surgical intervention. Conversely, our 5% mortality rate for those renal intact patients warrant aggressive and expeditious surgical treatment.",

        "abstract": "The forming process of valve roughcasts by single cross wedge rolling was simulated with finite element software DEFORM-3D 6.0, focusing on the stress and strain fields and alternating times of rolled pieces at the center point under different stretching angles. Rolling experiments at different stretching angles were done on an H500 rolling mill, and the area of the centre hole was calculated for each rolled piece. The influence of stretching angle on internal defects in rolled pieces was analyzed on the basis of simulation and experimental results. It is shown that a relatively larger stretching angle can improve the internal defects. Experimental results show that the area of the centre hole decreases with the stretching angle increasing. The stretching angle of 8°40' is propitious to improve internal defects in valve roughcasts produced single cross wedge rolling when the other parameters are invariable.",

The deformation characteristics of the cross wedge rolling (CWR) process of preform hollow valves are analyzed. By using DEFORM-3D software for finite element simulation tools, the process of CWR forming hollow valves was analyzed.

        "abstract": "Simple regional cerebral perfusion (SRCP) or cerebro-myocardial perfusion (CMP) is selectively used in one-stage complex aortic arch malformation repair. This analysis was performed to investigate the effect of CMP and SRCP on perioperative blood product consumption, and to evaluate whether these two strategies have different effects on the clinical outcomes. A retrospective analysis of 284 children with complicated aortic malformation from January 2010 to June 2018 was performed. The overall cohort was divided into SRCP group (n=202) and CMP group (n=82). A comprehensive comparison of perioperative blood product consumption related indexes was performed. Cardiopulmonary bypass time, cardiac arrest time, cooling and rewarming time in the CMP group were significantly shorter than those in the SRCP group (P < 0.05). Chest-tube time was 3.82 ± 1.33 days in the SRCP group compared to 3.42 ± 0.97 days in the CMP group (P = 0.005). Moreover, intraoperative platelet (PLT) transfusion volume (ml/kg) and rate (%) were significantly lower in the CMP group (P < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis found that intraoperative PLT transfusion was significantly negatively correlated with CMP management [OR=0.237 (0.110-0.507), P < 0.001]. And CPB time was independently associated with delayed chest-tube removal (> 3days) [OR=1.010 (1.001-1.020), P = 0.031]. In-hospital mortality and early postoperative adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups. In children with on-pump complex aortic arch surgeries, CMP is more preferable than SRCP in blood protection. However, overall prognosis was not remarkably different between these two perfusion groups. They are both safe and feasible. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of two different ECMO circuit systems in a clinical setting and compare their outcomes. From December 2004 to December 2009, 121 patients required ECMO for primary or postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock at our heart center. We used the Medtronic circuit system in our earlier series (Group M, n = 64), and from July 2007, ECMO was carried out mainly with the Quadrox D PLS circuit system (Group Q, n = 56). We retrospectively summarized and analyzed the data of these patients. The evaluation was based on the comparison between properties of the membrane oxygenators and pumps, anticoagulation therapy, circuit-related complications, and clinical outcomes. Support pump flow rates, platelet counts, and trans-membrane pressure drops (TMPDs) of preoxygenator and postoxygenator pressures were compared between two groups at the time of support established (T1) and support established for 24 h (T2). There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to patient characteristics and pre-ECMO data. The support pump flow rates and platelet counts at different times were comparable in the two groups. The cannulation technique, ECMO duration, and mean heparin dosage were similar in both groups. There were also no significant differences between the groups in mortality or complications related to bleeding and organ dysfunction. Compared with the M group, the Q group experienced less mechanical failure of the ECMO circuit. The Quadrox PLS circuit system showed less circuit thrombus formation (P < 0.045), less plasma leakage (P < 0.001), and less need for replacement of oxygenators (P < 0.001). Furthermore, frequency of hemolysis during ECMO was significantly lower (P < 0.045). In addition, at T1 and T2, TMPDs were significantly lower in the Q group. Our results suggest that both ECMO circuit systems provide similar effects for safe clinical application, but the Quadrox PLS ECMO circuit system demonstrated partially improved biocompatibility in terms of improved cell preservation, lower TMPDs, less plasma leakage, and thrombus formation.",

The results indicate that the velocity profile through the heat transfer surface of the outdoor unit is varied; the maximum velocity is about 4 times the minimum one. The overall heat transfer coefficient is thus decreased by the non-uniformity of the velocity. Moreover, the air conditioner with a 2-tube-row type outdoor unit is better than that with a 3-tube-row type outdoor unit. In refrigeration condition, the former possesses an air flowrate increment of 23.1%, a condensing temperature reduction of 10.1°C and a COP increment of 26.7%, while in heating condition, the evaporating temperature and the heat pump coefficient respectively increase by 5.4°C and 15.1%, and the possibility of frosting is reduced.",

        "abstract": "Studies have demonstrated that systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) remains one of the major causes of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)-associated organ injury during pediatric cardiac surgery. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the effectiveness of methylprednisolone (MP) and zero-balance ultrafiltration (ZBUF) on SIRS during pediatric CPB. Thirty infants undergoing open-heart surgeries were randomized to receive either MP in the priming solution (group M, n = 15) or ZBUF during CPB (group Z, n = 15). All the patients survived. Plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were measured before CPB (T1), 5 min after the start of CPB (T2), at the termination of CPB (T3), the fourth hour (T4), and the eighth hour (T5) postoperatively. The results showed that the plasma concentrations of TNF-alpha in the Z group were significantly less than those in the M group at T4 and T5 (P < 0.05), and the plasma concentrations of IL-6 were significantly less than those in the M group at T4 (P < 0.05); the plasma concentrations of IL-8 in the Z group were significantly less than those in the M group at T5 (P < 0.05). There was no difference between two groups on the plasma concentrations of IL-10. The duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation was (9.6 +/- 0.8 h) in the M group and (7.8 +/- 0.4 h) in the Z group (P < 0.05). This study showed that application of ZBUF is more effective to decrease the level of inflammatory mediators including TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 than administration of MP after pediatric CPB.",

        "abstract": "CNT/Ni hybrid nanostructured arrays (NSAs) are synthesized on a stainless steel substrate through a one-step chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD) method using nullaginite NSAs as starting materials. During the CVD process, the nullaginite NSAs are transformed into Ni NSAs, which can further act as the catalysts to initiate the simultaneous in situ growth of CNTs on their surface, leading to an intriguing three-dimensional (3D) hybrid nanostructure. The resulting ordered CNT/Ni NSAs are highly porous and conductive, which are believed to be quite favorable for electrochemical applications. As a proof-of-concept demonstration of the functions of such a well-designed architecture in energy storage, the CNT/Ni NSAs are tested as the working electrodes of electrochemical capacitors (ECs). After being activated, the composite electrode exhibits both well-defined pseudo-capacitive and electrical double-layer behavior with high areal capacitance (up to ∼0.901 F cm-2), excellent cyclability (nearly 100% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles), and outstanding rate capability. The unique interconnected hybrid structure and virtues inherited from the conductive CNT network and porous NSAs are believed to be responsible for the excellent performance. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.",

        "abstract": "Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is commonly regarded as having a powerful internal protective effect on the organs. The mechanism of IPC is not clear yet, and the controversy over the benefits and protocol of IPC still continues. In this study, we used the sensitive and specific biochemical marker: cardiac troponin-I (CTnI) to evaluate whether IPC as an adjunct to intermittent cold blood cardioplegia (CBC) could reduce myocardial injury, as opposed to simple CBC during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).From May 2003 to December 2003, 40 patients with three vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and stable angina, receiving first-time elective CABG, were randomly divided into two equal groups: IPC plus CBC (IPC + CBC group, n = 20); and CBC (CBC group, n = 20). The patients in IPC + CBC group received two cycles of ischemia (two min) and reperfusion (three min) before myocardial arrest induced by CBC. The patients in CBC group received 10-minute normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) before CBC arrest. Clinical outcomes were observed during and after the operation. Serial venous blood samples were obtained before induction, after CPB, and postoperatively 6, 12, 24, and 72 hours. Hemodynamic indexes were obtained before and after the bypass by the radial catheter and Swan-Ganz catheter.In both groups, there were no differences regarding operative parameters. Compared to the baseline, the level of CTnI increased after CPB, peaked 6-12 hours (p < 0.01). Compared to IPC + CBC group, plasma concentrations of CTnI in CBC group were significantly higher at 6 and 12 hours (p < 0.05). CI recovery in IPC + CBC group was more significant than CBC group at 12 and 24 hours (p < 0.05). IPC + CBC also shortened the time of postoperative mechanical ventilation (p < 0.05) after surgery.Compared to the simple CBC in lower-risk CABG patients, IPC as an adjunct to CBC reduced CTnI release, improved heart function after surgery, and shortened the time of recovery in CAD patients.",

Hence, a new fast template matching algorithm was presented. This algorithm is invariant to arbitrary rotation revolving and scaling, and using macro-block tracking method to calculate the froth motion velocity, the integral pixels velocity characteristic can be obtained; then, the sub-pixels velocity parameters was extracted using the two-dimension Lagrange surface interpolation and the full precise sub-pixel scale froth bubbles motion velocity was gained. The results show that the decrease of froth velocity turbulence degree in the flotation production is able to decrease the detach ratio of the mineral particles on the bubbles and then to improve the concentrate grade and decrease the ratio of minerals in tailings.",

        "abstract": "Wire-shaped asymmetric pseudocapacitors with both pseudocapacitive cathode and anode are promising in facilitating device assembly and provide highly efficient power sources for wearable electronics. However, it is a great challenge to simultaneously obtain high energy and power as well as ultralong cycling life for practical demands of such devices. Herein, a device design with new cathode/anode coupling is proposed to achieve excellent comprehensive performance in a wire-type quasi-solid-state asymmetric pseudocapacitor (WQAP). The hierarchical α-MnO nanorod@δ-MnO nanosheet array cathode and MoO@C nanofilm anode are directly grown on flexible tiny Ti wires by well-established hydrothermal and electrodeposition techniques, which ensures rapid charge/mass transport kinetics and the sufficient utilization of pseudocapacitance. The nanoarray/film electrode also facilitates integration with gel electrolyte of polyvinyl alcohol-LiCl, guaranteeing the durability. The resulting WQAP with 2.0 V voltage delivers high volumetric energy and power densities (9.53 mWh cm and 22720 mW cm, respectively) as well as outstanding cycling stability over 100 000 times, surpassing all the previously reported WQAPs. In addition, the device can be facilely connected in parallel or in series with minimal internal resistance, and be fabricated at the 1 m scale with excellent flexibility. This work opens the way to develop high-performance integrated wire supercapacitors.",

        "abstract": "Rechargeable aqueous metal-ion (such as Li+, Na+, Mg2+, Al3+) batteries are of great importance to enrich safer, cheaper and sustainable electrochemical energy storage technologies. One of the major challenges in developing such batteries is that few electrode material systems are available to achieve prominent, reversible and stable redox reactions in aqueous electrolytes. Here we systematically report that a versatile Bi2O3 electrode material is able to electrochemically store charges in more than ten types of aqueous monovalent, divalent and trivalent metal ion electrolytes. A remarkably high specific capacity (∼357 mA h g−1 at 0.72C), outstanding rate capability (217C; 75 000 mA g−1) and good cycle life (u003e200 cycles) are demonstrated in a neutral mixed Li+ electrolyte. A unique “quasi-conversion reaction” charge storage mechanism that differs from a conventional intercalation-type mechanism is further unveiled (Bi2O3 ↔ Bi0). By pairing with a Li+ intercalation electrode, an aqueous LiMn2O4//Bi2O3 full cell is fabricated, which exhibits stable cycling with a low self-discharge rate and delivers a high energy density of ∼78 W h kg−1, far superior to typical aqueous lithium ion batteries (≤50 W h kg−1). Moreover, even with a relatively high mass loading of 5 mg cm−2 by slurry casting, the Bi2O3 electrode still manifests excellent performance. We anticipate that our work will stimulate the development of diverse electrode materials for aqueous rechargeable batteries.",

        "abstract": "In this study, the protective effects of pseudoginsengenin DQ (PDQ) on cisplatin (CDDP)-induced nephrotoxicity were assessed, with a primary investigation into the mechanisms involved. Our results showed that pretreatment with PDQ remarkably restored levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (CRE), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), and interleukin-1 (IL-1). Meanwhile, PDQ decreased the CDDP-induced overexpression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), cytochrome P450 E1 (CYP2E1), TNF-, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in renal tissues. Hoechst 33258 and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining showed that CDDP-induced renal tubular cell apoptosis was apparently inhibited by PDQ. Western blotting showed that PDQ reversed the CDDP-induced (1) downregulation of Sirtuin-1 (Sirt-1), nuclear-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and Bcl-2, and (2) upregulation of NF-κB, Nox-4, Bax, caspase-9, and caspase-3. In addition, PDQ enhanced the antitumor activity of cisplatin in Lewis lung cancer xenograft tumor model mice. In conclusion, we found that PDQ exerted a renal protective effect against CDDP-induced acute nephrotoxicity via Sirt1/NF-κB and the caspase signaling pathway without compromising the antitumor activity of CDDP, which provides a new potential strategy for the clinical treatment of cancer and presents a new medicinal application of PDQ.",

        "abstract": "The optimal myocardial protection strategy for newborns/infants undergoing congenital heart surgery remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to compare myocardial protection using histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) and cold blood cardioplegia in a neonatal piglet model. Twenty-one piglets were randomized to three groups: the control group (C group, n = 7), a single dose of HTK group (H group, n = 7), and multidose cold blood cardioplegia group (B group, n = 7). Animals in the two experimental groups were placed on hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, after which the ascending aorta was clamped for 2 hours. Immediately after declamping, both the difference between arterial and coronary sinus blood lactate concentrations and the oxygen extraction did not differ between the H group and the B group. At 3 hours after declamping, rise in serum troponin-T and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB levels showed no significant differences between the H group and the B group (p = 0.735 and p = 0.103, respectively). No significant differences were noted in the myocardial lactate content, ATP content, and histopathological score between the H group and the B group (p = 0.810, p = 0.158, and p = 0.399, respectively). Transfusion requirement in the B group was significantly more than that in the H group (p = 0.003). HTK solution provides equivalent myocardial protection to multidose cold blood cardioplegia for the neonatal heart with less transfusion requirement.",

        "abstract": "Many proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins have been involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. As the first identified antiapoptotic protein, apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) is highly expressed in terminally differentiated cells, and its functions and expressions in striated muscles and cancer cells have been widely studied. However, the expression alterations of ARC in amyloid β-induced early hippocampal neurotoxicity are less known. In this report, we not only confirm previous reports that ARC is expressed in the hippocampal neurons but also demonstrate for the first time that ARC is also expressed in the hippocampal astrocytes. Furthermore, we extend the findings to show that, contrary to the time-dependently decreased ARC levels in the hippocampal neurons, ARC in astrocytes is strikingly increased in Aβ25-35-induced early neurotoxicity. Our data suggest that ARC has distinct roles based on cell type and stimuli. Our results provide valuable information for further exploring the complicated functions and related mechanisms of ARC in amyloid-related diseases.",

The results revealed that α-MG (5 mg/kg, i.p.) exhibited markedly antidepressant-like activity, which could be reversed by pretreatment with haloperidol (a non-selective D receptor antagonist), bicuculline (a competitive GABA antagonist), p-chlorophenylalanine (an inhibitor of 5-HT synthesis). Meanwhile, α-MG also effectively increased the brain DA, 5-HT and GABA levels in mice exposed to TST, indicating that the antidepressant-like effect of α-MG might be mediated by the GABAergic, serotonergic and dopaminergic systems.

Nine primer pairs were selected from 64 preparations and then used to analyze the plant materials. A total of 400 DNA fragments were amplified, among which 336 (84.0%) were polymorphic. Genetic distance, from 0.0692-0.4214 among accessions, was calculated by the NTSYS-pc software. A dendrogram was constructed using UPGMA based on genetic distance matrix. Eight clusters were defined at the genetic similarity of 0.81. A two-dimensional PCO plot representing relationships among accessions was also produced by EIGEN, demonstrating the same distribution pattern as from the cluster analysis. Based on molecular analysis, the genetic variation of D. glomerata germplasms was closely associated with ploidy levels and geographical distributions.",

        "abstract": "Three techniques have been developed as the surgical management for patients with anomalies of ventriculoarterial connection, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary outflow tract obstruction (stenosis): the Rastelli, Lecompte, (REV), and Nikaidoh procedures. This study was designed to compare these procedures in terms of hemodynamics of the reconstructed biventricular outflow tract, early clinical consequences, and follow-up.Between March 2004 and September 2006, a total of 30 consecutive patients underwent double root translocation procedures (modified Nikaidoh n = 11, REV n = 7, Rastelli n = 12). In the Nikaidoh procedure, both aortic and pulmonary roots were translocated. A single-valved bovine jugular vein patch was used to repair the stenotic pulmonary artery in both Nikaidoh and REV procedures. The Senning procedure was added for those with atrioventricular discordance.The Nikaidoh procedure was the most time-consuming in terms of mean cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic crossclamp times. The average mechanical ventilation time was significantly shorter in the Rastelli group (63.3 +/- 89 hours) than that in the Nikaidoh group (188.7 +/- 159 hours, P = .016), but not different from that in the REV group (76.4 +/- 112.5 hours, P = .395). Two patients in the REV group and 1 in the Rastelli group died. There were no in-hospital or late deaths in the Nikaidoh group. Postoperative echocardiography demonstrated physiologic hemodynamics in the left ventricular outflow tract and normal heart function in the Nikaidoh group. Abnormal flow pattern in the left ventricular outflow tract was noted in both REV and Rastelli groups. There were no late deaths or reoperations in any group during follow-up.The modified Nikaidoh procedure is a better surgical option for transposition of the great arteries, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary stenosis in terms of physiologic cardiac hemodynamics. Its long-term benefits need to be evaluated with a larger number of patients and longer follow-up.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Transition metal oxides (TMOs) generally suffer severe capacity degradation as the potential anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, since the large volume changes of TMO anodes during conversion reactions result in the collapse of electrode structures. Fabricating specific nanostructures of TMOs has been demonstrated as a successful approach to partially solve this issue. Besides the concern of capacity retention, our previous work has demonstrated that the specific capacities of TMOs can be improved by enhancing their degrees of crystallinity. Therefore, the TMO nanostructures with high degrees of crystallinity are highly desired to achieve both high specific capacity and good capacity retention. However, the high crystallinity and desired nanostructure are usually contradictory in nanofabrication since the thermal treatment will lead to the collapse of a nanostructure. To overcome the obstacle, herein, the polydopamine coating followed by a thermal treatment in nitrogen is first introduced as a confined crystallization strategy to enhance the degree of crystallinity and simultaneously maintain the nanostructure of ZnO microspheres. Electrochemical performance tests demonstrate that the appropriate coating thickness and heat treatment can enhance the specific capacity from 288.0 mAh g −1  of pristine ZnO to 527.0 mAh g −1  of carbon coated ZnO after 100 cycles. The present work provides a good opportunity to develop TMO anodes with high capacities and superior cycling performances by the polydopamine-derived carbon coating and confined crystallization.",

        "abstract": "Objective To explore the effects of using fibrinogen in children with severe complex congenital heart disease on perioperative blood coagulation and impact on the prognosis. Methods Forty severe cyanotic children(hematocrit ≥0.54),undergoing arterial switch operation or double roots transplantation were divided into 2 groups:experimental group(n=20),after cardiopulmonary bypass fibrinogen administration guided by thromboelastography(TEG) combined with traditional transfusion was performed;control group(n=20) only traditional transfusion was performed [fresh frozen plasma(FFP) combined with platelet].The volume of blood loss and allogeneic blood transfusion was compared.And the prognosis of them were also observed.SPSS 13.0 software was used to analyzed the data. Results Compared with control group,the children in experimental group after complement of fibrinogen had significant reductions in the amount of first 24 h FFP usage[(10.6±6.5) mL·kg-1] in the intensive care unit,total perioperative FFP usage[(56.6±17.0) mL·kg-1] and the time of using mechanical ventilator supporting[40.0(25.5-75.0) h],ICU stay[137.0(106.7-161.2) h],hospitalization[21.0(15.3-30.0) d] were significantly reduced in the experimental group(Pa<0.01). Conclusions Fibrinogen can be a useful substitute for FFP to restore perioperative hemostasis and improve the prognosis for the severe cyanotic pediatric patients after complex cardiac surgery.",

First, two Gabor convolution features, i.e. Gabor magnitude texture representation (GMTR) and Gabor phase-based texture representation (GPTR) are captured using the convolution between multi-scale and multidirectional Gabor wavelet function and the froth images And then the distribution parameter of GMTR is characterized using Gamma density function and the entropy of GPTR is calculated; the distributions of GMTR and GPTR in all subbands are considered, and both of them are treated as texture feature parameters. The froth images captured from industrial field were used in experiments; the texture variables were extracted using this method and the industrial production states were clustered using unsupervised fuzzy clustering analysis and recognized using artificial neural network. Experiment results demonstrate that this method can extract the distinctive froth texture in various flotation states and the flotation production states recognition rate is grater than 90% using these texture parameters.",

        "abstract": "We report the synthesis of a novel branched nano-heterostructure composed of SnO2 nanowire stem and α-Fe2O3 nanorod branches by combining a vapour transport deposition and a facile hydrothermal method. The epitaxial relationship between the branch and stem is investigated by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The SnO2 nanowire is determined to grow along the [101] direction, enclosed by four side surfaces. The results indicate that distinct crystallographic planes of SnO2 stem can induce different preferential growth directions of secondary nanorod branches, leading to six-fold symmetry rather than four-fold symmetry. Moreover, as a proof-of-concept demonstration of the function, such α-Fe2O3/SnO2 composite material is used as a lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) anode material. Low initial irreversible loss and high reversible capacity are demonstrated, in comparison to both single components. The synergetic effect exerted by SnO2 and α-Fe 2O3 as well as the unique branched structure are probably responsible for the enhanced performance. A unique six-fold-symmetry branched α-Fe2O3/SnO2 nano-heterostructure composed of SnO2 nanowire stems and α-Fe2O 3 nanorod branches are prepared by combining a vapour transport deposition and a facile hydrothermal method. As a lithium-ion battery material, the composite exhibits low initial irreversible loss and high reversible capacity in comparison to both single components.

        "title": "Large-scale and low-temperature synthesis of maize-shaped ZnO micron flowers with excellent optical properties",
        "abstract": "An experimental procedure is presented for synthesis of maize-shaped single-crystal ZnO flowers on a large scale at 60 °C for 24 h. The morphologies, purity, sizes and optical properties of the products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), standard selected area electron diffraction (SAED), Raman, UV–vis absorption and PL spectra. XRD measurement proved the formation of ZnO with wurtzite structure. The results from SEM and TEM revealed that two types of maize cob-based micro-flowers with diameter of 1–2 μm were produced. SAED patterns confirmed that the product was single crystal. UV–vis absorption and PL measurement demonstrated a high quality of the products. The possible growth mechanism is also discussed. Keywords Nanostructures Semiconductors Chemical synthesis 1 Introduction Wide band-gap semiconductors have attracted a great deal of attention due to their potential applications in short-wavelength ultraviolet lasers and blue-green optoelectronic devices [1] . Zinc oxide, a key functional material that exhibits semiconductive and piezoelectric properties, has important application in optoelectronics, sensors, transducers and biomedical applications. Various ZnO nanostructures, including nanowires [2] , nanobelts [3] , nanotubes [4] , nanorods [5] , nanorings [6] , nanosaws [7] , cage-like [8] , tetrapod-like [9,10] , dendritic [11] , hierarchical pattern [12] , have been prepared by different methods, such as vapor-phase transport process, thermal evaporation and template-assisted growth. However, these methods usually involve high temperatures and sometimes a complicated process, which might result in impurity in the final product. In addition, ZnO nanostructures prepared by these methods conventionally have poor dispersion. In contrast, solution phase synthesis, including microemulsion and hydrothermal growth, has also proved effective and convenient in preparing well-dispersed ZnO nanomaterials [13] . In this approach, it is believed that surfactant-assistance is very important for controlling the morphology and structure. Recently, ZnO nanostructures have been successfully synthesized by various solution phase methods [5,14–18] . ZnO exhibits numerous morphological configurations due to its unique crystal structure and polar surfaces [19] . To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report for maize cod-based ZnO micron flowers in the previous literature, although conventional flower-like ZnO structures were successfully achieved [20,21] . In this paper, we report a rational synthesis of single-crystal hexagonal ZnO microstructures with novel morphology (maize cob-based architectures) on a large scale by a simple and mild route (the lowest temperature of 60 °C and the simplest procedure so far) in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Most importantly, the low-temperature synthesized ZnO exhibits high optical and crystal quality, which will benefit its applications in many broad fields. It was found that PEG promoted the preferential self-assembly of ZnO maize cobs, and pH value also played an important role in the morphological and structural formation. 2 Experimental All of the chemical materials used in our experiments were analytical grade without further purification and treatment. The procedure employed for preparing ZnO microstructures was depicted as follows. First, 250 ml zinc nitrate aqueous solution containing 2.0 g Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O (marked A) was prepared at 60 °C under magnetic stirring. Some predetermined amount of PEG ( M w = 10,000) and 1 M NH 3 ·H 2 O were in turn dispersed in 100 ml water (marked B) and ultrasonicated for 10 min. Subsequently, solution B was added dropwise into A to obtain the final mix with a pH value of 7.5. The mixture was continued with heating at 60 °C until the reaction was complete (24 h). Vigorous stirring was maintained throughout the entire process. After the reaction, the precipitation was filtered out, washed several times with alcohol and water, and then dried at 60 °C under air atmosphere. Two other comparative experiments were also performed to examine the growth mechanism. While other conditions were kept the same, the first was with a pH value of 9.5 just by adding more NH 3 ·H 2 O, and the second was carried out at the pH value of 7.5 without PEG. The phase purity of the as-prepared products was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a Y-2000 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation ( λ = 0.15418 nm). The Raman spectrum was obtained on a Renishaw 1000 Raman spectroscope (Ar ion laser, 514.5 nm). Scanning electron microscopy images were obtained on a JSM-6700F microscope. Transmission electron microscopy observations were carried out on a JEOL 100 CXII in bright field and selected area electron diffraction modes. Room temperature UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on UV-2550 spectrophotometer and continues wave (cw) He–Cd (325 nm) laser, respectively. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows a typical XRD pattern of the as-prepared product at the pH value of 7.5 in the presence of PEG. All the diffraction peaks can be indexed within the experimental error as a wurtzite structure of ZnO ( a = 0.324982 nm and c = 0.520661 nm). The rather stronger (0 0 2) peak compared with a standard spectrum suggests that the structure of ZnO has a preferential orientation along (0 0 2). In addition, no characteristic peaks of impurities were detected. Fig. 2 shows a Raman spectrum of the ZnO crystals prepared at the pH value of 7.5 with PEG (excited with an Ar ion laser at 514.5 nm). All observed spectroscopic peaks could be assigned to a wurtzite ZnO structure according to the literature values [18,22] , which are listed in the insert of Fig. 2 . Fig. 3 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the above-mentioned products. The lower magnification images indicate that ZnO microcrystals highly disperse in the space without any aggregation and have approximately uniform morphologies ( Fig. 3 a and b). From the higher magnification image, two kinds of flowers can be clearly seen: one is like lotus with few petals; the other has many petals with urchin-like shape, showing spherical symmetry. A lotus-like structure is shown in Fig. 3 c. The SEM observations demonstrate that the lotus-like flower is in the form of spearhead-like structures of average 300 nm width and of 500–600 nm lengths extending radially from center. The urchin-like ZnO is displayed in Fig. 3 d. The diameter of the urchin-like flowers ranges from 1 to 2 μm with petals of average 250 nm width and of 0.5–1 μm lengths. It can be clearly seen from the magnified pictures that each petal is composed of many small particles with average size of 20 nm. The product structure appears like a maize cob-like flower with respect to each branch and the aligned particle aggregates appear like corns growing on the plant. A representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of two individual flowers prepared at the pH value of 7.5 with PEG is shown in Fig. 4 . The petals of the product can be clearly seen. After long-period ultrasonic treatment, the flower-like structure was not destroyed, indicating the structure was not due to aggregation. The standard selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (insert, Fig. 4 ) taken form each petal is shown to be identical and can be attributed to the [0 0 0 1] growth direction, which demonstrates the wurtzite ZnO with single crystal in nature. The bright and clear diffraction spots indicate a high crystal quality of the maize-shaped ZnO flowers. Fig. 5 a shows the UV–vis absorption spectrum of the maize cod-based ZnO flowers shown in Fig. 3 at room temperature. It exhibits a strong excitonic absorption feature at ∼368 nm, which is blue shifted of ∼7 nm with respect to the bulk absorption of 375 nm [23] . Fig. 5 b reveals the room temperature PL spectra of the ZnO flowers shown in Fig. 3 . A strong UV emission at ∼384 nm, agreeing the near band edge emission [4,10,18,19,23] , can be detected. Generally, a green-yellow emission could be observed in the PL spectrum, which generally comes from the recombination of photo-generated hole with electrons in singly occupied oxygen vacancies [4,10,18,19,23] . However, the green-yellow emission in our sample can be neglectable compared with the very intensive sharp UV emission. Therefore, the results of PL spectrum show that our low-temperature growth method can produce a low concentration of oxygen vacancies and high optical quality of single-crystal ZnO maize-shaped flowers. Other result under the experimental condition of pH 9.5 in the presence of PEG is shown in Fig. 6 . Compared with Figs. 3 and 4 , all of the ZnO flowers in Fig. 6 are composed of smooth rods, rather than maize cods, with average diameter of 60 nm and lengths of 0.5–1 μm. The rods in Fig. 6 a have relatively flat tips, while those in Fig. 6 b are with very sharp tips similar to the previous result [20,21] . The SAED pattern [insert, Fig. 6 b] of individual nanorods shows single-crystal structure and the [0 0 0 1] growth direction. XRD pattern [ Fig. 6 c] and EDS [ Fig. 6 d] indicate the rod-based flowers are also pure wurtzite ZnO. PEG also plays an important role in obtaining maize-shaped ZnO flowers. Without PEG, only ZnO nanoparticles with average diameter of 65 nm formed at the pH 7.5 ( Fig. 7 ). In our results, all the obtained ZnO flowers with different morphologies are along the crystal [0 0 0 1] orientation. This is because the positively charged Zn-(0 0 0 1) surface is chemically active and the negatively charged O-(0 0 0 −1) surface is relatively inert, resulting in an anisotropic growth along [0 0 0 1] direction. The crystal formation can be divided into two stages of nucleation and crystal growth [5,21] . In our experiments, at different pH values, the ratios of Zn(OH) 2 and Zn(NH 3 ) 4 2+ were substantially different [21] , which was crucial in the structural development of ZnO crystals. Based on the experimental results, a possible growth process demonstrating the synthesis of ZnO maize-shaped flowers can be simply described in Fig. 8 . When the pH 7.5, there were enough Zn(OH) 2 and a small quantity of Zn(NH 3 ) 4 2+ . Zn(OH) 2 could decompose into a large quantity of ZnO nuclei when the degree of super-saturation exceeded the critical value. However, even if the Zn(NH 3 ) 4 2+ could decompose to free Zn 2+ , the quantity of growth unit (Zn(OH) 4 2− ) was not enough [21] , so the anisotropic growth of ZnO was not favored, only ZnO nanoparticles formed at the initial stage. On the other hand, PEG benefited the preferential growth and particle-assembly in the further development. As a nonionic surfactant, PEG has a long flexural chain when dissolved into water [24] . Under the basic condition, Zn 2+ could link with O atom in the chain of C O C by relatively strong electrostatic attraction [18] . Accordingly, some specific crystal facets of the obtained ZnO nanoparticles, as well as ZnO nucleus with active sites, linked with PEG [14,18] . At the further stage, the growth on these specific facets was restricted due to the strong binding [14,18,25] . On the surface of active sites, the radial accumulation of the ZnO nanoparticles was faster on the unique facets, especially along the [0 0 0 1] direction ( c -axis). In the end, maize-shaped flower-like structure was formed ( Fig. 8 I). The preferential orientation growth of petals has been demonstrated directly by the XRD and SAED results. Without PEG at the pH 7.5, the accumulation of nanoparticles quenched, and only ZnO dispersive particles were obtained ( Fig. 8 III). With changing the pH to 9.5, the quantity of Zn(NH 3 ) 4 2+ was enough, which benefited the generation of growth units (Zn(OH) 4 2− ). Around the active sites, the anisotropic growth of ZnO nanorods along the c -axis took place, resulting in rod-based flowers ( Fig. 8 II). Generally, limited anisotropic growth with a small aspect ratio of ∼2:1 will be obtained in the idealized model of ZnO crystal growth [14] . In our case, PEG also promoted the fast growth of ZnO nanorods by bounding {1 0 0} facets [14] . In addition, the morphological difference in the tips of ZnO rods ( Fig. 6 a and b) might be due to the different growth rates along the c -axis in different reaction sites [21] . More in-depth studies are in progress. 4 Conclusions ZnO micron-size crystals with flower-shaped structures were successfully synthesized by solution phase method at a really low temperature. There were two typical kinds of maize cob-based structures with diameter of 1–2 μm. Experiments shown that the formation of the maize-shaped structures was related to the pH value and PEG. This present 3-D single-crystal ZnO micron flower could have possessed more interesting properties and enhanced their specific uses in optoelectronic devices. This simple method can probably be expanded to produce other semiconductors with novel morphologies.

        "abstract": "Neuropsychological injury after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is one of the most serious and costly complications arising from the procedure. Gaseous microemboli (GME) have long been implicated as one of the principal causes. There are two major sources of GME: surgical and manual manipulation of the heart and arteries; and the components of the extracorporeal circuit, including the type of pump, different perfusion modes, the design of the oxygenator and reservoir, and the use of vacuum assisted venous drainage (VAVD), all of which have a great impact on the delivery of existing GME to the patients. Transcranial cranial Doppler (TCD) has been used for more than two decades to assess and monitor the quality of extracorporeal perfusion with regard to the blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral arteries (MCA) and emboli detection, contributing to the achievement of better perfusion results. The Emboli Detection and Classification (EDAC) Quantifier has been able to detect and track microemboli in CPB circuits up to 1,000 microemboli per second at flow rates ranging from 0.2 L/min to 6.0 L/min. The deleterious effects of GME are multiple, including damage to the cerebral vascular endothelium, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, complement activation, leukocyte aggregation, increased platelet adherence, and fibrin deposition in the micro-vasculature. Improvements in perfusion equipment and in perfusion and surgical techniques have led to a dramatic reduction in the occurrence of GME during cardiac surgery. Although the clinical relevance of cerebral air embolization in causing neurological damage is unclear, every single person involved in perfusion and surgical technology should be aware of the risk of embolization and strictly regulate clinical behavior. Related research should also be done to improve the design of circuit components and clinical practice with a view to eliminating air bubbles during CPB procedure.",

The data of the stress-strain (-) were obtained. Based on the - data, the Johnson-Cook (J-C), modified J-C, Arrhenius and Back-Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) models were established. The accuracy of four models were verified, analyzed and compared. The results show that J-C model has a higher accuracy only under reference deformation conditions. When the deformation condition changes greatly, the accuracy of J-C model is significantly reduced. The coupling effect of  and ε ˙ of modified J-C model is considered, and the prediction accuracy is greatly improved The Arrhenius model introduces Zener-Hollomon (Z) to represent the coupling effect of  and ε ˙ , it has a fairly high prediction accuracy. And it can predict flow stress () accurately at different conditions. The accuracy of BP-ANN model is the highest, but its learning rate is low, the learning and memory are unstable. It has no memory for the weights and thresholds of the completed training. So, there are certain limitations of it in use.

        "abstract": "We report the synthesis of mixed Ni-Cu-oxide nanowire array on flexible metal substrate by a hydrothermal process and subsequent decomposition-related annealing treatment. Every single nanowire is a particles matrix with embedded NiO and CuO grains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that mixed oxides exist in this aligned architecture. As an example of the functional properties of the compound materials, the mixed Ni-Cu-oxide nanowire array is investigated as the additive-free electrode for enzyme-free glucose sensor. Compared with previously reported Ni or Cu-contained biosensors, this Ni-Cu-oxide array electrode possesses higher performance. The detection limit can be as low as 0.1 μM, linear range as wide as 0.1-1200 μM and sensitivity as high as ∼1600 μA mM-1 cm-2. Besides the above, other excellent properties such as anti-interferences and long-term stability, are demonstrated as well. All these improvements can be attributed to the synergetic effect between the mixed oxide grains and the unique 1D array feature. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

XRD, SEM, HRTEM and XPS were employed to characterize the phase composition, microstructure and surface chemistry of LaNiO 3  powders, respectively. Results show that LaNiO 3  has excellent pseudocapacities with the specific capacitance of 478.7 F g −1  at 0.1 mV s −1 , and a good cycling stability of reducing 5.5% charge-discharge efficiency after 15000 cycles. Oxygen intercalation and extrusion mechanism of the LaNiO 3  electrode is also revealed that charge storage in this kind of perovskite pseudocapacitor electrode is associated with the intercalation of oxygen-ion into oxygen vacancies, which is mainly originated from the variation of different valence states of B site Ni in perovskite ABO 3  structure.",

The thickness of the nanowalls is about 15 nm. A possible growth mechanism of the nanowalls was proposed. The effects of reaction temperature, reaction time and the amount of critical agent (Fe3+) on the morphology and crystalline phase of the nanowalls were investigated. Furthermore, the electrochemical performance of Sn film supported on the as-prepared copper nanowalls current collector is enhanced in comparison with that on the commercial copper foil when used as anode for Li-ion batteries with the operating voltage window of 0.01-2.0 V (vs. Li). After 20 cycles, the discharge capacity AR of Sn-Cu nanowalls anode still remained 365.9 mAh g - 1, that is, 40% retention of the reversible capacity AR, while the initial charge capacity AR of Sn film cast on commercial Cu foil was 590 mAh g- 1, dropping rapidly to 260 mAh g- 1 only after 10 cycles. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",

A model of power consumption of chilled water pump is proposed. The effects of pressure difference set point of bypass valve on instantaneous and annual power consumption of chilled water pump are analyzed. The simulation results are validated experimentally, which shows that there is a maximum water flow rate which increases with the increase of the pressure difference set point of bypass valve at equilibrium state. There are three pressure operation regions of the bypass valve: under pressure region, constant pressure region and over pressure region. The power consumption of frequency conversion chilled water pump is affected by the pressure difference set point of bypass valve significantly, and it would be minimized as the pressure difference set point of bypass valve is equal to the pressure difference between supply water and return water of the farthest user.",

Five flow types are identified and a flow pattern map is plotted. Front waves are observed and minimized bubbles are detected, generated from the slug to the churn-annular liquid film. The effects of heat flux, mass flux, vapor quality and saturation pressure on flow boiling are investigated and analysed. For all three tested refrigerants, the heat flux and saturation pressure are found to have a significant influence on the heat transfer coefficient, while the effects of the mass flux and vapor quality are negligible. Eleven existing correlations are comparatively evaluated based on the experimental data. The dimension groups correlation exhibits superior predicting performance, and a new correlation is developed for low heat and fluxes flow boiling in vertical minichannel.",

        "abstract": "Biodiversity is decreasing dramatically with ecological environment deteriorating and human predatory utilization. It has been a critical issue how to protect and study the biodiversity. Hemarthria Compressa is a quality gramineous forage, which is planted in tropical and sub-tropical areas as an excellent grass resource for stockbreeding. In present study, the population component number, distribution, and biomass structure of the cultivated Hemarthria compressa mowing grassland in the different growth period were analyzed. Results show that different curved shapes are seen in the charts among the different parameters. The tiller number of population emerges in an ‘S' shape during the phenophase. In the early regrowth period and flowering period, the number of secondary tiller is larger than that of the first. When the plant height reaches 50 cm, the number of first tiller which determines the forage yield could ascend to a peak of 3640 tiller/m~2. During the booting stage when the plant height is about 80 cm, the number of first tiller drops to 2840 tiller/m~2. Meanwhile, the leaf number of each tiller and of the population are both in an ‘S' shape shown in the chart. The leaf area of each tiller shows a ‘厂' shape in the chart, while the leaf area of population gives a typical double ‘S' shape. In addition, the leaf biomass of each tiller and of the population show an ‘n' and a double ‘S' shape, respectively. The number of stem is approximately the same as that of the tiller, though the stem biomass of each tiller and of the population are not shown in an ‘S' shape synchronously. The aboveground biomass of population is of an ‘S' shape during the phenophase, while the quality of forage deceases linearly. The changes of the component structure and of the number of population reflect the growth stage and the development condition of the population, which decide the distribution of biomass and the econo-mic outputs. Therefore, scientific and reasonable use and management of the cultivated grassland, based on the growth rhythm of the population, is a key project in the future.",

Instead of the mass diffusion effect, this work proposes the concentration fluctuation effect to account for the reduction in the boiling site density. Evidence is provided to support this hypothesis, and a model adopting the fluctuation theory is developed. In addition, experimental tests were conducted to investigate the boiling site densities of i-butane, propane, R134a/R32 and i-butane/propane under pressures in the range of 0.25–1 MPa and wall superheats in the range of 3–25 °C. For the pure refrigerants, the boiling nucleation site density showed a linear relation with wall superheat. Additionally, a correlation is proposed to predict the boiling site density based on the present data. In the case of binary mixtures, the boiling site density first decreased and then increased as the concentration of the high boiling point fraction was increased. The experimental attenuation factors of boiling site densities were calculated for binary mixtures. Qualitative calculations from the proposed model showed good agreement with the experimental data.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Boiling of hydrocarbon mixtures inside plate fin heat exchangers (PFHEs) is most prevalent in many cryogenic processes of petrochemical plants. However, there is very little experimental data and a lack of prediction methods regarding boiling mixtures in PFHEs. This paper established an experimental setup that utilized a single-stage cryogenic cycle to measure the boiling heat transfer coefficients (HTCs) for hydrocarbon mixtures inside a perforated PFHE. The components of the mixtures include methane, ethylene, propane and isobutene. Twenty-seven sets of experiments were conducted under various operating conditions and 261 data points of the boiling HTC were obtained. The experimental conditions cover the mass fluxes of 3.69–19.38 kg m −2  s −1 , pressures of 1.35–5.22 bar and vapor qualities of 0.05–0.77, which are representative of a wide range of actual industrial conditions. The corresponding heat fluxes only range from 55.7 to 3837.3 W m −2 . The experimental boiling HTC varies from 21.4 to 1055.7 W m −2  K −1 , and it is a strong function of the heat flux. Moreover, twelve existing correlations were assessed by using the present experimental data. The results show that the HTCs predicted by Chen type correlations were not consistent with the experimental results, and a new correlation developed from mini-channel correlations was recommended.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To enhance the electrochemical energy storage performance of supercapacitors (SCs), the current researches are general directed towards the cathode materials. However, the anode materials are relatively less studied. In the present work, Fe 3 O 4 -MoO 2  (FO-MO) hybrid nano thin film directly grown on Ti substrate is investigated, which is used as high-performance anode material for SCs in Li 2 SO 4  electrolyte with the comparison to pristine Fe 3 O 4  nanorod array. The areal capacitance of FO-MO hybrid electrode was initially found to be 65.0 mF cm −2  at 2 mV s −1  and continuously increased to 260.0% after 50 cycles of activation. The capacitance values were considerably comparable or higher than many reported thin-film iron oxide-based anodes in neutral electrolyte. With the protection of MoO 2  shell, the FO-MO electrode developed in this study also exhibited excellent cyclic stability (increased to 230.8% after 1000 cycles). This work presents a promising way to improve the electrochemical performance of iron oxide-based anodes for SCs.",

An improved directionlet transform was adopted to decompose the images, so as to promise invariance of the signals and avoid the blurring edge image. The little coefficients between low frequency sub-band after the decomposed severe susceptibility to industrial illumination, multiscale Retinex algorithm was introduced to enhance visual effect by improving brightness uniformity. At high frequency, double-structure elements multi-scale morphology filter method was introduced, which effectively eliminates the noise and preserves edge information. The experiment results show that the proposed method can enhance the edge details of the foam, curb the noise, and significantly improve the visual effect of bubble image. The under-segmentation caused by noise and froth edge blur is solved, which lays the fundaments for extracting foamy morphological features and performance analysis.",

In this work, the contact angle of refrigerants (R134a, R22, R290, R600a, R32) with the metal copper/stainless steel/aluminum has been measured in the temperature range of 0–45 °C. The meniscus liquid–vapor interface of refrigerant was observed through the view port installed on the experimental pressure vessel. Its curve was fitted by Laplacian differential equations. The analysis of Laplacian curve shows that the error of contact angle measurement will increase with the decrease of the contact angle. Comparing the curve fittings of Laplacian and automatic polynomial, the defect of the automatic polynomial curve fitting in prediction area is exposed. The contact angle measurements show the super wettability of the refrigerants in regards to common material surfaces.",

        "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have verified the critical role that antioxidative stress plays in protecting vascular endothelial cells. The aims of the present study were to investigate the antioxidative activities and differential regulation of nuclear erythroid-related factor 2- (Nrf2-) mediated gene expression by Xueshuan Xinmaining Tablet (XXT), a traditional Chinese medicine with the effect of treating cardiovascular diseases. The antioxidative activities of XXT were investigated using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), a PCR array, and western blotting. Our results indicated that XXT exhibited potent antioxidative activities by suppressing the levels of hydrogen peroxide- (H2O2-) induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We were also conscious of strong Nrf2-mediated antioxidant induction. XXT enhanced the expressions of Keap1, Nrf2, and Nrf2-mediated genes, such as glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM), NAD(P)H: quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) in HUVECs. In summary, XXT strongly activated Nrf2 and its downstream regulated genes, which may contribute to the antioxidative and vascular endothelial cell protective activities of XXT. ",

However, the bubble velocity extracted based on digital image processing is often difficult to accurately extract, due to the inevitable rotation, scaling and the collapse of the bubbles deformation and so on. The problem that hard to extract the velocity characteristic of the deformed bubbles was solved by applying the gray template matching fused Fourier-Mellin transform based registration, hence the velocity distribution of the bubble images was extracted accurately in terms of the feature of the bubbles. Then, the relationship between the bubbles velocity turbulence degree and the flotation performance indices was discussed. The method to extract the bubble velocity has been applied on the flotation field of industrial scale for more than two years, which provides guidance to the operator through extracting the velocity field and observing the chaos level of the bubble motion velocity of the bubble images captured in real time automatically. © 2010 IEEE.",

The C@ZnO nanorod array-based sensor demonstrates a very high sensitivity of 9.4 muA muM(-1) cm(-2) and a low detection limit of 0.1 muM. The improved electrochemical properties are proposed to result from the synergy between the carbon layer and nanorod array, which can increase the ZnO electrocatalytic activity and promote the electron transport along the one-dimensional (1D) pathway, respectively. In particular, the carbon layer on ZnO nanorods also improves the sensor stability for successive usage due to the high chemical stability of carbon. The present study demonstrates the facile design of a promising electrode material for a hydrazine sensor and sheds light on the performance optimization of other electrochemical devices.",

In this paper, the onset of heterogeneous bubble nucleation of non-azeotropic mixtures was analysed based on the change in the Gibbs free energy. From the calculated results, the critical radius, change in availability, onset of boiling (ONB) superheat and heat flux were determined. The results showed that the critical radius and the maximum change in the availability of the mixtures was higher than that of the corresponding pure fluids. The ONB superheat first increased and then decreased when the mole fraction of the high boiling point component was increased. In addition, experimental tests were conducted to measure the ONB temperature and heat flux of R124, R22 and R124/R22 mixtures on a copper surface at the pressure of 0.7–0.85 MPa. The ONB superheat and heat flux first increased and then decreased when the concentration of R124 was increased. Additionally, the experimental ONB superheat and heat flux were used to validate the correlations of other models as well as the model presented here. Our model shows much better agreement with the experimental data. Most of the experimental results had an error of +20% to −40%.",

        "title": "Abstract A30: Modeling an immunotherapy of NK mechanism on a NSCLC patient derived xenograft",
        "abstract": "The recent clinical successes of immune checkpoint inhibitors have fueled the intense interest in novel immuno-oncology (I/O) therapeutics. The lack of relevant animal models remains a major hurdle in understanding the mechanism of action and evaluating the efficacy of such therapeutics. Patient derived xenograft (PDX), considered to most closely mimic patient tumors in both histo- and molecular pathology1,2, is however rarely used in I/O studies because it grow only in immune-compromised hosts. In reality, many PDXs grow well in nude mice where certain immune functions remain intact, excluding T-cells/T-cell functions. Therefore, PDX could still potentially be of practical use for studying T-cell independent I/O therapy. This study set out to evaluate a biologics for the treatment of a patient derived xenograft disease, by activating mouse natural killer (NK). NK and CD8 T cells are two major immune effector cell types that mediate cytotoxicity to tumor cells in vivo. One of the immunomodulatory agents, an anti-PD-L1 antibody-based IL-15 immunocytokine, was recently tested as a novel I/O treatment of cancer3. This molecule was engineered to be cross-species for both human and mouse PD-L1 and IL-15 that antagonize PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint-mediated immune suppression and also target the PD-L1-expressing tumor with IL-15 stimulated NK and CD8 T effector cells into local tumor sites, thus synergizing tumor-located anti-tumor immunity. In fact, our previous studies have demonstrated a greatly enhanced anti-tumor activity in the PDL-1-expressing syngeneic mouse tumor models via the mobilization of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TILs), over the PD-L1 antibody alone3. Since IL-15 also stimulates NKs in addition to T-cells, we reasoned that this bifunctional agent could also have potential activity against a PD-L1-expressing PDX in nude mice where NK remains functional. LU1901 is previously described NSCLC-PDX1, and was confirmed to express high level of PD-L1 by both RNAseq and flow analysis, after screening of a large panel of PDXs. We implanted LU1901 in Balb/c nude mice, and started to treat the mice by the bifunctional agent when the tumor reached to 150 mm3. Our result clearly demonstrated a significant inhibition of LU1901 growth by the bifunctional agent in nude mice, in the apparent absence of T-cells. When the treated tumors were examined at the termination, significantly infiltrate NK cells were found inside the treated tumors, as measured by both flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The number of infiltrating NK also statistically correlates to the amplitude of the tumor responses. Together, our data suggest that one of important mechanisms of action of this bifunctional agent relies on the tumor-targeting NK activation, and also that PDX could be a useful model suitable for in vivo efficacy analysis of T-cell independent immunotherapy.

        "abstract": "Hedyotis diffuse Willd. (HD) and Hedyotis corymbosa (L.) Lam. (HC), two closely related species of the same genus, are both used for health benefits and disease prevention in China. HC is also indiscriminately sold as HD in the wholesale chain and food markets. This confusion has led to a growing concern about their identification and quality evaluation. In order to further understand the molecular diversification between them, we focus on the screening of chemical components and the analysis of non-targeted metabolites. In this study, UPLC-QTOF-MSE, UNIFI platform and multivariate statistical analyses were used to profile them. Firstly, a total of 113 compounds, including 80 shared chemical constituents of the two plants, were identified from HC and HD by using the UNIFI platform. Secondly, the differences between two herbs were highlighted with the comparative analysis. As a result, a total of 33 robust biomarkers enabling the differentiation were discovered by using multivariate statistical analyses. For HC, there were 18 potential biomarkers (either the contents were much greater than in HD or being detected only in HC) including three iridoids, eight flavonoids, two tannins, two ketones, one alcohol and two monoterpenes. For HD, there were15 potential biomarkers (either the contents were much greater than in HC or being detected only in HD) including two iridoids, eight flavonoids, one tannin, one ketone, and three anthraquinones. With a comprehensive consideration of the contents or the MS responses of the chemical composition, Hedycoryside A and B, detected only in HC, could be used for rapid identification of HC. The compounds 1,3-dihydroxy-2-methylanthraquinone and 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone, detected only in HD, could be used for rapid identification of that plant. The systematic comparison of similarities and differences between two confusing Chinese herbs will provide reliable characterization profiles to clarify the pharmacological fundamental substances. HC should not be used as the substitute of HD.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effects of α-mangostin against acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver injury and discover its potential mechanisms in mice. Mice were continuously treated with α-mangostin (12.5 and 25mg/kg) by intragastric administration once daily for 6 days, and injected intraperitoneally with APAP (300mg/kg) after 1h of α-mangostin administration on the last day. After APAP exposure for 24h, the liver and serum were gathered to evaluate the hepatotoxicity. The results showed that α-mangostin effectively decreased the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-1β and 6 (IL-1β, IL-6), and hepatic malondialdehyde level; and recovered hepatic glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. Liver histopathological observation provided further evidence that α-mangostin pretreatment significantly inhibited APAP-induced hepatocellular necrosis, infiltration of inflammatory cell and hyperemia. According to the analysis of western-blot and RT-PCR detection, α-mangostin pretreatment validly inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK induced by APAP, which was consistent with the changes of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β levels; the phosphorylation of IκBα and the translocation of NF-κBp65 were also attenuated by α-mangostin. These results provided a new mechanism for the protective effects of α-mangostin against APAP-induced acute liver injury. α-Mangostin significantly restrainted the oxidative stress induced by APAP. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory property of α-mangostin, which is mediated by the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways, also contributed to its hepatoprotective effect. Taken together, we believed that α-mangostin might be a potential material for drug development against drug-related hepatotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate whether the addition of magnesium to a hyperkalemic cardioplegic solution containing 1.2-1.5 mmol/L ionized calcium improves myocardial protection. Twenty-seven coronary artery disease (CAD) patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) received hyperkalemic (20-22 mmol/L potassium) cardioplegic solutions containing 1.2-1.5 mmol/L ionized calcium and were randomized to one of the following groups: Group A (n = 9) received 3-4 mmol/L magnesium cool blood cardioplegia (4 degrees C), Group B (n = 9) received 8-10 mmol/L magnesium cold blood cardioplegia (4 degrees C). Group C (n = 9) received 16-18 mmol/L magnesium cold blood cardioplegia (4 degrees C). The effect of myocardium protection of the three kinds of cardioplegic solutions were evaluated by clinical outcome, cTnI and CK-MB mass. Serial venous blood samples were obtained before induction, after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), postoperative 6 h, 24 h, 72 h, and 6th day, respectively. The percentage of myocardial autoresusciation in group B (100%) was significantly higher than that in groups A (77.8%) and C (66.7%). One patient in group A and two patients in group C needed an interim pacemaker, but none in group B. The period of postoperative mechanical ventilation and ICU stay in group B was shorter than in the other two groups. The level of cTnI and CK-Mb mass increased from postoperative 6 h (p < .05), reached peak in 24 h-72 h, and recovered postoperative 6th day. As compared with groups A and C, the plasma concentrations of cTnI and CK-MB mass in group B were significantly lower at 6 h, 24 h, and 72 h (p < .01). 8 approximately 10 mmol/L magnesium cold blood cardioplegia provides better myocardium protection than higher or lower concentrations.",

        "abstract": "Computer vision as a fast, low-cost, noncontact, and online monitoring technology has been an important tool to inspect product quality, particularly on a large-scale assembly production line. However, the current industrial vision system is far from satisfactory in the intelligent perception of complex grain images, comprising a large number of local homogeneous fragmentations or patches without distinct foreground and background. We attempt to solve this problem based on the statistical modeling of spatial structures of grain images. We present a physical explanation in advance to indicate that the spatial structures of the complex grain images are subject to a representative Weibull distribution according to the theory of sequential fragmentation, which is well known in the continued comminution of ore grinding. To delineate the spatial structure of the grain image, we present a method of multiscale and omnidirectional Gaussian derivative filtering. Then, a product quality classifier based on sparse multikernel–least squares support vector machine is proposed to solve the low-confidence classification problem of imbalanced data distribution. The proposed method is applied on the assembly line of a food-processing enterprise to classify (or identify) automatically the production quality of rice. The experiments on the real application case, compared with the commonly used methods, illustrate the validity of our method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The high-temperature deformation behavior of 5Cr21Mn9Ni4N heat-resistant steel was studied using a Gleeble-1500D thermal simulation test machine for high-temperature compression tests. The deformation temperatures ranged from 1273 K to 1393 K, and the strain rates ranged from 0.1 s −1 –10 s −1 . The height reductions were 20%, 40%, and 60%. The flow stress of 5Cr21Mn9Ni4N increased with increasing strain rate, whereas it decreased with increasing temperature. The high-temperature deformation of 5Cr21Mn9Ni4N began from the strain-hardening stage to the steady-state deformation stage. The characteristics of the stress–strain curves were determined through the interaction of work hardening, dynamic recovery, and dynamic recrystallization. The relationship between microstructure and processing parameters was analyzed. A set of unified viscoplastic constitutive equations based on changes in dislocation density, volume fraction of dynamic recrystallization, and grain size was established to predict deformation behavior and microstructure during a high-temperature working process. The average relative error between the calculated and experimental flow stress was 4.8%. This finding indicated that the constitutive equations could be used to predict the flow behavior of 5Cr21Mn9Ni4N accurately during high-temperature deformation.",

        "abstract": "Acute renal failure (ARF) is associated with increased mortality in pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The aim of this study was to identify predictors of ARF during ECMO in pediatric patients after cardiac surgery. A retrospective study analyzed 42 children (≤15 years) after cardiac surgery requiring venous-arterial ECMO between December 2008 and December 2014 at Fuwai Hospital. ARF was defined as ≥300% rise in serum creatinine (SCr) concentration from baseline or application of dialysis. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the predictors of ARF during ECMO. A total of 42 children (age, interquartile range [IQR], 13.0 [7.2-29.8] months; weight, IQR, 8.5 [6.7-11.0] kg) after cardiac surgery requiring ECMO were included in this study. The total survival rate was 52.4%, and the incidence of ARF was 40.5%. As the result of univariate analysis, ECMO duration, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, maximum free hemoglobin (FHB) during ECMO, lactate level, and mean blood pressure before initiation of ECMO were entered in multiple logistic regression analysis. In multiple logistic regression analysis, FHB during ECMO (OR 1.136, 95% CI 1.023-1.261) and lactate level before initiation of ECMO (OR 1.602, 95% CI 1.025-2.502) were risk factors for ARF during ECMO after pediatric cardiac surgery. There was a linear correlation between maximum SCr and maximum FHB (Pearson's r = 0.535, P = 0.001). Maximum SCr during ECMO has also a linear correlation with lactate level before initiation of ECMO (Pearson's r = 0.342, P = 0.044). Increased FHB during ECMO and high lactate level before initiation of ECMO were risk factors for ARF during ECMO in pediatric patients after cardiac surgery.",

A die of cross wedge rolling was designed in consideration of the instantaneous variation of helix angle and the variation of teeth cross-section. The rolling process of trapezoidal thread shafts in cross wedge rolling was simulated with the finite element software Deform-3D, and trapezoidal thread shafts with high precision were obtained. Radial and axial displacement variations in different sections of the rolled pieces were analyzed in detail by tracking multiple points on the rolled pieces using the tracking function of the finite element method. The metal flow law at different positions on the rolled piece was found out. The trapezoidal teeth profile rolled in rolling experiments performed by using the simulating parameters is similar to that calculated by the simulation software. Simulation and experiment results show that trapezoidal thread shafts with precise shape can be rolled by using the corresponding helix angle of the die to the instantaneous rolling radius.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this investigation was to use combined transcranial cerebral Doppler (TCD) and near-infrared spectroscopy cerebral oxygen saturation (NIRS) during total aortic arch replacement (TAAR) to monitor middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity and regional cerebral oximetry (rSO(2)) changes to provide a clinical basis for protective measures that may decrease injury of the central nervous system. Consecutive 12 adult patients underwent deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) and antegrade selective cerebral perfusion (ASCP) during TAAR. A TCD probe was placed at the temporal windows after induction of anesthesia and the NIRS probe placed on the forehead of patients to collect perioperative, intraoperative, and postoperative hemodynamic parameters, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) and rSO(2) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In this retrospective case series, all patients survived, and there were no postoperative neurologic complications. There was no significant correlation between the mean arterial pressure and rSO(2). The middle cerebral artery mean velocity (VmMCA) and rSO(2) were significantly correlated, and main pump flow significantly correlated with rSO(2). After ASCP, VmMCA, rSO(2), and venous oxygen saturation were significantly lower than before ASCP, but VmMCA and rSO(2) returned to pre-CPB levels postoperatively. After off pump, the flow of ASCP showed a significant positive correlation with VmMCA and rSO(2). During DHCA when ASCP flow was lower than 5 ml/kg/min, TCD could not detect the MCA blood flow signal. When the flow of ASCP was above keeping around 10 ml/kg/min, MCA CBF velocity was maintained and rSO(2) > 45%. The combination of TCD and NIRS can be effective in monitoring brain function during DHCA with ASCP and may provide a guide for decreasing brain injury during the TAAR procedure.",

Keywords ZnO nanorod arrays Density- and adhesion-controlled Flexible substrate Electrochromic performance 1 Introduction ZnO nanorod arrays (NRs), as an excellent member in the family of one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures, have been received increased attention because of their excellent electrical and optical properties. Moreover, it has been found that spectacular applications in fabricating electronic, optoelectronic, electrochemical, and electromechanical devices such as ultraviolet (UV) lasers [1] , light-emitting diodes [2] , field-emission devices [3–6] , field effect transistors, transparent conductors [7] , solar cells [8] and piezo-nanogenerators [9,10] , especially in the field of electrochromic devices (ECs) [11] including flexible and transparent ECs, have also showed considerable merit owing to reversibly changing their optical properties upon charge injection and extraction induced by the external voltage. Due to the ECs’ quick response time and great repeatability, low operation voltage and energy consumption, high coloration efficiency and rich color availability, flexible substrate and large scale but lightness of weight, and long open circuit memory effects, enabled them to possess many potential applications including electrochromic (EC) displays, smart windows, electropapers and electrobillboards [11–14] . It is well known that one-dimensional ZnO nanostructure materials (e.g., ZnO NRs) are excellent working electrodes of the ECs made of one working electrode, one counter electrode, and one ion conductive layer in between because of their large surface area [11] , high crystallization performance and good electron transport properties. Furthermore, ZnO, as a nontoxic n-type semiconductor (Eg = 3.37 eV), is even more attractive for high-efficiency short wavelength optoelectronic nanodevices on account of its large exciton binding energy of 60 meV and high mechanical and thermal stabilities. On the other hand, ZnO is a wide band gap II–VI semiconductor and a cheap and nontoxic material. Utilization of ZnO in ECs may further reduce the cost. However, there are few reports on the fabrication of density- and adhesion-controlled ZnO NRs on flexible ITO/PET (indium tin oxide/polyethylene terephthalate) transparent substrate (IPS), though lots of papers have focused on fabrication of ZnO nanostructures [6,15–18] . In this communication, we embarked on for the first time a study that the large-scale ZnO NRs were grown directly on flexible IPS, especially more attention was paid to investigate the density, occupied space ratio (OSR) and adhesion property to the substrate of ZnO NRs. Meanwhile, relevant kinetics conditions of NRs growth were discussed as well, including concentrations and ratios of the starting reactants, such as zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O) to hexamethylenetetramine (C 6 H 12 N 4 ), and including the growth temperature and time. And then, EC performance study was divided into two steps, modifying methyl viologen and exploring EC performance using three electrodes system. SEM, TEM and XRD were also employed to characterize the ZnO NRs. The novel ZnO NRs grown on IPS have at least three advantages. First, it provides a way to fabricate vertically aligned ZnO arrays on flexible IPS. Second, the flexible substrates could be easily designed into various sizes and shapes, and thus providing tremendous flexibility for ZnO NRs’ applications. Third, these unique advantages make ZnO nanorods a promising matrix electrode for EC dye molecule loading. 2 Experimental All chemicals (from Shanghai Chemicals Co. Ltd.) used in this work were of analytical reagent grade and used as received without further treatments. 2.1 Preparation process The viologen-modified ZnO NRs (VMZs) EC working electrodes were achieved by three main steps. The first step was that a thin layer of ZnO film, about 4–5 nm thickness, was deposited on the IPS as seed using spin-coating or sputter-coating method [11] before the growth of ZnO NRs. The coating solution was obtained by mixing 0.03 M NaOH solution of ethanol and 0.01 M zinc acetate dehydrate (Zn(CH 3 COO) 2 ·2H 2 O) solution of ethanol, the volume ratio is 1–3, and then the coating solution was spin-coated onto IPS at 500 rpm for several times according to the expected thickness of ZnO seed layer [19] , and between every two layers, the seeded IPS was subsequently baked for about 15 min in oven at 50 °C. With regard to magnetron sputtering method, the ZnO seed layer was readily obtained by FJL560 magnetron sputtering equipment, and which was deposited at a distance of 57 mm between target and IPS, a base vacuum of 5 × 10 −4 Pa, a sputtering power of ∼55 W, an argon pressure of 0.5 Pa and ∼80 s sputtering time. Different density ZnO NRs were obtained mainly by adjusting the sputtering time. The second step was the growth of, as we know, the ZnO nanostructure array was hydrothermally prepared using the procedures reported elsewhere [6,20–22] . In our work, the seeded IPSs obtained from the first step were suspended in 300 mL of aqueous solutions containing 0.05 M Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O and 0.06 M C 6 H 12 N 4 in a sealed beaker [23] following by heating at a temperature of 75 °C for 24 h. Changing the molar ratio of reactants, the growth temperature and time resulted in the formation of 1D ZnO NRs with different densities and OSRs. Slight stirring was maintained throughout the entire process. After the reaction, these substrates covered tightly with ZnO nanostructures were rinsed with ethanol and dried in air for further characterization. Finally, the as-grown ZnO NRs of different densities and OSRs were first treated by oxygen plasma for 5 min and baked in an oven at 60 °C for 1 h. Then these arrays were immersed in a 0.02 M aqueous solutions of methyl viologen at 40 °C for 72 h, followed by a wash with 2-propanol to remove the unattached viologen. Subsequently, the VMZs electrodes were dried in air and stored in a vacuumed dark chamber for 24 h prior to use. 2.2 EC performance The VMZs of different OSRs were assembled as working electrodes of the three electrodes system and immersed in an electrolyte containing 0.2 M LiClO 4 γ-butyrolactone solution. Then the EC photographs and EC current potential (CV) curves of the various electrodes were obtained for further research. It is worth pointing out that all the chemical materials and the electrolytes were bubbled with dry N 2 prior to the experiment since the performance of the EC is sensitive to oxygen. 2.3 Characterization The morphology, size and property of the products were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL, JSM-6700F), and the identity and the phase were analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Cu Kα radiation; λ = 1.5418 Å) at a scan rate of 0.06 s −1 . The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observations of the products were all carried out on a JEOL JEM-2010 instrument. The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the ZnO nanowire electrode were recorded by a CHI660C electrochemical instrument, and the test was carried out in a standard three electrodes system (vs Ag/AgCl sat. KCl reference electrode). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Schematic approach and images of EC working electrode Herein, the formation mechanism of the VMZs is schematically illustrated in Part a of Fig. 1 and its corresponding FESEM images in Parts b–e of Fig. 1 (some big cracks in Fig. 1 b and c made for the comparison with their substrates). Part b of Fig. 1 shows the bare IPS. Through the pre-sputtering process on Part b, a thin layer ZnO seed made of little crystalline nanoparticles with a diameter of 10–20 nm was coated on the IPS, as shown in Part c of Fig. 1 . And then, Part d of Fig. 1 shows the ZnO NRs grown using a low-temperature hydrothermal decomposition method. Finally, the VMZs used as EC working electrode is shown in Part e of Fig. 1 . 3.2 Morphology and microstructure The top-view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-prepared ZnO NRs on IPS can be clearly shown in Fig. 2 ( Fig. 2 a, the low-magnification; Fig. 2 b, the relatively high-magnification with two inserts: the regular cross-section and magnificent enhanced images). ZnO NRs is characterized by large-area hexagonal ZnO nanorod arrays with uniform growth density, and it was obtained by using the mixing solution of 0.05 M Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O and 0.06 M C 6 H 12 N 4 at 75 °C for 24 h. XRD patterns of the above-mentioned ZnO NRs are summarized in Fig. 2 c. The strongest peaks are (0 0 2), indicating that individual ZnO nanostructures and crystallized along the c -axis direction are vertically aligned on the substrate. The hexagonal morphology and crystallization along the c -axis direction of ZnO NRs were reported elsewhere [6] . All the peaks can be readily indexed to hexagonal wurtzite ZnO (JCPDS Card No. 36-1451; space group P 6 3 mc , a = 3.24982 Å, c = 5.20661 Å) except for those arising from the IPS (see the enlarged image of the pattern in the insert). In the XRD pattern, the (0 0 2) peak is dominant, and its intensity is much higher than others, revealing the high c -axis growth orientation of the product. Further structural characterization of ZnO NRs was performed by TEM and SAED. Fig. 2 d displays a TEM image of several individual ZnO nanorods. The SAED pattern taken from one of the rods (see the red cycle section) is shown in the insert. 3.3 Study of adhesion-controlled We paid more attention to research on fabrication of the ZnO NRs with optimum density, stability and adhesion to substrate, and to explore a kind of ZnO NRs with optimal density (for better electron transmission capability) and OSR (for superior absorption capability to viologen molecules) to obtain excellent EC performance. The adhesion property of the ZnO NRs to IPS was investigated at first. After 120 times about 150 bending and 25 min ultrasonicating using 250 W and 40 Hz experiment, the SEM morphology images (including corresponding cross-section images) are shown in Fig. 3 b and d originating from those in Fig. 3 a and c, respectively. We can obviously find that the majority of the ZnO NRs using spinning-prepared seeds had been detached from the seed layer and the IPS, and many nanorods were, owing to bending and ultrasonicating process, broken to small parts from the NRs, as shown in Fig. 3 d. In comparison, there were, as for the ZnO NRs grown using sputtering-prepared seeds, few nanorods detached from the seed layer and the IPS even though some were broken to small parts (see the SEM morphology images including corresponding cross-section images in Fig. 3 b). So we can draw a conclusion that the ZnO NRs using sputtering-prepared seed layers shows superior adhesion property to substrate and resistance capacity to ultrasonicating and bending when compared with the spin-coated method. 3.4 Study of density-controlled, OSR and viologen-modified Then the parameters of different densities and OSRs are listed in Table 1 , and the effect of exploring their morphology, OSR, and absorption capability to viologen molecules is shown in Fig. 4 . From Table 1 , it can be found that the OSR depends on the nanorods’ diameter and length and the density of NRs, especially the diameter and density, such as the huge different OSRs of Sample A with Low OSR (OSR, 26%, as shown in Fig. 4 a) and Sample C with High OSR (OSR, 75%, as shown in Fig. 4 c) results from their different diameters (Sample A, 132 nm; Sample C, 220 nm) though they have approximate density (Sample A, 1.90 × 10 9 rods cm −2 ; Sample C, 1.60 × 10 9 rods cm −2 ). Moreover, we can clearly observe that Fig. 4 e, pristine ZnO NRs of which are shown in Fig. 4 b, illustrates much more dominant absorption performance to viologen molecules than Fig. 4 d and f, while their pristine ZnO NRs are shown in Fig. 4 a and c, respectively. According to the OSR shown in Fig. 4 a–c, we can come to a conclusion that the ZnO NRs of Low OSR (like Fig. 4 a) and High OSR (like Fig. 4 c) both go against absorption to viologen molecules compared with Opti-den OSR shown in Fig. 4 b. Otherwise, we call Sample A Opti-den OSR (optimum OSR with apropos density) for not only it has the best absorption capability to viologen molecules but also ZnO NRs with apropos density (e.g., 3.34 × 10 9 rods cm −2 ) can bring forth higher c -axis growth orientation and better electron transmission capability. From the relevant kinetics conditions of ZnO NRs fabrication, it was also found that the NRs density could be primarily controlled by changing the thickness of the seed layer (except too thickness of the seed layer can result in polymer of many seeds so that NRs turn into sparse ones, e.g., Sample C and Fig. 4 c), besides the nanorods’ dimensions could be primarily dependent on the concentration and ratio of the reactants, the time and temperature of NRs growth. The experimental result shows that Opti-den OSR NRs with optimum density and OSR was fabricated in a 300 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.05 M Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O and 0.06 M C 6 H 12 N 4 at 75 °C for 24 h, and the sputtering time of ZnO seed layers was 80 s, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4 b. At the same time, by changing the sputtering times for 40 s and 150 s, we obtained the ZnO NRs of Low OSR and High OSR, as shown in Fig. 4 a and c, respectively. The latter higher OSR was mainly resulting from nanorods’ too big dimension especially too big diameter though it has approximate density compared with the former (the former, ∼1.90 × 10 9 rods cm −2 ; the latter, ∼1.60 × 10 9 rods cm −2 ), and the temperature, time and concentration of growing High OSR ZnO NRs were adjusted at 95 °C for 30 h in a aqueous solution containing 0.06 M Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O and 0.08 M C 6 H 12 N 4 . As a result, it is found that the diameter, density and OSR of the Opti-den OSR NRs are ∼140 nm, ∼3.34 × 10 9 rods cm −2 and ∼52%, respectively. 3.5 Study of EC performance Finally, in accordance with results of the EC performance of the different OSR ZnO NRs were also confirmed and shown in Figs. 5 and 6 . As for the EC performance shown in Fig. 5 , it is clearly found that the working electrode assembled using the VMZs with Opti-den OSR (optimum density and OSR, e.g., Fig. 5 Ag) demonstrates better EC performance than the other two (Bg, Low OSR; Cg, High OSR). At the same time, Fig. 6 shows that the cyclic voltammograms curves were obtained with a 0.05 V/s scan speed for the three kinds of VMZs working electrodes: High OSR, Low OSR and Opti-den OSR, as shown respectively in Fig. 4 f, d and e. From Fig. 6 , we can find out that there are redox peaks for both the Low OSR and High OSR ZnO NRs electrodes, with the former ones bigger than the later ones. Otherwise, four obvious redox peaks are clearly found for the electrode of Opti-den OSR ZnO NRs. The two peaks located at −0.61 V and −1.21 V (vs Ag/AgCl sat. KCl reference electrode) during the reduction scan can be defined as the reductions that provide the singly and doubly reduced viologen species, when the two other peaks located at −1.00 V and −0.24 V are related to the oxidations of the singly and doubly reduced viologen, respectively [11] . The VMZs electrode is colored to blue during the reduction scan and bleached to transparency during the oxidation scan. The effect of the CVs curves is in accordance with that in Fig. 5 . 4 Conclusion In summary, our work presented here shows that growth ZnO NRs with different adhesions and densities could be controlled by adjusting the preparation method and thickness of ZnO seed layers. The ZnO NRs with optimum density and OSR (diameter, ∼ 140 nm; density, ∼3.34 × 10 9 rods cm −2 ; and OSR, ∼52%) can be obtained by using the solution containing 0.05 M Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O and 0.06 M C 6 H 12 N 4 at 75 °C for 24 h, before about 4–5 nm thickness of ZnO seed layers were sputtered. Moreover, the sputtering-coated ZnO NRs show superior adhesion property to substrate and resistance capacity to ultrasonicating and bending when compared with the spin-coated method. And it is found that the ZnO NRs with the optimum density and OSR demonstrate superior absorption capability to viologen molecules and excellent EC performance. Our results would provide a promising route to study flexible ECs and further find the optimized electrode structure.

        "title": "A general solution synthesis route to ZnO-based nanorod arrays on ceramic/silicon/quartz glass/metal substrates",
        "abstract": "We report an effective approach for the growth of vertically aligned one-dimensional (1D) ZnO nanostructures on various substrates (ceramic, silicon, quartz glass and metal) in mild solutions (T = 95 °C) without any seeds or catalysts. With the measurements of SEM, FT-IR, XRD and TEM, the novel growth mechanism of the ZnO nanorod arrays has been discussed in detail. The results show that the key of the ZnO direct growth on the demanded substrate is the introduction of glucose into the Zn2+-contained solution, which functionalizes the substrate, leading to the ZnO heterogeneous nucleation on the substrate surface. Particularly noteworthy is that the obtained ZnO is coated with carbonaceous species layer; this layer can be carbonized at high temperature in nitrogen to form core-shell composite structures, or removed by oxidation according to different application requirements. Furthermore, it is found that carbon-coated ZnO composite nanostructure shows superior UV excitonic emissions over the pristine ZnO. We believe that our approach presents a general economical route toward mass production of controllable ZnO-based arrays and will facilitate flexible design of device architectures for nanoelectronics. © 2010 American Scientific Publishers.",

Based on the direct electrochemistry of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), the H 2 O 2 biosensing application is further demonstrated using this new C–ZnO array architecture.

        "abstract": "Understanding the effects of structural properties on the lithium storage behavior of mesoporous TiO is crucial for further optimizing its performance through rational structure design. To achieve this, herein, the surface area and the grain size of the prepared mesoporous TiO are intentionally adjusted by controlling the calcination temperatures. It is found that the capacities of the mesoporous TiO contain both the lithium-ion insertion into the bulk phase (Q ) and the additional surface lithium storage (Q ). The Q  gradually increases with grain sizes to a steady level and then slightly drops. By contrast, the Q  is directly proportional to the specific surface area of the mesoporous TiO and is ascribed to the capacity originated from the lithium-ion insertion into the surface layer. The experimental comparison and analysis demonstrate that the fast kinetics of the Q  ensure both the better rate performance and capacity retention of mesoporous TiO than bulk ones. Specially, the mesoporous TiO calcinated at 350 °C shows the highest reversible specific capacity of 250.2 mA h g, the best rate capability (132.5 mA h g at 2C) and good cycling stability. Our findings shed great light on the design of high-performance nanostructured TiO with surface lithium storage.",

        "abstract": "After surgery performed under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), severe lung injury often occurs in infants. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are potentially involved in diverse pathophysiological processes via regulation of gene expression. The objective of this study was to investigate differentially expressed miRNAs and their potential target genes in immature piglet lungs in response to CPB. Fourteen piglets aged 18.6 ± 0.5 days were equally divided into two groups that underwent sham sternotomy or CPB. The duration of aortic cross-clamping was 2 h, followed by 2 h reperfusion. Lung injury was evaluated by lung function indices, levels of cytokines, and histological changes. We applied miRNA microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis to determine miRNA expression. Meanwhile, qRT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used for validation of predicted mRNA targets. The deterioration of lung function and histopathological changes revealed the piglets' lungs were greatly impaired due to CPB. The levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, and interleukin 10 increased in the lung tissue after CPB. Using miRNA microarray, statistically significant differences were found in the levels of 16 miRNAs in the CPB group. Up-regulation of miR-21 was verified by PCR. We also observed down-regulation in the levels of miR-127, miR-145, and miR-204, which were correlated with increases in the expression of the products of their potential target genes PIK3CG, PTGS2, ACE, and IL6R in the CPB group, suggesting a potential role for miRNA in the regulation of inflammatory response. Our results show that CPB induces severe lung injury and dynamic changes in miRNA expression in piglet lungs. Moreover, the changes in miRNA levels and target gene expression may provide a basis for understanding the pathogenesis of CPB-induced injury to immature lungs.",

        "abstract": "T helper 17 cells and interleukin-17A have been implicated in the progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma thymus, the master transcription factor of T helper 17 cell differentiation, is selectively antagonized by digoxin. However, the effect of antagonizing retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma thymus on AAA has not been investigated.We used human aortic sample analysis and 2 different experimental AAA models: (a) Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced ApoE(-/-) male mice (Ang II/APOE model) and (b) porcine pancreatic elastase perfusion C57BL/6 mice (porcine pancreatic elastase/C57 model). In the Ang II/APOE model, all mice (n=80) were divided into 4 groups: sham group (saline+0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide treatment), control group (Ang II+0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide treatment), low-dose group (Ang II+low-dose digoxin, 20 μg/d per mouse), and high-dose group (Ang II+high-dose digoxin, 40 μg/d per mouse). All treatments began on day 0 after surgery. Efficacy was determined via aortic diameter and systolic blood pressure measurements, histopathology and protein expression, and flow cytometry analysis when euthenized. Human aortic tissue analysis showed that both interleukin-17A and retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma thymus increased in AAA tissues. The low-dose and high-dose groups had AAA incidences of 60% and 35%, respectively, compared with 70% in the control group. The T helper 17- and interleukin-17A-related inflammatory responses were dose-dependently attenuated by digoxin treatment. Digoxin was also highly effective in the porcine pancreatic elastase/C57 model.Digoxin attenuates experimental AAA progression in a model-independent manner. Antagonizing retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma thymus activity by digoxin may become a novel strategy for nonsurgical AAA treatment.",

        "abstract": "Engrafting the bone marrow cells of a patient with M5 acute myeloid leukemia into immunocompromised mice (AM7577) resulted in serially transferrable stable AML and eventual mortality. The disease starts in the bone marrow and then expands to peripheral areas, which is typical of M5 leukemogenesis, where high leukemic burden in blood is coincident with symptoms/mortality. The leukemic cells in the mice had myeloid morphology, phenotypes, and genotypes (including the internal tandem duplication of FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor 3 gene [FLT3-ITD]) similar to those of the original patient. Autocrine mechanisms of human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor/interleukin-3 likely support AM7577 growth in mice. Treatment with FLT3 TKI (AC220) caused complete remission in peripheral blood, spleen, and bone, along with relief of symptoms and extended life, hinting that FLT3-ITD may be a key leukemogenic driver maintaining the disease. Interestingly, withdrawal of AC220 (high dose) did not result in relapse of disease, suggesting cure. These results, however, are in contrast to cytarabine (AraC) induction treatment: First, although AraC significantly suppresses the diseases in blood, and to a lesser degree in bone marrow and spleen, the suppression is temporary and does not prevent eventual onset of disease/death. Second, the withdrawal of AraC always resulted in rapid relapse in peripheral blood and eventually death. Our observation in this patient-derived model may provide useful information for clinical applications of the two drugs.",

        "abstract": "Considered as a significant ultrafiltration technology during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), zero-balance ultrafiltration (Z-BUF) has always received controversial support regarding its effectiveness in reducing inflammatory mediators in plasma. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical effect of Z-BUF through screening all relevant published randomized controlled trials (RCTs).A comprehensive search was conducted to screen all RCTs of Z-BUF. Three trained investigators searched databases, including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Google scholar, and Chinese literature databases (CNKI, WanFang, WeiPu). RCTs that compared Z-BUF with non-ultrafiltration were included. We focused on clinical outcomes such as length of stay in ICU, duration of ventilation, hospital stay, total amount of chest tube drainage and mortality. Finally, a total of 7 studies containing appropriate criteria were divided into an adult group and a pediatric group. A random effects model was used to calculate weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals.In the adult group, the benefits of Z-BUF in duration of ventilation (WMD=-2.77, 95% CI = [-6.26, 0.72], I(2)=71%, p=0.12) and the length of ICU stay (WMD=-4.13, 95% CI = [-10.09, 1.84], I(2)=77%, Z=1.36, p=0.17) were not apparent, with significant heterogeneity existing in the statistical results. The rest of the clinical parameters could not be evaluated due to insufficient data. In the pediatric group, combined analysis showed Z-BUF could reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (WMD=3.07; 95%CI= [-7.56, -3.46], I(2)=17%, p=0.27). The advantage of Z-BUF was not observed in other clinical outcomes.The benefits of Z-BUF were not apparent, according to the report. Further studies involving combined ultrafiltration are expected to provide improved ultrafiltration during CPB.",

Then, we carry out a novel spatial-temporal joint based image noise removing method by combining the single image based denoising model with a weighted impact factor conducted on the sequential images based on the relativity of the image coefficients among the image sequences. This new image denoising method is capable of achieved higher reconstruction quality while protecting more image details.

The functional relationship between flow stress and process parameters (deformation degree, deformation temperature, strain rate, etc.) of 21-4N heat-resistant steel during hot deformation was explored, the constitutive equation of peak stress was established, and its accuracy was verified. Based on the dynamic material model, the energy dissipation maps and destabilization maps of 21-4N heat-resistant steel were established at strains of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6, and processing maps were obtained by their superposition. Within the deformation temperature range of 1060~1120°C and a strain rate range of 0.01⁻0.1 s, there is a stable domain with the peak efficiency of about 0.5. The best hot working parameters (strain rate and deformation temperature) of 21-4N heat-resistant steel are determined by the stable and instable domain in the processing maps, which are in the deformation temperature range of 1120⁻1180 °C and the strain rate range of 0.01⁻10 s.",

We examined early changes in cerebral markers of oxidative damage, apoptotic protein activation and histological outcome after different flows for SCP in a piglet model of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA).Twenty piglets, randomly divided into four groups (each n = 5), were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) at 20°C, then underwent DHCA for 60 minutes. SCP was conducted at flow rates of 0, 25, 50 and 80 ml·kg(-1)·min(-1) through the innominate artery in the DHCA, SCP 25, SCP 50, and SCP 80 groups, respectively. The animals were killed at 2 hours off CPB. Brain tissues were examined for the activity of SOD, MDA and caspase-3, and histological damage was quantitatively assayed by light microscopic examinations.There were no significant differences in the activities of SOD, MDA and the SOD/MDA index between the groups. Caspase-3 activity significantly decreased in the SCP 25, SCP 50 and SCP 80 groups compared with the DHCA group. However, the caspase-3 level was higher in the SCP 80 group than in the SCP 25 and SCP 50 group. There were no significant correlations between MDA, SOD, SOD/MDA index and caspase-3.In this acute model, under different flows for SCP, cerebral MDA and SOD activities show no change, whereas activated caspase-3 has a marked change. There was no relationship between oxidative stress, indicated by MDA and SOD, and apoptotic protein activation in the early phase after DHCA.",

        "abstract": "We previously generated the MuPrime® mBR6004 model, by engrafting the breast adenocarcinoma derived from MMTV-PyVT transgenic mice (GEMM)1 into the syngeneic FVB/N mice2,3. The allograft grows robustly, maintains the histopathology features of the original GEMM, and metastasizes to the lungs in all examined cases when implanted orthotopically2. Additionally, histopathology shows that the models is HER2++, but ER-/PR-. We profiled drug responses to standard of care (SoC)2 and checkpoint inhibitors3. Interestingly, among all checkpoints inhibitors tested, our model is insensitive to PD1/PDL-1 inhibitors, but responds to CTLA-4 inhibitors3. To further explore the underlying mechanism of response, we performed extensive tumor immuno-profiling for the presence of infiltrating immune cells, e.g. TIL, CTL, Treg, immune-suppressive macrophages, NK, etc3. We observed a good pharmacodynamic (PD) correlation between the presence of tumor infiltrating T-cells, particularly CD8+ TIL, and NK and a positive response to therapy, regardless the treatment type. Given this preliminary observation, we attempted animal vaccination with tumor lysates prior to tumor engraftment or treatments. Interestingly, while vaccination had minimal effects on the engraftment take rate (100% take for all animals) and on the growth kinetics of the engraftments, it had profound effects on the tumor response to anti-PD1/anti-PDL-1 antibody treatments, significantly enhancing tumor response to these agents in a model that was otherwise unresponsive. Our results suggest that the immunological status of the animal, at least with regard to the specific anti-tumor immunity, is critically important to determine the response to checkpoint inhibitors. Our observations suggest that vaccination is critical for the overall success of immunotherapy (I/O) treatments utilizing checkpoint inhibitors as well other treatment strategies.  References  1.

To study the mass diffusion effect and the reduction of the bubble growth rate in boiling of non-azeotropic mixtures, an experiment was conducted to investigate the bubble growth rates of R142b, R134a, isobutane and R142b/R134a mixtures in a vertical transparent quartz tube. The pressure used in this experiment ranged from 0.2 to 0.47 MPa, and the superheats ranged from 1.5 to 23.3 °C. Moreover, in order to obtain a uniformly superheated liquid, the bubbles were grown at a single nucleation site, and the departure frequency for the successive bubbles was lower than 20 Hz. Experimental bubble growth constants were obtained, and the reliability of the experimental study was supported by theoretical models for pure refrigerants. Additionally, for the study of bubble growth rate in binary mixtures, the attenuation factors for superheat were calculated and compared with different proposed models. The experimental attenuation factors were much smaller than the calculated results. Thus, a correlation was identified, and the errors were primarily in the range of −30% to +30%.",

        "abstract": "Objective To identify the risk factors for short-term adverse events in infants with congenital heart diseases receiving open heart surgical correction with cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB),in order to improve the outcome by adopting appropriate treatment measures.Methods We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 98 consecutive children with congenital heart diseases who underwent surgical correction with CPB in Beijing Fu Wai Hospital from November 2009 to December 2009.The patients were divided into two groups according to the post-operative complications.Among the patients without complications(n=40): there were 24 males and 16 females with an age of 7.60±0.40 months and a weight of 7.80±0.30 kg.In the patients with complications(n=58): there were 42 males and 16 females with an age of 6.20±0.40 months and a weight of 6.70±0.20 kg.In both groups,peri-operative data were recorded,including pre-operative fast blood glucose,creatinine,time of aortic cross-clamp,modified or zero-balanced ultrafiltration,post-operative glucose level,concentration of lactate, inotrope score and complications.Risk stratification was performed by Risk Adjusted Classification for Congenital Heart Surgery(RACHS-1).Univariate analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to identify the risk factors for short-term adverse events.Results One patient(1.02%) died of circulatory failure during the peri-operative period.Thirty-seven patients were supported by at least 2 vasoactive drugs for more than 48 hours,29 by mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours,5 needed re-intubation,1 experienced tracheotomy,31 suffered from noscomial infection,4 had wound infection,3 developed renal failure,and 1 developed hepatic dysfunction.By logistic regression analysis,age(OR=0.750,P=0.012),percutaneous oxygen saturation(OR=0.840,P=0.005),aortic cross-clamp time(OR=1.040,P=0.008),post-operative glucose level(patients with a mean glucose level lower or equal to 8.33 mmol/L had a probability of developing adverse outcomes five times higher;OR=5.051,P=0.011) were found to be the risk factors for short-term adverse outcomes.Conclusion Age,percutaneous oxygen saturation and aortic cross-clamp time are associated with the short-term adverse outcome of infants undergoing congenital heart disease correction with CPB.The present results do not support peri-operative hyperglycemia as a risk factor for adverse outcome.",

However, current computer-vision system is far from effective in intelligent perception of complex grainy images, comprised of a large number of local homogeneous particles or fragmentations without obvious foreground and background. We introduce a well known statistical modeling theory of size distribution in comminution processes, sequential fragmentation theory, for the visual analysis of the spatial structure of the complex grainy images. A kind of omnidirectional multi-scale Gaussian derivative filter-based image statistical modeling method is presented to attain omnidirectional structural features of grain images under different observation scales. A modified LS-SVM classifier is subsequently established to automatically identify the processing rice q...",

Firstly, a kind of classic image denosing method based on local spatial statistical model of Gaussian scale mixture (GSM) and Bayes-least square inference is applied in the image Curvelet domain to estimate the optimal coefficients based on the spatial domain information of single image. Then, weighted impact factors of the inter-frames according to motion compensation and similarities measurement of the sub-blocks in the adjacent frames are introduced. Consequently, ultimate and optimal image coefficients of the froth frame to be processed are computed by weighting the adjacent frames coefficients according to the correlation information on the spatial-temporal domain with the weighted impact factors. The experiment and application results explicitly show that this method can achieve much better performance to protect the bubble details of the image sequences while removing the image noise, and it also achieves good results for the seriously polluted image sequences.",

Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) prolongs myocardial and cerebral ischemia and may induce heart, brain, and major organ dysfunction. From May 2004 to May 2006, 13 infants with IAA underwent one stage repair by median sternotomy under DHCA with continuous regional cerebral perfusion (RCP) in Fuwai Children's Heart Center. Median age at operation was 10.4 +/- 6.7 months, and mean body weight was 6.58 +/- 2.15 kg. Temperature of nasopharynx was decreased to 18 degrees C-20 degrees C; rectal temperature was controlled at 19 degrees C-22 degrees C. Flow rate of RCP was maintained with 20-25 ml x kg x min under DHCA combined with RCP. Mean artery pressure (MAP) measuring from right radial artery was 32.5 +/- 5.8 mm Hg, and MAP from femoral artery was 11.2 +/- 3.5 mm Hg. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time was 141.6 +/- 21.7 min, and mean aortic clamp time was 52.3 +/- 10.9 min. Mean duration of RCP was 31.5 +/- 12.4 min. Mean intubation time in intensive care unit (ICU) was 54.7 +/- 12.6 hours, and mean ICU stay was 67.9 +/- 28.4 hours. This report describes our CPB protocol under DHCA using continuous RCP in low weight pediatric patients to minimize neurological complications during one stage IAA repair and summarizes the various CPB managements in recent literature as well.",

        "abstract": "Controlled integration of multiple semiconducting oxides into each single unit of ordered nanotube arrays is highly desired in scientific research for the realization of more attractive applications. We herein report a diffusion-controlled solid-solid route to evolve simplex Co(CO3)0.5(OH)0.11H2O@TiO2 core-shell nanowire arrays (NWs) into CoO-CoTiO3 integrated hybrid nanotube arrays (NTs) with preserved morphology. During the evolution procedure, the decomposition of Co(CO3)0.5(OH)0.11H2O NWs into chains of CoCO3 nanoparticles initiates the diffusion process and promotes the interfacial solid-solid diffusion reaction even at a low temperature of 450 °C. The resulting CoO-CoTiO3 NTs possess well-defined sealed tubular geometries and a special \"inner-outer\" hybrid nature, which is suitable for application in Li-ion batteries (LIBs). As a proof-of-concept demonstration of the functions of such hybrid NTs in LIBs, CoO-CoTiO3 NTs are directly tested as LIB anodes, exhibiting both a high capacity (~600 mA h g(-1) still remaining after 250 continuous cycles) and a much better cycling performance (no capacity fading within 250 total cycles) than CoO NWs. Our work presents not only a diffusion route for the formation of integrated hybrid NTs but also a new concept that can be employed as a general strategy to fabricate other oxide-based hybrid NTs for energy storage devices.",

        "abstract": "Increasing specific surface area and electrical conductivity are two crucial ways to improve the capacitive performance of electrode materials. Nanostructure usually enlarges the former but reduces the later; thus, it is still a great challenge to overcome such contradiction. Here, we report hydrogenated NiCo2O4 double-shell hollow spheres, combining large specific surface area and high conductivity to improve the capacitive performance of supercapacitors. The specific surface area of NiCo2O4 hollow spheres, fabricated via programmed coating of carbon spheres, was enlarged 50% (from 76.6 to 115.2 m2 g−1) when their structure was transformed from single-shell to double-shell. Furthermore, activated carbon impedance measurements demonstrated that the low-temperature hydrogenation greatly decreased both the internal resistance and the Warburg impedance. Consequently, a specific capacitance increase of >62%, from 445 to 718 F g−1, was achieved at a current density of 1 A g−1. Underlying such great improvement, the evolution of chemical valence and defect states with co-increase of these two factors was explored through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Moreover, a full cell combined with NiCo2O4 and AC was assembled, and an energy density of 34.8 Wh kg−1 was obtained at a power density of 464 W kg−1.",

        "abstract": "Three Gorges Reservoir Area (Chongqing) is a significant ecological barrier and vegetation resource pool in southwest China. The growth condition and trend of vegetation in Three Gorges Reservoir Area (Chongqing) play a very important role in maintaining Three Gorges Reservoir Area sustainable and stable as well as studying the carbon cycle and balance. This paper has investigated the vegetation change and its influencing factors in Three gorges Reservoir area (Chongqing) from 2001 to 2010 based on multi-temporal MODIS NDVI dataset. The results show that: 1)The middle and high mountain areas in the east and middle-south part of Three Gorges reservoir area (Chongqing) have high NDVI value, while the paralleled ridge-valley areas in the east of Sichuan and the valley areas in west of Yangtze River and its tributary have low NDVI value. It is of great significance to strengthen the protection and construction of vegetation in the middle and high mountain areas in the east and middle-south part of Three Gorges reservoir area (Chongqing); 2)The vegetation activities in Three Gorges Reservoir Area (Chongqing) have gradually displayed an increasing trend on the whole over the past decade; 3)The vegetation activities within the study area present a polarized trend. The vegetation activities decrease further in the region with sparse vegetation, but keep stable or increasing in the region with thick vegetation, which is especially obvious in summer. The main reason is the further decrease of minimum value caused by human activities in sparse vegetation area; 4) The NDVI of the broadleaf forest is the highest (0.6904) among six vegetation types in the study area, but the NDVI of the aquatic vegetation is the lowest (0.5710). Meanwhile, meadow, shrub and shrub-grassland all maintain a rapid growth with rates of 0.6% and 0.48% respectively, while the growth rate of aquatic vegetation is only 0.2%. The NDVI values of other vegetation types are all increasing, with 0.47% for coniferous forest type, 0.46% for cultivated vegetation type and 0.38% for broadleaf forest type; 5)Terrain (DEM), slope and terrain amplitude are the most important factors that affect the status of vegetation growth in the study area, and they fundamentally determine the spatial distribution of vegetation and change trend. Terrain (DEM) is a sufficient condition to shape slope and amplitude, thus becoming a fundamentally decisive factor for the vegetation distribution in this area. Simultaneously, human activities have been becoming a main factor that brings about the degradation of vegetation coverage.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the cardioprotective effects of nicorandil, an opener of potassium channels, on senile rat hearts from ischemic reperfusion injury. A modified working model of isolated perfused hearts of senile rats was used. After isolation, the hearts underwent 60 min of global hypothermic ischemia treatment, followed by 30 min of reperfusion. These hearts were distributed into three groups, each receiving different cardioplegic solutions: (1) St. Thomas' solution (Group S), (2) 100 micromol/L nicorandil (Group N), (3) St. Thomas' solution combined with 100 micromol/L nicorandil (Group S+N). The pre- and post-ischemic myocardial function were assessed by the percentage recovery of the heart rate (HR), +/- dp/dt(max) (maximal rate of change of left ventricular pressure) and cardiac output (CO). Upon reperfusion, the cardioplegic solution was collected from the coronary sinus and tested for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) activity. During 30 min of reperfusion, the percentage recovery of HR, +dp/dt and left ventricular stroke work (LVSW) were significantly higher in Group S+N than in Group S and Group N (p < 0.05). The percentage of recovery in CO was higher in Group N and Group S+N than in Group S. The electrical activities arresting time (EAT) and mechanical activities arresting time (MAT) were longer in Group N than in Group S and Group N+S (p < 0.01). There were no statistical significance between Group S and Group N+S (p > 0.05). There were no significant differences in the levels of LDH and CK-MB. Electron microscopic examination revealed better preservation of the ultrastructures of the myocardial tissue in Group N+S than the other two groups. These results indicate that nicorandil combined with St. Thomas' solution can improve the left ventricular function of the post-ischemic senile rat and offer a better myocardial protective effect on the ischemic senile myocardium.",

        "abstract": "The hippocampus is a structurally and functionally complex brain area that plays important and diverse roles in higher brain functions, such as learning and memory, and mounting evidence indicates that different hippocampal subregions play distinctive roles. The hippocampus is also one of the first regions in the brain to suffer damage in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Synaptic dysfunction in the hippocampus, rather than neuronal loss per se, is paralleled by behavioural and functional deficits in AD. The membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family of proteins, including SAP102, PSD-95, PSD-93 and SAP97, have long been recognized as essential components of the postsynaptic density (PSD) at excitatory synapses. Hippocampal spines are the predominant synaptic transmission sites of excitatory glutamatergic synapses. During postnatal brain development, individual MAGUK members show distinct expression patterns. Although SAP102 has been confirmed as the dominant scaffold protein in neonatal synapses, its expression profiles in adult and ageing rodent hippocampi are discrepant. Furthermore, in AD brains, significantly reduced SAP102 protein levels have been found, suggesting that SAP102 may be related to AD progression; however, the precise mechanism underlying this result remains unclear. Herein, we observed distinct SAP102 expression profiles in the hippocampal CA1, CA3 and DG subregions of rats and APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice at various ages using immunofluorescence. In Wistar rats, SAP102 was not only highly expressed in the hippocampal subregions of neonatal rats but also maintained relatively high expression levels in adult hippocampi and displayed no obvious decreases in the CA1 and DG subregions of aged rats. Surprisingly, we observed abnormally high SAP102 expression levels in the CA1 stratum moleculare and CA3 stratum polymorphum subregions of 2-month-old APP/PS1 mice, but low SAP102 levels in the DG and CA3 subregions of 7-month-old APP/PS1 mice, reflecting the subregion-specific reactivity and vulnerability of AD mouse models in different disease stages. Our findings provide fundamental data to support the functional differences of SAP102 in different hippocampal subregions during postnatal periods and may serve as the basis for additional functional studies on SAP102 in normal physiological conditions and different stages of AD.",

        "abstract": "Early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by synaptic dysfunction, a phenomenon in which soluble oligomers of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) are implicated. Here, we demonstrated that astrocytes express NMDARs and therefore have the potential to modulate the synaptotoxic actions of Aβ. We found that specific pharmacological antagonism of two of the major NMDAR subunits, GluN2A and GluN2B, exacerbates Aβ-induced synaptotoxicity suggesting, for the first time, that astrocytic GluN2A and GluN2B mediate synaptoprotection. From the perspective of the pathogenic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease, in which Aβ and NMDAR play significant roles, these observations are striking since neuronal GluN2A and GluN2B are well known modulators of neurodegeneration. We did initial studies to understand the basis for the differential effects of astrocytic and neuronal GluN2A and GluN2B in the promotion of synapse survival, and identified a neurotrophin produced by astrocytes, nerve growth factor β (β-NGF), as a likely mediator of the synaptoprotective effects of astrocytic GluN2A and GluN2B activation. The results presented suggest that astrocytes may be suitable druggable targets for the prevention and/or delay of the synaptic loss that occurs during early stages of AD. ",

The mRNA and protein expression of MyD88 were analyzed by semi-quantified RT-PCR and Western blot. Mouse DCs were divided into control group and RNA interference group. One of the highest effective siRNA was transfected into RNA interference group. 12 hours later, LPS of the final concentrations of 1.0 mg/L was added in two groups and continued to culture for 3 days. The phenotype and functional properties of DCs were detected by flow cytometry and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). The concentration of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-12 in the supernatant was detected by ELISA, and the concentration of NF-kappaB was detected by immunochemistry.mRNA and protein expression were reduced 90% and 85% in sequence2 siRNA, 92% and 88% in sequence3 siRNA respectively but no change was found in other groups. LPS stimulation increased the expression of CD80, CD86 and MHC-II in the cytomembrane of DCs, the concentration of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-12 in the supernatant in control group. Besides, LPS stimulation promoted the shift of NF-kappaB to karyon and the proliferation of allogeneic T cells in control group. RNA interference inhibited these effects induced by LPS.RNA interference can reduce MyD88 expression in murine myeloid dendritic cells and inhibit the maturation of DCs, which may provide a new strategy of gene therapy for related diseases.",

        "abstract": "'Conditioning' [ischemic preconditioning (IPC), ischemic postconditioning (IPO) and remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC)] the heart to render it more resistant to an episode of acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is an endogenous cardioprotective strategy. There are several mechanisms proposed for 'conditioning', such as endogenous mediators or cytoprotective proteins. In recent reports, microRNAs (miRNAs) were involved in controlling the expression of myocardial ischemia-related genes. Some studies have demonstrated that cardiac miRNA-1 and miRNA-21 were significantly increased by late IPC with an increase in their target proteins [endothelial nitric oxide synthase and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70)], but their expression levels in 'conditioning' strategies are currently unknown.In the current study, Langendorff-perfused Sprague-Dawley rat hearts were randomly assigned to one of four groups [control group (CON group, n = 12), IPC group (n = 12), IPO group (n = 12) and RIPC group (n = 12)]. Cardiac function was digitalized and analyzed. The expression of miRNA-1 and miRNA-21 was detected by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The expression of HSP70, programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) was detected by Western blot. Cardiac infarct size and myocardial apoptosis were determined using the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, respectively.The results revealed that miRNA-1 (233 ± 45%) and miRNA-21 (356 ± 33%) expression was up-regulated in the IPC group, but the expression of miRNA-1 was down-regulated in the RIPC (61 ± 16%) group and IPO group (61 ± 13%). The expression of PDCD4 [IPC (74 ± 11%), RIPC (81 ± 16%), IPO (83 ± 12%)], HSP70 [IPC (74 ± 5%), RIPC (81 ± 6%), IPO (67 ± 11%)] and Bax [IPC (27 ± 6%), RIPC (21 ± 3%), IPO (27 ± 4%)] was down-regulated in the conditioning groups compared with the CON group [PDCD4 (130 ± 11%), HSP70 (121 ± 11%) and Bax (63 ± 8%)]. In the conditioning hearts, infarct size [IPC (31.7 ± 4.1%), RIPC (29.6 ± 6.19%) and IPO (32.8 ± 4.71%)] and myocardial apoptosis [IPC (15.2 ± 4.21%), RIPC (17.2 ± 1.92%) and IPO (15.6 ± 4.04%)] were significantly decreased compared with the CON group (infarct size: 51.77 ± 4.3%, myocardial apoptosis: 32.8 ± 3.96%).We concluded that miRNA-1 and miRNA-21 expression differed in IPC, RIPC and IPO groups, and their target proteins were not inversely correlated with the miRNAs in all the conditioning groups, which revealed that the miRNAs were regulated but complicated by the different conditioning protocols.",

        "abstract": "Although benefits of pulsatile flow during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in pediatric heart surgery remain controversial and nonpulsatile CPB is still widely used in clinical cardiac surgery, pulsatile CPB must be reconsidered due to its physiologic features. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of pulsatile perfusion (PP) and nonpulsatile perfusion (NP) on cerebral regional oxygen saturation (rSO₂) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in pediatric tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) patients undergoing open heart surgery with CPB. Forty pediatric patients were randomly divided into the PP group (n = 20) and the NP group (n = 20). Pulsatile patients used a modified roller pump during the cross-clamp period in CPB, while NP patients used a roller pump with continuous flat flow perfusion. The subjects were monitored for rSO₂ from the beginning of the operation until 6 h after returning to the intensive care unit (ICU). We also monitored the hemodynamic status and ET-1 concentration and plasma free hemoglobin (PFH) in blood samples of all patients over time. Effective PP was monitored in PP patients, and pulse pressure was significantly higher in the PP group than in the NP group (P < 0.01). rSO₂ of the PP group was higher than that of the NP group (P < 0.01) during the cross-clamp period, and this advantage of PP would be maintained until 2 h after patients returned to the ICU (P < 0.05). ET-1 level in blood samples was lower at clamping off and CPB weaning and early ICU period in the PP group than in the NP group (P < 0.01), and ET-1 concentration remained at a normal level after patients were transferred to the ICU 24 h in all patients. PFH levels in the PP group at pre-clamp off and CPB weaned off were higher than those of the NP group (P < 0.05) in these cyanotic patients. PP can increase rSO₂ and improve microcirculation during cross-clamping period in TOF pediatric patients, while PP resulted in more severe hemolysis in these cyanotic patients than NP.",

Throughout a controllable hydrothermal process using urea as mineralizer and hereafter with a postcalcination process under air atmosphere, Co3O4 ID nanostructure arrays have been grown firmly on insulating substrates, such as glass slides and ceramics, which is quite convenient for the construction of gas sensor devices without any extra electrode preparation process. Furthermore, this direct-growth approach can be readily extended to conductive substrates (ITO, Ti, Fe-Co-Nialloy), and meanwhile due to the robust mechanical adhesion and one-dimensional carrier transportation architecture firmly contacted to the metal, the metal substrate-supported Co3O4 arrays could act as a promising electrode material and be straightforwardly integrated into electronic and electrochemical nanodevices. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Machine vision based froth flotation process monitoring and control aims at achieving automatic monitoring and intelligent evaluation of the production conditions of the whole flotation circuit through building the intelligent image analysis software platform, so as to further realize the optimal control of flotation production process. The froth visual monitoring system has high demand on real-time, stability, reusability and maintainability of the system software, however, the traditional software development methods have long development cycle and poor system portability, and higher cost in the software maintenance. Even worse, the quasi visual monitoring systems used in different flotation plants are all difficult to achieve the effective reuse of the existing system software via the simple configuration. In this paper, taking the copper flotation visual monitoring system development as an example, we develop a reusable component base in advance and consequently the forth flotation visual monitoring system software are successfully developed with low-cost and high-efficiency by using component-based software design method to make the software system modular into multiple independent components on the base of the reusable theory and component technology of software development. Since the components have the merits of adaptability, portability and so on, the presented software development method well meets the demands of the industrial monitoring system on stability, reusability and maintainability. As a result, the efficiency of the software development has been effectively improved, besides, the cost of the system software maintenance declines and the robustness of the system software is proved to be enhanced. © 2013 IEEE.",

Economic growth of industrial park plays a vital role in the development of urban economics,so it has great significance to evaluate the industrial park's intensive land use level under the rapid economic development. This paper selects 14 indicators related with intensive land use of industrial park and carries out intensive land use evaluation through the analytic hierarchy process and gray correlation analysis from three areas:land use conditions,land use efficiency and management performance. The results show that the land is in the basic intensive state and has great potential to be explored. Finally,based on analyzing the reasons for differences this paper proposes policy recommendations related with intensive land use of industrial park.",

It becomes particularly important that we take a research of regional food security measure and then establish a rational model of regional food security measure. This paper established a comprehensive model of regional food security measure based on the agricultural production fluctuation coefficient, minimum per capita arable land area, cropland pressure index. Taking Shilin town at Wansheng District of Chongqing as an example, we carried on dynamic research and forecasting in its development level of regional plant production by the model. The result showed that the food safety factor in regional plant production of Shilin Town was taking in downward rends and such phenomenon may become even worse in the next five years. So we put forwards the corresponding adjust and control measures based on the dynamic analysis and forecasting results.",

We studied the key influencing factors including the reaction time and the solution concentration. With the increase of reaction time from 12 h to 24 h, the average length of ZnO nanowires would increase correspondingly. Through this synthesis route, we can obtain a mass of products and the method is both convenient and reproducible. The as-grown ZnO nanowires are single crystalline with a wurtzite structure.",

        "abstract": "The antidepressant-like effect of chiisanoside from the leaves of Acanthopanax sessiliflorus was evaluated by using mice models of depression, forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). The results showed that treatment with chiisanoside at dose of 5.0 mg/kg significantly decreased immobility time in the FST and TST. Pretreatment with haloperidol (a non-selective D receptor antagonist), bicuculline (a competitive GABA antagonist) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA, an agonist at the glutamate site) effectively reversed the antidepressant-like effect of chiisanoside (5.0 mg/kg). Moreover, chiisanoside treatment did not change the locomotor activity. And chiisanoside (5.0 mg/kg) also effectively increased the dopamine (DA) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in mice brains exposed to the FST and TST in the co-treatment groups. Then we designed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced antidepressant behavioral experiment, the results showed that LPS significantly increased immobility duration in the TST and FST. Chiisanoside administration could effectively reduce serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels; at the same time, the changes of related indexes of oxidative stress are improved, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Moreover, chiisanoside effectively down-regulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in hippocampal. In conclusion, chiisanoside displayed significant antidepressant-like effect, which was probably related to the DAergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic systems. And the mechanism of anti-depressant effect of chiisanoside might be via the alterations of animal behaviors, hippocampus inflammation, oxidative stress and neurotrophy, which might be attributed by the BDNF/TrkB/NF-κB pathway.",

        "abstract": "Direct synthesis of large-scale electrode nanostructures on flexible current collectors is crucial to realize high-performance emerging flexible supercapacitors (SCs). However, three-dimensional (3D) macroporous and thick current collectors such as carbon cloth/foam were mostly utilized in previous studies. These 3D current collectors unfortunately wasted much internal space (tens of micrometer interspacing), resulting in quite low volumetric energy density of the flexible SC devices. To address this issue, herein, we choose highly conductive pseudocapacitive vanadium trioxide (V2O3) as an example and report for the first time the growth of a V2O3@carbon nanosheet array directly on a 10 μm ultrathin Ti current collector on a 600 cm2 scale through a hydrothermal u0026 post-annealing strategy. The array is further utilized to assemble a symmetric ultrathin (40 μm) flexible quasi-solid-state SC with the integration of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)–LiCl gel electrolyte. With different redox reactions of vanadium ions in the anode and cathode, our symmetric hydrogel SC achieved an exceptional cell voltage of 2.0 V, outstanding rate performance (∼47.2% capacitance retention with the rate increasing 80 times) and remarkable volumetric energy and power densities of 15.9 mW h cm−3 and 6800 mW cm−3, respectively (without considering the encapsulation film). It also exhibits excellent cycling stability (u003e6000 times) and ∼100% capacitance retention at various bending states.",

In the present study, 100 cyanotic pediatric patients (age 6 months to 3 years) undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were randomized to receive either 10-20 ml/kg FFP (FFP group, n = 50) or 10-20 ml/kg 4 % succinylated gelatin (Gelofusine, GEL group, n = 50) in the priming solution. Rapid thromboelastography (r-TEG) was measured before skin incision and 15 min after heparin neutralization. Postoperative renal and hepatic function, mediastinal chest tube drainage, transfusion requirements, and recovery time were observed. The relationships between hematologic and demographic data and postoperative bleeding volume were also analyzed. The results showed that there were significantly elevated levels of fibrinogen (r-TEG parameters: fibrinogen contribution to maximal amplitude (MAf) and fibrinogen level (FLEV)) in the FFP group compared to the GEL group. The postoperative blood loss, total transfusion requirements, and recovery time were not significantly different between the two groups, indicating that there were no obvious clinical benefits of using FFP in the priming. The maximal amplitude (MA) of r-TEG measured after heparin neutralization was correlated with the 6-h postoperative bleeding volume. In addition, preoperative fibrinogen level rather than FFP priming was an independent predictor of postoperative blood loss.Prophylactic use of FFP in the priming solution does not have obvious clinical benefits in cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD) patients. Gelofusine, an artificial colloid, is a safe and effective substitute of FFP in the priming solution. Furthermore, r-TEG can be used as a \"real-time\" assessment tool to evaluate postoperative bleeding and guide transfusion after cardiac surgery in pediatric patients.",

The interface of the hot water and the cold water is obvious in the water-supplying process. The proportion of the hot water supply is more than 80% when the hot water flow is less than 800 L/h. It doesn't affect the proportion of the hot water supply when the hot water flow is between 400 L/h and 600 L/h as the pump working. The volume flow of the recycled water and the position of temperature sensor affect the proportion of the hot water supply.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Automated visual inspection (AVI) attracts increasing interest in product quality control both academic and industrial communities, particularly on mass production processes, because product qualities of most types can be characterized with their corresponding surface visual attributes. However, many product images in AVI systems are comprised of stochastically accumulative fragmentations (particles) of local homogeneity, without distinctive foregrounds and backgrounds, which brings great challenges in computer analysis, e.g., rice images, fabric images, and consequently, in the intelligent identification of the product qualities. A method of Weibull distribution (WD)-based statistical modeling of image spatial structures (ISSs) to inspect automatically the product quality is presented. The ISS, obtained with multi-scale and omnidirectional Gaussian derivative filters (OGDFs), was demonstrated to be subject to a representative WD model of integral form based on the theory of  sequential fragmentation  in advance. The WD-model parameters (WD-MPs) of the ISS, with essential human perceptual significance, were extracted as the visual features for product quality identification. The classification performance of the proposed product quality inspection method, namely, the proposed WD-MP features integrated with an introduced spline regression (SR) classifier in this study, was verified on two case studies in the field of the AVI of product quality, namely, automated rice quality classification, and intelligent fabric quality assessment in the corresponding assembly lines of industrial scale. Experimental results indicate that the proposed WD-MP features can effectively characterize the statistical distribution profiles of ISS of complex grain images, piled with a large number of stochastically accumulative fragmentations. The proposed method provides an effective tool for grain image modeling and analysis and consequently lays a foundation for the intelligent perception of product qualities on assembly lines.",

This study investigates the effect of warm induced and reperfusion blood cardioplegia on the release of troponin-I during the CABG. In our research, 24 three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) patients underwent CABG and were divided into two groups randomly: Group of warm induction and reperfusion blood cardioplegia (Group W N=12); Group of simple warm induction and no reperfusion (Group C N=12). The effect of myocardium protection of the two methods of myocardium protection were evaluated by clinical outcome, CTnI. Serial venous blood samples were obtained before and after surgery. In both groups, there were no differences in operative parameters. The level of CTnI increased from postoperative 6 h (P<0.05), reached peak in 24 approximately 72 h and recovered postoperatively on 6th day in both groups. Compared with group C, the plasma concentrations of CTnI in group W were significantly lower at 6 h, 24 h and 72 h (P<0.01). The results suggest that the method of warm induction and reperfusion blood cardioplegia reduces the leakage of CTnI than group of simple warm blood cardioplegia in CABG patients.",

        "abstract": "The topic of online product quality inspection (OPQI) with smart visual sensors is attracting increasing interest in both the academic and industrial communities on account of the natural connection between the visual appearance of products with their underlying qualities. Visual images captured from granulated products (GPs), e.g., cereal products, fabric textiles, are comprised of a large number of independent particles or stochastically stacking locally homogeneous fragments, whose analysis and understanding remains challenging. A method of image statistical modeling-based OPQI for GP quality grading and monitoring by a Weibull distribution(WD) model with a semi-supervised learning classifier is presented. WD-model parameters (WD-MPs) of GP images' spatial structures, obtained with omnidirectional Gaussian derivative filtering (OGDF), which were demonstrated theoretically to obey a specific WD model of integral form, were extracted as the visual features. Then, a co-training-style semi-supervised classifier algorithm, named COSC-Boosting, was exploited for semi-supervised GP quality grading, by integrating two independent classifiers with complementary nature in the face of scarce labeled samples. Effectiveness of the proposed OPQI method was verified and compared in the field of automated rice quality grading with commonly-used methods and showed superior performance, which lays a foundation for the quality control of GP on assembly lines.

The intersurface of the ECMO equipment system was completely heparin coated. All patients received venoarterial ECMO, and the activated clotting time was maintained between 120 and 180 seconds. The heparin dose was 5-20 U * kg(-1) * h(-1). Mean blood flow was 40-220 ml * kg(-1) * min(-1) during ECMO assisted period. The shortest ECMO time was 12 hours, and the longest was 504 hours (mean time, 119.45 +/- 80.20 hours). Sixty patients (60.6%) weaned from ECMO successfully; 54 of them (84%) were discharged, and six died of postoperative complications. Thirty-nine patients could not wean from ECMO. Total discharge rate was 54.5%. ECMO is an effective mechanical assistant therapy for cardiac and pulmonary failure after cardiac surgery. Earlier use of ECMO for heart lung failure patients and avoidance of irreversible damage to the main organs are still the key points in the success of ECMO.",

The slow release of OH- by the hydrolysis of urea aided in the direct nucleation and adhesion of precursor seeds on Ti substrate. The presence of carbon ensured a large specific surface area and good conductivity of the final NiO/C composite. The prepared NiO/C nanosheet array exhibited higher catalytic oxidation activity of glucose compared with the pure NiO nanosheet at a detection limit of 2 μM, linear range up to 2.6 mM (R2=0.99961), and sensitivity of 582.6 μAm M-1 cm-2. With good analytical performance, simple preparation and low cost, this composite is promising for nonenzymatic glucose sensing. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

It becomes particularly important whether we are able to make comprehensive and objective quantitative assessment on the development level of regional plant production. This paper presents the concept of regional plant production development index. And the measurement model for the development level of regional plant production was built based on the agricultural production fluctuation coefficient,minimum per capita cropland and pressure index on cropland. Taking Shilin Town at Wansheng District of Chongqing as an example,we carried on dynamic research and forecasting in its development level of regional plant production by the model. The results show that the development index in regional plant production of Shilin Town is taking in downward trend and such phenomenon may become even worse in the next five years. So we put forwards the corresponding adjusting and controling measures based on the dynamic analysis and forecasting results.",

        "abstract": "Beta-sitosterol (Sit) widely exists in natural plants, is classed as phytosterol and known as the \"key of life\". Most pharmacological studies and clinical applications are limited because of the fact that Sit is difficult to be solved. Therefore, it is viable to enhance pharmacologic activities of Sit by using its derivatives which can be obtained through the modification of Sit. In this study, 4 kinds of new Sit derivatives were obtained by the esterification reaction. Further, the hepatoprotective effects of Sit and its derivatives were investigated against acute liver injury induced by lipopolysaccharide/d-galactosamine (LPS/GalN) in mice and its mechanism was illustrated by western blot analysis and real-time PCR. The results demonstrated that among its derivatives, 2-naphthoyl Sit ester (Sit-N) (50 mg/kg) showed the strongest activities against acute liver injury. Final experimental results showed that Sit-N significantly decreased the serum activity of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT); Sit-N also markedly reduced tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Meanwhile, Sit-N drastically improved the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT), and suppressed the expression of malondialdehyde (MDA). Results also displayed that over-expression of Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) induced by LPS/Gal N were inhibited by Sit-N. Meanwhile, the expression of nuclear respiratory factor2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were enhanced. The results all above verified the effectiveness of Sit-N against acute liver injury induced by LPS/GalN mediated by TLR4 and Nrf2 pathways.",

The analysis points on different cross-sections were selected and tracked in the forming process to obtain the radial and axial metal flow laws for rolled piece in different positions.Because of the extrusion action of the top and sidewall of die teeth, the amount of radial metal flow of helical alveolar of rolled piece was basically same on the bottom of teeth and varied slightly on the top of teeth in different locations. Most of the axial metal flow amount was proportional to the distance between the initial location and the center of rolled piece.But the flow law in the sidewall was slightly different. The amount of axial metal flow at both ends of the teeth of rolled piece was larger, but the amount of radial metal flow was smaller.The conclusion was verified by the experimental data curve of rolled piece. The metal flow law obtained from rolling experiments was consistent with the simulation results.The metal flow law provided the basis for pass design of die.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated features and treatments of perioperative coagulopathies in cyanotic infants with complex congenital heart disease (CCHD). Thirty-six infants with cyanotic CCHD were involved and divided into two groups: In group H (n = 20), hematocrit (HCT) > 54%, and in group L (n = 16), HCT < 54%. Blood was sampled at anesthesia induction (T1), rewarming to 36 degrees C (T2), after heparin neutralization (T3), and 4 h after operation (T4). The hemostatic changes were evaluated by thromboelastograph (TEG). After surgery, group H was treated with fibrinogen-combined platelets (PLT), while group L was treated with PLT only. We observed the effect at T4. At T1, the hemostatic function in group H, deteriorating with the increase of HCT (P < 0.01), was obviously lower than that in group L (P < 0.01), but the PLT function was still complete. In group H, the hemostatic function at T2 decreased with a significant drop of PLT function (P < 0.01) and had little change of functional fibrinogen (Ffg) (P > 0.05). At T3, compared with T2, there were improvements in hemostatic function and Ffg (P < 0.01, respectively) without increase of PLT (P > 0.05) in group H. After therapy, PLT function in both groups restored to T1 level (P > 0.05); Ffg at T4 was significantly better than at T1 (P < 0.01) in group H, but Ffg at T4 with still normal function was lower than at T1 in group L (P < 0.01). Whole hemostatic function at T4 was back to normal and had no differences between two groups. So, we proposed that fibrinogen and PLT transfusion in combination should be better for infants with high HCT CCHD, but PLT alone might be enough for low HCT ones.",

There were 94 male and 51 female patients. The mean age when the repair was performed was (7 ± 3) months, and the average weight was (6.3 ± 1.6) kg. As to the pulmonary connection type, 77 patients were supracardiac (53.1%), 47 patients were cardiac (32.4%), 9 patients were intracardiac (6.2%), and the remaining 12 patients were mixed (8.3%). Pre-surgery echocardiography showed that 21 patients had pulmonary venous obstruction (12 patients were supracardiac type, 3 patients were cardiac type, 3 patients were intracardiac type, and 3 patients were mixed type).All patients underwent two-ventricle anatomy correction (the cases of complex malformations had been excluded). Peri-operative mortality was 11.7% (17/145). Because of the significant improvement in the surgical techniques, anesthesiology, cardiopulmonary bypass and the management of ICU in January 2006, the population was divided into two groups: A (before January 2006) and B (after January 2006). Peri-operative mortality decreased from 19.0% in group A to 6.2% in group B(P = 0.020). After analysis, it was determined that the factors impacting mortality were which group the patient belongs to, whether he/she had preoperative pulmonary vein obstruction and how big the atril septel connection was. The operative technique to keep the anastomotic aperture adequate and prophylaxis pulmonary hypertensive episodes contributed to the improvement on the mortality rate. There had been no case of repeating the surgery because of pulmonary venous obstruction during peri-operative care period.Improvements of the surgical technique as well as the treatment in preoperative and postoperative have led to the reduction of the mortality. Preoperative pulmonary vein obstruction is still an important factor that contributes to early mortality.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the effect of a new blood saving strategy on reducing allogeneic blood transfusion and early postoperative prognosis in low-weight patients with congenital heart disease(CHD). Methods Seventy-six low-weight infants with CHD were divided into two groups since August in 2011 to January in 2012.In the control group(n=38),all infants were applied with conventional priming protocol with 2 u packed red blood cell(PRBC) and 100ml fresh frozen plasma(FFP);All infants in the experimental group(n=38) underwent the new blood saving strategy with bloodless priming in cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB).The allogeneic blood transfusion in the two groups was collected respectively;the amount of chest-tube drainage during postoperative 24 hr and the changes of perioperative hemoglobin in each group were monitored. Results Each case in the experimental group was transfused with PRBC and FFP significantly less than that of in the control group(P<0.01);Twelve cases in the experimental group underwent bloodless CPB,and the other 26 cases were added 1u PRBC respectively during CPB,and no FFP were added in the CPB circuit.The chest-tube drainage during postoperative 24hr has no significant difference between the two groups(P>0.05);There was no significant difference between the two groups as to the mechanical ventilation and ICU stay time(P>0.05). Conclusion The application of new blood saving strategy has a significant effect on reducing allogeneic blood transfusion,and also it has no side effect on the recovery of low weight infants.If the patient's hemoglobin reached more than 120 g/L,the open heart surgery with bloodless CPB will be available.",

Twenty-three piglets were randomized to five groups: the control group (n = 3), DHCA group (n = 5), ACP25 group (n = 5), ACP50 group (n = 5), and ACP80 group (n = 5). Three control piglets did not undergo operations. Twenty piglets underwent cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and DHCA for 60 min at 20°C. ACP was conducted at 0, 25, 50, and 80 mL/kg/min in the DHCA, ACP25, ACP50, and ACP80 group, respectively. Serum S-100B protein and neuron-specific enolase were monitored, and brain tissues were assayed for the activities of caspase-3 and stained for the evidence of apoptotic cellular injury. Rise in serum S-100B level (post-CPB-pre-CPB) in the ACP50 group was significantly lower than that in the ACP80 group (P = 0.001). Caspase-3 levels were significantly elevated in the ACP80 group compared with the ACP25 (P = 0.041) and ACP50 group (P = 0.01), while positive terminal deoxyneucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotin-dUTP nick end labeling reaction scores in the ACP80 group were significantly higher than those in the ACP25 (P = 0.043) and ACP50 group (P = 0.023). Cerebral protection effects of ACP at 25 and 50 mL/kg/min were superior to that of ACP at 80 mL/kg/min as determined by cerebral markers, immunology, and histology.",

        "abstract": "Proceedings: AACR 106th Annual Meeting 2015; April 18-22, 2015; Philadelphia, PAImmuno-oncology is an area under intensive investigation, however, many questions remain to be answered due to lack of sufficient number of adequate experimental models: 1) why only subsets of patients respond? 2) who will respond (signature)? 3) what can we do to make more patients to respond? Patient derived xenograft (PDX or HuPrime®) mirrors patients’ histopathological/genetic profiles, considered more predictive than traditional human cell line derived xenograft (CDX) and also syngenic mouse cell derived models, due to the primary natures of PDX. On the other hand, both xenografts (PDX/CDX) grow in absence of immunity, thus unsuitable for immune-oncology research. Limited types/numbers of available syngenic cells also restrict its application. Genetically engineered mutant mouse cancer model (GEMM) are diverse (types/numbers)1-5, grow in immune-environment, and are primary tumors. However, GEMM has logistic limitation for pharmacology research for high cost and high variations in tumor development (spontaneous) in type/time.We set out to create a library of primary mouse tumor allografts (MuPrimeTM) as standard experimental models, aiming at overcoming these limitations. We established a number of such allografts and are profiling them for growth, histopathology, genomic (RNAseq), and standard of care (SOC). We are also charactering their immune-oncology properties: tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including different subtypes of T-cells (CTL, Treg), as well as their functional activation/suppression and tumor responses to immune-modulating agents. MBR6004 is an allograft derived from a breast adenocarcinoma of GEMM-MMTV-PyVT in FVB/N mice1, which expressed medium level Her2 but negative for ER and PR, and is resistant to Docetaxel(SOC). It expresses low-level PD-L1(CD274)/L2 and seems insensitive to PD-1 antibody treatment. MCR6013, an allograft of a colon adenocarcinoma derived from GEMM-C57BL/6J-ApcMin/JNju3-5, are currently being profiled. MPR6003, an allograft of transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) in C57BL/6 mice6-8, grow both orthotopically and subcutaneously, and are also being profiled. M6011, an allograft derived from a spontaneous tumor in Balb/c mouse with high Her2 expression, has apparent infiltration of T-cells, including Treg, but negative for PD-L1. We are currently characterizing its histopathology and other property. MLY1014, an allograft of a spontaneous lymphoma derived from Balb/c, is also being profiled. In general, these allografts keep the original primary tumor histopathology, but distinct from conventional syngenic cell line derived tumors, a contrast seen between PDX vs. CDX. The models grow robustly after engraftment, thus ideal for pharmacology evaluation. Our ongoing studies will provide a useful platform with normal immunity for drug evaluation, particularly for immune-oncology agents.Citation Format: Xiaoyu An, Jinping Liu, Jie Cai, Jean-Pierre Wery, Henry Qixiang Li.

In the third year, the photosynthetic parameters (photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, etc.) and production index were measured and analyzed. The results showed that: with the increasing of row space, the photosynthetic rate was strengthened. The photosynthetic rate in the row space of 30cm was highly significant lower than that of other row space. When row space increased, the trend of intercellular CO2 concentration and photosynthetic rate was reverse. Yet when row space was lower than 75cm, the transpiration rate, stomatal conductance and vapor pressure deficit was consistent with the photosynthetic rate. The photosynthetic rate was significantly negatively correlated with grass production because of the significantly negative correlation between the photosynthetic rate and the vegetative branches and total tiller. But the photosynthetic rate was significantly positively correlated with seed yield because of the significantly positively correlation between the photosynthetic rate and seeds and florets per fertile tiller. Therefore, under the appropriate row space condition, irrigating timely, because of changing transpiration rate and photosynthetic rate, would increase seed production.",

        "abstract": "A one-pot route for coaxial growth of crystallized Co(OH)2 nanowire arrays on flexible carbon cloth (Co(OH)2/CC) has been developed for high-performance bendable pseudocapacitive electrodes. The hydrothermal process is found to result in in situ generation of hydrophilic groups on CC (in situ functionalized), changing its wettability and simultaneously helping the nucleation of Co(OH)2. Electrochemical tests evidence that the Co(OH)2/CC can function as a high-performance electrode with a high areal capacitance up to ∼1.13 F cm−2, excellent cycling performance (nearly 100% capacitance retention after programmed 4000 cycles) and good rate capability (retaining 46.7% of its maximum capacitance at a high current density of 40.8 mA cm−2). More importantly, detailed bending tests further demonstrate that the electrode possesses a good mechanical endurance. Even with an extreme bending radius, the majority of the nanowire arrays can still survive and the electrode shows small changes in capacitance (only 7.5% loss) and impendance (u003c11%) compared to the unbent state. The unique mechanical merits of array architecture for robust flexible electrode design are put forward. Our work provides a direct strategy to grow ordered nanoarray energy storage electrodes with in situ functionalization of the current collector to achieve robust mechanical and electrical adhesion.",

Methods: The dogs were divided into five groups randomly (n=6): control group, gingkgo leaf tablet group (24 mg ·kg-1), 24, 12 and 6 mg · kg-1 PQFS groups. The myocardial infarction size (MIS) and the changes of the serum enzymes were determined by using the acute myocardial infarction models with the ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery of dogs. The parameters of hemodynamics and myocardial oxygen metabolism were measured in the anesthetic dogs with thoracotomy. Results: Compared with control group, the myocardial blood flow was increased (P<0. 05), the coronary resistance and myocardial oxygen were decreased (P<0. 05) in dogs treated with PQFS of 24, 12 and 6 mg · kg-1. The MIS and the activities of serum glutamic oxaloacetict ransaminase enzyme (AST), creatine kinse (CK) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH-L) were decreased (P<0. 01, P<0. 05) in acute myocardial infarction dogs treated with PQFS of 24, 12 and 6 mg ·kg-1. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was increased (P<0. 01, P<0. 05), but the content of serum malonyl dialdehyde (MDA) was decreased (P<0. 01, P<0. 05). Conclusion: PQFS has protective effect on myocardial ischemia thro ugh decreasing myocardial oxygen consumption and increasing myocardial blood flow in dogs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A novel solar cooling system, i.e., the solar absorption-subcooled compression hybrid cooling system (SASCHCS), is a better solution for large-scale buildings with many floors, but the thermodynamic characteristics of the system are not adequately realized. The thermodynamic model of the hybrid system is absent, and the design of the nominal cooling capacity of the absorption subsystem and the volume of the storage tank are not known. Consequently, this paper primarily examined the thermodynamics of SASCHCS. A thermodynamic model of the hybrid system was developed, and the working process and performance of the hybrid system for different nominal cooling capacities of the absorption subsystem and the volumes of storage tanks were analysed in detail. The influence of selected parameters on the performance was discussed. It was found that the performance of the system first increases and subsequently decreases gradually with improvement in the nominal cooling capacity of the absorption subsystem. The appropriate ratio of the nominal cooling capacity of the absorption subsystem to the area of the collector should be 0.148 kW/m 2  to 0.222 kW/m 2 . Additionally, the performance of the hybrid system increases first but subsequently decreases gradually with the decrease in volume of the storage tank. An appropriate decrease in the volume of the storage tank is recommended. This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of SASCHCS.",

        "abstract": "Objective As a complicated technology of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), deep hypothermic circulatory arrested (DHCA) is used in aortic and complex congenital heart operation. However, DHCA has potential risk of postoperative neurological injury. Currently, the mechanism of neurological injury induced by DHCA is unclear and it lacks of effective methods of biochemistry detection. On the basis of the results of previous animal experiment, the study focused on correlations between miRNA concentration in human blood and postoperative neurological score. Methods The expression of four miRNAs(miR194、miR-200c、miR-122 and miR-10b)was measured by reverse-transcription PCR in 21 patients with aortic dissection. Blood were collected at preoperation, and postoperative 0h, 12h, 18h, 24h and 36h, respectively. Canadian neurological scale (CNS) was used to evaluate the neurological function of patients in the same time points. Finally, linear regression was used to analyze correlations between the variation of miRNA in blood and CNS score. Results Expression of miRNA-194 in blood declined significantly after DHCA, accorded with the past results of animal experiment. Moreover, significant correlation was found between the expression of miRNA-194 and CNS score. Conclusion The expression of miR-194 in human blood was significantly related to postoperative CNS score in patients with aortic dissection. MiRNA-194 could be a biomarker for the neurological injury induced by DHCA.",

        "abstract": "Automatic texture pattern classification (ATPC) has long been an essential issue in computer vision. However, ATPC is still a challenging task since texture is a subjective conception, which is difficult to be expressed concisely by the existing computational models. The visual appearance of the imaged texture pattern (TP) visually depends on the random organization of local homogeneous fragments (LHFs) in it. Hence, it is essential to investigate the latent statistical distribution (LSD) behavior of LHFs for the texture image spatial structural feature (TISSF) characterization and expression to achieve a good performance of ATPC. We presented a probability density function estimation (PDFE)-based ATPC scheme, termed PDFE-ATPC. We demonstrated the Weibull distribution (WD) behavior of LHFs by the sequential fragmentation theory to explain the LSD of the TISSFs. To obtain the multiscale and multi-orientation detail expression of the TISSFs, we introduced an oriented Gaussian derivative filter (OGDF)-based TISSF characterization method, including the steerable isotropic Gaussian derivative filters (SIGDFs) and the oriented anisotropic Gaussian Derivative filters (OAGDFs). Successively, the LSDs of the filter responses were characterized omnidirectionally by a symmetrical WD model (SWDM) and the SWDM-based TISSF parameters, demonstrated to be directly related to the human vision perception (HVP) system, were extracted and applied to the ATPC with a spline regression-based classifier. Effectiveness of the proposed PDFE-ATPC method was verified by extensive experiments on three different texture image databases and compared with four commonly-used statistics-based texture classification methods.",

        "abstract": "Based on the fact that forming spiral tooth shaft in cross wedge rolling is complex, and rolling condition and process parameters have great influence on mechanics parameters, such as rolling force and rolling torque, forming process of rolling spiral tooth shaft in cross wedge rolling (CWR) was simulated and the influence law of different process parameters on rolling force and rolling torque was analyzed using DEFORM-3D finite element software. The rolling test was made in the H630 rolling mill and rolling force and rolling torque were respectively measured using AD7202 pressure sensor and TorqueTrak9000 torque meter, and influence law of mechanics parameters was testified through experiment. The results show that the rolling force and rolling torque become smaller with the increase of rolling temperature and bigger with the increase of the three process parameters including change rate of tooth height, rolling speed and roller diameter. The rolling temperature has the greatest effect on mechanics parameters, change rate of tooth height and rolling speed take the second place, and roller diameter influences the least. To ensure large enough load, lower rolling temperature, larger change rate of tooth height, larger rolling speed must be selected when the rolling mill is being designed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is well documented that transient acidosis during reperfusion is protective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cardioprotection of acidic buffer or plus cyclosporine A in isolated rat hearts after cardioplegic arrest. METHODS: Langendorff-perfused Sprague-Dawley rat hearts were perfused for 20 min with Krebs-Henseleit (K-H) buffer followed by 30 min of crystalloid cardioplegia and 60 min of reperfusion. Control hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Acidic buffer post-conditioning hearts were perfused with acidic K-H buffer (pH 6.8) for the first 3 min of reperfusion. Acidic buffer plus cyclosporine A hearts were perfused with K-H acidic buffer (pH 6.8) containing cyclosporine A (0.2 μmol/L) for the first 3 min of reperfusion. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, acidic buffer or plus cyclosporine A post-conditioning significantly improved myocardial performance, decreased cytochrome C release into the cytosol, increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased Bax expression, decreased sensitivity of mPTP-opening to [Ca2+] and the rate of apoptosis after reperfusion. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that acidic buffer or plus cyclosporine A post-conditioning prevented apoptosis-related mitochondrial permeabilization and provided the myocardial protection after cardioplegic arrest.",

        "abstract": "Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) is a complicated surgical procedure that is an effective treatment in reducing pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension usually results from incomplete lysis of a large organized thrombus in the main pulmonary artery and secondary branches, leading to pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, and subsequent death because of heart failure. Between March 1997 and April 2005, 30 PTE operations were performed in Fuwai Hospital, Beijing, China. They were 24 men and 6 women, with an average age of 45.7 +/- 11.4 years and average disease history of 48 +/- 12.6 months. Twelve of them were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 4, and 18 were in class 3. Seventeen cases were found with deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and inferior vena cava filters were implanted before surgery. The mean systolic pulmonary pressure was 91.4 +/- 22.4 mmHg, mean pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) was 56.2 +/- 8.6 mmHg, mean cardiac index (CI) was 1.64 +/- 0.47 L/min/m2, and mean saturation of arterial oxygen (SaO2) was 0.90 +/- 0.05. All operations were performed using the PTE procedure under deep hypothermia and intermittent circulation arrest. Perfusion management consisted of myocardial, cerebral protection, lung protection, and deep hypothermia with multiple periods of circulatory arrest and reperfusion at hypothermia, ultrafiltration, and cell-saving techniques. One patient died of infective shock post-operatively. Four cases experienced complications of the central nervous system. The mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 191.1 +/- 34.4 minutes, the mean aortic clamping time was 95.1 +/- 27.8 minutes, and mean circulation arrest time was 47.7 +/- 12.9 minutes. Improvement of hemodynamic status occurred immediately after surgery. Mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 91.4 +/- 22.4 to 48.3 +/- 10.7 mmHg, and CI increased from 1.64 +/- 0.47 to 2.58 +/- 0.51 L/min/ m2. PaO2 increased from 56.2 +/- 8.6 to 88.9 +/- 6.0 mmHg and SaO2 increased from 0.90 +/- 0.05 to 0.97 +/- 0.01. Twenty-six cases were followed for 36.8 months: 22 in NYHA class 1, 3 in class 2, and 1 in class 3. PTE is an effective treatment for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. The key to success is to adopt synthesized measures to protect the vital organ under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) from ischemia and reperfusion injury. Appropriate patient selection, perioperative management, improved techniques, and experience can optimize outcome.",

In addition, other excellent properties of the CNT/Ni NAs electrode, such as good reproducibility, long-term stability and anti-interferences, are demonstrated as well.

        "abstract": "Manganese carbonate (MnCO3) is an attractive anode material with high capacity based on conversion reaction for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), but its application is mainly hindered by poor cycling performance. Building nanostructures/porous structures and nanocomposites has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to buffer the volume changes and maintain the electrode integrity for long-term cycling. It is widely believed that microsized MnCO3 is not suitable for use as anode material for LIBs because of its poor conductivity and the absence of nanostructure. Herein, different from previous reports, spherical MnCO3 with the mean diameters of 6.9 μm (MnCO3-B), 4.0 μm (MnCO3-M), and 2.6 μm (MnCO3-S) were prepared via controllable precipitation and utilized as anode materials for LIBs. It is interesting that the as-prepared MnCO3 microspheres demonstrate both high capacity and excellent cycling performance comparable to their reported nanosized counterparts. MnCO3-B, MnCO3-M, and MnCO3-S deliver reversible specific capacities of 487.3, 573.9, and 656.8 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles, respectively. All the MnCO3 microspheres show capacity retention more than 90% after the initial stage. The advantages of MnCO3 microspheres were investigated via constant-current charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results indicate that there should be substantial structure transformation from microsized particle to self-stabilized nanostructured matrix for MnCO3 at the initial charge/discharge stage. The evolution of EIS during charge/discharge clearly indicates the formation and stabilization of the nanostructured matrix. The self-stabilized porous matrix maintains the electrode structure to deliver excellent cycling performance, and contributes extra capacity beyond conversion reaction. ",

        "abstract": "As promising candidates for next-generation energy storage devices, aqueous rechargeable batteries are safer and cheaper than organic Li ion batteries. But due to the narrow voltage window of aqueous electrolytes, proper anode materials with low redox potential and high capacity are quite rare. In this work, bismuth electrode film was directly grown by a facile hydrothermal route and tested in LiOH, NaOH and KOH electrolytes. With low redox potential (reduction/oxidation potentials at  -0.85/-0.52 V  SCE, respectively) and high specific capacity (170 mAh·g at current density of 0.5 A·g in KOH electrolyte), Bi was demonstrated as a suitable anode material for aqueous batteries. Furthermore, by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis, we found that with smaller  and faster ion diffusion coefficient, Bi electrode film in KOH electrolyte exhibited better electrochemical performance than in LiOH and NaOH electrolytes.",

The surface texture feature closely relates to the flotation working conditions and hence can be used as a visual indicator for the zinc fast roughing working condition. A novel working condition identification method based on the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) is proposed for process monitoring of zinc fast roughing. Three-level DTCWT is implemented to decompose the froth image into different directions and resolutions in advance, and then the energy parameter of each sub-image is extracted as the froth texture feature. Then, an improved random forest integrated classification (iRFIC) with 10-fold cross-validation model is introduced as the classifier to identify the roughing working condition, which effectively improves the shortcomings of the single model and overcomes the characteristic redundancy but achieves higher generalization performance. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   An experimental study was conducted on a four-cylinder diesel engine added with 0%, 10% and 30% 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF). The combustion characteristic, nitric oxide (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions under different fuel injection timing were measured and well discussed, especially the particle size distribution (PSD), particle number and mass concentration. The results indicated that the ignition delay time was prolonged with further addition of DMF, the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) was improved, and the diesel-equivalent brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) was reduced. It was interesting to note that the maximum cylinder pressure increased slightly with the 10% DMF addition under all of the studied engine conditions, but those with 30% DMF addition were more complex. For PM emission, the particles emitted by the engine are dominated by nucleation mode (NM) particles regardless of injection timing and the amount of DMF addition. Injection timing has a distinct effect on PSDs due to different combustion characteristics. The DMF addition decreases the number of accumulation mode (AM) particles but increases the NM number, which may be more harmful to humans and the environment. The geometric mean diameter (GMD) of particles are also declined with DMF addition due to the increase of NM number. The trade-off relationship between NOx and soot can be solved slightly when the engine fueled with DMF-diesel under suitable injection timing.",

Primary liver cancer is the second most lethal cancer worldwide and its incidence is increasing. Xin Wei Wang and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, USA, reviewed research on the genetic and non-genetic diversity of liver cancer cells. Extensive intra-tumor and inter-tumor heterogeneity contributes significantly to drug resistance and tumor relapse following therapy. The heterogeneity includes variations in stem cell character and other factors which can lead to different pathways of cancer progression. The authors discuss the methods available to analyze liver tumor heterogeneity and to use the results to devise optimum therapy strategies for individual patients. They conclude there is an urgent need to learn more about tumor cell heterogeneity in liver cancer.",

There were 22 male and 14 female. Mean age of the 35 children patients was 2.8 years, with a range from 2 months to 7 years. There was a 31 years old adult patient. Types of interrupted aortic arch include 30 cases of type A and 6 cases of type B. In all 36 patients, 33 cases had patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and intracardiac abnormality, including 28 cases of simple anomaly as ventricular septal defect and 5 cases of complex anomaly, two cases were single IAA arch without PDA and other cardiac defect, one case had no intracardiac anomaly but PDA. For 33 patients with PDA and intracardiac anomaly, median sternotomy was used to simultaneously repair interrupted aortic arch and intracardiac defect in 31 cases, left thoracotomy and median sternotomy were applied to repair IAA and intracardiac anomaly respectively in one case, one patient had palliative repair. For three patients without intracardiac anomaly, left thoracotomy was applied in two cases, median sternotomy and abdominotomy were used in one adult patient. Techniques of operation for interrupted aortic arch include 16 cases of conduit connection, 9 cases of direct anastomosis, 9 cases of direct anastomosis with patch augmentation, 1 case of subclavian flap aortoplasty. In all 31 cases of one-stage operation through median sternotomy, selective cerebral perfusion was used in 17 patients, deep hypothermia and low flow were applied in 8 cases, deep hypothermia circulatory arrest was performed in 6 patients.There were 5 hospital deaths. Three cases died of pulmonary infection, 1 case died of of pulmonary hypertension crisis, and another case died of postoperative low cardiac output, which was misdiagnosed before operation. Seven cases had other main postoperative complications. Thirty-one survivors were followed up from 3 months to 5 years, there was no late death and reoperation.One-stage repair through median sternotomy using selective cerebral perfusion or deep hypothermia and low flow can be applied to most of the cases with associated cardiac anomaly.",

METHODS: Rat plasma samples were processed by solidphase extraction and the concentrations were detemined by HPLC/ELSD (Evaporative Light-scattering Detector) method. The program of 3P97 was applied to process the concentration-time curves of 20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 in rat plasma after intramuscular injection(im) of 1.5 mg·kg-1. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of 20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 followed first order kinetics and plasma concentration versus time data were adequately described by an one-compartment model. The concentrations of 20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 in heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney were determined respectively. It was failed to detect the concentrations in brain, stomach, intestines, bodylipo, muscle and testicle. 72.8% of the drug was eliminated during 8 h by urine and 10.1% was eliminated by bile. CONCLUSION: The drugs can be absorpded quickly into blud and distrubted into heart, lung, liver, spleen and kindey. Most of them are eliminated during 8 h by bile and urine.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a low-temperature (T=70°C) solution-phase approach has been developed for the fabrication of vertically-aligned ZnO nanoneedle arrays directly on bulk nickel substrate. The synthetic process involving no seeds, no catalysts, and no surfactants can be readily scaled up. The as-grown ZnO arrays are further used for the first time as anode materials for Li-ion batteries operated in the voltage window 0.05-2.5 V. In the preparation of battery electrode, there is no need to transfer the obtained ZnO arrays to a different surface or align them; in addition, no conducting carbon and other additives such as binder are employed. These offer significant advantages with respect to the cost and practicability. Galvanostatic cycling experiments show that our ZnO nanoneedle arrays exhibit considerably improved performance (especially the cycling stability) as compared to the powder of disordered nanoneedles. A first discharge capacity of 1219 mAh/g and a reversible discharge capacity of ∼495 mAh/g after 10 cycles are observed (current rate: 200 mA/g). In contrast, ZnO film consisting of random nanoneedles has a smaller first discharge capacity (1090 mAh/g) and its reversible capacity fades rapidly even from the second cycle. The electrochemical performance of ZnO nanoneedle arrays can be further tuned by heat treatment of ZnO active materials at Ar atmosphere, which enhances the adhesion of ZnO to nickel substrate. Our results, combined with the fact that ZnO are cheap, easily prepared, and environmentally compatible, make the ZnO nanoneedle arrays a promising anode material for Li-ion batteries. © 2008 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Long ZnO nanowire arrays (NAs) grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses have been synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method without refreshing the reaction solution and applied as the precursor. By adjusting growth conditions, ZnO NAs with tunable lengths can be achieved. A nanocomposite made of ZnO nanowire core and TiO 2 shell was further realized by a novel fast-dip-coating method conducted in a Ti(OC 4H 9) 4-dissolved ethanol solution. The formed ZnO@TiO 2 core-shell NAs on FTO substrates were applied as electrodes for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). It is found that both the TiO 2 coating and NAs length play important roles in the enhancement of photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs. When the length of ZnO@TiO 2 NAs reaches up to 14 μm, the electrode can exhibit a maximum PCE as high as 3.80%, which is 2.6 times higher than that of pure ZnO NAs. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",

        "title": "Abstract B97: Response to checkpoint inhibition by GEMM breast cancer allograft",
        "abstract": "Background. Cancer patient9s response to immunotherapy, e.g. checkpoint inhibitors, differ greatly, likely due to their genetic composition (e.g. neo-mutation) or immunological profile of tumors. Experimental models may facilitate the identification of responders or of the approach to enhance response. Syngeneic mouse tumor models have been widely used as experimental model for testing surrogate immunotherapy, but limited by the fact that only a few are available and respond to the current checkpoint inhibitors. Allografts of mouse spontaneous tumors (MuPrimeTM) may be used as new type of I/O model with advantages: 1) its primary natures with “stem cell diseases” and relevant tumor microenvironment as seen in PDX1-5; 2) diverse cancer types and deriving from wider range of available spontaneous mouse tumors.  Method. We created a MuPrime, MBR6004, by allografting the breast adenocarcinoma derived from GEMM-MMTV-PyVT in FVB/N mice1. We then characterized the model by examine it subcutaneous and orthotopic growth, and its ability to metastasis. We also transcriptome-sequenced and immune-profiled the tumor, and assessed its response to different treatments, including I/O therapy.  Results. MBR6004 was found to over-express HER2 but negative for ER and PR. It maintains original primary tumour histopathology, grows robustly, and is confirmed to express its original transgene. It is also resistant to docetaxel. The orthotopic implantation resulted in lung metastasis. We can detected and quantitatively confirmed tumor-infiltrating immune cells, e.g. TIL, CTL, Treg, immune-suppression macrophage, NK, etc. We confirmed that the tumor cell expressed relatively low PD-L1, but inducible, per flow analysis. Our preliminary data indicated that it partially respond to anti-mouse PD1 and anti-mouse CTLA-4 antibodies when mice are preconditioned. Currently, we are investigating whether the responses are associated with the reduced Treg and increased CD8+ TIL in tumors, and also whether the combination therapy can enhance its tumor response synergistically.  Conclusion. Our data seem to suggest that MuPrime could be another type of I/O model alternative to commonly used syngeneic cell line derived models at present.  References  1.

        "abstract": "Patient derived xenografts (PDXs) mirrors patients’ pathology and genetic profiles, thus valued as predictive experimental models for studying oncogenesis and personalized treatments. Cancer is not a single disease but diseases of complex genetic components and oncogenic processes. Limited number of PDX models with minimal genetic characterization is insufficient to meet current research needs. For this, we have built the largest and most comprehensive PDX library with full genetic profiles. By far, our PDX library contains over 1,100 models derived from patients of both Asian and Western origins, covering over 20 major cancer types, including large panels (over 100 models each) of NSLCL(1), CRC(2), gastric(3), HCC(4), and pancreatic, and smaller panels (  Our large library of different disease panels are particularly useful in conducting mouse clinical trial (MCT of HuTrial TM ) (2, 5, 12), which can be used to discover predictive biomarker (2, 5, 13) and guide clinical study design.

        "abstract": "Bi2WO6 uniform hierarchical microspheres were grown on a large scale at 180 °C by a simple hydrothermal method with the help of the surfactant polyvinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were used to characterize the product. The result indicated that three-dimensional (3D) Bi2WO6 microspheres were constructed layer-by-layer from a large number of two-dimensional (2D) sheets, which were composed of numerous interconnected square nanoplates with a mean side length of 65 nm. Pore-size distribution analysis showed that both mesopores and macropores existed in the 3D microstructures. The formation mechanism was discussed on the basis of the results of time-dependent experiments. It was demonstrated that PVP played a key role in the formation of such hierarchical microspheres. By adjusting the amount of PVP, Bi2WO6 with different morphologies can be attained accordingly. UV-vis spectroscopy was further employed to estimate the band gap energy of the hierarchical structures. Our work may shed some light on the design of other well-defined complex nanostructures, and the as-grown architectures may have potential applications. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Novel flowerlike nanostructures consisting of Cu2O nanopetals were successfully synthesized by a facile wet chemical method for the first time. The synthesized products were systematically studied by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that the nucleation and growth of the nanoflowers were governed by a nucleation-dissolution-recrystallization growth mechanism. It is noteworthy that the initially formed Cu2O nanoparticles without addition of NaOH were crucial to the growth of the final nanoarchitectures. A UV-vis spectrum was used to estimate the band gap energies of the nanoflowers. Further control experiments were also carried out to investigate the factors that impact the morphology and size of the products. It was demonstrated that the concentrations of NaOH and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) play key roles in the formation of the as-synthesized nanoflowers. By adjusting the concentration of NaOH and CTAB, temperature, and the quantity of water, Cu 2O micrograss, nanorods, and pricky microrods can be synthesized accordingly. Our stepwise synthetic method may shed some light on the design of other well-defined complex nanostructures. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "To achieve fine segmentation of complex natural images, people often resort to an interactive segmentation paradigm, since fully automatic methods often fail to obtain a result consistent with the ground truth. However, when the foreground and background share some similar areas in color, the fine segmentation result of conventional interactive methods usually relies on the increase of manual labels. This paper presents a novel interactive image segmentation method via a regression-based ensemble model with semi-supervised learning. The task is formulated as a non-linear problem integrating two complementary spline regressors and strengthening the robustness of each regressor via semi-supervised learning. First, two spline regressors with a complementary nature are constructed based on multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and smooth thin plate spline regression (TPSR). Then, a regressor boosting method based on a clustering hypothesis and semi-supervised learning is proposed to assist the training of MARS and TPSR by using the region segmentation information contained in unlabeled pixels. Next, a support vector regression (SVR) based decision fusion model is adopted to integrate the results of MARS and TPSR. Finally, the GraphCut is introduced and combined with the SVR ensemble results to achieve image segmentation. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets of BSDS500 and Pascal VOC have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method, and the comparison with experiment results has validated that the proposed method is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods for interactive natural image segmentation.",

Methods Thirty patients underwent CPB were randomly allocated to three CS devices: Group C(Cell Saver 5+;Haemonetics,n=10),Group M(Autolog;Medtronic,n=10),and Group F(CATS;Fresenius HemoCare,n=10).Blood samples were collected from reservoir and transfusion bag.Reservoir's and washed RBCs were analyzed for erythrocyte aggregation index(AI),deformation index(DI) and hematocrit viscosity(HV),2,3-diphosphoglycerate(2,3-DPG),hemotacrit(Hct),hemoglobin(Hb),free hemoglobin removal(△FHB),glucose(Glu),lactate(Lac),as well as blood urea nitrogen(BUN). Results After processing,Group C(P=0.026) and M(P=0.032) had relatively higher erythrocyte DI compare with Group F.Group C had lower Δ2,3-DPG comparing with Group M(P=0.001) and F(P=0.001).Group F provided the maximal concentration of Hct(P=0.021;0.046) and Hb(P=0.008;0.013).In addition,Group C(P=0.035) and M(P=0.038) had the higher removal of FHB(ΔFHB) and had significant difference comparing with Group F. Conclusion CS devices use the same theory of centrifugation,however based on the different design,the function of the washed erythrocyte and undesirable content removal efficiency differs widely from one device to another.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To retrospectively investigate and analyze the complications of 107 consecutive ECMO cases performed in Fuwai hospital from Dec. 2004 to Dec. 2008. Methods:107 patients with the ECMO supported in Fuwai hospital were studied for the incidence of complications. The inter-surface of the ECMO equipment system was completely coated by heparin-coating technique. All patients were applied veno-artery ECMO and activated clotting time (ACT) was maintained between 120-180 sec and heparin usage dose was 5-20 U/(kg·h). Mean blood flow was 40-220 mL/(kg·min) during ECMO assistant period. Results: We support 107 patients (age range 5days-76 years,median age (28. 86 ± 25. 20) years; weight range 3. 2-100 kg, median weight (43. 49 ± 29. 04) kg with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 68 patients (63. 6% ) weaned off successfully from ECMO. 62 of them were discharged and 6 died of post-operative complications. 45 patients could not weaned off from ECMO. Total survival discharge rate was 57. 9% . They suffered the complications, such as bleeding,renal failure,infection,neurological complications,lim ischemia MSOF and oxygenator plasma leakage with the incidence of 32. 7% ,28. 3% ,13. 1% ,11. 2% ,8. 4% ,5. 6% and 28. 4% respectively. renal failure,lim ischemia,MSOF,DIC are significantly related to nonsurvival rate. Conclusion: the complications increases the risk of ECMO support. Bleeding and oxygenator plasma leakage are the most important complications of ECMO. During the ECMO treatment,it is also important of prevent from the complications. Once they occur,active therapies must be carried out to save the patients lives.",

The influence regularities of necking and internal defeats of process parameter were obtained. Rolling experiments were carried out to verify the correctness of the FEM simulation, and metallographic microstructure of rolled alloy was analyzed. The results show that with the increase of forming angel, decreasing transverse maximum stress and its duration time is accompanied by axial metal flow with a greater value than that of transverse metal flow and consequently lower the possibility of internal defects. Also, the value and duration time of transverse stress can be reduced by increasing stretching angle and thus lead to the lower possibility of internal defects. Besides, the decreasing forming angel and increasing stretching angel are associated with the reduced axis force Fz and as a result the probability of phenomenon about necking can be improved. The size of original austenitic grain is 11 μm in the central part of cross-section and the microstructure of valve is improved.",

        "abstract": "The previous study indicated sesquiterpenoids from the root of Panax ginseng (SPG) exhibited a significant antidepressant-like effect, which might be mediated by the modification of the dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic systems. This study was to investigate antidepressant effects and mechanisms on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression-like behavior of SPG. In the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST), SPG (0.25 and 1 mg/kg, i.g.) and fluoxetine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) effectively reduced the immobility time. SPG treatment significantly reduced serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-α and increased suppressed superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the hippocampus. In addition, SPG effectively upregulated the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), and sirtuin type 1 (Sirt 1) expression in the hippocampus and downregulated the inhibitor of κB-α (IκB-α) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) phosphorylation.

        "abstract": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, can activate immune cells including macrophages. Activation of macrophages in the central nervous system (CNS) contributes to neuronal injury. Bowman-Birk inhibitor (BBI), a soybean-derived protease inhibitor, has anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we examined whether BBI has the ability to inhibit LPS-mediated macrophage activation, reducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequent neurotoxicity in primary cortical neural cultures.Mixed cortical neural cultures from rat were used as target cells for testing neurotoxicity induced by LPS-treated macrophage supernatant. Neuronal survival was measured using a cell-based ELISA method for expression of the neuronal marker MAP-2. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in macrophages was measured via 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH2DA) oxidation. Cytokine expression was determined by quantitative real-time PCR.LPS treatment of macrophages induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) and of ROS. In contrast, BBI pretreatment (1-100 μg/ml) of macrophages significantly inhibited LPS-mediated induction of these cytokines and ROS. Further, supernatant from BBI-pretreated and LPS-activated macrophage cultures was found to be less cytotoxic to neurons than that from non-BBI-pretreated and LPS-activated macrophage cultures. BBI, when directly added to the neuronal cultures (1-100 μg/ml), had no protective effect on neurons with or without LPS-activated macrophage supernatant treatment. In addition, BBI (100 μg/ml) had no effect on N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-mediated neurotoxicity.These findings demonstrate that BBI, through its anti-inflammatory properties, protects neurons from neurotoxicity mediated by activated macrophages.",

        "abstract": "Aiming at further systematically comparing the similarities and differences of the chemical components in ginseng of different ages, especially comparing the younger or the older and mountain-cultivated ginseng (MCG), 4, 5, 6-year-old cultivated ginseng (CG) and 12, 20-year-old MCG were chosen as the analytical samples in the present study. The combination of UPLC-QTOF-MS, UNIFI platform and multivariate statistical analysis were developed to profile CGs and MCGs. By the screening analysis based on UNIFI, 126 chemical components with various structural types were characterized or tentatively identified from all the CG and MCG samples for the first time. The results showed that all the CG and MCG samples had the similar chemical composition, but there were significant differences in the contents of markers. By the metabolomic analysis based on multivariate statistical analysis, it was shown that CG, MCG and MCG samples were obviously divided into three different groups, and a total of 17 potential age-dependent markers enabling differentiation among the three groups of samples were discovered. For differentiation from other two kinds of samples, there were four robust makers such as α-linolenic acid, 9-octadecenoic acid, linoleic acid and panaxydol for CG, five robust makers including ginsenoside Re₁, -Re₂, -Rs₁, malonylginsenoside Rb₂ and isomer of malonylginsenoside Rb₁ for MCG , and two robust makers, 24-hydroxyoleanolic acid and palmitoleic acid, for MCG were discovered, respectively. The proposed approach could be applied to directly distinguish MCG root ages, which is an important criterion for evaluating the quality of MCG. The results will provide the data for the further study on the chemical constituents of MCG.",

        "abstract": "Pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies of 12-riboside-pseudoginsengenin DQ (RPDQ), a novel ginsenoside with an anti-cancer effect, were carried out, aiming at discussing the characteristics of the ginsenoside with glycosylation site at C-12. In the pharmacokinetic analysis, we developed and validated a method by UPLC-MS to quantify RPDQ in rat plasma. In the range of 5⁻1000 ng/mL, the assay was linear (R² > 0.9966), with the LLOQ (lower limit of quantification) being 5 ng/mL. The LOD (limit of detection) was 1.5 ng/mL. The deviations of intra-day and inter-day, expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD), were ≤ 3.51% and ≤ 5.41% respectively. The accuracy, expressed as relative error (RE), was in the range ⁻8.82~3.47% and ⁻5.61~2.87%, respectively. The recoveries were in the range 85.66~92.90%. The method was then applied to a pharmacokinetic study in rats intragastrically administrated with 6, 12, and 24 mg/kg RPDQ. The results showed that RPDQ exhibited slow oral absorption ( = 7.0 h, 7.5 h, and 7.0 h, respectively), low elimination ( = 12.59 h, 12.83 h, and 13.74 h, respectively) and poor absolute bioavailability (5.55, 5.15, and 6.08%, respectively). Moreover, the investigation of metabolites were carried out by UPLC-QTOF-MS. Thirteen metabolites of RPDQ were characterized from plasma, bile, urine, and feces of rats. Some metabolic pathways, including oxidation, acetylation, hydration, reduction, hydroxylation, glycine conjugation, sulfation, phosphorylation, glucuronidation, glutathione conjugation, and deglycosylation, were profiled. In general, both the rapid quantitative method and a good understanding of the characteristics of RPDQ in vivo were provided in this study.",

        "abstract": "In the machine vision based flotation process monitoring and control, it well accepted that the accurate froth image segmentation acts as the foundation of morphological features extraction of flotation bubbles, whose important roles of closely relating to the flotation production states have long been acknowledged. However, automatic and unsupervised froth image segmentation evaluation far has been largely subjective due to the complexities and specificities of the froth images. Namely, the conventional froth image segmentation quality is mainly judged by only on intuition, which cannot make sure that the morphological features of the bubbles measured by the image segmentation algorithms in the vision monitoring system are always accurate and representative of the real flotation production states. To advance the machine vision based flotation process monitoring and control for accurate morphological feature extraction, a novel unsupervised froth image segmentation evaluation method based on image gray-level distribution according to the characteristics of froth images is proposed, since the ground truth of froth image segmentation is always difficult to obtain. The number of highlights in the froth image is extracted and used as the subjective evaluation index by analyzing the gray-level distribution of each individual segmented region. The experimental results demonstrate that this method can offer effective qualitative evaluation results of the flotation froth image segmentations without providing the ground-truth boundaries of the froth images, which ultimately leads to the adaptive froth image segmentation algorithm selection and proper algorithm parameters setting to achieve the accurate morphologic feature parameters of the froth bubbles. © 2013 TCCT, CAA.",

        "abstract": "The practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) is hindered by their poor cycle life, which stems mainly from the \"redox shuttle reactions\" of dissolved polysulfides. To develop a high-performance cathode for LSBs, encapsulation of polysulfides with a blocking layer is potentially straightforward. Herein, a novel strategy is reported encapsulate sulfur and the electrolyte together in porous carbon spheres by using a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) that can selectively sieve Li ions while efficiently avoiding polysulfide accumulation and suppressing undesired polysulfide migration. This strategy is simple, straightforward, and effective. The carbon/sulfur cathode only needs to be cycled a few times within a voltage window of 0.3-1.0 V to form such a smart SEI, allowing the resulting cathode to exhibit superior stability extending 600 cycles. This strategy can be combined with other existing advanced sulfur cathode designs to improve the overall performance of LSBs.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most common indication for liver transplantation and the major cause of graft failure. A widely used immunosuppressant, cyclosporine A (CsA), for people who receive organ transplantation, has been recognized to have the ability to inhibit HCV replication both in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we investigated the effects of several other immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), rapamycin and FK506, on HCV replication in human hepatic cells. MMF treatment of hepatic cells before or during HCV infection significantly suppressed full cycle viral replication, as evidenced by decreased expression of HCV RNA, protein and production of infectious virus. In contrast, rapamycin and FK506 had little effect on HCV replication. Investigation of the mechanism(s) disclosed that the inhibition of HCV replication by MMF was mainly due to its depletion of guanosine, a purine nucleoside crucial for synthesis of guanosine triphosphate, which is required for HCV RNA replication. The supplement of exogenous guanosine could reverse most of anti-HCV effect of mycophenolate mofetil. These data indicate that MMF, through the depletion of guanosine, inhibits full cycle HCV JFH-1 replication in human hepatic cells. It is of interest to further determine whether MMF is indeed beneficial for HCV-infected transplant recipients in future clinical studies.",

        "abstract": "A novel octahedron-like hierarchical structure of Bi 2WO 6 has been fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method in high quantity. XRD, SEM, TEM, and HRTEM were used to characterize the product. The results indicated that this kind of Bi 2WO 6 crystals had an average size of ~4 μm, constructed by quasi-square single-crystal nanosheets assembled in a special fashion. The formation of octahedron-like hierarchical structure of Bi 2WO 6 depended crucially on the pH value of the precursor suspensions. The photocatalytic activity of the hierarchical Bi 2WO 6 structures toward RhB degradation under visible light was investigated, and it was found to be significantly better than that of the sample fabricated by SSR. The better photocatalytic property should be strongly associated with the high specific surface area and the abundant pore structure of the hierarchical octahedron-like Bi 2WO 6. © 2008 to the authors.",

        "title": "Pediatric Heart Transplantation: Report from a Single Center in China",
        "abstract": "Background:  Although heart transplantation (HTx) has become a standard therapy for end-stage heart diseases, experience with pediatric HTx is limited in China. In this article, we will try to provide the experience with indications, complications, perioperative management, immunosuppressive therapy, and survival for pediatric HTx based on our clinical work.  Methods:  This is a retrospective chart review of the pediatric patients undergoing HTx at Department of Cardiovascular Surgery of Union Hospital from September 2008 to December 2014. We summarized the indications, surgical variables, postoperative complications, and survival for these patients.  Results:  Nineteen pediatric patients presented for HTx at Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, of whom 10 were male. The age at the time of transplantation ranged from 3 months to 18 years (median 15 years). Patient weight ranged from 5.2 kg to 57.0 kg (median 38.0 kg). Pretransplant diagnosis included cardiomyopathy (14 cases), complex congenital heart disease (3 cases), and tumor (2 cases). All recipients received ABO-compatible donor hearts. Postoperative complications occurred in 12 patients, including cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmia, pulmonary infection, renal dysfunction, and rejection. Two of them experienced cardiac failure and required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The immunosuppression regimen was comprised of prednisone, a calcineurin inhibitor, and mycophenolate. All patients recovered with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I–II cardiac function and were discharged. Only one patient suffered sudden death 19 months after transplantation.  Conclusion:  Orthotopic HTx is a promising therapeutic option with satisfying survival for the pediatric population in China with end-stage heart disease.",

        "abstract": "Cardioplegic reperfusion during a long term ischemic period interrupts cardiac surgery and also increase cellular edema due to repeated administration. We reviewed the clinical experiences on myocardial protection of one single perfusion with histidine-ketoglutarate-tryptophan (HTK) for infants. This retrospective study included 118 infants who underwent open-heart surgery between January 2004 and December 2007. We divided the entire cohort into two groups: In group H (n = 63), myocardial protection was carried out with one single perfusion with HTK solution, and in group S (n = 55) with conventional St. Thomas crystalloid cardioplegia. The duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) did not differ between these two groups, but the duration of aortic cross-clamping time in group H was significantly shorter than that in group S (p < 0.05). During reperfusion, the spontaneous re-beating rate was higher in group H (p < 0.05). There were no differences in doses of inotropic agent and creatinekinase (CK) values on postoperative day 1 between these two groups, but the level of CK in group H was significantly less than that in group S on postoperative day 2 (p < 0.01). The mortality in group H was lower than in group S (p < 0.05). The HTK group had shorter cross-clamping time and more frequent spontaneous defibrillation than St. Thomas group. We propose that HTK is valid for some complicated cardiac surgeries with long term cross-clamping time.",

The as-prepared hollow structures were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical properties. A CuO hollow structure composed of nanocubes outside and a dense film inside was selected as a typical example of the optimized design; it exhibited significantly improved cyclability at a current rate of 0.5 C, with the average Coulombic efficiency of ∼97.0% and 57.9% retention of the discharge capacity of the second cycle after 50 cycles. The correlation between the structure features of the hollow CuO and their electrochemical behavior was discussed in detail. Smaller size of primary structure and larger internal space of electrode materials are crucial to better electrochemical performance. This work represents that Kirkendall effect is a promising method to fabricate excellent hollow electrode materials for Li-ion batteries. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The controversy over the benefits between normothermic and hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for children is still uncertain. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate the benefits and risks of normothermia comparing with hypothermia in pediatric cardiac surgery by randomized controlled trials.Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies reported in English up to September 28, 2013. Eligible studies were those in which investigators enrolled pediatric patients, who had cardiac surgery, randomized them to normothermic or hypothermic CPB. We prespecified the use of random-effects models to calculate risk ratios and 95% CIs for binary variables, weighted mean difference (WMD) or standard mean difference and 95% CIs for continuous variables. We assessed heterogeneity using I(2). When heterogeneity was absent (I(2) = 0%), we used fixed-effects models. The endpoints were serum lactate, serum creatinine, duration of clamp, and duration of CPB in pediatrics who had cardiac surgery in normothermic CPB compared with those in hypothermic CPB.The initial search strategy identified 3910 citations, of which 10 trials compared pediatrics and seven trails were eligible. These seven trials included 419 participants from seven countries. The serum lactate and the serum creatinine had three time points. The outcomes had no different between normothermic group and hypothermic group. Duration of clamp (WMD = -10.793, 95% CI -28.89, 7.304; P = 0.242; I(2) = 86.6%; 204 patients, three trials) and duration of CPB (WMD = -41.780, 95% CI -89.523, 5.963; P = 0.086; I(2) = 95.6%; 199 patients, three trials) also had no significant differences between two groups.Normothermic CPB is as safe as hypothermic CPB in children requiring correction of simple congenital cardiac defects.",

FESEM and TEM reveal that these ellipsoids have an average horizontal axis of 1.5 microm and a longitudinal axis of 0.6 microm. Experimental results obtained from the early growth stage demonstrate that the ZnO ellipsoidal structures are single crystals and formed from direct \"oriented attachment\" of two types of building blocks, that is, nanorods and nanoparticles. It is further found that the existence of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-10 000) is vital to the formation of the complex microparticles. Raman spectrum, room-temperature photoluminescence, and UV-vis absorption spectra are also discussed. This work presents a simple and effective route for large-scale fabrication of single-crystal ZnO ellipsoids with micrometer-scale sizes and 3D self-assembled structures.",

In this study, we use the CWR process to produce a hollow valve made of 4Cr9Si2 steel and present the experimental results. To evaluate the CWR process and deeply understand the deformation characteristics, a 3D finite element model (FEM) of the CWR process is established, and the mechanism of material flow, the temperature distribution, and the strain and rolling force are analyzed. The following conclusions are drawn based on the experiments and numerical simulations: changing the stretching angle (β) can effectively avoid swollen holes; the forming quality of the workpiece can be greatly improved when the forming angle (α) is equal to 35° and the stretching angle (β) is equal to 5° and 4° in the knifing and stretching zones, respectively; the CWR process is an effective technique to manufacture hollow valves for industrial production.",

        "abstract": "(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a major polyphenol component of green tea that has antioxidant activities. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces inflammatory cytokine production and impairs blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. We examined the effect of EGCG on LPS-induced expression of the inflammatory cytokines in human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMECs) and BBB permeability.The expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) was determined by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and ELISA. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) in hCMECs were examined by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Monocytes that adhered to LPS-stimulated endothelial cells were measured by monocyte adhesion assay. Tight junctional factors were detected by qRT-PCR (Claudin 5 and Occludin) and immunofluorescence staining (Claudin 5 and ZO-1). The permeability of the hCMEC monolayer was determined by fluorescence spectrophotometry of transmembrane fluorescein and transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). NF-kB activation was measured by luciferase assay.EGCG significantly suppressed the LPS-induced expression of IL-1β and TNF-α in hCMECs. EGCG also inhibited the expression of MCP-1/CCL2, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Functional analysis showed that EGCG induced the expression of tight junction proteins (Occludin and Claudin-5) in hCMECs. Investigation of the mechanism showed that EGCG had the ability to inhibit LPS-mediated NF-κB activation. In addition, 67-kD laminin receptor was involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of EGCG.Our results demonstrated that LPS induced inflammatory cytokine production in hCMECs, which could be attenuated by EGCG. These data indicate that EGCG has a therapeutic potential for endotoxin-mediated endothelial inflammation.",

Herein, we report a novel three-dimensional replication strategy to fabricate three-dimensional architecture of porous carbon for oxygen electrodes in lithium–oxygen batteries. As a demonstration, ball-flower-like carbon microspheres assembled with tortuous hollow carbon nanosheets are successfully prepared by completely replicating the morphology of the nanostructured zinc oxide template and utilizing the polydopamine coating layer as the carbon source. When used as the active material for oxygen electrodes, the three-dimensional porous architecture of the prepared ballflower- like carbon microspheres can accommodate the discharge product lithium peroxide and simultaneously maintain the ions and gas diffusion paths. Moreover, their high degrees of defectiveness by nitrogen doping provide sufficient active sites for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. Thus the prepared ball-flower-like carbon microspheres demonstrate a high capacity of 9,163.7 mA h g−1 and excellent reversibility. This work presents an effective way to prepare three-dimensional architectures of porous carbon by replicating the controllable nanostructures of transition metal oxide templates for energy storage and conversion applications.",

        "abstract": "The benefits of pulsatile over nonpulsatile perfusion has been widely debated in pediatric cardiac operations with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). To evaluate the role of pulsatile perfusion in pediatric complicated patients with congenital heart disease undergoing open heart surgery, we performed pulsatile CPB and compared several effects with nonpulsatile perfusion. Pediatric patients (n = 24) diagnosed as typical tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) were randomly divided into two groups: pulsatile perfusion (PP) group and nonpulsatile perfusion (NP) group. Pulsatile perfusion patients used modified roller pump PP during cross-clamping period in CPB, although NP cases used roller pump continuous flow perfusion during CPB. We monitored hemodynamic status and inflammatory media in blood samples over time in all patients. Effective PP can be monitored in PP patients and pulse pressure (DeltaP) was significantly higher in PP group than NP group (p < 0.01). Inflammatory media peaked at the time CPB was weaned off. In PP patients, IL-8 and TNF-alpha were lower after cross-clamp off and intensive care unit period than in NP cases. Free plasma hemoglobin concentration in PP group at preclamp off and CPB weaned off were higher than that of NP group (p < 0.05). Pulsatile perfusion can be successfully applied in pediatric perfusion. Pulsatile perfusion had the role of reducing concentration of inflammatory media in pediatric patients.",

        "abstract": "Objective The cerebral injury after deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest(DHCA) is serious problem and a few is known about its molecular mechanism.In this study,we constructed the DHCA piglet model to investigate expression profile of miRNAs associated with DHCA brain injury.Methods Six male piglets(2.0-2.5 kg) were randomly divided into the DHCA group and the Sham group,hippocampus were harvested for miRNA microarray analysis.All microarray data were analyzed by Significance Analysis of Microarrays(SAM),and this result was further confirmed by qRT-PCR assay,biological information analysis to predict the target of the panels of miRNAs,then the GO analysis to find the function of the target by MAS.Results Thirty-five miRNAs were differentially expressed in hippocampus after DHCA procedure.Thirteen miRNAs(miR-23a,miR-27a,miR-182,et al) were significantly up-regulated and twenty-two miRNAs(miR-10b,miR-200c,miR-210,miR-150,et al) were down-regulated in DHCA hippocampus.Bioinformatic analysis of the predicted targets for this panel of miRNAs revealed multiple protein targets,biological processes and functions involved in pathphysiology of DHCA cerebral injury including signal transduction,transcriptional regulation,apoptosis,and inflammatory.Conclusion DHCA cerebral injury involves a set of miRNAs dysregulated.MiR-10b,miR-200c,miR-210,miR-150,miR-23a,et al play important role in regulate cerebral injury.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal oxide nanostructures are current research focus for energy storage applications. We herein report the synthesis of MnO 2-NiO nanoflake-assembled tubular array on stainless steel substrate to function as pseudocapacitor electrode by programmed three-dimensional (3D) interfacial reactions, in which the ZnO nanowire array is employed as the low-cost in situ sacrificial template. In this 3D nanoelectrode, MnO 2 and NiO nanoflakes share the same \"root\" and form an integrated hierarchical structure, which adheres robustly to the substrate. Importantly, both MnO 2 and NiO contribute to the charge storage. The highly porous structure, which allows easy penetration of the electrolyte, gives additional merits. Detailed electrochemical characterization reveals that the assembled MnO 2-NiO array exhibits good rate performance and cycle life. In particular, it displays an areal capacitance that is four orders of magnitude higher than that of carbonaceous materials and significantly superior to those of previous directly-grown pseudocapacitive nanostructure films. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",
