        "abstract": "In this paper, the inductance characteristics of a novel 3-phase 12/10 pole (12-statortooth/10-rotor-pole) flux-switching permanent magnet (FSPM) machine with doubly-salient structure is investigated based on finite element (FE) analysis. Firstly, the topology and operation principle of the machine are presented. Secondly, the apparent (static) and incremental (dynamic) inductances are defined. Then, the conventional calculation method of transforming the 3-phase inductances in stator frame into dq-axes rotor frame is performed, which consumes lots of time. To avoid it, a newly simplified and fast method is proposed to obtain the d-axis and q-axis inductances directly and accurately at only two special rotor positions. The proposed method is validated by the comparison of the predicted results in two ways. The experimental measurement verifies the predicted results.",

The structure and features of the proposed motor are presented, and an optimal design is performed. By using finite element method, the advantages and validity of the proposed motor are verified.

The available analysis methods for traditional machines are not applicable to this generator. Therefore a nonlinear varying-network magnetic circuit model for the generator is established. The structure of the equivalent magnetic circuit is developed and the permeances are formulated. The nodal MMF (magnetic motive force) equations are developed and solved by using Gauss-Seidel method. Based on the analysis, the flux linkage and back EMF (electro motive force) of the generator are obtained. The results are verified by the finite element analysis and experiments on a prototype machine. Moreover, the computing speed of the proposed method is much higher than that of finite element analysis. It is shown that the proposed method is an effective and fast approach for predicting the characteristics of the generator, and hence lays a foundation for the optimal design of the permanent magnet machine.",

A control strategy is presented to control the energy flow among the wind turbine, the EVT machine, the battery and the grid. First, a maximum power point tracking control strategy for the dual power flow WECS is developed by controlling the stator-side converter. And the pitch control strategy for the wind turbine is proposed when the wind speed is beyond the rated value. Then both the off-grid and grid-connected control strategies for the inner rotor are proposed to adjust the power output to the grid. In addition, the battery energy storage system (BESS) is controlled to mitigate the wind energy fluctuations and DC voltage to follow the grid demand. The model for the overall WECS is developed based on the mathematical models and control strategies. Simulation results are demonstrated to verify the efficiency of the proposed WECS with battery energy storage and energy flow control strategies. \u00a9 2013 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press.",

The contribution of harmonics to average electromagnetic torque is analyzed based on the modulation principle and gearing effect, which reflects the similarities and differences between two FS machines in torque production mechanism. Moreover, torque performances are investigated from the viewpoints of magnetic parameters and electrical parameters.

The key is to integrate the battery-ultracapacitor hybrid power source into the switched-capacitor multilevel converter. Hence, the problem of high capacitive charging current of the switched-capacitor multilevel converter can be solved, and the dynamic voltage equalization of battery packs can be implemented. In addition, the ultacapacitor can help absorb the regenerative pulse power to improve the battery life, and lower the equivalent series resistance to improve the efficiency. A new converter circuit topology and its control strategy are presented. The simulation results validate that the proposed converter is particularly attractive for electric vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Flux-switching permanent magnet machine typically suffers from relatively high cogging torque due to its special doubly salient structure and high air-gap flux density, causing undesired torque ripples, as well as acoustic noise and vibration, especially at low speeds. In this paper, an analytical expression of cogging torque is derived based on a magnetomotive force-permeance model, through which the optimal design parameters and dimensions, such as combinations of stator slots and rotor poles, skewing angle, stator tooth width, rotor tooth width, and magnet thickness, can be determined. Based on the derived analytical model, two novel approaches for cogging torque reduction are proposed, i.e., asymmetric magnetomotive force and asymmetric permeance, respectively, and consequently, the optimal designs are also acquired analytically. However, it is also found that the optimal choice of the proposed techniques depends on the combinations of stator slots and rotor poles of the machines. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approaches is verified by both finite element analytical predictions and experimental results.",

This paper presents a double objectives control scheme for WECS. Based on the frequency separation principle, the wind speed is divided into two components, a slowly varying component, named seasonal, and a rapidly varying component, named turbulence. Then the double-loop control structure is proposed, where the controller has two objectives to maximize the wind turbine energy efficiency and minimize the torque variations of turbine shaft, respectively.

The key is to propose the closed-loop output voltage control for the current source inverter fed SMES to support the bus voltage at point of common coupling when the DPS is disconnected from the main grid. The droop control of voltage amplitude and frequency is designed to make different SMES units share the loads in DPS equally. To mitigate the effect of uncertain line impedance on power sharing, the virtual impedance control is added to construct a virtual output inductance for the SMES. The grid-connected operation is also proposed for the SMES to provide stable output power when the DPS is connected to the main grid. The computer simulation is carried out to verify the performance of the proposed operation schemes.",

The detent force is divided into two parts, namely cogging force and end effect force. More attention is paid to minimize the end effect force via searching the most suitable width of the end teeth as end effect force accounts for major proportion in the detent force.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a hybrid excited doubly salient (HEDS) machine, which can be used as the integrated starter-generator (ISG) for modern automobile and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The key of the proposed machine is to incorporate both direct current (dc) field windings and permanent magnets (PMs) in the stator, hence, offering a compact arrangement of hybrid field excitations, while the rotor is simply composed of salient poles without windings or PMs. The air-gap flux can be strengthened or weakened with a reasonable dc field current so that the electromagnetic torque and induced electromotive force (EMF) can be effectively regulated. To predict the electromagnetic performances of the machine more accurately, a new transient cosimulation approach considering indirect field-circuit coupling is proposed. Experimental results on a prototype machine have been given to verify the technique. The method is not only more efficient and flexible, but also more accurate and stable, which can also be used in analyzing other electric machine and drive systems",

Also, to further improve the reliability of control system, an OW dual inverter drive system is adopted. Furthermore, to better and clearer illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of multiphase machine system, the comprehensive comparison of three-phase and five-phase FTFSCW-IPM motor OW drive systems is carried out from the perspective of motor design and control system. The topologies and the features of the proposed two FTFSCW-IPM motors are analyzed, and the static characteristics are investigated and compared by using the finite-element analysis (FEA). Then, the evaluation of their OW drive system performance is conducted and compared by the simulation based on the MATLAB/Simulink.

Based on finite element (FE) analysis, the static characteristics are investigated in detail and a rotor-skew method is proposed to alter the waveforms of the phase flux-linkage and consequently back-emf to be more sinusoidal. The analytical equation of electromagnetic torque is modeled, and the main factor leading to the torque ripple is analyzed. It is found that the coil open-circuit flux-linkage waveform is bipolar, and hence it exhibits significantly higher torque density. Besides, both the phase flux-linkage and back-emf are essentially sinusoidal, which makes it most appropriate for brushless AC operation. The results build a foundation for the design, performance analysis, and control strategy of this novel machine.",

The topology, operation principle and static characteristics of the proposed three-phase 12/8 stator surface-mounted permanent magnet (SSPM) prototyped machine are analyzed based on 2-D finite element analysis. A comparison between the FRPM and SSPM machines having the same dimensions is presented including the field distributions, back-EMF, cogging torque and electromagnetic torque. In addition, an optimization on the key dimensions of the SSPM machine is explored to improve the characteristics of PM flux-linkage, back-EMF as well as to reduce cogging torque. The predicted results confirm that the SSPM machines with special stator slots and rotor poles combinations are attractive candidates in brushless DC drives.",

Compared with the steady state power quality, the main characteristic of the dynamic power quality is the short duration. The dynamic power quality includes voltage dips, voltage surge, and instant interruption. Because these dynamic power quality results in severely effects on the economic benefit of many manufacturers, it is very important to improve the dynamic power quality. The dynamic voltage quality is the main problem of dynamic power quality, and the voltage dips is most widespread than problems of other voltage quality. The voltage dips appears as the fall of the voltage amplitude and the change of the voltage phase. Usually, the main problem is the voltage amplitude. The dynamic power quality is analyzed in this paper. The dynamic voltage quality is the main problem in dynamic power quality, and the voltage dips is most widespread compared with problems of other voltage quality. The analysis methods and the control technology used to study dynamic power quality are introduced. The dynamic parameters, which can be used to describe the dynamic power quality, are rapidly required with accuracy by the reasonable analysis method, and the correct control technology guarantees the good dynamic performance of devices and improves the power quality. Custom power technology, which takes the customer's benefit into account, can effectively solve the dynamic power quality. The operating principle and the function of regulating devices based on custom power technology are analyzed, and the comparison among these devices is carried out.",

        "abstract": "Flux-switching and doubly-salient brushless motors are both novel PM machines having magnets in the stator instead of rotor with outstandingly different static characteristics, especially on the PM flux-linkage waveform, namely, the unipolar and quasi-trapezoidal one for the doubly-salient PM motor, whereas bipolar and sinusoidal one for the flux-switching PM motor, which inevitably results in the distinction in the toque capabilities of both motors. In this paper, based on the theoretical analysis and finite element calculation, a comprehensive comparison on the torque performance of the two motors are investigated under five classical working conditions, in which the flux-switching PM motor is operated in brushless AC mode, while the doubly-salient PM motor is run in brushless DC mode. It is found that the flux-switching PM motor has superior torque capability to that of the doubly-salient PM counterpart, which is verified by both the finite element analysis and experimental results.",

The stored energy is not released until the flux-weakening region is approaching. Compared with the conventional energy-release strategy, the proposed strategy is realized by raising the dc bus voltage instead of reducing the dc bus voltage drop. Two simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Reduced flux-weakening region and less copper loss are shown in the simulation results. Even though the energy-saving ratio 80.9% is small, the saved energy is still significant since the subway is the high power electrical system. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

In this paper, an optimum current given MPPT strategy considering the loss torque is proposed on the basis of the traditional power feedback MPPT strategy for the direct-driven permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). The wind energy capture efficiency can be increased by giving the PMSG optimum current through calculating the loss torque.

However, the air-gap field density is difficult to be regulated since it is produced by the stator magnets alone. Hence, hybrid-excited flux-switching (HEFS) machine is proposed by introducing a set of field windings into an original FSPM machine. However, in HEFS machines the flux linkages of armature windings vary in inverse proportion to the air-gap flux density when significantly saturated, which is different from the conventional machines. So in this paper, the oversaturated phenomenon in HEFS machines is explained and the effect of saturation, especially due to magnet material, on the relationship between air-gap flux density and armature flux linkage is investigated based on 2-D finite element analysis. Also, an effective stator-tooth-width coefficient (k stw) is defined to evaluate the oversaturated effect quantitatively. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.",

Firstly, the design principles of both motors are presented. Then, for a fair comparison, two motors are designed based on the same primary dimensions including the slot area, teeth number, pole pitch, permanent magnet volumes and coils number per phase, while the stator pole pitch and the primary structure are different. Finally, the configurations and static characteristics of both motors are critically compared based on finite element (FE) analysis. The results indicate that the proposed topology can avoid the asymmetry of back-EMF waveforms and reduce cogging force and thrust force ripple. Also, the proposed primary permanent magnet linear motors are suitable for the longer stator application such as urban rail transit (URT). \u00a9 (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

However, due to the high airgap flux density produced by magnets and the doubly-salient structure, the resultant cogging torque is relatively large, which is unfavorable for high performance drive system. In this paper, instead of conventional optimization on the motor itself, a new control method is proposed in which current harmonics are specifically added into the reference current to produce an additional torque component which is used to compensate the fundamental and 2nd order harmonic components of cogging torque. Experimental evaluations of the proposed scheme are carried out on a dSPACEcontrolled FSPM motor drive platform and the test results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

        "abstract": "Flux-switching permanent magnet (FSPM) motor is a novel PM machine with doubly-salient structure, having magnets in the stator and employing concentrated stator windings, which attracts considerable interests due to its essentially sinusoidal phase back-EMF waveform. However, to date, this inherent nature of this outstanding feature is not investigated, and will be studied in this paper. A typical 3-phase FSPM motor with 12-stator-teeth and 10-rotor-poles is designed and prototyped. It is found that there is a significant difference in the magnetic paths for the coil windings composing one phase windings, which causes harmonics in the coil back-EMFs to be cancelled by each other, resulting in essentially sinusoidal phase back-EMF waveform. In addition, the influence of the rotor pole width on the deviation of sinusoidal phase back-EMF waveform is evaluated by finite element analysis and the optimal rotor pole width for minimum back-EMF harmonics is obtained and verified by experiments on the prototype motor. \u00a9 2007 IEEE.",

But the nonlinear characteristics of SDFDS motor cause the EMF to be anomalous square-wave. It is difficult to control the field current by the close-loop of the EMF as DC motor.

To meet the mandatory requirements of distributed grid, the operational modes of DG consists of normal power delivery mode and multi-function mode, which aim to provide very sinusoidal active power current and compensating current simultaneously. A LCL based filter is placed between interfaced inverter outputs and the distributed network to smooth the output current of DG. The key of the multi-function concept for DG are the filter resonance alleviation, optimal control design, and flexible implementation. In this paper, the equivalent model of multifunction DG is developed first. Then, the proposed control strategy integrating odd-harmonic repetitive control (OHRC) and PR controller is determined to offer zero steady-state tracking error and good dynamic performance according to the equivalent model. A design procedure of LCL filter is also presented, while a cascade closed-loop control structure is employed to reduce the resonance effect. Furthermore, a multiple resonant control (MRC) scheme is discussed and compared with the proposed OHRC scheme based on their internal relationship. Experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control strategy.",

Thus, better power smoothing and robust operation can be achieved. For the islanding mode operation, the capacitor voltage control scheme is proposed for the CSC hybrid system to offer efficient operation when the wind farm is disconnected from the grid.

The analysis, control, implementation and experiments of the motor drive are presented. The magnetic field analysis is carried out using a finite element method. The split-winding topology is proposed to extend the constant power operation range. The control strategy for the DSPM motor drive is developed. Two operation modes, namely 4-phase and 2-phase operation modes, are proposed for the 8/6-pole DSPM motor drive. In 4-phase operation mode, a half-bridge power converter but without split capacitors is used to reduce the number of power devices and to eliminate the problem of voltage unbalance in the capacitors. The drive system is implemented and tested. The experimental results show that the developed control scheme can operate the DSPM motor properly, and the DSPM motor drive offers high efficiency over a wide power range and good dynamic performance. Furthermore, the 2-phase operation mode of the 8/6-pole DSPM motor offers the potential of eliminating the torque ripple of the motor drive.",

The proposed repetitive control scheme blends the characteristics of both odd-harmonic repetitive control and even-harmonic repetitive control. Moreover, the convergence rate is faster than conventional repetitive controller. Additionally, the parameters have been designed and optimized for the dual-mode structure repetitive control to improve the performance of APF system. Experimental results on a laboratory setup are given to verify the proposed control scheme. \u00a9 2012 IEEE.",

Due to its high power density, high reliability and easy cooling in magnets, this motor is a good candidate for electric vehicle (EV) applications. This paper proposes a new remedial control strategy for fault-tolerant operation of the R-FSPM motor drive, in which the copper loss is minimized. When the amplitudes of the remaining phases of the faulty motors are the same value, the reduced torque during fault can be remedied with minimum copper loss. The proposed remedial operation is compared with the existing one by analyzing the torque ripple and the copper loss. Finite-element analysis (FEA) is resulted, confirming that the proposed remedial operation can offer the acceptable torque performance and minimize the copper loss during the loss of one coil.",

The key is to design the interleaved PWM strategy for the VSC of different wind turbines to reduce the switching harmonic in the total grid current, apply the flexible positive- and negative-sequence control (FPNSC) to generate the grid current references, and adopt the double synchronous reference frame current controller (DSRFC) to track both the positive- and the negative-sequence current references. To estimate the phase angle and frequency of voltage at the point of common point, the dual second order generalized integrator frequency-locked loop (DSOGI-FLL) has been implemented, which has been verified to offer smoother and better transient performance compared to conventional phase-locked loops. The simulation on a low-voltage wind park including four VSC fed wind turbines verify the performance of the proposed operating schemes under asymmetrical faulty conditions. \u00a9 2012 IEEE.",

The inherent relationship between RC and resonant control (RSC) is comprehensively developed: the partial equivalence between RC and MRSC, the advantages and disadvantages of MRSC over RC-much faster convergence rate at the cost of heavier parallel computation burden. Stability criterion of MRSC systems, zero-phase compensation at each harmonic frequency, and rules of thumb for choosing RSC gains are developed for synthesis of phase compensation MRSC. The proposed phase compensation scheme enables MRSC to independently choose compensation phase angle and control gain at each resonant frequency. Accurate phase compensations and optimal weighted control gains at each selected harmonic frequency enable MRSC systems to significantly improve the control performance: wide stability range, high tracking accuracy, and fast error convergence rate. Experimental results of a three-phase PWM inverter illustrate the validity of the phase compensation MRSC scheme.",

        "abstract": "Flux variation of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) under grid fault and fault recovery leads to rotor overcurrent or rotor overvoltage, and it hazards to the converter at rotor side. For this reason a new low voltage ride through scheme, in which a series coupled compensation (SCC) is connected in series to generator's input terminal via coupling transformer, is proposed to overcome the affections on wind power system due to faults occurred in power grid. The superiorities of the proposed control strategy are as following: the transient current component in both rotor and stator of DFIG can be weakened, thus the unbalanced heating of both rotor and stator windings can be suppressed and the service life of DFIG can be prolonged;DFIG can still output active and reactive power steadily; the converter at DFIG's rotor side is controllable all along during the whole accident operation, thus it is possible to provide reactive power support to faulty power grid. Under the condition of symmetrical and asymmetrical fault occurred in power grid, a simulation model of wind power generation system with capacity of 1 MW is established by PSCAD/EMTDC, and simulation results show that using the proposed control scheme the ride through capability of DFIG under fault occurred in power grid can be improved.",

The operating principle is analyzed and the finite element method is used to calculate the flux distributions of 4/6-pole fully pitched DSPM machine. The static characteristics such as flux linkage, back EMF, inductance, and static torque show that the full pitched DSPM machine has bipolar flux variation, and the output power is equal to the previous DSPM machine with concentrated windings, with decreased copper consumption and higher efficiency. Moreover, two ways to improve the output capability of the DSPM machine are proposed. An improved three-phase 24/10-pole fully pitched DSPM machine was manufactured, analyzed and tested, and the result not only verifies the correctness of the theoretical analysis, but also reveals in the first time that the flux switching permanent magnet (FSPM) machine is a full pitched DSPM machine in nature and the higher power density of the FSPM machine is due to its increased airgap flux density by using more permanent magnet, instead of the bipolar flux variation. It also shows that the improved full-pitch winding DSPM machine has higher power output capability than the concentrated winding DSPM machine.",

After the structure of adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system is introduced, the recursive least squares method is improved and applied to modify the parameters of the network. Moreover, the forgetting factor and learning rate are optimized by using genetic algorithm.

The control strategy of the FT-FSPM motor is proposed for torque ripple minimisation, in which the key is to introduce harmonic currents to compensate for non-ideal sinusoidal back-electromotive force (EMF). Both simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed control algorithms can reduce torque ripple and offer good dynamic performance under normal and fault conditions. Hence, it can be concluded that the developed motor drive system is suitable for applications where reliability, efficiency and power density are of importance in such applications as electric and hybrid electric vehicles. \u00a9 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",

        "abstract": "Redundant flux-switching permanent-magnet (R-FSPM) motors are a new class of brushless machines having magnets in the stator, offering high power density, simple and robust rotor structure, and good thermal dissipation conditions. This paper proposes a new control strategy for fault-tolerant operation of the R-FSPM motor drive considering the capability limitation of the power converter. The key is to operate the R-FSPM motor in the remedial mode by injecting harmonic currents, the so-called remedial injected-harmonic-current (RIHC) operation mode. Moreover, the motor losses at the existing and the proposed remedial operations are compared for evaluation. Both cosimulation and experimental results are presented, confirming that the proposed RIHC operation can offer good steady-state and dynamic performances while reducing the motor losses and the capability requirements of the power converter during fault.",

        "abstract": "Satisfy the demands of the high efficiency of electric vehicles (EVs), the stator-doubly-fed doubly salient (SDFDS) motor for EVs can run with high efficiency in the whole velocity range by the coordinate control of field current and armature current. But the nonlinear relationship among field current, armature current, torque and speed makes the realization of the coordinate control difficult. As a new learning algorithm with fast speed and good generalization, the extreme learning machine for single-hidden layer feed forward neural networks (SLFNs) can solve the nonlinear relationship effectively. Thus, a coordinated controller of field current and armature current based on extreme learning machine is proposed, in which the SLFNs are trained off-line by the experimental data of highest efficiency, which composes neural networks with single hidden layer with two inputs and two outputs. And the convergence results of training, which are nodes and output weights, are applied for on-line control afterward. The experimental results show that with the proposed scheme the SDFDS motor could obtain apparently efficiency optimization in the whole velocity range.",

        "abstract": "The inductance characteristic of doubly salient permanent magnet (DSPM) motors is the basis of design, analysis, and control of the motor. Due to the nonlinearity and doubly salient structure of the motor, this characteristic is a function of not only the rotor position, but also the strengtheningandweakening actions of the armature \u00e8ux to the permanent magnet (PM) \u00e8ux, which makes the measurement of inductance di\u00e7 cult. This article proposes new methods for the measurement of the motor inductance for any rotor positions and level of excitation. The methods are applied to the two newly proposed DSPM motors and the results are compared with those obtained by \u00e9nite element analysis. It is shown that the proposed peak value method can correctly re\u00e8ect the in\u00e8uence of the strengthening and weakening actions of the armature \u00e8ux to the PM \u00e8ux on the inductance of DSPM motors.",

The traditional Sandia frequency shift method for ID becomes ineffective under certain parallel RLC loads. To alleviate this problem, a new methodology to optimize the frequency shift parameter Ks is proposed, and a novel non-detection zone (NDZ) mapping method is presented to map the NDZ influenced by each electrical parameter in this paper. An instability criterion relied on phase equilibrium principle algorithm is presented under specific loads to analyze the relationship between parameters and the reduction of NDZ. The proposed algorithm can keep the frequency of inverter output voltage deviating until the protection circuit is triggered with lower harmonic current. Single-phase photovoltaic grid-connected simulation system and experimental platform are constructed according to IEEE Std. 2000-929. Both the simulation and experimental results prove the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed parameter optimization algorithm. \u00a9 2012 IEEE.",

The originality of the proposed structure is that each phase consists of two \u201cE\u201d-shaped modules, whose positions are mutually 180 \u00b0 electrical degrees apart. Also, there is a flux barrier between the two modules. First, the structure and influence of some leading design parameters on the force performance of the complementary and modular LFSPM motor are analyzed. Then, a conventional LFSPM motor obtained directly from a rotary FSPM motor is optimized and compared with the complementary and modular LFSPM motor based on finite-element method. The results reveal that the proposed motor has sinusoidal and symmetrical three-phase back electromotive force waveforms and smaller cogging force and force ripple than the existing motors. Moreover, a prototype of the proposed motor is built to validate the study.",

A unified model for the coupled analysis with the same mesh is built, in which the material properties are nonlinear and adjusted on the basis of temperature distribution. Two-dimensional EM finite-element analysis is carried out with the temperature feedback from thermal analysis. The detailed temperature distribution is derived from the losses in the EM analysis. Then, with the force and temperature distributions, mechanical analysis of the surface-mounted permanent-magnet outer rotor with glass fiber is implemented to examine the mechanical deformation and testify the mechanical strength under rated working condition. Finally, with the coupled analysis, a prototype DMP machine is designed, fabricated, and tested in the laboratory. Experimental results are given to verify the accuracy of the proposed analysis.",

A new concept of equivalent capacitor CT of the TCSC capacitor circuit is proposed based on the dynamic simulation experiment of the thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC), revealing that the equivalent capacitor of TCSC circuit is not a fixed value but varies with control angle \u03b2. The effect of the fundamental frequency reactance XL of TCR on the resonance point and the controlled range is also investigated. The impact on the waveforms and values of current and voltage in the thyristor circuit and the capacitance circuit are analyzed.

Firstly, the definition of d- and q-axes for the FSPM motor, which is crucial to the mathematic model and control strategy, is highlighted. The fundamental relationship and equalization between the two magnetic fields where the magnets are in the stator and rotor, respectively, are analyzed. Therefore, the control strategies and the main control system are derived and presented, in which the current hysteresis and voltage space vector are adopted and compared.

In the doubly-salient PM machines, the phase flux linkage is unipolar, which compromises the back-emf per coil and torque capability, while its phase back-emf waveform is more trapezoidal and hence it is more suitable for brushless DC operation. In the flux-switching PM machines, the phase flux linkage is bipolar, and hence it exhibits significantly higher torque density. Both phase flux linkage and phase back-emf waveforms of flux-switching PM machines are essentially sinusoidal, which makes it most appropriate for brushless AC operation.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the control for the dual power flow wind energy conversion system (DPF-WECS) based on the permanent magnet electrical variable transmission (PM-EVT) machine. The PM-EVT machine can be considered as two permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) by ignoring the magnetic field coupling between the inner rotor and stator windings. For the DPF-WECS, the speed of the inner rotor should be controlled precisely to generate the constant voltage and constant frequency electricity. However, the rotor position of the inner PMSM composed of the inner rotor and outer rotor is difficult to be measured exactly due to the rotational stator and rotor. Thus the inner PMSM is hardly to be controlled using vector control strategy with the measured rotor position. In this paper, a sensorless control strategy based on the model reference adaptive system (MRAS) for the PM-EVT machines with double layer permanent magnet outer rotor for the DPF-WECS is proposed and evaluated by simulation. The effectiveness of proposed control strategy is verified by experimental results.",

The originality of this machine is purposely to add a magnetic bridge in shunt with each PM pole, which not only maintains the stator lamination in its entireness, but also amplifies the effect of dc field flux on PM flux. An equivalent magnetic circuit is presented to clarify the novelty and the finite element analysis is adopted to determine the machine characteristics. The corresponding results on a prototype machine illustrate that the proposed machine is promising for application to electric vehicles.",

        "abstract": "This paper develops a novel advanced angle control scheme for the stator-doubly-fed doubly salient (SDFDS) motor for electric vehicles (EVs) based on the extreme learning machine (ELM) so as to satisfy the requirement of EVs. The SDFDS motor runs with constant torque below the base speed and with constant power by field weakening over the base speed. To achieve high torque at low speed for cranking and widen speed operation range fro cruising, phase angle of armature current must be advanced. Hence phase angle control is the key factor. As a new learning algorithm for single-hidden layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFNs), the extreme learning machine (ELM) can solve the nonlinear relationships among phase angle, torque and speed. Thus phase angle control based on extreme learning machine is presented in this paper, in which the experimental data is applied to train the SLFNs in off-line way and afterwards, the trained data is applied to control the motor on-line. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the developed control scheme.",

The purpose of this study is to propose a novel operating strategy under synchronous coordinate frame based on internal model principle controllers, in such a way that it can provide more accurate tracking ability for generalised voltage references. Besides, the features of fast dynamic response, high stability and easy implementation are offered. The detailed design and analysis for the proposed strategy are given.

They have attracted considerable interest due to their essentially sinusoidal phase back electromotive force (EMF) waveform. However, to date, the inherent nature of this desirable feature has not been investigated in detail. Thus, a typical three-phase FSPM motor with 12 stator teeth and ten rotor poles is considered. It is found that, since there is a significant difference in the magnetic flux paths associated with the coils of each phase, this results in harmonics in the coil back EMF waveforms being cancelled, resulting in essentially sinusoidal phase back EMF waveforms. In addition, the influence of the rotor pole-arc on the phase back EMF waveform is evaluated by finite-element analysis, and an optimal pole-arc for minimum harmonic content in the back EMF is obtained and verified experimentally.",

        "title": "Design and analysis of a novel stator hybrid excited doubly salient permanent magnet brushless motor",
        "abstract": "Permanent magnet (PM) machines have been used widely for industrial applications. However, the operating speed range in most of these applications is very limited due to the difficulty of achieving field weakening in most PM machines. In this paper, a novel 12/8-pole stator hybrid excited doubly salient permanent magnet (SHEDS-PM) brushless motor capable of field weakening is proposed. By using 2-D finite element method, the corresponding static characteristics are deduced. Based on the operation principle and the static characteristics of the motor, the steady-state and dynamic models and computer simulation of the proposed 12/8-pole SHEDS-PM motor are also presented in the paper. It is shown that by controlling the field winding, flux weakening (or boosting) capability can be easily obtained due to the special motor structure with a magnetic bridge. This feature makes the motor a potential candidate motor in drive systems.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a topology of special rotor-type permanent-magnet (PM) machine named rotor-PM flux-switching (RPM-FS) machine, which is evolved from stator-PM flux-switching (SPM-FS) topology and exhibits high power density, wide-range speed regulation, and good overload capability. The operation principle of RPM-FS machines is investigated based on the field modulation theory. It can be found that the torque is mainly contributed by the dominant harmonics in rotor-PM field and armature reaction field with the same order and rotating speed, i.e., 10, 14, and 34 pole pairs. In addition, a comprehensive comparison of modulation principles between the RPM-FS and SPM-FS machines is conducted from three perspectives, namely PM field, armature reaction field, and torque production mechanism. It is found that the modulation principle not only reveals the similarities of operation principle between two PM-FS machines, but also provides guidance for the combination of stator slots and rotor poles. Further, the electromagnetic torque produced by the dominant harmonics in two machines is verified by finite-element analysis and experiments.",

The proposed control scheme, is easy for design, consumes less computation time, and yields high tracking accuracy and fast dynamic response. To testify the validity of the proposed control scheme, a case of two-terminal three-level VSC-HVDC system for grid connection of wind farms is developed in Matlab/Simulink.

The key is to design a chaotic frequency modulator, namely the chaotically frequency-modulated frequency modulator (CFFM) to modulate the switching frequency of SVPWM. Compared with the conventional fixed-frequency SVPWM (FF-SVPWM) and randomly frequency-modulated SVPWM (RFM-SVPWM), the CFFM-SVPWM not only suppresses the peaky switching harmonics, but also avoids the occurrence of mechanical resonance in induction motor drives. Besides, the vector controlled induction motor drives using CFFM-SVPWM can still provide good operating performance. Both simulation and experimental results are given to support the validity.",

        "abstract": "Flux-switching permanent magnet (FSPM) motor is a relatively novel brushless machine having magnets and concentrated windings in the stator instead of the conventional rotor-PM topology, which exhibits inherently sinusoidal PM flux-linkage, back-EMF waveforms and high torque capability. However, since the airgap field is produced by the stator-magnets alone, it is difficult to be regulated. Hence, a hybrid excitation method, i.e., by introducing a set of field windings into FSPM motor is employed. In this paper, a novel hybrid excitation flux-switching (HEFS) motor is proposed, in which the airgap field can be easily controlled and is favorable for hybrid vehicles. The preliminary topology, operation principle, design and static characteristics including phase flux-linkage, back-EMF waveforms under different excitations as well as cogging torque are evaluated based on finite element (FE) analysis. The results confirm the excellent field-regulation capability of a ldquoproof-of-principlerdquo HEFS motor.",

        "title": "Quantitative Comparison of Flux-Switching Permanent-Magnet Motors With Interior Permanent Magnet Motor for EV, HEV, and PHEV Applications",
        "abstract": "Permanent-magnet (PM) motors with both magnets and armature windings on the stator (stator PM motors) have attracted considerable attention due to their simple structure, robust configuration, high power density, easy heat dissipation, and suitability for high-speed operations. However, current PM motors in industrial, residential, and automotive applications are still dominated by interior permanent-magnet motors (IPM) because the claimed advantages of stator PM motors have not been fully investigated and validated. Hence, this paper will perform a comparative study between a stator-PM motor, namely, a flux switching PM motor (FSPM), and an IPM which has been used in the 2004 Prius hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). For a fair comparison, the two motors are designed at the same phase current, current density, and dimensions including the stator outer diameter and stack length. First, the Prius-IPM is investigated by means of finite-element method (FEM). The FEM results are then verified by experimental results to confirm the validity of the methods used in this study. Second, the FSPM design is optimized and investigated based on the same method used for the Prius-IPM. Third, the electromagnetic performance and the material mass of the two motors are compared. It is concluded that FSPM has more sinusoidal back-EMF hence is more suitable for BLAC control. It also offers the advantage of smaller torque ripple and better mechanical integrity for safer and smoother operations. But the FSPM has disadvantages such as low magnet utilization ratio and high cost. It may not be able to compete with IPM in automotive and other applications where cost constraints are tight.",

In view of the fact that traditional squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG) does not exist the LVRT ability, a new LVRT scheme using series coupled compensation (SCC) is proposed: the SCC is connected in series to the position between the stator of SCIG and the point of common coupling (PCC) via a transformer and is switched on/off in coordinating with bi-directional thyristor. By means of PSCAD/EMTDC a simulation model of SCC system for SCIG with capacity of 750 kW is established and simulation results show that in spite of various voltage faults, the SCC can improve the LVRT ability of SCIG unit effectively and suppress oscillation of electromagnetic torque by compensating the voltage drop at PCC.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the remedial operation of switch faults will be investigated comprehensively for T-type-three-level-inverter-fed dual three-phase motor drives. The open-circuit switch faults in multiple phase legs are discussed at first. The faulty conditions are classified into five categories. Different remedial strategies, namely Type-I to Type-V schemes, are proposed for different faulty conditions. In particular, three kinds of Type-III fault-tolerant control schemes are proposed by using medium-voltage vectors to synthesize small-voltage vectors, in such a way that the mid-point voltage in a dc link can be stabilized well. Then, the short-circuit faults in both clamping switches and half-bridge switches are investigated. By analysis, their operation conditions are equivalent to conditions loss of both P and N voltage levels and open-phase faults, respectively. Thus, the corresponding remedial strategies can be applied accordingly. Particularly, a voltage compensation control method is proposed for conditions, where open-switch faults coexist with open-phase operation induced by short-circuit faults in half-bridge switches. The validity of all of theoretical analysis and the proposed remedial strategies has been verified by experiments.",

In this paper, the open-circuit performance of an original 3-phase 12-stator-slot/10-rotor-pole HEFS machine is analyzed by 2D finite element analysis (FEA), and further validated by experimental measurement. Then an improved topology is proposed to enhance the flux-regulation capability. The improved topology shares identical motor structure with the original one, but has different field current directions in some field slots. Based on FEA, the open-circuit electromagnetic performances of the two HEFS machines are compared with more attention paid to field regulations. It is found that the improved HEFS machine exhibits distinct field excitation functions and significantly better flux-regulation capability than the original one.",

The method can be used to analyze the static characteristics of DSPM machine, in which the cross coupling between the permanent magnet field and the armature current field as well as the magnetic saturation are taken into account. The effect of rotor skewing on the static characteristics was investigated. There is a good agreement between the results of the nonlinear VSMC method and finite element method. The nonideality in the air-gap and the pole permeance are taken into account to improve the calculation accuracy. The modeling has been applied to a newly proposed 12/8-pole DSPM machine for evaluation. Experimental results on the prototype verify the analysis. The proposed approach is especially useful for design optimization of DSPM machines with different dimensions, parameters and conditions.",

The proposed motor offers high power density, high efficiency, high fault tolerance and low cost, suitable for maglev transportation applications. Both PMs and windings are set at the steering device of the train, while the only iron stator is fixed between two rails along the whole line. Meanwhile, the new motor topology incorporates the concept of fault-tolerant teeth (FTT) to provide the desired decoupling among phases. The electromagnetic performances are analyzed such as field distributions, inductances, back-EMFs and thrust force. Moreover, by adopting assistant mover teeth, two methods are proposed to reduce the end-effect. Furthermore, the short-circuit current is analytically derived and predicted. The finite-element analysis (FEA) and transient co-simulated results are given for verification.",

In this paper, a new doubly salient flux memory motor with high fault-tolerant capability is investigated in details. Under the open-circuit fault, a remediation strategy, named field-reconfiguration in brushless AC (BLAC) operation is proposed to handle the fault. Under the short-circuit fault, the AINiCo permanent magnet can be purposely fully demagnetized so that the doubly salient flux memory motor is switched to operate as a switch reluctance motor. Both theoretic analysis and finite element analysis results confirm that the motor can offer high fault tolerance while retaining high efficiency and high power density.",

Conventional control method, the controller with double current loop (DCL) in positive and negative sequence coordinates, has some disadvantages. This paper proposes a new control strategy which has an optimized design of the controller minimizing negative sequence current (MNSC). The performances between the conventional control scheme of DCL and the control scheme of MNSC are analyzed and compared based on the simulation. The results show that the control scheme of MNSC not only owns similar voltage ripples, but also has little negative sequence current on the condition of the same AC reactance and DC capacitor. Moreover, the control scheme of MNSC is simpler and faster responded than the conventional control scheme.",

The contribution of harmonics to average electromagnetic torque is analyzed based on the modulation principle and gearing effect, which reflects the similarities and differences between two FS machines in torque production mechanism. Moreover, torque performances are investigated from the viewpoints of magnetic parameters and electrical parameters. Then, electromagnetic performances including overload capability, flux-weakening capacity, and efficiency are analyzed and compared further. The predicted results indicate the RPM-FS machine exhibits a larger torque capability, a lower torque ripple, and improved flux-weakening capacity.

        "abstract": "A fault-tolerant permanent-magnet traction module is proposed for subway application, which has three different operation modes: normal, isolation, and fault-tolerant mode. In normal mode, 2 three-phase permanent-magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) are controlled by 2 three-leg voltage-source inverters (VSIs), respectively. The proposed module can output maximum torque and reach the maximum velocity. When one leg fails, the corresponding PMSM is isolated from the fault VSI and the fault subway train operates in isolation mode, in which the traction effort is reduced but the maximum velocity can be maintained under light load. However, the fault subway train will stop if the load is heavy. To avoid the stop, the fault subway train is switched into fault-tolerant mode, in which the healthy VSI and fault VSI are reconfigured to 1 five-leg VSI by a fault-tolerant bridge. Due to lower phase-phase voltage apportionment ratio, the fault-tolerant mode is not used until the velocity is decreased to half of the maximum velocity. In fault-tolerant mode, the nonadjacent selection principle is proposed to prevent the common leg from overcurrent damage. The subway train equipped with the proposed module can maintain basic operation performances if any leg fails. The performances are analyzed and the effectiveness is verified by experimental results.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a linear doubly-salient high-temperature superconductor (HTS) machine for wave energy conversion, which is composed of a tubular stator and a tubular translator. Since the translator is a simple iron core with salient poles, it is so robust that it can be directly coupled with the reciprocating buoy. The stator consists of an iron core with salient poles, DC HTS field windings and 3-phase HTS concentrated armature windings. By using the finite element analysis, the proposed machine is quantitatively compared with its permanent magnet and copper-winding counterparts. Hence, it validates that its performance, especially the power density, can be improved greatly.",

This topology, where the freewheeling inductance is placed at the ac side, uses a single switching device to control the output voltage and current. The main principle of the novel topology is described, and the operating performance is analyzed by simulation. The control strategy of the novel charger is discussed. Comparing with the traditional charging circuit, the introduced circuit does not add any devices. When the input current is working at DCM (Discontinuous Conduction Mode), the novel circuit has several advantages by changing the direction of the current of the freewheeling inductance. Both the output voltage of the rectifier bridge and the voltage and current stresses applied on the switching devices are lessened, and the input current harmonics is also cut down. The reduced stresses can prolong the service life of the charger.",

        "abstract": "Programmable AC power sources that provide variable-frequency and variable-amplitude output voltages are widely used in automatic testing equipment and bench top applications. Under various load conditions, a high-performance programmable AC power source not only can generate very clean sinusoidal output voltages, but also to accurately synthesise specified harmonic distorted wave-shapes. Digital repetitive control (RC) can achieve zero steady-state error tracking of any periodic signal with known integer period, but usually fails to provide precise tracking of variable-frequency periodical waveform with fractional period. In this study, a frequency adaptive fractional-order RC (FORC) strategy at fixed sampling rate is proposed to track or eliminate any periodic signals with variable frequency, where a Lagrange interpolation-based fractional delay filter is used to approximate the factional delay items in RC. The proposed FORC that offers fast on-line tuning of the fractional delay and the fast update of the coefficients, provide a simple but high-performance real-time control approach to dealing with variable-frequency variable-magnitude periodic signals. A case study of FORC-based programmable AC power source is conducted. Experimental results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed FORC strategy. It can be widely used in extensive applications.",

In this paper, to reduce cogging force and thrust force ripple, some complementary and modular linear FSPM (LFSPM) (MLFSPM) motors with mover/stator pole pitch ratio \u03c4m/\u03c4s of about one, namely, \u03c4m/\u03c4s = 10/12, 11/12, 12/12, 13/12, 14/12, 15/12, will be investigated using finite-element method (FEM) and experimental method at first. Then, another new LFSPM motor with \u03c4m/\u03c4s = 3 is analyzed. Based on \u03c4m/\u03c4s = 3, some new MLFSPM motors are designed, investigated, and compared using FEM. To fully investigate these motors, the optimal MLFSPM motor with \u03c4m/\u03c4s = 3 is quantitatively compared with the two optimal motors with \u03c4m/\u03c4s \u2248 1 . Finally, the general design principle for this series of MLFSPM motors with different \u03c4m/\u03c4s values is concluded.",

Based on the magnetic-gear effect, the magnetic field modulation function of the translator teeth can produce a high-speed magnetic harmonic to improve the no-load EMF and thrust force density of the machine. Based on the analysis of the operation principle of the machine, the power equation is derived using the equivalent magnetic circuit method and the initial calculation of the main dimensions is presented. By using the finite element method, the static characteristics of the proposed machine including the PM flux linkage, no-load EMF, inductance, cogging force and thrust force are analyzed. The results show that the LPPMV machine possesses the merits of high thrust force density and low cogging force. Also, it confirms that this machine is very suitable for low-speed and high-thrust force application, such as the wave energy conversion.",

Conventional dc\u2013ac soft-switching configurations proposed by Dr. Deepakraj M. Divan are invalid in TLIs because of the leakage current problem. In order to develop soft-switching techniques in TLIs, this paper proposes a new soft-switching configuration and a procedure to guide the invention of soft-switching TLIs. First, this paper proposes two basic resonance tanks related to dc bus polarities, and then, uses these basic tanks to elevate four popular full-bridge-type TLIs according to the proposed guideline. As a result, four soft-switching TLIs are gained. Second, this paper picks obtained soft-switching highly efficient and reliable inverter concept (HERIC) as example to analyze its soft-switching operation principle and performance. As a consequence, all active switches of the gained soft-switching HERIC circuit are switched under both of zero-current turn- on  and turn- off  conditions; the reverse recovery problem of freewheeling diodes is alleviated owing to the zero-current turn- off  of diodes; meanwhile, the common-mode voltage at the switching frequency scale is still constant. Finally, some experimental results from a 3-kW universal prototype at 50-kHz switching frequency are provided to verify the effectiveness of the main contributions of this paper.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a general design procedure for the flux-switching permanent magnet (FSPM) machine with different topologies is proposed. Firstly, a 3-phase 12-stator-tooth/10-rotor-pole topology is introduced and its operation principle is described. Then, the basic design method, including determination of the stator, rotor and magnet dimensions, is proposed under the constraints of some dimensions and electrical parameters. The winding turns are obtained by iteratively solving the base-speed and current equations simultaneously. The influence of current density and slot packing factor on the flux-weakening capability is investigated in the design stage to satisfy the torque and wide-speed operation requirement. Further, the output power equation, consequently, the sizing equation is derived for determining the initial dimensions of a FSPM machine, in which the traditional D2 sila is replaced by D2 sol a. Hence, the power density of different topologies can be compared directly by the equation. It reveals that the 3-phase 12/10-pole topology can offer higher power and power density than those of the 2-phase 8/6-pole machine by \u223c11% in theory under the same conditions. The experiments on the prototype motor verify the performance predictions. \u00a9 2006 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a totally brushless electric variable transmission (EVT) machine system is proposed for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The key is to cascade a double-stator permanent-magnet brushless (DS-PMBL) machine with an induction motor to form a new EVT machine system. It not only provides the merits of power splitting as other EVT systems, but also offers the unique advantage that the whole machine system does not involve any carbon brushes or slip rings. Hence, throughout the whole driving profile of HEVs, the proposed machine system can enable the engine operating at its optimal operation area at which its efficiency is the maximum. The control strategy and operation modes of the proposed EVT machine system are elaborated. The validity of system operation is verified by computer simulation. Finally, a DS-PMBL machine prototype is tested to verify its functionality.",

        "abstract": "This study addresses the mitigation of wind turbine loads and fatigue such as blade bending moments, tilt and yaw moments etc. Currently, the wind turbine blades are normally controlled to turn collectively to limit the excess of wind power above rated wind speed conditions without any load attenuation. The individual pitch control (IPC) is a promising way to reduce the wind turbine loads. This study presents a proportional resonant (PR) IPC, which does not need the measurement of blade azimuth angle and multiple complex Coleman transformations between rotational coordinate frame and stationary coordinate frame. The new strategy can attenuate the 1p and higher harmonics on the wind turbine blades as well as 3p on the hub without any filters. The wind turbine code fatigue, aerodynamics, structures and turbulence is applied to a doubly fed induction generator-based wind power generation system. The simulations are performed on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory 1.5 MW upwind reference wind turbine model. The simulation results are presented and discussed to demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the proposed PR IPC method. \u00a9 The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.",

        "abstract": "The HEFS machines were proposed by reducing the permanent magnet (PM) length of a flux-switching permanent magnet (FSPM) machine and introducing a set of field windings into the saved space. Thus, the HEFS machines shares the identical motor laminations, meanwhile different PM and field winding locations. Based on 2D finite element analysis (FEA), this paper is focused on the comparison of electromagnetic performances of the HEFS machines with more attention paid to open-circuit flux-regulation capabilities and torque capabilities. Hybrid conditions employing Ferrite and NdFeB are discussed, respectively. Both the predicted airgap flux-densities and phase flux linkages under field currents reveal that different configurations of magnets and field windings have distinct influences on the flux-regulation capabilities. And compared to FSPM machines, reducing the magnet length can result in significantly reduced torque density in the HEFS machines. Overall, the HEFS machine having magnets located adjacent to the air-gap exhibits strongest flux-regulation and torque capabilities. The FEA predictions are validated by experimental measurements on the prototype machines.",

With the inverse Park transform based PLL technique, the proposed control scheme in this paper can adapt the change in grid voltage and frequency effectively. Meanwhile, the PV power generation system can switch between the single-stage operation and the two-stage operation modes by controlling the boost converter, which links the PV modules and the grid inverter.

But it is difficult to get satisfied control characteristics by using normal linear proporition integral (PI) controller due to the high nonlinearity between speed and current or torque. To solve this problem, a fuzzy self-adaptive PI controller is designed by combining the strength of high flexibility and high robustness of fuzzy controller with the strength of high precision of conventional PI control. The simulation and experimental results verify that the fuzzy self-adaptive PI controller can inherit the advantages of the fuzzy controller and the conventional PID controller, improve the dynamic and the static performance and adaptability of the SDFDS motor drive significantly.",

By unequal distribution of the zero voltage vector, the proposed method can well suppress the zero-sequence current caused by the dead-time effect that the conventional eliminating method cannot be achieved. First, the dead-time effect to the zero-sequence current is discussed. Then the zero-axis controller is designed to obtain the reference common-mode voltage. Last, according to the principle of the unequal zero voltage vector distribution, the switching sequence of the two inverters can be calculated, and the maximum modulation index is also first deduced in detail. The proposed method is proved by the simulation and experimental results.",

Based on the analysis of the characteristics of fault tolerant machines, a new brushless machine, termed as doubly salient permanent magnet (DSPM) machine is presented. The DSPM machine combines the advantages of the switched reluctance machine and the fault tolerant permanent magnet (PM) machine with PMs located in the rotor. The recent literature shows that the DSPM machine is of high reliability and high power density. To improve the electromagnetic performance of faulty operation, a remedial strategy is proposed for the DSPM machine. A co-simulation model is developed and performed to predict fault response of the DSPM motor drive. The results show high performance of fault tolerance in DSPM motor drives. It is proved that DSPM motor is a new class of fault tolerant machine and this work lays a foundation for the research on novel stator-PM fault tolerant machines.",

        "abstract": "Motor current signature analysis based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) has been successfully used in a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive system for fault diagnosis. However, the method does not always achieve good results according to two aspects. Firstly, the amplitudes of fault harmonic components are quiet small compared with the fundamental amplitude if the fault severity is small. Then fault characters are likely to be hidden and difficult to be distinguished in the stator current. Secondly, as the speed is not constant and this causes variation on the fault characteristic frequencies where FFT is no longer suitable. This paper presents a novel method to diagnose the mechanical unbalance for a PMSM drive system under nonstationary condition, which is based on Park's vector and discrete wavelet transform. Simulations are carried out in the PMSM drive system based on MATLAB/Simulation and fault indicators are successfully extracted from the square of the stator current Park's vector modulus. The simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively detect the mechanical unbalance fault in the PMSM drive system under nonstationary condition, and the method is suitable for different control strategies. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a fast switching direct torque control (FS-DTC) using only a single DC-link current sensor. In FS-DTC, six new active voltage complex space vectors (CSVs) are synthesized by the conventional active voltage space vectors (SVs). The corresponding sectors are rotated in the anticlockwise direction by 30 degrees. A selection table is defined to select the CSVs. Based on the \"Different Phase Mode\", the output sequence of the selected CSV is optimized. Accordingly, a reconstruction method is proposed to acquire the phase currents. The core of the FS-DTC is that all of the three phase currents can be reliably reconstructed during every two sampling periods, which is the result of the fast switching between different phases. The errors between the reconstructed and actual currents are strictly limited in one sampling period. The FS-DTC has the advantages of the standard DTC scheme such as simple structure, quick torque response and robustness. As can be seen in the analysis, the FS-DTC can be thought of as an equivalent standard DTC scheme with 86.6% of the maximum speed, 173.2% of the torque ripple, and 115% of the response time of the torque. Based on a dSPACE DS1103 controller, the FS-DTC is implemented in an induction machine drive system. The results verify the effectiveness of the FS-DTC.",

Four parameters of the controller were optimized through genetic algorithm. The dynamic model of the drive was presented. The controller was easily implemented on singlechip Intel N87C196KD. Both the theoretical simulation and the experiments on a new 8/6-pole DSPM motor drive were carried out.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a flexible enhanced power quality strategy for a multi-function distributed generation (DG) in an aggregated system. Being a multi-function DG system, the grid-interfaced inverter can provide very sinusoidal current and harmonic compensating current simultaneously. Different from the classic strategy where the compensating current is directly calculated by the measured harmonic content in the load current, the proposed power quality control strategy presents a more flexible way using a voltage-controlled approach based on the virtual impedance theory. As a result, each individual DG can provide harmonic compensation functionality independently and the power quality of grid current can be enhanced. This paper first develops an aggregated DGs model using continuous timedomain equivalent circuit. The classic and proposed power quality control strategies can then be derived from the developed models. The proposed control strategy is performed by the virtual harmonic impedance method, which can promote the output current of each individual DG itself and compensate harmonics caused by the other DGs. The proposed control strategy can be seamlessly incorporated into the conventional PR control scheme, and maintain both the stead-state and transient performance within the control bandwidth.

This paper presents a new 6k\u00b11 order harmonic RC (6k\u00b11 RC) scheme for CVCF three-phase PWM inverter systems to further improve the control performance of RC. The proposed control scheme can achieve zero-error tracking or perfect disturbance rejection for 6k\u00b11 order harmonics. Compared with conventional RC (CRC), 6k\u00b11 RC requires less data memory and offers faster error convergence rate. It also yields very low THD and very high tracking accuracy. In the presence of nonlinear load disturbances, an application example of a 6k\u00b11 RC controlled three-phase PWM inverter is provided to evaluate the proposed 6k\u00b11 RC scheme. Experimental results show the validity and advantages of the proposed 6k\u00b11 RC scheme.",

Hence, in this paper, two fault tolerant current control strategies for a nine-phase flux-switching permanent magnet (FSPM) machine are proposed and implemented when one or two phases meet the open-circuit fault. The basic concepts of the two control strategies are to keep the rotating magnetomotive force unchanged under both healthy and faulty conditions. Based on the principle, an optimal solution is derived through comparing the magnitudes of fault tolerant currents, average output torque, and torque ripple. The finite element analysis-based predictions of the nine-phase FSPM machine verify the effectiveness and difference of the two fault tolerant control strategies.",

Based on finite element analysis (FEA), the static characteristics are investigated, including the magnetic field and flux density distributions in the airgap at no-load and one-phase-on conditions. Hence, the open-circuit flux-linkage, back-EMF, cogging torque, winding inductance and static torque are deduced. The effect on the inductance of the cross-coupling between the permanent magnet field and armature field are taken into account. It shows that the phase open-circuit flux-linkage waveform is bipolar, hence it exhibits significantly higher torque density. Besides, both the phase flux-linkage and phase back-EMF are essentially sinusoidal, which makes it most appropriate for brushless AC operation. The results lay a foundation for the design, performance analysis, and operation control of the machine.",

The proposed scheme employs only one current sensor at DC-link side of the inverter, and can be applied to a motor without knowing its parameters and additional position sensors.

        "abstract": "This paper presents an out-rotor 12/8 pole doubly salient permanent magnet (DSPM) generator. Finite element analysis of this generator is carried out to investigate the magnetic field distribution at different rotor positions and load currents. Hence, the characteristics of the proposed generator are deduced, the steady-state and dynamic models are presented and output power equation is derived. In this paper, two types of power electronics circuits for converting the AC output of the DSPM generator to DC power have been presented. Based on the dynamic models of DSPM generator, the simulation with different output circuit is carried out. From the simulated results, it can be seen that by using a diode rectifier with constant DC link current, more output power can be achieved from DSPM generator.",

Plate and shell structures in transformer, vehicle or airplane applications vibrating in resonance show particularly high noise levels. Classic methods of noise reduction such as passive damping or anti-noise are not efficient enough in certain cases. Therefore, the use of structural control for reduction of sound radiation is presented in this paper. A piezoelectric ceramic actuator (PCA) for the active noise control is also proposed. The structure of the proposed PCA is discussed and the control method of the structure is carried out. The proposed PCA has excellent performance compared with conventional ones, such as more force, convenient installation and disassembly. The active noise control (ANC) system and control algorithm are also discussed in this paper. The performance of the proposed controller is analyzed through simulation in the Matlab/Simulink. \u00a9 (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

The distinct topology and operation principle are analyzed by using a 3-phase 24/22-pole prototyped machine as an example. Based on finite element method, the design aspects of the prototyped generator are presented. Finally, the experimental results from the prototyped machine, including electro-motive-force (EMF), electromagnetic torque, output power and efficiency validate the design. It shows that the open-circuit EMF waveforms are inherently sinusoidal with concentrated windings and without skewing of stator slots or rotor poles, and hence it exhibits significantly higher torque density and efficiency. The results lay a new choice for small wind power generation systems.",

This paper proposes two remedial control strategies for fault-tolerant operations of the R-FSPM motor drive in the single-channel (SC) mode. First, by doubling the healthy-channel currents, the reduced torque due to one channel loss can be remedied, the so-called remedial brushless AC (BLAC) operation mode. Second, by injecting harmonic current (IHC) considering harmonic back-EMF effect, the reduced torque can also be smoothly remedied, the so-called remedial IHC operation mode. Finally, both of the proposed remedial control strategies are verified by co-simulation and experimentation, hence confirming the validity of the proposed fault-tolerant R-FSPM motor drive.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to propose and design proper control strategies for the current-source inverter (CSI) based distributed generation under unbalanced grid conditions. The key is to apply two power schemes, namely the flexible positive and negative sequence control (FPNSC) and the positive and negative sequence control (PNSC) to generate current references for CSI grid inverters. The FPNSC offers the symmetrical current references but suffers from the power oscillations inevitable. The PNSC offers the smoother active or reactive power but needs to inject asymmetrical grid currents. The closed-loop grid current controllers are designed in both positive and negative-sequence frames for accurate regulation. The feedforward capacitor current compensation and active damping are designed to improve the system dynamics and suppress the LC resonance. The frequency lock loop (FLL) is used to track the grid angle for the controller under unbalanced grid conditions. Based on simulation, the performance of the proposed control strategies on the 4.16-kV CSI fed renewable energy system (CSI-RE) and CSI fed superconducting magnetic energy storage (CSI-SMES) are verified in this paper. \u00a9 2012 IEEE.",

In this paper, a fault-tolerant direct torque control for a five-phase fault-tolerant fractional-slot concentrated-winding interior-permanent-magnet (FTFSCW-IPM) motor under the open-circuit condition of a single phase is proposed, in which an analogous three-phase space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) control strategy is adopted. The DTC system for the five-phase PM motor based on healthy SVPWM has several advantages of improved currents and low torque and flux ripples. To achieve the fault-tolerant operation of the SVPWM-DTC system, an analogous three-phase SVPWM strategy is proposed. The proposed SVPWM fault-tolerant control scheme is achieved by the division of six sectors and the reconfiguration of six equal nonzero voltage vectors, which is quickly computed and easily realized. In addition, based on a 2-kW FTFSCW-IPM motor prototype, the good performances of the proposed fault-tolerant drive are validated by both simulations and experiments, in which the average torque and low torque ripple during fault can be maintained. Finally, the dynamic performances under healthy and fault-tolerant conditions are measured. The results show that the proposed analogous three-phase SVPWM control can offer good dynamic performance, which is comparable to the healthy SVPWM.",

According to the PM locations, three typical topologies of HEFS machines are emerged, namely PM-Top, PM-Bottom and PM-Middle, respectively. The preliminary analysis indicates that different configurations of magnets and field windings have significant influences on the electromagnetic performance of HEFS machines. Hence, this paper is focused on the flux-regulation theories and principles of the three topologies of HEFS machines employing two typical magnet materials, namely, Ferrite and NdFeB respectively. It is found that the field winding in the PM-Top machine exhibits reversal flux-regulation functions to that in the PM-Bottom one. The weakest flux-regulation capability is found in the PM-Middle one, since which can be considered as a combination of PM-Top and PM-Bottom ones. Overall, the highest magnet utilization and a strongest flux-regulation capability are exhibited in the PM-Bottom HEFS machine. The theoretical analysis are validated by both 2D finite element analysis (FEA) based predictions and experimental measurements on three prototype HEFS machines.",

When hybrid-excitation is applied, post-fault armature currents can be reduced by applying positive field current. Hence, in this paper, based on both 2D and 3D finite element analysis (FEA), two six-phase hybrid-excited flux-switching (HEFS) machines with E-core and C-core stator laminations are designed, respectively. The iron bridges are adopted in each machine and the influences on performance are investigated. In addition, alternative-tooth-wound armature windings are employed in the C-core one to obtain physical and magnetic isolations between armature phases. A comprehensive comparison of the two designs is carried out. Then, more attention is paid to fault tolerant operating capabilities when open-circuit fault occurs to only one phase and two phases of armature windings, respectively. The positive field current can be applied in C-core machine under fault-tolerant operating conditions, thus the post-fault armature current can be reduced whilst maintaining torque output. Overall, torque output can be effectively maintained in each HEFS machine during post-fault operations. Finally, the FEA-based studies are validated by experimental measurements on two HEFS machine prototypes.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a mathematical model of a 12-phase flux-switching permanent magnet (FSPM) machine designed for high-power wind power generation is established and investigated. First, the winding inductances in both the stator reference frame and the $dq$-axes reference frame are analyzed. It should be noted that the characteristics of the 12-phase winding inductances are different from those of its three-phase counterpart. The largest mutual inductance is much smaller than half of the self-inductance, and most mutual inductances are negligible, which brings the benefit of improved magnetic isolation between phases and causes the 12th-order inductance matrix to be sparse. Thereafter, an accurate inductance model is established, taking account of the magnetic coupling between adjacent three-phase winding sets. Finally, a flux-linkage equation, a voltage equation, a power equation, and a torque equation are derived in sequence. The effectiveness of the proposed mathematical model is verified by comparing the theoretical results with 2-D finite-element-analysis-based predictions. The work in this paper lays an important foundation for the control strategy of the 12-phase FSPM machine.",

To evaluate the effects of winding configurations, the electromagnetic performances of HT-SRMs and conventional full-teeth-wound SRMs (FT-SRMs), including air-gap flux density, coil and phase flux linkage, inductance, torque, volt-ampere, and radial magnetic force (RMF), are comprehensively compared. The results based on theoretical analysis and finite-element (FE) method reveal that HT-SRMs would exhibit higher torque per ampere when the magnetic saturations are not too severe, whereas require higher voltage supply and generate more significant RMF. Further, it is found that the fault-tolerant capabilities of HT-SRMs are superior to FT-SRMs. A pair of prototypes with identical laminations but different winding configurations are manufactured and the experimental results confirm the predictions.",

        "abstract": "Multiphase flux-switching permanent-magnet (FSPM) motor drives are nowadays considered for various applications due to numerous advantages when compared with their three-phase counterparts. In principle, stator-flux-oriented control of a nine-phase flux-switching permanent-magnet (FSPM) (9P-FSPM) motor can be realized theoretically by using four pairs of synchronous current controllers in conjunction with eight conventional proportional-integrals (PIs), for alleviation of the coupling effects and unwanted low-order stator current harmonics. In practice, however, drive performance will deteriorate if the PI-based current controller is not well tuned for optimum response to every dynamic scenario due to nonlinearity. In order to enhance dynamic performance of the drive system, a fully-decoupled model predictive control algorithm with fixed switching frequency is developed for the 9P-FSPM motor. The main contribution is comprehensive and detailed description of precise modeling of the 9P-FSPM motor and the controller design process. Also, some practical hints are given for implementation, such as the elimination of low-order harmonic currents and the selection of active voltage vector in the nine-phase drive system. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the developed current controller and the high dynamic performance of the 9P-FSPM motor drive.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel outer-rotor flux-switching permanent-magnet (OR-FSPM) machine with specific wedge-shaped magnets for in-wheel light-weight traction applications. First, the geometric topology is introduced. Then, the combination principle of stator slots and rotor poles for OR-FSPM machines is investigated. Furthermore, to demonstrate the relationship between performance specifications (e.g., torque and speed) and key design parameters and dimensions (e.g., rotor outer diameter and stack length) of OR-FSPM machines at preliminary design stage, an analytical torque-sizing equation is proposed and verified by two-dimensional (2-D) finite-element analysis (FEA). Moreover, optimizations of key dimensions are conducted on an initially designed proof-of-principle three-phase 12-stator-slot/22-rotor-pole prototyped machine. Then, based on 2-D-FEA, a comprehensive comparison between a pair of OR-FSPM machines with rectangular- and wedge-shaped magnets and a surface-mounted permanent-magnet (SPM) machine is performed. The results indicate that the proposed OR-FSPM machine with wedge-shaped magnets exhibits better flux-weakening capability, higher efficiency, and wider speed range than the counterparts, especially for torque capability, where the proposed wedge-shaped magnets-based one could produce 40% and 61.5% more torque than the rectangular-shaped magnets-based machine and SPM machine, respectively, with the same rated current density (5 A/mm2). Finally, the predicted performance of the proposed OR-FSPM machine is verified by experiments on a prototyped machine.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, in order to enlarge its torque density, an overlapping winding (OW) is applied to the 24/16-stator/rotor-pole flux-switching permanent magnet (FSPM) machine. By adopting an OW-configuration with full-pitch coils, the pitch factor and coil-flux cross-sectional area in the 24/16-pole FSPM machine with nonoverlapping winding (NOW) can be doubled. Thus, the fundamental open-circuit phase flux-linkage and back-EMF can be effectively enhanced by 115.28%, making it comparable to the conventional 12/10-pole NOW-FSPM machine. Therefore, by injecting the same current density, the proposed OW-FSPM machine can produce 65.2% higher torque density than its NOW counterpart, and 17.6% higher torque density than the conventional 12/10-pole NOW machine despite 21.5% lower ampere turns due to a smaller slot area. However, the proposed machine suffers from high torque ripple due to high cogging torque and back-EMF harmonics. Torque ripple reduction by harmonics current injection and rotor skewing in the proposed machine are investigated. Results show that both methods can effectively reduce the torque ripple in the proposed 24/16-pole NOW-FSPM machine, albeit with the level of torque density being compromised. Experiments are performed in order to validate the analysis.",

        "abstract": "Design rules of multiple multiphase winding configurations are investigated from the perspective of phase shift between adjacent winding sets in flux-switching permanent magnet (FSPM) machines. The relations between torque/rectified voltage and phase shift for any multiple multiphase winding topology are theoretically derived, directly showing the influence of phase shift on torque/rectified voltage harmonic components. It can be learned that the optimal phase shift for the lowest torque ripple and dc voltage oscillation depends on the winding types. Symmetrical winding is not always appropriate for any occasion. To verify the analytical results, the static characteristics of the dual three-phase, four three-phase, triplex three-phase, dual six-phase, and triplex four-phase FSPM machines with specific stator/rotor-pole combinations are studied by finite-element (FE) analysis. The FE-predicted dominant torque ripple and rectified voltage pulsation components for symmetrical and asymmetric phase shifts are in good agreement with the theoretical derivation. Prototypes are built and tested to verify the analytical and FE results.",

        "abstract": "In permanent magnet flux-switching (PMFS) motors, both magnets and concentrated armature windings are located on the stator, which facilities the accommodation of a water cooling system. It is found that the temperature varies greatly in the PMs, since they are located between the water cooling system and armature windings that carry the heat generated by copper loss. Thus, based on the finite-element analysis, an axially segmented magnetic-thermal coupled-fields model of PMFS motor is proposed, which counts in the variations of flux density, iron loss, and temperature distributions in the axial direction. By dividing the motor into axial segments and neglecting the temperature variation along the axial direction in each segment, this new model enables the electromagnetic and thermal behaviors to be predicted more accurately than 2-D coupled-fields model, meanwhile much faster than a traditional synchronous 3-D coupled-fields model when similar accuracy is obtained. Finally, the results predicted by the new axially segmented model are validated by experimental measurements, confirming the feasibility of the proposed model.",

        "abstract": "Due to the nature of doubly salient structure and high air-gap flux density, flux-switching permanent magnet (FSPM) machines typically suffer from large cogging torque, causing undesired acoustic noise and vibration, especially at low speeds. In this paper, various tooth chamfering methods for a 12/10 FSPM machine are proposed to reduce cogging torque. The influences of both circular bead and right angle as well as their possible combinations on cogging torque are investigated by 2D finite element analysis (FEA), and it turns out that employing right angles in both stator and rotor teeth is the most effective solution. Further, in order to explain this phenomena, the air-gap flux density is analyzed. Besides, the impacts on phase back electro-motive-force and electromagnetic torque are also evaluated. The predicted results indicate that the proposed technique can significantly reduce the peak value of cogging torque from 2.6Nm to 0.4Nm, while the reduction of average torque is only about 1.6%, which turns out to be an improvement when compared with the approach employed in previous literatures.",

Different from the conventional SPM-FS machines, the magnets are removed from stator to rotor, and magnetised in a unique direction, resulting in a significant alleviation of stator tooth saturation level for the RPM-FS machines. The concentrated armature windings are still wound around stator teeth with an even shorter end-part winding length due to the absence of magnets. To evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of RPM-FS machines, a comprehensive comparison between a RPM-FS machine, a SPM-FS machine, and an interior permanent magnet machine used in Toyota-Prius 2004 hybrid electric vehicle, is conducted and the electromagnetic performances of three machines are investigated by finite element analysis. The predicted results indicate the proposed RPM-FS machine exhibits the largest power density, greatest torque capability, highest efficiency under rated operation, and improved flux-weakening ability. Therefore, the RPM-FS machine is a promising candidate for EV and hybrid electric vehicles applications especially for direct driven systems where the superior overloaded performance is crucial.",

Besides, it has better overload capability than its 9-phase 36-stator-slot/34-rotor-pole counterpart when the load and wind speed exceed the rated level. The comparative study reveals the benefits of lower leakage flux and permeance from larger stator-slot opening and longer magnetic circuit.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the influence of stator slots and rotor pole pairs combinations on torque performances in rotor permanent magnet flux switching (RPM-FS) machines. Based on a magnetomotive force (MMF) permeance model, the candidates of stator slots and rotor pole pairs combinations with higher torque capability can be determined by analyzing the PM-MMF and winding factor. Meanwhile, the candidates with a lower torque ripple can be obtained by referring to the cogging torque, which is related to the greatest common divisor of stator slots and rotor pole pairs. In addition, from the field modulation principle, the RPM-FS machines with the same fundamental magnetic loadings and winding factors exhibit identical fundamental harmonic torque, but different modulation harmonic components. Finally, four candidates with attractive torque performance are chosen, and the characteristics are verified by finite-element analysis and experiments.",

Based on the field modulation principle, the harmonic components of both the PM field and armature reaction field are deduced, as well as the corresponding frequencies. Then, the PM loss production mechanisms due to eddy current are revealed for the RPM-FS and SPM-FS machines, respectively. Consequently, the similarities and differences between two FS machines are investigated from the perspectives of both electromagnetic torque and PM eddy current loss production mechanisms. The results indicate that the PM eddy current loss in SPM-FS machines influences efficiency dramatically. However, for the RPM-FS machine, the armature reaction field affects the PM loss more sensitively. In addition, a large PM eddy current loss is associated with high-power rating and large current density FS machines for electric vehicle application, and can be reduced by utilizing PM segmentation method.",

Different from removing the faulty inverter channels completely, this paper proposes and compares three fault-tolerant control strategies, which fully use all the healthy phase legs, including those in faulty inverters. The three schemes are called \u201cnormal channel direct compensation,\u201d \u201cnormal channel asymmetric currents,\u201d and \u201cequivalent current value compensation,\u201d respectively. The proposed control schemes not only provide smooth torque but also have smaller copper loss under open-circuit faults. The corresponding principles and design criteria of control are given. Moreover, the proportional-resonant current controller is designed to track the asymmetrical current references of fault-tolerant control and avoid the possible circulating currents among paralleled inverter channels. The experiments are given to verify and compare the performance of the proposed fault-tolerant control schemes.",

Based on the model of instant active power under unbalanced grid conditions, this paper proposes the optimized negative-sequence current references for eliminating the double-frequency oscillations on active power at ac side of CSGCC. Both the single CSGCC and the paralleled CSGCCs are considered in this paper. In order to track the asymmetric current references more accurately while maintaining  LC  resonance damping, the hybrid current controller is proposed by combining the closed-loop fundamental current controller under double synchronous frames and the closed-loop high-bandwidth harmonic current controller under stationary frame. The design of the hybrid current controller is analyzed. Finally, the experimental results are shown to verify that the control strategies can mitigate the dc-link current ripple effectively, and also provide good  LC  resonance damping performance for grid currents.",

First, a simplified space vector modulation (SVM) is designed and applied for DTC-controlled asymmetric six-phase drive, in such a way that both good current harmonic performance and fast dynamic response are available. Based on the SVM-DTC scheme, a remedial strategy is proposed for the open-circuit faults in phase windings. The key is to derive the relationship between the stator fluxes and the stator voltages of all phases under faulty condition. Then, a derived perturbation term is compensated for normal voltage references, and the fault-tolerant scheme is, thus, implemented without changing control structure of normal condition. The remedial DTC schemes are also studied and proposed for open-switch faults in T-NPC six-phase drives. The modulation methods are redesigned for the faults in half-bridge switches and NPC switches. The experiments are carried out on a laboratory prototype to verify the validity and performance of the proposed fault-tolerant control schemes.",

A simplified space vector modulation (SVM) is designed and applied for the DTC controlled asymmetric six-phase drive, in such a way that both good current harmonic performance and small DC link voltage fluctuation are available. The relationship between the stator fluxes and the stator voltages including the faulty phase is derived after the fault.

However, the LC resonance caused by input filter is one reason keeps it from being utilized in industry. Different from pervious solutions of LC resonance damping for single IMC, this paper proposes an active damping strategy for the paralleled IMC with both interleaved operation and cascaded control of input LC filter. The key is to apply the closed-loop control of grid currents to generate the references for capacitor voltages, which are tracked by the inner capacitor voltage loop. By designing the control parameters properly, this method can not only suppress the LC resonance effectively but also offer accurate control of grid currents. In order to further mitigate resonance, the interleaved operation is applied to reduce specific order harmonic around resonant frequency of LC filter. No additional cost will be required for the proposed interleaved and cascaded control strategy. Furthermore, the feed-forward terms of voltage drop on filter inductor and capacitor currents are added to the control, in such a way that the decoupling effects between the d-axis and q-axis are removed and the dynamic response becomes better. Both simulation and experiments are given to verify the correctness and feasibility of the proposed strategy.",

Furthermore, a hybrid current control is proposed for fault-tolerant operation of the T-NPC double-stator-winding PMSM drives under one-phase open-circuit conditions. In the hybrid current controller, the healthy winding still uses the SVM-DTC control while the faulty winding uses the closed-loop current controller to track the optimized current references.

This proposed DC/AC converter is composed of an interleaved current-fed dc/pulsating-dc converter cascaded with a three-phase pulsating-dc/ac inverter through pulsating-dc-link modulation. The pulse width modulation of frontend converter is encoded with the sinusoidal information of three-phase line voltage, and it will reduce the switching frequency of pulsating-dc/ac inverter. The power density and lifetime of the proposed converter can be increased significantly by eliminating the intermediate electrolytic capacitor, which benefits from pulsating-dc link instead of fixed-dc link. Meanwhile, secondary clamping technique applied in the front-end dc/pulsating-dc converter can realize zero-current-switching (ZCS) for the primary side and zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) for the secondary side, and is able to avoid voltage spikes caused by the transformer leakage inductance as well. Moreover, the current-fed topology and interleaved structure can lower the input current ripple. The aforesaid merits make the converter suitable for PV systems.

Based on direct torque control (DTC) with space vector modulation, a series of diagnostic and tolerant control methods have been proposed for five types of faults, namely, speed-sensor fault, dc-link voltage-sensor fault, current-sensor fault, open-phase fault, and open-switch fault. First, diagnosis and tolerant schemes are proposed for speed-sensor fault by estimating the rotor angle speed with the rotating speed of stator flux. Second, diagnosis and tolerant schemes are proposed for dc-link voltage-sensor fault by combining the current model based stator flux observer with the voltage model based stator flux observer. Third, a three-step method is designed to diagnose three types of faults related to current signals, namely, current-sensor fault, open-phase fault, and open-switch fault simultaneously. A vector space decomposition based current estimation method is proposed to achieve fault-tolerant control for the current-sensor fault, and the voltage compensation based fault-tolerant control is presented for both open-phase and open-switch faults. The experiments have been taken on a laboratory prototype to verify the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant schemes.",

These merits make the bidirectional converter suitable for electric vehicles charging and driving mode. Operation equivalent circuits, analysis, simulation results are presented in this paper. A 3.3KW on-board EV charger prototype is built to demonstrate the validity of the proposed topology.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the optimized space vector modulation (SVM) strategy has been designed to reduce the DC-link current ripple in the cascaded current source converters (CSCs). The configuration of series CSCs is presented and a coordinated control scheme is applied for DC-link current regulation and achieving stable operation of the system. The key of DC-link current ripple mitigation is to design the pulse patterns of series current-source-rectifiers (CSRs) and series current-source-inverters (CSIs) collaboratively. Conventionally, the DC-link inductor is increased to reduce the current ripple. However, it will lead to bulky size, high cost, and slow dynamic response. Instead of that, this paper reveals that the DC-link current ripple can be significantly reduced by adjusting the pulse patterns of SVM between the cascaded CSRs and the CSIs. The simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

In doing so, a parallel soft-switching configuration with DC bus polarities feature and independent zero-vector freewheeling branch has been proposed first. Based on this new soft-switching configuration, the soft-switching goal of TLIs from zero-current switching means has been realized by building and combining basic resonance cells.

        "abstract": "Indirect Matrix Converter (IMC) possesses the advantages of high power density, good performance of input and output waveforms, bidirectional power flow, etc. Besides these superiorities, more degrees of freedom are offered by multiple-channel IMC compared with single-channel IMC. The application of IMC fed three-phase permanent magnetic synchronous motor (PMSM) has been widely studied, which takes great advantages of the converteru0027s small volume and high reliability. However, few researches have been focused on the multiple-channel IMC fed multiphase PMSM. Furthermore, the maximum voltage transfer ratio (VTR) of traditional modulation strategy for IMC is 0.866 when space vector modulation is applied within linear modulation region, which limits the application of IMC especially for condition of low input voltage. The purpose of this paper is to propose the over-modulation strategy for increasing the voltage transfer ratio of multiple-channel IMC. The key point is to change the weighting factor of the hexagon vectors and basic vectors to synthesize the reference current and voltage. On the other hand, the existence of the LC filter at the grid side results in LC resonance which will do harm to power grid. To suppress the LC resonance on grid side, the active damping control method has been proposed on grid side with over-modulation on machine side. For introduction of active damping, the power balance of the drive system is elaborated, which means the input power, the virtual bus power and the output power should be consistent with each other. Both simulation and experiment are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed strategy.",

A three-step method is designed to diagnose the three types of faults simultaneously. A vector space decomposition (VSD) based current estimation method is proposed to achieve fault-tolerant control of current-sensor fault. And both open-phase fault and open-switch fault are tolerated by using a voltage compensation based fault-tolerant control.

        "abstract": "In this paper, an integrated electrolytic capacitorless onboard charger is proposed for electric vehicles, which consists of a phase-shift full-bridge (PSFB) DC/DC converter cascaded by a three-phase four-leg (TPFL) DC/AC converter that realizes both vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and traction operation. An active snubber is connected to the DC link to suppress the voltage spike induced by current mismatch between the two converters and reduce power loss in comparison with passive snubber. By phase shifting the primary H-bridge of PSFB, the DC link voltage is high-frequency pulsating owing to the absence of electrolytic capacitance, which provides ZVS condition for secondary H-bridge and TPFL. To utilize the zero portion of DC link voltage, finite-set model-predictive-control (FS-MPC) and switch-table direct-torque-control (ST-DTC) are adopted to regulate TPFL in V2G operation mode and traction operation mode, respectively. For comparison, a conventional topology with DC link electrolytic capacitor is also studied. Simulation and experiment are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed integrated onboard charger and compare the conversion efficiency with conventional onboard charger.",

This open-loop current controller is originated from an ideal differentiator and consists of a proportional, a proportional and a delay (PPD) blocks. Furthermore, the parameters design method of proposed PPD controller is discussed, and the static and dynamic performance of this controller is analyzed under different operation conditions.

After that, a commercial 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET has been simulated under different working conditions with driving signals from 16 to 20V, DC bus voltages from 300 to 800 V, and different initial case temperatures. In doing so, overall SC parameters of SiC-MOSFETs are obtained. Finally, a design summary of advanced gate drivers based on SCPC and SCWT are presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new design of interior permanent magnet (IPM) motor, which has a V-shaped rotor with a combination of the assisted arched permanent magnets and asymmetrical flux-barriers for improving the torque characteristics. This approach can guide the PM flux distribution in order to concentrate the flux lines and improve the waveforms in the air gap effectively. The proposed IPM motors are analyzed by using finite element analysis (FEA), and the beneficial attributes of the proposed new design compared with the simulation results are emphasized.",

First, the 3 D finite element method (FEM) model is developed to calculate the PM eddy current loss, in which magnet axial segmentation is taken into account. In order to calculate the iron loss quickly and precisely, the magnetic flux leakage coefficient is proposed in this paper to modify the 2 D calculation model of iron loss. Both the dc-biased magnetic induction and the rotational magnetization are taken into account. Then, the key parameters for thermal modeling, such as the convective heat-transfer coefficient between external frame and ambient, and the coefficient of convection heat transfer in the end region, are derived, based on which a dissymmetric 3 D FEM are used for thermal calculation of nine-phase FSPM machine. Finally, experiments on a prototype machine at the rated generation operation condition are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the developed model.",

        "abstract": "Linear induction motors (LIMs) have been extensively adopted in urban railway transportation given their nonadhesion thrust and simple stator structure. However, these LIMs undergo unfavorable power factor and efficiency considering their copper and eddy losses. Recently, linear flux-switching permanent-magnet motors (LFSPMs) have attracted the attention of researchers due to their high power density, simple structure, easy heat dissipation, high efficiency, and high power factor. However, so far, no quantitative comparison exists between LFSPMs and LIMs of the size 1:1 to prove the feasibility of LFSPMs to be used in railway transit systems. Therefore, a comparative analysis between the two motors is conducted in this paper. First, this paper investigates the LIMs for railway transit using the finite element method (FEM). Second, the LFSPMs for railway transit is designed and optimized. Third, the electromagnetic performance of the two motors is compared and analyzed through the FEM. Finally, a small-sized prototype of the LFSPMs is constructed to validate the FEM results. It is concluded that LFSPMs offer a favorable thrust force, have high efficiency, and high power factor but have large normal force and force ripple. Therefore, applying LFSPM requires a reliable supporting device and a shock absorber.",

The key to the proposed methods is to explore various magnet shape designs via sufficient attempts of harmonic combinations. Such techniques serve to avoid a significant drop in the average torque when reducing the torque ripple. The effect of analytical harmonic compensation on output torques is investigated by the finite-element method, and diverse torques are evaluated by a predefined objective function, which as an evaluation criterion of the torque performance is established. Comparisons of the proposed and the existing methods are carried out, showing the higher average torque and the lower torque ripple of the proposed method. Finally, a prototype machine designed with one of the proposed methods is fabricated and tested for validation.",

The topology of SRMs is quite simple and only one set of windings is employed. Consequently, the winding configuration has an essential impact on performance. In this paper, a new winding configuration for SRMs with only half-teeth wound (HT-SRM) is proposed, which is totally different from the conventional SRMs with full-teeth wound (FT-SRM). First, the basic topology and operating principle of HT-SRMs are presented by a three-phase 12/8 prototype. Then, based on the 2-D finite element analysis, an optimization of the original 12/8 HT-SRM is conducted and a series of static characteristics of three SRMs, namely, a conventional 12/8 FT-SRM, an original 12/8 HT-SRM with the same iron laminations, and an optimal HT-SRM with the optimized dimensions, are compared. Finally, three 12/8 SRM prototypes are fabricated and the experimental results verify the theoretical analysis and the corresponding finite element analysis-based predictions.",

However, the accurate and efficient analyses of SRMs are always challenging since they operate with variable reluctance and pulsating excitation, suffering severe nonlinear characteristics. This paper first introduces a general power equation of SRMs, which can be a powerful tool in the investigation of SRMs. Then, the proposed power equation is validated by finite element (FE) results and experimental results with different excitations. Afterwards, the calculated results with various conditions including different stator inner diameters and different stator outer diameters are compared with the FE-predicted results. Finally, the comparison between SRMs and several conventional machines is carried out to evaluate the power density of SRMs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, firstly, a basic nonlinear magnetic network model considering iron saturations is proposed for a three-phase 12-stator-slot/10-rotor-pole flux-switching permanent magnet (FSPM) machine. This model is built under cylindrical coordinates and enables the open-circuit air-gap flux-density distributions, phase permanent magnet (PM) flux-linkage, and electromotive- force (EMF) to be predicted with acceptable accuracy. However, large discrepancies are found in the predictions of armature inductances. Then, the basic model is modified by taking into account the localized saturation effect. As a result, the electromagnetic performance can be predicted more accurately, especially for the air-gap flux-density distributions. Furthermore, two improved models are proposed by adding bypass-bridge branches in stator network, to enhance the calculating accuracy of both saturated and unsaturated armature inductances. Finally, the predicted results from the four magnetic network models are validated by both 2D finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental measurements on a machine prototype. Overall, comparisons indicate that the model with bypass-bridge branches between stator teeth and back irons exhibits best performances.",

        "abstract": "For electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles applications, the stator permanent-magnet flux-switching (SPM-FS) machines have attracted considerable attentions due to the benefits of high power density and improved reliability[1]. However, due to the existence of magnets on the stator, the slot areas for the armature windings are significantly reduced, leading to an increased copper loss and suffering from serious iron saturations with large currents. Hence, to further enhance the torque overload capability, a simple concept of rotor-PM flux-switching (RPM-FS) machine is proposed by removing the magnets from stator to rotor meanwhile keeping the flux-switching principle[2]. In this paper, the influence of the rotor pole number on electromagnetic performance of a RPM-FS machine with 24 stator slots is investigated based on 2D finite element analysis(FEA).",

The development of this method begins with the establishment of the mathematic model of the PMSM with the HRC. Based on the model, a ZSCC-based method is proposed to diagnose the HRC. The fault indicator and angle differences are defined for fault diagnosis. To implement online diagnosis, an effective frequency tracking algorithm is applied. Finally, the fault diagnosis steps are presented. This method is capable of detecting the fault, evaluating the fault severity, and identifying the faulty phases. The simulation and experiment are carried out to verify the proposed method. Both the results show the validity of the proposed method, leading to the effective diagnosis of the HRC in the delta-connected PMSM.",

Firstly, the new topology and static electromagnetic performance of the five-phase FSPM machine are presented and analyzed from the view of control strategy. Then, the characteristics of the basic space vectors that are produced by a five-phase voltage source inverter (VSI) are studied in depth, and the results indicate that they can be classified into three categories by amplitudes. Afterwards, a space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) method using the large and medium space vectors with a closed-loop of both the fundamental and 3rd harmonic stator currents is proposed and implemented. Also, the other two SVPWM techniques are analyzed, and consequently, three models using three different SVPWM techniques are built and compared. In addition, the reason why not all the space vectors are employed is discussed. Finally, the simulation results are presented, verifying the advantages of the proposed strategy.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a fault diagnosis technique for high-resistance connection (HRC) in a nine-phase flux-switching permanent-magnet (FSPM) machine based on zero-sequence voltage components (ZSVC), where the neutral-point connection mode is considered. A nine-phase FSPM machine topology is first introduced and no-load back electromotive force waveforms are analyzed. Moreover, the topologies of the nine-phase FSPM drive with different neutral-point connection modes are studied. Then, the mathematical model of a nine-phase FSPM machine with HRC is established with the consideration of the neutral-point connection mode and then the influence of the HRC on the ZSVC is analyzed based on the established model. It is shown that the HRC may be diagnosed by monitoring the change of the spectral contents of the ZSVC. Furthermore, this paper focuses on the situation of the nine-phase FSPM machine with one neutral point. In this case, to remove the influence of the FSPM machine operating point, an effective fault indicator is defined and used for HRC fault detection. Finally, the simulation and the experiment are carried out to validate the proposed method. Both the results show that the proposed method can be applied for the HRC fault diagnosis in a nine-phase FSPM machine.",

        "abstract": "Open-phase fault in permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive system occurs as the phase winding is disconnected or one leg of the inverter bridge fails. It may generate large electromagnetic torque ripple and serious mechanical vibration. Therefore, a rapid fault detection method is greatly required to identify this fault at early stage and prevent damage to the system. This paper develops a method of the open-phase fault detection and discrimination for the PMSM drive system based on the zero-sequence voltage components, in which the discrimination of the fault types, namely internal stator winding failure and switches failure of the inverter is realized. Then, appropriate fault-tolerant measures may be taken according to the different fault types. The experimental platform is established, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing that not only the open-phase fault can be rapidly detected, but also the fault type can be effectively discriminated.",

Design/methodology/approach Primary wound field flux-switching linear (PWFFSL) motors have the merits of no rare-earth magnet, low cost and a wide operation range, in which the armature windings and the field windings are all located at the short primary mover while the secondary is very robust. Hence, the PWFFSL motor is ideal for rail transportation systems which need a long stator and a wide speed range. In order to overcome the disadvantages of the existing PWFFSL motors, the new complementary design rules will be proposed. Also, to offer a better PWFFSL motor for the rail transportation systems, it is necessary to investigate different structures of the PWFFSL motors and give a comprehensive comparison. In order to predict the force performance of the two kinds of PWFFSL motors ...",

However, the fault feature is not obvious and is easily hidden in the main component, since the amplitudes of fault harmonic components are quiet small compared with the fundamental component. A new method to diagnose the mechanical unbalance fault effectively in permanent magnet synchronous machine drives is proposed in this article, where Parku0027s vector is used to eliminate the fundamental component from the fast Fourier transform (FFT) results of motor current signature analysis; the fault feature is then analyzed by discrete wavelet transform. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by simulation and experimental results. It is shown that the proposed diagnosis method may work well under different control strategies.",

In this method, empirical mode decomposition is adopted to extract fault feature vectors from vibration signals. FSVM is used for solving classification problem with outliers or noises, where kernel fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm are applied to calculate fuzzy membership and optimize the parameters of kernel function of FSVM, respectively. In addition, to study the performance of the proposed approach, another two widely used methods, named back propagation neural network and standard support vector machine, are studied and compared. Discrete wavelet transform is also used to extract fault feature vectors. To validate the proposed approach, a direct-drive WT test rig is constructed and the experiments are carried out. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is an effective fault diagnosis method for WT, which has a better performance and can achieve higher diagnostic accuracy. A multi-class FSVM classifier constructed by one-against-other method is used for fault diagnosis of wind turbine.KFCM algorithm is extended to calculate fuzzy membership values of training samples for a multi-class FSVM classifier.PSO algorithm is applied to optimize the parameters of the kernel function of FSVM.Fault diagnosis steps are presented, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated.",

        "abstract": "The brushless doubly-fed machine has attractive features to be employed in highly reliable wind turbine systems. However, the existing brushless doubly-fed topologies primarily work by the principle of modulation and suffer from low torque/power density, inferior efficiency, and high level of time and spatial harmonic distortion. This paper presents a simple design optimization approach for torque/power density optimization of a dual-stator brushless doubly-fed induction generator, which, unlike the modulation types, is inherently free of harmonic-related issues. An analytical average torque model with a full set of geometrical, electromagnetic, and thermal constraints is developed based on the power flow of generating operation. The optimized results exhibit comparable torque per volume and torque per weight to standard industrial induction machines with the similar size, synchronous speed, and power loss per-unit area. Mechanical considerations, manufacturing costs, and control aspects are also discussed to show the high potential in superseding existing doubly-fed induction generators. Finite-element analysis and experimental results of a 3.7-kW prototype are used to validate the effectiveness of the optimization.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the feasibility of an intuitive solution for torque density improvement of conventional brushless doubly-fed induction machine by introducing dual-stator structure. A general purpose torque density equation for dual-stator topologies is developed to initialize the key dimensions and, more importantly, evaluate the torque capability of specific designs. The topological requirements for enhancing torque capability are derived. The relationship between torque capability and key design parameters, such as pole pair combination, split ratio, and turn ratio between outer and inner rotor windings, is revealed. A design example with detailed design procedure is presented to provide the designer a practical way to make initial calculation of machine dimensions and parameters. Moreover, finite element analysis is carried out to deduce the characteristics of the machine. Experimental results of a 7.5-kW prototype machine are given to verify the design and analysis.",

Winding function theory is first employed to give a full picture of the inductance characteristics analytically, revealing the underlying relationship between harmonic components of stator-rotor mutual inductances and the airgap magnetic field distribution. Different from existing vector models, which only model the fundamental components of mutual inductances, the proposed vector model takes into consideration the low-order space harmonic coupling by incorporating nonsinusoidal inductances into modeling process. A new model order reduction approach is then proposed to transform the nested-loop rotor into an equivalent single-loop one. The effectiveness of the proposed modelling method is verified by 2D finite element analysis (2D-FEA).",

The drive system is configured as a master/slave architecture, that is, the power winding is supplied with a constant-voltage constant-frequency inverter, termed as the master inverter, in an open-loop way, while the control winding is fed by a closed-loop field-oriented-controlled (FOC) variable-voltage variable-frequency inverter, termed as slave inverter. With this configuration, the control emphasis is placed on the slave inverter, yielding reduced control complexity and cost, and the inaccuracy of flux estimation in conventional FOC for singly-fed induction machines is avoided at very low or even zero speed. It is found that the doubly-fed synchronous operation of the CDFIM can achieve wider constant torque region and constant power region than the singly-fed synchronous operation.

        "abstract": "Brushless doubly fed induction machine (BDFIM) with apparent cost advantage and high potential in reliability is regarded as a viable alternative to the commonly applied doubly fed induction machine in modern energy conversion systems. Design and analysis of the current controller, which are key points for effective control of BDFIM, are for the first time intensively studied in this paper. The complete model of control winding current loop is developed in form of complex transfer function, and its differences from the conventional simplified model are clearly revealed. An improved feedforward current control method is proposed based on the complete model, offering simple and compact control structure with only few parameters involved. Stability and transient performance analysis is carried out on both conventional and improved current controllers, which theoretically proves stability improvement and faster dynamic performance of the improved current controller. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed current controller, as well as the consistence between theoretical analysis and actual performance, are validated by experimental results performed on a prototype BDFIM system.",

The proposed control method enables the synchronous control of both power winding (PW) and control winding (CW) currents, and as a consequence, not only the control complexity but also the rotor slip frequency and related core losses are significantly reduced in comparison with the previously proposed single-electrical-port control scheme. It is for the first time revealed that the CDFIM drive that indirectly couples PW and CW through induction behavior can be readily controlled like a conventional induction motor to achieve the highest torque density. The torque density\u2013speed region of the CDFIM falls within that of the power machine in singly-fed operation mode, and only a half of that of the power machine in doubly-fed operation mode, which shows the urgent need for torque density enhancement of brushless doubly-fed machines for electric vehicle/hybrid electric vehicle applications. Computer simulations and experiments are implemented to verify the dynamic performance of the proposed control method.",

        "abstract": "Due to inherent high reliability and low maintenance cost, the brushless doubly fed induction generator (BDFIG) has become a promising candidate in offshore wind energy generation systems and dc/ac/hybrid microgrids. This paper proposes a novel BDFIG based system targeting at dc power generation (BDFIG-DC), which features interfacing the power winding (PW) and the dc grid through an uncontrolled rectifier and common dc link. Compared to conventional BDFIG systems fed by ac grid, the BDFIG-DC system offers an alternative to integrate the BDFIG into the dc transmission system with a simpler structure and lower cost. Due to the constraint imposed by the dc-side diode bridge, torque ripple reduction emerges as an urgent issue as a result of the distorted flux and current. To achieve the smooth dc-connected operation of the BDFIG, an improved vector control strategy is proposed in this paper, where the control of the system is divided into three parts: torque ripple reduction, frequency regulation, and average torque control. Based on the investigations into the electromagnetic torque reduction and small-signal model of the PW flux linkage, average torque and PW frequency are successfully controlled with torque ripple effectively suppressed. The effectiveness of the proposed system, along with the associated control strategy, is validated by the experimental results of a 10-kW 2/1 dual-stator BDFIG (DS-BDFIG) prototype.",

An extended spiral vector model taking into account core losses and iron saturation is first developed for analytical analysis and performance prediction. The cross-coupling capability, power factor of control winding, torque capability, and available operation regions under doubly fed synchronous operation are then considered and correlated with the electric equivalent circuit parameters.

The FS-MPPC controller is developed in a general reference frame from which all other reference frames can be deduced readily. The invariant feature of the predictive power model in various reference frames contributes to the reference frame-free characteristic of the developed FS-MPPC controller, enabling its application more flexible and universal. Besides, the arduous process of control winding flux estimation is avoided in the FS-MPPC controller by choosing state variables that are easy to be obtained. Moreover, the influence of rotor circuit that has long been neglected in the existing controllers for the brushless doubly fed induction machines is embedded within the predictive power model and inherently considered in the FS-MPPC controller, which contributes to accurate power control of the BDFTSIG. Furthermore, the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed FS-MPPC controller regarding different power levels and grid fault conditions are briefly discussed. Finally, numerical simulations and experimental tests are carried out, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the developed FS-MPPC controller.",

Besides, the active vector selection and its duration are simultaneously considered in evaluating the cost function to ensure global minimization. The superiority of the proposed MPPC in power ripple reduction has been validated by a series of comparative simulations.",

Firstly, the state-space equations of BDFTSIM, in terms of (power winding) PW flux, (rotor winding) RW flux, and (control winding) CW flux, is derived for developing the complete power model which is explicitly used to predict the future behavior. However, the MPC based on the complete model is too complicated for real time application. Therefore, a relevant model reduction approach is then developed for simplifying the power model while maintaining the accuracy under various conditions. Finally, by comparing the simulation results of the MPC based on the reduced model and complete model respectively, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified.",

By incorporating predictive mechanisms into distributed generations, the secondary voltage control is converted to a tracker consensus problem of distributed model predictive control, with the synchronous convergence procedure for voltage magnitudes to the reference value drastically accelerated at a low communication cost. A sufficient local stability condition with the parameter analysis is established. Thus, a distributed proportional integral method combined with a finite-time observer to estimate the global reference information is presented in the frequency restoration while maintaining accurate active power sharing. Our approach accommodates model uncertainty, plug-and-play capability, and especially robustness against information update intervals, which is essential when the conventional method probably yields toward a poor performance. Meanwhile, the distributed architecture implemented on the local and neighboring information allows for a sparse communication network and eliminates the requirement for a centralized controller. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control methodology.",

Since the complexity of such constraint and switching laws, it is difficult to solve the problem using standard optimization techniques. In addition, although conjugate gradient algorithms are very useful for solving nonlinear optimization problem, in practical implementations, the existing Wolfe condition may never be satisfied due to the existence of numerical errors. And the mode insertion technique only leads to suboptimal solutions, due to only certain mode insertions being considered. Thus, based on an improved conjugate gradient algorithm and a discrete filled function method, an improved bi-level algorithm is proposed to solve this optimization problem. Convergence results indicate that the proposed algorithm is globally convergent. Three numerical examples are solved to illustrate the proposed algorithm converges faster and yields a better cost function value than existing bi-level algorithms.",

It is difficult to numerically integrate the switched system with the initial condition due to the switching times being unknown. In addition, since an input and state constraint is equivalent to an uncountable number of conventional constraints, it is challenging to solve this problem by using conventional optimization approaches. To address the challenge and avoid the shortcoming of existing methods, a numerically tractable method is provided to solve the optimal control problem of constrained switched systems. Firstly, based on introducing binary functions for each subsystem, relaxing the binary functions and including a penalty term on the relaxation, we obtain an equivalent optimal control problem. Then, by using the time-scaling transformation, the smoothing technique, and the idea of      l    1      penalty function method, the equivalent optimal control problem is transformed into a nonlinear parameter optimization problem, which can be solved by using any gradient-based optimization method. The convergent properties of the nonlinear parameter optimization to the original optimal control problem are discussed. Finally, an optimal energy management problem for an electrical vehicle is used to illustrate our method is less time-consuming with faster convergence speed, and achieves a better objective function value than the existing algorithms.",

According to the analysis of the renewable hybrid power system dynamic behavior, the problem is modelled as an optimal control problem of switched dynamic systems. As is known to all, the frequent switching may cause that the engine wear is increased, and the service life is reduced. Then, some switching constraints are imposed to the switched dynamic system model. However, these switching constraints lead to a non-connected feasible region for the optimal control problem with unknown switching instants, integer variables, and continuous variables. Thus, it is difficult to solve such problem by using conventional optimization methods, such as sequential quadratic programming. To overcome this difficulty, by using the time-scaling transformation technology and introducing an auxiliary continuous vector derive a more tractable equivalent problem, in which the variable switching instants and the switching sequence are replaced with conventional continuous parameter variables. Then, based on an exact penalty function, an alternative computational method is developed for solving the problem. Finally, three numerical examples are solved by using the proposed algorithm. The numerical results show that although the optimal costs with switching constraints slightly higher than the optimal costs without switching constraints, the proposed algorithm can effectively avoid the additional switches. In addition, the numerical results also show that the switched dynamical system approach is low time-consuming and obtains a better cost function value than the existing approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In the paper, the optimal control problem of chemical process systems is considered. In general, it is very difficult to solve this problem analytically due to its nonlinear nature and the existence of control input constraints. To obtain the numerical solution, based on the time-scaling transformation technology and the control parameterization method, the problem is transformed into a parameter optimization problem with some variable bounds, which can be efficiently solved using the improved conjugate gradient algorithm developed by us. However, in spite of the improved conjugate gradient algorithm is very efficient for local search, the solution obtained is usually a local extremum for non-convex optimal control problems. In order to escape from the local extremum, a novel stochastic search method is developed. A large number of numerical experiments show that the novel stochastic search method is excellent in exploration, while bad in exploitation. In order to improve the exploitation, we propose a hybrid stochastic optimization approach to solve the problem based on the novel stochastic search method and the improved conjugate gradient algorithm. Convergence results indicate that any global optimal solution of the approximate problem is also a global optimal solution of the original problem. Finally, four chemical process system optimal control problems illustrate that the hybrid numerical optimization algorithm proposed by us is low CPU time and obtains a better cost function value than the existing approaches.",

        "abstract": "The superconducting (SC) generators are expected to have a promising application for offshore wind generation due to the merits of high power density and high efficiency over the conventional generators. In this paper, a 10-MW conceptual high temperature superconducting (HTS) exciting double stator direct-drive wind generator (HTS-DSDDG) with the stationary seal is proposed and investigated. The proposed HTS-DSDDG has two spatially independent stators: to place HTS field windings and copper armature windings, respectively. Thus, it realizes the stationary seal of the cooling system and removes brushes and slip rings and the other additional excitation device; hence offering the advantages of the high reliability and the low operation u0026 maintenance cost. The main design considerations and the initial design specifications of the 10 MW HTS-DSDDG are given in detail. Furthermore, the electromagnetic characteristics of the HTS- DSDDG under no-load, rated load, and three-phase short-circuit fault conditions are analyzed by the finite element method (FEM). Subsequently, its size, weight, and cost are compared with the existing conceptual 10 MW wind generators. The results reveal that the HTS-DSDDG has excellent electromagnetic performances, such as good sinusoidal voltage, low cogging torque, and torque ripple; besides, its output power per volume is twice than that of the permanent magnet direct-drive generator (PMDDG), being comparable to that of the existing conceptual MgB 2 -HTS direct-drive generators.",

In this problem, the modes switch under state-dependent. This is different from the existing optimal control problem of switched systems, in which the modes switch under time-dependent. Thus, the existing optimal control approaches of switched systems with time-dependent switching can not directly used to solve this Problem, and a new numerical computation method is required to develop for solving such problem. Firstly, based on introducing a binary function, relaxing the binary functions and including a penalty term on the relaxation, we obtain an equivalent optimal control problem of constrained nonlinear system. By using the time-scaling transformation, the smoothing technique, and the idea of  l  1  penalty function method, the equivalent optimal control problem is transformed into a nonlinear parameter optimization problem. Then, a gradient-based continuous filled function algorithm is developed for solving the nonlinear parameter optimization problem. Finally, a numerical example is used to illustrate our method is low time-consuming, has faster convergence speed, and yields a better objective function value than the existing algorithms.",

Instrumental in achieving this outcome is the operation of the improved PLL that separates the fundamental component of the positive sequence of the microgrid voltages from the other sequences and harmonics. The scheme is also able to stabilize the CL voltages under imbalance of CLs and NCLs.

By the proposed control, the unpredictable power generated from RESs is divided into two parts, i.e., the one absorbed by the ES-2 that still varies and the other injected into the grid that is controllable by a simple and accurate signal manipulation that works both at steady-state and during RES transients. It is believed that such a control is suitable for the distributed power generation, especially at domestic homes. In this paper, the proposed control is supported by a theoretical background. Its effectiveness is at first validated by simulations and then by experiments. To this purpose, a typical RES application is considered, and an experimental setup is arranged, built up around an ES-2 implementing the proposed control. Testing of the setup is carried out in three steps and proves not only the smooth operation of the ES-2 itself, but also its capability in running the application properly.",

To control the novel topology, the so-called modified \u03b4 control utilized for the single-phase electric springs is extended to the three-phase case. Thanks to these solutions, TPES exhibits a behavior entirely different from the existing ones. For instance, under a fluctuation of the line voltages, it exhibits a change of the voltages across NCL that has the same trend as the line voltages. Moreover, it regulates the voltages across the three-phase critical load even under both imbalanced and distorted grid conditions.

An additional transformer with two ports is introduced in the reference scheme, where one port takes the place of the noncritical load (NCL) and the other one is connected in series to NCL. With the help of the recently introduced \u03b4 control, the balanced points of ES are modified compared to the ones of the existing topology. With the novel topology and the adapted control, the voltage across NCL can be increased with the line voltage and vice versa. Single-phase phase-locked loop (PLL) and dynamic modeling are illustrated using vector diagrams and mathematical derivations. Effectiveness of the proposed ES topology and its control is validated by simulation results.",

        "abstract": "The concept of DC electric spring (DCES) was recently proposed to solve the stability issue caused by integrating intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs) to DC microgrids. In this paper, a new topology of DCES is proposed based on DC/DC converters. The proposed DCES consists of a bi-directional paralleled buck-boost converters (BBCs), a bi-directional phase-shift full-bridge converter (PSFBC) and an H-bridge circuit. Three basic operating modes of the proposed DCES can be achieved, and namely voltage boosting mode, voltage balancing mode and voltage suppression mode. Strategy of constant charging and/or constant discharging for batteries is adopted and four operating modes are analyzed as charging-positive, charging-negative, discharging-positive and discharging-negative modes. An additional mechanism for fast charging or fast discharging is also designed to secure normal operation of batteries. With the proposed DCES, the power fluctuations due to intermittent RESs can be passed to non-critical loads (NCLs) and batteries while power on critical loads (CLs) is kept stable. This is possibly the first attempt to design a DCES with only DC/DC converters. The performances of the proposed DCES are simulated, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed DCES and its control.",

The dynamic modeling is analyzed first, and the initial Bode diagram is derived from the s-domain transfer function in the open loop. The design objective is set according to the characteristics of a minimum phase system. Step-by-step optimizations of the Bode diagram are provided to illustrate the proposed controller, the design of which is different from the classical multistage leading/lagging design. The final controller is the accumulation of the transfer function at each step. With the controller and the recently proposed \u03b4 control, the critical load voltage can be regulated to follow the desired waveform precisely while the fluctuations and distortions of the input voltage are passed to the non-critical loads. Frequency responses at any point can be modified in the Bode diagram. The results of the modeling and controller design are validated via simulations. Hardware and software designs are provided. A digital phase locked loop is realized with the platform of a digital signal processor. The effectiveness of the proposed control is also validated by experimental results.",

        "abstract": "The new concept of integrating electric springs (ESs) and multi-port transformers (MTPs) as an active solution for energy management in alternating current (AC) microgrids is proposed. With an ES located at the port where storage devices previously were, the so-called critical flux is regulated to a constant value within the core of the transformer. The voltage on each winding is then clamped so that critical load (CL) voltage is regulated to a predefined value. The integration of ESs and MPTs can ensure a safer environment for ES utilization. Thus, the power generated by renewable energy sources can be safely used at residential locations with no need to worry about voltage fluctuations across CLs. Moreover, users can sell electricity to the power companies considered as CLs when the electricity generation of the AC microgrids or the home-installed renewable energy resources exceeds the personal consumption. In the paper, isolated topologies for ESs with three- and four-port transformers are examined, and a theoretical analysis of the ES operation is carried out. Then, equivalent circuits of the isolated ES topologies have been derived. Analysis of the ES operation and effectiveness of the isolated ES topologies are validated by both simulations and experiments.",

Reliability is one of the most important challenges for the MMC consisting of a large number of submodules (SMs). The capacitor monitoring is one of the important issues in the MMC. This paper proposed a reference submodule (RSM)-based capacitor monitoring strategy for the capacitance estimation in the MMC, where the capacitances in the monitoring SMs can be estimated based on the capacitor voltage relationship between the RSM and the monitoring SMs. The proposed monitoring strategy does not rely on the information of all capacitor voltage and current, which effectively simplifies the algorithm for capacitance estimation. The simulation studies with the time-domain professional tool PSCAD/EMTDC are conducted and a down-scale MMC prototype is also tested in the laboratory with the proposed capacitor monitoring strategy. The study results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed capacitor monitoring strategy.",

        "abstract": "A dual-level hysteresis current control (DHCC) is proposed for the five-leg drive system, in which two same three-phase permanent-magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) are controlled by one five-leg voltage-source inverter. To overcome the coupling of the two PMSMs, the master\u2013slave selection principle is introduced. The coupling phase with the larger absolute value of the phase current error is determined as the master coupling phase and the leg-switch-state of the common leg is set as the phase-switch-state of the master coupling phase. On the other hand, the phase-switch-states of four individual phases are directly assigned to the four individual legs, respectively. The executing process of DHCC does not require any machine parameters, which enhances the system robustness. The effectiveness of DHCC is verified by experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Because both magnets and windings can be mounted in the mover, the primary permanent-magnet linear motor (PPMLM) has low-cost advantage for subway applications. In this paper, a fault-tolerant control (FTC) with single phase current sensor is proposed for PPMLM traction system in subway applications. In the proposed FTC, d- and q-axis currents are estimated from the reference synchronous currents and the surviving measured phase current. The estimation is robustness since no machine parameters are required. In steady-state operation, the estimated current errors are half the actual ones. As a result, the current response is slowed but the current command can be achieved. However, the achievement of control target depends on the current tracking accuracy, which is enhanced by the voltage decoupler. Compared with existed FTC schemes, the proposed one is robustness and has better transient-state performances. The effectiveness of the proposed FTC is verified by theoretical analysis and experimental results.",

To evaluate the average dc bus voltage utilisation, the maximum line-modulation-ratio, which cannot be u003e1, is defined. If the maximum line-modulation-ratio is equal to 1, the voltage capacity of voltage-source-inverter is fully utilised, which means the dc bus voltage utilisation has been maximised. Without special declarations, the overmodulation scheme is not utilised in this study. The line modulation is employed in the proposed flux-weakening control, in which the average dc bus voltage utilisation can be maximised by regulating the maximum line-modulation-ratio to 1. Compared with the conventional flux-weakening control, the proposed one is simpler and its copper loss can be reduced. The reason is that the proposed flux-weakening control employs the line modulation while the conventional flux-weakening control usually adopts the space vector pulse width modulation. The effectiveness of the proposed flux-weakening control is verified by experimental results.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a dual-channel isolated magnetically integrated charger is proposed for electric vehicles (EVs). The key is to apply and operate two interleaved power charging channels, each of which is composed of one dual-active-bridge isolated converter and one voltage-source inverter. The proposed configuration not only offers electric isolation under charging operation but also provides modular design and operation for each power conversion channel. By integrating the grid inductances with the double-stator-winding permanent-magnet (PM) synchronous machine under charging operation, the volume and weight of the charging system are saved for EVs. By reconfiguration of power circuits, the proposed dual-channel magnetically integrated EV chargers can be used for both single-phase and three-phase charging operations. The mechanical vibration caused by interaction between grid currents and PM flux can be mitigated by using the dual-channel charging operation. The interleaved operation and the phase-shifted modulation have been proposed for the dual charging channels to offer low current ripple on battery side and better harmonic performance on grid side. Furthermore, chaotic modulation strategies have been proposed to reduce the distinct switching harmonics in spectrum, which will facilitate improving the conducted electromagnetic compatibility in EVs. The experiments have been carried out on a 1-kW laboratory prototype to verify the validity of the proposed schemes.",

The object of the proposed fault-tolerant control is to maximize the torque capacity while the overcurrent protection is taken into account. Hence, the proposed fault-tolerant control is named as torque mode in this paper. Another existed fault-tolerant control for dual three-phase PMSM drives under open-phase faults is loss mode, in which the system copper loss is minimized. Torque mode is compared with loss mode, and two important conclusions are given: 1) loss mode can reduce more copper loss; 2) torque mode can output more torque. The performances of torque mode and loss mode are verified by experimental results.",

The originality of the proposed FTPMSMD relies on the fact that no reconfigurations or modifications of the controller are required from normal operation to post-fault operation. It is firstly verified by theoretical analysis that the conventional field oriented control can be directly used for both normal operation and post-fault operation. When any open-phase fault is detected, the only required action is to close the corresponding TRIAC (Triode for Alternating Current).

        "abstract": "In addition to field-oriented control and direct torque control, the model predictive control (MPC) is another typical control method for permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drives. In some critical applications, fault-tolerant controls are usually required. The faults of PMSM drives in this paper are limited as a single-phase open-circuit fault, which may be caused by open circuit or short circuit of one power switch. In the postfault operation, the neutral point of the PMSM is connected to a redundant leg. As is known, MPC is a model-based control method. Since the PMSM has different mathematical models in both normal and postfault operations, two different MPCs (MPC-I and MPC-II) should be, respectively, designed for both normal and postfault operations according to traditional thinking. However, it is first found in this paper that the faulty PMSM drive can be treated as an equivalent healthy PMSM drive, and MPC-I can be shared by both normal and postfault operations without any modification. The major contribution of this paper is to find this fact, and verify it with theoretical analysis and experimental validation. Obviously, this finding will simplify the whole control method of PMSM drives considering single-phase open-circuit fault.",

This paper performs a systematic study on the analysis and control model of the complementary MGDRM. The principle of the complementary MGDRM is illustrated in detail. The torque production and flux-weakening ability of the complementary MGDRM are analyzed by the analytical method and a revised 2D FEA method. The field-oriented-control (FOC) method for the MGDRM is first realized in this paper. On the basis of the FOC model, the torque production and flux-weakening control in a wide speed range can be implemented. The static and dynamic performances of the MGDRM are analyzed based on the FEA and simulation models. The experiments on a prototype of the complementary MGDRM are carried out to validate the study.",

As a pilot demo, an MGDRM-based hybrid powertrain with a real engine is built and tested in a real hybrid test bench. The closed-loop speed control is developed for the MGDRM, with which two pragmatic functions of the hybrid powertrain are realized by the MGDRM. First, the engine can be started by the MGDRM outer rotor no matter whether the vehicle is parked or traveling. Second, the torque coordination function of the MGDRM can help the engine to stabilize at a fixed work situation. This feature is the basement to adjust the operation and efficiency of engine. The power conversion efficiency map of the MGDRM is tested, based on which the performance of the power split in different operating situations can be evaluated.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic-geared dual-rotor motor (MGDRM) has been considered as a promising candidate of the power-split device in the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). Essentially, MGDRM is a pure electrical component without gears, so the lubrication system can be canceled, and its lifetime can also perform well. However, current series-parallel powertrain for HEVs is dominated by the Toyota Hybrid System (THS). This is because the design principle of the MGDRM has not been fully transformed to a practical technology. This paper performs as an analysis and application of the segments number design of the complementary MGDRM. Complementary structure has been proposed to improve the performance of MGDRM. In this paper, more detailed discussion of the complementary structure will be made. A prototype machine is also fabricated for experimental validation of the proposed MGDRM.",

For the stator, the displacement effect from the slots on electromotive force (EMF) is studied with two multi-unit cases. And in the rotor structure design, the inverted V-shape PMs and asymmetric flux barriers (AFB) are combined together in order to obtain a satisfying torque output. Furthermore, decoupling of concentrated windings and alternate teeth performed on the stator will enhance the fault tolerance ability of the ORIPM motor.

To meet the requirement for EV application, this paper proposes and investigates a new five-phase brushless fault-tolerant hybrid-excitation (FTHE) motor. First, the single concentrated stator winding is adopted to achieve fault-tolerance. The unequal teeth width and the asymmetric air-gap length are designed to optimize electromagnetic performances, such as back-EMF and torque. In addition, to realize flux-regulation, simple structure and no sliding contacts, based on the utilization of the high-harmonic component of the stator MMF, the rotor field winding and the rotor harmonic winding are designed. Moreover, topology and operation principle of the proposed motor are analyzed. Also, the characteristics of the proposed motor are investigated by using finite-element analysis. Finally, the experimental results are given to verify the validity of the proposed motor.",

The designed motor possesses a high fault-tolerant capacity. Also, the fault-tolerant space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) strategy and the sensorless control are adopted to further improve the fault tolerance of the control system. Moreover, unlike the existing SMO, the proposed SMO algorithm can achieve enhanced low system chattering, estimated accuracy at low speed, as well as strong robustness to motor parameters, fault and load disturbance. Numerical simulations and experiments with a 2-kW five-phase FTFSCW-IPM motor are carried out. The results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant sensorless method adopted by the FTFSCW-IPM motor.",

When switch open-circuit fault occurs, the complementary switch located in the same leg is clamped. To maintain symmetry of the two inverters, the other inverter performs the same action. The new fault-tolerant method is presented based on the post-fault reconstruction topology. Compared with the reducing rating operating mode, the proposed method has the advantages of low switching frequency, low current harmonic, and balanced output power of two inverters. Simulation results validate the correctness and validity of the proposed fault-tolerant control method in this paper.

        "abstract": "KEY MESSAGE: qhkw5-3, a major QTL for kernel weight in maize, was mapped to an interval of 125.3\u00a0kb between the InDel markers InYM20 and InYM36, and the candidate genes were analysed. Yield, of which kernel weight is a major component, is the primary trait of interest in maize breeding programmes. In our previous study, a major QTL (named qhkw5-3), which controls hundred-kernel weight, was identified and mapped to the interval between simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers SYM033 and SYM108 on chromosome 5, using an F population derived from a cross between the maize inbred line Zheng58 and the single-segment substitution line Z22. In order to fine map qhkw5-3, a larger BCF segregating population of 14,759 seeds, derived from a (Z22\u2009\u00d7\u2009Zheng58)\u2009\u00d7\u2009Z22 cross, was screened using the SSR markers SYM036 and SYM119. Forty genotypes with donor chromosomal fragments of different lengths were obtained. Progeny testing results indicated that qhkw5-3 was mapped to an interval of 442.6\u00a0kb between the SSR markers SYM077 and SYM084. Overlap mapping results, based on seven homozygous recombinant lines, showed that qhkw5-3 was narrowed down to an interval of 125.3\u00a0kb between the InDel markers InYM20 and InYM36. Within this interval, six candidate genes were analysed using qRT-PCR. The results of this study lay the foundations for cloning and functional analysis of qhkw5-3 and will contribute to advancing our knowledge of the genetic basis of yield traits in maize.",

        "abstract": "Dual mechanical port (DMP) machine, a kind of electrical continuous variable transmission, is a very competitive alternative for vulnerable constant speed-ratio mechanical gearbox in wind power application and hybrid electrical vehicles. As the inner wound rotor is surrounded by the stator and the permanent magnet (PM) outer rotor, the DMP machine suffers from possible PM demagnetization and insulation failure under severe thermal condition. In this paper, thermal analysis and cooling system design of a DMP prototype machine are investigated. To predict the heat sources in actual operation, a transient cosimulation method is presented. Thermal parameters and the flow distribution in the cooling ducts are calculated in detail. Finite-element analysis of the thermal field is carried out to obtain the temperature distribution and two typical thermal contacts are considered. A robust fully forced-air cooling system with inner rotor teeth ducts is proposed for the DMP machine and a 10-kW DMP machine is prototyped. Experimental results at different working conditions are given to verify the theoretical analysis. Both simulation and experimental results reveal that the numerical approach and the proposed cooling system are not only more accurate and reliable, but can be referred to other electrical machine cooling system design.",

The optimum current given (OCG) MPPT strategy is proposed for the outer rotor of the EVT machine. The algorithm works in two stages: In the first stage, the relationship between the loss torque and the rotor speed of the outer rotor is estimated. In the second stage, the maximum power point (MPP) is tracked by giving the optimum current considering the loss torque. For cost and reliability consideration, the novel sliding mode (SM) model reference adaptive system (MRAS) observers are adopted to estimate the outer rotor speed and position. The proposed SM-MRAS observers are based on the calculations with no need of the PI loop that exists in the classical MRAS observers.

First, the 2-D time-stepping (TS) FE analysis results considering and neglecting PM eddy current under PWM VSI supply are compared so that the cause of PM eddy current loss, the increase of high-order armature current components due to PM eddy current effect, and the decrease of the high-order components in average flux density due to leakage flux are revealed. Second, an analytical model for PM eddy current loss calculation using voltage input is deduced with the average flux density as input and a leakage flux factor is introduced in the model to meet the real case in PM machine. Moreover, the 3-D frequency FE analysis is used to verify the derived model. Third, the ratio between the average flux density and the imposed flux density is defined as a key parameter to reflect the PM eddy current reaction effect quantitatively, for both 2-D and 3-D cases. A functional relationship is established to describe the variation of the average flux density with and without considering the PM eddy current, where the parameter is obtained with nonlinear fitting of the 2-D FEA results. At last, the calculation procedure of the hybrid method is presented and a flux-concentrating field-modulated PM machine is taken as an example for calculation. The results are verified by an FE analysis. The proposed method is more efficient compared with the 3-D TS FE method while maintaining rather good accuracy.",

The proposed method can be used to calculate the PM HFHL in both 2D and 3D cases, which is testified with the experiment. Quadratic polynomial is used to fit the relationship between the dimensionless parameters and the fundamental currents. With the fitted polynomial and the analytical spectra of the HFHVs obtained from the double Fourier integration method, the PM HFHL map over entire working range can be calculated in one hour.",

To calculate the core loss of stator and other minor hysteresis loops under dc magnetic bias, core loss characteristics of silicon steel sheet under dc-biased induction condition are first tested by a simple test system based on traditional Epstein frame and a functional relationship between the change of dc-biased induction and hysteresis loss is proposed. Two core loss calculation methods considering rotational magnetization based on flux density waveform are improved to take the influence of dc-biased magnetic induction into consideration. The calculation results are verified by experiments on a prototype DSPM machine. The conclusions are also applicable to other kinds of stator PM machines.",

        "abstract": "This paper models a huge family of electrical machines featuring simple salient poles in a unified way based on the general airgap field modulation theory. The modulation principle is analyzed by introducing the magnetomotive force (MMF) modulation operator, which characterizes the influence of a variable reluctance block on the primitive magnetizing MMF distribution established by field winding. Popular machine topologies are investigated in detail from the perspective of an airgap field modulation mechanism. The iron core magnetic potential drop due to the finite slot opening depth and the impact of iron saturation on the parameters are considered by proper theoretical indication. In addition, the modulation effect of salient poles highly depends on the slot-opening-width-to-pole-pitch ratio   \u03f5 . The effect can be neglected when  \u03f5   \u03f5  = 0.5. It is also found that mainly three different harmonics parts modulated by salient poles contribute to airgap flux density and torque production. Straightforward relations between the frequency-domain or amplitude information of performances indexes and topological parameters can be obtained obviously by certain analytical expressions without heavy finite-element analysis (FEA). Analytical results are verified by two-dimensional FEA and experiments measurements.",

The equivalent airgap model containing three cascaded elements is applied, based on the general airgap field modulation theory (GAFMT), to expound the operating principle and common features of the four most conventional topologies in a unified way. The general analysis of DCM can be achieved existing in the only difference of modulation behavior, that is modulator like that in induction machine (IM) and synchronous machine (SM), whose results are consistent with the classical theory on electrical machines. Theoretical expressions for electromagnetic parameters are developed and fairly compared between different topologies to verify the validity of the proposed analytical model. In addition, torque density comparison under different constraints are revealed and iron saturation has been treated as a constant discount on the airgap magnetomotive force (MMF) due to the synchronous modulation mechanism. The theoretical predictions are demonstrated by 2D finite element analysis (FEA) and achieve good agreement.",

The lumped-parameter thermal network and the finite-element region are linked with the two kinds of boundaries, namely: equivalent convective and equivalent temperature. The users can take advantage of both methods together for more accurate and efficient thermal modeling of the electrical machines using the direct coupling method.

The combination of the fixed differential permeability method and the linear frequency FEA is proposed to investigate the relationship between arbitrary HFHV and the corresponding PM ECL at different load conditions. The analytical model proposed in the previous published paper is used to describe this relationship quantitatively. Finally, the total PM ECLs at different load conditions can be calculated based on the fast Fourier transform results of the input PWM voltages. The relative errors between the total losses obtained with the proposed method and those with time-stepping FEA are within 21% at four typical load conditions, and the proposed method can reduce the computation time for one load condition to few minutes considering arbitrary PM axial segmentation.",

Magnetically anisotropic stator and rotor behave like modulators to produce a spectrum of field harmonics and the armature winding plays the role of a spatial filter to extract effective field harmonics to contribute the corresponding flux linkage and induce the electromotive force. The developed field modulation theory not only unifies the principle analysis of a large variety of electrical machines, including conventional dc machine, induction machine, and synchronous machine which are just special cases of the general field modulated machines, thus eliminating the problem of the machine theory fragmentation, but also provides a powerful guidance for inventing new machine topologies.",

Distinct from the conventional electric machines with only one electrical and one mechanical port, electrical machines featuring multiple electrical/mechanical ports provide a highly efficient, compact, and flexible manner to convert and/or transfer energies among different ports. The additional electrical ports can be used to increase the power rating, enhance the fault-tolerant capability, and control the motion/power flow. The extended mechanical ports are commonly used to decouple the motion, speeds, and/or torque. The multiport feature opens a new era in traditional electric machinery and provides an effective approach to the application-oriented design of new energy conversion systems. Though relatively young, they have experienced rapid developments in terms of available topologies, analysis and design techniques, and control strategies in a wide range of applications, such as electric vehicle/hybrid electric vehicles, high power industrial drives, rail transportation, wind turbine systems, ac\u2013dc microgrids, more electric aircrafts, and so on, during the past decades.",

The equivalent airgap model containing three critical elements is proposed to expound their modulation principles and common features in a unified way, thus the electromagnetic performance analysis, i.e., back-electromotive force (EMF) and torque, of IM and SM can be put together from the perspective of airgap field modulation principle while the only difference exists in the modulators. The modulators are optimized by considering the nonlinearities like rotor coils resistance and leakage inductance of IM and the actual magnetomotive force (MMF) distribution of SM. Theoretical expressions of airgap flux density distribution, flux linkage and EMF, general average torque, torque density comparison, and inductance characteristics are developed to reveal the relation between the performances and initial key topological parameters systematically and verify the model feasibility entirely. The iron saturation is treated as a constant discount on the airgap MMF to provide general mechanism comprehension and reasonable parameters calculation. All the theoretical predictions are verified by two-dimensional (2-D) finite element analysis together with experiment achieving good agreement.",

In [2], a linear stator permanent magnet vernier (LSPMV) machine is proposed, in which the stator consists of an iron core wound with distributed windings and PMs mounted on the surface of the stator teeth, while the translator is designed as a simple iron core with salient teeth so that it is very robust to transmit high thrust force. Based on the magnetic gear effect, the LSPMV machine possesses the advantages such as low speed, high thrust force density and low detent force. So the LSPMV machine is considered to be one of the preferred machines for direct-drive applications.",

Design/methodology/approach - A new flux-controllable stator-PMBL motor with skewed rotor is presented. The key of the proposed motor is to incorporate both direct current field windings and permanent magnets in the stator. By using a 2D multi-slice finite element model, the electromagnetic performances such as flux linkage, self-inductance and back-EMF are obtained. To minimize the torque ripple, a vector control strategy is applied to the stator-PMBL motor drive for the first time. Findings - Some encouraging experimental results such as lower torque ripple and faster speed transients are achieved. It is shown that the three-phase flux-controllable stator-PMBL motor, when properly designed and controlled, is an interesting candidate for traction drive systems especially for electrical vehicle operation. Originality/value - The control method can also contribute the other type of stator-PMBL machines to realize the low torque ripple. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

        "abstract": "Due to the wind speed variation, wind shear and tower shadow effects, grid connected wind turbines are the sources of power fluctuations which may produce flicker during continuous operation. This paper presents a model of an MW-level variable-speed wind turbine with a doubly fed induction generatorto investigate the flicker emission and mitigation issues. An individual pitch control (IPC) strategy is proposed to reduce the flicker emission at different wind speed conditions. The IPC scheme is proposed and the individual pitch controller is designed according to the generator active power and the azimuth angle of the wind turbine. The simulations are performed on the NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) 1.5-MW upwind reference wind turbine model. Simulation results show that damping the generator active power by IPC is an effective means for flicker mitigation of variable speed wind turbines during continuous operation.",

The ends of these beams were restrained against bending in the lateral direction. The loading was continued until the peak response of the beams was reached. Forty tests were conducted to study the carrying capacity of aluminum beams under pure bending. The beams had collapsed by lateral buckling in both the elastic and the plastic ranges of the material.

        "abstract": "In order to investigate the nonlinear deformation of aluminum bending members, the influencing factor analysis of load-deflection relationship was presented adopting finite-element analysis (FEA) methods. The load-deflection curves of 126 aluminum bending members were calculated considering structural dimensions, material properties and load distribution. The theoretical formula of load-deflection curves was deduced from the moment-curvature relationship proposed in EC 9, some load-deflection curves were evaluated by numerical integrating. The differences between the results of FEA method and of theoretical method were discussed. The coefficients of the theoretical formula were modified by FEA results using non-linear fitting method. The semi-empirical formula for computing the load-deflection curve of aluminum bending members was then proposed. The result shows that the influence of nonlinear material properties of aluminum alloy should be considered when computing the deformation of aluminum bending members, and the calculating methods of this paper are comparatively accurate.",

But the post-buckling strength of the web plates is considerable since the frame composed of flanges and stiffeners can restrict the deformation of webs. Several theoretical design methods for the shear carrying capacity of aluminum girders are introduced, and the veracities of different methods are appraised by a comparison with foreign experimental data. The stress-field rotation method is found to be more exact, and some questions about its theory and application are discussed. Some modifications are performed for the stress-field rotation method. Constraints that flange and stiffened rib impose on web plate and contributions of flange to shear strength are both considered based on the existing method. Therefore the more accurate prediction of the shear carrying capacity of aluminum girders can be gained.",

The true stress-strain curves were obtained and the material constants, the activation energy Q of 417.6 kJ \u00b7 mol -1, \u03b1 of 0.003196 MPa -1, and n of 7.51, of high-temperature deformation of Inconel 690 alloy were obtained by the linear regression of peak stress. The constitutive equation of inconel 690 alloy was established finally. The relationship between the law of dynamic recrystallization and temperature, strain rate was studied by metallurgical microscope. The results showed that the microstructures of inconel 690 alloy were greatly affected by temperature, the percentage of dynamic recrystallization increased with the increasing of temperature, and accompanied by grain growth. The deformation time shortened while the strain rate enhanced. So the density of dislocation increased rapidly, and the driving force of dynamic recrystallization increased, thus the grain could also be refined. The uniform and fine microstructure could be acquired when the temperature was about 1150\u00b0C and the strain rates were in the range of 50~80 s -1.",

The results show that deformation mechanisms vary with deformation conditions: at low strain rate range, the deformation mechanism is mainly dislocation slip; at low temperature and high strain rate range, twinning is the main mechanism; at high temperature and high strain rate range, the deformation is mainly controlled by diffusion of \u03b2 phase. \u00a9 2010 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.",

        "abstract": "Driven by a good combination of strength and ductility, austenitic stainless steels have attracted much interest in the past decade. These metastable alloys fall into the category of transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) steels in which high strength and excellent ductility can be achieved due to their strain-induced martensitic transformation at ambient temperature. However, there are few reports on the detail of promoting this phase transformation and enhancing the TRIP effect during deformation only by changing the loading mode. In present work, the effect of loading modes on mechanical property and microstructure of austenitic stainless steels was investigated under various temperatures. The tensile tests results reveal that cyclic tensile loading and unloading (CTLU) mode can strongly influence the deformation behavior of AISI 304 steel. There is no difference at high temperature tension by different loading modes. Compared with the conventional monotonic tensile loading (MTL) mode, the elongation has been slightly reduced by CTLU mode at cryogenic temperature. However, CTLU mode can improve both strength and ductility of AISI 304 steel at room temperature. An in situ X-ray diffraction has been carried out to identify and evaluate strain-induced martensitic transformation by different loading modes at room temperature. Experimental results showed that the fraction of strain-induced martensite increases when unloading happens. It indicated that CTLU mode can enhance strain hardening in AISI 304 stainless steel, which prolongs the time to neck formation to a significant extent. Consequently the TRIP effect is enhanced. \u00a9 right.",

        "abstract": "GH4169 alloy is an important material used for aviation and aerospace engines because of its excellent mechanical properties in the temperature range from -253\u2103 to 650\u2103.In order to improve the safety and reliability of engines,it is crucial to obtain the forging with a uniform and fine microstructure.Generally,the forgings with large size and complex shape,such as turbine disks and engine shafts,are manufactured by multi-stage hot working processes.In addition,the microstructure of the alloy is sensitive to the hot deformation parameters.Therefore,the defects of coarse grain and duplex grain always appear in the forgings.As the \u03b4 phase in the alloy can control grain growth through the strong pinning effect,the Delta process(DP) has been developed, which uses an intentional \u03b4 phase precipitation cycle and subsequent thermomechanical processing to produce uniform fine grain billet and bar stock.In this work,for the DP of GH4169 alloy,the effect of \u03b4 phase on the tensile deformation behavior of GH4169 alloy at high temperature was studied by the tensile tests at 950\u2103.The result indicated that the tensile stress-strain curve of the GH4169 alloy with 8.21%pre-precipitated \u03b4 phase was the elastic-uniform plastic curve,and there were two different deformation processes during the uniform plastic deformation stage.The strain hardening exponent in the first deformation process was 0.494,which was higher than 0.101 in the second process.The fracture mechanism for the pre-precipitated \u03b4 phase alloy was microvoid coalescence ductile fracture,and the \u03b4 phase and carbide were the nucleuses for the formation of micropores. Thus,the existence of the \u03b4 phase made the high-temperature plasticity of GH4169 alloy decrease, and the content of the pre-precipitated \u03b4 phase must be controlled in the DP of GH4169 alloy.",

        "abstract": "The corrosion behavior of Zr53.5Cu26.5Ni5Al12Ag3 bulk amorphous alloy in 3.5% NaCl solution was investigated by using potentiodynamic polarization experiments and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that Zr53.5Cu26.5Ni5Al12Ag3 bulk amorphous alloy has the better corrosion resistance than its corresponding crystal alloy. During the bath in the 3.5% NaCl solution at 25\u00b0C, Zr53.5Cu26.5Ni5Al12Ag3 alloy has the lower corrosion current density than the corresponding crystal alloy. After 100h, the corrosion current densities of Zr53.5Cu26.5Ni5Al12Ag3 and the corresponding crystal alloy are 3.8415\u00d710-8A/cm2 and 5.2827\u00d710-7A/cm2, respectively. The results of EIS test indicate that Zr53.5Cu26.5Ni5Al12Ag3 bulk amorphous alloy has the excellent corrosion resistance because passive film with stable structure formed on the surface in 3.5% NaCl solution. With an increase in the immersion time, the passive film becomes thicker. It leads to impedance resistance and corrosion resistance decrease. The surface of Zr53.5Cu26.5Ni5Al12Ag3 bulk amorphous alloy in 3.5% NaCl solution for 100h was analyzed by SEM and EDS. The results show that the corrosive pitting can be found at both the amorphous alloy and the corresponding crystal alloy. However, the amorphous alloy has the better corrosive pitting resistance than the crystal one because the corrosion products formed by selective dissolving of Zr and Al elements. Moreover, the addition of Ag element helps to improve the corrosion resistance of the amorphous alloy greatly. \u00a9 (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

Using in situ electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) observation, systematic research and quantitative analysis are carried out on the deformation mechanism of rolled magnesium alloy sheets during uniaxial compression and tensile tests at the temperature range between 100\u00b0C and 230\u00b0C. The mechanical properties of Mg alloy sheets, texture variation and activations of slipping and twinning under different conditions are analyzed, the plastic deformation mechanism of Mg alloy sheet under different conditions and main factors influencing plastic formability are revealed. The results reveal that, to some extent, the change of mechanical property, texture variation and grain orientation evolution are determined by percentage of twinning activations. Mg alloy sheets have higher plastic deformation capability at 170\u00b0C, activations of large number of pyramidal slipping systems are good for coordinating deformation in thickness direction. According to the achieved deformation mechanisms, several suggestions are proposed for stamping process of magnesium alloy sheets. The warm forming process of magnesium alloy sheets is proposed and several typical magnesium alloy parts are developed using different warm forming technologies.",

The formability can be improved by pulsating hydroforming in which the effect on formability should be understood from two different aspects of process parameters and material properties. The tube is uniformly expanded by repeating the appearance and disappearance of small wrinkling and the contact friction force between the tube and die is reduced under the pulsating load path condition. On the other hand, the enhanced transformation induced plasticity(TRIP) effect can improve the formability of austenitic stainless steel by pulsating load. Pulsating hydroforming equipment has been independently designed and developed which is composed of axial feed control system, liquid filling system and high pressure creation and pulsating load control system. The research results have both important theoretical significance and practical potential in application of pulsating hydroforming technology in the fields of automobile, aeronautical and astronautical industry.",

The results indicated that the tensile stress\u2013strain curves of the three specimens were the elastic-uniform plastic curves, and there were two deformation processes during the uniform plastic deformation stage of the delta-processed specimens. The strain hardening exponent in the first deformation process was higher than that in the second process, and the value of the strain hardening exponent increased as the content of \u03b4 phase increased. In addition, the plasticity of the specimen at elevated temperatures decreased as the content of \u03b4 phase increased. However, the fracture mechanisms for all the specimens were all microvoid coalescence ductile fracture, and the \u03b4 phase and carbide were the nucleuses for the formation of micropores. The elongation for the specimen with 8.21% pre-precipitated \u03b4 phase was still as high as 80%. Thus, delta-processed Inconel 718 alloy presented excellent high-temperature plasticity.",

The effect of \u03b4 phase precipitation on the static recrystallization process was also analyzed. The results show that \u03b4 phase preferentially precipitates comparing to static recrystallization. Affecting by the \u03b4 phase preferential precipitation process, sub-grain migration is the main nucleation mechanism in the static recrystallization of cold-rolled Inconel 718 alloy at 980\u00a0\u00b0C. Meanwhile, strain-induced boundary migration also exists as an aided nucleation mechanism when the rolling reduction is less than 30%.",

The formability can be improved by pulsating hydroforming in which the effect on formability should be understood from two different aspects of process parameters and material properties. The tube is uniformly expanded by repeating the appearance and disappearance of small wrinkling and the contact friction force between the tube and die is reduced under the pulsating load path condition. On the other hand, the enhanced transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) effect can improve the formability of austenitic stainless steel by pulsating load. Pulsating hydroforming equipment has been independently designed and developed which is composed of axial feed control system, liquid filling system and high pressure creation and pulsating load control system. The research results have both important theoretical significance and practical potential in application of pulsating hydroforming technology in the fields of automobile, aeronautical and astronautical industry. \u00a9 2013 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.",

For the situation of radial temperature gradient existing on the billet, it can be found that the initial inhomogeneous temperature distribution in the billet affect the alloy flow seriously during the hot tube extrusion process. Also the inhomogeneous temperature distribution can leads to some defects, such as inhomogeneous deformation and crack on the surface of the extrude tube.

The analytical models for calculation of the drawing force, power consumption, and the temperature rise are addressed by considering the real steel wire drawing condition, and a new die wear factor indicating die wear and life is established based on the slab method. The genetic algorithm has been implemented to build up a single objective optimizer for minimizing the total power consumption and a multiobjective optimizer for minimizing both the total power consumption and temperature rise under several deliberate design constraints. The numerical examples show that the multiobjective optimizer presents better performance in finding the optimal solution, compared with the single objective optimizer. Different types of optimization methods especially designed for real demands are demonstrated under multiobjective optimization set. Compared with a reference design, it indicates that significant improvements in the total power consumption and the control of maximum temperature, delta factor, and die life have been achieved by the optimization.

Tensile deformation in SiCp/AA2009 composites was simulated using the microstructure-based model constructed from the metallograph. Matrix damage, particle cracking, and interface debonding were simulated combining the ductile damage model, the normal stress criterion, and the maximum stress ratio criterion. The simulation results show that under tensile loading, damage initiates at the interface, and then propagates along the weakest direction. The simulation microstructures agree well with experimental results in which interface debonding, particle cracking, and matrix damage co-exist.

        "abstract": "The dynamic globularization kinetics of Ti\u20136.5Al\u20131.5Zr\u20133.5Mo\u20130.3Si alloy with a colony alpha microstructure during deformation at temperature range of 920\u2013980 \u00b0C and strain rate range of 0.01\u201310 s \u22121 was quantitatively characterized and investigated. The results show that both the globularization fraction and globularized grain size were sensitive to deformation conditions. At temperature higher than 950 \u00b0C, strain rates higher than 0.1 s \u22121 and true strain around 3, enhanced grain refinement was achieved through dynamic globularization. The refined structure shows improved superplasticity characteristics including near fully equaxied alpha grains around 1 \u03bcm, discontinues beta phase and high dislocation density at the globularized grain boundaries. The dynamic globularization kinetics characteristic was associated with deformation mechanism that controls the dynamic globularization process. Keywords High-temperature alloys Microstructure Kinetics Strain 1 Introduction Titanium alloys, particularly two phase titanium alloys have been widely used as advanced structural materials in aeronautic applications. Especially, the alloy with a nominal composition of Ti\u20136.5Al\u20131.5Zr\u20133.5Mo\u20130.3Si (named TC11 alloy), developed on the basis of the Russia alloy VT9, is a typical two phase alloy and has now been the most widely used titanium alloy in aerospace field in China to produce the compressor discs and blades. Due to the additions of beta isomorphous element Mo, neutral element Zr and beta eutectoid elements Si into Ti\u20136Al base, TC11 alloy has a higher strength, better creep resistance and more excellent thermal stability, especially at elevated temperatures compared with conventional Ti\u20136Al\u20134V alloy [1,2] The lamellar microstructure associated with as-cast or beta-processed two phase titanium alloys has been found to break up or globularize both dynamically during deformation and statically during post deformation annealing in the alpha/beta phase field, which plays a key role in development of desired microstructure for final forming or service. Therefore, the globularization process has received considerable attention [3\u20137] . Many studies have investigated dynamic globularization of two phase titanium alloys. In early works, Kaybyshev et al. [8\u201310] studied the evolution of platelike microstructure during superplastic deformation (at strain rates in order of 10 \u22123 s \u22121 ) in the alpha/beta range of VT9 alloy at a qualitative level. The dynamic globularization process was found to be governed by the alpha \u2192 beta transformation and the development of grain boundary sliding. Semiatin et al. [11,12] observed that the dynamic globularization of Ti\u20136Al\u20134V alloy with colony alpha structure occurred at strain rate lower than 0.01 s \u22121 ; strains around of the order of 0.75\u20131.0 and 2\u20132.5 were required respectively for \u2018initiation\u2019 and competition of dynamic globularization. Later study [13\u201315] indicated that the dependence of dynamic globularization kinetics on test temperature and initial microstructure appeared to be complex. Recently submicron grain structure was achieved by warm deformation of Ti\u20136Al\u20134V alloy at low temperature (550 \u00b0C) and low strain rate (0.001 s \u22121 ) as a result of dynamic globularization [16] . It can be found that the former researches were focused on globularization behavior at low strain rate or warm temperature. However, most thermomechanical processing of two phase titanium alloys for ingot breakdown on hammer or hydraulic press in industry was carried out under high temperature and high strain rate (above 0.01 s \u22121 ) conditions. Although the most recently research by Park et al. [17] showed enhanced superplasticity by dynamic globularization at high strain rate (0.1 s \u22121 ) for Ti\u20136Al\u20134V alloy with martensite microstructure, quantitative analysis of dynamic globularization kinetics was still unclear under such conditions for alloys with colony alpha structure. The object of present work is to quantitatively investigate dynamic globularization kinetics at strain rates higher than 0.01 s \u22121 of TC11 alloy with a colony alpha structure. In addition, the optimum processing parameters are determined within experimental conditions corresponding to significantly grain refinement by dynamic globularization. 2 Experimental procedures The chemical compositions (wt.%) of TC11 alloy used in this investigation are as follows: 6.17 Al, 3.41 Mo, 1.77 Zr, 0.285 Si, 0.054 Fe, 0.014 C, 0.01 N, 0.0006 H, 0.100 O, and balance Ti. The \u03b2 transus temperature was measured about 1020 \u00b0C. The received wrought bars with a diameter of 10 mm were heated to 1040 \u00b0C, held for 30 min followed by furnace cooling. The initial microstructure of the heat treated material is given in Fig. 1 . The microstructure shows a colony alpha structure consisting of lamellar alpha colonies in prior coarse \u03b2 grains (average grain size about 500 \u03bcm), a grain boundary alpha layer (in thickness of 5 \u03bcm) and continuous beta layers in between the colony alpha lamellae (in thickness of 3 \u03bcm), which has a typical microstructure characteristic before cogging process in alpha/beta phase field. Compression specimens machined from the heat treated bars were subjected to 30\u201380% isothermal hot compression tests on a Gleeble 3500 thermal simulator in the temperature range 920\u2013980 \u00b0C and strain rate range 0.01\u201310 s \u22121 . The specimens were heated to test temperatures at a heating speed of 5 \u00b0C/s, held for 3 min, compressed to the given reduction and then water quenched to room temperature. The deformed specimens were sectioned parallel to the compression axis for microstructural analysis. The samples for optical metallographic examination were made by mechanically polished and etched with a solution consisting of 10 pct HF, 20 pct HNO 3 and 60 pct H 2 O. Because of the inhomogeneous deformation and non-uniform strain distribution in the compressed specimens, FEM was applied to calculate the local strains for microstructure observation. Since the beta phase transforms during cooling, it was mainly the primary alpha phase, which governs the structure type of the alloy, was studied. Globularization behavior of the alpha lamellae was then quantified using moderate magnification optical photographs by a quantitative metallographic image analysis system considering alpha phase with the aspect (length/width) ratio lower than 2 as a globular. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of dynamic globularization kinetics Micrographs at test temperatures of 920 \u00b0C and 980 \u00b0C at a large strain in Fig. 2 showed: partially globularization with fine globularized grains at low temperature (920 \u00b0C) and high strain rate (0.1 s \u22121 ); near fully globularization with fine globularized grains at high temperature (980 \u00b0C) and high strain rate (0.1 s \u22121 ); fully globularized structure with coarser alpha grains at low strain rates (0.01 s \u22121 ) at both temperatures. Quantitative measurements of the fraction globularized as a function of strain and globularized grain size at different strain rates and temperatures are summarized in Figs. 3 and 4 . It revealed that a critical strain is needed for globularization initiation and both globularization fraction and globularized alpha grain size are very sensitive to deformation conditions. It can be found in Fig. 3 that the globularization fraction increases with strain in a sigmoid way and it assumes that the globularized fraction f g follows an Avrami type equation: (1) f g = 1 \u2212 exp [ \u2212 k \u22c5 ( \u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5 c ) n ] Non-linear curve fitting using Eq. (1) shows a good agreement with the experimental results seen in Fig. 3 . Thus, the critical strain (to be \u025b c in Eq. (1) ) for initiation of globularization and the strain needed fully globularization ( \u025b f ) was then predicted respectively using Eq. (1) . The result is shown in Table 1 . 3.2 Analysis of the critical strain It reveals that a critical strain for initiation of globularization between 0.42\u20130.65 for all deformation conditions is needed (in Fig. 3 ) and the value shows relatively weak dependence on deformation temperature and strain rate (seen from Table 1 ). The same phenomenon was also found in [13] for Ti\u20136Al\u20134V alloy, although the critical strain reported is a little higher (\u223c1.0) because of difference in alloys and the initial structures. In addition, the critical strain is much higher than peak strain (generally lower than 0.1) on the flow stress curves [13] . This phenomenon has big difference from general dynamic recrystallization (DRX) process, for which the critical strain is lower (less than the peak strain) and strongly dependent on deformation conditions. Thus, dynamic globularization may have different mechanism with DRX. During DRX process, critical strain is corresponding to critical dislocation density needed for new grain nucleation. Thus the critical strain value has strong dependence on deformation temperature and strain rate which affects the dynamic recovery behavior and dislocation density. While, for dynamic globularization involving a reduction in the aspect ratio of the plates, as suggested in [18] , it can be interpreted in terms of geometric recrystallization, during which intraphase boundary forms as the first step instead of nucleation of new grains. The process is controlled by dislocation glide and therefore the limited sensitivity of critical strain to deformation temperature and strain rate may be rationalized on the basis that cumulative effect of the dislocation glide processes is related to strain magnitude per se. It is also found that a large fraction of the lamellae has rotated to orientations perpendicular to the compression axis [18] at the critical strain levels needed for onset of dynamic globularization. It suggests that the reorientation of lamellae (in the form of lamellae kinking) also accounts for larger critical strain levels needed before globularization initiation. 3.3 Effect of deformation conditions on the globularized fraction Seen from Fig. 3 and Table 1 , the evolution of globularized fraction versus strain shows significantly dependence on deformation conditions. The globularization kinetics rate versus strain can be defined as: (2) v = \u2202 f g \u2202 \u03b5 The calculated kinetics rate versus strain curves is shown in Fig. 5 . The kinetics rate increases with decreasing strain rate, especially when the strain rate decreasing from 0.1 to 0.01 s \u22121 (also seen in Fig. 2 ). While, the dependence of kinetics on strain rate is not significant when strain rate is higher than 0.1 s \u22121 (in Figs. 5 a and 3 ). The dependent of kinetics on temperature (in Figs. 5 b and 3 ) is weak at strain rate 0.01 s \u22121 and at higher temperatures at 0.1 s \u22121 but with sharp decreasing when temperature drops from 950 to 920 \u00b0C. The kinetics rate then determines the dependence trend of \u025b f on deformation conditions (shown in Table 1 ). The sensitivity of globularization kinetics on strain rate and temperature with sharp change, which is in contrast with the result in [8] , could suggest that the dynamic recovery may play a significant role in globularization process which controls formation of intraphase boundary as a first step for globularization in the mechanism proposed by Weiss et al. [18] . It is also noted that the kinetics rate first increases and then decreases with strain increasing and has a peek value at a strain corresponding to 40\u201360% globularization. The same phenomenon has been reported in DRX process and was interpreted by a result of competition between the new grain nucleation rate and grain growth rate. As discussed above, there is no new grain nucleation during dynamic globularization. So, the decrease of kinetics speed after the peak value may be caused by reduction of aspect ratio of lamellae after certain amount of globularization which makes the continue fragmentation of lamellae more difficult. Another important reason may be that much part of deformation is exerted on globularized phase because of easier deformation ability of equiaxed grains than lamellae. Deformation mechanism analysis by Kim [19] also found that the grain boundary sliding of globularized grains took place after heavy deformation of Ti\u20136Al\u20134V alloy with colony alpha structures. 3.4 Effect deformation conditions on globularized grain size The measured grain size of globularized alpha phase at different deformation conditions is shown in Fig. 4 . It can be seen that the sharp change occurs in globularized grain size when the strain rate decreases from 0.1 s \u22121 . The globularized grain size in the strain rate range of 0.1\u201310 s \u22121 has a slight increase with temperature and remains around 1 \u03bcm. However, when the strain rate decreases to 0.01 s \u22121 , there is a sharp increase of globularized grain size with temperature up to 6 \u03bcm. When strain rate decreases further, even coarser globularized grain was found for Ti\u20136Al\u20134V alloy [5] . As proposed in [18] , during globularization process, grooves formed on the surface of the alpha plates either by surface tension related effects or shear localization within the plates may serve to fragment the plates into nearly equiaxed regions via penetration of beta phase, with the diameter approximately equal to the plate thickness. However, as seen in Fig. 6 , very close plate thickness (both around 0.4 \u03bcm) is found before globularization deformed at the same temperature and at strain rate 0.1 and 0.01 s \u22121 , respectively but with sharp difference in globularized grain size. So the fragment of alpha plates may indeed occur as suggested in [18] , the globualrized grain size may not essentially equal to the plate thickness, and it is dependent on the aspect ratio of the fragment which finally becomes globular driven by surface energy. It can be seen from Fig. 6 b, at strain rate 0.1 s \u22121 , the length of fragment is similar to plate thickness and the finally globularized grain size is more or less close to plate thickness. However, when deformed at 0.01 s \u22121 ( Fig. 6 a), the length of fragment is larger than plate thickness, thus a globularized grain size bigger than plate thickness could be readily anticipated. This difference in aspect ratio of plate fragment is caused by different dynamic recovery rate at two different strain rates. At higher strain rate, more dislocations are produced and the dislocation walls are denser due to poorer recovery rate and dislocations can still be found in short fragment formed by two adjacent dislocation walls in Fig. 6 b. While at low strain rate, due to fast recovery rate, dislocation gliding and annihilation are easier, less amount of dislocation walls are formed, and nearly no dislocations can be found in the relatively longer plate fragment in Fig. 6 a. When the deformation continues, the dislocation walls transfer to intraphaser boundaries and form lamellar fragment with different aspect ratios and finally different globular sizes. 3.5 Enhanced grain refinement through dynamic globularization From kinetics analysis above, the optimal deformation conditions for globularization is 950\u2013980 \u00b0C and 0.1\u20131 s \u22121 , under which near fully equiaxed microstructure with grain size around 1 \u03bcm can be achieved with a strain over 3. Meanwhile, the globularization kinetics is weakly dependent on deformation conditions within the optimum processing window. Decrease in globularized grain size with strain rate increasing was also found for Ti\u20136Al\u20134V alloy with a colony alpha structure in [5] , but the globularized fraction was too low to form a macro refined structure due to limited compression deformation. Though the refined globularized microstructure has been reported obtained by deformation at warm temperature and low strain rate for colony structure [16] or at hot temperature and higher strain rate for martensite structure [17] , this is the first time that the refined globularized microstructure is achieved under high temperature and higher strain rate conditions for colony structure at large strains (over 3). Because of thermal inertia in large billets, colony structures are most often produced even using water quenching after single beta processing. Thus the present finding should have more practical significance for cogging process of two phase titanium alloys in industry. As deformation time is very low at such higher strain rates, the interpretation of this near fully globularized microstructure is not enough by the reported mechanisms in [8\u201310] and [18] consisting of processes including intraphase boundaries formation and phase transformation which are time consuming. Thus, other globularization mechanisms for alloys deformed at higher strain rates deserve further study. The SEM and TEM observation of the refined structure achieved via large strain deformation at 980 \u00b0C and 0.1 s \u22121 is shown in Fig. 7 , and similar characteristic to research result in [17] for martensite structure can be found: discontinuously distributed beta phase due to dynamic recrystallization and high dislocation density at the globularized grain boundaries (indicated by the arrow in Fig. 7 b). Thus according to the result in [17] , this microstructure should also have improved superplasticity which is more favorable for the finally isothermal die forging. 4 Conclusion Dynamic globularization kinetics of TC11 alloy has been studied in the temperature range of 920\u2013980 \u00b0C and strain rate range of 0.01\u201310 s \u22121 . The following conclusions have bee drawn from the results of this investigation. (1) The dynamic globularization kinetics TC11 alloy is sensitive to deformation conditions and follows an Avrami type sigmoid equation versus strain. (2) Critical strains around 0.42\u20130.65 are needed for globularization initiation for all deformation conditions, and both globularization kinetics rate and globualrized grain size increase with increasing temperature and decreasing strain rate with sharp change at strain rate lower than 0.1 s \u22121 and temperature lower than 950 \u00b0C. (3) Refined equiaxed structure can be achieved at the optimum processing parameters of 950\u2013980 \u00b0C and 0.1\u20131 s \u22121 with a strain about or over 3, which is favorable for practical industry application.

        "abstract": "Superalloy Inconel 718 is an important material used for aero-engine high temperature turbine disks. The grain refining of Inconel 718 becomes critical because of the improvement in the quality and reliability of aero-engine. Inconel 718 turbine disks are manufactured by multi-stage hot deformation processes, in which the recrystallized grain grows up in next passes. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain a uniform and refined microstructure by recrystallization refining. The \u03b4 phase in Inconel 718 can control grain size through the strong pinning effect. Thus, the Delta process (DP) has been applied for the forging of Inconel 718. In this paper, for the DP of Inconel 718, the evolution of \u03b4 phase during isothermal compression deformation at temperature of 950\u00b0C and strain rate of 0.005 s-1, was studied by using optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The results show that spherical or rod-shaped \u03b4 phase particles in the interior of grains precipitated in the aging treatment disappear during the heating and holding time before deformation, and the content of \u03b4 phase decreases from 8.14% to 7.05%. Dissolution of \u03b4 phase occurs during the deformation, and the content of \u03b4 phase decreases from 7.05% to 5.14%. The spheroidization of plate-like or needle-like \u03b4 phase takes place due to the effect of deformation and dissolution breakages, and the plate-like or needle-like \u03b4 phase transferrs to spherical or rod-shaped \u03b4 phase. In the centre with the largest strain, the plate-like or needle-like \u03b4 phase disappears and spherical or rod-shaped \u03b4 phase appears in the interior of grains and grain boundaries. \u00a9 Right.",

        "abstract": "The subtransus deformation behavior of TC11 alloy is analyzed based on deformation mechanisms. Isothermal compression tests are applied a temperature range of 890-995\u00b0C and a strain rate range of 0. 01-10 s 1. The flow stress curves show that the flow stress increases with decreasing temperature and increasing strain rate; with increasing strain, the flow stress shows characteristic including quick hardening and moderate softening. The flow softening can be related to reduction of Hall-Petch strengthening effects due to transfer from the hard slip mode to the soft one. Finally a new constitutive equation was established for large strain subtransus deformation of TC11 alloy by combining the Estrin and Mecking hardening model and an empirical flow softening model.",

In order to study the mechanism of such flow softening behavior, the deformation behavior of TC11 Ti alloy with a lamellar structure was studied using isothermal hot compression tests under a temperature range of 890-995\u00b0C and a strain rate range of 0.01-10 s-1. Theoretical calculation shows the Hall-Petch strengthening effects induced by \u03b1/\u03b2 interface as well as the twin boundary in \u03b1 lamellar are far more significant than that of the colony boundary.

The results showed that sufficient axial feed must be given before the tube contacting the surface of die in order to prevent the excessive thickness thinning, especially for longer tube blank. The lower loading velocity led to enhanced formability. It is more important that pulsating loading path observably improved the formability of 304 stainless steel. \u00a9 (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

The testing temperatures were in the range of 1000-1200 C, the strain rate was 10 s -1, and the maximum true strain was 0.9. Optical microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and electron backscatter diffraction techniques were employed to analyze the microstructure evolution and nucleation mechanisms of dynamic recrystallization (DRX). The results show that multiple-cycle discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) occurs in the process of hot deformation under the conditions above. DRX grain size decreases with decreasing temperature and increasing strain. DDRX with sub-grains directly transforming into grains is the dominating nucleation mechanism of DRX. And, the nucleation mechanism of bulging of the original grain boundaries can only be considered as an assistant nucleation mechanism of DRX, which mainly occurs in the beginning of the deformation. \u00a9 2013 ASM International.",

        "abstract": "The effect of processing parameters on hot workability and microstructure evolution during subtransus deformation of TC11 alloy with widmanstaten microstructure was studied using isothermal compression tests. Testing was conducted at strain rates of 0.1-10s-1, temperature ranges 920-980\u00b0C and height reductions of 30-70%. The influence of hot working parameters on flow behavior, hot workability and microstructure evolution was systemically investigated. The results showed that all the flow curves exhibited a peak stress at very low strains (<0.1) followed by extensive flow softening. Surface fracture, cavitations and localized shear flow were found to be main factors that limited the hot workability of TC11 alloy. At low strains, lamellar kinking started to occur due to the orientation between the colony a lamellar and stress axis. With deformation continues, reorientation of the lamellar colony occurred and the deformed lamellar became elongatedand thinner. At high stains, segmentation and globularization of a lamellar took place to produce a refined microstructure with a grain size around 1\u03bcm that is technologically desirable for secondary processes such as superplastic forming. A microstructure mechanism map based on the previous results was then established and applied to process design considering defect and microstructure control. \u00a9 World Scientific Publishing Company.",

Based on the Cu\u2013La binary alloy phase diagram, the Gibbs free energy of the phase precipitation reactions of Cu6La and Cu5La was deduced. The results showed that the values of \u0394H, S E, and G E of Cu\u2013La binary alloy were all negative. Compared to the ideal solution, the activities of the components presented a large negative deviation from Raoult\u2019s law, which indicated that there was a strong interaction between Cu and La. The calculated data are well consistent with the experimental data. The Gibbs free energies of the phase precipitation reactions of Cu6La are lower than those for Cu5La, which means that Cu6La is thermodynamically more stable than Cu5La. Furthermore, the experimental results show that rareearth rich Cu6La phase particles in copper matrix are formed after La microalloying.",

        "abstract": "In this article, the hot stamping-bake toughening process has been proposed following the well-known concept of bake hardening. The influences of the bake time on the microstructure and the mechanical properties of the hot stamped-baked part were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and mechanical tests at room temperature. The results show that the amount of the retained austenite was nearly not changed by the bake process. Also observed were spherical Cu-rich precipitates of about 15\u00a0nm in martensite laths. According to the Orowan mechanism, their contribution of the Cu-rich precipitates to the strength is approximately 245\u00a0MPa. With the increase of the bake time, the tensile strength of the part was decreased, whereas both the ductility and the product of the tensile strength and ductility were increased then decreased. The tensile strength and ductility product and the tensile strength are as high as 21.9\u00a0GPa\u00a0pct, 2086\u00a0MPa, respectively. The excellent combined properties are due to the transformation-induced plasticity effect caused by retained austenite.",

        "abstract": "The effects of small amount addition of the rare-earth Ce on the microstructure, mechanical properties, and corrosion resistance behavior of cast pure copper were investigated using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometry (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), tensile testing, and potentiodynamic polarization measurements. It was indicated that Ce addition significantly refined the grain and enhanced the tensile strength of cast pure copper. Copper alloy with 0.12\u00a0wt.% Ce addition had the smallest equiaxed grains of 358.\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023.53\u00a0\u03bcm and the ultimate tensile strength of 181.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7 MPa. Ce formed spherical second phase particles with copper, which were revealed as CuCe by EDS and TEM results. Solid solution strengthening, fine-grain\u00a0strengthening, and second-phase precipitation strengthening played important roles in the tensile strength improvement. However, the elongation decreased due to the second phase particles\u2019 inhomogeneous distribution. The corrosion resistance properties of micro-alloyed copper alloys in 0.5 mol/L HCl solution were improved when Ce addition was limited to less than 0.069\u00a0wt.% owing to a purification effect and the formation of a compact corrosion product film on the copper matrix. The influencing mechanisms of Ce on the microstructure, mechanical property, and corrosion property were also discussed in detail.",

The principle is an extension of the minimum complementary energy principle to this particular non linear mechanical system. Under the assumptions that a convex complementary energy exists and that relative displacements between particles are small, it allows us to synthesize the generation mechanism of the force network from an energetic point of view and provides, besides the existing methods (e.g. Discrete Element Method), a new method to analyze the contact force distribution in discrete particle systems. Here the contact force network in a packing of identical elastic frictionless spheres with Hertz contacts is determined and it is shown that it is unique and independent both by the value of the applied load and by the value of elastic constants. Numerical examples confirm that the contact forces so determined are consistent with previous experimental results.",

Advances of crystal plasticity on the deformation mechanism of Mg alloy are firstly described, especially its applications on the prediction of sheet forming process. Then, a new macroscopic constitutive model is introduced, which possesses an enhanced description capacity of tension/compression anisotropy and anisotropic hardening. In order to take into account the twinning process of hexagonal close-packed material, a modified hierarchical multi-scale model is also established with adequate accuracy in a shorter computational time. The advanced forming limit of sheet metal, mainly about aluminum alloy, is also investigated. Besides the above theory developments, some new sheet metal forming technologies are reviewed simultaneously. The warm forming technology of Mg alloy is discussed. New processes to form sheet parts and to bend tubes are proposed by using hard granules. On the other hand, a new kind of ultra-high-strength steel based on typical 22MnB5 by introducing more residual austenite and Cu-rich phase to increase the elongation and strength and its novel forming method that integrates hot stamping and quenching participation are proposed. Progresses in sheet hydroforming, press forging and electromagnetic forming of sheet metal parts are also summarized.",

The validity of the proposed parameter is confirmed by accurately predicting twin variants developed during double pass differential speed rolling of Mg-3Al-1Zn alloy. The analysis based on the ESF concept clarifies that shear stress and their relative magnitude to the normal stress have considerable impact on the activation of the predominate slip, twin type and variants.",

        "abstract": "For plastic deformed parts, the dimensional accuracy is significantly affected by residual stresses and so does the performance in service. Therefore, the rolling process of GH4169 alloy sheet at room temperature was investigated by finite element method. The effects of rolling reduction, friction coefficient, rolling velocity and initial stress on the longitudinal residual stress distribution over the thickness of GH4169 alloy sheet were analyzed. The results show that the values of longitudinal residual stress can be slightly reduced by increasing the rolling reduction and velocity. The longitudinal residual stress over the thickness distributes as \u201cV\u201d type or weak \u201cW\u201d type. The initial stress mainly has an effect on the longitudinal stress in the backward slip area. But the friction coefficient has remarkable influence on longitudinal residual stress. With the friction coefficient increasing from 0.1 to 0.5, the value of longitudinal residual stress on the sheet surface is reduced by 282 MPa. Simultaneously, the tensile stress turns into compressive stress with a strong \u201cW\u201d type distribution.",

        "abstract": "The deformation and internal defect in the flat-wedge cross-wedge rolling (CWR) of GH4169 superalloy were investigated numerically using a coupled thermo-mechanical finite element analysis (FEA) model. The simulation analysis showed that the temperature distribution in the work piece was non-uniform during the flat-wedge CWR. When the initial temperature of the work piece was relatively low, the work piece temperature increased, a heating effect of the plastic deformation, while relatively high initial work piece temperatures resulted in cooling the work piece, caused by the work piece contact with the tools. It is noted that the increase of tools moving speeds is helpful to reduce the generation of internal defects in the flat-wedge CWR of GH4169 alloy. An important tendency is that both increasing the tools temperature and decreasing friction coefficient all can contribute to avoiding the center defects in the flat-wedge CWR of GH4169 alloy",

The absorptivity of La and its effects on microstructure, tensile and corrosion properties of HCC TP2 copper tube were studied by means of the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and potentiodynamic polarization measurements. The results show that the absorptivity of La in the HCC TP2 copper tube is about 15% under antivacuum conditions due to the good chemical activities of La. The impurity elements in copper tube such as O, S, Pb and Si can be significantly reduced, and the average columnar dendrite spacing of the copper tube can also be reduced from 2.21 mm to 0.93 mm by adding La. The ultimate tensile strength and the elongation with and without La addition are almost unchanged. However, the annual corrosion rate of the HCC TP2 copper tube is reduced from 10.18 mm\u2022a-1 to 9.37 mm\u2022a-1 by the purification effect of trace La.",

The results indicate that the pre-compressive strain remarkably affects the reverse tensile yield stress and the width of the detwinning-dominant stage during inverse tension process. Similar to stress\u2013strain curve of the uniaxial compression, the curve of reverse tensile yield value also has \u2018S\u2019 shape, and its minimum value is only 38 MPa. The relationship between pre-compressive strain and the width of detwinning-dominant stage presents a linear growth, and the greater the pre-compressive strain is, the smaller the strain hardening rate of the detwinning-slip-dominant stage is. Compared with the reverse tension under pre-compression, the influence of the pre-tension deformation on the deformation mechanism of subsequent compression is relatively simple. With the increase in pre-tension strain, the yield stress of the reverse loading is rising.",

Metallic wear particles were made by vacuum ball milling. Wear particles suspension was prepared into the concentration of 10 mg/mL with PBS. Fifty female Kunming mice (aged 8-10 weeks, weighing about 25 g) were selected. Of 50 mice, 10 were used as the donors of bone graft, the other 40 were equally divided into control group (group A), particle group (group B), VEGF group (group C), and VEGF inhibited group (group D). Air pouches were made on the back of 40 mice by injecting sterile air subcutaneously. At 8th day, a graft of calvaria from the donor mice was implanted in air pouch. In groups B, C, and D, 0.5 mL wear particles suspension was injected into the air pouches, and in group A, 0.5 mL PBS was injected. Once a day at 6th and 7th days during the air pouch preparation and one time every two days after bone implantation, 0.2 mL recombinant human VEGF (rhVEGF) and VEGF antibody (Bevacizumab) were injected into the air pouches in groups C and D, respectively. In group A and group B, 0.2 mL saline was injected. Pouch tissues and bone were harvested at 2 weeks after bone implantation for HE staining, real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR and ELISA analyses.All mice survived to the end of experiment. The gross observation showed that there were mild redness, swelling, and less neovascularization in air pouches in group A. There were obvious redness, swelling, and more exudative and neovascularization in groups B, C, and D, most obvious in group C, the next in group B, then in group D. The histological and molecular biological analysis showed that inflammatory responses and osteolysis were obvious in group B and the pouch membrane thickness, the cell density, transforming growth factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and VEGF were significantly higher than those in group A (P < 0.05). The inflammatory responses and osteolysis were most obvious in group C and the above-mentioned indexes were significantly higher than those in group B (P < 0.05). There were some inflammatory responses and osteolysis in group D, but the indexes were significantly lower than those in group B (P < 0.05) and were significantly higher than those in group A (P < 0.05).VEGF can promote inflammatory responses and osteolysis in aseptic loosening of prosthesis. VEGF antibody can effectively inhibit wear particle-induced osteolysis.",

        "abstract": "Lots of metal ions accumulation and over-expression of receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) around the prosthesis could be found in revision of total hip arthroplasty. To investigate the relationship between metal ions and aseptic loosening by observing the effects of Co2+ and Cr3+ ions on the expression of RANKL and osteoprotegerin (OPG) from osteoblast.Osteoblasts were cultured in vitro at the density of 1 x 10(5) cells/mL, and were divided into 2 groups according to different culture solutions. In control group, osteoblasts were cultured with normal medium without CoCl2 and CrCl3. In experimental group, osteoblasts were cultured with the medium including CoCl2 (10 mg/L) and CrCl3 (150 mg/L) solutions. The RT-PCR and ELISA methods were applied to detect the mRNA expression of RANKL and OPG and protein level at 24 and 48 hours after co-cultured, respectively.RT-PCR revealed that the mRNA expression of RANKL and OPG could be found in two groups at 24 and 48 hours after co-cultured, the expression was higher in the experimental group than in control group, especially the expression of RANKL, showing significant difference (P < 0.05). At 24 and 48 hours after co-cultured, the ratios of RANKL mRNA to OPG mRNA in the experimental group were 0.860 and 1.232, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in the control group (0.695 and 0.688, P < 0.05). ELISA revealed that the protein level of RANKL and OPG in experimental group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05).Co2+ and Cr3+ can stimulate the mRNA expressions of RANKL, OPG and secretion of those protein from osteoblasts, especially increase of the RANKL, which promotes the formation and activation of osteoblasts and the generation of aseptic loosening.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Similar to other prosthesis, metal-metal prosthesis would produce plenty of wear particles and metal ions, mainly presented as cobalt (Co 2+) and chromium (Cr 3+), which can lead to osteolysis, eventually, result in aseptic loosening. OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Co 2+ and Cr 3+ ions on the cells viability and expression of RANK in rats monocyte-macrophage cells (RAW264.7) in vitro. METHODS: Monocyte-macrophage cells (RAW264.7) were cultured in vitro, and then the cells were exposed to Co 2+ and Cr 3+ ions. The cell viability was assured by MTT test and the level of RANK mRNA was detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR at different times. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Compared to the control group, MTT test demonstrated that Co 2+ and Cr 3+ ions could decrease the cell activity of monocyte-macrophage cells obviously. When the cells were exposed to Co 2+, Cr 3+ ions, compared to the control group, the mRNA expression of RANK of the metal ions group was increased at 12 hours (P > 0.05), reached its peak level at 24 hours (P > 0.05), and decreased at 48 hours than that of 24 hours (P > 0.05). The results revealed that metal ions have a cytotoxic effect on monocyte-macrophage cells, stimulate the expression of RANK, and have the potential of facilitating monocyte-macrophages cells transform into osteoclast-like cells.",

All animals were sacrificed and tissue specimens were harvested 7 days after treatment. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot were applied to observe inflammatory reaction and detect the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) in mRNA and protein levels in air-pouch membrances. The results showed that wear particles could stimulate aseptic inflammation in vivo effectively; 0.9 \u03bcmol LaCl3 could significantly inhibit wear particle-induced gene and protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-\u03baB (P>0.05); 0.1 and 8.1 \u03bcmol LaCl3 did not exert an inflammation-inhibiting effect and even caused adverse effects at 8.1 \u03bcmol. In conclusion, LaCl3 played a protective role against wear particle-induced aseptic inflammation dose-dependently, which was involved in NF-\u03baB related signaling pathways. \u00a9 2013 The Chinese Society of Rare Earths.",

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been recognized as promising delivery vehicles for gene therapy of tumors. Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of worldwide cancer mortality, and novel treatment modalities are urgently needed. NK4 is an antagonist of hepatocyte growth factor receptors (Met) which are often aberrantly activated in gastric cancer and thus represent a useful candidate for targeted therapies. This study investigated MSC-delivered NK4 gene therapy in nude mice bearing gastric cancer xenografts. MSCs were transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying NK4 complementary DNA or enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP). Such transduction did not change the phenotype of MSCs. Gastric cancer xenografts were established in BALB/C nude mice, and the mice were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), MSCs-GFP, Lenti-NK4, or MSCs-NK4. The tropism of MSCs toward gastric cancer cells was determined by an in vitro migration assay using MKN45 cells, GES-1 cells and human fibroblasts and their presence in tumor xenografts. Tumor growth, tumor cell apoptosis and intratumoral microvessel density of tumor tissue were measured in nude mice bearing gastric cancer xenografts treated with PBS, MSCs-GFP, Lenti-NK4, or MSCs-NK4 via tail vein injection. The results showed that MSCs migrated preferably to gastric cancer cells in vitro. Systemic MSCs-NK4 injection significantly suppressed the growth of gastric cancer xenografts. MSCs-NK4 migrated and accumulated in tumor tissues after systemic injection. The microvessel density of tumor xenografts was decreased, and tumor cellular apoptosis was significantly induced in the mice treated with MSCs-NK4 compared to control mice. These findings demonstrate that MSC-based NK4 gene therapy can obviously inhibit the growth of gastric cancer xenografts, and MSCs are a better vehicle for NK4 gene therapy than lentiviral vectors. Further studies are warranted to explore the efficacy and safety of the MSC-based NK4 gene therapy in animals and cancer patients.",

The NK4 gene was obtained from HGF cDNA by polymerase chain reaction(PCR), and the pGC-FU-NK4 plasmid was constructed by double restriction enzyme digestion and gene recombinant. The titer of virus was tested by real-time quantitative PCR. After transfected by lentivirus, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in hBMSCs was observed using fluorescence microscope, and the expression of NK4 in culture supernatant was detected by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The sequence of the PCR product was consistent with the data of GeneBank by DNA sequencing. The virus titer was 2 X 10(8)TU/ml. Strong green fluorescence was observed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm of hBMSCs with fluorescent microscopy. The expression of NK4 in culture supernatant was increased with time extension. The hBMSCs can be transfected by NK4 gene expressing lentiviral vector safely and effectively, and the expressin and secretion of NK4 was persistent and stable.",

        "abstract": "To compare the effectiveness between improved anterolateral approach and lateral approach in the treatment of senile intertrochanteric fracture.The clinical data were retrospectively analyzed, from 61 patients with senile intertrochanteric fracture treated between February 2008 and February 2010. Of 61 patients, 34 patients underwent improved anterolateral approach combined with fixation of dynamic hip screw (improved group), and 27 patients underwent conventional lateral approach combined with fixation of dynamic hip screw (conventional group). There was no significant difference in gender, age, injury cause, Evans classification, comorbidities, disease duration, or Harris hip scores between 2 groups (P > 0.05).The operation was successfully completed in all patients. The operation time, blood loss, perspective frequency during operation, drainage volume, hospitalization days, and out-of-bed time in the improved group were significantly less than those in the conventional group (P < 0.05). All patients were followed up 12-24 months (mean, 18.7 months). Bone union was achieved in both groups; the fracture healing time was (11.64 +/- 1.28) weeks in the improved group and was (12.29 +/- 1.12) weeks in the conventional group, showing no significant difference (t = 2.15, P = 0.15). Harris hip scores at 3, 6, and 12 months were significantly better than preoperative scores in 2 groups (P < 0.05), and significant differences were found among different time points after operation in 2 groups (P < 0.05), between 2 groups after operation (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of incision infection, limb shortening, coax vara, internal fixation loosening, main screw cutting-out from femoral head between 2 groups (P > 0.05), but the incidence of total complications in the improved group was significantly lower than that in the conventional group (P < 0.05).Compared with conventional lateral approach, improved anterolateral approach has the advantages of sufficient exposure, reducing muscle damage and surgical risk in treating intertrochanteric fracture. Operating treatment of improved anterolateral approach combined with early rehabilitation after surgery can recover hip joint function as quickly as possible.",

Therefore, identifying genes that control wool growth cycling might lead to ways for improving the quality and yield of fine wool. In this study, we employed Agilent sheep gene expression microarray and proteomic technology to compare the gene expression patterns of the body side skins at August and December time points in Aohan fine wool sheep (a Chinese indigenous breed). Microarray study revealed that 2,223 transcripts were differentially expressed, including 1,162 up-regulated and 1,061 down-regulated transcripts, comparing body side skin at the August time point to the December one (A/D) in Aohan fine wool sheep. Then seven differentially expressed genes were selected to validated the reliability of the gene chip data. The majority of the genes possibly related to follicle development and wool growth could be assigned into the categories including regulation of receptor binding, extracellular region, protein binding and extracellular space. Proteomic study revealed that 84 protein spots showed significant differences in expression levels. Of the 84, 63 protein spots were upregulated and 21 were downregulated in A/D. Finally, 55 protein points were determined through MALDI-TOF/MS analyses. Furthermore, the regulation mechanism of hair follicle might resemble that of fetation.",

        "abstract": "Osteopontin (osteopontin, OPN) which is a secreted glycosylated phosphoprotein plays an important role mediated bone tissue and bone matrix during the connection process. For the purpose of enhancing the genetic progress and providing theoretical basis for marker-assisted selection (MAS) of production traits of milk goat, this research detected the osteopontin(OPN) gene polymorphisms of lactating ewe of milk goat(Capra hircus) in Laoshan by adopting the DNA pooling technology and high resolution melting curve analysis technology and analysed the association effect with milk and growth traits by adopting the generalized least squares. Two SNPs were detected among the 174 samples, one of which was the C/T represented by C/T which located at locus I355 of the fifth intron and the other was C/T represented by M/N which located at locus E341 of the seventh exon, whose polymorphism information content (PIC) were 0.2773 and 0.3267, respectively. The distribution of their allele and gene frequency was uneven in breeding farm (F) and breeding peasant (P), namely the Group P of locus I355 deviated from the equilibrium state of Hardy-Weinberg (P<0.05) and the rest was in the equilibrium state (P>0.05). During the analysis of association with lactation traits, the phenotypic values of all traits of Group P were extremely significantly (P<0.01) above those of Group F except for the conductance trait; as for the locus I355, the individual of genotype CC was significantly (P<0.05) above that of genotypes CT and TT in fat content. The traits of ash content and freezing point of genotype CC were significantly (P<0.05) above those of genotype CT. The allele N at locus E341 was the favorable allele of six traits such as non-fat material, lactose rate, milk density, milk protein rate, freezing point and ash content, and the difference of all traits was insignificant (P>0.05). During the analysis of association with growth traits, the body weight and body length of Group F were extremely significantly (P<0.01) above that of Group P; the rump width and rump length of Group P were extremely significantly (P<0.01) above that of Group F. As for the locus I355, the individual of genotype TT was extremely significantly (P<0.01) above that of genotype CC in body weight. As for the locus E341, the allele M was the favorable allele of the body height and bust; the individual of genotypes MM and MN was extremely significantly (P<0.01) above that of genotype NN in weight and rump width; the individual of genotype MM was extremely significantly (P<0.01) above that of genotype NN in the body length; the individual of genotype MM was significantly (P<0.05) above that of genotype NN in height and bust. Through this research, it is found that the OPN gene mutation locus I355 is related to the fat and carbohydrate contents in milk and the mutation locus E341 has significant association effect with the growth and development traits of milk goat, which therefore can be adopted for the molecular genetic markers of some growth traits of milk goat.",

In this study, we employed Agilent sheep gene expression microarray and proteomic technology to compare the gene expression patterns of the body side (hair-rich) and groin (hairless) skins of Aohan fine wool sheep (a Chinese indigenous breed).Comparing the body side to the groin skins (S/G) of Aohan fine wool sheep, the microarray study revealed that 1494 probes were differentially expressed, including 602 more highly expressed and 892 less highly expressed probes. The microarray results were verified by means of quantitative PCR. Cluster analysis could distinguish the body side skin and the groin skin. Based on the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), 38 of the differentially expressed genes were classified into four categories, namely regulation of receptor binding, multicellular organismal process, protein binding and macromolecular complex. Proteomic study revealed that 187 protein spots showed significant (p < 0.05) differences in their respective expression levels. Among them, 46 protein entries were further identified by MALDI-TOF/MS analyses.Microarray analysis revealed thousands of differentially expressed genes, many of which were possibly associated with wool growth. Several potential gene families might participate in hair growth regulation. Proteomic analysis also indentified hundreds of differentially expressed proteins.",

        "abstract": "Goats are an important source of fibers. In the present study microarray technology was used to investigate the potential genes primarily involved in hair and cashmere growth in the Laiwu black goat. A total of 655 genes differentially expressed in body (hair\u2011growing) and groin (hairless) skin were identified, and their potential association with hair and cashmere growth was analyzed. The majority of genes associated with hair growth regulation could be assigned to intracellular, intracellular organelle, membrane\u2011bound vesicle, cytoplasmic vesicle, pattern binding, heparin binding, polysaccharide binding, glycosaminoglycan binding and cytoplasmic membrane\u2011bound vesicle categories. Numerous genes upregulated in body compared with groin skin contained common motifs for nuclear factor 1A, Yi, E2 factor (E2F) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding (CREB)/CREB\u03b2 binding sites in their promoter region. The promoter region of certain genes downregulated in body compared with groin skin contained three common regions with LF\u2011A1, Yi, E2F, Collier/Olfactory\u20111/early B\u2011cell factor\u00a01, peroxisome proliferator\u2011activated receptor \u03b1 or U sites.

Before segmentation of the image, a step of cornea orientation based on blue color histogram was added, greatly improving image process speed. A color clustering method was used to segment the slit-lamp micrograph. A new method to remove noise besides big object was given. Cubic splines interpolation was used to get smooth corneal surface. Based on the symmetrical feature of corneal surface, a 3D model for the ID-image sequence registration was designed. The cornea auto reconstruction was realized. The reconstruction speed is very fast and needs no interaction during the process.",

        "abstract": "Accurate extraction of the vasculature in medical images is prerequisite to structural analysis and further applications such as surgical planning.Region growing algorithm is a simple and effective method to extract thick blood vessels which makes use of the spatial continuity of the vascular tree,while the extraction result of small vessels like hepatic artery is unacceptable.In order to solve the problem that the continuity of tenuous vasculature is poor in medical images and vessel segmentation based on traditional region growing may lose distal branches,a directional region growing(DRG) algorithm is proposed which can skip the low gray area in the vasculature during the growing process.The algorithm grows towards the direction of the maximum gray around the grown region,and adds one voxel to the grown region in each iteration.The image is transformed into a tree after the growing process in which the seed point is the root.A trace back procedure beginning from the leaf nodes of the tree can finally determine the region of interest(ROI).The algorithm relaxes the conditions to determine ROI,and small area with low gray in the ROI is permitted.There are two time-consuming steps in the algorithm due to the enormous amount of data in 3D medical images,one is to determine the growing direction in each iteration,the other is to construct the paths from the seed point to leaf nodes during the trace back procedure.Data structure to improve the speed of the algorithm is discussed.The algorithm can be applied to images with any dimension.The algorithm is tested with 2D and 3D images.In both conditions,the segmentation results obtained by DRG contain more distal branches in comparison with traditional region growing algorithm.To some vein phase CT images with poor quality,the proposed algorithm can also generate better results.Four parameters should be appointed in the algorithm and the empirical values are given.The computational time of the algorithm on 3D images is several seconds,which is acceptable in clinical applications.The surface of the extracted vasculature is rough due to the discrete nature of digital images,and further study is needed to smooth the surface before visualization.",

The concept of virtual volumetric spring was introduced for simulating volumetric information of the soft tissue first. Then a dynamic local subdivision method was given to improve the simulation precision, which is based on the modified butterfly subdivision algorithm and processed on two-stage offline and online. In the offline stage, the base mesh was subdivided into some level of detail meshes. On simulating the online stage, the local subdivision mesh was generated according to some criteria such as stress strength. The experiment results show that the presented method enhances indeed the sense of volume for soft tissue deformation in real time simulation. The computation cost of the local subdivision model is almost the same as the initial coarser model but performs higher computational precision.",

Methods 300 patients who had been clinically confirmed as cirrhosis in decompensation phase underwent scans ever six months using MSCT(3\uff5e5 mm) at hepatic arterial-phase (HAP) (20\uff5e25s), portal venous-phase (PVP()50\uff5e55s)and delayed-phase (DP) (2\uff5e3min)scanning. All patients that had been proved diseased by CT underwent DSA. Results 25 MHCC patients were detected in all the 300 patients, displaying iso- or slightly hypointensity on plain scan, hyperintensity on HAP, slightly hyperintensity, iso- or slightly hypointensity on PVP, iso- or hypointensity on DP. The sensitivity was 92.59%(25/27), 77.78%(21/27)and 88.89%(23/27)and 96.30%(26/ 27)for HAP, PVP, DP and overall MSCT , respectively. Sensitivity of DSA in detecting MHCC was 33.33%(9/27). Among 27 MHCC patients, 25 were confirmed by puncture biopsy or surgical pathology. 1 case had significantly increased AFP(409Hg/L). One patient developed massive type hepatic cancer. Conclusion MSCT can best detect MHCC at HAP and DP.",

Methods Thirty-five patients with non-calcified SPN(diameter\u226430mm) were studied with dynamic contrast enhanced CT. Patterns of time-density curve (T-DC) were assessed. The pre-contrast density, peak height in density (PH), the time of peak height(Tp), and the ratio of the PH of SPN over aorta (S/A) were measured. The perfusion of SPN were calculated. Results Malignant, benign, and inflammatory nodules showed quite different patterns of T-DC. PH and S/A ratio of malignant and inflammatory nodules were significant higher than those of the benign nodules(P<0.001;P< 0.001 ;x2 = 33.74, P < 0.001 ;x2= 16.01, P < 0.001), but no statistical difference of the PH or S/A ratio was found between the malignant and inflammatory nodules(P = 0.78,P = 0.51).Both malignant and inflammatory nodules showed significant higher perfu-sions than the benign nodules( P < 0.001, P < 0.01), while the difference of the perfusions between the malignant and inflammatory nodules was not significant (P = 0.39).

RNG k-\u03b5 model, EBU-Arrhenius turbulent combustion model and Six-flux radiation model are used for turbulent combustion. The particle trajectory model is applied to simulation two-phase flows. For verifying mathematical models and numerical methods, the Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) is employed to measure non-reacting and reacting flow fields and the multiple-point thermocouple probe is used to obtain the radial profiles of the exit gas temperature. Predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data. It is shown that the numerical procedures are reasonable and the present research may be used for guiding the improving design of advanced annular combustors.",

Influences of outer swirler on the flow field in the SACS combustor are significant when the vane angles of the three swirlers in the SACS are adjusted.

Results show that, with the increase of gap distance, heat transfer characteristics increase firstly, and then decrease. The change of gap distance caused different developments of impinging jet and pumping effects, and also led to different heat transfer effects. It shows that fluid particles move in translational mode in most region, but in rotating mode near effusion hole and impinging hole. The stronger fluid particle rotating causes better heat transfer effect.",

        "abstract": "Strategic complexity has become one of major strategies for Chinese enterprises in order to cope with complex and changing organizational environment.However,the existing literature on strategic complexity mostly discusses the result of strategic complexity but lack of studies on driving factors of strategic complexity.The paper analyzes the driving factors of strategic complexity from managers' cognitive perspective.In addition,domestic Chinese companies need to trace the source of strategic complexity from strategic thinking formation because strategy has very strong contextual dependence.This study uses local data collected from Chinese enterprises to discuss the formation of strategic complexity.Therefore,our findings can provide theoretical implications and practice guidance for researches on strategic complexity. Firstly,strategic complexity stems from managers' cognitive ability and the ability may be divided into two different types: perception and enactment.Based on cognition definition,this study suggests strategic complexity should be formed by two factors:perceived environmental uncertainty and strategic direction.Some hypotheses are proposed to assess the relationship between perceived environmental uncertainty and strategic complexity.A positive effect exists between perceived environmental uncertainty and strategic complexity(customer strategic complexity and competition strategic complexity).A negative effect exists between perceived environmental dynamics and strategic complexity(customer strategic complexity and competition strategic complexity).Other hypotheses are proposed to assess the relationship between strategic orientation and strategic complexity.We make four assumptions.The first assumption is that a negative effect exists between defender strategy and strategic complexity(customer strategic complexity and competition strategic complexity).The second assumption is that a positive effect exists between prospector strategy and strategic complexity(customer strategic complexity and competition strategic complexity).The third assumption is that a positive effect exists between analyzer strategy and strategic complexity(customer strategic complexity and competition strategic complexity).The fourth assumption is that a negative effect exists between reactor strategies and strategic complexity(customer strategic complexity and competition strategic complexity). Secondly,focusing on the relationship between strategic complexity and perceived environmental uncertainty or manager's strategic orientation,this study collects 897 surveys and 468 of them are valid.Data collected and analyzed from the survey shows some interesting results.A positive correlation exists between perceived environmental complexity and strategic complexity(customer strategic complexity and competition strategic complexity).A positive correlation exists between perceived environmental dynamic and competition strategic complexity.A negative correlation exists between defender strategy and customer strategic complexity.A positive correlation exists between prospector strategy and strategic complexity(customer strategic complexity and competition strategic complexity).A positive correlation exists between analytical strategies and strategic complexity(customer strategic complexity and competition strategic complexity).A negative correlation exists between reactor strategy and customer strategic complexity.The research provides important implications for improving strategic complexity of companies in the transitional Chinese economy.One important theoretical implication is to add our findings to the existing literature that strategic complexity contains many driving factors from a manger's cognitive perspective In addition,this paper offers a localized perspective for researches of this kind.In practice,Chinese enterprises must realize they need to improve managers' perception about environmental uncertainty and enact prospector's strategic orientation and analytical strategic orientation via \"courage\",\"cognitive complexity\",cognitive paradox integrating,and \"systematic integration\" actions if they want to gain competitive advantages.These driving factors have important implications for enterprises that are interested in forming complex cognitive framework(strategic complexity) to gain sustainable competitive advantage.",

In EAST, the 12-pulse midpoint converter was preferred, which was formed by two groups of 6-pulse converters in parallel directly. By analyzing the harmonic current of power system, the current sharing was important in EAST. The current sharing controller was designed to control the circulating current of the two groups.

        "abstract": "Low temperature printable carbon cathode based perovskite solar cell was for the first time interfacial engineered with dopant free, nanorod-liked copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) to facilitate charge transportation. Both the CuPc and low temperature processed carbon are potentially noble metal-free and highly stable. By incorporating CuPc nanorods as hole-selective contact material, together with the printable low temperature processed carbon as cathode material, considerably high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.1% was successfully obtained, which is comparable to or even a little higher than the device with state-of-the-art doped spiro-OMeTAD as HTM and noble metal Au as back electrode. Moreover, dramatically enhanced durability relative to doped-spiro-OMeTAD/Au based device was demonstrated by this newly developed device. Detailed excellent capability in accelerating charge extraction and suppressing charge recombination can be disclosed with steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. To the best our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency that has been reported for PSCs based carbon counter electrode. The work presented here demonstrates an important step forwards to practical applications for PSCs, as it paves the way for developments of cost-effective, stable but still highly efficient PSCs, and offers the promise for a low-cost, mass-manufacturable technology that is compatible with current large-scale printing infrastructure.",

Here, for the first time, two Ag-based metal organic complexes (HA1 and HA2) are employed as a new class of dopant-free hole-transport material for application in PSCs. These HTMs show excellent conductivity and hole-transport mobility. Consequently, the devices based on these two HTMs exhibit unusually high fill factors of 0.76 for HA1 and 0.78 for HA2, which are significantly higher than that obtained using spiro-OMeTAD (0.69). The cell based on HA1-HTM in its pristine form achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 11.98% under air conditions, which is comparable to the PCE of the cell employing the well-known doped spiro-MeOTAD (12.27%) under the same conditions. More importantly, their facile synthesis and purification without using column chromatography makes these new silver-based HTMs highly promising for future commercial applications of PSCs. These results provide a new way to develop more low-cost and high conductivity metal-complex based HTMs for efficient PSCs.",

Here, we report additive free ionic type HTMs that are based on 2-ethylhexyloxy substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) core unit. With the ionization of end-capping pyridine units, the hole mobility and conductivity of molecular materials are greatly improved. Applied in PSCs, ionic molecular material M7-TFSI exhibits the highest efficiency of 17.4% in the absence of additives [lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and 4-tert-butylpyridine]. The high efficiency is attributed to a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, high hole mobility and high conductivity of M7-TFSI. Moreover, due to the higher hydrophobicity of M7-TFSI, the corresponding PSCs showed better stability than that of Spiro-OMeTAD based ones. In addition, the strong absorption and suitable energy levels of materials (M6, M7-Br and M7-TFSI) also qualify them as donor materials in organic solar cells (OSCs) and the devices containing M7-TFSI as donor material displayed an efficiency of 6.9%.",

        "abstract": "Two novel low-cost fluorene-based hole transport materials (HTMs) HT1 and HT2 as alternatives to the expensive HTM Spiro-OMeTAD have been designed and synthesized for the application in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell (ssDSCs). The two HTMs were prepared through a facile two-step reaction from cheap starting material and with a total yield higher than 90%. These HTMs exhibit good solubility and charge-transport ability. PSCs based on HT2 achieved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.04% under air conditions, which is comparable to that of the cell employing the commonly used Spiro-OMeTAD (18.27%), while HT1-based cell showed a slightly worse performance with a PCE of 17.18%. For ssDSCs, the HT2-based device yielded a PCE of 6.35%, which is also comparable to that of a cell fabricated based on Spiro-OMeTAD (6.36%). We found that the larger dimensional structure and molecular weight of HT2 enable better photovoltaic performance than that of the smaller one HT1. These results show that easily synthesized fluorene-based HTMs have great potential to replace the expensive Spiro-OMeTAD for both PSCs and ssDSCs.",

BDT-C1 shows high hole mobility and high conductivity in its pristine form, in combination with appropriate energy level alignment with respect to [CH3NH3]PbI3 and PC70BM, qualifying the material as a good candidate for application both in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as dopant-free hole transport material (HTM) and in OSCs as donor material. The champion PSCs based on BDT-C1 show an average conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.4% (scan forward: 13.9%; scan backward: PCE=12.9%, scan rate: 10 mV/s). Although the average efficiency obtained is slightly lower than that of reference devices based on the well-known doped HTM Spiro-OMeTAD (13.7%), the BDT-C1 based devices exhibit better stability. Moreover, BDT-C1 as a donor material in OSCs also shows good performance in combination with PC70BM as acceptor material, and an efficiency of 6.1% was obtained. The present results demonstrate that BDT-C1 works well as both donor material in OSCs as well as dopant-free HTMs for efficient PSCs.",

In this work, a novel donor-acceptor (D-A) structured ETM termed TPA-3CN is presented by molecular engineering to include triphenylamine (TPA) as donor group and (3-Cyano-4,5,5-trimethyl-2(5H)-furanylidene) malononitrile as acceptor group. To further improve the electron mobility and conductivity and achieve excellent photovoltaic performance, a solution processable n-type dopant is introduced during ETM spin-coating step. After device optimization, PSCs based on the doped TPA-3CN exhibit impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.2% with negligible hysteresis. Benefitting from the low-temperature and good solution processability of ETM TPA-3CN, it was further applied in flexible inverted PSCs and achieved an impressive PCE of 13.2%, which is among the highest values reported for inverted flexible fullerene-free PSCs.",

Two A\u2013D\u2013A-structured hole transporting materials termed M3 and M4 were designed and synthesized. Applied as HTMs in PSCs, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 14.8% and 12.3% were obtained with M3 and M4, respectively. The HTMs M3 and M4 show competitive absorption, but do not contribute to photocurrent, resulting in low current density. This issue was solved by mixing the HTMs with PC70BM to form a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer and integrating this layer into the PSC as hole transport layer (HTL). Through careful interface optimization, the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/HTM:PC70BM integrated devices showed improved efficiencies of 16.2% and 15.0%, respectively.

        "abstract": "Abstract   The main of this work is to overcome the drawbacks of the traditional fullerene derivatives used as electron transport materials (ETMs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a new strategy to design non-fullerene ETMs is presented by molecular engineering to include charged moieties in the ETM. The designed ETM  FA   2+   -PDI2  is intrinsically ionic and the incorporated counter ions in  FA   2+   -PDI2  significantly increase the electron conductivity and improve the film formation properties. Through careful device optimization, PSCs based on the ionic ETM  FA   2+   -PDI2  exhibit an impressive average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.0%, which is comparable to the PSC based on PC 61 BM (17.5%). The superior photovoltaic performance can be attributed to efficient electron extraction and effective electron transfer in the PSCs. This work provides important insights regarding the future design of new and efficient non-fullerene ETMs for PSCs.",

        "abstract": "A low-cost spiro[fluorene-9,9\u2032-xanthene] (SFX) based organic hole transport material (HTM) termed X60 was designed and synthesized using a two-step synthetic route. Devices with X60 as HTM showed high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) amounting to 7.30% in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (ssDSCs) and 19.84% in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), under 100 mW cm\u22122 AM1.5G solar illumination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of an easily synthesized spiro-structured HTM that shows comparable performance with respect to the well-known HTM Spiro-OMeTAD in both ssDSCs and PSCs. Furthermore, the facile synthesis of X60 from commercially available starting materials makes this HTM very promising for large-scale industrial production in the future.",

BiPO/BiOI heterojunction is fabricated via a simple one-step solvothermal method with KI and ionic liquid 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium dihydrogen phosphate ([Omim]HPO). An enhanced photoelectrochemical separation efficiency is obtained due to the synergistic effect between the formation of BiPO/BiOI heterojunction and shortening the transmission path of the electron to the surface caused by BiPO nanocrystals. Owing to the outstanding photoelectrochemical response of BiPO/BiOI heterojunction to catechol, a photoelectrochemical sensor is constructed for monitoring catechol. The proposed sensor possesses reliable stability, anti-interference ability and a low detection limit with 2\u202fng\u202fmL. The linear range is from 6 to 1.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fng\u202fmL. Notably, this work not only supplies a facile method for BiPO nanocrystals based binary heterojunction, but also helps to understand the relationship between BiPO nanocrystals and photoelectrochemical performance of binary heterojunction. Convincingly, this strategy can be extended to other BiPO nanocrystals based heterojunction and photoelectrochemical sensor platform associated with photoactive materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The ever-increasing concerns about global environmental problems and depletion of fossil resources have stimulated intensive research on low-cost and high-performance energy storage materials. Here, we introduce the two-step sulfidation of hierarchical ferric-cobalt sulfide hollow nanoneedles on electrical conductive carbon fiber paper (CFP) for high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. Under the growth regulation of macroporous CFP substrate, prepared free-standing composite paper with tip-welded ferric-cobalt sulfide hollow nanoneedles can offer substantial exposed electroactive sites for Faradaic redox reaction and effectively buffer the drastic volume change during long-term charge-discharge, and also provide fast charge transfer paths through the carbon skeleton for efficient energy storage. Due to these unique features, obtained composite paper electrode delivers a higher specific capacitance (2282\u202fF\u202fg \u22121  at current density of 1\u202fA\u202fg \u22121 ) than those of the previously reported MCo 2 S 4  based electrodes. Asymmetric supercapacitor assembled using the composite paper as the binder-free positive electrode also shows a high energy density of 86.8\u202fWh kg \u22121  at a power density of 800\u202fW\u202fkg \u22121 , and an impressive 82.3% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles, demonstrating the great potential of this low-cost and free-standing electrodes towards high-performance energy storage.",

        "abstract": "The relatively low sensitivity, slow response and complicated or energy consuming preparation processes of NiO-based sensors greatly restrict their further application. In this work, monolayer Mg-doped NiO thin film was fabricated via an interfacial self-assemble strategy and a subsequent annealing process. Polystyrene spheres with diameters of about 700\u00a0nm were used as templates. The as-prepared monolayer Mg-doped NiO thin film presents a honeycomb structure. The film formation process and possible sensing mechanism of the honeycomb structured Mg-doped NiO thin film are also discussed. Moreover, the film-based gas sensor presents a high selectivity to ethanol gas against other gases. The response ratio of the Mg-doped NiO film sensor to 100\u00a0ppm ethanol is 10.4 at 325\u00a0\u00b0C. This ratio is also much better than some of the previously reported values in literatures. Furthermore, the Mg-doped NiO sensor also shows a significantly enhanced sensing properties in terms of higher selectivity, faster response and recovery time than our honeycomb structured pure NiO thin film. The remarkable properties may be attributed to the honeycomb structure and the Mg doping, which produce more active sites for the gas reaction and adsorption on the surface of the sensing materials. This facile fabrication strategy can be further utilized to prepare other monolayer metal oxide film-based devices.",

In this work, the macroporous CNF film served as flexible/conducting substrate not only promotes the homogeneous distribution of FeCo 2 S 4  hollow nanoneedles, but also enhance the electrical conductivity of the composite film. Especially, the tip-welded FeCo 2 S 4  nanoneedles with unique interior channels and perpendicular orientation possess numerous accessible electroactive sites and short electrolyte transfer paths for efficient energy storage, and also buffer the drastic volume change during the repetitive charge-discharge process. As a result, prepared FeCo 2 S 4  HNNA/CNF composite electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 2476\u202fF\u202fg \u22121 \u202fat 1\u202fA\u202fg \u22121 , and excellent capacitance retention of 93% after 5000 cycles, which is competitive among those previously reported ternary metal sulfide-based electrodes.

This paper presents a machine learning framework to assess the local quality of indoor mobile mapping point cloud data. In our proposed framework, a point cloud dataset with multiple kinds of quality problems is first created by manual annotation and degradation simulation. Then, feature extraction methods based on 3D patches are treated as operating units to conduct quality assessment in local regions. Also, a feature selection algorithm is deployed to obtain the essential components of feature sets that are used to effectively represent local degradation. Finally, a semi-supervised method is introduced to classify quality types of point clouds. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework obtained promising quality assessment results with limited labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. A point cloud dataset with multiple kinds of quality problems is created.The main causes of point cloud data degradation in indoor mobile mapping is analyzed.A novel semi-supervised framework is proposed for quality assessment of indoor mobile mapping point cloud data.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Very recently, vehicle detection in satellite images has become an emerging research topic with various applications ranging from military to commercial systems. However, it retains as an open problem, mainly due to the complex variations in imaging conditions, object intra-class changes, as well as due to its low-resolution. Coming with the rapid advances in deep learning for feature representation, in this paper we investigate the possibility to exploit deep neural features towards robust vehicle detection. In addition, along with the rapid growth in the data volume, new classification methodology is also demanded to explicitly handle the intra-class variations. In this paper, we propose a vehicle detection framework, which combines Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DNN) based feature learning with Exemplar-SVMs (E-SVMS) based, robust instance classifier to achieve robust vehicle detection in satellite images. In particular, we adopt DNN to learn discriminative image features, which has a high learning capacity. In our practice, the leverage of DNN has achieve significant performance boost by comparing to a serial of handcraft designed features. In addition, we adopt E-SVMs based robust classifier to further improve the classification robustness, which can be considered as an instance-specific metric learning scheme. By conducting extensive experiments with comparisons to a serial of state-of-the-art and alternative works, we further show that the combination of both schemes can benefit from each other to jointly improve the detection accuracy and effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "Geometric model fitting is a fundamental task in computer graphics and computer vision. However, most geometric model fitting methods are unable to fit an arbitrary geometric model (e.g. a surface with holes) to incomplete data, due to that the similarity metrics used in these methods are unable to measure the rigid partial similarity between arbitrary models. This paper hence proposes a novel rigid geometric similarity metric, which is able to measure both the full similarity and the partial similarity between arbitrary geometric models. The proposed metric enables us to perform partial procedural geometric model fitting (PPGMF). The task of PPGMF is to search a procedural geometric model space for the model rigidly similar to a query of non-complete point set. Models in the procedural model space are generated according to a set of parametric modeling rules. A typical query is a point cloud. PPGMF is very useful as it can be used to fit arbitrary geometric models to non-complete (incomplete, over-complete or hybrid-complete) point cloud data. For example, most laser scanning data is non-complete due to occlusion. Our PPGMF method uses Markov chain Monte Carlo technique to optimize the proposed similarity metric over the model space. To accelerate the optimization process, the method also employs a novel coarse-to-fine model dividing strategy to reject dissimilar models in advance. Our method has been demonstrated on a variety of geometric models and non-complete data. Experimental results show that the PPGMF method based on the proposed metric is able to fit non-complete data, while the method based on other metrics is unable. It is also shown that our method can be accelerated by several times via early rejection.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a learning-based road network extraction scheme from high resolution satellite. First, the convolutional neural network(CNN), which is able to capture large context of local structures, are applied to predict the probability of a pixel belonging to road regions, and assign labels to each pixel to describe whether it is road. Then, a line integral convolution based algorithm is developed to smooth the rough map to connect small gaps. Finally, by combining with some common image processing operators, road centerlines are able to be acquired. Attribute to the learning capacity of CNN, and the line integral convolution based connection scheme, the proposed road extraction method is able to provide high quality results comparing to current state-of-art road extraction methods.",

In this paper, we propose a new method for automatic coastline extraction in SAR images. In our method, we combine K-means and speckle noise removal methods together to increase the dissimilarity between sea and land. To enhance the robustness to speckle noise, and preserve the targets boundaries, we treat superpixels as basic regions instead of pixels in traditional pixel-based methods. Finally, an adaptive threshold is applied to classify these regions into sea or land. Based on the classifications, a canny detector is employed to detect the coastline. We evaluate our proposed method on SAR images and the improved coastline extraction method superpixel-based is verified on remote sensing images with RGB channels. The experimental results demonstrate its superior performance on coastline extraction.",

        "abstract": "For survey and maintenance of traffic signs, this paper presents a novel traffic sign occlusion detection method using 3-D point clouds and trajectory data acquired by a mobile laser scanning system. To produce a maintenance guide, our method aims to obtain the degree of occlusion by analyzing the spatial relationship between traffic signs, surroundings, and drivers on the road. First, a detection method considering both reflectance and geometric features is developed to capture traffic signs. Next, to simulate the driver\u2019s view, a trajectory-based method is proposed to determine driver\u2019s observation location and the corresponding observed traffic sign. Finally, to determine whether a traffic sign is in occlusion, a hidden point removal algorithm is adopted and carried out. Furthermore, we develop two indices to evaluate the degree of occlusion. The proposed method is tested using two point cloud data sets collected by an RIEGL VMX-450 system along a 23.68-km-long urban road. The obtained results illustrate the feasibility of the proposed occlusion detection method.",

This letter proposes a new voxel-based deep learning method to classify tree species in 3-D point clouds collected from complex forest scenes.

Two data sets of 3-D forest point clouds acquired by terrestrial laser scanning systems are used to evaluate the proposed method. The method achieves an average classification accuracy of 93.1% and 95.6% on the two data sets. Furthermore, in comparative experiments, the proposed method exhibits performance superior to that of the other 3-D tree species classification methods.",

In this regard, the data for a real-world scene acquired by ground-based laser scanners are comprehensive and convenient, thus potentially meeting this requirement. To get an accurate result and offer an automatic solution for sunlight analysis, this paper proposes a solar potential analysis method that is run directly on 3-D ground laser scanning point clouds. Our method simulates natural illumination, sunlight hours, and solar radiation of the targeted scene for a specified period. This method first extracts the region of interest (ROI) to obtain targeted points. Then, we compute solar position as a virtual light source and propose a control method acting on the ROI to constraint deviation from the point light source. Finally, we adopt the generalized hidden point removal algorithm to cast shadow of obstruction on the ROI. Besides, experiments to validate the shading method results are carried out for three different periods. The quantitative results in the Xiamen case evaluated by the Hausdorff distance demonstrate the advantage and feasibility of our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "In order to perform precise identification and location of artificial coded targets in natural scenes, a novel design of circle-based coded target and the corresponding coarse-fine extraction algorithm are presented. The designed target separates the target box and coding box totally and owns an advantage of rotation invariance. Based on the original target, templates are prepared by three geometric transformations and are used as the input of shape-based template matching. Finally, region growing and parity check methods are used to extract the coded targets as final results. No human involvement is required except for the preparation of templates and adjustment of thresholds in the beginning, which is conducive to the automation of close-range photogrammetry. The experimental results show that the proposed recognition method for the designed coded target is robust and accurate.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   It is challenging to automatically register TLS point clouds with noise, outliers and varying overlap. In this paper, we propose a new method for pairwise registration of TLS point clouds. We first generate covariance matrix descriptors with an adaptive neighborhood size from point clouds to find candidate correspondences, we then construct a non-cooperative game to isolate mutual compatible correspondences, which are considered as true positives. The method was tested on three models acquired by two different TLS systems. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed adaptive covariance (ACOV) descriptor is invariant to rigid transformation and robust to noise and varying resolutions. The average registration errors achieved on three models are 0.46\u202fcm, 0.32\u202fcm and 1.73\u202fcm, respectively. The computational times cost on these models are about 288\u202fs, 184\u202fs and 903\u202fs, respectively. Besides, our registration framework using ACOV descriptors and a game theoretic method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both registration error and computational time. The experiment on a large outdoor scene further demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed pairwise registration framework.",

        "abstract": "This study aims at building a robust method for semiautomated information extraction of pavement markings detected from mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds. The proposed workflow consists of three components: 1) preprocessing, 2) extraction, and 3) classification. In preprocessing, the three-dimensional (3-D) MLS point clouds are converted into radiometrically corrected and enhanced two-dimensional (2-D) intensity imagery of the road surface. Then, the pavement markings are automatically extracted with the intensity using a set of algorithms, including Otsuu0027s thresholding, neighbor-counting filtering, and region growing. Finally, the extracted pavement markings are classified with the geometric parameters by using a manually defined decision tree. A study was conducted by using the MLS dataset acquired in Xiamen, Fujian, China. The results demonstrated that the proposed workflow and method can achieve 92% in completeness, 95% in correctness, and 94% in  F -score.",

        "abstract": "Traffic accident is considered as one of main causes for traffic congestion in cities. There are many causal factors that may give rise to traffic accidents, e.g. driver characteristics, road conditions, traffic flows and weather conditions, etc. Due to uncertain factors as well as the contingency of accident occurrences, it is very difficult to predict traffic accidents. Many existing works have utilized classical prediction models to predict the risk of accidents on highways or road segments. However, predicting the risk of citywide accidents remains an open issue. To address this problem, we propose SDCAE, a novel Stack Denoise Convolutional Auto-Encoder algorithm to predict the risk of traffic accident in the city-level. First, we divided the city into regions by counting the number of accidents and traffic flows in each region. Second, we employed a deep model of stack denoise convolutional autoencoder which considers spatial dependencies to learn the hidden factors in accidents. Third, we conducted extensive experiments on two real-world cross-domain traffic big datasets from a major city of China for accident risk prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCAE could outperforms five baseline methods.",

        "abstract": "The development of smart and targeted drug delivery systems has promising potential to revolutionize cancer chemotherapy. Herein, supramolecular polymersomes were constructed using biocompatible water-soluble pillar[5]arene (WP5) and cationic poly(glutamamide)s (polymer 1) with good biodegradability. Based on the host\u2013guest complexation between WP5 and butyl-ammonium groups on polymer 1, stable supramolecular macromolecular amphiphiles were obtained, which could self-assemble into supramolecular polymersomes. Furthermore, the generated polymersomes were able to encapsulate the hydrophilic anticancer drug mitoxantrone (MTZ) to achieve MTZ-loaded polymersomes. Importantly, decorated with biotin ligands on the surface, these polymersomes exhibited good targeting ability to deliver MTZ specifically to biotin receptor-positive cancer cells. After internalization into cancer cells, the loaded MTZ was released efficiently triggered by the acidic environment-induced polymersome disassembly. Moreover, MTZ-loaded polymersomes with targeting ligands on their surface could not only enhance the anticancer efficiency of MTZ but also effectively reduce the undesirable side effects on normal cells. The present work provides a novel strategy for the construction of smart supramolecular polymersomes, which may hold potential biomedical applications in targeted drug delivery.",

The host polymer formed micelles in water at 25 \u00b0C, and upon addition of guest mPEG-Fc, a hydrophilic supramolecular diblock copolymer PNIPAM-P[6] \u2283 mPEG-Fc was formed, which could become amphiphilic when heated to 37 \u00b0C and further self-assembled into supramolecular polymeric vesicles. The resulting vesicles exhibited good thermo- and oxidation-responsiveness, due to the solubility of the host polymer at different temperatures and the oxidation of the ferrocene moiety of the guest polymer, respectively. More importantly, the supramolecular polymeric vesicles could be further applied in the encapsulation of an anticancer drug (doxorubicin hydrochloride) and its controlled release in response to temperature and oxidizing agents.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   NOx emission of coke combustion in iron ore sintering was modeled by overall reaction rate equations of NOx formation and reduction. Incorporating into a previous sintering heat treatment model, overall NOx emission can be predicted and the simulated results were well agreed with four sinter pot tests under varying conditions which are similar to actual production. In sintering, NOx emission is significantly related to fuel combustion. Due to heat input by ignition and smaller airflow in the initial stage of sintering, the predicted NOx emission has a higher value of about 350\u00a0ppm first then it decreases a little and keeps at a relatively constant level of about 300\u00a0ppm until the burn-through point, and decreases rapidly as a result of the accomplishment of coke combustion. Simulation results indicate that fuel NOx is the main NOx emission in sintering while thermal NOx is rarely produced since the bed temperature is much lower than 1800\u00a0K. The generated NOx could be reduced not only on the surface and in the pores of coke but also by CO around coke particles, about 50% and 10% of the generated NOx could be reduced by char and CO, respectively. Increasing coke rate and decreasing coke size promote NOx generation by accelerating the coke combustion. The reduction extent by char is greatly influenced by contact between NOx and char while the reduction extent by CO is mainly determined by the combustion atmosphere.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores NOx emission during iron ore sintering on a pilot-scale pot. A novel technique of using a three-layered bed structure was adopted to study the role of coke level, properties and combustion behavior on NOx emission. In addition, the lime content of the mix was also altered to understand the effect of the melt formation process. Thirteen sinter pot tests were employed to analyze the influence of coke combustion on NOx emission. As the flame front descended down the pot, NOx emission decreased because of increasing bed temperatures. For this reason, it is to be expected that increasing coke rate will result in higher sinter bed temperature and lower conversion of coke-N to NOx. However, overall NOx emission is little changed because more coke means higher N availability. Increasing basicity (CaO/SiO2) from 1.9 to 2.4 in raw mix results in the decrease of NOx emission, about 5%. Increasing coke size may result in the decrease or increase of NOx emission. Placing coke particles on the outsi...",

Porous structures of the sampled sinter cakes were reconstructed by X-ray microtomography and CFD simulations were applied based on the real geometry. The pressure drop of serial subzones along the sinter bed including sintered zone, high-temperature zone and humidified zone were discussed by analyzing the experimental measured airflow rate and CFD simulation results together. The results show that sinter cake porosity increases from 0.48 at 6.3\u00a0wt% H 2 O to 0.59 at 7.3\u00a0wt% H 2 O. The reconstructed sinter cakes show various complex porous structures, resulting in remarkable flow heterogeneity and complicated velocity field. A high porosity bed has many more gas channels and the flow distribution is developed better. The pressure drop in sintered zone is \u223c1.5\u00a0kPa/m, which is much lower compared to the high-temperature zone and humidified zone. The high-temperature zone where main reactions and bed structure changes happen has a controlling effect on the pressure drop across the sinter bed. The sintering bed permeability greatly determines the final productivity, which is affected by the bed temperature profile and bed porous structure.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Thoroughly understanding of the thermophysical properties of porous sinter is especially important for operation optimization and energy saving in integrated steel mills. Under this prospect, nondestructive X-ray microtomography was applied to characterize the pore structure and following simulations for estimating the sinter effective thermal conductivity were performed. Three sinter cakes produced from pilot-scale sinter pot tests under three granulation moisture levels were scanned with resolution ratio of 42\u00a0\u00b5m. The reconstructed sinter cakes have various complex pore distributions, leading to remarkable anisotropic thermal conductivities and complicated temperature field. The pores smaller than 300\u00a0\u00b5m dominate the number frequency in sinter cake, while a small amount of pores larger than 1\u00a0mm account for \u223c94% of the total pore volume, which determine the thermal behavior greatly. The estimated effective thermal conductivities of three samples are 0.847, 0.865, 0.558\u00a0W/m\u00a0K, corresponding to the porosity of 48.1%, 49.1% and 59.4% respectively. Comparing these values with values of similar iron agglomerates in the literature, some empirical correlations and analytical models, the results proved that CT-simulation is a valid approach for capturing the peculiar details of the real sinter porous structure, thus to predict thermal behavior with higher accuracy than the simplified geometric models.",

Results agree with those obtained by other researchers using embedded thermocouples and also predictions from a numerical sintering model well. When flame front moves forward, combustion zone duration time (DTCZ) and thickness increases. DTCZ increases from 1.65 min at the top interface to 1.80 min at the bottom interface. Combustion zone thickness is closely related with flame front speed. Melt in the iron ore sintering process has a large influence on flame front parameters, which affects oxygen diffusion on the coke surface, sinter bed permeability, and the heat transfer. Coke combustion rate is closely related with flame front speed and single coke particle burn-out time.",

As the fine particles adhere to the coarse coke particles, the NO x  emission generated from coke combustion may be expected to be influenced by that adhering layer. In this study, the granule size distributions and adhering ratios were evaluated by a granulation model. Granulation experiments were also carried out to obtain the granule size distribution and adhering ratio. The influence of the adhering layer on NO x  emissions from the combustion of S type granules was studied by tube furnace experiments. Conclusions include: (1) The adhering ratio predicted from the granulation model can be used as a qualitative index for the evaluation of NO x  emission from coke combustion. (2) The influence of the adhering layer on NO x  emissions was enhanced with increasing adhering layer thickness of S type granules, and the NO x  reduction was enhanced at higher temperatures (around 1373 K), but weakened at lower temperatures (around 1173 K).",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Flue gas recirculation sintering process is a potential technology to decrease fuel consumption and NOx emissions compared with conventional sintering process. In present work, a vertical quartz tube reactor was used to investigate the combustion characteristics and conversion of fuel-N to NOx of quasi-particle. The mass conversion rate of quasi-particle increases with higher temperature. It was found that D 1  model is more appropriate than other models to describe quasi-particle combustion process through comparing correlation coefficients calculated by different mechanism models. Effects of temperature, coke size and proportion, circulating flue gas components on the conversion of fuel-N to NOx of quasi-particle were studied. The conversion rate of fuel-N to NOx of quasi-particle increases with higher temperature. With increasing coke size and proportion, the conversion rate of fuel-N to NOx decreases obviously. O 2  has a positive impact on the conversion of fuel-N to NOx of quasi-particle. CO could decrease the conversion rate of fuel-N to NOx by reducing NO directly or reacting with char to decrease NOx indirectly. CO 2  has an obviously inhibitory effect on the conversion of fuel-N to NOx of quasi-particle because it reacts with char to generate CO. The results were conducive to further understanding the combustion behavior and NOx formation mechanism of quasi-particle during flue gas recirculation sintering.",

At the same time, there are other sintering parameters which can also affect the NOx emission, such as water content, limestone particle size, MgO content and return fines content. This work focuses on the influence of these parameters on the NOx emission in sintering process by pilot scale tests. 14 experiments were designed for testing the influence of these parameters at different locations of the sinter bed. Three layer sintering method was used and the NOx emission from different layers was measured. These parameters influence the granule properties, permeability of the sintering bed, and calcium ferrites formation and distribution, and then influence the NOx emission. The return fine content has the greatest impact. The conversion ratio of char nitrogen to NOx increased by about 7%, when the return fine content increased from 10% to 30% in the middle layer, and the conversion ratio of the upper and lower layers increased by about 3% and 11%, respectively. The permeability of the middle layer would influence NOx emission from lower layer.",

Thus, the development of a gas sensor with high response and low detection limit for NO detection is highly important. The highly ordered mesoporous indium trioxide (InO) prepared by simple nanocasting method using mesoporous silica as template and decorated with Au nanoparticles was investigated for NO detection. The prepared materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Characterization results showed that the samples exhibited ordered mesostructure and were successfully decorated with Au. The gas sensing performance of the sensors based on a series of Au-loaded mesoporous InO were systematically investigated. The Au loading level strongly affected the sensing performance toward NO. The optimal sensor, which was based on 0.5\u202fwt% Au-loaded InO, displayed high sensor response and low detection limit of 10\u202fppb at low operating temperature of 65\u202f\u00b0C. The excellent sensing properties were mainly attributed to the ordered mesoporous structure and the catalytic performance of Au. We believe that the Au-loaded mesoporous InO can provide a promising platform for NO gas sensors with excellent performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The porous flake-like Co 3 O 4  and Co 3 O 4 /graphene hybrids with different graphene contents were prepared through a facile two-step method. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations proved the tight adherence of graphene sheets to the surface of porous Co 3 O 4  slices. Gas sensors based on the as-synthesized products were then fabricated to explore their potential applications. The results indicated that the optimal hybrid exhibited a response of 26.8% to 5\u202fppm of NO 2  at room temperature (RT), which was 2.27 times higher than that of undoped Co 3 O 4  (100\u202f\u00b0C). The hybrid sensor also showed fast response, excellent selectivity, long-term stability and extremely low detection limit toward NO 2  at RT. The significantly enhanced sensing properties to NO 2  could be attributed to larger specific surface area, more chemisorbed oxygen species and the coupling effect between Co 3 O 4  and graphene in the hybrid. As we all know, as a typical p-type semiconductor, the gas-sensing properties of Co 3 O 4  toward oxidizing gases including NO 2  was rarely reported. We believe that our work could pave the way for the future design of Co 3 O 4 -based gas sensors for oxidizing gases detection at low or even room temperature.",

In addition, the C-dots also exhibited temperature- and pH-sensitive properties, possessing good temperature recoverability and significantly enhanced fluorescence under alkaline conditions.

        "abstract": "Abstract   A novel graphene-encapsulated \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3  hybrid was synthesized through the first hydrolysis process of Fe 3+  ions in the colloidal solution of graphene oxide (GO) and following hydrothermal procedure. The energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) data proved the existence and uniform distribution of C element in the hybrid. We further demonstrated the successful encapsulation of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3  grains by extremely small graphene pieces through transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As a proof-of-concept demonstration of the function, the as-prepared samples were utilized as gas-sensing materials to explore their potential applications. Results showed that the optimal hybrid exhibited a response of 8.2\u20135\u202fppm of NO 2  at room temperature (RT), which was 3.9 times higher than that of undoped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3  (125\u202f\u00b0C). The hybrid sensor also displayed a short response time of 2.1\u202fmin, an excellent NO 2  selectivity, a long-term stability of 20\u202fdays and an extremely low detection limit of 50\u202fppb toward NO 2  at RT. The significantly enhanced NO 2  sensing properties could be attributed to much higher specific surface area, more defects and local p-n heterojunctions in the hybrid. We consider that our work could provide a fresh idea for the future design of high-performance room temperature gas sensors.",

This paper presents a \u201cturn-on\u201d fluorescent biosensor based on molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) nanosheets and fluorophore labeled protein aptamer for rapid and sensitive detection of CEA protein. CEA aptamer probe can be adsorbed on the surface of MoS 2  nanosheets in close proximity via van der Waals force, triggering fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and consequently fluorescence signal of aptamer probe was quenched. While in the presence of CEA protein, the fluorescence signal was recovered because aptamer probe could detach from MoS 2  nanosheets with binding-induce conformation change. MoS 2  nanosheets with high quenching efficiency combined with well discrimination ability between aptamer and aptamer/protein afforded the biosensor easy construction, fast detection and high sensitivity. The sensing platform also exhibited good reproducibility, selectivity and showed high sensitivity for CEA protein in a broad range of 100\u202fpg/mL\u2013100\u202fng/mL with the detection limit of 34\u202fpg/mL. The aptamer-MoS 2  based fluorescent biosensor may be an ideal mode for protein detection in clinical sample, pesticide detection and environmental monitoring.",

The pseudo-potential model proposed by Shan and Chen [1] is used to simulate the two-phase flow, and the solid particle model proposed by Niu [2] is modified to account for adhesive forces between the particle and drop. The hybrid method is evaluated using several test cases of the binary drop collision, sedimentation of solid particles in a viscous fluid and a lid-driven cavity flow with particles and drops. Comparison with results obtained by other numerical methods and experiments shows that the present method has good stability, simplicity and adaptability to simulating the complex liquid\u2013gas\u2013particle flow systems.",

To study the distribution of extractable organic matter (EOM) in the Zhangjiatan Shale (Ro ranges from 1.25% to 1.28%), geochemical characterization of core samples of different lithologies, scanning electron microscope observations, low-pressure N2 and CO2 adsorption, and helium pycnometry were conducted. The content and saturation of the EOM in the pores were quantitatively characterized. The results show that the distribution of the EOM in the shale interval is heterogeneous. In general, the shale layers have a higher EOM content and saturation than siltstone layers. The total organic content and the original storage capacity control the EOM content in the shale layers. For the siltstone layers, the EOM content is mainly determined by the original storage capacity. On average, 75% of the EOM occurs in the mesopores, followed by 14% in the macropores, and 11% in the micropores. The EOM ...",

We adopted ant tracking technology for 3D poststack reflective seismic waves to identify the size and distribution of high-angle structural fractures in the Zhangjiatan shale of the Yanchang Formation in the Ordos Basin, which is a typical continental shale. The parameters for ant tracking fractures are extracted from the investigation on outcrop, cores, and image logs. The prestack seismic diffractive wave imaging technique for the super-resolution identification of mid- and small-scale breakpoints can be used as the constraint conditions for ant tracking. The identified result of high-angle fractures was validated by the image logging and drilling gas logging results.

        "title": "Calibration of the mudrock compaction curve by eliminating the effect of organic matter in organic-rich shales: Application to the southern Ordos Basin, China",
        "abstract": "Abstract   The mudrock log-derived compaction curve is a significant tool for investigating the primary migration of hydrocarbon, predicting fluid overpressure, estimating formation erosion thicknesses and restoring the buried history and paleo-structure of a basin. However, the presence of kerogen in organic-rich shales can create typically high logging values of the acoustic transit time. Thus, the abnormally high values of the acoustic transit time for organic-rich rocks may not truly reflect the porosity variations of subsurface rocks, leading to great uncertainties in the understanding of the mudstone compaction and a certain amount of error in the abnormal fluid pressure estimation when using the mudrock log-derived compaction curve. Therefore, it is necessary to recalibrate the mudstone compaction curve by eliminating the increment of the acoustic transit time caused by the kerogen content of organic-rich mudstones. Taking the southwest Ordos Basin as an example, this paper presents a new equivalent volume model based on the composition of organic-rich shale in which the kerogen content is also considered. Based on the quantitative relationship between the rock composition and the acoustic transit time, a quantitative formula for calculating the acoustic transit time increment caused by the kerogen is derived. This formula shows that the increment depends not only on the organic content but also on the occurrence state, pore size, pore fluid composition and other factors. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were used to determine the main mineral composition of the mudstone and to calculate the acoustic transit time of the rock skeleton. Then, the mudstone compaction curve in the Zhenjing area was calibrated by combining the measured porosity and total organic carbon (TOC) of the mudstone based on the correction formula. The compaction characteristics varied significantly between before and after the calibration. The slope of the normal compaction trend (NCT) line decreased by 30\u201355%, and the acoustic transit time deviation from the NCT in the undercompaction interval decreased significantly. The overpressure at the maximum burial depth estimated by the equivalent depth method is in better agreement with the results obtained by numerical simulation after the calibration, and the porosity determined from the well log after the calibration is also closer to the true measured value. The method proposed in this paper is of great significance for improving the reliability and accuracy of compaction research on organic-rich mudstones, especially for the accurate estimation of abnormal pressure in the source rock layer. Additionally, it can be used as an effective reference for mudstone compaction studies in similar geological settings areas or basins.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Amounts of silty laminae in continental shale gas reservoir were investigated in the Zhangjiatan shale of the Yanchang Formation, Ordos Basin. The purpose of this study is to provide awareness in terms of the nature and discrepancies in pore structure between silty laminae and clayey laminae. By mechanically separating the silty laminae from the shale core, a combination measurement series of mercury injection capillary pressure, N 2  adsorption, and carbon dioxide adsorption were performed on the aforementioned two parts. An integrated pore size distribution, with a pore diameter range of 0.1\u00a0nm-100\u00a0\u03bcm, was obtained by using appropriate sample particle size and calculation model. The comparative analysis of the pore structure shows that the clayey laminae are dominated by mesopore and micropore; meanwhile, the silty laminae are dominated by macropore alone. The pore volume distribution in clayey laminae is sorted as mesopore volume\u00a0u003e\u00a0micropore volume\u00a0u003e\u00a0macropore volume, on the other hand, for silty laminae it is macropore volume\u00a0u003e\u00a0mesopore volume\u00a0u003e\u00a0micropore volume. The averaged total pore volume of silty laminae is 2.02\u00a0cc/100\u00a0g, and for clayey laminae, it is 1.41\u00a0cc/100\u00a0g. The porosity of silty laminae is 5.40%, which is greater than that of clayey laminaeu0027s 3.67%. Since silty laminae have larger pore width and pore space, they are more permeable and porous than the clayey laminae; it also acts as a favorable conduit and reservoir for shale gas.",

Here, Pt-Au/C catalysts were designed and synthesized for catalyzing the FAO reaction. An ultrasound-assisted method was developed to enable the uniform and dense loading of Pt and Au on carbon black without any surfactant. The Pt-Au/C sample with a Pt/Au atomic ratio of 32:68 exhibits an FAO catalytic activity of 14.5\u202fA\u202fmgPt\u22121, which is 153 times higher than that of Pt/C. The extraordinary performance is attributed to the optimized synergistic effect of Pt and Au. Density functional theory calculations disclose that the neighboring Au decreases the reaction energy barriers of the direct pathway on Pt. This work demonstrates a promising FAO catalyst and an effective strategy to obtain supported catalysts.",

The 3D structure comprised of rGO and Co, Ni\u2013OH can improve the electron transport ability and increase the contact of the active sites with electrolyte. The Ni(OH)2/Co(OH)2 hollow nanohexagons are uniform with outer diameter of \u223c200 nm and inner diameter of \u223c150 nm. The electrochemical performance of Ni(OH)2/Co(OH)2 hollow nanohexagon wrapped by rGO can be readily manipulated by adjusting the ratio between Ni, Co precursors and graphene oxide. High specific capacitance with enhanced electrochemical properties is attributed to the conductive network provided by graphene and synergetic effect between graphene and other components in electroactive material. Specially, the Ni(OH)2/Co(OH)2 hollow nanohexagon with 1.0 \u03bcg mL\u22121 rGO exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 1292.79 F g\u22121. Meanwhile, such sample also exhibit smaller equivalent series resistance and charge transfer resistance compared with hollow hexagons wrapped by other rGO concentrations.

Economical and green synthetic routes are highly desirable. Here, we report a facile approach to prepare double- and single-layered Pt-Ni nanobowls (DLNBs and SLNBs) with porous shells. Microstructural analysis revealed that the shells were constructed of alloyed Pt-Ni nanocrystals and small amounts of Ni compounds. X-ray photoelectron spectra showed that their Pt 4f binding energies shifted in the negative direction compared to those of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, the DLNBs contained greater contents of oxidized Ni species than the SLNBs. The layer-controlled growth processes were confirmed by microscopy, and a formation mechanism was proposed based on the assistance of citrate and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP). For the methanol oxidation reaction, the DLNBs and SLNBs exhibited 2.9 and 2.5 times higher mass activities than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. The activity enhancements were attributed to electronic effects and a bifunctional mechanism. Chronoamperometry and prolonged cyclic voltammetry indicated that the Pt-Ni bowl-like structures had better electrochemical properties and structural stability than the commercial Pt/C catalyst, thus making the Pt-Ni nanobowls excellent electrocatalysts for use in direct methanol fuel cells.",

Benefiting from its unique structure, high porosity, and the synergistic effect between CoO and Co 3 O 4 , when employed as electrode materials for supercapacitors, the CoO  x   microspheres exhibit a high specific capacitance of 3377.8\u00a0F\u00a0g \u22121  at a current density of 2\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121 , which are far superior to those of individual CoO or Co 3 O 4 . In addition, the CoO  x   electrode shows an excellent rate property of 66.5% capacity retention at 20\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121  and can still remain a high specific capacitance of 1331.1\u00a0F\u00a0g \u22121  after 4000 cycles at a high current density of 10\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121 .

Constructing three-dimensional porous structures would endow the catalysts with good stability. Here, we report a simple strategy to synthesize porous Pt\u2013NiOx nanostructures composed of ultrasmall (about 3.0 nm) building blocks in an ethanol\u2013water solvent. Structure and component analysis revealed that the as-prepared material consisted of interconnected Pt nanocrystals and amorphous NiOx species. The formation mechanism investigation revealed that the preformed amorphous compounds were vital for the construction of porous structure. In the ethanol oxidation reaction, Pt\u2013NiOx/C exhibited current densities of 0.50 mA cmPt\u22122 at 0.45 V (vs. SCE), which were 16.7 times higher than that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst. Potentiostatic tests showed that Pt\u2013NiOx/C had much higher current and better tolerance towards CO poisoning than the Pt/C catalyst under 0.45 V (vs. SCE). In addition, the NiOx species on the surface also outperformed an alloyed Ni component in the test. These results indicate that the Pt\u2013NiOx porous nanomaterial is promising for use in direct ethanol fuel cells.",

The emerging metal-oxide resistive random-access memory (RRAM) and RRAM crossbar have shown great potential on neuromorphic applications with high energy efficiency. However, the interfaces between analog RRAM crossbars and digital peripheral functions, namely Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) and Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs), consume most of the area and energy of RRAM-based CNN design due to the large amount of intermediate data in CNN. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient structure for RRAM-based CNN. Based on the analysis of data distribution, a quantization method is proposed to transfer the intermediate data into 1 bit and eliminate DACs. An energy efficient structure using input data as selection signals is proposed to reduce the ADC cost for merging results of multiple crossbars. The experimental results show that the proposed method and structure can save 80% area and more than 95% energy while maintaining the same or comparable classification accuracy of CNN on MNIST.",

Applications range from image classification to object detection, segmentation, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), etc. At the same time, CNNs are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to be deployed on low power lightweight embedded systems. In this work, we introduce an on-chip convoltional neural network implementation for low-power embedded system. We point out that the high precision of weights limits the low-power CNN implementation on both FPGA and RRAM platform. A dynamic quantization method is introduced to reduce the precision while maintaining the same or comparable accuracy at the same time. Finally, the de ailed designs of low-power FPGA-based CNN and RRAM-based CNN are provided and compared. The results show that FPGA-based design gets 2\u00d7 energy efficiency compared with GPU implementation, and toe RRAM-based design can further obtain more than 40\u00d7 energy efficiency gains.",

        "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) is becoming popular in a wide range of domains. Many emerging applications, ranging from image and speech recognition to natural language processing and information retrieval, rely heavily on deep learning techniques, especially the Neural Networks (NNs). NNs have led to great advances in recognition accuracy compared with other traditional methods in recent years. NN-based methods demand much more computation and memory resource, and therefore a number of NN accelerators have been proposed on CMOS-based platforms, such as FPGA and GPU [1]. However, it becomes more and more difficult to obtain substantial power efficiency and gains directly through the scaling down of traditional CMOS technique. Meanwhile, the large data amount in DL applications also meets an ever-increasing \\\"memory wall\\\" challenge because of the efficiency of von Neumann architecture. Consequently, there is a growing research interest of exploring emerging nano-devices and new computing architectures to further improve power efficiency [2].",

Unfortunately, due to the immature fabrication technology, commonly occurring Stuck-At-Faults (SAFs) seriously degrade the computational accuracy of RRAM crossbar based Computing System (RCS). In this paper, we propose a Mapping Algorithm with inner fault-tolerant ability (MAO) to convert matrix parameters into RRAM conductances in RCS by providing larger mapping space and fully exploring the available mapping space. Furthermore, we present two computation-oriented redundancy schemes - `Redundant Crossbars' (RX) and `Independent Redundant Columns' (IRC) to alleviate the loss of computational accuracy due to SAFs. RX adds redundant RRAM crossbar arrays and IRC introduces independent redundant RRAM columns to compensate the computational errors brought by SAFs.",

        "abstract": "The training of neural network (NN) is usually time-consuming and resource intensive. Memristor has shown its potential in computation of NN. Especially for the metal-oxide resistive random access memory (RRAM), its crossbar structure and multi-bit characteristic can perform the matrix-vector product in high precision, which is the most common operation of NN. However, there exist two challenges on realizing the training of NN. Firstly, the current architecture can only support the inference phase of training and cannot perform the backpropagation (BP), the weights update of NN. Secondly, the training of NN requires enormous iterations and constantly updates the weights to reach the convergence, which leads to large energy consumption because of lots of write and read operations. In this work, we propose a novel architecture, TIME, and peripheral circuit designs to enable the training of NN in RRAM. TIME supports the BP and the weights update while maximizing the reuse of peripheral circuits for the inference operation on RRAM. Meanwhile, a variability-free tuning scheme and gradually-write circuits are designed to reduce the cost of tuning RRAM. We explore the performance of both SL (supervised learning) and DRL (deep reinforcement learning) in TIME, and a specific mapping method of DRL is also introduced to further improve the energy efficiency. Experimental results show that, in SL, TIME can achieve 5.3x higher energy efficiency on average compared with the most powerful application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) in the literature. In DRL, TIME can perform averagely 126x higher than GPU in energy efficiency. If the cost of tuning RRAM can be further reduced, TIME have the potential of boosting the energy efficiency by 2 orders of magnitude compared with ASIC.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved excellent performance on various artificial intelligence (AI) applications, while a higher demand on energy efficiency is required for future AI. Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM)-based computing system provides a promising solution to energy-efficient neural network training. However, it's difficult to support high-precision CNN in RRAM-based hardware systems. Firstly, multi-bit digital-analog interfaces will take up most energy overhead of the whole system. Secondly, it's difficult to write the RRAM to expected resistance states accurately; only low-precision numbers can be represented. To enable CNN training based on RRAM, we propose a low-bitwidth CNN training method, using low-bitwidth convolution outputs (CO), activations (A), weights (W) and gradients (G) to train CNN models based on RRAM. Furthermore, we design a system to implement the training algorithms. We explore the accuracy under different bitwidth combinations of (A,CO,W,G), and propose a practical tradeoff between accuracy and energy overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed system perform well on low-bitwidth CNN training tasks. For example, training LeNet-5 with 4-bit convolution outputs, 4-bit weights, 4-bit activations and 4-bit gradients on MNIST can still achieve 97.67% accuracy. Moreover, the proposed system can achieve 23.0X higher energy efficiency than GPU when processing the training task of LeNet-5, and 4.4X higher energy efficiency when processing the training task of ResNet-20.\n\n",

However, due to the nonlinear distribution of resistance levels in memristor devices, the state-of-the-art multi-bit cell cannot accomplish the multi-bit computing task accurately. In this paper, we propose fault-tolerant schemes to rescue memristor-based computation with nonlinear resistance levels. We classify the resistance level distributions in memristor devices into three types, and the corresponding models are proposed to analyze the computation characteristics. We propose two theoretical conditions to determine if a memristor device can support multi-bit matrix computation. For the deviated linear model, the least squares method is used to reduce the computing error. When the resistance distribution obeys the proposed power model, a logarithmic operation circuit is used to decode the multiplication results and then accomplish the computing accurately. For the exponential model, since the device cannot complete typical matrix-vector multiplication from hardware level, we propose online and offline quantization methods to make the neural computing algorithms friendly to memristor device. Simulation results show that the root-mean-square error improves around 4% with the linear model and more than 99% with the power model. After quantization, the accuracy of ResNet-18 using memristor with exponential conductance levels can be improved to the same accuracy with ideal linear devices.",

        "abstract": "The training of neural networks (NN) is usually time-consuming and resource intensive. The emerging metal-oxide resistive random-access memory (RRAM) device has shown potential for the computation of NN. RRAM crossbar structure and multibit characteristics can perform the matrix-vector product in high energy efficiency, which is the most common operation of NN. Two challenges exist for realizing training NN based on RRAM. First, the current architectures based on RRAM only support the inference in training NN and cannot perform the backpropagation (BP) and the weight update of training NN. Second, training NN requires enormous iterations to constantly update the weights for reaching the convergence. However, this weight update leads to large energy consumption because of the nonideal factors of RRAM. In this paper, we propose a training-in-memory based on RRAM (TIME) architecture and the peripheral circuit design to enable training NN on RRAM. TIME supports the BP and the weight update while maximizing the re-usage of peripheral circuits of the inference operation on RRAM. Meanwhile, a set of optimization strategies focusing on the nonideal factors are designed to reduce the cost of tuning RRAM. We explore the performance of both supervised learning (SL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) on TIME. A specific mapping method of DRL is also introduced to further improve energy efficiency. Simulation results show that in SL, TIME can achieve \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$5.3{\\times }$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n higher energy efficiency on average compared with DaDianNao, an application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) in CMOS technology. In DRL, TIME can perform an average \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$126{\\times }$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n higher than GPU in energy efficiency. If the cost of tuning RRAM can be further reduced, TIME has the potential to boost the energy efficiency by two orders of magnitudes compared with ASIC.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Chromium dioxide (CrO 2 ) is a striking half metal material which may have important applications in the field of spintronics. However, pure CrO 2  film is metastable at room temperature and the synthesis process can be only performed in a narrow temperature range of 390\u2013410\u202f\u00b0C with TiO 2  used as substrate material. Here, we report the preparation and investigation of (1\u202f0\u202f0) oriented Ti-doped CrO 2  films on TiO 2  substrates. It is found that Ti-doped films can maintain pure rutile phase even after a 510\u202f\u00b0C post-annealing, showing much better thermal stability than pure CrO 2  films. Ti-doped films can be prepared in a wider temperature window (390\u2013470\u202f\u00b0C), which may be attributed to the improvement of thermal stability. The broadening of process window may be beneficial for further improvement of film quality by optimizing growth temperature in a larger range. In addition to the improvement of thermal stability, the magnetic properties of Ti-doped CrO 2  are also found to be tuned by Ti doping: saturation magnetizations of Ti-doped films at room temperature are significantly lower, and magnetic anisotropy decreases as the Ti-concentration increases, which is beneficial for decreasing switching current density in STT-based spintronic devices.",

        "abstract": "High-quality CrO2 films were synthesized on TiO2 (100) substrates at different temperatures using the chemical vapor deposition method in argon or nitrogen atmosphere. It was found that the lower limit for the growth temperature of CrO2 films can be reduced to 310 or 300 \u00b0C when using Ar or N2 as the carrier gas, respectively. The quality of CrO2 film on TiO2 substrate can thus be improved by optimizing growth temperature in a much larger range (310\u2013400 \u00b0C in Ar and 300\u2013430 \u00b0C in N2, in contrast with 390\u2013410 \u00b0C in O2), which is significant for the practical application of CrO2 films. The best film quality was achieved at 320 \u00b0C in either Ar or N2 atmosphere, at which CrO2 film has its narrowest orientation distribution and lowest roughness. Compared to films grown in O2, films grown in Ar were found to have larger saturation magnetizations (Ms) and magnetic anisotropies, possibly due to numerous O vacancies. Films grown in N2 are actually N-doped films, and have lower Ms than those grown in O2. The Curie temperature (Tc) was also tuned by the carrier gas and growth temperature. Films grown in Ar or N2 generally have a higher Tc value than those grown in O2. Furthermore, the thermal stability of the films was found to be remarkably improved when using N2 as the carrier gas.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Chromium dioxide (CrO 2 ) is one of the perfect candidates for application in the field of spintronics due to its 100% spin polarization around the Fermi surface. In this work, N-doped epitaxial CrO 2  (100) films were successfully synthesized on TiO 2  substrates using the chemical vapor deposition technique in the nitrogen-involved atmosphere. The deposition window of N-doped CrO 2  ranged from 300 to 430\u00b0C in contrast to narrow temperature window for CrO 2  in pure O 2  atmosphere. Compared with pure CrO 2 , N-doped films have better film quality, narrower orientation distribution and lower roughness. It was also found that the magnetic anisotropy and Curie temperature of the CrO 2  film increased respectively with the N concentration, suggesting that N-doping offer an efficiently way for anisotropy manipulation. The annealing tests further reveal improved thermal stability of the N-doped film, N-doped films can withstand annealing temperatures as high as 470\u202f\u00b0C in contrast to 420\u202f\u00b0C for pure CrO 2 . The investigation on the electronic structure of N-doped CrO 2  via first principle calculations suggests that N-doping only slightly affects the density of states of CrO 2  without changing its half metallicity. Based on these results, N-doped CrO 2  films may be promising for applications in spintronic devices.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we present our numerical investigation about the spin-orbit-torque (SOT) induced domain-wall (DW) motion in a synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) multilayer nanotrack. The velocity of DW can be well manipulated by varying parameters including RKKY inter-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange coupling, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) strength, the current density and the magnetic anisotropy. The DW velocity was found to be strictly related to the relative orientation of moments in two ferromagnetic (FM) layers. When the interfacial AFM exchange coupling and the DMI are strong enough, the DW angle of one FM layer is opposite to that in the other one, and an ultrahigh DW speed (around 10000 m/s) was found. In this case, the DW velocity is mainly attributed to the DMI and AFM exchange coupling. However, when the DMI or the AFM exchange coupling is small, the moments of two layers are parallel to each other under the action of SOT, and the velocity is significantly reduced.",

        "abstract": "In this work, VZrO\u2082 powder (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04) was synthesized by two step hydrothermal method. The micro-topography, magnetic and phase transition properties have been investigated using various measurement techniques. All prepared VZrO\u2082 powder samples exhibit monoclinic structure at room temperature. With the Zr ions doping concentration increased, the shapes of VO\u2082 particles change from spherical to rectangular slice. Besides, the saturation magnetic moment of the samples decrease with the increase of doped Zr ions concentration, while their phase transition temperature increase gradually with Zr ions doping at a rate of around 2 \u00b0C/at% on average. We investigated the Zr doping effects on V-V dimers and confirmed the role of V-V dimers in phase transition. We speculate that more V-V dimers form with Zr doping by magnetic measurements, which result in the monoclinic phase of Zr-doped VO\u2082 sample is more stable than rutile phase. Therefore the phase transition temperature is elevated by Zr doping in our experiment. We further consider that the VO\u2082 phase transition should be ascribed to Peierls transition caused by the changing of V-V dimers.",

It was found that, driven by proper currents, spin waves can be excited and propagate along the nanowires, leading to sustained oscillations of the magnetic moments. The frequency and amplitude strongly depend on the length of the longitudinal magnetized part (L&lt;sub&gt;IMA&lt;/sub&gt;), and can be effectively tuned by applied current. The assistance of an applied field may help to obtain large frequencies and amplitudes simultaneously. Considering their ease of manufacture, these kinds of composite nanowires hold great promise for nano-oscillator applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The crystal structures and magnetic properties of CrO 2  films of different orientations and thicknesses grown on SnO 2  were investigated and compared with those on TiO 2 . Results reveal that large anisotropic strains were found in (100) films, but only small strains existed in (110) films. The magnetic anisotropies of CrO 2  (110) films on SnO 2  and TiO 2  were found to be similar. As for CrO 2  (100) films, magnetic anisotropies were quite different-at the same thickness, the magnetic anisotropy of the film on SnO 2  substrate was higher than that on TiO 2 . However, the easy axes of the films were found to be always along  c  axis even at very small thickness, and no easy axis switching was observed. First-principle calculations reveal that magnetic anisotropy energy is not only concerned with anisotropic strain but also with the substrate. The competition between the anisotropic preference of interface and the effect of strains may be one important factor for determining the actual easy axis direction. The combined effects of strain and interface may also be one reason for the magnetic anisotropic difference between CrO 2  (100) films on SnO 2  and TiO 2 .",

        "abstract": "Metal ions, usually bound by various amino-acid side chains in proteins, play multiple roles in protein folding, conformational change, cellu-lar communication, and catalysis. Ca(II) and Mg(II), abundant among biologically relevant cations, execute their cellular functions associ-ated with the conformational change of bound proteins. They bind with proteins where carboxylic acid residues are dominant ligands. To develop mass spectrometry for mapping protein-binding sites, we implemented a new carboxyl group footprinter, benzhydrazide, and re-fined it with isotope encoding. The method uses carbodiimide chemistry to footprint carboxylic residues, whereby 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide activates a carboxyl group followed by nucleophilic attack by benzhydrazide forming a stable labeled product. We tested the effectiveness of isotope-encoded benzhydrazide by studying Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding of calmodulin, an EF-hand pro-tein. The footprinting results indicate that the four active sites for metal-ion binding (EF hands I, II, III, and IV) and the linker region (pep-tide 78-86) undergo conformational changes upon Ca(II) and Mg(II) binding, respectively. The outcome is consistent with previously reported results and 3-D structures, thereby validating a new reagent that is more reactive and discriminating for specific amino-acid pro-tein footprinting. This reagent should be important for locating metal-binding sites of other metalloproteins.",

        "abstract": "Cyanobacterial phycobilisomes (PBSs) are photosynthetic antenna complexes that harvest light energy and supply it to two reaction centers (RCs) where photochemistry starts. PBSs can be classified into two types, depending on the presence of allophycocyanin (APC): CpcG-PBS and CpcL-PBS. Because the accurate protein composition of CpcL-PBS remains unclear, we describe here its isolation and characterization from the cyanobacterium  sp. strain 6803. We found that ferredoxin-NADP oxidoreductase (or FNR), an enzyme involved in both cyclic electron transport and the terminal step of the electron transport chain in oxygenic photosynthesis, is tightly associated with CpcL-PBS as well as with CpcG-PBS. Room temperature and low-temperature fluorescence analyses show a red-shifted emission at 669\u2009nm in CpcL-PBS as a terminal energy emitter without APC. SDS-PAGE and quantitative mass spectrometry reveal an increased content of FNR and CpcC2, a rod linker protein, in CpcL-PBS compared to that of CpcG-PBS rods, indicative of an elongated CpcL-PBS rod length and its potential functional differences from CpcG-PBS. Furthermore, we combined isotope-encoded cross-linking mass spectrometry with computational protein structure predictions and structural modeling to produce an FNR-PBS binding model that is supported by two cross-links between K of FNR and the N terminus of CpcB, one component in PBS, in both CpcG-PBS and CpcL-PBS (cross-link 1), and between the N termini of FNR and CpcB (cross-link 2). Our data provide a novel functional assembly form of phycobiliproteins and a molecular-level description of the close association of FNR with phycocyanin in both CpcG-PBS and CpcL-PBS. Cyanobacterial light-harvesting complex PBSs are essential for photochemistry in light reactions and for balancing energy flow to carbon fixation in the form of ATP and NADPH. We isolated a new type of PBS without an allophycocyanin core (i.e., CpcL-PBS). CpcL-PBS contains both a spectral red-shifted chromophore, enabling efficient energy transfer to chlorophyll molecules in the reaction centers, and an increased FNR content with various rod lengths. Identification of a close association of FNR with both CpcG-PBS and CpcL-PBS brings new insight to its regulatory role for fine-tuning light energy transfer and carbon fixation through both noncyclic and cyclic electron transport.",

Herein, we present a 2.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution X-ray crystal structure of Mxra8 and 4 to 5\u00a0\u00c5 resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of Mxra8 bound to chikungunya (CHIKV) virus-like particles and infectious virus. The Mxra8 ectodomain contains two strand-swapped Ig-like domains oriented in a unique disulfide-linked head-to-head arrangement. Mxra8 binds by wedging into a cleft created by two adjacent CHIKV E2-E1 heterodimers in one trimeric spike and engaging a neighboring spike. Two binding modes are observed with the fully mature VLP, with one Mxra8 binding with unique contacts. Only the high-affinity binding mode was observed in the complex with infectious CHIKV, as viral maturation and E3 occupancy appear to influence receptor binding-site usage. Our studies provide insight into how Mxra8 binds CHIKV and creates a path for developing alphavirus entry inhibitors.",

It has been applied to solve a variety of problems in different areas of biology. A FPOP platform requires a laser, optics, and sample flow path properly assembled to enable fast footprinting. Sample preparation, buffer conditions, and reagent concentrations are essential to obtain reasonable oxidations on proteins. FPOP samples can be analyzed by LC\u2013MS methods to measure the modification extent, which is a function of the solvent-accessible surface area of the protein. The platform can be expanded to accommodate several new approaches, including dose-response studies, new footprinting reagents, and two-laser pump\u2013probe experiments. Here, we briefly review FPOP applications and in a detailed manner describe the procedures to set up an FPOP protein footprinting platform.",

The main purpose of this investigation was to explore the effect of miR-15b on lipid metabolism in mammary epithelial cells, along with the underlying mechanisms. miR-15b was overexpressed or inhibited by miRNA mimics or inhibitors; subsequently, lipid formation in mammary epithelial cells, and proteins related to lipid metabolism, were investigated. Through overexpression or inhibition of miR-15b expression, the current investigation found that miR-15b downregulates lipid metabolism in mammary epithelial cells and is expressed differentially at various stages of mouse and goat mammary gland development. Inhibition of miR-15b expression increased lipid content in mammary epithelial cells through elevation of the lipid synthesis enzyme fatty acid synthetase (FASN), and overexpression of miR-15b reduced lipid content in mammary epithelial cells with decreasing levels of FASN. Moreover, the steroid hormones estradiol and progesterone decreased miR-15b expression with a subsequent increase in lipid formation in mammary epithelial cells. The expression of miR-15b was lower during lactation and negatively correlated with lipid synthesis proteins, which suggests that it may be involved in lipid synthesis and milk production. miR-15b might be a useful target for altering lipid production and milk yield.",

        "abstract": "Milk lipids, important for infant growth and development, are produced and secreted by mammary gland under the regulation of steroid hormones, growth factors, and microRNAs (miRNAs). miR-221 has been identified in milk and adipocytes and it plays important roles in regulating normal mammary epithelial hierarchy and breast cancer stem cells; however, its roles in lipid metabolism in mammary epithelial cells (MECs), the cells of lipid synthesis and secretion, are as yet unknown. Through overexpression or inhibition of miR-221 expression, we found that it regulated lipid metabolism in MECs and was expressed differentially at various stages during murine mammary gland development. Inhibition of miR-221 expression increased lipid content in MECs through elevation of the lipid synthesis enzyme FASN, while overexpression of miR-221 reduced MEC lipid content. Moreover, the steroid hormones estradiol and progesterone decreased miR-221 expression with a subsequent increase in lipid formation in MECs. The expression of miR-221 was lower during lactation, which suggests that it may be involved in milk production. Therefore, miR-221 might be a useful target for influencing milk lipid production.",

MicroRNA-126 (miR-126) has previously been observed in mammary glands and adipocytes and is known to be involved in lipid metabolism during the process of atherosclerosis. However, it remains unknown whether miR-126 also participates in lipid metabolism in mammary luminal epithelial cells (MECs). In the current investigation, miR-126-3p inhibition stimulated lipid synthesis in MECs in part through increasing levels of the lipid synthesis enzymes FASN, ACSL1, and Insig1. Overexpression of miR-126-3p decreased lipid content in MECs with a reduction in FASN and Insig1. Furthermore, the expression of miR-126-3p was diminished by the steroid hormones estradiol and progesterone with a subsequent elevation of lipid formation in MECs. We also noted that miR-126-3p was expressed differentially at various stages of murine mammary gland development, exhibiting a negative correlation with FASN. Together these findings suggest that miR-126-3 might be involved in lipid metabolism in mammary gland.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The main function of the mammary gland is to produce milk which contains the crucial active components for infant development. The process of milk production is tightly controlled at a local level by hormones, growth factors, noncoding RNAs and other factors. Circular RNAs (CircRNAs) are specifically expressed across tissues or developmental stages where they have potential regulatory functions. Competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), sharing miRNA recognition elements (MREs), emerge to compete for miRNA binding and, in turn, regulate each other. Although circRNAs have been determined in rat and bovine mammary glands during lactation, these studies simply investigated the expression of circRNAs in the mammary gland with no exploration of ceRNAs of circRNA-mRNA. In the current study, mRNA, miRNA and circRNA were sequenced in goat mammary tissue at 2 stages during lactation (early and mature). All data (mRNA, miRNA, and circRNA) were co-expressed together from the same samples. ceRNAs (mRNA-miRNA-circRNA) were found to be involved in goat lactation. Therefore the findings of the current investigation suggest a novel approach through the application of a ceRNA network (mRNA-miRNA-circRNA) for the analysis of gene functionality in biological processes such as lactation.",

        "abstract": "Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) have proven highly efficient T cell recruiters for cancer immunotherapy by virtue of one tumor antigen-reactive single chain variable fragment (scFv) and another that binds CD3. In order to enhance the antitumor potency of these tandem scFv BsAbs (tsc-BsAbs), we exploited the dimerization domain of the human transcription factor HNF1\u03b1 to enhance the avidity of a tsc-BsAb to the tumor antigen disialoganglioside GD2 while maintaining functional monovalency to CD3 to limit potential toxicity. The dimeric tsc-BsAb showed increased avidity to GD2, enhanced T cell mediated killing of neuroblastoma and melanoma cell lines  (32-37 fold), exhibited a near 4-fold improvement in serum half-life, and enhanced tumor ablation in mouse xenograft models. We propose that the use of this HNF1\u03b1-derived dimerization tag may be a novel and effective strategy to increase the potency of T-cell engaging antibodies for clinical cancer immunotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Engineering potent bispecific antibodies from single-chain variable fragments (scFv) remains difficult due to the inherent instability and insufficient binding of scFv's compared to their parental immunoglobulin format. Previously, we described a scFv-based bispecific antibody (scBA) against disialoganglioside (GD2) based on the anti-GD2 murine 5F11-scFv and the anti-CD3 huOKT3-scFv (5F11-scBA). In this study, we substituted the 5F11-scFv with the higher affinity (13-fold) hu3F8-scFv to form hu3F8-scBA. With this modification, hu3F8-scBA redirected T cells to kill GD2(+) cancer cell lines with up to 5,000-fold higher potency (femtomolar EC50) compared with 5F11-scBA (picomolar EC50) in cytotoxicity assays, even against target cells with low GD2 densities. Furthermore, hu3F8-scBA induced stronger T-cell activation than 5F11-scBA, as measured by Ca(2+) flux and cytokine release. Additionally, in vivo, hu3F8-scBA suppressed tumor growth and prolonged mice survival much more effectively than 5F11-scBA, in both neuroblastoma and melanoma xenograft models. We conclude that the functional properties of scBA's can be increased substantially by relatively modest increases in antigen affinity. ",

Acetate supported highest maximum power density of 589.1mW/m(2), with highest V(V) removal efficiency of 77.6% during 12h operation, compared with glucose, citrate and soluble starch. Exorbitant initial V(V) concentration led to lower V(V) removal efficiencies and power outputs. Extra addition of organics had little effect on the improvement of MFCs performance. V(V) reduction and bioelectricity generation were enhanced and then suppressed by the increase of conductivity. The larger the external resistance, the higher the V(V) removal efficiencies and voltage outputs. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing analysis implied the accumulation of Enterobacter which had the capabilities of V(V) reduction, electrochemical activity and fermentation, accompanied with other functional species as Pseudomonas, Spirochaeta, Sedimentibacter and Dysgonomonas. This study steps forward to remediate V(V) contaminated environment based on MFC technology.",

        "abstract": "Energy storage systems (ESSs) play an important role in addressing the increasing demand for flexibility in the power system, due to the increased penetration of renewable energy sources. Moreover, ESSs are also a cost-effective solution to network and system capacity shortages. In this setting, this paper analyzes the potential of ESSs to support the adequate operation of distribution networks by providing capacity services. Particularly, the ability of multiple ESSs to provide security of supply through a coordinated operation. The proposed solution was compared against traditional methods and assessed in two case studies: different demand conditions and reactive power capability. In addition, a sensitivity analysis, regarding ESS power and energy capacity, was carried out. The results demonstrate that a coordinated operation of multiple ESSs can further support distribution network operators (DNOs) managing peaks of demand. Furthermore, the studies have also shown that reactive power capabilities of ESSs can significantly increase the value of ESSs for DNOs.",

However, uncertainties due to intermittent generation of renewable energy based DGs i.e. wind turbines (WTs) and solar photovoltaics (PVs) are a challenge for DG integration. This work proposes a robust distributed generation investment planning (DGIP) which considers the uncertainties associated with the intermittent renewable generation and variable electricity demand. The proposed DGIP minimizes the net present value (NPV) of total costs of investment, operation, maintenance and emissions of WTs and PVs. The proposed planning solution is assessed using the 53-bus test feeder and the numerical result demonstrates its benefit against the conventional solution.",

        "abstract": "The rising penetration of intermittent renewable distributed generation leads to uncertainties in the planning of electric distribution networks. Fully considering the uncertainties pertinent to wind power generation, photovoltaic power generation and load demand, this paper proposes a scenario-based model for the planning of active distribution systems. The solution obtains the optimal capacities and locations of wind and photovoltaic based distributed generators in the distribution system, whilst minimizing the active and reactive power losses as well as voltage deviation. A scenario matrix is generated using the heuristic moment matching technique that captures the stochastic moments and correlation among historical wind and photovoltaic power, and electricity demand. The scenario matrix is then incorporated to propose a stochastic planning model that considers a multi-objective index for minimizing power losses and voltage deviation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed planning model is confirmed using case-studies in 53-bus and IEEE 123-bus distribution systems.",

To realize the enhanced Brillouin nonlinearity, the optical and acoustic fields are effectively confined by partly suspending the spiral resonator. The free spectral range is precisely designed to match the half of the Brillouin frequency shift to guarantee Brillouin laser oscillation. The fabricated spiral resonator is incorporated in a fiber loop to serve as not only a resonance-enhanced element to generate the internal pump lasing for Brillouin scattering but also a Brillouin gain medium to excite Brillouin lasing.

The forward stimulated Brillouin scattering (FSBS) in these SiGe waveguides are analyzed by considering the effects of SiGe concentration on the optical forces. In the radiation-enhanced configuration, electrostrictive forces can constructively add to or destructively interfere with radiation pressure, depending on the concentration. The silicon waveguides with graded-varying cover layers provide a means of enhancing photon\u2013phonon interaction and rewriting the selection rule of excited acoustic modes. The numerical simulation results indicate that SiGe strip waveguides can realize the largest net Stokes\u2019 amplification up to 10.32 dB. Compared to traditional pure silicon waveguides, the silicon waveguides with graded-varying cover layers have an improvement of about 40% on Brillouin gain and at least 2.5\u00a0dB on net Stokes\u2019 amplification. Our proposed SiGe waveguides offer an effective approach to implement flexible FSBS in silicon-based chip.",

        "abstract": "Factors influencing the -mediated transformation of both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant species have been widely investigated. These factors include manipulating  strains and plasmids, growth conditions for  gene induction, plant genotype, inoculation and co-culture conditions, and the selection agents and their application regime. We report here a novel physical parameter during co-culture, desiccation of plant cells or tissues post- infection, which greatly enhances transfer DNA (T-DNA) delivery and increases stable transformation efficiency in wheat. Desiccation during co-culture dramatically suppressed  growth, which is one of the factors known to favor plant cell recovery. Osmotic and abscisic acid treatments and desiccation prior to inoculation did not have the same enhancement effect as desiccation during co-culture on T-DNA delivery in wheat. An efficient transformation protocol has been developed based on desiccation and is suitable for both paromomycin and glyphosate selection. Southern analysis showed approximately 67% of transgenic wheat plants received a single copy of the transgene.",

        "abstract": "Designing theranostic agents that are responsive to weakly acidic tumor microenvironments for optimized imaging and therapeutic effects is of great interest in nanomedicine. In the current study, we constructed a pH-triggered smart theranostic system based on pH-responsive Prussian blue, which shows good performance in the photoacoustic imaging (PAI)-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumors. Precursors to Prussian blue, namely ferrous and ferricyanide ions, were separately encapsulated into pH-responsive hydrogels that only degraded under acidic conditions. In vitro results showed that the encapsulated ions were gradually released in acidic buffer, accompanied by hydrogel degradation. After the resultant hydrogel was mixed and intratumorally injected into tumor-bearing mice, the encapsulated ferrous ions and ferricyanide ions were successfully released in the acidic tumor environment, allowing the in situ formation of Prussian blue in the tumor area. This provided an efficient theranostic agent for PAI-guided PTT of cancer. Our research highlights the potential of Prussian blue-based theranostic agents for the precise diagnosis and treatment of cancer.",

With parallel structure, categorized harmonic frequency internal models are connected in parallel. Each categorized internal model has its own independent control gain and PSRC can optimize the total convergence rate by tuning the control gains independently according to the harmonic distribution. Compared with a multiresonant controller, PSRC has more compact structure and yields much less computation burden. Compared with conventional repetitive control (CRC), PSRC can achieve a much faster dynamic response without any loss of tracking accuracy or any added data memory. Moreover, PSRC is a general parallel structure RC for housing various existing RC, such as CRC, odd-harmonic RC, and dual-mode-structure RC. Experimental results of the PSRC-controlled three-phase dc-ac PWM converters show the validity and advantages of the proposed PSRC scheme.",

        "title": "Optimal Scheduling of PEV Charging/Discharging in Microgrids with Combined Objectives",
        "abstract": "While renewable power generation and vehicle electrification are promising solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it faces great challenges to effectively integrate them in a power grid. The weather-dependent power generation of renewable energy sources, such as Photovoltaic (PV) arrays, could introduce significant intermittency to a power grid. Meanwhile, uncontrolled PEV charging may cause load surge in a power grid. This paper studies the optimization of PEV charging/discharging scheduling to reduce customer cost and improve grid performance. Optimization algorithms are developed for three cases: 1) minimize cost, 2) minimize power deviation from a pre-defined power profile, and 3) combine objective functions in 1) and 2). A Microgrid with PV arrays, bi-directional PEV charging stations, and a commercial building is used in this study. The bi-directional power from/to PEVs provides the opportunity of using PEVs to reduce the intermittency of PV power generation and the peak load of the Microgrid. Simulation has been performed for all three cases and the simulation results show that the presented optimization algorithms can meet defined objectives.",

However, much work remains in the area of social conversation as well as free-form conversation over a broad range of domains and topics. To advance the state of the art in conversational AI, Amazon launched the Alexa Prize, a 2.5-million-dollar university competition where sixteen selected university teams were challenged to build conversational agents, known as socialbots, to converse coherently and engagingly with humans on popular topics such as Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Fashion and Technology for 20 minutes. The Alexa Prize offers the academic community a unique opportunity to perform research with a live system used by millions of users. The competition provided university teams with real user conversational data at scale, along with the user-provided ratings and feedback augmented with annotations by the Alexa team. This enabled teams to effectively iterate and make improvements throughout the competition while being evaluated in real-time through live user interactions. To build their socialbots, university teams combined state-of-the-art techniques with novel strategies in the areas of Natural Language Understanding, Context Modeling, Dialog Management, Response Generation, and Knowledge Acquisition. To support the efforts of participating teams, the Alexa Prize team made significant scientific and engineering investments to build and improve Conversational Speech Recognition, Topic Tracking, Dialog Evaluation, Voice User Experience, and tools for traffic management and scalability. This paper outlines the advances created by the university teams as well as the Alexa Prize team to achieve the common goal of solving the problem of Conversational AI.",

To advance the state of the art in conversational AI, Amazon launched the Alexa Prize, a 2.5-million dollar university competition where sixteen selected university teams built conversational agents to deliver the best social conversational experience. Alexa Prize provided the academic community with the unique opportunity to perform research with a live system used by millions of users. The subjectivity associated with evaluating conversations is key element underlying the challenge of building non-goal oriented dialogue systems. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive evaluation strategy with multiple metrics designed to reduce subjectivity by selecting metrics which correlate well with human judgement. The proposed metrics provide granular analysis of the conversational agents, which is not captured in human ratings. We show that these metrics can be used as a reasonable proxy for human judgment. We provide a mechanism to unify the metrics for selecting the top performing agents, which has also been applied throughout the Alexa Prize competition. To our knowledge, to date it is the largest setting for evaluating agents with millions of conversations and hundreds of thousands of ratings from users. We believe that this work is a step towards an automatic evaluation process for conversational AIs.",

        "abstract": "Building open domain conversational systems that allow users to have engaging conversations on topics of their choice is a challenging task. Alexa Prize was launched in 2016 to tackle the problem of achieving natural, sustained, coherent and engaging open-domain dialogs. In the second iteration of the competition in 2018, university teams advanced the state of the art by using context in dialog models, leveraging knowledge graphs for language understanding, handling complex utterances, building statistical and hierarchical dialog managers, and leveraging model-driven signals from user responses. The 2018 competition also included the provision of a suite of tools and models to the competitors including the CoBot (conversational bot) toolkit, topic and dialog act detection models, conversation evaluators, and a sensitive content detection model so that the competing teams could focus on building knowledge-rich, coherent and engaging multi-turn dialog systems. This paper outlines the advances developed by the university teams as well as the Alexa Prize team to achieve the common goal of advancing the science of Conversational AI. We address several key open-ended problems such as conversational speech recognition, open domain natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, statistical dialog management, and dialog evaluation. These collaborative efforts have driven improved experiences by Alexa users to an average rating of 3.61, the median duration of 2 mins 18 seconds, and average turns to 14.6, increases of 14%, 92%, 54% respectively since the launch of the 2018 competition. For conversational speech recognition, we have improved our relative Word Error Rate by 55% and our relative Entity Error Rate by 34% since the launch of the Alexa Prize. Socialbots improved in quality significantly more rapidly in 2018, in part due to the release of the CoBot toolkit.",

        "abstract": "Conversational agents are exploding in popularity. However, much work remains in the area of non goal-oriented conversations, despite significant growth in research interest over recent years. To advance the state of the art in conversational AI, Amazon launched the Alexa Prize, a 2.5-million dollar university competition where sixteen selected university teams built conversational agents to deliver the best social conversational experience. Alexa Prize provided the academic community with the unique opportunity to perform research with a live system used by millions of users. The subjectivity associated with evaluating conversations is key element underlying the challenge of building non-goal oriented dialogue systems. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive evaluation strategy with multiple metrics designed to reduce subjectivity by selecting metrics which correlate well with human judgement. The proposed metrics provide granular analysis of the conversational agents, which is not captured in human ratings. We show that these metrics can be used as a reasonable proxy for human judgment. We provide a mechanism to unify the metrics for selecting the top performing agents, which has also been applied throughout the Alexa Prize competition. To our knowledge, to date it is the largest setting for evaluating agents with millions of conversations and hundreds of thousands of ratings from users. We believe that this work is a step towards an automatic evaluation process for conversational AIs.",

        "abstract": "Na/H exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) plays a key role in coupled electroneutral NaCl absorption in the mammalian intestine. Reduced NHE3 expression or function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diarrhea associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or enteric infections. Our previous studies revealed transcriptional regulation of NHE3 by various agents such as TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and butyrate involving transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. In silico analysis revealed that the NHE3 core promoter also contains a hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 (HNF-4\u03b1) binding site that is evolutionarily conserved in several species suggesting that HNF-4\u03b1 has a role in NHE3 regulation. Nhe3 mRNA levels were reduced in intestine-specific Hnf4\u03b1-null mice. However, detailed mechanisms of NHE3 regulation by HNF-4\u03b1 are not known. We investigated the regulation of NHE3 gene expression by HNF-4\u03b1 in vitro in the human intestinal epithelial cell line C2BBe1 and in vivo in intestine-specific Hnf4\u03b1-null ( Hnf4\u03b1) and control ( Hnf4\u03b1) mice. HNF-4\u03b1 knockdown by short interfering RNA in C2BBe1 cells significantly decreased NHE3 mRNA and NHE3 protein levels. Gel mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that HNF-4\u03b1 directly interacts with the HNF-4\u03b1 motif in the NHE3 core promoter. Site-specific mutagenesis on the HNF-4\u03b1 motif decreased, whereas ectopic overexpression of HNF-4\u03b1 increased, NHE3 promoter activity. Furthermore, loss of HNF-4\u03b1 in Hnf4\u03b1 mice decreased colonic Nhe3 mRNA and NHE3 protein levels. Our results demonstrate a novel role for HNF-4\u03b1 in basal regulation of NHE3 expression. These studies represent an important and novel target for therapeutic intervention in IBD-associated diarrhea. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our studies for the first time show that hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 directly regulates NHE3 promoter activity and its basal expression in the intestine.",

        "abstract": "Nitrate is a raw ingredient for the production of fertilizer, gunpowder, and explosives. Developing an alternative approach to activate the N\u2261N bond of naturally abundant nitrogen to form nitrate under ambient conditions will be of importance. Herein, pothole-rich WO was used to catalyse the activation of N\u2261N covalent triple bonds for the direct nitrate synthesis at room temperature. The pothole-rich structure endues the WO nanosheet more dangling bonds and more easily excited high momentum electrons, which overcome the two major bottlenecks in N\u2261N bond activation, that is, poor binding of N to catalytic materials and the high energy involved in this reaction. The average rate of nitrate production is as high as 1.92\u2005mg\u2009g \u2009h under ambient conditions, without any sacrificial agent or precious-metal co-catalysts. More generally, the concepts will initiate a new pathway for triggering inert catalytic reactions.",

        "abstract": "Summary  Electrocatalytic water splitting, which underpins a series of sustainable energy conversion technologies, has become even more relevant as our energy needs have increased. Exploring efficient non-precious-metal electrocatalysts is necessary for the widespread application of this energy storage model. Two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin solids with a special atomic and electronic structure are full of unlimited potential in the pursuit of high-efficiency electrocatalysts and have been identified as a perfect platform for establishing clear structure-property relationships. Hence, in this review, we first clear up the fundamental relationship between intrinsic charge and spin ordering and electrocatalytic properties. Then, on this basis, we summarize recent attempts to regulate electrical behavior and spin ordering in 2D ultrathin solids to optimize electrocatalytic water-splitting performance. In addition, we highlight the coupling relationship among lattice, charge, and spin ordering in ultrathin electrocatalysts. Finally, we also present some personal perspectives on the challenges and future research directions in this promising area.",

The obtained catalysts expressed highly ordered mesoporous structures proved by N 2  adsorption-desorption, XRD and TEM characterization, also were tested for their activity in dehydrogenation of isobutane. Moderately and strongly acidic sites as well as Fe 3+  species were identified as active sites. The ordered mesoporous iron-silica catalyst displayed better catalytic stability as compared with amorphous iron-silica catalyst, which was ascribed to the confinement effect of ordered meso-structure. Moreover, framework iron improved the interaction of iron with the support and increased more weakly acidic sites, which were favorable to restrain the coke formation. The coke was a major cause for catalytic deactivation.",

The acidity of these catalysts was changed by the introduction of Zn, the decrease of strong acid sites is conducive to the promotion of isobutene selectivity and the weak and medium acidic sites played an important role in isobutane conversion.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a highly integrated underactuated anthropomorphic finger with three joints and two DOFs using a novel coupled-adaptive linkage mechanism. The finger has two main motion modes: coupled motion in free space and self-adaptive motion when contacting with the object. Compared with conventional prosthetic finger, the combination of these two motion modes improves the anthropomorphic characteristics and grasping capacity remarkably. Besides, kinds of sensors embedded, force, position and tactile sensor in the finger not only intensify proactive perceptive ability, but also ameliorate the control ability. Moreover, according to a series of grasp experiments, the anthropomorphic finger can accomplish coupled motion and self-adaptive motion stably.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the design and control performance of a modular biomechatronic prosthetic hand especially with an anthropomorphic cosmesis. The hand has a total of 11 joints actuated by six motors. Each digit (2 joints, DIP and MCP, coupled) is integrated with the actuator, the transmission mechanism, the sensors and the controller as a modular unit easily to be installed, removed, maintained and applied to the partial upper-limb amputees. To improve the grasping performance, the thumb is configured with an extra DOF to abduct or adduct to the digits. Integrated with multiple sensors, the prosthetic hand can feel the environment like a human hand. As an important and applicable part, the cosmetic design is detailed and the relative performance experiments of the hand-cosmesis system are made including output force, grasping capability, position and force control capabilities. The results show that the prosthetic hand with a cosmesis has a remarkably improved appearance without comprising the control performance.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of transmission scheduling of delay-sensitive data over a point-to-point correlated Rayleigh fading channel with channel estimation errors. According to the imperfect channel state information (CSI) and the buffer state, the transmit power and the modulation and coding scheme are determined to jointly maximize the energy efficiency, and minimize transmission delay and overflow probability. To account of the effects of the channel estimation errors, the CSI imperfection is modeled as uncertain sets using the ellipsoidal approximation. Then, the joint optimization problem is formulated using the weighted sum method. Using the idea of online learning, two algorithms are proposed to schedule the delay-sensitive data for the situations with and without the uncertainty bound of channel estimation, respectively. Numerical results indicate that the proposed online learning-based scheduling algorithms can tackle the imperfect CSI issue and improve the system performance in terms of the energy efficiency, transmission delay, and overflow probability. Moreover, the convergence times are very short, which highlights the feasibility of the proposed online learning-based scheduling for practical systems.",

Then, a computationally tractable integral expression is derived for the downlink ergodic rate of the (   $N$   ,    $K$   ) virtual cell-based CRAN. The analytical expression indicates that in the interference limited regime, the ergodic rate only relies on the MS to RRH intensity ratio and is independent with the individual intensity of either the RRH or the MS. Therefore, without deteriorating the downlink ergodic rate significantly, the number of simultaneously served MSs can be improved by increasing the RRH intensity. Specially, when there is only one RRH in each virtual cell, the analytical expression reduces to the ergodic rate expression for the conventional cellular networks.

        "abstract": "High-speed trains (HSTs) are being widely deployed around the world. To meet the high-rate data transmission requirements on HSTs, millimeter wave (mmWave) HST communications have drawn increasingly attentions. To realize sufficient link margin, mmWave HST systems employ directional beamforming with large antenna arrays, which results in that the channel estimation is rather time-consuming. In HST scenarios, channel conditions vary quickly and channel estimations should be performed frequently. Since the period of each transmission time interval (TTI) is too short to allocate enough time for accurate channel estimation, the key challenge is how to design an efficient beam searching scheme to leave more time for data transmission. Motivated by the successful applications of machine learning, this paper tries to exploit the similarities between current and historical wireless propagation environments. Using the knowledge of reinforcement learning, the beam searching problem of mmWave HST communications is formulated as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem and a bandit inspired beam searching scheme is proposed to reduce the number of measurements as many as possible. Unlike the popular deep learning methods, the proposed scheme does not need to collect and store a massive amount of training data in advance, which can save a huge amount of resources such as storage space, computing time, and power energy. Moreover, the performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed in terms of regret. The regret analysis indicates that the proposed schemes can approach the theoretical limit very quickly, which is further verified by simulation results.",
