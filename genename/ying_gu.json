        "abstract": "The major side-effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT) on port wine stains (PWS) is pain during the treatment. Although several strategies for controlling the pain during topical PDT achieve a reduction in the levels of pain, none were completely effective and convenient. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an oral analgesic for the treatment of pain in PDT on PWS.Fifty-eight patients with PWS on the face were included. The treatment and placebo groups were selected by computer randomization. The patients, doctor and statistician were blinded to the patients' groups. The analgesic contained 5mg of oxycodone in combination with 325 mg of acetaminophen. The patient took the tablet orally 30 min before PDT. The patient was injected intravenously with 4-5mg/kg photosensitizer PSD-007 within 5 min, and then the lesion was exposed to a 532 nm laser immediately for 30-60 min at 100 mW/cm(2). The intensity of the pain during irradiation, the characteristic and beginning time of pain, and adverse effects were recorded. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess the pain.The time of the pain beginning was 8.31 \u00b1 4.58 min in the treatment group and 7.10 \u00b1 3.54 min in the placebo group, which was not significantly different (P=0.266). The VAS score in the treatment group was 7.88 \u00b1 1.52 compared with 8.17 \u00b1 1.12 in the placebo group, with no significant difference (P=0.422). The subgroup of age, gender, lesion location and classification between two groups had similar VAS score (P>0.05). No serious adverse events were reported. This study found that oral oxycodone 5mg/acetaminophen 325 mg was completely ineffective for pain relief, and age, gender, lesion location and classification did not influence the pain perception and the analgesic effect. The challenge of controlling pain during PDT on PWS remains.",

Methods The cancer model was made by subcutaneous injection of S180 ascites on Kunming mice. Six groups were defined as follows: control group,HMME group (10 mg/kg,1 h interval) ,lipidosome-l group (1 h interval) ,lipidosome-6 group (6 h interval) ,mi- cro-emulsion-1 group (1 h interval) and micro-emulsion-6 group (6 h interval). The doses of HB were 1. 5 mg/kg. Photosensitizer was injected via tail vein. The energy density of 532 nm laser was 100 J/cm2 with power density 100 mW/cm2. The cancers were measured before and after treatment, and taken for pathology 7 d later. Results The volumes of cancers have not reduced after PDT. Cancers in HMME group were lightly necrotic. Histological damage was that necrosis presented in skin and shallow cancer with many inflammatory cells around. Dark necrosis appeared on the site of treatment in all mice of both groups with 1 h interval. And necrosis presented in skin and cancer with many inflammatory cells, and some inflammatory cells invaded into cancers without damage. There were 8 mice in the two groups with 6 h interval, and 6 mice of them appeared no necrosis. There was ellipsoidal necrosis in depth of cancer with normal skin and large numbers of inflammatory cells appeared in skin and around necrosis and invaded into cancer without damage. Conclusions Both micro-emulsion form of HB and lipidosome HB have good and similar photodynamic effect, and HB is a potential developed photosensitizer.",

        "abstract": "Elsinochrome A (EA) possesses the highest singlet-oxygen quantum yield (0.98) amongst the perilenoquinoid pigments and may be suitable as a phototherapeutic drug. However, there have been virtually no studies into its medicinal applications. Based on the analysis of chemical derivatives of hypocrellins (the same family as EA), 5-(3-mercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid)-substituted elsinochrome A (MPEA) with an amphiphilicity was designed and synthesized by considering drug delivery and biological activity requirements. MPEA possesses a water solubility of 5.1 mg mL(-1), which is just sufficient to enable dissolution at a clinically acceptable concentration, while its partition coefficient (n-octanol/phosphate buffered saline) of 7 guarantees affinity to biological targets. MPEA could photogenerate semiquinone anion radicals and reactive oxygen species, especially singlet oxygen, at a yield of 0.73, which approaches that for hypocrellin B. Biological tests confirmed that the photodynamic activity of MPEA was as high as 60% of that of its parent EA, which is significantly higher than that of most other photosensitizers.",

Before and 5 min after V-PDT, PWS lesions and the corresponding contralateral healthy skins of 24 PWS patients were scanned, whereas seven PWS patients were scanned throughout V-PDT. V-PDT was conducted immediately after intravenous injection of photocarcinorin (4-5 mg kg(-1)). A 532 nm laser was used for irradiation (power density: 80-100 mW cm(-2), exposure time: 20-50 min). Before V-PDT, all 24 PWS patients demonstrated a significant difference in perfusion between the PWS lesion and the contralateral healthy control skin (1132 \u00b1 724 and 619 \u00b1 478 PU, respectively, P < 0.01). Five minutes after V-PDT, the mean perfusion value of the 24 PWS lesions was 1246 \u00b1 754 PU. There was no significant difference compared to the perfusion before V-PDT (P > 0.05). During V-PDT, the perfusion of seven PWS patients increased rapidly after initiation of V-PDT, reached a maximum within 10 min, lasted for several minutes, and slowly returned to a relatively lower level at the end of V-PDT. On the basis of these results, LSPI is capable of imaging PWS microvasculature and monitoring microvascular reactivity to V-PDT.",

        "abstract": "Lasers of different wavelengths have been used as a photodynamic therapy (PDT) light source in the treatment of port-wine stains. This study attempts to investigate the influence of wavelength on depth of vascular damage using a cock comb model and mathematical modeling/simulation. Monte Carlo simulation was used to calculate the distribution of laser light in skin tissue. A series of equations including the diffusion equation for modeling the distribution of photosensitizers and oxygen, and the photobleaching equation were established to calculate the singlet oxygen generation in PDT. The singlet oxygen generation in comb tissue model with vasculature was simulated with 532- and 627.8-nm laser, respectively. In the animal experiment, the comb was treated using hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) (10 mg/kg dose) as a photosensitizer and lasers of two different wavelengths (532 and 627.8 nm) at an identical power density (100 mW/cm(2), fluence 120 J/cm(2)). The simulation results showed that the 627.8-nm laser was more effective in generating singlet oxygen in blood vessels at deep dermis. The animal experiments showed that the average depth of thrombosis was 1,012.5 \u00b1 647.06 \u03bcm with the 532-nm laser, and 2,204.2 \u00b1 410.35 \u03bcm with the 627.8-nm laser. The results showed that the laser wavelength had a strong effect on the depth of thrombosis in PDT treatment for the comb model. The simulation results were consistent with the animal experimental results.",

Specimens were harvested from scars on postoperative 28 day. Scar hyper plasty and collagen fibers were observed by haematoxylin-eosin staining and Van-Gieson staining respectively. The microvessel density was calculated under microscope.Compared with the controlled group, HMME-PDT treatment in the experimental group reduced scar formation, decreased the microvessel density and prevented excess collagen deposition at the wound site.HMME-PDT may play a role in inhibiting hyperplastic scar in rabbit ear.",

In the experiment for validation of the system, the fluorescence basis spectra of hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME)-sensitized mouse normal skin were constructed, and, by least-square fitting, HMME fluorescence (624 nm) could be discriminated from that of photoproduct (652 nm). The fitting of fluorescence spectra measured from PWS patients skin containing PSD-007 was performed with the same basis spectra as those from the mouse skin. The curves of blood drug level of different patients with significant variance, as well as those of formation and bleaching of photoproduct were obtained.

Every time three signals were measured simultaneously, including the irradiation temperature of surface irradiated point, the inner temperature of about 1mm right under the irradiated point and the environment temperature. To gain temperature data under different conditions, the experiments were grouped by irradiation power and time.Results The inner temperature of about 1mm right under the irradiated point of rat skin tissue was measured, with three different conditions of application continuous Nd\ue5f4\u2236YAG laser,i.e.,the same irradiation time (t=1\ue5f2s) and different power(P=2,3,4,5\ue5f2W);the same power (P=5\ue5f2W) and the different irradiation time (t=0.5,0.8,1.0\ue5f2s), and higher irradiation power(t=0.5\ue5f2s,P=5,10,(15\ue5f2W).)The results showed the temperature increased with irradiation power and time, the temperature response shape was similar and the temperature rise time was correlated with the irradiation time.Conclusions The surface radiation temperatures are much lower than the inner temperature after Nd\ue5f4\u2236YAG laser irradiation, which maybe of less research worth in thermal effect. The inner temperature can reflect the change with laser power and irradiation time, and can be used to verify related model and numerical simulation results.",

        "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been successfully implemented as a treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but very few photosensitizers have been developed for clinical use. Herein, we describe a novel formulation of liposomal hypocrellin B (LHB) that was prepared by high-pressure homogenization. The encapsulation efficiency and PDT efficacy in vitro of this new preparation were found to remain nearly constant over 1 year. Moreover, LHB is rapidly cleared from the blood, with a half-life of 2.319 \u00b1 0.462 h and a very low serum concentration at 24 h after injection. Testing in a rat model of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) showed that leakage of blood vessels in CNV lesions was significantly reduced when LHB PDT was given at a dose of 1 mg kg(-1) along with yellow laser irradiation; the damage to the collateral retina and the retinal pigment epithelium was minimal. Skin phototoxicity assays showed that only two of the 200 mice given a 4 mg per kg dose of LHB experienced an inflammatory reaction in the auricle irradiated at 24 h after dosing. These data collectively indicate that LHB may be a safe and effective photosensitizer for vascular-targeted PDT of AMD.",

Herein, it is demonstrated that the drug delivery and target affinity are achieved by a single chemical compound, hypocrellin B (HB) derivative 6 selected from three novel aminoalkanesulfonic acid HB derivatives, 5-7. 6 exhibits a much higher PDT activity (IC(50) = 22 nM) on human gastric carcinoma BGC823 cells than HB, while it has no cellular toxicity in the dark. On the basis of estimation of the clinically required concentration according to relative PDT activity and clinical criteria, it can be predicted that 6 is directly deliverable to and PDT effective on target cells. The enhanced red absorption and superhigh photoactivity suggest that 6 is more powerful for PDT of tumors than HB.",

To explore their application potentials in two-photon excited photodynamic therapy (TPE-PDT), a series of carboxylate modified benzylidene cyclopentanone dyes were synthesized by varying number of carboxylate groups. Their linear and nonlinear photophysical properties, reactive oxygen yields and in vitro PDT activities were investigated systematically. The results showed that the water solubility of these dyes was significantly enhanced after introducing carboxylate groups. All dyes exhibited large TPA cross-section around 1000-1400 GM at 840 nm. In addition, they could generate both superoxide anion radical and singlet oxygen species under illumination. However, only the dye Y1 modified by one carboxylate group presented strong PDT activity to human rectal cancer 1116 cells, which indicated that moderate water-lipid amphipathy was a very important factor for PDT dyes. Finally, Y1 was proved to have large potential in TPE-PDT by in vitro experiments. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "A number of despeckling methods for optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been proposed. In these digital filtering techniques, speckle noise is often simplified as additive white Gaussian noise due to the logarithmic compression for the signal. The approximation is not completely consistent with the characteristic of OCT speckle noise, and cannot be reasonably extended to deconvolution algorithms. This paper presents a deconvolution model that combines the variational regularization term with the statistical characteristic constraints of data corrupted by OCT speckle noise. In the data fidelity term, speckle noise is modeled as signal dependent, and the point spread function of OCT systems is included. The regularization functional introduces a priori information on the original images, and a regularization term based on block matching 3D modeling is used to construct the variational model in the paper. Finally, the method is applied to the restoration of actual OCT raw data of human skin. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed deconvolution algorithm can simultaneously enhance regions of images containing detail and remove OCT speckle noise.",

In vitro photocytotoxicity of these derivatives toward HepG2 cells was examined and compared with a clinical drug. In vitro generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), cellular uptake, and intracellular distribution of these derivatives were also characterized to fully reveal their structure-property relationships.

Considering both drug delivery and biological activity, surfactant-like hypocrellin B (HB) derivatives, sodium 12-2-HB-aminododecanoate (SAHB) and sodium 11,11'-5,8-HB-dimercaptoundecanoate (DMHB), were first designed and then synthesized in the current work. Both SAHB and DMHB were photoactive, generating free radicals and reactive oxygen species, as confirmed by EPR and chemical measurements. Most importantly, DMHB was not only readily soluble, allowing preparation of an intravenous injection solution at a clinically acceptable concentration, but it was also more photodynamic therapy (PDT) active to human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells than its parent HB under irradiation. The photodynamic activity was exactly identical to the (1)O(2) quantum yield and was not reduced by the improved water solubility, suggesting an independent hydrophilicity or lipophilicity. To our knowledge, this is a new strategy that possesses general significance for converting hydrophobic photosensitizers into clinically usable PDT drugs.",

Methods One patient with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma associated with Candida albicans infection confirmed by endoscopy and histopathology was included in the study.PSD-007 at 5mg/kg body mass was intravenously injected 6h prior to laser irradiation.A semiconductor laser emitting at 630nm was used as light source.The power density of 150mW/cm2 was used.To lesions of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma associated with C.albicans infection or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma alone,the exposure time of 30min and a total light dose of 270J/cm2 was used at one light spot.To lesion with Candida albicans infection alone,the exposure time of 15min and a total light dose of 135J/cm2 were used at one light spot.Endoscopic and histopathologic examination was conducted at least 4 weeks after PDT to evaluate the short-term effect. Results The patient was totally received three sessions of PDT.The esophageal cancer located at 21-24cm from incisors got complete remission(CR) after two PDT sessions,while the C.albicans infection at the same location cured after one PDT session.The lesion at 25-28cm from the incisors with Candida esophagitis was completely disappeared after two PDT sessions.And the esophageal cancer at 35-33cm and 33-30cm from incisors got partial remission(PR) after two and three PDT sessions,respectively.No scar,stenosis,perforation and other adverse reactions occurred in the lesions with C.albicans infection during and after PDT. Conclusions PDT not only can effectively control the progress of esophageal cancer,but also effectively treat the Candida esophagitis.This result suggesting PDT be a highly selective,safe,effective,minimally invasive and promising treatment for patients with esophageal fungal infections,espeically for those associated with esophageal cancer.",

        "abstract": "For making hypocrellins clinically applicable for phototherapy to vascular diseases, it is mainly focused onto finding a derivative which can be transported fluently in blood system but without serious loss of the inherent activity of its parents. Based on this consideration, a novel 17-3-amino-1-propane-sulfonic acid-HB Schiff-base (NSHB) was designed and synthesized in this work. As expected, NSHB is readily dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or any other aqueous solvent in a concentration which is suitable for intravenous injection, while the quite higher partition coefficient (5:1) is beneficial to the affinity to biological targets. Based on EPR measurements, it is proved that the photosensitization activity of NSHB to photo-generate semiquinone anion radicals and superoxide anion radical (O*(2)(-)) is even higher than its parent HB, while the ability to generate singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) is not seriously reduced. In addition, nearly comparable PDT activity to A549 cells for NSHB and HB confirms that the molecular design is successful and NSHB is readily delivered into target tissues via blood circulation after intravenous injection. Furthermore, the quantum yield of (1)O(2) for NSHB is as 12.5 times as that for HB under red light (600-700 nm), which is beneficial to phototherapy to solid tumors.",

Because most biological tissues have the characteristic of high scattering coefficient, OCT system can just obtain the structural images several millimeters below the surface of the tissues. The superficial depth of OCT's penetration limits application in dermatology field. As a common disease, the port wine stain (PWS) is a indication of OCT, because of its superficial lesion and significant expansion of blood vessels. To get deeper penetration in the skin, the authors employed 1 310 nm superluminescent diode as light source, optimized the light intensity ratio of reference delay arm and sample arm and control polarization, and the research of PWS imaging in vivo was accomplished. Besides, OCT is able to gather clear image and key characteristic parameters, such as the depth of epidermis layer, the diameter of blood vessel, etc. OCT will play an important role in the diagnosis and therapy of PWS.",

        "abstract": "Objective To study the effects of photodynamic therapy(PDT)using hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether(HMME),on experimental choroidal neovascularization(CNV)in the Brown-Norway(BN)rat eye. Methods Photodynamic therapy was performed in 21 BN rat eyes with experimental CNV induced by lasei\" injury.HMME was adminis- tered intravenously 15 mg/kg as a bolus.Photodynamic therapy was performed using light at a wavelength of 630 nm,the laser spot size was set at 800-1 000\u03bcm,with an irradiance of 400,600 and 1 000 mW/cm~2 and fluence of 36,54 and 90 J/cm~2.Also HMME was ad- ministered intravenously 30 mg/kg as a bolus.Photodynamic therapy was performed using light at a wavelength of 630 nm,with an irra- diance of 600 mW/cm~2 and fluence of 36,54 and 90 J/cm~2.Follow-up studies,including fundus photography and FA,were performed at 24 hours or 7 days after PDT.Tissues were examined with light microscopy at the end of follow-up.Immunohistochemical visualiza- tion of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule(PECAM)-1 was performed in plain films,then the results were analyzed. Results Rates of closure of the CNV varied as a function of the dose of HMME and of the activating light energy.Angiographic closure of the CNV correlated with damage to the neovascular complex,as seen with light microscopy.Damage to areas of choroid and retina treated with HMME-PDT also varied as a function of the HMME and light energy doses.Endothelial cell labeled by PECAM-1 was present either circular vessel-forming endothelial ceils or flat endothelial cells in the center of the scar.CNV lesions were significantly reduced in size(P<0.05). Conclusions PDT using HMME can effectively occlude CNV.HMME is a potentially useful photosensitizer for the treatment of CNV.",

        "abstract": "To expand the optional laser wavelengths of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for port wine stain (PWS), the feasibility of applying a 457 nm laser to the PDT for infantile PWS was analyzed by mathematical simulation and was validated by clinical experiment. Singlet oxygen yield of 457 nm PDT or 532 nm PDT in an infantile PWS model and an adult PWS model was theoretically simulated. Fifteen PWS patients (14 infants and 1 adult) with 40 spots were treated with 457 nm (20 spots) and 532 nm (20 spots), respectively, in two PDT courses. Simulation results showed that under the same power density and irradiation time, singlet oxygen yield of 457 nm PDT and 532 nm PDT are similar in infantile PWS vessels. Yet, in adult PWS vessels, singlet oxygen yield of 457 nm PDT is lower than 532 nm PDT. Clinical outcomes showed that no statistic difference existed between 457 nm PDT and 532 nm PDT for infantile PWS. The result of this study suggested that 457 nm wavelength laser has the potential to be applied in PDT for infantile PWS.",

The diffuse reflectance spectra of 14 PWS patients were monitored during treatment, and the change trend of oxygen content were analyzed. Results showed that before treatment the oxygen content varies between patients with different type of PWS. During PDT, there was no obvious change in oxygen content for skin of most P4 and P5 PWS, while obvious decline was observed in oxygen content for P6 PWS. The current diffuse reflectance spectroscopy can be used to monitor oxygen content in PWS skin qualitatively and observe the change trend. To get more precise oxygen content in PWS skin, more work is needed to improve the sensitivity of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and a spectra algorithm should be established.",

        "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an approved therapeutic procedure that exerts cytotoxic activity toward tumor cells by irradiating photosensitizers with light exposure to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). An ideal photosensitizer is a crucial element to PDT. In the current study, we evaluated the photodynamic activity of a novel photosensitizer, the derivative of hypocrellin B (HB), 17-(3-amino-1-pentanesulfonic acid)-substituted hypocrellin B Schiff-base (PENSHB), both in vitro and in vivo.Physicochemical characteristics of the novel photosensitizer were compared with that of its parent HB. The intracellular distribution of photosensitizers and mitochondrial membrane potential were detected with laser scanning confocal microscopy. The pathway of cell death was analyzed by flow cytometry. The release of proapoptotic proteins was evaluated by Western blot. S180 tumor model was used to evaluate the antitumor effects of PENHB-mediated PDT.Compared with its parent HB, water solubility of the derivative was improved enormously (6.6 mg/ml vs. 4.6 \u03bcg/ml), rendering its intravenous injection feasible without auxiliary solvent. The derivative had better PDT effect than HB in vitro under similar dark cytotoxicity. Moreover, PENSHB-mediated PDT was able to induce mitochondrial inner membrane permeabilisation, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation and subsequent apoptotic death. In vivo study showed that more than half of tumor bearing mice were cured by PENSHB-mediated PDT.In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that PENSHB is an effective photosensitizer for PDT to tumors. Therefore, PENSHB as a novel photosensitizer has a good prospect of clinical application.",

Methods HeLa cells were subcultured and incubated with HMME for 2 and 12 hours in the situation of different kinds of serum proteins. Labeling technology of fluorescence probes and organelle-cell fluorescence intensity ratio analysis were adopted to study subcellular localization of HMME. Results Comparing cells incubated for 2\ue5f2h with that for 12\ue5f2h, the average fluorescence intensity ratio (J_1/J_2) of HMME of four organelles in group non-serum was all increasing, it was significant for three organelles including mitochondria, ER and Golgi; lysosome's J_1/J_2 of HMME in group albumin(Alb) was increasing more significantly than that of the other three organelles; among the four organelles in group LDL, lysosome's J_1/J_2 of HMME was increasing most significantly, in which the other organelles' increasing extents were apparently greater than that in group Alb.Conclusions At short time, HMME enters cells mainly in the form of dissociating HMME by passive diffusion and distributes in Golgi, mitochondria and ER,less in lysosome. With incubating time prolonging, HMME can be binded with albumin or LDL and enter cells by endocytosis, comparing with each other, HMME binding LDL can easily go through cell membrane than HMME binding albumin and is absorbed by lysosome.",

        "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy(PDT) utilizes jointly photosensitizers,light of appropriate wavelengths and tissue oxygen to selectively destroy target tissues.Being essential to PDT,the availability of molecular oxygen is extremely important for the generation of singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species,which directly determines the therapeutic outcomes.Although monitoring tissue oxygen in vivo and in real time is still technically challenging,various sensitive monitoring techniques have been developed during the past two decades.This review summaries existing techniques for measuring tissue oxygen,and the strengths and limitations of each methodology are discussed in detail.In particular,the emerging optical techniques to monitor tissue oxygen on a non-invasive basis are highlighted,which shows great promise for clinical use.Finally,the main challenges and prospect of clinical tissue oxygen monitoring during PDT treatment are analyzed.",

        "abstract": "Background and Objectives The purpose of this study was to explore the retinal injury thresholds in rabbits and evaluate the influence of retinal pigmentation on threshold irradiance at laser wavelengths of 532, 578, and 630 nm which might be involved in hypocrellin B (HB) and hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) photodynamic therapy (PDT) for choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Materials and Methods The eyes of pigmented and non-pigmented rabbits were exposed to 532, 578, and 630 nm lasers coupled to a slit lamp biological microscope. The exposure duration was 100 seconds and the retinal spot size was 2 mm throughout the experiment. The minimum visible lesions were detected by funduscopy at 1 and 24 hours post exposure. Bliss probit analysis was performed to determine the ED50 thresholds, fiducial limits and probit slope. Results In pigmented rabbits, the 24-hour retinal threshold irradiances at 532, 578, and 630 nm were 1,003, 1,475, and 1,720 mW/cm2, respectively. In non-pigmented rabbits, the 24-hour threshold irradiances were 1,657, 1,865, and 15,360 mW/cm2, respectively. The ED50 for 24-hour observation differed very little from the ED50 for 1-hour observation. The non-pigmented rabbits required a ninefold increase in threshold irradiance at 630 nm comparing to the pigmented rabbits. Conclusion This study will contribute to the knowledge base for the limits of laser irradiance in application of HB or HMME PDT for CNV. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) is a novel and promising second-generation porphyrin-related photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT). To study the effects of HMME PDT on choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in rats, the PDT was performed 20 min after HMME bolus injection, which was investigated prior to the PDT by fluorescence microscopy with laser-induced CNV, and delivered at an irradiance of 400, 600 and 1000 mW cm(-2) corresponding to a fluence of 36, 54, 90 J cm(-2) in PDT plan I (15 mg kg(-1) HMME). In PDT plan II (30 mg kg(-1) HMME), the laser had a constant irradiance of 600 mW cm(-2), which was delivered for 60, 90 or 150 s, to also achieve total energy doses of 36, 54 or 90 J cm(-2). CNV closure rates assessed by fluorescein angiography and histologic damage to treated areas of choroid and retina varied as a function of the dose of HMME and of the activating light energy fluence. Endothelial cell labeled by platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 presented treated CNV lesions that were significantly reduced in size (P < 0.01). It can be concluded that PDT using HMME can effectively occlude CNV. HMME is a potentially useful photosensitizer for the reduction in CNV size of irradiated areas.",

This study was conducted to test the efficacy and safety of V-PDT in the treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding caused by the abnormal dilatation of capillaries.Patients with bleeding GI mucosal vascular lesions treated with V-PDT were included in this retrospective study. The efficiency of V-PDT was analyzed by comparing the documented endoscopy results, hemoglobin levels, and transfusion requirements before and at 6 months after the last V-PDT. Side effects during and after V-PDT and follow-up results were also analyzed.Seven patients with bleeding GI mucosal vascular lesions were treated with V-PDT. After 1-4 V-PDT sessions, all patients no longer needed transfusions to maintain a stable hemoglobin level during the follow-up period of 6 months. The mean hemoglobin level of the seven patients improved from 6.21\u00b11.48 g/dl to 11.66\u00b11.21 g/dl (p<0.001), and the GI bleeding and melena of all the patients disappeared. No perforations, strictures, scars, or episodes of photosensitization occurred in the seven patients, and there were no recurrences of GI bleeding during the 1-21 months of further follow-up.This preliminary study indicated that V-PDT is a highly selective, safe, well-tolerated, and effective treatment modality for bleeding GI mucosal vascular lesions. However, prospective studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm this finding.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate photodynamic effect of hypocrellin B ( HB ) liposome by port wine stains(PWS) in Leghorn cock wattle as an animal model. Methods: Leghorn cocks (n = 14) were divided into the groups of control, laser or drug administration alone and photodynamic therapy ( PDT). The PDT cocks were intravenously injected with HB liposome at 0.25 and 0.5 mg\u00b7kg -1. Two areas with 1 cm diameter on each cock wattle were irradiated by 532 nm laser with the energy density of 60 or 120 J\u00b7cm-2, respectively, after intravenous injection of the photosensitiser. The power density was 100 mW\u00b7cm-2, and exposure time was 10 and 20 min, respectively. Gross appearances were recorded every day, and histological changes were observed 3 and 14 days after photodynamic therapy. Results; Epidermal damage and scabs occurred after treatment with photosensitiser at 0.25 or 0. 5 mg\u00b7kg-1, and wattles whitened obviously at 14 days after scab disappearance. The capillary net of cock wattle was destroyed, and the epidermal cells were proliferated. There was no obvious difference between the effects of both doses. The epidermal damage was obviously poorer after laser irradiation at 60 J\u00b7cm-2 than at 120 J\u00b7cm -2. Color fading was found in both dose groups. Conclusion; HB liposome can damage the capillary net of cock wattle and causes the reversible damage of normal epidermis.",

These photosensitizers are the derivatives of bis(arylidene) cyclopentanone (B2, B3) and bis(arylidene) cyclobutanone (Q1-Q4). The bis(arylidene) cyclopentanone type photosensitizers were found to have larger two-photon absorption cross sections than the bis(arylidene) cyclopentanone ones with the same substituents. The singlet oxygen yields of the bis(arylidene) cyclobutanone derivatives are higher than the data of bis(arylidene) cyclopentanone derivatives. All the studied photosensitizers showed no obvious toxicity under dark situation. One- and two-photon excited PDT activities were successfully demonstrated by in vitro cell experiments. Owing to the capability of destructing the cancerous cells under two-photon irradiation, bis(arylidene)cycloalkanone based photosensitizers with proper substituents can be good candidates for two-photon excited PDT applications in the future. \u00a9 Copyright SPIE.",

Methods Firstly, the principal impact factors that might affect the photobleaching process according to a theoretic photobleaching rate equation were deduced. Then the photobleaching data of HMME were calculated by measuring the absorbance values at different time before and after laser irradiation,and the photobleaching rates of HMME were compared by drawing photobleaching curves (HMME concentration-irradiation time). The main factors that could affect the photobleaching rate of HMME were analyzed by combining the theoretic deduction and experimental results. Results Photobleaching rates of HMME were different in different solutions:albumin solution > DMSO > cells suspension \u2248 PBS. The molar extinction coefficients of HMME at 532\ue5f2nm laser irradiation in different solutions were: \u03b5_ DMSO>\u03b5_ cells-suspension>\u03b5_ albumin-buffer >\u03b5_ PBS. Conclusions Microenvironment of solutions can affect the photobleaching rates. The molar extinction coefficients and concentrations of photosensitizer are the principal impact factors. The photobleaching speeds up with the molar extinction coefficient of photosensitizer increased. Both albumin and DMSO can accelerate the photobleaching of HMME.",

        "title": "Assessment of tissue perfusion changes in port wine stains after vascular targeted photodynamic therapy: a short-term follow-up study.",
        "abstract": "The occlusion effect of vascular targeted photodynamic therapy (V-PDT) for malformed vessels in port wine stains (PWS) often last for some time after the treatment. A relatively longer period after V-PDT is needed to accurately assess the final response of PWS microcirculation to the treatment. In this study, we intended to use laser speckle imaging (LSI) to assess the tissue perfusion changes of PWS at follow-up after V-PDT and preliminarily analyze the relationship between perfusion change and color bleaching. Seventeen patients with 40 PWS lesions were scanned by LSI before and 3-6 months after they received V-PDT. The speckle flow indices of PWS lesions and normal skin before and at follow-up after V-PDT were recorded. We also performed analyses on the correlation between perfusion changes and color bleaching. Before V-PDT, the 40 PWS lesions showed higher perfusion than the normal skin (1,421\u2009\u00b1\u2009463 and 1,115\u2009\u00b1\u2009386 perfusion unit (PU), respectively, P\u2009<\u20090.01). The PWS lesions scanned at follow-up showed decreased perfusion level compared to the preoperative values (1,282\u2009\u00b1\u2009460 and 1,421\u2009\u00b1\u2009463 PU, respectively, P\u2009<\u20090.01). After V-PDT, the perfusion change rates coincide well with the color bleaching rates (correlation coefficient, 0.73). In conclusion, the LSI system is capable of imaging PWS perfusion precisely, and it has shown promising results in assessing the changes of tissue perfusion of V-PDT for PWS, with objective and quantitative data, real-time images, and a shorter detection time. It may also provide an effectiveness assessment method for the treatment of PWS.",

        "abstract": "To obtain an objective assessment of the curative effectiveness of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for port wine stain (PWS), we investigate the relationship between the microvascular perfusion changes of PWS and the blanching of the lesions before and after PDT.Twenty-four patients (18 females and 6 males with a total of 28 lesions) suffering from PWS were treated with PDT. The lesions of various extents were located on the face and neck. After intravenous injection of photosensitizer hepatoporphyrin derivative (HpD), the copper vapor laser was adopted as light source and the lesions of PWS were irradiated. The laser Doppler perfusion imager (LDI) was used to measure the microcirculatory perfusion of PWS before and after PDT and comparison with the normal skin was done.All the lesions showed remarkable decrease of tissue perfusion after PDT. It was shown that the mean, maximal and minimal values of tissue perfusion in the pre-treatment group were significantly higher than those in control group (P < 0.01). Six months after PDT, the mean, maximal and minimal values of perfusion with the lesions were reduced, with significant difference from pre-treatment group (P < 0.01), but no significant difference from control's. The colors of lesions were correlated with decrease of microcirculatory perfusion, which became lightened close to normal skin color without causing any scarring.PDT is one of the most effective modalities for PWS. The microcirculation perfusion can reflect the degrees of PWS objectively. The curative effectiveness of PDT for PWS is due to tissue microcirculation response.",

Biopsies are impractical to implement, therefore, it is necessary to develop non-invasive techniques for morphological evaluation. This study aimed to evaluate the application of a novel optical coherence tomography (OCT) system to characterize the vascular structures of PWSs. First, OCT images were obtained from the skin of healthy rabbit ears and compared with the histopathological images. Second, OCT was used to document the differences between PWS lesions and contralateral normal skin; the size and depth of the vascular structures of two clinical types of PWSs were measured and statistically analyzed. The dermal blood vessels of healthy rabbit ears were clearly distinguished from other tissue. There was no statistical difference between the vascular diameter or depth measured by OCT images and histopathological sections (P>0.05). The OCT images of the PWSs could be distinguished from normal skin. There was no statistical difference in the depth of vessels between the purple-type and the proliferative-type PWSs (P>0.05), while there was statistical difference in the diameter of vessels between them (P<0.01). Therefore, OCT is a promising, real-time, in vivo and non-invasive tool with which to characterize the vascular structures of PWSs.",

METHODS: The experiment was carried out in the laboratory of Department of Laser Medicine, General Hospital of Chinese PLA between June 2004 and March 2005. \u2460 Twelve New Zealand rabbits' muscle in the lower extremity was irradiated by 632.8 nm laser with a power density of 200 mW/cm2 for 15 minutes, which was performed at 5 minutes after photosensitizer PSD-007 (10 mg/kg) was intravenously injected. Macroscopic and light microscopic observations were performed immediately, at 3 days, 3 and 6 weeks after irradiation. \u2461 Twenty New Zealand rabbits were divided into 4 groups with 5 rabbits in each group: high power and high dosage group (power density: 400 mW/cm2, PSD-007: 10 mg/kg), high power and low dosage group (power density: 400 mW/cm2, PSD-007: 5 mg/kg), high power and high dosage group (power density: 200 mW/cm2, PSD-007: 5 mg/kg), high power and high dosage group (power density: 200 mW/cm2, PSD-007: 10mg/kg). In all the four groups, the muscle was irradiated for 15 minutes. Histological characters were observed at 3 weeks after irradiation and the damage depth was measured with micrometer. RESULTS: Totally 32 rabbits were involved in the analysis of results. \u2460 Results of gross observation and pathological characters in the irradiated area: There was no obvious change immediately after irradiation. The irradiated muscular cell became change of degeneration, necrosis and being absorbed subsequently with the inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen proliferation at 3 days after irradiation. \u2461 Measured results of injured depth: The rise of light dose increased the damage depth. The injured depth was the severest in the high power and high dosage group [(3.87 \u00b10.40)mm], but the lightest in the low power and low dosage group [(2.36 \u00b10.33) mm]. The dosage changes had no obviously influence on the injured depth. CONCLUSION: The pathological change in muscle tissue caused by PSD-007-PDT is a reparative process after damage, the depth of which is mainly determined by light dose.",

Irradiation was performed by 532 nm double-frequency Nd : YAG laser at a fluence rate of 100 mW x cm(-2), meanwhile the collection of fluorescence spectra was implemented an by optical multi-channel analyzer (OMA). Utilizing the basis spectra constructed and least-square fitting, the intensity of HMME fluorescence (613 nm), photoproduct fluorescence (639 nm) and autofluorescence can be resolved respectively from the single measured spectrum. The correlation between fluorescence intensity and the concentration of HMME is consistent with linear function at concentrations not exceeding 10 microg x mL(-1). Monitoring the fluorescence spectroscopy during irradiation, three kinds of information were obtained, including photobleaching of HMME, formation and bleaching of photoproduct, as well as variation to fluorescence intensity due to the change of sample optical properties. Product generated by bleaching of photoproduct causes significant in sample optical properties. The implementation of fluorescence spectroscopy measurement and spectral analysis method presented here can be utilized effectively for both ex vivo investigation of photobleaching characteristics of photosensitizer and in vivo monitoring for dosimetry in photodynamic therapy.",

        "abstract": "Objective Using the 578.2 nm laser pulses with pulsewidths of 20-40 ns on the retinas of rabbit eyes with different pigment quantity, to compare the retinal injury thresholds in different rabbit eyes. Methods Thirty-two eyes of 16 gray rabbits and 26 eyes of 13 white rabbits were exposed to the laser with wavelengths of 578.2 nm, with the duration of 100 s and the spot size of 2 mm.The gray rabbits were grouped by density as 435 mW/cm~2,869 mW/cm~2,1 304 mW/cm~2,1 948 mW/cm~2 and 2 898 mW/cm~2.The white rabbits were grouped by density as 869 mW/cm~2,1 304 mW/cm~2,1 593 mW/cm~2,2 174 mW/cm~2 and 3 043 mW/cm~2.The authors examined and scored all laser impact spots in the retina ophthalmoscopically -with fundus photography to identify the evidencte of visible laser effects at 24 h after exposure and to observe the hurted tissues under the fundus pototgraphy and the microscope. Results Under the same laser exposing condition with the wavelengths of 578.2 nm,the duration of 100 s and the spot size of 2 mm, the retina of the gray rabbits was hurted more seriously than the white rabbits. Conclusions At the same expose time and the same light spot diameter,the different pigment quantity of eyes is the very important element to determine the laser retinal biology effect.",

        "abstract": "The phototherapeutic window from 600 to 900 nm is necessary for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of solid tumors, but may not suitable for PDT of some microvascular diseases, like age-related macular degeneration (AMD), because of its deep penetration. Moreover, absorption of some neighboring photoreceptors should be avoided for PDT of AMD. Considering these, yellow-orange light may be a proper phototherapeutic window of AMD. Herein, two novel amino-alkyl-sulfonic acid-substituted hypocrellin B derivatives, 3 and 4 were designed and synthesized. They exhibited the maximal absorption at yellow-orange light, and possessed higher PDT activity than 2, proved by the in vitro or in vivo experiments. Besides, 4 showed much higher PDT activity than 3, ascribed to its higher cellular uptake suggested by its optimized amphiphilicity and liposome-mimic results. And the vascular leakage of 4 was close to 2. Consequently, 4 has great potential for PDT of AMD or other superficial diseases. \u00a9 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

Using this model the theoretical reflectance and fluorescence spectra of PWS at various severity and that of normal skin were obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. The result shows that the severity of PWS, the changes of blood vessel diameter in particular, can be detected by reflectance and fluorescence spectra. When blood vessel diameter increases, both the reflectance and the fluorescence intensity of PWS skin decrease obviously. This suggests that both the reflectance and fluorescence spectra can be applied to diagnose and analyze the severity of PWS and can offer guidance for more efficiently planning clinical therapies of PWS.",

However, PDT for gastrointestinal fungal infection has not been reported. This study was conducted to assess the potential of PDT to deal with esophageal candidiasis.Two male patients with histological evidence of esophageal candidiasis coexisting with esophageal cancer were included in this retrospective study. Both patients were treated with PDT. This treatment was repeated at least 1month after the initial PDT if the patient still had residual cancer or esophageal candidiasis. Short-term efficacy was evaluated on the basis of endoscopy and histology findings. Further follow-up data were obtained from endoscopy results or telephone conversation.The esophageal candidiasis located 21-24cm and 25-28cm from the incisors of case 1 reached complete remission after one and two PDT sessions, respectively. The esophageal cancer coexisting with esophageal candidiasis located 21-24cm from the incisors reached complete remission after two PDT sessions. No recurrence was found at a 14-month follow-up. The esophageal cancer located 30-35cm from the incisors reached partial response after three PDT sessions. Both of the esophageal candidiasis and the coexisting esophageal cancer at 23-26cm from the incisors of case 2 reached complete remission and the esophageal cancer at 34-37cm from the incisors reached complete remission after one PDT session. No recurrence was found at a 24-month follow-up. There were no serious adverse events found in either of the two cases.Results of this preliminary study indicate that PDT may be a potential method to deal with esophageal candidiasis.",

The absorption and emission spectral 4SB and HpD were measured in PBS or mixed 20\u03bcM HSA in PBS.ResultsCompared with the parent, HB, the absorbance of each derivative in tumor phototherapy window (600-900 nm) was remarkably enhanced. The absorption spectra shifted (1-15 nm) toward the red side after HB and its derivatives were bound to HSA.The absorbance intensity was increased. The absorbance of HB rose by 100%.The fluorescence peak of 4SB shifted 20 nm toward the blue side and the intensity was 9 times higher than in PBS. ConclusionsHaving the potential to become valuable photosensitizers, the five hypocrellin derivatives analyzed hereunder are worth further studying.",

        "abstract": "To raise photosensitizer concentration level during the photodynamic therapy process, two new methods of photosensitizer administration were investigated. The first method involves the slow intravenous injection of photosensitizer throughout the first 15\u2009min of irradiation, and the second method involves 30\u2009min fomentation before photosensitizer injection and irradiation. The fluorescence spectra of port wine stain skin were monitored and the therapeutic effect correlated index was calculated with a previously published spectral algorithm. Thirty cases were divided into group A (slow injection of photosensitizer during the first 15\u2009min), group B (fomentation), and group C (control group, traditional injection method), with 10 cases in each group. To analyze the effect of these two new methods, the change of therapeutic effect correlated index values of two photodynamic therapy sessions for each patient were calculated, and the photodynamic therapy outcome was compared. The results showed that the change of therapeutic effect correlated index in group A was slightly more remarkable than that in the control group. The change of therapeutic effect correlated index in group B was similar to that in the control group. Slow injection of photosensitizer during photodynamic therapy has a potential to increase photosensitizer concentration level during photodynamic therapy. However, fomentation before photodynamic therapy has no such potential. There is a need for new methods to be attempted.",

Methods The acute model of dermal hypertrophic scar in the rabbit ear was established.Totally 150 scar wounds were randomly divid- ed into 2 groups:the experimental group received HMME-PDT with different parameters,and the control group received no special treatment.Specimens were harvested from scar wounds on day 28 postoperation.Scar and hypertrophic index(HI) were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Results Compared with the control group,HMME-PDT in the experimental group (photosensitizer dose 10 mg/kg,power density 20 mW/cm~2,energy fluence 5 J/cm~2) reduced scar formation and decreased the HI. Conclusions HMME-PDT may play a role in inhibiting hypertrophic scarring in rabbit ear.The biological effect is determined by dose of photosensitizer,interval of photosensitizer injection and irradiation,power density and energy fluence.",

Methods The BGC-823 cells were incubated with PENSHB,DPROHB or HB in different concentrations.Light-dependent cytotoxicity: cells were irradiated by KTP laser under wavelength 532nm with power density of 20mW/cm2 for 1000s.The cytotoxicity per se: cells were incubated as above without irradiation.Cell survival rates were measured by MTT assay respectively.Cell survival relationship with concentrations based on photosensitisers was plotted and polynomial curved.Light-induced cytotoxicity IC50(50% inhibition concentration) of each photosensitizer was derived.The safety coefficient for the photosensitizers was calculated based on the dark and light-induced cytotoxicity. Results Light-dependent cytotoxicity IC50 of PENSHB,DPROHB and HB was 26.22,28.14 and 48.03 nM,respectively.The statistical difference existed between HB and its derivatives,whereas no such difference was observed between PENSHB and DPROHB.The cytotoxicity per se IC50 of three photosensitizers was 3.42\u30014.20 and 4.48 \u03bcM,respectively,without statistical difference between each other.The safety coefficients of the individual photosensitizer were 130,173 and 93. Conclusions PENSHB and DPROHBP were better in PDT effect on BGC-823 cells and safer than HB.The cytotoxicity perse of three photosensitizers has no difference.",

Using a Sephadex G-25 gel column for fine separation, for the first time we obtain GQDs with either single or double layers. By atomic force microscopy characterization, we confirm that hydrogen peroxide and ammonia play a synergistic role on graphene oxide (GO), in which the former cuts the GO into small pieces and the latter passivates the active surface to give amine-modified GQDs. Due to the low cytotoxicity and excellent biocompatibility of the obtained amine-functionalized GQDs, besides the multiwavelength imaging properties of GQDs, for the first time we find that this kind of GQD exhibits good antimycoplasma properties. Given the superior antimycoplasma effect of the GQDs and their eco-friendly mass production with low cost, these new GQDs may offer opportunities for the development of new antimycoplasma agents, thus extending their widespread application in biomedicine.",

Hypertrophic scar (HS) is a pathological process characterized by fibroblastic hyperproliferation. However, it is unclear whether photochemical interactions between PDT and fibroblasts contribute to a beneficial outcome. To investigate the primary photochemical effects of PDT, we studied the efficacy of 630\u2003nm PDT on human fibroblasts from HS using hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) as a photosensitizer.Fibroblasts were cultured from nontreated HSs, and cells at passage 4-6 were used for the experiments. Morphological and biochemical changes in fibroblasts were assessed by Hoechst 33258 staining and annexin V-FITC/PI flow cytometry (FCM). Caspase-3 activity assay and immunofluorescence staining were performed to investigate caspase-3 expression in fibroblasts.The morphological features of cell apoptosis were viewed under a fluorescent microscope by Hoechst 33258 staining. FCM indicated that the apoptotic rate was significantly increased after HMME-PDT, and caspase-3 activity was observed.Low-level exposure to 630\u2003nm PDT mediated by HMME appears to induce fibroblast apoptosis and stimulate caspase-3 activation. However, the effect of HMME-PDT on fibroblasts needs further investigation to determine its therapeutic potential for HS.",

In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of photodynamic inactivation (PDI) mediated by three Ru(II) polypyridine complexes, 1-3, against four isolates of clinical methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA-1, MRSA-2, MRSA-3 and MRSA-4). In PDI of a planktonic culture of MRSA-1, compound 3 showed the highest efficacy, likely owing to its advantageous light absorption, (1) O2 quantum yield and bacterial cellular binding. The PDI efficacy of 3 was further evaluated against all other strains and MRSA-1 biofilms. At appropriate PS concentrations, viability reduction of 100% or 96.83% was observed in planktonic or biofilm forms of MRSA, respectively. The mechanisms of action were investigated using negative staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was demonstrated that PDI of planktonic bacteria was achieved primarily through damage to the cell envelope. Biofilms were eliminated through both the destruction of their structure and inactivation of the individual bacterial cells. In conclusion, Ru(II) complexes, especially 3, are potential candidates for the effective photodynamic control of MRSA infections.",

Methods Human Gastric Adenocarcinoma Cells(BGC-823) were cultured,and PENSHB or DPROHB having a concentration of 4 \u03bcM was added to the culture medium.Then,they were incubated for different periods.Samples were measured with spectrofluorophotometer to get the curve of relationship between cell content and photosensitizer incubation period.The BGC-823 cells were incubated with PENSHB and DPROHB at different concentrations for 4 hours,then the relationship between the cell content and incubation concentration of the photosensitizers was plotted. Results he absorption curves of PENSHB and DPROHB by BGC-823 were similar.The absorption content increased rapidly in the first hour and the cells reached platform after 4 hours' incubation.Within the concentration range of this experiment,the cell uptake of PENSHB and DPROHB rose with the incubating concentration,revealing a linear relationship and similar rising trend.The content of PENSHB and DPROHB in BGC-823 was dose-dependent and time-dependent. Conclusions Besides better water solubility and photodynamic effects,the two novel hypocrellin derivatives,namely,PENSHB and DPROHB,perform well in cell absorption.They are new photosensitizers with the potential for clinical application.",

Vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective approach in the treatment of PWS. However, due to the arbitrariness of manual operation and pole points existing in laser radiation, the PWS zone was always cured unevenly in clinics. So we developed a novel robotic system which consists of a passive arm and an active wrist, to assist doctors in exerting PDT treatments. The passive joints are easy to interaction with doctors, safer and more convenience; the active joints can automate the PDT so that the doctors can focus more on clinical judgements and treatments rather than heave manual works. In this paper, the mechanism of PWS and its treatments were described in brief, and then the robotic system including the detailed robot mechanical design and kinematic analysis was discussed based on the requirements of PDT. Finally, the robot feasibility was validated by experimental results. \u00a9 2010 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the characterization of absorption of hematoporphyrin monomerthyl ether (HMME), a domestic new generation photosensitizer product, by activated T cells from human peripheral blood. METHODS: Evaluation was performed by flow cytometry on the effects of incubating concentration and time of HMME on absorption by activated T cells. Lymphocytes were separated from human peripheral blood by density gradient centrifugation with Ficoll and T cells were activated with polyclonal stimulators PHA and PDB+Ion. To analyze the effects of HMME incubating doses on the absorption of activated T cells, the cultural lymphocytes were incubated with a serial doses of HMME for 1 h and HMME absorption were measured by FACS after immuno-staining with anti-CD3 antibody. To test the impact of HMME incubating time on the absorption of activated T cells, the cultural lymphocytes were incubated with HMME for various times and HMME absorption were measured by FACS after immuno-staining with anti-CD3 antibody. RESULTS: The HMME absorption-dose curve and absorption-time curve were shifted to right and up in the activated T cells as compared to resting T cells. HMME absorptions of activated T cells were statistic significantly larger than that of resting T cells in the doses between 5 mg/L to 20 mg/L. HMME absorptions of either activated T cells or resting T cells underwent a gradual increase with the incubation-time in HMME at concentration of 10 mg/L. HMME absorptions of activated T cells were statistic significantly larger than that of resting T cells in the incubation-time between 15 to 60 min. CONCLUSION: The differences of HMME absorption between activated T cells and resting T cells depend on the incubation times and doses of HMME. HMME absorption of activated T cells are significantly larger than that of resting T cells in certain incubation-times and doses. These results suggest that incubation time and dose associated with HMME-PDT therapeutic windows will be created for selective deletion of activated T cells.",

Methods A549 lung cancer cells were incubated with HMME for 2,12 and 24 h.Four subcellular organelles were labeled by fluorescent probes,and the fluorescence images of HMME and probes were detected using the inverted fluorescence microscope and cooled CCD.IB/IA was calculated quantitatively,which represents the ratio of HMME fluore-scence intensity in region with high probe fluorescence intensity and in the cell. Results The images showed that,at three incubation times,HMME in both kinds of cells had diffuse distribution in cytoplasm and organelles,with little nuclear stain.The quantitative results showed that arranged in descending order of IB/IA in A549 lung cancer cells at 2 h,they were Golgi,lysosome,mitochondria,and ER in turn.At 12 h,IB/IA was detected from high to low in Golgi,lysosome,ER and mitochondria.At 24 h,IB/IA decreased in Golgi,ER,lysosome,and mitochondria in turn.The IB/IA in Golgi increased with incubation time. Conclusion The characteristics of intracellular distribution of HMME along with incubating time can be more accurately embodied by quantitative analysis than by image observation method.",

Methods Female BALB/c mice were irradiated by 532 nm laser at power density of 50 mW/cm2 for 20 min after intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg HMME immediately. The irradiated skin tissue was harvested and then homogenized in lysis buffer, soluble protein was quantitated and used for surface-enhanced laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry(SELDI-TOF-MS). Results HMME-PDT could significantly affect the mass spectometry expression of irradiated mice skin, the intensity of 7 distinct proteins was found significantly changed compared with control. Among them, 2 proteins were up-regulated and 5 proteins were down-regulated in PDT group and 1 protein was down-regulated in light irradiated group. Conclusions Proteomic analysis of skin following PDT treatment or light irradiation results in significant changing the expression pattern of skin proteins, suggesting involvement of these proteins in the cutaneous response mechanism to PDT stress or temperature stress.",

In this work, 3-amino-1-propanesulfonic acid\n and 4-amino-1-butanesulfonic acid substituted hypocrellin B, named compounds 1 and 2, were designed, synthesized in high yields\n and characterized. Besides greatly strengthened red absorption, the maximum solubility of compound 2 in phosphate buffered\n saline (PBS) is 4.2 mg/mL which is just enough to prepare an aqueous solution for intravenous injection in clinically acceptable\n concentration, while the partition coefficient between n-octanol and PBS, 5.6, benefits the cell-uptake and biological activity\n as well. Furthermore, EPR measurements reveal that the photosensitization activities of the two compounds to generate semiquinone\n anion radicals, superoxide anion radicals and singlet oxygen are a little bit higher than those of taurine substituted hypocrellin\n B (THB), but the photodynamic activities to human lung cancer A549 cells are several times that of THB, mainly due to increases\n in lipophilicity and cell-uptake.",

Methods(1)Spectral properties of hypocrellin derivatives.The absorption spectra of THB,3HB,4HB,3SB,4SB and HB(8 M in PBS and 35 M in DMSO) were measured with UV-vis spectrophotometer respectively.The absorption and emission spectra of fluorescence of 4SB and HpD were measured in PBS or mixed 20 \u03bcM HSA in PBS.(2)Photodynamic activity of novel hypocrellin B derivatives in human lung cancer A549 cells.Treatment conditions,A549 cells were incubated with drug for 4 h.After the incubated cells were irradiated for 24 h,the cells survival was estimated.0.94 nM HB and its derivatives were irradiated with 630 nm and 532 nm laser of 20 mW/cm2 for 1 000 s,after which the cells survival was estimated.A549 cells were incubated with 3SB,4SB and HpD for 24 h and the IC50 of cytotoxin was calculated.3SB,4SB and HpD were irradiated with 532 nm laser and the IC50 was calculated.4SB and HpD were irradiated with 630 nm laser and the IC50 was calculated.A safety factor was used as the ratio of cytotoxic IC50 to phototoxic IC50 to compare the safety of hypocrellin derivatives and HpD under 532 nm and 630 nm irradiation. Results The cell-killing effects of 4SB were stronger than that of other HB derivatives under 630 nm or 532 nm laser irradiation.The dark-cytotoxin sequence was HpD>3SB>4SB(7.84,11.22 and 21.93 \u03bcg/ml),and the dark-cytotoxin of HpD was 2.79 times and 1.42 times higher than that of 4SB and 3SB.The photo-cytotoxin sequence was 4SB>3SB>HpD(103.86\u300184.16\u3001960.14 ng/ml).The photo-cytotoxin of 3SB and 4SB was 10.53 and 11.4 times higher than that of HpD respectively under 532 nm laser irradiation(P>0.05).The Photo-cytotoxin of 4SB(50.7 ng/ml) was 21.2 times than that of HpD(1 069.88) under 630 nm laser irradiation(P<0.05).The safety factor sequence was 4SB(260.6)>3SB(108)>HpD(8.2) under 532 nm laser irradiation and was 4SB(432.5)>HpD(7.3) under 630 nm laser irradiation.Opposite to that of 4SB(P<0.05),the difference between the safety factors of HpD under 532 nm and 630 nm laser is not statistically significant(P>0.05). Conclusions Having the potential to become valuable photosensitizers,the five hypocrellin derivatives are worth further study.",

        "abstract": "We established mathematical models of photodynamic therapy (PDT) on port wine stains (PWS) to observe the effect of drug-light-interval (DLI) and optimize light dose.The mathematical simulations included determining (1) the distribution of laser light by Monte Carlo model, (2) the change of photosensitizer concentration in PWS vessels by a pharmacokinetics equation, (3) the change of photosensitizer distribution in tissue outside the vessels by a diffuse equation and photobleaching equation, and (4) the change of tissue oxygen concentration by the Fick's law with a consideration of the oxygen consumption during PDT. The concentration of singlet oxygen in the tissue model was calculated by the finite difference method. To validate those models, a PWS lesion of the same patient was divided into two areas and subjected to different DLIs and treated with different energy density. The color of lesion was assessed 8-12 weeks later.The simulation indicated the singlet oxygen concentration of the second treatment area (DLI=40 min) was lower than that of the first treatment area (DLI=0 min). However, it would be increased to a level similar to that of the first treatment area if the light irradiation time of the second treatment area was prolonged from 40 min to 55 min. Clinical results were consistent with the results predicted by the mathematical models.The mathematical models established in this study are helpful to optimize clinical protocol.",

HMME-PDT-induced cell death and its mechanisms were investigated in HeLa cells. We demonstrated that HMME-PDT could induce cell death through both necrosis and apoptosis. Sodium azide (the singlet oxygen quencher) or D-mannitol (the hydroxyl radical scavenger) could protect HeLa cells from the apoptosis and necrosis induced by HMME-PDT, showing that reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radical, played a decisive role in HMME-PDT-induced HeLa cells death. Sodium azide or D-mannitol also inhibited HMME-PDT-mediated [Ca2+]i elevation. Cytochrome C (Cyto C) release from mitochondria into cytosol and Caspase-3 activation after HMME-PDT were inhibited by BAPTA/AM (an intracellular calcium chelator). These results demonstrated that ROS generated in HeLa cells by HMME-PDT-induced apoptosis may be through [Ca2+]i elevation which mediates Cyto C release and Caspase-3 activition and initiates the subsequent late stages of apoptosis.",

The concentration of HMME was 1 \u03bcg/ml and 10 \u03bcg/ml. 532 nm Laser was used both as light source for PDT and as excitation light source for HMME fluorescence. During the procedure of PDT, the fluorescence spectrum of the sample was collected, stored in the computer and processed for results.Results The photobleaching process at high concentration was more rapidly than that at low concentration. A new fluorescence peak emerged at 639 nm during the photobleaching process of HMME. According to the variation of the background fluorescence, the photobleaching process could be divided into two stages: (1)in the early stage of laser irradiation,the fluorescence intensity at 613 nm and 674 nm decreased with the prolonging of time, and the fluorescence intensity at 639 nm increased.(2)In the later stage, all the three fluorescence peaks decreased, but the self-background fluorescence increased very quickly, and the intensity at the end of irradiation was 1.45 times of the initial intensity.Conclusions The photobleaching of HMME is a very complicated process, and can be affected by the initial concentration of HMME with generation of photoproduct during this process, and with rebleaching phenomena.",

        "abstract": "Laser Doppler imaging (LDI) and laser speckle imaging (LSI) are two major optical techniques aiming at non-invasively imaging the skin blood perfusion. However, the relationship between perfusion values determined by LDI and LSI has not been fully explored.8 healthy volunteers and 13 PWS patients were recruited. The perfusions in normal skin on the forearm of 8 healthy volunteers were simultaneously measured by both LDI and LSI during post-occlusive reactive hyperemia (PORH). Furthermore, the perfusions of port wine stains (PWS) lesions and contralateral normal skin of 10 PWS patients were also determined. In addition, the perfusions for PWS lesions from 3 PWS patients were successively monitored at 0, 10 and 20 mins during vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (V-PDT). The average perfusion values determined by LSI were compared with those of LDI for each subject.In the normal skin during PORH, power function provided better fits of perfusion values than linear function: powers for individual subjects go from 1.312 to 1.942 (R(2)=0.8967-0.9951). There was a linear relationship between perfusion values determined by LDI and LSI in PWS and contralateral normal skin (R(2)=0.7308-0.9623), and in PWS during V-PDT (R(2)=0.8037-0.9968).The perfusion values determined by LDI and LSI correlate closely in normal skin and PWS over a broad range of skin perfusion. However, it still suggests that perfusion range and characteristics of the measured skin should be carefully considered if LDI and LSI measures are compared.",

Methods The fundi of the New Zealand rabbits were irradiated by 532\ue5f2nm laser with a fluence of 20\ue5f2J/cm~2 within 5 minutes after the HMME intravenous injection of 5\ue5f2mg/kg body weight. The power density was 100, 200, 300 and 400\ue5f2mW/cm~2and duration was 200, 100, 66 and 50 seconds,respectively. The biological effect on the retina and choroid was examined by fundus photography and fluorescein angiography at 6\ue5f2h, 12\ue5f2h, 1\ue5f2d, 3\ue5f2d and 5 d after HMME-PDT. The treated area was resected to perform histological examination when the choriocapillaris occlusion could be identified in fluorescein angiography. Results The selective occlusion of choriocapillaris could be observed at the 5th day after PDT with power density 100 mW/cm~2 and at the 3rd day with 200mW/cm~2 without injury to the surrounding normal retina. The nonselective damage to the retina could be seen at 1st day with 300 mW/cm~2 which could recover at the 3rd day and the choriocapillaris was found to be closed simultaneously. The retinal damage appeared earlier at the 6th hour after PDT with 400\ue5f2mW/cm~2and recovered at the 5th day, meanwhile the occlusion of choriocapillaris and some big choroidal vessels were seen clearly. Conclusions The key factor which determined the photodynamic effect is the power density. The higher the power density is, the earlier the biological effect can be seen and the much more probability of the injury to the surrounding normal retina and big choroidal vessels will happen.",

        "abstract": "Aim: To establish the photodynamic therapy (PDT) plan of cardiac tumor by setting up the perfusion model of rabbit skeletal muscles and observing photodynamic effects on injured skeletal muscles under different administration. Methods: The experiment was performed at the laboratory of the Department of Laser Medicine, General Hospital of Chinese PLA from January to June 2004. A rabbit limb local perfusion model was established. The photosensitizer PSD-007 concentration of local perfusion group was 120 and 240 mg/L, the general perfusion group was administrated with PSD-007(5 mg/kg) intravenously and the control group was only given laser illumination. 632. 8 nm and 532 nm lasers were selected and the irradiation dose was 180 J/cm2. Gross changes were colleted by digital camera, and the morphohistological changes were observed under light microscope immediately and at 3 days after laser irradiation. Results: There was no obvious alteration in skeletal muscles of local perfusion group immediately after laser irradiation, and showed mild or medium-grade damage in a dot- and snip-shaped necrosis at 3 days. The extent of injury in the groups irradiated by 532 nm laser was serious than that in those groups irradiated by 632. 8 nm laser, while the photosensitizer at different concentration played a little role in the injury degree of PDT. All rabbits of general perfusion group showed severe red damage at the irradiated location immediately after irradiation, the irradiated parts by two wavelength lasers showed porcelain-white coagulation necrosis morphologically and histologically at 3 days after irradiation, and the irradiated region with wine necrosis around was severely damaged. While, the control group was not damaged morphologically or under light microscope immediately and 3 days after irradiation. Conclusion: This model may effectually simulate PDT of myocardial tumor after perfusion when the heart beating quitted under systemic circulation. Local perfusion can weaken photodynamic effects after pulse beating stopped, and hypoxia is the most important factor restricting photodynamic effects in such a model.",

Methods The yields of singlet oxygen in blood vessel in a short time in different animal were simulated by mathematical model, and the yields of singlet oxygen in Leghorn Cocks vessel were simulated when the irradiation time was 20 min with 5 min and 60 min drug-light interval separately. 0.2 ml blood was gotten at 0, 5, 15, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 80 min after HMME (10 mg/Kg) was injected intravenously in Leghorn Cocks and was measured by fluorescence spectrophotometer for calculation of HMME concentration. Simultaneity, a square of cock comb (2\u00d72 cm) was randomly irradiated (532nm, 100 mW/cm 2) at 5-25min and another one was irradiated at 60-80 min, and the change was observed by macroscopy and pathology. Results Simulations showed that the yield of singlet oxygen in vessels of different animals varied markedly in a short time and correlated with the concentration of photosensitizer in vessels. The produce of singlet oxygen in cock's blood vessel during 5-25 min PDT is 5.3 times more than that during 60~80 min PDT. Experiments showed that the red color of the square irradiationat 5-25 min was faded, but the color of the square irradiation at 60~80 min had no change. Conclusions The change of HMME concentration in blood vessel during a short time after intravenous injection have a big influence on the PDT microvascular effect. \u00a9 2007 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Many laser wavelengths have been used in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for port wine stains (PWS). However, how these wavelengths result in different PDT outcomes has not been clearly illuminated. This study is designed to analyze which wavelengths would be the most advantageous for use in PDT for PWS. The singlet oxygen yield in PDT-treated PWS skin under different wavelengths at the same photosensitizer dosage was simulated and the following three situations were simulated and compared: 1. PDT efficiency of 488, 532, 510, 578, and 630 nm laser irradiation at clinical dosage (100 mW\u2215cm(2), 40 min); 2. PDT efficiency of different wavelength for PWS with hyperpigmentation after previous PDT; 3. PDT efficiency of different wavelengths for PWS, in which only deeply located ectatic vessels remained. The results showed that singlet oxygen yield is the highest at 510 nm, it is similar at 532 nm and 488 nm, and very low at 578 nm and 630 nm. This result is identical to the state in clinic. According to this theoretical study, the optimal wavelength for PDT in the treatment of PWS should near the absorption peaks of photosensitizer and where absorption from native chromophores (haemoglobin and melanin) is diminished.",

        "abstract": "To study the risk of thermal injury in photodynamic therapy for choroidal neovascularization by calculating the retinal temperature of rabbits, a mathematical model for laser induced thermal effect on retina was developed. Homogeneous layer retinal models of different pigmented rabbits were presented to analyze the light distribution. The finite element method realized by Matlab software was used to solve classical bio-heat transfer model - Pennis equation, in which heat loss due to choroidal blood flow was considered. The retinal temperature was calculated with different laser parameters, including different wavelengths (532nm, 578nm and 690nm), power density (200-1600 mW/cm 2), spot diameter (1mm, 2mm and 3mm) and different pigmented eye fundi. The prediction results showed the retinal temperature increased first, then reached maximum in a few seconds and kept constant during laser irradiation. Once laser exposure ended, the temperature decreased quickly to normal. With the increase of laser power density and spot size, the retinal temperature raised too. The temperature reduced exponentially with the distance from laser spot increased. The maximum temperature of non-pigmented rabbits was lower than that of pigmented rabbits. The temperature induced by 578nm laser irradiation was highest, the next was by 532nm laser and the lowest was by 690nm laser. For current parameters used to treat choroidal neovascularization (690nm, 600mW, 2mm, 83 sec), the maximum retinal temperature calculated was less than 45\u00b0C, which indicating no thermal damage induced.",

        "abstract": "In OCT angiography (OCTA), decorrelation computation has been widely used as a local motion index to identify dynamic flow from static tissues, but its dependence on SNR severely degrades the vascular visibility, particularly in low- SNR regions. To mathematically characterize the decorrelation-SNR dependence of OCT signals, we developed a multi-variate time series (MVTS) model. Based on the model, we derived a universal asymptotic linear relation of decorrelation to inverse SNR (iSNR), with the variance in static and noise regions determined by the average kernel size. Accordingly, with the population distribution of static and noise voxels being explicitly calculated in the iSNR and decorrelation (ID) space, a linear classifier is developed by removing static and noise voxels at all SNR, to generate a SNR-adaptive OCTA, termed as ID-OCTA. Then, flow phantom and human skin experiments were performed to validate the proposed ID-OCTA. Both qualitative and quantitative assessments demonstrated that ID-OCTA offers a superior visibility of blood vessels, particularly in the deep layer. Finally, implications of this work on both system design and hemodynamic quantification are further discussed.",

        "abstract": "Background. Complete fading of port wine stains (PWS) is difficult to achieve with current laser treatments. Photodynamic therapy (Gu's PDT) could offer a very efficient alternative for PWS therapy. Patients and method. 1949 lesions in 1385 patients were treated by PDT. Each patient received an intravenous injection of hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD) or hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) at 3-7 mg/kg. Laser irradiation was performed on a 2 to 8 cm spot size. Different wavelengths (488.0 nm to 578.2 nm) were evaluated with a power density of 50\u223c100 mW/cm 2. Fluences ranged from 90 to 540 J/cm 2. Results. Among the 1942 lesions, PWS clearance was observed in 99.7% of cases. Excellent results were achieved in 128 lesions (6.6%) (100 % clearance), 746 lesions (38.3%) yielded to good results (clearance > 75%), 923 lesions (47.4%) showed moderate results (clearance 50-75%), 145 lesions (7.4%) showed poor results (clearance < 50%) and in 7 lesions (0.3%) no visible change was observed. The pink port wine stains revealed better response to Gu's PDT with only one session. Conversely, purple stains in adult patients required 2 sessions or more. Conclusion. This new PDT technique is effective and highly selective, with almost no risk of scarring.",

The light distribution of He-Ne laser (632.8nm) in human whole blood was simulated. The diameter of the optic fiber used was 400\u03bcm. We referred to the work done by other researchers to determine tissue optical parameters of blood. For the same output laser power of 5mW, our results showed that the highest power density could be more than 6000mW/cm2 using flat end optic fiber. But when using optical fiber coupled with cylindrical light diffuser (the length for light emission =3mm), the highest power density was less than 210mW/cm 2. Increasing the length of light emission could further reduce the highest power density. In summary, the optical fiber coupled with cylindrical light diffuser is a good modality for in vivo light irradiation in whole blood, which can decrease the light intensity and make it more uniformed distributed in blood. It is of great importance to choose the suitable light emission length of optic fiber coupled with cylindrical light diffuser for clinical applications. \u00a9 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.",

The study was designed to compare the difference of light distribution during ILLLT between using flat end fiber and optical fiber coupled with cylindrical light diffuser. Light distribution of He-Ne laser was processed by Monte Carlo model. The laser output was 5 mW. The diameter of both optical fibers was 400 microm. Four tissue optical parameters were chosen for simulation. The results showed that optical parameters of blood are important to determine the distribution of laser energy. The highest power density could increase to over 5000 mW/cm2 using flat end fiber. And the laser energy was absorbed by the blood cells in very small area before the tip of flat end fiber. But when using optical fiber coupled with cylindrical light diffuser, the highest power density was about 100 mW/cm2. More volume of blood cells could be irradiated by laser light. In summary, optical fiber coupled with cylindrical light diffuser is superior to flat end fiber at the aspect of increasing the volume of irradiated blood and decreasing unwanted damage to blood cells during intravascular low level laser therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background: Benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid A ring (BPD-MA), as the photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for senile macular degeneration (SMD), can not be widely accepted in China because of its higher price. The biological effect of domestic photosensitizer hypocrellin B (HB) PTD system on retina and choroid was accessed in our study, to explore the worthiness of further study on the prospect of HB in treating SMD. Objective: To introduce an experimental system to perform PDT irradiation system, the determination of the photosensitivity of the photosensitizers in vitro and evaluation of the therapeutic effect of photosensitizers for the retina and choroids in vivo. Design: An open trial. Setting, materials and intervention: The trial was conducted in the Department of Laser Medicine, General Hospital of Chinese PLA. Establishment of irradiation system: a laser window was created at the slit lamp microscope, which connected with 532 nm-laser in order to make the laser and the irradiation light of the slit lamp microscope to arrive at the fundus oculi at the same time. The photosensitivity of the photosensitizer was determined primarily by Methyl-thialolyl-tetrazolium (MTT) and compared with that of BPD-MA. Using chinchilla rabbits as subjects, the system was testified by domestic photosensitizer hypocrellin B photodynamic therapy (HB-PDT), whose biological effects at the irradiated area of rabbit were evaluated by fundus observation, fluorescein angiography and light and electron microscopy examination to investigate the feasibility and reliability of our experimental system. Main outcome measures: The coupling efficiency between slit lamp microscope and laser, in vitro photosensitivity of photosensitizer and their biological effects at the irradiated area. Results: The output of the laser was stable and the coupling efficiency between the laser and laser window of the slit lamp microscope was about 60%. The photosensitivity of HB in vitro was similar to BPD-MA, and HB-PDT displayed selective therapeutic property presented by closure of the retinal and choroidal capillaries with less damage to surrounding normal retina. Conclusion: It is useful to decide if a new photosensitizer fit for treating retinal and choroidal neovascularization by using the irradiation system and the method of determining the photosensitivity of the photosensitizer in vitro and biological effect in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Characterizing port wine stains (PWS) with its optical parameters [i.e. absorption coefficient (\u03bca) and reduced scattering coefficient (\u03bcs\u2032)] and microvascular parameters [i.e. blood volume fraction (BVF), mean vessel diameter (MVD), and oxygen saturation (StO2)] is extremely important for elucidating the mechanisms for its light-based treatments, such as pulsed dye laser and photodynamic therapy. In this study, a customized diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) probe with an appropriate source-detector distance was used to measure the diffuse reflectance spectra of PWS lesions in clinical practice. The results demonstrate that optical parameters of different types of PWS lesions can be accurately extracted by fitting the DRS with diffusion equation. Since the sampling depth of the probe coincides with the depth distribution of abnormal vasculature in PWS, the obtained microvascular parameters of PWS lesions that changed from pink to purple are in agreement with the corresponding physiological conditions. This study suggests that DRS can be utilized to quantitatively determine the optical and microvascular parameters of PWS lesions, which have the potential for planning the protocol and predicting the efficiency for light-based PWS treatments.",

        "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a common skeletal disease characterized by bone loss and subsequent increased risk of fragility fractures. Recent advances in our mechanistic understanding of molecular communications among osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes give insight into the important roles of the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway in the process of bone remodeling. Due to the translation of the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway in the regulation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, new targets have been studied in recent years, such as sclerostin and receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL). In this review, we first introduce the signaling pathways involved in interactions among osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes. Next, we describe clinical trials of denosumab and romosozumab, which are monoclonal antibodies that target RANKL and sclerostin, respectively. We analyze the efficacy of these drugs and provide a profile for the management of osteoporosis.",

The PA probe, with light-sound confocal excitation and reception, is specially designed, and integrated with an objective lens, an ultrasound transducer, and an inverted-triangle coupling cup to facilitate convenient implementation in a clinical setting. The PA dermoscope was utilized for noninvasive and high-resolution imaging of epidermal and dermal structure in volunteers. The imaging results demonstrated that the characteristic parameters of skin disease, including pigment distribution and thickness, vascular diameter, and depth, can be obtained by the PA dermoscope, confirming that PA dermoscopy can serve as a potential tool for the diagnosis and curative effect evaluation of human skin disease.

        "abstract": "Objective To observe the effect of HMME-PDT on the expression of Cytochrome C in human hypertrophic scar fibroblast (HSF). Methods Fibroblasts were cultured from untreated burn hypertrophic scars, and the cells of the 4th-6th generations were used in the experiment. Having grown to the level of 80% confluence, the fibroblasts were divided into 2 groups: the control (untreated) group and HMME-PDT group. For the HMME-PDT group, the medium was removed, serum-free medium with 4 \u03bcg/ml HMME was added, and the cells were given HMME for 4 h. The cells were then irradiated with 630 nm light produced by a diode laser (630 nm) at a power of 10 mW/cm2 (fluence: 2.5 J/cm2). Immunofluorescence staining method was applied for the observation of Cyc expression in HSF with fluorescence microscope. The apoptotic rate of the cells was detected with FCM after popodium iodide (PI) staining. Results Being almost negative in the control group, the Cyc-FITC staining result was highly enhanced in the HMME-PDT group. The detection results of FCM indicated that the apoptotic rate grew significantly after the HMME-PDT (30.54\u00b13.78% VS 2.45\u00b10.22%,P<0.05). Conclusions The mitochondria dysfunction caused by PDT may play a major role in leading the apoptosis of hypertrophic scar cells.",

        "abstract": "5-aminolevulinic acid mediated PDT (5-ALA-PDT) is an approved therapeutic procedure for treating carcinomas of the cervix. However, when employed as a monotherapy, 5-ALA-PDT could not produce satisfactory results toward large and deep tumors. Therefore, developing a method to improve the efficacy of 5-ALA-PDT becomes important. In this study, we demonstrate an enhanced antitumor effect of 5-ALA-PDT by the modulation of mitochondrial morphology. The mitochondria in the cells were regulated into tubular mitochondria or fragmented mitochondria through over expression of Drp1 or Mfn2. Then these cells were treated with identical dose of 5-ALA-PDT. Our results suggest that HeLa cells predominantly containing fragmented mitochondria were more sensitive to 5-ALA-PDT than the cells predominantly containing tubular mitochondria. The morphology of mitochondria changed as the cell cycle progressed, with tubular mitochondria predominantly exhibited in the S phase and uniformly fragmented mitochondria predominantly displayed in the M phase. Paclitaxel significantly increased the population of M-phase cells, while 5-fluorouracil significantly increased the population of S-phase cells in xenograft tumors. Furthermore, low-dose paclitaxel significantly increased the antitumor effects of PDT. However, 5-fluorouracil didn't improve the antitumor effects of PDT. These results demonstrated an enhanced antitumor effect of 5-ALA-PDT from the modulation of mitochondrial morphology. We anticipate that our results will provide an insight for selecting potential chemotherapeutic agents to combine with PDT for tumor treatment.",

The FLCS-PAD was utilized for non-invasive and high-resolution imaging of epidermal conditions in Cafe-au-lait macules patients. Image results demonstrated that there was a significant difference between normal and Cafe-au-lait macules skin (p u003c 0.05). By implementing a fast linear confocal scanning mode, an individualu0027s photoacoustic pathological section can be quickly obtained with clinical score in \u223c1 s.

In this study, the fundamental mechanisms of vascular responses during and after V-PDT will be introduced. Based on the V-PDT treatment of blood vessels in dorsal skinfold window chamber model, the structural and functional imaging, which including white light microscopy, laser speckle imaging, singlet oxygen luminescence imaging, and fluorescence imaging for evaluating vascular damage will be presented, respectively. The results indicate that vessel constriction and blood flow dynamics could be considered as the crucial biomarkers for quantitative evaluation of vascular damage. In addition, future perspectives of non-invasive optical imaging for evaluating vascular damage of V-PDT will be discussed.",

Their photophysical and photochemical properties and in vitro antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (PDI) were investigated. M2, modified with two carboxylic acid salts, was unstable in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The four other PSs all showed higher binding/uptake to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), A. baumannii and C. albicans compared with the clinical drug methylene blue (MB), except for M1 to A. baumannii. Furthermore, the three cationic PSs (M3\u2013M5) exhibited equivalent antibacterial PDI efficacies against MRSA and A. baumannii compared with MB. The antifungal efficacies of M4 and M5 to C. albicans were both significantly higher than that of MB, especially for M5, indicating that the quaternary ammonium-salt-modified coumarin derivative has substantial potential for antifungal PDI.",

        "abstract": "Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely used in treatment of gastric cancer, but still lacking large sample controlled trial to evaluate its efficacy.To analyze the prognostic factors of 220 elderly patients with gastric cancer, and to further study the efficacy of an herbal formula for invigorating spleen and it modifications based on syndrome differentiation of TCM in treatment of gastric cancer in elderly patients and the influence on prognosis.A total of 220 elderly patients aged 65 years or over with gastric cancer from Longhua Hospital of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Renji Hospital and Ruijin Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical College were prospectively enrolled. All patients were assigned to either traditional Chinese herbal medicine (TCHM) group (89 cases) or non-TCHM group (131 cases). Patients in the TCHM group were treated with an herbal formula for invigorating spleen plus chemotherapy, while patients in the non-TCHM group were only treated with chemotherapy.Univariate and Cox regression analyses were performed to determine all the potential prognostic factors. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to assess the differences in survival time between TCHM group and non-TCHM group after stratification for TNM stage, surgery or chemotherapy.The 220 eligible patients were histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach from 2001 to 2007. Eighty-nine cases in the TCHM group received three or more months of TCHM treatment, and 131 cases in the non-TCHM group did not receive TCHM treatment. Cox regression analysis suggested that the TNM stage, radical resection, three or more treatment cycles of chemotherapy, and TCHM treatment were independent prognostic factors (P<0.01). The patients receiving TCHM treatment demonstrated better prognosis than the other prognostic factors in multivariate analysis; the odds ratio [Exp(beta)] of overall group was 0.322, and 95% confidence interval (CI) was from 0.212 to 0.489. Median overall survival of TCHM group was 41.129 months, and one-, three-, and five-year survival rates were 85.2%, 55.6% and 45.7% respectively. Median overall survival of non-TCHM group was 17.195 months, and one-, three-, and five-year survival rates were 63.9%, 26.9% and 21.9% respectively. In stratification analysis of stage for 96 patients who did not accepted radical resection or suffered from recurrence and metastasis (36 cases in the TCHM group, and 60 cases in the non-TCHM group), Cox regression analysis suggested that three or more treatment cycles of chemotherapy and TCHM treatment were independent prognostic factors for improving survival respectively (P<0.01). The hazard ratio [Exp(beta)] of TCHM in stratification for late stage was 0.421, and 95% confidence interval was from 0.255 to 0.693. Median overall survivals were 17.819 months for TCHM group and 8.548 months for non-TCHM group. In stratification analysis of surgery and chemotherapy for 102 patients with Ib-IV (M0) who accepted radical resection (R0 resection) and three or more treatment cycles of chemotherapy (33 cases in the TCHM group, and 69 cases in the non-TCHM group), the disease-free survival and overall survival did not reach the median at the time of analysis. In the TCHM group, one-, three-, and five-year disease-free survival rates were 97.0%, 59.9% and 50.4%, and one-, three-, and five-year survival rates were 100.0%, 74.1% and 61.4%, respectively. In the non-TCHM group, one-, three-, and five-year disease-free survival rates were 82.6%, 51.1% and 51.1%, and one-, three-, and five-year survival rates were 86.9%, 55.6% and 55.6%, respectively.The herbal formula for invigorating spleen has an important value for improving the prognosis of elderly patients with gastric cancer. This herbal formula show survival benefit for advanced gastric cancer in elderly patients. The influence of TCHM on disease-free survival and overall survival of postoperative gastric cancer in elderly patients need to be further evaluated.",

Then the nude mice in each transplantation model were divided into the same three groups which were WCAD-treated group with WCAD 0.5 ml/d taken orally, 5-FU-treated group with 5-FU 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally injected weekly and untreated control group with physiological saline 0.5 ml/d taken orally. The growth-inhibiting rates of transplant tumors were detected and the metastatic lesions were examined in the orthotopic transplant mouse model while PCNA-positive rate and apoptotic index (AI) were observed in the subcutaneous transplant mouse model.The growth-inhibiting rates in the WCAD-treated and 5-FU-treated groups of orthotopic transplant mouse model were 40.82% and 37.92% respectively whereas those of subcutaneous transplant mouse model were 48.70% and 60.10%. The incidence rates of metastasis in perigastric lymph notes, lymph nodes in the porta hepatis, liver, diaphragm and peritoneum in the WCAD-treated and 5-FU-treated groups were lower than those in the untreated control group, and the total metastasis rates in the WCAD-treated, 5-FU-treated and the untreated control groups were 30.77%, 28.57% and 71.43% respectively with significant differences (P<0.05). The total PCNA-positive rates in the WCAD-treated and 5-FU-treated groups were obviously lower than that in the untreated control group (P<0.05 or P<0.01) while the AI was higher than that in the untreated control group (P<0.01). The growth-inhibiting rate, total PCNA-positive rate and total metastasis rate in the WCAD-treated group had no significant differences as compared with those in the 5-FU-treated group, but the AI in the WCAD-treated group was significantly higher than that in the 5-FU-treated group (P<0.05).WCAD has the inhibiting effects on tumor growth and metastasis of gastric cancer which is orthotopic implanted onto nude mice.

        "abstract": "Background: Wei Chang An (WCA) decoction (Chinese herb medicine preparation) could increase the 3-year survival rate of patients with advanced gastric cancer and could enhance apoptosis and suppress tumor cell proliferation in human gastric cancer subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice. Aims: To appraise the inhibitory effects of Wei Chang An on the growth and metastasis of orthotopic transplanted gastric cancer SGC-7901 in nude mice and to study its effect on tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis induction. Methods: The stability of WCA preparation was monitored by HPLC. Orthotopic transplanted gastric cancer SGC-7901 model was used to evaluate the inhibitory effects of WCA on tumor growth and metastasis. Tumor cell proliferation was assessed by PCNA and apoptotic index was determined by TUNEL technique. Results: The tumor inhibition rate of WCA in this model was 40.8%. The total metastasis rate was 30.8% in WCA group, whereas it was 71.4% in the normal saline control group. The liver metastasis rate in WCA group was 7.7%, much lower than that in the control group (50.0%, P<0.05). The PCNA positivity rate and total positivity rate in the treatment group (51.0%\u00b111.4% and 60.4%\u00b113.3%) were significantly less than those in the control group (61.6%\u00b111.6% and 74.4%\u00b17.9%, P=0.0287 and P=0.0029). The apoptotic index was much higher than that in the control group (17.3%\u00b18.9% vs. 7.8%\u00b13.0%, P=0.0010). Conclusions: WCA decoction has inhibitory effect on the growth and metastasis of orthotopic transplanted gastric cancer SGC-7901 in nude mice. The mechanism is probably related to its inhibitory effect on tumor cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in vivo.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the mechanism of Chinese herbal recipe Weichang'an (WCA) in inducing cell apoptosis of human gastric cancer grafted onto nude mice.The high performance liquid chromatography was used for monitoring the stability of WCA. A human gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901 grafted in nude mouse was used as the animal model. The mice were divided into untreated group and two experimental groups. Animals in the two experimental groups received either WCA over a 34-day period or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) over a 6-day period starting at the 8th day after grafting. Animals in the untreated group received normal saline on an identical schedule. Animals were killed 41 days after being grafted. To assess the effect of the treatment on tumor, the tumor weight was determined by the electron balance immediately after the animals were killed. SP immunohistochemical method was used to detect the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in grafts. Apoptotic indices (AI) of the tumor cells were examined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate fluorescence nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. SP method was also used to detect the expressions of cleaved caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9. SYBR green dye I real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (real-time quantitative [corrected] PCR) was used to assess the related gene alterations in mRNA level. The expressions of phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705) and bcl-2 proteins were detected by using SP method.Compared with the untreated group, tumor growth was significantly inhibited by treatment of WCA or 5-FU (P<0.01, respectively). The tumor inhibition rate in the WCA-treated group was 48.70% and that in the 5-FU-treated group was 60.10%. The average labeling index (LI) for PCNA in the WCA-treated group and 5-FU-treated group was significantly decreased as compared with that in the untreated group, respectively. The AI of human gastric cancer grafted in the nude mice detected by using TUNEL method was significantly increased to (9.72+/-4.51)% in the WCA-treated group, while it was (2.45+/-1.37)% in the untreated group. 5-FU-treated group was also found a significantly increased AI compared with the untreated group. The expressions of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9 in the WCA-treated group and 5-FU-treated group were significantly increased as compared with those in the untreated group. But caspase-8 showed no significant alteration either in the WCA-treated group or in the 5-FU-treated group. The expression levels of Stat3 (2(-)delta delta C(T))=0.16) and bcl-2 (2(-)delta delta C(T))=0.10) detected by using real-time quantitative [corrected] PCR were lower in the WCA-treated group than those in the untreated group. The expressions of phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705) and bcl-2 in the WCA-treated group were significantly decreased as compared with those in the untreated group.Chinese herbal recipe WCA can inhibit gastric cancer cell SGC-7901 growth in vivo, induce gastric cancer cell apoptosis and suppress the cell proliferation. WCA induces apoptosis through the caspase-9 and caspase-3 pathway in vivo. Its mechanism might be involved in the down-regulation of Stat3 and bcl-2 genes.",

        "abstract": "To examine the effect of Weichang'an (WCA) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on colorectal tumor and hepatic metastasis in a mouse model.Quantitative determination of hesperidin, the effective component in WCA decoction, was performed using HPLC. In vitro cytotoxicity of WCA was determined by treating HCT-116 cells with WCA diluents or serum extracted from rats that received WCA by oral gavage for 1 wk and MTT assays. Forty-eight nude mice received cecum implantation with tumor blocks subcutaneously amplified from human colon cancer cell line HCT-116. Mice were randomly divided into four treatment groups: control (CON), WCA, 5-FU and combination (WCA+5-FU). Pathological examination of tumors consisted of tissue sectioning and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Tumor weight and size were measured, and the number of metastatic lesions was counted. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was determined by ELISA. The expression levels of tumor genesis and metastasis-related proteins \u03b2-catenin and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-7 were measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Cell fractionation was used to investigate intracellular distribution of \u03b2-catenin.Parenchymal tumors were palpable in the abdomens of nude mice 2 wk post-implantation and orthotopic tumor formation rate was 100% in all groups. 5-FU treatment alone significantly decreased tumor weight compared to the CON group (1.203\u00b10.284 g vs 1.804\u00b10.649 g, P<0.01). WCA treatment alone reduced the rate of metastasis (50% vs 100%, P<0.05). Combination treatment of WCA+5-FU was the most effective, reducing the tumor weight (1.140\u00b10.464 g vs 1.804\u00b10.649 g, P<0.01) and size (1493.438\u00b1740.906 mm3 vs 2180.259\u00b1816.556 mm3, P<0.05), the rate of metastases (40% vs 100%, P<0.01), and serum CEA levels (31.263\u00b17.421 \u03bcg/L vs 43.040\u00b111.273 \u03bcg/L, P<0.05). Expression of \u03b2-catenin and MMP-7 was decreased in drug-treated groups compared to controls, as detected using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting, respectively. Cell fractionation assays revealed that nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin was reduced by WCA and/or 5-FU treatments.Combination of WCA with 5-FU significantly inhibited colon tumor growth and hepatic metastases. Decreased expression of \u03b2-catenin and MMP-7 may be important.",

This study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanism of WCA in treatment of gastric cancer by cDNA array, real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical technique. Method: A human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line SGC-7901 grafted onto nude mouse was used as the animal model. The mice were divided into 3 groups, one control and the two representing experimental conditions. Animals in the two experimental groups received either WCA over a 34-day period or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) over 6-day period starting at 8th day after grafting. Control animals received saline on an identical schedule. Animals were killed 41 days after being grafted. To assess the effect of therapy tumor weight was determined by a electron balance immediately after the animals killed. SP immunohistochemical method was used to detect the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in xenografts. For detection of apoptotic cells, apoptotic indices (AI) were examined by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate fluorescence nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. SP method was also used to detect the expression of cleaved Caspase-3. The expression profiles in paired WCA treated gastric cancer samples and the N. S. control samples were studied by using a cDNA array representing 14, 181 cDNA clusters. The alterations in gene expression levels were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR. SP method was used to detect the expression of Phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705) and bcl-2. Result: When compared with controls, tumor growth was significantly inhibited by treatment with the WCA or 5-FU (P <0. 01, respectively). The average of tumor inhibitory rate in WCA group was (44.32\u00b15.67)% and 5-FU (47. 04 \u00b1 11. 33)%. The average labeling index (LI) for PCNA in WCA group and 5-FU group was significantly decreased compared with the control group respectively. AI of human gastric cancer xenografts in nude mice was significantly increased to (9. 72 \u00b14. 51 )% using TUNEL method in WCA group compared with the controls (2. 45 \u00b1 1. 37)%. 5-FU group was also found a significantly increased AI compared with the controls. The expression of cleaved Caspase-3 in WCA group and 5-FU group was significantly increased compared with the control group respectively. There were 45 different expression ESTs among the control sample pool and WCA sample pool. There were 24 ESTs up-regulated in WCA samples and 21 ESTs down-regulated. These 45 ESTs contains 35 cloned genes and 11 unknown ESTs. By using Real-time Quantitative PCR, the expression level of Stat3 (2-\u0394\u0394CT = 0. 16), RIPX (2 -\u0394\u0394CT = 0. 18), ROD1 (2-\u0394\u0394CT = 0. 23) and bcl-2 (2-\u0394\u0394CT = 0. 10) was lower in WCA group than that in control group respectively. The expression of Phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705) and bcl-2 in WCA group and 5-FU group was significantly decreased compared with the control group respectively. Conclusion: Chinese jianpi herbal recipe WCA could inhibit gastric cancer cell SGC-7901 growth in vivo. WCA could induce gastric cancer cell apoptosis and suppress proliferation. Its mechanisms might be involved in the down-regulation of Stat3, RIPX, ROD1 and bcl-2 gene.",

In this paper, we report the X-ray crystal structures of the p24 protein from natural HIV-1 strain (BMJ4) in complex with Fab A10F9, which recognizes a conserved epitope in the C-terminal domain of the BMJ4 p24 protein. Our structures reveal a novel shoulder-to-shoulder p24 dimerization mode that is mediated by an S-S bridge at C177. Consistent with these structures, the shoulder-to-shoulder dimer that was obtained from the BMJ4 strain was also observed in p24 proteins from other strains by the introduction of a cysteine residue at position 177. The potential biological significance was further validated by the introduction of a C177A mutation in the BMJ4 strain, which then displays a low infectivity. Our data suggest that this novel shoulder-to-shoulder dimer interface trapped by this unique S-S bridge could represent a physiologically relevant mode of HIV-1 capsid assembly during virus maturation, although Cys residue itself may not be critical for HIV-I replication.",

        "abstract": "The production of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) is a major goal in the development of an HIV-1 vaccine. The membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of gp41, which plays a critical role in the virus membrane fusion process, is highly conserved and targeted by bNAbs 2F5, 4E10, and 10E8. As such, MPER could be a promising epitope for vaccine design. In this study, diphtheria toxin domain A (CRM197, amino acids 1-191) was used as a scaffold to display the 2F5 and 4E10 epitopes of MPER, named CRM197-A-2F5 and CRM197-A-4E10. Modest neutralizing activities were detected against HIV-1 clade B and D viruses in the sera from mice immunized with CRM197-A-4E10. Monoclonal antibodies raised from CRM197-A-4E10 could neutralize several HIV-1 strains, and epitope-mapping analysis indicated that some antibodies recognized the same amino acids as 4E10. Collectively, we show that 4E10-like antibodies can be induced by displaying MPER epitopes using an appropriate scaffold. These results provide insights for HIV-1\u2009MPER-based immunogens design.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a non-enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus, is transmitted in a faecal-oral manner, and causes acute liver diseases in humans. The HEV capsid is made up of capsomeres consisting of homodimers of a single structural capsid protein forming the virus shell. These dimers are believed to protrude from the viral surface and to interact with host cells to initiate infection. To date, no structural information is available for any of the HEV proteins. Here, we report for the first time the crystal structure of the HEV capsid protein domain E2s, a protruding domain, together with functional studies to illustrate that this domain forms a tight homodimer and that this dimerization is essential for HEV-host interactions. In addition, we also show that the neutralizing antibody recognition site of HEV is located on the E2s domain. Our study will aid in the development of vaccines and, subsequently, specific inhibitors for HEV.",

        "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been a global epidemic since 1983; yet, the virology and immunology related to HIV-1 remain elusive. Furthermore, as there is still no effective chemoprophylaxis or vaccine to treat patients with HIV-1, most research focuses on strategies to prevent HIV-1 infection, such as with antiviral drugs, novel therapeutics, or improved diagnostic kits. The HIV-1 Gag precursor protein (p55)\u2014comprising the matrix (MA/p17), capsid (CA/p24), and nucleocapsid (NC/p7) protein domains\u2014is the main structural HIV-1 protein, and is uniquely responsible for virion assembly within the virus life cycle. Recently, the immature and mature capsid structures were solved; however, the precursor protein structure is still unknown. Here, we expressed two subtypes of HIV-1 MA\u2013CA stretch of the Gag protein, referred to as p41, in a bacterial expression system. We characterized the purified p41 protein, and showed its superior antigenicity over that of p24, highlighting the potential influence of the p17 domain on p24 structure. We further showed that p41 has good immunogenicity to induce an antibody response in mice. These results will aid future investigations into the HIV-1 capsid precursor structure, and potentially contribute to improving the design of diagnostic kits.",

In this study, the secondary and possibly higher structural orders of the peptide mimics 122 and 125 were investigated and found to be closely related to the specific binding with 8H5 mAb. These two peptide mimics were fused to three different carrier proteins, and the antibody binding activities were recovered in 4 of the 11 fusion proteins. HEV structural protein p239 and HBc were more suitable than the outer membrane protein T47 of the Treponema pallidum particle for the recovery of reactivity. The increase in the copy number of peptide mimics was important for the recovery of antibody-binding activity and the interaction between peptide and carrier protein may affect the spatial structure of both the peptide and the carrier protein. These results are likely to be of relevance for conformational peptide mimics in diagnostic tests, vaccine and inhibitors.",

ELISA, Western blot and animal immunization were used to analyze the antigenicity and immmunogenicity of purified particulate antigens. The ability to capture HBV by antibodies elicited by chimeric particles was detected with immuno-capture PCR.Recombinant antigens CI, CII, CIII carrying 1-3 copies of HBV preS1 (21-47) individually could form virus-like particles (VLPs), similar to HBcAg in morphology. But recombinant antigens carrying 4-6 copies of HBV preS1 (21-47) were poorly expressed in E.coli. Chimeric antigens were lacking of immunoreactivity with anti-HBc monoclonal antibodies (McAbs), but still reserved good immunoreactivity with anti-HBe McAbs. CI, CII, CIII could strongly react with anti-preS1 McAb, suggesting that preS1 (21-47) fragment was well exposed on the surface of chimeric VLPs. Three chimeric VLP antigens (CI, CII and CIII) could stimulate mice to produce high-level antibody responses, and their immunogenicity was stronger than non-particulate antigen 21-47*6, containing 6 copies of preS1 (21-47). Mouse antibodies to CI, CII and CIII were able to capture HBV virions in immuno-capture PCR assay in vitro.Chimeric particulate antigens of receptor binding site-core antigen of HBV can elicit strong antibody responses to preS1. They have a potential to be developed into prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines against HBV infection.",

Of which ORF1 codes for a polyprotein of 1693 amino acids and contain domains homologous to a viral methyltransferase, a papainlike cysteine protease, an RNA helicasre, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, besides the most hypervariable region of the HEV genome. And ORF3 codes for a 123-amino-acide-long polypeptide with unknown function. While the major viral capsid protein (pORF2, ORF2 codes) of 660 amino acid was showed to contain the protective epitope. The bacterially expressed polypeptide disignated as NE2 has been proved to be a protective antige. And the anti-NE2 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) was screend, two of these mAbs 8C11 and 8H3 were showed to be against separate conformational neutralization epitope of hepatitis E virus (HEV). And these two mAb were used to screen for binding peptides from a 7-peptides phage display library. After four rounds of panning, tweenty-one positive monoclonal phages (11 for 8C11, and 10 for 8H3) were selected and the inserted fragments were sequenced. The DNA sequence coding for the obtained dominant peptide 8C11 (N'-His-Pro-Thr-Leu-Leu-Arg-Ile-C', named 8C11A) and 8H3 (N'-Ser-Ile-Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr-C', named 8H3A) were then synthesized and cloned to insert between amino acid 78 to 83 of hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), then expressed in E. coli. The recombinant proteins aggregate into homodimer or polymer on SDS-PAGE, and could bind with mAb 8C11 and 8H3 in Western blotting. Respectively, the recombinant protein C8C11A showed to be dimer mainly, which can bind with mAb 8C11. The monomer and dimer of C8H3A are in the same amount on SDS-PAGE, but only the dimer could bind with mAb 8H3 on Western blotting. The renatured recombinant proteins were all showed to aggregate into virus like particles which were similar as HBcAg on transmission electron micrograph. The dominant peptide 8H3A (N'-Ser-Ile-Leu-Pro-Tyr-ProTyr-C') that selected out by mAb 8H3 was further chemo-synthesized, and its binding activity was confirmed by BIAcore biosensor. The result showed that this 7-peptide can bind with mAb 8H3 in a big Ka and Kd form, which means the binding is not stable. These results implicated that conformational dependent neutralization epitope could be partially modeled by short peptide, which provided a feasible route for subunit vaccine development.",

        "abstract": "Here, we presented a method to bacterially express the major structural protein L1 of Human Papillomavirus type 18 (HPV18) as soluble form. We found that the purified L1 could self-assemble to virus-like particles (VLPs). Further, we investigated the immunogenicity and the induced level of neutralizing antibody using these VLPs. First, the genome of HPV18 was cloned from a patient in Xiamen. It was used as template for PCR amplification of HPV18 L1 gene. The resultant DNA fragment was inserted into expression vector pTrxFus and expressed in Escherichia coli GI724. Second, L1 protein was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography; and the purified L1 was subjected to self-assembly to form VLPs with the removal of premixed reductant DTT. Finally, the size and morphology of these VLPs was investigated by Dynamic Light Scattering and Transmission Electronic Microscopy as 29.34 nm in hydrated radius and globular particles similar with native HPV18. The half effective dosage (ED50) and maximum level of neutralizing antibody elicitation were measured by vaccinations on mice, rabbit and goat using pseudovirus neutralization cell model. The results showed that the ED50 of HPV18 VLPs is 0.006 microg in mice, and the maximum titer of neutralizing antibody elicited in rabbit and goat is up to 10(7). As a conclusion, we can provide HPV18 VLPs with highly immunogenicity from prokaryote expression system, which may pave a new way for research and development of prophylactic vaccine for HPV18.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute hepatitis in humans, predominantly by contamination of food and water, and is characterized by jaundice and flu-like aches and pains. To date, no vaccines are commercially available to prevent the disease caused by HEV. Previously, we showed that a monoclonal antibody, 8C11, specifically recognizes a neutralizing conformational epitope on HEV genotype I. The antibody 8C11 blocks the virus-like particle from binding to and penetrating the host cell. Here, we report the complex crystal structure of 8C11 Fab with HEV E2s(I) domain at 1.9 \u00c5 resolution. The 8C11 epitopes on E2s(I) were identified at Asp(496)-Thr(499), Val(510)-Leu(514), and Asn(573)-Arg(578). Mutations and cell-model assays identified Arg(512) as the most crucial residue for 8C11 interaction with and neutralization of HEV. Interestingly, 8C11 specifically neutralizes HEV genotype I, but not the other genotypes. Because HEV type I and IV are the most abundant genotypes, to understand this specificity further we determined the structure of E2s(IV) at 1.79 \u00c5 resolution and an E2s(IV) complex with 8C11 model was generated. The comparison between the 8C11 complexes with type I and IV revealed the key residues that distinguish these two genotypes. Of particular interest, the residue at amino acid position 497 at the 8C11 epitope region of E2s is distinct among these two genotypes. Swapping this residue from one genotype to another inversed the 8C11 reactivity, demonstrating the essential role played by amino acid 497 in the genotype recognition. These studies may lead to the development of antibody-based drugs for the specific treatment against HEV.",

        "abstract": "P239, a truncated construct of the hepatitis E virus (HEV) ORF2 protein, has been proven able to bind with a chaperone, Grp78, in both an in vitro co-immune precipitation test and an in vivo cell model. We previously solved the crystal structure of E2s--the C-terminal domain of p239 involved in host interactions. In the present study, we built a 3D structure of Grp78 using homology modeling methods, and docked this molecule with E2s using the Zdockpro module of the InsightII software package. The modeled Grp78 structure was deemed feasible by profile 3D evaluation and molecular dynamic simulations. The docking result consists of six clusters of distinct complexes and C035 was selected as the most reasonable. The interacting interface of the predicted complex is comprised of the Grp78 linker region and nucleotide binding domain along with the E2s groove region and surrounding loops. Using energy, hydrogen bond and solvent accessible surface analyses, we identified a series of key residues that may be involved in the Grp78:E2s interaction. By comparing with the known structure of the Hsp70:J complex, we further concluded that the interaction of Grp78 and E2s could interrupt binding of Grp78 with the J domain, and in turn diminish or even eliminate the binding ability of the Grp78 substrate binding domain. The predicted series of key residues also provides clues for further research that should improve our understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms of HEV infection.",

        "abstract": "The Hepatitis E vaccine (Hecolin, licensed in China) harbors a potent particulate immunogen, p239, designed from a 26-aa N-terminal extension of its poorly immunogenic parental protein, E2. Although an effective vaccine, we sought to design a fusion protein in a non-particulate form that could improve the delivery and immunogenicity of E2 epitopes. The non-toxic mutant of diphtheria toxin, CRM197 (Cross-Reacting Material 197) has been successfully used as a carrier protein for conjugated vaccines to enhance the immunogenicity of polysaccharides. Here, we designed a fusion non-particulate protein of E2 and the catalytic domain (fragment A) of CRM197 and evaluated its antigenicity, immunogenicity and disease prevention efficacy in primates. This fusion protein, named CRM197(A)-E2, was bacterially expressed and purified by chromatography. CRM197(A)-E2 presented as a homodimer in solution, similar to its parental E2 protein, and exhibited excellent antigenicity against representative neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, like E2 and p239. However, CRM197(A)-E2 manifested higher immunogenicity in mice compared with that achieved by the particulate p239, as indicated by the 10-times lower ED value and 2-log higher HEV-specific antibody level that could persist for at least 28 weeks. In addition, both the 1\u202f\u03bcg and 10\u202f\u03bcg doses of CRM197(A)-E2 adjuvanted with aluminum could protect vaccinated monkeys against HEV challenge, matching that achieved with only the higher (10\u202f\u03bcg) dose of the p239 vaccine. These results suggest that the CRM197 fragment A alone serves as an intra-molecular adjuvant to remarkably enhance the immunogenicity of the target of interest in a non-particulate form. These findings may pave the way for rational vaccine design, especially in cases where particulates are not accessible.",

One of the most studied gene delivery systems is the use of lentivirus based vectors, which can deliver genes into both dividing and nondividing cells. However, low infection efficiency represents an obstacle for proper evaluation of their biological function. In this study, a recombinant lentiviral vector which expressed short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeted against the HIV-1 vif/pol was transduced into various cells. An MHC class I molecule, H-2K(k), was used as a marker to accumulate the virally transduced cells through immunomagnetic sorting. In vitro testing of transduced cells showed 85% suppression of HIV in post-sorted PBMCs compared to 30% in pre-sorted PBMCs. In additional, using a mouse xenotransplantation model with the same treatment protocol for cell enrichment, a >95% decrease in HIV activity in post-sorted cells was achieved, as compared to nearly none in the pre-sorted cells. These studies offer a practical method to accumulate virally transduced cells, which can be applied to evaluate the performance of various shRNAs constructs.",

The use of various recombinant expression systems and construct designs are associated with the resultant nature of produced proteins, especially in terms of glycosylation, antigenicity, and immunogenicity of the glycoprotein. Here, we explored an otherwise baculovirus cassette than classical one designed to express HIV-1 Env protein, including SOSIP mutation and Foldon moiety involvement. This improved design increased the ratio of the Env trimer fraction from \u223c40% to \u223c60% with respect to that of prototypical design, as indicated by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography and sedimentation velocity analysis. In addition, the design prolonged cell viability and enhanced the final yield (approximately 13-15\u202fmg/L) after affinity purification. gp140 produced from insect cells mimicked the native-like trimer and mainly adopted glycosylation pattern of oligomannose glycans. The native-like Env proteins conferred cross-clade neutralizing antibody production in BALB/c mice. In summary, the expression of Env in insect cells by optimizing the baculovirus vector provides an alternative strategy for HIV-1 immunogen production and may benefit future Env-based HIV vaccine design.",

Methods: cDNAs encoding variable regions of heavy and light chains were isolated by RT-PCR from hybridoma cells secreting mouse monoclonal antibody (McAb) 4D11, and to be introduced into mammalian expression vectors pcDNA3.1-AH and pcDNA3.1-Ak containing sequences of human \u03b31 and \u03ba constant regions, respectively. The vectors were cotransfected into 293 FT cells. The expressed 4D11 chimeric antibody (cAb) was characterized by Western blot, competitive ELISA, serum blocking ELISA and preS1 detection inserum. Results: The expressed heavy and light chains in 293FT cells were assembled to form IgG molecule, which could be secreted outside the cells. The cAb well reacted with preS1 in HBV eAg positive serum. The result of preS1 detection in HBV eAg positive serum by ELISA with coated cAb was consistent with that of 4D11 McAb. Conclusion: The cAb expressed in 293 FT cells, shows the same binding specificity and recongnizes the same epitope as original McAb. The cAb described here is expected to be less immunoreactive and thus more suitable for antibody therapy of hepatitis B.",

The results of indirect ELISA and Western blot showed that the expressed scFv could bind specifically to a recombinant protein in OFR2 region of HEV (NE2).

        "abstract": "The hepatitis E virus (HEV) capsid consists of a single structural protein, a portion of which is engaged in isosahedral contact to form a basal shell, and another portion in dimeric contact to form the homodimers protruding from the shell. Previous studies revealed that homodimers of the truncated HEV capsid proteins, E2 (amino acids 394-606) and p239 (amino acids 368-606), model dominant antigenic determinants of HEV. Immunization with these proteins protected rhesus monkeys against the virus, and three monoclonal antibodies against the homodimers could neutralize HEV infectivity and/or immune-capture of the virus. Furthermore, homodimers of p239 further interact to form particles of 23 nm diameter, rendering it an efficacious candidate vaccine. In light of this we postulate that the interactions involved in the formation of the homodimers and particles might be similar to those involved in assembly of the virus capsid. Presently, mutational analysis was carried out to identify these sites of interactions. The site of dimeric interactions was located to a cluster of six hydrophobic amino acids residues, Ala597, Val598, Ala599, Leu601, and Ala602; furthermore, the site involved in particle formation was located at amino acids 368-394. The possibility that these sites are also involved in assembly of the virus capsid is supported by the fact that they are located at two major and highly conserved hydrophobic regions of the HEV structural protein.",

H group contains genotype 1 and genotype 2 HEV isolates which infect human only; Z group contains genotype 3 and genotype 4 HEV isolates which infect both human and animals. After analysis of amino acid sequences between ORF2 aa368 and aa606, four group-conserved sites that were all located in the neutralization region of ORF2 were identified. They are aa483, aa492, aa497 and aa599. Mutation analysis and capture PCR were then performed on these sites with a group of monoclonal antibodies. Results showed that the difference of the aa497 between H and Z groups was responsible for the maintenance of their group-specific immunodominant epitopes, probably through confirmation-dependent epitope changes. Thus, aa497 and its related change on the surface structure of HEV may play important roles in host selection by H and Z groups of HEV.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, is a major cause of enteric hepatitis. Classified into the family Hepeviridae, HEV comprises four genotypes (genotypes 1-4), which belong to a single serotype. We describe a monoclonal antibody (mAb), 8G12, which equally recognizes all four genotypes of HEV, with \u223c 2.53-3.45 nM binding affinity. The mAb 8G12 has a protective, neutralizing capacity, which can significantly block virus infection in host cells. Animal studies with genotypes 1, 3 and 4 confirmed the cross-genotype neutralizing capacity of 8G12 and its effective prevention of hepatitis E disease. The complex crystal structures of 8G12 with the HEV E2s domain (the most protruded region of the virus capsid) of the abundant genotypes 1 and 4 were determined at 4.0 and 2.3 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. These structures revealed that 8G12 recognizes both genotypes through the epitopes in the E2s dimerization region. Structure-based mutagenesis and cell-model assays with virus-like particles identified several conserved residues (Glu549, Lys554 and Gly591) that are essential for 8G12 neutralization. Moreover, the epitope of 8G12 is identified as a key epitope involved in virus-host interactions. These findings will help develop a common strategy for the prevention of the most abundant form of HEV infection.",

        "abstract": "Human Papillomavirus (HPV), a non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus, is responsible for 5% of human cancers. The HPV capsid consists of major and minor structural proteins, L1 and L2. L1 proteins form an icosahedral shell with building blocks of the pentameric capsomere, and one L2 molecule extends outward from the central hole of the capsid. Thus, L2 is concealed within L1 and only becomes exposed when the capsid interacts with host cells. The low antigenic variation of L2 means that this protein could offer a target for the development of a pan-HPV vaccine. Toward this goal, here we describe an anti-L2 monoclonal antibody, 14H6, which broadly neutralizes at least 11 types of HPV, covering types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52, 58 and 59, in pseudovirion--based cell neutralization assay. The mAb 14H6 recognizes a minimal linear epitope located on amino acids 21 to 30 of the L2 protein. Alanine scanning mutagenesis and sequence alignment identified several conserved residues (Cys22, Lys23, Thr27, Cys28 and Pro29) that are involved in the 14H6 binding with L2. The epitope was grafted to several scaffolding proteins, including HPV16 L1 virus-like particles, HBV 149 core antigen and CRM197. The resultant chimeric constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified with high efficiency. Immunization with these pan-HPV vaccine candidates elicited high titers of the L2-specific antibody in mice and conferred robust (3-log) titers of cross-genotype neutralization, including against HPV11, 16, 18, 45, 52, 58 and 59. These findings will help in the development of an L2-based, pan-HPV vaccine.",

        "title": "Interface domain of hepatitis E virus capsid protein homodimer]",
        "abstract": "Hepatitis E is a main cause of acute viral hepatitis in developing countries where it occurs as sporadic cases and in epidemics form. The causative agent, hepatitis E virus, is transmitted primarily by the fecal-oral route. The approximately 7.5 kb positive-sense single-strand RNA genome includes three open reading frames (ORFs), one of which (ORF2) is postulated to encode the major viral capsid protein (pORF2) of 660 amino acid residues. We earlier showed that a bacterially expressed peptide, designated as NE2, located from amino acid residues 394 to 606 of ORF2, was found to aggregate into homodimer to at least hexamer. To understand the interface domains within this peptide vital for dimerization and formation of major neutralizing epitopes, NE2 protein underwent terminal-truncated and site-directed mutation. The hydrophobic region, ORF2 aa597-aa602 (AVAVLA), played a key role in oligomerization. Any amino acid residue of this region replaced with glutamic acid residue, the peptide can not refold as homodimer and/or oligomer. The immunoreactivities of these mutant peptides, blotted with anti-HEV neutralizing monoclonal antibody (8C11) and convalescent human sera, show associated to the formation of homodimer. The intermolecular contact region on homodimer was investigated by chemical cross-linking of two site-directed cysteines. When the alanine on aa597 site mutated with cysteine, two different homodimers were found in SDS-PAGE analysis. One (42kD) can be disassociated with 8mol/L urea, which is postulated to form by virtue of hydrophobic interaction, and the other (60kD) falls apart with the reductant DTT present. The exact conformation, generating the cross-linking reaction of cysteines, was further investigated by induced-oxidation on monomer and hydrophobic homodimer of A597C protein with GSH/GSSG. And the results revealed, it is the conformation of hydrophobic homodimer that induces the disulfide bond come into being, instead of the one of monomer. So the aa597 site was verified to be located on interface domain of hydrophobically interacting homodimeric complex. To evaluate the biological significance of hydrophobicity of interface domain, we searched natural variations as to the region on all available databases with NCBI blast program. All variations on these amino acid residues kept higher hydrophobicity, which suggests that the hydrophobic domain is critical for the assemblage and propagation of HEV. NE2 N-terminal deletions up to aa458 had no effect on dimerization and took no exact part in formation of major neutralizing epitopes, but the fragment may act as helper for the formation of major neutralizing epitopes on NE2. Interestingly, the C-terminus aa605-aa660 of ORF2 can also act as helper instead of the N-terminus of NE2. This study suggests an interface domain of NE2 might be vital for HEV capsomer assembly and formation of major neutralizing epitopes. These results may offer clues to the rational design of recombinant anti-HEV vaccine.",

Then, the pTO-T7-HPV16-L1 was transformed into E. coil strain ER2566 and the recombinant protein HPV16 L1 was expressed in soluble form. After purification by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography, the recombinant protein HPV16 L1 had a purity of more than 98%. By removing DTT, purified HPV16 L1 proteins self-assembled in vitro into VLPs with the diameter of 50 nm. The vaccination experiments on experimental animals showed the VLPs could elicit high titer of neutralizing antibodies against HPV 16. HPV16 VLPs with high immunogenicity and high purity can be produced easily and effectively from an E. coli expression system in the study, and thus can be used in structure investigation and HPV16 vaccine development.",

And then according to ORF gene, MA18/7-V(L) was inserted into the 5' terminal of EGFP gene free of terminal code TAA to construct expression vector of fusion protein. The fusion protein was expressed in E.coli and its bioactivity was detected with ELISA and relative fluorescence intensity.The expression vector EGFP-V(L) was constructed. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that expressed fusion protein was mainly in the form of inclusion body.

Hence, they were taken sequential blood samples at intervals up to 86 weeks for 4 hepatitis E virus (HEV) specific antibody assays (E2-IgM, E2-IgG, GL-IgG, and YES-IgG), and nucleic acid assay.All the animals produced E2-IgG and all but one also produced E2-IgM and excreted the virus in stool, whereas positive rate of GL-IgG and YES IgG were low and correlated with virus level. Hepatitis occurred over a period of 4 weeks (between 3 an 7 weeks) after infection. Virological marker occurred mainly during incubation period and declined rapidly after onset of hepatitis. Seroconversion of E2-IgM occurred before onset of hepatitis in 70% monkeys and declined rapidly up to 50% of peak value after 4 weeks. E2-IgM seroconversion was closely paralleled by E2-IgG; however, E2-IgG persisted in all animals for the entire duration of experiment of up to 86 weeks. Production of GL-IgG and YES-IgG was delayed by one week after the E2 antibodies, these antibodies showed a transient occurrence and seroprevalence declined to 50% of the peak value over a period of 12 weeks.E2-IgM might be used as a suitable acute hepatitis E marker, and E2-IgG as a suitable epidemiological marker. The seroconversion or titer elevation of GL-IgG and YES-IgG antibodies probably used to confirm the infection. The viral markers are optional for early diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "The hepatitis E virus (HEV) capsid protein has been demonstrated to be able to assemble into particles in vitro. However, this process and the mechanism of protein-protein interactions during particle assembly remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the assembly mechanism of HEV structural protein subunits, the capsid protein p239 (aa368-606), using analytical ultracentrifugation. It was the first to observe that the p239 can form particles in 4M urea as a result of supplementation with salt, including ammonium sulfate [(NH\u2084)\u2082SO\u2084], sodium sulfate (Na\u2082SO\u2084), sodium chloride (NaCl), and ammonium chloride (NH\u2084Cl). Interestingly, it is the ionic strength that determines the efficiency of promoting particle assembly. The assembly rate was affected by temperature and salt concentration. When (NH\u2084)\u2082SO\u2084 was used, assembling intermediates of p239 with sedimentation coefficient values of approximately 5 S, which were mostly dodecamers, were identified for the first time. A highly conserved 28-aa region (aa368-395) of p239 was found to be critical for particle assembly, and the hydrophobic residues Leu\u00b3\u2077\u00b2, Leu\u00b3\u2077\u2075, and Leu\u00b3\u2079\u2075 of p239 was found to be critical for particle assembly, which was revealed by site-directed mutagenesis. This study provides new insights into the assembly mechanism of native HEV, and contributes a valuable basis for further investigations of protein assembly by hydrophobic interactions under denaturing conditions.",

        "abstract": "Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) is the mainstay anti-HIV-1 therapy as it prolongs survival and switches HIV-1 infection from a fatal disease to a chronic yet manageable one. Unfortunately, drug toxicity and the emergence of drug-resistant mutant strains in patients undergoing long-term therapy have meant that there is still a continual need for novel drugs that target alternative molecules in the HIV-1 life cycle. The HIV-1 Gag precursor protein is a multidomain polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved into the main, mature capsid protein; CA. CA has multifaceted roles during HIV-1 morphogenesis and is thus regarded as a promising target for future antiviral intervention. In this review, we describe the advances made in our understanding of the HIV-1 capsid structure and the key interactions involved during core assembly, and discuss how this and future knowledge will provide important structural insight for antiviral design.",

Materials & methods: Flu HA1, HIV gp41/gp120/p24, HBsAg and HPV16 L2 were fused with NHT, expressed in Escherichia coli and subjected to self-assembly in vitro. Nanosized particles were characterized by size-exclusion chromatography and negative electron microscopy. Immunogenicity was assessed in mice. Results: All the NHT-fused proteins spontaneously formed nanoparticulates and presented with immunogenicity approximately 2-log over their nonassembling forms. Conclusion: Protein self-assembly provides an attractive means to create nanosized particles that bear specific antigens. Our strategy outlines a novel and shared method for the design of immunogenic nanoparticles.",

        "abstract": "Our objective was to establish a robust method for the expression and purification of hepatitis E virus(HEV)p495protein using a baculovirus-based insect cell expression system; to determine the properties and cryo-EM structure of the resulting virus-like particles(VLPs);and to compare their immunogenicity with p239 particles in the commercial hepatitis E vaccine (Hecolin). The sequence spanning HEV ORF2 amino acids 112-606 in the genotype I HEV isolate was cloned into baculovirus to express recombinant p495 protein. ELISA, analytical ultracentrifugation, size-exclusion chromatography and negative-staining transmission electron microscopy(TEM)were carried out to characterize the physicochemical properties of p495.Recombinant p495 VLPs were obtained successfully from the insect cell expression system with purity of>95%and yield of 15mg/L.The recombinant HEV p495 protein was homogeneous in solutions. The 3Dstructure of p495 VLPs was determined by cryo-EM;it was icosahedral with T=1arrangement,and showed good congruency with the crystal structure in the literature(PDB ID:2ZZQ).In mouse vaccination experiments,p495 conferred comparable immunogenicity with that of p239 antigen in Hecolin. Thus, a robust and scalable approach to obtain homogeneous, immunogenic HEV p495 VLPs has been established. This study may assist investigations of HEV receptors, epitope mapping, vaccine improvement and so on.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Human papillomavirus (HPV) is widely accepted to be the major causative pathogen of cervical cancer, warts, and other epithelial tumors. Virus infection and subsequent disease development can be prevented by vaccination with HPV vaccines derived from eukaryotic expression systems. Here, we report the soluble expression of the major capsid protein L1 of HPV31, a dominant carcinogenic HPV genotype, in  Escherichia coli . HPV31 L1 protein and its elongated form (L1+) were observed in SDS-PAGE and CE-SDS analysis, generated by the native HPV31 L1 gene with a TAA stop codon. Replacing the TAA with TAG but not TGA could completely terminate protein translation. Mass spectrometry sequencing showed that L1+ comprised L1 with a C-terminal extension of 38 amino acids (aa). RNA folding analysis revealed that the unfaithful L1+ expression may result from translational read-through, as TAG is more stable and accessible than the other stop codons. The 38-aa elongated fragment perturbs self-assembly of HPV31 L1+, as shown in size and morphology analyses. By 3D cryo-electron microscopy structure determination, we show self-assembly of purified HPV31 L1 (TAG) VLPs into T\u00a0=\u00a07 icosahedral symmetry particles, resembling the native HPV virion. Finally, through additional characterization and antigenicity/immunogenicity assays, we verified that the  E.coli -derived HPV31 VLPs are an ideal immunogen for HPV vaccine development. Our findings outline a codon optimization stratagem for protein expression and provide a method for the in-depth investigation of prokaryotic translation regulation.",

        "title": "Structural Basis for the Broad, Antibody-Mediated Neutralization of H5N1 Influenza Virus.",
        "abstract": "Human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses lead to cause severe diseases and fatalities. We previously identified a potent and broad-neutralizing antibody (bnAb), 13D4, against the H5N1 virus. Here, we report the co-crystal structure of 13D4 in complex with the hemagglutinin of A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1). We show that the heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (HCDR3) of 13D4 confers H5N1 broad yet specific neutralization against H5N1, undergoing conformational rearrangement to bind to the receptor-binding site (RBS). Further, we show that mutating four critical residues within the RBS-Trp153, Lys156, Lys193, Leu194-disrupts the binding between 13D4 and HA. Viruses bearing Asn193 instead of Lys/Arg can evade 13D4 neutralization, indicating that Lys193 polymorphism might be, at least in part, involved in the antigenicity of recent H5 genotypes (such as H5N6 and H5N8) distinguished from H5N1. BnAb 13D4 may offers a template for therapeutic RBS-inhibitor design and serve as an indicator of antigenic change of current H5 viruses. The infection of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus remains a threat for public health. Our broad-neutralizing antibody, 13D4, is capable of neutralizing all representative H5N1 viruses and protecting mice against lethal challenge. Structural analysis revealed that 13D4 uses the heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (HCDR3) to fit to receptor binding site (RBS) via conformational rearrangement. Four conserved residues within the RBS are critical for the broad potency of 13D4. Importantly, polymorphism of Lys193 on RBS may be associated with the antigenicity shift from H5N1 to other new emerging viruses, such as H5N6 and H5N8. Our findings may pave a way for highly pathogenic avian influenza vaccine development and therapeutic RBS-inhibitor design.",

Furthermore, we aimed to solve the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of HPV16 PsV. The suspension f HEK-293 FT cells were generated from adherent cells by a stepwise decrease in serum content and the addition of an anti-clumping agent during culturing. The resultant HEK-293 FT suspension cells were transfected with an L1/L2 expression vector and pN31-EGFP plasmid to generate HPV16 PsV in the Wave Bioreactor. Following cell lysis,HPV16 PsV was purified by sucrose density gradient and subsequent CsCl iso-density gradient ultra-centrifugation The final titer of HPV16 PsV was 8.2 \u00d7 10(5) TCID(50)/\u03bcL. Purified HPV16 PsV was comfirmed to as contain L1 and L2protein by western blotting, and the L1 concentration was determined to be 156.0 \u03bcg/mL by quantitative ELISA. Finally, a FEI Tecnai G2F30 electron microscope and AUTO3 DEM were used to solve the cryoEM structure of HPV16 PsV at a resolution of 14 \u00c5.The structure shows that HPV16 PsV exists as a T=7dicosahedral lattice, with a diameter of 600 \u00c5. These results will be beneficial for neutralization assays and for anti-sera for HPV vaccines, the high-resolution structure determination of HPV16 PsV, and the investigation of interactions between HPV L1 and L2.",

        "abstract": "The HIV-1 mature capsid (CA) assumes an amorphous, fullerene conical configuration due to its high flexibility. How native CA self-assembles is still unclear despite having well-defined structures of its pentamer and hexamer building blocks. Here we explored the self-assembly of an engineered capsid protein built through artificial disulfide bonding (CA N21C/A22C) and determined the structure of one fraction of the globular particles. CA N21C/A22C was found to self-assemble into particles in relatively high ionic solutions. These particles contained disulfide-bonding hexamers as determined via non-reducing SDS-PAGE, and exhibited two major components of 57.3 S and 80.5 S in the sedimentation velocity assay. Particles had a globular morphology, approximately 40 nm in diameter, in negative-staining TEM. Through cryo-EM 3-D reconstruction, we determined a novel T = 4 icosahedral structure of CA, comprising 12 pentamers and 30 hexamers at 25 \u00c5 resolution. We engineered the HIV-1 V3 loop to the CA particles, and found the resultant particles resembled the morphology of their parental particles in TEM, had a positive reaction with V3-specific neutralizing antibodies, and conferred neutralization immunogenicity in mice. Our results shed light on HIV CA assembly and provide a particulate CA for epitope display.",

        "abstract": "Summary  Cervical cancer is the second most prevalent malignant tumor among women worldwide. High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are believed to be the major causative pathogens of mucosal epithelial cancers including cervical cancer. The HPV capsid is made up of 360 copies of major (L1) and 72 copies of minor (L2) capsid proteins. To date, limited high-resolution structural information about the HPV capsid has hindered attempts to understand details concerning the mechanisms by which HPV assembles and infects cells. In this study, we have constructed a pseudo-atomic model of the HPV59 L1-only capsid and demonstrate that the C-terminal arm of L1 participates in virus-host interactions. Moreover, when conjugated to a scaffold protein, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), this arm is immunogenic in\u00a0vivo. These results provide new insights that will help elucidate HPV biology, and hence pave a way for the design of next-generation HPV vaccines.",

Primers were designed according to the CAP2NC DNA sequence of HIV-1 NL4-3 strain. The target gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into prokaryotic expression vector pTO-T7. Then the recombinant strain was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). IPTG induced protein expression, then the protein was purified by hydrophobic chromatography. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed to analyze the target protein, and the biological activity of the antigen was identified through ELISA. The self-assembly of CAP2NC protein was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and gel filtration chromatography. The protein had good reaction with the specific antibodies of p24 and formed different structures in various conditions. When 10% yeast RNA was added to the protein complex, the recombinant protein only formed into a tubular structure, which was similar to the self-assembled structure of the HIV-1 virus capsid. The results showed that the HIV-1 CAP2NC protein had in vitro self-assembly activity, and the RNA affected the structure of CAP2NC protein assembly. The protein can be used as a simple and effective molecular model to study its structure, and then it can provide a reference for the study of HIV immature virus particles.",

        "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the causative agent in genital warts and nearly all cervical, anogenital, and oropharyngeal cancers. Nine HPV types (6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) are associated with about 90% of cervical cancers and 90% of genital warts. HPV neutralization by vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies can block viral infection and prevent HPV-associated diseases. However, there is only one commercially available HPV vaccine, Gardasil 9, produced from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that covers all nine types, raising the need for microbial production of broad-spectrum HPV vaccines. Here, we investigated whether N-terminal truncations of the major HPV capsid proteins L1, improve their soluble expression in Escherichia coli. We found that N-terminal truncations promoted the soluble expression of HPV 33 (truncated by 10 amino acids [aa]), 52 (15 aa), and 58 (10 aa). The resultant HPV L1 proteins were purified in pentamer form and extensively characterized with biochemical, biophysical, and immunochemical methods. The pentamers self-assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs) in vitro, and 3D cryo-EM reconstructions revealed that all formed T\u2009=\u20097 icosahedral particles having 50-60-nm diameters. Moreover, we formulated a nine-valent HPV vaccine candidate with aluminum adjuvant and L1 VLPs from four genotypes used in this study and five from previous work. Immunogenicity assays in mice and non-human primates indicated that this HPV nine-valent vaccine candidate elicits neutralizing antibody titers comparable to those induced by Gardasil 9. Our study provides a method for producing a nine-valent HPV vaccine in E. coli and may inform strategies for the soluble expression of other vaccine candidates.",

Modeling of antigen-antibody immune complexes from co-crystal structures or molecular docking simulations provides an extensive profile of the epitope at the interface; however, the key amino acids involved in the interaction must be further clarified, often through the use of experimental mutagenesis and subsequent binding assays. Here, we describe an in silico mutagenesis method to identify key sites at antigen-antibody interfaces, using significant increase in pH-dependency energy among saturated point mutations. Through a comprehensive analysis of the crystal structures of three antigen-antibody immune complexes, we show that a cutoff value of 1\u00a0kcal/mol of increased interaction energy provides good congruency with the experimental non-binding mutations conducted in vitro. This in silico mutagenesis strategy, in association with energy calculations, may provide an efficient tool for antibody-antigen interface analyses, epitope optimization, and/or conformation prediction in structure-based vaccine design.",

        "abstract": "The HIV-1 Gag precursor protein (p55) is the main structural protein comprising the matrix (MA/p17), capsid (CA/p24), and nucleocapsid (NC/p7) proteins, and is uniquely responsible for virion assembly within the virus life cycle. The MA protein plays a critical role in plasma membrane targeting and envelope glycoprotein (Env) uptake during virion assembly. Yet, when viral infection occurs, the MA protein may also be involved in virion uncoating, dissociating from the plasma membrane, and participating in the nuclear importation process. Thus, the MA protein contains a reversibly membrane-binding signal and varied conformation to govern its subcellular localization and biological functions. However, these purported different conformations of the MA protein during assembly are poorly understood, especially in terms of its function as a component of the precursor protein. In this study, we characterized a panel of monoclonal antibodies against MA that showed discrete reactivity to p55, an intermediate (p41), and the final p17 mature form. We suggest that these antibodies could be used to track the different conformations of MA during the HIV-1 life cycle, particularly during HIV-1 assembly and maturation, and contribute to structure determination of MA or MA precursors. These antibodies would also have clinical value, including serving for therapeutic strategy to interfere AIDS progression, reagent in diagnostic kit for the detection of virion-free p17 or p17 derived from virion lysate.

Over 200 distinct genomic sequences have been identified for human papillomavirus (HPV), of which more than 18 are associated with cervical cancer. Here, based on the high structural similarity of L1 surface loops within a group of phylogenetically close HPV types, we design a triple-type\u00a0chimera of HPV33/58/52 using loop swapping. The chimeric VLPs elicit neutralization titers comparable with a mix of the three wild-type VLPs both in mice and non-human primates. This engineered region of the chimeric protein recapitulates the conformational contours of the antigenic surfaces of the parental-type proteins, offering a basis for this high immunity. Our stratagem is equally successful in developing other triplet-type chimeras (HPV16/35/31, HPV56/66/53, HPV39/68/70, HPV18/45/59), paving the way for the development of an improved HPV prophylactic vaccine against all carcinogenic HPV strains.

        "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV)-6 and HPV11 are the major etiological causes of condylomata acuminate. HPV neutralization by vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies can block viral infection and prevent subsequent disease. Currently, two commercially available HPV vaccines cover these two genotypes, expressed by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we describe another HPV6/11 bivalent vaccine candidate derived from Escherichia coli. The soluble expression of N-terminally truncated L1 proteins was optimized to generate HPV6- and HPV11 L1-only virus-like particles (VLPs) as a scalable process. In a pilot scale, we used various biochemical, biophysical and immunochemical approaches to comprehensively characterize the scale and lot consistency of the vaccine candidate at 30L and 100L. Cryo-EM structure analysis showed that these VLPs form a T=7 icosahedral lattice, imitating the L1 capsid of the authentic HPV virion. This HPV6/11 bivalent vaccine confers a neutralization titer and antibody production profile in monkey that is comparable with the quadrivalent vaccine, Gardasil. This study demonstrates the robustness and scalability of a potential HPV6/11 bivalent vaccine using a prokaryotic system for vaccine production.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is associated with acute hepatitis disease. Numerous truncated HEV capsid proteins have been successfully expressed using different expression systems. Among these, p495, a protein truncated at its N- and C-termini by 111 and 54 amino acids (aa), respectively (HEV ORF2 aa 112-606) can self-assemble into T\u202f=\u202f1 virus-like particles (VLPs) when expressed by insect cells. A shorter p239 (aa 368-606) protein is a particulate antigen that we have previously used in our commercialized HEV vaccine, Hecolin. Here, we sought to express p495 in its soluble form (named Ep495) in E. coli and in baculovirus-infected Tn5 insect cells (named BTp495) as a back-to-back control. Characterization of p495 particles derived from these two expression systems showed similarities in particle size, morphology, and sedimentation coefficient. Antigenicity assays using a panel of anti-HEV monoclonal antibodies also showed similar strong reactivities for Ep495 and BTp495, as well as similar binding profiles that were congruent with p239. Mouse immunization results showed that Ep495 particles had comparable immunogenicity with that of BTp495 VLPs, as well as p239. Overall, our findings suggest that p495 particles produced in E. coli are ideal for the development of next-generation prophylactic vaccines against hepatitis E.",

HIV-1 replication is primarily controlled through antiretroviral therapy (ART) but this treatment does not cure HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, there is increasing viral resistance to ART, and side effects associated with long-term therapy. Consequently, there is a need of alternative candidates for HIV-1 prevention and therapy. Recent advances have discovered multiple broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1. In this review, we describe the key epitopes on the HIV-1 Env protein and the reciprocal broadly neutralizing antibodies, and discuss the ongoing clinical trials of broadly neutralizing and inhibitory antibody therapy as well as antibody combinations, bispecific antibodies, and methods that improve therapeutic efficacy by combining broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) with latency reversing agents. Compared with ART, HIV-1 therapeutics that incorporate these broadly neutralizing and inhibitory antibodies offer the advantage of decreasing virus load and clearing infected cells, which is a promising prospect in HIV-1 prevention and treatment.",

Structural information for the various forms and antibody-bound capsids will facilitate the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against EV-D68 infection, which causes childhood respiratory and paralytic diseases worldwide. Here, we report the structures of three EV-D68 capsid states representing the virus at major phases. We further describe two original monoclonal antibodies (15C5 and 11G1) with distinct structurally defined mechanisms for virus neutralization. 15C5 and 11G1 engage the capsid loci at icosahedral three-fold and five-fold axes, respectively. To block viral attachment, 15C5 binds three forms of capsids, and triggers mature virions to transform into A-particles, mimicking engagement by the functional receptor ICAM-5, whereas 11G1 exclusively recognizes the A-particle. Our data provide a structural and molecular explanation for the transition of picornavirus capsid conformations and demonstrate distinct mechanisms for antibody-mediated neutralization.",

The multi-peaked structure of FWM spectra is obtained and explained as the resonant emission between the 'virtual states' in the dressed picture. The generated FMW signals have high quantum efficiency for a wide range of drive Rabi frequency and saturation Rabi frequency. Finally, the emitted fields c + s - p and c - s + p have about the same intensity for the well matching among the Zeeman splitting, drive Rabi frequency and saturation Rabi frequency.",

Here we show that taking the evanescent mode as an electromagnetic vacuum in which the nanocavity is located is possible through the optical mode design. The proposed evanescent vacuum enables us to enhance both the reversible photon-exciton interaction and fluorescence collection. By embedding the custom-designed plasmon nanocavity into the evanescent vacuum provided by a metallic or dielectric nanowire, the photon-exciton coupling coefficient can achieve 4.2 times that in vacuum due to the exponential decay of the evanescent wave, and spontaneously emitted photons with Rabi splitting can be guided by an evanescent wave with a collection efficiency of 47% at most. Electromagnetic vacuum engineering at subwavelength scale holds promise for controlling the light-matter interaction in quantum optics, CQED, and on-chip quantum information.",

The linewidth of the multiple geometric resonances of the arrays is of the order of several nanometers generally, which guarantees high wavelength selectivity. Optical channels can be selectively activated by setting the polarization of the incident wave. The operation wavelength can be tuned from the visible to the near infrared, and the free spectral range can be adjusted from hundreds to tens of nanometers by varying the size of the constituent particles and the interparticle distances. The proposed structure can provide an extinction ratio of ~10 and a quality factor of ~700.

        "title": "Controlling plasmonic resonances in binary metallic nanostructures",
        "abstract": "Investigation on the interplay of plasmonic resonances in binary nanostructures indicated that, at a fixed wavelength, with a variation in the difference permittivity ratio \u03b7=(\u03b52-\u03b50/ \u03b51-\u03b50), resonances exhibit the dielectric effect, resonance chaos, collective resonance, resonance flat, and new branch regions. This means that plasmonic resonances can be controlled by material parameters \u03b51 and \u03b52. In this work, using the Green's matrix method of solving the surface plasmon resonances, we first study the resonance combination of symmetrical binary three-nanostrip systems. Several resonance branches extend across the above mentioned regions. Near fields within the gaps and at the ends of nanostrips are greatly enhanced due to the influence of neighboring metallic material. Then, along each resonance branch, resonances in the dielectric permittivity region are mapped into the wavelength region of gold. Through adjusting material parameters \u03b51 and \u03b52, the resonance wavelength is tuned from \u03bbR =500 to 1500 nm, while for a single nanostrip it is only at \u03bbR =630 nm. We also find that comparable permittivity parameters \u03b51 (or \u03b52) and \u03b5Au(\u03c9) can control resonance wavelength and intensity effectively. High dielectric permittivity of the neighboring metal has also an advantage in a giant enhancement of the near field. These findings provide new insights into design of hybrid plasmonic devices as plasmonic sensors. \u00a9 2010 American Institute of Physics.",

This effect originates from the slowing down of the spectral shift of resonant nanocavities at the wavelength where the permittivity of the substrate vanishes, i.e., the resonance \"pinning\" near the ENZ frequency. In addition, most far field radiation of the emitter is concentrated in the forward field with small solid angle due to the impedance mismatch between the ENZ film and the free space. This kind of size-relaxed nanocavity for directional SE has potential applications in the bright single photon sources, plasmon-based nanolasers, and on-chip nanodevices.",

        "abstract": "Plasmonic refractometric nanosensors based on single nanostructures, i.e. spherical, nanorodand bipyramid-shaped gold nanoparticles, are investigated and compared numerically by employing the finite-difference time-domain method. The results show that the plasmonic sensing ability is distributed anisotropically around the nanorod and bipyramid, even for spherical nanoparticles when the illumination light is linearly polarized. To optimize nanosensor performance, some anisotropy in the shape of nanoparticles is required, this latter serving as an intrinsic light polarization filter to suppress the disturbance from localized surface plasmon resonance in other directions. The plasmonic near-field can be engineered by controlling the shape to achieve a concentrated and localized electromagnetic field, in direct relation with the sensing ability. Taking these factors into account, the gold bipyramid nanoconstruct which is easily available in experiment is proposed as an efficient plasmonic sensing platform. The bipyramid presents both highly localized sensitivity and high scattering cross-section, thus avoiding the trade-off during the selection of the widely used nanorod-shaped sensors. The parameters of the bipyramid structure can be optimized by numerical simulation to improve the plasmonic sensing. Our findings permit a deeper understanding of single-nanoparticle-sensor behavior, and the study provides an opportunity to optimize the plasmonic sensor.",

In a three-level atomic system with crossing damping, larger anisotropism of Purcell factors leads to more enhanced Kerr nonlinearity in electromagnetically induced transparency windows. While for fixed anisotropic Purcell factors, Kerr nonlinearity with orthogonal dipole moments increases with the decrease of its crossing damping, and Kerr nonlinearity with nonorthogonal dipole moments is very sensitive to both the value of crossing damping and the orientation of the dipole moments. We design the non-resonant gold nanorods array, which only provides subwavelength-confined anisotropic Purcell factors, and demonstrate that the Kerr nonlinearity of cesium atoms close to the nanorods array can be modulated at the nanoscale. These findings should have potential application in ultracompact quantum logic devices.",

We theoretically propose the mechanism of the great Kerr nonlinearity enhancement by using anisotropic Purcell factors in a double-\u039b type four-level system, i.e., if the bisector of the two vertical dipole moments lies in the small/large Purcell factor axis in the space, the Kerr nonlinearity will be enhanced/decreased due to the spontaneously generated coherence accordingly. Besides, when the two dipole moments are parallel, the extremely large Kerr nonlinearity increase appears, which comes from the double population trapping. Using the custom-designed resonant plasmonic nanostructure which gives an anisotropic Purcell factor environment, we demonstrate the effective nanoscale control of the Kerr nonlinearity. Such controllable Kerr nonlinearity may be realized by the state-of-the-art nanotechnics and it may have potential applications in on-chip photonic nonlinear devices.",

Dispersion relations of SPPs in anisotropic-dielectric-metal (ADM), dielectric-anisotropic-metal (DAM), and metal-anisotropic-metal (MAM) structures are analytically derived. The numerical results in the visible indicate that, in ADM, the propagation length of a conductor-gap-dielectric mode is changed from 5.9 to 91 \u03bcm and its cutoff thickness from 83 to 7 nm with varying the optical axis, while in DAM, the influences of anisotropic dielectric are reversed on propagation length and cutoff thickness. In MAM, by tuning the optical axis, the light confinement of symmetry SPPs mode varies about 10 %. Further numerical calculations show that the above results induced by the anisotropy of dielectric can be extended to the telecommunication frequency. The improved mode properties may be used in plasmonic-based nanodevices and tunable single surface plasmon sources. \u00a9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

We consider two located metallic clusters close to each other with admittances 1 and 2. Through varying the difference admittance ratio \u03b7[ \u2264 (2- 0)/(1-0)], we find that their optical responses are determined by the local resonance. There is a blueshift of absorption peaks with the increase of \u03b7. Simultaneously, it is known that the absorption peaks will be redshifted by enlarging the cluster size. By adjusting the nano-metallic cluster geometry, size and admittances, we can control the positions and intensities of absorption peaks effectively. We have also deduced the effective linear optical responses of three-component composites \u03b5e = \u03b50(1+\u2211n=1 ns[(\u03b3n1+\u03b7\u03b3n2) /(\u03b50(s-sn))]), and the sum rule of cross sections: \u2211n=1 ns(\u03b3n1+\u03b7\u03b3n2 = Nh1+Nh2, where Nh1and Nh2 are the numbers of \u03b51 and \u03b52 bonds along the electric field, respectively.

With the increasing of the relaxation rate \u03b3, the population distributions are shifted and their fluctuation amplitudes decrease. At the same time the electromagnetically induced transparency window becomes a broadened absorption peak, and the dispersion at the zero probe detuning changes from positive to negative. Large population fluctuation and non-fluctuation observed in different systems are attributed to the different relaxation rates. \u00a9 2004 Chin. Phys. Soc. and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The outer transitions F1F3 and F 2F4 are resonantly interacted with drive field with frequency \u03c9c and Rabi frequency \u03a9c, and saturation field with \u03c9s and \u03a9s, respectively. For the suitable Rabi frequencies \u03a9c and \u03a9s, we obtain the Mollow absorption spectrum of probe field. The reason is that the drive field excites the atom to the upper level F3 and simultaneously the saturation field takes the atom out of the lower level F2, leading to the stimulated emission. Meanwhile, due to the dynamic energy splitting induced by the drive and saturation fields, the two- and four-peaked absorption spectra are observed. At the zero off-resonance detuning of probe field, we also find the transfer of dispersion from negative to positive with an increment of \u03a9s. Finally, the refractive index enhancement is predicted for a wide spectral region. \u00a9 2007 Chin. Phys. Soc. and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

In this paper, we extend the GFF in the infinite network to the semi-infinite networks by the method of image. Using the formalism, we investigate the local field distribution near resonance for the impurity clusters with admittance \u03b50 embedded in one semi-infinite network with \u03b51. With varying the admittance \u03b52 of another semi-infinite network, we find that the local fields in the boundary experience great changes, especially at \u03b52 = -\u03b51. The existence of the boundary enhances the localization of the fields within and around the metallic clusters. Therefore, the intensity of local field is influenced by the arrangement of impurity metallic bonds and its distance from the boundary. \u00a9 2004 Chin. Phys. Soc. and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

After exploring the steady distributions of electric fields in these waveguides,we find that their decay lengths are about 5.948\u201312.83 dB/1000 nm,which is superior to the decay length (8.947 dB/1000 nm) of a gold nanosphere plasmonic waveguide.

Using a waveguiding nanoscale fiber taper for highly efficient launching, propagation surface plasmon polaritons are excited in the silver nanowire with high efficiency. The output intensity as light radiation at the end of the nanowire is quantified with high accuracy and repeatability. A typical propagation loss of 0.41 dB radicalmum (for 633 nm light) in a 260 nm diameter silver nanowire is obtained, which suggests that the propagation loss of a single silver nanowire could be lower than previously reported experimental results and should be much lower than those obtained by theoretical calculations.",

Combining surface plasmons with the quantum system provides the possibility of nanoscale realization of important quantum optical phenomena, including the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), which has many applications in nonlinear quantum optics and quantum information processing. Here, using a custom-designed resonant plasmon nanocavity, we demonstrate polarized position-dependent linewidth-controllable EIT spectra at the nanoscale. We analytically obtain the double coherent population trapping conditions in a double-\u039b quantum system with crossing damping, which give two transparent points in the EIT spectra. The linewidths of the three peaks are extremely sensitive to the level spacing of the excited states, the Rabi frequencies and detunings of pump fields, and the Purcell factors. In particular the linewidth of the central peak is exceptionally narrow. The hybrid system may have potential applications in ultra-compact plasmon-quantum devices.",

In the opposite case, i.e. \u0394e \u2264 \u0394g, in a moderate drive Rabi frequency, electromagnetically induced absorption with negative dispersion is obtained due to the shifting of the transparency points.

The spectrum of the binary structure, which is composed of alternating silver and gold spherical nanoparticles, is characterized by additional geometric resonances near diffraction orders that originate from the real periodicity (i.e., twice the interparticle distance). The new diffraction orders can force the induced polarization of the heterogeneous particles out of phase, so that light scattered from them interferes destructively, which leads to geometric resonances imposed by destructive interference. By varying the constituent particle sizes, both the width and intensity of the additional geometric resonances can be effectively tuned. In particular, the Fano profiles of the geometric resonances can be tuned and are inverted when the contrast in resonance capabilities of the two types of constituent particles changes. The extensive tunability of the binary structure makes itself highly desirable for design of plasmon-based chemical and biological sensors.",

For waveguides based on near-field coupling, transmission frequencies can be tuned in a wide region from 660 to 900 nm in wavelength by varying shell thicknesses. After exploring the steady distributions of electric fields in these waveguides, we find that their decay lengths are about 5.948-12.83 dB/1000 nm, which is superior to the decay length (8.947 dB/1000 nm) of a gold nanosphere plasmonic waveguide. These excellent tunability and transmittability are mainly due to the unique hollow structure. These gold nanoshell waveguides should be fabricated in laboratory. \u00a9 2008 Chin. Phys.

Large anisotropy of the Purcell factor, confined in the subwavelength optical mode volume, leads to rapid spectral line narrowing of atom approaching a metallic nanowire, nanoscale line width pulsing following periodically varying decay rates near a periodic metallic nanostructure, and dramatic modification on the spontaneous emission spectrum near a custom-designed resonant plasmon nanostructure.

The custom-designed asymmetrical antenna consists of two plasmonic nanoparticles with different sizes and is able to couple efficiently to free space light through multiple localized surface plasmon resonances. This design simultaneously permits a large near-field excitation near the antenna as well as a high quantum efficiency, which results in an unusual and significant enhancement of the fluorescence of a single emitter. Such an asymmetrical antenna presents intrinsic advantages over single particle or dimer based antennas made using two identical nanostructures. This promising concept can be exploited in the large domain of light-matter interaction processes involving multiple frequencies.",

        "abstract": "The control and enhancement of the spontaneous emission (SE) of emitters embedded in subwavelength structures are fundamentally interesting and of practical interest. For example, in plasmonic lasers and on-chip single photon sources, a large SE rate and the active modulation of SE over a very broad spectral band are highly desired functionalities. In this paper, we demonstrate by an explicit theoretical calculation that a plasmonic waveguide cladded with liquid crystals (LCs) and low-index metamaterials can give rise to an enhancement in the intrinsic SE rate \u03b3<sub>0</sub> of more than two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, by varying the refractive index of the LC cladding, thereby changing the density of states of the surface plasmons, the enhanced SE rate can be modulated over a very large range, e.g., from 131\u03b3<sub>0</sub> to 327\u03b3<sub>0</sub>. In general, the modulation range increases with the anisotropy in the refractive index of the LC, while for a fixed range of modulation, the SE rate is larger with lower cladding indices. These results for active modulation and enhanced SE may find application in enabling low-threshold plasmonic nanolasers and tunable on-chip single photon sources.",

        "abstract": ".\u00a0\u00a0We extend the Greens function formalism in a binary 2D composite to 3D. Using the formalism, we investigate the dielectric resonances, local-field distribution, and effective linear optical responses for one-bond, two-bond and three-bond clusters, as well as for various disordered composites. Due to the different values of Greens function in 2D and 3D, for the same cluster, the values of the dielectric resonances in 3D are smaller than those in 2D, but the fields are more localized than those in 2D. The sum rule of dielectric resonance in three-component composites is extended to d dimensions. For the same resonance, the intensity of the local-field in 3D is also weaker than that in the 2D case, but the fields are more localized than those in 2D. For the disordered composites in 2D and 3D, inverse participation ratios (IPR) with q = 2 are used to represent the localization of the field. When we increase the concentration of impurity bonds, a blue shift of IPR peaks occurs in 3D, while in 2D, these peaks are very stable. Finally, both for 2D and 3D disordered composites, the absorption range broadens with increasing impurity concentration, and a red shift of the absorption peak is observed in 3D.",

        "abstract": "The electrocatalytic properties of nanoparticles depend on their size, shape and composition. These properties are typically probed by measuring the total electrocatalytic reaction current of a large number of nanoparticles, but this approach is time-consuming and can only measure the average catalytic activity of the nanoparticles under study. However, the identification of new catalysts requires the ability to rapidly measure the properties of nanoparticles synthesized under various conditions and, ideally, to measure the electrocatalytic activity of individual nanoparticles. Here, we show that a plasmonic-based electrochemical current-imaging technique can simultaneously image and quantify the electrocatalytic reactions of an array of 1.6 \u00d7 10(5) platinum nanoparticles printed on an electrode surface, which could facilitate high-throughput screening of the catalytic activities of nanoparticles. We also show that the approach can be used to image the electrocatalytic reaction current and measure the cyclic voltammograms of single nanoparticles.",

By changing the liquid crystal's refractive index seen by the scattered light propagating along the array axis, the geometric resonance can be modulated according to an analytical law. The spectral tunability is proportional to the index difference (ne - no) of the liquid crystal and the interparticle distance i.e., \u0394\u03bb= (ne - no) d, which is as large as 100 nm. The large and easily controlled tunability of this compound structure makes it desirable for design of plasmon-based sensors and switches. \u00a9 2011 American Institute of Physics.",

Here, we propose a hybrid nanotoroid\u2013nanowire system to enhance photon\u2013exciton interaction. A nanoscale gap is formed by placing a dielectric nanowire close to a dielectric nanotoroid, where the coupling coefficient between photon and emitter can achieve 5.55 times of that without nanogap. Meanwhile, the cavity loss and spontaneous emission of the emitter will remain at a small value to guarantee the realization of strong coupling. The method might hold promise for the research of nanophotonics, quantum optics, and novel optical devices.",

The optical field at resonance forms a nanoscale-trap potential with an FWHM of 200\u00a0nm and about \u223c370\u2009\u2009nm away from the nanohole; thus, a stable 3D atom trapping independent of the surface potential is demonstrated. The effective trap depth is more than 1\u00a0mK when the optical power of trapping light is only about 0.5\u00a0mW, while the atom scattering rate is merely about 3.31\u2009\u2009s\u22121, and the trap lifetime is about 800\u00a0s. This compact plasmonic structure provides high uniformity of trap depths and a two-layer array of atom nanotraps, which should have important applications in the manipulation of cold atoms and collective resonance fluorescence.",

By adiabatically eliminating the field operators, an effective model is proposed to find the underlying mechanism for this determination. Two specific hybrid systems composed of two QDs and a metallic nanoparticle (MNP) are considered. In the QD-MNP-QD system, the concurrence maxima generated by the detunings are several times larger than those in the resonance condition because of the robust superposition between the two separated entangled states. However, in the MNP-QD-QD system, the detunings generally reduce entanglement because the dipole-dipole interaction strongly suppresses the superposition of the entangled states. Moreover, the plateau of large concurrence exists for a broad range of parameters in both cases. The scheme is robust to dissipative systems and paves the way to improve entanglement in quantum info...",

Chiral photon-emitter coupling in photonic structures is characterized as unidirectional propagation locked by the local polarization of light. However, to realize the strong interaction of photon-emitter with direction-locked propagation, which will bring novel applications in nonreciprocal quantum devices, has not been reported yet. Here, we propose the coupled photonic crystal and metallic nanoparticle structure, where through strong local field with high helicity, the rate of circularly polarized photons emitting into photonic crystal waveguide is one order larger than that without the nanoparticle and the linewidth of Rabi splitting spectra is about one-tenth of that with only the nanoparticle, both with $sim$ 95$%$ photons propagating unidirectionally, which can be utilized in directional quantum light sources.",

        "abstract": "Electromagnetic vacuum engineering in nanostructures can be used to tailor the light\u2013emitter interaction at the subwavelength scale. Here, by embedding a nanocavity quantum electrodynamic system in an evanescent vacuum, we theoretically investigate high-dielectric constant enhanced photon\u2013exciton coupling. The evanescent depth decreases as the dielectric constant of the embedding medium increases. Thus, more confined evanescent fields are obtained owing to faster exponential decay of an evanescent wave, which is used to obtain a larger coupling coefficient enhancement. The enhanced coupling coefficients are also demonstrated by changing the Ag nanorod size and the gap distance between the nanoparticle and plate. To significantly enhance the absolute value of the coupling coefficients, the Ag cylindrical nanorod can be replaced by the Ag pyramid or bipyramid. Evanescent vacuum induced strong photon\u2013exciton coupling would have a significant influence on the fundamental physics of the subwavelength-confined cavity quantum electrodynamics and on-chip quantum information processing and scalable quantum networks.",

To reduce laser disturbance among adjacent nanostructures, here we theoretically demonstrate two-qubit entanglement modulated by an evanescent field of a dielectric nanowire in an emitter-AgNP coupled system. This coupled system is considered as a nano-cavity system embedded in an evanescent vacuum. Through varying the amplitude of evanescent field, the concurrence of steady-state entanglement can be modified from 0 to 0.75. Because the interaction between emitters and the nanowire is much weaker than that inside the coupled system, the range of modulation for two-qubit entanglement is insensitive to their distance. The evanescent field controlled entangled state engineering provides the possibility to avoid optical crosstalk for on-chip steady-state entanglement.",

Cervus 3.0 analysis showed that mean PIC value of 16 microsatellites, mean number of allele, and mean expected heterozygosity were 0.7025, 6.63, and 0.7405, respectively. The combined probability of exclusion was 0.99922456 when both parents were unknown and the combined probability of exclusion was 0.99999557 when only one of the parental genotype was known, with the confidence level of 95%. Further simulations based on allele frequencies suggested that to achieve the requirements of paternity test usually took 8 to 12 microsatellite loci when both parents were unknown and 5 to 8 microsatellite loci when one parent was known. Out of 647 progenies, 94.6% were assigned to their parental pairs without the information of both parents in parentage analysis, which were lower than the theoretical assignment rates predicted by the Cervus simulations. This could be explained by the relationship between the candidate parents or existence of null and by typing errors. The identification of 9 families was useful for linkage analysis of Jian Carp and QTL location, also for marker assisted selection for economical traits.",

        "abstract": "Common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) is one of the most economically important fish species all over the world,whose economical traits are mostly quantitatively controlled by polygene. Screening of the genes and markers which control the quantitative traits has strong practical value. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are parts of complementary DNAs (cDNAs) with certain gene function. It provides us more information than other neutral markers. The association of EST markers with phenotypes can increase our understanding of the biochemical pathways and mechanisms affecting economically important traits. Thus,traditional marker assisted selection (MAS) can be replaced by direct gene selection for targeted traits. In this study,EST-SSRs were used to analyze the genomic DNA of 92 progenies which derived from F2 of the cross Barbless carp\u00d7Hebao-cold tolerance red carp by using\" Pseudo Testcross\" strategy. F1 were used as the parents of the 92 full-sib progeny. A total of 8 EST-SSRs markers were found from the 70 polymorphic EST-SSRs to be closely related to growth traits of common carp by single marker regression in Windows Map Manager 2.0 software. Results uncovered HLJE203,HLJE335 and HLJE222 had a significant impact on body length;HLJE225,HLJE231,HLJE599,HLJE203 and HLJE222 had a significant impact on body height,and HLJE339,HLJE225,HLJE269 and HLJE599 significantly correlated with body width. The variance explained by these loci,ranged 4. 00% to 12. 00%. HLJE222 and HLJE225 at 0.1% significant level closely linked to the gene related to body height and width of common carp. The number of alleles and genotypes in each locus were 2-3 and 2-4 respectively. In addition,the genotypes of these correlative loci were determined by t-test. The result showed that there existed some genotypes at each locus which had positive correlation with growth traits and some had negative correlation with growth traits. The significantly positive correlation genotypes of each locus may be preferred in carp molecular marker assistant breeding selection and the negative correlation genotypes of each locus may be eliminated through selection. This provided us valuable information for carp molecular marker assistant breeding selection. The homology identity of the 8 correlative ESTs was determined by GenBank of NCBI blast programmer on the amino acid levels. It was found,through BLAST analysis,that 3 ESTs with significant similarity to the known functional sequences in GenBank. HLJE225 was highly homologous to the known cold-inducible RNA binding protein of Danio rerio with an identity of 97%. HLJE222 was highly homologous to the known DAZ associated protein 1 of Danio rerio with an identity of 97%. HLJE599 was highly homologous to the known ribosomal protein L6 of Ictalurus punctatus with an identity of 87%. The other 5 ESTs were not significantly homologous to any of the known functional genes from GenBank. It was reported that cold-inducible RNA-binding proteins (CIRP) as well as CBF (c-repeat-binding factor) could increase the freezing tolerance,meanwhile they had negative impact on the growth. It \u2019s also presumed that the genes coding DAZ associated protein 1 and ribosomal protein L6 were associated with growth traits of common carp. These functional genes and genotypes might be used for the QTL mapping and marker assisted selection for important growth traits.",

Eight haplotypes were detected from 100 individuals, of which 94.06 % belonged to five haplotypes(H1, H2, H4, H5, H6). Cyprinus carpio blue var has only one haplotype, C. c.Red mirror carp has two haplotypes, and the other varieties including Cyprinus carpio Frigid carp, C. c. Songpu carp and C. c. Songpu mirror carp had five. Haplotype diversity(Hd) was 0.160\u00b10.070 ~ 0.811\u00b10.055, the highest Hd frequency was observed in Frigid carp. The AMOVA and cluster analysis revealed that genetic distance between varieties(50.28%) was a little higher than that within varieties(49.72%), and the FST ranged from 0.7114 0.831 2. Compared with the others varieties, Cyprinus carpio blue var exhibited the biggest differences. According to the evolutionary tree based on genetic distance, five varieties could be divided into three groups, the first group included Frigid carp and Red mirror carp, the second included Songpu mirror carp and Songpu carp,and the last included Cyprinus carpio blue var. With the exception of Cyprinus carpio blue var, all varieties shared the same haplotypes(H2, H4, H5, H6), which may be due to cross breeding. This study also indicated that DNA barcoding is a practical tool for analyzing the hereditary of different varieties. However, some limitations still exist.",

        "abstract": "Marker-assisted selection is commonly used to find molecular markers or genes associated with eco-nomic traits that are often controlled by multiple genes and inherited as quantitative traits.Eye diameter(ED) and eye cross(EC) are two of the most important quantitative traits in common carp.They are also important mor-phological characteristics often used in fish taxonomy.We used a full-sib family(68 individuals) of hybrid mirror carp(Cyprinus carpio L.) to analyze the correlation between 164 microsatellite markers,obtained from a bacterial artificial chromosome(BAC),with ED and EC.We obtained 401 alleles and 463 genotypes from the 164 markers.We used a general liner model with permutation test(10 000 times) to evaluate the relationship between the geno-types and the two traits.Twenty-two of the SSR markers had significant correlation with ED and/or EC(P<0.05).Six SSR markers,including CAFS1526,were significantly correlated with ED(P<0.05) and 11 SSR markers,in-cluding CAFS0882,were significantly correlated with EC(P<0.05).Five SSR markers,including CAFS1298,had significant correlation with both ED and EC(P<0.05),and CAFS1298 and CAFS1423 were highly significantly correlated with both ED and EC(P<0.01).The genotypes at each marker related to the two traits were obtained using Duncan's multiple comparison test.The markers significantly related to ED and EC were assigned to a linkage map,and nine markers were consistent with the QTL mapping for ED or EC,which explained 13.3\u201320.9% of the phenotypic variance.These functional markers from the BAC and its genotypes may be used for both MAS and constructing an integrated linkage map with a physical map of the common carp.",

Methods: A prospective study by convenience sampling was delivered and self-designed record form was used to investigate patients with tracheal intubation in three ICUs in a Grade Three Class A Children's hospital in Shanghai from October 2010 to May 2011. Results: Totally 247 patients were recorded effectively and 27 children (10.9%)underwent 33 UEXs. The UEX rate was 11.2% and 1.77 events per 100 intubation days. The reintubation rates of neonates and general patients was 66.7% and 88.9%, respectively. The risk factors of UEX were associated with working years of on duty nurses, nursing manpower, children's age, physical constrains and sedation usage. Conclusions: We should strengthen young nurses' training to improve their assessment and predictability abilities, increase nursing manpower, use sedation properly, and restrict body effectively to reduce UEX.",

        "abstract": "Objective To explore the effect of individualized bowel management of children with pseudo functional fecal incontinence. Methods A total of 40 children with functional fecal incontinence who sought medical help at an outpatient clinic were given indivi-dualized bowel management.The quality of life of children was assessed on 1st,2nd,and 3rd month,and their defecation condition was investigated with a self-designed questionnaire. Results The quality of life of children was significantly improved as the intervention progressed(P<0.01).At 3 months following intervention,the children moved their bowel 3.8 times per week on average,with the absence of fecal incontinence.All parents had accurate cognition on bowel management. Conclusion Individualized bowel management for children with functional fecal incontinence can effectively improve their quality of life,and ensure excellent treatment effect in the short term.",

        "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat exerts prominent angiogenic effects which may lead to a variety of vasculopathic conditions in AIDS patients. Because endothelial cells undergo prominent cytoskeletal rearrangement during angiogenesis, we investigated the specific effects of Tat on the endothelial cell actin cytoskeleton. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Tat, at a level of 200 ng/ml (equivalent to 52 ng of Tat/ml), caused stress fiber disassembly, peripheral retraction, and ruffle formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human lung microvascular endothelial cells. At 600 ng of GST-Tat/ml (157 ng of Tat/ml), actin structures were lost, and severe cytoskeletal collapse occurred. In contrast, GST-Tat harboring mutations within either the cysteine-rich or basic domains exerted minimal effects on the endothelial cytoskeleton. HUVEC expressing a DsRed-Tat fusion protein displayed similar actin rearrangements, followed by actin collapse, whereas neighboring nontransfected cells retained normal actin structures. Because active mutants of p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) induce identical changes in actin dynamics, we hypothesized that Tat exerts its cytoskeletal effects through PAK1. GST-Tat activated PAK1 within 5 min, and adenovirus delivery of a kinase-dead PAK1 [PAK1(K298A)] completely prevented cytoskeletal collapse induced by GST-Tat or DsRed-Tat and also blocked downstream activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Further, GST-Tat increased phosphorylation of the NADPH oxidase subunit p47(phox) and caused its rapid redistribution to membrane ruffles. PAK1(K298A) blocked p47(phox) phosphorylation, and interference with NADPH oxidase function through superoxide scavenging or through expression of a transdominant inhibitor, p67(V204A), prevented GST-Tat-induced alterations in the actin cytoskeleton. We conclude that Tat induces actin cytoskeletal rearrangements through PAK1 and downstream activation of the endothelial NADPH oxidase.",

        "abstract": "There is no effective treatment for recurrent or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Hereditary MTC is associated with mutations in the RET protooncogene, which encodes for a tyrosine kinase. We postulated that Src tyrosine kinases regulate MTC proliferation. Proliferation of the human MTC cell line, TT, was examined in the presence of a Src-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PP2, or genistein. Cell counts were performed with a Coulter counter or by flow cytometry. DNA synthesis was evaluated by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. A cell death ELISA was used to assess apoptosis. Akt phosphorylation was determined by Western immunoblot. MAPK activity was measured using an immunoprecipitation kinase assay, and MAPK inhibition was achieved with SB202190 (p38 MAPK) and PD098059 (MAPK kinase). Data were analyzed by ANOVA. Compared with controls, PP2 reduced DNA synthesis, abolished Akt phosphorylation, and increased apoptosis. The MAPK kinase inhibitor, PD098059, attenuated DNA synthesis, whereas genistein caused modest declines in cell count and DNA synthesis and minimal changes in apoptosis. We conclude that Src-dependent MTC proliferation occurs via increased DNA synthesis and reduced apoptosis. The latter effect may be mediated by Akt survival signals. Modulation of Src activity is a potential therapeutic target in MTC.",

        "abstract": "Growth factors initiate cytoskeletal rearrangements tightly coordinated with nuclear signaling events. We hypothesized that the angiogenic growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), may utilize oxidants that are site-directed to a complex critical to both cytoskeletal and mitogenic signaling. We identified the WASP-family verprolin homologous protein-1 (WAVE1) as a binding partner for the NADPH oxidase adapter p47phox within membrane ruffles of VEGF-stimulated cells. Within 15 min of VEGF stimulation, p47phox coprecipitated with WAVE1, with the ruffle and oxidase agonist Rac1, and with the Rac1 effector PAK1. VEGF also increased p47phox phosphorylation, oxidant production, and ruffle formation, all of which were dependent upon PAK1 kinase activity. The antioxidant Mn (III) tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin and ectopic expression of either the p47-binding WAVE1 domain or the WAVE1-binding p47phox domain decreased VEGF-induced ruffling, whereas the active mutant p4-(S303D, S304D,S328D) stimulated oxidant production and formation of circular dorsal ruffles. Both kinase-dead PAK1-(K298A) and Mn (III) tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin decreased c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation by VEGF, whereas dominant-negative JNK did not block ruffle formation, suggesting a bifurcation of mitogenic and cytoskeletal signaling events at or distal to the oxidase but proximal to JNK. Thus, WAVE1 may act as a scaffold to recruit the NADPH oxidase to a complex involved with both cytoskeletal regulation and downstream JNK activation.",

Overexpression of p47 phox increased apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines independent of p53 and mismatch-repair competency. p47 phox was found to interact with the c-Abl adapter Abl interactor-1 (ABI-1), and p47 phox coprecipitated with both ABI-1 and c-Abl.

        "abstract": "The HIV-1 accessory protein Tat has been found to exert profound effects on vascular cell behavior. Recently, Tat has been found to activate the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK1, SAPK) MAP kinase in lymphoid cells. We found that purified Tat rapidly activated JNK1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and ECV-304 cells, and coculture of ECV-304 cells with Tat-transfected HeLa cells resulted in persistent activation of JNK1. In addition, lower doses of Tat potentiated TNFalpha-induced JNK1 activation, although higher doses paradoxically diminished JNK1 activation by TNFalpha. Treatment of ECV-304 cells with Tat acutely increased intracellular oxidant levels, and Tat-induced oxidant activity was decreased by two structurally distinct NADPH oxidase inhibitors, diphenylene iodonium and apocynin. Both oxidase inhibitors and the thiol antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine decreased Tat-induced JNK1 activation in parallel with reduction in oxidant levels. Activation of JNK1 by Tat was also inhibited by cytochalasin B, suggesting that Tat signaling was dependent upon intact cytoskeletal function. Indeed, JNK1 activation by Tat was associated with actin microfilament rearrangement. We conclude that HIV Tat may cause acute and persistent activation of the JNK MAP kinase through activation of a specific oxidase.",

        "abstract": "Reactive oxygen intermediates have been implicated in the transduction of TNF\u03b1 signals, although the source of such oxidants has not been established. We found that activation of ECV-304 cells by TNF\u03b1 was accompanied by a transient burst of oxidants and activation of JNK, both of which were suppressed by two distinct inhibitors of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase and the thiol antioxidant N -acetyl cysteine (NAC). We cloned partial and full-length cDNA sequences from ECV-304 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), respectively, for p47 phox , demonstrating that these nonphagocytic cells express this adapter protein known to specifically initiate assembly of the NADPH oxidase in professional phagocytes. A mutant p47 phox , defective in the first Src homology 3 (SH3) domain (p47W(193)R), diminished JNK activation by TNF\u03b1. Surprisingly, p47 phox resided entirely in the particulate, not cytosolic, fraction of cells. Immunostaining suggested partial colocalization with cytoskeletal elements, and cytoskeletal disrupters decreased both oxidant production and JNK activation by TNF\u03b1. A p47-GFP fusion protein localized to the cortical cytoskeleton in living cells; further, stimulation of cells with TNF\u03b1 caused a marked concentration of p47-GFP in membrane ruffles, actin-rich structures associated with intense respiratory burst activity in stimulated neutrophils. We conclude that nonphagocytic cells express p47 phox , which appears to localize to the cytoskeleton and participate in TNF\u03b1 signaling. We speculate that this physical targeting may prove important in conferring signal specificity and enhancing signaling efficiency of unstable oxidants.",

        "abstract": "Vascular endothelial activation is an early step during leukocyte/endothelial adhe- sion and transendothelial leukocyte mi- gration in inflammatory states. Leukocyte transmigration occurs through intercellu- lar gaps between endothelial cells. Vascu- lar endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) is a predominant component of endothelial adherens junctions that regulates intercel- lular gap formation. We found that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) caused tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin, separa- tion of lateral cell-cell junctions, and inter- cellular gap formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolay- ers. These events appear to be regulated by intracellular oxidant production through endothelial NAD(P)H (nicotin- amide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase because antioxidants and expres- sion of a transdominant inhibitor of the NADPH oxidase, p67(V204A), effectively blocked the effects of TNF on all 3 param- eters of junctional integrity. Antioxidants and p67(V204A) also decreased TNF- induced JNK activation. Dominant-nega- tive JNK abrogated VE-cadherin phos- phorylation and junctional separation, suggesting a downstream role for JNK. Finally, adenoviral delivery of the kinase dead PAK1(K298A) decreased TNF-in- duced JNK activation, VE-cadherin phos- phorylation, and lateral junctional separa- tion, consistent with the proposed involvement of PAK1 upstream of the NADPH oxidase. Thus, PAK-1 acts in con- cert with oxidase during TNF-induced oxi- dant production and loss of endothelial cell junctional integrity. (Blood. 2004;104: 3214-3220)",

        "abstract": "The purpose of the current study was to determine whether maternal circulating components could regulate oxidative status of glutathione redox cycle and adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells (ECs).Maternal plasma was extracted from venous blood obtained from normal term pregnant women and from women with preeclampsia (PE). Normal and PE pregnancies were defined as American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists criteria. Confluent ECs were incubated with EC growth medium (EGM) containing 20% plasma from women with normal (n = 8) and PE (n = 8) pregnancies for 4 hours. ECs incubated with EGM only were used as control. EC oxidative status was assessed by measuring cellular glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. Adhesion molecule expressions for intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), P-selectin, and E-selectin were determined by colorimetric assays detected on EC surface by UV spectrophotometer at OD 450 nm. Data are presented as mean +/- SE and analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). A P value < .05 was set as statistically significant.Cellular GR activity was reduced approximately 35% in ECs treated with normal plasma and 70% in ECs treated with PE plasma compared to that in untreated control cells: 0.072 +/- 0.014 (P < .05), 0.039 +/- 0.006 (P < .01), versus 0.117 +/- 0.010 U/mg cellular protein, respectively. In contrast, GPx activity was slightly increased in ECs treated with normal plasma and significantly increased in ECs treated with PE plasma compared to that in untreated control cells: 0.059 +/- 0.005, 0.075 +/- 0.012 (P < .05) versus 0.044 +/- 0.002 U/mg cellular protein, respectively. P-selectin, E-selectin, and VCAM expressions were elevated in cells treated with normal plasma but significantly increased in cells treated with PE plasma compared to those of untreated controls: P-selectin--0.18 +/- 0.03, 0.35 +/- 0.04 versus 0.04 +/- 0.01 OD 450 nm, P < .01; E--selectin-0.06 +/- 0.02, 0.10 +/- 0.02 (P < .05) versus 0.03 +/- 0.01 OD 450 nm; VCAM--0.12 +/- 0.02, 0.16 +/- 0.03 (P < .01) versus 0.08 +/- 0.02 OD 450 nm, respectively. There was no difference for ICAM expression in cells treated with normal or PE plasma compared to controls.These data suggest that endothelial pro- and anti-oxidative status could be directly affected by circulating components during pregnancy. Reduced cellular GR activity and increased GPx activity accompany increased inflammatory reactions in ECs responding to circulating \"toxic\" factors in preeclampsia.",

Enhanced peroxynitrite formation in the vasculature of women with PE was also reported. This study was to test whether EC oxidative stress induced by peroxynitrite could up-regulate EC CAM expression, and whether heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has protective effects on this peroxynitrite-induced cellular response.Confluent ECs were stimulated with 3-morpholinosydnonimine-HCl (SIN-1, a peroxynitrite generator) alone or combined with Mn(III) tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin pentachloride (MnTMPyP, a peroxynitrite scavenger) up to 4 hours. EC surface protein expressions for ICAM, VCAM, P-selectin, and E-selectin were measured by colorimetric assay. ECs were also treated with Sn(IV) mesophorphyrin IX dichloride (SnMP, a HO-1 inhibitor) to determine if HO-1 was involved in the increased CAM expression in stressed cells. Protein and mRNA expressions for HO-1 were determined by Western blot analysis and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Data are presented as the mean +/- SE and analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA).Endothelial CAM expressions for VCAM, P-selectin, and E-selectin, but not ICAM, were significantly increased in SIN-1-treated ECs. Protein and mRNA expressions for HO-1 were also up-regulated in cells treated with SIN-1. MnTMPyP blocked both mRNA and protein expressions for HO-1, whereas SnMP only blocked HO-1 protein expression. Both MnTMPyP and SnMP abolished SIN-1-induced up-regulation of VCAM, P-selectin, and E-selectin expression in ECs.Peroxynitrite-induced EC oxidative stress produces differential effects on CAM expression, which may be mediated by HO-1 regulation. Our results suggest that increased peroxynitrite formation in the maternal vasculature may contribute to the increased CAM expression and enhanced neutrophil-endothelial interaction associated with PE.",

        "abstract": "Increased endothelial permeability is associated with increased oxidative stress in the maternal vasculature in women with preeclampsia. This study was to determine if oxidative stress elicited by peroxynitrite could lead to an increase in endothelial permeability.Endothelial oxidative stress was produced by adding 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1, a peroxynitrite generator) to the cell culture. Confluent endothelial cells (ECs) grown in cell culture inserts were treated with SIN-1 at a concentration of 0.5 mM alone or in combination with MnTMPyP (a peroxynitrite scavenger) or superoxide dismutase (SOD). EC permeability was determined by measuring EC electrical resistance (ER) and horseradish peroxide (HRP) leakage. Data are presented as means +/- SE and analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Junctional protein expression and distribution for vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, occludin, and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at tyrosine 397 [pY397] were examined by fluorescent staining of ECs.First, ER was significantly reduced and HRP leakage was significantly increased in ECs treated with SIN-1 compared to those in control cells, ER: 26.97 +/- 1.41 versus 42.27 +/- 0.40 Omega.cm2, P <.01; HRP: 0.26 +/- 0.07 versus 0.02 +/- 0.01 OD 470 nm, P <.01, respectively. Second, cells treated with SIN-1 showed formation of gaps and disorganized VE-cadherin and occludin distribution at cell contact regions. FAK[pY397] expression was completely lost in cells treated with SIN-1. Finally, these functional and morphologic changes in ECs induced by SIN-1 were blocked in cells pretreated with MnTMPyP and SOD.Disorganization of junctional proteins and dephosphorylation of FAK[pY397] may account for the increased endothelial permeability induced by oxidative stress associated with preeclampsia.",

Clinical data suggest that Digibind (a polyclonal sheep digoxin binding Fab fragment) binds to EDLF and may have the potential to attenuate vasoconstriction and other clinical symptoms of preeclampsia. This study was undertaken to determine if Digibind could attenuate increased endothelial inflammatory response induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha).Confluent endothelial cells were treated with TNFalpha at different concentrations with or without Digibind in culture. Endothelial adhesion molecule ICAM, VCAM and E-selectin expressions were determined by an immunoassay directly detected on the endothelial surface. Effects of Digibind on TNFalpha-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase expressions were also examined.(1) TNFalpha induced dose-dependent increases in ICAM, VCAM and E-selectin expressions in endothelial cells; (2) Digibind could attenuate and reduce TNFalpha-induced upregulation of endothelial E-selectin, ICAM and VCAM expressions. The blocking effect was in a concentration dependent manner; (3) Digibind had no effects on TNFalpha-induced upregulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, but could block TNFalpha-induced downregulation of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase beta1 expression.Digibind may exert beneficial effects by preserving cell membrane Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase function and consequently to offset increased inflammatory response in endothelial cells.",

        "abstract": "The nucleus lentiformis mesencephali and the nucleus of the basal optic root in birds, homologous to the nucleus of the optic tract and the terminal nuclei of the accessory optic tract in mammals, are involved in optokinetic nystagmus. The present study provides the first electrophysiological evidence that reversible blockade of the pigeon nucleus of the basal optic root by lidocaine can change visual responsiveness of pretectal neurons in a direction-dependent manner. Thirty pretectal cells examined were classified as unidirectional (80%), bidirectional (10%) and omnidirectional (10%) cells according to their directional selectivity. Among the unidirectional cells, seven cells changed firing rates in all directions of motion, 11 changed visual responses only in the preferred directions and six others did not change their responsiveness during lidocaine. Most of the bidirectional cells changed firing rates in the temporonasal direction, and two-thirds of the omnidirectional cells showed these changes in all directions. Thirteen lidocaine administration sites were marked within the nucleus of the basal optic root and 19 recording sites were marked within the nucleus lentiformis mesencephali. This histological verification indicates that the effects of lidocaine blockade in the accessory optic nucleus on the directional selectivity and visual responsiveness of pretectal cells appear to be related, to some extent, to the location of drug injections in the nucleus of the basal optic root. This study has found that visual neurons in the nucleus of the basal optic root, which predominantly prefer vertical and backward motion, could modulate the directional selectivity and visual responsiveness of neurons in the nucleus lentiformis mesencephali, which mainly prefer horizontal motion. It is conceivable that both nuclei work together in coordination and in competition during optokinetic nystagmus.",

In this study, 14 patients with lupus myelopathy (LM) from our centre were retrospectively studied. Another 23 patients with other neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) features were enrolled as a comparison group. The morbidity of LM was evaluated by the ASIA Impairment Scale. The clinical and serological characteristics and prognostic factors for LM were investigated. The age, gender, duration of SLE, non-CNS disease activity and autoantibody profile in patients with LM was not different in the NPSLE cohort. A relatively low prevalence of anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) in LM sera compared to NPSLE (28.6% vs 52.2%, P = 0.19) was observed. Longitudinal lesion detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was identified in 33.3% of patients with LM, whereas 50% showed focal speckle-like lesions. The morbidity of LM is 50%. Muscle strength of grade 3 or higher on admission was a strong indicator for a better prognosis (P = 0.006), whereas other parameters including longitudinal lesion, sensory deficit level, disease activity and aPL did not discriminate good from poor outcome in LM. Early aggressive immunosuppressive therapy (within 2 weeks of onset of myelopathy) tend to associate with a favourable outcome (P = 0.07).",

The expression levels of five type I IFIGs (LY6E, OAS3, IFIT4, OAS1 and OAS2) were significantly higher in the SLE group than in the healthy and non-SLE controls. LY6E gene that had highest expression was chosen to analyse the association of expression level with clinical features. Compared to low LY6E expression group, SLE patients with high LY6E expression had higher SLEDAI-2K score, increased 24 h urine protein and lower blood C3 complement. Active SLE patients had more elevated LY6E expression than stable patients. And LY6E expression levels in patients with SLE were strongly correlated with their SLEDAI-2K scores. Our results indicate that increased expression of LY6E gene in peripheral blood cells in patients with SLE is correlated with lupus activity and may be a useful, noninvasive biomarker for assessing SLE disease activity.",

        "abstract": "Cellulose biosynthesis is performed exclusively by plasma membrane-localized cellulose synthases (CESAs). Therefore, the trafficking of CESAs to and from the plasma membrane is an important mechanism for regulating cellulose biosynthesis. CESAs were recently identified as cargo proteins of the classic adaptor protein 2 (AP2) complex of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) pathway. The AP2 complex of the CME pathway is conserved in yeast, animals, and plants, and has been well-characterized in many systems. In contrast, the recently discovered TPLATE complex (TPC), which is proposed to function as a CME adaptor complex, is only conserved in plants and a few other eukaryotes. In this study, we discovered that the TWD40-2 protein, a putative member of the TPC, is also important for the endocytosis of CESAs. Genetic analysis between TWD40-2 and AP2M of the AP2 complex revealed that the roles of TWD40-2 in CME are both distinct from and cooperative with the AP2 complex. Loss of efficient CME in twd40-2-3 resulted in the unregulated overaccumulation of CESAs at the plasma membrane. In seedlings of twd40-2-3 and other CME-deficient mutants, a direct correlation was revealed between endocytic deficiency and cellulose content deficiency, highlighting the importance of controlled CESA endocytosis in regulating cellulose biosynthesis.",

        "abstract": "Cellulose synthesis occurs exclusively at the plasma membrane by cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs). Therefore, delivery of CSCs to discrete sites at the plasma membrane is critical for cellulose synthesis. Despite their significance, the delivery of CSCs is poorly understood. Here we used proteomics approaches, functional genetics, and live cell imaging to show that the de novo secretion of CSCs is mediated by cooperation among cellulose synthase interactive 1 (CSI1), the plant-specific protein PATROL1, and exocyst complex in  We propose that CSI1 plays a role in marking the docking site, which allows CSCs-containing vesicles access to the plasma membrane through its interaction with microtubules. PATROL1 assists in exocytosis by its interaction with multiple components, including CSI1, CSCs, and exocyst subunits. Both PATROL1 and the exocyst complex determine the rate of delivery of CSCs to the plasma membrane. By monitoring the exocyst complex, PATROL1, CSI1, and CSCs dynamics in real time, we present a timeline of events for exocytosis of CSCs. Our findings provide unique insights into the evolution of exocytosis in eukaryotes.",

This AR biofilter can be divided into three stages and can manage 50 m3 landfill leachate per day. The physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of AR were analyzed for evaluating the AR biofilter as leachate treatment host. The results revealed that over 87.8%-96.2% of COD and 96.9%-99.4% of ammonia nitrogen were removed by the three-stage AR biofilter when the influent leachate COD and ammonia nitrogen concentration were in the range 5478-10842 mg/L and 811-1582 mg/L, respectively. The final effluent was inodorous and pale yellow with COD and ammonia nitrogen below 267-1020 mg/L and 6-45 mg/L, respectively. The three-stage AR biofilter had efficient nitrification but relative poor denitrification capacity with a total nitrogen (TN) removal of 58%-73%. The external temperature of AR biofilter did not influence the total ammonia nitrogen removal significantly. It was concluded that the scale-up AR biofilter can work very well and can be a promising technology for the treatment of landfill leachate.",

Proliferation of the two types of cells in response to PHA was measured using colorimetric MTT assay. Macrophage respiratory burst stimulated by Con A was measured using chemiluminescence assay. Results showed that BPA (0.054-5.4 mg/L), estradiol (0.0002-2.0 mg/L) and hydrocortisone (5-50 mg/L) significantly induced Carassius auratus lymphocyte proliferation while higher doses of hydrocortisone (500-5000 mg/L) appeared to be inhibitory. BPA (0.005-50 mg/L), estradiol (0.005-800 mg/L) and hydrocortisone (0.005-500 mg/L) markedly enhanced macrophage proliferation, whereas higher doses of BPA (500-1000 mg/L) appeared to inhibit cell proliferation. Furthermore, higher dosage of BPA (50 mg/L) and hydrocortisone (50 and 500 mg/L) suppressed the macrophages respiratory burst while estradiol is stimulative all the doses tested (0.05-500 mg/L). In conclusion, BPA could have immunotoxicity to Carassius auratus and functional changes of lymphocyte and macrophage in Carassius auratus may be different between low and high dosages.",

In situ X-ray diffraction shows that the FePt nanocomposite films undergo a phase transformation from a disordered FCC phase to an ordered L10 phase between 673 and 773 K. The coercivity is 306 kA\u00b7m-1 whiles the average grain sizes is about 10 nm in the optimized FePt alloy film sample annealed at 673 K. The adjustable coercivity and fine grain size suggest that this FePt nanocomposites system is suitable as recording media at extremely high areal density.",

Rabbit anti-TSP50 polyclonal antibodies were prepared by means of intramuscular injection of pcDNA3.1-TSP50 into the rabbits. Titers of the anti-sera were measured by ELISA and Western blotting with the E. coli cell lysate containing the induced GST-TSP50 fusion protein as an antigen.

The poly (amidoamine) dendrimer encapsulated gold nanoparticles (PAMAM-Au) played dual roles in the proposed sensing platform which not only accelerated the electron transfer process of sensing, but also increased the efficiency of the immobilized antibody. The HRP-labeled antigen, as the signal labels in the immunosensor, was introduced to catalyze the following reaction of the substrate hydroquinone with the aid of H\u2082O\u2082 in the competitive reaction. On the basis of the signal amplification of PAMAM-Au, the signal intensity was linearly related to the concentration of norfloxacin in the range of 1 &mu;g&middot;L\u207b10 mg&middot;L. All the results showed that the proposed strategy with low LOD (0.3837 &mu;g&middot;L) and favorable recovery (91.6\u207b106.1%) in the practical sample, and it could provide a suitable protocol for norfloxacin detection in animal-derived foods with high sensitivity, good accuracy, and stability.",

AuNPs and graphene, with the advantages of great chemical stability, electrical conductivity, and large surface area, show exceptionally high sensitivity. The results of different modifications of the QCM sensor fabrication process were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the frequency shift of the MIP-QCM sensor showed a linear relationship with the concentration of the AM template in the range of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 to 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 mmol L\u22121 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 5.40 \u00d7 10\u22126 mmol L\u22121. The imprinting factor for AM reached 7.1, the selectivity coefficient for the analogues rimantadine (RT), adamantine (AMT) and 1-chloroadamantane (CMT) were 7.3, 5.6, and 6.1, respectively. Here, a highly sensitive, selective and stable QCM sensor prepared via the imprinting approach is reported for the first time for detection of AM from animal-derived food samples.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A label-free electrochemical impedimetric immunosensor was developed to monitor melamine, and it was successfully applied for the detection of melamine in spiked dairy samples. The poly (pyrrole-co-pyrrole-1-propionic acid) and reduced graphene oxide polymer layer (rGO-PPYPPA) were co-electrodeposited on the electrode using a one-pot method, thus obtaining a copolymer layer with favorable electrochemical properties. A competitive immunoassay was used for quantitative analysis of melamine. The rGO-PPYPPA copolymer improved the conductivity of the sensor and provided adequate anchor sites for antibody binding, thus enhancing immuno-binding. The specific immune-interactions at the electrode surface that restrict the electron transfer of the redox probe Fe(CN) 6  3\u2212/4\u2212  lead to changes in electrochemical impedance, and the changes in impedance correlated to specific concentrations of melamine. The immunosensor displays a wide detection range (10 \u221211 \u221210 \u22122  mol L \u22121 ), low limit of detection (1.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u221211  mol L \u22121 ) and acceptable recovery (84.6%\u2013100.3%) in real samples.

        "abstract": "For the determination of dopamine (DA) in serum samples, a quenching-type electrochemiluminescence sensor (MIECLS) was constructed in this study. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) enhanced by covalent organic frameworks (COFs)-based hybrid and oligoaniline-crosslinked gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) imprinting recognition sites were introduced in electrochemiluminescence (ECL)\ufeff system at the first time. The porous COFs-based hybrid with large specific surface area was modified on the electrode firstly to hold more UCNPs and imprinting recognition sites. AuNPs was employed in the \ufeffdeveloped sensor for two objectives: 1) AuNPs on the \ufeffCOFs-based hybrid enabled the hybrid to tunnel the electrons, which helped to improve the ECL intensity; 2) AuNPs-based thioaniline units (PATP@AuNPs) electropolymerized on the electrode in the presence of template to form oligoaniline-crosslinked AuNPs matrix. Then the exclusion of template from matrix yielded the \ufeffmolecularly three-dimensional imprinted contours with conductivity, which \ufefffacilitated specific recognition and further amplified\ufeff the ECL. The double recognition mode in this work involves the recognition effect of imprinted contours and quenching effect of o-benzoquinone species. The quantum chemical calculation was performed to analyze the possible recognition and the \ufeffbinding mechanisms of molecularly three-dimensional imprinted contours. The results showed imprinted contours could bind the targets by complementary spatial cavities and weak interactions. The proposed approach yielded\ufeff a wide detection range (10-10 M), low limit of detection (LOD\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d710 M) and acceptable recoveries (93.25-112.97%) in rat serum sample, demonstrating that the developed method holds great promise to be applied to DA detection in practical samples.",

        "abstract": "A label-free piezoelectric immunosensor was fabricated and applied to the detection of the antiviral drug amantadine (AM) in foods of animal origin. Experimental parameters associated with the fabrication and measurement process were optimized and are discussed here in detail. The proposed piezoelectric sensor is based on an immunosuppression format and uses a portable quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) chip. It was found to provide a good response to AM, with a sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD) of 33.9 and 1.3\u00a0ng\u00a0mL, respectively, as well as low cross-reactivity (CR, < 0.01%) with AM analogues. The immunosensor was further applied to quantify AM at three levels in spiked samples of typical foods of animal origin, and yielded recoveries of 83.2-93.4% and standard deviations (SDs, n\u2009=\u20093) of 2.4-4.5%, which are comparable to the results (recoveries: 82.6-94.3%; SDs: 1.7-4.2%) obtained using a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method. Furthermore, the piezoelectric immunosensing chip can be regenerated multiple (at least 20) times with low signal attenuation (about 10%). A sample analysis can be completed within 50\u00a0min (sample pretreatment: about 40\u00a0min, QCM measurement: 5\u00a0min). These results demonstrate that the developed piezoelectric immunosensor provides a sensitive, accurate, portable, and low-cost analytical strategy for the antiviral drug AM in foods of animal origin, and this label-free detection method could also be applied to analyze other targets in the field of food safety.

        "abstract": "Gluten and starch are the primary ingredients of the wheat. The complex reaction between the gluten and starch will occur during the thermal food processing, which will affect the digestibility. The effects of proteins on the digestibility of starch have been reported, but the effects of starch on the digestibility of proteins have not been well-researched. In this paper, the effects of starch on gluten digestion during the heating process were studied by the gluten-starch simulated system, and it was found that starch can enhance gluten digestion. When the complex of gluten-starch being 1:1 is heated at 100\u00b0C, the digestibility of gluten is higher, and more low-molecular weight peptides are produced. Results from the digestibility and digestion-peptide mapping of the gluten-starch complex at different conditions showed that the addition of starch during processing enhanced the digestion performance of gluten. Meanwhile, the secondary structure, intrinsic fluorescence, and microscopic structure of the gluten-starch complex were investigated to understand the mechanism of the enhancement. The digestion performance is related to the secondary structure variation during the thermal processing caused by hydration increase and disulfide bonds reduction. The gluten-starch-complex spatial structure is looser than gluten after heating, which could expose more protease cleavage sites. These results suggest that starch can protect gluten from aggregation in water and destroy the spatial structure of gluten with the assistant of heating, exposing more cleavage sites and enhancing gluten digestion.",

However, traditional region-based formulations often use classical level set functions, leading to complicated implementation and expensive computational costs, especially for image segmentation with multiple shape templates. To address these problems, in this paper we propose a novel segmentation formula based on the Potts model, where a reference image may contain more than one shape prior. A periodic condition and bounded region are used for the shape transformation, as we describe a new algorithm for formulation that can segment several objects simultaneously. Specifically, we focus on the use of characteristic functions as opposed to conventional classical level set functions for improved image processing efficiency. The reporting of four separate experiments using different images demonstrates the potential of the formulation and algorithm discussed.",

Traditional methods based on the Mumford\u2013Shah (MS) model require solving complicated diffusion equations evolving in irregular subdomains, leading to significant difficulties in efficient and accurate segmentation, especially in multiphase scenarios. In this paper, we propose a general framework to modify the MS model by using smoothing operators that can avoid the complicated implementation and inaccurate segmentation of traditional approaches. A detailed analysis connecting the smoothing operators and the diffusion equations is given to justify the modification. In addition, we present an efficient algorithm based on the direct augmented Lagrangian method, which requires fewer parameters than the commonly used augmented Lagrangian method. Typically, the smoothing operator in the general model is chosen to be Gaussian kernel, the bilateral kernel, and the directional diffusion kernel, respectively. Ample numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the modified model and the proposed minimization algorithm through various comparisons with existing approaches.",

Although camera pose estimation from points or lines is a well-studied problem in computer vision, a systematic treatment of these uncertainties remains an open question for accurate and robust pose estimation. In this paper, we address this question by utilizing the uncertainty of points and lines to achieve robust and accurate pose estimation. We propose an accurate subset selection scheme of points and lines based on their uncertainties for pose estimation. First, the uncertainties of straight line and line segments under Hough coordinate are introduced. Based on the uncertain points and lines, we derive the uncertainties of directional and distance constraints for pose estimation. We select these constraints with the lowest variance and apply them under direct linear transformation (DLT) for pose estimation. In experiment, the proposed method is evaluated against the other DLT-based methods and the state-of-arts in both synthetic and real image datasets.",

Dimensional inspection is usually achieved via comparing the scanned model of the inspection target with the CAD model to detect dimensional defects such as bending and missing material. Surface inspection is usually based on textures via image processing and analysis to detect defects such as pitting, crack, scratch, and corrosion. Existing systems used fixed predefined viewpoints to capture geometry and texture from the object. However, defects may appear at different locations, distinguishable defect features may not be captured by the fixed viewpoints. Thus, dynamical planning of the viewpoints is desired to provide better sensing parameters adaptive to actual local geometry, appearance and lighting conditions. This paper proposes a new robotic sensing framework for adaptive visual inspection. Viewpoints are planned based on individual object adaptive to different defect locations. Sensor parameters at each viewpoints are adaptive to the surface conditions for optimized geometry/image quality. Data from all viewpoints are fused together to provide an adaptive model.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we proposed an automatic crack detection method based on deep convolutional neural network \u2212U-Net [4]. Unlike existing machine learning based crack detection methods, we can process an image as a whole without patchifying, thanks to the encoder-decoder structure of U-Net. The segmentation result is output from the network as a whole, instead of aggregation from neighborhood patches. In addition, a new cost function based on distance transform is introduced to assign pixel-level weight according to the minimal distance to the ground truth segmentation. In experiments, we test the proposed method on two datasets of road crack images. The pixel-level segmentation accuracy is above 92% which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods significantly.",

The isolate was a Gram-stain-positive, aerobiotic, motile, endospore-forming and rod-shaped bacterium. The organism grew optimally at 30-33\u2009\u00b0C, pH 6.5-7.0 and in the absence of NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on the nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed high sequence similarity with Paenibacillus algorifonticola XJ259T (98.5\u2009%), Paenibacillus xinjiangensis B538T (96.8\u2009%), Paenibacillus glycanilyticus DS-1T (96.1\u2009%) and Paenibacillus lupini RLAHU15T (96.1\u2009%). The predominant cellular fatty acid and the only menaquinone were anteiso-C15:0 and MK-7, respectively. The main polar lipids of LNUB461T included phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and two unknown amino phospholipids (APL), and the cell-wall peptidoglycan was meso-diaminopimelic acid (A1\u03b3). The DNA G+C content of LNUB461T was 49.1 mol%. The DNA-DNA hybridization value between LNUB461T and the most closely related species (P. algorifonticola) was 41.8\u2009%. On the basis of these data, LNUB461T was classified as representing a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus liaoningensis sp. nov was proposed. The type strain is LNUB461T (=JCM 30712T=CGMCC 1.15101T). ",

In this study, molecular docking was used to screen for compounds that specifically target the deep cleft at the endonuclease active site in N-terminus of the RNA polymerase. Four potential compounds (NCI100226, NCI122653, NCI625583, and NCI403587) with high binding affinity for the active site were identified. Structural analysis of the binding conformation of each of these compound-PA-N complexes revealed that hydrophobic interaction and manganese ion chelation comprised the main interaction between the compounds and enzyme. The binding configuration stability and the number of hydrogen and ionic bonds were investigated by molecular dynamic simulations. The results indicated that NCI403587 could be a promising PA-N inhibitor, and may represent a potential new agent for the treatment of influenza.",

Here, we probe the principles enabling this functional diversity by exploiting the natural divergence in NE management strategies between the related fission yeasts Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Schizosaccharomyces japonicus [1-3]. We show that inactivation of Ned1, the phosphatidic acid phosphatase of the lipin family, by CDK phosphorylation is both necessary and sufficient to promote NE expansion required for \"closed\" mitosis in S. pombe. In contrast, Ned1 is not regulated during division in S. japonicus, thus limiting membrane availability and necessitating NE breakage. Interspecies gene swaps result in phenotypically normal divisions with the S. japonicus lipin acquiring an S. pombe-like mitotic phosphorylation pattern. Our results provide experimental evidence for the mitotic regulation of phosphatidic acid flux and suggest that the regulatory networks governing lipin activity diverged in evolution to give rise to strikingly dissimilar mitotic programs.",

        "abstract": "Many eukaryotes assemble a ring-shaped actomyosin network that contracts to drive cytokinesis. Unlike actomyosin in sarcomeres, which cycles through contraction and relaxation, the cytokinetic ring disassembles during contraction through an unknown mechanism. Here we find in  and  that, during actomyosin ring contraction, actin filaments associated with actomyosin rings are expelled as micron-scale bundles containing multiple actomyosin ring proteins. Using functional isolated actomyosin rings we show that expulsion of actin bundles does not require continuous presence of cytoplasm. Strikingly, mechanical compression of actomyosin rings results in expulsion of bundles predominantly at regions of high curvature. Our work unprecedentedly reveals that the increased curvature of the ring itself promotes its disassembly. It is likely that such a curvature-induced mechanism may operate in disassembly of other contractile networks.",

        "abstract": "Cells of a specific cell type may divide within a certain size range. Yet, functionally optimal cellular organization is typically maintained across different cell sizes, a phenomenon known as scaling. The mechanisms underlying scaling and its physiological significance remain elusive. Here we approach this problem by interfering with scaling in the rod-shaped fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces japonicus that relies on cellular geometry cues to position the division site. We show that S. japonicus uses the Cdc42 polarity module to adjust its geometry to changes in the cell size. When scaling is prevented resulting in abnormal cellular length-to-width aspect ratio, cells exhibit severe division site placement defects. We further show that despite the generally accepted view, a similar scaling phenomenon can occur in the sister species, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Our results demonstrate that scaling is required for normal cell function and delineate possible rules for cellular geometry maintenance in populations of proliferating cells.",

The event-triggered transmission scheme is introduced to mitigate the utility of limited network bandwidth. The developed filter combines the  H  \u221e  and     H  \u2212     indices. For this class of systems, the generalized Kalman\u2013Yakubovic\u2013Popov lemma-based finite-frequency FD filter design methods are invalid. To solve this problem, the nonlinear error dynamics are transformed into a linear parameter varying (LPV) system based on the use of a reformulated Lipschitz property and a new lemma is developed to capture the system performances in finite-frequency domain. By introducing slack variable techniques, sufficient conditions for the design of FD filter are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The proposed design method can significantly reduce the data transmission and achieve a better FD performance than that in full frequency domain. Finally, two examples are presented to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the new results.",

        "abstract": "Decreasing Pd usage whilst maintaining a superior performance is promising, but remains a challenge in the catalytic field. Herein, we have demonstrated the highly efficient promotion of Mo2N with a reduced amount of Pd for the liquid-phase hydrogenation reaction. The Mo2N (2-3 nm) was uniformly anchored onto mesoporous SBA-15 by using PMo12 as the Mo source. The small size and good dispersion of Mo2N is favourable for allowing their effective contact with post-loading Pd. This good contact is conducive to developing a synergistic catalyst, which was verified by studying the liquid-phase hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol (PNP) to p-aminophenol (PAP) with NaBH4 as the H source. The conversion ability of PNP to PAP on 1 wt% Pd-Mo2N/SBA-15 was vastly superior to 1 wt% Pd/SBA-15 and even better than 20 wt% Pd/SBA-15. The low-Pd, highly efficient catalysis is ascribed to the transfer of the electrons from Mo2N to Pd for the easy activation of H. The synergy can be affected by the type of support used. SBA-15 is superior to SiO2 and the other supports, which could be related to the large surface area and the plentiful number of pores on SBA-15, which is favourable to the dispersion of Pd and Mo2N, and the transfer/diffusion of the reactants. In particular, a highly efficient catalyst can be achieved at an even more reduced Pd loading (0.05 wt%). The current method describes the design of a highly efficient catalyst for the hydrogenation reaction using low amounts of noble metals.",

        "abstract": "The construction of noble metal-oxide nanocrystal hybrids (MOHs) with good interface contact, broadly tunable composition and high yield is critical for their application in the advanced fields. In this paper, a general route was developed for constructing MOHs with intimate interfacial contact based on the coordination of an organic agent with multiple kinds of metal precursors. In the synthesis, critic acid, desirable sources for metal nanoparticles (NPs; for example, Ag+ salts), oxides (for example, Zn2+ salts) and ethylene glycol were dissolved in water. After heating at low temperature to produce the precursor gels and subsequent calcination under air, one kind of the ions (Zn2+) was transformed into an oxide (ZnO) in company with the reduction of another ion (Ag+) to generate metal NPs (Ag). Benefitting from the uniform distribution of Ag and Zn precursor in the gels, the Ag/ZnO composites with good interface contact were finally formed. The Ag/ZnO hybrids can be used as effective catalysts for the catalytic reduction of p-nitrophenol and photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. Under optimized conditions, the Ag/ZnO showed a rate approximately 1.5 times higher than that of Degussa P25 TiO2 for the degradation of rhodamine B. The OH\u00b7 radicals and \u00b7O2 \u2212 play predominant roles in the photocatalytic reaction. The Ag/ZnO can also act as an effective catalyst for the reduction of p-nitrophenol with good reuse performance. The present route is also suitable to construct MOHs with other components (Pt/TiO2, Pt/ZnO, etc.). The route is promising to produce MOHs due to the virtues of the easy synthesis process and high yields.",

        "abstract": "The development of effective catalysts for the catalytic conversion of the harmful nitrophenol (NP) into the useful aminophenol (AP) has received extensive interest. Herein, we report the easy and large-scale synthesis of strongly coupled Ag/TiO2 heterojunctions based on the coordinated action of organic components with a multi-kind metal precursor. The heterojunctions were effective and stable catalysts for the photothermal catalytic reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP. In the synthesis, critic acid, ethylene glycol, AgNO3, and tetrabutyl titanate were dissolved and coordinated in water. Under heating, a precursor gel having a uniform distribution of Ag and Ti was gradually formed. Via calcination in air, the Ti precursor was transformed into TiO2, accompanied by the reduction of Ag+ to Ag nanoparticles. The formation of Ag/TiO2 composites with intimate interface contact benefited from the uniform distribution of different components in the precursor gel. The Ag/TiO2 functioned as an effective catalyst for the reduction of 4-NP, exhibiting higher activity than the many reported Ag-based catalysts. The catalytic reaction over Ag/TiO2 had a small t 0 with good activity and reuse performance. After 10 cycles of reuse, the conversion efficiency exhibited no obvious change. Importantly, the conversion of 4-NP was significantly enhanced under light irradiation provided by a 150-W Xe lamp (the visible light from cutoff have equal function), but ultraviolet light did not promote the conversion. The conversion time was reduced from 620 to 270 s with light irradiation (15 \u00b0C). The reaction rate under light irradiation (0.014 s\u22121) was approximately three times higher than that in the dark at 15 \u00b0C (0.0044 s\u22121) and even better than that in the dark at 25 \u00b0C (0.01 s\u22121). A series of experiments indicated that the light irradiation promoted the conversion of 4-NP because of the localized surface plasmon resonance effect of Ag, which generated hot e\u2212 and h+ particles and local heating around the particles via their absorption of the light.",

        "abstract": "The hydrogen evolution in neutral medium can avoid the problems caused by strong acids (bases) medium, thus is promising for practical application. The suitable catalyst in neutral medium for HER requires good conductivity for decreasing Ohm resistance, porous structure for weakening diffusion resistance, and plentiful active sites, but its synthesis remains a challenge. Here, the 2D MoP/MoS2 heterostructure nanosheets rather than common anion doping supported on carbon cloth (CC) was designed to meet above criteria. The catalyst only need a low overpotential of 96 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2 (\u03b710) for HER in neutral medium (without iR correction), which is much lower than 199 mV of the bare MoS2. The good performance is ascribed to plentiful active sites on heterointerface of MoP/MoS2 for activating H2O, good conductivity of MoP and CC for electron transfer, and pores surrounded by MoP/MoS2 facilitating mass-transfer as shown by XPS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The catalyst also exhibits outstanding activity in alkaline (\u03b710 of 54 mV) and acid (\u03b710 of 69 mV) media. The cells by coupling MoP/MoS2 cathode with a NiFe-LDH anode can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at 1.51 V in 1M KOH and 1.98 V in 1M PBS. The effective overall water splitting can be driven by a solar panel (1.51 V), implying its ability to storage solar energy as H2 energy.",

        "abstract": "Developing the efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for overall water splitting is of the great importance for the production of H2. The popular bi-functional catalysts usually shown good activity for one half reaction at expense of the activity for another half-reaction, thus given a moderate performance for overall water splitting. In this paper, we have reported on integrating the active OER (Ni3N) and HER (NiMoN) components as Ni3N-NiMoN heterostructures for the effective overall water splitting. The heterostructures were constructed by the controllable nitridation of the Ni-Mo-O precursor anchored on carbon cloth (CC) under NH3 atmosphere. The micro-structures of the catalyst could be tuned by regulating the surface properties of CC and the calcination temperature. Under optimized condition, the Ni3N-NiMoN catalysts exhibited good catalytic activity for both OER and HER in alkaline electrolyte. The catalysts can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 at an overpotential of 31 mV for HER, being close to Pt catalyst. Also, it only requiring an overpotential of 277 mV to reach current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 for OER. Moreover, the cell assembled by the identical Ni3N-NiMoN as both the cathode and anode needs only a cell voltage of 1.54 V to achieve current density of 10 mA cm\u22122. The superior performance of Ni3N-NiMoN heterostructures can be ascribed to the following points: 1) the simultaneous presence of active OER and HER components and the promoted action each other in the heterostructures, and 2) the exposure of the abundant active sites in the sheet-like structure assembled by the nanoparticles.",

A novel PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor, YY-20394, was developed with specific selectivity against PI3K\u03b4 and inhibited PI3K\u03b4 expressing human tumor cells growth both in vitro and in vivo. YY-20394 was then tested in orthotopic murine breast carcinoma 4T1 model in BALB/c mice. Despite mild killing against 4T1 tumor cells in vitro with an IC50 of around 28 \u03bcM, YY-20394 significantly inhibited 4T1 primary tumor growth as well as lung metastasis with dose dependency. It also extended the overall survival of 4T1 tumor bearing animals both in resection and non-resection settings. The inhibition of primary tumor growth and metastasis were attenuated in BALB/c nude mice, indicating T cells played an important role in YY-203949s anti-tumor/anti-metastasis efficacy. YY-20394 displayed significant anti-tumor efficacy in other syngeneic mouse tumor models tested including mouse colorectal cancer models MC-38 model in C57BL/c mice and CT26 model in BALB/c mice. More importantly, YY-20394 synergistically enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD-L1 antibody in CT26 model with 100% of the animals survived during a 60 day experimental period. YY-20394 is well tolerated by the animals with no treatment-related toxicity observed in these efficacy studies. These data suggest the YY-20394, a novel PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor, represents a promising and safe immune modulator and shows great potential in combining with immune check point inhibitors in cancer therapies.

A novel PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor, YY-20394, was developed with specific selectivity against PI3K\u03b4 and inhibited PI3K\u03b4 expressing human tumor cells growth both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, our previous data have shown YY-20394 significantly inhibited primary tumor growth in immune-competent mice with 4T1 and CT26 tumors, as well as 4T1 lung metastasis with dose dependency. The anti-tumor efficacy of YY-20394 was largely mediated by T cells. More importantly, YY-20394 synergistically enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD-L1 antibody in CT26 model and achieved long-term immune memory which is specific for CT26 tumors, but not for unrelated A20 tumors. In vitro mechanistic studies showed YY-20394 significantly inhibited T cell differentiation into Treg both in mouse splenocyte and in human primary CD4+ T cells, and was especially potent inhibiting their IL-10 secretion in vitro. Analyses of tumors treated with YY-20394 reviewed that YY-20394 decreased the percentage of Treg in the tumor infiltrating leukocytes, as well as IL-10 secretion. It also showed some effects on the myeloid populations in the tumors.

        "abstract": "Depleted uranium (DU) mainly accumulates in the bone over the long term. Osteoblast cells are responsible for the formation of bone, and they are sensitive to DU damage. However, studies investigating methods of reducing DU damage in osteoblasts are rarely reported. Ghrelin is a stomach hormone that stimulates growth hormones released from the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, and it is believed to play an important physiological role in bone metabolism. This study evaluates the impact of ghrelin on DU-induced apoptosis of the osteoblast MC3T3-E1 and investigates its underlying mechanisms. The results show that ghrelin relieved the intracellular oxidative stress induced by DU, eliminated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced lipid peroxidation by increasing intracellular GSH levels; in addition, ghrelin effectively suppressed apoptosis, enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential, and inhibited cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation after DU exposure. Moreover, ghrelin significantly reduced the expression of DU-induced phosphorylated p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). A specific inhibitor (SB203580) or specific siRNA of p38-MAPK could significantly suppress DU-induced apoptosis and related signals, whereas ROS production was not affected. In addition, ghrelin receptor inhibition could reduce the anti-apoptosis effect of ghrelin on DU and reverse the effect of ghrelin on intracellular ROS and p38-MAPK after DU exposure. These results suggest that ghrelin can suppress DU-induced apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 cells, reduce DU-induced oxidative stress by interacting with its receptor, and inhibit downstream p38-MAPK activation, thereby suppressing the mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis pathway.",

This study was designed to explore the radioprotective effect of T3, and if so, its potential mechanisms.Materials and methods: KunMing mice were exposed to various doses of \u03b3 irradiation (60 Co) after being treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or T3. Briefly, survival rate, dose reducing factor (DRF), body weight change (%), spleen index (SI) and thymus index (TI) of irradiated mice with or without different doses of T3 treatment were evaluated routinely. The hematopoietic function of bone marrow was emphatically investigated. In vitro experiments were performed to observe the protective effect of T3 on irradiated human lymphocyte AHH-1 cells by cell viability or flow cytometry (FCM) assays.Results: A single dose of subcutaneous administration of T3 significantly improved the survival rate, and enhanced the restoration of hematopoietic function in irradiated mice. T3 also de...",

        "abstract": "Roads and Bridges (R-B) form the basis for transformation and communication, and constitute the most critical part in the national economic development drive. The population dispersion in Benin, with high density living in metropolitans, calls for continuing development and improvement on R-B under the current national government policies and strategic plans. As R-B infrastructure objects are complex engineering facilities, and their construction and maintenance require much special scientific knowledge, the sustainability development objective becomes a crucial issue. This paper discusses the initial findings results of a two-round interviews with a group of practitioners in Beninese R-B development, which were aimed at identifying existing perceptions on sustainability and the agreeable priority issues between stakeholders focusing on the development of R-B. By extensive literature study and consultation with the stakeholders, influencing factors and key sustainability challenges specific to R-B development has been identified and classified into five categories namely engineering, managerial, human development, political and cultural, and sustainability. Based on these findings, this study introduces an on-going research project aimed at integrating the different perceptions and priority needs of the stakeholders, and issues that impact on the gap between sustainability development foci and its actual realization at R-B project construction. The exploration is of benefit to develop an innovative conceptual model to overcome the main factors. Through adopting and implementing the strategies and action plan of the conceptual model, the study presents a practical and innovative solution to improve Beninese capacity towards overcoming the problems. Finally, the study summaries the research conclusions and recommendations necessary to facilitate the development of the present R-B tempo in Benin.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The blind-hole method is widely applied in measuring the residual stress of metal component surfaces. In this paper, the Monte Carlo method is used to analyze the uncertainty of strain release coefficients which are influenced by the unreasonable assumptions made in the process of residual stress measurement. Based on a theoretical formula, MATLAB programs were designed to evaluate the error dispersion of the strain release coefficients for the blind-hole method. Compared with the values calibrated by test, it is shown that the uncertainty of the strain release coefficients can be evaluated reasonably by the use of the Monte Carlo method. In addition, the values predicted by the Monte Carlo method are more meaningful and suited to practical application.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Welding residual stress measurements were performed on 16-, 40-, 60-, 80-, and 100-mm-thick, welded Q345qD steel plates. The through-thickness stresses are almost uniformly distributed in the thin specimen (16\u00a0mm). In 40-mm-thick specimen, the stresses exhibit slight fluctuations as function of thickness. The through-thickness longitudinal and transverse stresses generally exhibit C-shaped distributions in thicker specimens (60, 80 and 100\u00a0mm), while longitudinal stresses exhibit \u03a3-shaped distributions in these specimens at the weld centerline. High longitudinal stress (\u2265250\u00a0MPa) regions occur predominantly at the surfaces and centers of the cross-sections, while high transverse stress regions occur predominantly in the surface layers. The longitudinal stress is almost always tensile at the mid-thickness regions of the welds, while the transverse stress is compressive. The longitudinal and transverse stresses distributions generally range from \u2212250 to 550\u00a0MPa. Commonly used empirical equations for residual stresses distribution were modified to expand their range of application based on the data obtained in present work.",

Emphasis was given on the effect of different parameters, such as composite type, initial Ibuprofen concentration (5-25\u202fmg/L), temperature (22-28\u202f\u00b0C) and pH (acidic and alkaline solution). The experiment was carried out in a self-made tubular flow reactor, with one 15\u202fW monochromatic UV lamp (254\u202fnm). The composite AC90T10 gives the highest removal degree of 92% of Ibuprofen solution under UV light within 4\u202fh, due to synergy of adsorption and photodegradation. It was found that weight ratio of composite/Ibuprofen has limited effect on the removal degree within the concentration range (5-25\u202fmg/L), but reaction time under UV light (4\u202fh) and pH (acidic solution) are very important. The kinetic experimental data obtained at pH 4.3\u202fat 25\u202f\u00b0C on different composites were fitted to pseudo-first, pseudo-second and Elovich models, obtaining a high accuracy based on R values. From the results, composites of granular activated carbon and TiO can enhance removal of Ibuprofen effectively, making recycle process much easier and less costly, which can be a promising method in future water treatment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The effects of different atmospheres on the distribution of organic and inorganic sulphur compounds during high-pyrite coal pyrolysis were investigated. Sulphur compound releases were determined by atmospheric pressure-temperature programmed reduction (AP-TPR) \u201con-line\u201d coupled with MS and AP-TPR \u201coff-line\u201d coupled with TD-GC/MS, which is a reliable technique for coal sulphur characterization. The results show that the decomposition of both organic and inorganic sulphur is different in the three applied atmospheres: H 2 , N 2  and CO 2 . In H 2 , most sulphur from LZ coal is hydrogenated/reduced to H 2 S, decomposition of inorganic sulphur (pyrite and sulphates) has a great effect on the formation of H 2 S. It not only enhances the intensity of its  m / z  34 signal but also shifts the peak maximum of its profile to a higher temperature, even without a returning to the base line. In inert N 2  gas, as expected, hydrogenation of some sulphur compounds such as less-reactive di-aryl sulphur species and simple thiophenic structures are highly limited. The dominant peak of  m / z  34 can also be related to the reduction of pyrite. In CO 2 , coal sulphur is mainly converted into SO 2 /SO, because CO 2  is a more reactive gas and rather acts as an oxidizing agent. Decomposition of organic sulphonic acids occurs before 500\u00a0\u00b0C and of sulphonics/sulphoxides after 500\u00a0\u00b0C. The decomposition of sulphates and pyrite is better detectable in CO 2  than in inert gas atmosphere. After 800\u00a0\u00b0C char gasification in CO 2  results in further decomposition of sulphur compounds and lower sulphur retention.",

        "abstract": "AimThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between pit and fissure sealants and the prevention of dental caries in permanent molars of children in China.MethodsThe Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions was followed. Articles published in English and Chinese from 2002 to 2013 were selected. All these studies were randomized clinical trials related to pit and fissure sealants on caries prevention. Data were analyzed using Software Review Manager 5.1.ResultsA search of the four largest Chinese medical literature databases and the PubMed/Medline database yielded a total of 397 clinical research studies about the effects of pit and fissure sealants on the prevention of dental caries; 20 original research studies were selected. In this meta-analysis, a total of 12\u00a0187 participants were included. Statistical analyses demonstrated a significant association between pit and fissure sealants and dental caries prevention for a 6-month follow-up period (combined odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.06, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.32, P\u00a0u003c\u00a00.0001). For other follow ups, there was a trend in pit and fissure sealants preventing the occurrence of dental caries.ConclusionCurrent clinical evidence suggests that pit and fissure sealants are effective for dental caries prevention. Sealants should be placed as part of an overall caries prevention approach. Further research with larger sample sizes and rigorously-designed clinical trials are required to corroborate the current results.",

        "abstract": "Introduction. Impaired wound-healing in diabetics can lead to life-threatening complications, such as limb amputation, associated in part with excessive matrix metalloproteinase- (MMP-) mediated degradation of collagen and other matrix constituents. In the current study, a novel triketonic chemically modified curcumin, CMC2.24, was tested for efficacy in healing of standardized skin wounds in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Initially, CMC2.24 was daily applied topically at 1% or 3% concentrations or administered systemically (oral intubation; 30\u2009mg/kg); controls received vehicle treatment only. Over 7 days, the diabetics exhibited impaired wound closure, assessed by gross and histologic measurements, compared to the nondiabetic controls. All drug treatments significantly improved wound closure with efficacy ratings as follows: 1% 2.24 > systemic 2.24 > 3% 2.24 with no effect on the severe hyperglycemia. In subsequent experiments, 1% CMC2.24 \"normalized\" wound-healing in the diabetics, whereas 1% curcumin was no more effective than 0.25% CMC2.24, and the latter remained 34% worse than normal. MMP-8 was increased 10-fold in the diabetic wounds and topically applied 1% (but not 0.25%) CMC2.24 significantly reduced this excessive collagenase-2; MMP-13/collagenase-3 did not show significant changes. Additional studies indicated efficacy of 1% CMC2.24 over more prolonged periods of time up to 30 days. ",

        "abstract": "Chronic inflammatory diseases such as periodontitis have been associated with increased risk for various medical conditions including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), derived from gram-negative periodonto-pathogens, can induce the local accumulation of mononuclear cells in the inflammatory lesion, increasing proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This ultimately results in the destruction of periodontal connective tissues including alveolar bone. Curcumin is the principal dyestuff in the popular Indian spice turmeric and has significant regulatory effects on inflammatory mediators but is characterized by poor solubility and low bioactivity. Recently, we developed a series of chemically modified curcumins (CMCs) with increased solubility and zinc-binding activity, while retaining, or further enhancing, their therapeutic effects. In the current study, we demonstrate that a novel CMC (CMC 2.5: 4-methoxycarbonyl curcumin) has significant inhibitory effects, better than the parent compound curcumin, on proinflammatory cytokines and MMPs in in vitro, in cell culture, and in an animal model of periodontal inflammation. The therapeutic potential of CMC 2.5 and its congeners may help to prevent tissue damage during various chronic inflammatory diseases including periodontitis and may reduce the risks of systemic diseases associated with this local disorder.",

P53 Arg72Pro or codon 72 polymorphism has been indicated to increase the risk of developing certain cancers such as bladder cancer and cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been shown as a risk factor for certain cancers such as cervical cancer and oral cancer as well, and the HPV oncoprotein E6 may induce the degradation of p53 function. However, the association between p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and the risk of oral cancer with HPV infection remains inconclusive. Therefore, this meta-analysis involving 5,614 participants was performed to investigate the relations among the p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism, HPV infection, and the risk of developing oral cancer.",

The whole exome (WES), whole genome (WGS) and target region (TS) sequencings and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing techniques were integrated to explore and validate novel targeting candidates from LUSC primary tumors and corresponding patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Seven genes (FGFR2, GRM1,PIK3CG, PIK3CA,ZFHX4, CSMD3, GRM8) with high frequencies of both single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs), and two genes (CLDN1 and RIT1) only with CNVs were identified by bioinformatics analysis. The functions of these candidates were validated through CRISPR-Cas9 system in primary PDX cells. Furthermore, we focused on the genetic and functional analysis of Metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 (GRM8), whose transcriptional activation was elucidated to promote the survival of LUSC tumor cell through inhibiting cAMP pathway and activating MAPK pathway. The SNV identified in GRM8, A112G, activated downstream signaling pathway and induced cell proliferation, which could be reversed by cAMP stimulator and MEK inhibitor. In conclusion, the components of GRM8 signaling pathway could serve as potential targets of squamous cell lung cancer carrying GRM8 activating variants.",

        "abstract": "Microalgal Chlorella has been demonstrated to process wastewater efficiently from piggery industry, yet optimization through genetic engineering of such a bio-treatment is currently challenging, largely due to the limited data and knowledge in genomics. In this study, we first investigated the differential growth rates among three wastewater-processing Chlorella strains: Chlorella sorokiniana BD09, Chlorella sorokiniana BD08 and Chlorella sp. Dachan, and the previously published Chlorella sorokiniana UTEX 1602, showing us that BD09 maintains the best tolerance in synthetic wastewater. We then performed genome sequencing and analysis, resulting in a high-quality assembly for each genome with scaffold N50\u2009>\u20092\u2009Mb and genomic completeness \u226591%, as well as genome annotation with 9,668, 10,240, 9,821 high-confidence gene models predicted for BD09, BD08, and Dachan, respectively. Comparative genomics study unravels that metabolic pathways, which are involved in nitrogen and phosphorus assimilation, were enriched in the faster-growing strains. We found that gene structural variation and genomic rearrangement might contribute to differential capabilities in wastewater tolerance among the strains, as indicated by gene copy number variation, domain reshuffling of orthologs involved, as well as a ~1 Mb-length chromosomal inversion we observed in BD08 and Dachan. In addition, we speculated that an associated bacterium, Microbacterium chocolatum, which was identified within Dachan, play a possible role in synergizing nutrient removal. Our three newly sequenced Chlorella genomes provide a fundamental foundation to understand the molecular basis of abiotic stress tolerance in wastewater treatment, which is essential for future genetic engineering and strain improvement.",

        "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE) has become the leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality in the world, which is characterized by a systemic maternal inflammatory response associated with endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and proteinuria. The development of PE is still barely predictable and thus challenging to prevent and manage clinically. Fasudil (FSD), the first-generation Rho/ROCK inhibitor, has been studied widely and applied in clinical practice with high safety and efficacy in treating hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. However, few studies have focused on the effect of fasudil on preeclampsia  and . Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of fasudil on hypoxia/reoxygenation injury  and its role on preeclamptic animal model. Here, we found that RhoA/ROCK pathway was significantly activated in H/R-challenged endothelial cells and in placenta and umbilical vessel of PE mice. And fasudil pre-treatment can protect vascular endothelial cells from H/R-induced apoptosis. In addition, inhibition of RhoA/ROCK pathway with fasudil can reduce the high blood pressure and urine protein levels as well as the concentration of s-Flt in peripheral and umbilical blood in a dose-dependent manner, thus resulting in prevention of the development of PE. Thus, Fasudil attenuates soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1)-induced hypertension in pregnant mice through RhoA/ROCK pathway, which would become a potential strategy for PE therapy.",

        "abstract": "Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between iron level and thyroid function during the first trimester of pregnancy in Eastern China. This was a hospital-based, cross-sectional observational study. A total of 1764 pregnant women were enrolled during their first trimester of gestation in Wuxi city. Serum ferritin (SF), hemoglobin (Hb), urinary iodine concentrations (UIC), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) were measured and evaluated in pregnant women. The median of TSH,FT4 and FT3 were 1.53mIU/L,10.43pmol/L and 4.50pmol/L respectively. The median UIC was 200\u03bcg/L and the median Hb was 126g/L. Of all the women, 1.76% of the subjects had iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) (SF<20\u03bcg/L and Hb<105g/L), and 39.06% of the population had iron deficiency (ID) (SF<15\u03bcg/L). Compared with SF>100\u03bcg/L group, the FT4 level was significantly lower in SF<20\u03bcg/L group (P=0.031) and in SF 20-100\u03bcg/L group (P=0.048). The TSH value of SF>20\u03bcg/L group was significantly higher than that in SF 20-100\u03bcg/L group (P=0.038) and SF>100\u03bcg/L group(P=0.034). There was an inverse linear relationship between TSH and FT4 after log transformation (r=0.245,P=0.000). Moreover, spearman's correlation analysis showed that UIC were correlated with SF and FT3 (all P<0.001) and iodine status more than adequate was associated with reduced serum ferritin concentration and FT3 levels. Thus, it is recommended that iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia shoud be evaluated and treated to combat thyroid dysfunction during the first trimester of pregnancy, Meanwhile, an increased attention should be paid on iodine nutritional status among this pregnant women simultaneous iron deficiency and thyroid dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "Background: During human pregnancy, Placental trophectoderm cells can release exosomes into maternal circulation. Trophoblast cells also give rise to cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and has been used for noninvasive prenatal screening for chromosomal aneuploidy. We intended to prove the existence of exosomal DNA (exoDNA) in the exosomes of maternal blood and compared exoDNA with plasma cfDNA in terms of genome distribution, fragment length, and the possibility of detecting genetic diseases. Methods: Maternal blood from 20 euploid pregnancies, 9 T21 pregnancies, 3 T18 pregnancies, 1 T13 pregnancy and 2 pregnancies with FGFR3 mutations were obtained. Exosomes enriched from maternal plasma were confirmed by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), western blotting and flow cytometry. ExoDNA was extracted and its fetal origin was confirmed by realtime fluorescence quantitative PCR(Q-PCR). Besides, exoDNA content was uncovered by Q-PCR. To characterize exoDNA and compare with cfDNA, pair-end whole genome sequencing was performed. Lastly, the fetal risk of genetic diseases was analyzed using the exoDNA sequencing data. Results: ExoDNA span on all 23 pairs of chromosomes and mitochondria, sharing a similar distribution pattern and higher GC content comparing with cfDNA. ExoDNA showed shorter fragments yet lower fetal fraction than cfDNA. ExoDNA could be used to determine fetal gender correctly, and all trisomies as well as de novo FGFR3 mutations. Conclusions: We proved that fetal exoDNA could be identified in the exosomes extracted from maternal plasma. ExoDNA shared some similar features to cfDNA and could potentially be used to detect genetic diseases in fetus.",

        "abstract": "Deficiency of IDs activity results in Hunter Syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type II), a fatal X-linked recessive disorder. We report characterization of 28 cosmids around the IDS locus in Xq28. Four overlapping cosmids have been sequenced in their entirety generating a 130-kb contig. These studies show the fine structure of the IDS gene and identify an IDS pseudogene-like structure located 20 kb distal to the active gene. Two novel genes have also been identified in this sequence, and one of these genes is also locally duplicated. Both homologs are expressed, and a number of alternative transcript products have been characterized. The presence of a highly conserved pseudogene-like structure within a larger duplicated region close to the IDS gene has significant implications for the study of mutations at this locus.",

        "abstract": ". \u00a0\u00a0We have previously investigated methods that image high-pressure processes such as combustion inside automobile cylinders\n and aircraft engines, or chemical phenomena in supercritical fluids. Here we show that vibrational Raman scattering can simply\n obtain, quantitatively, densities of some combustion-relevant molecules. We use narrow-band KrF excimer-laser light. Measurements\n for H2, N2, O2, CO2, and CH4 are in the pressure range from 1 to 60\u00a0bar, whereas those for C2H6 and C3H8 are up to their respective vapor pressures. All these species are at ambient temperature. Additional measurements are described\n for CO2 up to 96.8\u00a0bar and 318\u00a0K, where CO2 is a supercritical fluid. The O2 measurements are complicated by a photochemical formation of O3; those in supercritical CO2 by drastic bending of the laser beam within this medium. We show that, for each gas, the Raman signal is directly proportional\n to gas density, thereby making quantitative analysis particularly convenient. For each species, we present an estimate of its Raman cross-section relative to that of\n N2. However we recommend that future diagnostics users calibrate their own systems for relative species sensitivity.",

Regulation of these channels is critical. Here, we show that haem, a regulator of Na(+) transport, directly influences ENaC activity, decreasing channel-open probability (but not unitary conductance) in inside-out patches (but not outside-out). Conversely, exposure to the protein in the presence of NADPH and at normoxic O(2) tension (requirements for activity of hemeoxygenase) increases channel activity. CO, a product of hemeoxygenase activity, activated ENaC in a manner similar to that of haem plus NADPH. However, under hypoxic conditions, inhibition of ENaC by haem occurred even in the presence of NADPH. These data demonstrate a potent, O(2)-sensitive mechanism for regulation of ENaC, in which hemeoxygenase acts as the O(2) sensor, its substrate and product inhibiting and stimulating (respectively) the activity of ENaC.",

The double target amplification was successfully demonstrated with two beam irradiation for Ag, Nd, Yb, Hf, and Ta lasing. Moreover double-pass amplification at 7.9 nm has been demonstrated. The higher atomic number X-ray lasing strongly depends upon the transverse distance of the two targets",

        "abstract": "The so-called \u03c1\u03c0 puzzle of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) decays is examined using the experimental data available to date. Two different approaches were taken to estimate the ratio of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) hadronic decay rates. While one of the estimates could not yield the exact ratio of \u03c8(2S) to J/\u03c8 inclusive hadronic decay rates, the other, based on a computation of the inclusive ggg decay rate for \u03c8(2S)(J/\u03c8) by subtracting other decay rates from the total decay rate, differs by two standard deviations from the naive prediction of perturbative QCD, even though its central value is nearly twice as large as what was naively expected. A comparison between this ratio, upon making corrections for specific exclusive two-body decay modes, and the corresponding experimental data confirms the puzzles in J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) decays. We find from our analysis that the exclusively reconstructed hadronic decays of the \u03c8(2S) account for only a small fraction of its total decays, and a ratio exceeding the above estimate should be expected to occur for a considerable number of the remaining decay channels. We also show that the recent new results from the BES experiment provide crucial tests of various theoretical models proposed to explain the puzzle. \u00a9 2001 The American Physical Society.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is critically important for tumor cell survival, growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. One of the key events in the NF-kappaB signaling is the activation of inhibitor of NF-kappaB kinase (IKK) in response to stimuli of various cytokines. We have identified 17-acetoxyjolkinolide B (17-AJB) from a traditional Chinese medicinal herb Euphorbia fischeriana Steud as a novel small-molecule inhibitor of IKK. 17-AJB effectively inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation and induced apoptosis of tumor cells. 17-AJB had no effect on binding of tumor necrosis factor-alpha to its receptor or on binding of NF-kappaB to DNA. It inhibited NF-kappaB nuclear translocation. Detailed analysis revealed that the direct target of 17-AJB was IKK. 17-AJB kept IKK in its phosphorylated form irreversibly. This irreversible modification of IKK inactivated its kinase activity, leading to its failure to activate NF-kappaB. The effect of 17-AJB on IKK was specific. It had no effect on other kinases such as p38, p44/42, and JNK. In addition, 17-AJB induced apoptosis in tumor cells. The effects of 17-AJB on apoptosis correlated with inhibition of expression of the NF-kappaB-regulated genes. Taken together, our data suggest that 17-AJB is a novel type NF-kappaB pathway inhibitor. Its unique interaction mechanism with IKK may render it a strong apoptosis inducer of tumor cells and a novel type anticancer drug candidate.",

        "abstract": "Maduramicin, a polyether ionophore antibiotic derived from the bacterium Actinomadura yumaensis, is currently used as a feed additive against coccidiosis in poultry worldwide. It has been clinically observed that maduramicin can cause skeletal muscle and heart cell damage, resulting in skeletal muscle degeneration, heart failure, and even death in animals and humans, if improperly used. However, the mechanism of its toxic action in myoblasts is not well understood. Using mouse myoblasts (C2C12) and human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD and Rh30) cells as an experimental model for myoblasts, here we found that maduramicin inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. Further studies revealed that maduramicin induced accumulation of the cells at G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, and induced apoptosis in the cells. Concurrently, maduramicin downregulated protein expression of cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6), and CDC25A, and upregulated expression of the CDK inhibitors (p21Cip1 and p27Kip1), resulting in decreased phosphorylation of Rb. Maduramicin also induced expression of BAK, BAD, DR4, TRADD and TRAIL, leading to activation of caspases 8, 9 and 3 as well as cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Taken together, our results suggest that maduramicin executes its toxicity in myoblasts at least by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptotic cell death.",

        "abstract": "Vav1 is an hematopoietic-specific Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor coupling tyrosine kinase receptors and Rac GTPases, and has been implicated in transformation of fibroblasts and pancreas. To determine the biologic effect and oncogenic potential of Vav1 in hematopoietic lineages, we stably express oncogenic mutant of Vav1 in primary bone marrow cells using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Contrary to the growth stimulatory effects observed in fibroblasts, oncogenic Vav1 inhibits hematopoietic stem cell/progenitor engraftment in vivo and progenitor cell expansion in vitro via inducing apoptosis. The oncogenic Vav1-induced apoptosis is associated with reduced expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins and effectively suppressed by transgenic overexpression of Bcl-2, suggesting Vav1-mediated signaling via Bcl-2 in apoptosis. Also, oncogenic Vav1 stimulates sustained activation of Rac GTPases and the biologic effects of oncogenic Vav1 are Rac-dependent. Further, when expressed in the p53-deficient cells, which express elevated Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and are resistant to the apoptosis, oncogenic Vav1 enhances both proliferation and self-renewal of hematopoietic progenitor cells. These results demonstrate clear phenotypic differences between wild-type and p53(-/-) hematopoietic cells expressing oncogenic Vav1, and suggest oncogenic potential of Vav1-mediated pathways in primary hematopoietic cell when they collaborate with additional genetic hits that affect the p53 pathway.",

        "abstract": "Constitutive activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway occurs frequently in cancer cells and contributes to oncogenesis. Among the members of STAT family, STAT3 plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of human tumors. The STAT3-mediated signaling pathway has been recognized as a promising anticancer target. Here, we show that 17-Hydroxy-jolkinolide B (HJB), a diterpenoid from the Chinese medicinal herb Euphorbia fischeriana Steud, strongly inhibits interleukin (IL)-6-induced as well as constitutive STAT3 activation. Furthermore, we show that HJB directly targets the JAK family kinases, JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2, by inducing dimerization of the JAKs via cross-linking. Addition of DTT or glutathione prevents the JAK cross-linking and blocks the inhibitory effects of HJB on IL-6-induced STAT3 activation, suggesting that HJB may react with cystein residues of JAKs to form covalent bonds that inactivate JAKs. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that each HJB reacted with two thiols. The effect of HJB on the JAK/STAT3 pathway is specific as HJB has no effect on platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, or insulin-like growth factor I signaling pathways. Finally, we show that HJB inhibits growth and induces apoptosis of tumor cells, particularly those tumor cells with constitutively activated STAT3. We propose that the natural compound HJB is a promising anticancer drug candidate as a potent STAT3 signaling inhibitor.",

        "abstract": "Inhibition of tumour cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis by chemically modified tetracyclines has been ascribed to inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity.Exposure of the human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 or its MMP-9-overproducing transfected clone (E-10) to 6-demethyl, 6-deoxy, 4-de [dimethylamino]-tetracycline (CMT-3), a chemically modified non-antimicrobial tetracycline followed by analysis using gelatinase activity assay, zymography, degradation of radiolabelled extracellular matrix (ECM), Western blotting, TNF-alpha ELISA and cell viability assays.CMT-3 treatment results in diminution in extracellular MMP-9 protein levels as well as inhibition of gelatinase activity. This prevents cell-mediated ECM degradation without inducing general cytostasis or cytotoxicity. Culturing E-10 cells in 10 or 20 microM CMT-3 diminished secreted MMP-9 levels by 45% or 60%, respectively, but did not affect levels of most other secreted proteins, including tissue inhibitor of Metalloproteinases (TIMP-1). ECM degradation by E-10 cells or their conditioned medium was inhibited by approximately 20%-30% in the presence of 20 microM CMT-3, reflecting inhibition of MMP-9 activity in addition to diminution of released MMP-9 levels. TNF-alpha levels were also diminished in E-10 conditioned medium in the presence of CMT-3, but cell viability, measured by MTS reduction and cytosolic LDH retention, was unaffected.It is proposed that the reduction in ECM-degradative activity reflects diminished levels of expression as well as inhibition of enzymatic activity of MMPs released by cells in the presence of CMT-3. These multiple effects of CMT-3 may offer promise for use in suppressing tumour invasion, and if used in conjunction with other chemotherapy agents, may lead to more successful treatment of cancer.",

        "abstract": "Cyclic GMP has been proposed to regulate axonal development, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the formation of axon branches are not well understood. Here, we report the use of rodent embryonic sensory neurons from the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) to demonstrate the role of cGMP signaling in axon branching and to identify the downstream molecular pathway mediating this novel regulation. Pharmacologically, a specific cGMP analog promotes DRG axon branching in culture, and this activity can be achieved by activating the endogenous soluble guanylyl cyclase that produces cGMP. At the molecular level, the cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1 (PrkG1) mediates this activity, as DRG neurons isolated from the kinase-deficient mouse fail to respond to cGMP activation to make branches, whereas overexpression of a PrkG1 mutant with a higher-than-normal basal kinase activity is sufficient to induce branching. In addition, cGMP activation in DRG neurons leads to phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), a protein that normally suppresses branching. This interaction is direct, because PrkG1 binds GSK3 in heterologous cells and the purified kinase can phosphorylate GSK3 in vitro. More importantly, overexpression of a dominant active form of GSK3 suppresses cGMP-dependent branching in DRG neurons. Thus, our study establishes an intrinsic signaling cascade that links cGMP activation to GSK3 inhibition in controlling axon branching during sensory axon development.",

Interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 produced by antigen presenting cells are essential for inducing and sustaining Th1 effector cells via different pathways. However, less is known with regard to the levels of expression and synthesis of these two cytokines in patients with AA. This was determined in the current study in 26 patients with AA as well as in 20 healthy controls. Our results showed that IL-12 p40, IL-12 p35 and IL-23 p19 gene expression can be detected in all samples both from the patients and the controls, using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, an increased expression of IL-12 p40, IL-12 p35 and IL-23 p19 mRNA was observed in bone marrow mononuclear cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with AA compared with the corresponding one in normal controls. Higher levels of IL-12 and IL-23 were also found in BM plasma and PB plasma in patients with AA than in normal controls. Therefore, the augmented expression of IL-12 and IL-23 in patients with AA may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease.",

        "abstract": "Placenta-derived chymotrypsin-like protease (CLP/chymase) promotes endothelial P-selectin and E-selectin expression, which may be responsible for the increased neutrophil/endothelial interactions in preeclampsia (PE). However, little is known about this protease expression and production in human placenta. This study was undertaken to determine the distribution and gene expression of CLP in human placenta. Human placental tissues were obtained immediately after delivery from normal and PE pregnancies. We examined (1) CLP/chymase immunoactivity by immunohistochemical staining of villous tissue sections; (2) trophoblast mRNA and protein expression for chymase by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis; (3) chymase cDNA sequencing in isolated trophoblast cells (TCs); and (4) release of CLP by placental villous tissue cultured under 2% and 20% O(2). We found (1) CLP expression is mainly localized in the epithelial layer of syncytiotrophoblasts; (2) both mRNA and protein expression are significantly (p<0.05) upregulated in TCs isolated from PE vs. normal placentas; (3) TC chymase cDNA sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence are 100% identical to that reported for the human heart; and (4) villous tissue releases more chymotrypsin when cultured with 2% O(2). We conclude that (1) the DNA and protein sequence for chymase in placental trophoblast cells are the same as those reported in the human heart; (2) CLP/chymase expression is upregulated in TCs during PE; and (3) lowered oxygen condition promotes CLP release by placental TCs. Since chymase is a potent non-ACE angiotensin II producing enzyme, our data suggest that if placenta-derived CLP/chymase is released into the maternal circulation, it may contribute to the cardiovascular complications associated with PE.",

        "abstract": "By high-throughput screens of somatic mutations of genes in cancer genomes, hundreds of cancer genes are being rapidly identified, providing us abundant information for systematically deciphering the genetic changes underlying cancer mechanism. However, the functional collaboration of mutated genes is often neglected in current studies. Here, using four genome-wide somatic mutation data sets and pathways defined in various databases, we showed that gene pairs significantly comutated in cancer samples tend to distribute between pathways rather than within pathways. At the basic functional level of motifs in the human protein-protein interaction network, we also found that comutated gene pairs were overrepresented between motifs but extremely depleted within motifs. Specifically, we showed that based on Gene Ontology that describes gene functions at various specific levels, we could tackle the pathway definition problem to some degree and study the functional collaboration of gene mutations in cancer genomes more efficiently. Then, by defining pairs of pathways frequently linked by comutated gene pairs as the between-pathway models, we showed they are also likely to be codisrupted by mutations of the interpathway hubs of the coupled pathways, suggesting new hints for understanding the heterogeneous mechanisms of cancers. Finally, we showed some between-pathway models consisting of important pathways such as cell cycle checkpoint and cell proliferation were codisrupted in most cancer samples under this study, suggesting that their codisruptions might be functionally essential in inducing these cancers. All together, our results would provide a channel to detangle the complex collaboration of the molecular processes underlying cancer mechanism.",

One mechanism by which c-Met deregulation leads to cancer is through gain-of-function mutations. Therefore, small molecules capable of targeting these mutations could offer therapeutic benefits for affected patients. SU11274 was recently described and reported to inhibit the activity of the wild-type and some mutant forms of c-Met, whereas other mutants are resistant to inhibition. We identified a novel series of c-Met small molecule inhibitors that are active against multiple mutants previously identified in hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma patients. AM7 is active against wild-type c-Met as well as several mutants, inhibits c-Met-mediated signaling in MKN-45 and U-87 MG cells, and inhibits tumor growth in these two models grown as xenografts. The crystal structures of AM7 and SU11274 bound to unphosphorylated c-Met have been determined. The AM7 structure reveals a novel binding mode compared with other published c-Met inhibitors and SU11274. The molecule binds the kinase linker and then extends into a new hydrophobic binding site. This binding site is created by a significant movement of the C-helix and so represents an inactive conformation of the c-Met kinase. Thus, our results demonstrate that it is possible to identify and design inhibitors that will likely be active against mutants found in different cancers.",

The utility of this biomarker remains limited, largely due to the lack of quantitative information. The aims of this study were to quantify serum GP73 (sGP73) in healthy individuals and in patients with liver diseases, and to validate sGP73 as a biomarker for early diagnosis of liver disease.Recombinant GP73 was used to generate monoclonal (mAb) and polyclonal antibodies (pAb). Using these antibodies in a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, GP73 was measured in serum from 263 patients with various forms of liver and other diseases.The median sGP73 in patients with liver disease was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than in healthy individuals and in patients with other diseases. When sGP73 was used to detect liver disease, it had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 80% at the optimal cut-off value of 85.5 microg/L. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.9.sGP73 concentration in patients with liver disease was three-fold higher than in healthy individuals. However, sGP73 concentrations did not differ significantly between patients from each liver disease group. Furthermore, sGP73 was not significantly elevated in patients with diseases other than liver disease compared with healthy individuals. These results suggest that sGP73 may be used as a serum marker for the diagnosis of liver disease.",

        "abstract": "Salviae miltiorrhiza, a traditional Chinese medical herb known as \"Danshen,\" has been widely used in clinics to improve blood circulation, relieve blood stasis, and treat coronary heart disease. Depside salts from S. miltiorrhiza are a novel drug in which magnesium lithospermate B and its analogs are the active components. The pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, metabolism, and excretion of three of the major components, lithospermic acid B, rosmarinic acid (RA), and lithospermic acid (LA), were studied by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry following intravenous administration in Sprague-Dawley rats. The elimination half-lives for LSB, RA, and LA were 1.04, 0.75, and 2.0 h, respectively, when 60 mg/kg S. miltiorrhiza depside salts were administrated. The areas under the curve for LSB, RA, and LA were 51.6, 6.6, and 25.2 mg . h/l, respectively, and the values decreased in the individual tissues in the following order: kidney > lung > liver > heart > spleen > brain for LSB; kidney > lung > heart > liver > spleen > brain for RA; and heart > lung > kidney > liver > spleen > brain for LA. After intravenous administration of 60 mg/kg S. miltiorrhiza depside salts, 86% of the LSB was excreted in the bile within 6 h. The main metabolites M1 and M2 were found in the serum. Overall, the results show that depside salts from S. miltiorrhiza are rapidly and widely distributed to tissues after intravenous administration in rats but that they are also rapidly cleared and excreted.",

        "abstract": "Hypersensitivity to angiotensin II contributes to the increased vasoconstriction in preeclampsia. In this study, we determined whether placenta-derived factors could affect endothelial cell angiotensin II generation.Our results showed that more angiotensin II was produced by endothelial cells treated with preeclampsia placental conditioned medium than the cells treated with normal conditioned medium or untreated controls. To determine which pathway, angiotensin-converting enzyme or nonangiotensin-converting enzyme angiotensin-generating enzyme/chymase, might be involved in preeclampsia conditioned medium induced angiotensin II generation, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and chymotrypsin inhibitors were applied to the cell culture either separately or in combination. We found that chymotrypsin inhibitor, but not captopril, could attenuate the increased angiotensin II generation. To further test specific effects of the protease on endothelial cell angiotensin II generation, endothelial cells were grown in cell culture inserts and chymotrypsin was added to the upper chamber of the cell culture (apical exposure). The medium in the lower chamber (basal direction) was collected and measured for angiotensin II. Our results showed that apical exposure of endothelial cells to the protease resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in basal release of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II receptor-1 expression was also upregulated in cells treated with preeclampsia conditioned medium or chymotrypsin. This data suggest that placenta-derived factors may activate chymase-angiotensin pathway in endothelial cells. Moreover, increased endothelial cell basal release of angiotensin II in response to the protease stimulation further suggests that angiotensin II levels in the circulation may not necessarily reflect angiotensin II generation within the vascular wall.",

        "abstract": "Defect in apoptotic signaling and up-regulation of drug transporters in cancer cells significantly limits the effectiveness of cancer chemotherapy. We propose that an agent inducing non-apoptotic cell death may overcome cancer drug resistance and showed that shikonin, a naturally occurring naphthoquinone, induced a cell death in MCF-7 and HEK293 distinct from apoptosis and characterized with (a) a morphology of necrotic cell death; (b) loss of plasma membrane integrity; (c) loss of mitochondrial membrane potentials; (d) activation of autophagy as a downstream consequence of cell death, but not a contributing factor; (e) elevation of reactive oxygen species with no critical roles contributing to cell death; and (f) that the cell death was prevented by a small molecule, necrostatin-1, that specifically prevents cells from necroptosis. The characteristics fully comply with those of necroptosis, a basic cell-death pathway recently identified by Degterev et al. with potential relevance to human pathology. Furthermore, we proved that shikonin showed a similar potency toward drug-sensitive cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and HEK293) and their drug-resistant lines overexpressing P-glycoprotein, Bcl-2, or Bcl-x(L), which account for most of the clinical cancer drug resistance. To our best knowledge, this is the first report to document the induction of necroptosis by a small molecular compound to circumvent cancer drug resistance.",

Histone acetyltransferases and class I and class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) cause posttranscriptional modification of histone proteins that participate in ERalpha signaling. Here, we report that human SIRT1, a class III HDAC, regulates ERalpha expression. Inhibition of SIRT1 activity by sirtinol suppresses ERalpha expression through disruption of basal transcriptional complexes at the ERalpha promoter. This effect leads to inhibition of estrogen-responsive gene expression. Our in vitro observations were further extended that SIRT1 knockout reduces ERalpha protein in mouse mammary gland. Finally, ERalpha-mediated estrogen response genes are also decreased in mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from SIRT1-knockout mice. These results suggest that inhibition of SIRT1 deacetylase activity by either pharmacological inhibitors or genetic depletion impairs ERalpha-mediated signaling pathways.",

To investigate the function of Nesprin 1 in vivo, we generated a mouse model in which all isoforms of Nesprin 1 containing the C-terminal spectrin-repeat region with or without KASH domain were ablated. Nesprin 1 knockout mice are marked by decreased survival rates, growth retardation and increased variability in body weight. Additionally, nuclear positioning and anchorage are dysfunctional in skeletal muscle from knockout mice. Physiological testing demonstrated no significant reduction in stress production in Nesprin 1-deficient skeletal muscle in either neonatal or adult mice, but a significantly lower exercise capacity in knockout mice. Nuclear deformation testing revealed ineffective strain transmission to nuclei in muscle fibers lacking Nesprin 1. Overall, our data show that Nesprin 1 is essential for normal positioning and anchorage of nuclei in skeletal muscle.",

This was supported by immunoelectron microscopy. Nestin also colocalized with vimentin in the periphery of capillary loops but not in the mesangium. Nestin was not detected in other structures of the adult human kidney. To determine the potential role of nestin in proteinuria, nestin was examined in kidney biopsies from patients with or without proteinuria. These patients were diagnosed with IgA nephropathy with mild mesangial expansion but without proteinuria, IgA nephropathy with proteinuria, membranous nephropathy (MN), and focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS). The distribution of nestin in these biopsies was similar to that in the normal kidney. Semiquantitative analysis of immunostaining showed that glomerular nestin expression in IgA nephropathy without proteinuria was not different from normal kidney; however, nestin expression in kidneys of patients with IgA nephropathy and proteinuria, or MN and FSGS with proteinuria was significantly reduced compared with normal kidney (P < 0.01). Reduced nestin mRNA expression in the patients with IgA nephropathy with proteinuria and FSGN was also observed by quantitative real-time PCR. These studies suggest that nestin may play an important role in maintaining normal podocyte function in the human kidney.",

        "abstract": "Aberrantly expressed microRNA (miRNA) is frequently associated with a variety of cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In this study, we investigated the expression and possible role of miR-217 in PDAC. Data obtained by locked nucleic acid in situ hybridization and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that miR-217 was downregulated in 76.2% (16/21) of PDAC tissues and in all tested PDAC cell lines when compared with the corresponding normal pancreatic tissue. Overexpression of miR-217 in PDAC cells inhibited tumor cell growth and anchorage-independent colony formation and miR-217 decreased tumor cell growth in nude mouse xenografts in vivo. Using in silico predictions, KRAS was defined as a potential direct target of miR-217. Data from the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay showed that KRAS was a direct target of miR-217. Upregulation of miR-217 could decrease KRAS protein levels and reduce the constitutive phosphorylation of downstream AKT. Downregulation of miR-217 expression in PDAC cells could increase cell anchorage-independent colony formation and KRAS protein levels. Furthermore, miR-217 expression was observed to be negatively correlated with KRAS protein expression in PDAC cell lines. We conclude that the frequently downregulated miR-217 can regulate KRAS and function as a tumor suppressor in PDAC. Therefore, miR-217 may serve as a useful therapeutic agent for miRNA-based PDAC therapy.",

        "abstract": "Syncoilin is a striated muscle-specific intermediate filament-like protein, which is part of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC) at the sarcolemma and provides a link between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton through its interaction with alpha-dystrobrevin and desmin. Its upregulation in various neuromuscular diseases suggests that syncoilin may play a role in human myopathies. To study the functional role of syncoilin in cardiac and skeletal muscle in vivo, we generated syncoilin-deficient (syncoilin-/-) mice. Our detailed analysis of these mice up to 2 yr of age revealed that syncoilin is entirely dispensable for cardiac and skeletal muscle development and maintenance of cellular structure but is required for efficient lateral force transmission during skeletal muscle contraction. Notably, syncoilin-/- skeletal muscle generates less maximal isometric stress than wild-type (WT) muscle but is as equally susceptible to eccentric contraction-induced injury as WT muscle. This suggests that syncoilin may play a supportive role for desmin in the efficient coupling of mechanical stress between the myofibril and fiber exterior. It is possible that the reduction in isometric stress production may predispose the syncoilin skeletal muscle to a dystrophic condition.",

A total of 49 sequence types (STs) were identified from the entire panel of 93 C. jejuni isolates. Fifty-six isolates belonged to 14 clonal complexes, while 37 isolates could not be assigned to any known clonal complex. The most frequently observed clonal complexes were ST-21 (11 isolates), ST-353 (10 isolates) and ST-443 (6 isolates). Fifty-three PFGE SmaI patterns were identified among 93 isolates. No erythromycin-, gentamicin- or streptomycin-resistant isolates were found among the 44 strains isolated in 2008. Resistance to nalidixic acid, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was observed in 100\u200a% (44/44) of the tested isolates. This study has shown the genetic characteristics of C. jejuni isolates in north China. In addition, overlapping clonal groups were defined by both MLST and PFGE for C. jejuni human and chicken isolates.",

In a tumour setting, NK T cells activated by \u03b1-galactosylceramide (\u03b1-GalCer) execute anti-tumour activity by secreting cytokines. By contrast, T regs intrinsically suppress antigen-specific immune responses and are often found to be elevated in tumour patients. In this study, we have shown that T regs regulate NK T cell function negatively in vitro, suggesting a direct interaction between these cell types. In a murine mammary tumour model, we demonstrated that administration of either \u03b1-GalCer or anti-CD25 antibody alone markedly suppressed tumour formation and pulmonary metastasis, and resulted in an increase in the survival rate up to 44% (from a baseline of 0%). When treatments were combined, depletion of T regs boosted the anti-tumour effect of \u03b1-GalCer, and the survival rate jumped to 85%. Our results imply a potential application of combining T reg cell depletion with \u03b1-GalCer to stimulate NK T cells for cancer therapy. \u00a9 2009 British Society for Immunology.",

        "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-23, a new member of the IL-12 family, plays a central role in the Th17 immune response and in autoimmune diseases. It is clear that activated macrophages and dendritic cells produce IL-23, but the molecular mechanisms whereby inflammatory signals stimulate IL-23 expression are not fully understood. We demonstrate that induction of IL-23 p19 gene expression by LPS depends on the TLR4 and MyD88 pathways. All three MAPK pathways (ERK, JNK, and p38) that are activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation were shown to exert a positive effect on p19 expression. We cloned a 1.3-kb putative p19 promoter and defined its transcription initiation sites by the 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends method. By analyzing IL-23 p19 promoter mutants, we have identified a promoter region (-413 to +10) that contains several important elements, including NF-kappaB and AP-1. In addition to NF-kappaB, we have demonstrated that the proximal AP-1 site is important for p19 promoter activation. Mutation of the AP-1 site resulted in the loss of p19 promoter activation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis showed that c-Jun and c-Fos bind to the AP-1 site, which was confirmed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Furthermore, co-transfection of c-Jun and ATF2 synergistically induced p19 promoter activation, and c-Jun and ATF2 formed a protein complex, demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Finally, LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages from IL-10-deficient mice expressed significantly higher IL-23 p19 than macrophages from wild type mice, and the addition of recombinant IL-10 strongly inhibited LPS-induced p19 expression. Thus, this study suggests that MyD88-dependent Toll-like receptor signaling induces IL-23 p19 gene expression through both MAPKs and NF-kappaB.",

        "abstract": "GlcNAcylation, a dynamic posttranslational modification, is involved in a wide range of biological processes and some human diseases. Although there is emerging evidence that some tumor-associated proteins are modified by GlcNAcylation, the role of GlcNAcylation in tumor progression remains unclear. Here, we show that GlcNAcylation enhances the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. The decrease of cell surface E-cadherin is the molecular mechanism underlying GlcNAcylation-induced breast cancer metastasis. p120 and beta-catenin, but not E-cadherin, are GlcNAcylated; the GlcNAcylation of p120 and beta-catenin might play roles in the decrease of cell surface E-cadherin. Moreover, immunohistochemistry analysis indicated that the global GlcNAcylation level in breast tumor tissues is elevated significantly as compared with that in the corresponding adjacent tissues; further, GlcNAcylation was significantly enhanced in metastatic lymph nodes compared with their corresponding primary tumor tissues. This is the first report to clearly elucidate the roles and mechanisms whereby GlcNAcylation influences the malignant properties of breast cancer cells. These results also suggest that GlcNAcylation might be a potential target for the diagnosis and therapy of breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Dauricine is the major bioactive component isolated from the roots of Menispermum dauricum D.C. and has shown promising pharmacological activities with a great potential for clinic use. However, the adverse effects and toxicity of the alkaloid are unfortunately ignored. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the toxicity of dauricine in vitro and in vivo. Mice (CD-1) were treated intraperitoneally with dauricine at various doses, and sera and lung lavage fluids were collected after 24 h of treatment. No changes in serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and blood urea nitrogen were noticed, whereas a dose-dependent increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity was observed in lung lavage fluids. Ethidium-based staining studies showed that remarkable cells lost membrane integrity in the lungs of the animals treated with dauricine at 150 mg/kg. Histopathological evaluation of lungs of mice showed that dauricine at the same dose caused significant alveolar edema and hemorrhage. Exposure to dauricine at 40 muM for 24 h resulted in up to 60% cell death in human lung cell lines BEAS-2B, WI-38, and A549. Ketoconazole showed protective effect on the pulmonary injury in mice given dauricine. A quinone methide metabolite of dauricine was identified in mouse lung microsomal incubations, and the presence of ketoconazole in the microsomal incubations suppressed the formation of the quinone methide metabolite. In conclusion, dauricine produced pulmonary injury in CD-1 mice. The pulmonary toxicity appears to depend on the metabolism of dauricine mediated by CYP3A. The electrophilic quinone methide metabolite probably plays an important role in the pulmonary toxicity induced by dauricine.",

        "abstract": "The aims of this study are to investigate the cytokine, chemokine and adhesion molecule profiles in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus with central nervous system infection. Experimental sets were established which included 108 patients and 132 cerebrospinal fluid samples. The patients were grouped as neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 54), systemic lupus erythematosus with central nervous system infection (n = 16), systemic lupus erythematosus controls (n=20), and non-inflammatory neurological disease (n=18). The dynamic changes of 21 patients in the neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus group before and after induction therapy were further analyzed. IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, TNFalpha, IFN gamma, IP-10, MCP-1, RANTES, VCAM-1, and P-selectin were measured in cerebrospinal fluid samples by using a fluorescent bead-based assay. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of IL-8, MCP-1, P-selectin and VCAM-1 were significantly increased in neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus compared with systemic lupus erythematosus controls. IL-6, IL-17, IL-8 and VCAM-1 were higher in systemic lupus erythematosus with central nervous system infection than in systemic lupus erythematosus controls. Among systemic lupus erythematosus with central nervous system infection, the IL-6, IL-17, IL-8 and IP-10 levels were higher than those in neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus. After sufficient induction therapy, IL-8, MCP-1, P-selectin, VCAM-1 and IL-6 in patients with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus decreased significantly. Levels of all molecules tested in non-inflammatory central nervous system disease were not different from those of systemic lupus erythematosus controls. From our data, the intrathecal cytokine/chemokine profile is different among patients with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic lupus erythematosus complicated with central nervous system infection and systemic lupus erythematosus controls. IL-8, MCP-1, VCAM-1, P-selectin and IL-6 in cerebrospinal fluid are effective parameters to monitor neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity and response to treatment. Significantly elevated IL-17, IL-6, and to a lesser extent, IL-8, favors central nervous system infection in systemic lupus erythematosus.",

The shock wave was produced using the flyer plate impact and accelerated up to \u223c6\u2002km/s with a two-stage light gas gun. Gaseous specimens were shocked from two initial pressures of 0.80 and 4.72 MPa at room temperature. Time-resolved spectral radiation histories were recorded by using a multiwavelength channel pyrometer. The transient spectra with the wavelength range of 460-700 nm were recorded by using a spectrometer to evaluate the shock temperature. Shock velocity was measured and particle velocity was determined by the impedance matching methods. The equations of state of xenon plasma and ionization degree have been discussed in terms of the self-consistent fluid variational theory.",

        "abstract": "Agarases are generally classified into glycoside hydrolase families 16, 50, and 86 and are found to degrade agarose to frequently generate neoagarobiose, neoagarotetraose, or neoagarohexaose as the main products. In this study we have cloned a novel endo-type beta-agarase gene, agaB, from marine Pseudoalteromonas sp. CY24. The novel agarase encoded by agaB gene has no significant sequence similarity with any known proteins including all glycoside hydrolases. It degrades agarose to generate neoagarooctaose and neoagarodecaose as the main end products. Based on the analyses of enzymatic kinetics and degradation patterns of different oligosaccharides, the agarase AgaB appears to have a large substrate binding cleft that accommodates 12 sugar units, with 8 sugar units toward the reducing end spanning subsites +1 to +8 and 4 sugar units toward the non-reducing end spanning subsites -4 to -1, and enzymatic cleavage taking place between subsites -1 and +1. In addition, 1H NMR analysis shows that this enzyme hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond with inversion of anomeric configuration, in contrast to other known agarases that are retaining. Altogether, AgaB is structurally and functionally different from other known agarases and appears to represent a new family of glycoside hydrolase.",

To test the mechanism of honokiol-induced apoptosis, Western blotting was used to investigate the factors involved in this process. The pharmacokinetics study of honokiol was tested by high phase liquid chromatography. In in vivo study, Balb/c nude mice were incubated with RKO cells. Honokiol was injected intraperitoneally every other day into tumor bearing Balb/c nude mice.Our results showed that honokiol induced apoptosis of RKO cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. At 5-10 microg/mL for 48 h, honokiol induced apoptosis through activating Caspase cascades. Pharmacokinetics study demonstrated that, honokiol could be absorbed quickly by intraperitoneal injection, and maintained in plasma for more than 10 h. In nude mice bearing RKO-incubated tumor, honokiol displayed anticancer activity by inhibiting tumor growth and prolonging the lifespan of tumor bearing mice.With its few toxicity to normal cells and potent anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo, honokiol might be a potential chemotherapy candidate in treating human colorectal carcinoma.",

Compounds 2e, 2g, 3f, 3k, 3q and 3u exhibited consistent high anti-tumor activity for imatinib-resistant K562 leukemia cells.

In particular, these compounds displayed potent inhibition of the cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation of NF-kappaB p65 which plays a critical role in the survival of leukemia stem cells.

        "abstract": "Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been a remarkable success for the treatment of Ph(+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, a significant proportion of patients treated with TKIs develop resistance because of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and T315I mutant Bcr-Abl. Here we describe the unknown activity of the natural product berbamine that efficiently eradicates LSCs and T315I mutant Bcr-Abl clones. Unexpectedly, we identify CaMKII \u03b3 as a specific and critical target of berbamine for its antileukemia activity. Berbamine specifically binds to the ATP-binding pocket of CaMKII \u03b3, inhibits its phosphorylation and triggers apoptosis of leukemia cells. More importantly, CaMKII \u03b3 is highly activated in LSCs but not in normal hematopoietic stem cells and coactivates LSC-related \u03b2-catenin and Stat3 signaling networks. The identification of CaMKII \u03b3 as a specific target of berbamine and as a critical molecular switch regulating multiple LSC-related signaling pathways can explain the unique antileukemia activity of berbamine. These findings also suggest that berbamine may be the first ATP-competitive inhibitor of CaMKII \u03b3, and potentially, can serve as a new type of molecular targeted agent through inhibition of the CaMKII \u03b3 activity for treatment of leukemia.",

However, little is known about how these mRNAs are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Here, we report the identification of a RNA giant nuclear body (RNA-GNB) that is abundant in cancer cells but rare in normal cells. The RNA-GNB contains a RNA core surrounded by a protein shell. We identify 782 proteins from cancer-associated RNA-GNBs, 40% of which are involved in the nuclear mRNA trafficking. RNA-GNB is required for cell proliferation, and its abundance is positively associated with tumor burden and outcome of therapies. Our findings suggest that the RNA-GNB is a novel nuclear RNA trafficking organelle that may contribute to the nuclear mRNA exporting and proliferation of cancer cells.",

        "abstract": "Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) is one of the most commonly performed clinical bariatric surgeries used for the remission of obesity and diabetes. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which VSG exerts its beneficial effects remains elusive. We report that the membrane-bound G protein-coupled bile acid receptor, GPBAR-1 (also known as TGR5), is required to mediate the effects of anti-obesity, anti-hyperglycemia, and improvements of fatty liver of VSG in mice. In the absence of TGR5, the beneficial metabolic effects of VSG in mice are lost. Moreover, we found that the expression of TGR5 increased significantly after VSG, and VSG alters both BA levels and composition in mice, resulting in enhancement of TGR5 signaling in the ileum and brown adipose tissues, concomitant with improved glucose control and increased energy expenditure. Conclusion: Our study elucidates a novel underlying mechanism by which VSG achieves its postoperative therapeutic effects through enhanced TGR5 signaling. (Hepatology 2016;64:760-773)",

We show that the high-temperature PL is characterized by a free-to-acceptor-type transition, involving shallow state of the localized holes. We shall show that similar transitions are also present in comparable undoped samples, but the PL intensity is substantially lower. Finally, we show that the ionization energy of the relevant acceptor-like species increases with Be concentration, suggesting an effective mass type defect.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in several general pre-mRNA splicing factors have been linked to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and solid tumors. These mutations have generally been assumed to cause disease by the resultant splicing defects, but different mutations appear to induce distinct splicing defects, raising the possibility that an alternative common mechanism is involved. Here we report a chain of events triggered by multiple splicing factor mutations, especially high-risk alleles in SRSF2 and U2AF1, including elevated R-loops, replication stress, and activation of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR)-Chk1 pathway. We further demonstrate that enhanced R-loops, opposite to the expectation from gained RNA binding with mutant SRSF2, result from impaired transcription pause release because the mutant protein loses its ability to extract the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal domain (CTD) kinase-the positive transcription elongation factor complex (P-TEFb)-from the 7SK complex. Enhanced R-loops are linked to compromised proliferation of bone-marrow-derived blood progenitors, which can be partially rescued by RNase H overexpression, suggesting a direct contribution of augmented R-loops to the MDS phenotype.",

It was fabricated on quartz, silicon and ITO substrates in a progressive and uniform manner monitored by UV\u2013vis spectroscopy, and characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), cyclic voltammograms (CVs) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). A set of experimental results revealed that the incorporation of Au nanoparticles into K 6 P 2 MoW 17 O 62 -based film enhanced the conductivity of the film, leading to several or more than tenfold increase in electrocatalytic efficiency of this film for reduction of H 2 O 2 , IO 3 \u2212 , NO 2 \u2212 compared to the no use of Au nanoparticles. It also has been found that presence of Au nanoparticles endowed the film electrocatlytic activity towards oxidation of ascorbic acid and the photo-luminescence property arising from inter electron transitions between occupied 5d bands to 6sp conduction bands of AuNPs.",

In contrast to a\nrotor, which generates angular momentum by increasing the angular velocity at\napproximately constant deformation, a tidal wave generates angular momentum by\nincreasing the deformation at approximately constant angular velocity. The\nproperties of the tidal waves are calculated by means of the cranking model in\na microscopic way. The calculated energies and E2 transition probabilities of\nthe yrast states in the transitional nuclides with $Z$= 44, 46, 48 and $N=56,\n58, ..., 66$ reproduce the experiment in detail. The nonlinear response of the\nnucleonic orbitals results in a strong coupling between shape and single\nparticle degrees of freedom.",

This study describes TPLD and evaluates safety and early clinical results in the management of L5-S1 disc herniation.Between October 2001 and October 2006, 58 consecutive patients with L5-S1 disc herniations were treated with TPLD of the L5-S1 discs, and nine of the patients with L4-L5 disc herniations were treated with posterolateral percutaneous lumbar discectomy (PPLD) soon after TPLD. The patients were divided into two groups according the operator who performed the procedures. The patients were evaluated with a visual analog scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at 5 years of follow-up. Logistic regression was used to analyze significant risk factors for complications.Mean hospital stay was 6.38 days +/- 8.48. VAS scores for leg pain and ODI scores showed significant improvement at last follow-up. All patients showed favorable results with no recurrent herniations. Major and minor complications occurred in eight (13.79%) and seven cases (12.06%), respectively, during and after the procedure. Major complications occurred in seven patients treated by operator A and one treated by operator B, a significant difference between operators (P = .044). Multivariate analysis revealed that only bowel preparation remained a significant predictor of complications (P = .040).TPLD was a safe and effective procedure for the removal of disc herniations at the L5-S1 level when total bowel preparation was performed.",

We have previously reported that a novel Ts87 gene from the cDNA library of adult T. spiralis was cloned and expressed in a prokaryotic expression system. Vaccination with recombinant Ts87 protein (rTs87) induced a muscle larvae burden reduction in BALB/c mice by 29% in response to T. spiralis infection. In the present study, we screened a random phage-displayed peptide library using monoclonal antibody 5A3 which recognized Ts87 protein. Four positive phage clones were selected to subcutaneously immunize BALB/c mice without adjuvant. Two phage clones could effectively stimulate specific antibodies against rTs87. Mice vaccinated with these two combined phage clones showed a 28.7% worm burden reduction as compared to the control group. Therefore, the identified phage clones displayed peptides representing specific epitopes of Ts87 protein and could be considered as potential vaccine candidates for T. spiralis.",

The RSE formulation can be readily incorporated into all elements based on the Timoshenko beam theory and the Reissner\u2013Mindlin plate theory taking into account the transverse shear deformations. The `free model' and `constrained model' for dynamic analysis of delaminated composite beams and/or plates have been unified in this RSE formulation. The RSE formulation has been applied to an existing 2-node Timoshenko beam element taking into account the transverse shear deformations and the bending\u2013extension coupling. Frequencies and vibration mode shapes are determined through solving an eigenvalue problem. Numerical results show that the present RSE model is reliable and practical when used to predict frequencies and mode shapes of delaminated composite beams. The RSE formulation has also been used to investigate the effects of the number, size and interfacial loci of delaminations on frequencies and mode shapes of composite beams.",

In this study, we measured thrombin activity in the perihematomal zone and examined the role of thrombin in ICH-induced brain tissue loss. There were 2 experiments in this study. In the first part, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received 100 microL of either autologous whole blood or saline. The rats were killed at 1 h or 24 h later for thrombin activity measurement. Thrombin activity was measured using the thrombin-specific chromogenic substrate, S2238. In the second part, rats received a 50-microL intracaudate injection of either thrombin or saline, and the rats were killed at days 1, 3, or 28 for determination of neuronal death and brain tissue loss. We found that brain thrombin activity was elevated in ipsilateral basal ganglia 1 h after ICH. Intracerebral injection of thrombin rather than saline caused significant neuronal death at days 1 and 3, and resulted in significant brain tissue loss at day 28. These results suggest that thrombin inhibition in the acute phase may reduce ICH-induced brain damage.",

Complement activation and neutrophil infiltration contribute to brain injury after ICH. In this study, we investigated the effects of aging on activation of the complement cascade and neutrophil influx following ICH. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (3 or 18 months old) received an infusion of 100 microL autologous blood into right caudate. Rats were killed at 1, 3, 7, and 28 days after ICH and the brains were sampled for immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Levels of complement factor C9 and clusterin were used as markers for complement activation, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) staining was performed to detect neutrophil infiltration. Western blot analysis showed that complement C9 and clusterin levels in ipsilateral basal ganglia after ICH were higher in aged rats than in young rats (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry showed there were more C9- and clusterin-positive cells around the hematoma in aged rats. However, MPO-positive cells in ipsilateral basal ganglia were fewer in aged rats (p < 0.05) after ICH. Our results suggest that ICH causes more severe complement activation and less neutrophil infiltration in aged rats. Clarification of the mechanisms of brain injury after ICH in the aging brain should help develop new therapeutic strategies for ICH.",

In this study, the thermostability of a type A feruloyl esterase (AuFaeA) from Aspergillus usamii was increased by iterative saturation mutagenesis (ISM). Two amino acids, Ser33 and Asn92, were selected for saturation mutagenesis according to the B-factors analyzed by B-FITTER software and \u0394\u0394G values predicted by PoPMuSiC algorithm. After screening the saturation mutagenesis libraries constructed in Pichia pastoris, 15 promising variants were obtained. The best variant S33E/N92-4 (S33E/N92R) produced a T m value of 44.5 \u00b0C, the half-lives (t 1/2) of 35 and 198 min at 55 and 50 \u00b0C, respectively, corresponding to a 4.7 \u00b0C, 2.33- and 3.96-fold improvement compared to the wild type. Additionally, the best S33 variant S33-6 (S33E) was thermostable at 50 \u00b0C with a t 1/2 of 82 min, which was 32 min longer than that of the wild type. All the screened S33E/N92 variants were more thermostable than the best S33 variant S33-6 (S33E). This work would contribute to the further studies on higher thermostability modification of type A feruloyl esterases, especially those from fungi. The thermostable feruloyl esterase variants were expected to be potential candidates for industrial application in prompting the enzymic degradation of plant biomass materials at elevated temperatures.",

Agarose gel electrophoresis and ultraviolet spectrophotometry were used to evaluate the ability of HA to bind NR2B-siRNA at different pH values and at different HA-NR2B-siRNA ratios. And the stability of the complex in saline was also evaluated. The effect of HA/NR2B-siRNA complex on chronic inflammatory pain was evaluated in vivo in mice. Transmission electron microscopy(TEM) reveals that HA nanoparticles are thin strips or short rod in shape and the one-dimensional particle size of HA nanoparticles is 40-50 nm. Under the acid or neutral condition, the Zeta potential of HA is positive; nanoparticles can completely bind NR2B-siRNA when the HA:NR2B-siRNA ratio is at or larger than 35-1; while under the alkaline condition, the affinity of HA to NR2B-siRNA is rather weak. HA/NR2B-siRNA complex is not dissociated when being resuspended in saline. The nociception of the tonic phase induced by formalin is significantly reduced in the HA/NR2B-siRNA treated mice as compared with the controls. Therefore, HA may be a new siRNA nano-vector material.",

The new procedure differs from the previous one [Zheng, Zheng, Gu, Mo, Fan & Hao (1997). Acta Cryst. D53, 49-55] in that the direct method not only provides input phases to but also accepts feedback phases from solvent flattening, thus forming an iterative process for breaking the ambiguities and refining the values of phases. The new procedure was tested with the experimental SIR data of the known structure ribonuclease Sa. For the strongest 1000 of the total 7264 reflections, the mean F(obs)-weighted phase error is 7.5 and 9.4 degrees lower than that of the previous procedure and that of solvent flattening alone, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injury in a limb usually causes functional reorganization of the contralateral motor cortex. However, a dynamic process of the novel transhemispheric functional reorganization in the motor cortex was found in adult rats after transferring the seventh cervical nerve root from the contralateral healthy side to the injured limb. Initially the ipsilateral motor cortex activated the injured forepaw for 5 months after the operation. Then, both hemispheres of the cortex activated the injured forepaw, and finally the contralateral cortex exclusively controlled the injured forepaw. It is concluded an extensive functional shift occurred between two hemispheres based on neural plasticity in the CNS. The experimental results of the later lesions of the ipsilateral cortex suggest that maintaining transhemispheric functional reorganization does not depend on the corpus callosum, but depends on mechanisms involving central axonal sprouting. Possible mechanisms underlying the alternative changes in cortical functions were discussed in rats and in patients having similar operations.",

        "abstract": "Current mobile information technologies fundamentally influence evidence dissemination from the perspective of both evidence seekers and evidence providers. However, there is no related study which tried using a mobile-based platform to disseminate evidence in China. The main object of this study is to develop a mobile-based evidence resource platform and to evaluate its effects of improving nurses' access to evidence-based practice resources and meeting users' demands. The mobile-based evidence resource platform was developed in 2014. A cross-sectional study was conducted over a period of 2\u00a0months between December 2015 and January 2016 to evaluate user experiences of and preferences regarding the platform. Descriptive analysis was adopted to analyze information and its communication effects from December 2014 to March 2017. A total of 472 participants met the inclusion criteria and responded to the survey. High scores were received for the overall rating (4.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.67), evidence section (4.30\u2009\u00b1\u20090.63), learning materials section (4.26\u2009\u00b1\u20090.65), news section (4.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.66), readability (4.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.63), design and structure (4.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.63), and interactivity (3.58\u2009\u00b1\u20090.84). As of March 31, 2017, the total number of followers was 28,954. The total number of readings was 584,834. The most current WCI value was 388.72. Our study demonstrated that the mobile-based platform for evidence transfer can promote the accessibility of evidence and meet users' demands. This mobile-based platform is currently available in the WeChat application environment. It will be a wise option for healthcare professionals for the purposes of learning about EBP and disseminating evidence in China.",

        "abstract": "The identification of gene variants plays an important role in the diagnosis of genetic diseases.To develop a rapid method for the diagnosis of phenylketonuria (PKU) and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency, we designed a multiplex, PCR-based primer panel to amplify all the exons and flanking regions (50 bp average) of six PKU-associated genes (PAH, PTS, GCH1, QDPR, PCBD1 and GFRP). The Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) System was used to detect mutations in all the exons of these six genes. We tested 93 DNA samples from blood specimens from 35 patients and their parents (32 families) and 26 healthy adults. Using strict bioinformatic criteria, this sequencing data provided, on average, 99.14% coverage of the 39 exons at more than 70-fold mean depth of coverage. We found 23 previously documented variants in the PAH gene and six novel mutations in the PAH and PTS genes. A detailed analysis of the mutation spectrum of these patients is described in this study.These results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. In conclusion, benchtop next-generation sequencing technology can be used to detect mutations in monogenic diseases and can detect both point mutations and indels with high sensitivity, fidelity and throughput at a lower cost than conventional methods in clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "A major challenge of combinatorial therapy is the unification of the pharmacokinetics and cellular uptake of various drug molecules with precise control of the dosage thereby maximizing the combined effects. To realize ratiometric delivery and synchronized release of different drugs from a single carrier, a novel approach was designed in this study to load dual drugs onto the macromolecular carrier with different molar ratio by covalently preconjugating dual drugs through peptide linkers to form drug conjugates. In contrast to loading individual types of drugs separately, these drug conjugates enable the loading of dual drugs onto the same carrier in a precisely controllable manner to reverse multidrug resistance (MDR) of human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. As a proof of concept, the synthesis and characterization of xyloglucan\u2013mitomycin C/doxorubicin (XG\u2013MMC/DOX) conjugates were demonstrated. This approach enabled MMC and DOX to be conjugated to the same polymeric carrier with precise control of drug dosage. The cytotoxicity and combinatorial effects were significantly improved compared to the cocktail mixtures of XG\u2013MMC and XG\u2013DOX as well as the individual conjugate of the mixture. Moreover, the results also showed that there was an optimum ratio of dual drugs showing the best cytotoxicity effect and greatest synergy among other tested polymeric conjugate formulations.",

        "abstract": "Purinergic ionotropic P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs) are closely associated with excitotoxicity and nociception. Inhibition of P2X7R activation has been considered as a potentially useful strategy to improve recovery from spinal cord injury and reduce inflammatory damage to trauma. The physiological functions of P2X7Rs, however, are poorly understood, even though such information is essential for making the P2X7R an effective therapeutic target. We show here that P2X7Rs in satellite cells of dorsal root ganglia tonically inhibit the expression of P2X3Rs in neurons. Reducing P2X7R expression using siRNA or blocking P2X7R activity by antagonists elicits P2X3R up-regulation, increases the activity of sensory neurons responding to painful stimuli, and evokes abnormal nociceptive behaviors in rats. Thus, contrary to the notion that P2X7R activation is cytotoxic, P2X7Rs in satellite cells play a crucial role in maintaining proper P2X3R expression in dorsal root ganglia. Studying the mechanism underlying the P2X7R-P2X3R control, we demonstrate that activation of P2X7Rs evokes ATP release from satellite cells. ATP in turn stimulates P2Y1 receptors in neurons. P2Y1 receptor activation appears to be necessary and sufficient for the inhibitory control of P2X3R expression. We further determine the roles of the P2X7R-P2Y1-P2X3R inhibitory control under injurious conditions. Activation of the inhibitory control effectively prevents the development of allodynia and increases the potency of systemically administered P2X7R agonists in inflamed rats. Thus, direct blocking P2X7Rs, as proposed before, may not be the best strategy for reducing pain or lessening neuronal degeneration because it also disrupts the protective function of P2X7Rs.",

        "abstract": "OX40, a membrane-bound molecule of the tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor superfamily, is a critical costimulatory receptor during the immune response. Here, we newly generated two specific mouse antihuman OX40 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (2G2 and 1F7), whose specificities are quite different from the available OX40 mAb (ACT35) by competition assay. It was also found that both mAbs could enhance the proliferation, activation and differentiation of T lymphocytes primed by anti-CD3 mAb. These results evidenced that both were functional antihuman OX40 mAbs. Furthermore, stained by 2G2 and 1F7, FCM and immunohistochemistry detected the constitutive expression of OX40 on tumor cell lines from epithelium, breast cancer and glioma tissues. Meanwhile, the non-tumor tissues (thyroid gland, stomach gland) were also found OX40 expression. These results suggested that OX40 is not only expressed in activated T cells, but also in some tumors as well as normal gland tissues. Such expression pattern indicated that OX40 may be a valuable surface antigen in unveiling its expression and function outside the immune system. Briefly, these novel antibodies may contribute to the evaluation of the mechanism of tumor metastasis and eventually shed light on further study of tumor immunotherapy and autoimmune diseases.",

        "abstract": "Lead exposure is known to be associated with cognitive dysfunction in children. Impairment of the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) has been reported in area CA1 of rat hippocampus following lead exposure in vivo and in vitro . The present study was carried out to investigate whether the alterations of N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA) receptor-independent LTP following lead exposure involve internal calcium stores in hippocampus CA1 synapses. Monosynaptic field excitatory postsynaptic potentials in hippocampal slice area CA1 were recorded using the whole-cell patch-clamp upon acute lead treatment, and these studies were coupled with calcium imaging experiments to observe internal calcium changes in cultured hippocampal neurons. Inhibiting calcium release by ryanodine significantly reduced NMDA receptor-independent LTP, and depletion of internal calcium stores with thapsigargin blocked this form of LTP. Caffeine, an agonist of ryanodine receptors, enhanced this form of LTP. However, caffeine-enhanced NMDA receptor-independent LTP was depressed after bath application of lead. Moreover, lead further decreased ryanodine- and thapsigargin-reduced NMDA receptor-independent LTP. Calcium imaging also confirmed that lead had an effect on internal calcium release and uptake. Taken together, these results demonstrated that lead inhibited NMDA receptor-independent LTP by action on calcium release and uptake by ryanodine-sensitive stores in rat hippocampal area CA1.",

        "abstract": "In this study, the effects of lead (Pb2+) on voltage-gated sodium channel currents (INa) were investigated in acutely dissociated rat hippocampal CA1 neurons using the conventional whole-cell patch-clamp technique. We found that Pb2+ reduced the amplitudes of INa in a concentration-dependent manner, and the effect could be washed out by extracellular application of 3 mM EGTA. The results also showed that at the concentration of 100 microM, Pb2+ decreased the activation threshold and the voltage at which the maximum INa current was evoked and caused negative shifts of INa steady-state activation curve, and enlarged INa tail-currents; Pb2+ induces a left shift of the steady-state inactivation curve, and delayed the recovery of INa from inactivation, and reduced the fraction of available sodium channels; Pb2+ delayed the activation of INa in a concentration- and voltage-dependent manner, and prolonged the time course of the fast inactivation of sodium channels; activity-dependent attenuation of INa was not altered by Pb2+. It was suggested that Pb2+ might exert its effects on sodium channels by binding a specific site on the extracellular side of sodium channels and dragging the IIS4 voltage sensor outwardly. The interaction of Pb2+ with voltage-dependent sodium channels may lead to change in electrical activity and contribute to worsen the neurotoxicological damage.",

        "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is progressive fatal aortic pathological dilation, which is characterized by increased proteoglycans and loss of elastic fibers. Recent advances on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), an important regulator in many biological processes, suggested the close correlation between expression patterns and disease progression. In the present study, the ascending aortic tissues were collected from ascending TAA patients (n\u2009=\u200933) and organ donors (n\u2009=\u200916). Microarray analysis and real-time PCR were then applied to detect the lncRNA expression profiles. A total of 147 differentially expressed lncRNAs were determined, including 104 upregulated and 43 downregulated lncRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis showed 51.7% of differentially expressed lncRNAs were sense-overlapping, and most of the down-regulated lncRNAs were located on chromosome 1, 7, and 12. Subgroup analysis of TAA patients indicated that the expression of lnc-HLTF-5 was significantly higher in hypertension group than non-hypertension group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Spearman correlation analysis further confirmed that the lnc-HLTF-5 level was positively correlated with the expanded ascending aortic diameter (r \u2009=\u20090.483, P\u2009=\u20090.004) and MMP9 level (r \u2009=\u20090.465, P\u2009=\u20090.006). Our results expanded the lncRNA expression patterns in aortic disease, and provided experimental basis for future investigation on TAA pathogenesis. This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "Autophagy is a highly regulated intracellular process to maintain cellular homeostasis by degrading damaged proteins and organelles. Dysregulation of autophagic activity in cardiomyocytes is implicated in various heart diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms of cardiomyocyte autophagy are not yet known. In this study, the enhanced cardiomyocyte autophagy was induced by angiotensin II (0.1\u00a0\u03bcmol/L), demonstrated by the increase of double-membraned autophagosomes, BECN1 expression, and the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II. Microarray assay showed that a total of 197 genes were differentially expressed in angiotensin II-treated cardiomyocytes, including 22 upregulated and 175 downregulated. Gene ontology functional enrichment analysis showed that nearly 50% of differentially expressed genes were related to metabolism and energy maintenance in biological process. Pathway analysis showed that most frequently represented pathways were involved in metabolism and the citric acid cycle and respiratory electron transport. Based on KEGG database, 10 differentially expressed genes were found to be involved in autophagic signaling pathways. The hub genes with high degree were predicted to regulate cardiomyocyte autophagy activity by PPI network analysis. NEDD4, the top focus hub gene, showed a clear time-dependent increased expression pattern in cardiomyocytes during angiotensin II treatment. Moreover, inhibition of NEDD4 could significantly reduce cardiomyocyte autophagy induced by angiotensin II. In summary, the cardiomyocyte autophagy-related genes were screened by microarray assay combining with bioinformatics analysis. The role of NEDD4 on cardiomyocyte autophagy might provide valuable clues to finding therapeutic targets for heart diseases.",

        "abstract": "Objective To observe the retinal and choroidal biological effect on the irradiated area during hematoporphyrin mono methyl ether photodynamic therapy (HMME PDT) at different irradiation opportunity with different light energy.Methods Following intravenous injection of HMME 5mg/kg body weight from the marginal ear vein in the New Zealand rabbits, the fundus was irradiated 10 seconds and 5,10 and 15 minutes,respectively after photosensitizer injection using 532\ue5f2nm laser light with an irradiance of 200, 300 and 400 mW/cm~2 and 16, 30 and 40 J/cm~2, respectively. The treated areas were imaged by fundus photography and fluorescein angiography at 6(th), 12(th) hour, 1(st), 3(rd) and 5(th) day following HMME PDT and the treated areas were cut out to be examined by histopathology when the occlusion of the choriocapillaris or retinal damage could be identified.Results When the interval between the end of the injection and commencement of the irradiation was 10 s,and 5, 10 and 15 minutes, the rate of choriocapillaris occlusion was 100%,100%,0%,0%; 100%,100%,20%,0%; and 100%,100%,40%,0% with 16, 30 and (40\ue5f2J/cm~2),respectively.The occlusion of the choriocapillaris was seen at the 3(rd) and 1(st) day, respectively when activating laser light was applied within 10 seconds after HMME injection with a fluence of 16 and 30\ue5f2J/cm~2. When the energy fluence was up to (40\ue5f2J/cm~2,) the retinal damage at the irradiated area appeared at 6(th) hour after PDT, which could be recover at the 5(th) day and choriocapillaris could be seen closed clearly simultaneously.Conclusions HMME PDT is effective in occluding the choriocapillaris. The appearance of photodynamic effect is related with the irradiation opportunity and light dose.Activating light needs to be applied within 5 minutes after photosensitizer injection to achieve vascular occlusion. And the higher the light dose is, the earlier the photodynamic effect will appear.",

To explore the role of Cypher in myocardium and to better understand molecular mechanisms by which mutations in cypher cause cardiomyopathy, we utilized a conditional approach to knockout Cypher, specially in either developing or adult myocardium. Cardiac-specific Cypher knockout (CKO) mice developed a severe form of DCM with disrupted cardiomyocyte ultrastructure and decreased cardiac function, which eventually led to death before 23 weeks of age. A similar phenotype was observed in inducible cardiac-specific CKO mice in which Cypher was specifically ablated in adult myocardium. In both cardiac-specific CKO models, ERK and Stat3 signaling pathways were augmented. Finally, we demonstrate the specific binding of Cypher's PDZ domain to the C-terminal region of both calsarcin-1 and myotilin within the Z-line. In conclusion, our studies suggest that (i) Cypher plays a pivotal role in maintaining adult cardiac structure and cardiac function through protein-protein interactions with other Z-line proteins, (ii) myocardial ablation of Cypher results in DCM with premature death and (iii) specific signaling pathways participate in Cypher mutant-mediated dysfunction of the heart, and may in concert facilitate the progression to heart failure.",

Enigma subfamily proteins (Enigma, Enigma homolog protein, and Cypher) of the PDZ-LIM domain protein family are Z-line proteins. Among the Enigma subfamily, Cypher has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in the structure and function of striated muscle, whereas the role of Enigma homolog protein (ENH) in muscle remains largely unknown.We studied the role of Enigma homolog protein in the heart using global and cardiac-specific ENH knockout mouse models.We identified new exons and splice isoforms for ENH in the mouse heart. Impaired cardiac contraction and dilated cardiomyopathy were observed in ENH null mice. Mice with cardiac specific ENH deletion developed a similar dilated cardiomyopathy. Like Cypher, ENH interacted with Calsarcin-1, another Z-line protein. Moreover, biochemical studies showed that ENH, Cypher short isoform and Calsarcin-1 are within the same protein complex at the Z-line. Cypher short isoform and Calsarcin-1 proteins are specifically downregulated in ENH null hearts.We have identified an ENH-CypherS-Calsarcin protein complex at the Z-line. Ablation of ENH leads to destabilization of this protein complex and dilated cardiomyopathy.",

        "abstract": "As a promising component for body sensor networks, the wearable sensors for hand gesture recognition have increasingly received great attention in recent years. By interpreting human intentions through hand gestures, the natural human-robot interaction can be realized in the smart home where the youth and the elderly can perform hand gestures to control the household robot or the robotic wheelchair. Here, a wearable wrist-worn camera sensor (WristCam) was shown to recognize hand trajectory gestures. The moving velocity of the useru0027s hand was deduced from the matched Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) keypoints of the moving background of the video sequence. Furthermore, the segmentation of continuous gestures was achieved by detecting the predefined gesture starting signal from the hand region of the image, which was segmented by the Lazy Snapping algorithm. In our study, 10 types of gestures and 1350 gesture samples collected from 15 subjects at 3 different scenes were classified by the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm and the results achieved an average recognition accuracy up to 97.6%. Moreover, the practicability of the proposed system was further demonstrated by controlling a cooperative robot to draw letters on paper.",

These advances have accelerated the development of wearable sensors. Wearable sensors with excellent flexibility, stretchability, durability and sensitivity, shows attractive application prospects in the next generation of personal devices for chronic dis-ease care. Flexible and stretchable wearable sensors play an important role in endowing chronic disease care systems with the capability of long-term and real-time track-ing of biomedical signals. These signals are closely associated with human body chronic conditions, such as heart rate, wrist/neck pulse, blood pressure, body temperature and biofluids information. Monitoring these signals with wearable sensors provides a convenient and non-invasive way for chronic disease diagnoses and health monitoring. In this review, the applications of wearable sensors in chronic disease care are introduced. In addition, this re-view exploits a comprehensive investigation onto requirements for flexibility and stretchability, and methods of nano-based enhancement. Furthermore, recent progress in wearable sensors including pressure, strain, electrophysiological, electrochemical, temperature and multifunctional sensors, are presented.

        "abstract": "We report the genetic linkage map of Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian). An F1 population comprising 94 Jian carp individuals was mapped using 254 microsatellite markers. The genetic map spanned 1 381.592 cM and comprised 44 linkage groups, with an average marker distance of 6.58 cM. We identified eight quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for body weight (BW) in seven linkage groups, explaining 12.6% to 17.3% of the phenotypic variance. Comparative mapping was performed between Jian carp and mirror carp (Cyprinus carpio L.), which both have 50 chromosomes. One hundred and ninety-eight Jian carp marker loci were found in common with the mirror carp map, with 186 (93.94%) showing synteny. All 44 Jian carp linkage groups could be one-to-one aligned to the 44 mirror carp linkage groups, mostly sharing two or more common loci. Three QTLs for BW in Jian carp were conserved in mirror carp. QTL comparison suggested that the QTL confidence interval in mirror carp was more precise than the homologous interval in Jian carp, which was contained within the QTL interval in Jian carp. The syntenic relationship and consensus QTLs between the two varieties provide a foundation for genomic research and genetic breeding in common carp.",

        "abstract": " Hemibarbus labeo is a valuable freshwater fish species distributed in the Heilongjiang River basin in China. Wild resources have declined sharply in recent years because of overfishing and pollution. Herein, twenty polymorphic microsatellites were isolated from an enriched genomic library in H. labeo for genetic conservation. These markers were characterized in 27 wild and 48 cultured individuals. The number of alleles per locus ranged from two to ten, with an average of 5.200. The observed heterozygosity and the expected heterozygosity varied from 0.086 to 0.870 (mean\u00a0=\u00a00.538) and from 0.116 to 0.861 (mean\u00a0=\u00a00.5441), respectively. Three and two loci significantly deviated from Hard\u2013Weinberg equilibrium in wild and cultured individuals, respectively. Three pairwise comparisons of six loci showed significant genotypic linkage disequilibrium in cultured individuals. These polymorphic markers represent a powerful tool to study population genetic diversity, genetic conservation and breeding systems in H. labeo. ",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that fusarochromanone (FC101), a mycotoxin, is cytotoxic in a variety of cell lines. However, the molecular mechanism underlying its cytotoxicity remains elusive. Here we found that FC101 induced cell death in COS7 and HEK293 cells in part by activating JNK pathway. This is evidenced by the findings that inhibition of JNK with SP600125 or expression of dominant negative c-Jun partially prevented FC101-induced cell death. Furthermore, we observed that FC101-activated JNK pathway was attributed to induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger and antioxidant, suppressed FC101-induced activation of JNK and cell death. Moreover, we noticed that FC101 inhibited the serine/threonine protein phosphatases 2A (PP2A) and 5 (PP5) in the cells, which was abrogated by NAC. Overexpression of PP2A or PP5 partially prevented FC101-induced activation of JNK and cell death. The results indicate that FC101-induced ROS inhibits PP2A and PP5, leading to activation of JNK pathway and consequently resulting in cell death.",
