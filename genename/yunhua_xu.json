        "abstract": "Spin-coating one polymer solution on another spin-cast polymer film is believed to result in unfavorable interfacial mixing. Here, we show some results to demonstrate that some interesting properties will be obtained in such mixed bilayer films formed by sequential spin-coating. Poly(9-vinylcarbazole) and poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl) were chosen as the first and second polymer layers, respectively. By varying the initial thickness of the first layer, some interesting variations were observed. The spectroscopic features of beta-phase polyfluorene were utilized to reflect the variations at the complicated interface. Morphologies were also presented to illustrate that the variations of spectroscopic features were accompanied with some interesting morphological changes. On the basis of these results, a schematic model was proposed to gain insight into the mixed interface formed by sequential spin-coating. Polymer light-emitting devices based on such films were also investigated.",

A high capacity of 197 mAh/g was found for the Sn nanoparticles in KIBs. In situ transmission electron microscopy characterization revealed a two-step potassiation mechanism: formation of a KSn phase after full potassiation and reversible nanopore formation during the cycling of Sn nanoparticles. However, significant capacity fading occurred after a few cycles, which was caused by the severe pulverization of the Sn nanoparticles. This work offers a fundamental understanding of the reaction and degradation mechanisms of alloying-type anodes for KIBs, shedding light on the development of high-performance KIBs.",

        "abstract": "Potassium-sulfur (K-S) batteries are promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage applications due to the high capacity and low cost, but have been seldom investigated. Here we report room-temperature K-S batteries using a microporous carbon-confined small-molecule sulfur composite cathode. The synergetic effects of the strong confinement of microporous carbon matrix and the small-molecule sulfur structure can effectively eliminate the formation of soluble polysulfides and thus ensure a high reversible capacity of 1198.3 mA h g-1 and retain 72.5% after 150 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of as high as ~97%. The potassium-storage mechanism of sulfur cathodes was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and theoretical calculations. The results suggest that K2S is the final potassiation product along with the the reaction of 2K + S \u2194 K2S, yielding a theoretical capacity of 1675 mA h g-1. Our findings not only provide an effective strategy to fabricate high performance room-temperature K-S batteries but also offer a fundamental understanding of the potassium storage mechanism of sulfur cathode materials.",

        "abstract": "Inferior rate performance, insufficient cycle life and low mass loading have restricted the practical application of hard carbon (HC) anodes in sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). Here, a compatible strategy is developed by matching HC anodes with an ether-based electrolyte. Systematical investigation reveals that good compatibility of the electrode-electrolyte systems forms thinner but more sustainable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), and delivers higher ionic conductivity and Na+ ion diffusion coefficient than the commonly-used ester-based electrolytes. Therefore, an excellent electrochemical performance is demonstrated with a long cycle life (~ 196 mAh/g and 90% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 1 A/g), a super rate capability (~ 51% capacity retention at 10 A/g) at a mass loading of 1.5 mg/cm2, and a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 85.9%. More importantly, high reversible areal capacity of 4.3 mAh/cm2 can be achieved at an ultra-high mass loading of 17 mg/cm2, superior to all reported HC anodes. Our findings not only shed light on the design of high performance battery systems but also promise a commercial transformation from lab test to mass production of NIBs.",

        "abstract": "A new blue-green light-emitting iridium(\u2162)bis(1-phenylpyridine)(1,2,4-triazole pyridine)complex was synthesized by the reaction of 1-phenylpyridine,1,2,4-triazole pyridine and iridium trichloride hydrate,which expanded the choice range of blue-light iridium complexes effectively.Most of multilayer phosphorescent devices which have been reported before were fabricated by high vacuum thermal evaporation.In this paper,polyvinylcarbazole(PVK)was used as polymer host by comparing the spectra overlap degree of photoluminescent(PL)emission spectrum of the host polymer(PVK and polyfluorene)and the absorption spectra of the iridium complex.Single-layer polymer blends structures are advantageous because they can be fabricated by solution processing at room temperature.Different concentration of iridium complex guest was doped into PVK host.PL spectra in solid film state weren't the same as those in solution state.Energy transfer from host to guest in solution state wasn't completely comparing with that in solid film state.Because F\ue54frster and Dexter energy transfer could be happened at the same time in solid film state.While in solution state,the distance of intermolecule is becoming farther,Dexter energy transfer couldn't be happened.With the increase of doping concentration,the intensity of PL emission peak of complex increased gradually.The structure of the complex was characterized by elemental analysis,1HNMR,and liquid-mass spectroscopy.The UV-Vis spectrum,photoluminescence spectrum and photoluminescence efficiency were investigated.Electroluminescence(EL)device was fabricated when the complex guest of 2% was doped into polymer host PVK.The UV-Vis spectrum showed the absorption peaks below 350 nm are attributed to the spin-allowed single state 1\u03c0-\u03c0* transition of cyclometalated ligands.The complex also gives rise to a strong photoluminescence at 470 nm at room temperature under photo excitation.Compared to the photoluminescence spectrum,a red-shifted of emission was observed from the electroluminescence spectrum.This maybe resulted from the congregation of small-molecule guest or the formation of excimer.The reason of red-shift of EL spectra is in progress.",

        "abstract": "Poly(thiophene) as a kind of n-doped conjugated polymer with reversible redox behavior can be employed as anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the low redox activity and poor rate performance for the poly(thiophene)-based anodes limit its further development. Herein, a structure-design strategy is reported for thiophene-containing conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) with extraordinary electrochemical performance as anode materials in LIBs. The comparative study on the electrochemical performance of the structure-designed thiophene-containing CMPs reveals that high redox-active thiophene content, highly crosslinked porous structure, and improved surface area play significant roles for enhancing electrochemical performances of the resulting CMPs. The all-thiophene-based polymer of poly(3,3\u2032-bithiophene) with crosslinked structure and a high surface area of 696 m2 g\u22121 exhibits a discharge capacity of as high as 1215 mAh g\u22121 at 45 mA g\u22121, excellent rate capability, and outstanding cycling stability with a capacity retention of 663 mAh g\u22121 at 500 mA g\u22121 after 1000 cycles.

Herein, a novel nanocomposite anode material is designed and synthesized by anchoring red P nanoparticles on a 3D carbon nanosheet framework for K-ion batteries (KIBs). The red P@CN composite demonstrates a superior electrochemical performance with a high reversible capacity of 655 mA h g at 100 mA g and a good rate capability remaining 323.7 mA h g at 2000 mA g , which outperform reported anode materials for KIBs. The transmission electron microscopy and theoretical calculation results suggest a one-electron reaction mechanism ofP + K + e \u2192 KP, corresponding to a theoretical capacity of 843 mA h g ,which is the highest value for anode materials investigated for KIBs. The study not only sheds light on the rational design of high performance red P anodes for KIBs but also offers a fundamental understanding of the potassium storage mechanism of red P.",

        "abstract": "Potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) are an emerging energy storage technology for low cost and large scale applications. However, they suffer from insufficient cycle life and poor rate capability caused by the large K ions. In this paper, these problems are circumvented by using free-standing porous carbon nanofiber (CNF) paper anodes. Excellent electrochemical performance was demonstrated with an extremely high rate capability retaining 100 mA h g\u22121 at the current rate of 7.7 A g\u22121, a high reversible capacity of 270 mA h g\u22121 and a very low decay rate of 0.01% per cycle over 1200 cycles, which are much better than those of previously reported anode materials in KIBs and even in most sodium-ion batteries. The superior performance is attributed to the unique structure of CNFs, in which the porous structure can effectively alleviate the volume expansion induced by the insertion of large K ions. Considering the abundance and widespread distribution of potassium in the Earthu0027s crust, the encouraging results make KIBs a strong competitor to Na-ion batteries as an alternative energy storage technology to Li-ion batteries.",

Electrophosphorescence was investigated in the device structure [indium-tin-oxide (ITO)/poly(ethlenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)/poly(vinylcarbazole)(PVK)/Poly(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl) end capped with dimethylphenyl (PFO): (Btp) 2 Ir(PZ)/Ba/Al] by using this iridium complex as guest and PFO as host. The red electrophosphorescent devices showed a peak emission at approximately 604\u00a0nm and shoulder at 654\u00a0nm with the Commission International de'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.64, 0.35) and external quantum efficiency of 7.7% at a doping concentration of 8\u00a0wt.% without an electron-transporting material in the emitting layer. Keywords Electrophosphorescence Iridium Polymer red-light-emitting diodes 2-(4H-1, 2, 4-triazol-3-yl)pyridine 1 Introduction Electrophosphorescent light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have attracted great scientific and commercial attention because of their high quantum efficiency recently [1\u20133] . Unlike electrofluorescence, electrophosphorescence can make full use of both singlet and triplet excitons owing to its strong spin-orbital coupling of heavy-metal ions in phosphorescent complexes. As a result, electrophosphorescence can theoretically approach 100% internal quantum efficiency [4] . Forrest and Thompson and coworkers have demonstrated efficient red light emission from platinum complex, 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethyl-21H,23H-porphine platinum(II) (PtOEP) [1] . Later, they reported efficient iridium complexes emitting colors from green to red by choosing the ligands [5] . The external quantum efficiency of the red small-molecule-based devices reached 6.5%. Iridium-based complexes are most successful and promising electrophosphorescent emitters due to its relatively short phosphorescent lifetime. So far, numerous efficient iridium complexes emitting colors from blue to deep red have been synthesized. Li et al. [6] reported very efficient and saturated red-light-emitting iridium complexes, and the small-molecule-based devices fabricated from them showed a high efficiency of 10.1%. Recently, efficient phosphorescent polymer red-light-emitting diodes were reported by doping iridium complexes into blend polymer hosts, such as polyfluorene (PFO) [7,8] and poly( N -vinylcarbazole) (PVK) [9,10] blended with electron-transporting materials such as 2-(4-biphenyl)-5-(4- tert -butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD) [10\u201312] and [1,3,5-tris( N -phenylbenzimidazol-2-yl)benzene] [13] . Polymer light-emitting devices (PLEDs) are regarded to be advantageous in large area display with low-cost solution processing technology, such as spin-casting, screen printing, or ink-jet printing techniques. Wang et al. fabricated a very efficient and saturated red PLED by doping bis(1-(3-(9,9-dimethyl-fluorene-2-yl)phenyl)isoquinoline-C2,N\u2032)iridium(III)acetylacetonate [Ir(DMFPQ) 2 acac] into PFO + 30% PBD host. The efficiency reached 18% higher than that of small molecule-based devices. Generally, an electron-transporting material is needed to improve the electron transport and injection to obtain a high efficiency for phosphorescent PLEDs. It is well known that the triazol ring has an electron deficient group, bearing the electron-transporting property. If it is introduced into the light-emitting molecules, PLEDs fabricated from which will not need additional electron-transporting materials. In this work, we synthesized an iridium complex, [bis(2-(benzo[ b ]thiophen-2-yl)pyridine)]Ir[2-(4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)pyridine] (Btp) 2 Ir(PZ), with a triazol ring. Efficient polymer red-light-emitting devices with only PFO as the host and without an electron-transporting material have been fabricated. The external quantum efficiency is up to 7.7%. 2 Experimental details 2.1 Materials and measurements All manipulations involving air-sensitive reagents were performed under an atmosphere of dry argon. All reagents, unless otherwise specified, were obtained from Aldrich, Acros and TCI Co. and used as received. Blue emitting PFO (ADS129HTE, Fig. 1 ) was purchased from ADS Co. 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on Bruker DRX 400 and AV 300 spectrometer spectrometers with deuterated solvents as the internal reference. UV\u2013Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra in solution were measured on Fluorometer (Fluorolog-3 Jobin Yvon). Cyclic voltammetry was carried out on a potentiostat/galvanostat model 283 (Princeton Applied Research) with platinum electrode at a scan rate of 50\u00a0mV/s against Ag/AgCl reference electrode with nitrogen-saturated solution of 0.1\u00a0M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu 4 NPF 6 ) in a dichloromethane solution. 2.2 Synthesis 2-(benzo[ b ]thiophen-2-yl)pyridine [14,15] and tetrakis[2-(benzo[ b ]thiophen-2-yl)pyridine] (m-dichloro)]diiridium complex were prepared according to literature methods [16] . 2.2.1 Synthesis of 2-(4H-1, 2, 4-triazol-3-yl)pyridine) A mixture of 2-cyanopyridine (6.2\u00a0g) and an excess of hydrazine hydrate (10\u00a0ml) was warmed on a water bath for 2\u00a0h and poured in small portions into an excess of ice-cold formic acid. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for about 30\u00a0min, then refluxed for about 3\u00a0h. Most of the excessive acid was removed on a rotary evaporator, and the crude product was washed with water, dried in vacuum and recrystallized from ethanol/ether mixture [17] . 1 H NMR in CDCl 3 : d (ppm) 8.76(d, 1H, J = 4.6\u00a0Hz,); 8.24(d, 1H, J = 7.9\u00a0Hz); 8.13(s, 1H); 7.88(t, 1H, J = 7.6\u00a0Hz); 7.41(m, 1H). Gas chromatograph\u2013mass spectrometer(GC\u2013MS): m / z found: 146 (calc. 146). 2.2.2 Synthesis of iridium(III) bis(2-(2\u2032-benzo[4,5- a ]thienyl)pyridine-C,N) 2-(4H-1,2, 4-triazol-3-yl)pyridine) [(Btp)2Ir(PZ)] The synthesis route of (Btp) 2 Ir(PZ) is shown in Fig. 2 . 2-(4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)pyridine) (449\u00a0mg, 3.07\u00a0mmol) and NaOMe (166\u00a0mg, 3.07\u00a0mmol) were dissolved in a methanol solution and stirred for 4\u00a0h at room temperature. The resulting solution was added dropwise to a chloroform solution (60\u00a0ml) of dichloro-bridged cyclometalated iridium complex (736\u00a0mg, 0.57\u00a0mmol). The reaction mixture was refluxed for 3\u00a0h under stirring and cooled to room temperature. The organic phase was separated and dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography using dichloromethane/acetone as the eluent in 60\u201370% yield. 1 H NMR in CDCl 3 : d (ppm) 8.26(d, 1H, J = 7.9\u00a0Hz); 8.24(s, 1H); 7.83(td, 1H, J 1 = 7.8\u00a0Hz, J 2 = 1.5\u00a0Hz,); 7.77(d, 1H, J = 8.1\u00a0Hz); 7.64(m, 7H); 7.50(d, 1H, J = 5.8\u00a0Hz); 7.16(td, 1H, J 1 = 7.5\u00a0Hz, J 2 = 1\u00a0Hz); 7.08(m, 2H); 6.86(td, 1H, J 1 = 7.7\u00a0Hz, J 2 = 1Hz); 6.76(m, 3H); 6.21(d, 1H, J = 8.0\u00a0Hz); 6.04(d, 1H, J = 7.9\u00a0Hz). 2.3 Fabrication of PLEDs The PLEDs were fabricated on commercial indium-tin-oxide (ITO) substrates with a sheet resistance of 15\u03a9/\u25a1. Before the device fabrication, the ITO substrates were cleaned using acetone, detergent, deionized water and isopropanol, respectively, and then treated with O 2 plasma for 4\u00a0min. A 50\u00a0nm thick buffer layer of PEDOT: PSS [poly(ethylendioxythiophene): poly (styrene sulfonic acid), Baytron P4083, purchased from Bayer AG] was spin-cast on the pre-processed ITO substrate and dried by baking in a vacuum at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0h. Then, a 40\u00a0nm thick layer of PVK (purchased from Aldrich) was spin-cast on the top of the PEDOT: PSS layer from chlorobenzene solution to facilitate hole injection from the anode into the emitting layer. A thin phosphorescent dye-doped emitting layer with thickness of 70\u00a0nm was spin-coated. A thin layer of Ba (4\u00a0nm) cathode and a thin capping layer of Al (200\u00a0nm) were deposited over the spin-coated polymer film at high vacuum of < 3 \u00d7 10 \u2212 4\u00a0 Pa. The active area was 0.15\u00a0cm 2 . All steps except PEDOT: PSS were performed in N 2 -filled dry boxes with oxygen and water contents less than 1\u00a0ppm. The efficiency ( E )\u2013Current density ( J )\u2013Luminance ( L ) data were collected using a Keithley 236 source measurement unit and a calibrated silicon photodiode. The external electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiencies (QE ext ) were obtained by measuring the total light output in all directions in an integrating sphere (IS-080, Labsphere). The Luminance were measured by a silicon photodiode and calibrated using a PR-705 SpectraScan Spectrophotometer (Photo Research). The Commission International de'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates and EL spectra were also recorded using PR-705 driven by Keithley model 2400 programmable voltage-current source. The PL Efficiencies and the PL spectra were achieved under the excitation of the 325\u00a0nm line of a HeCd laser with a 350\u00a0nm filter. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterizations The heteroleptic cyclometalated iridium complex was readily synthesized by addition of 2-(4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)pyridine) to the chloride-bridged iridium dimmer precursor [17] and the high purity was evidently confirmed by 1 H NMR ( Fig. 3 ). The UV\u2013Vis spectrum of the iridium complex in dichloromethane solution and PL spectrum of host polymer PFO in films are shown in Fig. 4 . The good spectra overlap between the emission spectrum of the host and absorption spectrum of (Btp) 2 Ir(PZ) meets the requirement for efficient F\u00f6rster energy transfer from the host polymer to the Ir complex. The peak absorptions of the complex appear at 288, 335, 350 and 455\u00a0nm. The intense absorption peaks below 350\u00a0nm are attributed to the spin-allowed singlet state 1 \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 \u204e transition of cyclometalated ligands. The strong absorption peak at 455\u00a0nm can be assigned to the spin-allowed triplet metal-to-ligand charge-transfer transition. The PL spectrum of the complex is shown in Fig. 4 . Its emission peaks are observed at 591 and 645\u00a0nm. PL efficiencies of the complex-doped PFO with different concentrations are shown in Table 1 . The PL efficiency has a slight decrease with increasing doping concentration due to the concentration quenching. The electrochemical behavior of the Ir complex was investigated by cyclic voltammetry in the solution of 0.1\u00a0M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu 4 NPF 6 ) in dichloromethane. The detailed measurement method was followed procedure described in previous publication [18] . The onset of oxidation potential of the Ir complex is 0.6\u00a0V. Highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level is estimated according to an empirical formula [19] , E HOMO = \u2212(Eox + 4.4) (eV). Lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level is estimated from the optical band gap. HOMO and LUMO levels of the Ir complex are calculated as \u2212 5.0\u00a0eV and \u2212 2.5\u00a0eV, respectively. 3.2 Electrophosphorescent properties The devices were fabricated in the configuration of [ITO/PEDOT/PVK/PFO: (Btp) 2 Ir(PZ)/Ba/Al] and device data are listed in Table 2 . Electroluminescent (EL) spectra are shown in Fig. 5 . The current\u2013efficiency\u2013luminescence curves of devices with different doping concentrations are shown in Fig. 6 . The emission from PFO host is completely quenched when the doping concentration is 4\u00a0wt.%, indicating that efficient F\u00f6rster energy transfer occurs from PFO host to (Btp) 2 Ir(PZ) guest. At a doping concentration of 8\u00a0wt.%, the EL spectrum shows a peak emission at 604\u00a0nm and shoulder at 654\u00a0nm with CIE coordinates of (0.64, 0.35), a saturated red light. The maximum external quantum and luminous efficiencies reach 7.7% and 4\u00a0cd/A respectively at the doping concentration as high as 8\u00a0wt.%. It is higher than that of other reports in which the maximum efficiency is often achieved at a lower concentration of 2\u00a0wt.%. This is also coincident with the fact that concentration-induced quenching is not highly severe in the current PFO/iridium complex blends at higher doping concentrations ( Table 1 ). When the doping concentration is further increased to 16\u00a0wt.%, the external quantum efficiency and luminescence efficiency decrease to 3.8% and 2.0\u00a0cd/A, due to the triplet\u2013triplet annihilation. Almost all of efficient phosphorescent PLEDs reported previously used PBD or 1,3,5-tris(2- N -phenylbenzimidazolyl)benzene (TPBI) as electron-transporting materials. But in our case, high efficiency is obtained without PBD. It is attributed to the triazol ring in the iridium complex (Btp) 2 Ir(PZ) which is an electron deficient group, bearing the similar electron-transporting property as PBD or TPBI. 4 Conclusion A soluble iridium complex of (Btp) 2 Ir(PZ) was facilely synthesized and the PLEDs of [ITO/PEDOT/PVK/PFO: (Btp) 2 Ir(PZ)/Ba/Al] with polyfluorene as host and (Btp) 2 Ir(PZ) as guest were fabricated. Effective energy transfer from host to guest was realized at the doping concentration of 4\u00a0wt.%. At the doping concentration of 8\u00a0wt.%, the red electrophosphorescent devices showed a peak external quantum efficiency of 7.7% in the absence of an electron-transporting material in the emitting layer.

To simulate the display performance in different applications, such as computer desktop visualization, or video application, the color usage frequency with Gaussian distribution was adopted.

        "abstract": "Abstract   As the most promising anode material for Na-ion batteries, hard carbons suffer both poor rate capability and cycling stability, which restrict its practical application. These challenges come not only from the carbonaceous electrode structure, but also from how to tailor-design an electrolyte that can support high sodium ion transport while simultaneously providing a protective solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI). Here we develop a new strategy to decouple the \u201cbulk ion transport\u201d and \u201cinterphasial\u201d requirements for electrolytes. By pre-engineering a \u201cforeign SEI\u201d from an ester-based electrolyte, we successfully stabilized the hard carbon anodes in ether-based electrolyte and realized significant improvement in electrochemical performance. At a high rate of 500\u202fmA\u202fg -1 , a capacity of 200\u202fmA\u202fh\u202fg -1  was retained for over 1000 cycles without detectable capacity fading. Such an outstanding performance is attributed to the \u201cforeign SEI\u201d approach, which makes it possible for a synergistic cooperation between the rapid diffusion of sodium ions in ether-based electrolytes and a protective ester-originated interphase.",

The device structure consists of ITO/PEDOT/PVK/emissive layer/Ba/Al. The emissive layer is a blend of poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PFO), phenyl-substituted PPV derivative (P-PPV) and a copolymer of 9,9-dioctylfluorene and 4,7-di(4-hexylthien-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (PFO-DHTBT), which, respectively, emits blue, green and red light. The emission of pure and efficient white light was implemented by tuning the blend weight ratio of PFO: P-PPV: PFO-DHTBT to 96:4:0.4. The maximum current efficiency and luminance are, respectively, 7.6 cd/A at 6.7 V and 11930 cd/m2 at 11.2 V. The CIE coordinates of white-light emission were stable with the drive voltages. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

However, CMPs and the structure-performance relationship have not been reported for potassium-ion batteries (KIBs). Here, we report structure-engineered CMP anodes with tunable electronic structures for high performance KIBs. The results demonstrate that electronic structure of the CMPs play an important role in enhancing potassium storage capability, including the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) distribution, LUMO energy level and band gap. These can be finely tuned by synthetic control. It was revealed that the poly(pyrene-co-benzothiadizole) (PyBT) with optimized structure can deliver a high reversible capacity of 428 mAh g\uf02d1 and an excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding for designing CMP anode materials for high performance potassium-organic energy storage devices.",

Recently, non-aqueous potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) are emerging as a promising energy storage system due to the abundance of potassium and the encouraging battery performance. Here, the recent research progress in non-aqueous KIBs is summarized, including electrode materials, electrolytes, battery architectures and fundamental electrochemical processes.

It was found that the prepared polyfluorenes exhibit good device performances, and the best device efficiency was achieved based on PFN-Irpiq1 that showed a maximal quantum efficiency (QE max ) of 3.7% and 1.6% for Al and Au as cathode, respectively, which was comparable to that of 5.5% for low work-function metals Ba as cathode. The efficiencies of devices from the aforementioned polymers showed a reduced roll-off upon the increase of current density, which is beneficial for the highly efficient phosphorescent dye/host-doped systems. The obtained high efficiencies with air-stable metals as cathode reflect that the copolymers have dual functions of being efficient light-emitting and electron injection ability. The results indicated that the incorporation of Ir complex into amino-alkyl containing polyfluorenes side chain is a potential approach to achieve efficient light-emitting devices with air-stable high work-function metal as the cathode.",

Keywords Iridium complexes Phosphorescence White polymer light-emitting devices 1 Introduction White organic/polymer light-emitting diodes (WO/PLEDs) have received significant attention over the past several years, due to their great potential for LCD display backlight and general lighting sources [1,2] . The promise of cost-effective fabrication and high efficiency provides an incentive to further develop these devices. Such approaches for creating white light rely on emission from primary colors (red, green, and blue) [3,4] or complementary colors (i.e., blue and yellow) [5,6] . Highly efficient and color stability WO/PLEDs using iridium complexes have been reported using blue fluorescence and green and red phosphorescent dyes [3,7] . Many studies were proposed in designing new materials [8] and device structures [9] . Significant progress has been made for WOLEDs with a phosphor doped into polymer host [10] ; however, it needs further improvement in order to meet commercial application. Recently, we have reported a new red iridium complex by introducing the electron-transfer ancillary ligand 2-(2 H -1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)pyridine ( pt ) into Ir(1-piq) 2 pt complex to alter the electron-transporting property [11] . High-efficiency PLED was achieved with PFO-poss doped with 2% Ir(1-piq) 2 pt with an external quantum efficiency of 10.4% and a luminous efficiency of 9.4 cd/A at 10.8 mA/cm 2 , while Ir(1-piq) 3 performed the highest efficiency of 3.9% at 11 mA/cm 2 with the same device structure. In this paper, a new yellow-emitting iridium complex, Ir(3-piq) 2 pt with 3-phenylisoquinoline as cyclometalated ligand, by introducing pt as ancillary ligand was synthesized. Introducing the electron-transfer ancillary ligand pt into Ir(3-piq) 2 pt complex may be anticipated to alter the electron-transporting property. By using this complex as dopant and polyfluorene (PF) as the host as well as the blue emitter, efficient white-emitting device was obtained. The devices with yellow-emitting and white-emitting were obtained, and the device performance of these two systems was discussed. This information could be useful for the design of an efficient white phosphor. 2 Experiments 2.1 Measurement and characterization 1 H NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker DRX 400 with tetramethylsilane as reference. EI-MS was recorded on a LCQ DECA XP liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (Thremo Group). UV\u2013vis absorption spectra were recorded on a HP 8453 UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out on a CHI660A electrochemical workstation in a solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu 4 NPF 6 ) (0.1 M) in dichloromethane at a scan rate of 10 mV/s at room temperature under the argon atmosphere. A platinum electrode was used as the working electrode. A Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode. All reactions and manipulations were carried out under N 2 atmosphere. All chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. 2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 2-(2-Phenylethynyl)benzaldehyde ( 1 ) To a solution of 2-bromobenzaldehyde (19.23 g, 104 mmol) and phenylacetylene (12.70 g, 124 mmol) in Et 3 N (40 mL) was added PdCl 2 (PPh 3 ) 2 (1.45 g, 2 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 5 min, and CuI (0.196 mg, 1 mmol) was added. The resulting mixture was then heated under a nitrogen atmosphere at 50 \u00b0C for 4 h. TLC to establish completion monitored the reaction. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the ammonium salt was removed by filtration. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using 20:1 hexanes/EtOAc to afford 13.20 g (61.6%) of the compound as a yellow oil [12] , GC\u2013MS: m / z 206 (M + ). 2.2.2 N-(2-(2-phenylethynyl)benzylidene)-tert-butylamine ( 2 ) To a mixture of 1 (13.2 g, 64 mmol) and H 2 O (16 mL) was added tert-butylamine (15.6 g, 213 mmol). The mixture was stirred under nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature for 12 h. The excess tert-butylamine was removed under reduced pressure, and the resulting mixture was extracted with ether. The combined organic layers were dried (Na 2 SO 4 ) and filtered. Removal of the solvent afforded 15.1 g (90.5%) of the compound as a yellow oil [12] . GC\u2013MS: m / z 261 (M + ), 1 H NMR (CDCl 3 , 300 MHz), \u03b4 (ppm): 8.92 (s, 1H), 8.07\u20138.05 (m, 1H), 7.56\u20137.50 (m, 3H), 7.39\u20137.33 (m, 5H), 1.33 (s, 9H). 2.2.3 3-Phenylisoquinoline ( 3 ) 2 (1.83 g, 7 mmol), and CuI (0.134 g, 0.7 mmol) were mixed in DMF (20 mL). The mixture was heated in an oil bath at 100 \u00b0C under a nitrogen atmosphere. TLC monitored the reaction. The total reaction time is 3 h. The reaction mixture was cooled, diluted with 125 mL of ether, washed with 30 mL of saturated NH 4 Cl solution, dried (Na 2 SO 4 ), and filtered. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the crude product was chromatographed using 15:1 hexane/EtOAc as the eluent to obtain yellow powder [12] (1.43 g, 99%).

The solution was cooled to a room temperature, and the deep-red precipitate was collected on a glass filter frit. The precipitate was washed with 95% of ethanol and ethyl ether to form dark-yellow power (3.24 g, 86.9%), which was used directly for the next step without purification. 2.2.5 Ir(3-piq) 2 pt Bis(3-phenylisoquinoline-C2,N\u2032)iridium(III)(2-(1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)pyridinate) The solution of pt (0.206 g, 1.4 mmol) and sodium methoxide (0.088 g, 1.6 mmol) in anhydrous ethanol was heated to 50 \u00b0C for 1 h. A mixture of [Ir(3-piq) 2 Cl] 2 0.502 g (0.4mmol) in 10 mL dichloromethane was dropped into the reaction solution. Then the reacting mixture was refluxed for 3 h and cooled down to a room temperature. 50 mL of water and 30 mL of dichloromethane were added. The organic phase was separated and washed with water, and dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate.

The synthesis route of the yellow iridium complex is outlined in Scheme 1 . The heteroleptic Ir-complex was synthesized by the direct reaction of the dimer with pt in dichloromethane under 50 \u00b0C [11] . Purification of the mixture by silica chromatography with acetone/dichloromethane (1:1) produced Ir(3-piq) 2 pt a yellow powder in high purity. Fig. 1 shows the absorption of Ir-complex and PL spectra of neat PFO film and PFO + PBD (30%). The bands around 290, 320 nm are the absorption of ligand center, while the peak at 400\u2013420 nm is the absorption of metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption band [14] . The emission spectra of PFO and PFO + PBD (30%) showed a large spectral overlap with the MLCT band of Ir(3-piq) 2 pt, which indicate the Forster energy transfer from host to Ir(3-piq) 2 pt dopant is efficient. The inset of Fig. 1 shows the normalized PL spectra of Ir(3-piq) 2 pt in dichloromethane, with a peak at 550 nm and a shoulder at 582 nm, which is blue-shifted about 50 nm compared with Ir(1-piq) 2 pt, and 12 nm blue-shifted compared with Ir(3-piq) 2 acac. The data indicated color tuning of cyclometalated iridium complexes could be realized by the modification of the cyclometalated ligand and/or ancillary ligand. Cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the iridium complex. The complex showed one irreversible reduction process with onset at \u22121.54 V, and one quasireversible oxidation with onset at 1.16 V. Based on the data of oxidation and reduction, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the iridium complex could be calculated by the empiric formula as \u22125.56 eV, \u22122.86 eV relative to the energy level of vacuum level [15] . 3.2 Electroluminescence Devices employing blends as emissive layer were fabricated. The device architectures were as follows: device 1: ITO/PEDOT/PVK/Ir-complex ( x %):PFO + PBD (30%)/Ba/Al; device 2: ITO/PEDOT/PVK/Ir-complex ( x %):PFO/Ba/Al ( x = 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8). The EL emissions of the two devices are shown in Fig. 2 (a and b). The emission of the host decreased with the increase of guest doping concentration, which is attributed to the efficient Forster energy transfer. Meanwhile, PFO + PBD (30%) appeared to be a better host compared with PFO (100%). EL emission is dominated by Ir-complex emission peaked at 554 and 594 nm. No host (PFO + PBD (30%)) emission was observed even at dopant concentration as low as 2% (w/w). The EL performance was also studied at different Ir-complex doped concentration. As compared to device 2, device 1 showed higher efficiencies. The maximum quantum efficiency was 9.4% (16.2 cd/A) at 5.06 mA/cm 2 for device 1 (4% Ir-complex doped). The maximum brightness is 3841 cd/m 2 at 177 mA/cm 2 . The best device performance for device 2 (4% Ir-complex doped) is 4.1% (7.2 cd/A) at 3.42 mA/cm 2 . Adding PBD (30%) into PFO significantly enhanced device performance due to the improved electron transport in the presence of PBD resulting in more balanced ratio of holes and electrons. White emission can be obtained by further reducing dopant concentration purposely allowing incomplete energy transfer. A WPLED with 0.5% Ir-complex doped was studied with device 2, without electron-transporting material PBD. The CIE coordinates under driving voltages of the white-light-emitting device are summarized in Table 1 . EL spectra of WPLED investigated in this work show color stability with the increase of the voltage from 10 V to 15 V ( Fig. 3 ). Obviously, the device emitted blue fluorescent and yellow phosphorescent emissions. Moreover, the EL spectra of the device showed an apparent dependence on the operating voltage: with the increasing of the voltage, the intensity of yellow decreased gradually relative to the blue emission, but all the CIE coordinates of the device were in the white light region. The balanced emission of the device is due to the combined effects of efficient energy transfer from the blue fluorescent and exciton formation by charge trapping on the yellow Ir-complex dopant. The CIE coordinate (0.34 and 0.31) was obtained at 15 V, which is close to the ideal white point of (0.33 and 0.33). The external quantum efficiency is 2.25% and luminance is 2250 cd/m 2 at this voltage. 4 Conclusion We synthesized a new yellow-emitting iridium complex Ir(3-piq)pt. Two types of device architecture were fabricated by spin casting with PFO or PFO + PBD (30%) as host materials. The best device performance with PFO as host material (4% Ir-complex doped) is 4.1% (7.2 cd/A) at 3.42 mA/cm 2 .

The saturated red EL emission from the copolymer peaking at about 677 nm and electroluminescence (EL) efficiency of 1.4% based on simple device structure of ITO/PEDOT/PFO-DBT/Ba/Al, were achieved. The operation mechanism of the device was discussed and it was found that hole carrier injection is the major obstacle for improving EL efficiency and EL stability. To overcome such problem, we utilized MEH-PPV which has low HOMO level blended with the PFO-DBT copolymer to improve EL efficiency to 1.7%. Simultaneously, the EL emission lifetime of the device with PFO-DBT:MEH-PPV (50:50) blended polymer extended to 2000hrs. Monochrome passive red emission displays with the blended polymer were fabricated, and exhibited excellent pictures.",

Thus, multilayers of functional materials were hierarchically architectured over tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) templates that were genetically modified to self-assemble in a vertical manner on current-collectors, so that optimum power and energy densities accompanied with excellent cycle-life could be achieved on a minimum footprint. The resultant microbattery based on self-aligned LiFePO(4) nanoforests of shell-core-shell structure, with precise arrangement of various auxiliary material layers including a central nanometric metal core as direct electronic pathway to current collector, delivers excellent energy density and stable cycling stability only rivaled by the best Li-ion batteries of conventional configurations, while providing rate performance per foot-print and on-site manufacturability unavailable from the latter. This approach could open a new avenue for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) applications, which would significantly benefit from the concept that electrochemically active components be directly engineered and fabricated as an integral part of the integrated circuit (IC).",

        "abstract": "Highly stable sulfur/microporous carbon (S/MC) composites are prepared by vacuum infusion of sulfur vapor into microporous carbon at 600 \u00b0C, and lithium sulfide/microporous carbon (Li2S/MC) cathodes are fabricated via a novel and facile in situ lithiation strategy, i.e., spraying commercial stabilized lithium metal powder (SLMP) onto a prepared S/MC film cathode prior to the routine compressing process in cell assembly. The in situ formed Li2S/MC film cathode shows high Coulombic efficiency and long cycling stability in a conventional commercial Li-ion battery electrolyte (1.0 M LiPF6 + EC/DEC (1:1 v/v)). The reversible capacities of Li2S/MC cathodes remain about 650 mAh/g even after 900 charge/discharge cycles, and the Coulombic efficiency is close to 100% at a current density of 0.1C, which demonstrates the best electrochemical performance of Li2S/MC cathodes reported to date. Furthermore, this Li2S/MC film cathode fabricated via our in situ lithiation strategy can be coupled with a Li-free anode, such as graphite, carbon/tin alloys, or Si nanowires to form a rechargeable Li-ion cell. As the Li2S/MC cathode is paired with a commercial graphite anode, the full cell of Li2S/MC-graphite (Li2S-G) shows a stable capacity of around 600 mAh/g in 150 cycles. The Li2S/MC cathodes prepared by high-temperate sulfur infusion and SLMP prelithiation before cell assembly are ready to fit into current Li-ion batteries manufacturing processes and will pave the way to commercialize low-cost Li2S-G Li-ion batteries.",

The pristine micro-sized CADS delivers a high capacity of 246.7 mAh g-1, but it suffers from fast capacity decay during charge/discharge cycles. The detailed investigation reveals that the severe capacity loss is mainly attributed to the pulverization of CADS particles induced by the large volume change during sodiation/desodiation rather than the generally believed dissolution of CADS in the organic electrolyte. Minimizing the particle size can effectively suppress the pulverization, thus improving the cycling stability. Wrapping CADS with graphene oxide by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis can enhance the integration and conductivity of CADS electrodes, thus providing a high capacity of 293 mAh g-1. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Graphite, as the most common anode for commercial Li-ion batteries, has been reported to have a very low capacity when used as a Na-ion battery anode. It is well known that electrochemical insertion of Na(+) into graphite is significantly hindered by the insufficient interlayer spacing. Here we report expanded graphite as a Na-ion battery anode. Prepared through a process of oxidation and partial reduction on graphite, expanded graphite has an enlarged interlayer lattice distance of 4.3 \u00c5 yet retains an analogous long-range-ordered layered structure to graphite. In situ transmission electron microscopy has demonstrated that the Na-ion can be reversibly inserted into and extracted from expanded graphite. Galvanostatic studies show that expanded graphite can deliver a high reversible capacity of 284 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 20 mA g(-1), maintain a capacity of 184 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), and retain 73.92% of its capacity after 2,000 cycles.",

        "abstract": "This work demonstrates the effect of atomic layer deposited (ALD) Al2O3 on the reactivation of dissolved polysulfides in Li\u2013S batteries. A 0.5 nm thick layer of Al2O3 is conformally coated onto highly porous carbon cloth by ALD, and then assembled in a Li\u2013S battery between the sulfur cathode and the anode side (separator and Li anode) to function as a reactivation component. Compared to half cells with no ALD treatment, the ultrathin Al2O3 coating increases the specific discharge capacity by 25% from 907 to 1136 mA h/g at the 1st cycle, and by 114% from 358 to 766 mA h/g at the 40th cycle. Thus the ALD-Al2O3 improves the initial specific capacity and stabilizes the cycle life remarkably. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy results indicate that the ALD-Al2O3 coated carbon cloth sorbs (adsorbs/absorbs) more dissolved sulfur species from the electrolyte. Potential mechanisms for the improved sorption properties are proposed. The combination of an ultrathin ALD-oxide coating with highly porous carbons presents a new strategy to improve the performance of Li\u2013S batteries.",

Single substitution at the N3 site leads to compounds designated as C(n)-BIm(4) (n = 1, 6, 12, 16), where the subscript corresponds to the number of carbon atoms in the linear alkyl chain. Metrical parameters in the molecular structure of C(1)-BIm(4) determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies confirms the zwitterionic nature and were used to calculate the molecular dipole moment. Compounds C(n)-BIm(4) can be used to improve the electroluminescence efficiencies of polymer light emitting diodes (PLEDs) fabricated by simple solution methods that use poly[2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyloxy-1,4-phenylenevinylene)] (MEH-PPV) as the emissive semiconducting layer and aluminum as the cathode. This improvement is primarily due to a reduction in the barrier to electron injection and is strongly dependent on the length of the alkyl substituent in C(n)-BIm(4), with C(16)-BIm(4) yielding the best performance. Examination of the surface topography of C(1)-BIm(4) and C(16)-BIm(4) atop MEH-PPV by atomic force microscopy (AFM) shows that the longer alkyl chains assist in adhesion to the surface, however the coverage is poor due to insufficient wetting. These studies also reveal an unexpected planarization of the C(16)-BIm(4) layer adjacent to the electrodes after metal deposition, which is suggested to improve electrical contact. A combination of open circuit voltage measurements, surface reconstruction studies and surface potential measurements indicates that zwitterion insertion leads to the formation of a spontaneously organized dipole layer at the metal/organic interface. The net effect is a shift in the vacuum level and concomitant improvement of electron injection.",

We believe that the reason for the high performances was due to the effective electron injection from Al into PFN. PACS 72.80.Le 78.60.Fi 85.60.Jb Keywords Polymer red light-emitting diode Electron injection High work-function metal cathode 1 Introduction Polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) have been extensively investigated due to their great potential applications in full color displays and solid-state lighting sources [1\u20133] . Significant progress has been made on improving performances and understanding of the fundamental electroluminescence (EL) processes. However, the performances, such as efficiency and operating lifetime, do not yet meet commercial application requirements. One of effective methods to improve the EL efficiency is to balance holes and electrons injected from their respective electrodes. Generally, most of conjugated polymers are p-type semiconductors [4] , and holes in the EL processes are major carriers. Many works focus on improving electron injection and transportation in PLEDs. Low work-function metal cathodes, such as barium (Ba) and calcium (Ca), are commonly utilized to enhance electron injection through efficiently reducing the barrier height at the interface of cathode and emissive polymer, leading to high EL efficiencies [2,5\u20137] . Unfortunately, low work-function metals are extremely sensitive to oxygen and moisture, so the device fabrication must be processed in an inert gas or the device has to be encapsulated carefully to keep its EL stability. So far, many salts or oxides (alkaline earth metal salts and some oxides), such as LiF, CsF, Al 2 O 3 , NaCl, and Cs 2 CO 3 have been developed as the interfacial layer between Al cathode and emissive layer for enhancing electron injection [8\u201315] . Cao et al. obtained high performance PLEDs by blend of a surfactant with emissive polymers [16] . Recently, Huang et al. [17,18] , Wu et al. [19,20] and Liang et al. [21] demonstrated that the performances of PLEDs with high work-function cathodes (such as Ag and Au) were significantly improved by adding a thin layer of polyfluorene copolymers with an aminoalkyl group between emissive polymer layer and the cathode. In this work, we report an efficient red phosphorescent polymer light-emitting diodes composing of PFN blend with the triplet compound of bis(1-(3-(9,9-dimethyl-fluorene-2-yl)phenyl)isoquinoline-C2, N \u2032) iridium (III) (3-(pyridin-2\u2032-yl)-1,2,4-triazole) [Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt] as the active layer and Al as the cathode. Since PFN functioned as both host and electron injection, the PLEDs show high performances of external quantum efficiency (over 5%) and luminous (1400 cd/m 2 ). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first report on the device with the dual function polymer. 2 Experimental details Fig. 1 shows the chemical structures of PFN and Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt. The synthesis and characteristics of PFN and Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt were reported elsewhere [17,21] . Indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass with sheet resistance of 15\u201320 \u03a9/\u25a1 was used as substrate. Prior to the device fabrication, the ITO substrates underwent a wet-cleaning course in an ultrasonic bath, in sequence of acetone, detergent, deionized water, and isopropanol. After cleaning, a thin anode buffer layer of PEDOT:PSS [poly(ethylendioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid), Baytron P4083, Bayer AG] was spin-coated onto the substrates and dried via baking in a vacuum at 80 \u00b0C for 12 h. A 40 nm thick layer of PVK [poly( N -vinylcarbazole), Aldrich] was subsequently spin-cast onto the top of the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer from chlorobenzene solution to serve as a hole-transporting layer. On the top of that, the polymer emitting layer was spin-coated from PFN + Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt or PFN + Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt + 30 wt% PBD (PBD:[2-(4-biphenylyl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole]) xylene solution at desired Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt ratios to form a 80 nm thick film. Surface profiler (Tencor Alfa-Step 500) was used to determine the thickness of the polymer films. Finally, a layer of 200 nm thick Al or a thin layer of Ba (4 nm thick) with a 200 nm thick Al capping layer was thermally deposited through a shadow mask (defined active area of 0.15 cm 2 ) in a vacuum chamber at a base pressure of <3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 Pa. The layer thickness was monitored upon deposition through a crystal thickness monitor (Sycon). The device fabrication, except PEDOT:PSS coating, was carried out in a N 2 atmosphere dry-box (Vacuum Atmosphere Co.) Current density ( J )\u2013voltage ( V )\u2013luminance ( L ) data were collected by a Keithley 236 source measurement unit and a silicon photodiode calibrated by PR-705 SpectraScan Spectrophotometer (Photo Research). External EL quantum efficiency (QE ext ) was obtained by measuring the total light output in all directions in an integrating sphere (IS-080, Labsphere). The photoluminescence (PL) and EL spectra were recorded by the Spectrophotometer (PR-705) under the drive of the power source (Keithley model 2400 programmable voltage\u2013current source). 3 Results and discussion PFN has a large band gap (3.47 eV) determined by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) [17] , which was expected to be a good host for phosphorescent materials. Fig. 2 a shows the PL spectrum of PFN film and the absorption spectrum of Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt, exhibiting clearly overlap between them and suggesting F\u00f6rster energy transfer from PFN to Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt. Fig. 2 b shows the PL spectra of the films of PFN doped with various concentrations of Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt. All PL spectra show two types of emission peaks, one locates in the range of 420\u2013550 nm originated from PFN, the other is in 610\u2013650 nm from Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt. As the concentration of Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt increases from 0.5 wt% to 16 wt%, the blue band emission from PFN decreases significantly, suggesting that the efficient energy transfer occurs from PFN to Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt. Fig. 3 shows the EL spectra of the PLEDs consisting of PFN doped with various concentrations of Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt. The EL spectra are remarkably different from the PL spectra ( Fig. 2 b). In the EL spectra, the blue band emission from PFN is nearly completely quenched even at low concentration of Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt of 0.5 wt%; however, in the PL spectra, the blue band emission from PFN is still strong even at the high concentration of Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt of 16%. The remarkable difference between the PL and EL spectra in the doped systems is ascribed to the charge trapping effect in the EL processes [2,22] . The efficiency\u2013current density\u2013luminance characteristics of the devices (the structure is ITO/PEDOT/PVK/PFN:Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt/Al, defined as Al-device) with different doping concentrations of Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt are illustrated in Fig. 4 . The EL efficiencies were strongly depended on the doping concentration of Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt, and increase with the concentration from 0.5 wt% to 4 wt%, and drop dramatically when the concentration exceeds 4 wt%. The efficiency decay at high doping concentrations is believed to be due to triplet\u2013triplet annihilation [23] . The highest external quantum efficiency of 5.6% (at 16.8 V) and luminance of 1400 cd/m 2 (at 19.6 V) were obtained from the devices with 4 wt% doping concentration of Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt. In order to investigate the electron injection from Al cathode into PFN, a kind of controlled devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT/PVK/PFN:PBD (30 wt%):Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt (4 wt%)/Ba/Al (defined as Ba/Al-device) were fabricated. The PBD here serves as both electron injection from the cathode and electron transportation in PFN films. The same EL spectra were observed from the devices with either Al or Ba/Al cathode, implying that the different cathodes do not influence on the exciton recombination zone. Table 1 summarized the performances of Al-device and Ba/Al-device. Clearly, both Al-device and Ba/Al-device with or without PBD dopant, all exhibit almost same quantum efficiency. The current ( I )\u2013voltage ( V ) characteristics of the Ba/Al-device and Al-device are shown in Fig. 5 . The Ba/Al-device has a lower turn-on voltage than that of Al-device, which is agreement with the fact that the barrier height between PFN and Ba is smaller than that between PFN and Al ( Fig. 6 ). Although Fig. 6 exhibits large barrier height between PFN and Al, both kinds of devices have a similar efficiencies, as shown in Table 1 . The fact reveals a mechanism that electrons are able to inject into PFN layer efficiently from the Al cathode. The mechanism could be explained via the formation of dipole layer. To the devices with PFN thin layer attached to the Al cathode, the mechanism of a dipole formation at the interface between PFN/Al was proposed and confirmed by using small-angle X-ray diffraction [19,20] . The dipole layer was formed due to an interaction between the polarizable PFN and Al atoms, and can remarkably reduce the electron injection barrier height. As a result, efficient electron injection occurs from the Al cathode and the high performance device was realized. In addition, the devices with PBD dopant can reduce turn-on voltage, implying PBD indeed benefits for improving electron injection from Al cathode and transport in PFN layer. 4 Conclusion Efficient red emission phosphorescent PLEDs with high work-function metal cathode of Al have been demonstrated. PFN functioned as both host and electron injection layer, while Ir-compound of Ir(DMFPQ) 2 pt was the emitter. The highest external quantum efficiency and luminance of 5.6% and 1400 cd/m 2 , respectively, were obtained. Probably, it was an available way that using PFN to fabricate PLEDs to enhance performances, simplify technique and improve stability of devices without using Ba or Ca.

Energy transfer occurred from PFO to Ir(DMFPQ)2pbm, leading to electroluminescence quench of PFO. Pure and efficient white light emission was realized by tuning the weight ratio of PFO:Ir(DMFPQ)2pbm to 99.7: 0.3. The maximum current efficiency and luminance of WPLEDs were 9.6cd/A at 7.8V and 13491cd/m2 at 11.4V, respectively.",

While DNCnDBr3T compounds with n = 8, 16, 18 were found to form smectic A phase, DNC5DBr3T did not form liquid crystal phase. In addition to liquid crystal behavior, crystal polymorphism was also observed for DNC16DBr3T. It is shown that the alkyl chain length greatly affects liquid crystal phase formation. The absence of liquid crystallinity in the corresponding ester derivatives suggests that intermolecular hydrogen bonding plays a role in the formation of liquid crystal phase in the DNC nDBr3T system.",

        "abstract": "Human single-strand (ss) DNA binding proteins 1 (hSSB1) has been shown to participate in DNA damage response and maintenance of genome stability by regulating the initiation of ATM-dependent signaling. ATM phosphorylates hSSB1 and prevents hSSB1 from ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. However, the E3 ligase that targets hSSB1 for destruction is still unknown. Here, we report that hSSB1 is the bona fide substrate for an Fbxl5-containing SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F box) E3 ligase. Fbxl5 interacts with and targets hSSB1 for ubiquitination and degradation, which could be prevented by ATM-mediated hSSB1 T117 phosphorylation. Furthermore, cells overexpression of Fbxl5 abrogated the cellular response to DSBs, including activation of ATM and phosphorylation of ATM targets and exhibited increased radiosensitivity, chemosensitivity and defective checkpoint activation after genotoxic stress stimuli. Moreover, the protein levels of hSSB1 and Fbxl5 showed an inverse correlation in lung cancer cells lines and clinical lung cancer samples. Therefore, Fbxl5 may negatively modulate hSSB1 to regulate DNA damage response, implicating Fbxl5 as a novel, promising therapeutic target for lung cancers.",

They were divided into three groups: mild, moderate and severe thrombocytopenia groups according to the platelet count. rhTPO was subcutaneously administered at a dosage of 300 microg kg(-1) d(-1) until the platelet count >or= 100 x 10(9)/L or absolute value of platelet count >or= 50 x 10(9)/L. Laboratory tests included routine blood count, serum biochemistry, and blood coagulation test.The duration of the chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia was significantly shorter in the mild group than that in the moderate and severe groups (P < 0.01). After administration of rhTPO, the time of declined platelet count beginning to recover was also significantly shorter in the mild group than that in the moderate and severe groups (P < 0.01). There was a statistically significant difference in platelet transfusion needed among the three groups (P < 0.01). However, no significant difference was found among the three groups in the time of rhTPO treatment (P > 0.05) and platelet count improvement (P > 0.05).Recombinant human thrombopoietin can be effectively and safely administered to deal with grade III/IV chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia in lung cancer patients with mild adverse effects.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: To investigate the correlation of the hemoglobin levels with prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Methods: The clinical data from 500 patients with NSCLC who were admitted in the Shanghai Chest Hospital from November 2003 to March 2005 were retrospectively analyzed. Statistical difference was analyzed by \u03c72 test. Survival analysis was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed by COX stepwise regression model. The hemoglobin levels were obtained at the initial visit to the hospital. Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level <120 g/ L in men and <110 g/L in women. Results: The median survival time for all the 500 patients was 27.17 months, 1-year survival rate was 73.4%. Among them, 147 (29.4%) patients had anemia and 353(70.6%) patients without anemia. The incidence of anemia was higher in those patients who received chemotherapy. After the four-cycle chemotherapy, the proportion of patients experiencing anemia was 84.3%. The median survival time was 21.38 months for the patients with anemia and 30.82 months for patients without anemia. The 1-year survival rate was significantly lower in patients with anemia than those without anemia (64.3% vs 76.8%, P = 0.028). Anemia had significant influence on the survival time of female patients (P = 0.049). There was significant difference in the survival time between III stage patients with and without anemia (P = 0.035). Anemia had no significant effect on the survival of NSCLC patients at stages I, II, and IV. The COX stepwise regression analysis showed that anemia, sex, pathological classification, clinical stage, liver function, and surgical resection were independent prognostic factors for the NSCLC patients. Conclusion: Anemia determined by primary diagnosis was related with the survival time of NSCLC patients. Anemia is an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC patients.",

        "abstract": "The large tumour suppressor 1 (LATS1) signalling network has been proved to be an essential regulator within the cell, participating in multiple cellular phenotypes. However, it is unclear concerning the clinical significance of LATS1 and the regulatory mechanisms of 17-Allylamino-17- demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC). The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlation of LATS1 and yes-associated protein (YAP) expression with clinicopathological characteristics in LAC patients, and the effects of 17-AAG on biological behaviours of LAC cells. Subcutaneous LAC tumour models were further established to observe the tumour growth in nude mice. The results showed that the positive expression of LATS1 was significantly lowered (26.7% versus 68.0%, P < 0.001), while that of YAP was elevated (76.0% versus 56.0%, P = 0.03) in LAC tissues compared to the adjacent non-cancerous tissues; LAST1 expression was negatively correlated with YAP expression (r = 0.432, P < 0.001) and lymphatic invasion of the tumour (P = 0.015). In addition, 17-AAG inhibited proliferation and invasion, and induced cell apoptosis and cycle arrest in LAC cells together with increased expression of E-cadherin and p-LATS1, and decreased expression of YAP and connective tissue growth factor. Tumour volumes and weight were much smaller in 17-AAG-treated groups than those in untreated group (P < 0.01). Taken together, our findings indicate that decreased expression of LATS1 is associated with lymphatic invasion of LAC, and 17-AAG suppresses growth and invasion of LAC cells via regulation of the LATS1/YAP pathway in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that we may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human LAC.",

Further we demonstrate that EZH2 inhibits lung cancer cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro and growth in vivo. We found that EZH2 binds to the promoter of Nrf2, where it increases H3K27me3 and represses Nrf2 expression. Finally, Nrf2 seems to be essential for the hyper proliferation of lung cancer cells in the absence of EZH2.",

        "abstract": "The malignancy of esophageal cancer (EC) is largely due to its fast growth and invasion, in which WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling plays a critical role. Hence, suppression of \u03b2-catenin signal transduction in EC cells may inhibit cancer growth and metastases. Among all microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-214 has been shown as a tumor suppressor in many cancers, but has yet studied in EC. Here we found that EC specimens had significant higher levels of \u03b2-catenin, and significantly lower levels of miR-214, compared to paired non-EC tissue. The levels of \u03b2-catenin and miR-214 were inversely correlated in EC specimens. Bioinformatics analyses showed that miR-214 bound to 3'-UTR of \u03b2-catenin mRNA in EC cells to inhibit its translation. Overexpression of miR-214 decreased \u03b2-catenin protein, while depletion of miR-214 increased \u03b2-catenin protein in EC cells, without altering \u03b2-catenin mRNA levels. Overexpression of miR-214 in EC cells inhibited cell growth and invasion, while depletion of miR-214 in EC lines increased cell growth and invasion. Taken together, our data demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for miR-214 in suppression of \u03b2-catenin-mediated EC cell growth and invasion, and highlight miR-214 as a potent suppressor of EC.",

The objectives were to investigate the effects of graded proportions of Laiwu Black genes on carcass and meat quality performance. Results indicated that different consanguinity had significant effect on carcass weight, carcass length (CL), ham percentage (HP) and backfat thickness (BT) (P<0.05), and had highly significant effect on eye muscle area (EMA) and lean percentage (LP) (P<0.01). Furthermore, CL, HP, EMA and LP tended to increased gradually, but BT tended to decreased gradually as Laiwu Black genes decreased. For meat quality properties, different consanguinity had significant effect on meat color, marbling score, dry matter and crude protein content of muscles (P<0.05), and had highly significant effect on water loss, drip loss and intramuscular fat content of muscles (P<0.01). Compared with the muscle of Large Yorkshire, that of Laiwu Black and its crossbred pigs were bright red in meat color, high in water holding capacity and abundant in intramuscular fat. Results implied that to give attention to both quantity and quality, Laiwu Black surely has usable precious value in superior pig production. Commercial crossbred pigs should have about 1/4 of Laiwu Black genes.",

The secretion of FSH and LH is pulsatile during the oestrus and anoestrus,the estrogens and progesterone is wavelike. Furthermore ,the periodicity of FSH pulse during the oestrus is longer than the anoestrus(P<0.05), on the contrary ,the periodicity of LH pulses during the oestrus is shorter(P>0.05). There are four secretory peaks of FSH and LH is found during the oestrus cycle.The 1st secretory peaks of FSH and LH appear on the 7th day and 5th day of the oestrus cycle respectively, other three peaks appear in the same time(The 10 th, 15 th and 20 th day of the oestrus cycle respectively). FSH , LH and E_2 all reach the peak on the 20th day in oestrous cycle. The P appeared the continuously high concentration during the anoestrus.",

The measurements of glass transition temperature of the blend membranes indicate that there exists good molecular miscibility between PES and SPEEK. The PES/SPEEK membranes' water uptake, swelling degree and methanol permeability decrease collectively as PES content increases. Though the proton conductivity of the blend membranes is decreased to a certain extent, their resistance to permeating methanol and swelling property remarkably enhances. This fact confirms that PES/SPEEK can be taken as an appropriate material for preparing solid polyelectrolyte membranes applied in direct methanol fuel cell.",

        "abstract": "A semi-crystalline conjugated polymer based on two electron-deficient units, pentacyclic lactam (PCL) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), was designed and synthesized for application in field-effect transistors (FETs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs). The polymer has a high molecular weight, near-infrared absorption up to 900 nm and good solubility in toluene. When the polymer thin films were solution-processed from toluene with diphenyl ether as an additive, the FET devices achieved a high hole mobility of 0.81 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121. With the same solution-processing solvents, bulk-heterojunction solar cells based on this polymer as an electron donor provided a power conversion efficiency of 4.7% with an optimal energy loss of 0.65 eV due to its deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level. Further study on the morphology of the pure polymer or blend thin films by atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering reveals that the new polymer has good crystalline property, which is mainly due to the coplanar nature of the conjugated backbone. This work demonstrates that conjugated polymers incorporating several electron-deficient units can be potentially used in high performance FETs and PSCs.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we provide systematic studies on the non-fullerene solar cells based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) polymers as electron donors and a well-known electron acceptor ITIC. ITIC has been widely reported in non-fullerene solar cells with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 10%, when it is combined with a wide band gap conjugated polymer, while its application in small band gap DPP polymers has never been reported. Herein, we select four DPP polymers containing different thienyl linkers, resulting in distinct absorption spectra, energy levels and crystalline properties. Non-fullerene solar cells based on DPP polymers as donors and ITIC as an acceptor show PCEs of 1.9-4.1% and energy loss of 0.55-0.82 eV. The PCEs are much lower than those of cells based on fullerene derivatives due to the poor miscibility between the DPP polymers and ITIC, as confirmed by the morphology and charge transport investigation. The results indicate that it is important to tune the miscibility between the donor and acceptor in order to realize optimized micro-phase separation, which can further enhance the performance of DPP polymer based non-fullerene solar cells.",

        "abstract": "In this work, solution-processed organic solar cells with conjugated small molecules both as electron donors and electron acceptors were studied, where the influence of the chemical structures of the donor and acceptor on the device performance was systematically investigated. A small molecular donor incorporating binary electron-deficient units, diketopyrrolopyrrole and pentacyclic aromatic bislactam, was synthesized to provide a low band gap of 1.65 eV and low-lying energy levels. Three molecules, from a fullerene derivative to non-fullerene perylene bisimide-based acceptors, were selected as electron acceptors to construct organic solar cells. The results showed that fullerene-based solar cells provided power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 4.8%, while the non-fullerene solar cells also exhibited promising PCEs of 2.4% and 3.5%, with a photoresponse of up to 750 nm. Further analysis of the bulk-heterojunction systems between donors and acceptors revealed that the relatively low carrier mobilities of the non-fullerene acceptors and the large phase separations are mainly responsible for the less efficient solar cells. Our results demonstrate that molecules containing several electron-deficient units can effectively reduce the band gap of small molecules, and thus offer great potential for realizing high performance fullerene and non-fullerene solar cells.",

Methylated polymers were found to show slightly blue-shift absorption and high-lying energy levels compared to non-methylated polymers. The three polymers also exhibit good crystalline properties and hole mobilities up to 0.57 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 in field-effect transistors. Non-methylated polymers as electron donors in solar cells show an efficiency of 4.2% with a relatively low short circuit current density (Jsc) of 8.3 mA cm\u22122, while methylated polymers exhibit dramastically enhanced Jsc of 12.8 mA cm\u22122 and PCEs up to 6.1%. Micro-phase separation in bulk-heterojunction thin films were systematically investigated, in which methylated polymers in blended thin films were found to provide better micro-phase separation with small crystal domain. The observation can explain their improved photocurrent in solar cells. Our studies demonstrate that by intentionally structural modification, conjugated polymers containing several electron-deficient units can have the great potential application in high performance solar cells.",

A fused conjugated backbone ensures good charge transport, in which the twisted polymer cis-polyPBI was found to show the highest electron mobility of 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22122 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 in field-effect transistors. Meanwhile, a twisted conjugated backbone effectively prevents the aggregation and crystallization of PBI units, resulting in isotropic charge transport and finely tuned micro-phase separation in bulk-heterojunction thin films. The high electron mobility and isotropic crystallinity make the fused and twisted electron acceptors achieve high power conversion efficiencies above 6% in non-fullerene solar cells, while the coplanar molecule trans-PBI as the electron acceptor shows a very low efficiency of 0.13%.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, star-shaped perylene bisimide (PBI) derivatives with spiro-aromatic cores linked with ethynyl units were developed as electron acceptors for non-fullerene organic solar cells. The ethynyl linkers were found to enhance the planarity of the conjugated backbone, resulting in high electron mobilities and near-infrared absorption. The ethynyl-linked PBI acceptors showed high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 4.27% due to the high short-circuit current density ( J  sc ) of 8.52\u00a0mA/cm 2  and fill factor (FF) of 0.59, while the PBI acceptor without ethynyl units provided a low PCE of 3.57% in non-fullerene solar cells. The results demonstrate that ethynyl units can be applied into designing new PBI electron acceptors with improved charge transport properties and photovoltaic performance.",

These acceptors exhibited broad absorption in the range of 300\u2009nm to 800\u2009nm, aligned energy levels and high crystallinity. When combined with a wide band gap donor polymer in non-fullerene solar cells, an initial power conversion efficiency of 2.4% was achieved. The relatively low efficiencies were due to the large phase separation in blended thin films, which is originated from their high aggregation tendency in thin films. Our results suggest that these electron acceptors with unfused core are promising candidates for commercial application of solar cells due to the low cost starting materials and facile synthesis.",

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses reveal that the coating consists of dense NbC grains and small amounts of \u03b1-Fe. The grain size of NbC is 350\u00a0nm on average. Due to the improvement of the microstructure by ultrafine-grained NbC, the hardness and elastic modulus of the coating are 21.1\u00a0GPa and 376.1\u00a0GPa, respectively. The critical load in the micro-scratch test is used as a measure of scratch adhesion. The average value of adhesion strength at the coating/substrate interface is 87.8\u00a0N, at which the NbC coating (thickness of 21.3\u00a0\u03bcm) is delaminated from the substrate. The results indicate that the coating exhibits high adhesion strength on the substrate. The deformation behaviour studied by micro-scratch tests demonstrates that cracks propagate along the grain boundaries and that the failure of the coating is caused by the interaction of radial and lateral cracks.",

The morphology, microstructure, and phase composition of the layer were characterized by means of SEM, TEM, and XRD. The results show fairly agglomerated and uniformly sized (~200 nm) TaC particulates with a face-cantered cubic structure. The values of nano-hardness for the surface and cross section of reinforcing layer can be as high as 29.5 \u00b1 0.6 and 26.7 \u00b1 0.1 GPa, respectively, which were analyzed using a nano-indentation apparatus. Moreover, the scratch resistance of the layer was measured by scratch tests under a progressively increasing load of 0-100 N. A high critical load of 90.4 N is obtained. It is worthy to note that there are only cracking, slight splitting, and small flaking pits (even at the maximum load) all over the whole scratch process, namely the reinforcing layer can protect the iron matrix from serious abrasion effectively. In addition, the excellent scratch resistance and mechanism are discussed in detail.",

Indentation fracture toughness in TaC ceramic layer was determined by the Vickers indentation test for various loads. A Niihara approach was chosen to assess the fracture toughness of TaC ceramic layer under condition of the Palmqvist mode in the experiment. The results reveal that K IC evaluation of TaC ceramic layer by the Vickers indentation method strongly depends on the selection of crack system and K IC equations. The critical indentation load for Vickers crack initiation in TaC ceramic layer lies between 1 and 2 N and the cracks show typical intergranular fracture characteristics. Indentation fracture toughness calculated by the indentation method is independent of the indentation load on the specimen. The fracture toughness of TaC ceramic layer is 6.63 \u00b1 0.34 MPa m1/2, and the toughening mechanism is mainly crack deflection.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Tungsten carbide-reinforced iron-based surface composites were prepared via in situ solid-phase diffusion method; the variables included three temperatures (1085, 1100, and 1125\u00a0\u00b0C) and four heat treatment times (15, 45, 75, and 105\u00a0min). The samples were examined by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Vickers hardness test. Results show that the tungsten carbide-reinforced iron-based surface composites consist of WC, \u03b1-Fe, W, and iron carbide phases, and the thickness of the WC-Fe layer ranges from 20.57\u00b11.24\u00a0\u00b5m to 63.27\u00b12.02\u00a0\u00b5m at 1085\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, the maximum microhardness value of the WC-Fe layer at 1085\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min is 2169 HV 0.1 , whereas that of the iron matrix is 239 HV 0.1 ; such values demonstrate that the hardness of the composites are markedly enhanced. The kinetic of WC-Fe layer was analyzed by measuring the depth of pure WC layer as a function of heat treatment time and temperature. The results show a parabolic relationship between the thickness of pure WC layer and heat treatment time, and the activation energy for the pure WC layer was estimated to be 184.06\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol \u22121 .",

The formation mechanism, microstructure evolution and wear properties of the composite layer were investigated in detail. The results show that the thickness of the composite layer is about 1360\u00a0\u00b5m after the heat treatment at 1175\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h. From the surface to the matrix, the volume fraction of NbC particulates continuously decreases while the average particulate diameter gradually increases from 213\u00a0nm to 1.46\u00a0\u00b5m. Correspondingly, the micro-hardness and relative wear resistance almost gradually decrease from the top surface to the matrix.  In order to discuss the wear mechanism clearly, the composite layer was artificially divided into four regions according to the continuously variation of composition and microstructure. The wear mechanism of NbC particulates high-density zone (region A) is mainly characterized by the intergranular micro-cracks and micro-ploughing. The relative wear resistance of this region is 75 times higher than that of HT300. The wear mechanism of NbC particulates partly gathering zone (region B) is micro-ploughing and part of micro-cutting. NbC particulates dispersing zone (region C) is slight micro-cutting and a small amount broken NbC particulates. And near-matrix zone (region D) is severe micro-cutting with broken and re-embeding NbC particulates in the matrix. And the wear resistance of the four zones is higher than that of matrix.",

The various concentrations (0\u223c14 at.%) of Li ions were applied to investigate the effect of Li+ co-doping concentration on the crystalline structure, microstructure, and emission intensity of GdVO4:Eu3+, Li+ nanophosphors. The results demonstrated that Li+ ion co-doping changes the lattice parameters in two different ways. Moreover, the optical photoluminescent property was obtained when the Li+ co-doping concentration is 10 at.%. The influence of Li+ co-doping on the concentration quenching effect of Eu3+ was discussed as well. The concentration quenching threshold of Eu3+ was increased distinguishably.

        "abstract": "Abstract   A gradient nanostructured surface tantalum carbide (TaC) layer was prepared by a general heat-treatment process on the surface of grey cast iron at 1135\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results reveal that the topmost surface of the layer consists of dense TaC ceramic grains; the average grain size is less than 10\u00a0nm and increases with depth. The chemical composition also presents a gradient distribution. The investigation indicates that the formation of the TaC layer can be attributed to a reaction between tantalum atoms provided by the tantalum plate and carbon atoms supplied by the graphite phase in the substrate. Furthermore, microhardness, elastic modulus and fracture toughness tests have been performed on the TaC layer under nanoindentation mode. The microhardness, in the range of 21.3\u201328.1\u00a0GPa, is 3\u20134 times that of the substrate. The fracture toughness is calculated to be 3.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0MPa\u00a0m 1/2 . The results emphasize that the gradient nanostructured TaC layer improved the comprehensive mechanical properties of the substrate surface by its ultrafine microstructure.",

The hierarchical microspheres consisted of nanoparticles with a uniform coating of amorphous carbon. The thickness of the carbon layer was controlled by the addition of glucose. The hierarchical LiFePO4/C microspheres exhibited a high tap density and a large specific surface area. The electrochemical properties of the sample were investigated. The sample exhibited a better rate capability and a better cyclability than the coral-like LiFePO4/C cathode material, and these were ascribed to the highly uniform carbon coating and the self-assembled nanoparticles.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses reveal that the double-scale structure involves both reinforcement elements of WC particle and W-WC pillar, where the WC-Fe cermet enwraps the metal tungsten wire. The chemical composition of WC-Fe cermet is studied, and the contents of Fe and W elements present a gradient distribution. Moreover, the hardness, elastic modulus and fracture toughness of WC-Fe cermet are evaluated via nanoindentation. The evaluation of toughness is based on the indentation method and the appropriate selection of equation at the same load. The results obtained show that the fracture toughness value is within the range of 4.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.91\u20137.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.02\u00a0MPa\u00a0m 1/2 , which is considerably dependent on the composition. The investigations of crack surface morphologies indicate that radial cracks at the corners of the indentation originate from the crossing of slip bands and that the toughening mechanism is mainly crack deflection, grain bridging and intergranular fracture in the Fe-rich zone.",

The results show that carbide formation that involves W 2 C, WC and a small quantity of Fe 2 W 2 C, is strongly dependent on a diffusion-controlled reaction. During the evolution process of tungsten carbides, W 2 C emerges as an initial phase by the reaction of W and C, and WC is formed as the second phase, because the value of Gibbs free energy of formation of W 2 C is more negative than that of WC at the annealing temperature. The initial W 2 C transforms into WC until complete consumption of the W 2 C. Additionally, Fe 2 W 2 C between W 2 C and WC was formed at a relatively low temperature (1100\u202f\u00b0C and 1125\u202f\u00b0C) with a long annealing time (60\u202fmin). After the W 2 C is consumed completely, WC grows by C diffusion, where the growth kinetics of a dominant WC ceramic exhibits a parabolic growth law before metal tungsten is completely consumed. The growth activation energy of the WC layer is calculated to be achieved with a value of 208.68 kJ/mol. When the metal tungsten is completely consumed after annealing at 1150\u202f\u00b0C for 60\u202fmin, the W 2 C and Fe 2 W 2 C disappear, and only the WC phase exists in the final product.",

When titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) and cast iron contact in atomic scales at high temperatures below the melting point of the cast iron (e.g. 1100\u202f\u00b0C), the interstitial carbon atoms in the cast iron diffuse into titanium alloy forming a TiC layer. Meanwhile, due to the ignorable interdiffusion of metallic atoms, the iron can be easily taken off, leaving a TiC coated titanium alloy. The coating is composed of equiaxed TiC grains and it is completely dense (no porosity). The microstructure is gradient in TiC grain size which increases exponentially from about 100\u202fnm to 1\u202f\u03bcm with depth. The inward growth of the coating is diffusion-controlled, and the coating thickness reaches 23\u202f\u03bcm when annealed for 10\u202fh. The coatings exhibit high hardness (2400 HV 0.05 ) and excellent coating-substrate adhesion strength. This strategy could have a wide application: to grow ceramic coatings on carbide-forming metals by solids having good carbon solubility.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Microstructural characterization of a vanadium carbide (V 2 C and V 8 C 7 ) surface compound layer was performed by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The phase composition and phase distribution of the compound layer and the morphologies, grain sizes and crystallographic orientations of the vanadium carbides were investigated through elemental distribution and crystallographic analyses. The results indicated that the compound layer was composed of four distinct zones consisting of a compact and uniform V 2 C layer (thickness of 3.2\u00a0\u03bcm) over the topmost surface followed by a nonuniform V\u00a0+\u00a0V 2 C (2.4\u202f\u03bcm) zone, a V 8 C 7  layer (10.7\u202f\u03bcm) and a relatively deep V 2 C\u00a0+\u00a0V 8 C 7 + \u03b1 -Fe\u00a0+\u00a0Fe 3 C zone (23.2\u202f\u03bcm). The V 2 C layer was found in the V-rich region, and the EBSD results revealed that this phase grew mainly along the {0001} and {11\u201320} orientations. However, the V 8 C 7  phase appeared to be nearly random, which indicates that the growth of this phase had no specific orientation. The V 2 C and V 8 C 7  phases exhibited low-angle grain boundaries, and their misorientation angle distributions were mainly concentrated within the range of 0\u20135\u00b0. Furthermore, nanoindentation tests demonstrated that the hardnesses of the V 2 C and V 8 C 7  layers were 22.16\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.52 and 32.42\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.61\u202fGPa, respectively. Examination of the vanadium carbide powders obtained by chemical extraction indicated that the V 2 C grains with a hexagonal structure exhibited equiaxial and short rod-like morphologies, and the V 8 C 7  particles with a cubic structure possessed short rod-like and spherical morphologies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A Ti-TiC-Fe cermet composite with a core-shell structure was fabricated by an in situ reaction at high temperature. The TiC-Fe cermet layer was formed at the interface between Ti and the gray cast iron (GCI). The XRD results indicate that the TiC-Fe cermet layer is composed mainly of \u03b1-Fe, Ti, and TiC. The statistical results of the electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) indicate that the grain sizes are between 2 and 17\u202f\u03bcm with the mean value of about 4\u202f\u03bcm. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis results demonstrated that the TiC-Fe cermet layer enwrapped the metallic Ti wire. The size of the TiC particles in the TiC-Fe cermet layer diminished gradually, and the tridimensional morphology varied from dense block to cubes or near-spheroids with the distance from interface of Ti/cermet layer to the interface of cermet layer/GCI. Accordingly, the nano-indentation results showed that the hardness of the TiC-Fe cermet layer decreased gradually with distance from interface of Ti/cermet layer to the interface of cermet layer/GCI, and that the highest hardness value of the TiC-Fe cermet layer is nearly 28.0\u202fGPa. The high hardness and volume fraction of TiC-Fe cermet layer will obviously enhance the wear resistance of composites.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A TiC-Fe surface gradient coating was prepared on the surface of pure titanium by a simple two-step heat-treatment process (1150\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0min\u00a0+\u00a01000\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0h). The phase composition, microstructure, nanoindentation hardness, elastic modulus, fracture toughness, and adhesion strength of the TiC-Fe surface gradient coating were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), nanoindentation testing, and scratch testing. The results reveal that the TiC-Fe surface gradient coating was composed of dense TiC grains and a small amount of \u03b1-Fe. The TiC-Fe surface gradient coating was divided into three zones according to the variation in the volume fractions of TiC particulate and \u03b1-Fe phase. These zones were labeled as follows: a columnar TiC zone (I zone), a large particle TiC zone (II zone) and a large bulk TiC zone (III zone). The formation process and mechanism of the TiC-Fe surface gradient coating include the nucleation growth of TiC grains, followed by diffusion and in situ reactions between titanium and carbon. The nanoindentation hardness and elastic modulus for cross section of the TiC-Fe surface gradient coating ranged from 19.1 to 31.7\u00a0GPa and from 368.1 to 464.3\u00a0GPa, respectively. The fracture toughness values of I zone, II zone and III zone are 3.5, 1.6 and 3.1\u00a0MPa\u00a0m 1/2 , respectively, and these values largely depend on composition and microstructure. Investigations of crack surface morphologies indicate that radial cracks at the corners of the indentation originate from the crossing of slip bands and that the toughening mechanism was mainly crack deflection and bridging. In addition, the scratch testing indicated that the coating exhibited excellent coating/substrate adhesion strength.",

Composites are comprised of a thin compound layer and followed by a deep diffusion zone on the surface of gray cast iron. The graded distributions of the hardness and elastic modulus along the depth direction of the cross section of composites form in the ranges of 6.5-20.1 and 159.3-411.2 GPa, respectively. Meanwhile, dry wear tests for composites were implemented on pin-on-disk equipment at sliding speed of 14.7 \u00d7 10\u22122 m/s and under 5 or 20 N, respectively. The result indicates that tribological performances of composites are considerably dependent on the volume fraction and the grain size of the NbC as well as the mechanical properties of the matrices in different areas. The surface compound layer presents the lowest coefficient of friction and wear rate, and exhibits the highest wear resistance, in comparison with diffusion zone and substrate. Furthermore, the worn morphologies observed reveal the dominant wear mechanism is abrasive wear feature in compound layer and diffusion zone.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Tungsten carbide (WC)-reinforced Fe-based surface composites were prepared by in situ solid-phase diffusion at 1423\u00a0K for 4, 6, and 8\u00a0h. The thermodynamics, phase composition, microstructure, microhardness, and wear-resistance of the Fe\u2013W\u2013C ternary system of the samples were examined by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Vickers hardness test, and wear test, respectively. Thermodynamic calculations showed that the thermodynamically favored products of the Fe\u2013W\u2013C system were W 2 C, WC, and Fe 3 C. W also exhibited a stronger carbide-forming tendency than Fe. The Gibbs free-energies of W 2 C and WC, which were stable carbides, significantly decreased with increased temperature. The main phases of the composite were WC, \u03b3-Fe, Fe 3 C, graphite, and \u03b7-carbide (M 6 C) with fishbone-like morphology. The longitudinal section of the composite could be easily divided into three reaction zones, namely, WC layer, \u201cno graphite area,\u201d and M 6 C-reinforced area. WC particles in the WC layer were irregularly shaped with 0.3\u201312\u00a0\u03bcm particle size, with volume fraction of up to u003e\u00a080%. The average microhardness value of the dense ceramic layer was 2152\u00a0HV 0.1 . The maximum relative wear-resistance, which was 230.4 times higher than that of gray cast iron, was obtained at 20\u00a0N. The high wear-resistance of the composite was due to the in situ formation of dense and hard WC particulates that acted as a reinforcement phase.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Tantalum-tantalum carbide (Ta-TaC) core\u2013shell rod-reinforced iron-based composites were designed and fabricated by  in situ  solid-phase diffusion reaction at 1150\u202f\u00b0C for 5, 10, 15, 20, and 80\u202fmin, respectively. Phase composition, microstructure, impact toughness, micro-hardness, and elastic modulus of the composite, morphologies and grain sizes of TaCs were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, impact test, and nano-indentation test. Furthermore, formation kinetics of TaC-Fe shell layer was analyzed by measuring the thickness of pure TaC layer as a function of heat treatment time and temperature. Results indicated the generation of dense and compact TaC layer around the Ta rod by  in situ  solid-phase diffusion reaction, and together they were designated as the Ta-TaC core\u2013shell rod. Predominant features of the Ta-TaC core\u2013shell rod included a gradient nanostructured TaC-Fe shell layer and a Ta core. Predominant phases of the Ta-TaC core\u2013shell rod-reinforced iron-based composite were Ta, TaC, and \u03b1-Fe phases. Kinetic results of TaC-Fe shell layer exhibited parabolic relationship between the thickness of pure TaC layer and annealing time, and growth rate constant for pure TaC layer was estimated to be 6.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 \u22128 \u202fcm 2 \u202fs \u22121 . TaC particles in TaC-Fe shell layer preferred a perfect cube morphology enclosed by {100} facets with minimized total surface free energy. Grain size of TaC increased gradually from about 150 to 500\u202fnm with the increasing distance from the interface of Ta core/TaC-Fe shell layer to the substrate. The Ta-TaC core\u2013shell rods play an important role in improving the mechanical properties of the composite. Micro-hardness of the TaC-Fe shell layer was in the range of 10.4\u201324.8\u202fGPa, which is 3\u20138 times than that of the substrate due to the dense and compact TaC. Impact toughness of the composite was 100.6\u202fJ\u202fcm \u22122 , which is markedly higher than that of the gray cast iron (7.8\u202fJ\u202fcm \u22122 ). Excellent impact toughness of the composite is mainly attributed to Ta core of Ta-TaC core\u2013shell rod, which undergoes a large plastic deformation under external forces. Moreover, the compact TaC distributed around Ta rod reduced split action to the matrix, and the matrix absorbed large amount of crack propagation energy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To improve the mechanical properties of the surface of iron-based alloys, a tungsten carbide-iron (WC-Fe) cemented carbide layer is produced on an alloy by adopting an isothermal annealing process, which was performed at 1050\u202f\u00b0C for 4\u202fh. By deeply etching the obtained sample, the morphologies of the WC ceramic grains in the WC-Fe hardmetal layer are characterized via scanning electron microscopy. The present results reveal three distinct morphologies consisting of rectangular, triangular prism and multi-layered shapes. Furthermore, the mechanical properties and fracture toughness of the WC-Fe layer are investigated through combined nanoindentation and Vickers indentation techniques. Nanoindentation testing is performed in a load range of 100 to 450\u202fmN. Based on the data collected from the nanoindentation results, the average values of the hardness, Youngu0027 modulus and deformation ratio are evaluated, and the fracture toughness is determined to have a value of 3.08\u202fMPa\u00b7m \u00bd  at 450\u202fmN. In the Vickers indentation technique, however, by identifying the crack type and choosing the appropriate model, the fracture toughness is calculated to be 1.85\u20133.44\u202fMPa\u00b7m \u00bd  at applied loads ranging from 0.98 to 4.9\u202fN. The obtained fracture toughness results exhibit good consistence between the nanoindentation and Vickers indentation methods.",

The microstructures and wear-resistant properties of composites reinforced by both WC particles and the residual tungsten wires were investigated by XRD, SEM, EDS, micro-hardness and pin-on-disc wear measurements. The results show that, with enhancing frequencies of electromagnetic field from 0 to 5 KHz, the amounts of in-situ WC particles increased and of the residual tungsten wires gradually decreased until tungsten wires completely reacted. Due to the higher hardness of in-situ WC p(2100-223IHV0. 1) and the strong interfacial bonding, the composites displayed an excellent wear-resistant properties. When the frequency was 5 kHz, the wear loss for the composite fabricated was optimal and 2. 69 times lower than that of reference samples.",

The effects of different heat treatment times (0, 1, 6 and 11 h) at 1138 \u00b0C on the phase evolution, microstructural features, and properties of the composites were investigated. The as-prepared composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and microhardness and wear resistance tests. The XRD results showed that the composites consisted of graphite, \u03b1-iron and titanium carbide after heat treatment at 1138 \u00b0C for 11 h. The SEM observation revealed that the formed TiC particulates were homogenously distributed in the iron matrix. The average microhardness of the composite heat treated at 1138 \u00b0C for 6 h increased depending upon the region: 209 HV 0.1 (iron matrix) < 787 HV 0.1 (titanium wire) < 2667 HV 0.1 (composite region). After being heat treated at 1138 \u00b0C for 11 h, the composite indicated no considerable change in microhardness value, and the average microhardness of the composite region was about 2354 HV 0.1 . The highest microhardness value obtained for the composite region was due to the formation of titanium carbide particulates as reinforcement phase within the iron matrix. Relative wear resistance was determined by a pin-on-disc wear test technique under different loads, and as a result, the composites containing higher volume fraction of hard titanium carbide particulates presented higher wear resistance compared with the unreinforced gray cast iron. Keywords A. Metal matrix C. Casting E. Wear 1 Introduction A rapid technological development, in turn, demands various kinds of advanced materials with a set of favorable properties that meet the modern requirements. As an advanced material, metal matrix composites (MMCs) reinforced with ceramic particulates have been widely used in numerous applications. Up to date, the iron- and steel-based composites have been produced through the different processes, namely, powder metallurgy, conventional casting, self-propagating high-temperature synthesis, in situ reaction technique, etc. As a single step process, powder metallurgy has however intrinsic limitations for product size, cost and quality. During the last decade, much attention has been paid to the preparation of metal matrix composites by a method that combines powder metallurgy with an in situ reaction technique. This combined method allows eliminating the interface incompatibility of the matrix with the reinforcement phase. A conventional casting is also used in manufacturing of metal matrix composites reinforced by ceramic particulates but the ceramic particulates in the matrix are uneven because of the density difference between the matrix and the reinforcement phase; moreover, the volume fraction of the reinforcement phase is limited. Metal matrix composites reinforced with ceramic particulates can also be produced by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis [1] but they cannot be directly applied as a structural material due to their porosity and looseness. In addition, it is difficult to control the reaction speed during this process. So far, in situ reaction technique has been considered to be one of the most promising methods for the production of metal matrix composites because of the fine size and thermodynamic stability of the ceramic particulates in the matrix as well as a strong interfacial bonding between the matrix and the reinforcement phase, providing higher mechanical properties. The most common carbide ceramic materials employed as reinforcement phases for various iron and steel matrices are TiC, WC, VC, B 4 C, etc. Among them, titanium carbide (TiC) with the Vickers hardness of 2895\u20133200 HV is one of the most suitable reinforcements for the iron and steel matrices because of its availability, high hardness, high melting point, and good thermodynamic stability. The most important is that the TiC reinforcement phase can be chemically wetted by the iron matrix. Recent studies have showed that the wetting angle \u03b8 between the TiC and molten iron is less than 50\u00b0, even at high temperatures and in different atmospheres [2,3] . Till now, several methods have been successfully applied in producing the TiC/Fe composites by a combined in situ technique [4,5] . Feng et al. [6] demonstrated the in situ synthesis of the TiC/Fe composite with low volume fraction of TiC by reaction casting. Li et al. [7] fabricated homogenously distributed TiC particulates with the size of \u223c1 \u03bcm in the iron-based matrix, using ferrotitanium and carbon black powders, by a combined method of spark plasma sintering with an in situ reaction. Wang and Wang [8] also produced the TiC/Fe composite by a process combining powder metallurgy with the in situ reaction technique. Although a number of reports on the in situ synthesis of TiC particulates in the iron matrix, here we present a new process combining an infiltration casting with a subsequent heat treatment for the fabrication of the TiC/Fe composites. The present report mainly emphasizes on the effects of different heat treatment times (0, 1, 6 and 11 h) at 1138 \u00b0C on the phase evolution, microstructural features, and properties of the TiC/Fe composites. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation For the in situ fabrication of titanium carbide particulates-reinforced iron matrix composites, gray cast iron and titanium wires (0.6 mm and 99.99 % purity) were employed as carbon and titanium sources, respectively. The chemical composition of gray cast iron (wt.%) is Fe\u20134.22C\u20130.58Si\u20130.268Mn\u20130.224P\u20130.024S. First, a gray cast iron mold was produced in rectangular shape, and a number of holes were inversely drilled ( \u223c 0.6 mm) on both sides, with a targeted distance of 3 mm between the holes. The titanium wires were parallelly passed through the existing holes on both sides and firmly fixed with the mold, and then the as-prepared mold was inserted into a graphite mold. Molten gray cast iron was produced in a medium-frequency induction furnace and poured into the prepared mold at 1450 \u00b0C. The specimen was immediately covered with quartz sand to avoid the crack generation and cooled down to room temperature naturally. Afterwards, the specimen was cut into the size of 10 mm \u00d7 10 mm \u00d7 25 mm by a numerically-controlled wire-cut EDM machine (Suzhou Nutac Electro Mechanic Co. Ltd., China). An appropriate heating temperature (1138 \u00b0C) of the sectioned sample was chosen considering the partial dissolution temperature of the titanium wire determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The sectioned samples were subjected to heat treatment at 1138 \u00b0C for different dwelling times (0, 1, 6 and 11 h) in a horizontal tube furnace with a modest flow of argon gas and cooled down to room temperature naturally. 2.2 Characterization After being polished with diamond paste and etched with a 4% Nital solution, the microstructures of the as-prepared samples were examined using a JSM-5800 scanning electron microscope (SEM; JEOL, Japan) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using a PW 1730 X-ray diffractometer (Philips, The Netherlands) with monochromated CuK\u03b1 radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA in the 2 \u03b8 range of 10\u201390\u00b0. Microhardness of the specimens was measured by a HDX-1000 digital microhardness tester (Taiming Test Co., China), which consisted of a square-based pyramidal diamond indenter with a 136\u00b0 angle between two opposite faces. The static load applied was 50 g and the dwell time was 15 s. An average value of microhardness was taken from at least five different measurements. To determine an appropriate heating temperature, thermal measurements were performed on a Q600 SDT (TA Instruments, USA) for the specimen, with a 2.0 mm diameter and a 2.6 mm length, prepared from gray cast iron and titanium wire. The as-prepared specimen was heated at 10 \u00b0C/min up to a maximum temperature of 1200 \u00b0C with a 150 ml/min flow rate of argon gas and cooled down to room temperature. For abrasive wear resistance test, cylindrical pin specimens with the diameter of 6 mm and the length of 25 mm were sectioned, and a two-body abrasive wear test was performed on a ML-100 wear test machine (Zhangjiakou Xuan Ke Testing Machine Manufacturing Co. Ltd., China). The pin specimens were loaded against a rotating disc (25 rpm) covered with a 500 mesh alumina abrasive paper under the load of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 N. To ensure fresh supply of abrasive particles to the pin specimens, the worn alumina abrasive paper was replaced with the new one for every sliding distance of 20 m. The wear resistance test was repeated at least three times for each sample, and the weight losses of the pin specimens were measured in an electronic balance with an accuracy of 0.0001 g. Relative wear resistance \u03b2 is used to evaluate the abrasive wear properties of the as-prepared composites, which can be obtained through the following process: (1) \u0394 V = \u0394 m \u03c1 where \u0394 V is the abrasive volume, \u0394 m is the weight loss after abrasion, and \u03c1 is the density of the testing material. (2) \u03b2 = \u0394 V r \u0394 V c where \u03b2 is the relative wear resistance, \u0394 V r is the abrasive volume of reference gray cast iron sample, and \u0394 V c is the abrasive volume of TiC particulates-reinforced iron matrix composites. 3 Results and discussion The thermal behavior of the specimen manufactured from gray cast iron and titanium wire is shown in Fig. 1 a. In the DSC curve, there are two endothermic peaks with relatively higher intensities centered at 755 \u00b0C and 1061 \u00b0C, two endothermic peaks with relatively lower intensities centered at 1121 \u00b0C and 1132 \u00b0C, and one exothermic peak centered at 1138 \u00b0C. According to the phase diagrams shown in Fig. 1b and c , the transformation of \u03b1-Fe to \u03b3-Fe is observed as the first endothermic peak at 755 \u00b0C [9] , and the second endothermic peak at 1061 \u00b0C is due to the formation of the eutectic composition of titanium and iron [10] . The third (1121 \u00b0C) and fourth (1132 \u00b0C) endothermic peaks are associated with the melting of iron matrix and a partial dissolution of the titanium wire, respectively. The exothermic peak at 1138 \u00b0C is probably attributed to the formation of a new phase (TiC), resulted from the reaction between the carbon from gray cast iron and the titanium from the titanium wire [11] . From the thermal analysis of the specimen, it is found that the melting of the iron matrix and a partial dissolution of the titanium wire can be favored at 1138 \u00b0C. Therefore, the sectioned specimens are further heat treated at 1138 \u00b0C for different dwelling times (0, 1, 6 and 11 h) in the presence of argon gas. The SEM micrographs of the heat-treated samples are displayed in Fig. 2 as a function of heat treatment time. As can be seen in Fig. 2a\u2013d , the diffusion region in the composite gradually increases with an increase in heat treatment time from 0 to 11 h, and the diameter of the metallic titanium wire contracts and eventually disappears. After being heat treated at 1138 \u00b0C for 6 h, the composite region in the specimen can be readily divided into three apparent zones, as clearly discriminated in Fig. 2 c: inner (titanium wire), outer (iron matrix), and intermediate (diffusion region). It is obvious from Fig. 2 d that the titanium wires were completely melted after the heat treatment of the specimen at 1138 \u00b0C for 11 h, and more titanium atoms were diffused into the iron matrix that promoted the in situ formation of the titanium carbide particulates in the iron matrix. The XRD patterns of the titanium carbide particulates-reinforced iron matrix composites are represented in Fig. 3 as a function of heat treatment time. The XRD results confirm the presence of graphite (JCPDS card No. 26-1079), \u03b1-iron (JCPDS card No. 06-696), titanium carbide (JCPDS card No. 65-0971), and metallic titanium (JCPDS card No. 51-0631) in the samples heat treated at 1138 \u00b0C for 0 h, 1 h, and 6 h as predominant phases. In contrast, the XRD pattern of the sample heat treated at 1138 \u00b0C for 11 h shows no peak corresponding to the metallic titanium. By prolonging heat treatment time from 0 h to 11 h, the intensities of the graphite and the metallic titanium peaks decrease with the increase in the intensities of the newly-formed titanium carbide peaks. An abrupt disappearance of the diffraction peak of the metallic titanium after heat treatment at 1138 \u00b0C for 11 h proves that the titanium atoms were fully consumed for the reaction with graphite in the iron matrix; however, a little amount of unreacted graphite is still present. The titanium carbide particulates-reinforced iron matrix composites can be obtained under the current conditions along with the traces of unconsumed graphite. It is evident from Fig. 2 d that the titanium wires melted and reacted completely after heat treatment of the specimen at 1138 \u00b0C for 11 h, and so the titanium atoms were evenly diffused into the iron matrix, which could facilitate the formation of homogenously distributed titanium carbide particulates. The reaction region can be readily differentiated from the iron matrix with a circle zone, consisting of the in situ synthesized titanium carbide, which is incorporated with the iron matrix. Fig. 4 exhibits low and high magnification SEM images of that reaction region. As can be seen, the reaction region mainly contains interconnected TiC particulates with irregular shape, and the particulates with the size of 2\u20135 \u03bcm are uniformly distributed within the iron matrix. To improve mechanical properties, Han and Kong [12] prepared TiC-based cermet with a core/rim structure by spark plasma sintering, with the addition of TiN nanoparticles. The core consisted of TiC ceramic particulates with the size of <2 \u03bcm surrounded by a rim which was a solid solution of (Ti, W, Mo)C. They also pointed out that the growth rate of Ti(C, N) was slower than that of TiC due to the stabilization of TiC phase in the nitrogen environment [13] . Similar microstructure was observed for austenitic stainless steel reinforced with 5 vol.% TiC particulates with the size of 2\u201310 \u03bcm and polygonal morphology [14] . It was noted that the introduction of TiC particulates into the matrix by in situ reaction inhibited the contamination of the interphase boundaries between TiC particulates and the \u03b3-Fe grains. Hui et al. [15] fabricated TiC particulate reinforced Fe\u2013Cr\u2013Ni matrix composites by a liquid state in situ synthesis. Spherical and polyhedral TiC particulates with the size of 0.5\u20133 \u03bcm were uniformly dispersed in austenite matrix. The interface between TiC and austenite in the composite was a coherent interface with the orientation relationship of ( 0 2 \u00af 0 ) \u03bb / / ( 2 2 \u00af 0 ) TiC , [ 001 ] \u03bb | | [ 001 ] TiC . According to the results from an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), the molar ratio of Ti:C calculated from the EDS spectrum is 1:1.04, which is close to 1:1, giving a possible composition of TiC. These results are in good agreement with the XRD data. The thermodynamics of in situ chemical reactions between the molten iron and the titanium was also studied in this work. According to the standard thermodynamic calculations [16,17] , the following reactions might possibly occur during the fabrication of the TiC particulates-reinforced iron matrix composites: (3) Ti + C = TiC \u0394 G 1 = - 181.251 + 0.013 T ( 25 \u2013 1670 \u00b0 C ) (4) 3 Fe + C = Fe 3 C \u0394 G 2 = 17.984 - 0.019 T ( 727 \u2013 1727 \u00b0 C ) (5) Fe + Ti = FeTi \u0394 G 3 = - 41.261 + 0.012 T ( 727 \u2013 1727 \u00b0 C ) (6) 2 Fe + Ti = Fe 2 Ti \u0394 G 4 = - 90.885 + 0.027 T ( 727 \u2013 1727 \u00b0 C ) In order to confirm these reactions, the Gibbs free energies for TiC, Fe 3 C, FeTi, and Fe 2 Ti are calculated and plotted in Fig. 5 as a function of temperature. It can be noted that the Gibbs free energies indicate the negative values above 1138 \u00b0C, implying the occurrence of the above-listed reactions. At the reaction temperature of 1138 \u00b0C, \u0394G 2 is, however, slightly negative with the value of \u22123.64 kJ mol \u22121 . That means Fe 3 C is not a thermodynamically-favored product. On the contrary, the value of \u0394G 1 is the highest one, presenting TiC to be the most stable product among them. Because the TiC phase started forming when the alloy had not solidified yet, while Fe 3 C, FeTi, and Fe 2 Ti phases precipitated only in the processes of solidification and cooling. So, higher temperature and longer treatment time promoted the dissolution of metallic titanium that further reacted with the carbon atoms to form titanium carbide particles in the iron matrix. On the other hand, higher temperature improved the wettability between liquid phase and TiC reinforcement, which intensified the dissolution-precipitation of TiC particulates. The microhardness distribution in the composites heat treated at 1138 \u00b0C for 6 h and 11 h is plotted in Fig. 6 as a function of a distance away from the center of the titanium wire. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the highest microhardness value is about 3085 HV 0.1 in the diffusion reaction region (i.e. composite region) after heat treatment of the sample at 1138 \u00b0C for 6 h. This is thought to be due mainly to the formation of intensive TiC particulates in this region. The average microhardness of the three main regions can be placed in the following order: 209 HV 0.1 (iron matrix) < 787 HV 0.1 (titanium wire) < 2667 HV 0.1 (composite region). As mentioned before, there is no metallic titanium wire remaining in the center of the reinforcement phase after heat treatment of the sample at 1138 \u00b0C for 11 h. Therefore, the microhardness values for the titanium wire do not appear separately in Fig. 6 b. It is worth to mention that with increasing heat treatment time from 6 h to 11 h, the microhardness values of the composite region do not change considerably. The average microhardness value of the composite region in the specimen heat treated at 1138 \u00b0C for 11 h is about 2354 HV 0.1 , which is twelve times higher than that of the iron matrix and slightly lower than that of the composite heat treated at 1138 \u00b0C for 6 h. The relative wear resistance of gray cast iron and specimens heat treated at 1138 \u00b0C for 6 h and 11 h are comparatively shown in Fig. 7 as a function of applied load. The specimens after heat treatment at 1138 \u00b0C for 6 h and 11 h possess wear resistance which is much higher than that of gray cast iron under a 5 N load. That is, the specimen heat treated at 1138 \u00b0C for 6 h shows relative wear resistance of 12.1 and the specimen heat treated at 1138 \u00b0C for 11 h shows relative wear resistance of 14.5, while gray cast iron has relative wear resistance of 1. It can be concluded that the TiC particulates formed in situ play an important role in improvement of mechanical properties of the composites; particularly, they reinforce the iron matrix significantly and protect it from a serious abrasion. It is known that the wear property is normally affected by the ratio of hardness of abrasive material and hardness of the composite material [18,19] . When the ratio is less than 0.80, the abrasion of material is very small, and the abrasion of material is quite high when it is more than 1.25 [20] . The microhardness values of the TiC reinforcement and Al 2 O 3 abrasive paper are 3200 HV and 2600 HV, respectively, and the ratio is nearly 0.81. According to Richardson theory [21] , the abrasion of the as-prepared composites is very small. The wear morphologies of gray cast iron and specimens heat treated at 1138 \u00b0C for 6 h and 11 h under a 5 N load are shown in Fig. 8 . Probably, these are the results of the combined effects of microcutting and microploughing. As Sun et al. [22] reported, the wear mechanisms of the TiCp/Fe composites appear as microcutting and microploughing, and partly microcracking. Due to less structural defects, microcracking in the as-prepared composites cannot be easily observed. In addition, microcutting and microploughing are normally the dominant interactions in more ductile materials. They are connected with high deformation of the surface worn. In general, the existence of microcracks is closely related to the formation of spalling pits. When the stress concentration at the interface between the reinforcement and the matrix reaches a certain value, a microcrack will be nucleated and with the growth of the microcracks, the TiC reinforcement particle would spall off and leave a spalling pit on the surface [22] . Moreover, when the abrasive particles fracture, it tends to generate fresh sharp cutting edge, increasing particle angularity [23] . An increasing particle angularity favors the more damaging microcutting abrasion mechanism over the less damaging microploughing mechanism. Hence, high-stress abrasion occurs when the sharp-edge small abrasive particles scratch the surface [24] . As demonstrated by Zum Gahr [20] , the ration of depth penetration allows distinguishing between different abrasive mechanisms, i.e. microcutting and microploughing. It is also visible that each specimen possesses grooves but the grooves in the specimens heat treated at 1138 \u00b0C for 6 h and 11 h are much narrower and shallower compared to those in gray cast iron. This is attributed to the formation of TiC reinforcement phase in the iron matrix which blocks the abrasion paths during the wear test. Due to the difference in microhardness and wear resistance values, the difference in the grooves in the two composite specimens is still noticeable. It can be summarized that the relative wear resistance of the specimen heat treated at 1138 \u00b0C for 6 h is less than that of the specimen heat treated at 1138 \u00b0C for 11 h. 4 Conclusions Titanium carbide (TiC) particulates-reinforced iron matrix composites were in situ fabricated by a combined method of infiltration casting and a subsequent heat treatment. The effects of different heat treatment times (0, 1, 6 and 11 h) at 1138 \u00b0C on the phase evolution, microstructural features, and properties of the composites were investigated. The XRD results showed that the composites consisted of graphite, \u03b1-iron and titanium carbide after heat treatment at 1138 \u00b0C for 11 h. The SEM observation revealed that the formed TiC particulates were homogenously distributed in the iron matrix. The average microhardness value of the composite heat treated at 1138 \u00b0C for 6 h increased depending upon the region: 209 HV 0.1 (iron matrix) < 787 HV 0.1 (titanium wire) < 2667 HV 0.1 (composite region). After being heat treated at 1138 \u00b0C for 11 h, the composite indicated a slight change in microhardness value, and the average microhardness value of the composite region was about 2354 HV 0.1 . The highest microhardness value obtained in the composite region was due to the formation of hard titanium carbide particulates as reinforcement phase within the iron matrix. Relative wear resistance was determined by a pin-on-disc wear test technique, and as a result, the composites containing higher volume fraction of hard titanium carbide particulates presented higher wear resistance compared with the unreinforced gray cast iron.

The NbC particles in the reinforcement phase were synthesized in situ through the reaction between niobium from niobium wires and carbon from the graphite phases produced by the heat treatment in gray cast iron. The microstructure and wear-resistance of the bulk niobium particle-reinforced iron matrix composite was studied at different NbC particle volume fractions (8, 15, 22, and 28 vol%), by scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, and a wear tester. The NbC particles were observed to form tiny cuboids and nearly spherical particles which were evenly distributed in the matrix. The particle size of the NbC reinforcement was about 0.3-3.5 \u03bcm. The relative wear resistance of the bulk composite increased with increasing NbC volume fraction, and the wear resistance of the composite was 5.9-fold higher than that of the gray cast iron under a 20N load and at a 28 vol% volume fraction. Wear performance of the composite at different NbC particle volume fraction values was also analyzed. \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",

        "abstract": "In this work, a novel process that combines infiltration casting with subsequent heat treatment was applied to fabricate in situ vanadium carbide (V 8C 7) ceramic particulates-reinforced iron matrix composites. Based on the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data, the as-cast samples were subjected to heat treatment at 1164 \u00b0C for different dwelling times (0, 10, 15, and 20 min). The effects of different heat treatment times on the phase evolution, microstructure, and microhardness of the as-prepared composites were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), and Vickers hardness tester, respectively. The experimental results revealed that only graphite, \u03b1-Fe, and V 8C 7 phases dominate in the composite samples after heat treatment at 1164 \u00b0C for 20 min. The average microhardness of the as-prepared composites varied among the different regions as follows: 458 HV 0.05 (vanadium wire), 1055 HV 0.05 (composite area), and 235 HV 0.05 (iron matrix). The microhardness of the composite region is four times higher than that of the iron matrix and two times higher than that of the vanadium wire because of the formation of the vanadium carbide phases (V 2C and V 8C 7) as reinforcement within the iron matrix. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",

The sample was isothermal-ly kept in vacuum tube furnace at 1 138\u00b0C for 8 h, and cooled in furnace to room temperature. TiC particulates reinforced surface gradient composite was prepared on the iron matrix of cast i-ron surface by the in-situ technology. Microstructure analysis, microhardness and wear-resistance test were carried out on the recombination region. The experimental results show that the TiC particulates reinforced surface gradient composite is composed of three layers. The difference between the three layers lies in the different sizes and different shapes of TiC particulates. The microhardness decreases gradually from composite layer (C region) to pearlite region. The maximum microhardness appears in the high density ceramic layer (C region). Therefore, wear experiment was further performed to study wear-resistance of the high density ceramic layer of the surface gradient composite. Apparently, the wear-resistance of high density ceramic layer is enhanced greatly in comparison with gray cast iron.",

The microstructure and wear-resistance of NbC particulate-reinforced iron matrix composites were studied using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and wear testing. The results indicate that at 1172 \u00b0C for 3 hours NbC particulate-reinforced iron matrix composites were fabricated, and the size of NbC reinforcement was 0.3-3.5 \u03bcm. The relative wear resistance of the composites was 5.4 times higher than that of gray cast iron under a 20 N load. This was achieved at 22 % NbC volume fraction. Wear of the composites manifests as grooves, broken carbide particulates and some micro-cracks. \u00a9 (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

The microstructure and wear-resistance of the tungsten carbide bundles reinforced iron matrix composites were studied by using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and wear tester. Results showed that the tungsten carbide bundles distributed in the matrix with the center-to-center spacing 2.2 mm, and the diameter of each tungsten carbide bundle is about 1 mm. Most of the tungsten carbides agglomerated, but still there were tungsten carbide particles and the size of tungsten carbide particle was about 10 - 15 \u03bcm. The weight loss of the tungsten carbides bundle reinforced iron matrix composites increased with the increase of the loads and the weight loss of the composites is much less than those of the gray cast iron under the same condition.

To investigate the influences of sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) and pH on the morphology and luminescent properties of GdVO 4:Eu3+ phosphors, different amounts of SDS were added in the hydrothermal reaction system under various pH values. The structures and morphologies of the final products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Several interesting morphologies of GdVO4:Eu 3+ powders were obtained, including tetragonal, octahedron, rod-like, and dendritic. The results indicated that the pH determines the nucleation rate of GdVO4:Eu3+ crystals in the solution, and the SDS affects the crystal growth pattern by changing growth direction and forming micelles. Moreover, possible mechanisms for morphological evolution are also presented. The photoluminescent (PL) properties of the products were also characterized. All the samples exhibited the characteristic fluorescence of Eu3+ ion. In addition, the intensities of excitation and emission spectra varied with the morphological change. The product with nanocrystal morphology showed the strongest PL intensity among all the samples with different morphologies. Besides, the PL property was enhanced with good crystalline state, but weakened by serious aggregation. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The as-synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The obtained results showed that the pH value of synthesis solution played a key role in the formation of final products with different morphologies, such as, microspheres, irregular microspheres with grain-like nanoparticles, stone-like structures with regular short nanorods, and smooth rhombohedrons. The PL measurements revealed that the emission intensity of the samples was first decreased, and then increased with increasing the pH value due mainly to the increase in crystallinity and decrease in surface defects.

        "abstract": "Spherical YVO 4 :Eu 3+ microstructures were hydrothermally synthesized by the reaction of NH 4 VO 3 , Y 2 O 3 , and Eu 2 O 3 at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h with the assistance of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a surfactant. The resulting products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The experimental results showed that ball-like YVO 4 :Eu 3+ microspheres with a diameter of about 4\u20135 \u03bcm, corresponding to the SEM observations, formed at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h using 0.2 g PVP with the molecular weight of 20,000 g mol \u22121 . The amount of PVP and the reaction time of hydrothermal processing were found to play a key role in the formation of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ microspheres. It has been observed that the relative luminescence intensities of the as-synthesized samples increased with increasing hydrothermal reaction times due mainly to the increase of crystallinity. Keywords Microspheres Optical material Photoluminescence spectroscopy 1 Introduction Spherical nanostructures and microstructures, including hollow and plain spheres, have been intensively studied owing to their unique properties derived from their specific morphologies. In general, a spherically well-dispersed morphology is an important factor for low-light scattering at the surfaces and high-packing densities [1,2] . Moreover, the assembling of low-dimensional particles to form a well-dispersed sphere is a key step towards controlling the collective properties of the particles, which are essential in the fabrication of 2D- and/or 3D-arrayed photonic crystals, nano- and micro-electronic devices, optics, catalysis, sensors, etc. Recently, several research groups have succeeded in developing nanocrystals with a high degree of dispersity and size uniformity. It was found that well-dispersed semiconductors having narrow size distribution and specific morphologies often show considerable optical and electrical properties. An important optical material, yttrium orthovanadate (YVO 4 ) can be applied in various devices involving the artificial production of light and display fields, such as an excellent polarizer [3,4] and a laser host material [5,6] due to its exceptional characteristics such as excellent thermal, mechanical and optical properties. In particular, Eu 3+ -doped YVO 4 has been extensively used as a red-emitting phosphor in color television and cathode ray tubes (CRTs) because of its high luminescence efficiency upon electron-beam excitation [7,8] . In recent years, research has been focused on the processing methods of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ , such as conventional solid-state [9] , hydrothermal [10\u201313] , hydrolyzed colloidal reaction [14] , and precipitation [15] . Compared with the other methods, the synthesis of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ powder through a hydrothermal route offers several advantages, e.g., high purity, narrow particle size distribution, and precise composition; in addition, this method does not require further heat treatment at high temperatures. Morphology and size of the particles can also be tailored via the hydrothermal processing by adjusting the source species, reaction temperature, reaction time, etc. In sum, this method of synthesizing inorganic materials with specific morphologies seems to be the most promising. A variety of surfactants have been widely used in hydrothermal synthesis to control the chemistry of the process, lowering processing temperatures, reducing surface tension, and regulating nucleation and crystal growth. Wu et al. [16] have successfully prepared the rod-like, olive-like, and pineapple-like nanocrystals of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ under hydrothermal conditions using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (C 19 H 42 BrN) as a surfactant. Recently, Chen et al. [17] reported that the morphology of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ nanocrystallites can be controlled by varying the pH value (8\u201314) in the basic solution and increasing luminescence intensity from bundle-like to rice-like to rhombus-like nanocrystals. However, the irregularity and agglomeration of particles still remain a challenging topic. In this paper, we describe a facile route to synthesize YVO 4 :Eu 3+ microspheres by the self-aggregation/assembling of low-dimensional particles under hydrothermal conditions at temperatures as low as 180 \u00b0C for 24 h using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a nonionic surfactant. The influences of the PVP amounts and hydrothermal reaction times on the morphology and luminescent properties of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ microspheres were investigated in detail. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of Y 0.95 Eu 0.05 VO 4 microspheres Y 0.95 Eu 0.05 VO 4 microspheres were fabricated via a surfactant-assisted hydrothermal method. All chemical reagents were analytical grade and purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagents Company (China), and used without further purification. Typically, the stoichiometric amounts of Y 2 O 3 , Eu 2 O 3 , and NH 4 VO 3 were dissolved in 25 mL HNO 3 (1 mol L \u22121 ). An appropriate amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was introduced into the solution as a nonionic complex agent and stirred for 10 min to form a yellow-colored mixture. The pH of the resulting solution was adjusted to \u223c1 by a drop-wise addition of sodium hydroxide solution under vigorous stirring. The well-stirred mixture thus obtained was then transferred a 40 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a filling capacity of 70%. The autoclave was sealed and subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 180 \u00b0C for reaction times of 6, 12 and 24 h. As the autoclave naturally cooled down to room temperature, the resulting precipitate was filtered, washed with distilled water several times, and then dried in a vacuum at 80 \u00b0C for 10 h. 2.2 Characterization The phase identification of the as-prepared powders was carried out by X-ray powder diffraction (Model D/MAX 2550 V, Rigaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) with monochromated Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5) at 40 kV and 50 mA. The morphology and crystalline size of the as-synthesized samples were observed using a scanning electron microscopy (FEI Quanta 200 ESEM, The Netherlands). The excitation and emission photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a Perkin-Elmer LS55 fluorescence spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Shelton, USA). 3 Results and discussion According to Ropp and Carroll [18] , the form of vanadium ions is extremely sensitive to the pH of the solution, and the vanadium ions exist as VO 2 + when the solution is strongly acidic. When the pH rises to 2, vanadium ions exist principally in the form of V 10 O 28 6\u2212 ; when the pH further increases to 5, vanadium ions are likely to appear in the form of V 3 O 9 3\u2212 . VO 4 3\u2212 exists in the solution when the pH value is >7. In our case, since the pH of the solution is 1, the following reactions may occur: Y 2 O 3 + E u 2 O 3 + HN O 3 \u2192 Y ( N O 3 ) 3 + Eu ( N O 3 ) 3 + H 2 O V O 2 + + E u 3 + + Y 3 + \u27f6 hydrothermal \u2009 process YV O 4 : E u 3 + ( pH \u2009 1 ) The XRD patterns of the final products synthesized using PVP with different molecular weights (10,000 and 20000 g mol \u22121 ) at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h are shown in Fig. 1 . The XRD patterns of the samples can be readily indexed to YVO 4 , having a zirconia-type tetragonal structure (JCPDS Card No.17-0341). This confirms that a pure phase YVO 4 :Eu 3+ can be prepared by a simple hydrothermal method at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h using PVP with different molecular weights. The SEM images of the products obtained at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h using PVP with different molecular weights are illustrated in Fig. 2 which shows that YVO 4 :Eu 3+ microspheres with a fewer twinning spheres were formed under the current conditions. Apparently, the product with large-scale uniform ball-like microspheres shows a regular morphology and a good crystalline state with a diameter in the range of 4\u20135 \u03bcm ( Fig. 2 b). The SEM observation recommends the use of PVP with molecular weight of 20,000 g mol \u22121 for further experiments due to its favorable characteristics. Fig. 3 presents XRD patterns of the products obtained at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h using PVP with the amounts of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4. All XRD patterns can be readily indexed as a zirconia-type tetragonal structure, approaching the standard values for the bulk YVO 4 (JCPDS Card No. 17-0341). The SEM micrographs of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ phosphors obtained at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h using PVP with the amounts of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 g are displayed in Fig. 4 which shows that all samples have a plain spherical morphology with a submicrometer size. Fig. 4 a shows a SEM image of the as-synthesized samples with 0.1 g PVP. Visually, the samples are irregular microspheres comprised of several small particles tending to agglomeration. By increasing the amount of PVP to 0.2 g, large-scale uniform ball-like microspheres with smooth surfaces ( Fig. 4 b) were formed. The particles have an average size of about 4\u20135 \u03bcm in diameter. The surface of the phosphors is very smooth, which is very important to obtain a high efficiency. A smooth, defect-free phosphor surface can decrease the non-radiation and scattering that result from a coarse surface and can also increase the luminescence efficiency. Further increase in the amount of PVP to 0.4 g resulted in longitudinal growth and increasing aspect ratio. A large number of cobblestone-like YVO 4 :Eu 3+ powders including irregular particles were formed with an average aspect ratio of about 1.5 and a diameter of 2\u20133 \u03bcm ( Fig. 4 c). Therefore, on the basis of the SEM results, it can be concluded that varying the amount of PVP in the growth solution is a crucial step to control the morphology of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ . A 0.2 g PVP was found to be optimal for obtaining the pure ball-like YVO 4 :Eu 3+ microspheres with a uniform diameter of about 4\u20135 \u03bcm due to homogeneous precipitation. It is well known that the addition of a complex agent can affect the nucleation and crystal growth, which consequently modifies particle morphology and size. A strong ligand is used not only to form a stable complex with Y 3+ , but also to bind to the surface of the crystal, which directly affects the growth direction and crystal structure. Here, homogeneous precipitation is a type of hydrothermal precipitation method that has been widely used to synthesize nanomaterials with superior homogeneity and particle size uniformity [19\u201322] . This homogeneous precipitation method can also be used to prepare spherical particles [23,24] . In this paper, when the amount of PVP was 0.1 g, the homogeneous precipitation was complete, but the nucleus growing into spherical particles was incomplete due to the lesser amount of PVP. By increasing the amount of PVP to 0.2 g, the nucleus grows into large spherical particles that can be ultimately crystallized thereby resulting in the formation of very fine spherical crystals. This result may indicate that the homogeneous precipitation is active due to the simultaneous adhesion of water and PVP, dissolving, and reprecipitating to yield well-dispersed particles. When the amount of PVP was 0.4 g, there were fewer homogeneous nuclei because of the excessive unreacted amount of PVP. When this mixture was hydrothermally processed under certain pressure and temperature, the excessive PVP acted as a soft template, so cobblestone-like phosphors were obtained. The effect of the hydrothermal reaction time, or so-called crystallizing time, on the morphology and phase composition of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ was also investigated. Fig. 5 shows typical XRD patterns of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ hydrothermally synthesized at 180 \u00b0C for the reaction times of 6, 12 and 24 h. All XRD patterns can be readily indexed to a zirconia-type tetragonal structure with lattice constants comparable to the values given in JCPDS 17-0341; no traces of other phases could be detected. The results show that pure phase YVO 4 :Eu 3+ can be obtained under hydrothermal treatment at 180 \u00b0C for 6 h and the diffraction intensities of the samples increase with an increasing hydrothermal reaction time up to 24 h which means the samples become a highly crystallized with a longer reaction time. Fig. 6 shows the SEM micrographs of the YVO 4 :Eu 3+ powders hydrothermally synthesized at 180 \u00b0C for the reaction times of 6, 12 and 24 h. Apparently, the hydrothermal reaction time has a significant impact on the morphology of the as-synthesized products. A better crystalline state was obtained with a longer hydrothermal reaction time. The morphology of samples prepared at 180 \u00b0C for 6 h ( Fig. 6 a) is spherical with irregular particles and a fewer twinning spheres. Spherical particles with a size of several hundred nanometers could be found, but the edge was not clear. With the hydrothermal reaction time of 12 h ( Fig. 6 b), a regular structure appeared, but the microspheres were still not uniform and smooth which means that an improvement of crystallinity is required. When the hydrothermal reaction time reached 24 h, the samples showed a regular shape of a particle with smooth surface. The SEM results indicate that a hydrothermal reaction time of 24 h is the optimum under the current conditions. The reason for the formation of spherical phosphors with a regular shape and smooth surface may be attributed to the homogeneous precipitation process in the first step and to the homogeneous nucleation and growth in the aging process with an appropriate amount of PVP. The PL spectra of the products were measured using a fluorescence spectrometer at room temperature. Fig. 7 shows PL excitation spectra of the Y 0.95 Eu 0.05 VO 4 samples synthesized at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h with different amounts of PVP (0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 g) under the emission of 618 nm. All the excitation spectra are approximately identical and consist of a broad band ranging from 200 to 350 nm with a maximum peak at about 303 nm and some weak lines in the longer wavelength region. This result can be attributed to the absorption of the VO 4 3\u2212 group and the latter to the f\u2013f transitions within the Eu 3+ 4f 6 configuration. The excitation spectrum with the highest intensity was obtained for the samples with 0.2 g PVP. Similarly, YVO 4 :Eu 3+ powders prepared with different hydrothermal reaction times (6, 12, and 24 h) show a broad absorption bands in the range of 200\u2013350 nm with a maximum peak at about 303 nm due to the absorption of the VO 4 3\u2212 group ( Fig. 8 ). In the longer wavelength (350\u2013500 nm), the weak bands also confirm the f\u2013f transitions of Eu 3+ ions. The PL emission spectra of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ samples synthesized with different amounts of PVP (0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 g) under the excitation of 303 nm are represented in Fig. 9 . The spectra composed of sharp lines ranging from 500 to 700 nm are associated with the transitions from the excited 5 D 0 level to 7 F J ( J = 1, 2, 3) levels of Eu 3+ activators. The emission bands around 590 nm could be ascribed to the 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 1 magnetic dipole transitions; the weak peak at 538.5 nm is related to the transition from 5 D 1 to 7 F 1 . Meanwhile, the emission peaks located at about 618 nm are mainly due to the transitions from a 5 D 0 to 7 F 2 energy level. The 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 transition is a forced electronic dipole\u2013dipole transition and hypersensitive to the environment. Their high intensities are a consequence of the absence of an inversion symmetry at the Eu 3+ lattice site ( D 2d symmetry) [16,19] . Here, the solid samples of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ hydrothermally synthesized are optical material. It is reasonable to compare luminescence intensities for YVO 4 :Eu 3+ samples. Many published papers have detailed discussions about solid optical materials; for example, Zhou and Lin [25] and Yan and Su [26] have fabricated different solid samples and compared their luminescent characteristics. The emission intensity of the peaks increased gradually when the morphology changed from irregular microspheres to uniform microspheres. We attribute this intensity change of the predominant peak to the distinct microstructure of these microspheres. Irregular and cobblestone-like microspheres possess a larger surface area and higher surface energy, which not only form the main impetus for assembly, but also result in a higher degree of disorder and corresponding lower symmetry of crystal fields around the Eu 3+ ions. It is known that the 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 transition is highly sensitive to structural change and environmental effects. The difference of the 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 emission peak in relative intensity is due to the difference in the effects of the crystal field perturbation on the individual f\u2013f transitions. On the other hand, as the samples were prepared in water, the surface of the YVO 4 may be covered with hydroxyl species, which act as efficient quenchers of the excited Eu 3+ ions. The absorption between quenching species and crystal surfaces is affected by the sizes and shapes of YVO 4 , so the differences in the PL intensity of the samples may be attributed to the different quenching abilities of the adsorbed species on the surface to the emission from Eu 3+ ions. When the amount of PVP is 0.2 g, the luminescence intensity of the uniform and smooth microspheres is at its strongest. This result indicates that an efficient transfer to the rare earth ions occurs, perhaps because the nanostructures can prevent the adsorbed species on the surface from quenching the emissions from the Eu 3+ ions and crystal fields around the Eu 3+ ions which possess well order and symmetry. So we can further confirm that Eu 3+ occupies the host lattice and replaces Y 3+ . Therefore, the Eu 3+ dopant in uniform YVO 4 microspheres leads to a noticeable improvement in the luminescent properties. The emission spectra of the products obtained at 180 \u00b0C for different hydrothermal reaction times (6, 12, and 24 h) are shown in Fig. 10 . All the emission spectra of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ powders show similar features despite the varying the reaction times. Upon excitation of 303 nm, the emission spectra are also associated with transitions from the excited 5 D 0 level to 7 F J ( J = 1, 2, 3) levels of Eu 3+ activators. The emission intensity of the microspheres increases by increasing the hydrothermal reaction time due to an increase in the crystallinity and particles size, which is in good agreement with the XRD and SEM results. Therefore, by changing the morphology of the powders, the luminescent properties of the YVO 4 :Eu 3+ phosphors can be effectively controlled using PVP as an effective surfactant. 4 Conclusions Large-scale and well-dispersed YVO 4 :Eu microspheres were synthesized by a PVP-assisted hydrothermal process at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h. The effect of the PVP amount and hydrothermal reaction time on the morphology of the as-synthesized product was investigated in detail. The experimental results reveal that YVO 4 :Eu 3+ microspheres (4\u20135 \u03bcm) with regular shape and smooth surface can be obtained using 0.2 g PVP with a molecular weight of 20,000 g mol \u22121 at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h under hydrothermal conditions. The excitation and emission intensities of the YVO 4 :Eu 3+ microspheres had a strong dependence on the hydrothermal reaction time due to the increase of crystallinity. This low-temperature synthetic route, involving no catalysts and requiring no precise equipment, can be easily adjusted to prepare YVO 4 crystals on a large scale. Simultaneously realizing a shape-controlled synthesis of microspheres is exciting and challenging; the resulting structures and sizes are both scientifically and technically important, which is the foundation for practical application.

        "abstract": "The present research describes a simple low-temperature synthesis route for obtention of porous YVO 4 :Dy and YVO 4 :Tm nanoplates via a chemical co-precipitation method using commercially available Y 2 O 3 , NH 4 VO 3 , Tm 2 O 3 , Dy 2 O 3 and ethylene glycol as the reacting precursors. To investigate the effect of heating temperatures on the pore size and morphology of nanoplates-like powders, the as-synthesized YVO 4 :Ln were thermally treated at 300 and 600 \u00b0C for 2 h which is much lower than that of the conventional preparation methods. The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and photoluminescent (PL) spectroscopy. The photoluminescence measurement revealed that the luminescence intensity was significantly increased with increasing annealing temperature that causes increase of crystallinity and pore size of the porous nanoplates. From PL spectra, it was found that porous YVO 4 :Dy nanoplates have characteristic emission peaks due to the 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 13/2 and 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 15/2 emission transitions of Dy 3+ . The experimental results have showed that the host YVO 4 transfers the adsorbed energy to thulium ions and strong blue emission at 475 nm assigned to 1 G 4 \u2192 3 H 6 transition was observed. Keywords Optical materials Precipitation Optical properties Luminescence 1 Introduction Yttrium orthovanadate (YVO 4 ) is one of the most promising inorganic luminescent materials having a zirconia-type tetragonal structure and has a wide practical application in many devices involving the artificial production of light and display fields at present [1,2,22\u201327] . A rapid development in the manufacturing of modern field emission displays has created a new demand for a few well-known phosphors with improved properties such as high brightness, high density, high stability, long lifetime, etc. Thus a number of research groups have directed their investigations towards this goal by different approaches. YVO 4 with lanthanide ions have been extensively studied for high luminescent performance owing to abundant emission colors based mainly on f\u2013f transition [3,28] . In the second half of the last century, Levine and Palilla [4] first reported that YVO 4 can be modified by Eu 3+ to be used as a red phosphor in color television, the cathode ray tube and the high-pressure mercury lamp due to its high luminescence efficiency upon electron-beam excitation. Yttrium orthovanadate activated by trivalent dysprosium (YVO 4 :Dy) is a well-known phosphor with high efficiency [5] . The emission color of the luminescence is close to white because of the yellow ( 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 13/2 ) and blue ( 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 15/2 ) emissions of Dy 3+ . In general, a whitish color turns to yellow in host lattices. Good physical, optical, and mechanical properties have made YVO 4 :Nd an excellent crystal for high power, stable, and cost-effective diode-pumped solid-state lasers [6,29] . Recent research results have demonstrated that Yb 3+ -doped YVO 4 has longer lifetime and higher quantum efficiency than its counterpart Nd-doped materials [7] . The passively Q -switched c-cut Nd:Gd 0.63 Y 0.37 VO 4 crystal has large energy storage capacity and indicate the shortest pulse width, largest pulse energy, and highest peak power [30] . Er 3+ -doped YVO 4 has been considered to be a very attractive potential laser material in the eye safe region around 1.6 \u03bcm [8] . In addition, the holmium-doped yttrium orthovanadate crystal was shown to be an effective solid-state saturable-absorber Q switch for a flash-lamp-pumped Y 3 Al 5 O 12 :Tm,Cr laser operating at 2.017 \u03bcm [9] . To avoid the drawbacks of currently available sulfide-based blue phosphors, modification of YVO 4 with thulium ions have been attempted because of its stability under high excitation density, appropriate lifetime and color rendering properties [10] . According to Saito et al. [11] , YVO 4 :Tm has a smoother and more intense absorption profile for the pump band, which offers advantages for diode-laser pumping, in comparison with the earlier Tm 3+ lasers. Inorganic nanocrystals have already exhibited unique size- and shape-dependent electrical, magnetic and optical properties due to potential quantum confinement effect and low dimensionality [12] . Recently, many efforts have been developed for the fabrication of porous nanostructures which give fascinating properties to a material differing from the solid counter parts [13,14] . If the porous nanostructure and luminescence property could be combined together, the porous nanomaterials would be useful as an ideal candidate for the photoluminescence applications due to their surface plasmonic properties and catalytic activities. Till date, low-temperature morphology controllable soft chemical methods have been employed to fabricate well-dispersed fine YVO 4 , i.e. hydrothermal synthesis [15] , hydrolyzed colloidal reaction technique [16] and induced precipitation [17] . However, all reported methods produced solid nanoparticles without any pores. To the best of our knowledge, no report on the synthesis and luminescent properties of porous YVO 4 :Ln (Ln = Dy, Tm) nanoplates has been published. Therefore, in this paper, we demonstrate a simple approach for the synthesis of porous YVO 4 :Ln nanoplates by chemical co-precipitation method to regulate both the pore size and morphology of nanoparticles. Furthermore, the optical properties were investigated in details. 2 Experimental All chemical reagents were analytical purity and purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagents Company (China) and used without further purification. Nanosized Y 0.98 VO 4 :Ln 0.02 (Ln = Tm, Dy) were synthesized by chemical co-precipitation method. The stoichiometric amounts of Y 2 O 3 , Tm 2 O 3 and Dy 2 O 3 were dissolved in 20 ml HNO 3 (6 mol/l) at room temperature to obtain a transparent solution. 5 ml ethylene glycol (C 2 H 6 O 2 ) was added into the solution as a complex agent, followed by introducing the stoichiometric amount of NH 4 VO 3 as a source of vanadium ions. The mixture was continuously stirred at room temperature for 20 min. Subsequently, 25 ml of ammonia (NH 4 OH) solution was slowly dropped into the homogenous solution under vigorous stirring to adjust its pH to 9\u201310. The resultant solution was preheated in a thermostated water bath at 80 \u00b0C for 6 h. Then the as-synthesized precipitate was collected, washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol several times, and dried in vacuum at 80 \u00b0C for 6 h. It is of interest to investigate how the heating temperature can influence the pore size and morphology of the as-synthesized YVO 4 :Ln nanoparticles. Therefore, in this work, the as-synthesized powders were heated at 300 and 600 \u00b0C for 2 h at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min in a laboratory furnace. The crystal structures of the powders were determined by a powder X-ray diffraction (XRD; D/MAX2550, Rigaku, Japan) with monochromated Cu K\u03b1 ( \u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5) at 40 kV and 50 mA. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrographs of the powders were taken with a JEM-2000 Ex transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) under a working voltage of 200 kV. The excitation and emission photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a PerkinElmer LS55 fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Shelton, USA). 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 presents the results of XRD analysis of the as-synthesized at 80 \u00b0C for 6 h and heated nanocrystalline YVO 4 :Dy and YVO 4 :Tm at 300 and 600 \u00b0C for 2 h although a difference between the XRD patterns of two compositions is not observed. All peaks can be indexed to a pure phase YVO 4 (JCPDS Card No.17-0341) with a zirconia-type tetragonal structure belonging to the space group I 1 / amd 1 and its lattice parameters are a = b = 0.71192 nm and c = 0.62898. The presence of a single phase without the presence of any extraneous phases in the samples is confirmed. The results exhibit that pure phase YVO 4 :Ln can be obtained under the current conditions of chemical co-precipitation method at as low a temperature as 80 \u00b0C for 6 h. The diffraction intensities of the samples increases with increasing heating temperature up to 600 \u00b0C which means the samples become a highly crystallized at that temperature. Fig. 2 (a\u2013c) compares the TEM micrographs of the as-synthesized and heated nanocrystalline YVO 4 :Dy at 300 and 600 \u00b0C for 2 h. Clearly, the sample preheated at 80 \u00b0C for 6 h has roughly plate-like nanoparticles with size of 10\u201320 nm. The plate-like nanoparticles seem to be composed of many small nanoparticles. After heat treatment of the as-synthesized samples at 300 \u00b0C, the size of the plate-like nanoparticles became apparently larger (\u224830 nm) and the porous surface appeared on the plate-like nanoparticles. Further increasing the heating temperature up to 600 \u00b0C resulted in the formation of relatively larger nanoplates (\u224840 nm) with narrow particle size distribution. Evidently, the sample heated at 600 \u00b0C has a large porous structure than that of the sample heated at 300 \u00b0C. The increase in pore diameter of the sample is thought to be not only due to crystal growth at higher temperatures at 300 and 600 \u00b0C, but also due to the output of CO 2 into of matrix the C 2 H 6 O 2 . This is also a factor that caused the increase of pore diameter in the YVO 4 powders, because of heat treatment thermal promote the decomposition of residuals organics compounds, by the following reaction: 2 C 2 H 6 O 2 + 5 O 2 \u27f6 \u0394 4 C O 2 + 6 H 2 O , due to output CO 2 of interior of nanoplates. Fig. 2 d shows that the YVO 4 :Tm nanoplates heated at 600 \u00b0C for 2 h have the porous structure with a pore diameter in the range of about 5 nm. In contrast, the porous nanoplates of YVO 4 :Ln are different from the nanoparticles synthesized without ethylene glycol [18] . It was found that the environment of the ethylene glycol solution considerably influenced the shape formation of the YVO 4 :Ln crystals. Fig. 3 displays the representative excitation spectrum of the as-synthesized YVO 4 :Dy powders. The excitation spectrum of YVO 4 :Dy nanoplates monitored at 574 nm consists of a broad band ranging from 200 to 350 nm with a maximum 305 nm and a shoulder at 270 nm and some sharp lines in the longer wavelength region. The former is due to the absorption of [VO 6 ]\u2032 clusters and the latter to the f\u2013f transitions within Dy 3+ 4 F 9 configuration [19,31] . The absorption of [VO 6 ]\u2032 is ascribed to a charge transfer from the oxygen ligands (O 2\u2212 ) to the central vanadium atom (V 5+ ). In crystalline YVO 4 , the original T d symmetry of [VO 6 ]\u2032 clusters is reduced to D 2d by the crystal field, which causes a splitting of the degenerate energy levels of [VO 6 ]\u2032 clusters [20] . For the existing of two excitation bands, the reason may be attributed to the distortion of the nanosized YVO 4 . It is well known that YVO 4 belongs to the tetragonal zirconia structure and Y 3+ is located at a site (D 2d ) deviated from an inverse center in YVO 4 host. In addition, the particle size of the as-prepared samples is in nanometer dimension, which can also induce the distortion of YVO 4 . All can arouse different V\u2013O bond of [VO 6 ]\u2032. Thus there are two excitation bands existing in excitation spectra [20,21] . Besides this, in the longer wavelength region (350\u2013450 nm), weaker excitation band also appears originated from the f\u2013f transition of Dy 3+ . All the excitation spectra of the as-synthesized YVO 4 :Tm also showed the similar features and the representative one is illustrated in Fig. 4 . The excitation spectrum monitored at 475 nm consists of two strong absorption bands in the short ultraviolet region (200\u2013350 nm) centered at 211 and 279 nm, respectively. The strong wide band centered at 279 nm originates in transitions towards the charge transfer from the oxygen ligands to the central vanadium atom inside the [VO 6 ]\u2032, which are almost similar shape for all samples. The small peaks in the range of 211 nm are attributed to the host absorption band. In the longer wavelength (350\u2013450 nm), the f\u2013f transitions are too weak to be analyzed. The emission spectra of as-synthesized and heated Dy 3+ doped YVO 4 at 300 and 600 \u00b0C for 2 h are shown in Fig. 5 . The emission spectra show similar trend for all as-synthesized and thermally treated samples. The spectral peaks at 482.5 nm (blue color) and 574 nm (yellow color) correspond to 4 H 9/2 \u2192 6 H 15/2 and 4 H 9/2 \u2192 6 H 13/2 emission transitions of Dy 3+ have been observed, respectively. The 4 H 9/2 \u2192 6 H 15/2 transition is magnetically allowed and hardly varies with the crystal field strength around the dysprosium ion. On the other hand, the 4 H 9/2 \u2192 6 H 13/2 transition is a forced electric dipole transition being allowed only at low symmetries with no inversion center. When the Dy 3+ ion is located at low-symmetry local sites with no inversion centers, 4 H 9/2 \u2192 6 H 13/2 emission transition is often prominent in its emission spectrum. Because Dy 3+ is located at a site of D 2d , which is deviated from an inverse center in the host of YVO 4 , the intensity of its yellow emission is stronger than that of its blue emission. Although the major peak positions in the emission spectrum are identical to each other, the intensity patterns are much different. The emission intensity of porous YVO 4 :Dy nanoplates heated at 300 \u00b0C increase little compared with the as-synthesized YVO 4 :Dy nanoplates. When the heating temperature reached 600 \u00b0C, the emission intensity of YVO 4 :Dy nanoplates is almost four times higher than the intensity of the as-synthesized YVO 4 :Dy nanoplates. However, the luminescent properties of normal nanoplates synthesized without porous were independent of the heating temperature showing the same peak and intensity [20] . The emission spectra of the as-synthesized and heated nanocrystalline YVO 4 :Tm at 300 and 600 \u00b0C for 2 h in the range 350\u2013585 nm obtained upon 279 nm excitation are represented in Fig. 6 . All the spectral peaks are approximately the same and a strong blue emission centered at 475 nm is observed, which is corresponded to the 1 G 4 \u2192 3 H 6 transition. YVO 4 :Tm prepared under the current conditions can emit a relatively a high pure and strong blue light, which is relative to the high efficiency of the host-to-guest energy transfer. The influence of pore size on the emission intensity of YVO 4 :Tm nanoplates was also investigated. Although all the peak positions in the emission spectra are identical with each other, the intensity of all the peaks increased gradually with increasing pore size at different annealing temperatures. The peculiar luminescent properties of YVO 4 :Dy and YVO 4 :Tm are possible because of the distinct porous structure of the nanocrystals. 4 Conclusion In summary, we have demonstrated a facile route to synthesize porous YVO 4 :Ln (Ln = Dy, Tm) nanoplates using NH 4 VO 3 , Y 2 O 3 , Tm 2 O 3 and Dy 2 O 3 and ethylene glycol as the reacting precursors. The influence of heating temperatures on the pore size and morphology of the as-synthesized product was investigated. The photoluminescence measurement showed that the luminescence intensity of the porous YVO 4 :Ln nanoplates was enhanced with increasing pore size of the nanocrystals after thermal treatment at 300 and 600 \u00b0C for 2 h. From PL spectra, it was found that porous YVO 4 :Dy nanoplates have characteristic emission peaks due to the 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 13/2 and 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 15/2 emission transitions of Dy 3+ . The experimental results have showed that the host YVO 4 transfers the adsorbed energy to thulium ions and strong blue emission at 475 nm assigned to 1 G 4 \u2192 3 H 6 transition was observed. These materials may find industrial applications due to special properties, simplicity of process, low cost, and availability of raw materials. This method may be extended to synthesize other phosphors with controllable porous nanostructure.

        "abstract": "In this work, a facile hydrothermal route has been proposed for the morphology-controllable preparation of Eu-doped yttrium orthovanadate (YVO 4 :Eu 3+ ) powders in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) as a template in a wide pH range. The structure, composition, morphology, and optical properties of the final products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), respectively. It was found that single phase YVO 4 :Eu 3+ micro- and nanocrystals with different shapes can be fabricated at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h with suitable amount of SDS in a wide pH range. The formation mechanism and the influence of SDS on the morphology of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ micro- and nanocrystals were investigated as a function of pH value. The PL measurement revealed that the samples with different morphologies exhibited different values for optical properties, especially soybean-like nanopowders showed a higher intensity compared to other samples with different morphologies due mainly to their high packing densities and low scattering of light.

        "title": "Enhanced cycling performance of silicon/disordered carbon/carbon nanotubes composite for lithium ion batteries",
        "abstract": "A composite anode material of silicon/disordered carbon/carbon nanotubes (Si/DC/CNTs) was prepared by pyrolyzing the mixture of silicon (Si), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as carbon source. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed that the phase transition of Si from crystalline to amorphous form occurred during the first cycle. The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) observation revealed that Si particles wrapped by a CNTs network were homogeneously embedded into the carbonaceous matrix. The Si/DC/CNTs composite showed a discharge capacity of 1254 mAh/g in the first cycle, and a discharge capacity of 821 mAh/g after 20 cycles, which is much higher than that of Si/DC composite (658 mAh/g). It was found that the excellent resiliency of the CNTs can assist the carbonaceous matrix derived from PVC to restore the volumetric changes of the Si. Keywords Silicon Disordered carbon Carbon nanotubes Anode material 1 Introduction Li-ion batteries have been intensively used in portable electronics, aerial devices, and electric automobiles because of their high specific capacity and excellent cycling performance. To develop the high capacity density anode materials for Li-ion batteries, considerable efforts have been made so far, especially focusing on Si as an anode due to its high theoretical capacity (4200 mAh/g) [1\u20133] . However, Si particles show a strong volumetric effect during the repeated alloying and dealloying process of Li with Si, which leads to poor cyclability [4,5] . A variety of composites containing silicon particles have been prepared to enhance the electrochemical properties of Si [6\u201310] . Among these composites, carbonaceous matrixes have shown more advantages over others [11\u201313] , for example, silicon/disordered carbon [14] , silicon/graphite [15] , and silicon/graphene [16] . The DC materials can relieve and buffer the severe volumetric changes of silicon particles. So the Si/DC composites have exhibited even higher capacity and better cycling performance. However, it is still challenging to have high capacity and good cyclability simultaneously in the Si/DC composites. Because increasing the weight percentage of Si in the composite can give a high capacity but low cycling performance and decreasing the weight percentage of Si can give a good cyclability but low specific capacity. The unique properties of the CNTs, namely, superior mechanical strength and good electrical conductivity, improved the electrochemical performance of the Si/C/CNTs composites significantly [17,18] . As reported previously, different carbon sources, namely, pitch [13] , sugar [14] , polyacrylonitrile [15] , resorcinol [19] , polyvinyl alcohol [20] , and phenol-formaldehyde resin [21,22] , had different effects on the enhancement of properties of the Si/DC composite. To the best of our knowledge, we first report the preparation of the Si/DC/CNTs composite using PVC as carbon source. The contribution of carbon source on the improvement of cycling performance of the Si/DC/CNTs composite is discussed in this work. 2 Experimental The CNTs purchased from Chengdu Organic Chemical Co., China, have a diameter of 30\u201350 nm and length of about 1 \u03bcm. The particle size of silicon purchased from Hefei Kaier Nanotechnology Development Co., China, is about 80\u2013100 nm. First, 1.5 g PVC was dissolved in 20 mL propylene oxide, and then 0.15 g Si and 0.13 g CNTs were separately dispersed in 20 mL propylene oxide using a high power ultrasonicator. The last two solutions were introduced drop-wise into the PVC solution and mixed by mechanical stirring to obtain a viscous residue at room temperature. The viscous residue was dried in a vacuum oven at 100 \u00b0C overnight, sealed in a quartz tube, heated at 900 \u00b0C under argon atmosphere for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C/min, and then cooled down to room temperature. Two parallel experiments were also conducted under the current conditions in the absence of CNTs and CNTs/Si. Silicon/disordered carbon/carbon nanotubes, silicon/disordered carbon, and disordered carbon were labeled as Si/DC/CNTs, Si/DC, and DC hereafter. The yield of the DC from PVC was calculated according to the weight loss before and after sintering in the quartz tube. The compositions of the Si/DC/CNTs and Si/DC nanocomposites were estimated on the basis of a yield of 10% from PVC to disordered carbon, and no weight loss for Si and CNTs. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a D/Max2400 diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) with monochromated Cu K\u03b1 radiation to identify the phases. The morphology of the composite was examined by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-6700F, JEOL, Japan). The working electrodes were prepared by casting the slurry of sample powder (80 wt.%), acetylene black (5 wt.%), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, 15 wt.%) dissolved in N -methylpyrrolidone (NMP) on a copper foil, dried under vacuum at 120 \u00b0C overnight and pressed at 2 MPa for 10 s. Li foil was used as counter electrode. The working and counter electrodes were separated with a Celgard 2400 separator in an argon-filled glove box. 1 M LiPF 6 dissolved in the mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1 in volume) was the electrolyte. The charge\u2013discharge characteristics were obtained at room temperature between 0 V and 3 V at a constant current density of 30 mA/g. 3 Results and discussion The SEM image of the Si/DC/CNTs composite before charge\u2013discharge cycling performance is displayed in Fig. 1 . As can be seen, the bright particles are nanocrystalline silicon, and the CNTs fibers are the connecting main wires to form a network that can finely wrap silicon particles. Si and CNTs are homogeneously distributed within the carbonaceous matrix, and the agglomeration of Si or CNTs is not observed. The charge\u2013discharge curves of the first, second, and tenth cycles of the Si/DC/CNTs composite are shown in Fig. 2 . Clearly, during the first discharge process, a distinct plateau, corresponding to the formation of solid electrolyte interface film, can be observed at around 0.8 V, and this plateau disappears during the following cycles. Compared with the discharge curve of the first cycle, the discharge curve of the second cycle becomes more declining, and the voltage plateau ascends about 0.2 V than that of the first cycle. The discharge curves of the subsequent cycles are almost consistent with that of the second cycle. The difference of the discharge curves between the initial and the subsequent cycles indicates that the phase structure transition of the composite might have occurred. The XRD measurements were performed to confirm phase structure transition of the Si/DC/CNTs composite. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the Si/DC/CNTs composite before and after lithium extraction. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the diffraction peaks of Si with high intensity can be observed before cycling and no any diffraction peaks of inert SiC or SiO x are detected. The carbon derived from PVC shows no any significant diffraction peaks, indicating that the carbon in the composite is in the disordered state. As can be seen in Fig. 3 b, the diffraction peaks of Si completely disappeared after lithium extraction. This is mainly attributed to the phase transition of Si from crystalline to amorphous form during the first cycle. The cycling performances of the Si/DC/CNTs, Si/DC, Si, CNTs, and DC as anode materials are shown in Fig. 4 . It can be seen that the pure Si shows a high capacity in the initial cycle, but the capacity drops down dramatically in the next cycles. The CNTs show a good cycling performance except for a high irreversible capacity in the first cycle, and a discharge capacity of 215 mAh/g retains after 20 charge\u2013discharge cycles. Compared with CNTs, DC shows higher capacity and a discharge capacity of 350 mAh/g is obtained after 20 cycles. The Si/DC composite exhibits high capacity in the first 10 cycles, but the discharge capacity of the Si/DC composite begins to drop rapidly after 10 cycles. After 20 cycles, only a discharge capacity of 658 mAh/g is retained. However, the Si/DC/CNTs composite not only show a high capacity, but also a good cycling performance. A discharge capacity of 1254 mAh/g is obtained in the first cycle, and a discharge capacity of 821 mAh/g is still retained after 20 cycles. To compare with that of the Si/DC composite, the cycling performance of the Si/DC/CNTs composite is enhanced remarkably. In our experiment, the Si/DC/CNTs composite contains approximately 35 wt.% Si, 35 wt.% DC and 30 wt.% CNTs, and the Si/DC composite contains approximately 35 wt.% Si and 65 wt.% DC. As can be seen in Fig. 4 , the discharge capacity of DC is much higher than that of CNTs. Compared with the Si/DC composite, the weight percentage of Si in the Si/DC/CNTs composite is identical, but the weight percentage of DC is lower. Hence, it can be speculated that the capacity of the Si/DC/CNTs composite should be lower than that of the Si/DC composite. However, the electrochemical testing shows that the capacity of the Si/DC/CNTs composite is nearly equally with that of the Si/DC composite during the initial cycles. The main reason may be explained that the good electrical conductivity of the CNTs can lead to more Si particles in the Si/DC/CNTs composite to be active with Li during the charge\u2013discharge cycles. Though the Si/DC composite exhibits high capacity in the first several cycles, but drops down markedly in the subsequent cycles. This indicates that the DC matrix to absorb and buffer the large volume changes of Si during the alloying and dealloying process was still not enough. By adding CNTs into the Si/DC composite, CNTs form a network in the Si/DC/CNTs composite as electrical wires. The excellent resiliency of the CNTs can assist the DC matrix to restore the volumetric changes of the Si. So the effect of the carbonaceous matrix derived from PVC to relieve and buffer the volume change of Si is enhanced remarkably, which will ultimately lead to the stable structure of the electrode. In addition, the DC derived from PVC shows higher discharge capacity than that of the DC derived from the phenol-formaldehyde resin (PFR), which might be due to the higher specific surface area of the DC obtained from PVC [23] . So on the same weight percentage of DC, the Si/DC/CNTs composite using DC derived from PVC as carbonaceous matrix can possess a higher capacity. 4 Conclusion In this study, a novel composite anode material of Si/DC/CNTs was prepared using polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as carbon source. CNTs wrapping the Si particles form a network structure in the carbonaceous matrix. Compared with the Si/DC composite, the cycle performance of the Si/DC/CNTs composite was improved significantly. A discharge capacity of 821 mAh/g was retained after 20 charge\u2013discharge cycles. The excellent resiliency and good electrical conductivity of the CNTs can keep more Si particles electrochemically active with Li and more stable morphology of the Si/DC/CNTs composite during the charge\u2013discharge cycles.

        "abstract": "SnS 2 microspheres composed of submicron-sized flakes were successfully prepared via a simple surfactant-free hydrothermal reaction route at 240 \u00b0C for 12 h, using SnCl 4 and Na 2 S as reactants. The powders were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The X-ray diffraction pattern confirmed that the SnS 2 microspheres had a single-phase hexagonal structure. The SEM micrographs indicated that these microspheres with the size of \u223c30 \u03bcm in diameter were mainly constructed by self-assembly of submicron-sized SnS 2 flakes. The effect of reaction temperature and the amount of mineralizer (urea) on the formation of SnS 2 microspheres under hydrothermal conditions were investigated and a possible formation mechanism was preliminarily presented. Keywords Semiconductor Chemical synthesis Scanning electron microscopy Hydrothermal method 1 Introduction In recent years, tremendous research activities have been directed towards the synthesis of nano- and submicron-sized structures owing to their theoretical and practical interests. Basically, these structures exhibit a set of unique electronic, magnetic, and chemical properties, which are beyond the bounds of possibility to achieve with their bulk counterparts [1] . Until now, several approaches have been developed to fabricate inorganic nano- and micron-sized structures by the assistance of templates and/or surfactants [2\u20134] . However, the synthesis of microspheres with different surface morphologies by a template- and/or surfactant-free route still remains an interesting topic. It is well know that the properties can be drastically enhanced by tailoring surface morphology of a material with a nano- and submicron size. Tin sulfide (SnS 2 ) is one of the most fascinating layered compounds due to its unique structural properties. Tin sulfide has a layered hexagonal CdI 2 -type crystal structure consisting two layers of close-packed sulfur anions with tin cations, which is sandwiched between them in an octahedral coordination. The adjacent sulfur layers are bound by a weak van der Waals interaction [5] . SnS 2 has been used as a semiconductor with a larger band gap of 2.18 eV [6] , photoconductor, Li-ion battery anode material [7] , sensors [8] , etc. Owing to its photoconductivity, it is also regarded as a prospective candidate for solar cells and optoelectronic devices [9\u201311] . So far, SnS 2 was fabricated by employing solid state reaction [12] , solid state metathesis [13] , and mechanochemical [14] techniques. In order to control the size and shape of the resulting powders, various soft chemical methods have also been applied in synthesizing SnS 2 nanostructures with different morphologies, such as nanosheets, nanowires, nanoplates, nanotubes, nanobelts, and nanoleaves [7,15\u201319] ; however, a few works have been done on the synthesis of SnS 2 microspheres [8] . In this paper, a simple template/surfactant-free hydrothermal synthesis route for SnS 2 microspheres composed of submicron-sized flakes is reported and the characterizations of the product are presented. 2 Experimental All chemicals (Beijing Chemical Reagents Co. Ltd., China) in the present work were of analytical-grade and used without further purification. In a typical synthesis process, stoichiometric amounts of SnCl 4 and Na 2 S were weighed and separately dissolved in 10 ml distilled water. Two solutions were then mixed under vigorous stirring for 10 min to obtain a yellow-colored precursor. The precursor was transferred into a 40 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a filling capacity of 75% of the total volume. As mineralizer, urea [CO(NH 2 ) 2 ] was introduced into the autoclave. Afterwards, the autoclave was maintained at different temperatures ranging from 200 \u00b0C to 240 \u00b0C for 12 h in an oven and then cooled down to room temperature naturally. The products were filtered out, washed several times with distilled water, and finally dried at 80 \u00b0C for 4 h in a vacuum. The crystal structure of the resulting products was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (model D/MAX2550V, Rigaku Co., Japan) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5) at 40 kV and 50 mA. The morphology of the as-synthesized powders was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (Quanta 200, FEI, The Netherlands) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). 3 Results and discussion The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the SnS 2 powders synthesized at 240 \u00b0C for 12 h by hydrothermal method is shown in Fig. 1 . All the peaks were fully indexed to the hexagonal SnS 2 phase. The calculated lattice parameters were: a = b = 3.644 \u00c5 and c = 5.895 \u00c5. These values are almost consistent with those reported in the literature and with the standard powder diffraction file of SnS 2 (JCPDS card no. 23-0677). No characteristic peaks for other impurity phases were detected. It should be noted that the diffraction peak of (0 0 1) in the XRD pattern was remarkably strong, which provided an evidence for preferential growth of SnS 2 crystallites along (0 0 1) direction. The morphology of the SnS 2 powders synthesized at 240 \u00b0C for 12 h via hydrothermal method was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and illustrated in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2 A shows a typical low-magnification SEM micrograph of the SnS 2 powders. It can be seen in Fig. 2 A, the as-prepared SnS 2 powders are consisted mainly of large-scale microspheres with the size of 10\u201350 \u03bcm in diameter. High-magnification SEM micrograph of the SnS 2 powders is represented in Fig. 2 B that depicts the surface morphology of the single particle. The SnS 2 microspheres are composed mainly of submicron-sized flakes with a layered structure; the thickness of a single flake is about 200 nm, and they are arranged in a clockwise direction. The results from an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ( Fig. 2 C) revealed that the atomic ratio of Sn/S was about 1:1.92, which was closer to 1:2. Moreover, a variety of twinned spheres with clear interfaces can also be seen in Fig. 2 D. Such structures comprise more than two spheres, where each spheres still has a certain diameter of about 20 \u03bcm. Parallel experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of reaction temperature and the amount of urea (mineralizer) on the formation of the SnS 2 microspheres under hydrothermal processing. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the SnS 2 powders as a function of hydrothermal reaction temperature. The XRD patterns indicate that the SnO 2 powders without any impurity phases can be obtained at 200 \u00b0C for 12 h. The diffraction peaks corresponding to the SnS 2 phase starts to appear at 220 \u00b0C. As the synthesis temperature further increases to 240 \u00b0C, significant increase in the (0 0 1) peak of the SnS 2 can be observed. As an excellent mineralizer, urea has been widely used to synthesize various types of inorganic nano- and micron-sized inorganic materials [20\u201322] . As shown in Fig. 4 , the SnS 2 powders with different morphologies can be obtained by variation of the amount of urea. When the amount of 0.2 g urea was added into the system, uniform SnS 2 microdiscs were obtained with a diameter about 8 \u03bcm and the thickness about 200 nm ( Fig. 4 A). Increasing the amount of urea to 0.4 g, flower-like SnS 2 microstructures were obtained as the main product ( Fig. 4 B). The flower-like microstructures were mainly composed of micron-sized flakes with the thickness of about 500 nm. For an addition of 0.8 g urea, microspheres with a diameter in the range of 20\u201335 \u03bcm were obtained with clockwise-directed layers of submicron-sized flakes ( Fig. 4 C). The process described here is of interest because it does require any templates/surfactants, as mentioned above. The basic reaction can be described as follows: (1) SnCl 4 + Na 2 S \u2192 SnS 2 (submicron-sized flakes) + 4NaCl (2) CO(NH 2 ) 2 + 3H 2 O \u2192 CO 2 + 2NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O (3) SnS 2 (submicron-sized flakes) \u2192 SnS 2 microspheres The formation of the SnS 2 microspheres is associated with the CO 2 microbubbles formed by the hydrolysis of CO(NH 2 ) 2 . An idealized formation mechanism of the SnS 2 microspheres and their aggregation are shown in Fig. 5 . The above given results demonstrate a three-step process to form large SnS 2 microspheres under the present hydrothermal reaction system. First, the amorphous SnS 2 nucleates and assembles into flakes of submicron dimensions in a supersaturated system due to its high-anisotropic crystal structure nature; second, the submicron SnS 2 flakes tend to aggregate around the gas\u2013liquid interface of CO 2 and water due to the minimization of interfacial energy, and then the SnS 2 microspheres are formed by self-assembling of the submicron SnS 2 flakes. CO 2 microbubbles seem to play a template-like role in the formation of the SnS 2 microspheres; in addition, the microspheres grow into larger microspheres and start to agglomerate. 4 Conclusions In this letter, the SnS 2 microspheres were successfully prepared by a template-free hydrothermal process at 240 \u00b0C for 12 h. The presence of hexagonal SnS 2 as a single phase was confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The SEM examination revealed that the final product was consisted of the microspheres with the size of \u223c30 \u03bcm in diameter and each microsphere was mainly constructed with submicron-sized flakes. The experimental results showed that hydrothermal reaction temperature had an important role towards producing highly crystallized pure SnS 2 microspheres. As a mineralizer, amount of urea was essential to control the morphology of the SnS 2 microspheres composed of submicron-sized flakes. A possible formation mechanism of the SnS 2 microspheres by self-assembly of submicron-sized flakes was preliminarily presented.

        "abstract": "Spherical-shaped Eu-doped yttrium orthovanadate (YVO 4 :Eu 3+ ) powders were fabricated via disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate (Na 2 EDTA)-assisted hydrothermal technique. The as-synthesized YVO 4 :Eu 3+ microspheres were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The experimental results showed that the morphology and size of the microspheres had a strong dependence on the concentration of Na 2 EDTA and the reaction time of hydrothermal treatment. Spherical YVO 4 :Eu 3+ crystals with the diameter of 1.0\u20133.0 \u03bcm were obtained in the presence of 0.025 M Na 2 EDTA at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h. The photoluminescence measurement revealed that YVO 4 :Eu 3+ powders with well-spherical shape have better red luminescence properties among all the samples. Keywords Optical materials Precipitation Optical properties Luminescence 1 Introduction Highly efficient and inexpensive phosphors are essential for the production of new luminescence materials [1\u20133] . With the development of high definition projection television and color plasma display panels, phosphors have been required to possess high quantum efficiency, effective excitation and absorption, suitable color purity, longer lifetime and low cost. In order to obtain phosphors with enhanced properties, morphology, crystal size, chemical composition and surface properties can be controlled as important functions [4] . It has been reported that spherical phosphors with the size of 0.5\u20133 \u03bcm are suitable in application [5] . The spherical particles can be packed densely so that the screen and displays can obtain high definition, in addition, the dense packed small particles can also prevent the phosphors from aging. However, if the size of the particles is too small, the luminescence efficiency will be decreased because of re-absorption and scattering of the particles. Therefore, fabrication of spherical phosphors with the size of 0.5\u20133 \u03bcm is aim of the present research from application point of view. Up to date, many synthetic routes have been developed to control the size, morphology and distribution of phosphor particles, but it is still difficult to obtain highly monodisperse spherical phosphor particles. Yttrium orthovanadate (YVO 4 ), an important optical material, has many profitable characteristics, that is, good thermal, mechanical and optical properties, which make it play an important role in many device involving the artificial production of light and display fields, such as excellent polarizer [6,7] and laser host material [8,9] . Doping the YVO 4 powders with Eu 3+ has been used as a red phosphor in color television and cathode ray tubes (CRTs), owing to its high luminescence efficiency upon electron-beam excitation [10,11] . Initially, preparation methods have high effects on material microstructure and physical properties. YVO 4 :Eu 3+ can be prepared either by solid-state reaction at high temperatures [12] or by solution chemistry method including hydrothermal synthesis [13\u201316] , hydrolyzed colloidal reaction technique [17] , and induced precipitation [18] . However, the as-synthesized powders under these methods are non-spherical, affecting the luminescence efficiency of the phosphors. Recently, several researches have been done to obtain the spherical YVO 4 materials due to their exceptional properties. For instance, YVO 4 :Dy 3+ phosphor prepared by a two-step spray pyrolysis [19] had irregular spherical morphology. Yu et al. [20] selected YVO 4 :Eu 3+ as the phosphor shell and silica spheres as the core materials to obtain the core-shell structured YVO 4 :Eu 3+ @SiO 2 materials with the size of 500 nm via the sol\u2013gel process. The hydrothermal synthetic route has many advantages to obtain high-crystallized powders with narrow particle size distribution and high purity without further heat treatment at high temperatures. Morphology and size of the particles can be easily controlled through hydrothermal process by adjusting the source species, reaction temperature and time, etc. In this paper, we therefore report Na 2 EDTA-assisted hydrothermal method to fabricate well-spherical YVO 4 :Eu 3+ phosphor powders with the size of 1\u20133 \u03bcm. The phase structures, morphologies and optical properties of the as-synthesized YVO 4 :Eu 3+ powders are characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of Y 0.95 Eu 0.05 VO 4 powders All chemical reagents were purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagents Company (China) and used without further purification. The doping concentration of Eu 3+ was 5 mol.% in YVO 4 host (Y 0.95 Eu 0.05 VO 4 ), which had been optimized previously [21,22] . Y 0.95 Eu 0.05 VO 4 powders were prepared via surfactant-assisted hydrothermal method. The stoichiometric amounts of Y 2 O 3 (99.99%), Eu 2 O 3 (99.99%) and NH 4 VO 3 (99%) were dissolved in 25 ml HNO 3 (3 mol/l). An appropriate amount of disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate (Na 2 EDTA) was introduced into the solution as a nonionic complex agent and stirred for 10 min to form a yellow-colored mixture. To adjust pH to 1, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution was slowly dropped into the mixture under vigorous stirring. After that, the well-stirred solution was poured into a 40 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a filling capacity of 75% and heated up to 180 \u00b0C for 24 h. As the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, the as-synthesized precipitate was collected, washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol several times, and dried in vacuum at 80 \u00b0C for 10 h. Parallel experiments with different additive, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), tetradecyltri-methylammoniumbromide (TDAB), were carried out under the same conditions. 2.2 Characterization The phase composition of the as-synthesized powders was characterized by an X-ray powder diffraction (Model D/MAX2550V, Rigaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) using Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5) at 40 kV and 50 mA. The morphology of the as-synthesized powders was observed using a scanning electron microscopy (FEI Quanta 200 ESEM, The Netherlands). The excitation and emission photoluminescence spectra were measured using a PerkinElmer LS55 fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Shelton, USA). 3 Results and discussion The XRD patterns of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ synthesized with different additive (Na 2 EDTA, PVP, TDAB, SDS) at the temperature of 180 \u00b0C for 24 h with pH 1 are shown in Fig. 1 . All peaks can be indexed to the tetragonal phase YVO 4 (JCPDS Card No.17-0341) with a zirconia structure. Fig. 2 presents the results of XRD analysis of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ obtained at different pH values (1, 4 and 7) via hydrothermal method at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h using 0.025 M Na 2 EDTA. The results exhibit that pure phase YVO 4 :Eu 3+ can be obtained under hydrothermal treatment and they are in good agreement with reported data (JCPDS Card No. 17-0341), approaching the standard values for the bulk YVO 4 . The SEM images of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ obtained by hydrothermal method at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h using different additive and pH values are illustrated in Fig. 3 a\u2013f , respectively. Visually, Fig. 3 a and b shows peanut-like and octahedron microstructures with an average size of 2 \u03bcm in diameter for the samples with SDS and TDAB at pH 1, respectively. Meanwhile, the sample synthesized with PVP at pH 1 shows ball-like microstructure with the diameter of 4\u20135 \u03bcm, as shown in Fig. 3 c. When the surfactant was changed to Na 2 EDTA, the uniform ball-like products with smooth surfaces were obtained with an average size of 1\u20133 \u03bcm in diameter ( Fig. 3 d). When the pH value of the solution increased to 4, the sample obtained at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h using Na 2 EDTA became twinning microspheres composed of uniform submicron cubes with different particle size distribution. The SEM image of the YVO 4 :Eu 3+ powders synthesized at pH 7 with flower-like structures composed of nanoplates with a uniform diameter about 30 nm is illustrated in Fig. 3 f. The present experiment suggests using Na 2 EDTA at pH 1 in order to prepare spherical YVO 4 :Eu 3+ powders with an average size of 1\u20133 \u03bcm in diameter under hydrothermal treatment at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h. Hereafter, further experiments were performed at 180 \u00b0C with Na 2 EDTA at pH 1, while Na 2 EDTA concentration and the reaction time of hydrothermal processing were varied. Fig. 4 shows XRD patterns of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ obtained 180 \u00b0C for 24 h using different concentrations of Na 2 EDTA (0.0125 M, 0.025 M and 0.05 M). All the peaks can be indexed as a tetragonal phase, which agree well with the standard date (JCPDS Card No. 17-0341), and no traces of other phases were detected. The SEM micrographs of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ phosphors obtained 180 \u00b0C for 24 h using different concentrations of Na 2 EDTA (0.0125 M, 0.025 M and 0.05 M) are shown in Fig. 5 . The sample synthesized at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h using 0.0125 M Na 2 EDTA by hydrothermal method ( Fig. 5 a) contains microspheres with irregular and unshaped form. Fig. 5 b shows a low-magnification SEM image of the as-synthesized YVO 4 :Eu 3+ powders prepared at 0.025 M Na 2 EDTA. Obviously, the uniform ball-like microspheres product has regular morphology and well crystalline state with the diameter in the range of 1\u20133 \u03bcm. Further structural analysis of these uniform microspheres was carried out using high-magnification SEM images. The spheres with a clear interface indicate that particles are highly crystallized. The surface of phosphors is very smooth which is very useful in preparing high efficient phosphors. However, when surfactant concentration increases to 0.05 M Na 2 EDTA ( Fig. 5 d), the sample has a nearly plate-like shape particles composed of uniform microspheres. It was found that tuning the Na 2 EDTA concentration in the growth solution was a crucial step in control of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ morphology and 0.025 M Na 2 EDTA was the optimum concentration for the preparation of uniform microspheres. The formation of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ structures are mainly the result of homogeneous precipitation process. It is well known that the addition of complex agents can affect the nucleation and growth of particles, which consequently modifies particle morphology and size. Clearly, a strong ligand (Na 2 EDTA) is not only needed to form a stable complex with Y 3+ , but also the ligand binds to the surface of the crystal. When the concentration of Na 2 EDTA is 0.0125 M, the homogeneous precipitation is complete, but the Na 2 EDTA is less, so the nucleus grows into spherical particles incomplete. And increasing the concentration of Na 2 EDTA to 0.025 M, with the aging times, the nucleus can grow into spherical particles. When the concentration of Na 2 EDTA is 0.05 M, there is excessive amount of Na 2 EDTA and the homogeneous nucleus are less comparison with amount of Na 2 EDTA, so the plate-like shape particles have been obtained. The effect of reaction time, or so-called crystallization time, of hydrothermal processing on the phase composition was also investigated. Fig. 6 shows a typical XRD pattern of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ synthesized by hydrothermal method at 180 \u00b0C for different reaction times (6 h, 12 h and 24 h). The results exhibit that pure phase YVO 4 :Eu 3+ can be obtained by hydrothermal method at 180 \u00b0C for 6 h and the diffraction intensities of the samples are increased with increasing reaction time up to 24 h. Fig. 7 shows the SEM micrographs of the YVO 4 :Eu 3+ powders prepared at 180 \u00b0C for different reaction times (6 h, 12 h and 24 h) of hydrothermal treatment. Evidently, the reaction time has a great impact on the morphologies of the final products. The crystallinity of the samples improved with the increasing of the reaction time. From the image in Fig. 7 a, it can be found that the YVO 4 :Eu 3+ powders obtained at 180 \u00b0C for 6 h exhibit small irregular shaped particles with twinning spheres and aggregation. When the reaction time is 12 h, spherical structure appeared but the edges were still not clear ( Fig. 7 b). Fig. 7 c indicates that when the reaction time is 24 h, pure YVO 4 :Eu 3+ exhibits uniform and smooth sphere shape with an average diameter of about 1\u20133 \u03bcm. It can be concluded that tuning the reaction time of the growth solution was the important step in controlling structure and morphology of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ microspheres. The final reaction time of 24 h was found to be optimum in order to get the large-scale and regular YVO 4 :Eu 3+ microspheres with uniform diameter of about 1\u20133 \u03bcm. PL spectra of the samples were measured using a fluorescence spectrometer at room temperature. Fig. 8 shows PL excitation spectra of the Y 0.95 Eu 0.05 VO 4 samples synthesized at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h using different Na 2 EDTA concentrations (0.0125 M, 0.025 M and 0.05 M) under the emission of 618 nm. All the excitation spectra are approximately the same and consist of a broad band ranging from 200 nm to 350 nm with a maximum peak at about 303 nm and some weak lines in the longer wavelength region. The former is due to the absorption of VO 4 3\u2212 group and the latter to the f\u2013f transitions within Eu 3+ 4f 6 configuration. Furthermore, when concentration of Na 2 EDTA reaches to 0.025 M, the excitation spectrum shows the strongest intensity. Similar to PL excitation spectra of different Na 2 EDTA concentration, Fig. 9 shows PL excitation spectra of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ powders with different reaction times of hydrothermal treatment at 180 \u00b0C. A broad absorption bands in the range of 200\u2013350 nm with a maximum peak at about 303 nm are due to the absorption of VO 4 3\u2212 group. In the longer wavelength (350\u2013500 nm), the small bands are f\u2013f transitions of Eu 3+ ions, but they are too weak. PL emission spectra of samples synthesized with different Na 2 EDTA concentration (0.0125 M, 0.025 M and 0.05 M) under the excitation of 303 nm are shown in Fig. 10 . The spectra composed of sharp lines ranging from 500 nm to 700 nm are associated with the transitions from the excited 5 D 0 level to 7 F J ( J = 1, 2, 3) levels of Eu 3+ activators. The emission bands around 590 nm could be ascribed to the 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 1 magnetic dipole transitions; the weak peak at 538.5 nm is related to transition from 5 D 1 to 7 F 1 . Meanwhile, the emission peaks located at about 618 nm are mainly due to the transitions from 5 D 0 to the sublevels of 7 F 2 energy level. The 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 transition is a forced electronic dipole-dipole transition and hypersensitive to the environment. And their high intensities are a consequence of the absence of an inversion symmetry at the Eu 3+ lattice site (D 2d symmetry) [23,24] . It is well known that the 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 transition is highly sensitive to structure change and environment effects. The difference of 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 emission peak in relative intensity was due to the difference of the effects of the crystal field perturbation on the individual f\u2013f transitions. On the basis of comprehension, the position of the predominant peak is associated with the microstructure. From the image in Fig. 10 a, it can be found that the obtained YVO 4 :Eu 3+ using 0.0125 M exhibits much lower emission intensity, which may be resulted from morphology of irregular and unshaped microspheres. When there is an increase of the Na 2 EDTA concentration to 0.025 M ( Fig. 10 b), the luminescence intensity of the uniform and smooth microspheres is the strongest one among them. This indicates that efficient transfer to the rare earth ions occurs. Fig. 10 c indicates that the luminescence efficiency will be decreased for the re-absorption and scattering of the plate-like shape phosphors. The emission spectra of the products obtained at 180 \u00b0C for different reaction times (6 h, 12 h and 24 h) of hydrothermal treatment are shown in Fig. 11 . All the emission spectra of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ powders show the similar features despite of the varying the reaction time. Upon excitation of 303 nm, the emission spectra are also associated with the transitions from the excited 5 D 0 level to 7 F J ( J = 1, 2, 3) levels of Eu 3+ activators. The emission intensity of the microspheres increased with increasing the reaction time due to the increase of the crystallinity and particles size, which is in good agreement with the XRD and SEM results. Therefore, by changing the morphology of powders, luminescence properties can be effectively adjusted. 0.025 M and 24 h are the effective surfactant (Na 2 EDTA) concentration and good reaction time, respectively, for the fabrication of well-dispersed Eu-doped YVO 4 microspheres. 4 Conclusions Well-dispersed YVO 4 :Eu 3+ microspheres were synthesized through disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate (Na 2 EDTA)-assisted hydrothermal method. XRD analysis shows that pure YVO 4 :Eu 3+ can be obtained at different pH values (1, 4 and 7) at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h. The effects of Na 2 EDTA concentration and reaction time of hydrothermal treatment on morphology and crystal size of final products were studied. SEM images reveal that Na 2 EDTA with concentration of 0.025 M is suitable for the fabrication of well-dispersed YVO 4 :Eu 3+ microspheres. This may be attributed to the formation of stable complex and ligand binding to the surface of the crystal with sufficient amount of ligand. The excitation and emission spectra of well-dispersed YVO 4 :Eu 3+ microspheres show the similar features despite of the varying Na 2 EDTA concentration and reaction time of hydrothermal treatment. The emission intensity increases with increasing the reaction time at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h owing to the increase in crystallinity and particle size of the as-synthesized powders. This method may be extended to synthesize other phosphors with controllable nanostructure.

The as-synthesized hollow YVO 4:Eu 3+ microspheres were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The obtained results showed that the morphology and size of the hollow microspheres have a strong dependence on the hydrothermal reaction time of the YVO 4:Eu 3+ powders. It is believed that the SDS-PEG clusters perform a function of dual soft-template that results in a unique template-induced secondary assembly in the one-pot synthesis of hollow YVO 4:Eu 3+ microspheres. The photoluminescence measurement revealed that the YVO 4:Eu 3+ powders with a spherical hollow shape have better red luminescence compared to the YVO 4:Eu 3+ solid microspheres. As a result, the controlled synthesis of hollow YVO 4:Eu 3+ microspheres not only has a great theoretical significance in studying the three-dimensional control and selective synthesis of inorganic materials but also benefits the potential applications based on hollow YVO 4:Eu 3+ microspheres owing to reducing the usage of expensive rare-earth elements. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The PL results indicated that the PL property of the GdVO4:Eu3+ phosphors was crucially impacted by the micro-structure and morphology. All the phosphors mainly showed strong red emissions at 615 and 618nm originating from the hypersensitive transition 5D0\u21927F2 of Eu3+ ions. The nano-sized phosphors showed prominent PL properties due to the grain size effect.

The XRD results showed that GdVO 4:Eu3+ with the tetragonal structure formed at pH < 13 as a single phase and Gd(OH)3 formed at pH \u2265 13 as a secondary phase. The SEM and TEM observations demonstrated the hydrothermally-induced morphological transformation of GdVO4:Eu3+ powders by altering the pH of the synthesis solution. The possible mechanism for the morphological transformation was proposed. The intensities of the prominent peaks at 618 nm in the PL emission spectra of GdVO4:Eu3+ powders considerably shift according to the specific morphology. The luminescence intensity of the octahedron- and rod-like GdVO4:Eu 3+ powders hydrothermally obtained at pH = 3 was the strongest one due to high packing density and high crystallinity as well as the extended reduction of the concentration of inherent defect states or adsorbed species. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The structure, morphology, and photoluminescent property of the final products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and photoluminescent (PL) spectra, respectively. It was found that the pure phase GdVO4:Eu3+ microcrystals with interesting shapes was fabricated at 180\u00b0C for 24 h in pH=1. Further, the fantastic morphological evolution was from microscale to nanoscale due to the pH value increasing. We obtained well-dispersed nanoflakes around 50 nm in pH=7 and 10. And sample synthesized in pH=10 had better crystallinity. In addition, the intensities of excitation and emission spectra were varied with the morphological change. The nanoflakes phosphors showed the strongest PL intensity comparing with other powders. Besides, the PL property was enhanced by crystalline state and size shrinking.",

        "abstract": "Nano- and micro-sized LiFePO4 powders were synthesized by a sodium gluconate (C6H11NaO7)-assisted hydrothermal synthesis method at 220 C for 10 h with pH = 2-7. The resulting powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The obtained data showed that the pH of synthesis solution played a key role in the formation of the LiFePO4 powders with different morphologies, such as ball-like microspheres, irregular microspheres with the agglomerated rods and particles, sphere-like nanoparticles and nano-ellipsoids. The results from electrochemical performance measurements revealed that the charge-discharge cycling characteristics of the samples were strongly dependent on their morphologies. In particular, the ellipsoidal LiFePO4 nanoparticles with the average size of 70-90 nm showed the highest initial discharge capacity of 150 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C rate, and cycling stability of the ellipsoidal LiFePO4 nanoparticles was optimum among all the samples prepared due to their dual advantages of high tap density and good diffusion property. The present study offers a simple morphology-controllable route, without carbon coating or doping with supervalent cations, to synthesize and to design high performance cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. ? 2013 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

The formation mechanism of Bi 1-x La x FeO 3 powders can be expressed by \"dissolution-nucleation-crystallization\" process. The magnetism of Bi 1-x La x FeO 3 increased with increase of La content due mainly to increscent suppressing spiral magnetic structure and magnetic contribution of La. \u00a9 2009 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The V8C7 particulates-reinforced iron-based metal matrix composite with 8-33\u00a0vol.% V8C7 was produced by infiltration casting process with subsequent heat treatment at 1164\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0h. With increasing the volume fraction of V8C7 in the composite, microhardness of the composite increases, while its impact toughness decreases. Relative wear resistance of the composite with different volume fractions of V8C7 was also investigated in this study. The composite with 24\u00a0vol.% V8C7 shows the highest relative wear resistance, which is much higher than that of gray cast iron. Microcracking, microploughing, and the fragmentation of particulates are found to be the dominant wear mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "In this study, Fe matrix reinforced with column-shaped WC-Fe composite was designed and fabricated by a novel in situ method. The WC-Fe/Fe composite exhibited a similar structure to that of reinforced concrete. The microstructure, microhardness, impact toughness, and wear resistance of the composites were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction, as well as microhardness, impact, and wear tests. Small amounts of graphite (G), \u03b1-Fe, and WC were the predominant phases in the reinforcing bar of the composites. WC particulates improved the wear resistance of the composite, and the highest wear resistance was 96 times higher than that of gray cast iron under a load of 20\u00a0N with SiC abrasive particles. The wear resistance mechanism involved protection of the matrix behind the WC bundles by hard carbides. The excellent fracture toughness of the composite was mainly attributed to the disappearance of G flakes from the Fe matrix because of the in situ reaction, which reduced the split action to the matrix. The matrix absorbed a large amount of the crack propagation energy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The novel Li 2 Fe 1/3 Mn 1/3 Ni 1/3 SiO 4 /C has been successfully synthesized by a feasible solution process in ternary system. The spherical carbon-coated composites are obtained using a heat treatment in the presence of sucrose. X-ray diffraction (XRD) diffractogram displays that the Li 2 Fe 1/3 Mn 1/3 Ni 1/3 SiO 4 /C crystallized in an orthorhombic structure with a space group of Pmn21. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mappings indicate that Fe, Mn and Ni elements are distributed homogenously in Li 2 Fe 1/3 Mn 1/3 Ni 1/3 SiO 4 /C nano-spherical particle with size less than 50\u00a0nm. The lithium storage capacity and cycling performance of the Li 2 Fe 1/3 Mn 1/3 Ni 1/3 SiO 4 /C presents good results when tested as cathode materials in lithium cells at room temperature. It delivers an initial discharge capacity of 181.4\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  and a discharge capacity of 172.9\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  after 20 cycles at 0.1C in the voltage range of 1.5\u20134.6V. Furthermore, it also exhibits an excellent rate capability with a capacity under different current densities of about 144.0\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  (0.2\u00a0C), 117.9\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  (0.5\u00a0C), 106.1\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  (1\u00a0C), respectively and a good capacity cycling maintenance of 153.7\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  after 60 cycles. Above results indicate that the spherical Li 2 Fe 1/3 Mn 1/3 Ni 1/3 SiO 4 /C becomes a very promising candidate for cathode material in lithium-ion batteries.",

It showed that 1 gelled long chain alkane, some of alcohol, kerosene, ethyl acetate benzene and toluene. Interestingly the gel of 1/kerosene possessed special property, which was that the mixture solution of the compound 1/kerosene heating for a while was put on the flat contact heater and formed a gel film at 25 \u00b0C and 65 \u00b0C. Unlike ordinary film, gel film had higher strength and toughness at 65 \u00b0C, by contrast other was fragile and broken easily at 25 \u00b0C, this phenomenon was few reported before. In order to explore the phenomenon, the mechanism of the gel of 1/kerosene was discussed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), High Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (H NMR), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (IR) and micro-rheology. SEM revealed that the xerogel of 1/kerosene assembled network through some long and thick fibers at 65 \u00b0C, with concentration reducing fibers become thin and its networks were clearly observed. In contrast the morphology of xerogel was porous at low concentration and was a bulk at high temperature system. According to EI data in micro-rheology, the gelation process could be divided into three stages at 65 \u00b0C and they could be that some cholesterol segments in the gelator interacting with each other formed some small aggregation in the first stage, and other cholesterol section of the gelator sufficiently were cross-linked with time and assembled into large assembly in the second plateau. In the final moment the large assembly build gel network and the system of gel tended to stable. But there are two stages at low temperature and could be some cholesterol segments that didnu0027t take part in assembly, which may be the cause that the performance of gel was fragile.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Improving the reaction kinetics of cathode and preventing the dissolution of polysulfides are two of the key strategies of developing the high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, we propose a multi-porous conductive architecture through bridging conductive TiN nanoparticle over the surface of CNT-S composite. The as-prepared TiN@CNT-S composite cathode delivers the superior initial specific capacity of 1269\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  at 0.05C and as high as 586\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  at 2C. The reversible capacity of the TiN@CNT-S composite cathode is about two times higher than the bare cathode without TiN conductive bridging at 1C over 400 cycles. A high areal capacity of 4.0\u00a0mAh\u00a0cm \u22122  was realized for the TiN@CNT-S composite cathode with a high areal sulfur loading of 5.4\u00a0mg\u00a0cm \u22122  at a current rate of 0.5C over 50 cycles. The enhancements in the electrochemical performances are mainly ascribed to the TiN bridged highly conductive structure; the formation of the strong chemical interaction of S-N-Ti bond for polysulfides trapping provided by the chemically polar TiN, which is verified by the ultraviolet visible (UV) spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses.",

In this work three different processes were employed to prepare three types of bamboo derived porous carbon materials. Among them, the sample prepared via a one-step activation method delivered the largest total pore volume (1.146\u00a0cm 3 \u00a0g \u22121 ) and the largest specific surface area (1824.4\u00a0m 2 \u00a0g \u22121 ) owning to a hierarchical porous structure. After the sample was used to encapsulate sulfur (S) to prepare carbon/S composite as cathodes for Li-S batteries. The composite loaded with 58.5\u00a0wt% S exhibited a high initial capacity of 1453\u00a0mAh g \u22121  at a rate of 0.1\u00a0C (1\u00a0C\u00a0=\u00a01675\u00a0mA\u00a0g \u22121 ). A reversible capacity of 255\u00a0mAh g \u22121  was maintained after 500 cycles at 1\u00a0C with a capacity decay rate of only 0.0016% per cycle. This suggests that the bamboo derived porous carbon could be a promising conductive carbon matrix for carbon/S composite cathodes in Li\u2013S batteries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   CaCO 3 -templating is a strategy for synthesizing porous carbon (PC) materials that has been widely used for decades. In this work, a modified template-removal process, soaking the pyrolysis product by hydrochloric acid solution, was proposed to optimize the graphitization degree, morphology, specific area, and pore size distribution of the products. The tests results demonstrated that the PC product obtained by a modified template method (M-TC) exhibited a transformation in microstructure such as an enhanced specific surface area and more plentiful hierarchical pores as compared with those PC materials obtained by conventional strategy. The potential formation mechanisms are proposed as well. When the M-TC sample loaded sulfur was applied as a cathode material for a Li-S battery, it delivered a high initial discharge capacity (1475\u202fmAh\u202fg \u22121)  and a stable discharge capacity (874\u202fmAh\u202fg \u22121 ) after 50 cycles at 0.1\u202fC. The modified template-removal strategy could bring inspirations on synthesis design and extend potential applications of commercial PC materials.",

In this study, organic terephthalate potassium (K 2 TP) was newly introduced as an advanced anode for low cost Na-ion batteries. After in-situ synthesized with suitable graphene (25%wt), the as-prepared K 2 TP-25G nanocomposite can exhibit remarkable specific capacity of 135\u202fmAh\u202fg \u22121  at 1\u202fC over 200\u202fcycles with stable capacity retention, which is superior to reported organic anodes for Na-ion batteries. The excellent electrochemical behaviors are ascribed to its stable and spacious lattice structure, the low solubility in common organic electrolyte of K 2 TP, as well as the formed K 2 TP-25G nanocomposite which can efficiently enhance the electronic conductivity and shorten the Na-ion pathway. These results are of importance to look insight into new organic electrode materials design for energy storage.",

Images of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) show that nano-sulfur (2\u201320\u202fnm) is wrapped by the transparent NSG nanosheets with wrinkled and folded features. The application of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the structure and composition of the obtained nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped graphene/sulfur (NSG/S) composites as well. The heteroatom doping content was controlled by adjusting the amount of thiourea. The XPS analysis results indicate that pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N are dominant among the product, thereby improving the cycle life of the lithium sulfur batteries. The NSG-4/S composites with sulfur loading of 68\u202fwt% exhibits a remarkably higher reversible specific capacity of 1583\u202fmAh g \u22121 , impressive rate capability, splendid specific discharge capacity of 819\u202fmAh g \u22121  at 0.1\u202fC after 100 cycles and long cycle stability of 640\u202fmAh g \u22121  after 200 cycles at 1\u202fC.",

In this presented study, bamboo-derived hierarchical porous carbon (BDPC) was adopted as a conducting substrate for containing S. Soft polystyrene (PS) and polyaniline (PANI), were prepared as coating layers. The main purpose is to figure out the specific roles that the polymer shells and the heteroatoms doped on polymer backbone play during cycles. The ternary products were characterized by structural analysis and electrochemical testing. The results indicate that, as compared to BDPC/S, the PS@BDPC/S electrode displays higher capacity retention during long-term cycles, especially at the high current rate. It is attributed to the integrated coating shell, which provides physical confinement and reserves spaces for restraining volume expansion. It is noted that the PANI@BDPC/S electrode presents a higher initial capacity, remarkable long-life performance, and excellent rate property. The outstanding performances are closely related to the nitrogen atom doped on PANI backbone, they provide not just abundant polar conducting sites for fast electron/Li-ion transport but strong chemical anchoring for restricting the migration of polysulfides. Therefore, our study poses a clearer understanding of the functionalized polymers used in Li-S battery.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   For the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries, the high areal capacity based on high loading sulfur cathode is urgently pursued. Herein, the electrochemical rate and cycling performance are significantly enhanced by the design of polar hierarchical-porous carbon container to confine sulfur species. The as-fabricated carbon container shows the following merits: providing an affordable pore volume of 4.94\u202fcm 3 \u202fg \u22121  for confining sulfur and releasing volume changes; facilitating rapid electron/ion transfer pathway; allowing efficient chemisorption of polysulfides by polar active sites synergistically. As a result, the cathode displays a high rate capacity of 581\u202fmA\u202fh\u202fg \u22121  at 8\u202fC and a stable cyclability at 2\u202fC. Importantly, the cathode with 7.2\u202fmg\u202fcm \u22122  sulfur loading presents a high areal capacity of 9.75\u202fmA\u202fh\u202fcm \u22122  at 0.05\u202fC and high rate performance. Up to 7.5\u202fmg\u202fcm \u22122 , the high loading cathode could still display a high areal capacity of 5\u202fmA\u202fh\u202fcm \u22122  at 1\u202fC after 80 cycles. Moreover, the container can successfully work in a pouch cell with low E/S ratio. These results show a promising way to promote the practical utilization of Li-S batteries.",

        "title": "Tunable hierarchical porous carbon aerogel / graphene composites cathode matrix for Li-S batteries",
        "abstract": "Abstract   It had been proven that carbon aerogel (CA) can effectively improve the conductivity of sulfur (S) and suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides in Li-S batteries, due to its outstanding electrical conductivity and micropore-rich structure. However, the microstructure of CA was easy to collapse and shrink during carbonization, resulting in a dramatically drop in specific surface area and porosity. Herein, graphene nanosheets (GNs) were introduced in CA to reinforce the structural stability. As-prepared CA/GNs composites were fabricated from in-situ polymerization of resorcinol (R) and formaldehyde (F) in graphene oxide (GO) solution. It was found that the mass concentration of the GO solution had a significantly positive effect on hierarchical porous structure of the CA/GNs composites, which presented improve the electrochemical performances due to the combination of micro-, meso- and macro-pores. It is worth noting that the CA/GNs0.1 sample, obtained from 10\u202fwt % GO solution, possessed the largest specific surface area of 665.477\u202fm 2 \u202fg \u22121  and the largest pore volume of 0.912\u202fcm 3 \u202fg \u22121 . Especially, after incorporated with moderate amount of S (58.86\u202fwt %), the CA/GNs0.1/S cathode exhibited the best electrochemical performances (initial discharging capacity of 1501\u202fmAh g \u22121  at 0.1C and reversible capacities of 471\u202fmAh g \u22121  after 100 cycles and 341\u202fmAh g \u22121  after 500 cycles at 1C). This was attributed to the tunable hierarchical porous microstructure of the CA/GNs0.1 sample. Unfortunately, when increased the S content to 68.39\u202fwt %, the electrochemical performance deteriorated in all aspects because of their sluggish reaction kinetics. These all results suggested that introducing GNs can feasibly enhance the performance of CA as matrix in Li-S batteries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The sulfonic acid group exhibits considerable ion affinity. The present work therefore synthesizes, a core-shell composite material having a sulfonated polyaniline shell, and a bamboo-derived porous carbon core loaded with sulfur. The thin, homogeneous shell has a thickness of approximately 20\u202fnm. This composite is employed as a cathode material in Li-S batteries and the electrochemical properties of these devices are systematically investigated. This cathode (containing 64.0\u202fwt% S) exhibits a higher initial discharge capacity (1484\u202fmAh g \u22121  at 0.1\u202fC), improved cycling stability (853\u202fmAh g \u22121  after 100 cycles at 0.1\u202fC), and remarkable rate performance (810.2, 682.7 and 353.0\u202fmAh g \u22121  at 2, 3 and 5\u202fC, respectively). These values are superior to those obtained using a polyaniline shell. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations are used to elucidate the internal mechanisms of the sulfonated polyaniline shell during cycling. The calculated results demonstrate that the shell possesses extremely high electron and Li ion conductivities, and so enhances the redox reaction kinetics during long-term cycling. It also physically confines and chemically anchors polysulfides, thus limiting the shuttle effect. This cathode design is expected to assist in the future commercialization of Li-S batteries.",

        "abstract": "Impact wear was carried out for annealed AISI1045 steel in this study. With the impact frequency of 600 times per min, an 8.29 kN impact load was applied on the constant contact area of 540.08 mm 2 at the individual attack angles 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. The microstructure of white layer for annealed AISI1045 steel was examined by SEM, TEM and HRTEM. It was found that nano structures with ferrite and cementite have been formed in white layer after impact of AISI1045 steel. Nano crystallization mechanism for ferrite is from moving, interacting and rearranging of dislocations, resulting in production of dislocation walls. With increasing strain, the density of pinned dislocations, whose Burgers vectors are usually vertical to the wall, correspondingly increases along the dislocation wall, i.e., \u03b8 / b increases. That, finally, forms subgrain boundaries with small angle \u03b8 . In addition, the density of slippery or shear-susceptible dislocations, whose Burgers vectors are often parallel to dislocation walls, also increases at the same time. The slipping of dislocations in many places along the boundary of subgrains will result in the rotation of crystals to form boundaries with large angles. Nano crystallized mechanism for cementite is mainly due to shearing fracture, neck-like shrinkage fracture and carbides dissolving under the impact. The cementite thinning and the formation of slipping stages will increase the surface energy per volume, which causes the dissolution of cementite. The chemical potential energy difference between carbon atoms and cementite is a driver for dissolving cementite. The moving, reacting and proliferating of dislocations promote carbon atoms diffusing and migrating to distant ferrite from the boundary of cementite, which accelerates the dissolution of cementite.

The wear rate, \u03c9, for the surface oxidation of specimens firstly decreases then increases with an increase of test temperature. The minimum value of wear rate occurred at 350-400\u00b0C. The intersection of \u03c9 -t curves for the surface hardness of CrMoWVCu and CrNiVCu changes from virgin to oxide layer as the temperature increases. The copper element in the PM materials is beneficial for the impact wear resistance. The experimental results are discussed in connection with the effects of alloy elements, properties of oxide layers and wear mechanisms.",

Dislocation reaction and recombination, as well as microtwin with high density play an important role in nanocrystallization. The interactions between twin and stacking fault, or dislocation and stacking fault result in the severe lattice distortion which induces the transformation of crystalline-amorphous structure. The increase in amorphous region corresponds to the decrease of the size of the nanocrystal grains.",

The effects of mineralizer concentration, reaction temperature and time on the phase evolution and crystal morphology of the resulting samples were investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) were used to characterize the as-synthesized samples. The experimental results revealed that a pure BiFeO3 phase could be formed at a temperature ranging from 170 to 190\u00b0C for 4-20 h in the presence of 0.03-0.12 M NaOH. It was found that the mineralizer concentration, reaction temperature and time played a key role in controlling the growing speed of nuclei and formation of BiFeO3 crystallites. The possible formation mechanisms of submicron BiFeO3 powders with different morphologies were presented. The magnetization of BiFeO3 powders showed a weak ferromagnetic behavior at room temperature. \u00a9 2010 Springer-Verlag.",

The organic additives employed were sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as an ionic surfactant, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and ethylene glycol (EG) as nonionic surfactants, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Na2EDTA) as an organic salt, and acetone as an organic solvent. The as-synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The experimental results demonstrated that the organic additives in the hydrothermal system played an important role in the formation of YVO4:Eu3+ powders with different morphologies and sizes, as follows: ellipsoids (SDS) \u2192 irregular microspheres (acetone) \u2192 inhomogeneous microspheres (EG) \u2192 uniform microspheres with the diameter of 4-5 \u03bcm (PVP) \u2192 uniform microspheres with the diameter of 1-3 \u03bcm (Na2EDTA). The luminescence properties were greatly affected by the morphologies and sizes of the as-synthesized samples. The highest emission intensity was observed in the sample hydrothermally synthesized with Na2EDTA due to the formation of uniform microspheres with less aggregation. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The obtained results show that the crystallinity, particle size and upconversion luminescence intensity of the as-synthesized NYFEY particles are gradually decreased as the Oxa 2\u2212 :RE 3+  molar ratio increases from 0.5:1 to 10:1. For the purpose of photoelectrochemical performance evaluation, the as-synthesized NYFEY particles with different morphologies are incorporated into the nanocrystalline TiO 2  films to form the multifunctional nano- and sub-micrometer composite photoanodes of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). A short-circuit current density ( J  SC ) of 14.26\u00a0mA/cm 2  and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.31% are obtained for DSSCs prepared with hexagonal rod-like NYFEY crystals, evidencing an increase of 29.8% compared with DSSCs prepared with only TiO 2  nanoparticles. The demonstrated synthesis approach for tailoring the morphology and size of NYFEY particles and enhancing the performance of DSSCs can also be applied for other types of solar cells.",

It has been regarded that the surface hardness of Hadfield steel has been increased greatly after shot peening. Using electron scanning microscope (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, the microstructure of shot penned surface layer was examined. It has been observed that a nanocrystalline surface layer is formed. The grain sizes of surface were decreased to 11.1\u201317.4 nm and the maximum hardened layer can reach to 100 \u03bcm after the treatment. Surface hardness was also increased with increasing shot peening period. Two-body and three-body abrasive wear experiments were carried out for work hardening and original specimens, separately. The results showed that the three-body wear resistance of the nanocrystallized Hadfield steel has distinctly been improved using soft abrasive particles. For harder abrasive particles like emery paper, the increased hardness and grain refinement by shot peening cannot improve two-body abrasive wear resistance.

The microstructure within the surface layer of the shot peening treated sample was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HREM). The grain size of 3-8 nm was obtained on the sample surface after 60 min shot peening. With the increase of shooting duration, the grains were refined and hardness increased in the treated sample surface. For the three-body abrasive wear, wear resistance could be improved after shot peening when glass particles served as abrasives, especially, the wear resistance of treated surface can be increased by 72% for 30 min shot peening duration. Nanocrystallization and surface hardening change the wear mechanism, and a lot of micro-cracks due to excessive shot peening lead to a weakened wear resistance.",

Theoretically, nanostructure formation thermodynamics becomes an important issue to coarse grains transformating into nanocrystalline. In the present paper, thermodynamics of strain induced nanosized microstructure in Hadfield steel after shot peening was discussed based on Pringogine's nonequilibrium thermodynamics and Miedema semi-experimental theory. It was concluded that the difference of Gibbs free energy should be at least increased to 0.1380 kJ/mol in the alloy system by strain hardening, compared to the previous Gibbs energy before the treatment.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV\u2013visible and luminescence spectrophotometers were applied to study the effects of pH values on crystallinity, morphology, optical and luminescence properties. The XRD results showed that the WO 3 + ZnWO 4 , ZnWO 4 , and ZnO phases could form after hydrothermal processing at 180 \u00b0C for 8 h with the pH values of 1, 3\u201311, and 13, respectively. The SEM and TEM observation revealed that the morphological transformation of ZnWO 4 powders occurred with an increase in pH values as follows: star anise-, peony-, and desert rose-like microstructures and soya bean- and rod-like nanostructures. The highest luminescence intensity was found to be in sample consisting of star anise-like crystallites among all the samples due to the presence of larger particles with high crystallinity resulted from the favorable pH under the current hydrothermal conditions. Keywords A. Inorganic compounds B. Chemical synthesis C. Electron microscopy C. X-ray diffraction D. Luminescence 1 Introduction So far, metal tungstates have been considered to be one of the most important inorganic materials. As a member of metal tungstates family, ZnWO 4 crystallizes in the monoclinic wolframite structure and has a high application potential in various fields as an X-ray, \u03b3-scintillator, microwave system, solid-state laser host, photocatalyst, gas and humidity sensors, acoustic and optical fibers, and magnetic material due to its unique characteristics, namely, high chemical stability, high average refractive index, high X-ray absorption coefficient, high light yield, short decay time, long afterglow to luminescence, etc. [1\u20133] . Recently, there have been a number of reports concerning the improvement of optical properties of ZnWO 4 by introducing rare earth ions [4\u20137] . Because the excited tungstate group may effectively transfer energy to rare earths and become potential phosphors. Owing to its molecular and electronic versatility, reactivity, and stability, ZnWO 4 has been explored as a promising environmental material for photodegradation of organic water pollutants [8,9] . Till now, various methods have been employed to fabricate ZnWO 4 , such as, Czochralski [10] , solid state [11] , solid-state metathetic [12] , sol\u2013gel [13] , aqueous solution growth [14] , polymerized complex matrix [15] , molten salt [16] , template [17] , microwave solvothermal [18] , self-propagating combustion [19] hydrothermal [20] , and hydrothermal followed by annealing [21] . Currently, controlling the size, shape, and dimensionality of micro- and nanostructures of inorganic materials is one of the most challenging issues. On the other hand, these factors can effectively influence the optical, chemical, and physical properties of a material [22] . As an eco-friendly aqueous process, hydrothermal technique has been found to be a powerful route in fabricating materials with well-controlled stoichiometry, precisely-tailored morphology, high crystallinity, and narrow particle size distribution at low temperature. It is well known that the above-mentioned characteristics of the material greatly depend upon hydrothermal synthesis parameters, viz., temperature, reaction time, template, etc. As Wang et al. [23] reported, the pH of the synthesizing system also plays a critical part in designing morphology of the final product since a solution pH mainly determines the chemical nature of the aqueous species. Chen et al. [24] hydrothermally synthesized low aspect ratio nanorods, high aspect ratio nanorods, and particles of ZnWO 4 at pH = 5, 7, and 11, respectively, and confirmed that the length of ZnWO 4 nanorods increased with an increase in pH value. Song et al. [25] investigated the effects of pH values on the formation of ZnWO 4 powders under the hydrothermal conditions in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as surfactant. The phase transformation and morphology change were observed with increasing pH value as follows: WO 3 at pH = 3, WO 3 + ZnWO 4 at pH = 5, irregular ZnWO 4 nanocrystals at pH = 7, and aggregated ZnWO 4 nanorods at pH = 9\u201310. It is still a significant interest to investigate the formation of ZnWO 4 powders with well-controlled stoichiometry and morphology in a wide pH range through a simple hydrothermal reaction without any templates. The role that the wide pH values play in crystallinity and optical properties of ZnWO 4 nano and microstructures has not been well appreciated. Herein we therefore report the synthesis of ZnWO 4 powders with different morphologies by a template-free hydrothermal process at low temperature in a wide pH range. The crystalline nature, morphology, optical and photoluminescence properties of the as-synthesized ZnWO 4 powders have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV\u2013visible and luminescence spectrophotometers, respectively. The advantages of the hydrothermal synthesis of ZnWO 4 powders with different morphologies under the current conditions are presented. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis All the reagents used in the present experiments were of analytical purity and used as received without further purification. The experimental procedure for preparing ZnWO 4 powders was as follows: 2.5 mmol ZnCl 2 was dissolved in 10 mL distilled water, and then 0.10 g citric acid was introduced into the solution and stirred for 5 min. Meanwhile, 2.5 mmol H 2 WO 4 was dissolved in 5 mL distilled water. The freshly prepared H 2 WO 4 solution was then mixed with the ZnCl 2 solution under vigorous magnetic stirring in order to obtain a white-colored precursor suspension. Afterwards, the pH of the precursor suspension was adjusted to 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 by the addition of either dilute hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide solution. Finally, the pH-adjusted precursor suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a filling capacity of 75% and maintained in an oven at 180 \u00b0C for 8 h. After the hydrothermal system was cooled down naturally to room temperature, the final products were collected, washed repeatedly with distilled water, filtered off, and dried at 60 \u00b0C for 4 h. 2.2 Characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a D/Max2550 diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) with monochromated CuK\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5) at 40 kV and 50 mA to identify the phases and crystal structures of the synthesized samples. The samples were scanned at a scanning rate of 2\u00b0/min in the 2 \u03b8 range of 10\u201370\u00b0. The particle size and morphologies of the final products were observed using a Quanta 200 scanning electron microscope (FEI, The Netherlands) equipped with an X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the as-synthesized samples were taken with a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Room temperature optical adsorption spectra were measured with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950 UV\u2013visible spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, USA) in the range of 200\u2013600 nm. The photoluminescence spectra of the synthesized powders were measured at room temperature using a Perkin-Elmer LS-55 spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, USA). 3 Results and discussion ZnWO 4 has the monoclinic wolframite structure with C 2h point symmetry and P2/c space group. It comprises infinite zigzag chains, running parallel to [0 0 1], of either edge-sharing ZnO 6 octahedron or edge-sharing WO 6 octahedra [26,27] . The crystalline structure and phase purity of the as-synthesized powders were first examined by X-ray diffraction. The influences of pH values of the synthesis solution on the formation of ZnWO 4 crystalline phase under hydrothermal process at 180 \u00b0C for 8 h are shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 a shows the XRD pattern of the powders hydrothermally synthesized at pH = 1, indicating that all the diffraction peaks can be readily indexed to the monoclinic WO 3 (JCPDS card no. 72-1465) and monoclinic ZnWO 4 (JCPDS card no. 88-0251). As can be seen in Fig. 1 b\u2013f, all the precipitated products obtained within the pH ranging from 3 to 11 can be well indexed to the pure monoclinic ZnWO 4 . The intensities of the identical XRD patterns increased gradually, which confirms the enhancement of the crystallinity. No peaks belonging to the impurity phases could be observed within a pH range of 3\u201311, demonstrating that pure ZnWO 4 powders with high crystallinity can be obtained under the current experimental conditions. The lattice parameters calculated from the XRD pattern, shown in Fig. 1 d, are a = 4.688 \u00c5, b = 5.721 \u00c5, and c = 4.936 \u00c5, which are compatible with the previously reported data ( a = 4.693 \u00c5, b = 5.721 \u00c5, and c = 4.928 \u00c5). It is noted that a further increase in pH of the synthesis solution to 13 leads to the formation of a pure hexagonal wurtzite structural ZnO (JCPDS card no. 36-1451) without impurity phases ( Fig. 1 g.). From the XRD results, it can be concluded that only the lowest (pH = 1) and the highest (pH = 13) pH values favor the formation of mixed WO 3 + ZnWO 4 and pure ZnO phases, respectively, rather than a pure ZnWO 4 phase. The morphology and size of the ZnWO 4 powders hydrothermally synthesized at 180 \u00b0C for 8 h with the pH in the range of 3\u201311 were further examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Figs. 2 and 3 show that the morphologies, dimensions, and sizes of the samples are strongly dependent on pH value of the synthesis solution. When the pH of the synthesis solution was adjusted to 3, large-scale star anise-like ZnWO 4 microstructures were formed, as shown in Fig. 2 a. The detail image of the structure is shown in a high-magnification SEM micrograph in Fig. 2 b, indicating that the microstructures possess unusual star anise-like shape with the diameter of about 10 \u03bcm. With gradually increasing the pH of the synthesis solution to 5, large-scale microstructures composed of irregular peony-like clusters with sparkly submicron-sized petals fanning out in all directions were obtained, as illustrated in Fig. 2 c. The peony-like clusters are in the size of <5 \u03bcm and submicron-sized petals have a thickness of about 200 nm ( Fig. 2 d). As the solution pH was increased to 7, lots of irregular desert rose-like microstructures with a diameter in the range of 3\u20135 \u03bcm were obtained. These microstructures consist of submicron-sized plates fanning out in all directions and having a thickness of about 300 nm ( Fig. 2 e\u2013f). Due to a small particle size and to understand the preferential orientation growth, samples were further studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), respectively. In Fig. 3 a, the TEM image of the ZnWO 4 powders hydrothermally synthesized at pH = 7 confirms that the sample is composed of desert rose-like microstructures with submicron-sized plates. Further insight into the submicron-sized plate was gained by HRTEM, as represented in Fig. 3 b. The lattice fringe of 0.236 nm in the observed submicron-sized crystallites agrees well the (2 0 0) lattice plane of monoclinic ZnWO 4 . As can be seen in Fig. 3 c, when the pH of the synthesis solution was increased to 9, soya bean-like nanocrystals with a length in the range of 20\u201350 nm and some rod-like nanocrystals with the size of <40 nm in width and <60 nm in length were formed. The HRTEM image taken on the edge of the soya bean-like nanocrystal is shown in Fig. 3 d. The lattice spacings of 0.375 nm match well with that of the (0 1 1) plane of ZnWO 4 . After adjusting pH to 11, the shapes of the soya bean- and rod-like nanostructures were completely transformed into the rod-like nanostructures ( Fig. 3 e) with a width of <40 nm and a length of <1 \u03bcm. Along with soya bean-like nanoparticles, there are a number of rod-like nanoparticles in samples hydrothermally synthesized at pH = 9. As previously reported [24] , nanorods with low aspect ratio were transformed into well-crystalline nanorods with high aspect ratio when pH was increased to 11. Our obtained results are consistent with this report, that is, soya bean- and rod-like nanostructures might grow along orientation to give well-crystalline nanorods with increasing pH to 11. Fig. 3 f shows the HRTEM image of ZnWO 4 nanorods and the lattice spacings of 0.47 nm and 0.57 nm corresponded to (1 0 0) and (0 1 0) planes of the ZnWO 4 monoclinic cell, respectively. It was evidenced that the lattice with an interplanar spacing of 0.47 nm was vertical to preferred growth direction, which was in agreement with the distance between the (1 0 0) crystal planes [9] . It could be inferred that the ZnWO 4 nanorods grew anisotropically along the [0 0 1] direction. The phase formation and crystal growth mechanisms in a synthesizing solution under hydrothermal process are complex, and the exact phase formation and crystal growth mechanisms remain as unclear. However, we can still speculate the influences of pH values on the formation of ZnWO 4 nano and microcrystallites under the current hydrothermal conditions on the basis of the obtained results. In this work, H 2 WO 4 was used as the tungstate source. The tungstate ions are sensitive to pH and therefore exist in different species in this experiment. In a strong acidic solution, H 2 WO 4 was hardly soluble at room temperature, and a yellow-colored amorphous precipitate was obtained. As the reaction solution pH was adjusted to 1, the yellow amorphous precipitate was directly transferred into tungsten trioxide by releasing water under hydrothermal treatment. A small amount of the yellow amorphous precipitate was dissolved under hydrothermal treatment to form W O 4 2 \u2212 ions, which would further react with Zn 2+ to form a small amount of ZnWO 4 along with WO 3 . When the reaction solution pH was controlled at 3\u20137, the hydrothermal processing accelerated the dissolution rate of the yellow amorphous precipitate, leading to the formation of the small primary ZnWO 4 nanoparticles. With the ongoing hydrothermal reaction, the primary nanoparticles further grew to the submicron-sized plates (petals), the freshly formed primary nanoparticles would spontaneously \u201cland\u201d on the as-formed submicron-sized plates (petals), and then underwent further growth to another plate (petal), forming complex flower-like microstructures. These processes could be related to a proposed mechanism of the so-called \u201corientated attachment\u201d by Penn and Banfield [28] and Banfield et al. [29] . When the pH of the reaction solution was further increased to 9\u201311, the tungstate ions existed in the form of W O 4 2 \u2212 while Zn 2+ ions reacted with OH \u2212 ions to form Zn(OH) 2 . Under the hydrothermal processing, the reaction velocity was increasing highly to dissolve Zn(OH) 2 precipitate. As the concentration of Zn 2+ and OH \u2212 ions exceeds the critical value, the precipitation of small primary ZnWO 4 nanoparticles begins. The released OH \u2212 leads to the increase of solution basicity and further influences the nucleation and growth rate of ZnWO 4 in the super-saturated hydrothermal system. The primary nanoparticles further grew to the nanorods by self-assembly at pH = 11. The process described here is of interest because it does not require any template, as mentioned before. Since the pH of the solution ranges from 1 to 13, the following reactions may occur during the hydrothermal treatment: ZnCl 2 \u2192 Z n 2 + + 2 C l \u2212 H 2 W O 4 \u2192 W O 3 + H 2 O Z n 2 + + W O 4 2 \u2212 \u2192 ZnWO 4 ( pH = 1 ) Z n 2 + + W O 4 2 \u2212 \u2192 ZnWO 4 \u2009 microstructures \u2009 ( pH = 3 \u2212 7 ) Z n 2 + + 2 O H \u2212 \u2194 Zn ( OH ) 2 \u2003 and \u2003 Z n 2 + + W O 4 2 \u2212 \u2192 ZnWO 4 \u2009 nanostructures \u2009 ( pH = 9 \u2212 11 ) Z n 2 + + 2 O H \u2212 \u2192 Zn ( OH ) 2 \u2192 ZnO + H 2 O \u2009 ( pH = 13 ) The size and morphology of the final product depend upon the competition between nucleation and crystal growth, which are determined by inherent crystal structure and the chemical potential in the precursor solution under hydrothermal process. The influences of the pH values on the hydrothermal formation of nano and microstructured ZnWO 4 powders were investigated by adjusting the reaction solution pH to the desired value by adding NaOH solution. As a result, star anise-, peony-, desert rose-, soya bean-, and rod-like ZnWO 4 micro and nanostructures were obtained at 180 \u00b0C for 8 h at pH = 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, respectively, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 . Based on our observations, the effects of pH values on the formation of ZnWO 4 crystallites with different morphologies can possibly be explained. The larger particles with star anise-, peony-, and desert rose-like morphologies were probably resulted from the aggregation of individual submicron-sized plates (petals) starting from the primary particle centers. The smallest nano building blocks were formed rapidly in the initial stages of the reaction and they subsequently aggregated into the submicron-sized plates (petals) to minimize the surface area. Under the hydrothermal reaction, these morphologies grew at the expense of the submicron-sized plates (petals) through an oriented attachment. Aggregation of the submicron-sized plates (petals) is energetically favored since the formation of larger crystals can greatly reduce the interfacial energy of primary nanoparticles and submicron-sized plates (petals). It is known that the larger particles are usually grown from small primary nanoparticles through an orientated attachment process, in which the adjacent nanoparticles are self-assembled by sharing a common crystallographic orientation and docking of these particles at a planar interface. Small particles may aggregate in an oriented fashion to produce a larger single crystal, or they may aggregate randomly and reorient, recrystallize, or undergo phase transformations to produce larger single crystals. This type of growth mode could lead to the formation of faceted particles or anisotropic growth if there is a sufficient difference in the surface energies of different crystallographic faces. However, it still requires further study to differentiate the exact formation mechanisms of anise star-, peony-, and desert rose-like ZnWO 4 microstructures. As mentioned above, when the pH of the reaction solution was increased to 9, small primary ZnWO 4 nanoparticles were formed. With increasing the alkali concentration in the hydrothermal treatment system to pH = 11, the dissolution rate of Zn(OH) 2 was further increased, the solution reached a super-saturation level, and accelerated a crystal growth rate compared to pH = 9. Further increase in crystal growth rates of the primary particles at high pH gives rise to the formation of highly anisotropic growth of nanorods. Compared to low pH, the tendency of crystal growth rate of primary nanoparticles to decrease at high pH could also be explained by the blocking action of OH \u2212 ions attracted on the primary nanoparticle surface, through the formation of an electric double layer. In addition, several other factors, including van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonds, crystal-face attraction, and electrostatic and dipolar fields associated with the aggregate, may also have the effects on the self-assembly of the ZnWO 4 nano and microstructures. Based on the obtained results, it is therefore believed that the hydrothermal formation of complex ZnWO 4 microstructures undergoes three main steps in the following order: (1) the dissolution rate of a yellow-colored amorphous precipitate, which leads to the formation of primary ZnWO 4 nanoparticles, (2) the primary ZnWO 4 nanoparticles accompany the oriented growth to form the submicron-sized plates (petals), and (3) a further growth and crystallization process, giving rise to the formation of the product with the 3D flower-like morphologies. Meanwhile, the hydrothermal formation of ZnWO 4 nanostructures can be considered as a result of the following stages: (1) formation and dissolution of Zn(OH) 2 , (2) formation of small primary ZnWO 4 nanoparticles, and (3) self-assembly of rod-like nanoparticles. It has already been demonstrated that the different crystal sizes and morphologies of the final ZnWO 4 powders may affect their light adsorption characteristics. The shapes of the optical adsorption spectra, shown in Fig. 4 , are almost identical despite their different morphologies, and they reveal that the stronger absorbance can be observed only in the UV region shorter than 400 nm for all samples. The optical data of ZnWO 4 powders synthesized at 180 \u00b0C for 8 h with different pH values ranging from 3 to 11 were analyzed at the near absorption edge using the equation \u03b1hv = A(hv \u2212 E g ) n /2 / hv , where \u03b1, v, E g and A are absorption coefficient, the light frequency, the band gap, and a constant, respectively [30] . Plot of ( \u03b1hv ) 2 versus hv is shown in Fig. 5 . According to the equation, the value of n for ZnWO 4 was equal to 1; this means that the optical transition for ZnWO 4 is directly allowed. It was already found that for W-based semiconductors the excitations are formed due to the transitions into the tungstate W 5d states hybridized with O 2p and possess a very strong tendency for self-trapping [26,31] . From the plot of ( \u03b1hv ) 2 versus hv , E g values are found to be 3.29, 3.40, 3.46, 3.43, and 3.34 for ZnWO 4 samples synthesized at 180 \u00b0C for 8 h at pH = 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, respectively, which shift to a lower energy in comparison with reported values for ZnWO 4 [31,32] . Clearly, this band-gap transition was resulted from the morphology change of the as-synthesized samples. However, ZnWO 4 powders show photoabsorption properties only in the UV region. Huang et al. [21] presented that the hybridized valence band of ZnWO 4 could have a strong ability to photocatalytic degradation of the organic pollutants. Fig. 6 shows the room temperature photoluminescence spectra of the ZnWO 4 powders synthesized at 180 \u00b0C for 8 h at pH = 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, respectively. The blue emission peaks of the samples are identically centered at the position of 475 nm, which originates from the wolframite structure of W O 6 6 \u2212 group [33] . No visible shift or broadening of the position of PL peaks was observed. As Wang et al. [34] described, WO 6 octahedral structure in ZnWO 4 is the luminescent centers, and a charge-transfer transition between the O 2p orbitals and the empty d orbitals of the central W 6+ ions in the W O 6 2 \u2212 complex is responsible for this luminescence. It is visible that the intensities of the PL spectra of the as-synthesized ZnWO 4 powders noticeably increase by morphological transformation in the following sequence: soya bean-like nanostructures at pH = 9 < rod-like nanostructures at pH = 11 < desert rose-like microstructures at pH = 7, peony-like microstructures at pH = 5 and star anise-like microstructures at pH = 3. The highest luminescence intensity can be found to be in sample consisting of star anise-like microcrystallites among them; this can be attributed to the presence of comparatively larger particles with high crystallinity resulted from the favorable pH under the hydrothermal conditions. It is known that the lattice defects may act as recombination centers for photoinduced electrons and holes, thus reducing the photocatalytic activity. In particular, crystal surface and subsurface layers can be a significant source of lattice defects. In our case, the non-linear variations on the photoluminescence intensity can be associated with the formation of superficial defects caused by the modifications on the morphology of the ZnWO 4 powders. According to He [6] and Huang et al. [21] , the extremely high crystallinity of the as-synthesized ZnWO 4 powders was the vital factor that affects the absolute luminescence intensity due to the improvement in crystalline defect; specific surface area was not consequentially associated with the photocatalytic activity [21] . In general, as the size of the as-synthesized particles is reduced to nanometer, both the fraction of atoms located at the surface and the surface area to volume ratio are increased. Supposedly, this might enhance the available surface-active sites and interfacial charge-carrier transfer rates, thus leading to higher photoluminescence yield [35,36] . However, the photoluminescence intensity was relatively decreased by decreasing the size of the as-synthesized ZnWO 4 powders. This can be explained by the increase in the number of surface defects and electron\u2013hole recombination rates [37] . As a key part of our work, investigation of the photocatalytic activity of ZnWO 4 powders with different morphologies for degradation of organic pollutants is in process. 4 Conclusions ZnWO 4 powders with different morphologies were synthesized by a template-free hydrothermal method at 180 \u00b0C for 8 in a wide pH range (3\u201311). It was found that the pH values had significant effects on the crystallinity, morphology, and phase evolution of ZnWO 4 powders under hydrothermal treatment. The XRD results confirmed the formation of WO 3 + ZnWO 4 , ZnWO 4 , and ZnO phases in the samples hydrothermally synthesized at pH = 1, 3\u201311, and 13, respectively. With increasing pH values from 3 to 11 under hydrothermal conditions, morphological transformation of ZnWO 4 powders was observed in the following order: star anise-, peony-, desert rose-like microstructures and soya bean- and rod-like nanostructures. Dissolution of yellow amorphous precipitate-formation of primary ZnWO 4 nanoparticles-formation of submicron-sized plates (petals)-oriented attachment could be considered as possible formation mechanism of ZnWO 4 microstructures. The formation and dissolution of Zn(OH) 2 -formation of small primary ZnWO 4 nanoparticles-self-assembly of rod-like nanoparticles could be considered as possible formation mechanism of ZnWO 4 nanostructures. Band gap values were found to be 3.29, 3.40, 3.46, 3.43, and 3.34 for ZnWO 4 samples hydrothermally synthesized at 180 \u00b0C for 8 h at pH = 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, respectively. The photoluminescence measurements revealed that the intensities of the PL peaks were noticeably affected by different morphologies of the ZnWO 4 powders and the highest intensity was found to be in the sample composed of star anise-like microcrystallites among all the samples due to the presence of larger particles with high crystallinity resulted from the favorable pH under the hydrothermal conditions.

        "abstract": "The Ca10V6O25 crystals with various morphologies were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method in a strong basic medium. The effects of the pH of synthesizing solution, hydrothermal reaction temperature and time on the morphology and crystallinity of Ca 10V6O25 powders were investigated. The as-synthesized powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, UV-vis spectrophotometer and vibrating sample magnetometer. The experimental results demonstrate that phase-pure Ca10V6O25 powders could be hydrothermally obtained at temperatures ranging from 120 \u00b0C to 180 \u00b0C for 12-48 h with the pH \u2265 12.5 of synthesizing solution. The morphology of Ca10V6O25 powders was strongly dependent on the synthesis parameters, such as pH, temperature and time. The Ca 10V6O25 microspheres were obtained at 180 \u00b0C for 48 h with the pH = 12.5 of synthesizing solution. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra have shown that the Ca10V6O 25 powders efficiently absorb UV light with an absorption edge at about 380 nm. All the samples noticeably exhibit a superparamagnetic behavior with a nearly zero magnetic remanence (remanent magnetization). The hydrothermally synthesized Ca10V6O25 powders may be employed as a potential candidate in novel electronic and biomedical applications. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Ti3SiC2 powder was fabricated using Ti, Si and TiC mixed powders by the mechanical activation assisted self-propagating synthesis method with the aid of Al. It is found that the mechanical activation process can reduce particle size to less than 10 \u03bcm, promote reaction activity and induce self-propagating reaction to form intermediate phases. The powder with single Ti3SiC2 phase can be synthesized below 1350\u00b0C with the Al addition and mechanical activation. The reaction mechanism is believed to be that Al acts as deoxidizing agent to boost Ti3SiC2 main phase synthesis by inhibiting oxidation of other elements. In addition, Al melts first in the reac-tants to form local tiny molten baths, which accelerates the diffusion of the reactants to form TiCx and Ti5Si3 intermediate phases, thus promoting the synthesis of Ti3SiC2 powder subsequently.",

The coatings comprised NbC and  \u03b1 -Fe phases. The thickness of the coating increased, and a diffusion zone was found below it with a prolonged heating time. The diffusion of carbon from the substrate plays a dominant role in the formation of the coating. Carbon diffused towards a thin niobium plate to react with niobium to sustain the growth of the NbC coating. Furthermore, the mechanical and tribological performances of the coating that was treated at 1085\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min were evaluated using the nanoindentation mode and the pin-on-disc sliding system, respectively. The microhardness was an average value of 22.4\u00a0GPa, which was 3.4 times that of the substrate. The compound coating exhibited a lower friction coefficient and wear rate compared with the substrate, indicating that it possesses a higher wear resistance and improves the tribological applications for the material surface. The surface morphologies of the worn samples revealed that the abrasive wear is dominant.",

        "abstract": "Li 2 MnSiO 4 /C cathode material was synthesized by a traditional solid-state reaction method with Li 2 SiO 3 and Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 \u00b74H 2 O as starting materials and sucrose as the carbon source. These materials were mixed and ground using a planetary miller and treated thermally at 800 \u00b0C for 12 h in an argon atmosphere. The heat treating procedure was estimated utilizing the thermogravimetric (TG) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis. The prepared powder was consisted of majority of Li 2 MnSiO 4 and minor impurities which were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) morphology shown that the product of Li 2 MnSiO 4 /C has smaller particle size (about 30\u201380 nm), which is beneficial for Li-extraction/insertion kinetics. The initial charge capacity of the Li 2 MnSiO 4 /C electrode material obtained via solid-state reaction is 256 mAh/g (about 1.5 Li + per unit formula extracted) and about 0.77 Li + per unit formula is reversibly exchanged in the first cycle at a rate of C/16. Keywords Lithium manganese silicate Cathode material Solid-state reaction Electrochemical performance 1 Introduction LiFePO 4 has been extensively studied as a potential cathode material for lithium ion batteries because of its low cost, environment compatibility, and long cycle life. However, the theoretical capacity of LiFePO 4 is limited to 170 mAh/g. In this context, the silicate family Li 2 MSiO 4 was focused on, as, at least in the principle, in Li 2 MSiO 4 (M = Fe, Mn, Co, Ni) there are two lithium ions per unit formula which can be extracted in one cycle and the theoretical capacities are more than 320 mAh/g. In this class of materials, the synthesis and cathode performance of Li 2 FeSiO 4 were first reported as an excellent candidate of cathode material by Nyten et al. in 2005 [1] . Subsequently, the electrochemical behavior of Li 2 MnSiO 4 prepared via a modified Pechini sol\u2013gel process was published by Dominko [2\u20134] . A solution route was adopted by Yang and co-workers to synthesize the Li 2 Mn x Fe 1\u2212 x SiO 4 solid solution material, and the best electrochemical property was obtained in case of x = 0.5 [5\u20137] . In the present work, Li 2 MnSiO 4 /C cathode material was synthesized via the traditional solid-state reaction method, and the morphology and the electrochemical performance of this material were investigated. 2 Experimental Li 2 MnSiO 4 /C powder was prepared by solid-state reaction using sucrose as the carbon source. Stoichiometric amounts of Li 2 SiO 3 and Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 \u00b74H 2 O were firstly ball-milled for 24 h in a planetary miller with a ball-to-powder weight ratio of 10:1 and a rotation speed of 200 rpm. After ball-milling, the powder was dried at 60 \u00b0C in a vacuum box for 24 h, and then pressed into pellets. The pellets were then sealed in a quartz tube and fired at 800 \u00b0C for 12 h within an inertia atmosphere and cooled to room temperature. The same process of Li 2 MnSiO 4 /C preparation was applied for Li 2 MnSiO 4 with out using sucrose. Thermogravimetric (TG) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis were performed for 26.3 mg of the mixture of Li 2 SiO 3 and Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 \u00b74H 2 O with a SDT Q600 instrument to investigate the material's thermal behavior from room temperature to 1000 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 20 \u00b0C/min within a nitrogen atmosphere. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded at ambient temperature using Rigaku-D/MAX-2400 diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation from 2 \u03b8 = 3\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 at a step of 0.02\u00b0. The morphology of materials were investigated by JSM-6700F Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) with EDS. Electrochemical experiment was performed using a coin-cell. The positive electrode was prepared using a mixture of active material (85 wt.%), conductive carbon black (5 wt.%) and poly-vinylidenefluoride (PVDF, 10 wt.%) dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). The slurry mixture was pasted on an Al foil, followed by drying at 120 \u00b0C for 12 h. The model test cells were assembled using lithium foil as an anode, 1 M LiPF 6 in 1:1 (volume ratio) ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as an electrolyte and Celgard 2400 membrane as separator in an argon-filled glove box. The charge\u2013discharge cycles were carried out at room temperature and a constant current density of C/16 with cut-off voltage of 1.5\u20134.8 V. 3 Result and discuss 3.1 Thermal analysis\u2014TG\u2013DSC Fig. 1 exhibits the results of simultaneous thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimeter of a mixture containing the starting materials of Li 2 SiO 3 and Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 \u00b74H 2 O in dynamic N 2 atmosphere. N 2 atmosphere is a protective gas frequently used for solid-state reaction. It will not react with the raw materials or the obtained Li 2 MnSiO 4 , even at high temperature, because in TG curve the weight of precursor sample was not changed anymore after 400 \u00b0C. This viewpoint can also be confirmed by the work of Khomane et al. [8] and Bellini et al. [9] . In the TG curve, it presents three steps of weight loss. The initial weight loss observed in the range of 45\u2013130 \u00b0C is ascribed to the process of dehydration that results from the Mn source, which obviously corresponds to the endothermic peak at around 120 \u00b0C in the DSC curve. Subsequently, the second weight loss in the temperature range of 250\u2013400 \u00b0C and a endothermic peak of 308 \u00b0C are shown, and it can be assigned to the decomposition of Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 . Finally, a slow and continuous decrease in weight of the mixture in the temperature range of 700\u20131000 \u00b0C may be attributed to the process of solid-state reaction, and at the same time there is an inconspicuous endothermic peak around 800 \u00b0C. In view of all, 800 \u00b0C was chosen as the final synthesis temperature. 3.2 XRD phase analysis The XRD pattern of the as-synthesized Li 2 MnSiO 4 and Li 2 MnSiO 4 /C powder are shown in Fig. 2 . A majority of reflectance peaks can be assigned to Li 2 MnSiO 4 phase, which have an orthorhombic unit cell in space group Pmn 2 1 . The lattice constants are a = 6.3109(9) \u00c5, b = 5.3800(9) \u00c5 and c = 4.9662(8) \u00c5 [2] . Five intense diffraction peaks are corresponding to the (0 1 0), (0 1 1), (1 1 1), (2 1 0) and (0 0 2) planes, respectively. However, a small amount of impurities at least MnO and Li 2 SiO 3 are detected in both cases, whereas the impurities of Li 2 MnSiO 4 /C sample are more than that of Li 2 MnSiO 4 . The obvious large peak widths indicate that the crystallite size is small. According to following Scherrer's equation: (1) \u03b4 = 0.9 \u03bb B \u2009 cos \u2009 \u03b8 where \u03b4 is the crystallite size, \u03bb is the X-ray wavelength ( \u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5) and B is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD peak in radians. The mean size of the Li 2 MnSiO 4 crystals are calculated to be about 45.2 nm and 36.5 nm correspond to the cases of Li 2 MnSiO 4 and Li 2 MnSiO 4 /C, respectively. The details of structural studies of Li 2 MnSiO 4 are being processed. 3.3 FESEM morphology analysis Scanning electron micrographs of Li 2 MnSiO 4 and Li 2 MnSiO 4 /C samples are shown in Fig. 3 a and b . The particle size of Li 2 MnSiO 4 ranges from 50 to 300 nm, and in the case of Li 2 MnSiO 4 /C that ranges from 30 to 80 nm. The smaller particle size and better size distribution of Li 2 MnSiO 4 /C are due to the presence of carbon, which hindered the growth of the Li 2 MnSiO 4 particles and covered them. The uniformity distribution of carbon in the final composite material can be seen from EDS mapping analysis of the whole area of Fig. 3 c shown in Fig. 3 d. 3.4 Electrochemical properties of Li 2 MnSiO 4 sample and Li 2 MnSiO 4 /C sample The electrochemical properties of the pristine Li 2 MnSiO 4 and the carbon coated cathode material were investigated. The initial charge/discharge cycles of Li 2 MnSiO 4 and Li 2 MnSiO 4 /C powder are shown in Fig. 4 a and b , respectively. A large irreversible capacity is found during the first cycle for both samples. For pristine Li 2 MnSiO 4 sample, during the first charge about 1 Li + per unit formula can be extracted from the pristine sample (i.e. charge capacity of 168 mAh/g), whereas only 0.29 Li + per unit formula can be inserted back during the following discharge (i.e. discharge capacity of 47.6 mAh/g). The sample coated by carbon demonstrates the first charge capacity value of 256 mAh/g, however, the discharge capacity only achieve 129 mAh/g. This indicates that the efficiency of first cycle is also low and the reversible and irreversible capacities are almost equal. It means that the electrochemical performance of Li 2 MnSiO 4 is partly increased by carbon coated and it can be farther improved according to the theoretical capacity of 333 mAh/g. The relative poor performance of both samples may be due to the impurities in sample and the unsuitability of carbon addition content. Thus, the optimum process parameters should be explored in the future through careful investigation. The cycle life of Li 2 MnSiO 4 /C at the C/16 rate to a cut-off voltage between 1.5 and 4.8 V is shown in Fig. 5 . The sample prepared by the solid-state reaction method yields a similar inferior cycle life, compared with the sample manufactured by means of the sol\u2013gel method [2] . After 10 cycles, the discharge capacity of Li 2 MnSiO 4 /C sample is only about 3.2 mAh/g. Beyond all doubt, it is significant to reveal the mechanism of capacity fading and improve its cycle performance. XRD [3,7] and ATR-IR [7] have been used to study the problem of material aging, and the results showed that the active material transfers from a crystalline state to an amorphous state after the first charge. However, the particular and causation of the collapse of the initial structure after first charge are not clear. 4 Conclusions Li 2 MnSiO 4 /C was synthesized by the solid-state reaction method. The temperature range of 700\u20131000 \u00b0C corresponds to the solid-state reaction, which is obtained from the TG and DSC curve. Characterization by XRD and FESEM shows that it has a Li 2 MnSiO 4 main phase and minority impurities and its particle size ranges from 30 to 80 nm. The Li 2 MnSiO 4 /C composite compound is found to exhibit electrode properties with a reversible capacity of 129 mAh/g at C/16 rate in the first cycle at room temperature. It is indicated that the specific capacity faded severely in 10 cycles. References [1] A. Nyten A. Abouimrane M. Armand T. Gustafsson J.O. Thomas Electrochem. Commun. 7 2005 156 [2] R. Dominko M.

In this family, the cathode performance of Li2MnSiO4 synthesized by solution route has been published recently. However, it seems that the cycle life of Li2MnSiO4 fell short of our expectation. In this work, the Li2Mn0.7Fe 0.3SiO4 cathode material was synthesized by traditional solid-state reaction method. The prepared powder was consisted of majority of LI2MnSiO4 and minor impurities which were examined by XRD. FESEM morphology showed that the products of Li2MnSiO4 and Li2MnSiO4 have similar particle size (about 50-300 nm). The electrochemical performance of Li2Mn0.7Fe 0.3SiO4, especially for reversible capacity and cycle life, exhibited better than those of Li2MnSiO4. \u00a9 (2009) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

        "abstract": "The Li2MnSiO4/C composite was synthesized through a polyol process following by heat-treatment at intermediate temperatures. The precursors were precipitated from Si(OC2H5)4, LiAc\u00b72H2O and Mn(Ac)2\u00b74H2O in ethylene glycol by refluxing at 196\u00b0C for 16h, the dried powders were milled, pressed and heat-treated at 500\u00b0C, 600\u00b0C and 700\u00b0C for 10h. The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, automatic elemental analyzer, field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS), and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). As a result of the Rietveld refinement, two possible Li2MnSiO4 forms crystallizing in Pmn21 and P121/n1 space groups, respectively, are considered as the major phases, and Li2SiO3 is identified as the impurity phase. According to the FESEM observation, the mean particle size increases from 5-20nm to 20-40nm as the heat-treatment temperature increasing from 500\u00b0C to 700\u00b0C. Carbon is homogenously distributed on the prepared Li2MnSiO4/C composites. The HRTEM examination confirms that the Li2MnSiO4 particles are surrounded by a very thin amorphous carbon layer. The electrochemical experiments reveal that the Li2MnSiO4/C composite heat-treated at 600\u00b0C for 10h has the higher electrochemical performance with an initial discharge capacity of 132.4mAh/g and a capacity retention ratio of 80% at the tenth cycle.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A NbC-Fe composite coating on an iron matrix was synthesized through one-step in situ synthesis using a pure niobium (Nb) plate and gray cast iron (HT300). The coating surface morphology, microstructure, and composition were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The synthesized NbC-Fe composite coating consisted of fairly agglomerated and uniformly sized (~\u00a0200\u00a0nm) NbC particulates accounting for 95% of the volume fraction. The coating thickness was ~\u00a060\u00a0\u03bcm. Coating nanohardness and elasticity modulus values were 20.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32\u00a0GPa and 438.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.38\u00a0GPa, respectively. Further, scratch testing, measured using a scratch tester under a progressive load of 0\u2013100\u00a0N, revealed no delamination or peeling over the tested loads. Therefore, the coating offered the iron matrix effective protection from serious abrasion. The present study discusses the synthesis of an excellent scratch resistant NbC-Fe composite coating on an iron matrix.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Solidification microstructures and compression properties of NiAl-32Cr-6Mo hypereutectic alloys containing different contents of Nb were investigated. The addition of Nb did not change the basic phase constituents, though a new phase of Laves Nb(Cr 1-x-y Ni x Al y ) 2  was observed. However, the primary Cr(Mo) phase no longer showed obvious dendritic morphology, the formation of lamellae was disturbed and the eutectic cellular microstructure degenerated. When the Nb content was 5%, eutectic lamellae coarsened and became spherical and poorly aligned. Fully eutectic microstructures were obtained in the directionally solidified hypereutectic alloys grown at 6\u202f\u00b5m/s regardless of the addition amount of Nb. With the increasing content of Nb addition, the volume fraction of Laves phase located at the NiAl/Cr(Mo) boundary became more. The yield strength of directionally solidified NiAl-32Cr-6Mo-3Nb alloy reached to 2072\u202fMPa, which is the highest value in the NiAl-based eutectic alloy at present. Well-aligned microstructure and more strengthening phase are conducive to the improvement of properties. All the alloys exhibited brittle quasi-cleavage fracture mode, cleavage in the NiAl phase and debonding of the NiAl/Cr(Mo) interface accompanied by Cr(Mo) lamellae and Cr 2 Nb phase pulled out were observed in the fracture surface.",

However, the commercialization of LSBs is still hindered by low sulfur utilization and poor cycling stability, resulting from shuttle effect and low redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Significant progress has been made over the years in enhancing the batteries performances and tap density with the transition-metal sulfides as sulfur host or additive in LSBs. In this review, we present the recent advances in the use of various nanostructured transition-metal sulfides applied in LSBs, and also focus on the interaction mechanisms of polar transition-metal sulfides with LiPSs and its catalysis for the redox of LiPSs. It may provide avenues for the application of transition-metal sulfides in LSBs. The challenges and perspectives of transition-metal sulfides are also addressed.",

        "abstract": "A series of banana peels derived porous carbon (BPPC) materials were fabricated by pyrolysis carbonization with different numbers of KOH activation. The Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller tests indicated the number of activation effectively improves the specific surface area and pore volume of the BPPC. Amongst, the BPPC-2 (activated twice) possesses ultrahigh specific surface area (2044.57\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u22121) and large pore volume (2.40\u00a0cm3\u00a0g\u22121) on account of the improved hierarchical porous microstructure. After S loading process, the resultant C/S composites were introduced as cathode material in Li\u2013S batteries. The S/BPPC-2 composite cathode exhibited a higher initial specific capacity (1481.54\u00a0mAh\u00a0g\u22121 at 0.1\u00a0C) and a better reversible capacity (351 mAh\u00a0g\u22121 after 300 cycles at 1\u00a0C) than those of others. It also exhibited excellent high rate performance even at 5\u00a0C. The enhanced electrochemical performances were ascribed to the improved specific surface area and larger pore volume of the BPPC-2, which effectively facilitated the intimate contact between sulfur and the conductive matrix, accommodating severe volume change. Besides, the micro/mesopores provided high adsorption power to inhibit the dissolution of polysulfides. This research suggested that the activation number played a key role in improving the electrochemical performance of composite cathode in Li\u2013S batteries.",

The p-type C2N/graphene bilayer, with direct band gap of 0.2 eV at \u0393-point, exhibits the promising electric conductivity similar to that of graphene monolayer. In addition, it also shows excellent lattice thermal conductivity of 1791.1 W/m\u00b7K, compared to 82.22 W/m\u00b7K of C2N monolayer. The theoretical capacity of C2N/graphene in Li-ion battery is found to be 490.0 mAh/g. For Li diffusion, the energy barriers for the energetically favourable diffusion pathways are found to be in the range of 0.2 eV ~ 0.5 eV for both C2N monolayer and C2N/graphene bilayer.

The iron matrix composites reinforced by both in-situ synthesis of WC particles and the residual tungsten wires were obtained. The microstructures of composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction,scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometer. The results indicate that,under the current of 15 A,with enhancement of electromagnetic field frequency,the amount of in-situ WCp gradually increases,and the amount of the residual tungsten wires continuously decreases. When the frequency reaches 5 kHz,tungsten wires can be reacted completely. The electromagnetic field can accelerate mass transfer and elemental diffusion in iron molten,and contribute quickly to form a series of small Fe-W-C ternary zones containing high tungsten content around the tungsten wires,and improve the kinetic condition of in-situ formation of WCp. The gaps among WCp synthesized play a role of the filter which can lower the elements diffusive rate.",

The results show that adding appropriate content Al can obviously accelerate the synthesis reaction, thus increase the purity of Ti3SiC2 powder up to 99.37wt%, and the feasible sintering temperature decreases from 1500 \u2103 to 1400 \u2103. The reaction mechanism is believed to be that Al can deoxidize oxygen from the starting mixtures, and molten early in the reactants to substitute few Si in the M3AX2 phase, which accelerates the synthesis of Ti3SiC2 powder.",

The microstructure of cold drawing 0.7%C steel by annealing treatment was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The tensile strength and microhardness of 0.7%C steel wires were measured. The wear properties of annealed 0.7%C steel was observed using two body abrasive wear test. The worn surface morphology was investigated by SEM. The results show that wear resistance of 0.7%C steel can be properly improved through annealing treatment when using alumina and quartz particles as abrasives. Using glass particles as abrasives, wear resistance of the steel is greatly improved after annealing treatment. Micro-cutting and plough are dominant mechanism when alumina and quartz particles were used as abrasives. In case of glass particles, grooving morphology disappears and the wear mechanism of the annealed steel changes.",

At the constant temperature difference, lowering operating temperature increases the divergence among the cell terminal voltages for the series pack and the cell discharging currents for the parallel pack. Increasing the temperature differences decreases the dischargeable energy of the series battery pack, while it affects little on that of the parallel. At the same temperature difference, the cell energy differences within the parallel battery pack are 5~10 times higher than that within the series, which makes the temperature uniformity claim of the parallel battery pack is higher than that of the series.",

        "abstract": "To obtain the compatible material of high hardness and high toughness, Hadfield steel matrix composites, reinforced by high-Cr\n cast iron bars made of flux-cored welding wires, which were inserted into the Hadfield steel melt, were investigated. The\n mechanical properties of three materials, i e, composites for as-cast and quenching-water condition, as well as Hadfield steel, were compared. The results show that the\n alloy powder inside flux-cored welding wires can be melted by the heat capacity of Hadfield steel melt and solidify into high-Cr\n cast iron bars. The impact toughness of the composite for quenching-water condition is higher than that of the composite for\n as-cast condition and is lower than that of the Hadfield steel, but it can still meet the requirements of hardness and toughness\n in industrial application. Regardless of load variation, composite for quenching-water condition shows better wear resistance\n than those of the composite for as-cast condition and Hadfield steel. The modified fracture toughness and wear resistance\n of composites are attributed to not only the combining actions of Hadfield steel matrix and high-Cr cast iron bars, but also\n the effect of heat treatment.",

        "abstract": "Magnesia (MgO) is widely used in the production of refractory materials due to its high melting point, high thermal shock,\n and excellent slag resistance. The properties of refractory materials depend upon magnesia sources and processing parameters.\n In this work, three different magnesium sources, namely, magnesium hydroxide concentrate, magnesium carbonate concentrate,\n and intermediate flotation concentrate, were obtained from the Zinelbulak talc-magnesite, Uzbekistan, by causticization-hydration\n and flotation processes, respectively. A series of refractory materials were prepared on the basis of these magnesium sources,\n and their effects on physico-mechanical properties and microstructures were investigated as a function of sintering temperature,\n molding pressure, and the particle size of magnesium sources. The experimental results showed that a refractory material obtained\n from the magnesium hydroxide concentrate at 1600\u00b0C for 4 h demonstrated favorable parameters due mainly to a higher degree\n of contact among fine particles. The results obtained from X-ray diffraction and optical microscopy confirmed the presence\n of periclase and forsterite as the predominant phases in refractory specimens. The prepared refractory materials meet the\n requirements of the State Standards (Nos.4689-94 and 14832-96) for magnesia and forsterite refractories, respectively. It\n is, therefore, suggested herein that the use of different magnesium sources derived from the Zinelbulak talc-magnesite will\n offer the potential to provide economic benefits in the refractory industry.",

Findings from previous individual studies regarding the effect of X-ray repair cross-complementing group 3 Thr241Met (XRCC3 Thr241Met) polymorphism on lung cancer risk remained conflicting and inconclusive. Thus, a meta-analysis of previous relevant studies was performed to estimate this effect more precisely and to shed some light on the contradictory findings. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were calculated to assess the correlation of XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism with lung cancer susceptibility. Stratified analysis according to ethnicity and sensitivity analysis was both conducted for further confirmation. Seventeen independent case-control studies involving 12,610 subjects totally were included into this meta-analysis. Overall, meta-analysis of total included studies showed that the XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism was not associated with risk of lung cancer in all genetic contrast models (OR Met allele vs. Thr allele = 1.01, 95 % CI 0.91-1.13, P OR = 0.810; OR Met/Met vs. Thr/Thr = 1.16, 95 % CI 0.88-1.54, P OR = 0.281; OR Thr/Met vs. Thr/Thr = 0.95, 95 % CI 0.86-1.04, P OR = 0.240; OR Met/Met + Thr/Met vs. Thr/Thr = 0.97, 95 % CI 0.89-1.06, P OR = 0.538; OR Met/Met vs. Thr/Thr + Thr/Met = 1.18, 95 % CI 0.91-1.52, P OR = 0.204). Stratified analyses in Asians and Caucasians showed similar results. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability and reliability of the findings. This meta-analysis of all available data did not support any appreciable association between the XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism and lung cancer risk in any populations.",

Treatment with metformin was also associated with activation of AMP kinase and inhibition of mTOR/p70S6K/pS6 signaling in both cells. However, inhibition of AMPK signaling has little impact on the anti-proliferative roles of metformin. In addition, we found USP7, a positive regulator of tumor suppressor p53, as a new molecular target of metformin. Esophagus cancer cells can be protected against metformin-induced growth inhibition by small interfering RNA against USP7.These results provide evidence for a mechanism that may contribute to the antineoplastic effects of metformin suggested by recent population studies and justify further work to explore potential roles for it in esophagus cancer prevention and treatment.",

        "abstract": "Background The prognostic role of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and phospho-STAT3 in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains controversial. To clarify its impact on survival, we performed a meta-analysis to quantitatively assess STAT3 and phospho-STAT3 expression on the prognosis of NSCLC. Methods Published studies were identified using a systematic and thorough literature search. To be eligible, a study had to investigate STAT3 or phospho-STAT3 expression rates of NSCLC patients in different characteristics and provide patient survival data. Results A total of 17 retrospective trials were chosen for meta-analysis, including 1793 patients. The estimated pooled log HR (0.67, 95%CI: 0.57-0.77) of 9 trials (STAT3: log HR 0.71, 95%CI 0.38-1.04; phospho-STAT3: log HR 0.67, 95%CI 0.56-0.77) for NSCLC was statistically significant (P < 0.0001), suggesting that high STAT3 or phospho-STAT3 expression is a strong predictor of poor prognosis among patients with NSCLC. For the risk factors, pooled analysis of patients with STAT3 positivity, demonstrated a statistically significant OR (3.82, 95%CI: 2.37-6.16) between poorly differentiated carcinoma and well-moderately, OR (5.68, 95%CI: 3.16-10.21) between stage III-IV patients and stage I-II patients, and OR (3.41, 95%CI: 2.12-5.49) between patients with lymph node metastasis and patients without lymph node metastasis. However, pooled analysis of patients with phospho-STAT3 positivity only demonstrated a statistically significant OR (4.51, 95%CI: 1.57-12.96) between poorly differentiated carcinoma and well-moderately (P < 0.05). Conclusions High STAT3 or phospho-STAT3 expression is a strong predictor of poor prognosis among patients with NSCLC. The conclusion should be confirmed by large prospective studies with long-term follow-up.? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Gefitinib is generally used in second- or third-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prognosis of gefitinib as second-line therapy or third-line therapy in advanced NSCLC. Methods: Medical records and follow-up information of 106 patients with advanced NSCLC were retrospectively reviewed. Sixty-two of 106 were treated with gefitinib as second-line therapy, and 44 were treated with gefitinib as thirdline therapy. Survival analysis was evaluated by using Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The two groups were comparable in gender (P = 0.51), age (P = 0.91), performance status score (P = 0.42), clinical stage (P = 0.18), smoking history (P = 0.95) and pathology (P = 0.99). The median overall survivals in the second-line and the third-line therapy groups were 24.0 and 21.0 months, respectively (P = 0.524). The median progression-free survival in the second-line therapy group was similar to that of the third-line therapy group (2.9 vs 3.2 months, P = 0.757). The response rates in the second-line and the third-line therapy groups were 17.7% and 11.4%, respectively (P = 0.665), and the disease control rates in these two groups were 48.4% and 54.5%, respectively (P = 0.822). The median overall survival of patients with disease control in the second-line therapy group was similar to that of the third-line therapy group (29.7 vs 22.2 months, P =0.611). The toxicities in these two groups are also similar. Conclusion: There is no obvious difference of response rate or survival benefit between second- and third-line therapies with gefitinib.",

Platelet count was monitored and compared with that in the previous treatment cycle (control cycle, CC).The lowest platelet count in the prophylactic rhTPO cycle was significantly higher than that in control cycle [(56 \u00b1 16) \u00d7 10(9)/L vs. (28 \u00b1 13) \u00d7 10(9)/L, P < 0.001]. The duration of thrombocytopenia was also shortened by the prophylactic rhTPO [(8 \u00b1 2) d vs. (12 \u00b1 3) d, P < 0.001]. The area under curve (AUC) of platelet count (21 days) was significantly increased [(3517 \u00b1 685) \u00d7 10(9)/L vs. (2063 \u00b1 436) \u00d7 10(9)/L, P < 0.001]. The time to platelet nadir and peak was not affected.Prophylactic use of rhTPO can attenuate the severity and shorten the duration of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia in lung cancer patients.",

Here we established anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive drug-resistant lung cancer cell lines, which are resistant to ceritinib (LDK378). We found that ceritinib treatment resulted in robust upregulation of SRC activity, as measured by the phosphorylation of the SRC substrate paxillin. Knockdown of SRC alone with siRNA effectively sensitized ceritinib resistance in ALK-positive cells. Furthermore, SRC inhibition by AZD0530 was effective in ALK-resistant cancer cells. Thus, ALK inhibition by ceritinib may lead to upregulation of SRC signaling, and AZD0530 could serve as a potential drug in the clinic to treat ALK-resistant lung cancer patients.",

However, there has been no head to head comparative study on the prophylactic administration of rhTPO and rhIL-11 to alleviate CIT in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  In this open-label prospective multi-center phase II clinical trial, 108 NSCLC patients who experienced severe CIT after prior chemotherapy were randomized into study and control arms. Patients in the study arm were prophylactically administered rhTPO on day 2, day 4, day 6 and day 9 of the subsequent chemotherapy cycle, while patients in the control arm accepted prophylactic rhIL-11 from day 9 to day 15 of the subsequent chemotherapy cycle.  During the trial, the median time required for recovery of the platelet count to \u2265 75 \u00d7 10/L was 3 days (range: 2-4) in the study arm and 4 days (range: 2-6) in the control arm ( = 0.398). The lowest platelet counts were 61.8 \u00b1 39.9 \u00d7 10/L in the study arm, values higher than those measured in the control arm 52.8 \u00b1 36.8 \u00d7 10/L ( = 1.044). Platelet counts < 50 \u00d7 10/L occurred in 46.2% of patients in the study arm vs 58.6% in the control arm ( = 0.368). There were no drug-related adverse reactions in the study arm, but 4 cases (12.9%) in the control arm ( = 0.008), especially cardiotoxicity ( = 0.022).  Prophylactic administration of rhTPO helps to alleviate CIT in NSCLC as well as rhIL-11, but is safer to use and more convenient to administer.",

        "abstract": "To mimic the electron-donor side of photosystem II (PSII), three trinuclear ruthenium complexes (2, 2a, 2b) were synthesized. In these complexes, a mixed-valent dinuclear Ru2(II,III) moiety with one phenoxy and two acetato bridges is covalently linked to a Ru(II) tris-bipyridine photosensitizer. The properties and photoinduced electron/energy transfer of these complexes were studied. The results show that the Ru2(II,III) moieties in the complexes readily undergo reversible one-electron reduction and one-electron oxidation to give the Ru2(II,III) and Ru2(III,III) states, respectively. This could allow for photooxidation of the sensitizer part with an external acceptor and subsequent electron transfer from the dinuclear ruthenium moiety to regenerate the sensitizer. However, all trinuclear ruthenium complexes have a very short excited-state lifetime, in the range of a few nanoseconds to less than 100 ps. Studies by femtosecond time-resolved techniques suggest that a mixture of intramolecular energy and electron transfer between the dinuclear ruthenium moiety and the excited [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photosensitizer is responsible for the short lifetimes. This problem is overcome by anchoring the complexes with ester- or carboxyl-substituted bipyridine ligands (2a, 2b) to nanocrystalline TiO2, and the desired electron transfer from the excited state of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ moiety to the conduction band of TiO2 followed by intramolecular electron transfer from the dinuclear Ru2(II,III) moiety to photogenerated Ru(III) was observed. The resulting long-lived Ru2(III,III) state decays on the millisecond timescale.",

        "abstract": "The coupling of electron and proton transfer is an important controlling factor in radical proteins, such as photosystem II, ribinucleotide reductase, cytochrome oxidases, and DNA photolyase. This was investigated in model complexes in which a tyrosine or tryptophan residue was oxidized by a laser-flash generated trisbipyridine-Ru(III) moiety in an intramolecular, proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction. The PCET was found to proceed in a competition between a stepwise reaction, in which electron transfer is followed by deprotonation of the amino acid radical (ETPT), and a concerted reaction, in which both the electron and proton are transferred in a single reaction step (CEP). Moreover, we found that we could analyze the kinetic data for PCET by Marcus' theory for electron transfer. By altering the solution pH, the strength of the Ru(III) oxidant, or the identity of the amino acid, we could induce a switch between the two mechanisms and obtain quantitative data for the parameters that control which one will dominate. The characteristic pH-dependence of the CEP rate (M. Sjodin et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000, 122, 3932) reflects the pH-dependence of the driving force caused by proton release to the bulk. For the pH-independent ETPT on the other hand, the driving force of the rate-determining ET step is pH-independent and smaller. On the other hand, temperature-dependent data showed that the reorganization energy was higher for CEP, while the pre-exponential factors showed no significant difference between the mechanisms. Thus, the opposing effect of the differences in driving force and reorganization energy determines which of the mechanisms will dominate. Our results show that a concerted mechanism is in general quite likely and provides a low-barrier reaction pathway for weakly exoergonic reactions. In addition, the kinetic isotope effect was much higher for CEP (kH/kD > 10) than for ETPT (kH/kD = 2), consistent with significant changes along the proton reaction coordinate in the rate-determining step of CEP.",

Excitation of the pheophytin moiety results in ultrafast electron transfer from carotenoid to the excited pheophytin, creating a long-lived charge-separated state. Two decay pathways of the formed pheophytin a anion radical are proposed. The first is a direct back electron recombination forming a carotenoid triplet state on the nanosecond time scale, while the other is suggested to occur via electron injection to the TiO2 nanoparticle. These results demonstrate that a self-assembled carotenoid-pheophytin system leads to an efficient reductive quenching of the pheophytin moiety, suggesting that a similar mechanism can operate also in natural photosynthetic systems. Moreover, the formation of a long-lived charge-separated state indicates that such self-assembling strategy may be also considered for novel dye-sensitized solar cell constructions and other artificial systems aiming to mimic the electron-transfer chain in natural photosynthesis.",

        "abstract": "The dynamics of photoinduced electron injection and recombination between all-trans-8'-apo-beta-caroten-8'-oic acid (ACOA) and a TiO(2) colloidal nanoparticle have been studied by means of transient absorption spectroscopy. We observed an ultrafast ( approximately 360 fs) electron injection from the initially excited S(2) state of ACOA into the TiO(2) conduction band with a quantum yield of approximately 40%. As a result, the ACOA(*)(+) radical cation was formed, as demonstrated by its intense absorption band centered at 840 nm. Because of the competing S(2)-S(1) internal conversion, approximately 60% of the S(2)-state population relaxes to the S(1) state. Although the S(1) state is thermodynamically favorable to donate electrons to the TiO(2), no evidence was found for electron injection from the ACOA S(1) state, most likely as a result of a complicated electronic nature of the S(1) state, which decays with a approximately 18 ps time constant to the ground state. The charge recombination between the injected electrons and the ACOA(*)(+) was found to be a highly nonexponential process extending from picoseconds to microseconds. Besides the usual pathway of charge recombination forming the ACOA ground state, about half of the ACOA(*)(+) recombines via the ACOA triplet state, which was monitored by its absorption band at 530 nm. This second channel of recombination proceeds on the nanosecond time scale, and the formed triplet state decays to the ground state with a lifetime of approximately 7.3 micros. By examination of the process of photoinduced electron transfer in a carotenoid-semiconductor system, the results provide an insight into the photophysical properties of carotenoids, as well as evidence that the interfacial electron injection occurs from the initially populated excited state prior to electronic and nuclear relaxation of the carotenoid molecule.",

The turnover number of this catalyst with Ce(IV) as the chemical oxidant was found to be ca. 1700.

        "abstract": "With the inspiration from an oxygen evolving complex (OEC) in Photosystem II (PSII), a mononuclear Ru(II) complex with a tetradentate ligand containing two carboxylate groups has been synthesized and structurally characterized. This Ru(II) complex showed efficient catalytic properties toward water oxidation by the chemical oxidant cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate. During the process of catalytic water oxidation, Ru(III) and Ru(IV) species have been successfully isolated as intermediates. To our surprise, X-ray crystallography together with HR-MS revealed that the Ru(IV) species is a seven-coordinate Ru(IV) dimer complex containing a [HOHOH](-) bridging ligand. This bridging ligand has a short O...O distance and is hydrogen bonded to two water molecules. The discovery of this very uncommon seven-coordinate Ru(IV) dimer together with a hydrogen bonding network may contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanism for catalytic water oxidation. It will also provide new possibilities for the design of more efficient catalysts for water oxidation, which is the key step for solar energy conversion into hydrogen by light-driven water splitting, the ultimate challenge in artificial photosynthesis.",

        "abstract": "Discovery of an efficient catalyst bearing low overpotential toward water oxidation is a key step for light-driven water splitting into dioxygen and dihydrogen. A mononuclear ruthenium complex, Ru(II)L(pic)(2) (1) (H(2)L = 2,2'-bipyridine-6,6'-dicarboxylic acid; pic = 4-picoline), was found capable of oxidizing water eletrochemically at a relatively low potential and promoting light-driven water oxidation using a three-component system composed of a photosensitizer, sacrificial electron acceptor, and complex 1. The detailed electrochemical properties of 1 were studied, and the onset potentials of the electrochemically catalytic curves in pH 7.0 and pH 1.0 solutions are 1.0 and 1.5 V, respectively. The low catalytic potential of 1 under neutral conditions allows the use of [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) and even [Ru(dmbpy)(3)](2+) as a photosensitizer for photochemical water oxidation. Two different sacrificial electron acceptors, [Co(NH(3))(5)Cl]Cl(2) and Na(2)S(2)O(8), were used to generate the oxidized state of ruthenium tris(2,2'-bipyridyl) photosensitizers. In addition, a two-hour photolysis of 1 in a pH 7.0 phosphate buffer did not lead to obvious degradation, indicating the good photostability of our catalyst. However, under conditions of light-driven water oxidation, the catalyst deactivates quickly. In both solution and the solid state under aerobic conditions, complex 1 gradually decomposed via oxidative degradation of its ligands, and two of the decomposed products, sp(3) C-H bond oxidized Ru complexes, were identified. The capability of oxidizing the sp(3) C-H bond implies the presence of a highly oxidizing Ru species, which might also cause the final degradation of the catalyst.",

Both complexes could promote water oxidation chemically and photochemically. Compared with other known ruthenium-based water oxidation catalysts using [Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6] (Ce(IV)) as the oxidant in solution at pH\u20051.0, complex 1 is one of the most active catalysts yet reported with an initial rate of 0.23\u2005turnover\u2009s(-1). Under acidic conditions, the equatorial 4-picoline in complex 1 dissociates first. In addition, ligand exchange in 1 occurs when the Ru(III) state is reached. Based on the above observations and MS measurements of the intermediates during water oxidation by 1 using Ce(IV) as oxidant, [RuL(pic)2(H2O)](+) is proposed as the real water oxidation catalyst.",

The effect of the ligands on electronic and catalytic properties is studied and discussed. The negatively charged ligand, bimpy(2-), has a remarkable influence on the electrochemical events due to its strong electron-donating ability. The performance in light- and Ce(IV)-driven (Ce(IV) = Ce(NH(4))(2)(NO(3))(6)) water oxidation is successfully demonstrated. We propose that ligand exchange between pic and H(2)O occurs to form the real catalyst, a Ru-aqua complex. The synthesis and testing of trans-[Ru(terpy)(pic)(2)(OH(2))](ClO(4))(2) (5) confirmed our proposal. In addition, complex 5 possesses the best catalytic activity among these five complexes.",

At low concentrations of Ce(IV) (5 mM), high turnover numbers of up to 4500 have been achieved. An (18)O-labelling experiment established that both O atoms in the evolved O(2) originate from water. Combined electrochemical study and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometric analysis suggest that ligand exchange between coordinated 4-picoline and free water produces Ru aquo species as the real water oxidation catalysts.",

The FTIR and XPS data gave the evidence that the surface photo-oxidation of XLPE increases, apparently, with increasing UV-irradiation time. The main photo-oxidation products have been identified as hydroperoxides and various carbonyl compounds. The photostabilization of XLPE can be carried out by suitable pre-irradiation of low-pressure mercury (LPM) lamp and by addition of hinder amine light stabilizers (HALS). The FTIR and XPS data also show that the optimum time of pre-irradiation of LPM lamp is 10 s under the experimental conditions of the present study. The addition of HALS into PE resin can protect the XLPE efficiently from surface photo-oxidation in the photocross-linking process of PE.",

At the same time, the resonance lines associated with Y-type long branches are also found to be significantly formed during the photoinitiated cross-linking of LDPE. The concentrations of H-links and Y-branches are estimated to be 5.7-16.9 and 7.6-21.6 per 10 000 carbon atoms, respectively, for the samples UV-irradiated for 5-10 s in the melt, indicating that Y-links also are effectively produced in the photoinitiated LDPE samples.

The fluorescence spectra from the PE and MD systems demonstrate that the main photoreduction product of BP (PPB) is benzpinacol formed by the recombination of two diphenylhydroxymethyl (K\u00b7) radical intermediates. The ESR spectrum obtained from the UV irradiation of the MD/BP system gives positive evidence of K\u00b7 radicals. Two new PPB products: an isomer of benzpinacol with quinoid structure, 1-phenyl-hydroxymethylene-4-diphenyl-hydroxymethyl-2,5-cyclohexa-diene and three kinds of \u03b1-alkylbenzhydrols have been detected and identified for the first time by 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy from the MD systems. The latter could be formed by the reactions of K\u00b7 radicals with alkyl radicals produced by hydrogen abstraction of the excited triplet state 3(BP)* from polyethylene or its model compounds. These results provide new experimental evidence for elucidating the photoreduction mechanism of BP in the photoinitiated crosslinking of polyethylene.",

PACS 84.37.+q 71.55.Eq 85.60.Gz Keywords Capacitance\u2013frequency characteristics Deep level GaN UV detector 1 Introduction The wide-gap GaN based semiconductor has become a basic material for new type optoelectronic and high temperature, high power, high frequency electronic devices [1,2] . Due to the huge market and economic profit, the material and device fabrication technique of light emitting device (LED, LD) have been greatly developed. Benefiting from the industrial interest in light emitting devices, more and more interest has been shown on the study of AlGaN UV detectors [3] . The n-type and p-type doping are essential for device fabrication. For GaN based material, Si is often used as a shallow n dopant. However shallow p dopants do not exist. Rapid progress was obtained when p-type conduction by Mg doping with appropriate post-treatment was achieved. But only a few percent Mg atoms can ionise as acceptors, most of them act as deep impurities [4] . The capacitance of a p\u2013n junction or Schottky junction containing deep impurities is strongly frequency-dependent [5,6] . The characteristics of deep levels in the space charge region (SCR) can be obtained by studying the relationship of junction capacitance vs. frequency. The space charge region is a key issue for device performance especially for photodetectors. Further studies of this aspect are still needed. In this paper the frequency dependence of small-signal capacitance of GaN p\u2013i\u2013n UV detectors has been studied. The Schibli\u2013Milnes model was used to analyze the capacitance\u2013frequency characteristics. The deep level concentration was evaluated using high frequency C \u2013 V measurements and plots of \u0394 V /\u0394( C \u22122 ) vs. C . The deep level is caused by the un-ionised Mg dopant. The activation energy of Mg and the hole thermal capture cross section of the deep level were also determined. 2 Experiment details The p\u2013i\u2013n UV detectors were fabricated on single crystal GaN films grown on 2\u2033 GaN buffered \u03b1-sapphire substrate by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The device structure is schematically shown in Fig. 1 . A thin low temperature GaN nucleation layer was first deposited. The carrier concentrations of 1 \u03bcm Si-doped n-type layer, 0.6 \u03bcm unintentionally doped layer and 0.15 \u03bcm Mg-doped p-type layer are 5 \u00d7 10 18 cm \u22123 , 10 17 cm \u22123 and 10 16 cm \u22123 respectively. This device structure is designed for front illumination. Standard photolithography and Ar + ion etching were employed to define mesa structures. The active region of each mesa is 100 \u03bcm \u00d7 85 \u03bcm, and junction area is 200 \u03bcm \u00d7 85 \u03bcm. Ni/Au was deposited and annealed in nitrogen to form p-type ohmic contact. N-type contact was In/Au. A SiO 2 layer was deposited to passivate the bare p\u2013i\u2013n junction, as shown in Fig. 1 . The device is a 64 \u00d7 1 linear photodiode array with a pitch of 100 \u03bcm. N-type contact is the share contact. A HP4275A LCR multimeter was employed to measure the capacitance of each element under different frequencies and different voltages. A special screen box was used to decrease electromagnetic interference. The device was zero-biased when testing its characteristics of capacitance vs. frequency. All measurements were carried out at room temperature ( T = 300 K). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Capacitance\u2013frequency model The frequency dependence of a p\u2013n junction including deep impurities arises from whether the charging and discharging of the deep impurities in the depletion region can follow the measuring frequency [8] . In general, analytic solutions of junction capacitance vs. frequency are very difficult to obtain. Final results on the junction admittance are usually achieved by numerical methods. In this way an accurate fitting of experimental results is possible in principle although a lot of transparency in the physical significance is lost [9] . Consequently, the approximate method (truncated space\u2013charge approximation or single-trap time constant assumption [6] ) is of value. When the deep impurity concentration is less than that of shallow donors or acceptors, the Oldham\u2013Naik model [6] can be used to describe the frequency dependence of the junction capacitance. When the deep impurity is the main dopant, however, the Schibli\u2013Milnes model [5] is applicable. Fig. 2 is the variation of mean capacitance with frequencies for 64-element linear detector array. (The non-uniformity of the device capacitance at different frequencies is less than 12%.) As the measuring frequency is increased, the capacitance decreases monotonously and does not reach a minimum value even at high frequencies indicating that the concentration of deep impurities in the depletion region may be very high. Considering the common p-doping problem of GaN, we believe the deep impurity may become the main dopant in the p-type layer. We use the Schibli\u2013Milnes model to describe this phenomenon, that is, the junction capacitance can be represented in the form of a series connection of two elements, C dc and C f , with C dc depending on the bias, but not on frequency, while the frequency dependent element C f is independent of the bias. For a n + p junction, the Schibli\u2013Milnes model [5] is expressed as (1) 1 C = 1 C dc + 1 C f (2) C f = A p \u03b5 e 2 kT 1 / 2 \u00d7 Re 1 + N T p 1 ( p + p 1 ) 2 \u00d7 1 - j \u03c9 \u03c4 1 + \u03c9 2 \u03c4 2 - 1 / 2 - 1 where the time constant of the deep level response \u03c4 = 1 / [ c p - ( p + p 1 ) ] ( p is the free hole concentration, p 1 is the free hole concentration when the Fermi level is at the deep level, and c p - is the hole capture probability of a negatively charged deep impurity), A is the junction area, \u03b5 is the dielectric constant, e is the electronic charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, N T is the deep level concentration, and \u03c9 is the angular frequency (2\u03c0 f ). Neglecting the free carrier concentration, expression (2) can be written as (3) C f = A e 2 \u03b5 kT 2 pN T ( p + p 1 ) f 1 f 1 / 2 where f 1 = 2 \u03c0 c p - p 1 . With the further assumption that p \u226b p 1 , which is almost always true because the Fermi level reaches the deep level in the depletion region, C f becomes (4) C f = A 2 e 2 \u03b5 kT N T f 1 f 1 / 2 It can also be expressed as (5) C f = A 4 \u03c0 e 2 \u03b5 kT N T c p - N v gf exp ( - E T / kT ) 1 / 2 where N v is the effective valence band edge, g is the degeneracy factor of the deep level and E T is the deep level. Then we use expressions (1) and (4) of the Schibli\u2013Milnes model to fit the mean capacitance of the 64-element linear detector array at different frequencies. The fitting result is shown in Fig. 2 . 3.2 Evaluation of deep level concentration Zohta pointed out that the conventional capacitance\u2013voltage method could determine impurity concentrations of semiconductor wafers in the presence of deep centers by using a plot \u0394 V /\u0394( C \u22122 ) vs. C [7] . (6) \u0394 V = ( e \u03b5 A 2 / 2 ) [ ( N D - N A + N T ) - ( N T \u03bb 0 / \u03b5 A ) C ] \u0394 ( C - 2 ) where \u0394 V is the dc voltage difference between two biases, N D is the donor concentration, N A is the acceptor concentration, \u03bb 0 is the distance from the position where the Fermi level equals the deep level to the SCR edge where the deep impurity is un-ionised. It is assumed that a test signal frequency of the capacitance measurement is so high that \u03bb 0 is independent of bias voltage. Thus, a plot \u0394 V /\u0394( C \u22122 ) vs. C gives a straight line, and N D \u2212 N A + N T is obtained from the intercept at C = 0. Fig. 3 is a typical C \u2013 V curve of the p\u2013i\u2013n device (pixel no. 14) at 5 MHz. The bias voltage varies from \u221213 V to 1 V with a step of 0.05 V. The reverse breakdown voltage of the device is larger than 15 V, and the turn-on voltage is larger than 2 V. According to the C \u2013 V curve in Fig. 3 , the plot \u0394 V /\u0394( C \u22122 ) vs. C is obtained, as shown in Fig. 4 . N D \u2212 N A + N T is obtained from the intercept by linear fitting. The N D \u2212 N A + N T value of pixel no. 14 is also shown in Fig. 4 . The N D \u2212 N A + N T mean value of the linear array is \u22122.98 \u00d7 10 20 cm \u22123 , and the sign \u201c\u2212\u201d represents its charge state in the SCR. 3.3 Discussion The free carrier concentration of the p layer is about 1/10 of that in the i layer and about 1/500 of that in the n layer resulting in the SCR being mainly in the p layer. Thus the device capacitance\u2013frequency characteristics are mainly determined by deep impurities in the p layer. The hole concentration of the p layer is only 10 16 cm \u22123 , so N D \u2212 N A + N T \u2248 N T \u2248 \u22122.98 \u00d7 10 20 cm \u22123 . The deep impurity is the main dopant of p layer, which agrees with the condition of the Schibli\u2013Milnes model. The deep impurity concentration obtained by this method is very high as is expected because the p layer is intentionally doped. Several research groups thought that the device capacitance\u2013frequency characteristics are determined by the deep level caused by Mg doping [4,8,10] . Mg acts simultaneously as a dopant and as a deep impurity. Only a few percent of Mg acts as dopant providing free holes for the valence band [4] . It seems that the capacitance\u2013frequency characteristics of our devices are caused by un-ionised Mg dopants. For GaN, Silicon is an effective shallow donor with activation energy of about 29 meV [11] . The doping efficiency of Si is much higher than that of Mg. In standard heteroepitaxial GaN/sapphire, with free electron concentration about 10 17 cm \u22123 , the density of deep levels reaches about 10 15 cm \u22123 [12] . It is more reasonable to attribute the high deep impurity about 2.98 \u00d7 10 20 cm \u22123 to the un-ionised Mg in the intentionally doped p-GaN layer. The hole concentration p is given by (7) p = N v exp [ ( E V - E F ) / kT ] The concentration of the occupied deep level is given by [4] (8) n T = N T 1 + g exp [ ( E T - E F ) / kT ] The temperature dependence of the hole concentration can also be expressed as [11] (9) p ( p + N D ) N A - N D - p = N v g exp [ ( E V - E A ) / kT ] where N A and N D are the total acceptor and donor concentrations, respectively, E A is the acceptor energy level. Here, we think the Mg level acts simultaneously as dopant and deep impurity and assume only one level exists. Then assuming n T = N A , E T = E A , N D = 1 \u00d7 10 17 cm \u22123 , N v = 1.74 \u00d7 10 19 cm \u22123 [11] , and g = 2 [13] the acceptor energy level E A (260 meV) is obtained by solving equations from (6)\u2013(9) . According to C f parameters obtained by fitting the experimental data shown in Fig. 2 , the hole capture probability of negatively charged deep impurity c p - can be calculated by using Eq. (5) , i.e. c p - = 3 . 58 \u00d7 10 - 15 cm 3 / s . The hole capture probability can be related with the hole thermal capture cross section by (10) c p - = v th p \u03c3 p - where v th p is the thermal velocity of holes. And v th p = ( 3 kT / m p \u2217 ) 1 / 2 , where the hole effective mass m p \u2217 = 0 . 8 m 0 [11] . Then the hole thermal capture cross section \u03c3 p - = 2 . 73 \u00d7 10 - 22 cm 2 . Kim et al. [10] reported the hole capture cross section of Mg-doped p-type GaN grown by molecular beam epitaxy was in the range of \u223c10 \u221220 cm 2 , which was measured by admittance spectroscopy. The difference of material growth techniques, material structures, and measurement methods may cause the deviation. Both their result and ours are very small. The deep impurity concentration obtained by the method of \u0394 V /\u0394( C \u22122 ) vs. C exceeds the carrier concentration of the n layer, which seems to deviate from the assumption of a n + p junction in the Schibli\u2013Milnes model. But the density of the deep impurities in the p\u2013i\u2013n UV detectors is so high as to give rise to the noticeable frequency dependence as shown in Fig. 2 . According to the material growth process, only Mg doping can cause so high a density of deep impurities. Although in static thermal equilibrium high-density deep impurity makes the SCR of GaN p\u2013i\u2013n UV detectors deviate the structure of n + p junction, the measurement of capacitance is a dynamic process at different frequencies. It is considered that there are no deep impurities in the i and n layers, and that the response of free carriers is fast enough. So the i and n layers can be regarded as metal-like layer in the dynamic process. Then the p\u2013i\u2013n junction is just like a Schottky junction in presence of deep levels. And the calculation of Schottky junction is the same as that of n + p junction in the Schibli\u2013Milnes model. We think that the analytic expression of the Schibli\u2013Milnes model can still be used to describe the capacitance\u2013frequency characteristics of GaN p\u2013i\u2013n UV detectors to good agreement. 4 Conclusions The frequency dependence of small-signal capacitance of p\u2013i\u2013n UV detectors, which were fabricated on GaN grown on a sapphire substrate by MOCVD, has been studied. We choose the Schibli\u2013Milnes model to analyze their capacitance\u2013frequency characteristics. According to the high frequency C \u2013 V measurement, the deep level mean concentration is about 2.98 \u00d7 10 20 cm \u22123 by using the method of \u0394 V /\u0394( C \u22122 ) vs. C . The deep level is mainly caused by the un-ionised Mg dopant. The calculated Mg activation energy is 260 meV and the hole thermal capture cross section of the deep level is about 2.73 \u00d7 10 \u221222 cm 2 . The applicability of the Schibli\u2013Milnes model is also discussed when the concentration of the deep levels exceeds that of the heavily doped n-side. It is concluded that the analytic expression of the Schibli\u2013Milnes model can still be used to describe the capacitance\u2013frequency characteristics of GaN p\u2013i\u2013n UV detectors to good agreement.

In this paper we describe the fabrication and characteristics of an UV 64\u00d71 focal plane array (FPA) based on front illuminated GaN p-i-n photodiodes. The diode structure consists of a base n-type layer of GaN followed by unintentionally doped and p-type layers deposited by metal organic chemical vapor deposition on GaN buffered sapphire substrate. Standard photolithographic, Ar+ ion beam etching, SiO2 passivation and metallization procedures were employed to fabricate the devices. I-V, responsivity and spectral response were tested. The linear photodiode array was indirectly hybridized to a silicon readout integrated circuit (ROIC) chip. The ROIC chip consists of capacitor feedback transimpedance amplifier (CTIA) input circuits, correlated double sampling (CDS) circuits, shift registers etc. The 64\u00d71 UV linear FPA was packaged into a 28-pin chip carrier. The response ununiformity is 1.86%. The mean detectivity is about 2.0\u00d7109cmHz1/2W-1.",

In this paper, in order to study the influence of the preamplifier on detector and amplifier system, the simulation experiments had been done with a preamplifier which made by separate transistors. Experiment indicates that the noise of input stage is main factor which leads to the decrease of the SNR of the detector, so appropriate amplifier which has certain noise performance should be selected to match the detector. And then, the conditions of the coupling in FPA between the detector with the direct injection (DI) circuit and capacitive transimpedance amplifier (CTIA) have been studied. The concept of the critical input resistance was put forward in this paper. Experiment indicates that the FPA will gain high injection efficiency only when the input resistance is lower than the critical value (106 \u03a9 for GaN p-i-n detector).",

Under zero bias, the peak responsivity of the device is about 0.022 A/W, and it increases to 0.19 A/W under 1 V reverse bias. The responsivity of the device is flat under a small forward bias, and two peaks appear at 283 and 355 nm when the forward bias is increased to 1 V. Based on the measurements and the polarization effect, the changes of carrier distribution are used to explain the working mechanism of this Schottky photodetector. The polarization effects can fundamentally affect the device response characteristics. Optimizing the device design and changing the bias can change the responsivity region and improve the peak responsivity of this Schottky ultraviolet photodetector.",

Light between 340-365 nm can be absorbed by i-layer by penetrating the p-AlGaN layer, so the quantum efficiency can be greatly enhanced. Then the effect of the p-AlGaN thickness on the characteristics of the detector is investigated, and two devices with different p-AlGaN thicknesses (0.1 \u03bcm, 0.15 \u03bcm) are fabricated. The measurements show that the p-AlGaN thickness can only affect the responsivity of 200-340 nm light, and the quality of the i-GaN layer can greatly affect the responsivity of 340-365 nm light. The device with 0.15 \u03bcm thick p-AlGaN has much higher quantum efficiency in the 340-365 nm range, and the zero-bias peak responsivity is about 0.214 A/W at 365 nm, corresponding to an external quantum efficiency of 85.6%. Moreover, this device exhibits a low dark current density of 3.16 nA/cm2 at zero-bias, which indicates that the device has a very high SNR.",

The Schottky device with this structure was fabricated and C- V measurement was made to verify the existence of the 2DHG and the validity of calculation results. Finally, the 2DHG effects on p-GaN/AlGaN/GaN Schottky photodetector were investigated. Due to the polarization and Stark effect, the spectral responses with the 10 nm blue shift are observed.

Nevertheless, it remains a practical challenge to find a cathode material of SIBs showing ideal performance (capacity, reversibility, etc.). We report here a nanocomposite material of amorphous, porous FePO(4) nanoparticles electrically wired by single-wall carbon nanotubes as a potential cathode material for SIBs. The hydrothermally synthesized nanocomposite shows excellent cell performance with unprecedented cycling stability and reversibility. The discharge capacity of as high as 120 mAh/g is delivered at a 0.1 C rate (10 mA/g). The capacity retentions are about 70 mAh/g, 60 mAh/g, and 55 mAh/g at higher currents of 20 mA/g, 40 mA/g, and 60 mA/g, respectively. Even at a 1 C rate (100 mA/g), a capacity of about 50 mAh/g is still retained after 300 cycles. With a simple synthetic procedure, cost-effective chemicals, and desirable cell performance, this method offers a highly promising candidate for commercialized cathode materials of SIBs.",

The C-NaFePO(4) electrodes are identical (particle size, particle size distribution, surface coating, and active material loading, etc.) to C-LiFePO(4) except that Li ions in C-LiFePO(4) are replaced by Na ions, making them ideal for comparison of thermodynamics and kinetics between C-NaFePO(4) cathode in sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries and C-LiFePO(4) in lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. In this paper, the equilibrium potentials, reaction resistances, and diffusion coefficient of Na in C-NaFePO(4) are systematically investigated by using the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV), and compared to those of the well-known LiFePO(4) cathodes in Li-ion batteries. Due to the lower diffusion coefficient of Na-ion and higher contact and charge transfer resistances in NaFePO(4) cathodes, the rate performance of C-NaFePO(4) in Na-ion batteries is much worse than that of C-LiFePO(4) in Li-ion batteries. However, the cycling stability of C-NaFePO(4) is almost comparable to C-LiFePO(4) by retaining 90% of its capacity even after 100 charge-discharge cycles at a charge-discharge rate of 0.1 C.",

        "abstract": "Nano-Sn/C composites are ideal anode materials for high energy and power density Li-ion batteries. However, because of the low melting point of Sn and the tendency of grain growth, especially during high temperature carbonization, it has been a significant challenge to create well-dispersed ultrasmall Sn nanoparticles within a carbon matrix. In this paper, we demonstrate an aerosol spray pyrolysis technique, as a facile and scalable method, to synthesize a nano-Sn/C composite with uniformly dispersed 10 nm nano-Sn within a spherical carbon matrix. The discharge capacity of nano-Sn/C composite sphere anodes maintains the initial capacity of 710 mAh/g after 130 cycles at 0.25 C. The nano-Sn/C composite sphere anodes can provide ~600 mAh/g even at a high rate of 20 C. To the best of our knowledge, such high rate performance for Sn anodes has not been reported previously. The exceptional performance of the nano-Sn/C composite is attributed to the unique nano-Sn/C structure: (1) carbon matrix offers mechanical support to accommodate the stress associated with the large volume change of nano-Sn, thus alleviating pulverization; (2) the carbon matrix prevents Sn nanoparticle agglomeration upon prolonged cycling; and (3) carbon network provides continuous path for Li ions and electrons inside the nano-Sn/C composite spheres.",

The interdigital spaces thus formed between individual rods effectively accommodated the volume expansion and contraction of the alloy upon sodiation/desodiation, while additional carbon-coating engineered over these nanorods further suppressed Sn aggregation during extended electrochemical cycling. Due to the unique nanohierarchy of multiple functional layers, the resultant 3D nanoforest of C/Sn/Ni/TMV1cys, binder-free composite electrode already and evenly assembled on a stainless steel current collector, exhibited supreme capacity utilization and cycling stability toward Na-ion storage and release. An initial capacity of 722 mA\u00b7h (g Sn)(-1) along with 405 mA\u00b7h (g Sn)(-1) retained after 150 deep cycles demonstrates the longest-cycling nano-Sn anode material for Na-ion batteries reported in the literature to date and marks a significant performance improvement for neat Sn material as alloy host for Na-ion chemistry.",

In this study, an antimony (Sb)/carbon (C) electrode with ~30 nm Sb nanoparticles (NPs) uniformly encapsulated in interconnecting one-dimensional (1D) 400 nm carbon fibers (denoted as SbNP@C) was fabricated using a simple and scalable electrospinning method. This binder-free, current collector-free SbNP@C electrode demonstrated high capacity and stable long-term cycling performance at various current densities. The SbNP@C electrode showed an initial total capacity of 422 mAh/gelectrode and retained 350 mAh/gelectrode after 300 deep charge-discharge cycles under 100 mA/gSb. Moreover, because of the efficient 1D sodium-ion transport pathway and the highly conductive network of SbNP@C, the electrode preserved high overall capacities even when cycled at high currents, extending its usability to high power applications.",

        "abstract": "Selenium-impregnated carbon composites were synthesized by infusing Se into mesoporous carbon at a temperature of 600 \u00b0C under vacuum. Ring-structured Se8 was produced and confined in the mesoporous carbon, which acts as an electronic conductive matrix. During the electrochemical process in low-cost LiPF6/EC/DEC electrolyte, low-order polyselenide intermediates formed and were stabilized by mesoporous carbon, which avoided the shuttle reaction of polyselenides. Exceptional electrochemical performance of Se/mesoporous carbon composites was demonstrated in both Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. In lithium-ion batteries, Se8/mesoporous carbon composite cathodes delivered a reversible capacity of 480 mAh g(-1) for 1000 charge/discharge cycles without any capacity loss, while in Na-ion batteries, it provided initial capacity of 485 mAh g(-1) and retained 340 mAh g(-1) after 380 cycles. The Se8/mesoporous carbon composites also showed excellent rate capability. As the current density increased from 0.1 to 5 C, the capacity retained about 46% in Li-ion batteries and 34% in Na-ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Carbonaceous materials have great potential for applications as anodes of alkali-metal ion batteries, such as Na-ion batteries and K-ion batteries (NIB and KIBs). We conduct an in situ study of the electrochemically driven sodiation and potassiation of individual carbon nanofibers (CNFs) by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The CNFs are hollow and consist of a bilayer wall with an outer layer of disordered-carbon (d-C) enclosing an inner layer of crystalline-carbon (c-C). The d-C exhibits about three times volume expansion of the c-C after full sodiation or potassiation, thus suggesting a much higher storage capacity of Na or K ions in d-C than c-C. For the bilayer CNF-based electrode, a steady sodium capacity of 245 mAh/g is measured with a Coulombic efficiency approaching 98% after a few initial cycles. The in situ TEM experiments also reveal the mechanical degradation of CNFs through formation of longitudinal cracks near the c-C/d-C interface during sodiation and potassiation. Geometrical changes of the tube are explained by a chemomechanical model using the anisotropic sodiation/potassiation strains in c-C and d-C. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the electrochemical reaction, microstructure evolution and mechanical degradation of carbon-based anodes during sodiation and potassiation, shedding light onto the development of carbon-based electrodes for NIBs and KIBs.",

        "abstract": "A new ruthenium bipyridyl complex, coded as YX360, incorporating a conjugated thienylvinylbipyridyl ligand, cis-Ru(dtbpy)(dcbpy)(NCS)(2) [dtbpy = 4,4'-di(thienylvinyl)-2,2'-bipyridyl; dcbpy = 4,4'-dicarboxy-2,2'-bipyridyl], has been synthesized and studied as a dye in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The new dye is compared to its precursor N719, which is one of the best ruthenium-based sensitizers known so far. In the dye YX360 the lowest metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) band is red-shifted by 10 nm and the molar extinction coefficient is dramatically increased as compared to N719. The reason can largely be attributed to the introduction of the extended \u03c0-conjugation unit to the ruthenium complex. Correspondingly, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of solar cells containing the dye YX360 show relatively higher values in the plateau region and a wider absorption spectrum relative to those of the dye N719. The effect is most pronounced for thinner TiO(2) films, for which comparable overall conversion efficiencies were obtained. However, as the TiO(2) film thickness is increased, DSCs containing N719 show superior conversion efficiencies. Although YX360 typically renders better short-circuit currents, the open-circuit voltage is suppressed because of larger electron recombination losses at the TiO(2)/dye/electrolyte interface. The results highlight that an extended aromatic ligand system in a sensitizing dye on the one hand improved light absorption, but on the other hand more efficiently loses photoelectrons through a recombination pathway via the dye to the electrolyte.",

        "abstract": "Aiming at highly efficient molecular catalysts for water oxidation, a mononuclear ruthenium complex Ru(II)(hqc)(pic)(3) (1; H(2)hqc = 8-hydroxyquinoline-2-carboxylic acid and pic = 4-picoline) containing negatively charged carboxylate and phenolate donor groups has been designed and synthesized. As a comparison, two reference complexes, Ru(II)(pdc)(pic)(3) (2; H(2)pdc = 2,6-pyridine-dicarboxylic acid) and Ru(II)(tpy)(pic)(3) (3; tpy = 2,2':6',2\"-terpyridine), have also been prepared. All three complexes are fully characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry (MS), and X-ray crystallography. Complex 1 showed a high efficiency toward catalytic water oxidation either driven by chemical oxidant (Ce(IV) in a pH 1 solution) with a initial turnover number of 0.32 s(-1), which is several orders of magnitude higher than that of related mononuclear ruthenium catalysts reported in the literature, or driven by visible light in a three-component system with [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) types of photosensitizers. Electrospray ionization MS results revealed that at the Ru(III) state complex 1 undergoes ligand exchange of 4-picoline with water, forming the authentic water oxidation catalyst in situ. Density functional theory (DFT) was employed to explain how anionic ligands (hqc and pdc) facilitate the 4-picoline dissociation compared with a neutral ligand (tpy). Electrochemical measurements show that complex 1 has a much lower E(Ru(III)/Ru(II)) than that of reference complex 2 because of the introduction of a phenolate ligand. DFT was further used to study the influence of anionic ligands upon the redox properties of mononuclear aquaruthenium species, which are postulated to be involved in the catalysis cycle of water oxidation.",

The complex mimics the function of the tyrosine(Z)() and chlorophyll unit P(680) in natural photosystem II (PSII). A ruthenium(II) tris(bipyridyl) complex covalently linked to a L-tyrosine ethyl ester through an amide bond was attached to the surface of nanocrystalline TiO(2) via carboxylic acid groups linked to the bpy ligands. Synthesis and characterization of this complex are described. Excitation (450 nm) of the complex promotes an electron to a metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) excited state, from which the electron is injected into TiO(2). The photogeneration of Ru(III) is followed by an intramolecular electron transfer from tyrosine to Ru(III), regenerating the photosensitizer Ru(II) and forming the tyrosyl radical. The tyrosyl radical is formed in less than 5 micros with a yield of 15%. This rather low yield is a result of a fast back electron transfer reaction from the nanocrystalline TiO(2) to the photogenerated Ru(III).",

        "abstract": "A survey was conducted to investigated the effects of the stress of heavy metal on superoxide dismutase(SOD),peroxide(POD)and total antioxidant capacity(TAC)in Porphyra yezoensis.P.yezoensis was cultivated for 6 d in seawater containing one of three kinds of metal ion,Cr6+,Pb2+ and Cd2+,with concentrations of 0 mg/L,10 mg/L,20 mg/L,30 mg/L,40 mg/L and 50 mg/L respectively.The activity of SOD,POD and TAC of P.yezoensis were increased at first and then decreased as the concentrations of metal ion increase,with the peak at 20 mg/L Cr6+,30 mg/L Pb2+ and 10 mg/L Cd2+,respectively.Based on the results of relative exponential analysis,POD is more sensitive to these three metal ion than SOD.TAC was the comprehensive index for measuring the antioxidant system function in P.yezoensis,while SOD and POD played a major role in adapting to the stress of heavy metal.In conclusion,Cd2+ has the strongest toxicity on P.yezoensis,followed by Pb2+,and Cr6+ the weakest.P.yezoensis is quite tolerable to heavy metal pollution.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous medical ozone injection in treating solid transplanted VX2 tumors in rabbits, and to discuss the histopathological changes cause by ozone injection. Methods: Transplanted VX2 tumor model was established in 24 rabbits. The rabbits were randomly divided into three groups. Rabbits in group A (n = 9) received medical ozone (40 \u03bcg/ml) injection of the tumor. Rabbits in group B (n = 9) received medical ozone (70 \u03bcg/ml) injection of the tumor. Rabbits in group C (n = 6, used as sham group) received no treatment. The serum AIT, AST and Cr levels were determined at one day before and one, three days after the treatment. All the animals were sacrificed at three days after the treatment. The specimens were collected and sent for pathological examination. After the procedure, careful observation of animal's vital signs, complications was executed, and the pathological findings were recorded. Results: After the treatment reduced activity, anorexia, slow in reaction and listlessness were seen in all animals within 24 hours. One rabbit in group A and one rabbit in group B died during the procedure or within one hour after the procedure. The serum AIT, AST and Cr levels determined at one day before and one, three days after the treatment showed no significant difference among the three groups (P > 0.05). Macroscopically and microscopically, the difference in the manifestations of necrosis area was not significant between group A and group B. In group C, microscopic examination revealed that some tumor cells broke through the muscle layer and invaded into the deeper tissue, the tumor cells were arranged in disorder with lots of cancer nests, and the nuclei became larger and hyperchromatic with fragmentation. Conclusion: For the treatment of transplanted VX2 tumor in rabbits, percutaneous injection of medical ozone with the concentration of 40 \u03bcg/ml or 70 \u03bcg/ml is safe and effective.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in treating osteolytic, osteoblastic, and mixed painful metastatic spinal lesions, and to discuss its complication and related technique. Methods: Single vertebra PVP was carried out in 148 patients with metastatic spinal tumor. The clinical data were retrospective analyzed. According to the preoperative CT manifestations the patients were divided into osteolytic group(n = 86), osteoblastic group(n = 15) and mixed metastatic group (n = 47). The fluoroscopic time used for operation, the amount of bone cement used in procedure and the bone cement leakage were recorded. The preoperative and postoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of patients in each group were determined. Results: The effective analgesic rate of the osteolytic, osteoblastic and mixed metastatic group was 81.4%(70/86), 80.0%(12/15) and 80.9%(38/47), respectively(\ufffd\ufffd2 = 0.019, P = 0.991, P > 0.05). The average fluoroscopic time of the three groups was (8.5 \ufffd\ufffd 1.9) min, (14.4 \ufffd\ufffd 2.5) min and (8.3 \ufffd\ufffd 1.7) min, respectively (F = 63.073, P = 0.000, P < 0.05). The amount of bone cement used in the three groups was (3.36 \ufffd\ufffd 0.96) ml, (2.60 \ufffd\ufffd 0.89) ml and (3.23 \ufffd\ufffd 0.94) ml, respectively (F = 4.126, P = 0.018, P < 0.05). Bone cement leakage rate of the three groups was 27.9% (24/86), 20.0% (3/15) and 25.5%(12/47), respectively (\ufffd\ufffd2 = 0.435, P = 0.804, P > 0.05). Conclusion: For the treatment of painful metastatic spinal lesions of different types, percutaneous vertebroplasty has satisfactory analgesic effect with fewer complications. As the manipulation of PVP in treating osteoblastic metastatic spinal lesions is relatively complicated, careful attention should be paid to the puncturing skill and the bone cement amount.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, methods of tunable Mach-Zehnder (MZ) modulator set-up in a Tunable Transmitter Assembly (TTA) have been investigated. Firstly the basic theory of the MZ modulator is introduced, and then there is discussion of MZ characterization in a Tunable Compact MZ modulator module (TCMZ). Secondly, dynamic control methods for accurately setting up the operating point for the MZ modulator during TTA AC test have been presented. Finally, detailed experiment results of a transmitter module with the method implemented have been analyzed. It demonstrates the methods improve application performance of the TTA. \u00a9 2009 SPIE-OSA-IEEE.",
