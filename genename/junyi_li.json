        "abstract": "Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy is a label-free, non-destructive analytical technique for biochemical analysis of macromolecular components within tissue samples. Cadmium (Cd) and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), a primary metabolite of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, are present ubiquitously in the environment and in organisms, and have adverse impacts on ecosystems and human health. Herein we employed ATR-FTIR analysis to identify biomolecular changes in rat liver, spleen, lung and kidney after prepubertal exposure to Cd and MEHP. Our results showed clear segregations between the 3 mg/kg Cd-, 10 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg MEHP- and binary mixture-treated groups vs. the solvent control group. Following principal components analysis coupled with linear discriminant analysis, biochemical alterations associated with different doses of Cd and MEHP were attributed mainly to lipids, proteins, phosphates and carbohydrates. In addition, the ratios of lipid/protein, C=O stretching/CH methylene (lipid oxidation level), amide I/amide II, α-helix/β-sheet and CH methyl/CH methylene (acetylation level) in target organs were affected by these toxicants. There seems to be no dose-response effect of Cd and MEHP on target organs. We observed hardly any joint toxic action of these toxicants. This is the first study showing the application of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy to the assessment of toxicity of Cd and MEHP. Possibly, destruction of cell membrane structure and integrity could be the common mechanism of Cd and MEHP toxicity in liver, spleen, lung and kidney.",

        "abstract": "To resolve the problem of redundancy and pretermission in the cluster-level testing due to errors of classes dependency relationship and classes message interaction, an algorithm for generating test cases of cluster-level based on classes dependencies reduction was proposed. Three classes dependency relations, i.e., inheritance dependency, aggregation dependency and association dependency, were defined by using the method for formalization, and a test model for cluster-level was constructed. An equivalence relationship in user interpretation set was built by generalized equation among some objects that were instantiations of the corresponding class. An algorithm named matching elimination was presented to obtain the maximal matching set of one or more classes equal to the maximal independency set of the corresponding class. An approach named interaction difference combination reduction was presented for computing the complement set of the maximal independency set of a class to get the minimum overlap set of the corresponding class, whose equivalency with the minimum dependency set of the corresponding class was proved too, and combination test cases and the interaction test sequences among classes were obtained.",

        "title": "Enabling Device to Device Broadcast for LTE Cellular Networks",
        "abstract": "In recent years, the public safety community has been aligning behind Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology as the basis for next generation public safety networks. Correspondingly, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards body has started multiple technical work initiatives on LTE enhancements to better support public safety use cases and requirements. Of particular importance to the public safety community is the addition of direct device-to-device (D2D) broadcast capability that can enable off-network push-to-talk (PTT) group communications in a manner equivalent to existing public safety communication systems. In this paper, we briefly explore the design objectives for, and challenges associated with, providing a D2D broadcast service. We then present and analyze a new distributed media access control (MAC) scheme for interference-aware coordination of both unicast and broadcast transmission. System-level simulation results are provided to validate the performance and the effectiveness of our approach, using a CSMA-based approach as a basis for comparison.",

        "abstract": "The biomolecular events resulting from the progression of hepatoblastoma remain to be elucidated. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopies are capable of noninvasively and accurately capturing the biochemical properties of biological tissue from its pathological status. Our aim was to probe critial biomolecular changes of liver accompanying the progression of pure foetal hepatoblastoma (PFH) by FTIR and Raman spectroscopies. Herein, biochemical alterations were both evident in the FTIR spectra (regions of 3,100-2,800 cm and 1,800-900 cm ) and the Raman spectra (region of 1,800-400 cm ) among normal, borderline and malignant liver tissues. Compared with normal tissues, the ratios of protein-to-lipid, α-helix-to-β-sheet, RNA-to-DNA, CH3 methyl-to-CH2 methylene, glucose-to-phospholipids, and unsaturated-to-saturated lipids intensities were significantly higher in malignant tissues, while the ratios of RNA-to-Amide II, DNA-to-Amide II, glycogen-to-cholesterol and Amide I-to-Amide II intensities were remarkably lower. These biochemical alterations in the transition from normal to malignant have profound implications not only for cyto-pathological classification but also for molecular understanding of PFH progression. The successive changes of the spectral characteristics have been shown to be consistent with the development of PFH, indicating that FTIR and Raman spectroscopies are excellent tools to interrogate the biochemical features of different grades of PFH.

The results indicated that the pore structure of resultant HPNCs could be tuned by changing the amount of iron catalyst, and those prepared with adding 7.1 wt% FeCl 3 ·6H 2 O showed the highest specific surface area (3155 m 2 /g) and largest hierarchical pore volume (2.2 cm 3 /g) with micropore and mesopore surface areas of 808 m 2 /g and 2347 m 2 /g, respectively, in addition to their high mesopore ratio up to 84.4%. The resultant HPNCs showed outstanding specific capacitance up to 455 F/g in 6 M KOH electrolyte solution at a current density of 0.5 A/g, a considerably high energy density of 93.6 Wh/kg and high capacitance retention of 95% after 5000 cycles. Moreover, they exhibited high adsorption capacities of 812.2 mg/g and 805.2 mg/g, for methylene blue and methyl orange adsorption, respectively, and high CO 2  adsorption capacity of 3.4 mmol/g at 25 °C and at an equilibrium pressure of 1 bar.",

        "abstract": "Epigenetic alterations, a well-recognized cancer hallmark, are driven by chromatin regulators (CRs). However, little is known about the extent of CR deregulation in cancer, and less is known about their common and specialized roles across various cancers. Here, we performed genome-wide analyses and constructed molecular signatures and network profiles of functional CRs in over 10 000 tumors across 33 cancer types. By integration of DNA mutation, genome-wide methylation, transcriptional/post-transcriptional regulation, and protein interaction networks with clinical outcomes, we identified CRs associated with cancer subtypes and clinical prognosis as potential oncogenic drivers. Comparative network analysis revealed principles of CR regulatory specificity and functionality. In addition, we identified common and specific CRs by assessing their prevalence across cancer types. Common CRs tend to be histone modifiers and chromatin remodelers with fundamental roles, whereas specialized CRs are involved in context-dependent functions. Finally, we have made a user-friendly web interface-FACER (Functional Atlas of Chromatin Epigenetic Regulators) available for exploring clinically relevant CRs for the development of CR biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Our integrative analysis reveals specific determinants of CRs across cancer types and presents a resource for investigating disease-associated CRs.",

Results show that overhead oxide changes into off-grade oxide of tantalum during electrolysis. The off-grade oxide of tantalum is not stable, so it combines metal ion to interphase of tantalite. When the content of oxygen in the interphase decreases to a certain level, the interphase will resolve to produce particles of 200~400 nm, which form cellular polymer by single stranded. The electrical property of tantalum powder with different electrolysis time was analyzed. The longer the time is, the bigger the capacity is.

LTE is an OFDMA system that crucially uses tight time and frequency synchronization between UEs and the base station for intracell and intercell interference coordination. For consistency with the cyclic prefix length and tone spacing used in LTE, we target an accuracy of a few microseconds for time synchronization and 150 Hz for frequency synchronization. We examine the problem both from a link and a system-level perspective. Link-level challenges involve designing a synchronization signal for computationally and energy efficient receiver algorithms, and system-level challenges involve achieving consistent timing using a distributed algorithm while leveraging the multiuser aspect of the problem to improve performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   β-SiC was synthesized by a microwave reaction method in Ar, using silicon powder and phenolic resin as raw materials, and cobalt nitrate as a catalyst precursor. The effects of temperature, time, and catalyst content on the formation of SiC were investigated. When 1.0–2.0 wt% Co was used as a catalyst, phase pure β-SiC was formed after 30 min at 1150 °C. This synthesis temperature was 100 °C lower than that required by the conventional heating route catalyzed by with the identical amounts of catalyst. When a catalyst was absent, the synthesis temperature of β-SiC was as high as 1250 °C even in the case of using microwave heating. β-SiC particulates were formed, along with some whisker-shaped β-SiC of 30–100 nm in diameter and up to 20 μm in length. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest that under the test conditions the formation of Co/Si alloy was energetically favorable, and played an important role in the Si Si bond breaking and the subsequent SiC formation.",

        "abstract": "Millimeter-wave MIMO systems are one of the candidate schemes for 5G wireless standardization efforts. In this context, the main contributions of this article are three-fold. First, we describe parallel sets of measurements at identical transmit-receive location pairs with 2.9, 29 and 61 GHz carrier frequencies in indoor office, shopping mall, and outdoor settings. These measurements provide insights on propagation, blockage and material penetration losses, and the key elements necessary in system design to make mm-Wave systems viable in practice. Second, one of these elements is hybrid beamforming necessary for better link margins by reaping the array gain with large antenna dimensions. From the class of fully-flexible hybrid beamformers, we describe a robust class of directional beamformers toward meeting the high data-rate requirements of mm-Wave systems. Third, leveraging these design insights, we then describe an experimental prototype system at 28 GHz that realizes high data rates on both the downlink and uplink and robustly maintains these rates in outdoor and indoor mobility scenarios. In addition to maintaining large signal constellation sizes in spite of radio frequency challenges, this prototype leverages the directional nature of the mm-Wave channel to perform seamless beam switching and handover across mm-Wave base stations, thereby overcoming the path losses in non-line-of-sight links and blockages encountered at mm-Wave frequencies.",

We found that the expression of these oncogenic lncRNAs is regulated by grade-specific expressed transcription factors. Based on the \"guilt by association\" rule, we predicted the potential functions of oncogenic lncRNAs, and the majority of these lncRNAs are involved in cancer hallmarks. Especially we found that CARD8-AS1 regulates the metastatic potential of glioma cell lines in vitro. Integrating clinical information, we identified the 12 protective and 8 risk lncRNAs (such as PWAR6 and CARD8-AS1) in glioma. Finally, an lncRNA-gene functional module was identified to be associated with the survival of patients. The predictive ability of this module signature was further validated in an independent dataset. Our results revealed the dynamic transcriptome transition during glioma progression, indicating that the lncRNA signature could be a useful biomarker that may improve upon our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying glioma progression.",

In total, 50 undergraduates (25 girls, 25 boys) participated in this experiment. It was found that the male participants used more verbs in the \"A man should__\" sentence string than in the \"One woman should__\" sentence string, and similar language patterns were found even after controlling for gender stereotypes. Individuals were found to more often attribute the individual behavior caused by cultural scripts to external situational factors; that is, if individuals agreed that another male's aggression was due to threatened manhood, this behavior was seen to be because of the male cultural script and was due to external circumstances. To test this view, a total of 56 college students participated in this experiment. In total, 25 college students (11 males, 14 females) took part in the attribution evaluation of two male fighters, and 31 college students (15 males, 16 females) participated in the attribution evaluation of two female fighters. It was found that the male participants believed that other male physical aggression that threatened their manhood was induced by situational factors rather than the internal characteristics of the attacker. The differences between the female participants were not significant, indicating that it was part of the male cultural script for men (rather than women) to defend or restore precarious manhood through aggression.",

However, effective and efficient data compression for genome sequencing data has remained an unresolved challenge in NGS data studies. In this paper, we propose a novel alignment-free and reference-free compression method, BdBG, which is the first to compress genome sequencing data with dynamic de Bruijn graphs based on the data after bucketing. Compared with existing de Bruijn graph methods, BdBG only stored a list of bucket indexes and bifurcations for the raw read sequences, and this feature can effectively reduce storage space. Experimental results on several genome sequencing datasets show the effectiveness of BdBG over three state-of-the-art methods. BdBG is written in python and it is an open source software distributed under the MIT license, available for download at https://github.com/rongjiewang/BdBG.",

        "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in the commercialization of millimeter wave (mmW) technology as a part of the Fifth-Generation New Radio (5G-NR) wireless standardization efforts. In this direction, many sets of independent measurement campaigns show that wireless propagation at mmW carrier frequencies is only marginally worse than propagation at sub-6 GHz carrier frequencies for small-cell coverage --- one of the most important use-cases for 5G-NR. On the other hand, the biggest determinants of viability of mmW systems in practice are penetration and blockage of mmW signals through different materials in the scattering environment. With this background, the focus of this paper is on understanding the impact of blockage of mmW signals and reduced spatial coverage due to penetration through the human hand, body, vehicles, etc. Leveraging measurements with a 28 GHz mmW experimental prototype and electromagnetic simulation studies, we first propose statistical blockage models to capture the impact of the hand, human body and vehicles. We then study the time-scales at which mmW signals are disrupted by blockage (hand and human body). Our results show that these events can be attributed to physical movements and the time-scales corresponding to blockage are hence on the order of a few 100 ms or more. Building on this fundamental understanding, we finally consider the broader question of robustness of mmW beamforming to handle blockage. Network densification, subarray switching in a user equipment (UE) designed with multiple subarrays, fall back mechanisms such as codebook enhancements and switching to legacy carriers in non-standalone deployments, etc. can address blockage before it leads to a deleterious impact on the mmW link margin.",

        "abstract": "There has been a strong interest in understanding hybrid precoding tradeoffs for millimeter wave (mmW) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. A common assumption in most of these works is that the analog part of the hybrid precoder can only be designed with phase shifters. The consequent search for analog and digital precoding matrices is solved with different black box-type optimization algorithms. In contrast, this work motivates an analog precoding structure at the base-station end that can be realized with both phase shifters and gain controls. Such a structure is necessary for interference management in multi- user transmissions and is easily realized with low complexity and cost. We then propose a feedback framework of the top-P beams over a beam alignment phase from each user. This framework allows the base-station to reconstruct the channel matrix between it and each user, and to manage interference with a simple zeroforcing solution. Such a structured solution is implemented with the amplitude and phase control of the analog part of the hybrid precoder. We finally illustrate the performance improvement with the proposed solution over simpler constructions such as beam steering that can be implemented with phase shifters alone.",

        "abstract": "Aluminum oxynitride (AlON) was commonly used in functional ceramic materials, including phosphors for white light-emitting diodes (LEDs). In the current work, a new polymorph of AlON structure, single phase [Mg1.25Si1.25Al2.5]O3N3, has been designed and synthesized via the solid-state reaction at a rather low temperature of 1550°C. Its crystal structure has been calculated using the Rietveld refinement. The [Mg1.25Si1.25Al2.5]O3N3 crystallizes in trigonal with lattice parameters of a=b=3.0312 Å, c=41.5758Å, V=330.83Å3, respectively, and it is formed by Mg2+ and Si4+ ions replacing partical Al3+ ions of Al5O3N3. The photoluminescence spectra of a series of Eu2+ doped [Mg1.25Si1.25Al2.5]O3N3 show a tunable light ranging from cyan to orange with a full-spectrum-covered emission and a wide excitation band with two peaks located at 290nm and 335nm. This is resulted from the two possible sites offered by the cation substitution for Eu2+ to occupy and thus broadening the emission spectra, which significantly enrich the monotonous luminescent properties of conventional AlON phosphors. Additionally, the energy transfer between the two sites has been identified by the decay curves and time-resolved emission spectra(TRES). The SEM and TEM characterization confirmed the sample's great crystallinity and the thermal stability with more than 85% of the initial intensity at 250°C further indicates its potential in white LED applications.",

        "abstract": "There has been substantial interest in understanding the impact of blockage for millimeter wave systems. The 3GPP standard proposes a flat 30 dB blockage model for hand (or self) blockage, and a double knife-edge diffraction (DKED) model-based loss estimation for other humans, vehicles, etc. The 30 dB flat model is based on horn antenna measurements which typically correspond to narrower beamwidths and the DKED model typically assumes omni-antenna measurements. In this work, using measurements from a 28 GHz experimental prototype with phased antenna arrays, we propose more realistic and considerably more optimistic models for hand and body blockage. We also study the time-scales over which millimeter wave links stay coherent and non-degrading due to Doppler and blockage dynamics. We show that dynamic subarray switching provides a reasonable solution to handle these impairments in millimeter wave systems.",

        "abstract": "The focus of this paper is on multi-user multi-input multi-output transmissions for millimeter-wave systems with a hybrid precoding architecture at the base station. To enable multiuser transmissions, the base station uses a cell-specific codebook of beamforming vectors over an initial  beam alignment  phase. Each user uses a user-specific codebook of beamforming vectors to learn the top-  $P$    (where   $P geq 1$  ) beam pairs in terms of the observed signal-to-noise ratio (  ${text{SNR}}$   ) in a single-user setting. The top-  $P$    beam indices along with their   ${text{SNR}}$   s are fed back from each user and the base station leverages this information to generate beam weights for simultaneous transmissions. A typical method to generate the beam weights is to use  only   the best beam for each user and either steer energy along this beam, or to utilize this information to reduce multi-user interference. The other beams are used as fall-back options to address blockage or mobility. Such an approach completely discards information learned about the channel condition(s) even though each user feeds back this information. With this background, this paper develops an advanced  directional  precoding structure for simultaneous transmissions at the cost of an additional marginal feedback overhead. This construction relies on three main innovations: first, additional feedback to allow the base station to  reconstruct  a rank-   $P$   approximation of the channel matrix between it and each user; second, a zero-forcing structure that leverages this information to combat multi-user interference by remaining agnostic of the receiver beam knowledge in the precoder design; and third, a hybrid precoding architecture that allows  both  amplitude and phase control at low complexity and cost to allow the implementation of the zero-forcing structure. Numerical studies show that the proposed scheme results in a significant sum rate performance improvement over naive schemes even with a coarse initial beam alignment codebook.",

Detailed group theory analysis has been provided to help understand the results of Raman spectroscopy and, as well, to classify the many peaks observed in Raman measurements. It has been found that shear force in SnSe 2  is lower than lots of other 2D materials, and this suggests that SnSe 2  may also play specific role in the field of lubrication or atomic-scale friction researches, for example, by acting as a new kind of superlubric material.",

A prospective study design was conducted. Patients completed the survey approximately 1 month and 1 year after surgery. A hierarchical linear model was used to examine the linear and the quadratic relationships between PTG and QoL. The interaction term of PTG and depression was included in the model to explore the moderating effect of depression. A quadratic relationship was found between PTG and QoL in the patients who had significant depressive symptoms. A linear relationship between PTG and QoL was found in the patients without significant depressive symptoms. In conclusion, PTG improved the patients' quality of life to some extent. The relationship between PTG and QoL in LGG patients depends on the level of depression.",

Currently, AVs rely primarily on line-of-sight sensing technologies to gather information about their surroundings. Some of the surrounding objects (e.g., vehicles, infrastructure, and pedestrians), however, can potentially communicate with the AV to help it create a better digital map of the world around it. In this work, we quantify the gains vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication can provide for AVs. Specifically, we focus on the safety and maneuver planning of the AVs. Our preliminary findings indicate that V2V can reduce a significant fraction of AV collisions. Further, V2V can considerably reduce the maneuver completion time.",

        "abstract": "The fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) technique is utilized to probe the photoluminescence properties of individual MoS2 flakes. This measurement allows identification of the layer number of the flakes: two fluorescence decay lifetimes (τ1 and τ2) exhibit linear relationships with the layer number. Our investigation of the fluorescence lifetime reveals exciton dynamics in monolayer and multilayers MoS2. We find the distinct difference on the decay rates between A exciton (fast) and B exciton (slow). K′/Γ emission has different decay behaviors with respect to the layer number (N) because of its variable energy in monolayer and multilayer samples. The interplay of these transition channels also plays an important impact on the overall decay. Our results demonstrate that FLIM is an effective measurement for studying the luminescence properties of transition metal dichalcogenides.",

Study 1 is a cross-sectional correlation study exploring the relationship between the video game team-play frequency and pro-social behavior, Study 2 is a 2 (game content: violent video game and neutral video game) × 2 (game context: single-play and team-play) design with the dependent variable being cooperative behavior and Study 3 is a single factor design experiment which examines the effect of the gaming experience on cooperative behavior under a collaborative context. The main findings were that the team-play frequency had a positive correlation with pro-social behavior, and pro-social video game exposure significantly predicted pro-social behavior. Collaborative play was found to significantly increase cooperation in both violent and neutral video games. However, the level of gaming experience tended to moderate the relationship between collaborative play and the level of cooperation.",

        "abstract": "Gene regulatory network perturbations contribute to the development and progression of cancer, however, molecular determinants that mediate transcriptional perturbations remain a fundamental challenge for cancer biology. We show that transcriptional perturbations are widely mediated by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) via integration of genome-wide transcriptional regulation with paired lncRNA and gene expression profiles. Systematic construction of an LncRNA Modulator Atlas in Pan-cancer (LncMAP) reveals distinct types of lncRNA regulatory molecules, which are expressed in multiple tissues, exhibit higher conservation. Strikingly, cancers with similar tissue origin share lncRNA modulators which perturb the regulation of cell cycle and immune response-related functions. Furthermore, we identified a large number of pan-cancer lncRNA modulators with potential clinical significance, which are differentially expressed in cancer or are strongly correlated with drug sensitivity across cell lines. Further stratification of cancer patients based on lncRNA-mediated transcriptional perturbations identifies subtypes with distinct survival rates. Finally, we made a user-friendly web interface available for exploring lncRNA-mediated transcriptional perturbations across cancer types. Our study provides a systems-level dissection of lncRNA-mediated regulatory perturbations in cancer, and also presents a valuable tool and resource for investigating the function of lncRNAs in cancer.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to gain insight into the sea level response to typhoon in the northern South China Sea using typhoon records from 1978 to 1997, simultaneous tidal gauge records and satellite altimeter along-track sea level data. We find that the ocean sea level response signatures in the deep water agree well with a single sea level soliton, of which the average soliton amplitude is (34 ± 6) cm and the average characteristic half width is (115 ± 12) km. Evolution of the single soliton as propagating across a shoaling bottom topography obeys solutions of the perturbed Korteweg and de Vries equation. The solutions reveal that forced by the hyperbolic-tangent-shaped topography, the single soliton evolves to a solitary wave packet consisting of a large leading soliton and smaller following waves in an oscillatory tail as approaching the shallow water. This phenomenon is verified by observed sea level signatures of 19 storm surges. The correlation coefficient between theoretical solution and observations is as high as 0.91. Meanwhile, the soliton amplitude grows with a soliton amplitude growth ratio (SAGR), which depends on the deep water and shallow water depths. However, without consideration of viscous effects, the SAGR model overestimates the soliton amplitude growth. Thus the vorticity equation for viscous fluid is adopted to solve this issue. The results indicate that turbulent viscosities are responsible to soliton amplitude decay concurring with the growth and causes dependence of the storm surge amplitude on the typhoon incident angle.",

        "abstract": "With the growing availability and popularity of virtual tourist communities,tourists are better able to relate their experiences,look for tour partners,and share tourism information in a free manner,which reflects the surprising combined power that tourists possess.This allows us to examine how tourists communicate with one another through the forum of a virtual tourist community.The authors chose an active virtual tourist community for a case study.Three distinct sets of research hypotheses formed the basis of our literature review: H1,the density of synchronous communication within a virtual tourist community is higher than in the general virtual community;H2,minority members hold the leading(core) position in the relationship network of community members;H3,in the synchronous virtual tourist community,the inside connections of a small group are much closer than outside.This study used density,centrality,community figure,and \"weak-link\" tests to analyze these hypotheses.The results demonstrated that the density of online connections in the synchronous virtual tourist community was 0.151,which was higher than in the general virtual community;the network centralization index was 2.76%,which indicated strong interaction among the members.The members of the whole virtual community were divided into eight small groups.However,no results showed that density within the small groups was greater than that among the groups.This means that both H1 and H2 were supported,but not H3.Thus,the results of this study suggest the following.(1) There are leaders inside the virtual tourist community,just as with a traditional community,in which there is a whole social group.However,the position of leader within the virtual tourist community depends on their active involvement and contribution.(2) Interpersonal communication among virtual tourist community members is frequent and is not confined to their own small group.The small closed group that exists in a traditional community is almost nonexistent in a virtual tourist community.(3) Minority core members can play an important role in a virtual tourist community,which is reflected not just in their power to control the transmission of information;it also has a significant influence on the tourism market.That is to say,the tourism decisions of the minority will have an impact on the majority of tourists,like leverage in tourism online marketing.(4) To develop a virtual tourist community,it is necessary to establish an incentive system,train experienced tourists,and encourage the sharing of information to create a more harmonious community relationship.(5) In the process of marketing,attention should be paid to the few core members of a virtual tourist community because their tourism decision making acts as leverage and affects most of the other tourists.Finally,some characteristics of a mature virtual tourist community were identified in this study.These included a information exchange among members,interaction not being limited to members of a specific group,and minority core members always leading discussions and activities in the virtual community.",

        "abstract": "Given the cost and complexity associated with the deployment of a large number of radio frequency (RF) chains in millimeter wave (mmW) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, this paper addresses the question of network efficiency considerations for hybrid precoding. We first establish the relevance of directional precoding structures as a low-complexity and robust solution to meet the data rate demands of single-user MIMO systems relative to the more complex and less robust eigen-mode-based precoding structures. Key to the relevance of the directional precoding structures is the sparsity of the mmW channel coupled with higher antenna dimensionality affordable due to smaller wavelengths. We then leverage the directional structure of the channel to propose a simple class of directional schedulers that offers a low-complexity and yet approximately fair separation plane in the user space. We then compare the performance of single-user precoding schemes with multi-user precoding schemes and show that from network efficiency considerations, it would be more worthwhile to expend the RF chain resource on multi-user transmissions.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to examine the influencing factors of tourists flow with factor analysis,ANOVA and Pearson correlation analysis from the Push-pull theory perspective.The authors provide a case study of inbound tourists from the U.S.A.The results are as follows.First,the paper identified three push factors do-mains including keeping health,having social intercourse,seeking novelty,gaining knowledge,and employ-ment.Novelty seeking and knowledge gaining are the most important cause for their travel(typical value=4.17),which indicts that the American inbound tourists wanted to seek novelty and know more about China.And two pull factor domains including outside attraction and inside attraction of scenic spots.The latter one is more important and it shows the high quality;second,the authors examine the push and pull factors which are influenced by the social-demographic variables.The finding reveals that the factors are different for differ-ent groups,and the managers of destinations should take corresponding measures for different groups to satis-fy the tourists' needs and increasing revisiting rate;Third,the authors examine the interrelationships among the push and pull factors domains and find that pull and push are not isolated,the \"outside attraction of scenic spots\" of pull has positive correlation with \"keeping health and having social intercourse\" and \"novelty seek-ing and knowledge gaining\",and the weak correlations with \"employment\",the correlation also exists be-tween \"inside attraction of scenic spots\" of pull and \"novelty seeking and knowledge gaining\" of push.The finding also shows that the factors such as gender,age,education background and income would have influ-ence on the relations between pull and push directly.\"Outside attraction of scenic spots\" is related to \"keeping health and having social intercourse\",\"seeking novelty and gaining knowledge\" and \"employment\",and the other different groups are influenced by other factors.",

        "abstract": "In the present work, properties of the interlayer breathing modes in twisted MoS samples with different structures are carefully examined. The distribution of peak position of the breathing modes is mainly dependent on overall layer numbers, and is only slightly affected by specific structure of the sample. Linear chain model calculation shows quantitatively a markedly decrease in interlayer force on the twisted interface, and slight difference in Raman frequency may mean considerable difference in interlayer force. When one or both of the component layers get too thick, no new breathing modes can be found, indicating that rigidity of the component may affect the coupling efficiency. Our work demonstrates that low-frequency Raman spectroscopy can act as an effective indirect strategy for the detection of interlayer interaction, which is a good complement to existing methods such as AFM technologies.",

In this paper, we reported a facile and scalable bottom-up approach to synthsizing atomically thin BN nanosheets in a molten salt medium. As-prepared BN nanosheets can be used as an effective co-catalyst to improve the catalytic performance of carbon nitride photocatalyst, owing to the interfacial effect induced by their addition. In the case of photodegradation of rhodamine B, for example, the photodegradation rate of carbon nitride could be approximately doubled when 5 wt% as-prepared BN nanosheets were added.",

The meta-analysis in this article took a cross-cultural perspective to explore whether there were any differences between the effects of cyber victimization and traditional victimization on the presence of depression and anxiety in children and adolescents and to examine the effects of moderators in explaining these differences/similarities. Fifty-six empirical studies (generating 148 independent samples) were included with a total sample size of 214,819 participants. The results indicated that the effects of cyber victimization and the subtypes of traditional victimization on anxiety were significantly different, and there was a marginally significant difference for depression. The moderating effects of country of origin were found to be significant for depression, with the mean effect size in North America being significantly higher than in China and Europe, which suggested that culture was an important factor. The moderating effects of age were also found to be significant for the relationships between traditional victimization and depression, traditional victimization and anxiety, cyber victimization and depression, and cyber victimization and anxiety. In addition, the effect size for cyber victimization and depression has increased in more recent publication years.",

The proposed algorithms and architecture show a median throughput gain of 110% for downlink and 40% for uplink in system simulations performed according to the 3GPP methodology.",

At physical layer, there are two main solutions: 1) Dedicated Short Range Communication, which is based on IEEE 802.11p standard and 2) Cellular V2X, which is a recent development in 3GPP LTE standard to support V2X use case. In this paper, we provide our comparison of the performance of the two aforementioned technologies at both link level and system level. Based on this study, one can see that Cellular V2X provides significant improvement over Dedicated Short Range Communication in terms of communication range, without suffering in other aspects. This improvement is equivalent to longer reaction time and more lives saved in the road.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the rare-earth elements in white light-emitting phosphors have a problem of increased demand and high price. To overcome these disadvantages, defects have been considered to act as new efficient luminescent centers to replace rare-earth elements. In this work, a rare-earth free self-activated orange light emitting phosphor of single-phase magnesium boron nitride, Mg3BN3, was successfully designed and synthesized by a relatively simple solid-state reaction. Its crystal structure and electronic structure have been measured using Rietveld refinement on the basis of X-ray diffraction data and density functional theory (DFT). The results show that Mg3BN3 crystallizes in a centrosymmetric hexagonal phase with plenty of N[double bond, length as m-dash]B[double bond, length as m-dash]N double bonds and has a direct bandgap. The SEM and TEM images and Raman spectra exhibit the sample's good dispersibility and great crystallinity. Under excitation at 397 nm, a broad emission band with orange light emission peaked at 617 nm can be obtained. It is speculated to result from the defect energy levels formed by vacancies, which can also lead to tunability of the emission peak at about 100 nm. The thermal quenching shows that Mg3BN3 at 200 °C still has more than 40% of the initial intensity at room temperature. All these results indicate that the self-activated light emitting phosphors of Mg3BN3 are a potential candidate for n-UV LED applications.",

        "abstract": "Enhancing system capacity while maintaining quality of ser- vice is an important issue in wireless cellular networks. In this paper, we present a localized channel sharing scheme to address this problem. Our basic idea is to allow channels to be shared between adjacent cells at the expense of a smaller initial allocation of channels per cell. We show that this tradeoff results in a better utilization of network resources. An important feature of our sharing scheme is that channel management is localized between adjacent cells, and no global coordination or optimiza- tion is required, thus making it suitable for implementation. The sharing scheme can also facilitate handoff processing. We provide numerical re- sults comparing our scheme with the channel reservation technique, and find a significant performance improvement over a wide range of traffic parameters and a variety of quality of service requirements.",

        "abstract": "The recently proposed channel model by the Third Generation Partnership Project for fifth generation New Radio (5G-NR) systems at millimeter- wave carrier frequencies in TR38.901 provides a good starting point for understanding the impact of propagation, material penetration, and blockage in cellular access systems. With this backdrop, the focus of this article is on hand and body blockage which have a significant bearing on user equipment (UE) design and in the practical viability of millimeter-wave systems. Building on TR38.901, we first study hand and body blockage loss with experiments using a 28 GHz experimental prototype that emulates a 5G base station and a form-factor UE. These measurement estimates show that while blockage losses can be substantial, they are significantly lower than the agreed model in TR38.901. We then study the implications of these revised estimates on spherical coverage with the UE. For this, we consider two form-factor UE designs: a face design and an edge design. Our studies show that while both designs are generally comparable in terms of spherical coverage, practical design considerations favor the edge design over the face design. We finally report on the timescales at which blockage events occur and show that given the symbol periods in 5G-NR, it is possible to implement mitigation strategies to overcome blockage (e.g., switch beams at the UE from a blocked path to an unblocked path).",

        "abstract": "The aim of our study is to examine the plasma levels of the four kinds of neurodegenerative proteins in plasma: α-syn, T-tau, P-tau and Aβ-42 in Parkinson's disease (PD) and to evaluate the relationship between their plasma levels and PD motor subtypes. 84 patients with PD were enrolled in our study, and finally, 73 of them were classified into the tremor-dominant subtype (TD) and the postural instability gait difficulty subtype (PIGD). Their motor performance was evaluated by a series of clinical assessments: Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOGQ), Timed Up and Go (TUGs), Tinetti balance, and Tinetti gait. Plasma levels of these proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The plasma level of α-syn was significantly higher in PD patients when compared to controls (p = 0.004), and significantly higher in the PIGD group when compared to the TD group (p = 0.03). While the plasma level of Aβ-42 was significantly lower in PD patients than in controls (p = 0.002), and significantly lower in the PIGD group than in the TD group (p = 0.05). In PD patients, the plasma level of α-syn (r = -0.355, p < 0.001) was significantly related to the severity of Tenitti Gait score, even after performing multiple linear regression (p = 0.002). While the plasma level of Aβ-42 (r = -0.261, p < 0.05) was significantly associated with the severity of PIGD score and remained correlate when performed multiple linear regression (p = 0.005). The patients with PIGD subtype are characterized with a lower level of plasma Aβ-42 and a higher plasma level of α-syn, which may be used as biomarkers for diagnosis and progression of the subtypes of PD.",

        "abstract": "In the current study, aiming to get brighter green phosphors for LEDs and FEDs, Ce3+ and Tb3+ were successfully co-doped into the newly discovered matrix, [Mg1.25Si1.25Al2.5]O3N3 through solid-state reaction. The sample presents a broad excitation band covering (n-)UV region from 240 to 420 nm and a sharp green Tb3+ characteristic emission with negligible Ce3+ emission. The efficient energy transfer mechanism from Ce3+ to Tb3+ has been calculated to be dipole–dipole interaction, which leads to a 13% higher brightness at its optimum excitation than the green phosphor of BaSrSiO4:Eu2+ commodity. The gentle thermal quenching trend and relatively high quantum yield of the sample is also remarkable. A LED lamp fabricated by the sample and the commercial phosphors demonstrated better performances than the traditional one with a color rendering index of 84.5 and CIE coordinate of (0.3190, 0.3290). Additionally, the cathodoluminescence spectra of the sample display an outstanding unsaturated peak intensity and anti-degradation as well. The results indicate that [Mg1.25Si1.25Al2.5]O3N3:Ce3+,Tb3+ could be considered as a promising green-emitting material for white LEDs and FEDs application.",

        "abstract": "In widely used phosphor-converted white-light-emitting diodes, thermal stability is one of the key indexes for phosphors. It not only implies that the emission intensity should remain unchanged, but also requires a steady peak pattern and position when the phosphors work at varying temperatures. For realizing excellent thermal stability, the thermal behaviors of various phosphors have been discussed and clearly explained in this review article, which focuses on single-doped Ce3+ or Eu2+ or co-doped oxides, oxynitrides, and nitride-based phosphors. These results indicate that the luminescence properties of different phosphors would show abundant changes under varying temperatures, which mainly relies on the crystal structure of the host. By analyzing the relationship between the thermal behavior and host lattice of the phosphors in different matrixes, it has been concluded that a rigid crystal structure combined with a symmetric site is the precondition for phosphors to realize excellent thermal stability; therefore, this work summaries various types of systems with a rigid framework and several ways to prevent phosphors from undergoing thermal disturbances. This provides a research direction toward exploring new and stable phosphors and ways to improve the thermal stability of existing phosphors.",

        "abstract": "This study applies the wavelet analysis to the tidal gauge records, alongshore winds, atmospheric temperature and pressure along the China coast in winter 2008. The analysis results show three events of sea level oscillations (SLOs) on the shelf induced by winter storms. The first event occurred from January 9 to 21. The SLO periods were double-peaked at 1.6–5.3 and 7.0–16.0 d with the power densities of 0.04–0.05 and 0.10–0.15 m·d, respectively. The second event occurred from February 5 to 18. The SLO period was single-peaked at 2.3–3.5 d with power density of 0.03–0.04 m·d. The third event occurred from February 20 to March 8. The SLO periods were doublepeaked at 1.5–4.3 and 6.1–8.2 d with the power densities of 0.08–0.11 and 0.02–0.08 m·d, respectively. The SLOs propagated along the coast from Zhejiang in north to Guangdong in south. The phase speeds ranged about 9–29 m/s from Kanmen to Pingtan, 5–11 m/s from Xiamen to Huizhou and 11–22 m/s from Huizhou to Shuidong. The dispersion relation of the SLOs shows their nature of coastal-trapped wave.",

The results show that the periods of CSWs propagating along the coast from Kanmen to Shuidong are in bands of 62 and 133 h. The phase speeds are in a range from 8 to 13 m s −1  between Kanmen and Shantou, from 9 to 11 m s −1  between Shantou and Huizhou and from 10 to 15 m s −1  between Huizhou and Shuidong, respectively. Satellite altimeter captured along-track sea level anomaly during the CSW events. Further analysis using the theoretical cross-shore CSW modes to fit the along-track sea level anomaly data indicates that the first three wave modes play important roles during the CSW events and the first mode is a dominant component.",

        "title": "Indoor mm-Wave Channel Measurements: Comparative Study of 2.9 GHz and 29 GHz.",
        "abstract": "The millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) frequency band ~30-300 GHz has received significant attention lately as a prospective band for 5G systems. Millimeter-wave frequencies have traditionally been used for backhaul, satellite and other fixed services. While these bands offer substantial amount of bandwidth and opportunity for spatial multiplexing, the propagation characteristics for terrestrial mobile usage need to be fully understood prior to system design. Towards this end, this paper presents preliminary indoor measurement results obtained using a channel sounder equipped with omni- and directional antennas at 2.9 GHz and 29 GHz as a comparative study of the two bands. The measurements are made within a Qualcomm building in Bridgewater, NJ, USA, for two separate floors, each representing a different yet representative type of office plan. We present measurements and estimated parameters for path loss, excess delay, RMS delay and analyze the power profile of received paths. In addition, we present several spherical scans of particular links to illustrate the 3-D angular spread of the received paths. This work represents initial results of an ongoing effort for comprehensive indoor and outdoor channel measurements. The measurements presented here, along with cited references, offer interesting insights into propagation conditions (e.g. loss, delay/angular spread etc.), coverage and robustness for mobile use of millimeter-wave bands. We believe additional extensive measurement campaigns in diverse settings by academia and industry would help facilitate the generation of usable channel models.",

        "abstract": " Self-regulated learning refers to the monitoring and controlling of one's own cognitive performance before, during, and after a learning episode. Previous literature suggested that self-regulated learning had a significant relationship with academic achievement, but not all self-regulated learning strategies exerted the same influences. Using an invalid strategy may waste the limited psychological resources, which will cause the ego depletion effect. The present meta-analysis study intended to search for the best self-regulated learning strategies and inefficient strategies for Chinese students in elementary and secondary school, and analyzed the critical phases of self-regulated learning according to Zimmerman's theory. The moderating effects of gender, grade, and publication year were also analyzed.  Empirical studies which conducted in real teaching situations of elementary and secondary education were systematically searched using Chinese academic databases. Studies focused on undergraduate students, students of special education, or online learning environments were excluded. Fifty-five cross-sectional studies and four intervention studies (which generated 264 independent samples) were included with a total sample size of 23,497 participants. Random effects model was chosen in the current meta-analysis, and publication bias was also examined.  The results indicated that the overall effect size of self-regulated learning on academic achievement was small for primary and secondary school students in China. The effect sizes of self-efficacy, task strategies, and self-evaluation were relatively higher than other strategies. Self-regulated learning strategies have the largest effect size on science disciplines (including mathematics and physics). Performance phase and self-reflection phase are key phases of self-regulated learning. From 1998 to 2016, the effect size between self-regulated learning and academic achievement was gradually decreasing.  The main findings of the current study showed that self-efficacy, task strategies, and self-evaluation were key self-regulated learning strategies for Chinese students. Performance phase and self-reflection phase played significant roles in the process of self-regulated learning. Future studies need to include more intervention studies with rigorous treatment fidelity control and provide more empirical evidence from online learning, so as to compare the different effects of self-regulated learning between traditional education and online education.",

        "abstract": " Diagnosing with low-grade gliomas (LGGs) can be a very shocking and stressful experience, a traumatic event potentially leading to the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and posttraumatic growth (PTG). Understanding how patients cognitively and behaviorally response to their diagnosing is also important to postoperative treatment. Thus, the current study explored the association between PTG and quality of life (QoL) of Chinese patients with LGGs. The moderation effects of coping strategies and PTSS on the relationship between PTG and QoL have been examined as well.  Posttraumatic stress symptoms, Posttraumatic growth, coping strategies, and QoL were measured by using self-report surveys. Three hundred and thirty patients completed surveys approximately 1 month after surgery. We used three multiple regression models and added interaction terms in these models to test the moderation effects of PTSS and coping strategies on the relationship between PTG and QoL.  The results of hierarchical multiple regression suggested that PTG significantly predicted QoL, both PTSS and coping strategies moderated the association between PTG and QoL. Specifically, the association between PTG and QoL for patients who have non-significant PTSS is stronger than those who have significant PTSS. Furthermore, as the score of Avoidant Coping increases, the association between PTG and QoL becomes weaker.  Posttraumatic growth may help to improve the QoL of LGGs patients, but PTSS and Avoidant Coping impeded the positive effect of PTG on QoL.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTTo further improve the thermal insulation performance of porous mullite ceramics used in important industrial sectors, a combined foam-gelcasting and pore-former addition approach was investigated in this work, by which hierarchical porous mullite ceramics with excellent properties, in particular, thermal insulation property, were prepared. Both mesopores (2–50 nm) and macropores (117.8–202.7 μm) were formed in porous mullite ceramics resultant from 2 h firing at 1300°C with various amounts of submicron-sized CaCO3 pore former. The former mainly arose from the decomposition of CaCO3, and the latter from the foam-gelcasting process. The porous samples prepared with CaCO3 addition had low linear shrinkage of 2.35–4.83%, high porosity of 72.98–79.07% and high compressive strength of 5.52–14.82 MPa. Most importantly, they also exhibited a very low thermal-conductivity, e.g. 0.114 W m−1 K−1 at 200°C, which was much lower than in the cases of their counterparts prepared via the conventional foam-gelcast...",

FlashLinQ leverages the fine-grained parallel channel access offered by OFDM and incorporates an analog energy-level-based signaling scheme that enables signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)-based distributed scheduling. This new signaling mechanism, and the concomitant scheduling algorithm, enables efficient channel-aware spatial resource allocation, leading to significant gains over a CSMA/CA system using RTS/CTS. FlashLinQ is a complete system architecture including: 1) timing and frequency synchronization derived from cellular spectrum; 2) peer discovery; 3) link management; and 4) channel-aware distributed power, data rate, and link scheduling. FlashLinQ has been implemented for operation over licensed spectrum on a digital signal processor/ field-programmable gate array (DSP/FPGA) platform. In this paper, we present FlashLinQ performance results derived from both measurements and simulations.",

The behavior patterns between the high- and low-achievement students and of different mathematical topics were compared using two-layer hidden Markov model. The results showed that high-achievement students exhibited more effective learning behaviors, such as asking for explanation and practicing after making an error. In contrast, low-achievement students tended to make consecutive errors without seeking help. Moreover, students’ learning behaviors tended to be more effective when learning simple topics. Our findings implied that intelligent tutoring systems could track the behavior patterns of students and detect ineffective learning states, so as to provide learning support accordingly.",

        "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to play essential roles in the human cardiovascular system. However, information about their mechanisms is limited, and a comprehensive view of cardiac lncRNAs is lacking from a multiple tissues perspective to date. Here, the landscape of the lncRNA transcriptome in human heart was summarized. We summarized all lncRNA transcripts from publicly available human transcriptome resources (156 heart samples and 210 samples from 29 other tissues) and systematically analysed all annotated and novel lncRNAs expressed in heart. A total of 7485 lncRNAs whose expression was elevated in heart (HE lncRNAs) and 453 lncRNAs expressed in all 30 analysed tissues (EIA lncRNAs) were extracted. Using various bioinformatics resources, methods and tools, the features of these lncRNAs were discussed from various perspectives, including genomic structure, conservation, dynamic variation during heart development, cis-regulation, differential expression in cardiovascular diseases and cancers as well as regulation at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Afterwards, all the features discussed above were integrated into a user-friendly resource named CARDIO-LNCRNAS (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/CARDIO-LNCRNAS/ or http://www.bio-bigdata.net/CARDIO-LNCRNAS/). This study represents the first global view of lncRNAs in the human cardiovascular system based on multiple tissues and sheds light on the role of lncRNAs in developments and heart disorders.",

        "abstract": "Geospatial cognition is an important theme in the field of geo-information science and the study on it has sprung up since last century.In 1995,the report of Advancing Geographic Information Science was published.It put forward three important study fields,including the geospatial cognitive mode,geography concept mathematical method,geo-information and social study.In 2001,the geospatial cognition as a preferential sustaining project was supported by the committee of national natural science fund in China.Based on similar studies both at home and abroad and theories of geo-information science,psychology and tourists' behavior,its study system has been shaped.The paper discusses the basic process and characteristics of tourists' geospatial cognition,as well as the effect of tourist' spatial cognition based on different geospatial forms.It aims to solve study difficulties of tourist' cognition and tries to build the cognitive mode.In practice,the paper aims to help expression of geo-information,tourism resource development,tourism planning,products and design of traveling routes and tourism marketing.The data of this study came from field research about cross-bound tourists & domestic tourists in 1997—2005.The field research included what cognitive results of tourists was influenced by forms of different geospatial information and which was the emphasis of geospatial cognition.6353 questionnaires were totally obtained.Through statistical method and theory analysis,the research shows that the tourist' geospatial cognition is mainly focused on the spatial characteristics perception,the spatial object cognition and the spatial pattern cognition,especially in distance cognition,direction cognition,scenic areas cognition and geospatial patterns cognition.The geospatial cognition takes place in cognitive space.As special group of people,tourists have different geospatial cognition compared with other people.The spatial characteristics perception is affected by tourism and geography environment.The spatial object cognition of tourists is determined by tourism elements,such as hotel,restaurant,traffic,shopping,amusement;Tourists pay more attention to cognitive distance.So the distance cognition is mainly determined by time;Tourists cognitive direction by the mode of typical land mark and different topological relation.The cognition of scenic areas is mainly based on tourists' psychological image.Long-distance tourists make decisions according to the mode of the cultural difference,whereas medium and short distance tourists adopt the mode of functional difference.The cognition of tourist geospatial patterns is an integration of tourism functional features,spatial objects and perception of regional geographical features.Our current goal is to develop a geospatial cognitive mode of tourists.It can be used for expression of geo-information and design of tourism routes.A key aspect of this work is the field research and geospatial cognition type of tourists.The geospatial cognitive mode built,but the mode frame needs to be increased further.Other methods would be used for different tourists.",

Our scheme exploits unused resources in neighboring cells without the need for global coordination. We formulate a minimax approach to Optimizing the allocation of channels in this sharing scheme. We develop a measurement-based distributed algorithm to achieve this objective and study its convergence. We illustrate, via simulation results, that the distributed channel sharing scheme performs significantly better than the fixed channel scheme over a wide variety of traffic conditions.",

        "abstract": "Wireless backhaul allows densification of mobile networks without incurring additional fiber deployment cost. This, in turn, leads to high spatial reuse, which is a significant tool to meet increasing wireless demand in 5G networks. Integrated access and backhaul (IAB), where access and backhaul network share the same standard wireless technology (e.g. 5G new radio (NR) standard), allows interoperability among different IAB manufacturers and flexible operation between access and back-haul. This paper investigates joint resource allocation and relay selection in a multi-hop IAB network to maximize geometric mean of UE rates. Our study illustrates several advantages and features of IAB. First, IAB significantly improves UE rates compared to access only networks and can provide an important intermediate solution during incremental fiber deployment. Second, IAB networks with optimal mesh outperforms IAB networks with RSRP based spanning tree both in terms of rate and latency.",

        "abstract": "Enhancing system capacity while maintaining quality of service is an important issue in wireless cellular networks. In this paper, we present a new localized channel sharing scheme to address this problem. Our basic idea is to allow channels to be shared between adjacent cells. We further propose a fixed channel assignment scheme to maximize channel reuse efficiency while allowing channel sharing. We show that our sharing scheme can also facilitate handoff processing. An important feature of our sharing scheme is that channel management is localized between adjacent cells, and no global coordination or optimization is required, thus making it suitable for implementation. We provide simulation results comparing our scheme with the conventional channel assignment and handoff techniques. We find that our scheme improves system capacity over a broad range of traffic parameters and a variety of quality of service requirements.",

It is therefore recommended that starting freezing and thawing tests when the concrete is 14 days old should be permitted, which will produce great significance for shortening the period of freeze-thaw testing of concrete.",

        "abstract": "The de Bruijn graph, a fundamental data structure to represent and organize genome sequence, plays important roles in various kinds of sequence analysis tasks. With the rapid development of HTS data and ever-increasing number of assembled genomes, there is a high demand to construct the very large de Bruijn graph for sequences up to Tera-base-pair level. Current approaches may have unaffordable memory footprints to handle such a large de Bruijn graph. We propose a lightweight parallel de Bruijn graph construction approach: de Bruijn Graph Constructor in Scalable Memory (deGSM). The main idea of deGSM is to efficiently construct the Burrows-Wheeler Transformation (BWT) of the unipaths of the de Bruijn graph in constant RAM space and transform the BWT into the original unitigs. The experimental results demonstrate that, just with a commonly available machine, deGSM is able to handle very large genome sequence(s), e.g., the contigs (305 Gbp) and scaffolds (1.1 Tbp) recorded in GenBank database and Picea abies HTS dataset (9.7 Tbp). Moreover, deGSM also has faster or comparable construction speed compared with state-of-the-art approaches. With its high scalability and efficiency, deGSM has enormous potential in many large scale genomics studies.The deGSM is publicly available at: https://github.com/hitbc/deGSM.",

        "abstract": "In the Internet era,online information is an important source for tourists.Online information seeking plays an essential role in tourists' decision-making and tourism product purchasing,which is also one of the important research topics about tourists' information behavior.This research investigates the behavior of keywords used in online tourism information seeking.First,the study shows that the number of keywords used for information seeking is usually around seven;and the keywords are used approximately 8.54 times in each seeking process.In a successful information seeking process,the number of the keywords has a direct influence on the search result.There is no doubt that too much information will be discovered if too few keywords are used.So,few-keyword searches increase the difficulty of information discovery and decreases the efficiency of information acquisition.However,if too many or too specific keywords are used,tourists may not be able to get what they want.Secondly,the research result shows that the longer time the tourists spend on information searches,the stronger desire for information they have.Meanwhile,for tourists who are familiar with the destination,they will enter fewer keywords.Both keywords-based semantic analysis and frequency analysis reveal that destination names,\" ticket\",\" tourism\",names of viewing spots,and the name of the starting place are the most commonly used keywords.Understandably,a destination name is the most frequently used keyword.Tourists narrow down information by specifying a place name,and then search for a specific subject by specifying other keywords.Qualifiers,e.g.,\"nearby\",\"cheap\",can be added to pinpoint the search goal.Judging from the actual keywords,it is found that instead of interest in higher-level information,such as entertainment or shopping,tourists pay more attention to basic information,such as the scenic spots in the target area,transportation,accommodation,and so on.This finding is similar to the research result of Pan Bing and Hu Xingbao.Thirdly,this study identifies four keywords-based search modes: the destination name plus search content mode which is suitable for all destination tourism information searches,the destination landmark plus hotel mode which is mainly used in hotel information search,the modification search mode which is a process in which tourists approach the search goal by adding or reducing determinant to obtain the most satisfying result,and the associative-word list mode where tourists choose the associated keywords,which are provided automatically by the search engine,to search tourism information.The fourth mode reflects the principle of convenience in the tourists' search process.Four keywords-based information searching modes summarize the tourists' behavior patterns in tourism information search through search engines and have significant implications for search engine optimization and for constructing specific search engines for tourism.This study is expected to provide references for tourism marketing,tourism website construction,and destination marketing system construction.",

        "abstract": "As a social and cultural phenomenon, the principal part of tourism is tourism activities and behaviors which are carried out by tourists. Thus, tourists have become the heart of tourism activities as well as the main line of tourism. The study on the behaviors of tourists is theoretically and practically meaningful to tourism reasearch. A sample of 6600 international tourists' survey was taken and distributed during July and August of 2004, determining the overall behaviors of international tourists in six hottest international tourism cities of China. Based on the psychoanalysis survey, this study establishes different tourism behavior patterns to the visitors who come from Japan, Korea, North America, Southeastern Asia and Europe from the aspects of traveling decision-making, spatial behavior, and tourist cultur behavior. And the law of different tourists' behaviors in colonial regions and its restrictive factors have been studied by utilizing psycho-experimentation, inductive method, deductive inference method, behavioral mind-map and mathematical statistics method. There are five main aspects discovered in the research result. Firstly, in view of tourists' choice perference, the mode of otherness has been used in the choice of tourism resources and products, and the mode of safety, convenience and comfort has been used in vehicle choice. Secondly, in view of time-space dynamic state regulation, tourists' flow rapidly weakens from the east to the west and focuses more on the eastern areas of China, it also extends to the other provinces, such as Shannxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan. Thirdly, stimulus-response pattern of tourism is the main mode of decision-making. The decision of foreign tourists is based on the following process, \"tourism desire→ the collection of tourism information → travel time to determine →tourists' destination selection→travel agencies to consult←→ travel agencies to serve→ the schedule to begin travel.\" The effective factors controlling tourism decision-making also includes: the image of tourism destination, tourism product brands, travel agencies, the level of economic development, business development needs, the quality of tourism services, etc. Fourthly, the article studies the cross-cultural conflicting features in \"the cultural limited area\", the mode of weakening effects of recoganitive expectation to expose the evaluation of tourists' willingness to travel. Fifthly, authors believe that tourism area industry is the heart of tourism, and carry out the research on the map of tourism moods. some reasonable advice for the behaviors of foreign tourists. are also put foward in the end, including further creating the most energetic, safe, sunny image of oriental cultural ancient city. building up the powerful tourism destination in western part of China, positively producing experiential human cultural tourism products and efficiently improving the quality of tourism service as well.",

This availability raises a major concern about data storage costs, given that an effective and efficient compression algorithm for genome data remains an unresolved challenge in genomic data studies. In this paper, we propose a compression method, DeepDNA, that is a hybrid convolutional and recurrent deep neural network for compressing human genome data. In the DeepDNA model, the convolutional layer captures the genomeu0027s local features, while the recurrent layer captures long-term dependencies for estimating the next base probabilities in the genomic sequence. The experimental results on human mitochondrial genome datasets show the effectiveness of the DeepDNA method.The code for DeepDNA is available at https://github.com/rongiiewang/deepDNA.",

The basic idea is to reduce intercellular interference and improve the capture probability by an a priori assignment of power levels of channels used in different cells. We formulate and solve an optimal channel-selection problem for our scheme. We find that the optimal policy is in a form of bang-bang control. We illustrate our channel-selection solution by a case study with uniform fairness constraint. We evaluate, via numerical analysis and simulation, both throughput and delay of the new scheme, and compare them with other schemes. We find that our scheme can achieve significant performance improvements, in terms of both the maximum throughput and throughput-delay tradeoff, over a wide range of capture ratio values",

        "abstract": "The focus of this work is on cost and complexity- induced rank-constrained precoding for millimeter- wave (mmW) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. The higher antenna dimensionality and sparse channel structure of mmW systems motivate directional precoding schemes over more complex and less robust eigen-mode-based precoding schemes. Building on a prior work that illustrated the superiority in design, robustness and performance of a directional rank-1 beamformer, this work considers higher-rank directional precoding structures for mmW systems. It is shown that directional precoders continue to enjoy similar properties in single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) systems. But from a network efficiency consideration, it would be more worthwhile to expend the radio frequency (RF) chain resource on multi-user transmissions. Towards this goal, a directional scheduler and different directional beamforming structures are proposed here. These structures are shown to result in significant performance improvement over higher-rank SU-MIMO schemes.",

We divided 65 Parkinson's disease patients into anxiety (PD-A; =18) and non-anxiety (PD-NA; =45) groups based on a Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale cutoff score of 12. The PD-A patients exhibited altered putamen FC with cortical and subcortical regions. The PD-A patients showed enhanced putamen FC with the caudatum, which correlated with increased emotional processing during anxiety. Decreased putamen FC with the orbitofrontal gyrus and cerebellum also correlated with increased anxiety in Parkinson's disease. Our findings demonstrate that anxiety disorder in Parkinson's disease is associated with abnormal putamen FC networks, especially with caudatum, orbitofrontal gyrus and cerebellum.",

Their crystalline structure and morphology were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The as-prepared nanoshuttles were ∼20 μm long, and their diameter decreased from about 300 nm in the central part to u003c30 nm at their terminal tips. A combined oriented attachment and Ostwald ripening mechanism is proposed for the Co2P nanoshuttle formation, based on the experimental results and density functional theory calculations. The as-prepared Co2P nanoshuttles exhibited excellent electrochemical properties, e.g., a specific capacitance of 246 F g−1 at a discharge current density of 1 A g−1 along with excellent cycling stability, suggesting their great application potential in high-performance energy storage/conversion devices.",

        "abstract": "The ongoing commercial deployment of millimeter wave systems brings into focus a number of practical issues in form factor user equipment (UE) design. With wavelengths becoming smaller, antenna gain patterns becoming directional, and link budgets critically dependent on beamforming, it becomes imperative to use a number of antenna modules at different locations of the UE for good performance. While more antennas/modules can enhance beamforming array gains, it comes with the trade-off of higher component cost, power consumption of the associated radio frequency circuitry, and a beam management overhead in learning the appropriate beam weights. Thus, the goal of a good UE design is to provide robust \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">spherical coverage</italic>\n corresponding to good array gains over the entire sphere around the UE with a low beam management overhead, complexity, and cost. The scope of this paper is to study the implications of two popular commercial millimeter-wave UE designs (a \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">face</italic>\n and an \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">edge</italic>\n design) on spherical coverage. We show that the analog beam codebooks can result in good performance for both the designs, and the edge design provides a better trade-off in terms of robust performance (with hand blockage), beam management overhead, implementation complexity from an antenna placement standpoint, and cost.",

Geophysical fluid dynamics predicts that for an enclosed ocean basin, there exist the Rossby normal modes if considering the Earth rotation effect. We use a rectangular ocean basin with a uniform depth to simulate the SCS deep basin and obtain 2D (x − y) sea level distribution patterns of the Rossby normal modes, consisting of alternating cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, as well as their dynamic parameters. The periods of the modes are evidenced by the Fourier period power density spectra of satellite altimeter sea level anomaly (SLA) data from 1993 to 2015. The 2D normal mode patterns are evidenced by SLA images. The phase speeds are evidenced by that derived from the westward movement of the wave/eddy patterns on SLA time-series images.",

In this work, carbon nitride with a novel morphology, i.e., tetragonal carbon nitride hollow tube (TCNT), was in-situ synthesized by a molten salt method at 450 °C using melamine as the starting precursor. As-prepared TCNTs were 2–20 μm long and 50–2000 nm wide and possessed higher content of impurity nitrogen and larger specific surface area than conventional bulk g-C 3 N 4  (B-CN). A possible salt-assisted self-assembly mechanism is believed to have dominated the formation of TCNTs. As-prepared TCNTs exhibited superior photocatalytic activities and adsorption performance for methylene blue and phenol degradation to B-CN, suggesting that they could be potentially used as a promising photocatalyst and adsorbent.",
